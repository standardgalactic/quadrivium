Higher Engineering Mathematics
Now in its eighth edition, Higher Engineering Mathe-
matics has helped thousands of students succeed in their
exams. Theory is kept to a minimum, with the emphasis
ﬁrmly placed on problem-solving skills, making this a
thoroughly practical introduction to the advanced engi-
neering mathematics that students need to master. The
extensive and thorough topic coverage makes this an
ideal text for upper-level vocational courses and for
undergraduate degree courses. It is also supported by
a fully updated companion website with resources for
both students and lecturers. It has full solutions to all
2,000 further questions contained in the 277 practice
exercises.
John Bird, BSc (Hons), CMath, CEng, CSci, FITE,
FIMA, FCollT, is the former Head of Applied Electron-
ics in the Faculty of Technology at Highbury College,
Portsmouth, UK. More recently he has combined free-
lance lecturing and examining, and is the author of
over 130 textbooks on engineering and mathemati-
cal subjects with worldwide sales of over one mil-
lion copies. He is currently lecturing at the Defence
School of Marine Engineering in the Defence Col-
lege of Technical Training at HMS Sultan, Gosport,
Hampshire, UK.
Why is knowledge of mathematics important in engineering?
A career in any engineering or scientiﬁc ﬁeld will
require both basic and advanced mathematics. Without
mathematics to determine principles, calculate dimen-
sions and limits, explore variations, prove concepts, and
so on, there would be no mobile telephones, televisions,
stereosystems,videogames,microwaveovens,comput-
ers, or virtually anything electronic. There would be no
bridges, tunnels, roads,skyscrapers,automobiles,ships,
planes, rockets or most things mechanical. There would
be no metals beyond the common ones, such as iron
and copper, no plastics, no synthetics. In fact, society
would most certainly be less advanced without the use
of mathematics throughout the centuries and into the
future.
Electrical engineers require mathematics to design,
develop, test, or supervise the manufacturingand instal-
lation of electrical equipment, components, or systems
for commercial, industrial, military, or scientiﬁc use.
Mechanical engineers require mathematics to perform
engineering duties in planning and designing tools,
engines, machines, and other mechanically functioning
equipment; they oversee installation, operation, mainte-
nance, and repair of such equipment as centralised heat,
gas, water, and steam systems.
Aerospace engineers require mathematics to perform
a variety of engineering work in designing, construct-
ing, and testing aircraft, missiles, and spacecraft; they
conduct basic and applied research to evaluate adapt-
ability of materials and equipment to aircraft design and
manufacture and recommend improvements in testing
equipment and techniques.
Nuclear engineers require mathematics to conduct
research on nuclear engineeringproblemsor apply prin-
ciples and theory of nuclear science to problems con-
cerned with release, control, and utilisation of nuclear
energy and nuclear waste disposal.
Petroleum engineers require mathematics to devise
methods to improve oil and gas well production and
determine the need for new or modiﬁed tool designs;
they oversee drilling and offer technical advice to
achieve economical and satisfactory progress.
Industrial engineers require mathematics to design,
develop, test, and evaluate integrated systems for man-
aging industrial production processes, including human
work factors, quality control, inventory control, logis-
tics and material ﬂow, cost analysis, and production
co-ordination.

Environmental
engineers
require
mathematics
to
design, plan, or perform engineering duties in the
prevention, control, and remediation of environmen-
tal health hazards, using various engineering disci-
plines; their work may include waste treatment, site
remediation, or pollution control technology.
Civil engineers require mathematics in all levels in
civil engineering – structural engineering, hydraulics
and geotechnical engineering are all ﬁelds that employ
mathematicaltools such as differentialequations,tensor
analysis, ﬁeld theory, numerical methods andoperations
research.
Knowledge of mathematics is therefore needed by each
of the engineering disciplines listed above.
It is intended that this text – Higher Engineering Mathe-
matics –willprovideastep-by-stepapproachtolearning
fundamental mathematics needed for your engineering
studies.

Preface
This eighth edition of Higher Engineering Mathemat-
ics covers essential mathematical material suitable for
students studying Degrees, Foundation Degrees, and
Higher National Certiﬁcate and Diploma courses in
Engineering disciplines.
The text has been conveniently divided into the fol-
lowing fourteen convenient categories: number and
algebra, geometry and trigonometry, graphs, complex
numbers, matrices and determinants, vector geometry,
introduction to calculus, further differential calculus,
further integral calculus, further differential equations,
statistics and probability, Laplace transforms, Fourier
series and z-transforms.
Increasingly, difﬁculty in understanding algebra
is proving a problem for many students as they com-
mence studying engineering courses. Inevitably there
are a lot of formulae and calculations involved with
engineering studies that require a sound grasp of alge-
bra. On the website www.routledge.com/cw/bird/ is a
document which offers a quick revision of the main
areas of algebra essential for further study, i.e. basic
algebra, simple equations, transposition of formulae,
simultaneous equations and quadratic equations.
In this new edition, all of the chapters of the pre-
vious edition are included, plus one extra, but the
order of presenting some of the calculus chapters has
been changed. New material has been added on the
introduction to numbering systems, Bayes’ theorem in
probability, the comparison of numerical methods and
z-transforms.
The primary aim of the material in this text is to
provide the fundamental analytical and underpinning
knowledge and techniques needed to successfully com-
plete scientiﬁc and engineering principles modules of
Degree, Foundation Degree and Higher National Engi-
neering programmes. The material has been designed
to enable students to use techniques learned for the
analysis, modellingand solution of realistic engineering
problems at Degree and Higher National level. It also
aims to provide some of the more advanced knowl-
edge required for those wishing to pursue careers in
mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering,elec-
trical and electronicengineering,communicationsengi-
neering, systems engineering and all variants of control
engineering.
In Higher Engineering Mathematics 8th Edi-
tion,theoryisintroducedineachchapterbyafulloutline
of essential deﬁnitions, formulae, laws, procedures, etc;
problem solving is extensively used to establish and
exemplifythe theory.It is intended that readers will gain
real understanding through seeing problems solved and
then through solving similar problems themselves.
Access to software packages such as Maple, Mathe-
matica and Derive, or a graphics calculator,will enhance
understanding of some of the topics in this text.
Each topic considered in the text is presented in a
way that assumes in the reader only knowledge attained
in BTEC National Certiﬁcate/Diploma, or similar, in an
Engineering discipline.
Higher Engineering Mathematics 8th Edition pro-
vides a follow-up to Engineering Mathematics 8th
Edition.
This textbook contains over 1050 worked prob-
lems, followed by nearly 2000 further problems (with
answers), arranged within 277 Practice Exercises.
Some 552 line diagrams further enhance understand-
ing.
Worked solutions to all 2000 of the further
problems have been prepared and can be accessed
free
by
students
and
staff
via
the
website
www.routledge.com/cw/bird/
At the end of the text, a list of Essential Formulae
is included for convenience of reference.
At intervals throughoutthe text are some 21 Revision
Tests to check understanding. For example, Revision
Test 1 covers the material in chapters 1 to 5, Revi-
sion Test 2 covers the material in chapters 6 to 8,
Revision Test 3 covers the material in chapters 9 to
11, and so on. An Instructor’s Manual, containing
full solutions to the Revision Tests, is available free to
lecturers/instructors via the website (see below).

Chapter 1
Algebra
Why it is important to understand: Algebra, polynomial division and the factor and remainder theorems
It is probably true to say that there is no branch of engineering, physics, economics, chemistry or computer
science which does not require the understanding of the basic laws of algebra, the laws of indices, the
manipulation of brackets, the ability to factorise and the laws of precedence. This then leads to the ability
to solve simple, simultaneous and quadratic equations which occur so often. The study of algebra also
revolves around using and manipulating polynomials. Polynomials are used in engineering, computer
programming, software engineering, in management, and in business. Mathematicians, statisticians and
engineers of all sciences employ the use of polynomials to solve problems; among them are aerospace
engineers, chemical engineers, civil engineers, electrical engineers, environmental engineers, industrial
engineers, materials engineers, mechanical engineers and nuclear engineers. The factor and remainder
theorems are also employed in engineering software and electronic mathematical applications, through
which polynomials of higher degrees and longer arithmetic structures are divided without any complexity.
The study of algebra, equations, polynomial division and the factor and remainder theorems is therefore
of some considerable importance in engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand and apply the laws of indices
•
understand brackets, factorisation and precedence
•
transpose formulae and solve simple, simultaneous and quadratic equations
•
divide algebraic expressions using polynomial division
•
factorise expressions using the factor theorem
•
use the remainder theorem to factorise algebraic expressions
1.1
Introduction
In this chapter, polynomial division and the factor
and remainder theorems are explained (in Sections 1.4
to 1.6). However, before this, some essential algebra
revision on basic laws and equations is included.

Dividing the ﬁrst term of the dividend by the ﬁrst term
of the divisor, i.e. 2x2
x
gives 2x, which is put above
the ﬁrst term of the dividend as shown. The divisor
is then multiplied by 2x, i.e. 2x(x −1)= 2x 2 −2x,
which is placed under the dividend as shown. Subtract-
ing gives 3x −3. The process is then repeated, i.e. the
ﬁrst term of the divisor, x, is divided into 3x, giving
+3, which is placed above the dividend as shown. Then
3(x −1)=3x −3, which is placed under the 3x −3. The
remainder, on subtraction, is zero, which completes the
process.
Thus (2x2 +x −3) ÷ (x −1) = (2x + 3)
[A check can be made on this answer by multiplying
(2x + 3) by (x −1) which equals 2x 2 + x −3.]

The factor theorem
There is a simple relationship between the factors of
a quadratic expression and the roots of the equation
obtained by equating the expression to zero.
For example, consider the quadratic equation
x2 + 2x −8 = 0
To solve this we may factorise the quadratic expression
x2 + 2x −8 giving (x −2)(x + 4)
Hence (x −2)(x + 4) = 0
Then, if the product of two numbers is zero, one or both
of those numbers must equal zero. Therefore,
either (x −2) = 0, from which, x = 2
or
(x + 4) = 0, from which, x = −4
It is clear, then, that a factor of (x −2) indicates a root
of +2, while a factor of (x + 4) indicates a root of −4
In general, we can therefore say that:
a factor of (x −a) corresponds to a
root of x = a
In practice, we always deduce the roots of a simple
quadratic equation from the factors of the quadratic
expression, as in the above example.However, we could
reverse this process. If, by trial and error, we coulddeter-
mine that x = 2 is a root of the equation x 2 + 2x −8 = 0
we could deduce at once that (x −2) is a factor of the
expression x2 + 2x −8. We wouldn’t normally solve
quadratic equations this way – but suppose we have
to factorise a cubic expression (i.e. one in which the
highest power of the variable is 3). A cubic equation
might have three simple linear factors and the difﬁculty
of discovering all these factors by trial and error would
be considerable. It is to deal with this kind of case that
we use the factor theorem. This is just a generalised
version of what we established above for the quadratic
expression. The factor theorem provides a method of
factorising any polynomial, f (x), which has simple
factors.
A statement of the factor theorem says:

Section A
Algebra
11
‘if x = a is a root of the equation
f (x) = 0, then (x −a) is a factor of f (x)’
The following worked problems show the use of the
factor theorem.
Problem 28.
Factorise x3 −7x −6 and use it to
solve the cubic equation x 3 −7x −6 = 0.
Let f (x) = x3 −7x −6
If x = 1, then f (1) = 13 −7(1) −6 = −12
If x = 2, then f (2) = 23 −7(2) −6 = −12
If x = 3, then f (3) = 33 −7(3) −6 = 0
If f (3) = 0, then (x −3) is a factor – from the factor
theorem.
We have a choice now. We can divide x 3−7x −6 by
(x −3) or we could continue our ‘trial and error’ by
substituting further values forxin the given expression–
and hope to arrive at f (x)=0
Let us do both ways. Firstly, dividing out gives:
x2 + 3x + 2
—————————
x −3

x3 −0
−7x −6
x3 −3x2
3x2 −7x −6
3x2 −9x
————
2x −6
2x −6
———
·
·
———
Hence
x3 −7x −6
x −3
= x2 + 3x + 2
i.e.
x3 −7x −6 = (x −3)(x2 + 3x + 2)
x2 + 3x + 2 factorises ‘on sight’ as (x + 1)(x + 2).
Therefore
x3 −7x −6 = (x −3)(x + 1)(x + 2)
A second method is to continue to substitute values of
x into f (x).
Our expression for f (3) was 33 −7(3) −6. We can
see that if we continue with positive values of x the
ﬁrst term will predominate such that f (x) will not
be zero.
Therefore let us try some negative values for x.
Therefore
f (−1) = (−1)3 −7(−1) −6 = 0;
hence
(x + 1)
is
a
factor
(as
shown
above).
Also
f (−2) = (−2)3 −7(−2) −6 = 0; hence (x + 2) is
a factor (also as shown above).
To solve x3 −7x −6 = 0, we substitute the factors, i.e.
(x −3)(x + 1)(x + 2) = 0
from which, x = 3, x = −1 and x = −2
Note that the values of x, i.e. 3, −1 and −2, are
all factors of the constant term, i.e. 6. This can
give us a clue as to what values of x we should
consider.
Problem 29.
Solve the cubic equation
x3 −2x2 −5x + 6=0 by using the factor theorem.
Let f (x) = x3 −2x2 −5x + 6 and let us substitute
simple values of x like 1, 2, 3, −1, −2, and so on.
f (1) = 13 −2(1)2 −5(1) + 6 = 0,
hence (x −1) is a factor
f (2) = 23 −2(2)2 −5(2) + 6 ̸= 0
f (3) = 33 −2(3)2 −5(3) + 6 = 0,
hence (x −3) is a factor
f (−1) = (−1)3 −2(−1)2 −5(−1) + 6 ̸= 0
f (−2) = (−2)3 −2(−2)2 −5(−2) + 6 = 0,
hence (x + 2) is a factor
Hence x3 −2x2 −5x + 6 = (x −1)(x −3)(x + 2)
Therefore if x3 −2x2 −5x + 6 = 0
then
(x −1)(x −3)(x + 2) = 0
from which, x = 1, x = 3 and x = −2
Alternatively,
having
obtained
one
factor,
i.e.
(x −1) we could divide this into (x 3 −2x2 −5x + 6)
as follows:
x2 −x
−6
————————–
x −1

x3 −2x2 −5x + 6

The remainder theorem
Dividing a general quadratic expression
(ax2 + bx + c) by (x −p), where p is any whole
number, by long division (see Section 1.4) gives:
ax + (b + ap)
————————————–
x −p

ax2 + bx
+ c
ax2 −apx
(b + ap)x + c
(b + ap)x −(b + ap)p
—————————–
c + (b + ap)p
—————————–
The
remainder,
c + (b + ap)p = c + bp + ap2
or
ap2 + bp + c. This is, in fact, what the remainder
theorem states, i.e.
‘if (ax2 + bx + c) is divided by (x −p),
the remainder will be ap2 + bp + c’
If, in the dividend (ax 2 + bx + c), we substitute p for x
we get the remainder ap2 + bp + c
For example,when (3x 2 −4x + 5) is dividedby (x −2)
the remainder is ap2 + bp + c (where a = 3, b = −4,
c = 5 and p = 2),
i.e. the remainder is
3(2)2 + (−4)(2) + 5 = 12 −8 + 5 = 9
We can check this by dividing(3x 2−4x + 5) by (x −2)
by long division:
3x + 2
——————–
x −2

3x2 −4x + 5
3x2 −6x
2x + 5
2x −4
———
9
———
Similarly, when (4x2 −7x + 9) is divided by (x +3),
the remainder is ap2 + bp + c (where a = 4, b = −7,
c = 9 and p = −3), i.e. the remainder is
4(−3)2 + (−7)(−3) + 9 = 36 + 21 + 9 = 66
Also, when (x2 + 3x −2) is divided by (x −1), the
remainder is 1(1)2 + 3(1) −2 = 2
It is not particularly useful, on its own, to know the
remainder of an algebraic division. However, if the
remainder should be zero then (x −p) is a factor. This
is very useful therefore when factorising expressions.
For example, when (2x 2 + x −3) is divided by (x −1),
theremainderis2(1)2 + 1(1) −3 = 0,whichmeansthat
(x −1) is a factor of (2x2 + x −3).
In this case the other factor is (2x + 3), i.e.
(2x2 + x −3) = (x −1)(2x −3)
The remainder theorem may also be stated for a cubic
equation as:
‘if (ax3 + bx2 + cx + d) is divided by
(x −p), the remainder will be
ap3 + bp2 + cp + d’
As before, the remainder may be obtained by substitut-
ing p for x in the dividend.
For example, when (3x 3 + 2x2 −x + 4) is divided
by (x −1), the remainder is ap3 + bp2 + cp + d
(where a = 3, b = 2, c = −1, d = 4 and p = 1),
i.e. the remainder is 3(1)3 + 2(1)2 + (−1)(1) + 4 =
3 + 2 −1 + 4 = 8
Similarly, when (x3 −7x −6) is divided by (x −3),
the remainder is 1(3)3 + 0(3)2 −7(3) −6 = 0, which
means that (x −3) is a factor of (x3 −7x −6)
Here are some more examples on the remainder
theorem.

By the remainder theorem, the remainder is given by

Use the remainder theorem to

By the remainder theorem, the remainder is given

d = −5 and p = −2
Hence the remainder is:

Problem 32.
Determine the remainder when
(x3 −2x2 −5x + 6) is divided by (a) (x −1) and

(a)
When (x3 −2x2 −5x + 6) is divided by (x −1),
the remainder is given by ap3 + bp2 + cp + d,
where a = 1, b = −2, c = −5, d = 6 and p = 1,
i.e. the remainder = (1)(1)3 + (−2)(1)2

= 1 −2 −5 + 6 = 0
Hence (x −1) is a factor of (x3 −2x2 −5x + 6).
(b)
When (x3 −2x2 −5x + 6) is divided by (x + 2),
the remainder is given by
(1)(−2)3 + (−2)(−2)2 + (−5)(−2) + 6

Hence (x + 2) is also a factor of (x3 −2x2 −

Then f (3) = 33 −2(3)2 −5(3) + 6

Hence (x −3) is a factor.
(iii)
Using the remainder theorem, when

is
divided
by
(x −3), the remainder is given by
ap3 + bp2 + cp + d,
where
a = 1,
b = −2, c = −5, d = 6 and p = 3
Hence the remainder is:
1(3)3 + (−2)(3)2 + (−5)(3) + 6

Hence (x −3) is a factor.

Chapter 2
Partial fractions
Why it is important to understand: Partial fractions
The algebraic technique of resolving a complicated fraction into partial fractions is often needed by
electrical and mechanical engineers for not only determining certain integrals in calculus, but for deter-
mining inverse Laplace transforms, and for analysing linear differential equations with resonant circuits
and feedback control systems.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand the term ‘partial fraction’
•
appreciate the conditions needed to resolve a fraction into partial fractions
•
resolve into partial fractions a fraction containing linear factors in the denominator
•
resolve into partial fractions a fraction containing repeated linear factors in the denominator
•
resolve into partial fractions a fraction containing quadratic factors in the denominator

Introduction to partial fractions

x + 1 = (x + 1) + 3(x −2)
(x −2)(x + 1)

4x −5
x2 −x −2
The reverse process of moving from
4x −5
x2 −x −2
to
1
x −2 +
3
x + 1 is called resolving into partial
fractions.
In order to resolve an algebraic expression into partial
fractions:
(i)
the denominator must factorise (in the above
example, x2 −x −2 factorises as (x −2) (x +1)),
and
(ii)
the numeratormust be at least one degreeless than
the denominator (in the above example (4x −5) is
of degree 1 since the highest powered x term is x 1
and (x2 −x −2) is of degree 2).
When the degree of the numerator is equal to or higher
than the degree of the denominator, the numerator must
be divided by the denominator until the remainder is of
less degree than the denominator (seeProblems 3and 4).
There are basically three types of partial fraction and the
form of partial fraction used is summarised in Table 2.1,
where f (x) is assumed to be of less degree than the
relevant denominator and A, B and C are constants to
be determined.
(InthelattertypeinTable2.1,ax 2+bx +c isaquadratic
expression which does not factorise without containing
surds or imaginary terms.)
Resolving an algebraic expression into partial fractions
is used as a preliminary to integrating certain functions
(see Chapter 44) and in determining inverse Laplace
transforms (see Chapter 69).

2.2 Worked problems on partial
fractions with linear factors
Problem 1.
Resolve
11 −3x
x2 + 2x −3 into partial
fractions.
The denominator factorises as (x −1) (x +3) and the
numerator is of less degree than the denominator. Thus
11 −3x
x2 + 2x −3 may be resolved into partial fractions.
Let
11 −3x
x2 + 2x −3 ≡
11 −3x
(x −1)(x + 3)
≡
A
(x −1) +
B
(x + 3)
where A and B are constants to be determined,
i.e.
11 −3x
(x −1)(x + 3) ≡A(x + 3) + B(x −1)
(x −1)(x + 3)
by algebraic addition.
Since the denominators are the same on each side of the
identity then the numerators are equal to each other.
Thus, 11−3x ≡A(x +3)+B(x −1)
To determine constants A and B, values of x are chosen
to make the term in A or B equal to zero.
When x =1, then
11−3(1) ≡A(1+3)+B(0)
i.e.
8 =4A
i.e.
A =2
When x = −3, then
11−3(−3) ≡A(0)+B(−3−1)
i.e.
20 =−4B

B =−5
Thus

Equating the numerators gives:

Let x = −1. Then

Let x = 1. Then 2 = −A

A = −2
Let x = 2. Then 5 = B

Equating the coefﬁcients of x 2 terms gives:

Logarithms
Why it is important to understand: Logarithms
All types of engineers use natural and common logarithms. Chemical engineers use them to measure
radioactive decay and pH solutions, both of which are measured on a logarithmic scale. The Richter
scale, which measures earthquake intensity, is a logarithmic scale. Biomedical engineers use logarithms
to measure cell decay and growth, and also to measure light intensity for bone mineral density measure-
ments. In electrical engineering, a dB (decibel) scale is very useful for expressing attenuations in radio
propagation and circuit gains, and logarithms are used for implementing arithmetic operations in digital
circuits. Logarithms are especially useful when dealing with the graphical analysis of non-linear relation-
ships and logarithmic scales are used to linearise data to make data analysis simpler. Understanding and
using logarithms is clearly important in all branches of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne base, power, exponent and index
•
deﬁne a logarithm
•
distinguish between common and Napierian (i.e. hyperbolic or natural) logarithms
•
evaluate logarithms to any base
•
state the laws of logarithms
•

•

Introduction to logarithms
With the use of calculators ﬁrmly established, logarith-
mic tables are no longer used for calculations. However,
the theory of logarithms is important, for there are sev-
eral scientiﬁc and engineering laws that involvethe rules
of logarithms.
From the laws of indices:
16 = 24
The number 4 is called the power or the exponent or
the index. In the expression 24, the number 2 is called
the base.
In another example:
64 = 82
In this example, 2 is the power, or exponent, or index.
The number 8 is the base.
What is a logarithm?
Consider the expression 16 = 24.
An alternative, yet equivalent, way of writing this
expression is: log2 16 = 4.
This is stated as ‘log to the base 2 of 16 equals 4’.
We see that the logarithm is the same as the power
or index in the original expression. It is the base in
the original expression which becomes the base of the
logarithm.

Section A
Logarithms
23
The two statements: 16=24
and log2 16=4 are
equivalent.
If we write either of them, we are automatically imply-
ing the other.
In general, if a number y can be written in the form
ax, then the index ‘x’ is called the ‘logarithm of y to the
base of a’,
i.e.
if y = ax
then x = loga y
In another example, if we write that 64 = 82 then the
equivalent statement using logarithms is:
log8 64 = 2
In another example, if we write that log3 81=4 then the
equivalent statement using powers is:
34 = 81
So the two sets of statements, one involving powers and
one involving logarithms, are equivalent.
Common logarithms
From above, if we write that 1000 = 103, then
3 = log10 1000
This may be checked using the ‘log’ button on your
calculator.
Logarithms having a base of 10 are called common
logarithms and log10 is often abbreviated to lg.
The following values may be checked by using a
calculator:
lg27.5 = 1.4393...,
lg378.1 = 2.5776...
and
lg0.0204 = −1.6903...
Napierian logarithms
Logarithms having a base of e (where ‘e’ is a math-
ematical constant approximately equal to 2.7183) are
called hyperbolic, Napierian or natural logarithms,
and loge is usually abbreviated to ln.
The following values may be checked by using a
calculator:
ln3.65 = 1.2947..., ln417.3 = 6.0338...
and
ln0.182 = −1.7037...
More on Napierianlogarithmsis explainedin Chapter4.
Here are some worked problems to help understanding
of logarithms.
Problem 1.
Evaluate log3 9
Let x = log3 9 then 3x = 9

Hence,
log3 9 = 2
Problem 2.

Let x = log10 10 then 10 x = 10
from the
deﬁnition of a logarithm,
i.e.
10x = 101

Hence,
log10 10 = 1
(which may be checked
using a calculator)
Problem 3.
Evaluate log16 8
Let x = log16 8 then 16x = 8
from the deﬁnition
of a logarithm,
i.e. (24)x = 23 i.e. 24x = 23
from the laws of indices,
from which,
4x = 3 and x = 3

Hence,
log16 8 = 3

Problem 4.
Evaluate lg 0.001
Let x = lg 0.001 = log10 0.001
then 10x = 0.001
i.e.
10x = 10−3
from which, x = −3
Hence,
lg 0.001 = −3 (which may be checked
using a calculator)
Problem 5.
Evaluate lne
Let x = lne = loge e then ex = e
i.e.
ex = e1

There are three laws of logarithms, which apply to any
base:
(i)
To multiply two numbers:
log(A × B) = log A + log B
The following may be checked by using a calcu-
lator:
lg10 = 1
Also, lg 5 + lg 2 = 0.69897...
+ 0.301029... = 1
Hence,
lg(5 × 2) = lg10 = lg 5 + lg 2

A graph of y = log10 x is shown in Fig. 3.1 and a graph
of y = loge x is shown in Fig. 3.2. Both are seen to be
of similar shape; in fact, the same general shape occurs
for a logarithm to any base.
In general, with a logarithm to any base a, it is noted
that:
(i)
loga1=0
Let loga =x, then ax =1 from the deﬁnition of
the logarithm.
If ax =1 then x =0 from the laws of indices.
Hence loga1=0. In the above graphs it is seen
that log101=0 and loge 1=0

Exponential functions
Why it is important to understand: Exponential functions
Exponential functions are used in engineering, physics, biology and economics. There are many quantities
that grow exponentially; some examples are population, compound interest and charge in a capacitor.

The power series for ex
The value of ex can be calculated to any required degree
of accuracy since it is deﬁned in terms of the following
power series:
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + x4
4! + ···
(1)
(where 3! =3×2×1 and is called ‘factorial 3’)
The series is valid for all values of x.
The series is said to converge, i.e. if all the terms are
added, an actual value for ex (where x is a real number)
is obtained. The more terms that are taken, the closer
will be the value of ex to its actual value. The value of
the exponent e, correct to, say, 4 decimal places, may be
determined by substituting x =1 in the power series of
equation (1). Thus,
e1 =1 + 1 + (1)2
2! + (1)3
3! + (1)4
4! + (1)5
5!
+ (1)6
6! + (1)7
7! + (1)8
8! + ···
=1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.16667 + 0.04167
+0.00833 + 0.00139 + 0.00020
+0.00002+ ···
i.e.
e =2.71828 = 2.7183,
correct to 4 decimal places.

Section A

The value of e0.05, correct to, say, 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures,
is found by substituting x =0.05 in the power series for
ex. Thus
e0.05 = 1 + 0.05 + (0.05)2
2!
+ (0.05)3
3!
+ (0.05)4
4!
+ (0.05)5
5!
+ ···
= 1 + 0.05 + 0.00125 + 0.000020833
+ 0.000000260+ 0.000000003
and by adding,
e0.05 = 1.0512711, correct to 8 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
In this example, successive terms in the series grow
smaller very rapidly and it is relatively easy to deter-
mine the value of e0.05 to a high degree of accuracy.
However, when x is nearer to unity or larger than unity,
a very large number of terms are required for an accurate
result.
If in the series of equation (1), x is replaced by −x, then,
e−x =1 + (−x) + (−x)2
2!
+ (−x)3
3!
+ ···
i.e. e−x =1 −x + x2
2! −x3
3! + ···
In a similar manner the power series for ex may be used
to evaluate any exponential function of the form a e kx,
where a and k are constants. In the series of equation (1),
let x be replaced by kx. Then,
a ekx =a

1 + (kx) + (kx)2
2!
+ (kx)3
3!

Thus 5e2x =5

to 5 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, by using the power series

logarithm of x is written as loge x, or more commonly
as lnx. Logarithms were invented by John Napier∗, a

4.6 Reduction of exponential laws
to linear form
Frequently, the relationship between two variables, say
x and y, is not a linear one, i.e. when x is plotted against
y a curve results. In such cases the non-linear equation
may be modiﬁed to the linear form, y =mx +c, so that
the constants, and thus the law relating the variables can
be determined. This technique is called ‘determination
of law’.
Graph paper is available where the scale markings
along the horizontal and vertical axes are proportional
to the logarithms of the numbers. Such graph paper is
called log-log graph paper.
A logarithmic scale is shown in Fig. 4.7 where the dis-
tance between, say, 1 and 2, is proportional tolg2−lg1,
i.e. 0.3010 of the total distance from 1 to 10. Simi-
larly, the distance between 7 and 8 is proportional to
lg 8−lg7, i.e. 0.05799 of the total distance from 1 to
10. Thus the distance between markings progressively
decreases as the numbers increase from 1 to 10.

3

6 7 8 910
Figure 4.7
With log-log graph paper the scale markings are from
1 to 9, and this pattern can be repeated several times. The
number of times the pattern of markings is repeated on
an axis signiﬁes the numberof cycles. When the vertical
axis has, say, three sets of values from 1 to 9, and the
horizontal axis has, say, two sets of values from 1 to 9,
then this log-log graph paper is called ‘log 3 cycle × 2
cycle’. Many different arrangements are available rang-
ing from ‘log1 cycle × 1 cycle’ through to ‘log 5
cycle × 5 cycle’.
To depict a set of values, say, from 0.4 to 161, on an axis
of log-log graph paper, four cycles are required, from
0.1 to 1, 1 to 10, 10 to 100 and 100 to 1000.
Graphs of the form y =a ekx
Taking logarithms to a base ofeofboth sides ofy=a ekx
gives:
lny =ln(a ekx) = lna + lnekx = lna + kx lne
i.e. lny =kx + lna
(since lne = 1)
which compares with Y =mX+c
Thus, by plotting ln y vertically against x horizon-
tally, a straight line results, i.e. the equation y =a ekx is
reduced to linear form. In this case, graph paper hav-
ing a linear horizontal scale and a logarithmic vertical
scale may be used. This type of graph paper is called
log-linear graph paper, and is speciﬁed by the number
of cycles on the logarithmic scale.
Problem 21.

be related by a law of the form y =a ekx, where a
and b are constants. Verify that the law is true and

a =18
The law of the graph is thus y =18e0.55x

Chapter 5
Inequalities
Why it is important to understand: Inequalities
In mathematics, an inequality is a relation that holds between two values when they are different. A work-
ing knowledge of inequalities can be beneﬁcial to the practising engineer, and inequalities are central to
the deﬁnitions of all limiting processes, including differentiation and integration. When exact solutions are
unavailable, inconvenient, or unnecessary, inequalities can be used to obtain error bounds for numerical
approximation. Understanding and using inequalities is important in many branches of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne an inequality
•
state simple rules for inequalities
•
solve simple inequalities
•
solve inequalities involving a modulus
•
solve inequalities involving quotients
•
solve inequalities involving square functions
•
solve quadratic inequalities
5.1
Introduction to inequalities
An inequality is any expression involving one of the
symbols <, >, ≤or ≥
p < q means p is less than q
p > q means p is greater than q
p ≤q means p is less than or equal to q
p ≥q means p is greater than or equal to q
Some simple rules
(i)
When a quantity is added or subtracted to both
sides of an inequality, the inequality still remains.
For example, if p < 3
then p + 2 < 3 + 2 (adding 2 to both
sides)
and p −2 < 3 −2 (subtracting 2 from both
sides)
(ii)
When multiplying or dividing both sides of
an inequality by a positive quantity, say 5, the
inequality remains the same. For example,
if p > 4 then 5p > 20 and
p
5 > 4
5
(iii)
When multiplying or dividing both sides of an
inequality by a negative quantity, say −3, the
inequality is reversed. For example,
if p > 1 then −3p < −3 and
p
−3 < 1
−3
(Note > has changed to < in each example.)
To solve an inequality means ﬁnding all the values of
the variable for which the inequality is true.

(a)
Subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality:
3 + x > 7 gives:
3 + x −3 > 7 −3, i.e. x > 4
Hence, all values of x greater than 4 satisfy the
inequality.
(b)
Dividing both sides of the inequality: 3t < 6 by 3
gives:
3t
3 < 6
3, i.e. t < 2
Hence, all values of t less than 2 satisfy the
inequality.
(c)
Adding 2 to both sides of the inequality z −2 ≥5
gives:
z −2 + 2 ≥5 + 2, i.e. z ≥7
Hence, all values of z greater than or equal to 7
satisfy the inequality.
(d)
Multiplying both sides of the inequality p
3 ≤2 by
3 gives:
(3)p
3 ≤(3)2, i.e. p ≤6
Hence, all values of p less than or equal to 6 satisfy
the inequality.
Problem 2.
Solve the inequality: 4x + 1 > x + 5
Subtracting 1 from both sides of the inequality:
4x + 1 > x + 5 gives:
4x > x + 4
Subtracting x from both sides of the inequality:
4x > x + 4 gives:
3x > 4
Dividing both sides of the inequality: 3x > 4 by 3 gives:
x > 4
3
Hence all values of x greater than 4
3 satisfy the
inequality:
4x + 1 > x + 5
Problem 3.
Solve the inequality: 3 −4t ≤8 + t
Subtracting 3 from both sides of the inequality:
3 −4t ≤8 + t gives:
−4t ≤5 + t
Subtracting t from both sides of the inequality:
−4t ≤5 + t gives:
−5t ≤5
Dividing both sides of the inequality −5t ≤5 by −5
gives:
t ≥−1 (remembering to reverse the inequality)
Hence, all values of t greater than or equal to −1 satisfy
the inequality.

Inequalities involving a modulus
The modulus of a number is the size of the number,
regardless of sign. Vertical lines enclosing the number
denote a modulus.

Section A
Inequalities
45
For example, |4| = 4 and | −4| = 4 (the modulus of a
number is never negative),
The inequality: |t| < 1 means that all numbers whose
actual size, regardless of sign, is less than 1, i.e. any
value between −1 and +1
Thus |t | < 1 means −1 < t < 1
Similarly, |x| > 3 means all numbers whose actual size,
regardlessof sign, is greaterthan 3, i.e. any valuegreater
than 3 and any value less than −3
Thus |x | > 3 means x > 3 and x < −3
Inequalities involving a modulus are demonstrated in
the following worked problems.
Problem 4.
Solve the following inequality:
|3x + 1| < 4
Since |3x + 1| < 4 then −4 < 3x + 1 < 4
Now −4 < 3x + 1 becomes −5 < 3x,
i.e. −5
3 < x and 3x + 1 < 4 becomes 3x < 3,
i.e. x < 1
Hence, these two results together become −5
3 < x < 1
and mean that the inequality |3x + 1| < 4 is satisﬁed for
any value of x greater than −5
3 but less than 1
Problem 5.
Solve the inequality: |1 + 2t| ≤5
Since |1 + 2t| ≤5 then −5 ≤1 + 2t ≤5
Now −5 ≤1 + 2t becomes −6 ≤2t, i.e. −3 ≤t
and 1 + 2t ≤5 becomes 2t ≤4 i.e. t ≤2
Hence, these two results together become: −3 ≤t ≤2
Problem 6.
Solve the inequality: |3z −4| > 2
|3z −4| > 2 means 3z −4 > 2 and 3z −4 < −2,
i.e. 3z > 6 and 3z < 2,
i.e. the inequality: |3z −4| > 2 is satisﬁed when
z > 2 and z < 2

3t −6 > 0 then t + 1
3t −6 must be positive.
For t + 1

or (ii) t + 1 < 0 and 3t −6 < 0

3t > 6 and t > 2

Both of the inequalities t > −1 and t > 2 are only
true when t > 2,
i.e. the fraction t + 1
3t −6 is positive when t > 2
(ii)
If t + 1 < 0 then t < −1 and if 3t −6 < 0 then
3t < 6 and t < 2
Both of the inequalities t < −1 and t < 2 are only
true when t < −1,
i.e. the fraction t + 1
3t −6 is positive when t < −1
Summarising, t + 1
3t −6 > 0 when t > 2 or t < −1
Problem 8.
Solve the inequality: 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1
Since 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1 then 2x + 3
x + 2 −1 ≤0
i.e. 2x + 3
x + 2 −x + 2
x + 2 ≤0,
i.e. 2x + 3 −(x + 2)
x + 2
≤0 or x + 1
x + 2 ≤0
For x + 1
x + 2 to be negative or zero,
either (i) x + 1 ≤0
and x + 2 > 0
or (ii) x + 1 ≥0 and x + 2 < 0
(i)
If x + 1 ≤0 then x ≤−1 and if x + 2 > 0 then
x > −2
(Note that > is used for the denominator, not ≥;
a zero denominator gives a value for the fraction
which is impossible to evaluate.)
Hence, the inequality x + 1
x + 2 ≤0 is true when x
is greater than −2 and less than or equal to −1,
which may be written as −2 < x ≤−1
(ii)
If x + 1 ≥0 then x ≥−1 and if x + 2 < 0 then
x < −2
It is not possible to satisfy both x ≥−1 and x <
−2 thus no values of x satisﬁes (ii).
Summarising, 2x + 3
x + 2 ≤1 when −2 < x ≤−1

Since t2 > 9 then t2 −9 > 0, i.e. (t + 3)(t −3) > 0 by

For (t + 3)(t −3) to be positive,
either (i) (t + 3) > 0

or (ii) (t + 3) < 0 and (t −3) < 0

z > 1

z < −2
Problem 12.
Solve the inequality: t 2 < 9
Since t2 < 9 then t2 −9 < 0, i.e. (t + 3)(t −3) < 0 by
factorising. For (t + 3)(t −3) to be negative,
either (i) (t + 3) > 0
and (t −3) < 0
or (ii) (t + 3) < 0 and (t −3) > 0
(i)
If (t + 3) > 0 then t > −3 and if (t −3) < 0 then
t < 3
Hence (i) is satisﬁed when t > −3 and t < 3 which
may be written as: −3 < t < 3
(ii)
If (t + 3) < 0 then t < −3 and if (t −3) > 0 then
t > 3
It is not possible to satisfy both t < −3 and t > 3,
thus no values of t satisﬁes (ii).
Summarising, t2 < 9 when −3 < t < 3 which means
that all values of t between −3 and +3 will satisfy the
inequality.

Quadratic inequalities
Inequalities involving quadratic expressions are solved
using either factorisation or ‘completing the square’.
For example,
x2 −2x −3 is factorised as (x + 1)(x −3)
and 6x2 + 7x −5 is factorised as (2x −1)(3x + 5)
If a quadratic expression does not factorise, then the
technique of ‘completing the square’ is used. In general,
the procedure for x 2 + bx + c is:
x2 + bx + c ≡

x + b

Similarly,

Solving quadratic inequalities is demonstrated in the
following worked problems.
Problem 15.
Solve the inequality:
x2 + 2x −3 > 0
Since x2 + 2x −3 > 0 then (x −1)(x + 3) > 0 by fac-
torising. For the product (x −1)(x + 3) to be positive,
either (i) (x −1) > 0
and (x + 3) > 0
or (ii) (x −1) < 0 and (x + 3) < 0
(i)
Since (x −1) > 0 then x > 1 and since (x + 3) >
0 then x > −3
Both of these inequalities are satisﬁed only when
x > 1
(ii)
Since (x −1) < 0 then x < 1 and since (x + 3) <
0 then x < −3
Both of these inequalities are satisﬁed only when
x < −3
Summarising, x2 + 2x −3 > 0 is satisﬁed when either
x > 1 or x < −3
Problem 16.
Solve the inequality:
t2 −2t −8 < 0
Since
t2 −2t −8 < 0
then
(t −4)(t + 2) < 0
by
factorising.
For the product (t −4)(t + 2) to be negative,
either (i) (t −4) > 0
and (t + 2) < 0
or (ii) (t −4) < 0 and (t + 2) > 0
(i)
Since (t −4) > 0 then t > 4 and since (t + 2) < 0
then t < −2
It is not possible to satisfy both t > 4 and t < −2,
thus no values of t satisﬁes the inequality (i)
(ii)
Since (t −4) < 0 then t < 4 and since (t + 2) > 0
then t > −2
Hence, (ii) is satisﬁed when −2 < t < 4
Summarising, t2 −2t −8 < 0 is satisﬁed when
−2 < t < 4
Problem 17.
Solve the inequality:
x2 + 6x + 3 < 0
x2 + 6x + 3 does not factorise; completing the square
gives:
x2 + 6x + 3 ≡(x + 3)2 + 3 −32
≡(x + 3)2 −6
The inequality thus becomes: (x + 3)2 −6 < 0 or

From equation (2), −

6 < (x + 3) <

from which, (−

y2 −8y −10 ≥0
y2 −8y −10 does not factorise; completing the square

Arithmetic and geometric
progressions
Why it is important to understand: Arithmetic and geometric progressions
Number sequences are widely used in engineering applications, including computer data structure and
sorting algorithms, ﬁnancial engineering, audio compression, and architectural engineering. Thanks to
engineers, robots have migrated from factory shop ﬂoors as industrial manipulators, to outer space as
interplanetary explorers, hospitals as minimally invasive surgical assistants, homes as vacuum cleaners
and lawn mowers, and battleﬁelds as unmanned air, underwater, and ground vehicles. Arithmetic pro-
gressions are used in simulation engineering and in the reproductive cycle of bacteria. Some uses of APs
in daily life include uniform increase in speed at regular intervals, completing patterns of objects, calcu-
lating simple interest, speed of an aircraft, increase or decrease in the costs of goods, sales and production,
and so on. GPs are used in compound interest and the range of speeds on a drilling machine. In fact, GPs
are used throughout mathematics, and they have many important applications in physics, engineering,
biology, economics, computer science, queuing theory, and ﬁnance.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
calculate the nth term of an AP
•
calculate the sum of n terms of an AP
•
calculate the nth term of a GP
•
calculate the sum of n terms of a GP
•
calculate the sum to inﬁnity of a GP
6.1
Arithmetic progressions
When a sequence has a constant difference between
successive terms it is called an arithmetic progression
(often abbreviated to AP).
Examples include:
(i)
1, 4, 7, 10, 13,...where the common difference
is 3 and
(ii)
a, a +d, a +2d, a +3d,... where the common
difference is d.
General expression for the nth term of an AP
If the ﬁrst term of an AP is ‘a’ and the common
difference is ‘d’ then
the nth term is: a + (n −1)d
In example (i) above, the seventh term is given by
1+ (7−1)3=19, which may be readily checked.

Sum of n terms of an AP
The sum S of an AP can be obtained by multiplying the
average of all the terms by the number of terms.
The average of all the terms= a +l

, where a is the ﬁrst
term and l is the last term, i.e. l =a + (n−1)d, for n
terms.
Hence the sum of n terms,

a + l

i.e.
Sn = n

For example, the sum oftheﬁrst seventerms of the series
1, 4, 7, 10, 13,... is given by
S7 = 7
2[2(1) + (7 −1)3], since a = 1 and d = 3
= 7
2[2 + 18] = 7
2[20] = 70
6.2 Worked problems on arithmetic
progressions
Problem 1.
Determine (a) the ninth and (b) the
sixteenth term of the series 2, 7, 12, 17, ...
2, 7, 12, 17,... is an arithmetic progression with a
common difference, d, of 5
(a)
The nth term of an AP is given by a +(n−1)d
Since the ﬁrst term a =2, d =5 and n=9 then the
ninth term is:
2+(9−1)5=2+(8)(5) = 2+40=42
(b)
The sixteenth term is:
2+(16−1)5=2+(15)(5)= 2+75=77
Problem 2.
The sixth term of an AP is 17 and the
thirteenth term is 38. Determine the nineteenth
term.
The nth term of an AP is a +(n−1)d
The sixth term is:
a + 5d = 17
(1)
The nineteenth term is:
a + 12d= 38
(2)
Equation (2)−equation (1) gives: 7d =21, from which,
d = 21
7 =3
Substituting in equation (1) gives: a +15=17, from
which, a =2
Hence the nineteenth term is:
a + (n −1)d = 2 + (19 −1)3 = 2 + (18)(3)
= 2 + 54 = 56

Problem 6.
The sum of seven terms of an AP is
35 and the common difference is 1.2. Determine the
ﬁrst term of the series.
n=7, d =1.2 and S7 =35
Since the sum of n terms of an AP is given by
Sn = n
2[2a + (n −1)d], then
35 = 7
2[2a + (7 −1)1.2] = 7
2[2a + 7.2]
Hence
35 × 2

= 2a + 7.2
10 = 2a + 7.2

Three numbers are in arithmetic
progression. Their sum is 15 and their product is 80.
Determine the three numbers.
Let the three numbers be (a −d), a and (a +d)
Then (a −d)+a +(a +d)=15, i.e. 3a =15, from
which, a =5
Also, a(a −d)(a +d)=80, i.e. a(a2−d2)=80
Since a = 5,5(52 −d2) = 80
125 −5d2 = 80
125 −80 = 5d2
45 = 5d2
from which, d2 = 45

Geometric progressions
When a sequence has a constant ratio between succes-
sive terms it is called a geometric progression (often
abbreviated to GP). The constant is called the common
ratio, r.

Section A
54
Higher Engineering Mathematics
Examples include
(i)
1,2,4,8,... where the common ratio is 2 and
(ii)
a,ar,ar2,ar3,... where the common ratio is r.
General expression for the nth term of a GP
If the ﬁrst term of a GP is a and the common ratio is r,
then
the nth term is: arn−1
which can be readily checked from the above examples.
For example, the eighth term of the GP 1, 2, 4, 8,... is
(1)(2)7=128, since a =1 and r =2
Sum of n terms of a GP
Let a GP be a, ar, ar2, ar3,..., arn−1
then the sum of n terms,
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + ··· + arn−1···
(1)
Multiplying throughout by r gives:
rSn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + ar4
+ ··· + arn−1 + arn + ···
(2)
Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) gives:
Sn −rSn = a −arn
i.e. Sn(1 −r) = a(1 −rn)
Thus the sum of n terms, Sn = a(1−rn)
(1 −r ) , which is valid
when r <1
Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gives
Sn = a(rn −1)
(r −1)
which is valid when r > 1
For example, the sum of the ﬁrst eight terms of the GP
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... is given by S8 = 1(28−1)
(2−1) , since a =1
and r =2
i.e. S8 = 1(256 −1)
1
= 255
Sum to inﬁnity of a GP
When the common ratio r of a GP is less than unity, the
sum of n terms, Sn = a(1−rn)
(1−r) , which may be written
as Sn =
a
(1−r) −
arn
(1−r)
Since r <1, rn becomes less as n increases, i.e. rn →0
as n→∞
Hence
arn
(1−r) →0 as n→∞. Thus Sn →
a
(1−r) as
n→∞
The quantity
a
(1−r) is called the sum to inﬁnity, S∞,
and is the limiting value of the sum of an inﬁnite number
of terms,
i.e. S∞=
a
(1 −r) which is valid when −1<r <1
Convergence means that the values of the terms must
get progressively smaller and the sum of the terms must
reach a limiting value.
For example, the function y = 1
x converges to zero as x
increases.
Similarly, the series 1 + 1
2 + 1
4 + 1
8 + ... is convergent
since the value of the terms is getting smaller and the
sum of the terms is approaching a limiting value of 2,
i.e. the sum to inﬁnity, S∞=

The net gain forms a series:

If £100 is invested at compound
interest of 8% per annum, determine (a) the value
after ten years, (b) the time, correct to the nearest
year, it takes to reach more than £300.
(a)
Let the GP be a, ar, ar2,..., arn
The ﬁrst term a = £100
The common ratio r = 1.08
Hence the second term is
ar = (100)(1.08) = £108,
which is the value after oneyear,
the third term is
ar2 = (100)(1.08)2 = £116.64,
which is the value after twoyears, and so on.
Thus the value after tenyears
= ar10 = (100)(1.08)10 = £215.89
(b)
When £300 has been reached, 300=ar n
i.e.
300 = 100(1.08)n
and
3 = (1.08)n
Taking logarithms to base 10 of both sides gives:
lg3 = lg(1.08)n = nlg(1.08),

The sixth term is given by ar 6−1, which is 750rev/min,
i.e.
ar5 = 750
from which r5 = 750
a

50 = 15
Thus the common ratio, r =

15=1.7188
The ﬁrst term is a =50rev/min
the second term is ar =(50) (1.7188)=85.94,
the third term is ar2 =(50) (1.7188)2=147.71,
the fourth term is ar 3=(50) (1.7188)3=253.89,
the ﬁfth term is ar4=(50) (1.7188)4=436.39,

Chapter 7
The binomial series
Why it is important to understand: The binomial series
There are many applications of the binomial theorem in every part of algebra, and in general with
permutations, combinations and probability. It is also used in atomic physics, where it is used to count
s, p, d and f orbitals. There are applications of the binomial series in ﬁnancial mathematics to determine
the number of stock price paths that leads to a particular stock price at maturity.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a binomial expression
•
use Pascal’s triangle to expand a binomial expression
•
state the general binomial expansion of (a + x)n and (1 + x)n
•
use the binomial series to expand expressions of the form (a + x)n for positive, negative and fractional values
of n
•
determine the rth term of a binomial expansion
•
use the binomial expansion with practical applications
7.1
Pascal’s triangle
A binomial expression is one which contains two
terms connected by a plus or minus sign. Thus (p+q),
(a + x)2, (2x + y)3 are examples of binomial expres-
sions. Expanding (a + x)n for integer values of n
from 0 to 6 gives the results as shown at the top of
page 59.
From these results the following patterns emerge:
(i)
‘a’ decreases in power moving from left to right.
(ii)
‘x’ increases in power moving from left to right.
(iii)
Thecoefﬁcientsofeachtermoftheexpansionsare
symmetrical about the middle coefﬁcient when n
is even and symmetrical about the two middle
coefﬁcients when n is odd.

The coefﬁcients are shown separately in Table 7.1

by adding the two adjacent coefﬁcients immedi-

Pascal’s triangle method is used for expansions of
the form (a + x)n for integer values of n less than
about 8.
∗Who was Pascal? Blaise Pascal (19 June 1623–19 August
1662) was a French polymath. A child prodigy, he wrote a
signiﬁcant treatise on the subject of projective geometry at
the age of 16, and later corresponded with Pierre de Fermat
on probability theory, strongly inﬂuencing the development of
modern economics and social science. To ﬁnd out more go to

a7 and x7, respectively. The powers of a decrease and
the powers of x increase moving from left to right.
Hence
(a + x)7 = a7 + 7a6x + 21a5x2 + 35a4x3

Problem 2.
Determine, using Pascal’s triangle
method, the expansion of (2p −3q)5
Comparing (2p −3q)5 with (a + x)5 shows that
a = 2p and x = −3q
Using Pascal’s triangle method:
(a + x)5 = a5 + 5a4x + 10a3x2 + 10a2x3 + ···

Hence
(2p −3q)5 = (2p)5 + 5(2p)4(−3q)

The binomial series
The binomial series or binomial theorem is a formula
for raising a binomial expression to any power without
lengthy multiplication. The general binomial expansion
of (a + x)n is given by:
(a + x)n = an + nan−1x + n(n −1)
2!
an−2x2
+ n(n −1)(n −2)
3!
an−3x3
+ ···
where 3! denotes 3×2×1 and is termed ‘factorial 3’.
With the binomial theorem, n may be a fraction, a
decimal fraction, or a positive or negative integer.
When n is a positive integer, the series is ﬁnite, i.e.,
it comes to an end; when n is a negative integer, or a
fraction, the series is inﬁnite.
In the general expansion of (a +x)n it is noted that the
fourth term is: n(n−1)(n−2)
3!
an−3x3. The number 3 is
very evident in this expression.
For any term in a binomial expansion, say the rth
term, (r −1) is very evident. It may therefore be rea-
soned that the rth term of the expansion (a +x)n is:
n(n−1)(n−2)... to (r −1) terms
(r −1)!
an−(r−1)xr−1
If a =1 in the binomial expansion of (a +x)n then:
(1+x)n =1+nx + n(n−1)
2!
x2
+ n(n−1)(n−2)
3!
x3+···
which is valid for −1<x <1
When x is small compared with 1 then:
(1 + x)n ≈1 + nx

Problem 17.
The radius of a cylinder is reduced
by 4% and its height is increased by 2%. Determine
the approximate percentage change in (a) its
volume and (b) its curved surface area, (neglecting
the products of small quantities).
Volume of cylinder=πr 2h.
Let r and h be the original values of radius and
height.
The new values are 0.96r or (1 −0.04)r and 1.02h or
(1+0.02)h.
(a) New volume=π[(1 −0.04)r]2[(1 + 0.02)h]
=πr2h(1 −0.04)2(1 + 0.02)
Now (1−0.04)2=1−2(0.04)+(0.04)2
=(1−0.08),
neglectingpowersofsmallterms.
Hence new volume
≈πr2h(1 −0.08)(1 + 0.02)
≈πr2h(1 −0.08 + 0.02), neglecting
products of small terms
≈πr2h(1 −0.06) or 0.94πr 2h, i.e. 94%
of the original volume
Hence the volume is reduced by approxi-
mately 6%
(b)
Curved surface area of cylinder=2πrh.
New surface area
= 2π[(1 −0.04)r][(1 + 0.02)h]
= 2πrh(1 −0.04)(1 + 0.02)
≈2πrh(1 −0.04+ 0.02), neglecting
products of small terms
≈2πrh(1 −0.02) or 0.98(2πrh),
i.e. 98% of the original surface area
Hence the curved surface area is reduced by
approximately 2%
Problem 18.

respectively.

of I is 2% too small.
Let f , k and I be the true values of frequency, stiffness
and inertia respectively. Since the measured value of
stiffness, k1, is 4% too large, then
k1 = 104
100k = (1 + 0.04)k
The measured value of inertia,I1, is 2% too small, hence
I1 = 98

Maclaurin’s series
Why it is important to understand: Maclaurin’s series
One of the simplest kinds of function to deal with, in either algebra or calculus, is a polynomial (i.e. an
expression of the form a+bx+cx2 +dx3 + ...). Polynomials are easy to substitute numerical values into,
and they are easy to differentiate. One useful application of Maclaurin’s series is to approximate, to a
polynomial, functions which are not already in polynomial form. In the simple theory of ﬂexure of beams,
the slope, bending moment, shearing force, load and other quantities are functions of a derivative of y
with respect to x. The elastic curve of a transversely loaded beam can be represented by the Maclaurin
series. Substitution of the values of the derivatives gives a direct solution of beam problems. Another
application of Maclaurin series is in relating inter-atomic potential functions. At this stage, not all of the
above applications would have been met or understood; however, sufﬁcient to say that Maclaurin’s series
has a number of applications in engineering and science.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine simple derivatives
•
derive Maclaurin’s theorem
•
appreciate the conditions of Maclaurin’s series
•
use Maclaurin’s series to determine the power series for simple trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential
functions
•
evaluate a deﬁnite integral using Maclaurin’s series
•
state L’Hôpital’s rule
•
determine limiting values of functions

Introduction
Some mathematical functions may be represented as
power series, containing terms in ascending powers of
the variable. For example,
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + ···
sinx = x −x3
3! + x5
5! −x7
7! + ···
andcoshx = 1 + x2
2! + x4
4! + ···
(as shown in Chapter 16)
Using a series, called Maclaurin’s∗series, mixed
functions containing, say, algebraic, trigonometric and
exponential functions, may be expressed solely as
∗Who was Maclaurin? Colin Maclaurin (February 1698–
14 June 1746) was a Scottish mathematician who made impor-
tant contributions to geometry and algebra. The Maclau-
rin series are named after him. To ﬁnd out more go to

algebraic functions, and differentiation and integration
can often be more readily performed.
To expand a function using Maclaurin’s theorem,
some knowledge of differentiation is needed (more on
differentiationis given in Chapter 29). Here is a revision
of derivatives of the main functions needed in this
chapter.

Given a general function f (x), then f ′(x) is the
ﬁrst derivative, f ′′(x) is the second derivative, and so
on. Also, f (0) means the value of the function when
x = 0, f ′(0) means the value of the ﬁrst derivative when
x = 0, and so on.
8.2 Derivation of Maclaurin’s
theorem
Let the power series for f (x) be
f (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + a4x4
+ a5x5 + ···
(1)
where a0,a1,a2,... are constants.
When x =0, f(0) = a0
Differentiating equation (1) with respect to x gives:
f ′(x) = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + 4a4x3
+ 5a5x4 + ···
(2)
When x =0, f ′(0) = a1
Differentiating equation (2) with respect to x gives:
f ′′(x) = 2a2 + (3)(2)a3x + (4)(3)a4x2
+ (5)(4)a5x3 + ··· (3)
When x =0, f ′′(0)=2a2 =2!a2, i.e. a2 = f ′′(0)
2!

Section A

Higher Engineering Mathematics
Differentiating equation (3) with respect to x gives:
f ′′′(x) = (3)(2)a3 + (4)(3)(2)a4x
+ (5)(4)(3)a5x2 + ···
(4)
When x =0, f ′′′(0)=(3)(2)a3=3!a3, i.e. a3 = f ′′′(0)
3!
Continuing the same procedure gives a4 = f iv(0)
4!
,
a5 = f v(0)
5! , and so on.
Substituting for a0,a1,a2,... in equation (1) gives:
f (x) = f (0) + f ′(0)x + f ′′(0)
2!
x2
+ f ′′′(0)
3!
x3 + ···
i.e. f(x) = f(0) + xf ′(0) + x2
2! f ′′(0)
+ x3
3! f ′′′(0) + ···
(5)
Equation (5) is a mathematical statement called
Maclaurin’s theorem or Maclaurin’s series.
8.3
Conditions of Maclaurin’s series
Maclaurin’s series may be used to represent any func-
tion, say f (x), as a power series provided that at
x =0 the following three conditions are met:
(a)
f(0) ̸= ∞
For example, for the function f (x)= cosx,
f (0)= cos0=1, thus cosx meets the condi-
tion. However, if f (x)= lnx, f (0)= ln 0=−∞,
thus lnx does not meet this condition.
(b)
f ′(0), f ′′(0), f ′′′(0), ... ̸= ∞
For example, for the function f (x)= cosx,
f ′(0)=−sin0=0, f ′′(0)=−cos0=−1, and so
on; thus cosx meets this condition. However, if
f (x)= lnx, f ′(0)= 1
0 =∞, thus lnx does not
meet this condition
(c)
The resultant Maclaurin’s series must be
convergent.
In general, this means that the values of the terms,
or groups of terms, must get progressively smaller
and the sum of the terms must reach a limiting
value.
For example, the series 1+ 1
2 + 1
4 + 1
8 + ··· is con-
vergent since the value of the terms is getting
smaller and the sum of the terms is approaching a
limiting value of 2.
8.4 Worked problems on Maclaurin’s
series
Problem 1.
Determine the ﬁrst four terms of the
power series for cosx
The values of f (0), f ′(0), f ′′(0), ... in Maclaurin’s
series are obtained as follows:
f (x)= cosx
f (0)= cos0=1
f ′(x)= −sinx
f ′(0)= −sin0=0
f ′′(x)= −cosx
f ′′(0)= −cos0=−1
f ′′′(x)= sinx
f ′′′(0)= sin0=0
f iv(x)= cosx
f iv(0)= cos0=1
f v(x)= −sinx
f v(0)= −sin0=0
f vi(x)= −cosx
f vi(0)= −cos0=−1
Substituting these values into equation (5) gives:

product rule,
= 2sec4 x + 4sec2 x tan2 x
f ′′′(0) = 2sec4 0 + 4sec2 0tan2 0 = 2
Substituting these values into equation (5) gives:

Maclaurin’s series
The value of many integrals cannot be determined using
the various analytical methods. In Chapter 49, the trape-
zoidal, mid-ordinate and Simpson’s rules are used to
numerically evaluate such integrals. Another method of
ﬁnding the approximate value of a deﬁnite integral is
to express the function as a power series using Maclau-
rin’s series, and then integrating each algebraic term
in turn. This is demonstrated in the following worked
problems.

L’Hôpital’s∗rule will enable us to determine such lim-

Chapter 9
Solving equations by
iterative methods
Why it is important to understand: Solving equations by iterative methods
There are many, many different types of equations used in every branch of engineering and science. There
are straightforward methods for solving simple, quadratic and simultaneous equations; however, there
are many other types of equations than these three. Great progress has been made in the engineering
and scientiﬁc disciplines regarding the use of iterative methods for linear systems. In engineering it is
important that we can solve any equation; iterative methods, such as the bisection method, an algebraic
method of successive approximations, and the Newton-Raphson method, help us do that.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne iterative methods
•
use the method of bisection to solve equations
•
use an algebraic method of successive approximations to solve equations
•
state the Newton–Raphson formula
•
use Newton’s method to solve equations
9.1
Introduction to iterative methods
Many equations can only be solved graphically or by
methods of successive approximations to the roots,
called iterative methods. Three methods of succes-
siveapproximationsare(i)bisectionmethod,introduced
in Section 9.2, (ii) an algebraic method, introduced in
Section 9.3, and (iii) by using the Newton–Raphson
formula, given in Section 9.4.
Each successive approximation method relies on
a reasonably good ﬁrst estimate of the value of a
root being made. One way of determining this is to
sketch a graph of the function, say y=f (x), and deter-
mine the approximate values of roots from the points
where the graph cuts the x-axis. Another way is by
using a functional notation method. This method uses
the property that the value of the graph of f (x)=0
changes sign for values of x just before and just
after the value of a root. For example, one root of
the equation x2 −x −6=0 is x=3. Using functional
notation:
f (x) = x2 −x −6
f (2) = 22 −2 −6 = −4
f (4) = 42 −4 −6 = +6
It can be seen from these results that the value of f (x)
changes from −4 at f (2) to +6 at f (4), indicating that

The bisection method
As shown above, by using functional notation it is pos-
sible to determine the vicinity of a root of an equation by
the occurrence of a change of sign, i.e. if x1 and x2 are
such that f (x1) and f (x2) have opposite signs, there is
at least one root of the equation f (x)=0 in the interval
between x1 and x2 (provided f (x) is a continuous func-
tion). In the method of bisection the mid-point of the
interval, i.e. x3 = x1 + x2
2
, is taken, and from the sign
of f (x3) it can be deduced whether a root lies in the
half interval to the left or right of x3. Whichever half
interval is indicated, its mid-point is then taken and the
procedure repeated. The method often requires many
iterations and is therefore slow, but never fails to even-
tually produce the root. The procedure stops when two
successive values of x are equal—to the required degree
of accuracy.
The method of bisection is demonstrated in Prob-
lems 1 to 3 following.
Problem 1.
Use the method of bisection to ﬁnd
the positive root of the equation 5x 2+11x −17=0
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Let f (x)=5x2+11x −17
then, using functional notation:
f (0) = −17
f(1) = 5(1)2 + 11(1) −17 = −1
f(2) = 5(2)2 + 11(2) −17 = +25
Since there is a change of sign from negative
to positive there must be a root of the equation between
x =1 and x =2. This is shown graphically in Fig. 9.2.

Figure 9.2
The method of bisection suggests that the root is at
1+2
2
=1.5, i.e. the interval between 1 and 2 has been
bisected.
Hence
f(1.5) = 5(1.5)2 + 11(1.5) −17
= +10.75
Since f (1) is negative, f (1.5) is positive, and f (2) is
also positive, a root of the equation must lie between
x =1 and x =1.5, since a sign change has occurred
between f (1) and f (1.5)
Bisecting this interval gives 1+1.5
2
i.e. 1.25 as the next
root.
Hence
f(1.25) = 5(1.25)2 + 11x −17
= +4.5625
Since f (1) is negative and f (1.25) is positive, a root
lies between x =1 and x =1.25
Bisecting this interval gives 1+1.25
2
i.e. 1.125
Hence
f(1.125) = 5(1.125)2 + 11(1.125) −17
= +1.703125
Since f (1) is negative and f (1.125) is positive, a root
lies between x =1 and x =1.125
Bisecting this interval gives 1+1.125

i.e. 1.0625

Hence
f(1.0625) = 5(1.0625)2 + 11(1.0625) −17

Since f (1) is negative and f (1.0625) is positive, a root
lies between x =1 and x =1.0625
Bisecting this interval gives 1+1.0625
2
i.e. 1.03125
Hence
f(1.03125) = 5(1.03125)2 + 11(1.03125) −17
= −0.338867...
Since f (1.03125)is negativeand f (1.0625) is positive,
a root lies between x =1.03125 and x =1.0625
Bisecting this interval gives
1.03125 + 1.0625
2
i.e. 1.046875
Hence
f(1.046875) = 5(1.046875)2 + 11(1.046875) −17
= −0.0046386...
Since f (1.046875) is negative and f (1.0625) is posi-
tive, a root lies between x =1.046875 and x =1.0625
Bisecting this interval gives
1.046875 + 1.0625
2
i.e. 1.0546875
The last three values obtained for the root are 1.03125,
1.046875 and 1.0546875. The last two values are both
1.05, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgure. We therefore stop
the iterations here.
Thus, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, the positive root
of 5x2 + 11x−17 = 0 is 1.05
Problem 2.
Use the bisection method to deter-
mine the positive root of the equation x +3=ex,

then, using functional notation:
f(0)=0 + 3 −e0=+2
f(1)=1 + 3 −e1=+1.2817...
f(2)=2 + 3 −e2=−2.3890...
Since f (1) is positive and f (2) is negative, a root lies
between x =1 and x =2. A sketch of f (x) = x + 3−ex,
i.e. x +3=ex is shown in Fig. 9.3.

The last two values of x are 1.504882813 and
1.505388282, i.e. both are equal to 1.505, correct to

Hence the root of x+3=ex is x= 1.505, correct to 3

9.3 An algebraic method of
successive approximations
This method can be used to solve equations of the form:
a + bx + cx2 + dx3 + ··· = 0,
where a,b,c,d,... are constants.
Procedure:
First approximation
(a)
Using a graphical or the functional notation
method (see Section 9.1) determine an approxi-
mate value of the root required, say x1
Second approximation
(b)
Let the true value of the root be (x1+δ1)
(c)
Determine x2 the approximate value of (x1+δ1)
by determining the value of f (x1+δ1)=0, but
neglecting terms containing products of δ1

Section A

Third approximation
(d)
Let the true value of the root be (x2 +δ2)
(e)
Determine x3, the approximate value of (x2 +δ2)
by determining the value of f (x2 +δ2)=0, but
neglecting terms containing products of δ2
(f)
Thefourthandhigherapproximationsareobtained
in a similar way.
Using the techniques given in paragraphs (b) to (f),
it is possible to continue getting values nearer and
nearer to the required root. The procedure is repeated
until the value of the required root does not change on
two consecutive approximations, when expressed to the
required degree of accuracy.
Problem 4.
Use an algebraic method of
successive approximations to determine the value
of the negative root of the quadratic equation:
4x2−6x −7=0 correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Check the value of the root by using the quadratic
formula.
A ﬁrst estimate of the values of the roots is made by
using the functional notation method
f (x) = 4x2 −6x −7
f (0) = 4(0)2 −6(0) −7 = −7
f (−1) = 4(−1)2 −6(−1) −7 = 3
These results show that the negative root lies between 0
and −1, since the value of f (x) changes sign between
f (0) and f (−1) (see Section 9.1). The procedure
given above for the root lying between 0 and −1 is
followed.
First approximation
(a)
Let a ﬁrst approximation be such that it divides
the interval 0 to −1 in the ratio of −7 to 3, i.e. let
x1 =−0.7
Second approximation
(b)
Let the true value of the root, x2, be (x1+δ1).
(c)
Let f (x1 + δ1) = 0, then, since x1 = −0.7,
4(−0.7 + δ1)2 −6(−0.7 + δ1) −7=0
Hence,4[(−0.7)2 + (2)(−0.7)(δ1) + δ2
1]
−(6)(−0.7) −6δ1 −7=0
Neglecting terms containing products of δ1 gives:
1.96−5.6δ1 + 4.2−6δ1 −7 ≈0
i.e.
−5.6δ1 −6δ1 = −1.96 −4.2+ 7
i.e.
δ1 ≈−1.96 −4.2+ 7
−5.6 −6
≈0.84
−11.6
≈−0.0724
Thus, x2, a second approximation to the root is
[−0.7+(−0.0724)]
i.e. x2 =−0.7724, correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
(Since the question asked for 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgure
accuracy, it is usual to work to one ﬁgure greater
than this.)
The procedure given in (b) and (c) is now repeated
for x2 =−0.7724
Third approximation
(d)
Let the true value of the root, x3, be (x2 +δ2)
(e)
Let f (x2 +δ2)=0, then, since x2 =−0.7724,
4(−0.7724+ δ2)2 −6(−0.7724+ δ2) −7 = 0
4[(−0.7724)2 + (2)(−0.7724)(δ2) + δ2
2]
−(6)(−0.7724) −6δ2 −7 = 0
Neglecting terms containing products of δ2 gives:
2.3864−6.1792δ2 + 4.6344−6δ2 −7 ≈0
i.e. δ2 ≈−2.3864−4.6344+ 7
−6.1792−6
≈−0.0208
−12.1792
≈+0.001708
Thus x3, the third approximation to the root is
(−0.7724+ 0.001708)
i.e. x3 = −0.7707, correct to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures
(or −0.771 correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures).
Fourth approximation
(f)
The procedure given for the second and third
approximations is now repeated for
x3 = −0.7707

Section A
Solving equations by iterative methods
85
Let the true value of the root, x4, be (x3+δ3).
Let f (x3 + δ3) = 0, then since x3=−0.7707,
4(−0.7707 + δ3)2 −6(−0.7707
+δ3) −7 = 0
4[(−0.7707)2 + (2)(−0.7707)δ3 + δ2
3]
−6(−0.7707) −6δ3 −7 = 0
Neglecting terms containing products of δ3 gives:
2.3759 −6.1656δ3+ 4.6242−6δ3 −7 ≈0
i.e. δ3 ≈−2.3759 −4.6242+ 7
−6.1656 −6
≈−0.0001
−12.156
≈+0.00000822
Thus, x4, the fourth approximation to the root is
(−0.7707 + 0.00000822), i.e. x4 = −0.7707, cor-
rect to 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, and −0.771, correct to
3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since the values of the roots are the same on
two consecutive approximations, when stated to
the required degree of accuracy, then the negative
root of 4x2 −6x −7=0 is −0.771, correct to 3
signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

[Note on accuracy and errors. Depending on the
accuracy of evaluating the f (x +δ) terms, one or two
iterations (i.e. successive approximations) might be
saved. However, it is not usual to work to more than
about 4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures accuracy in this type of cal-
culation. If a small error is made in calculations, the only
likely effect is to increase the number of iterations.]
Problem 5.
Determine the value of the
smallest positive root of the equation
3x3−10x2+4x +7=0, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures, using an algebraic method of successive
approximations.
The functional notation method is used to ﬁnd the value
of the ﬁrst approximation.
f (x) = 3x3 −10x2 + 4x + 7
f (0) = 3(0)3 −10(0)2 + 4(0) + 7 = 7
f (1) = 3(1)3 −10(1)2 + 4(1) + 7 = 4
f (2) = 3(2)3 −10(2)2 + 4(2) + 7 = −1
Following the above procedure:
First approximation
(a)
Let the ﬁrst approximation be such that it divides
the interval 1 to 2 in the ratio of 4 to −1, i.e. let x1
be 1.8
Second approximation
(b)
Let the true value of the root, x2, be (x1+δ1)
(c)
Let f (x1 + δ1) = 0, then since x1 = 1.8
3(1.8 + δ1)3 −10(1.8 + δ1)2
+4(1.8 + δ1) + 7 = 0
Neglecting terms containing products of δ1 and
using the binomial series gives:
3[1.83 + 3(1.8)2δ1] −10[1.82 + (2)(1.8)δ1]
+ 4(1.8 + δ1) + 7 ≈0
3(5.832+ 9.720δ1) −32.4−36δ1
+ 7.2 + 4δ1 + 7 ≈0
17.496 + 29.16δ1 −32.4−36δ1

δ1 ≈−17.496 + 32.4−7.2 −7
29.16 −36 + 4
≈−0.704
2.84 ≈−0.2479
Thus x2 ≈1.8−0.2479=1.5521
Third approximation
(d)
Let the true value of the root, x3, be (x2+δ2)
(e)
Let f (x2 + δ2) = 0, then since x2 =1.5521
3(1.5521 + δ2)3 −10(1.5521 + δ2)2

Thus x3 ≈1.5521 + 0.06256≈1.6147

Values of x4 and x5 are found in a similar way.
f (x3 + δ3) = 3(1.6147 + δ3)3 −10(1.6147

giving δ3 ≈0.003175 and x4 ≈1.618, i.e. 1.62
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
f (x4 + δ4) = 3(1.618 + δ4)3 −10(1.618 + δ4)2
+ 4(1.618 + δ4) + 7 = 0
giving δ4 ≈0.0000417, and x5 ≈1.62, correct to
3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since x4 and x5 are the same when expressed to
the required degree of accuracy, then the required
root is 1.62, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

The Newton–Raphson method
The Newton–Raphson formula,∗often just referred to
as Newton’s method, may be stated as follows:
If r1 is the approximate value of a real root of the
equation f(x) = 0, then a closer approximation to the
root r2 is given by:
r2 =r1 −f(r1)
f ′(r1)
The advantages of Newton’s method over the alge-
braic method of successive approximations is that it
can be used for any type of mathematical equation
(i.e. ones containing trigonometric, exponential, loga-
rithmic, hyperbolic and algebraic functions), and it is
usually easier to apply than the algebraic method.
∗Who were Newton and Raphson? Sir Isaac Newton PRS
MP (25 December 1642–20 March 1727) was an English
polymath. Newton showed that the motions of objects are
governed by the same set of natural laws, by demonstrating
the consistency between Kepler’s laws of planetary motion
and his theory of gravitation. To ﬁnd out more go to

Problem 6.
Use Newton’s method to determine
the positive root of the quadratic equation
5x2+11x −17=0, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Check the value of the root by using the quadratic
formula.
The functional notation method is used to determine the
ﬁrst approximation to the root.
f (x) = 5x2 + 11x −17
f (0) = 5(0)2 + 11(0) −17 = −17
f (1) = 5(1)2 + 11(1) −17 = −1
f (2) = 5(2)2 + 11(2) −17 = 25
This shows that the value of the root is close to x =1
Let the ﬁrst approximation to the root, r1, be 1
Newton’s formula states that a closer approximation,
r2 = r1 −f (r1)
f ′(r1)
f (x)=5x2 + 11x −17
thus,
f (r1)=5(r1)2 + 11(r1) −17
=5(1)2 + 11(1) −17 = −1
f ′(x) is the differential coefﬁcient of f (x),
i.e.
f ′(x) =10x + 11
Thusf ′(r1)=10(r1) + 11
=10(1) + 11 = 21
By Newton’s formula, a better approximation to the
root is:
r2 = 1 −−1
21 = 1 −(−0.048) = 1.05,
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
A still better approximation to the root, r3, is given by:
r3 = r2 −f (r2)
f ′(r2)
= 1.05 −[5(1.05)2 + 11(1.05) −17]
[10(1.05) + 11]
= 1.05 −0.0625
21.5
= 1.05 −0.003 = 1.047,
i.e. 1.05, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since the values of r2 and r3 are the same when
expressed to the required degree of accuracy, the
required root is 1.05, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Checking, using the quadratic equation formula,
x = −11 ± √[121 −4(5)(−17)]
(2)(5)
= −11 ± 21.47
10
The positive root is 1.047, i.e. 1.05, correct to 3 signi-
ﬁcant ﬁgures (This root was determined in Problem 1
using the bisection method; Newton’s method is clearly
quicker).
Problem 7.
Taking the ﬁrst approximation as 2,
determine the root of the equation
x2 −3sinx +2ln(x +1)=3.5, correct to 3
signiﬁcant ﬁgures, by using Newton’s method.
Newton’s formula states that r2 = r1 −f (r1)
f ′(r1), where
r1 is a ﬁrst approximation to the root and r2 is a better
approximation to the root.
Since f (x) = x2 −3sinx + 2ln(x + 1) −3.5
f (r1) = f (2) = 22 −3sin2 + 2ln3 −3.5
where sin2 means the sine of 2 radians

i.e. r3 = 2.01, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since the values of r2 and r3 are the same when
expressed to the required degree of accuracy, then the
required root is 2.01, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Problem 8.
Use Newton’s method to ﬁnd the
positive root of:
(x + 4)3 −e1.92x + 5cos x
3 = 9,
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
The functional notational method is used to determine
the approximate value of the root.
f (x) = (x + 4)3 −e1.92x + 5cos x
3 −9
f (0) = (0 + 4)3 −e0 + 5cos0 −9 = 59
f (1) = 53 −e1.92 + 5cos 1

f (2) = 63 −e3.84 + 5cos 2

f (3) = 73 −e5.76 + 5cos1 −9 ≈19
f (4) = 83 −e7.68 + 5cos 4

From these results, let a ﬁrst approximation to the root
be r1 =3
Newton’s formula states that a better approximation to
the root,
r2 = r1 −f (r1)
f ′(r1)
f (r1) = f (3) = 73 −e5.76 + 5cos1 −9

f ′(r1) = f ′(3) = 3(7)2 −1.92e5.76 −5

Thus, r2 = 3 −19.35
−463.7 = 3 + 0.042
= 3.042 = 3.04,
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Similarly, r3 = 3.042−f (3.042)
f ′(3.042)
= 3.042−(−1.146)
(−513.1)
= 3.042−0.0022 = 3.0398 = 3.04,
correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Since r2 and r3 are the same when expressed to the

3.04, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.

Binary, octal and
hexadecimal numbers
Why it is important to understand: Binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers
There are inﬁnite ways to represent a number. The four commonly associated with modern computers
and digital electronics are decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal. All four number systems are equally
capable of representing any number. Furthermore, a number can be perfectly converted between the
various number systems without any loss of numeric value. At ﬁrst look, it seems like using any number
system other than decimal is complicated and unnecessary. However, since the job of electrical and
software engineers is to work with digital circuits, engineers require number systems thatcan best transfer
information between the human world and the digital circuit world. Thus the way in which a number is
represented can make it easier for the engineer to perceive the meaning of the number as it applies to
a digital circuit, i.e. the appropriate number system can actually make things less complicated. Binary,
octal and hexadecimal numbers are explained in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise a binary number
•
convert binary to decimal and vice-versa
•

Introduction
Man’s earliest number or counting system was prob-
ably developed to help determine how many pos-
sessions a person had. As daily activities became
more complex, numbers became more important in
trade, time, distance, and all other phases of human
life. Ever since people discovered that it was nec-
essary to count objects, they have been looking for
easier ways to do so. The abacus, developed by
the Chinese, is one of the earliest known calcula-
tors; it is still in use in some parts of the world.

Blaise Pascal∗invented the ﬁrst adding machine in
1642. Twenty years later, an Englishman, Sir Samuel
Morland∗, developeda more compact devicethat could
multiply,add, and subtract. About 1672,GottfriedWil-
helm von Leibniz∗perfected a machine that could
perform all the basic operations (add, subtract, multi-
ply, divide), as well as extract the square root. Modern
electronic digital computers still use von Leibniz’s
principles.
Computers are now employed wherever repeated
calculations or the processing of huge amounts of data
are needed. The greatest applications are found in the
military, scientiﬁc, and commercial ﬁelds. They have
applications that range from mail sorting, and engi-
neering design, to the identiﬁcation and destruction
∗Who was Leibniz? Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (sometimes
von Leibniz theorem∗) (1 July 1646–14 November 1716) was
a German mathematician and philosopher. Leibniz developed
inﬁnitesimal calculus and invented the Leibniz wheel. To ﬁnd

∗Who was Morland? Sir Samuel Morland, 1st Baronet
(1625–1695), was an English academic, diplomat, spy, inven-
tor and mathematician of the 17th century, a polymath
credited with early developments in relation to comput-
ing, hydraulics and steam power. To ﬁnd out more go to

of enemy targets. The advantages of digital comput-
ers include speed, accuracy, and man-power savings.
Often computers are able to take over routine jobs and
release personnel for more important work that can-
not be handled by a computer. People and computers
do not normally speak the same language. Methods of
translating information into forms that are understand-
able and usable to both are necessary. Humans generally
speak in words and numbers expressed in the decimal
number system, while computers onlyunderstandcoded
electronic pulses that represent digital information.
All data in modern computers is stored as series of
bits, a bit being a binary digit, and can have one of
two values, the numbers 0 and 1. The most basic form
of representing computer data is to represent a piece of
data as a string of 1s and 0s, one for each bit. This is
called a binary or base-2 number.
Because binary notation requires so many bits to rep-
resent relatively small numbers, two further compact
notations are often used, called octal and hexadeci-
mal. Computer programmers who design sequences of
number codes instructing a computer what to do would
have a very difﬁcult task if they were forced to work
with nothing but long strings of 1s and 0s, the ‘native
language’ of any digital circuit.
Octal notation represents data as base-8 numbers with
each digit in an octal number representing three bits.
Similarly, hexadecimal notation uses base-16 numbers,
representing four bits with each digit. Octal numbers
use only the digits 0–7, while hexadecimal numbers
use all ten base-10 digits (0–9) and the letters A–F
(representing the numbers 10–15).
This chapter explains how to convert between the
decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal systems.
10.2
Binary numbers
The system of numbers in everyday use is the denary
or decimal system of numbers, using the digits 0 to 9.
It has ten different digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9)
and is said to have a radix or base of 10.
The binary system of numbers has a radix of 2 and uses
only the digits 0 and 1.
(a)
Conversion of binary to decimal
The decimal number 234.5 is equivalent to
2 × 102 + 3 × 101 + 4 × 100 + 5 × 10−1
i.e. the sum of terms comprising: (a digit) multiplied by
(the base raised to some power).

Section A

Higher Engineering Mathematics
In the binary system of numbers, the base is 2, so 1101.1
is equivalent to:
1 × 23 + 1 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20 + 1 × 2−1
Thus the decimal number equivalent to the binary
number 1101.1 is 8+4+0+1+ 1
2, that is 13.5 i.e.
1101.12 =13.510, the sufﬁxes 2 and 10 denoting binary
and decimal systems of numbers respectively.
Problem 1.
Convert 110112 to a decimal number.
From above: 110112 = 1×24 + 1×23 + 0 × 22
+ 1 × 21 + 1 × 20
= 16 + 8 + 0+ 2 + 1
= 2710
Problem 2.
Convert 0.10112 to a decimal
fraction.
0.10112 = 1×2−1 + 0×2−2 + 1×2−3 + 1×2−4
= 1× 1
2 + 0× 1
22 + 1× 1
23 + 1× 1
24
= 1
2 + 1
8 + 1

= 0.5 + 0.125 + 0.0625
= 0.687510
Problem 3.
Convert 101.01012 to a decimal
number.
101.01012 = 1×22 + 0×21 + 1×20 + 0×2−1
+ 1×2−2 + 0×2−3 + 1×2−4
= 4 + 0 + 1 + 0+ 0.25 + 0+ 0.0625
= 5.312510

Conversion of decimal to binary
An integer decimal number can be converted to a cor-
responding binary number by repeatedly dividing by 2
and noting the remainder at each stage, as shown below
for 3910.

The result is obtained by writing the top digit of the
remainder as the least signiﬁcant bit (a bit is a binary
digit and the least signiﬁcant bit is the one on the right).
The bottom bit of the remainder is the most signiﬁcant
bit, i.e. the bit on the left.
Thus
3910 = 1001112
Thefractionalpartofadecimalnumbercanbeconverted

For fractions, the most signiﬁcant bit of the result is the
top bit obtained from the integer part of multiplication
by 2. The least signiﬁcant bit of the result is the bottom
bit obtained from the integer part of multiplication by 2.
Thus 0.62510 = 0.1012

Octal numbers
For decimal integers containing several digits, repeat-
edly dividing by 2 can be a lengthy process. In this case,
it is usually easier to convert a decimal number to a
binary number via the octal system of numbers. This
system has a radix of 8, using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 and 7. The decimal number equivalent to the octal
number 43178 is:
4 × 83 + 3 × 82 + 1 × 81 + 7 × 80
i.e. 4 × 512 + 3 × 64+ 1 × 8 + 7 × 1 or 225510
An integer decimal number can be converted to a cor-
responding octal number by repeatedly dividing by 8
and noting the remainder at each stage, as shown below
for 49310

.3
3.  5
4.  0
0.4375 3 8 5

For fractions, the most signiﬁcant bit is the top integer
obtained by multiplication of the decimal fraction by
8, thus,
0.437510 = 0.348
The natural binary code for digits 0 to 7 is shown
in Table 10.1, and an octal number can be converted
to a binary number by writing down the three bits
corresponding to the octal digit.
Thus
4378 = 100 011 1112
and 26.358 = 010 110.011 1012
The ‘0’ on the extreme left does not signify anything,
thus 26.358=10 110.011 1012

strated in the following worked problems.

Hexadecimal numbers
The hexadecimal system is particularly important in
computer programming, since four bits (each consist-
ing of a one or zero) can be succinctly expressed using
a single hexadecimal digit. Two hexadecimal digits rep-
resent numbers from 0 to 255, a common range used,
for example, to specify colours. Thus, in the HTML
language of the web, colours are speciﬁed using three
pairs of hexadecimal digits RRGGBB, where RR is the
amount of red, GG the amount of green, and BB the
amount of blue.
A hexadecimal numbering system has a radix of
16 and uses the following 16 distinct digits:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F
‘A’ corresponds to 10 in the decimal system, B to 11,
C to 12, and so on.
(a)
Converting from hexadecimal to decimal
For example
1A16 = 1 × 161 + A × 160
= 1 × 161 + 10 × 1
= 16 + 10 = 26
i.e.
1A16 =2610
Similarly, 2E16 = 2 × 161 + E × 160
= 2 × 161 + 14× 160
= 32 + 14 = 4610
and
1BF16 = 1 × 162 + B × 161 + F × 160
= 1 × 162 + 11 × 161 + 15 × 160
= 256 + 176 + 15 = 44710
Table 10.2 compares decimal, binary, octal and hexa-
decimal
numbers and
shows, for
example, that
2310 =101112=278=1716
Problem 15.
Convert the following hexadecimal
numbers into their decimal equivalents:
(a) 7A16
(b) 3F16
(a) 7A16 = 7 × 161 + A × 160 = 7 × 16 + 10× 1
= 112 + 10 = 122
Thus 7A16 =12210
(b) 3F16 = 3 × 161 + F × 160 = 3 × 16 + 15 × 1
= 48 + 15 = 63
Thus 3F16 =6310
Problem 16.
Convert the following hexadecimal
numbers into their decimal equivalents:
(a) C916
(b) BD16
(a) C916 = C × 161 + 9 × 160 = 12 × 16 + 9 × 1
= 192+ 9 = 201
Thus C916 =20110
(b) BD16 = B × 161 + D × 160
= 11 × 16 + 13 × 1 = 176 + 13 = 189
Thus BD16 =18910
Problem 17.
Convert 1A4E16 into a decimal
number.
1A4E16 = 1×163+A×162+4×161 + E × 160
= 1 × 163 + 10 × 162 + 4 × 161 + 14 × 160
= 1×4096+10×256+4×16 + 14× 1
= 4096 + 2560+ 64+ 14 = 6734
Thus 1A4E16 =673410

Converting from binary to hexadecimal
The binary bits are arranged in groups of four, start-
ing from right to left, and a hexadecimal symbol is
assigned to each group. For example, the binary num-
ber 1110011110101001 is initially grouped in fours as:
1110

E
0111

7
1010

A
1001

and a hexadecimal symbol
assigned to each group as above, from Table 10.2.
Hence 11100111101010012 = E7A916

Boolean algebra and logic
circuits
Why it is important to understand: Boolean algebra and logic circuits
Logic circuits are the basis for modern digital computer systems; to appreciate how computer systems
operate an understanding of digital logic and Boolean algebra is needed. Boolean algebra (named after its
developer, George Boole), is the algebra of digital logic circuits all computers use. Boolean algebra is the
algebra of binary systems. A logic gate is a physical device implementing a Boolean function, performing
a logical operation on one or more logic inputs, and produces a single logic output. Logic gates are
implemented using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches, but can also be constructed using
electromagnetic relays, ﬂuidic relays, pneumatic relays, optics, molecules or even mechanical elements.
Learning Boolean algebra for logic analysis, learning about gates that process logic signals and learning
how to design some smaller logic circuits is clearly of importance to computer engineers.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
draw a switching circuit and truth table for a two-input and three-input or-function and state its Boolean
expression
•
draw a switching circuit and truth table for a two-input and three-input and-function and state its Boolean
expression
•
produce the truth table for a two-input not-function and state its Boolean expression
•
simplify Boolean expressions using the laws and rules of Boolean algebra
•
simplify Boolean expressions using de Morgan’s laws
•
simplify Boolean expressions using Karnaugh maps
•
draw a circuit diagram symbol and truth table for a three-input and-gate and state its Boolean expression
•
draw a circuit diagram symbol and truth table for a three-input or-gate and state its Boolean expression
•
draw a circuit diagram symbol and truth table for a three-input invert (or nor)-gate and state its Boolean
expression
•
draw a circuit diagram symbol and truth table for a three-input nand-gate and state its Boolean expression
•
draw a circuit diagram symbol and truth table for a three-input nor-gate and state its Boolean expression
•
devise logic systems for particular Boolean expressions
•

11.1 Boolean algebra and switching
circuits
A two-state device is one whose basic elements
can only have one of two conditions. Thus, two-way
switches, which can either be on or off, and the binary
numbering system, having the digits 0 and 1 only, are
two-state devices. In Boolean algebra (named after
George Boole),∗if A represents one state, then A,
called ‘not-A’, represents the second state.
The or-function
In Boolean algebra, the or-function for two elements
A and B is written as A + B, and is deﬁned as ‘A, or
B, or both A and B’. The equivalent electrical circuit
for a two-input or-function is given by two switches
connected in parallel. With reference to Fig. 11.1(a),the
lampwillbeonwhenAison,whenB ison,orwhenboth
A and B are on. In the table shown in Fig. 11.1(b), all
∗Who was Boole? George Boole (2 November 1815–
8 December 1864) was an English mathematician, philosopher
and logician that worked in the ﬁelds of differential equa-
tions and algebraic logic. Best known as the author of The
Laws of Thought, Boole is also the inventor of the proto-
type of what is now called Boolean logic, which became the
basis of the modern digital computer. To ﬁnd out more go to
www.routledge.com/cw/bird
the possible switch combinations are shown in columns
1 and 2, in which a 0 represents a switch being off and
a 1 represents the switch being on, these columns being
called the inputs. Column 3 is called the output and a
0 represents the lamp being off and a 1 represents the
lamp being on. Such a table is called a truth table.

The and-function
In Boolean algebra, the and-function for two elements
A and B is written as A · B and is deﬁned as ‘both A and
B’. The equivalent electrical circuit for a two-inputand-
function is given by two switches connected in series.
With reference to Fig. 11.2(a) the lamp will be on only

The not-function
In Boolean algebra, the not-function for element A is
written as A, and is deﬁned as ‘the opposite to A’. Thus
if A means switch A is on, A means that switch A is
off. The truth table for the not-function is shown in
Table 11.1.
In the above, the Boolean expressions, equivalent
switching circuits and truth tables for the three func-
tions used in Boolean algebra are given for a two-input

system. A system may have more than two inputs and
the Boolean expression for a three-input or-function
having elements A, B and C is A + B + C. Similarly,
a three-input and-function is written as A · B · C. The
equivalent electrical circuits and truth tables for three-
input or and and-functions are shown in Figs 11.3(a)
and (b) respectively.
To achieve a given output, it is often necessary to use
combinations of switches connected both in series and
in parallel. If the output from a switching circuit is given
by the Boolean expression Z = A · B + A · B, the truth
table is as shown in Fig. 11.4(a). In this table, columns
1 and 2 give all the possible combinations of A and B.
Column 3 corresponds to A · B and column 4 to A · B,
i.e. a 1 output is obtained when A = 0 and when B = 0.
Column 5 is the or-function applied to columns 3 and 4
giving an output of Z = A · B + A · B. The correspond-
ing switching circuit is shown in Fig. 11.4(b)in which A
and B are connected in series to give A · B, A and B are
connectedin series to give A · B, and A · B and A · B are
connected in parallel to give A · B + A · B. The circuit
symbols used are such that A means the switch is on

The switches between 1 and 2 in Fig. 11.5 are in series
and have a Boolean expression of B · A. The parallel
circuit 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 have a Boolean expression
of (B · A + B). The parallel circuit can be treated as a
single switching unit, giving the equivalent of switches
5 to 6, 6 to 7 and 7 to 8 in series. Thus the output is
given by:
Z = A · (B · A + B) · B
The truth table is as shown in Table 11.2. Columns 1 and
2 give all the possible combinations of switches A and
B. Column 3 is the and-function applied to columns 1
and 2, giving B · A. Column 4 is B, i.e. the opposite
to column 2. Column 5 is the or-function applied to
columns 3 and 4. Column 6 is A, i.e. the opposite to
column 1. The output is column 7 and is obtained by
applying the and-function to columns 4, 5 and 6.

The parallel circuit 1 to 2 and 3 to 4 gives (A + B)
and this is equivalent to a single switching unit between
7 and 2. The parallel circuit 5 to 6 and 7 to 2 gives
C + (A + B) and this is equivalent to a single switching
unit between 8 and 2. The series circuit 9 to 8 and 8 to
2 gives the output
Z = B · [C + (A + B)]
The truth table is shown in Table 11.3. Columns 1,
2 and 3 give all the possible combinations of A, B
and C. Column 4 is B and is the opposite to column
2. Column 5 is the or-function applied to columns 1
and 4, giving (A + B). Column 6 is the or-function
applied to columns 3 and 5 giving C + (A + B). The

Examination of the truth table shown in Table 11.5
shows that there is a 1 output in the Z-column in rows
1, 3, 4 and 6. Thus, the Boolean expression and switch-
ing circuit should be such that a 1 output is obtained
for row 1 or row 3 or row 4 or row 6. In row 1, A is
0 and B is 0 and C is 0 and this corresponds to the
Boolean expression A · B · C. In row 3, A is 0 and B is
1 and C is 0, i.e. the Boolean expression in A · B · C.
Similarly in rows 4 and 6, the Boolean expressions are
A · B · C and A · B · C respectively. Hence the Boolean
expression is:
Z = A · B · C + A · B · C
+ A · B · C + A · B · C
The corresponding switching circuit is shown in

(+) , and are represented by four parallel circuits. Each
term has three elements joined by an and-function, and
is represented by three elements connected in series.

11.2 Simplifying Boolean
expressions
A Boolean expression may be used to describe a
complex switching circuit or logic system. If the
Boolean expression can be simpliﬁed, then the number
of switches or logic elements can be reduced, resulting
in a saving in cost. Three principal ways of simplifying
Boolean expressions are:
(a)
by using the laws and rules of Boolean algebra(see
Section 11.3),
(b)
by applying de Morgan’s laws (see Section 11.4),
and
(c)
by using Karnaugh maps (see Section 11.5).
11.3 Laws and rules of Boolean
algebra
A summary of the principal laws and rules of Boolean
algebra are given in Table 11.7. The way in which
these laws and rules may be used to simplify Boolean
expressions is shown in Problems 5 to 10.

De Morgan’s laws

to
simplify
not-functions having two or more elements. The laws
state that:
∗Who was de Morgan? Augustus de Morgan (27 June
1806–18 March 1871) was a British mathematician and
logician. He formulated de Morgan’s laws and introduced
the term mathematical induction. To ﬁnd out more go to
www.routledge.com/cw/bird
A + B = A · B and A · B = A + B
and may be veriﬁed by using a truth table (see Prob-
lem 11). The application of de Morgan’s laws in sim-
plifying Boolean expressions is shown in Problems 12
and 13.
Problem 11.
Verify that A + B = A · B
A Boolean expression may be veriﬁed by using a truth
table. In Table 11.8, columns 1 and 2 give all the pos-
sible arrangements of the inputs A and B. Column 3 is
the or-function applied to columns 1 and 2 and column
4 is the not-function applied to column 3. Columns 5
and 6 are the not-function applied to columns 1 and 2,
respectively, and column 7 is the and-function applied
to columns 5 and 6.

Since columns 4 and 7 have the same pattem of 0’s and

Problem 12.
Simplify the Boolean expression
(A · B) + (A + B) by using de Morgan’s laws and
the rules of Boolean algebra.
Applying de Morgan’s law to the ﬁrst term gives:
A · B = A + B = A + B
since A = A
Applying de Morgan’s law to the second term gives:
A + B = A · B = A · B
Thus, (A · B) + (A + B) = (A + B) + A · B
Removing the bracket and reordering gives: A + A ·
B + B
But, by rule 15, Table 11.7, A + A · B = A. It follows
that: A + A · B = A
Thus: (A · B) + (A + B) = A + B

Section A

Higher Engineering Mathematics
Problem 13.
Simplify the Boolean expression
(A · B + C) · (A + B · C) by using de Morgan’s
laws and the rules of Boolean algebra.
Applying de Morgan’s laws to the ﬁrst term gives:
A · B + C = A · B · C = (A + B) · C
= (A + B) · C = A · C + B · C
Applying de Morgan’s law to the second term gives:
A + B · C = A + (B + C) = A + (B + C)
Thus (A · B + C) · (A + B · C)
= (A · C + B · C) · (A + B + C)
= A · A · C + A · B · C + A · C · C
+ A · B · C + B · B · C + B · C · C
But from Table 11.7, A · A = A and C · C = B · B = 0
Hence the Boolean expression becomes:
A · C + A · B · C + A · B · C
= A · C(1 + B + B)
= A · C(1 + B)
= A · C
Thus: (A · B + C) · (A + B · C) = A · C

Karnaugh maps
(a) Two-variable Karnaugh maps
A truth table for a two-variable expression is shown
in Table 11.9(a), the ‘1’ in the third row output show-
ing that Z = A · B. Each of the four possible Boolean
expressions associated with a two-variable function can
be depicted as shown in Table 11.9(b), in which one
cell is allocated to each row of the truth table. A matrix
similar to that shown in Table 11.9(b) can be used to
depictZ = A · B,byputtinga1inthecellcorresponding
to A · B and 0s in the remaining cells. This method of
depicting a Boolean expression is called a two-variable
Karnaugh∗map, and is shown in Table 11.9(c).
To simplify a two-variable Boolean expression, the
Boolean expression is depicted on a Karnaugh map, as
outlined above. Any cells on the map having either a
common vertical side or a common horizontal side are
grouped together to form a couple. (This is a coupling

simpliﬁed Boolean expression for a couple is given by
those variables common to all cells in the couple. See
Problem 14.
(b) Three-variable Karnaugh maps
A truth table for a three-variable expression is shown
in Table 11.10(a), the ls in the output column showing
that:
Z = A · B · C + A · B · C + A · B · C
Each of the eight possible Boolean expressions asso-
ciated with a three-variable function can be depicted
as shown in Table 11.10(b), in which one cell is allo-
cated to each row of the truth table. A matrix similar
to that shown in Table 11.10(b) can be used to depict:
Z = A · B · C + A · B · C + A · B · C, by putting 1s in
the cells corresponding to the Boolean terms on the
right of the Boolean equation and 0s in the remaining
cells. This method of depicting a three-variableBoolean
expression is called a three-variable Karnaugh map, and
is shown in Table 11.10(c).
To simplify a three-variable Boolean expression, the
Boolean expression is depicted on a Karnaugh map as
outlined above. Any cells on the map having common
edges either vertically or horizontally are grouped
together to form couples of four cells or two cells.
During coupling the horizontal lines at the top and
bottom of the cells are taken as a common edge, as are
the vertical lines on the left and right of the cells. The
simpliﬁed Boolean expression for a couple is given by
those variables common to all cells in the couple. See
Problems 15 to 17.

by putting 1s in the cells corresponding to the Boolean
terms on the right of the Boolean equation and 0s in
the remaining cells. This method of depicting a four-
variable expression is called a four-variable Karnaugh
map, and is shown in Table 11.11(c).
To simplify a four-variable Boolean expression, the
Boolean expression is depicted on a Karnaugh map
as outlined above. Any cells on the map having com-
mon edges either vertically or horizontally are grouped
together to form couples of eight cells, four cells or two
cells. During coupling, the horizontal lines at the top
and bottom of the cells may be considered to be com-
mon edges, as are the vertical lines on the left and the
right of the cells. The simpliﬁed Boolean expression for
a couple is given by those variables common to all cells
in the couple. See Problems 18 and 19.

each cell containing a 1 must be used at least
once.)
(d)
The Boolean expression for the couple is given by
the variables which are common to all cells in the
couple.

The term P · Q is marked with a 1 in the top
left-hand cell, correspondingto P = 0 and Q = 0;
P · Q is marked with a 1 in the bottom left-hand
cell corresponding to P = 0 and Q = 1
(c)
The two cells containing 1s have a common hor-
izontal edge and thus a vertical couple can be
formed.

Simplify the expression
X · Y · Z + X · Y · Z + X · Y · Z + X · Y · Z
by using Karnaugh map techniques.
Using the above procedure:
(a)
A three-variable matrix is drawn and is shown in
Table 11.13
Table 11.13
(b)
The ls on the matrix correspond to the expression
given, i.e. for X · Y · Z, X = 0, Y = 1 and Z = 0
and hence corresponds to the cell in the two rows
and second column, and so on.
(c)
Two couples can be formed as shown. The couple
in the bottom row may be formed since the vertical
lines on the left and right of the cells are taken as
a common edge.
(d)
The variables common to the couple in the top
row are Y = 1 and Z = 0, that is, Y · Z and the
variables common to the couple in the bottom row
are Y = 0, Z = 1, that is, Y · Z. Hence:
X · Y · Z + X · Y · Z + X · Y · Z
+ X · Y · Z = Y · Z + Y · Z
Problem 16.
Use a Karnaugh map technique to
simplify the expression (A · B) · (A + B).
Using the procedure,a two-variablematrix is drawn and
is shown in Table 11.14.
A · B corresponds to the bottom left-hand cell and
(A · B) must therefore be all cells except this one,
marked with a 1 in Table 11.14. (A + B) corresponds to
all the cells except the top right-hand cell marked with a
Table 11.14
2 in Table 11.14. Hence (A + B) must correspondto the
cell marked with a 2. The expression (A · B) · (A + B)
corresponds to the cell having both 1 and 2 in it, i.e.
(A · B) · (A + B) = A · B
Problem 17.
Simplify (P + Q · R) + (P · Q + R)
using a Karnaugh map technique.
The term (P + Q · R) corresponds to the cells marked
1 on the matrix in Table 11.15(a), hence (P + Q · R)
corresponds to the cells marked 2. Similarly, (P · Q +
R) corresponds to the cells marked 3 in Table 11.15(a),
hence (P · Q + R) corresponds to the cells marked 4.
The expression(P + Q · R) + (P · Q + R) corresponds
to cells marked with either a 2 or with a 4 and is shown
in Table 11.15(b) by Xs. These cells may be coupled as
shown. The variables common to the group of four cells
is P = 0, i.e. P, and those common to the group of two
cells are Q = 0, R = 1, i.e. Q · R
Thus: (P + Q · R) + (P · Q + R) = P + Q · R

Using the procedure, a four-variable matrix is drawn
and is shown in Table 11.16. The 1s marked on the
matrix correspond to the expression given. Two cou-
ples can be formed as shown. The four-cell couple has
B = 1, C = 1, i.e. B · C as the common variables to all
four cells and the two-cell couple has A · B · D as the
common variables to both cells. Hence, the expression
simpliﬁes to:

The Karnaugh map for the expression is shown in
Table 11.17. Since the top and bottom horizontal lines
are common edges and the vertical lines on the left and
right of the cells are common, then the four corner cells
form a couple, B · D (the cells can be considered as if
they are stretched to completely corner a sphere, as far
as common edges are concerned). The cell A · B · C · D
cannot be coupled with any other. Hence the expression
simpliﬁes to

Logic circuits
In practice, logic gates are used to perform the and,
or and not-functions introduced in Section 11.1. Logic
gates can be made from switches, magnetic devices or
ﬂuidic devices but most logic gates in use are electronic
devices. Various logic gates are available. For exam-
ple, the Boolean expression (A · B · C) can be produced
using a three-input and-gate and (C + D) by using a
two-input or-gate. The principal gates in common use
are introduced below. The term ‘gate’ is used inthe same
sense as a normal gate, the open state being indicated by
a binary ‘1’ and the closed state by a binary ‘0’. A gate
will only open when the requirements of the gate are
met and, for example, there will only be a ‘1’ output on
a two-input and-gate when both the inputs to the gate
are at a ‘1’ state.

The and-gate
The different symbols used for a three-input, and-gate
are shown in Fig. 11.13(a) and the truth table is shown
in Fig. 11.13(b). This shows that there will only be
a ‘1’ output when A is 1 and B is 1 and C is 1,

Combinational logic networks
In most logic circuits, more than one gate is needed
to give the required output. Except for the invert-gate,
logic gates generally have two, three or four inputs and
are conﬁned to one function only. Thus, for example, a
two-input or-gate or a four-input and-gate can be used
when designing a logic circuit. The way in which logic
gates are used to generate a given output is shown in
Problems 20 to 23.
Problem 20.
Devise a logic system to meet the
requirements of: Z = A · B + C
With reference to Fig. 11.18 an invert-gate, shown as
(1), gives B. The and-gate, shown as (2), has inputs of
A and B, giving A · B. The or-gate, shown as (3), has
inputs of A · B and C, giving:

The ‘1’ outputs in rows 6, 7 and 8 of Table 11.18 show
that the Boolean expression is:
Z = A · B · C + A · B · C + A · B · C
The logic circuit for this expression can be built using
three, three-input and-gates and one, three-input or-
gate, together with two invert-gates. However, the
number of gates required can be reduced by using the
techniques introduced in Sections 11.3 to 11.5, result-
ing in the cost of the circuit being reduced. Any of the
techniques can be used, and in this case, the rules of
Boolean algebra (see Table 11.7) are used.
Z = A · B · C + A · B · C + A · B · C
= A · [B · C + B · C + B · C]
= A · [B · C + B(C + C)] = A · [B · C + B]
= A · [B + B · C] = A · [B + C]

Universal logic gates
The function of any of the ﬁve logic gates in common
use can be obtained by using either nand-gates or nor-
gates and when used in this manner, the gate selected is
called a universal gate. The way in which a universal
nand-gate is used to produce the invert, and, or and
nor-functionsisshowninProblem24.Thewayinwhich
a universal nor-gate is used to produce the invert, or,
and and nand-functions is shown in Problem 25.
Problem 24.
Show how invert, and, or and
nor-functions can be produced using nand-gates
only.
A single input to a nand-gate gives the invert-function,
as shown in Fig. 11.22(a). When two nand-gates are
connected, as shown in Fig. 11.22(b), the output from
the ﬁrst gate is A · B · C and this is inverted by the
second gate, giving Z = A · B · C = A · B · C, i.e. the
and-function is produced. When A, B and C are the
inputs to a nand-gate, the output is A · B · C

By de Morgan’s law, A · B · C = A + B + C = A +
B + C, i.e. a nand-gate is used to produce the or-
function. The logic circuit is shown in Fig. 11.22(c).
If the output from the logic circuit in Fig. 11.22(c)
is inverted by adding an additional nand-gate, the
output becomes the invert of an or-function, i.e. the
nor-function, as shown in Fig. 11.22(d).
Problem 25.
Show how invert, or, and and
nand-functions can be produced by using nor-gates
only.
A single input to a nor-gate gives the invert-function,
as shown in Fig. 11.23(a). When two nor-gates are con-
nected, as shown in Fig. 11.23(b), the output from the

By de Morgan’s law, A + B + C = A·B·C = A·B·C,
i.e. the nor-gate can be used to produce the and-
function. The logic circuit is shown in Fig. 11.23(c).
When the output of the logic circuit, shown in
Fig. 11.23(c), is inverted by adding an additional
nor-gate, the output then becomes the invert of
an or-function, i.e. the nor-function as shown in
Fig. 11.23(d).
Problem 26.
Design a logic circuit, using
nand-gates having not more than three inputs, to
meet the requirements of the Boolean expression
Z = A + B + C + D
When designing logic circuits, it is often easier to start
at the output of the circuit. The given expression shows
there are four variables joined by or-functions. From
the principles introduced in Problem 24, if a four-input
nand-gate is used to give the expression given, the
inputs are A, B, C and D that is A, B, C and D.
However, the problem states that three-inputs are not
to be exceeded so two of the variables are joined, i.e.
the inputs to the three-input nand-gate, shown as gate
(1) in Fig. 11.24, is A, B, C and D. From Problem 24,
the and-function is generated by using two nand-gates
connected in series, as shown by gates (2) and (3) in
Fig. 11.24. The logic circuit required to produce the
given expression is as shown in Fig. 11.24.

Problem 27.
Use nor-gates only to design a logic
circuit to meet the requirements of the expression
Z = D · (A + B + C)
It is usual in logic circuit design to start the design at the
output. From Problem 25, the and-function between D
and the terms in the bracket can be produced by using
inputs of D and A + B + C to a nor-gate, i.e. by de
Morgan’s law, inputs of D and A · B · C. Again, with
reference to Problem 25, inputs of A · B and C to a nor-
gate give an output of A+ B + C, which by de Morgan’s
law is A · B · C. The logic circuit to produce the required
expression is as shown in Fig. 11.25.

of the three grinding mills are in action. Devise a
logic system to meet these requirements.
Let variable A represent the power supply on to all the
mills, then A represents the power supply off. Let B rep-

full, then B represents the hopper being less than 10%
full. Let C, D and E represent the three mills respec-
tively being in action, then C, D and E represent the
three mills respectively not being in action. The required
expression to activate the alarm is:
Z = A · B · (C + D + E)
There are three variables joined by and-functions in
the output, indicating that a three-input and-gate is
required, having inputs of A, B and (C + D + E). The
term (C + D + E) is produce by a three-input nand-
gate. When variables C, D and E are the inputs to a
nand-gate, the output is C · D · E which, by de Mor-
gan’s law, is C + D + E. Hence the required logic
circuit is as shown in Fig. 11.26.

Why it is important to understand: Introduction to trigonometry
There are an enormous number of uses of trigonometry and trigonometric functions. Fields that use
trigonometry or trigonometric functions include astronomy (especially for locating apparent positions
of celestial objects, in which spherical trigonometry is essential) and hence navigation (on the oceans, in
aircraft, and in space), music theory, acoustics, optics, analysis of ﬁnancial markets, electronics, prob-
ability theory, statistics, biology, medical imaging (CAT scans and ultrasound), pharmacy, chemistry,
number theory (and hence cryptology), seismology, meteorology, oceanography, many physical sciences,
land surveying and geodesy (a branch of earth sciences), architecture, phonetics, economics, electrical
engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer graphics, cartography, crystallography
and game development. It is clear that a good knowledge of trigonometry is essential in many ﬁelds of
engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state the theorem of Pythagoras and use it to ﬁnd the unknown side of a right-angled triangle
•
deﬁne sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant and cotangent of an angle in a right-angled triangle
•
evaluate trigonometric ratios of angles
•
solve right-angled triangles
•
understand angles of elevation and depression
•
use the sine and cosine rules to solve non-right-angled triangles
•
calculate the area of any triangle
•
solve practical problems involving trigonometry

∗Who was Pythagoras? Pythagoras of Samos (Born c. 570
BC and died about 495 BC) was an Ionian Greek philosopher
and mathematician. He is best known for the Pythagorean the-
orem, which states that in a right-angled triangle a2+b2 = c2.
To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
‘In any right-angled triangle, the square on the
hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the
other two sides.’
Hence b2 = a2 + c2

Thus

Evaluating trigonometric ratios
The easiest method of evaluating trigonometric func-
tions of any angle is by using a calculator.
The following values, correct to 4 decimal places, may
be checked:
sine 18◦= 0.3090,
cosine 56◦= 0.5592
sine 172◦= 0.1392
cosine 115◦= −0.4226,
sine 241.63◦= −0.8799, cosine 331.78◦= 0.8811
tangent 29◦= 0.5543,
tangent 178◦= −0.0349
tangent 296.42◦= −2.0127
To evaluate, say, sine 42◦23′ using a calculator
means ﬁnding sine42 23◦
60 since there are 60 minutes
in 1 degree.
23
60 = 0.383˙3 thus 42◦23′ = 42.38˙3◦
Thus sine 42◦23′ = sine 42.38˙3◦= 0.6741, correct to 4
decimal places.
Similarly, cosine72◦38′ = cosine7238◦
60 =0.2985,
correct to 4 decimal places.
Most calculators contain only sine, cosine and tangent
functions.Thustoevaluatesecants,cosecantsandcotan-
gents, reciprocals need to be used. The following values,
correct to 4 decimal places, may be checked:

cotangent263.59◦=

tan263.59◦= 0.1123
If we know the value of a trigonometric ratio and need
to ﬁnd the angle we use the inverse function on our
calculators.
For example, using shift and sin on our calculator gives
sin−1 (
If, for example, we know the sine of an angle is 0.5 then
the value of the angle is given by:
sin−1 0.5 = 30◦
(Check that sin30◦= 0.5)
(Note that sin−1 x does not mean
1
sinx ; also, sin−1 x
may also be written as arcsinx)
Similarly, if cosθ = 0.4371 then
θ = cos−1 0.4371 = 64.08◦
and if tanA = 3.5984 then A = tan−1 3.5984
= 74.47◦
each correct to 2 decimal places.

To ‘solve a right-angled triangle’ means ‘to ﬁnd the
unknown sides and angles’. This is achieved by using
(i) the theorem of Pythagoras, and/or (ii) trigono-
metric ratios. This is demonstrated in the following
problems.

To ‘solve triangle ABC’ means ‘to ﬁnd the length

sinC = 35

hence ∠C= sin−1 0.94595=71.08◦=71◦5′
∠B=180◦−90◦−71◦5′ =18◦55′ (since angles in a
triangle add up to 180◦)
sinB = AC
37
hence
AC = 37sin18◦55′ = 37(0.3242)

which, AC =

Sine and cosine rules
To ‘solve a triangle’ means ‘to ﬁnd the values of
unknownsides and angles’. If a triangle is right angled,
trigonometric ratios and the theorem of Pythagoras may
be used for its solution, as shown in Section 12.5.

Section B
Introduction to trigonometry
135
However, for a non-right-angled triangle, trigonomet-
ric ratios and Pythagoras’ theorem cannot be used.
Instead, two rules, called the sine rule and the cosine
rule, are used.

rule states:

The rule may be used only when:
(i)
one side and any two angles are initially given, or
(ii)
two sides and an angle (not the included angle) are
initially given.
Cosine rule
With reference to triangle ABC of Fig. 12.24, the cosine
rule states:
a2 =b2 + c2 −2bccosA
or b2 =a2 + c2 −2accosB
or c2 =a2 + b2 −2abcosC
The rule may be used only when:
(i)
twosidesandtheincludedangleareinitiallygiven,
or
(ii)
three sides are initially given.

The triangle XYZ is shown in Fig. 12.25. Since

A triangle ABC has sides

Triangle ABC is shown in Fig. 12.29. It is usual ﬁrst
to calculate the largest angle to determine whether the
triangle is acute or obtuse. In this case the largest angle
is A (i.e. opposite the longest side).
Applying the cosine rule:
a2 = b2 + c2 −2bccosA
from which, 2bccosA=b2 +c2 −a2
and
cosA = b2 + c2 −a2

HenceA= cos−1 0.1795 =79◦40′ (or 280◦20′,whichis
obviously impossible). The triangle is thus acute angled
since cosA is positive. (If cosA had been negative, angle
A would be obtuse, i.e. lie between 90◦and 180◦.)

Cartesian and polar
co-ordinates
Why it is important to understand: Cartesian and polar co-ordinates
Applications where polar co-ordinates would be used include terrestrial navigation with sonar-like
devices, and those in engineering and science involving energy radiation patterns. Applications where
Cartesian co-ordinates would be used include any navigation on a grid and anything involving raster
graphics (e.g. bitmap – a dot matrix data structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pix-
els). The ability to change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates is vitally important when using complex
numbers and their use in a.c. electrical circuit theory and with vector geometry.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates
•
change from polar to Cartesian co-ordinates
•
use a scientiﬁc notation calculator to change from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates and vice-versa

Introduction
There are two ways in which the position of a point in
a plane can be represented. These are
(a)
by
Cartesian
co-ordinates,
(named
after
Descartes∗), i.e. (x,y), and
(b)
by polar co-ordinates, i.e. (r, θ), where r is a
‘radius’ from a ﬁxed point and θ is an angle from
a ﬁxed point.
13.2 Changing from Cartesian into
polar co-ordinates
In Fig. 13.1, if lengths x and y are known, then the
length of r can be obtained from Pythagoras’ theorem
(see Chapter 12) since OPQ is a right-angled triangle.
Hence r2 =(x2 +y2)
∗Who was Descartes? René Descartes (31 March 1596–
11 February 1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician,
and writer. He wrote many inﬂuential texts including Medi-
tations on First Philosophy. Descartes is best known for the
philosophical statement ‘Cogito ergo sum’ (I think, therefore I
am), found in part IV of Discourse on the Method. To ﬁnd out

must always be measured from the positive x-axis, i.e.,
measured from the line OQ in Fig. 13.1. It is suggested
that when changing from Cartesian to polar co-ordinates
a diagram should always be sketched.

Hence the position of point P in polar co-ordinate
form is (5, 143.13◦) or (5, 2.498rad).

Another name for Cartesian co-ordinates is rectangu-

possess Pol and Rec functions. ‘Rec’ is an abbrevi-
ation of ‘rectangular’ (i.e. Cartesian) and ‘Pol’ is an
abbreviation of ‘polar’. Check the operation manual for
your particular calculator to determine how to use these
two functions. They make changing from Cartesian to
polar co-ordinates, and vice-versa, so much quicker and
easier.
For example, with the Casio fx-991ES PLUS calcu-
lator, or similar, to change the Cartesian number (3, 4)
into polar form, the following procedure is adopted:
1. Press ‘shift’
2. Press ‘Pol’

Section B

Hence, (3, 4) in Cartesian form is the same as
(5,53.13◦) in polar form.
If the angle is required in radians, then before repeating
the above procedure press ‘shift’, ‘mode’ and then 4 to
change your calculator to radian mode.
Similarly,
to
change

number
(7, 126◦) into Cartesian or rectangular form, adopt the
following procedure:
1. Press ‘shift’
2. Press ‘Rec’ 3. Enter 7
4. Enter ‘comma’
5. Enter 126 (assuming your calculator is in
degrees mode)
6. Press )
7. Press =
The answer is: X = −4.11, and scrolling across,
Y = 5.66, correct to 2 decimal places.
Hence, (7, 126◦) in polar form is the same as
(−4.11,5.66) in rectangular or Cartesian form.

Chapter 14
The circle and its properties
Why it is important to understand: The circle and its properties
A circle is one of the fundamental shapes of geometry; it consists of all the points that are equidistant
from a central point. Knowledge of calculations involving circles is needed with crank mechanisms, with
determinations of latitude and longitude, with pendulums, and even in the design of paper clips. The
ﬂoodlit area at a football ground, the area an automatic garden sprayer sprays and the angle of lap of a
belt drive all rely on calculations involving the arc of a circle. The ability to handle calculations involving
circles and its properties is clearly essential in several branches of engineering design.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a circle
•
state some properties of a circle – including radius, circumference, diameter, semicircle, quadrant, tangent,
sector, chord, segment and arc
•
appreciate the angle in a semicircle is a right angle
•
deﬁne a radian, change radians to degrees, and vice-versa
•
determine arc length, area of a circle and area of a sector of a circle
•
state the equation of a circle
•
sketch a circle given its equation
•
understand linear and angular velocity
•
understand centripetal force

Introduction
A circle is a plain ﬁgure enclosed by a curvedline, every
point on which is equidistant from a point within, called
the centre.

150
Higher Engineering Mathematics
(iii)
Any straight line passing through the centre and
touching the circumference at each end is called
the diameter, d (see QR in Fig. 14.1). Thus
d =2r.
(iv)
The ratio circumference
diameter
=a constant for any
circle.
This constant is denoted by the Greek letter π
(pronounced ‘pie’), where π =3.14159, correct
to 5 decimal places.
Hence c/d =π or c = πd or c=2πr.
(v)
A semicircle is one half of the whole circle.
(vi)
A quadrant is one quarter of a whole circle.
(vii)
A tangent to a circle is a straight line which
meets the circle in one point only and does not
cut the circle when produced. AC in Fig. 14.1 is
a tangent to the circle since it touches the curve
at point B only.If radius OB is drawn,then angle
ABO is a right angle.
(viii)
A sector of a circle is the part of a circle between
radii (for example, the portion OXY of Fig. 14.2
is a sector). If a sector is less than a semicir-
cle it is called a minor sector, if greater than a
semicircle it is called a major sector.

(ix)
A chord of a circle is any straight line which
divides the circle into two parts and is termin-
ated at each end by the circumference. ST, in
Fig. 14.2 is a chord.
(x)
A segment is the name given to the parts into
which a circle is divided by a chord. If the
segment is less than a semicircle it is called a
minor segment (see shaded area in Fig. 14.2).
If the segment is greater than a semicircle it is
called a major segment (see the unshaded area
in Fig. 14.2).
(xi)
An arc is a portion of the circumference of a
circle. The distance SRT in Fig. 14.2 is called
a minor arc and the distance SXYT is called a
major arc.
(xii)
The angle at the centre of a circle, subtended by
an arc, is double the angle at the circumference
subtended by the same arc. With reference to
Fig. 14.3, Angle AOC = 2 × angle ABC.
(xiii)
The angle in a semicircle is a right angle (see
angle BQP in Fig. 14.3).

The equation of a circle
The simplest equation of a circle, centre at the origin,
radius r, is given by:
x2 + y2 = r2
For example, Fig. 14.13 shows a circle x 2+y2 =9.
More generally, the equation of a circle, centre (a, b),
radius r, is given by:
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r2
(1)
Figure 14.14 shows a circle (x −2)2 +(y −3)2 =4.

Linear and angular velocity
Linear velocity
Linear velocity v is deﬁned as the rate of change of
linear displacement s with respect to time t. For motion
in a straight line:
linear velocity = change of displacement
change of time
i.e.
v = s
t
(1)
The unit of linear velocity is metres per second (m/s).
Angular velocity
The speed of revolution of a wheel or a shaft is usually
measured in revolutions per minute or revolutions per
second but these units do not form part of a coherent
system of units. The basis in SI units is the angle turned
through in one second.
Angular velocity is deﬁned as the rate of change of
angular displacement θ, with respect to time t. For an
object rotating about a ﬁxed axis at a constant speed:
angular velocity = angle turned through
time taken

Section B

157
i.e.
ω = θ
t
(2)
The unit of angular velocity is radians per second
(rad/s). An object rotating at a constant speed of n revo-
lutions per second subtends an angle of 2πn radians in
one second, i.e. its angular velocity ω is given by:
ω = 2πnrad/s
(3)
From page 152, s =rθ and from equation (2) above,
θ =ωt
hence
s = r(ωt)
from which
s
t = ωr
However, from equation (1) v = s
t
hence
v = ωr
(4)
Equation (4) gives the relationship between linear
velocity v and angular velocity ω.
Problem 18.
A wheel of diameter 540mm is
rotating at 1500
π
rev/min. Calculate the angular
velocity of the wheel and the linear velocity of a
point on the rim of the wheel.
From equation (3), angular velocity ω = 2πn where n
is the speed of revolution in rev/s. Since in this case
n= 1500

60π =rev/s, then

where n is in rev/s.
Hence angular speed n = ω

2π rev/s
= 60 × 60
2π rev/min
= 573rev/min
(b)
From equation (1), since v = s/t then the time
taken to travel 1.44km, i.e. 1440m at a constant
speed of 18m/s is given by:
time t = s
v = 1440m
18m/s = 80s
Since a wheel is rotating at 573rev/min, then in

Centripetal force
When an object moves in a circular path at constant
speed, its direction of motion is continually changing
and hence its velocity (which depends on both magni-
tude and direction) is also continually changing. Since
acceleration is the (change in velocity)/(time taken), the
object has an acceleration. Let the object be moving
with a constant angular velocity of ω and a tangential
velocity of magnitude v and let the change of veloc-
ity for a small change of angle of θ (=ωt) be V in
Fig. 14.17. Then v2 −v1 =V . The vector diagram is
shown in Fig. 14.17(b) and since the magnitudes of v 1
and v2 are the same, i.e. v, the vector diagram is an
isosceles triangle.

Trigonometric waveforms
Why it is important to understand: Trigonometric waveforms
Trigonometric graphs are commonly used in all areas of science and engineering for modelling many
different natural and mechanical phenomena such as waves, engines, acoustics, electronics, populations,
UV intensity, growth of plants and animals, and so on. Periodic trigonometric graphs mean that the
shape repeats itself exactly after a certain amount of time. Anything that has a regular cycle, like the
tides, temperatures, rotation of theEarth,and so on, can be modelledusing a sine or cosine curve. The most
common periodic signal waveform that is used in electrical and electronic engineering is the sinusoidal
waveform. However, an alternating a.c. waveform may not always take a smooth shape based around
the sine and cosine function; a.c. waveforms can also take the shape of square or triangular waves, i.e.
complex waves. In engineering, it is therefore important to have a clear understanding of sine and cosine
waveforms.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
sketch sine, cosine and tangent waveforms
•
determine angles of any magnitude
•
understand cycle, amplitude, period, periodic time, frequency, lagging/leading angles with reference to sine
and cosine waves
•
perform calculations involving sinusoidal form Asin(ωt ± α)
•
deﬁne a complex wave and harmonic analysis
•
use harmonic synthesis to construct a complex waveform
15.1 Graphs of trigonometric
functions
By drawing up tables of values from 0◦to 360◦, graphs
of y =sin A, y =cos A and y =tan A may be plotted.
Values obtained with a calculator (correct to 3 deci-
mal places – which is more than sufﬁcient for plotting
graphs), using 30◦intervals, are shown below, with the
respective graphs shown in Fig. 15.1.

Angles of any magnitude

Fig. 15.2 shows rectangular axes XX′ and YY′
intersecting at origin O. As with graphical work,
measurements made to the right and above O are
positive while those to the left and downwards
are negative. Let OA be free to rotate about O.
By convention, when OA moves anticlockwise
angular measurement is considered positive, and
vice-versa.

Let OA be rotated anticlockwise so that θ1 is any
angle in the ﬁrst quadrant and let perpendicular
AB be constructed to form the right-angled tri-
angle OAB (see Fig. 15.3). Since all three sides
of the triangle are positive, all six trigonometric
ratios are positive in the ﬁrst quadrant. (Note: OA
is always positive since it is the radius of a circle.)

(vii)
In the ﬁrst quadrant of Fig. 15.1 all the curves
have positive values; in the second only sine is
positive; in the third only tangent is positive;
in the fourth only cosine is positive (exactly as
summarised in Fig. 15.4).
Aknowledgeofanglesofanymagnitudeisneededwhen
ﬁnding, for example, all the angles between 0◦and 360◦
whose sine is, say, 0.3261. If 0.3261 is entered into a cal-
culator and then the inverse sine key pressed (or sin −1
key) the answer 19.03◦appears. However, there is a
second angle between 0◦and 360◦which the calcula-
tor does not give. Sine is also positive in the second
quadrant (either from CAST or from Fig. 15.1(a)). The
other angle is shown in Fig. 15.5 as angle θ where
θ =180◦−19.03◦=160.97◦. Thus 19.03◦and 160.97◦
are the angles between 0◦and 360◦whose sine is 0.3261
(check that sin160.97◦= 0.3261 on your calculator).

Be careful! Your calculator only gives you one of these
answers. The second answer needs to be deduced from
a knowledge of angles of any magnitude, as shown in
the following problems.
Problem 1.
Determine all the angles between 0◦
and 360◦whose sine is −0.4638
The angles whose sine is −0.4638 occurs in the
third and fourth quadrants since sine is negative in
these quadrants (see Fig. 15.6(a)). From Fig. 15.6(b),
θ =sin−1 0.4638=27◦38′
Measured from 0◦, the two angles between 0◦and
360◦whose sine is −0.4638 are 180◦+27◦38′, i.e.
207◦38′ and 360◦−27◦38′, i.e. 332◦22′. (Note that
a calculator generally only gives one answer, i.e.
−27.632588◦)
Problem 2.
Determine all the angles between 0◦
and 360◦whose tangent is 1.7629
A tangent is positive in the ﬁrst and third quad-
rants
(see
Fig.
15.7(a)).
From
Fig.

θ =tan−1 1.7629=60◦26′. Measured from 0◦, the two

15.3 The production of a sine and
cosine wave
In Fig. 15.10, let OR be a vector 1 unit long and free
to rotate anticlockwise about O. In one revolution a
circle is produced and is shown with 15◦sectors. Each
radius arm has a vertical and a horizontal component.
For example, at 30◦, the vertical component is TS and
the horizontal component is OS.
From trigonometric ratios,
sin30◦= TS
TO = TS
1 ,i.e. TS = sin30◦
andcos30◦= OS
TO = OS
1 ,i.e. OS = cos30◦
The vertical component TS may be projected across to
T ′S′, which is the corresponding value of 30◦on the
graph of y against angle x ◦. If all such vertical compo-
nents as TS are projected onto the graph, then a sine
wave is produced as shown in Fig. 15.10.
If all horizontal components such as OS are pro-
jected onto a graph of y against angle x ◦, then a
cosine wave is produced. It is easier to visualise these
projections by redrawing the circle with the radius
arm OR initially in a vertical position, as shown in
Fig. 15.11.

Periodic functions and period
(i)
Each of the graphs shown in Figs. 15.12 to 15.15
will repeat themselves as angle A increases and
are thus called periodic functions.
(ii)
y =sinA and y =cosA repeat themselves every
360◦(or 2π radians); thus 360◦is called the
period of these waveforms. y =sin2A and
y =cos2A repeat themselves every 180◦(or
π radians); thus 180◦is the period of these
waveforms.
(iii)
In general, if y =sinpA or y =cospA (where p
is a constant) then the period of the waveform is
360◦/p (or 2π/prad). Hence if y =sin3A then
the period is 360/3, i.e. 120◦, and if y =cos4A
then the period is 360/4, i.e. 90◦
Amplitude
Amplitude is the name given to the maximum or peak
value of a sine wave. Each of the graphs shown in
Figs. 15.12 to 15.15 has an amplitude of +1 (i.e. they
oscillate between +1 and −1). However, if y =4sinA,
each of the values in the table is multiplied by 4 and the
maximum value, and thus amplitude, is 4. Similarly,
if y =5cos2A, the amplitude is 5 and the period is
360◦/2, i.e. 180◦.

by y =sin(A±α) or y =cos(A±α) where α
is a phase displacement compared with y =sinA
or y =cosA.

By drawing up a table of values, a graph of
y =sin(A−60◦) may be plotted as shown in
Fig. 15.20. If y =sinA is assumed to start at 0◦
then y =sin(A−60◦) starts 60◦later (i.e. has a
zero value 60◦later). Thus y =sin(A−60◦) is
said to lag y =sinA by 60◦.

Sinusoidal form A sin (ωt ± α)
In Fig. 15.29, let OR represent a vector that is free to
rotate anticlockwise about O at a velocity of ωrad/s.
A rotating vector is called a phasor. After a time
t seconds OR will have turned through an angle
ωt radians (shown as angle TOR in Fig. 15.29). If ST is
constructed perpendicular to OR, then sinωt =ST/TO,
i.e. ST =TO sinωt.
If all such vertical components are projected onto a
graph of y against ωt, a sine wave results of amplitude
OR (as shown in Section 15.3).
If phasor OR makes one revolution (i.e. 2π radians)
in T seconds, then the angular velocity,

Amplitude is the name given to the maximum or peak
value of a sine wave, as explained in Section 15.3. The
amplitude of the sine wave shown in Fig. 15.29 is 1.
A sine or cosine wave may not always start at 0◦.
To show this a periodic function is represented by
y =sin(ωt ±α) or y =cos(ωt ±α), where α is a phase
displacement compared with y =sinA or y =cosA.
A graph of y =sin(ωt −α) lags y =sinωt by angle
α, and a graph of y =sin(ωt +α) leads y =sinωt by
angle α.

Hence

i.e.

15.6 Harmonic synthesis with
complex waveforms
A waveform that is not sinusoidal is called a complex
wave. Harmonic analysis is the process of resolving a
complex periodic waveform into a series of sinusoidal
components of ascending order of frequency. Many of
the waveforms met in practice can be represented by the
following mathematical expression.
v = V1msin(ωt + α1) + V2msin(2ωt + α2)
+ ··· + Vnmsin(nωt + αn)
and the magnitude of their harmonic components
together with their phase may be calculated using
Fourier series (see Chapters 73 to 76). Numerical
methods are used to analyse waveforms for which
simple mathematical expressions cannot be obtained.
A numerical method of harmonic analysis is explained
in Chapter 77 on page 801. In a laboratory, waveform
analysis may be performed using a waveform analyser
which produces a direct readout ofthecomponent waves
present in a complex wave.
By adding the instantaneous values of the fundamen-
tal and progressive harmonics of a complex wave for
given instants in time, the shape of a complex waveform
can be gradually built up. This graphical procedure is
known as harmonic synthesis (synthesis meaning ‘the
putting together of parts or elements so as to make up a
complexwhole’).Formoreontheadditionofalternating
waveforms, see Chapter 27.
Some examples of harmonic synthesis are con-
sidered in the following worked problems.
Problem 17.
Use harmonic synthesis to construct
the complex voltage given by:
v1 = 100sinωt + 30sin3ωt volts.
The waveform is made up of a fundamental wave of
maximum value 100V and frequency, f =ω/2π hertz
and a third harmonic component of maximum value
30V and frequency=3ω/2π(=3f ), the fundamental
and third harmonics being initially in phase with each
other.
In Fig. 15.31, the fundamental waveform is shown
by the broken line plotted over one cycle, the periodic
time T being 2π/ωseconds. On the same axis is plotted
30sin3ωt, shown by the dotted line, having a maximum
value of 30V and for which three cycles are completed
in time T seconds. At zero time, 30sin3ωt is in phase
with 100sinωt.
The fundamental and third harmonic are combinedby
adding ordinates at intervals to produce the waveform
for v1, as shown. For example, at time T/12seconds,
the fundamental has a value of 50V and the third har-
monic a value of 30V. Adding gives a value of 80V for
waveform v1 at time T/12seconds. Similarly, at time

T/4seconds, the fundamental has a value of 100V and
the third harmonic a value of −30V. After addition,
the resultant waveform v1 is 70V at T/4. The proce-
dure is continued between t =0 and t =T to produce
the complex waveform for v1. The negative half-cycle
of waveform v1 is seen to be identical in shape to the
positive half-cycle.
If further odd harmonics of the appropriate amplitude
and phase were added to v1 a good approximation to a
square wave would result.

volts.
The peak value of the fundamental is 100volts and the
peak value of the third harmonic is 30V. However, the
third harmonic has a phase displacement of π
2 radian
leading (i.e. leading 30sin3ωt by π
2 radian). Note that,
since the periodic time of the fundamental is T seconds,
the periodic time of the third harmonic is T/3seconds,
and a phase displacement of π
2 radian or 1
4 cycle of the
third harmonic represents a time interval of (T/3) ÷ 4,
i.e. T/12seconds.

over the time for one cycle of
the fundamental. When ordinates of the two graphs
are added at intervals, the resultant waveform v2 is
as shown. If the negative half-cycle in Fig. 15.32 is
reversed it can be seen that the shape of the positive
and negative half-cycles are identical.
Problems 17 and 18 demonstrate that whenever
odd harmonics are added to a fundamental waveform,
whether initially in phase with each other or not, the
positive and negative half-cycles of the resultant com-
plex wave are identical in shape. This is a feature
of waveforms containing the fundamental and odd
harmonics.
Problem 19.
Use harmonic synthesis to construct
the complex current given by:
i1 = 10sinωt + 4sin2ωt amperes.
Current i1 consists of a fundamental component,
10sinωt, and a second harmonic component, 4sin2ωt,
the components being initially in phase with each other.
The fundamental and second harmonic are shown plot-
ted separately in Fig. 15.33. By adding ordinates at
intervals, the complex waveform representing i1 is pro-
duced as shown. It is noted that if all the values in the
negative half-cycle were reversed then this half-cycle
wouldappearasamirrorimageofthepositivehalf-cycle

and a second harmonic of amplitude 20mA, lag-

The effect of the d.c. component is to shift the whole

Problem 22.
A complex waveform v comprises a
fundamental voltage of 240V rms and frequency
50Hz, together with a 20% third harmonic which
has a phase angle lagging by 3π/4rad at time t =0.
(a) Write down an expression to represent voltage
v. (b) Use harmonic synthesis to sketch the
complex waveform representing voltage v over one
cycle of the fundamental component.
(a)
A fundamental voltage having an rms value of
240V has a maximum value, or amplitude of
√
2 (240), i.e. 339.4V.
If the fundamental frequency is 50Hz then
angular velocity, ω=2πf =2π(50)=100π rad/s.
Hence the fundamental voltage is represented
by 339.4sin100πt volts. Since the fundamen-
tal frequency is 50Hz, the time for one cycle
of the fundamental is given by T =1/f =1/50s
or 20ms.
The third harmonic has an amplitude equal to 20%
of 339.4V, i.e. 67.9V. The frequency of the third
harmonic component is 3 × 50=150Hz, thus the
angular velocity is 2π(150), i.e.300π rad/s. Hence

Chapter 16
Hyperbolic functions
Why it is important to understand: Hyperbolic functions
There are two combinations of ex and e−x which are used so often in engineering that they are given
their own name. They are the hyperbolic sine, sinh, and the hyperbolic cosine, cosh. They are of interest
because they have many properties analogous to those of trigonometric functions and because they arise
in the study of falling bodies, hanging cables, ocean waves, and many other phenomena in science and
engineering. The shape of a chain hanging under gravity is well described by cosh x and the deformation
of uniform beams can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic tangents. Other applications of hyperbolic
functions are found in ﬂuid dynamics, optics, heat, mechanical engineering, and in astronomy when
dealing with the curvature of light in the presence of black holes.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a hyperbolic function
•
state practical applications of hyperbolic functions
•
deﬁne sinh x, cosh x, tanh x, cosechx, sechx and coth x
•
evaluate hyperbolic functions
•
sketch graphs of hyperbolic functions
•
state Osborne’s rule
•
prove simple hyperbolic identities
•
solve equations involving hyperbolic functions
•
derive the series expansions for cosh x and sinh x
16.1 Introduction to hyperbolic
functions
Functions which are associated with the geometry of
the conic section called a hyperbola are called hyper-
bolic functions. Applications of hyperbolic functions
include transmission line theory and catenary problems.
By deﬁnition:

Hyperbolic sine of x,
sinh x= ex −e−x

(1)
‘sinhx’ is often abbreviated to ‘shx’ and is
pronounced as ‘shine x’
(ii)
Hyperbolic cosine of x,
cosh x= ex +e−x
2
(2)
‘coshx’ is often abbreviated to ‘chx’ and is
pronounced as ‘kosh x’
(iii)
Hyperbolic tangent of x,
tanh x= sinh x
cosh x = ex −e−x
ex +e−x

Some properties of hyperbolic functions
Replacing x by 0 in equation (1) gives:
sinh0 = e0 −e−0

= 1 −1
2
= 0
Replacing x by 0 in equation (2) gives:
cosh0 = e0 + e−0
2
= 1 + 1
2
= 1
If a function of x, f (−x)=−f (x), then f (x) is called
an odd function of x. Replacing x by −x in equation(1)
gives:
sinh(−x) = e−x −e−(−x)
2

Replacing x by −x in equation (3) gives:
tanh(−x) = e−x −e−(−x)
e−x + e−(−x) = e−x −ex
e−x + ex
= −
ex −e−x
ex + e−x

Hence sinh x and tanhx are both odd functions
(see Section 16.1), as also are cosechx

If a function of x, f (−x) = f (x), then f (x) is
called an even function of x. Replacing x by −x in
equation (2) gives:
cosh(−x) = e−x + e−(−x)
2
= e−x + ex

Hence coshx is an even function (see Section 16.2), as

actually possess sinh and cosh functions; however, if
a calculator does not contain these functions, then the

Graphs of hyperbolic functions
A graph of y=sinhx may be plotted using calcula-
tor values of hyperbolic functions. The curve is shown
in Fig. 16.1. Since the graph is symmetrical about
the origin, sinhx is an odd function (as stated in
Section 16.1).
A graph of y=coshx may be plotted using cal-
culator values of hyperbolic functions. The curve is
shown in Fig. 16.2. Since the graph is symmetrical
about the y-axis, coshx is an even function (as stated
in Section 16.1). The shape of y = coshx is that of a
heavy rope or chain hanging freely under gravity and is
called a catenary.Examples include transmission lines,
a telegraph wire or a ﬁsherman’s line, and is used in
the design of roofs and arches. Graphs of y = tanhx,

Hyperbolic identities
For every trigonometric identity there is a corres-
ponding hyperbolic identity. Hyperbolic identities may
be proved by either
(i)
replacing
shx
by
ex −e−x
2
and
chx
by
ex +e−x
2
, or
(ii)
by using Osborne’s rule, which states: ‘the six
trigonometric ratios used in trigonometrical iden-
tities relating general angles may be replaced by
their corresponding hyperbolic functions, but the
sign of any direct or implied product of two sines
must be changed’.
For
example,
since
cos2 x + sin2 x =1
then,
by
Osborne’s rule, ch2 x −sh2 x =1, i.e. the trigonomet-
ric functions have been changed to their corresponding
hyperbolicfunctions and since sin2 x is a product of two
sines the sign is changed from + to −. Table 16.1 shows
some trigonometric identities and their corresponding
hyperbolic identities.

(a) ch2A=ch2 A+sh2 A
(b) 1−th2 x =sech2 x
(a)
From trigonometric ratios,
cos2A = cos2 A −sin2 A
(1)
Osborne’s rule states that trigonometric ratios
may be replaced by their corresponding hyper-
bolic functions but the sign of any product
of two sines has to be changed. In this case,
sin2 A=(sinA)(sinA), i.e. a product of two sines,
thus the sign of the correspondinghyperbolic func-
tion, sh2A, is changed from + to −. Hence, from
(1), ch2A=ch2 A+sh2 A
(b)
From trigonometric ratios,
1 + tan2 x = sec2 x
(2)
and tan2 x = sin2 x
cos2 x = (sinx)(sinx)
cos2 x
i.e. a product of two sines.
Hence, in equation (2), the trigonometric ratios
are changed to their equivalent hyperbolic func-
tion and the sign of th2x changed + to −, i.e.

With reference to the graph of y = sechx in Fig. 16.4, it
can be seen that there will be two values corresponding
to y = sechx = 0.4562
Hence, x = ±1.421

y = 40 ch x
40. Determine, correct to 4 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures, (a) the value of y when x is 25, and (b) the
value of x when y = 54.30
(a)
y = 40 ch x
40, and when x = 25,
y = 40 ch 25
40 = 40 ch 0.625
= 40(1.2017536...) = 48.07
(b)
When y =54.30,54.30=40ch x
40, from which
ch x
40 = 54.30

is±) from which, x = 40(±0.822219....) = ±32.89
Equations of the form achx+bshx=c, where a, b and
c are constants may be solved either by:
(a)
plotting graphs of y =a chx +bshx and y =c
and noting the points of intersection, or more
accurately,
(b)
by adopting the following procedure:
(i)
Change shx to

and chx to

(ii)
Rearrange the equation into the form
pex +qe−x +r =0, where p, q and r are
constants.
(iii)
Multiply each term by e x, which produces
an equation of the form p(e x)2+rex+
q =0 (since (e−x)(ex)=e0 =1)
(iv)
Solve the quadratic equationp(ex)2 +rex+
q =0 for ex by factorising or by using the
quadratic formula.
(v)
Given ex =a constant (obtained by solv-

logarithms of both sides to give
x = ln(constant)

Chapter 17
Trigonometric identities
and equations
Why it is important to understand: Trigonometric identities and equations
In engineering, trigonometric identities occur often, examples being in the more advanced areas of calcu-
lus to generate derivatives and integrals, with tensors/vectors, and with differential equations and partial
differential equations. One of the skills required for more advanced work in mathematics, especially in
calculus, is the ability to use identities to write expressions in alternative forms. In software engineering,
working, say, on the next big blockbuster ﬁlm, trigonometric identities are needed for computer graphics;
an RF engineer working on the next-generation mobile phone will also need trigonometric identities. In
addition, identities are needed in electrical engineering when dealing with a.c. power, and wave addi-
tion/subtraction and the solutions of trigonometric equations often require knowledge of trigonometric
identities.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state simple trigonometric identities
•
prove simple identities
•
solve equations of the form bsin A + c = 0
•
solve equations of the form a sin2 A + c = 0
•
solve equations of the form a sin2 A + bsinA + c = 0
•
solve equations requiring trigonometric identities

With trigonometricidentities it is necessary to start with
the left-hand side (LHS) and attempt to make it equal to

to change all of the trigonometric ratios into sines and
cosines where possible. Thus,

Trigonometric equations
Equations which contain trigonometric ratios are called
trigonometric equations. There are usually an inﬁnite
number of solutions to such equations; however, solu-
tions are often restricted to those between 0◦and 360◦.
A knowledge of angles of any magnitude is essential
in the solution of trigonometric equations and calcula-
tors cannot be relied upon to give all the solutions (as
shown in Chapter 15). Fig. 17.2 shows a summary for
angles of any magnitude.

Trigonometric identities and equations

If either a or c is a negative number, then the
value within the square root sign is positive.
Since when a square root is taken there is a pos-
itive and negative answer there are four values
of A between 0◦and 360◦which satisfy such an
equation,provided−1 ≤c
a ≤1(seeProblems10
and 11).
(iii)
When a, b and c are all non-zero:
a sin2 A+bsinA+c=0 is a quadratic equation
in which the unknown is sinA. The solution of
a quadratic equation is obtained either by fac-
torising (if possible) or by using the quadratic
formula:
sin A = −b ±

(see Problems 12 and 13).
(iv)
Often the trigonometric identities
cos2 A+sin2 A=1,
1+tan2 A=sec2 A
and
cot2 A+1=cosec 2A need to be used to reduce
equations to one of the above forms (see
Problems 14 to 16).

Hence θ = sin−1(−0.6000). Sine is negative in the third
and fourth quadrants (see Fig. 17.3). The acute angle
sin−1(0.6000)=36.87◦(shown as α in Fig. 17.3(b)).
Hence,

Problem 12.
Solve the equation
8sin2 θ + 2sinθ −1 = 0,
for all values of θ between 0◦and 360◦.
Factorising 8sin2 θ +2sinθ −1=0 gives
(4sinθ −1) (2sinθ +1)=0
Hence 4sinθ −1=0, from which, sinθ = 1
4 = 0.2500
or 2sinθ +1=0, from which, sinθ =−1
2 = −0.5000
(Instead of factorising, the quadratic formula can, of
course, be used.)
θ = sin−1 0.2500=14.48◦or 165.52◦, since sine
is positive in the ﬁrst and second quadrants, or
θ = sin−1(−0.5000)=210◦or 330◦, since sine is neg-
ative in the third and fourth quadrants.
Hence θ = 14.48◦,165.52◦,210◦or 330◦
Problem 13.
Solve 6cos2 θ +5cosθ −6=0 for
values of θ from 0◦to 360◦
Factorising 6cos2 θ +5cosθ −6=0 gives
(3cosθ −2) (2cosθ +3)=0
Hence 3cosθ −2=0, from which, cosθ = 2
3 = 0.6667
or 2cosθ +3=0, from which, cosθ = −3
2 =−1.5000
The minimum value of a cosine is −1, hence the lat-
ter expression has no solution and is thus neglected.
Hence,
θ = cos−1 0.6667 = 48.18◦or 311.82◦
since cosine is positive in the ﬁrst and fourth quadrants.

Sincecos2 t + sin2 t =1,cos2 t =1−sin2 t.Substituting
for cos2 t in 5cos2 t +3sint −3=0 gives:

5 −5sin2 t + 3sint −3 = 0
−5sin2 t + 3sint + 2 = 0

6 = 0.5000
or 3tanA+1=0, from which, tanA= −1

Thus A= tan−1(0.5000)=26.57◦or 206.57◦, since
tangent is positive in the ﬁrst and third quadrants, or
A= tan−1(−0.3333)=161.57◦or 341.57◦, since tan-

Hence, A= 26.57◦,161.57◦,206.57◦or 341.57◦

3(cot2 θ + 1) −5 = 4cotθ
3cot2 θ + 3 −5 = 4cotθ
3cot2 θ −4cotθ −2 = 0

The relationship between
trigonometric and
hyperbolic functions
Why it is important to understand: The relationship between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions
There are similarities between notations used for hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. Both trigono-
metric and hyperbolic functions have applications in many areas of engineering.For example, the shape of
a chain hanging under gravity (known as a catenary curve) is described by the hyperbolic cosine, cosh x,
and the deformation of uniform beams can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic tangents. Hyperbolic
functions are also used in electrical engineering applications such as transmission line theory. Einstein’s
special theory of relativity used hyperbolic functions and both trigonometric and hyperbolic functions
are needed for certain areas of more advanced integral calculus. There are many identities showing rela-
tionships between hyperbolic and trigonometric functions; these may be used to evaluate trigonometric
and hyperbolic functions of complex numbers.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
identify the relationship between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions
•

Problem 1.
Verify that cos2 jθ + sin2 jθ =1
From equation (5), cosjθ = coshθ, and from equa-
tion (6), sinjθ =j sinhθ
Thus,
cos2 jθ + sin2 jθ = cosh2 θ +j2 sinh2 θ,
and
since j 2 =−1,
cos2 jθ + sin2 jθ = cosh2 θ −sinh2 θ
But from Chapter 16, Problem 6,

Two methods are commonly used to verify hyperbolic
identities. These are (a) by substituting jθ (and jφ) in

The relationship between trigonometric and hyperbolic functions

[An examination of Problems 3 to 5 shows that when-
ever the trigonometric identity contains a term which
is the product of two sines, or the implied product
of two sines (e.g. tan2 θ = sin2 θ/cos2 θ, thus tan2 θ is
the implied product of two sines), the sign of the cor-
responding term in the hyperbolic function changes.
This relationship between trigonometric and hyperbolic
functions is known as Osborne’s rule, as discussed in
Chapter 16, page 184].

Chapter 19
Compound angles
Why it is important to understand: Compound angles
It is often necessary to rewrite expressions involving sines, cosines and tangents in alternative forms. To
do this formulae known as trigonometric identities are used as explained previously. Compound angle
(or sum and difference) formulae, and double angles are further commonly used identities. Compound
angles are required, for example, in the analysis of acoustics (where a beat is an interference between two
sounds of slightly different frequencies), and with phase detectors (which is a frequency mixer, analogue
multiplier, or logic circuit that generates a voltage signal which represents the difference in phase between
two signal inputs). Many rational functions of sine and cosine are difﬁcult to integrate without compound
angle formulae.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state compound angle formulae for sin(A ± B), cos(A ± B) and tan(A ± B)
•
convert a sin ωt + bcosωt into R sin(ωt + α)
•
derive double angle formulae
•
change products of sines and cosines into sums or differences
•
change sums or differences of sines and cosines into products
•
develop expressions for power in a.c. circuits – purely resistive, inductive and capacitive circuits, R–L and
R–C circuits
19.1
Compound angle formulae
An
electric
current
i
may
be
expressed
as
i = 5sin(ωt −0.33) amperes. Similarly, the displace-
ment x of a body from a ﬁxed point can be expressed
as x =10sin(2t +0.67) metres. The angles (ωt −0.33)
and (2t +0.67) are called compound angles because
they are the sum or difference of two angles. The
compound angle formulae for sines and cosines of the
sum and difference of two angles A and B are:
sin(A + B) = sinAcosB + cosAsinB
sin(A −B) = sinAcosB −cosAsinB
cos(A + B) = cosAcosB −sinAsinB
cos(A −B) = cosAcosB + sinAsinB
(Note, sin(A+B) is not equal to (sinA+ sinB), and
so on.)
The formulae stated above may be used to derive two
further compound angle formulae:
tan(A + B) = tanA + tanB
1 −tanAtanB
tan(A −B) = tanA −tanB
1 + tanAtanB
The compound angle formulae are true for all values of
A and B, and by substituting values of A and B into the
formulae they may be shown to be true.

Since sinP =0.8142 then

Thus cosP = cos54.51◦=0.5806 and

19.2 Conversion of a sin ωt + b cos ωt
into R sin(ωt + α)
(i)
R sin(ωt + α) represents a sine wave of maxi-
mum value R, periodic time 2π/ω, frequency
ω/2π and leading R sinωt by angle α (see
Chapter 15).
(ii)
R sin(ωt +α) may be expanded using the com-
pound angle formula for sin(A+B), where
A=ωt and B =α. Hence,
R sin(ωt +α)
= R[sinωt cosα + cosωt sinα]
= R sinωt cosα + R cosωt sinα
= (R cosα)sinωt + (R sinα)cosωt
(iii)
If a =R cosα and b=R sinα, where a and
b are constants, then R sin(ωt +α)=a sinωt +

If the values of a and b are known then the values

Find an expression for
3sinωt +4cosωt in the form R sin(ωt +α) and
sketch graphs of 3sinωt, 4cosωt and R sin(ωt +α)

Let 3sinωt +4cosωt =R sin(ωt +α)
then 3sinωt +4cosωt
= R[sinωt cosα + cosωt sinα]
= (R cosα)sinωt + (R sinα)cosωt
Equating coefﬁcients of sinωt gives:
3 = R cosα, from which,cosα = 3
R
Equating coefﬁcients of cosωt gives:
4 = R sinα, from which,sinα = 4

There is only one quadrant where both sinα and cosα

A sketch of 3sinωt, 4cosωt and 5sin(ωt +0.927) is

then 4.6sinωt −7.3cosωt

Express −2.7sinωt −4.1cosωt in

Let −2.7sinωt −4.1cosωt =R sin(ωt +α)
= R[sinωt cosα + cosωt sinα]
= (R cosα)sinωt + (R sinα)cosωt
Equating coefﬁcients gives:

Hence α =180◦+56.63◦=236.63◦or 4.130 radians.
Thus,
−2.7sinωt −4.1cosωt = 4.909sin(ωt +4.130)
An angle of 236.63◦is the same as −123.37◦or
−2.153 radians. Hence −2.7sinωt −4.1cosωt may
be expressed also as 4.909sin(ωt −2.153), which is
preferred since it is the principal value (i.e. −π ≤
α ≤π)

Equating coefﬁcients gives:
3 = R cosα,from which, cosα = 3

or
θ = 136.68◦−59.03◦= 77.65◦
Since −15.71◦is the same as −15.71◦+360◦, i.e.
344.29◦, then the solutions are θ =77.65◦or 344.29◦,
which may be checked by substituting into the original

Let 3.5cosA−5.8sinA=R sin(A+α)

Hence

Thus A = 73.65◦−148.88◦= −75.23◦

or
A = 106.35◦−148.88◦= −42.53◦

two further formula for cos2A can be produced.
Thus

Power waveforms in a.c. circuits
(a) Purely resistive a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a cir-
cuit comprising resistance only. The resulting current
is i =Im sinωt, and the corresponding instantaneous
power, p, is given by:
p = vi = (Vm sinωt)(Im sinωt)
i.e. p = VmIm sin2 ωt
From double angle formulae of Section 19.3,
cos2A = 1 −2sin2 A, from which,
sin2 A = 1
2(1 −cos2A) thus
sin2 ωt = 1
2(1 −cos2ωt)
Then power p = VmIm

2(l −cos2ωt)

i.e.
p = 1
2V mI m(1 −cos2ωt)
The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Fig. 19.8. The
waveform of power repeats itself after π/ω seconds and
hence the power has a frequency twice that of voltage
and current. The power is always positive, havinga max-
imum value of VmIm. The average or mean value of the
power is 1

Also, power P =I 2R or V 2/R as for a d.c. circuit, since

a.c. circuit given by
P = VI = I 2R = V 2

where V and I are rms values.
(b) Purely inductive a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a circuit con-
taining pure inductance (theoretical case). The resulting
current is i =Im sin

ωt −π
2

since current lags voltage
by π
2 radians or 90◦in a purely inductive circuit, and
the corresponding instantaneous power, p, is given by:
p = vi = (Vm sinωt)Im sin

ωt −π

i.e. p = VmIm sinωt sin

ωt −π


However,
sin

ωt −π


= −cosωt thus
p = −VmIm sinωt cosωt
Rearranging gives:
p = −1
2VmIm(2sinωt cosωt)
However, from double angle formulae,
2sinωt cosωt = sin2ωt.
Thus
power, p=−1
2V mI m sin2ωt
The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Fig. 19.9.
The frequency of power is twice that of voltage and
current. For the power curveshown in Fig. 19.9,the area
above the horizontal axis is equal to the area below, thus
over a complete cycle the average power P is zero. It
is noted that when v and i are both positive, power p is
positive and energy is delivered from the source to the
inductance; when v and i have opposite signs, power p
is negative and energy is returned from the inductance
to the source.

In general, when the current through an inductance is
increasing, energy is transferred from the circuit to the
magnetic ﬁeld, but this energy is returned when the
current is decreasing.
Summarising, the averagepower P in a purely induc-
tive a.c. circuit is zero.
(c) Purely capacitive a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a circuit
containing pure capacitance. The resulting current is
i =Im sinωt + π
2
, since current leads voltage by 90◦
in a purely capacitive circuit, and the corresponding
instantaneous power, p, is given by:
p = vi = (Vm sinωt)Im sin

i.e. p = VmIm sinωt sin

ωt + π

However,
sin

thus
p = VmIm sinωt cosωt
Rearranging gives
p= 1
2VmIm(2sinωt cosωt)
Thus power, p= 1
2V mI m sin2ωt.
The waveforms of v, i and p are shown in Fig. 19.10.
Over a complete cycle the average power P is zero.
When the voltage across a capacitor is increasing,
energy is transferred from the circuit to the electric
ﬁeld, but this energy is returned when the voltage is
decreasing.
Summarising,the average power P in a purely capac-
itive a.c. circuit is zero.
(d) R–L or R–C a.c. circuits
Let a voltage v =Vm sinωt be applied to a cir-
cuit containing resistance and inductance or resis-
tance and capacitance. Let the resulting current be
i =Im sin(ωt +φ), where phase angle φ will be posi-
tive for an R–C circuit and negative for an R–L circuit.
The corresponding instantaneous power, p, is given by:
p = vi = (Vm sinωt)Im sin(ωt + φ)
i.e. p = VmIm sinωt sin(ωt + φ)
Products of sine functions may be changed into differ-
ences of cosine functions as shown in Section 19.4,
i.e. sinAsinB =−1
2[cos(A+B)−cos(A−B)]
Substituting ωt =A and (ωt +φ)=B gives:
power,
p = VmIm{−1
2[cos(ωt + ωt + φ)
−cos(ωt −(ωt + φ))]}
i.e.
p = 1
2VmIm[cos(−φ) −cos(2ωt + φ)]
However, cos(−φ)= cosφ
Thus p = 1
2V mI m[cosφ −cos(2ωt + φ)]
The instantaneous power p thus consists of

The waveforms of v, i and p, are shown in Fig. 19.11
for an R–L circuit. The waveform of power is seen to
pulsate at twice the supply frequency. The areas of the
power curve (shown shaded) above the horizontal time
axis represent power supplied to the load; the small
areas below the axis represent power being returned to
the supply from the inductance as the magnetic ﬁeld
collapses.
A similar shape of power curve is obtained for an
R–C circuit, the small areas below the horizontal axis
representing power being returned to the supply from
the charged capacitor. The difference between the areas
above and below the horizontal axis represents the heat
loss due to the circuit resistance. Since power is dissi-
pated only in a pure resistance, the alternative equations
for power, P =I 2
RR, may be used, where IR is the rms
current ﬂowing through the resistance.
Summarising, the average power P in a circuit
containing resistance and inductance and/or capaci-
tance, whether in series or in parallel, is given by
P =VI cosφ or P = I 2
RR (V,I and IR being rms
values).

Functions and their curves
Why it is important to understand: Functions and their curves
Engineers use many basic mathematical functions to represent, say, the input/output of systems – linear,
quadratic, exponential, sinusoidal, and so on, and knowledge of these is needed to determine how these
are used to generate some of the more unusual input/output signals such as the square wave, saw-tooth
wave and fully rectiﬁed sine wave. Periodic functions are used throughout engineering and science to
describe oscillations, waves and other phenomena that exhibit periodicity. Graphs and diagrams provide
a simple and powerful approach to a variety of problems that are typical to computer science in general,
and software engineering in particular; graphical transformations have many applications in software
engineering problems. Understanding of continuous and discontinuous functions, odd and even functions,
and inverse functions are helpful in this – it’s all part of the ‘language of engineering’.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise standard curves and their equations – straight line, quadratic, cubic, trigonometric, circle, ellipse,
hyperbola, rectangular hyperbola, logarithmic function, exponential function and polar curves
•
perform simple graphical transformations
•
deﬁne a periodic function
•
deﬁne continuous and discontinuous functions
•
deﬁne odd and even functions
•
deﬁne inverse functions
•
determine asymptotes
•
sketch curves
20.1
Standard curves
When a mathematical equation is known, co-ordinates
may be calculated for a limited range of values, and
the equation may be represented pictorially as a graph,
within this range of calculated values. Sometimes it
is useful to show all the characteristic features of an
equation, and in this case a sketch depicting the equa-
tion can be drawn, in which all the important features
are shown, but the accurate plotting of points is less
important. This technique is called ‘curve sketching’
and can involve the use of differential calculus, with,
for example, calculations involving turning points.
If,say,y dependson,say,x,thenyissaidtobeafunction
of x and the relationship is expressed as y =f (x); x is
called the independent variable and y is the dependent
variable.
In engineering and science, corresponding values are
obtained as a result of tests or experiments.
Here is a brief resumé of standard curves,some of which
have been met earlier in this text.

For each point (x1, y1) on the graph of y =f (x) there
exists a point (x1, ay1) on the graph of y =af (x).
Thus the graph of y =af (x) can be obtained by
stretching y = f (x) parallel to the y-axis by a scale
factor ‘a’

ple, if f (x)=x, y = f (x)+3 becomes y =x +3, as
shown in Fig. 20.14(a). Similarly, if f (θ)= cosθ,
then y = f (θ)+2 becomes y = cosθ +2, as shown in
Fig. 20.14(b). Also, if f (x)=x 2, then y = f (x)+3
becomes y =x2 +3, as shown in Fig. 20.14(c).

Periodic functions
A function f (x) is said to be periodic if f (x +T )=
f (x) for all values of x, where T is some positive
number. T is the interval between two successive repe-
titions and is called the period of the function f (x). For
example, y = sinx is periodic in x with period 2π since
sinx = sin(x +2π)= sin(x +4π), and so on. Similarly,
y = cosx is a periodic function with period 2π since
cosx = cos(x +2π)= cos(x +4π), and so on. In gen-
eral, if y = sinωt or y = cosωt then the period of the
waveform is 2π/ω. The function shown in Fig. 20.24 is
also periodic of period 2π and is deﬁned by:

20.4 Continuous and discontinuous
functions
If a graph of a function has no sudden jumps or breaks it
is called a continuous function, examples being the
graphs of sine and cosine functions. However, other
graphs make ﬁnite jumps at a point or points in the

Section C

interval. The square wave shown in Fig. 20.24 has ﬁnite
discontinuities as x =π, 2π, 3π, and so on, and is
therefore a discontinuous function. y = tanx is another
example of a discontinuous function.
20.5
Even and odd functions
Even functions
A function y =f (x) is said to be even if f (−x)=f (x)
for all values of x. Graphs of even functions are always
symmetrical about the y-axis (i.e. is a mirror image).

Odd functions
A function y =f (x) is said to be odd if f (−x)=−f (x)
for all values of x. Graphs of odd functions are
always symmetrical about the origin. Two examples
of odd functions are y =x 3 and y = sinx as shown in
Fig. 20.26.
Many functions are neither even nor odd, two such
examples being shown in Fig. 20.27.

Inverse functions
If y is a function of x, the graph of y against x can be
used to ﬁnd x when any value of y is given. Thus the

Section C
230
Higher Engineering Mathematics
graph also expresses that x is a function of y. Two such
functions are called inverse functions.
In general, given a function y =f (x), its inverse may
be obtained by interchanging the roles of x and y and
then transposing for y. The inverse function is denoted
by y =f −1(x).
For example, if y =2x +1, the inverse is obtained by
(i)
transposing for x, i.e. x = y −1
2
= y
2 −1
2 and
(ii)
interchanging x and y, giving the inverse as
y = x
2 −1
2
Thus if f (x)=2x +1, then f −1(x)= x
2 −1
2
A
graph
of
f (x)=2x +1
and
its
inverse
f −1(x)= x
2 −1
2 is shown in Fig. 20.30 and f −1(x) is
seen to be a reﬂection of f (x) in the line y =x
Similarly, if y = x2, the inverse is obtained by
(i)
transposing for x, i.e. x =±√y and
(ii)
interchanging x
and y, giving the inverse
y =±√x
Hence the inverse has two values for every value of x.
Thus f (x)=x2 does not have a single inverse. In
such a case the domain of the original function may
be restricted to y =x2 for x >0. Thus the inverse is
then y =+√x. A graph of f (x)=x2 and its inverse
f −1(x)=√x forx >0 isshowninFig.20.31and,again,
f −1(x) is seen to be a reﬂectionoff(x) in the line y=x.
It is noted from the latter example, that not all func-
tions have an inverse. An inverse, however, can be
determined if the range is restricted.

Problem 5.
Determine the inverse for each of the
following functions:
(a) f (x)=x −1
(b) f (x)=x2 −4 (x >0)
(c) f (x)=x2 +1
(a)
If y = f (x), then y =x −1
Transposing for x gives x =y +1
Interchanging x and y gives y =x +1
Hence if f (x)=x −1, then f−1(x)=x+1
(b)
If y = f (x), then y =x2 −4 (x >0)
Transposing for x gives x = √y +4
Interchanging x and y gives y = √x +4
Hence if f (x)=x2−4 (x >0) then
f−1(x)=√x+4 if x>−4
(c)
If y = f (x), then y =x2 +1
Transposing for x gives x = √y −1
Interchangingx andy givesy = √x −1,whichhas
two values.
Hence there is no inverse of f(x)=x2 +1, since
the domain of f (x) is not restricted.
Inverse trigonometric functions
If y = sinx, then x is the angle whose sine is y.
Inverse trigonometrical functions are denoted by pre-
ﬁxing the function with ‘arc’ or, more commonly, −1.
Hence transposing y = sinx for x gives x = sin−1 y.
Interchanging x and y gives the inverse y = sin−1 x.
Similarly,
y =cos−1 x,
y =tan−1 x,
y =sec−1 x,
y =cosec−1x and y =cot−1 x are all inverse trigono-
metric functions. The angle is always expressed in
radians.

Section C
Functions and their curves
231
Inverse trigonometric functions are periodic so it is nec-
essary to specify the smallest or principal value of the
angle. For sin−1 x, tan−1 x, cosec−1 x and cot−1 x, the
principal value is in the range −π
2 <y < π
2 . For cos−1 x
and sec−1 x the principal value is in the range 0<y <π.

up for various values of x and then y plotted against x,
the graph would be as shown in Fig. 20.32. The straight
lines AB, i.e. x =−1, and CD, i.e. y =1, are known as
asymptotes.

An asymptote to a curve is deﬁned as a straight
line to which the curve approaches as the distance
from the origin increases. Alternatively, an asymp-
tote can be considered as a tangent to the curve at
inﬁnity.
Asymptotes parallel to the x- and y-axes
There is a simple rule which enables asymptotes paral-
lel to the x- and y-axes to be determined. For a curve
y = f (x):
(i)
The asymptotes parallel to the x-axis are found by
equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of x
to zero.
(ii)
The asymptotes parallel to the y-axis are found by
equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of y
to zero.
With the above example y = x + 2
x + 1, rearranging gives:
y(x + 1) = x + 2
i.e.
yx + y −x −2 = 0
(1)
and
x(y −1) + y −2 = 0
The coefﬁcient of the highest power of x (in this case x 1)
is (y −1). Equating to zero gives: y −1=0
From which, y=1, which is an asymptote of y = x + 2
x + 1
as shown in Fig. 20.32.
Returning to equation (1):
yx + y −x −2 = 0
from which,
y(x + 1) −x −2 = 0
The coefﬁcient of the highest power of y (in this case y 1)
is (x +1). Equating to zero gives: x +1=0 from which,
x=−1, which is another asymptote of y = x + 2
x + 1 as
shown in Fig. 20.32.
Problem 8.
Determine the asymptotes for the
function y = x −3
2x + 1 and hence sketch the curve.

Section C
Functions and their curves
233
Rearranging y = x −3
2x + 1 gives: y(2x +1)=x −3
i.e.
2xy + y = x −3
or
2xy + y −x + 3 = 0
and x(2y −1) + y + 3 = 0
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of x to
zero gives: 2y −1=0 from which, y= 1
2 which is an
asymptote.
Since y(2x +1)=x −3 then equating the coefﬁcient of
the highest power of y to zero gives: 2x +1=0 from
which, x=−1
2 which is also an asymptote.
When x =0, y = x −3
2x + 1 = −3
1 = −3 and when y =0,
0= x −3
2x + 1 from which, x −3=0 and x =3.
A sketch of y = x −3
2x + 1 is shown in Fig. 20.33.
Problem 9.
Determine the asymptotes parallel to
the x- and y-axes for the function
x2y2 =9(x2+y2)
Asymptotes parallel to the x-axis:
Rearranging x2y2 =9(x2+y2) gives
x2y2 −9x2 −9y2 = 0
hence
x2(y2 −9) −9y2 = 0
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of xto zero
gives y2 −9=0 from which, y 2 =9 and y=±3
Asymptotes parallel to the y-axis:
Since x2y2 −9x2 −9y2 = 0
then
y2(x2 −9) −9x2 = 0
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of y to zero
gives x2 −9=0 from which, x 2 =9 and x=±3.
Hence asymptotes occur at y=±3 and x=±3
Other asymptotes
To determine asymptotes other than those parallel to
x- and y-axes a simple procedure is:
(i)
substitute y =mx +c in the given equation
(ii)
simplify the expression
(iii)
equate the coefﬁcients of the two highest powers
of x to zero and determine the values of m and c.
y =mx +c gives the asymptote.
Problem 10.
Determine the asymptotes for the
function: y(x +1)=(x −3)(x +2) and sketch the
curve.
Following the above procedure:
(i)
Substituting y =mx +c into
y(x +1)=(x −3) (x +2) gives:
(mx + c)(x + 1) = (x −3)(x + 2)
(ii)
Simplifying gives
mx2 + mx + cx + c = x2 −x −6
and (m−1)x2+(m+c+1)x +c+6=0
(iii)
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of
x to zero gives m−1=0 from which, m = 1
Equating the coefﬁcient of the next highest power
of x to zero gives m+c+1=0
and since m=1, 1+c+1=0 fromwhich, c=−2
Hence y =mx +c=1x −2.
i.e. y=x−2 is an asymptote.
To determine any asymptotes parallel to the x-axis:
Rearranging y(x + 1) = (x −3)(x + 2)
gives
yx + y = x2 −x −6
The coefﬁcient of the highest power of x (i.e. x 2) is 1.
Equating this to zero gives 1=0 which is not an equation
of a line. Hence there is no asymptote parallel to the
x-axis.
To determine any asymptotes parallel to the y-axis:
Since
y(x +1)=(x −3)(x +2)
the
coefﬁcient
of
the highest power of y is x +1. Equating this to
zero gives x +1=0, from which, x =−1. Hence x=−1
is an asymptote.
When x=0, y(1)=(−3)(2), i.e. y=−6
Wheny=0,0=(x −3)(x +2),i.e. x=3 and x=−2
A sketch of the function y(x +1)=(x −3)(x +2) is
shown in Fig. 20.34.
Problem 11.
Determine the asymptotes for the
function x3−xy2+2x −9=0

Substituting y =mx +c gives

Simplifying gives
x3 −x[m2x2 + 2mcx + c2] + 2x −9=0
i.e.
x3 −m2x3 −2mcx2 −c2x + 2x −9=0
and
x3(1 −m2) −2mcx2 −c2x + 2x −9=0
(iii)
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of x
(i.e. x3 in this case) to zero gives 1−m2 =0, from
which, m=±1
Equating the coefﬁcient of the next highest power
of x (i.e. x2 in this case) to zero gives −2mc=0,
from which, c=0
Hence y =mx +c=±1x +0, i.e. y=x and y=−x
are asymptotes.
To determine any asymptotes parallel to the x- and
y-axes for the function x 3 −xy2+2x −9=0:
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of x term
to zero gives 1=0 which is not an equation of a line.
Hence there is no asymptote parallel with the x-axis.
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power of y term
to zero gives −x =0 from which, x =0
Hence x=0, y=x and y= −x are asymptotes for the
function x3 −xy2 +2x−9=0
Problem 12.
Find the asymptotes for the function
y = x2 + 1
x
and sketch a graph of the function.
Rearranging y = x2 + 1
x
gives yx =x2 +1
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power x term to
zero gives 1=0, hence there is no asymptote parallel to
the x-axis.
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power y term to
zero gives x =0
Hence there is an asymptote at x=0 (i.e. the
y-axis)
To determine any other asymptotes we substitute
y =mx +c into yx =x2 +1 which gives
(mx + c)x = x2 + 1
i.e.
mx2 + cx = x2 + 1
and (m −1)x2 + cx −1 = 0
Equating the coefﬁcient of the highest power x term to
zero gives m−1=0, from which m=1
Equating the coefﬁcient of the next highest power xterm
to zero gives c=0. Hence y =mx +c=1x +0, i.e. y=x
is an asymptote.
A sketch of y = x2 + 1

It is possible to determine maximum/minimum points
on the graph (see Chapter 30).

Brief guide to curve sketching
The following steps will give information from which
the graphs of many types of functions y =f (x) can be
sketched.
(i)
Use calculus to determine the location and
nature of maximum and minimum points (see
Chapter 30).
(ii)
Determine where the curve cuts thex-andy-axes.
(iii)
Inspect the equation for symmetry.
(a)
If the equation is unchanged when −x is sub-
stituted for x, the graph will be symmetrical
about the y-axis (i.e. it is an even function).
(b)
If the equation is unchanged when −y is sub-
stituted for y, the graph will be symmetrical
about the x-axis.
(c)
If f (−x)=−f (x), the graph is symmetrical
about the origin (i.e. it is an odd function).
(iv)
Check for any asymptotes.

sketching
Problem 13.
Sketch the graphs of
(a) y =2x2 +12x +20
(b) y =−3x2+12x −15
(a)
y =2x2 +12x +20 is a parabola since the equa-
tion is a quadratic. To determine the turning
point:
Gradient= dy
dx =4x +12=0 for a turning point.
Hence 4x =−12 and x =−3
When x =−3, y =2(−3)2 +12(−3)+20=2
Hence (−3, 2) are the co-ordinates of the turning
point
d2y
dx2 =4, which is positive, hence (−3, 2) is a
minimum point.
When x =0, y =20, hence the curve cuts the
y-axis at y =20
Thus knowing the curve passes through (−3, 2)
and (0, 20) and appreciating the general shape
of a parabola results in the sketch given in
Fig. 20.36.
(b)
y =−3x2+12x −15 is also a parabola (but
‘upside down’ due to the minus sign in front of
the x2 term).
Gradient= dy
dx =−6x +12=0 for a turning point.
Hence 6x =12 and x =2
When x =2, y =−3(2)2+12(2)−15=−3
Hence (2, −3) are the co-ordinates of the turning
point
d2y
dx2 =−6, which is negative, hence (2, −3) is a
maximum point.
When x =0, y =−15, hence the curve cuts the axis
at y =−15
The curve is shown sketched in Fig. 20.36.

Sketch the curves depicting the
following equations:
(a) x =

9 −y2
(b) y2 =16x
(c) xy=5
(a)
Squaring both sides of the equation and trans-
posing gives x2+y2 =9. Comparing this with
the standard equation of a circle, centre ori-
gin and radius a, i.e. x2+y2 =a2, shows that
x2 +y2 =9 represents a circle, centre origin and
radius 3. A sketch of this circle is shown in
Fig. 20.37(a).
(b)
The equation y 2 =16x is symmetrical about the
x-axis and having its vertex at the origin (0, 0).
Also, when x =1, y =±4. A sketch of this
parabola is shown in Fig. 20.37(b).

The equation y = a

represents a rectangular
hyperbola lying entirely within the ﬁrst and third

system, the major axis being 2(3), i.e. 6 units long

Chapter 21
Irregular areas, volumes and
mean values of waveforms
Why it is important to understand: Irregular areas, volumes and mean values of waveforms
Surveyors,farmersandlandscapersoftenneedtodeterminetheareaofirregularlyshapedpiecesoflandto
work with the land properly. There are many applications in business, economics and the sciences, includ-
ing all aspects of engineering, where ﬁnding the areas of irregular shapes, the volumes of solids, and the
lengths of irregular shaped curves are important applications. Typical earthworks include roads, railway
beds, causeways, dams and canals. Other common earthworks are land grading to reconﬁgure the topog-
raphy of a site, or to stabilise slopes. Engineers need to concern themselves with issues of geotechnical engi-
neering (such as soil density and strength) and with quantity estimation to ensure that soil volumes in the
cuts match those of the ﬁlls, while minimizing the distance of movement. Simpson’s rule is a staple of scien-
tiﬁc data analysis and engineering; it is widely used, for example, by naval architects to numerically deter-
mine hull offsets and cross-sectional areas to determine volumes and centroids of ships or lifeboats. There
are therefore plenty of examples where irregular areas and volumes need to be determined by engineers.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
use the trapezoidal rule to determine irregular areas
•
use the mid-ordinate rule to determine irregular areas
•
use Simpson’s rule to determine irregular areas
•
estimate the volume of irregular solids
•
determine the mean values of waveforms
21.1
Areas of irregular ﬁgures
Areas of irregular plane surfaces may be approximately
determined by using (a) a planimeter,(b) the trapezoidal
rule, (c) the mid-ordinate rule, and (d) Simpson’s rule.
Such methods may be used, for example, by engineers
estimating areas of indicatordiagrams of steam engines,
surveyors estimating areas of plots of land or naval
architects estimating areas of water planes or transverse
sections of ships.
(a)
A planimeter is an instrument for directly mea-
suring small areas bounded by an irregular curve.
(b)
Trapezoidal rule
To determine the areas PQRS in Fig. 21.1:
(i)
Divide base PS into any number of equal
intervals, each of width d (the greater the
number of intervals, the greater the accu-
racy).
(ii) Accurately measure ordinates y1, y2, y3, etc.

Complex numbers


Chapter 22
Complex numbers
Why it is important to understand: Complex numbers
Complex numbers are used in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds, including engineering, electromagnetism, quantum
physics, and applied mathematics, such as chaos theory. Any physical motion which is periodic, such as an
oscillating beam, string, wire, pendulum, electronic signal, or electromagnetic wave can be represented
by a complex number function. This can make calculations with the various components simpler than
with real numbers and sines and cosines. In control theory, systems are often transformed from the time
domain to the frequency domain using the Laplace transform. In ﬂuid dynamics, complex functions are
used to describe potential ﬂow in two dimensions. In electrical engineering, the Fourier transform is
used to analyse varying voltages and currents. Complex numbers are used in signal analysis and other
ﬁelds for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. This use is also extended into digital
signal processing and digital image processing, which utilise digital versions of Fourier analysis (and
wavelet analysis) to transmit, compress, restore, and otherwise process digital audio signals, still images,
and video signals. Knowledge of complex numbers is clearly absolutely essential for further studies in so
many engineering disciplines.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a complex number
•
solve quadratic equations with imaginary roots
•
use an Argand diagram to represent a complex number pictorially
•
add, subtract, multiply and divide Cartesian complex numbers
•
solve complex equations
•
convert a Cartesian complex number into polar form, and vice-versa
•
multiply and divide polar form complex numbers
•
apply complex numbers to practical applications

Cartesian complex numbers
There are several applications of complex numbers
in science and engineering, in particular in electrical
alternating current theory and in mechanical vector
analysis.
There are two main forms of complex number –
Cartesian form (named after Descartes∗) and polar
form – and both are explained in this chapter.
If we can add, subtract, multiply and divide complex
numbers in both forms and represent the numbers on
an Argand diagram then a.c. theory and vector analysis
become considerably easier.

It is not possible to evaluate √−1 in real
terms. However, if an operator j is deﬁned as
j =√−1 then the solution may be expressed as
x =−1± j2.
(ii)
−1+ j2 and −1−j2 are known as com-
plex numbers. Both solutions are of the form
a + jb, ‘a’ being termed the real part and jb
the imaginary part. A complex number of
the form a + jb is called Cartesian complex
number.
(iii)
In pure mathematics the symbol i is used to
indicate √−1 (i being the ﬁrst letter of the word
imaginary). However i is the symbol of electric
current in engineering, and to avoid possible con-
fusion the next letter in the alphabet, j, is used to
represent √−1

axis is used to represent the imaginary axis. Such a dia-
gram is called an Argand diagram∗.
In Fig. 22.1,
the point A represents the complex number (3+ j2)
and is obtained by plotting the co-ordinates (3, j2) as
in graphical work. Fig. 22.1 also shows the Argand
points B,C and D representing the complex numbers
(−2+ j4), (−3−j5) and (1−j3) respectively.
22.3 Addition and subtraction of
complex numbers
Two complex numbers are added/subtracted by adding/
subtracting separately the two real parts and the two
imaginary parts.
For example, if Z1 =a + jb and Z2 =c+ jd,
then
Z1+Z2 =(a + jb)+(c+ jd)
=(a +c)+ j(b+d)
and
Z1 −Z2=(a + jb) −(c+ jd)
=(a −c)+ j(b−d)
Thus, for example,
(2+ j3)+(3−j4)=2+ j3+3−j4
=5−j1
∗Who was Argand? Jean-Robert Argand (18 July 1768–
13 August 1822) was a highly inﬂuential mathematician. He
privately published a landmark essay on the representation
of imaginary quantities which became known as the Argand
diagram. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

22.4 Multiplication and division of
complex numbers
(i)
Multiplication of complex numbers is achieved
by assuming all quantities involved are real and
then using j 2 =−1 to simplify.

Section D
Complex numbers
257
Hence (a + jb)(c+ jd)
=ac+a(jd)+(jb)c+(jb)(jd)
=ac+ jad + jbc+ j2bd
=(ac−bd)+ j(ad +bc),
since j 2 =−1
Thus (3+ j2)(4−j5)
=12−j15+ j8−j 210
=(12−(−10))+ j(−15+8)
=22−j7
(ii)
The complex conjugate of a complex num-
ber is obtained by changing the sign of the
imaginary part. Hence the complex conjugate
of a + jb is a −jb. The product of a complex
number and its complex conjugate is always a
real number.
For example,
(3 + j4)(3 −j4)=9 −j12+ j12−j 216
=9 + 16 = 25
[(a + jb)(a −jb) may be evaluated ‘on sight’ as
a2 +b2]
(iii)
Division of complex numbers is achieved by
multiplying both numerator and denominator by
the complex conjugate of the denominator.
For example,
2 −j5
3 + j4
=
2 −j5
3 + j4 × (3 −j4)
(3 −j4)
=

If two complex numbers are equal, then their real parts
are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. Hence if
a + jb=c+ jd, then a =c and b=d
Problem 7.
Solve the complex equations:
(a)
2(x + jy)=6 −j3
(b)
(1+ j2)(−2−j3)=a + jb
(a)
2(x + jy)=6−j3 hence 2x + j2y =6−j3
Equating the real parts gives:
2x = 6, i.e. x = 3
Equating the imaginary parts gives:
2y = −3, i.e. y = −3
2
(b)
(1+ j2)(−2−j3)=a + jb
−2−j3−j4−j 26=a + jb
Hence 4−j7=a + jb
Equating real and imaginary terms gives:
a = 4 and b = −7
Problem 8.
Solve the equations:
(a)
(2−j3)=√(a + jb)
(b)
(x −j2y)+(y −j3x)=2+ j3
(a)
(2−j3)=√(a +jb)
Hence
(2 −j3)2 =a + jb,
i.e.
(2 −j3)(2−j3)=a + jb
Hence 4 −j6 −j6 + j 29=a + jb
and
−5 −j12=a + jb
Thus a= −5 and b= −12
(b)
(x −j2y)+(y −j3x)=2+ j3
Hence (x +y)+ j(−2y −3x)=2+ j3
Equating real and imaginary parts gives:

22.6 The polar form of a complex
number
(i)
Let a complex number z be x + jy as shown in
the Argand diagram of Fig. 22.4. Let distance
OZ be r and the angle OZ makes with the positive
real axis be θ
From trigonometry, x = r cosθ and
y = r sinθ
Hence Z = x + jy
= r cosθ + jr sinθ
= r(cosθ + j sinθ)
Z =r(cos θ + j sinθ) is usually abbreviated to
Z =r∠θ which is known as the polar form of
a complex number.
(ii)
r is called the modulus (or magnitude) of Z and
is written as mod Z or |Z|

Modulus, r =5 and angle α =53.13◦, from

Hence −3 + j4 = 5∠126.87◦

Modulus, r =5 and α =53.13◦, as above.
Hencetheargument=180◦+53.13◦=233.13◦,
which is the same as −126.87◦
Hence (−3 −j4)=5∠233.13◦or 5∠−126.87◦

22.8 Applications of complex
numbers
There are several applications of complex numbers
in science and engineering, in particular in electrical
alternating current theory and in mechanical vector
analysis.
The effect of multiplying a phasor by j is to rotate
it in a positive direction (i.e. anticlockwise) on an
Argand diagram through 90◦without altering its length.
Similarly, multiplying a phasor by −j rotates the pha-
sor through −90◦. These facts are used in a.c. the-
ory since certain quantities in the phasor diagrams
lie at 90◦to each other. For example, in the R−L
series circuit shown in Fig. 22.8(a), VL leads I by
90◦(i.e. I lags VL by 90◦) and may be written as
jVL, the vertical axis being regarded as the imagi-
nary axis of an Argand diagram. Thus VR + jVL =V
and since VR =IR, V =IXL (where XL is the induc-
tive reactance, 2πfLohms) and V =IZ (where Z is
the impedance) then R + jXL =Z

(c) 15∠−60◦
(a)
Impedance, Z =(4.0+ j7.0)  hence,
resistance=4.0  and reactance=7.00 .
Since the imaginary part is positive, the reactance
is inductive,
i.e. XL =7.0 

De Moivre’s theorem
Why it is important to understand: De Moivre’s theorem
There are many, many examples of the use of complex numbers in engineering and science. De Moivre’s
theorem has several uses, including ﬁnding powers and roots of complex numbers, solving polynomial
equations, calculating trigonometric identities, and for evaluating the sums of trigonometric series. The
theorem is also used to calculate exponential and logarithmic functions of complex numbers. De Moivre’s
theorem has applications in electrical engineering and physics.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

23.1
Introduction
From multiplication of complex numbers in polar form,
(r∠θ) × (r∠θ) = r2∠2θ
Similarly, (r∠θ)×(r∠θ)×(r∠θ)=r3∠3θ, and so on.
In general, de Moivre’s theorem∗
[r∠θ]n =rn∠nθ
The theorem is true for all positive, negative and
fractional values of n. The theorem is used to determine
powers and roots of complex numbers.

∗Who was de Moivre? Abraham de Moivre (26 May
1667–27 November 1754) was a French mathematician famous
for de Moivre’s formula, which links complex numbers
and trigonometry, and for his work on the normal dis-
tribution and probability theory. To ﬁnd out more go to

74∠144.46◦

(−7 + j5)4 = [

Since r∠θ = r cosθ +jr sinθ,
5476∠217.84◦= 5476cos217.84◦

In general, when ﬁnding the nth root of a complex

three solutions to a cube root, ﬁve solutions to a ﬁfth

arguments, θ, are different. It is shown in Problem 3

23.4 The exponential form of a
complex number
Certain mathematical functions may be expressed as
power series (for example, by Maclaurin’s series – see
Chapter 8), three examples being:
(i) ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + x4
4! + x5
5! + ···
(1)
(ii)
sinx = x −x3
3! + x5
5! −x7
7! + ···
(2)
(iii)
cosx = 1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −x6
6! + ···
(3)
Replacing x in equation (1) by the imaginary number
jθ gives:
e jθ = 1+jθ + (jθ)2
2!
+ (jθ)3
3!
+ (jθ)4
4!
+ (jθ)5
5!
+···
= 1 + jθ + j2θ2
2!
+ j3θ3
3!
+ j4θ4
4!
+ j5θ5
5!
+ ···
By deﬁnition, j =√(−1), hence j 2 =−1, j 3=−j,
j4 =1, j 5 =j, and so on.
Thus e jθ =1+jθ −θ2
2! −j θ3
3! + θ4
4! +j θ5
5! −···
Grouping real and imaginary terms gives:
e jθ =

1 −θ2
2! + θ4
4! −···

+ j

θ −θ3
3! + θ5
5! −···
	
However, from equations (2) and (3):

1 −θ2
2! + θ4
4! −···

= cosθ
and

θ −θ3
3! + θ5
5! −···
	
= sinθ
Thus
e jθ =cosθ +jsinθ
(4)
Writing −θ for θ in equation (4), gives:
e j(−θ) = cos(−θ) + j sin(−θ)
However, cos(−θ)= cosθ and sin(−θ)=−sinθ
Thus
e −jθ =cosθ −jsinθ
(5)
The
polar
form
of
a
complex
number
z
is:
z=r(cosθ +j sinθ). But, from equation (4),
cosθ +j sinθ =e jθ
Therefore
z=re jθ
When a complex number is written in this way, it is said
to be expressed in exponential form.
There are therefore three ways of expressing a complex
number:
(i)
z=(a +jb), called Cartesian or rectangu-
lar form,
(ii)
z=r(cosθ +j sinθ) or r∠θ, called polar form,
and
(iii)
z=re jθ called exponential form.
The exponential form is obtained from the polar form.
For example, 4∠30◦becomes 4e j π
6 in exponential
form. (Note that in re jθ,θ must be in radians.)
Problem 6.

Problem 10.
If z=4e j1.3, determine lnz (a) in

If
z = re jθthen lnz = ln(re jθ)

lnz = lnr + jθ,
by the laws of logarithms
(a)
Thus if z=4e j1.3 then lnz= ln(4e j1.3)

(or 1.386+ j1.300) in Cartesian form.

Determine the locus deﬁned by
|z −2| = 3, given that z = x + jy
If

(x −2)2 + y2 = 3 from
which, (x −2)2 + y2 = 32
From Chapter 14, (x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r2 is a circle,
with centre (a,b) and radius r.
Hence, (x −2)2 + y2 = 32 is a circle, with centre (2, 0)
and radius 3

and squaring both sides gives:

(x + 1)2 + y2 = 9
from which,
(x −1)2 + y2 = 9[(x + 1)2 + y2]
x2 −2x + 1 + y2 = 9[x2 + 2x + 1 + y2]
x2 −2x + 1 + y2 = 9x2 + 18x + 9 + 9y2

i.e.
8x2 + 20x + 8 + 8y2 = 0

Matrices and determinants


Chapter 24
The theory of matrices and
determinants
Why it is important to understand: The theory of matrices and determinants
Matrices are used to solve problems in electronics, optics, quantum mechanics, statics, robotics, linear
programming, optimisation, genetics, and much more. Matrix calculus is a mathematical tool used in
connection with linear equations, linear transformations, systems of differential equations, and so on,
and is vital for calculating forces, vectors, tensions, masses, loads and a lot of other factors that must be
accounted for in engineering to ensure safe and resource-efﬁcient structure. Electrical and mechanical
engineers,chemists,biologistsandscientistsallneedknowledgeofmatricestosolveproblems.Incomputer
graphics, matrices are used to project a three-dimensional image on to a two-dimensional screen, and to
create realistic motion. Matrices are therefore very important in solving engineering problems.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand matrix notation
•
add, subtract and multiply 2 by 2 and 3 by 3 matrices
•
recognise the unit matrix
•
calculate the determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix
•
determine the inverse (or reciprocal) of a 2 by 2 matrix
•
calculate the determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix
•
determine the inverse (or reciprocal) of a 3 by 3 matrix
24.1
Matrix notation
Matrices and determinants are mainly used for the solu-
tion of linear simultaneous equations. The theory of
matrices and determinants is dealt with in this chap-
ter and this theory is then used in Chapter 25 to solve
simultaneous equations.
The coefﬁcients of the variables for linear simul-
taneous equations may be shown in matrix form.
The coefﬁcients of x and y in the simultaneous
equations
x + 2y = 3
4x −5y = 6
become

in matrix notation.

The numbers within a matrix are called an array and
the coefﬁcients forming the array are called the ele-
ments of the matrix. The number of rows in a matrix
is usually speciﬁed by m and the number of columns
by n and a matrix referred to as an ‘m by n’ matrix.
Thus,
2 3 6
4 5 7

is a ‘2 by 3’ matrix. Matrices cannotbe
expressed as a single numerical value,but they can often
be simpliﬁed or combined, and unknown element val-
ues can be determined by comparison methods. Just as
there are rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division of numbers in arithmetic, rules for these
operations can be applied to matrices and the rules of
matrices are such that they obey most of those governing
the algebra of numbers.

When a matrix A is multiplied by another matrix B,
a single matrix results in which elements are obtained
from the sum of the products of the corresponding rows
of A and the corresponding columns of B.
Two matrices A and B may be multiplied together,
provided the number of elements in the rows of matrix
A are equal to the number of elements in the columns of
matrix B. In general terms, when multiplying a matrix
of dimensions (m by n) by a matrix of dimensions (n by
r), the resulting matrix has dimensions (m by r). Thus
a 2 by 3 matrix multiplied by a 3 by 1 matrix gives a
matrix of dimensions 2 by 1.

C12 is the sum of the products of the ﬁrst row elements
of A and the second column elements of B, taken one
at a time,
i.e. C12 =(2 × 7) + (3 × 4) = 26
C21 is the sum of the products of the second row
elements of A and the ﬁrst column elements of B, taken
one at a time,
i.e. C21 =(1 × (−5)) + (−4 × (−3)) = 7
Finally, C22 is the sum of the products of the second
row elements of A and the second column elements of
B, taken one at a time,

The unit matrix
A unit matrix, I, is one in which all elements of the
leading diagonal (\) have a value of 1 and all other ele-
ments have a value of 0. Multiplication of a matrix by
I is the equivalent of multiplying by 1 in arithmetic.

Equating corresponding elements gives:
b + 2d = 0,i.e. b = −2d
and 3a + 4c = 0,i.e. a = −4

Substituting for a and b gives:

24.6 The determinant of a 3 by 3
matrix
(i)
The minor of an element of a 3 by 3 matrix is
the value of the 2 by 2 determinant obtained by
covering up the row and column containing that
element.
Thus for the matrix
⎛
⎝
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
⎞
⎠the minor of
element 4 is obtained by covering the row
(4 5 6) and the column
⎛
⎝
1
4
7
⎞
⎠, leaving the 2 by
2 determinant




2 3
8 9




, i.e. the minor of element 4
is (2 × 9)−(3 × 8)=−6
(ii)
The sign of a minor depends on its position within
the matrix, the sign pattern being
⎛
⎝
+ −+
−+ −
+ −+
⎞
⎠.
Thus the signed-minor of element 4 in the matrix
⎛
⎝
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
⎞
⎠is −




2 3
8 9




 =−(−6)=6
The signed-minor of an element is called the
cofactor of the element.
(iii)
The value of a 3 by 3 determinant is the
sum of the products of the elements and their
cofactors of any row or any column of the
corresponding 3 by 3 matrix.
There are thus six different ways of evaluating a 3 × 3
determinant – and all should give the same value.
Problem 14.
Find the value of






3
4 −1
2
0
7
1 −3 −2






The value of this determinant is the sum of the products
of the elements and their cofactors, of any row or of any
column. If the second row or second column is selected,
the element 0 will make the product of the element and
its cofactor zero and reduce the amount of arithmetic to
be done to a minimum.
Supposing a second row expansion is selected. The
minor of 2 is the value of the determinant remain-
ing when the row and column containing the 2 (i.e.
the second row and the ﬁrst column), is covered up.
Thus the cofactor of element 2 is




4 −1
−3 −2




 i.e. −11
The sign of element 2 is minus (see (ii) above), hence
the cofactor of element 2, (the signed-minor) is +11
Similarly the minor of element 7 is




3
4
1 −3




 i.e. −13,
and its cofactor is +13. Hence the value of the sum
of the products of the elements and their cofactors is
2 × 11+7 × 13, i.e.,






3
4 −1
2
0
7
1 −3 −2






= 2(11)+0+7(13)=113
The same result will be obtained whichever row or
column is selected. For example, the third column
expansion is

Chapter 25
Applications of matrices
and determinants
Why it is important to understand: Applications of matrices and determinants
As mentioned previously, matrices are used to solve problems, for example, in electrical circuits, optics,
quantum mechanics, statics, robotics, genetics, and much more, and for calculating forces, vectors,
tensions, masses, loads and a lot of other factors that must be accounted for in engineering. In the
main, matrices and determinants are used to solve a system of simultaneous linear equations. The
simultaneous solution of multiple equations ﬁnds its way into many common engineering problems.
In fact, modern structural engineering analysis techniques are all about solving systems of equations
simultaneously. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which are based on matrix theory, are very important
in engineering and science. For example, car designers analyse eigenvalues in order to damp out the
noise in a car, eigenvalue analysis is used in the design of car stereo systems, eigenvalues can be used
to test for cracks and deformities in a solid, and oil companies use eigenvalues analysis to explore land
for oil.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
solve simultaneous equations in two and three unknowns using matrices
•
solve simultaneous equations in two and three unknowns using determinants
•
solve simultaneous equations using Cramer’s rule
•
solve simultaneous equations using Gaussian elimination
•
determine the eigenvalues of a 2 by 2 and 3 by 3 matrix
•
determine the eigenvectors of a 2 by 2 and 3 by 3 matrix

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
In practical applications, such as coupled oscillations
and vibrations, equations of the form:
Ax = λ x
occur, where A is a square matrix and λ (Greek lambda)
is a number. Whenever x ̸= 0, the values of λ are
called the eigenvalues of the matrix A; the correspond-
ing solutions of the equation Ax = λx are called the
eigenvectors of A.
Sometimes, instead of the term eigenvalues, character-
istic values or latent roots are used. Also, instead of
the term eigenvectors, characteristic vectors is used.
From above, if Ax = λx then Ax −λx = 0 i.e.
(A −λI) = 0 where I is the unit matrix.
If x ̸= 0 then |A −λI| = 0

Section E
Applications of matrices and determinants
297
|A −λI| is called the characteristic determinant of A
and |A −λI| = 0 is called the characteristic equation.
Solving the characteristic equationwill give the value(s)
of the eigenvalues, as demonstrated in the following
worked problems.
Problem 9.
Determine the eigenvalues of the

(Given a square matrix, we can get used to going straight
to this characteristic equation)
Hence,
(3 −λ)(1 −λ) −(2)(4) = 0
i.e.
3 −3λ −λ + λ2 −8 = 0
and
λ2 −4λ −5 = 0
i.e.
(λ −5)(λ + 1) = 0
from which, λ −5 = 0 i.e. λ = 5 or λ + 1 = 0 i.e.
λ = −1
(Instead of factorising, the quadratic formula could be
used; even electronic calculators can solve quadratic
equations.)

i.e.

or

To solve a cubic equation, the factor theorem (see
Chapter 1) may be used. (Alternatively, electronic
calculators can solve such cubic equations.)
Let f (λ) = λ3 −8λ2 + 19λ −12
If λ = 1, then f (1) = 13 −8(1)2 + 19(1) −12 = 0
Since f (1) = 0 then (λ −1) is a factor.
If λ = 2, then f (2) = 23 −8(2)2 + 19(2) −12 ̸= 0
If λ = 3, then f (3) = 33 −8(3)2 + 19(3) −12 = 0
Since f (3) = 0 then (λ −3) is a factor.
If λ = 4, then f (4) = 43 −8(4)2 + 19(4) −12 = 0
Since f (4) = 0 then (λ −4) is a factor.
Thus, since λ3 −8λ2 + 19λ −12 = 0

Chapter 26
Vectors
Why it is important to understand: Vectors
Vectors are an important part of the language of science, mathematics, and engineering. They are used to
discuss multivariable calculus, electrical circuits with oscillating currents, stress and strain in structures
and materials, and ﬂows of atmospheres and ﬂuids, and they have many other applications. Resolving a
vector into components is a precursor to computing things with or about a vector quantity. Because posi-
tion, velocity, acceleration, force, momentum, and angular momentum are all vector quantities, resolving
vectors into components is a most important skill required in any engineering studies.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
distinguish between scalars and vectors
•
recognise how vectors are represented
•
add vectors using the nose-to-tail method
•
add vectors using the parallelogram method
•
resolve vectors into their horizontal and vertical components
•
add vectors by calculation – horizontal and vertical components, complex numbers
•
perform vector subtraction
•
understand relative velocity
•
understand i, j, k notation

scalar and vector quantities and shows how a vector is
drawn and represented.
Any object that is acted upon by an externalforce will
respond to that force by moving in the line of the force.
However, if two or more forces act simultaneously, the
result is more difﬁcult to predict; the ability to add two
or more vectors then becomes important.
This chapter thus shows how vectors are added and
subtracted,bothbydrawingandbycalculation,andﬁnd-
ing the resultant of two or more vectors has many uses in
engineering. (Resultant means the single vector which
would have the same effect as the individual vectors.)
Relative velocities and vector i,j,k notation are also
brieﬂy explained.

Scalars and vectors
The time taken to ﬁll a water tank may be measured as,
say, 50s. Similarly, the temperature in a room may be
measured as, say, 16◦C, or the mass of a bearing may
be measured as, say, 3kg.
Quantities such as time, temperature and mass are
entirely deﬁned by a numerical value and are called
scalars or scalar quantities.

Not all quantities are like this. Some are deﬁned by
more than just size; some also have direction. For exam-
ple, the velocity of a car is 90 km/h due west, or a force
of 20N acts vertically downwards, or an acceleration of
10m/s2 acts at 50◦to the horizontal.
Quantities such as velocity, force and acceleration,
which have both a magnitude and a direction, are
called vectors.

Drawing a vector
A vector quantity can be represented graphically by a
line, drawn so that:
(a)
the length of the line denotes the magnitude of the
quantity, and
(b)
the direction of the line denotes the direction in
which the vector quantity acts.
An arrow is used to denote the sense, or direction, of
the vector. The arrow end of a vector is called the
‘nose’ and the other end the ‘tail’. For example, a
force of 9N acting at 45◦to the horizontal is shown
in Fig. 26.1.
Note that an angle of +45◦is drawn from the horizontal
and moves anticlockwise.

strate how to determine resultant vectors by calculation
using horizontal and vertical components and, where
possible, by Pythagoras’ theorem.

Relative velocity
For relative velocity problems, some ﬁxed datum point
needs to be selected. This is often a ﬁxed point on the
Earth’s surface. In any vector equation, only the start
and ﬁnish points affect the resultant vector of a system.

each of the systems, the resultant vector is ad.

Chapter 27
Methods of adding
alternating waveforms
Why it is important to understand: Methods of adding alternating waveforms
In electrical engineering, a phasor is a rotating vector representing a quantity such as an alternating
current or voltage that varies sinusoidally. Sometimes it is necessary when studying sinusoidal quantities
to add together two alternating waveforms, for example in an a.c. series circuit, where they are not
in-phase with each other. Electrical engineers, electronics engineers, electronic engineering technicians
and aircraft engineers all use phasor diagrams to visualise complex constants and variables. So, given
oscillations to add and subtract, the required rotating vectors are constructed, called a phasor diagram,
and graphically the resulting sum and/or difference oscillation are added or calculated. Phasors may be
used to analyse the behaviour of electrical and mechanical systems that have reached a kind of equilibrium
called sinusoidal steady state. Hence, discovering different methods of combining sinusoidal waveforms
is of some importance in certain areas of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine the resultant of two phasors by graph plotting
•
determine the resultant of two or more phasors by drawing
•
determine the resultant of two phasors by the sine and cosine rules
•
determine the resultant of two or more phasors by horizontal and vertical components
•
determine the resultant of two or more phasors by complex numbers
27.1 Combination of two periodic
functions
There are a number of instances in engineering and sci-
ence where waveforms have to be combined and where
it is required to determine the single phasor (called
the resultant) that could replace two or more separate
phasors. Uses are found in electrical alternating cur-
rent theory, in mechanical vibrations, in the addition of
forces and with sound waves.
There are a number of methods of determining the
resultant waveform. These include:
(a)
by drawing the waveforms and adding graphically
(b)
by drawing the phasors and measuring the
resultant
(c)
by using the cosine and sine rules
(d)
by using horizontal and vertical components
(e)
by using complex numbers

Plotting periodic functions
This may be achieved by sketching the separate func-
tions on the same axes and then adding (or subtracting)
ordinates at regular intervals. This is demonstrated in
the following worked Problems.
Problem 1.
Plot the graph of y1 = 3sinA from
A = 0◦to A = 360◦. On the same axes plot
y2 = 2cosA. By adding ordinates, plot
yR = 3sinA + 2cosA and obtain a sinusoidal
expression for this resultant waveform.
y1 = 3sinA
and
y2 = 2cosA
are
shown
plotted
in Fig. 27.1. Ordinates may be added at, say, 15◦
intervals. For example,
at 0◦, y1+ y2 = 0 + 2 = 2
at 15◦, y1+ y2 = 0.78 + 1.93 = 2.71
at 120◦, y1+ y2 = 2.60 + −1 = 1.6
at
210◦,
y1+ y2 = −1.50 −1.73 = −3.23,
and
so on.
The resultant waveform, shown by the broken line,
has the same period, i.e. 360◦, and thus the same fre-
quency as the single phasors. The maximum value, or
amplitude, of the resultant is 3.6. The resultant wave-
form leads y1 = 3sinA by 34◦or 34 × π
180 rad =
0.593 rad.
The sinusoidal expression for the resultant wave-
form is:

Ordinates are added at 15◦intervals and the resul-
tant is shown by the broken line. The amplitude
of the resultant is 6.1 and it lags y1 by 25◦
or 0.436 rad.
Hence, the sinusoidal expression for the resultant wave-
form is:
yR = 6.1 sin(ωt −0.436)
Problem 3.
Determine a sinusoidal expression
for y1 −y2 when y1 = 4sinωt and
y2 = 3sin(ωt −π/3)
y1 and y2 are shown plottedin Fig. 27.3.At 15◦intervals
y2 is subtracted from y1. For example:
at
0◦, y1 −y2 = 0 −(−2.6) = +2.6
at
30◦, y1 −y2 = 2 −(−1.5) = +3.5
at
150◦, y1 −y2 = 2 −3 = −1,and so on.
The amplitude, or peak value of the resultant (shown by
the broken line), is 3.6 and it leads y1 by 45◦or 0.79
rad. Hence,
y1 −y2 = 3.6 sin(ωt + 0.79)

then each may be represented as phasors as shown in
Fig. 27.5, y1 being 4 units long and drawn horizontally
and y2 being 3 units long, lagging y1 by π/3 radians or
60◦. To determine the resultant of y1 + y2, y1 is drawn
horizontally as shown in Fig. 27.6 and y2 is joined to the

Resultant yR, in Figs. 27.6 and 27.7, may be determined

Hence, summarising, by drawing:

If the resultant phasor yR = y1 −y2 is required, then y2

phasors as shown in Fig. 27.12, y1being 5 units long and
drawn horizontally and y2 being 4 units long, lagging
y1 by π/6 radians or 30◦. To determine the resultant of
y1 + y2, y1 is drawn horizontally as shown in Fig. 27.13
and y2 is joined to the end of y1 at π/6 radians, i.e. 30◦
to the horizontal. The resultant is given by yR
Usingthecosineruleontriangle0ab ofFig.27.13gives:

Problem 7.
Given y1 =2sinωt and
y2 =3sin(ωt + π/4), obtain an expression, by
calculation, for the resultant, yR = y1 + y2
When time t = 0, the position of phasors y1 and y2
are as shown in Fig. 27.14(a). To obtain the resul-
tant, y1 is drawn horizontally, 2 units long, y2 is drawn
3 units long at an angle of π/4 rads or 45◦and joined to
the end of y1 as shown in Fig. 27.14(b).

In polar form, yR = 5∠0 + 4∠−π

= 5∠0◦+ 4∠−30◦
= (5 + j0) + (4.33 −j2.0)
= 9.33 −j2.0 = 9.54∠−12.10◦
= 9.54∠−0.21rad
Hence, by using complex numbers, the resultant in
sinusoidal form is:
y1 + y2 = 5sinωt + 4sin(ωt −π/6)
= 9.54sin(ωt−0.21)

shown in Fig. 27.22(a) and the phasor diagram is shown
in Fig. 27.22(b).
In polar form, vR = v1 + v2 = 15∠0 + 25∠−π
6
= 15∠0◦+ 25∠−30◦
= (15 + j0) + (21.65 −j12.5)
= 36.65 −j12.5 = 38.72∠−18.83◦
= 38.72∠−0.329 rad
Hence, by using complex numbers, the resultant in
sinusoidal form is:
vR = v1 + v2 = 15sinωt + 25sin(ωt −π/6)
= 38.72sin(ωt −0.329)

Chapter 28
Scalar and vector products
Why it is important to understand: Scalar and vector products
Common applications of the scalar product in engineering and physics is to test whether two vectors
are perpendicular or to ﬁnd the angle between two vectors when they are expressed in Cartesian form
or to ﬁnd the component of one vector in the direction of another. In mechanical engineering the scalar
and vector product is used with forces, displacement, moments, velocities and the determination of work
done. In electrical engineering, scalar and vector product calculations are important in electromagnetic
calculations; most electromagnetic equations use vector calculus which is based on the scalar and vector
product. Such applications include electric motors and generators and power transformers, and so on.
Knowledge of scalar and vector products thus have important engineering applications.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a unit triad
•
determine the scalar (or dot) product of two vectors
•
calculate the angle between two vectors
•
determine the direction cosines of a vector
•
apply scalar products to practical situations
•
determine the vector (or cross) product of two vectors
•
apply vector products to practical situations
•
determine the vector equation of a line
28.1
The unit triad
When a vector x of magnitude x units and direction θ ◦
is divided by the magnitude of the vector, the result is a
vector of unit length at angle θ ◦. The unit vector for a
velocity of 10m/s at 50◦is 10m/sat50◦
10m/s
, i.e. 1 at 50◦.
In general, the unit vector for oa is oa
|oa|, the oa being
a vector and having both magnitude and direction and
|oa| being the magnitude of the vector only.
One method of completelyspecifying the directionof
a vector in space relative to some reference point is to
use three unit vectors, mutually at right angles to each
other, as shown in Fig. 28.1. Such a system is called a
unit triad.

28.2 The scalar product of two
vectors
When vector oa is multiplied by a scalar quantity, say k,
the magnitude of the resultant vector will be k times the
magnitude of oa and its direction will remain the same.
Thus 2×(5N at 20◦) results in a vector of magnitude
10N at 20◦.
One of the products of two vector quantities is called the
scalar or dot product of two vectors and is deﬁned as
the product of their magnitudes multiplied by the cosine
of the angle between them. The scalar product of oa and
ob is shown as oa • ob. For vectors oa=oa at θ1, and
ob=ob at θ2 where θ2 >θ1, the scalar product is:
oa •ob = oa ob cos(θ 2 −θ1)
For vectors v1 and v2 shown in Fig. 28.4, the scalar
product is:
v1 •v2 = v1v2 cosθ

v2
v1
Figure 28.4
The commutative law of algebra, a ×b=b×a applies
to scalar products. This is demonstratedin Fig. 28.5. Let
oa represent vector v1 and ob represent vector v2. Then:
oa •ob = v1v2 cos θ (by deﬁnition of
a scalar product)

The projection of ob on oa is shown in Fig. 28.6(a) and
by the geometry of triangle obc, it can be seen that the
projection is v2 cosθ. Since, by deﬁnition
oa •ob = v1(v2 cosθ),
it follows that
oa •ob = v1 (the projection of v2 on v1)
Similarly the projection of oa on ob is shown in
Fig. 28.6(b) and is v1 cosθ. Since by deﬁnition
ob •oa = v2(v1 cosθ),
it follows that
ob •oa = v2(the projection of v1 on v2)
This shows that the scalar product of two vectors
is the product of the magnitude of one vector and
the magnitude of the projection of the other vector on it.
The angle between two vectors can be expressed in
terms of the vector constants as follows:
Because a •b=a bcosθ,
then
cosθ = a •b

a = a1i + a2 j + a3k
and
b = b1i + b2 j + b3k
a •b = (a1i + a2 j + a3k) • (b1i + b2j + b3k)
Multiplying out the brackets gives:
a •b = a1b1i •i + a1b2i •j + a1b3i •k
+ a2b1 j •i + a2b2 j •j + a2b3 j •k
+ a3b1k •i + a3b2k •j + a3b3k •k
However, the unit vectors i, j and k all have a magnitude
of 1 and i •i=(1)(1) cos 0◦=1, i •j= (1)(1) cos 90◦=0,
i •k= (1)(1) cos 90◦=0 and similarly j •j=1, j •k=0
and k •k=1. Thus, only terms containing i •i, j •j or
k •k in the expansion above will not be zero.
Thus, the scalar product
a •b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3

From the geometry of Fig. 28.7, the length of diagonal
OP in terms of side lengths a, b and c can be obtained
from Pythagoras’ theorem as follows:
OP2 = OB2 + BP2 and
OB2 = OA2 + AB2
Thus, OP2 = OA2 + AB2 + BP2

Problem 6.
A constant force of
F=10i+2j−k newtons displaces an object from
A=i+j+k to B=2i−j+3k (in metres). Find the
work done in newton metres.
One of the applications of scalar products is to the work
done by a constant force when movinga body.The work
done is the product of the applied force and the distance
moved in the direction of the force.
i.e. work done = F • d
The principles developed in Problem 13, page 317,
apply equally to this problem when determining the
displacement. From the sketch shown in Fig. 28.8,
AB = AO+OB=OB−OA
that is AB = (2i −j + 3k) −(i + j + k)
= i −2j + 2k
A (1,1,1)
B (2, 21, 3)
O (0, 0, 0)

Section F

The work done is F • d, that is F • AB in this case
i.e. work done=(10i+2j−k) • (i −2j + 2k)
But from equation (2),
a •b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3
Hence work done=
(10×1)+(2×(−2))+((−1)×2)=4Nm
(Theoretically, it is quite possible to get a negative
answer to a ‘work done’ problem. This indicates that
the force must be in the opposite sense to that given, in
order to give the displacement stated.)

Vector products
A second product of two vectors is called the vector or
cross product and is deﬁned in terms of its modulus
and the magnitudes of the two vectors and the sine of
the angle between them. The vector product of vectors
oa and ob is written as oa×ob and is deﬁned by:
|oa×ob|=oa ob sinθ
where θ is the angle between the two vectors.
The direction of oa×ob is perpendicular to both oa and
ob, as shown in Fig. 28.9.

The direction is obtained by considering that a right-
handed screw is screwed along oa×ob with its head
at the origin and if the direction of oa×ob is cor-
rect, the head should rotate from oa to ob, as shown
in Fig. 28.9(a). It follows that the direction of ob×oa
is as shown in Fig. 28.9(b). Thus oa×ob is not equal to
ob×oa. The magnitudes of oa ob sinθ are the same but
their directions are 180◦displaced, i.e.
oa×ob=−ob×oa
The vector product of two vectors may be expressed in
terms of the unit vectors. Let two vectors, a and b, be
such that:
a = a1i + a2 j + a3k and
b = b1i + b2 j + b3k
Then,
a×b = (a1i + a2 j + a3k) × (b1i + b2 j + b3k)
= a1b1i × i + a1b2i × j
+a1b3i × k + a2b1 j × i + a2b2 j × j

But by the deﬁnition of a vector product,
i×j=k, j×k=i and k×i= j

a × b = a1b2k −a1b3 j −a2b1k + a2b3i

Grouping the i, j and k terms together, gives:
a×b = (a2b3 −a3b2)i + (a3b1 −a1b3)j
+ (a1b2 −a2b1)k

The magnitude of the vector product of two vectors can
be found by expressing it in scalar product form and
then using the relationship
a •b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3
Squaring both sides of a vector product equation gives:
(|a×b|)2 = a2b2 sin2 θ = a2b2(1 −cos2 θ)
= a2b2 −a2b2 cos2 θ
(6)
It is stated in Section 28.2 that a •b=abcosθ, hence
a •a = a2cosθ
But θ = 0◦,thus a •a = a2
Also, cosθ = a •b
ab
Multiplying both sides of this equation by a 2b2 and
squaring gives:
a2b2cos2 θ = a2b2(a •b)2

The equationof a straight line may be determined,given

AP=λb, where λ is a scalar quantity. Hence, from

If, say, r=xi+yj+zk, a=a1i+a2 j+a3k and

Introduction to calculus


Chapter 29
Methods of differentiation
Why it is important to understand: Methods of differentiation
There are many practical situations engineers have to analyse which involve quantities that are varying.
Typical examples include the stress in a loaded beam, the temperature of an industrial chemical, the
rate at which the speed of a vehicle is increasing or decreasing, the current in an electrical circuit or the
torque on a turbine blade. Further examples include the voltage on a transmission line, the rate of growth
of a bacteriological culture, and the rate at which the charge on a capacitor is changing. Differential
calculus, or differentiation, is a mathematical technique for analysing the way in which functions change.
There are many methods and rules of differentiation which are individually covered in the following
chapters. A good knowledge of algebra, in particular, laws of indices, is essential. Calculus is one of the
most powerful mathematical tools used by engineers. This chapter explains how to differentiate common
functions, products, quotients and function of a function – all important methods providing a basis for
further study in later chapters.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
differentiate common functions
•
differentiate a product using the product rule
•
differentiate a quotient using the quotient rule
•
differentiate a function of a function
•
differentiate successively
29.1
Introduction to calculus
Calculus is a branch of mathematics involving or lead-
ing to calculations dealing with continuously varying
functions – such as velocity and acceleration, rates
of change and maximum and minimum values of
curves.
Calculus has widespread applications in science and
engineering and is used to solve complicated problems
for which algebra alone is insufﬁcient.
Calculus is a subject that falls into two parts:
(i)
differential calculus, or differentiation, which
is covered in Chapters 29, 30 and 34 to 41, and
(ii)
integral calculus, or integration, which is cov-
ered in Chapters 31, 32 and 42 to 49.
29.2
The gradient of a curve
If a tangent is drawn at a point P on a curve, then the
gradient of this tangent is said to be the gradient of the
curve at P. In Fig. 29.1, the gradient of the curve at P
is equal to the gradient of the tangent PQ.

Thus as point B moves closer and closer to point A the
gradient of the chord approaches nearerandnearer tothe
value 2. This is called the limiting value of the gradient
of the chord AB and when B coincides with A the chord
becomes the tangent to the curve.
29.3 Differentiation from ﬁrst
principles
In Fig. 29.4, A and B are two points very close together
on a curve, δx (delta x) and δy (delta y) representing
small increments in the x and y directions, respectively.
Gradient of chord AB = δy
δx ; however,
δy =f (x +δx)−f (x)
Hence δy
δx = f (x +δx) −f (x)
δx

As δx approaches zero, δy
δx approaches a limiting value
and the gradient of the chord approaches the gradient of
the tangent at A.
When determining the gradient of a tangent to a curve
there are two notations used. The gradient of the curve
at A in Fig. 29.4 can either be written as

dx is the same as f ′(x) and is called the differential
coefﬁcient or the derivative. The process of ﬁnding the
differential coefﬁcient is called differentiation.
Problem 1.
Differentiate from ﬁrst principle
f (x)=x2 and determine the value of the gradient
of the curve at x =2
To ‘differentiate from ﬁrst principles’ means ‘to ﬁnd
f ′(x)’ by using the expression
f ′(x) = limit
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx

f (x) = x2
∗Who was Leibniz? For image and resume, see page 91. For
more information, go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
Substituting (x +δx) for x gives
f (x +δx)=(x +δx)2 =x2 + 2xδx + δx2, hence
f ′(x) = limit
δx→0
(x2 + 2xδx + δx2) −(x2)
δx

= limit
δx→0
(2xδx + δx2)
δx

= limit
δx→0 [2x + δx]
As δx →0, [2x +δx]→[2x +0]. Thus f ′(x)=2x, i.e.
the differential coefﬁcient of x 2 is 2x. At x =2, the
gradient of the curve, f ′(x)=2(2)=4
Differentiation from ﬁrst principles can be a lengthy
process and it would not be convenient togothrough this
procedure every time we want todifferentiate afunction.
In reality we do not have to because a set of general
rules have evolved from the above procedure, which we
consider in the following section.
29.4 Differentiation of common
functions
From differentiation by ﬁrst principles of a number of
examples such as in Problem 1 above, a general rule
for differentiating y =ax n emerges, where a and n are
constants.
The rule is: if y=axnthen dy
dx =anxn−1
(or, if f(x)=axn thenf ′(x)=anxn−1) and is true for all
real values of a and n.
For example, if y =4x3 then a =4 and n=3, and
dy
dx = anxn−1 = (4)(3)x3−1 = 12x2
If y =axn and n=0 then y =ax0 and
dy
dx =(a)(0)x0−1 =0,
i.e. the differential coefﬁcient of a constant is zero.
Fig. 29.5(a) shows a graph of y = sinx. The gradient
is continually changing as the curve moves from 0 to
A to B to C to D. The gradient, given by dy
dx , may be
plotted in a corresponding position below y = sinx, as
shown in Fig. 29.5(b).

(i)
At 0, the gradient is positive and is at its steepest.
Hence 0′ is a maximum positive value.
(ii)
Between 0 and A the gradient is positive but is
decreasingin value until at A the gradientis zero,
shown as A′.
(iii)
Between A and B the gradient is negative but
is increasing in value until at B the gradient is at
its steepest negative value. Hence B′ is a maxi-
mum negative value.
(iv)
If the gradient of y = sinx is further investigated
between B and D then the resulting graph of dy
dx
is seen to be a cosine wave. Hence the rate of
change of sinx is cosx,
i.e. if y=sin x then dy
dx =cos x
By a similar construction to that shown in Fig. 29.5 it
may be shown that:
if y=sin ax then dy
dx =a cos ax
If graphs of y = cosx, y =ex and y = lnx are plotted
and their gradients investigated, their differential coef-
ﬁcients may be determined in a similar manner to that
shown for y = sinx. The rate of change of a function is
a measure of the derivative.

The differential coefﬁcient of a sum or difference is
the sum or difference of the differential coefﬁcients of
the separate terms.
Thus, if f (x)=p(x) + q(x) −r(x),
(where f,p,q and r are functions),
then
f ′(x) =p′(x) + q′(x) −r′(x)
Differentiation of common functions is demonstrated in
the following worked Problems.
Problem 2.
Find the differential coefﬁcients of
(a) y =12x3 (b) y = 12
x3
If y =axn then dy
dx =anxn−1
(a)
Since
y = 12x3,
a =12
and
n=3
thus
dy
dx =(12)(3)x3−1=36x2
(b)
y = 12
x3 is rewritten in the standard axn form as
y =12x−3 and in the general rule a =12 and
n=−3
Thus dy
dx =(12)(−3)x−3−1=−36x−4 = −36

Problem 3.
Differentiate (a) y =6 (b) y =6x
(a)
y =6 may be written as y =6x 0, i.e. in the general
rule a =6 and n=0
Hence dy
dx = (6)(0)x0−1 = 0

Section G

349
In general, the differential coefﬁcient of a con-
stant is always zero.
(b)
Since y =6x, in the general rule a =6 and n=1
Hence dy
dx = (6)(1)x1−1 = 6x0 = 6

y =3x4−2x2 +5x −2
Then the gradient= dy

At the point (0, −2), x =0
Thus the gradient=12(0)3−4(0)+5=5

Function of a function
It is often easier to make a substitution before differen-
tiating.
If y is a function of x then
dy
dx = dy
du × du
dx
This is known as the ‘function of a function’ rule (or
sometimes the chain rule).
For example, if y =(3x −1)9 then, by making the sub-
stitution u=(3x −1), y =u9, which is of the ‘standard’
form.
Hence dy
du = 9u8 and du
dx = 3
Then dy
dx = dy
du × du
dx =(9u8)(3)=27u8
Rewriting u as (3x −1) gives: dy
dx =27(3x−1)8
Since y is a function of u, and u is a function of x, then
y is a function of a function of x.

When a function y =f (x) is differentiated with respect

If the expression is differentiated again, the second dif-

(pronounced f double-dash x).
By successive differentiation further higher derivatives

Some applications of
differentiation
Why it is important to understand: Some applications of differentiation
In the previous chapter some basic differentiation techniques were explored, sufﬁcient to allow us to
look at some applications of differential calculus. Some practical rates of change problems are initially
explained, followed by some practical velocity and acceleration problems. Determining maximum and
minimum points and points of inﬂexion on curves, together with some practical maximum and minimum
problems follow. Tangents and normals to curves and errors and approximations complete this initial
look at some applications of differentiation. In general, with these applications, the differentiation tends
to be straightforward.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine rates of change using differentiation
•
solve velocity and acceleration problems
•
understand turning points
•
determine the turning points on a curve and determine their nature
•
solve practical problems involving maximum and minimum values
•
determine points of inﬂexion on a curve
•
determine tangents and normals to a curve
•
determine small changes in functions
30.1
Rates of change
If a quantity y depends on and varies with a quantity
x then the rate of change of y with respect to x is dy
dx .
Thus, for example, the rate of change of pressure p with
height h is dp
dh
A rate of change with respect to time is usually just
called ‘the rate of change’, the ‘with respect to time’
being assumed. Thus, for example, a rate of change of
current, i, is di
dt and a rate of change of temperature,
θ, is dθ
dt , and so on.

Velocity and acceleration
When a car moves a distance xmetres in a time t seconds
along a straight road, if the velocity v is constant then
v = x
t m/s, i.e. the gradient of the distance/time graph
shown in Fig. 30.1 is constant.
If, however,the velocity of the car is not constant then
the distance/time graph will not be a straight line. It may
be as shown in Fig. 30.2.
The average velocity over a small time δt and distance
δx is given by the gradient of the chord AB, i.e. the
average velocity over time δt is δx
δt
As δt →0, the chord AB becomes a tangent, such that
at point A, the velocity is given by:
v = dx

Hence the velocity of the car at any instant is given by
the gradient of the distance/time graph. If an expres-
sion for the distance x is known in terms of time
t then the velocity is obtained by differentiating the
expression.
The acceleration a of the car is deﬁned as the rate
of change of velocity. A velocity/time graph is shown
in Fig. 30.3. If δv is the change in v and δt the
corresponding change in time, then a = δv
δt
As δt →0, the chord CD becomes a tangent, such that
at point C, the acceleration is given by:
a = dv
dt
Hence the acceleration of the car at any instant is
given by the gradient of the velocity/time graph. If an
expression for velocity is known in terms of time t
then the acceleration is obtained by differentiating the
expression.

Supplies are dropped from a

travels before it stops.
(a)
Distance, x =20t −5

Hence velocity v = dx

(a)
Angular displacement θ =9t 2 −2t3 rad
Angular velocity ω= dθ

When time t =1s,

When time t =1s,
α = 18 −12(1) = 6rad/s2
(b)
When the angular acceleration is zero,
18−12t =0, from which, 18=12t, giving time,

Turning points
In Fig. 30.4, the gradient (or rate of change) of the
curve changes from positive between O and P to
negative between P and Q, and then positive again
between Q and R. At point P, the gradient is zero
and, as x increases, the gradient of the curve changes
from positive just before P to negative just after.
Such a point is called a maximum point and appears
as the ‘crest of a wave’. At point Q, the gradient
is also zero and, as x increases, the gradient of the
curve changes from negative just before Q to positive
just after. Such a point is called a minimum point,
and appears as the ‘bottom of a valley’. Points such
as P and Q are given the general name of turning
points.

It is possible to have a turning point, the gradient on
either side of which is the same. Such a point is given
the special name of a point of inﬂexion, and examples
are shown in Fig. 30.5.
Maximum and minimum points and points of
inﬂexion are given the general term of stationary
points.
Procedure for ﬁnding and distinguishing between
stationary points:
(i)
Given y =f (x), determine dy

Let dy
dx =0 and solve for the values of x.

ordinate values. This establishes the co-ordinates
of the stationary points.
To determine the nature of the stationary points:
Either
(iv)
Find d2y
dx2 and substitute into it the values of x
found in (ii).
If the result is:
(a)
positive −the point is a minimum one,
(b)
negative −the point is a maximum one,
(c)
zero −the point is a point of inﬂexion,
or
(v)
Determine the sign of the gradientof the curve just
before and just after the stationary points. If the
sign change for the gradient of the curve is:
(a)
positive to negative −the point is a maxi-
mum one,
(b)
negative to positive −the point is a minimum
one,
(c)
positive to positive or negative to negative −
the point is a point of inﬂexion.
For more on points of inﬂexion, see Section 30.5.
Problem 10.
Locate the turning point on the
curve y =3x2−6x and determine its nature by
examining the sign of the gradient on either side.
Following the above procedure:
(i)
Since y =3x2−6x, dy
dx =6x −6
(ii)
At a turning point, dy
dx =0. Hence 6x −6=0,
from which, x =1

Section G
Some applications of differentiation
363
(iii)
When x =1, y =3(1)2−6(1)=−3
Hence the co-ordinates of the turning point
are (1, −3)
(iv)
If x is slightly less than 1, say, 0.9, then
dy
dx = 6(0.9) −6 = −0.6,
i.e. negative.
If x is slightly greater than 1, say, 1.1, then
dy
dx = 6(1.1) −6 = 0.6,
i.e. positive.
Since the gradient of the curve is negative just
before the turning point and positive just after
(i.e. −∨+), (1, −3) is a minimum point.
Problem 11.
Find the maximum and minimum
values of the curve y =x 3−3x +5 by
(a)
examining the gradient on either side of the
turning points, and
(b)
determining the sign of the second derivative.
Since y =x3 −3x +5 then dy
dx =3x2−3
For a maximum or minimum value dy
dx =0
Hence 3x2−3=0, from which, 3x 2=3 and x = ± 1
When x =1, y =(1)3−3(1)+5=3
When x =−1, y =(−1)3 −3(−1)+5=7
Hence (1, 3) and (−1,7) are the co-ordinates of the
turning points.
(a)
Considering the point (1, 3):
If x is slightly less than 1, say 0.9, then
dy
dx = 3(0.9)2 −3,
which is negative.
If x is slightly more than 1, say 1.1, then
dy
dx = 3(1.1)2 −3,
which is positive.
Since the gradient changes from negative to posi-
tive, the point (1, 3) is a minimum point.
Considering the point (−1,7):
If x is slightly less than −1, say −1.1, then
dy
dx = 3(−1.1)2 −3,
which is positive.
If x is slightly more than −1, say −0.9, then
dy
dx = 3(−0.9)2 −3,
which is negative.
Since the gradient changes from positive to nega-
tive, the point (−1, 7) is a maximum point.
(b)
Since dy
dx = 3x2 −3, then d2y
dx2 = 6x
When x =1, d2y
dx2 is positive, hence (1, 3) is a
minimum value.
When x = −1, d2y
dx2 is negative, hence (−1, 7) is
a maximum value.
Thus the maximum value is 7 and the min-
imum value is 3
Itcanbeseenthattheseconddifferentialmethodof
determining the nature of the turning points is, in
this case, quicker than investigating the gradient.
Problem 12.
Locate the turning point on the
following curve and determine whether it is a
maximum or minimum point: y =4θ +e−θ
Since
y =4θ + e−θ
then
dy
dθ =4 −e−θ = 0
for a maximum or minimum value.
Hence 4=e−θ, 1
4 =eθ, giving θ = ln 1
4 =−1.3863 (see
Chapter 4).
When θ = −1.3863, y =4(−1.3863)+e−(−1.3863)
= 5.5452+4.0000=−1.5452
Thus (−1.3863, −1.5452) are the co-ordinates of the
turning point.
d2y
dθ2 = e−θ
When θ =−1.3863,
d2y
dθ2 = e+1.3863 = 4.0,

which is positive, hence (−1.3863, −1.5452) is a
minimum point.

(ii)
At a turning point, dy

from which x =−2 or x =3

When x =−2,
y = (−2)3

Hence (−2, 9) is a maximum point.

30.4 Practical problems involving
maximum and minimum values
There are many practical problems involving maxi-
mum and minimum values which occur in science and
engineering. Usually, an equation has to be determined
from given data, and rearranged where necessary, so
that it contains only one variable. Some examples are
demonstrated in Problems 15 to 20.
Problem 15.
A rectangular area is formed having
a perimeter of 40cm. Determine the length and
breadth of the rectangle if it is to enclose the
maximum possible area.
Let the dimensions of the rectangle be x and y. Then
the perimeter of the rectangle is (2x +2y). Hence
2x + 2y = 40
or
x + y = 20
(1)
Since the rectangle is to enclose the maximum possible
area, a formula for area A must be obtained in terms of
one variable only.
Area A=xy. From equation (1), x =20−y

Section G
366
Higher Engineering Mathematics
Hence, area A=(20−y)y =20y −y 2
dA
dy = 20 −2y = 0
for a turning point, from which, y =10cm
d2A
dy2 = −2,
which is negative, giving a maximum point.
When y =10cm, x =10cm, from equation (1)
Hence the length and breadth of the rectangle are
each 10cm, i.e. a square gives the maximum possible
area. When the perimeter of a rectangle is 40cm, the
maximum possible area is 10×10= 100cm2.
Problem 16.
A rectangular sheet of metal having
dimensions 20cm by 12cm has squares removed
from each of the four corners and the sides bent
upwards to form an open box. Determine the
maximum possible volume of the box.
The squares to be removed from each corner are shown
in Fig. 30.8, having sides x cm. When the sides are bent
upwards the dimensions of the box will be:
length (20−2x)cm, breadth (12−2x)cm and height
x cm.

for a turning point.
Hence 4(60 −32x + 3x2) = 0,

Using the quadratic formula,
x = 32 ±

(−32)2 −4(3)(60)
2(3)
= 8.239cm or 2.427cm.
Since the breadth is (12 −2x)cm then x =8.239cm is
not possible and is neglected. Hence x =2.427cm
d2V
dx2 = −128 + 24x
When x =2.427, d2V
dx2
is negative, giving a max-
imum value.
The dimensions of the box are:
length = 20 −2(2.427) = 15.146cm,
breadth = 12 −2(2.427) = 7.146cm,
and height = 2.427cm
Maximum volume = (15.146)(7.146)(2.427)
= 262.7cm3
Problem 17.
Determine the height and radius of a
cylinder of volume 200cm3 which has the least
surface area.
Let the cylinder have radius r and perpendicular
height h.
Volume of cylinder,
V = πr2h = 200
(1)
Surface area of cylinder,
A = 2πrh + 2πr2
Least surface area means minimum surface area and a
formula for the surface area in terms of one variable
only is required.
From equation (1),
h = 200

From equation (2),
when r = 3.169cm,
h =

π(3.169)2 = 6.339cm
Hence for the least surface area, a cylinder of vol-
ume 200cm3 has a radius of 3.169cm and height of
6.339cm.
Problem 18.
Determine the area of the largest
piece of rectangular ground that can be enclosed by

Let the dimensions of the rectangle be x and y as shown

Hence area A=xy=(100−2y)y=100y−2y2
dA
dy = 100 −4y = 0,
for a turning point, from which, y =25m
d2A
dy2 = −4,
which is negative, giving a maximum value.
When y =25m, x =50m from equation (1).
Hence the maximum possible area
=xy = (50)(25)=1250m2
Problem 19.
An open rectangular box with
square ends is ﬁtted with an overlapping lid which
covers the top and the front face. Determine the
maximum volume of the box if 6m2 of metal are
used in its construction.
A rectangular box having square ends of side x and
length y is shown in Fig. 30.10.

Surface area of box, A, consists of two ends and ﬁve
faces (since the lid also covers the front face).
Hence

Since it is the maximum volume required, a formula
for the volume in terms of one variable only is needed.

Points of inﬂexion
As mentioned earlier in the chapter, it is possible to have
a turning point, the gradient on either side of which is
the same. This is called a point of inﬂexion.
Procedure to determine points of inﬂexion:
(i)
Given y = f (x), determine dy
dx and d2y
dx2
(ii)
Solve the equation d2y
dx2 = 0
(iii)
Test whether there is a change of sign occurring
in d2y
dx2 . This is achieved by substituting into the
expression for d2y
dx2 ﬁrstly a value of x just less
than the solution and then a value just greater than
the solution.
(iv)
A point of inﬂexion has been found if d2y
dx2 = 0
and there is a change of sign.
This procedureis demonstratedin the following worked
Problems.
Problem 21.
Determine the point(s) of inﬂexion
(if any) on the graph of the function
y = x3 −6x2 + 9x + 5
Find also any other turning points. Hence, sketch
the graph.
Using the above procedure:
(i)
Given y = x3 −6x2 + 9x + 5,
dy
dx = 3x2 −12x + 9 and d2y
dx2 = 6x −12
(ii)
Solving the equation d2y
dx2 = 0 gives: 6x −12 = 0
from which, 6x = 12 and x = 2
Hence, if there is a point of inﬂexion, it occurs at
x = 2

Section G
370
Higher Engineering Mathematics
(iii)
Taking a value just less than 2, say, 1.9:
d2y
dx2 = 6x −12 = 6(1.9) −12, which is negative.
Taking a value just greater than 2, say, 2.1:
d2y
dx2 = 6x −12 = 6(2.1) −12, which is positive.
(iv)
Since a change of sign has occurred a point of
inﬂexion exists at x = 2
When x = 2,y = 23 −6(2)2 + 9(2) + 5 = 7
i.e. a point of inﬂexion occurs at the co-ordinates
(2, 7)
From above, dy
dx = 3x2 −12x + 9 = 0 for a turning
point
i.e. x2 −4x + 3 = 0
Using the quadratic formula or factorising (or by calcu-
lator), the solution is: x = 1 or x = 3
Since
y = x3 −6x2 + 9x + 5,
then
when
x = 1,
y = 13 −6(1)2 + 9(1) + 5 = 9
and when x = 3,y = 33 −6(3)2 + 9(3) + 5 = 5
Hence, there are turning points at (1, 9) and at (3, 5)
Since d2y
dx2 = 6x −12, when x = 1, d2y
dx2 = 6(1) −12
which is negative – hence a maximum point
and when x = 3, d2y
dx2 = 6(3) −12 which is positive –
hence a minimum point.
Thus, (1, 9) is a maximum point and (3, 5) is a
minimum point.
A sketch of the graph y = x 3 −6x2 + 9x + 5 is shown
in Figure 30.12
Problem 22.
Determine the point(s) of inﬂexion
(if any) on the graph of the function
y = x4 −24x2 + 5x + 60
Using the above procedure:
(i)
Given y = x4 −24x2 + 5x + 60,
dy
dx = 4x3 −48x + 5 and d2y
dx2 = 12x2 −48
(ii)
Solving the equation d2y
dx2 = 0 gives:
12x2 −48 = 0 from which, 12x 2 = 48
and x2 = 4 from which, x =
√
4 = ±2
Hence, if there are points of inﬂexion, they occur
at x = 2 and at x = −2
(iii)
Taking a value just less than 2, say, 1.9:
d2y
dx2 = 12x2 −48 = 12(1.9)2 −48,
which
is
negative.
Taking
a
value
just
greater
than
2,
say,
2.1: d2y
dx2 = 12x2 −48 = 12(2.1)2 −48, which is
positive.
Taking a value just less than −2, say, −2.1:
d2y
dx2 = 12x2 −48 = 12(−2.1)2 −48, which is
positive.
Taking a value just greater than −2, say, −1.9:
d2y
dx2 = 12x2 −48 = 12(−1.9)2 −48, which is
negative.
(iv)
Since changes of signs have occurred, points of
inﬂexion exist at x = 2 and x = −2
When x = 2,y=24 −24(2)2 + 5(2) + 60=−10
When x = −2,
y = (−2)4 −24(−2)2 + 5(−2) + 60 = −30
i.e. points of inﬂexion occur at the co-ordinates
(2, −10) and at ( −2, −30)

The equation of the tangent to a curve y =f (x) at the
point (x1,y1) is given by:
y −y1 = m(x −x1)
where m= dy
dx =gradient of the curve at (x1,y1)

Find the equation of the tangent to
the curve y =x2 −x −2 at the point (1, −2)
Gradient, m

dx = 2x −1
At the point (1, −2), x =1 and m=2(1)−1=1
Hence the equation of the tangent is:
y −y1 = m(x −x1)
i.e. y −(−2) = 1(x −1)
i.e.
y + 2 = x −1
or
y = x −3
The graph of y =x2 −x −2 is shown in Fig. 30.13. The
line AB is the tangent to the curve at the point C, i.e.
(1, −2), and the equation of this line is y =x −3
Normals
The normal at any point on a curve is the line which
passes through the point and is at right angles to the
tangent. Hence, in Fig. 30.13, the line CD is the normal.

[Obviously, in this case, the exact value of dy may
be obtained by evaluating y when x =1.02, i.e.
y =4(1.02)2−1.02=3.1416 and then subtracting from
it the value of y when x =1, i.e. y=4(1)2 −1=3, giving

Standard integration
Why it is important to understand: Standard integration
Engineering is all about problem solving and many problems in engineering can be solved using calculus.
Physicists, chemists, engineers, and many other scientiﬁc and technical specialists use calculus in their
everyday work; it is a technique of fundamental importance. Both integration and differentiation have
numerous applications in engineering and science and some typical examples include determining areas,
mean and rms values, volumes of solids of revolution, centroids, second moments of area, differential
equations and Fourier series. Besides the standard integrals covered in this chapter, there are a number of
other methods of integration covered in later chapters. For any further studies in engineering, differential
and integral calculus are unavoidable.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand that integration is the reverse process of differentiation
•
determine integrals of the form ax n where n is fractional, zero, or a positive or negative integer
•
integrate standard functions: cosax, sinax, sec2 ax, cosec 2ax, cosecax,cotax, secax,tanax, eax, 1
x
•
evaluate deﬁnite integrals
31.1
The process of integration
The process of integration reverses the process of
differentiation. In differentiation, if f (x)=2x 2 then
f ′(x)=4x. Thus the integral of 4x is 2x 2, i.e. integra-
tion is the process of moving from f ′(x) to f (x). By
similar reasoning, the integral of 2t is t 2
Integration is a process of summation or adding parts
together and an elongated S, shown as

, is used to
replace the words ‘the integral of’. Hence, from above,

4x =2x2 and

2t is t2
In differentiation, the differential coefﬁcient dy
dx indi-
cates that a function of x is being differentiated with
respect to x, the dx indicating that it is ‘with respect
to x’. In integration the variable of integration is shown
by adding d (the variable) after the function to be
integrated.
Thus

4x dx means ‘the integral of 4x
with respect to x’,
and

2t dt means ‘the integral of 2t
with respect to t’.
As stated above, the differential coefﬁcient of 2x 2 is
4x, hence  4x dx =2x2. However, the differential coef-
ﬁcient of 2x2+7 is also 4x. Hence

4x dx is also equal
to 2x2 +7. To allow for the possible presence of a con-
stant, whenever the process of integration is performed,
a constant ‘c’ is added to the result.
Thus

4x dx =2x2 +c and

2t dt =t2 +c
‘c’ is called the arbitrary constant of integration.

Deﬁnite integrals
Integrals containing an arbitrary constant c in their
results are called indeﬁnite integrals since their precise
value cannot be determined without further information.
Deﬁnite integrals are those in which limits are applied.
If an expression is written as [x]b
a, ‘b’ is called the upper
limit and ‘a’ the lower limit. The operation of applying
the limits is deﬁned as [x]b
a =(b)−(a)
The increase in the value of the integral x 2as x increases
from 1 to 3 is written as
 3
1 x2 dx.
Applying the limits gives:

Chapter 32
Some applications of
integration
Why it is important to understand: Some applications of integration
Engineering is all about problem solving and many problems in engineering can be solved using integral
calculus. One important application is to ﬁnd the area bounded by a curve; often such an area can have a
physical signiﬁcance like the work done by a motor, or the distance travelled by a vehicle. Other examples
can involve position, velocity, force, charge density, resistivity and current density. Electrical currents
and voltages often vary with time and engineers may wish to know the average or mean value of such
a current or voltage over some particular time interval. An associated quantity is the root mean square
(rms) value of a current which is used, for example, in the calculation of the power dissipated by a resistor.
Mean and rms values are required with alternating currents and voltages, pressure of sound waves, and
much more. Revolving a plane ﬁgure about an axis generates a volume, called a solid of revolution,
and integration may be used to calculate such a volume. There are many applications in engineering,
and particularly in manufacturing. Centroids of basic shapes can be intuitive −such as the centre of
a circle; centroids of more complex shapes can be found using integral calculus −as long as the area,
volume or line of an object can be described by a mathematical equation. Centroids are of considerable
importance in manufacturing, and in mechanical, civil and structural design engineering. The second
moment of area is a property of a cross-section that can be used to predict the resistance of a beam to
bending and deﬂection around an axis that lies in the cross-sectional plane. The stress in, and deﬂection
of, a beam under load depends not only on the load but also on the geometry of the beam’s cross-section;
larger values of second moment cause smaller values of stress and deﬂection. This is why beams with
larger second moments of area, such as I-beams, are used in building construction in preference to other
beams with the same cross-sectional area. The second moment of area has applications in many scientiﬁc
disciplines including ﬂuid mechanics, engineering mechanics, and biomechanics −for example to study
the structural properties of bone during bending. The static roll stability of a ship depends on the second
moment of area of the waterline section −short fat ships are stable, long thin ones are not. It is clear that
calculations involving areas, mean and rms values, volumes, centroids and second moment of area are
very important in many areas of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
calculate areas under and between curves
•
determine the mean and rms value of a function over a given range
•
determine the volume of a solid of revolution between given limits
•
determine the centroid of an area between a curve and given axes
•
deﬁne and use the theorem of Pappus to determine the centroid of an area
•
determine the second moment of area and radius of gyration of regular sections and composite areas

Problem 1.
Determine the area between the curve
y = x3 −2x2 −8x and the x-axis.
y = x3−2x2 −8x = x(x2−2x −8) = x(x + 2)(x −4)
When y = 0, x = 0 or (x + 2) = 0 or (x −4) = 0, i.e.
when y = 0, x = 0 or −2 or 4, which means that the
curve crosses the x-axis at 0, −2, and 4. Since the curve
is a continuous function, only one other co-ordinate
value needs to be calculated before a sketch of the
curve can be produced. When x = 1, y = −9, show-
ing that the part of the curve between x = 0 and x = 4
is negative. A sketch of y = x3 −2x2 −8x is shown in
Fig. 32.2. (Another method of sketchingFig. 32.2 would
have been to draw up a table of values.)

Problem 2.
Determine the area enclosed between
the curves y = x2 + 1 and y = 7 −x.
At the points of intersection the curves are equal. Thus,
equating the y values of each curve gives:
x2 + 1= 7 −x
from which,
x2 + x −6= 0
Factorising gives (x −2)(x + 3)= 0
from which x = 2 and x = −3
By ﬁrstly determining the points of intersection the
range of x-values has been found. Tables of values are

equating the y2 values at the points of intersection:
x4 = 8x

Centroids
A lamina is a thin, ﬂat sheet having uniform thickness.
The centre of gravity of a lamina is the point where
it balances perfectly, i.e. the lamina’s centre of mass.
When dealing with an area (i.e. a lamina of negligible
thickness and mass) the term centre of area or centroid
is used for the point where the centre of gravity of a
lamina of that shape would lie.

Theorem of Pappus
A theorem of Pappus∗states:
‘If a plane area is rotated about an axis in its own plane
but not intersecting it, the volume of the solid formed is
given by the product of the area and the distance moved
by the centroid of the area’.
With reference to Fig. 32.11, when the curve y =f (x)
is rotated one revolution about the x-axis between
the limits x = a and x = b, the volume V generated
is given by:
volume V = (A)(2πy), from which, y=

32.7 Second moments of area of
regular sections
The ﬁrst moment of area about a ﬁxed axis of a lamina
of area A, perpendicular distance y from the centroid
of the lamina is deﬁned as Ay cubic units. The second
moment of area of the same lamina as above is given
by Ay2, i.e. the perpendiculardistance from the centroid
of the area to the ﬁxed axis is squared.
Second moments of areas are usually denoted by I and
have units of mm4, cm4, and so on.
Radius of gyration
Several areas, a1, a2, a3,... at distances y1, y2, y3,...
from a ﬁxed axis, may be replaced by a single area
A, where A = a1 + a2 + a3 + ··· at distance k from the
axis, such that Ak2 =  ay2.
k is called the radius of gyration of area A about the
given axis. Since Ak2 =  ay2 = I then the radius of
gyration,
k =
!
I
A
The second moment of area is a quantity much used in
the theory of bending of beams, in the torsion of shafts,
and in calculations involving water planes and centres
of pressure.
The procedure to determine the second moment of area
of regular sections about a given axis is (i) to ﬁnd the
second moment of area of a typical element and (ii) to
sum all such second moments of area by integrating
between appropriate limits.
For example, the second moment of area of the rectangle
shown in Fig. 32.14 about axis PP is found by initially
considering an elemental strip of width δx, parallel to
and distance x from axis PP. Area of shaded strip = bδx

Second moment of area of the shaded strip about

0 and x = l, i.e.  x=l
x=0 x2 bδx

Introduction to differential
equations
Why it is important to understand: Solution of ﬁrst-order differential equations by separation of variables
Differentialequations play an important role in modelling virtuallyevery physical, technical, or biological
process, from celestial motion, to bridge design, to interactions between neurons. Further applications
are found in ﬂuid dynamics with the design of containers and funnels, in heat conduction analysis with
the design of heat spreaders in microelectronics, in rigid-body dynamic analysis, with falling objects, and
in exponential growth of current in an R–L circuit, to name but a few. This chapter introduces ﬁrst-order
differential equations – the subject is clearly of great importance in many different areas of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
sketch a family of curves given a simple derivative
•
deﬁne a differential equation – ﬁrst-order, second-order, general solution, particular solution, boundary
conditions
•
solve a differential equation of the form dy
dx = f (x)
•
solve a differential equation of the form dy
dx = f (y)
•
solve a differential equation of the form dy
dx = f (x) · f (y)
33.1
Family of curves
Integrating both sides of the derivative dy
dx =3 with
respect to x gives y =  3dx, i.e., y =3x +c, where c
is an arbitrary constant.
y =3x +c represents a family of curves, each of the
curves in the family depending on the value of c.
Examples include y =3x +8, y =3x +3, y =3x and
y =3x −10 and these are shown in Fig. 33.1.
Each are straight lines of gradient 3. A particular curve
of a family may be determined when a point on the

Sketch the family of curves given by

y =2x2 +15,
y =2x2 +8,
y =2x2
and
y =2x2−6,
and
these
are shown in Fig. 33.2. To determine the equa-
tion of the curve passing through the point (2, 3),
x =2 and y =3 are substituted into the equation
y =2x2 +c
Thus 3=2(2)2 +c, from which c=3−8=−5

Differential equations are classiﬁed according to the

Starting with a differential equation it is possible,
by integration and by being given sufﬁcient data to
determine unknown constants, to obtain the original
function. This process is called ‘solving the differ-
ential equation’. A solution to a differential equation
which contains one or more arbitrary constants of inte-
gration is called the general solution of the differential
equation.
When additional information is given so that con-
stants may be calculated the particular solution of the
differential equation is obtained. The additional infor-
mation is called boundary conditions. It was shown in

Chapter 34
Differentiation of parametric
equations
Why it is important to understand: Differentiation of parametric equations
Rather than using a single equation to deﬁne two variables with respect to one another, parametric
equations exist as a set that relates the two variables to one another with respect to a third variable.
Some curves are easier to describe using a pair of parametric equations. The coordinates x and y of
the curve are given using a third variable t, such as x = f (t) and y = g(t), where t is referred to as the
parameter. Hence, for a given value of t, a point (x,y) is determined. For example, let t be the time while
x and y are the positions of a particle; the parametric equations then describe the path of the particle at
different times. Parametric equations are useful in deﬁning three-dimensional curves and surfaces, such
as determining the velocity or acceleration of a particle following a three-dimensional path. CAD systems
use parametric versions of equations. Sometimes in engineering, differentiation of parametric equations
is necessary, for example, when determining the radius of curvature of part of the surface when ﬁnding
the surface tension of a liquid. Knowledge of standard differentials and the function of a function rule
from previous chapters are needed to be able to differentiate parametric equations.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise parametric equations – ellipse, parabola, hyperbola, rectangular hyperbola, cardioids, asteroid and
cycloid
•
differentiate parametric equations
34.1 Introduction to parametric
equations
Certain mathematical functions can be expressed more
simply by expressing, say, x and y separately in terms
of a third variable. For example, y =r sin θ, x =r cos θ.
Then, any value given to θ will produce a pair of values
for x and y, which may be plotted to provide a curve of
y =f (x).
The third variable, θ, is called a parameter and the
two expressions for y and x are called parametric
equations.
The above example of y =r sin θ and x =r cos θ are the
parametric equations for a circle. The equation of any
point on a circle, centre at the origin and of radius r is
given by: x2 +y2 =r2, as shown in Chapter 14.
To show that y =r sin θ and x =r cos θ are suitable
parametric equations for such a circle:

Differentiation of implicit
functions
Why it is important to understand: Differentiation of implicit functions
Differentiation of implicit functions is another special technique, but it occurs often enough to be impor-
tant. It is needed for more complicated problems involving different rates of change. Up to this chapter
we have been ﬁnding derivatives of functions of the form y = f (x); unfortunately not all functions fall
into this form. However, implicit differentiation is nothing more than a special case of the function of a
function (or chain rule) for derivatives. Engineering applications where implicit differentiation is needed
are found in optics, electronics, control, and even some thermodynamics.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise implicit functions
•
differentiate simple implicit functions
•
differentiate implicit functions containing products and quotients
35.1
Implicit functions
When an equation can be written in the form y =f (x)
it is said to be an explicit function of x. Examples of
explicit functions include
y = 2x3−3x +4,
y = 2x lnx
and y = 3ex
cosx
In these examples y may be differentiated with respect
to x by using standard derivatives, the product rule and
the quotient rule of differentiation respectively.
Sometimes with equations involving, say, y and x,
it is impossible to make y the subject of the formula.
The equation is then called an implicit function and
examples of such functions include
y3 +2x2= y2 −x and siny =x2+2xy
35.2 Differentiating implicit
functions
It is possible to differentiate an implicit function by
using the function of a function rule, which may be
stated as
du
dx = du
dy × dy
dx
Thus, to differentiate y3 with respect to x, the
substitution u=y3 is made, from which, du
dy =3y2

Logarithmic differentiation
Why it is important to understand: Logarithmic differentiation
Logarithmic differentiation is a means of differentiating algebraically complicated functions or functions
for which the ordinary rules of differentiation do not apply. The technique is performed in cases where
it is easier to differentiate the logarithm of a function rather than the function itself. Logarithmic differ-
entiation relies on the function of a function rule (i.e. chain rule) as well as properties of logarithms (in
particular, the natural logarithm, or logarithm to the base e) to transform products into sums and divi-
sions into subtractions, and can also be applied to functions raised to the power of variables of functions.
Logarithmic differentiation occurs often enough in engineering calculations to make it an important
technique.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state the laws of logarithms
•
differentiate simple logarithmic functions
•
differentiate an implicit function involving logarithms
•
differentiate more difﬁcult logarithmic functions involving products and quotients
•
differentiate functions of the form y = [f (x)] x
36.1 Introduction to logarithmic
differentiation
With certain functions containing more complicated
products and quotients, differentiation is often made
easier if the logarithm of the function is taken before
differentiating. This technique, called ‘logarithmic
differentiation’ is achieved with a knowledge of (i) the
laws of logarithms, (ii) the differential coefﬁcients of
logarithmic functions, and (iii) the differentiation of
implicit functions.
36.2
Laws of logarithms
Three laws of logarithms may be expressed as:
(i)
log(A × B)=logA+logB
(ii)
log
A
B

= logA −logB
(iii)
logAn =nlogA
In calculus, Napierian logarithms (i.e. logarithms to a
base of ‘e’) are invariably used. Thus for two func-
tions f (x) and g(x) the laws of logarithms may be
expressed as:
(i)
ln[f (x)·g(x)]= lnf (x)+lng(x)
(ii)
ln
f (x)
g(x)

= lnf (x)−lng(x)
(iii)
ln[f (x)]n=nlnf (x)

Taking Napierian logarithms of both sides of the equa-
tion y = f (x)·g(x)
h(x)
gives:
lny = ln
f (x)·g(x)
h(x)

which may be simpliﬁed using the above laws of
logarithms, giving:
lny = lnf (x) + lng(x) −lnh(x)
This latter form of the equation is often easier to
differentiate.
36.3 Differentiation of logarithmic
functions
The differential coefﬁcient of the logarithmic function
lnx is given by:
d
dx(lnx) = 1
x
More generally, it may be shown that:
d
dx[lnf(x)] = f ′(x)
f(x)
(1)
For example, if y = ln(3x2 + 2x −1) then,
dy
dx =
6x +2
3x2 +2x −1
Similarly, if y = ln(sin3x) then
dy
dx = 3cos3x
sin3x = 3 cot 3x

Differentiation of an expression such as
y = (1 + x)2√(x −1)

may be achieved by using the
product and quotient rules of differentiation; how-
ever the working would be rather complicated. With
logarithmic differentiation the following procedure is
adopted:

Take Napierian logarithms of both sides of the
equation.
Thus lny = ln

Chapter 38
Differentiation of inverse
trigonometric and
hyperbolic functions
Why it is important to understand: Differentiation of inverse trigonometric hyperbolic functions
As has been mentioned earlier, hyperbolic functions have applications in many areas of engineering.
For example, the hyperbolic sine arises in the gravitational potential of a cylinder, the hyperbolic cosine
function is the shape of a hanging cable, the hyperbolic tangent arises in the calculation of and rapidity
of special relativity, the hyperbolic secant arises in the proﬁle of a laminar jet, and the hyperbolic cotan-
gent arises in the Langevin function for magnetic polarisation. So there are plenty of applications for
inverse functions in engineering and this chapter explains how to differentiate inverse trigonometric and
hyperbolic functions.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand inverse functions
•
differentiate inverse trigonometric functions
•
evaluate inverse hyperbolic functions using logarithmic forms
•
differentiate inverse hyperbolic functions
38.1
Inverse functions
If y =3x −2, then by transposition, x = y +2
3
. The
function x = y +2
3
is called the inverse function of
y =3x −2 (see page 229).
Inverse trigonometricfunctions are denotedby pre-
ﬁxing the function with ‘arc’ or, more commonly, by
using the −1 notation. For example, if y = sinx, then
x =arcsin y or x =sin−1 y. Similarly, if y = cosx, then
x =arccos y or x =cos−1 y, and so on. In this chapter
the −1 notation will be used. A sketch of each of the
inverse trigonometric functions is shown in Fig. 38.1.
Inverse hyperbolic functions are denoted by pre-
ﬁxing the function with ‘ar’ or, more commonly, by

x =arsinh y or x = sinh−1 y. Similarly, if y =sechx,
then x =arsech y or x =sech−1y, and so on. In this
chapter the −1 notation will be used. A sketch of each of
the inverse hyperbolic functions is shown in Fig. 38.2.

If y = sin−1 x, then x = siny.
Differentiating both sides with respect to y gives:

A sketch of part of the curve of y = sin−1 x is
shown in Fig. 38.1(a). The principal value of
sin−1 x is deﬁned as the value lying between

From Table 38.1(i), if

conveniently
when
expressed

a
logarithmic
form.
For example, if y =sinh−1 x
a then x
a = sinhy.
From Chapter 16, e y = coshy + sinhy and
cosh2 y −sinh2 y =1, from which,
coshy =

1+ sinh2 y which is positive since coshy is
always positive (see Fig. 16.2, page 183).

Hence x +a =ae2y −xe2y =e2y(a −x)

Chapter 39
Partial differentiation
Why it is important to understand: Partial differentiation
First-order partial derivatives can be used for numerous applications, from determining the volume of
different shapes to analysing anything from water to heat ﬂow. Second-order partial derivatives are used
in many ﬁelds of engineering. One of its applications is in solving problems related to dynamics of rigid
bodies and in determination of forces and strength of materials. Partial differentiation is used to estimate
errors in calculated quantities that depend on more than one uncertain experimental measurement.
Thermodynamic energy functions (enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, Helmholtz free energy) are functions
of two or more variables. Most thermodynamic quantities (temperature, entropy, heat capacity) can be
expressed as derivatives of these functions. Many laws of nature are best expressed as relations between
the partial derivatives of one or more quantities. Partial differentiation is hence important in many
branches of engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine ﬁrst-order partial derivatives
•
determine second-order partial derivatives
39.1
Introduction to partial
derivatives
In engineering, it sometimes happens that the variation
of one quantity depends on changes taking place in
two, or more, other quantities. For example, the vol-
ume V of a cylinder is given by V = πr 2h. The
volume will change if either radius r or height h is
changed. The formula for volume may be stated math-
ematically as V = f (r,h) which means ‘V is some
function of r and h’. Some other practical examples
include:
(i)
time of oscillation, t =2π
 l
g i.e. t = f (l,g)
(ii)
torque T =Iα, i.e. T =f (I,α)
(iii)
pressure of an ideal gas p= mRT
V
i.e. p=f (T,V )
(iv)
resonant frequency fr =
1
2π
√
LC
i.e. fr = f (L,C), and so on.
When differentiating a function having two variables,
one variable is kept constant and the differential
coefﬁcient of the other variable is found with respect
to that variable. The differential coefﬁcient obtained is
called a partial derivative of the function.
39.2
First-order partial derivatives
A ‘curly dee’, ∂, is used to denote a differential
coefﬁcient in an expression containing more than one
variable.

Partial differentiation

Hence if V =πr2h then ∂V
∂r means ‘the partial deriva-
tive of V with respect to r, with h remaining constant’.
Thus,
∂V
∂r = (πh) d
dr (r2) = (πh)(2r) = 2πrh
Similarly, ∂V
∂h means ‘the partial derivative of V with
respect to h, with r remaining constant’. Thus,
∂V
∂h = (πr2) d
dh(h) = (πr2)(1) = πr2
∂V
∂r
and ∂V
∂h
are examples of ﬁrst order partial
derivatives, since n=1 when written in the form
∂nV
∂rn
First-order partial derivatives are used when ﬁnding the
total differential, rates of change and errors forfunctions
of two or more variables (see Chapter 40), when ﬁnding
maxima, minima and saddle points for functions of two
variables (see Chapter 41), and with partial differential
equations (see Chapter 56).

(a) ∂z
∂x and (b) ∂z

To ﬁnd ∂z

∂z
∂x = d
dx (5x4)+(2y2) d

(b)
To ﬁnd ∂z
∂y , x is kept constant.
Since z=(5x4)+(2x3)y2−3y
then,
∂z
∂y = (5x4) d
dy (1) + (2x3) d

Hence

Second-order partial derivatives
As with ordinary differentiation, where a differen-
tial coefﬁcient may be differentiated again, a partial
derivative may be differentiated partially again to give
higher-order partial derivatives.

, which is written as

(v)
∂2V
∂r2 , ∂2V
∂h2 , ∂2V
∂r∂h and ∂2V
∂h∂r are examples of
second-order partial derivatives.
(vi)
It is seen from (iii) and (iv) that ∂2V
∂r∂h = ∂2V
∂h∂r
and such a result is always true for continuous
functions (i.e. a graph of the function which has
no sudden jumps or breaks).
Second-order partial derivatives are used in the solution
of partial differential equations, in waveguide theory, in
such areas of thermodynamics covering entropy and the
continuity theorem, and when ﬁnding maxima, minima
and saddle points for functions of two variables (see
Chapter 41).

Chapter 40
Total differential, rates of
change and small changes
Why it is important to understand: Total differential, rates of change and small changes
This chapter looks at some applications of partial differentiation, i.e. the total differential for variables
which may all be changing at the same time, rates of change, where different quantities have different
rates of change, and small changes, where approximate errors may be calculated in situations where
small changes in the variables associated with the quantity occur.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine the total differential of a function having more than one variable
•
determine the rates of change of functions having more than one variable
•
determine an approximate error in a function having more than one variable
40.1
Total differential
In Chapter 39, partial differentiation is introduced for
the case where only one variable changes at a time,
the other variables being kept constant. In practice,
variables may all be changing at the same time.
If z= f (u,v,w,...), then the total differential, dz, is
given by the sum of the separate partial differentials
of z,
i.e. dz= ∂z
∂u du + ∂z
∂v dv + ∂z
∂w dw + ···

Problem 1.
If z=f (x, y) and z=x2y3 + 2x

The total differential is the sum of the partial differen-
tials,
i.e.
dz = ∂z
∂x dx + ∂z

(i.e. y is kept constant)

Small changes
It is often useful to ﬁnd an approximate value for
the change (or error) of a quantity caused by small
changes (or errors) in the variables associated with the
quantity. If z=f (u,v,w,...) and δu,δv,δw,... denote
small changes in u,v,w,... respectively, then the cor-
respondingapproximate change δz in z is obtained from
equation (1) by replacing the differentials by the small
changes.

Let p, V and k refer to the initial values.
Since
k = pV 1.4 then ∂k

Maxima, minima and saddle
points for functions of two
variables
Why it is important to understand: Maxima, minima and saddle points for functions of two variables
The problem of ﬁnding the maximum and minimum values of functions is encountered in mechanics,
physics, geometry, and in many other ﬁelds. Finding maxima, minima and saddle points for functions
of two variables requires the application of partial differentiation (which was explained in the previous
chapters). This is demonstrated in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand functions of two independent variables
•
explain a saddle point
•
determine the maxima, minima and saddle points for a function of two variables
•
sketch a contour map for functions of two variables
41.1 Functions of two independent
variables
If a relation between two real variables, x and y,
is such that when x is given, y is determined, then
y is said to be a function of x and is denoted by
y =f (x); x is called the independent variable and y
the dependent variable. If y =f (u,v), then y is a func-
tion of two independent variables u and v. For example,
if, say, y =f (u,v)=3u2 −2v then when u=2 and
v =1, y =3(2)2 −2(1)=10. This may be written as
f (2,1)=10. Similarly, if u=1 and v =4, f (1,4)=−5
Consider a function of two variables x and y
deﬁned by z=f (x,y)=3x2 −2y. If (x,y)=(0,0),
then f (0,0)=0 and if (x,y)=(2,1), then f (2,1)=10.
Each pair of numbers, (x,y), may be represented
by a point P in the (x,y) plane of a rectangular
Cartesian co-ordinate system as shown in Fig. 41.1.
The corresponding value of z=f (x,y) may be rep-
resented by a line PP ′ drawn parallel to the z-axis.
Thus, if, for example, z=3x 2−2y, as above, and P
is the co-ordinate (2, 3) then the length of PP ′ is
3(2)2 −2(3)=6. Fig. 41.2 shows that when a large
number of (x,y) co-ordinates are taken for a function

number of lines such as PP ′ can be constructed, and in
the limit when all points in the (x,y) plane are consid-
ered, a surface is seen to result as shown in Fig. 41.2.
Thus the function z= f (x,y) represents a surface and
not a curve.

41.2 Maxima, minima and saddle
points
Partial differentiation is used when determining station-
ary points for functions of two variables. A function
f (x,y) is said to be a maximum at a point (x,y) if the
value of the function there is greater than at all points
in the immediate vicinity, and is a minimum if less than
at all points in the immediate vicinity. Fig. 41.3 shows

variables and it is seen that the surface z=f (x,y) is
higher at (x,y)=(a,b) than at any point in the imme-
diate vicinity. Fig. 41.4 shows a minimum value of a
function of two variables and it is seen that the surface
z=f (x,y) is lower at (x,y)=(p,q) than at any point
in the immediate vicinity.

If z=f (x,y) and a maximum occurs at (a,b), the
curve lying in the two planes x =a and y =b must also
have a maximum point(a,b) as showninFig.41.5. Con-
sequently, the tangents (shown as t1 and t2) to the curves
at (a,b) must be parallel to Ox and Oy respectively.
This requires that ∂z
∂x =0 and ∂z
∂y =0 at all maximum
and minimum values, and the solutionofthese equations
gives the stationary (or critical) points of z
With functions of two variables there are three types
of stationary points possible, these being a maximum

The surface z=(x −1)2 +(y −2)2 is shown in three
dimensions in Fig. 41.7. Looking down towards the
x–y plane from above, it is possible to produce a con-
tour map. A contour is a line on a map which gives
places having the same vertical height above a datum
line (usually the mean sea-level on a geographicalmap).
A contour map for z=(x −1)2 +(y −2)2 is shown
in Fig. 41.8. The values of z are shown on the map
and these give an indication of the rise and fall to a
stationary point.

Looking down towards the x–y plane from above, an
approximate contour map can be constructed to repre-
sent the value of z. Such a map is shown in Fig. 41.9.
To produce a contour map requires a large number of
x–y co-ordinates to be chosen and the values of z at
each co-ordinate calculated. Here are a few examples of
points used to construct the contour map.
When z=0, 0=(x2 + y2)2 −8(x2 −y)2

Hence the z=0 contour passes through the co-ordinates
(2, 0.97) and (2, −0.97) shown as a c and d in Fig. 41.9.
Similarly, for the z=9 contour, when y =0,
9 = (x2 + 02)2 −8(x2 −02)
i.e.
9 = x4 −8x2
i.e.
x4−8x2−9=0
Hence (x2 −9)(x2+1)=0
from which, x =±3 or complex roots.
Thus the z=9 contourpasses through(3, 0) and (−3, 0),
shown as e and f in Fig. 41.9.
If z=9 and x =0,9 = y4 +8y2
i.e.
y4 + 8y2 −9 = 0
i.e.
(y2 + 9)(y2 −1) = 0
from which, y =±1 or complex roots.
Thus the z=9 contour also passes through (0, 1) and
(0, −1), shown as g and h in Fig. 41.9.

Thus the z=128 contour passes through (0, 2.83) and
(0, −2.83), shown as i and j in Fig. 41.9.
In a similar manner many other points may be calculated
with the resulting approximate contour map shown in
Fig. 41.9. It is seen that two ‘hollows’ occur at the min-
imum points, and a ‘cross-over’ occurs at the saddle
point S, which is typical of such contour maps.

Section I
Further integral calculus


Chapter 42
Integration using algebraic
substitutions
Why it is important to understand: Integration using algebraic substitutions
As intimated in previous chapters, most complex engineering problems cannot be solved without calculus.
Calculus has widespread applications in science, economics and engineering and can solve many problems
for which algebra alone is insufﬁcient. For example, calculus is needed to calculate the force exerted on
a particle a speciﬁc distance from an electrically charged wire, and is needed for computations involving
arc length, centre of mass, work and pressure. Sometimes the integral is not a standard one; in these
cases it may be possible to replace the variable of integration by a function of a new variable. A change
in variable can reduce an integral to a standard form, and this is demonstrated in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
appreciate when an algebraic substitution is required to determine an integral
•
integrate functions which require an algebraic substitution
•
determine deﬁnite integrals where an algebraic substitution is required
•
appreciate that it is possible to change the limits when determining a deﬁnite integral
42.1
Introduction
Functions which require integrating are not always in
the ‘standard form’ shown in Chapter 31. However, it is
often possible to change a function into a form which
can be integrated by using either:
(i)
an algebraic substitution (see Section 42.2),
(ii)
a trigonometric or hyperbolic substitution (see
Chapter 43),
(iii)
partial fractions (see Chapter 44),
(iv)
the t =tan θ/2 substitution (see Chapter 45),
(v)
integration by parts (see Chapter 46), or
(vi)
reduction formulae (see Chapter 47).
42.2
Algebraic substitutions
With algebraic substitutions, the substitution usually
made is to let u be equal to f (x) such that f (u)du
is a standard integral. It is found that integrals of the
forms,
k

[f (x)]nf ′(x)dx and k

f ′(x)
[f (x)]n dx
(where k and n are constants) can both be integrated by
substituting u for f (x).

Chapter 43
Integration using
trigonometric and
hyperbolic substitutions
Why it is important to understand: Integration using trigonometric and hyperbolic substitutions
Calculus is the most powerful branch of mathematics. It is capable of computing many quantities accu-
rately, which cannot be calculated using any other branch of mathematics. Many integrals are not
‘standard’ ones that we can determine from a list of results. Some need substitutions to rearrange them
into a standard form. There are a number of trigonometric and hyperbolic substitutions that may be
used for certain integrals to change them into a form that can be integrated. These are explained in this
chapter which provides another piece of the integral calculus jigsaw.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
integrate functions of the form sin 2x, cos 2x, tan2 x and cot2 x
•
integrate functions having powers of sines and cosines
•
integrate functions that are products of sines and cosines
•
integrate using the sin θ substitution
•
integrate using the tan θ substitution
•
integrate using the sinh θ substitution
•
integrate using the cosh θ substitution

Chapter 44
Integration using
partial fractions
Why it is important to understand: Integration using partial fractions
Sometimes expressions which at ﬁrst sight look impossible to integrate using standard techniques may
in fact be integrated by ﬁrst expressing them as simpler partial fractions and then using earlier learned
techniques. As explained in Chapter 2, the algebraic technique of resolving a complicated fraction into
partial fractions is often needed by electrical and mechanical engineers for not only determining certain
integrals in calculus, but for determining inverse Laplace transforms, and for analysing linear differential
equations like resonant circuits and feedback control systems.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
integrate functions using partial fractions with linear factors
•
integrate functions using partial fractions with repeated linear factors
•
integrate functions using partial fractions with quadratic factors
44.1
Introduction
The process of expressing a fraction in terms of simpler
fractions – called partial fractions – is discussed in
Chapter 2, with the forms of partial fractions used being
summarised in Table 2.1, page 16.
Certain functions have to be resolved into partial frac-
tions before they can be integrated as demonstrated in
the following worked problems.

Chapter 45
The t = tan θ
2 substitution
Why it is important to understand: The t = tan θ
2 substitution
Sometimes, with an integral containing sin θ and/or cos θ, it is possible, after making a substitution
t = tan θ
2, to obtain an integral which can be determined using partial fractions. This is explained in this
chapter where we continue to build the picture of integral calculus, each step building from the previous.
A simple substitution can make things so much easier.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
develop formulae for sin θ, cos θ and dθ in terms of t, where t = tan θ
2
•
integrate functions using t = tan θ
2 substitution

Introduction
Integrals of the form


a cosθ + bsinθ + c dθ, where
a, b and c are constants, may be determinedby using the
substitution t = tan θ
2 . The reason is explained below.
If angle A in the right-angled triangle ABC shown in
Fig. 45.1 is made equal to θ
2 then, since tangent=

Integration by parts
Why it is important to understand: Integration by parts
Integration by parts is a very important technique that is used often in engineering and science. It is
frequently used to change the integral of a product of functions into an ideally simpler integral. It is the
foundation for the theory of differential equations and is used with Fourier series. We have looked at
standard integrals followed by various techniques to change integrals into standard ones; integration by
parts is a particularly important technique for integrating a product of two functions.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
appreciate when integration by parts is required
•
integrate functions using integration by parts
•
evaluate deﬁnite integrals using integration by parts

Introduction
From the product rule of differentiation:
d
dx (uv) = v du
dx + u dv
dx ,
where u and v are both functions of x.
Rearranging gives: u dv
dx = d
dx (uv) −v du
dx
Integrating both sides with respect to x gives:

udv
dx dx =

d
dx (uv)dx −

v du
dx dx
i.e.

udv
dx dx=uv−

v du
dx dx
or

udv =uv −

v du
This is known as the integration by parts formula
and provides a method of integrating such prod-
ucts of simple functions as  xex dx,  t sint dt,

eθ cosθ dθ and

x lnx dx.
Given a product of two terms to integrate the initial
choice is: ‘which part to make equal to u’ and ‘which
parttomakeequaltov’.Thechoicemustbesuchthatthe
‘u part’ becomes a constant after successive differenti-
ation and the ‘dv part’ can be integrated from standard
integrals. Invariably, the following rule holds: If a prod-
uct to be integrated contains an algebraic term (such as
x, t2 or 3θ) then this term is chosen as the u part. The one
exception to this rule is when a ‘lnx’ term is involved;
in this case lnx is chosen as the ‘u part’.

= [(x)(cosx) + (sinx)(1)] −sinx + 0
using the product rule

The integral,

In general, if the algebraic term of a product is of power
n, then the integration by parts formula is applied n
times.

Reduction formulae
Why it is important to understand: Reduction formulae
When an integral contains a power of n, then it may sometimes be rewritten, using integration by parts,
in terms of a similar integral containing (n −1) or (n −2), and so on. The result is a recurrence relation,
i.e. an equation that recursively deﬁnes a sequence, once one or more initial terms are given; each further
term of the sequence is deﬁned as a function of the preceding terms. It may sound difﬁcult but it’s actually
quite straightforward and is just one more technique for integrating certain functions.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•

Introduction
When using integration by parts in Chapter 46, an
integral such as

x2ex dx requires integration by
parts twice. Similarly,

x3ex dx requires integra-
tion by parts three times. Thus, integrals such as

x5ex dx,

x6 cosx dx and

x8 sin2x dx for example,
would take a long time to determine using integra-
tion by parts. Reduction formulae provide a quicker
method for determining such integrals and the method
is demonstrated in the following sections.

let
u = xn from which,
du

exnxn−1 dx

form as the integral on the left-hand side, except that n
has been replaced by n−1
Thus, if we let,

then

xn−1ex dx =In−1
Hence

xnex dx =xnex −n

xn−1ex dx
can be written as:
In = xnex −nIn−1

Equation (1) is an example of a reduction formula since
it expresses an integral in n in terms of the same integral
in n−1
Problem 1.
Determine

x2ex dx using a
reduction formula.
Using equation (1) with n=2 gives:

x2ex dx = I2 =x2ex −2I1
and
I1 = x1ex −1I0
I0 =

x0ex dx =

ex dx =ex +c1
Hence
I2 = x2ex −2[xex −1I0]
= x2ex −2[xex −1(ex +c1)]
i.e.

x2ex dx= x2ex −2xex+2ex +2c1
= ex(x2 −2x+2)+c
(where c=2c1)
As with integration by parts, in the following examples
the constant of integration will be added at the last step
with indeﬁnite integrals.
Problem 2.
Use a reduction formula to determine

x3ex dx
From equation (1), In =xnex −nIn−1
Hence

x3ex dx =I3 =x3ex −3I2
I2 =x2ex −2I1
I1 =x1ex −1I0
and
I0 =

x0ex dx =

ex dx =ex
Thus

x3ex dx = x3ex −3[x2ex −2I1]
= x3ex −3[x2ex −2(xex −I0)]
= x3ex −3[x2ex −2(xex −ex)]
= x3ex −3x2ex +6(xex −ex)
= x3ex −3x2ex +6xex −6ex
i.e.

x3ex dx= ex(x3−3x2+6x−6)+c

Double and triple integrals
Why it is important to understand: Double and triple integrals
Double and triple integrals have engineering applications in ﬁnding areas, masses and forces of two-
dimensional regions, and in determining volumes, average values of functions, centres of mass, moments
of inertia, and surface areas. A multiple integral is a type of deﬁnite integral extended to functions of more
than one real variable. This chapter explains how to evaluate double and triple integrals and completes
the many techniques of integral calculus explained in the preceding chapters.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
evaluate a double integral
•
evaluate a triple integral
48.1
Double integrals
The procedure to determine a double integral of the
form:
 y2
y1
 x2
x1
f(x,y)dxdy is:
(i)
integrate f (x,y) with respect to x between the
limits of x = x1 and x = x2 (where y is regarded
as being a constant), and
(ii)
integrate the result in (i) with respect to y between
the limits of y = y1 and y = y2
It is seen from this procedure that to determine a double
integral we start with the innermost integral and then
work outwards.
Double integrals may be used to determine areas under
curves, second moments of area, centroids and moments
of inertia.
(Sometimes
 y2
y1
 x2
x1
f (x,y)dx dy
is
written
as:
 y2
y1
dy
 x2
x1
f (x,y)dx. All this means is that the right
hand side integral is determined ﬁrst).
Determining double integrals is demonstrated in the
following worked problems.

The procedure to determine a triple integral of the form:

 x2

f(x,y,z)dxdydz is:
(i)
integrate f (x,y,z) with respect to x between the
limits of x = x1 and x = x2 (where y and z are
regarded as being constants),
(ii)
integratethe result in (i) with respect to y between
the limits of y = y1 and y = y2, and
(iii)
integratetheresultin(ii)withrespecttoz between
the limits of z = z1 and z = z2
It is seen from this procedure that to determine a triple
integral we start with the innermost integral and then
work outwards.

Chapter 49
Numerical integration
Why it is important to understand: Numerical integration
There are two main reasons for why there is a need to do numerical integration −analytical integration
may be impossible or infeasible, or it may be necessary to integrate tabulated data rather than known
functions. As has been mentioned before, there are many applications for integration. For example,
Maxwell’s equations can be written in integral form; numerical solutions of Maxwell’s equations can be
directly used for a huge number of engineering applications. Integration is involved in practically every
physical theory in some way −vibration, distortion under weight, or one of many types of ﬂuid ﬂow −
be it heat ﬂow, air ﬂow (over a wing), or water ﬂow (over a ship’s hull, through a pipe, or perhaps even
groundwater ﬂow regarding a contaminant), and so on; all these things can be either directly solved by
integration (for simple systems), or some type of numerical integration (for complex systems). Numerical
integration is also essential for the evaluation of integrals of functions available only at discrete points;
such functions often arise in the numerical solution of differential equations or from experimental data
taken at discrete intervals. Engineers therefore often require numerical integration and this chapter
explains the procedures available.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
appreciate the need for numerical integration
•
evaluate integrals using the trapezoidal rule
•
evaluate integrals using the mid-ordinate rule
•
evaluate integrals using Simpson’s rule
•
apply numerical integration to practical situations
49.1
Introduction
Even with advanced methods of integration there are
many mathematical functions which cannot be inte-
grated by analytical methods and thus approximate
methods have then to be used. In many cases, such as
in modelling airﬂow around a car, an exact answer may
not even be strictly necessary. Approximate methods of
deﬁnite integrals may be determined by what is termed
numerical integration.
It may be shown that determining the value of a deﬁnite
integral is, in fact, ﬁnding the area between a curve,
the horizontal axis and the speciﬁed ordinates. Three
methods of ﬁnding approximate areas under curves are
the trapezoidal rule, the mid-ordinate rule and Simp-
son’s rule, and these rules are used as a basis for
numerical integration.

The ordinates are labelled y1,y2,y3,...,yn+1 as shown.
An approximation to the area under the curve may be
determined by joining the tops of the ordinates by

the more accurate will be the value of the deﬁnite inte-

Simpson’s rule
The approximation made with the trapezoidal rule is to
join the top of two successive ordinates by a straight
line, i.e. by using a linear approximation of the form
a +bx. WithSimpson’s∗rule,theapproximationmade
is to join the tops of three successive ordinates by a
parabola, i.e. by using a quadratic approximation of the
form a +bx +cx2.
Fig. 49.3 shows a parabola y =a +bx +cx 2 with ordi-
nates y1,y2 and y3 at x =−d,x =0 and x =d respec-
tively.
Thus the width of each of the two intervals is d. The
area enclosed by the parabola, the x-axis and ordinates
x = −d and x =d is given by:

∗Who was Simpson? Thomas Simpson FRS (20 August
1710–14 May 1761) was the British mathematician who
invented Simpson’s rule to approximate deﬁnite integrals. For

(3)
Since
y = a + bx + cx2,
at
x = −d,y1 = a −bd + cd2
at
x = 0, y2 = a
and at
x = d, y3 = a + bd + cd2
Hence y1 + y3 = 2a + 2cd2
and
y1 + 4y2 + y3 = 6a + 2cd2
(4)
Thus the area under the parabola between x =−d
and
x =d

may
be
expressed
as
1
3 d(y1+4y2 +y3), from equations (3) and (4), and the
result is seen to be independent of the position of the
origin.
Let a deﬁnite integral be denoted by  b
a y dx and
represented by the area under the graph of y =f (x)
betweenthelimitsx =a andx =b,asshowninFig.49.4.
The range of integration, b −a, is divided into an even
number of intervals, say 2n, each of width d.
Since an even number of intervals is speciﬁed, an odd
number of ordinates, 2n + 1, exists. Let an approxima-
tion to the curve overthe ﬁrst two intervals be a parabola
of the form y =a + bx + cx2 which passes through the
tops of the three ordinates y1,y2 and y3. Similarly, let
an approximation to the curve over the next two inter-
vals be the parabola which passes through the tops of
the ordinates y3,y4 and y5, and so on.

49.5 Accuracy of numerical
integration
For a function with an increasing gradient, the trape-
zoidal rule will tend to over-estimate and the mid-
ordinate rule will tend to under-estimate (but by half
as much). The appropriate combination of the two in
Simpson’s rule eliminates this error term, giving a rule
which will perfectly model anything up to a cubic, and
have a proportionately lower error for any function of
greater complexity.
In general, for a given number of strips, Simp-
son’s rule is considered the most accurate of the three
numerical methods.

Homogeneous ﬁrst-order
differential equations
Why it is important to understand: Homogeneous ﬁrst-order differential equations
As was previously stated, differential equations play a prominent role in engineering, physics, economics,
and other disciplines. Applications are many and varied; for example, they are involved in combined
heat conduction and convection with the design of heating and cooling chambers, in ﬂuid mechanics
analysis, in heat transfer analysis, in kinematic analysis of rigid body dynamics, with exponential decay
in radioactive material, Newton’s law of cooling and in mechanical oscillations. This chapter explains
how to solve a particular type of differential equation – the homogeneous ﬁrst-order type.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
Recognise a homogeneous differential equation
•
solve a differential equations of the form P dy
dx = Q
50.1
Introduction
Certain ﬁrst-order differential equations are not of the
‘variable-separable’ type, but can be made separable by
changing the variable.
An equation of the form P dy
dx =Q, where P and Q are
functions of both x and y of the same degree throughout,
is said to be homogeneous in y and x. For exam-
ple, f (x, y)=x2 +3xy+y2 is a homogeneousfunction
since each of the three terms are of degree 2. However,
f (x,y)= x2 −y
2x2 + y2 is not homogeneous since the term
in y in the numerator is of degree 1 and the other three
terms are of degree 2.
50.2
Procedure to solve differential
equations of the form P dy
dx =Q
(i)
Rearrange P dy
dx =Q into the form dy
dx = Q
P
(ii)
Make the substitution y =vx (where v is a func-
tion of x), from which, dy
dx =v(1)+x dv
dx , by the
product rule.
(iii)
Substitute for both y and dy
dx in the equation
dy
dx = Q
P . Simplify, by cancelling, and an equation
results in which the variables are separable.

Problem 1.
Solve the differential equation:
y −x =x dy
dx , given x =1 when y =2
Using the above procedure:
(i)
Rearranging y −x =x dy
dx gives:
dy
dx = y −x
x
which is homogeneous in x and y
(ii)
Let y =vx, then dy
dx =v +x dv
dx
(iii)
Substituting for y and dy
dx gives:
v +x dv
dx = vx −x
x
=x(v −1)
x
=v −1
(iv)
Separating the variables gives:
x dv
dx =v −1 −v =−1, i.e. dv =−1
x dx
Integrating both sides gives:

dv=

−1
x dx
Hence, v =−lnx +c
(v)
Replacing v by y
x gives: y
x =−ln x +c, which is
the general solution.
When x =1,y =2, thus:
2
1 =−ln1+c from
which, c=2
Thus, the particular solution is: y
x =−lnx +2
or y=−x(ln x−2) or y=x(2−ln x)
Problem 2.
Find the particular solution of the
equation: x dy

conditions that y =4 when x =1
Using the procedure of section 50.2:
(i)
Rearranging x dy
dx = x2 + y2
y
gives:
dy
dx = x2 + y2
xy
which is homogeneous in x and y
since each of the three terms on the right-hand
side are of the same degree (i.e. degree 2).
(ii)
Let y =vx then dy
dx =v +x dv
dx
(iii)
Substituting for y and
dy
dx
in the equation
dy
dx = x2 + y2

gives:

dx = x2 + v2x2
x(vx)
= x2 + v2x2

v
(iv)
Separating the variables gives:
x dv
dx = 1 + v2
v
−v = 1 + v2 −v2
v
= 1
v
Hence, v dv = 1
x dx
Integrating both sides gives:

v dv =
 1
x dx i.e. v2
2 = lnx +c
(v)
Replacing v by y
x gives: y2
2x2 = lnx +c, which is
the general solution.
When x =1,y =4, thus:
16
2 = ln1+c from
which, c=8
Hence, the particular solution is: y2
2x2 = lnx +8
or y2 =2x2(8+lnx)

Linear ﬁrst-order differential
equations
Why it is important to understand: Linear ﬁrst-order differential equations
As has been stated in previous chapters, differential equations have many applications in engineering
and science. For example, ﬁrst-order differential equations model phenomena of cooling, population
growth, radioactive decay, mixture of salt solutions, series circuits, survivability with AIDS, draining a
tank, economics and ﬁnance, drug distribution, pursuit problem and harvesting of renewable natural
resources. This chapter explains how to solve another speciﬁc type of equation, the linear ﬁrst-order
differential equation.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise a linear differential equation
•
solve a differential equation of the form dy
dx + Py = Q where P and Q are functions of x only
51.1
Introduction
An equation of the form dy
dx +Py =Q, where P and
Q are functions of x only is called a linear differen-
tial equation since y and its derivatives are of the ﬁrst
degree.
(i)
The solution of dy
dx +Py =Q is obtained by
multiplying throughout by what is termed an
integrating factor.
(ii)
Multiplying dy
dx +Py =Q by say R, a function
of x only, gives:
R dy
dx +RPy =RQ
(1)
(iii)
The differential coefﬁcient of a product Ry is
obtained using the product rule,
i.e.
d
dx (Ry) = R dy
dx + y dR
dx
which is the same as the left-hand side of
equation (1), when R is chosen such that
RP = dR
dx
(iv)
If
dR
dx =RP, then separating the variables
gives dR
R =P dx

Why it is important to understand: Numerical methods for ﬁrst-order differential equations
Most physical systems can be described in mathematical terms through differential equations. Speciﬁc
types of differential equation have been solved in the preceding chapters, i.e. the separable-variable type,
the homogeneous type and the linear type. However, differential equations such as those used to solve
real-life problems may not necessarily be directly solvable, i.e. do not have closed form solutions. Instead,
solutions can be approximated using numerical methods and in science and engineering, a numeric
approximation to the solution is often good enough to solve a problem. Various numerical methods are
explained in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
state the reason for solving differential equations using numerical methods
•
obtain a numerical solution to a ﬁrst-order differential equation using Euler’s method
•
obtain a numerical solution to a ﬁrst-order differential equation using the Euler–Cauchy method
•
obtain a numerical solution to a ﬁrst-order differential equation using the Runge–Kutta method
52.1
Introduction
Not all ﬁrst-order differential equations may be solved
by separating the variables (as in Chapter 33) or
by the integrating factor method (as in Chapter 51).
A number of other analytical methods of solving
differential equations exist. However the differential
equations that can be solved by such analytical meth-
ods is fairly restricted. Where a differential equation
and known boundary conditions are given, an approxi-
mate solution may be obtainedby applyinga numerical
method. There are a numberof such numericalmethods

available and the simplest of these is called Euler’s∗
method.
52.2
Euler’s method
From Chapter 8, Maclaurin’s series may be stated as:
f (x) = f (0) + x f ′(0) + x2
2! f ′′(0) + ···
Hence at some point f (h) in Fig. 52.1:
f (h) = f (0) + hf ′(0) + h2
2! f ′′(0) + ···
If the y-axis and origin are moved a units to the left,
as shown in Fig. 52.2, the equation of the same curve
relative to the new axis becomes y =f (a + x) and the
function value at P is f (a).
At point Q in Fig. 52.2:
f(a + h) = f(a) + h f ′(a) + h2
2! f ′′(a) + ···

∗Who was Euler? Leonhard Euler (15 April 1707–18
September 1783) was a pioneering Swiss mathematician and

December 1731) solved the problem of the centre of oscillation

If h is the interval between two new ordinates y0
and y1, as shown in Fig. 52.3, and if f (a)=y0 and
y1 = f (a + h), then Euler’s method states:
f (a + h) = f (a) + hf ′(a)

y1 = y0 + h( y′)0

The approximation used with Euler’s method is to take

equation (1).
Hence if y0, h and (y′)0 are known, y1, which is an
approximate value for the function at Q in Fig. 52.3,
can be calculated.
Euler’s method is demonstrated in the worked problems
following.
52.3 Worked problems on Euler’s
method
Problem 1.
Obtain a numerical solution of the
differential equation
dy

given the initial conditions that x =1 when y =4,
for the range x =1.0 to x =2.0 with intervals of 0.2
Draw the graph of the solution.
dy
dx = y′ = 3(1 + x) −y
With x0 =1 and y0 =4,( y′)0 =3(1 + 1) −4=2
By Euler’s method:
y1 = y0 + h(y′)0, from equation (2)
Hence
y1 = 4 + (0.2)(2) = 4.4, since h = 0.2
At point Q in Fig. 52.4, x1=1.2, y1 =4.4
and (y′)1 = 3(1 + x1) −y1

Thus at point R,
y1 = y0 + h(y′)0
from equation (2)

When x1 =1.4 and y1 =4.84,
( y′)1 =3(1 + 1.4) −4.84=2.36
This step-by-step Euler’s method can be continued and
it is easiest to list the results in a table, as shown
in Table 52.1. The results for lines 1 to 3 have been
produced above.

and ( y′)0 = 3(1 + 1.6) −5.312 = 2.488
For line 5, where x0=1.8:
y1 = y0 + h(y′)0
= 5.312 + (0.2)(2.488) = 5.8096
and ( y′)0 = 3(1 + 1.8) −5.8096 = 2.5904
For line 6, where x0 = 2.0:
y1 = y0 + h(y′)0
= 5.8096 + (0.2)(2.5904)
= 6.32768
(As the range is 1.0 to 2.0 there is no need to calculate
(y′)0 in line 6.) The particular solution is given by the
value of y against x.
A graph of the solution of dy
dx =3(1 + x) −y with initial
conditions x =1 and y =4 is shown in Fig. 52.6.
In practice it is probably best to plot the graph as
each calculation is made, which checks that there is a

occurred.

The Euler–Cauchy method
In Euler’s method of Section 52.2, the gradient (y ′)0 at

to obtain an approximate value of y1 at point Q. QR in
Fig. 52.9 is the resulting error in the result.
In an improved Euler method, called the Euler–
Cauchy∗method, the gradient at P(x0,y0) across half
the interval is used and then continues with a line whose
gradient approximates to the gradient of the curve at x 1,
shown in Fig. 52.10.
Let yP1 be the predicted value at point R using Euler’s
method, i.e. length RZ, where
yP1 = y0 + h(y′)0
(3)
The error shown as QT in Fig. 52.10 is now less
than the error QR used in the basic Euler method and
the calculated results will be of greater accuracy. The
corrected value, yC1 in the improved Euler method is
given by:
yC1 = y0 + 1
2h[(y′)0 + f(x1, yP1)]

The following worked problems demonstrate how
equations (3) and (4) are used in the Euler–Cauchy
method.
Problem 4.
Apply the Euler–Cauchy method to
solve the differential equation
dy
dx = y −x
in the range 0(0.1)0.5, given the initial conditions
that at x =0, y =2
dy
dx = y′ = y −x
Since the initial conditions are x0=0 and y0 =2
then
(y′)0 =2−0=2.
Interval
h=0.1,
hence
x1 = x0 + h=0 + 0.1=0.1
From equation (3),
yP1 = y0 + h(y′)0 = 2 + (0.1)(2) = 2.2
From equation (4),
yC1 = y0 + 1
2h[(y′)0 + f (x1,yP1)]
= y0 + 1
2h[(y′)0 + (yP1 −x1)],
in this case
= 2 + 1
2(0.1)[2 + (2.2 −0.1)] = 2.205
(y′)1 = yC1 −x1 = 2.205 −0.1 = 2.105
If we produce a table of values, as in Euler’s method,
we have so far determined lines 1 and 2 of Table 52.4.
The results in line 2 are now taken as x0, y0 and (y′)0
for the next interval and the process is repeated.

The Runge–Kutta∗method for solving ﬁrst-order dif-
ferential equations is widely used and provides a high
degree of accuracy. Again, as with the two previous
methods, the Runge–Kutta method is a step-by-step
process where results are tabulated for a range of
values of x. Although several intermediate calcula-
tions are needed at each stage, the method is fairly
straightforward.
The seven-step procedure for the Runge–Kutta
method, without proof, is as follows:

This completes the third row of Table 52.8. In a similar
manner y3, y4 and y5 can be calculated and the results
are as shown in Table 52.8. Such a table is best produced
by using a spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel.
This problem is the same as Problem 3, page 546 which
used Euler’s method, and Problem 4, page 549 which
used the improved Euler’s method, and a comparison of
results can be made.
The differential equation dy
dx =y −x may be solved
analytically using the integrating factor method of
Chapter 51, with the solution:
y=x+1+ex
Substituting values of x of 0, 0.1, 0.2,..., 0.5 will give
the exact values. A comparison of the results obtained
by Euler’s method, the Euler–Cauchy method and the
Runga–Kutta method, together with the exact values is

It is seen from Table 52.9 that the Runge–Kutta
method is exact, correct to 5 decimal places.

differential equation: dy
dx =3(1+x) −y in the
range 1.0(0.2)2.0, using the Runge–Kutta

when y =4.0
Using the above procedure:
1.
x0 =1.0, y0 =4.0 and since h=0.2, and the
range is from x =1.0 to x =2.0, then x1=1.2,
x2 = 1.4, x3 = 1.6, x4 = 1.8, and x5 = 2.0
Let n=0 to determine y1:

This completes the third row of Table 52.10. In a sim-

ous problem such a table is best produced by using a

The differential equation dy
dx =3(1+x) −y may be
solved analytically using the integrating factor method
of Chapter 51, with the solution:
y=3x+e1−x
Substituting values of x of 1.0, 1.2, 1.4,..., 2.0 will give
the exact values. A comparison of the results obtained
by Euler’s method, the Euler–Cauchy method and the
Runga–Kutta method, together with the exact values is

It is seen from Table 52.11 that the Runge–Kutta
method is exact, correct to 4 decimal places.
The percentage error in the Runge–Kutta method when,
say, x =1.6 is:
5.348811636 −5.348817
5.348811636

×100% = −0.0001%
From Problem 6, page 552, when x =1.6, the per-
centage error for the Euler method was 0.688%, and
for the Euler–Cauchy method −0.048%. Clearly, the
Runge–Kutta method is the most accurate of the three
methods.

equations of the form

Why it is important to understand: Second-order differential equations of the form a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = 0
Second-order differential equations have many engineering applications. These include free vibration
analysis with simple and damped mass-spring systems, resonant and non-resonant vibration analysis,
with modal analysis, time-varying mechanical forces or pressure, ﬂuid-induced vibration such as inter-
mittent wind, forced electrical and mechanical oscillations, tidal waves, acoustics, ultrasonic and random
movements of support. This chapter explains the procedure to solve second-order differential equations
of the form a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = 0
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
identify and solve the auxiliary equation of a second-order differential equation
•
solve a second-order differential equation of the form a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = 0
53.1
Introduction
An equation of the form a d2y
dx2 + b dy
dx +cy =0, where
a, b and c are constants, is called a linear second-order
differential equation with constant coefﬁcients.When
the right-hand side of the differential equation is zero,
it is referred to as a homogeneous differential equa-
tion. When the right-hand side is not equal to zero (as
in Chapter 54) it is referred to as a non-homogeneous
differential equation.
There are numerous engineering examples of second-
order differential equations. Three examples are:

dx2 thentheabove
equation may be stated as
(aD2 + bD + c)y =0. This equation is said to be in
‘D-operator’ form.
If y =Aemx then dy
dx =Amemx and d2y
dx2 =Am2emx
Substituting these values into a d2y
dx2 +bdy
dx +cy =0
gives:
a(Am2emx) + b(Amemx) + c(Aemx) = 0
i.e.
Aemx(am2 + bm + c) = 0
Thus y =Aemx is a solution of the given equation
provided that (am2 +bm+c)=0. am2+bm+c=0 is
called the auxiliary equation, and since the equation is
a quadratic, m may be obtained either by factorising or
by using the quadratic formula. Since, in the auxiliary
equation, a, b and c are real values, then the equation
may have either
(i)
two different real roots (when b2 >4ac) or
(ii)
two equal real roots (when b2 =4ac) or
(iii)
two complex roots (when b2<4ac)

Procedure to solve differential
equations of the form
ad2y
dx2 +bdy
dx +cy=0
(a)
Rewrite the differential equation
a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = 0
as
(aD2 + bD + c)y = 0
(b)
Substitute m for D and solve the auxiliary equation
am2 +bm+c=0 for m
(c)
If the roots of the auxiliary equation are:
(i)
real and different, say m=α and m=β,
then the general solution is
y = Aeαx + Beβx
(ii)
real and equal, say m=α twice, then the
general solution is
y = (Ax + B)eαx
(iii)
complex, say m=α ±jβ, then the general
solution is
y = eαx{Acosβx + Bsinβx}
(d)
Given boundary conditions, constants A and B,
may be determined and the particular solution
of the differential equation obtained.
The particular solutions obtained in the worked prob-
lems of Section 53.3 may each be veriﬁed by substi-
tuting expressions for y, dy

Since the roots are complex, the general solution

(d)
When t =0, x =2, thus 2=A
dx
dt =−10Asin10t +10B cos10t
When t =0, dx

Given the differential equation

dt2 =ω2V , where ω is a constant, show that its
solution may be expressed as:
V =7coshωt +3sinhωt
given the boundary conditions that when

dt =3ω
Using the procedure of Section 53.2:
(a)
d2V
dt2 =ω2V , i.e. d2V
dt2 −ω2V =0 in D-operator
form is (D2 −ω2)v =0, where D ≡d
dx
(b)
The auxiliary equation is m2 −ω2 =0, from
which, m2 =ω2 and m= ±ω
(c)
Since the roots are real and different, the general
solution is

(d)
When t =0, V =7 hence 7=A+B
(1)
dV
dt =Aωeωt −Bωe−ωt
When
t = 0, dV
dt =3ω,
thus
3ω = Aω−Bω,
i.e.
3 = A−B
(2)
From equations (1) and (2), A=5 and B =2
Hence the particular solution is
V =5eωt +2e−ωt
Since
sinhωt = 1
2(eωt −e−ωt)
and
coshωt = 1
2(eωt + e−ωt)
then
sinhωt + coshωt = eωt
and
coshωt −sinhωt = e−ωt from Chapter 16.
Hence the particular solution may also be
written as
V = 5(sinhωt +coshωt)

i.e. V = (5 + 2)coshωt + (5 −2)sinhωt

(b)
The auxiliary equation is m2 +6m+8=0
Factorising

(c)
Since the roots are real and different, the general

Initial displacement means that time t =0. At this

Thus 4=A+B

Second-order differential
equations of the form
ad2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = f (x)
Why it is important to understand: Second-order differential equations of the form a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy=f(x)
Second-order differential equations have many engineering applications. Differential equations govern
the fundamental operation of important areas such as automobile dynamics, tyre dynamics, aerody-
namics, acoustics, active control systems, including speed control, engine performance and emissions
control, climate control, ABS control systems, airbag deployment systems, structural dynamics of build-
ings, bridges and dams, for example, earthquake and wind engineering, industrial process control,control
and operation of automation (robotic) systems, the operation of the electric power grid, electric power
generation, orbital dynamics of satellite systems, heat transfer from electrical equipment (including com-
puter chips), economic systems, biological systems, chemical systems, and so on. This chapter explains the
procedure to solve second-order differential equations of the form a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = f(x) for different
functions f(x).
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
identify the complementary function and particular integral of a second-order differential equation
•
solve a second order differential equation of the form a d2y
dx2 + b dy
dx + cy = f (x) where f (x) is a constant
or a polynomial function, an exponential function, a sine or cosine function, or a sum or product

54.1 Complementary function and
particular integral
If in the differential equation
a d2y
dx2 + b dy
dx + cy = f (x)
(1)
the substitution y =u+v is made then:
a d2(u + v)
dx2
+ b d(u + v)
dx
+ c(u + v) = f (x)
Rearranging gives:

a d2u
dx2 + b du
dx + cu

+

a d2v
dx2 + b dv
dx +cv

= f (x)
If we let
a d2v
dx2 + b dv
dx + cv = f (x)
(2)
then
a d2u
dx2 + bdu
dx + cu = 0
(3)
The general solution, u, of equation (3) will contain two
unknown constants, as required for the general solution
of equation (1). The method of solution of equation (3)
is shown in Chapter 53. The function u is called the
complementary function (C.F.).
If the particular solution, v, of equation (2) can be deter-
mined without containing any unknown constants then
y =u+v will give the general solution of equation (1).
The function v is called the particular integral (P.I.).
Hence the general solution of equation (1) is given by:
y = C.F.+P.I.

dx +4y =3e2x in D-operator form is
(D2 −4D+4)y =3e2x
(ii)
Substituting
m

gives

(m−2)(m−2)=0, from which, m=2 twice.
(iii)
Since the roots are real and equal, the C.F.,

(iv)
Since e2x and xe2x both appear in the C.F. let the
P.I., v =kx2e2x (see Table 54.1(c),snag case (ii)).
(v)
Substituting v =kx2e2x into (D2 −4D+4)v =
3e2x gives: (D2 −4D+4)(kx2e2x)=3e2x
D(kx2e2x) = (kx2)(2e2x) + (e2x)(2kx)
= 2ke2x(x2 + x)
D2(kx2e2x) = D[2ke2x(x2 + x)]
= (2ke2x)(2x +1)+(x2 +x)(4ke2x)

Hence (D2 −4D + 4)(kx2e2x)

Substituting v =Asin2x +B cos2x into

(2D2 +3D−5)(Asin2x +B cos2x)=6sin2x
D(Asin2x +B cos2x)
=2Acos2x −2B sin2x
D2(Asin2x +B cos2x)
= D(2Acos2x −2B sin2x)
= −4Asin2x −4B cos2x
Hence (2D2 +3D−5)(Asin2x +B cos2x)
=−8Asin2x −8B cos2x +6Acos2x
−6B sin2x −5Asin2x −5B cos2x
=6 sin2x
Equating coefﬁcient of sin2x gives:

Equating coefﬁcients of cos2x gives:

Using the procedure of Section 54.2:
(i)
d2y
dx2 +16y =10cos4x in D-operator form is
(D2 + 16)y = 10cos4x
(ii)
The auxiliary equation is m2 +16=0, from
which m=√−16= ± j4
(iii)
Since the roots are complex the C.F.,
u=e0(Acos4x + B sin4x)
i.e. u=Acos4x+Bsin4x
(iv)
Since sin4x occurs in the C.F. and in the
right-hand side of the given differential equa-
tion, let the P.I., v =x(C sin4x +D cos4x) (see
Table 54.1(d), snag case – constants C and D are
used since A and B have already been used in the
C.F.).
(v)
Substituting
v =x(C sin4x +D cos4x)
into
(D2 +16)v =10cos4x gives:
(D2 + 16)[x(Csin4x + D cos4x)]
= 10cos4x
D[x(C sin4x + D cos4x)]
= x(4C cos4x −4D sin4x)
+ (C sin4x + D cos4x)(1),
by the product rule
D2[x(C sin4x + D cos4x)]
= x(−16C sin4x −16D cos4x)
+ (4C cos4x −4D sin4x)
+ (4C cos4x −4D sin4x)
Hence (D2 +16)[x(C sin4x +D cos4x)]

−4D sin4x + 4C cos4x −4D sin4x

= 10cos4x,
i.e. −8D sin4x +8C cos4x =10cos4x
Equating coefﬁcients of cos4x gives:

Power series methods
of solving ordinary
differential equations
Why it is important to understand: Power series methods of solving ordinary differential equations
The differential equations studied so far have all had closed form solutions, that is, their solutions could be
expressed in terms of elementary functions, such as exponential, trigonometric, polynomial, and logarith-
mic functions, and most such elementary functions have expansions in terms of power series. However,
there are a whole class of functions which are not elementary functions and which occur frequently in
mathematical physics and engineering. These equations can sometimes be solved by discovering a power
series that satisﬁes the differential equation, but the solution series may not be summable to an elementary
function. In this chapter the methods of solution to such equations are explained.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
appreciate the reason for using power series methods to solve differential equations
•
determine higher order differential coefﬁcients as a series
•
use Leibniz’s theorem to obtain the nth derivative of a given function
•
obtain a power series solution of a differential equation by the Leibniz−Maclaurin method
•
obtain a power series solution of a differential equation by the Frobenius method
•
determine the general power series solution of Bessel’s equation
•
express Bessel’s equation in terms of gamma functions
•
determine the general power series solution of Legendre’s equation
•
determine Legendre polynomials
•
determine Legendre polynomials using Rodrigues’ formula

Introduction
Second-order ordinary differential equations that can-
not be solved by analytical methods (as shown in
Chapters 53 and 54), i.e. those involving variable
coefﬁcients, can often be solved in the form of an inﬁ-
nite series of powers of the variable. This chapter looks
at some of the methods that make this possible – by the
Leibniz–Maclaurin and Frobinius methods, involving
Bessel’s and Legendre’s equations, Bessel and gamma

functions and Legendre’s polynomials. Beforeintroduc-
ing Leibniz’s theorem, some trends with higher differ-
ential coefﬁcients are considered. To better understand
this chapter it is necessary to be able to:
(i) differentiate standard functions (as explained in
Chapters 29 and 37),
(ii) appreciate the binomial theorem (as explained in
Chapter 7), and
(iii) use Maclaurin’s theorem (as explained in Chap-
ter 8).
55.2 Higher order differential
coefﬁcients as series
The following is an extension of successive differentia-
tion (see page 355), but looking for trends, or series,
as the differential coefﬁcient of common functions
rises.
(i)
If y=eax, then dy
dx =aeax, d2y
dx2 =a2eax, and so
on.
If we abbreviate dy
dx as y′, d2y
dx2 as y′′, … and
dny
dxn as y(n), then y′ =aeax, y′′ =a2eax, and the
emerging pattern gives:
y(n) = aneax
(1)
For example, if y=3e2x, then
d7y
dx7 =y(7)= 3(27)e2x =384e2x
(ii)
If y=sin ax,
y′ = a cos ax =a sin

ax + π


y′′ = −a2sinax =a2sin(ax +π)
= a2sin

ax + 2π
2

y′′′ = −a3cosx
= a3sin

ax + 3π
2

and so on.
In general,
y(n) =an sin

ax+ nπ

(2)
For example, if
y = sin 3x, then d5y
dx5 =y(5)
= 35 sin

3x + 5π
2

=35 sin

3x + π

= 243cos3x
(iii)
If y=cos ax,
y′ =−a sinax =a cos

ax + π
2

y′′ =−a2 cosax =a2cos

ax + 2π
2

y′′′ =a3 sinax =a3cos

ax + 3π
2

and so on.
In general,
y(n) = an cos

ax+ nπ
2

(3)
For example, if y=4cos2x,
then d6y
dx6 =y(6) =4(26)cos

2x + 6π
2

=4(26)cos(2x + 3π)
=4(26)cos(2x +π)
=−256cos2x
(iv)
If y=x a, y′ =axa−1, y′′=a(a −1)xa−2,
y′′′ =a(a −1)(a −2)xa−3,
and y(n) =a(a −1)(a −2)...(a −n + 1)xa−n
or y(n) =
a!
(a−n)! xa−n
(4)
where a is a positive integer.
For example, if y=2x6, then d4y
dx4 = y(4)
= (2)

y′′ = uv′′ + v′u′ + vu′′ + u′v′
= u′′v + 2u′v′ + uv′′
(10)
y′′′ = u′′v′ + vu′′′ + 2u′v′′ + 2v′u′′ + uv′′′ + v′′u′
= u′′′v + 3u′′v′ + 3u′v′′ + uv′′′

From equations (8) to (12) it is seen that

the nth derivativeof u decreases by 1 movingfrom

the nth derivative of v increases by 1 moving from

(c)
the coefﬁcients 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 are thenormal binomial
coefﬁcients (see page 59).
In fact, (uv)(n) may be obtainedby expanding(u+v)(n)
using the binomial theorem (see page 60), where the
‘powers’ are interpretedas derivatives.Thus, expanding
(u + v)(n) gives:
y(n) =(uv)(n) =u(n)v +nu(n−1)v(1)

Equation (13) is a statement of Leibniz’s theorem∗
,
which can be used to differentiate a product n times.
The theorem is demonstrated in the following worked
problems.
Problem 1.
Determine y(n) when y = x2e3x
For a product y = uv, the function taken as
(i)
u is the one whose nth derivative can readily be
determined (from equations (1) to (7)),
∗Who was Leibniz? For image and resume see page 91. For more
information, go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
(ii)
v is the one whose derivative reduces to zero after
a few stages of differentiation.
Thus, when y =x2e3x, v =x2, since its third derivative
is zero, and u=e3x since the nth derivative is known
from equation (1), i.e. 3neax
Using Leinbiz’s theorem (equation (13),
y(n) = u(n)v + nu(n−1)v(1) + n(n −1)
2!
u(n−2)v(2)
+ n(n −1)(n −2)
3!
u(n−3)v(3) + ···
where in this case v =x2, v(1) = 2x, v(2) = 2 and
v(3) = 0
Hence, y(n) =(3ne3x)(x2) + n(3n−1e3x)(2x)

55.4 Power series solution by the
Leibniz–Maclaurin method
For second-order differential equations that cannot be
solved by algebraic methods, the Leibniz–Maclaurin∗
method produces a solution in the form of inﬁnite
series of powers of the unknown variable. The follow-
ing simple ﬁve-step procedure may be used in the
Leibniz–Maclaurin method:
(i)
Differentiate the given equation n times, using
the Leibniz theorem of equation (13),
(ii)
rearrange the result to obtain the recurrence
relation at x = 0,
(iii)
determine the values of the derivatives at x =0,
i.e. ﬁnd (y)0 and (y′)0,
(iv)
substitute
in
the
Maclaurin
expansion for
y =f (x) (see page 70, equation (5)),
(v)
simplify the result where possible and apply
boundary condition (if given).
The Leibniz–Maclaurin method is demonstrated, using
the above procedure, in the following worked problems.
Problem 5.
Determine the power series solution
of the differential equation:
d2y
dx2 +x dy
dx + 2y =0 using the Leibniz–Maclaurin
method, given the boundary conditions that at
x =0, y =1 and dy
dx =2
Following the above procedure:
(i)
The
differential
equation
is
rewritten
as:
y′′ +xy′ +2y =0 and from the Leibniz theorem
of equation (13), each term is differentiated n
times, which gives:
y(n+2)+{y(n+1)(x)+ny(n)(1)+0}+2y(n)=0
i.e.
y(n+2) + xy(n+1) + (n + 2)y(n) =0
(14)
∗Who was Maclaurin? For image and resume of Maclaurin, see
page 69. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird
(ii)
At x = 0, equation (14) becomes:
y(n+2) + (n + 2)y(n) = 0
from which, y(n+2) =−(n+2)y(n)
This equation is called a recurrence relation
or recurrence formula, because each recurring
term depends on a previous term.
(iii)
Substituting n=0, 1, 2, 3,…will produce a set
of relationships between the various coefﬁcients.
For n=0,
(y′′)0 =−2(y)0
n=1,
(y′′′)0 =−3(y′)0
n=2, (y(4))0 =−4(y′′)0 =−4{−2(y)0}
=2 × 4(y)0
n=3, (y(5))0 =−5(y′′′)0 =−5{−3(y′)0}
=3 × 5(y′)0
n=4,(y(6))0 =−6(y(4))0 = −6{2 × 4(y)0}
=−2 × 4 × 6(y)0
n=5,(y(7))0 =−7(y(5))0 = −7{3×5(y′)0}
=−3 × 5 × 7(y′)0
n=6,(y(8))0 =−8(y(6))0 =
−8{−2 × 4 × 6(y)0}=2×4×6×8(y)0
(iv)
Maclaurin’s theorem from page 70 may be
written as:c
y = (y)0 + x(y′)0 + x2
2! (y′′)0 + x3
3! (y′′′)0
+ x4
4! (y(4))0 + ···
Substituting the above values into Maclaurin’s
theorem gives:
y = (y)0 + x(y′)0 + x2
2! {−2(y)0}
+ x3
3! {−3(y′)0} + x4
4! {2 × 4(y)0}

of the differential equation:
d2y
dx2 + dy
dx + xy=0 given the boundary conditions
that at x =0, y =0 and dy

Leibniz–Maclaurin method.
Following the above procedure:
(i)
The
differential
equation
is
rewritten
as:
y′′ + y′ +xy =0 and from the Leibniz theorem
of equation (13), each term is differentiated n
times, which gives:
y(n+2) + y(n+1) + y(n)(x) + ny(n−1)(1) + 0 = 0
i.e.
y(n+2) + y(n+1) + xy(n) + ny(n−1) = 0
(15)
(ii)
At x =0, equation (15) becomes:
y(n+2) + y(n+1) + ny(n−1) = 0
from which, y(n+2) = −{y(n+1) + ny(n−1)}
This is the recurrence relation and applies for
n≥1
(iii)
Substituting n=1,2,3,... will produce a set of
relationships between the various coefﬁcients.
For n = 1, (y′′′)0 =−{(y′′)0 + (y)0}
n = 2, (y(4))0 =−{(y′′′)0 + 2(y′)0}

n = 5, (y(7))0 =−{(y(6))0 + 5(y(4))0}
n = 6, (y(8))0 =−{(y(7))0 + 6(y(5))0}
From the given boundary conditions, at x =0,
y =0, thus (y)0 =0, and at x =0, dy
dx =1, thus
(y′)0 =1
From the given differential equation,
y′′ + y′ + xy = 0, and, at x =0,
(y′′)0 +(y′)0 +(0)y =0 from which,
(y′′)0 =−(y′)0 =−1
Thus, (y)0 =0,(y′)0 =1,(y′′)0 =−1,

Frobenius method
A differential equation of the form y ′′ +Py ′ + Qy =0,
where P and Q are both functions of x, such that the
equation can be represented by a power series, may be
solved by the Frobenius method.∗
∗Who was Frobenius? Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (26
October 1849–3 August 1917) was a German mathemati-
cian best known for his contributions to the theory of ellip-
tic functions, differential equations and to group theory.
He is also known for determinantal identities, known as
Frobenius–Stickelberger formulae. To ﬁnd out more go to
www.routledge.com/cw/bird

Section J
Power series methods of solving ordinary differential equations
585
The following four-step procedure may be used in the
Frobenius method:
(i)
Assume a trial solution of the form y =
xc 
a0 +a1x+a2x2 +a3x3 +··· +arxr +···

(ii)
differentiate the trial series,
(iii)
substitute the results in the given differential
equation,
(iv)
equate coefﬁcients of corresponding powers of
the variable on each side of the equation;
this enables index c and coefﬁcients a1, a2,
a3, … from the trial solution, to be determined.
This introductory treatment of the Frobenius method
covering the simplest cases is demonstrated, using the
above procedure, in the following worked problems.
Problem 7.
Determine, using the Frobenius
method, the general power series solution of the
differential equation: 3x d2y
dx2 + dy
dx −y =0
The
differential
equation
may
be
rewritten
as:
3xy′′+y′ −y =0
(i)
Let a trial solution be of the form
y = xc 
a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + ···
+arxr + ···

(16)
where a0 ̸=0,
i.e. y = a0xc + a1xc+1 + a2xc+2 + a3xc+3
+ ··· + arxc+r + ···
(17)
(ii)
Differentiating equation (17) gives:
y′ = a0cxc−1 + a1(c + 1)xc
+ a2(c + 2)xc+1 + ···
+ ar(c + r)xc+r−1 + ···
and
y′′ = a0c(c −1)xc−2 + a1c(c + 1)xc−1
+ a2(c + 1)(c + 2)xc + ···
+ ar(c + r −1)(c + r)xc+r−2 + ···
(iii)
Substituting y, y′ and y′′ into each term of the
given equation 3xy ′′ + y′ −y = 0 gives:
3xy′′ = 3a0c(c −1)xc−1 + 3a1c(c + 1)xc
+ 3a2(c + 1)(c + 2)xc+1 + ···
+ 3ar(c + r −1)(c+r)xc+r−1+··· (a)
y′ = a0cxc−1+a1(c + 1)xc+a2(c + 2)xc+1
+ ··· + ar(c + r)xc+r−1 + ···
(b)
−y = −a0xc −a1xc+1 −a2xc+2 −a3xc+3
−··· −arxc+r −···
(c)
(iv)
The sum of these three terms forms the left-hand
side of the equation. Since the right-hand side is
zero, the coefﬁcients of each power of x can be
equated to zero.
For example, the coefﬁcient of x c−1 is equated
to zero giving: 3a0c(c −1) + a0c = 0

(18)
The coefﬁcient of xc is equated to zero giving:
3a1c(c + 1) + a1(c + 1) −a0 = 0
i.e.
a1(3c2 + 3c + c + 1) −a0
= a1(3c2 + 4c + 1) −a0 = 0
or
a1(3c+1)(c+1)−a0=0
(19)
In each of series (a), (b) and (c) an x c term is
involved, after which, a general relationship can
be obtained for xc+r, where r ≥0
In series (a) and (b), terms in x c+r−1 are present;
replacingr by (r +1) will give the corresponding
terms in xc+r, which occurs in all three equa-
tions, i.e.
in series (a), 3ar+1(c + r)(c + r + 1)xc+r
in series (b), ar+1(c + r + 1)xc+r
in series (c), −arxc+r
Equating the total coefﬁcients of x c+r to zero
gives:
3ar+1(c + r)(c + r + 1) + ar+1(c + r + 1)

the following can be deduced, and in future assumed:
(i)
if two solutions of the indicial equation differ by
a quantity not an integer, then two independent
solutions y =u(x)+v(x) result, the general solu-
tion of which is y =Au+Bv (note: Problem 7

iftwosolutionsoftheindicialequationdodifferby
an integer, as in Problem 9 where c=0 and 1, and
if one coefﬁcient is indeterminate, as with when
c=0, then the complete solution is always given
by using this value of c. Using the second value
of c, i.e. c=1 in Problem 9, always gives a series
which is one of the series in the ﬁrst solution.

The gamma function
The solution of the Bessel equation of Problem 10 may
be expressed in terms of gamma functions.  is the
upper case Greek letter gamma, and the gamma function
(x) is deﬁned by the integral
(x) =
 ∞

tx−1e−tdt
(40)
and is convergent for x >0
From equation (40), (x + 1) =

= x(x) from equation (40)
This is an important recurrence relation for gamma
functions.
Thus, since
(x + 1) = x(x)
then similarly,
(x + 2) = (x + 1)(x + 1)
= (x + 1)x(x)
(41)
and
(x + 3) = (x + 2)(x + 2)
= (x + 2)(x + 1)x(x),
and so on.
These relationships involving gamma functions are used
with Bessel functions.

For the term in xc−1, i.e. a1c(c+1)=0, with

From page 591, it was stated that if two solutions of
the indicial equation differ by an integer, as in this case,
where c=0 and 1, and if one coefﬁcient is indetermi-
nate, as with when c=0, then the complete solution is
always given by using this value of c. Using the second
value of c, i.e. c=1 in this problem, will give a series
which is one of the series in the ﬁrst solution. (This may
be checked for c=1 and where a1 =0; the result will be
the ﬁrst part of equation (47) above.)

of
the
form:
f (x)=a +bx +cx2+dx3+ ··· .) When k in equation
(47) above is an integer, say, n, one of the solution series
terminates after a ﬁnite number of terms. For example,
if k =2, then the ﬁrst series terminates after the term in
x2. The resulting polynomial in x, denoted by Pn(x), is
called a Legendre polynomial. Constants a0 and a1 are
chosen so that y =1 when x =1. This is demonstrated
in the following worked problems.

Chapter 56
An introduction to partial
differential equations
Why it is important to understand: An introduction to partial differential equations
In engineering, physics and economics, quantities are frequently encountered −for example energy −
that depend on many variables, such as position, velocity and temperature. Usually this dependency is
expressed through a partial differential equation, and solving these equations is important for under-
standing these complex relationships. Solving ordinary differential equations involves ﬁnding a function
(or a set of functions) of one independent variable, but partial differential equations are for functions
of two or more variables. Examples of physical models using partial differential equations are the heat
equation for the evolution of the temperature distribution in a body, the wave equation for the motion of a
wave front, the ﬂow equation for the ﬂow of ﬂuids and Laplace’s equation for an electrostatic potential or
elastic strain ﬁeld. In such cases, not only are the initial conditions needed, but also boundary conditions
for the region in which the model applies; thus boundary value problems have to be solved. This chapter
provides an introduction to the often complex subject of partial differential equations.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise some important engineering partial differential equations
•
solve a partial differential equation by direct partial integration
•

Introduction
A partial differential equation is an equation that con-
tains one or more partial derivatives. Examples include:
(i)
a ∂u
∂x + b∂u
∂y = c
(ii)
∂2u
∂x2 = 1
c2
∂u
∂t
(known as the heat conduction equation)
(iii)
∂2u
∂x2 + ∂2u
∂y2 = 0
(known as Laplace’s equation)
Equation (i) is a ﬁrst-order partial differential equa-
tion, and equations (ii) and (iii) are second-order
partial differential equations since the highest power
of the differential is 2.
Partial differential equations occur in many areas of
engineering and technology; electrostatics, heat con-
duction, magnetism, wave motion, hydrodynamics and
aerodynamics all use models that involve partial differ-
ential equations. Such equations are difﬁcult to solve,
but techniques have been developed for the simpler
types. In fact, for all but the simplest cases, there are
a number of numerical methods of solutions of partial
differential equations available.
To be able to solve simple partial differential equa-
tions knowledge of the following is required:
(a)
partial integration,
(b)
ﬁrst-and second-order partial differentiation – as
explained in Chapter 39, and
(c)
the solution of ordinary differential equations – as
explained in Chapters 33 and 50–54.
It should be appreciated that whole books have been
written on partial differential equations and their solu-
tions. This chapter does no more than introduce the
topic.

Partial integration
Integration is the reverse process of differentiation.

and u =

Similarly, if

with respect to y,
then

and integrating ∂u
∂x partially with respect to x gives:
u =

[3x2 sin2y + f (x)]dx
= x3 sin2y + (x)f(x) + g(y)
f (x) and g(y) are functions that may be determined
if extra information, called boundary conditions or
initial conditions, are known.
56.3
Solution of partial differential
equations by direct partial
integration
The simplest form of partial differential equations
occurs when a solution can be determined by direct par-
tial integration. This is demonstrated in the following
worked problems.
Problem 1.
Solve the differential equation
∂2u
∂x2 =6x2(2y −1) given the boundary conditions
that at x =0, ∂u
∂x =sin2y and u=cosy
Since ∂2u
∂x2 =6x2(2y −1) then integrating partially with
respect to x gives:
∂u
∂x =

6x2(2y −1)dx = (2y −1)

6x2dx
= (2y −1) 6x3
3 + f (y)
= 2x3(2y −1) + f (y)
where f (y) is an arbitrary function.

Section J
An introduction to partial differential equations
603
From the boundary conditions, when x =0,
∂u
∂x = sin2y
Hence,
sin2y =2(0)3(2y −1) + f (y)
from which,
f (y)= sin2y
Now
∂u
∂x =2x3(2y −1) + sin2y
Integrating partially with respect to x gives:
u =

[2x3(2y −1) + sin2y]dx
= 2x4
4 (2y −1) + x(sin2y) + F(y)
From the boundary conditions, when x =0,
u=cosy, hence
cosy = (0)4
2
(2y −1) + (0)sin2y + F(y)
from which, F(y)=cosy
Hence, the solution of ∂2u
∂x2 =6x2(2y −1) for the given
boundary conditions is:
u = x4
2 (2y −1) + xsiny + cosy
Problem 2.
Solve the differential equation:
∂2u
∂x∂y =cos(x + y) given that ∂u
∂x =2 when y =0,
and u=y2 when x =0
Since ∂2u
∂x∂y =cos(x + y) then integratingpartially with
respect to y gives:
∂u
∂x =

cos(x + y)dy = sin(x + y) + f (x)
From the boundary conditions, ∂u
∂x =2 when y =0,
hence
2=sinx +f (x)
from which, f (x)=2 −sinx
i.e.
∂u
∂x = sin(x + y) + 2−sinx
Integrating partially with respect to x gives:
u =

[sin(x + y) + 2−sinx]dx
= −cos(x + y) + 2x + cosx + f (y)
Fromtheboundaryconditions,u=y 2 whenx =0,hence
y2 = −cosy + 0 + cos0 + f (y)
= 1 −cosy + f (y)
from which, f (y) = y2 −1 + cosy
Hence, the solution of ∂2u
∂x∂y = cos(x + y) is given by:
u = −cos(x + y) + 2x +cosx + y2 −1 + cosy

tions. Some typically found in engineering and science
include:

The wave equation, where the equation of motion
is given by:
∂2u
∂x2 = 1
c2
∂2u
∂t2
where c2 = T
ρ , with T being the tension in a string
and ρ being the mass/unit length of the string.

(b)
The heat conduction equation is of the form:
∂2u
∂x2 = 1
c2
∂u
∂t
where c2= h
σρ , with h being the thermal conduc-
tivity of the material, σ the speciﬁc heat of the
material, and ρ the mass/unit length of material.
(c)
Laplace’s∗equation, used extensively with elec-
trostatic ﬁelds is of the form:
∂2u
∂x2 + ∂2u
∂y2 + ∂2u
∂z2 = 0
(d)
The transmission equation, where the poten-
tial u in a transmission cable is of the form:
∂2u
∂x2 =A∂2u
∂t2 +B ∂u
∂t +Cu where A, B and C are
constants.
Some of these equations are used in the next sections.
∗Who was Laplace? Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace
(23 March 1749–5 March 1827) was a French mathemati-
cian and astronomer who formulated Laplace’s equation, and
pioneered the Laplace transform which appears in many
branches of mathematical physics. To ﬁnd out more go to

Separating the variables
Let u(x,t)=X(x)T (t), where X(x) is a function of x
only and T (t) is a functionof t only,be a trial solution to
the wave equation ∂2u
∂x2 = 1
c2
∂2u
∂t2 . If the trial solution is
simpliﬁed to u=XT, then ∂u
∂x =X′T and ∂2u
∂x2 =X′′T .
Also ∂u
∂t =XT ′ and ∂2u
∂t2 =XT ′′
Substituting into the partial differential equation
∂2u
∂x2 = 1
c2
∂2u
∂t2 gives:
X′′T = 1
c2 XT ′′
Separating the variables gives:
X′′
X = 1
c2
T′′
T
Let μ= X′′
X = 1
c2
T ′′
T where μ is a constant.
Thus, since μ= X′′
X (a function of x only), it must be
independent of t; and, since μ= 1
c2
T ′′
T (a function of t
only), it must be independent of x.
If μ is independent of x and t, it can only be a con-
stant. If μ= X′′
X then X′′ =μX or X′′ −μX=0 and if
μ= 1
c2
T ′′
T then T ′′ =c2μT or T ′′ −c2μT =0
Such ordinary differential equations are of the form
found in Chapter 53, and their solutions will depend
on whether μ>0, μ=0 or μ<0
Problem 4 will be a reminder of solving ordinary
differential equations of this type.
Problem 4.
Find the general solution of the
following differential equations:
(a) X′′ −4X=0
(b) T ′′ +4T =0
(a)
If X′′ −4X=0 then the auxiliary equation (see
Chapter 53) is:
m2 −4=0 i.e. m2 =4 from which,
m=+2 or m=−2
Thus, the general solution is:
X =Ae2x +Be−2x

(b)
If T ′′ +4T =0 then the auxiliary equation is:
m2 +4=0 i.e. m2 =−4 from which,

The wave equation
An elastic string is a string with elastic properties,
i.e. the string satisﬁes Hooke’s law. Fig. 56.1 shows a
ﬂexible elastic string stretched between two points at
x =0 and x =L with uniform tension T . The string will
vibrate if the string is displaced slightly from its initial
position of rest and released, the end points remaining
ﬁxed. The position of any point P on the string depends
on its distance from one end, and on the instant in time.
Its displacement u at any time t can be expressed as
u=f (x,t), where x is its distance from 0
The equation of motion is as stated in Section 56.4 (a),
i.e. ∂2u
∂x2 = 1

The boundary and initial conditions are:

Figure 56.1
(i)
The string is ﬁxed at both ends, i.e. x =0 and
x =L for all values of time t.
Hence, u(x,t) becomes:
u(0,t) = 0
u(L,t) = 0

for all values of t ≥0
(ii)
If the initial deﬂection of P at t = 0 is denoted by
f (x) then u(x,0)=f (x)
(iii)
Let the initial velocity of P be g(x), then
∂u
∂t
	
t=0
= g(x)
Initially a trial solution of the form u(x,t)=X(x)T (t)
is assumed, where X(x) is a function of x only and T (t)
is a function of t only. The trial solution may be simpli-
ﬁed to u=XT and the variables separated as explained
in the previous section to give:
X′′
X = 1
c2
T ′′
T
When both sides are equated to a constant μ this results
in two ordinary differential equations:
T ′′ −c2μT =0 and X′′ −μX=0
Three cases are possible, depending on the value
of μ.
Case 1: μ>0
For convenience, let μ=p2, where p is a real constant.
Then the equations
X′′ −p2X = 0 and T ′′ −c2p2T = 0
have solutions: X=Aepx +Be−px and
T =Cecpt +De−cpt where A, B, C and D are constants.
But X=0 at x =0, hence 0=A+B i.e. B = −A and
X=0 at x =L, hence
0=AepL +Be−pL = A(epL −e−pL)
Assuming (epL – e−pL) is not zero, then A=0 and since
B =−A, then B =0 also.
This corresponds to the string being stationary; since it
is non-oscillatory, this solution will be disregarded.
Case 2: μ=0
In this case, since μ=p2 =0, T ′′ =0 and X′′ =0. We
will assume that T (t)̸=0. Since X′′ =0, X′ =a and
X=ax +b where a and b are constants. But X=0 at
x =0, hence b=0 and X=ax and X=0 at x =L, hence
a =0. Thus, again, the solution is non-oscillatory and is
also disregarded.

Section J
An introduction to partial differential equations
607
Case 3: μ<0
For convenience,
let μ=−p2 then X′′ + p2X=0 from which,
X = Acospx + B sinpx
(1)
and T ′′ + c2p2T = 0
from which,
T = C coscpt + D sincpt
(2)
(see Problem 4 above).
Thus, the suggested solution u=XT now becomes:
u = {Acospx + B sinpx}{C coscpt + D sincpt}
(3)
Applying the boundary conditions:
(i)
u=0 when x =0 for all values of t,
thus 0 = {Acos0 + B sin0}{C coscpt
+D sincpt}
i.e.
0 = A{C coscpt + D sincpt}
from which, A = 0 (since {C coscpt
+ D sincpt} ̸= 0)
Hence,
u = {B sinpx}{C coscpt
+ D sincpt}
(4)
(ii)
u=0 when x =L for all values of t
Hence, 0 = {B sinpL}{C coscpt + D sincpt}
Now B ̸=0 or u(x,t) would be identically zero.
Thus sinpL=0 i.e. pL=nπ or p= nπ
L for inte-
ger values of n.
Substituting in equation (4) gives:

Assume a solution of the form u=XT and express

The heat conduction equation
The heat conduction equation ∂2u
∂x2 = 1
c2
∂u
∂t is solved
in a similar manner to that for the wave equation; the
equation differs only in that the right-hand side contains
a ﬁrst partial derivative instead of the second.
The conduction of heat in a uniform bar depends on
the initial distribution of temperature and on the phys-
ical properties of the bar, i.e. the thermal conductivity,
h, the speciﬁc heat of the material, σ, and the mass
per unit length, ρ, of the bar. In the above equation,
c2 = h
σρ
With a uniformbar insulated, except at its ends, any heat
ﬂow is along the bar and, at any instant, the temperature
u at a point P is a function of its distance x from one
end, and of the time t. Consider such a bar, shown in
Fig. 56.4, where the bar extends from x =0 to x =L, the
temperature of the ends of the bar is maintained at zero,
and the initial temperature distribution along the bar is
deﬁned by f (x).
Thus, the boundary conditions can be expressed as:
u(0,t) = 0
u(L,t) = 0

As with the wave equation, a solution of the form

The left-hand integral is obtained by an algebraic

If lnT =−p2c2t + c1 then
T =e−p2c2t+c1 =e−p2c2tec1 i.e. T =ke−p2c2t (where
constant k =ec1).
Hence, u(x,t)=XT ={Acospx + B sinpx}k e−p2c2t
i.e. u(x,t)={P cospx +Qsinpx}e−p2c2t where
P =Ak and Q=Bk
Applying the boundary conditions u(0,t)=0 gives:
0={P cos0+Qsin0}e−p2c2t =P e−p2c2t from which,
P =0 and u(x,t)=Qsinpx e−p2c2t

Laplace’s equation
The distribution of electrical potential, or temperature,
over a plane area subject to certain boundaryconditions,
can be described by Laplace’s∗equation. The potential
at a point P in a plane (see Fig. 56.6) can be indicated
by an ordinate axis and is a function of its position, i.e.
z=u(x,y), where u(x,y) is the solution of the Laplace
two-dimensional equation ∂2u
∂x2 + ∂2u
∂y2 = 0
The method of solution of Laplace’s equation is similar
to the previous examples, as shown below.
Fig. 56.7 shows a rectangle OPQR bounded by the lines
x =0,y =0,x =a, and y =b, for which we are required
to ﬁnd a solution of the equation ∂2u
∂x2 + ∂2u
∂y2 =0. The
solution z=(x,y) will give, say, the potential at any
point within the rectangle OPQR. The boundary condi-
tions are:

As with previous partial differential equations, a solu-
tion of the form u(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) is assumed, where
X is a function of x only, and Y is a function of
y only. Simplifying to u=XY, determining partial
derivatives, and substituting into ∂2u
∂x2 + ∂2u
∂y2 =0 gives:
X′′Y +XY ′′ =0
Separating the variables gives: X′′
X = −Y ′′
Y
Letting each side equal a constant, −p2, gives the two
equations:
X′′ + p2X = 0 and Y ′′ −p2Y = 0
from which, X=Acospx +B sinpx and
Y =C epy +D e−py or Y =C coshpy +D sinhpy (see
Problem 5, page 564 for this conversion).
This latter form can also be expressed as:
Y = E sinhp(y +φ) by using compound angles.
Hence u(x,y) = XY

Initially a solution of the form u(x,y)=X(x)Y(y) is

Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, including natural and social sciences,
engineering, government, and business. Statistical methods can be used for summarising or describing a
collection of data. Engineering statistics combines engineering and statistics. Design of experiments is a
methodologyfor formulating scientiﬁc and engineering problems using statistical models. Quality control
and process control use statistics as a tool to manage conformance to speciﬁcations of manufacturing
processes and their products. Time and methods engineering use statistics to study repetitive operations
in manufacturing in order to set standards and ﬁnd optimum manufacturing procedures. Reliability
engineering measures the ability of a system to perform for its intended function (and time) and has tools
for improving performance. Probabilistic design involves the use of probability in product and system
design. System identiﬁcation uses statistical methods to build mathematical models of dynamical systems
from measured data. System identiﬁcation also includes the optimal design of experiments for efﬁciently
generating informative data for ﬁtting such models. This chapter introduces the presentation of statistical
data.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
distinguish between discrete and continuous data
•
present data diagrammatically – pictograms, horizontal and vertical bar charts, percentage component bar
charts, pie diagrams
•
produce a tally diagram for a set of data
•
form a frequency distribution from a tally diagram
•
construct a histogram from a frequency distribution
•
construct a frequency polygon from a frequency distribution
•
produce a cumulative frequency distribution from a set of grouped data
•
construct an ogive from a cumulative frequency distribution

Some statistical terminology
Data are obtained largely by two methods:
(a)
by counting – for example, the number of stamps
sold by a post ofﬁce in equal periods of time, and
(b)
by measurement – for example, the heights of a
group of people.
When data are obtained by counting and only whole
numbers are possible, the data are called discrete. Mea-
sured data can have any value within certain limits and
are called continuous (see Problem 1).
A set is a group of data and an individual value within
the set is called a member of the set. Thus, if the masses
of ﬁve people are measured correct to the nearest 0.1kg
and are foundto be 53.1kg,59.4kg,62.1kg,77.8kgand
64.4kg, then the set of masses in kilograms for these ﬁve
people is:
{53.1,59.4,62.1,77.8,64.4}
and one of the members of the set is 59.4
A set containingall the members is called a population.
Some members selected at random from a population
are called a sample. Thus all car registration numbers
form a population, but the registration numbers of, say,
20 cars taken at random throughout the country are a
sample drawn from that population.
The number of times that the value of a member occurs
in a set is called the frequency of that member. Thus in
theset{2,3,4,5,4,2,4,7,9},member4hasafrequency
of three, member 2 has a frequency of two and the other
members have a frequency of one.
The relative frequency with which any member of a
set occurs is given by the ratio:
frequency of member
total frequency of all members
For the set: {2,3,5,4,7,5,6,2,8}, the relative fre-
quency of member 5 is 2
9
Often, relative
frequency is expressed as a percent-
age and the percentage relative frequency is: (relative
frequency×100)%
Problem 1.
Data are obtained on the topics given
below. State whether they are discrete or continuous
data.
(a)
The number of days on which rain falls in a
month for each month of the year.
(b)
The mileage travelled by each of a number of
salesmen.
(c)
The time that each of a batch of similar
batteries lasts.
(d)
The amount of money spent by each of
several families on food.
(a)
The number of days on which rain falls in a given
month must be an integer value and is obtained by
counting the number of days. Hence, these data
are discrete.
(b)
A salesman can travel any number of miles
(and parts of a mile) between certain limits and
these data are measured. Hence the data are
continuous.
(c)
The time that a battery lasts is measured and can
have any value between certain limits. Hence these
data are continuous.
(d)
The amount of money spent on food can only be
expressed correct to the nearest pence, the amount
being counted. Hence, these data are discrete.

Presentation of ungrouped data
Ungrouped data can be presented diagrammatically in
several ways and these include:
(a)
pictograms, in which pictorial symbols are used
to represent quantities (see Problem 2),
(b)
horizontal bar charts, having data represented
by equally spaced horizontal rectangles (see Prob-
lem 3), and
(c)
vertical bar charts, in which data are repre-
sented by equally spaced vertical rectangles (see
Problem 4).
Trends in ungrouped data over equal periods of time
can be presented diagrammatically by a percentage
component bar chart. In such a chart, equally spaced
rectangles of any width, but whose height corresponds
to 100%, are constructed. The rectangles are then sub-
divided into values corresponding to the percentage
relative frequencies of the members (see Problem 5).
A pie diagram is used to show diagrammatically the
parts making up the whole. In a pie diagram, the area of
a circle represents the whole, and the areas of the sectors
of the circle are made proportional to the parts which
make up the whole (see Problem 6).

and so on. The vertical bar chart depicting these data is
shown in Fig. 57.3.

A table of percentage relative frequency values, correct
to the nearest 1%, is the ﬁrst requirement. Since,
percentage relative frequency
= frequency of member× 100

then for four-roomed bungalows in year 1:
percentage relative frequency
=
24 × 100
24 + 38 + 44+ 64+ 30 = 12%
The percentage relative frequencies of the other types
of dwellings for each of the three years are similarly
calculated and the results are as shown in the table
below.

The percentage component bar chart is produced by
constructing three equally spaced rectangles of any
width, corresponding to the three years. The heights of
the rectangles correspond to 100% relative frequency,
and are subdivided into the values in the table of per-
centages shown above. A key is used (different types
of shading or different colour schemes) to indicate
correspondingpercentage values in the rows of the table
of percentages. The percentage component bar chart is
shown in Fig. 57.4.

Problem 6.
The retail price of a product costing
£2 is made up as follows: materials 10p, labour
20p, research and development 40p, overheads
70p, proﬁt 60p. Present these data on a pie diagram.
A circle of any radius is drawn, and the area of the circle
represents the whole, which in this case is £2. The circle
is subdivided into sectors so that the areas of the sectors
are proportional to the parts, i.e. the parts which make
up the total retail price. For the area of a sector to be

623
proportionalto a part, the angle at the centre of the circle
must be proportional to that part. The whole, £2or200p,
corresponds to 360◦. Therefore,
10p corresponds to 360 × 10
200 degrees, i.e. 18◦
20p corresponds to 360 × 20
200 degrees, i.e. 36◦
and so on, giving the angles at the centre of the circle
for the parts of the retail price as: 18◦, 36◦, 72◦, 126◦
and 108◦, respectively.

(c)
Determine the proﬁt made by selling 700
units of the product shown in Fig. 57.5.
(a)
By measuring the length of rectangle P the
mileage covered by salesman P is equivalent to
413miles. Hence salesman P receivesa travelling
allowance of
£413 × 37

, i.e. £152.81
Similarly, for salesman Q, the miles travelled are
264 and his allowance is
£264× 37

, i.e. £97.68
Salesman R travels 597 miles and he receives
£597 × 37

, i.e. £220.89
Finally, salesman S receives
£143 × 37
100
, i.e. £52.91
(b)
An analysis of Fig. 57.4 shows that ﬁve-roomed
bungalows and ﬁve-roomed houses are becom-
ing more popular, the greatest change in the
three years being a 15% increase in the sales of
ﬁve-roomed bungalows.

Since 1.8◦corresponds to 1p and the proﬁt occu-

Presentation of grouped data
When the number of members in a set is small, say
ten or fewer, the data can be represented diagrammati-
cally without further analysis, by means of pictograms,
bar charts, percentage components bar charts or pie
diagrams (as shown in Section 57.2).
For sets having more than ten members, those members
having similar values are grouped together in classes
to form a frequency distribution. To assist in accu-
rately counting members in the various classes, a tally
diagram is used (see Problems 8 and 12).
A frequency distribution is merely a table showing
classes and their corresponding frequencies (see Prob-
lems 8 and 12).
The new set of values obtained by forming a frequency
distribution is called grouped data.
The terms used in connection with grouped data are
shown in Fig. 57.6(a). The size or range of a class
is given by the upper class boundary value minus
the lower class boundary value, and in Fig. 57.6 is
7.65−7.35, i.e. 0.30. The class interval for the class
showninFig.57.6(b)is7.4to7.6andtheclassmid-point

One of the principal ways of presenting grouped
data diagrammatically is by using a histogram, in
which the areas of vertical, adjacent rectangles are
made proportional to frequencies of the classes (see
Problem 9). When class intervals are equal, the heights
of the rectangles of a histogram are equal to the fre-
quencies of the classes. For histograms having unequal
class intervals, the area must be proportional to the fre-
quency. Hence, if the class interval of class A is twice
the class interval of class B, then for equal frequencies,
the height of the rectangle representing A is half that
of B (see Problem 11). Another method of presenting
grouped data diagrammatically is by using a frequency
polygon, which is the graph produced by plotting fre-
quency against class mid-point values and joining the
co-ordinates with straight lines (see Problem 12).
A cumulative frequency distribution is a table show-
ing the cumulative frequency for each value of upper
class boundary.The cumulative frequency for a particu-
lar value of upper class boundary is obtained by adding
the frequency of the class to the sum of the previous fre-
quencies. A cumulative frequencydistributionis formed
in Problem 13.
The curve obtained by joining the co-ordinates
of cumulative frequency (vertically) against upper
class boundary (horizontally) is called an ogive or
a cumulative frequency distribution curve (see
Problem 13).
Problem 8.
The data given below refer to the gain
of each of a batch of 40 transistors, expressed
correct to the nearest whole number. Form a
frequency distribution for these data having seven
classes.
81 83 87 74 76 89 82 84
86 76 77 71 86 85 87 88

81 79 78 80 85 77 84 78
83 79 80 83 82 79 80 77
The range of the data is the value obtained by taking
the value of the smallest member from that of the
largest member. Inspection of the set of data shows that,
range=89−71=18. The size of each class is given
approximatelybyrangedividedbythenumberofclasses.
Since seven classes are required, the size of each class
is 18/7, that is, approximately 3. To achieve seven equal
classesspanningarangeofvaluesfrom71to89,theclass
intervals are selected as: 70–72, 73–75, and so on.
Toassistwithaccuratelydeterminingthenumberineach
class, a tally diagram is produced, as shown in
Table 57.1(a). This is obtained by listing the classes
in the left-hand column, and then inspecting each of the
40 members of the set in turn and allocating them to
the appropriate classes by putting ‘1s’ in the appropri-
ate rows. Every ﬁfth ‘1’ allocated to the particular row
is shown as an oblique line crossing the four previous
‘1s’, to help with ﬁnal counting.
A frequency distribution for the data is shown in
Table 57.1(b) and lists classes and their correspond-
ing frequencies, obtained from the tally diagram. (Class
mid-point values are also shown in the table, since they
are used for constructing the histogram for these data
(see Problem 9)).
Problem 9.
Construct a histogram for the data
given in Table 57.1(b).
The histogram is shown in Fig. 57.7. The width of
the rectangles correspond to the upper class boundary

cies. The easiest way to draw a histogram is to mark the

Inspection of the set given shows that the majority of
the members of the set lie between £80 and £110 and
that there are a much smaller number of extreme val-
ues ranging from £30 to £170. If equal class intervals
are selected, the frequency distribution obtained does
not give as much information as one with unequal class
intervals. Since the majority of members are between
£80 and £100, the class intervals in this range are
selected to be smaller than those outside of this range.
There is no unique solution and one possible solution is
shown in Table 57.2.

The masses of 50 ingots in
kilograms are measured correct to the nearest 0.1kg
and the results are as shown below. Produce a
frequency distribution having about seven classes
for these data and then present the grouped data as
(a) a frequency polygon and (b) a histogram.

7.4 8.2 8.4 7.7 8.3 8.2 7.9 8.5 7.9 8.0
The range of the data is the member having the largest
value minus the member having the smallest value.
Inspection of the set of data shows that:
range = 9.1 −7.1 = 2.0
The size of each class is given approximately by
range
number of classes
Since about seven classes are required, the size of each
class is 2.0/7, that is approximately 0.3, and thus the
class limits are selected as 7.1 to 7.3, 7.4 to 7.6, 7.7 to
7.9, and so on.
The class mid-point for the 7.1 to 7.3 class is
7.35+7.05
2
, i.e. 7.2, for the 7.4 to 7.6 class is
7.65+7.35
2
, i.e. 7.5, and so on.
To assist with accurately determining the number in
each class, a tally diagram is produced as shown
in Table 57.4. This is obtained by listing the classes
in the left-hand column and then inspecting each of the
50 members of the set of data in turn and allocating it

Chapter 58
Mean, median, mode and
standard deviation
Why it is important to understand: Mean, median, mode and standard deviation
Statistics is a ﬁeld of mathematics that pertains to data analysis. In many real-life situations, it is help-
ful to describe data by a single number that is most representative of the entire collection of numbers.
Such a number is called a measure of central tendency; the most commonly used measures are mean,
median, mode and standard deviation, the latter being the average distance between the actual data and
the mean. Statistics is important in the ﬁeld of engineering since it provides tools to analyse collected
data. For example, a chemical engineer may wish to analyse temperature measurements from a mix-
ing tank. Statistical methods can be used to determine how reliable and reproducible the temperature
measurements are, how much the temperature varies within the data set, what future temperatures of
the tank may be, and how conﬁdent the engineer can be in the temperature measurements made. When
performing statistical analysis on a set of data, the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation are all
helpful values to calculate; this chapter explains how to determine these measures of central tendency.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
determine the mean, median and mode for a set of ungrouped data
•
determine the mean, median and mode for a set of grouped data
•
draw a histogram from a set of grouped data
•
determine the mean, median and mode from a histogram
•
calculate the standard deviation from a set of ungrouped data
•
calculate the standard deviation from a set of grouped data
•
determine the quartile values from an ogive
•
determine quartile, decile and percentile values from a set of data
58.1
Measures of central tendency
A single value, which is representative of a set of
values, may be used to give an indication of the
general size of the members in a set, the word
‘average’ often being used to indicate the single
value.
The statistical term used for ‘average’ is the arithmetic
mean or just the mean. Other measures of central ten-
dency may be used and these include the median and
the modal values.

58.2 Mean, median and mode for
discrete data
Mean
The arithmetic mean value is foundby addingtogether
the values of the members of a set and dividing by the
number of members in the set. Thus, the mean of the set
of numbers: {4,5,6,9} is:
4 + 5 + 6 + 9
4
, i.e. 6
In general, the mean of the set: {x1,x2,x3,...,xn} is
x = x1 + x2 + x3 + ··· + xn
n
, written as
x
n
where  is the Greek letter ‘sigma’ and means ‘the sum
of’, and x (called x-bar) is used to signify a mean value.
Median
The median value often gives a better indication
of the general size of a set containing extreme val-
ues. The set: {7,5,74,10} has a mean value of 24,
which is not really representative of any of the val-
ues of the members of the set. The median value is
obtained by:
(a)
ranking the set in ascending order of magni-
tude, and
(b)
selecting the value of the middle member for sets
containing an odd number of members, or ﬁnding
the value of the mean of the two middle members
for sets containing an even number of members.
For example, the set: {7,5,74,10} is ranked as
{5,7,10,74}, and since it contains an even number of
members (four in this case), the mean of 7 and 10 is
taken, giving a median value of 8.5. Similarly, the set:
{3,81,15,7,14} is ranked as {3,7,14,15,81} and the
median value is the value of the middle member, i.e. 14
Mode
The modal value, or mode, is the most commonly
occurring value in a set. If two values occur with
the same frequency, the set is ‘bi-modal’. The set:
{5,6,8,2,5,4,6,5,3} has a model value of 5, since the
member having a value of 5 occurs three times.
Problem 1.
Determine the mean, median and
mode for the set:
{2,3,7,5,5,13,1,7,4,8,3,4,3}
The mean value is obtained by adding together the
values of the members of the set and dividing by the
number of members in the set.
Thus, mean value,
x =
2 + 3 + 7 + 5 + 5 + 13 + 1
+7 + 4 + 8 + 3 + 4+ 3
13
= 65
13 = 5
To obtain the median value the set is ranked, that is,
placed in ascending order of magnitude, and since the
set contains an odd number of members the value of the
middle member is the median value. Ranking the set
gives:
{1,2,3,3,3,4,4,5,5,7,7,8,13}
The middle term is the seventh member, i.e. 4, thus the
median value is 4. The modal value is the value of
the most commonly occurring member and is 3, which
occurs three times, all other members only occurring
once or twice.
Problem 2.
The following set of data refers to the
amount of money in pounds taken by a news vendor
for sixdays. Determine the mean, median and
modal values of the set:
{27.90,34.70,54.40,18.92,47.60,39.68}
Mean value =
27.90+ 34.70+ 54.40
+18.92+47.60+39.68
6
= £37.20
The ranked set is:
{18.92,27.90,34.70,39.68,47.60,54.40}
Since the set has an even number of members, the mean
of the middle two members is taken to give the median
value, i.e.
Median value = 34.70+ 39.68
2
= £37.19
Since no two members have the same value, this set has
no mode.

58.3 Mean, median and mode for
grouped data
The mean value for a set of grouped data is found by
determiningthesumofthe(frequency× classmid-point
values) and dividing by the sum of the frequencies,
i.e. mean value x = f1x1 + f2x2 + ··· + fnxn
f1 + f2 + ··· + fn
=
(f x)
 f
where f is the frequencyof the class having a mid-point
value of x, and so on.

value of resistance in ohms of 48 resistors is as
shown. Determine the mean value of resistance.

20.7 3, 21.2 10, 21.7 11, 22.2 13,
22.7 9 and 23.2 2
For grouped data, the mean value is given by:
x =
(f x)
 f
where f is the class frequency and x is the class mid-
point value. Hence mean value,
x =
(3 × 20.7) + (10× 21.2) + (11 × 21.7)
+(13 × 22.2) + (9 × 22.7) + (2× 23.2)
48
= 1052.1
48
= 21.919
i.e. the mean value is 21.9ohms,correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures.
Histogram
The mean, median and modal values for grouped data
may be determined from a histogram. In a histogram,
frequency values are represented vertically and vari-
able values horizontally. The mean value is given by
the value of the variable corresponding to a vertical
line drawn through the centroid of the histogram. The
median value is obtained by selecting a variable value
such that the area of the histogramto the left of a vertical
line drawn through the selected variable value is equal
to the area of the histogram on the right of the line. The
modal value is the variable value obtained by dividing
the width of the highest rectangle in the histogram in
proportion to the heights of the adjacent rectangles. The
method of determining the mean, median and modal
values from a histogram is shown in Problem 4.
Problem 4.
The time taken in minutes to
assemble a device is measured 50 times and the
results are as shown. Draw a histogram depicting
this data and hence determine the mean, median
and modal values of the distribution.

The histogram is shown in Fig. 58.1. The mean value
lies at the centroid of the histogram. With reference to
any arbitraryaxis, say YY shown at a time of 14minutes,
the position of the horizontal value of thecentroid canbe
obtained from the relationship AM = (am), where A
is the area of the histogram, M is the horizontal distance
of the centroid from the axis YY, ais the area of a rectan-
gle of the histogramand m is the distance of the centroid
of the rectangle from YY. The areas of the individual
rectangles are shown circled on the histogram giving a
total area of 100 square units. The positions, m, of the
centroids of the individual rectangles are1,3,5,...units
from YY. Thus
100M = (10 × 1) + (16 × 3) + (32× 5)
+ (24 × 7) + (12× 9) + (6 × 11)
i.e.
M = 560
100 = 5.6 units from YY

Thus the position of the mean with reference to the time
scale is 14+5.6, i.e. 19.6minutes.
The medianis the value of time correspondingto a verti-
cal line dividing the total area of the histogram into two
equal parts. The total area is 100square units, hence the
vertical line must be drawn to give 50units of area on
each side. To achieve this with reference to Fig. 58.1,
rectangleABFEmustbesplitsothat50−(10+16)units
of area lie on one side and 50−(24+12+6)units of
area lie on the other. This shows that the area of ABFE
is split so that 24units of area lie to the left of the line
and 8units of area lie to the right, i.e. the vertical line
must pass through19.5minutes.Thus the median value
of the distribution is 19.5minutes.
The mode is obtained by dividing the line AB, which
is the height of the highest rectangle, proportionally to
the heights of the adjacent rectangles. With reference to
Fig. 58.1, this is done by joining AC and BD and drawing
a vertical line through the point of intersection of these
two lines. This gives the mode of the distribution and is
19.3minutes.

Thestandarddeviationofasetofdatagivesanindication
of the amount of dispersion, or the scatter, of members
of the set from the measure of central tendency.Its value
is the root-mean-square value of the members of the set
and for discrete data is obtained as follows:
(a)
determine the measure of centraltendency, usually
the mean value (occasionally the median or modal
values are speciﬁed),
(b)
calculate the deviation of each member of the set
from the mean, giving
(x1 −x),(x2 −x),(x3 −x),...,

where x is a member of the set, x is the mean value of
the set and n is the number of members in the set. The
value of standard deviation gives an indication of the
distance of the members of a set from the mean value.
The set: {1,4,7,10,13} has a mean value of 7 and a
standard deviation of about 4.2. The set {5,6,7,8,9}
also has a mean value of 7, but the standard deviation is
about 1.4. This shows that the members of the second
set are mainly much closer to the mean value than the
members of the ﬁrst set. The method of determining the
standard deviation for a set of discrete data is shown in

58.5 Quartiles, deciles and
percentiles
Other measures of dispersion which are sometimes
used are the quartile, decile and percentile values.
The quartile values of a set of discrete data are
obtained by selecting the values of members which
divide the set into four equal parts. Thus for the set:
{2,3,4,5,5,7,9,11,13,14,17} there are 11 members
and the values of the members dividing the set into four
equal parts are 4, 7, and 13. These values are signi-
ﬁed by Q1, Q2 and Q3 and called the ﬁrst, second and
third quartile values, respectively. It can be seen that the
second quartile value, Q2, is the value of the middle
member and hence is the median value of the set.
For groupeddata the ogivemay be used to determinethe
quartile values. In this case, points are selected on the
vertical cumulative frequency values of the ogive, such
that they divide the total value of cumulative frequency
into four equal parts. Horizontal lines are drawn from
these values to cut the ogive. The values of the variable
corresponding to these cutting points on the ogive give
the quartile values (see Problem 7).
When a set contains a large number of members, the
set can be split into ten parts, each containing an equal
number of members. These ten parts are then called
deciles. For sets containing a verylargenumberofmem-
bers, the set may be split into 100 parts, each containing
anequalnumberofmembers.Oneofthesepartsiscalled
a percentile.

5, 34.5
9, 39.5 16, 44.5 27,
49.5 39, 54.5 47, 59.5 48
The ogive is formed by plotting these values on a graph,
as shown in Fig. 58.2. The total frequency is divided
into four equal parts, each having a range of 48/4, i.e.
12. This gives cumulative frequency values of 0 to 12
corresponding to the ﬁrst quartile, 12 to 24 correspond-
ing to the second quartile, 24 to 36 corresponding to
the third quartile and 36 to 48 corresponding to the
fourth quartile of the distribution, i.e. the distribution
is divided into four equal parts. The quartile values are
those of the variable corresponding to cumulative fre-
quency values of 12, 24 and 36, marked Q 1, Q2 and Q3
in Fig. 58.2. These values, correct to the nearest hour,
are 37hours, 43hours and 48hours, respectively. The
Q2 value is also equal to the median value of the distri-
bution. One measure of the dispersion of a distribution
is called the semi-interquartile range and is given by
(Q3 −Q1)/2, and is (48−37)/2 in this case, i.e.

Chapter 59
Probability
Why it is important to understand: Probability
Engineers deal with uncertainty in their work, often with precision and analysis, and probability theory is
widely used to model systems in engineering and scientiﬁc applications. There are a number of examples
of where probability is used in engineering. For example, with electronic circuits, scaling down the power
and energy of such circuits reduces the reliability and predictability of many individual elements, but the
circuits must nevertheless be engineered so that the overall circuit is reliable. Centres for disease control
need to decide whether to institute massive vaccination or other preventative measures in the face of
globally threatening, possibly mutating diseases in humans and animals. System designers must weigh
the costs and beneﬁts of measures for reliability and security, such as levels of backups and ﬁrewalls, in
the face of uncertainty about threats from equipment failures or malicious attackers. Models incorpo-
rating probability theory have been developed and are continuously being improved for understanding
the brain, gene pools within populations, weather and climate forecasts, microelectronic devices, and
imaging systems such as computer aided tomography (CAT) scan and radar. The electric power grid,
including power generating stations, transmission lines, and consumers, is a complex system with many
redundancies; however, breakdowns occur, and guidance for investment comes from modelling the most
likely sequences of events that could cause outage. Similar planning and analysis is done for communica-
tion networks, transportation networks, water, and other infrastructure. Probabilities, permutations and
combinations are used daily in many different ﬁelds that range from gambling and games, to mechanical
or structural failure rates, to rates of detection in medical screening. Uncertainty is clearly all around us,
in our daily lives and in many professions. Use of standard deviation is widely used when results of opinion
polls are described. The language of probability theory lets people break down complex problems, and to
argue about pieces of them with each other, and then aggregate information about subsystems to analyse
a whole system. This chapter brieﬂy introduces the important subject of probability.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne probability
•
deﬁne expectation, dependent event, independent event and conditional probability
•
state the addition and multiplication laws of probability
•
use the laws of probability in simple calculations
•
use the laws of probability in practical situations
•
determine permutations and combinations
•
understand and use Bayes’ theorem

Introduction to probability
The probability of something happening is the likeli-
hood or chance of it happening.Values of probability lie
between 0 and 1, where 0 represents an absolute impos-
sibility and 1 represents an absolute certainty. The prob-
ability of an event happening usually lies somewhere
between these two extreme values and is expressed
either as a proper or decimal fraction. Examples of
probability are:
that a length of copper wire
has zero resistance at 100◦C
0
that a fair, six-sided dice will
stop with a 3 upwards
1
6 or 0.1667
that a fair coin will land with
a head upwards
1
2 or 0.5
that a length of copper wire has
some resistance at 100◦C
1
If p is the probability of an event happening and q is the
probability of the same event not happening, then the
total probability is p+q and is equal to unity, since it is
an absolute certainty that the event either does or does
not occur, i.e. p+q=1
Expectation
The expectation, E, of an event happening is deﬁned
in general terms as the product of the probability p of
an event happening and the number of attempts made,
n, i.e. E=pn
Thus, since the probability of obtaining a 3 upwards
when rolling a fair dice is 1
6, the expectation of getting a
3 upwards within four throws of the dice is 1
6 × 4, i.e. 2
3
Thus expectation is the average occurrence of an
event.
Dependent event
A dependent event is one in which the probability of
an event happening affects the probability of another
event happening. Let ﬁve transistors be taken at ran-
dom from a batch of 100 transistors for test purposes,
and the probability of there being a defective transistor,
p1, be determined. At some later time, let another ﬁve
transistors be taken at random from the 95 remaining
transistors in the batch and the probabilityof there being
a defective transistor, p2, be determined. The value of
p2 is different from p1 since batch size has effectively
altered from 100 to 95, i.e. probability p2 is dependent
on probability p1 Since ﬁve transistors are drawn, and
then another ﬁve transistors drawn without replacing
the ﬁrst ﬁve, the second random selection is said to be
without replacement.
Independent event
An independent event is one in which the probability
of an event happening does not affect the probability of
another event happening. If ﬁve transistors are taken at
randomfroma batch of transistors and the probabilityof
a defective transistor p1 is determined and the process
is repeated after the original ﬁve have been replaced in
the batch to give p2, then p1 is equal to p2. Since the
ﬁve transistors are replaced between draws, the second
selection is said to be with replacement.
Conditional probability
Conditional probability is concerned with the probabil-
ity of say event B occurring, given that event A has
already taken place.
If A and B are independent events, then the fact that
event A has already occurred will not affect the proba-
bility of event B.
If A and B are dependent events, then event A having
occurred will effect the probability of event B.
59.2
Laws of probability
The addition law of probability
The addition law of probability is recognized by the
word ‘or’ joining the probabilities. If pA is the proba-
bility of event A happening and pB is the probability
of event B happening, the probability of event A or
event B happeningis given by pA + pB (providedevents
A and B are mutually exclusive, i.e. A and B are events
which cannot occur together). Similarly, the probability
of events A or B or C or ...N happening is given by
pA +pB +pC +··· +pN
The multiplication law of probability
The multiplication law of probability is recognized by
the word ‘and’ joining the probabilities. If pA is the
probability of event A happening and pB is the proba-
bility of event B happening, the probability of event A
and event B happening is given by pA×pB. Similarly,
theprobabilityofeventsA and B and C and ...N hap-
pening is given by
pA ×pB ×pC ×··· ×pN

A batch of 100 capacitors contains
73 which are within the required tolerance values,
17 which are below the required tolerance values,
and the remainder are above the required tolerance
values. Determine the probabilities that when
randomly selecting a capacitor and then a second
capacitor: (a) both are within the required tolerance
values when selecting with replacement, and (b) the
ﬁrst one drawn is below and the second one drawn
is above the required tolerance value, when
selection is without replacement.
(a)
The probability of selecting a capacitor within the
required tolerance values is 73
100. The ﬁrst capac-
itor drawn is now replaced and a second one is
drawn from the batch of 100. The probability of
this capacitor being within the required tolerance
values is also 73

Thus, the probabilityof selecting a capacitorwithin
the required tolerance values for both the ﬁrst and
the second draw is

(b)
The probability of obtaining a capacitor below the
required tolerance values on the ﬁrst draw is 17

There are now only 99 capacitors left in the batch,
since the ﬁrst capacitor is not replaced. The proba-
bility of drawing a capacitor above the required tol-
erance values on the second draw is 10
99, since there
are (100−73−17), i.e. ten capacitors above the
required tolerance value. Thus, the probability of
randomly selecting a capacitor below the required
tolerance values and followed by randomly select-

Problem 6.
A batch of 40 components contains
ﬁve which are defective. A component is drawn at
random from the batch and tested and then a second
component is drawn. Determine the probability that
neither of the components is defective when drawn
(a) with replacement, and (b) without replacement.

Section K

(a) With replacement
The probability that the component selected on the ﬁrst
draw is satisfactory is 35
40, i.e. 7
8. The component is now
replaced and a second draw is made. The probability
that this component is also satisfactory is 7
8. Hence, the
probability that both the ﬁrst component drawn and the
second component drawn are satisfactory is:
7
8 × 7
8 = 49
64 or 0.7656
(b) Without replacement
The probability that the ﬁrst component drawn is sat-
isfactory is 7
8. There are now only 34 satisfactory
components left in the batch and the batch numberis 39.
Hence, the probability of drawing a satisfactory compo-
nent on the second draw is 34
39. Thus the probability that
the ﬁrst component drawn and the second component
drawn are satisfactory, i.e. neither is defective, is:

Problem 7.
A batch of 40 components contains
ﬁve which are defective. If a component is drawn at
random from the batch and tested and then a second
component is drawn at random, calculate the
probability of having one defective component,
both with and without replacement.
The probability of having one defective component can
be achieved in two ways. If p is the probability of draw-
ing a defective component and q is the probability of
drawing a satisfactory component, then the probability
of having one defective component is given by drawing
a satisfactory component and then a defective compo-
nent or by drawing a defective component and then a
satisfactory one, i.e. by q × p+p×q
With replacement:
p = 5
40 = 1

and
q = 35

Hence, probability of having one defective compo-
nent is:

A box contains 74 brass washers,
86 steel washers and 40 aluminium washers. Three
washers are drawn at random from the box without
replacement. Determine the probability that all
three are steel washers.
Assume, for clarity of explanation, that a washer is
drawn at random, then a second, then a third (although
this assumption does not affect the results obtained).
The total number of washers is 74 + 86 + 40, i.e. 200.
The probability of randomly selecting a steel washer on
the ﬁrst draw is 86
200. There are now 85 steel washers in
a batch of 199. The probability of randomly selecting a
steel washer on the second draw is 85
199. There are now
84 steel washers in a batch of 198. The probability of
randomly selecting a steel washer on the third draw is
84

on the ﬁrst draw and the second draw and the third
draw is:

Permutations and combinations
Permutations
If n different objects are available, they can be arranged
in different orders of selection. Each different ordered
arrangement is called a permutation. For example,
permutations of the three letters X, Y and Z taken
together are:
XYZ,XZY,YXZ,YZX,ZXY and ZYX
This can be expressed as 3P3 = 6, the raised 3 denot-
ing the number of items from which the arrangements
are made, and the lowered 3 indicating the number of
items used in each arrangement.
If we take the same three letters XYZ two at a time the
permutations
XY,YX,XZ,ZX,YZ,ZY
can be found, and denoted by 3P2 =6
(Note that the orderof the letters matter in permutations,
i.e. YX is a different permutation from XY.) In general,
nPr =n(n−1) (n−2)...(n−r +1) or
nPr =
n!
(n −r)! as stated in Chapter 15
For example, 5P4 =5(4)(3)(2)=120 or
5P4 =
5!
(5−4)! = 5!
1! =(5)(4)(3)(2)=120
Also, 3P3 =6 from above; using nPr =
n!
(n−r)! gives
3P3 =
3!
(3−3)! = 6
0!. Since this must equal 6, then 0!=1
(check this with your calculator).
Combinations
If selections of the three letters X, Y, Z are made with-
out regard to the order of the letters in each group,
i.e. XY is now the same as YX for example, then each
group is called a combination. The number of possi-
ble combinations is denoted by nCr, where n is the
total number of items and r is the number in each
selection.
In general,
nCr =
n!
r!(n −r)!
For example,
5C4 =
5!
4!(5 −4)! = 5!

= 5 × 4× 3 × 2 × 1

Bayes’ theorem
Bayes’ theorem is one of probability theory (originally
stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes), and may be
seen as a way of understanding how the probability that
a theory is true is affected by a new piece of evidence.
The theorem has been used in a wide variety of con-
texts, ranging from marine biology to the development
of ‘Bayesian’ spam blockers for email systems; in sci-
ence, it has been used to try to clarify the relationship
between theory and evidence. Insights in the philoso-
phy of science involving conﬁrmation, falsiﬁcation and
other topics can be made more precise, and sometimes
extended or corrected, by using Bayes’ theorem.
Bayes’ theorem may be stated mathematically as:
P(A1 |B)
=
P(B|A1 )P(A1)
P(B|A1 )P(A1) + P(B|A2 )P(A2) + ....
or P(Ai |B)
=
P(B|Ai )P(Ai)
n
j=1
PB
Aj
PAj
(i = 1,2,...,n)
where P(A|B)is the probability of A given B, i.e. after
B is observed.
P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities ofA andB without
regard to each other, and P (B |A) is the probability of
observing event B given that A is true.

Section K
Probability
647
In the Bayes theorem formula, ‘A’ represents a the-
ory or hypothesis that is to be tested, and ‘B’ represents
a new piece of evidence that seems to conﬁrm or dis-
prove the theory. Bayes’ theorem is demonstrated in the
following worked problem.
Problem 15.
An outdoor degree ceremony is
taking place tomorrow, 5 July, in the hot climate of
Dubai. In recent years it has rained only 2 days in
the four-month period June to September. However,
the weather forecaster has predicted rain for
tomorrow. When it actually rains, the weatherman
correctly forecasts rain 85% of the time. When it
doesn’t rain, he incorrectly forecasts rain 15% of
the time. Determine the probability that it will rain
tomorrow.
There are two possible mutually-exclusive events occur-
ring here – it either rains or it does not rain. Also, a third
event occurs when the weatherman predicts rain.
Let the notation for these events be:
Event A1
It rains at the ceremony
Event A2
It does not rain at the ceremony
Event B
The weatherman predicts rain
The probability values are:
P(A1) =
2
30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 1
61
(i.e. it rains 2 days in the months June to September
P(A2) =
120
30 + 31 + 31 + 30 = 60
61
(i.e. it does not rain for 120 of the 122 days
in the months June to September)
P(B|A1 ) = 0.85
(i.e. when it rains, the weatherman predicts rain
85% of the time)
P(B|A2 ) = 0.15
(i.e. when it does not rains, the weatherman
predicts rain 15% of the time)
Using Bayes’ theorem to determine the probability that
it will rain tomorrow, given the forecast of rain by the
weatherman:
P(A1 |B) =
P(B|A1 )P(A1)
P(B|A1 )P(A1) + P(B|A2 )P(A2)
=
(0.85)

61 + 0.15 × 60
61
= 0.0139344
0.1614754
= 0.0863 or 8.63%
Even when the weatherman predicts rain, it rains only
between 8% and 9% of the time. Hence, there is a good
chance it will not rain tomorrow in Dubai for the
degree ceremony.

Chapter 60
The binomial and
Poisson distributions
Why it is important to understand: The binomial and Poisson distributions
The binomial distribution is used only when both of two conditions are met −the test has only two possible
outcomes, and the sample must be random. If both of these conditions are met, then this distribution may
be used to predict the probability of a desired result. For example, a binomial distribution may be used
in determining whether a new drug being tested has or has not contributed to alleviating symptoms of a
disease. Common applications of this distribution range from scientiﬁc and engineering applications to
military and medical ones, in quality assurance, genetics and in experimental design.
A Poisson distribution has several applications, and is essentially a derived limiting case of the binomial
distribution. It is most applicable to a situation in which the total number of successes is known, but the
number of trials is not. An example of such a situation would be if the mean expected number of cancer
cells present per sample is known and it was required to determine the probability of ﬁnding 1.5 times
that amount of cells in any given sample; this is an example of when the Poisson distribution would be
used. The Poisson distribution has widespread applications in analysing trafﬁc ﬂow, in fault prediction
on electric cables, in the prediction of randomly occurring accidents, and in reliability engineering.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne the binomial distribution
•
use the binomial distribution
•
apply the binomial distribution to industrial inspection
•
draw a histogram of probabilities
•
deﬁne the Poisson distribution
•
apply the Poisson distribution to practical situations
60.1
The binomial distribution
The binomial distribution deals with two numbers only,
these being the probability that an event will happen, p,
andtheprobabilitythataneventwillnothappen,q.Thus,
when a coin is tossed, if p is the probability of the coin
landing with a head upwards, q is the probability of the
coin landing with a tail upwards. p + q must always be
equal to unity. A binomial distribution can be used for
ﬁnding, say, the probability of getting three heads in

seven tosses of the coin, or in industry for determining
defect rates as a result of sampling. One way of deﬁning
a binomial distribution is as follows:
‘If p is the probability that an event will happen and
q is the probability that the event will not happen,
then the probabilities that the event will happen
0, 1, 2, 3, ...,n times in n trials are given by the
successive terms of the expansion of (q + p)n, taken
from left to right.’
The binomial expansion of (q + p)n is:

+ n(n −1)(n −2)

one boy in a family of four children, assuming
equal probability of male and female birth.
The probability of a girl being born, p, is 0.5 and the
probability of a girl not being born (male birth), q,
is also 0.5. The number in the family, n, is 4. From
above, the probabilities of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 girls in a family of
four are given by the successive terms of the expansion
of (q + p)4 taken from left to right. From the binomial
expansion:
(q + p)4 = q4 + 4q3p + 6q2p2 + 4qp3 + p4
Hence the probability of no girls is q 4,
i.e.
0.54 = 0.0625
the probability of one girl is 4q 3p,
i.e.
4 × 0.53 × 0.5 = 0.2500
the probability of two girls is 6q 2p2,
i.e.
6 × 0.52 × 0.52 = 0.3750
the probability of three girls is 4qp3,
i.e.
4 × 0.5 × 0.53 = 0.2500
the probability of four girls is p4,
i.e.
0.54 = 0.0625
Total probability, (q + p)4 = 1.0000
(a)
The probability of having at least one girl is the
sum of the probabilities of having 1, 2, 3 and 4
girls, i.e.
0.2500 + 0.3750+ 0.2500+ 0.0625 = 0.9375
(Alternatively, the probability of having at least
one girl is: 1 −(the probability of having no
girls), i.e. 1 −0.0625, giving 0.9375, as obtained
previously.)
(b)
The probability of having at least one girl and
one boy is given by the sum of the probabilities
of having: one girl and three boys, two girls and
two boys and three girls and two boys, i.e.
0.2500+ 0.3750+ 0.2500=0.8750
(Alternatively,this is also the probabilityof having
1 −(probabilityof having no girls + probabilityof
having no boys), i.e.
1−2×0.0625=0.8750, as obtained previously.)
Problem 2.
A dice is rolled nine times. Find the
probabilities of having a 4 upwards (a) three times
and (b) fewer than four times.
Let p be the probability of having a 4 upwards. Then
p = 1/6, since dice have six sides.
Let q be the probability of not having a 4 upwards.
Then q =5/6. The probabilities of having a 4 upwards
0,1,2,...,n times are given by the successive terms of
the expansionof (q + p)n, taken from left to right. From
the binomial expansion:
(q + p)9 = q9 + 9q8p + 36q7p2 + 84q6p3 + ···
The probability of having a 4 upwards zero times is
q9 = (5/6)9 = 0.1938
The probability of having a 4 upwards once is
9q8p = 9(5/6)8(1/6) = 0.3489
The probability of having a 4 upwards twice is
36q7p2 = 36(5/6)7(1/6)2 = 0.2791
The probability of having a 4 upwards three times is
84q6p3 = 84(5/6)6(1/6)3 = 0.1302
(a)
The probability of having a 4 upwards three times
is 0.1302

Section K
The binomial and Poisson distributions
653
(b)
The probability of having a 4 upwards fewer than
four times is the sum of the probabilities of having
a 4 upwards zero, one, two, and three times, i.e.
0.1938 + 0.3489 + 0.2791 + 0.1302= 0.9520
Industrial inspection
In industrial inspection, p is often taken as the
probability that a component is defective and q is the
probability that the component is satisfactory. In this
case, a binomial distribution may be deﬁned as:
‘The probabilities that 0, 1, 2, 3,…, n components
are defective in a sample of n components, drawn
at random from a large batch of components, are
given by the successive terms of the expansion of
(q+p)n, taken from left to right.’
This deﬁnition is used in Problems 3 and 4.
Problem 3.
A machine is producing a large
number of bolts automatically. In a box of these
bolts, 95% are within the allowable tolerance values
with respect to diameter, the remainder being
outside of the diameter tolerance values. Seven
bolts are drawn at random from the box. Determine
the probabilities that (a) two and (b) more than two
of the seven bolts are outside of the diameter
tolerance values.
Let p be the probability that a bolt is outside of the
allowable tolerance values, i.e. is defective, and let q be
the probability that a bolt is within the tolerance values,
i.e. is satisfactory. Then p = 5%, i.e. 0.05per unit and
q =95%, i.e. 0.95per unit. The sample number is 7.
The probabilities of drawing 0,1,2, ...,n defective
bolts are given by the successive terms of the expansion
of (q + p)n, taken from left to right. In this problem
(q + p)n = (0.95 + 0.05)7
= 0.957 + 7 × 0.956 × 0.05
+ 21 × 0.955 × 0.052 + ···
Thus the probability of no defective bolts is
0.957 = 0.6983
The probability of one defective bolt is
7 × 0.956 × 0.05= 0.2573
The probability of two defective bolts is
21 × 0.955 × 0.052 = 0.0406, and so on.
(a)
The probability that two bolts are outside of the
diameter tolerance values is 0.0406.
(b)
To determine the probability that more than
two bolts are defective, the sum of the probabil-
ities of three bolts, four bolts, ﬁve bolts, six bolts
and seven bolts being defective can be determined.
An easier way to ﬁnd this sum is to ﬁnd 1 −(sum
of zero bolts, one bolt and two bolts being defec-
tive), since the sum of all the terms is unity. Thus,
the probability of there being more than two bolts
outside of the tolerance values is:
1 −(0.6983 + 0.2573 + 0.0406), i.e. 0.0038
Problem 4.
A package contains 50 similar
components and inspection shows that four
have been damaged during transit. If six
components are drawn at random from the contents
of the package determine the probabilities that in
this sample (a) one and (b) fewer than three are
damaged.
The probability of a component being damaged, p,
is 4 in 50, i.e. 0.08per unit. Thus, the probability of a
component not being damaged, q, is 1 −0.08, i.e. 0.92.
The probability of there being 0,1,2,...,6 damaged
components is given by the successive terms of
(q + p)6, taken from left to right.
(q + p)6 = q6 + 6q5p + 15q4p2 + 20q3p3 + ···
(a)
The probability of one damaged component is
6q5p = 6 × 0.925 × 0.08 = 0.3164
(b)
The probabilityof fewer than three damaged com-
ponents is given by the sum of the probabilities of
zero, one and two damaged components.
q6 + 6q5p + 15q4p2
= 0.926 + 6 × 0.925 × 0.08
+ 15 × 0.924 × 0.082
= 0.6064+ 0.3164+ 0.0688 = 0.9916

The probability of a student
successfully completing a course of study in three
years is 0.45. Draw a histogram showing the
probabilities of 0,1,2,...,10 students successfully
completing the course in three years.
Let p be the probability of a student successfully com-
pleting a course of study in three years and q be
the probability of not doing so. Then p = 0.45 and
q = 0.55. The number of students, n, is 10
The probabilities of 0,1,2,...,10 students successfully
completing the course are given by the successive terms
of the expansion of (q + p)10, taken from left to right.
(q + p)10 = q10 + 10q9p + 45q8p2 + 120q7p3
+ 210q6p4 + 252q5p5 + 210q4p6
+ 120q3p7 + 45q2p8 + 10qp9 + p10
Substituting q = 0.55 and p = 0.45 in this expansion
gives the values of the successive terms as: 0.0025,
0.0207, 0.0763, 0.1665, 0.2384, 0.2340, 0.1596,0.0746,

The Poisson distribution
When the number of trials, n, in a binomial distribution
becomes large (usually taken as larger than ten), the

calculations associated with determining the values of
the terms becomes laborious. If n is large and p is small,
and the product np is less than 5, a very good approxi-
mation to a binomial distribution is given by the corre-
sponding Poisson∗distribution, in which calculations
are usually simpler.
The Poisson approximation to a binomial distribution
may be deﬁned as follows:
‘The probabilities that an event will happen 0, 1, 2,
3,…, n times in n trials are given by the successive
terms of the expression
e−λ

and is equal to np.

probabilities that in a sample of 80 gearwheels
(a) two and (b) more than two will be defective.
The sample number, n, is large, the probability of a
defective gearwheel, p, is small and the product np is
80 × 0.03, i.e. 2.4, which is less than 5
Hence a Poisson approximation to a binomial distri-
bution may be used. The expectation of a defective
gearwheel, λ = np = 2.4
The probabilities of 0,1,2,... defective gearwheels are

Thus probability of no defective gearwheels is

probability of one defective gearwheel is

probability of two defective gearwheels is

(a)
The probability of having two defective gear-
wheels is 0.2613
(b)
The probability of having more than two defec-
tive gearwheels is 1 −(the sum of the probabilities
of having zero, one, and two defective gear-
wheels), i.e.
1 −(0.0907 + 0.2177 + 0.2613),
that is, 0.4303
The principal use of a Poisson distribution is to deter-
mine the theoretical probabilities when p, the prob-
ability of an event happening, is known, but q, the
probability of the event not happening is unknown. For
example, the average number of goals scored per match
by a football team can be calculated, but it is not pos-
sible to quantify the number of goals which were not
scored. In this type of problem, a Poisson distribution
may be deﬁned as follows:

The symbol λ is the value of the average occurrence of

A production department has 35
similar milling machines. The number of
breakdowns on each machine averages 0.06per

Since the average occurrence of a breakdown is known
but the number of times when a machine did not break
down is unknown, a Poisson distribution must be used.
The expectation of a breakdown for 35 machines is
35 × 0.06, i.e. 2.1 breakdowns per week. The proba-

given by the successive terms of the expression

The normal distribution
Why it is important to understand: The normal distribution
A normal distribution is a very important statistical data distribution pattern occurring in many natural
phenomena, such as height, blood pressure, lengths of objects produced by machines, marks in a test,
errors in measurements, and so on. In general, when data is gathered, we expect to see a particular
pattern to the data, called a normal distribution. This is a distribution where the data is evenly distributed
around the mean in a very regular way, which when plotted as a histogram will result in a bell curve. The
normal distribution is the most important of all probability distributions; it is applied directly to many
practical problems in every engineering discipline. There are two principal applications of the normal
distribution to engineering and reliability. One application deals with the analysis of items which exhibit
failure to wear, such as mechanical devices – frequently the wear-out failure distribution is sufﬁciently
close to normal that the use of this distribution for predicting or assessing reliability is valid. Another
application is in the analysis of manufactured items and their ability to meet speciﬁcations. No two parts
made to the same speciﬁcation are exactly alike; the variability of parts leads to a variability in systems
composed of those parts. The design must take this variability into account, otherwise the system may
not meet the speciﬁcation requirement due to the combined effect of part variability.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise a normal curve
•
use the normal distribution in calculations
•
test for a normal distribution using probability paper
61.1 Introduction to the normal
distribution
When data is obtained, it can frequently be considered
to be a sample (i.e. a few members) drawn at random
from a large population (i.e. a set having many mem-
bers). If the sample number is large, it is theoretically
possible to choose class intervals which are very small,
but which still have a number of members falling within
each class. A frequency polygon of this data then has a
large number of small line segments and approximates
toacontinuouscurve.Suchacurveiscalledafrequency
or a distribution curve.
An extremely important symmetrical distribution curve
is called the normal curve and is as shown in Fig. 61.1.
This curve can be described by a mathematical equa-
tion and is the basis of much of the work done in more
advanced statistics. Many natural occurrences such as
the heights or weights of a group of people, the sizes
of components produced by a particular machine and
the life length of certain components approximate to a
normal distribution.

Normal distribution curves can differ from one another
in the following four ways:
(a)
by having different mean values
(b)
by having different values of standard deviations
(c)
the variables having different values and different
units and
(d)
by having different areas between the curve and
the horizontal axis.
A normal distribution curve is standardised as fol-
lows:
(a)
The mean value of the unstandardised curve is
made the origin, thus making the mean value,
x, zero.
(b)
The horizontal axis is scaled in standard devia-
tions. This is done by letting z= x −x
σ
, where
z is called the normal standard variate, x is the
value of the variable, x is the mean value of the
distribution and σ is the standard deviation of the
distribution.
(c)
The area between the normal curve and the hori-
zontal axis is made equal to unity.
When a normal distribution curve has been standard-
ised, the normal curve is called a standardised normal
curve or a normal probability curve, and any normally
distributed data may be represented by the same normal
probability curve.
The area under part of a normal probability curve is
directly proportional to probability and the value of the
shaded area shown in Fig. 61.2 can be determined by
evaluating:

Problem 1.
The mean height of 500 people is
170cm and the standard deviation is 9cm.
Assuming the heights are normally distributed,
determine the number of people likely to have
heights between 150cm and 195cm.
The mean value, x, is 170cm and corresponds to a
normal standard variate value, z, of zero on the stan-
dardised normal curve. A height of 150cm has a z-value
given by z= x −x
σ
standard deviations, i.e. 150−170
9
or −2.22 standard deviations. Using a table of par-
tial areas beneath the standardised normal curve (see
Table 61.1), a z-value of −2.22 corresponds to an area
of 0.4868 between the mean value and the ordinate
z=−2.22. The negative z-value shows that it lies to
the left of the z=0 ordinate.
This area is shown shaded in Fig. 61.3(a). Similarly,
195cm has a z-value of 195−170
9
that is 2.78 standard
deviations. From Table 61.1, this value of z corresponds
to an area of 0.4973, the positive value of z showing
that it lies to the right of the z=0 ordinate. This area
is shown shaded in Fig. 61.3(b). The total area shaded
in Figs. 61.3(a) and (b) is shown in Fig. 61.3(c) and is
0.4868+0.4973, i.e. 0.9841 of the total area beneath
the curve.
However,the area is directly proportionalto probability.
Thus, the probability that a person will have a height
of between 150 and 195cm is 0.9841. For a group of
500 people, 500×0.9841, i.e. 492 people are likely to
have heights in this range. The value of500×0.9841 is
492.05, but since answers based on a normal probability
distribution can only be approximate,results are usually
given correct to the nearest whole number.

The area between z=0 and z=−0.56 (from Table 61.1)
is 0.2123, shown shaded in Fig. 61.4(a). The total area
under the standardised normal curve is unity and since
the curve is symmetrical, it follows that the total area
to the left of the z=0 ordinate is 0.5000. Thus the area
to the left of the z=−0.56 ordinate (‘left’ means ‘less
than’, ‘right’ means ‘more than’) is 0.5000−0.2123,
i.e. 0.2877 of the total area, which is shown shaded in

between z=0, z=2.67 and the standardised normal
curve is 0.4962, shown shaded in Fig. 61.5(a). Since
the standardised normal curve is symmetrical, the total
area to the right of the z=0 ordinate is 0.5000,hence the
shaded area shown in Fig. 61.5(b) is 0.5000−0.4962,
i.e. 0.0038. This area represents the probability of a per-
son having a height of more than 194cm, and for 500
people, the number of people likely to have a height of
more than 194cm is 0.0038×500, i.e. two people.

(c)
the number of bottles likely to contain more

(d)
the number of bottles likely to contain

(a)
The z-value corresponding to 750ml is given
by x −x
σ
i.e. 750−753
1.8
=−1.67 standard devi-
ations. From Table 61.1, the area between z=0
and z=−1.67 is 0.4525. Thus the area to the
left of the z=−1.67 ordinate is 0.5000−0.4525
(see Problem 2), i.e. 0.0475. This is the prob-
ability of a bottle containing less than 750ml.
Thus, for a batch of 1500 bottles, it is likely that
1500×0.0475, i.e. 71 bottles will contain less
than 750ml.
(b)
The z-value corresponding to 751 and 754ml
are 751−753
1.8
and 754−753
1.8
i.e. −1.11 and
0.56 respectively. From Table 61.1, the areas
corresponding to these values are 0.3665 and
0.2123 respectively. Thus the probability of a
bottle containing between 751 and 754ml is
0.3665+0.2123 (see Problem 1), i.e. 0.5788. For
1500 bottles, it is likely that 1500×0.5788, i.e.
868bottleswillcontainbetween751and754ml.
(c)
Thez-valuecorrespondingto757mlis 757−753
1.8
,
i.e. 2.22 standard deviations. From Table 61.1,
the area corresponding to a z-value of 2.22 is
0.4868. The area to the right of the z=2.22
ordinate is 0.5000−0.4868 (see Problem 3), i.e.
0.0132. Thus, for 1500 bottles, it is likely that
1500×0.0132, i.e. 20 bottles will have contents
of more than 757ml.
(d)
The z-value corresponding to 750ml is −1.67
(see part (a)), and the z-value corresponding to
751ml is −1.11 (see part (b)). The areas corre-
sponding to these z-values are 0.4525 and 0.3665
respectively, and both these areas lie on the left
of the z=0 ordinate. The area between z=−1.67
and z=−1.11 is 0.4525−0.3665, i.e. 0.0860 and
this is the probability of a bottle having contents
between 750 and 751ml. For 1500 bottles, it is
likely that 1500×0.0860, i.e. 129 bottles will be
in this range.

61.2
Testing for a normal distribution
It should never be assumed that because data is con-
tinuous it automatically follows that it is normally
distributed. One way of checking that data is normally
distributed is by using normal probability paper, often
just called probability paper. This is special graph
paper which has linear markings on one axis and per-
centage probability values from 0.01 to 99.99 on the
other axis (see Figs. 61.6 and 61.7). The divisions on the
probabilityaxis are such that a straight line graph results
for normally distributed data when percentage cumu-
lative frequency values are plotted against upper class
boundary values. If the points do not lie in a reasonably
straight line, then the data is not normally distributed.
The method used to test the normality of a distributionis
showninProblems5and6.Themeanvalueandstandard
deviation of normally distributed data may be deter-
mined using normal probability paper. For normally dis-
tributed data, the area beneath the standardised normal
curve and a z-value of unity (i.e. one standard devia-
tion) may be obtained from Table 61.1. For one standard
deviation, this area is 0.3413, i.e. 34.13%. An area of
±1 standard deviation is symmetrically placed on either
side of the z=0 value, i.e. is symmetrically placed
on either side of the 50% cumulative frequency value.
Thus an area corresponding to ±1 standard deviation
extendsfrompercentagecumulativefrequencyvaluesof
(50+34.13)% to (50−34.13)%, i.e. from 84.13% to
15.87%. For most purposes, these values are taken as
84% and 16%. Thus, when using normal probability
paper, the standard deviation of the distribution is
given by:

To test the normality of a distribution, the upper class
boundary/percentage cumulative frequency values are
plotted on normal probability paper. The upper class
boundary values are: 30, 31, 32,…, 38, 39. The corre-
sponding cumulative frequency values (for ‘less than’
the upper class boundary values) are: 2, (4+2)=6,
(6+4+2)=12, 20, 29, 37, 43, 47, 49 and 50. The cor-
responding percentage cumulative frequency values are
2
50 ×100=4, 6
50 ×100=12, 24, 40, 58, 74, 86, 94, 98
and 100%
The co-ordinates of upper class boundary/percentage
cumulative frequency values are plotted as shown
in Fig. 61.6. When plotting these values, it will always
be found that the co-ordinate for the 100% cumulative
frequency value cannot be plotted, since the maximum
value on the probability scale is 99.99. Since the points
plotted in Fig. 61.6 lie very nearly in a straight line,
the data is approximately normally distributed.
The mean value and standard deviation can be deter-
mined from Fig. 61.6. Since a normal curve is sym-
metrical, the mean value is the value of the variable
corresponding to a 50% cumulative frequency value,
shown as point P on the graph. This shows that the
mean value is 33.6kg. The standard deviation is deter-
mined using the 84% and 16% cumulative frequency
values, shown as Q and R in Fig. 61.6. The variable val-
ues for Q and R are 35.7 and 31.4 respectively; thus two
standard deviations correspond to 35.7−31.4, i.e. 4.3,
showing that the standard deviation of the distribution
is approximately 4.3
2 i.e. 2.15 standard deviations.
The mean value and standard deviation of the distribu-
tion can be calculated using
mean, x =
f x

f 
and standard deviation,
σ =

	
	

[f (x −¯x)2]

f


where f is the frequency of a class andxis the class mid-
point value. Using these formulae gives a mean value
of the distribution of 33.6 (as obtained graphically) and
a standard deviation of 2.12, showing that the graphical
method of determining the mean and standard deviation
give quite realistic results.

To test the normality of a distribution, the upper class
boundary/percentage cumulative frequency values are
plotted on normal probability paper. The upper class
boundaryvalues are: 10, 20, 30,…,90 and100. The cor-
respondingcumulativefrequencyvaluesare1,1+2=3,
1+2+3=6, 12, 21, 27, 29, 31, 32 and 33. The per-

The co-ordinates of upper class boundary values/per-
centage cumulative frequency values are plotted as
showninFig.61.7.Althoughsixofthepointslieapprox-
imately in a straight line, three points corresponding to
upper class boundary values of 50, 60 and 70 are not
close to the line and indicate that the distribution is
not normally distributed. However, if a normal dis-
tribution is assumed, the mean value corresponds to
the variable value at a cumulative frequency of 50%
and, from Fig. 61.7, point A is 48. The value of the
standard deviation of the distribution can be obtained
from the variable values corresponding to the 84% and
16% cumulative frequency values, shown as B and C in
Fig. 61.7 and give: 2σ =69−28, i.e. the standard devi-
ation σ =20.5. The calculated values of the mean and
standard deviation of the distribution are 45.9 and 19.4
respectively, showing that errors are introduced if the
graphical method of determining these values is used
for data which is not normally distributed.

Chapter 62
Linear correlation
Why it is important to understand: Linear correlation
Correlation coefﬁcients measure the strength of association between two variables. The most common
correlation coefﬁcient, called the product-moment correlation coefﬁcient, measures the strength of the
linear association between variables. A positive value indicates a positive correlation and the higher the
value, the stronger the correlation. Similarly, a negative value indicates a negative correlation and the
lower the value the stronger the correlation. This chapter explores linear correlation and the meaning of
values obtained calculating the coefﬁcient of correlation.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
recognise linear correlation
•
state the product-moment formula
•
appreciate the signiﬁcance of a coefﬁcient of correlation
•
determine the linear coefﬁcient of correlation between two given variables
62.1
Introduction to linear correlation
Correlation is a measure of the amount of association
existing between two variables. For linear correlation,
if points are plotted on a graph and all the points lie on
a straight line, then perfect linear correlation is said
to exist. When a straight line having a positive gradi-
ent can reasonably be drawn through points on a graph
positive or direct linear correlation exists, as shown
in Fig. 62.1(a). Similarly, when a straight line having
a negative gradient can reasonably be drawn through
points on a graph, negative or inverse linear correla-
tion exists, as shown in Fig. 62.1(b). When there is no
apparent relationship between co-ordinate values plot-
ted on a graph then no correlation exists between the
points, as shown in Fig. 62.1(c). In statistics, when two
variables are being investigated, the location of the co-
ordinates on a rectangular co-ordinate system is called
a scatter diagram – as shown in Fig. 62.1.
62.2
The Pearson product-moment
formula for determining the
linear correlation coefﬁcient
The Pearson product-momentcorrelationcoefﬁcient (or
Pearson correlation coefﬁcient, for short) is a mea-
sure of the strength of a linear association between two
variables and is denoted by the symbol r. A Pearson
product-moment correlation attempts to draw a line of
best ﬁt through the data of two variables, and the Pear-
son correlation coefﬁcient, r, indicates how far away all
these data points are to this line of best ﬁt (how well
the data points ﬁt this new model/line of best ﬁt). The
product-moment formula states:
coefﬁcient of correlation,

ordinates X from X, their mean value and the y-values
arethevaluesofthedeviationsofco-ordinatesY fromY,
their mean value. That is, x =(X−X) and y =(Y −Y).
The results of this determination give values of r lying
between +1 and −1, where +1 indicates perfect direct
correlation, −1 indicates perfect inverse correlation and
0 indicates that no correlation exists. Between these val-
ues, the smaller the value of r, the less is the amount of
correlation which exists. Generally, values of r in the
ranges 0.7 to 1 and −0.7 to −1 show that a fair amount
of correlation exists.
62.3 The signiﬁcance of a coefﬁcient
of correlation
When the value of the coefﬁcient of correlationhas been
obtained from the product-moment formula, some care
is needed before coming to conclusions based on this
result. Checks shouldbe made to ascertain the following
two points:
(a)
that a ‘cause and effect’ relationship exists
between the variables; it is relatively easy, math-
ematically, to show that some correlation exists
between, say, the number of ice creams sold in a
given period of time and the number of chimneys
swept in the same period of time, although there
is no relationship between these variables;
(b)
that a linear relationship exists between the
variables; the product-moment formula given in
Section 62.2 is based on linear correlation. Perfect
non-linear correlation may exist (for example, the
co-ordinates exactly following the curve y =x 3),
but this gives a low value of coefﬁcient of cor-
relation since the value of r is determined using
the product-moment formula, based on a linear
relationship.

Chapter 63
Linear regression
Why it is important to understand: Linear regression
The general process of ﬁtting data to a linear combination of basic functions is termed linear regression.
Linear least squares regression is by far the most widely used modelling method; it is what most people
mean when they say they have used ‘regression’, ‘linear regression’ or ‘least squares’ to ﬁt a model to
their data. Not only is linear least squares regression the most widely used modelling method, but it has
been adapted to a broad range of situations that are outside its direct scope. It plays a strong underlying
role in many other modelling methods. This chapter explains how regression lines are determined.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
explain linear regression
•
understand least-squares regression lines
•
determine, for two variables X and Y, the equations of the regression lines of X on Y and Y on X
63.1
Introduction to linear regression
Regression analysis, usually termed regression, is used
to draw the line of ‘best ﬁt’ through co-ordinates on
a graph. The techniques used enable a mathemati-
cal equation of the straight line form y =mx +c to
be deduced for a given set of co-ordinate values, the
line being such that the sum of the deviations of
the co-ordinate values from the line is a minimum,
i.e. it is the line of ‘best ﬁt’. When a regression analy-
sis is made, it is possible to obtain two lines of best ﬁt,
depending on which variable is selected as the depen-
dent variable and which variable is the independent
variable. For example, in a resistive electrical circuit, the
current ﬂowing is directly proportional to the voltage
applied to the circuit. There are two ways of obtain-
ing experimentalvalues relating the current and voltage.
Either, certain voltages are applied to the circuit and the
current values are measured,in which case the voltage is
theindependentvariableandthecurrentisthedependent
variable; or, the voltage can be adjusted until a desired
value of current is ﬂowing and the value of voltage is
measured, in which case the current is the independent
value and the voltage is the dependent value.
63.2 The least-squares regression
lines
For a given set of co-ordinate values, (X1,Y1),
(X2,Y2),...,(Xn,Yn) let the X values be the indepen-
dent variables and the Y-valuesbe the dependentvalues.
AlsoletD1,...,Dn betheverticaldistancesbetweenthe
line shown as PQ in Fig. 63.1 and the points represent-
ing the co-ordinate values. The least-squares regression
line, i.e. the line of best ﬁt, is the line which makes the
value of D2
1 +D2
2 + ··· +D2
n a minimum value.
The equation of the least-squares regression line is
usually written as Y =a0+a1X, where a0 is the
y-axis intercept value and a1 is the gradient of the line
(analogous to c and m in the equation y =mx +c). The


(XY) = a0

(2)
where X and Y are the co-ordinate values, N is the
number of co-ordinates and a0 and a1 are called the
regression coefﬁcients of Y on X. Equations(1) and (2)
are called the normal equations of the regression lines
of Y on X. The regression line of Y on X is used to esti-
mate values of Y for given values of X. If the Y-values
(vertical axis) are selected as the independent variables,
the horizontal distances between the line shown as PQ
in Fig. 63.1 and the co-ordinate values (H3, H4, etc.)
are taken as the deviations. The equation of the regres-
sion line is of the form: X=b0+b1Y and the normal
equations become:

X = b0N + b1

Y
(3)

(XY) = b0

Y + b1

Y 2
(4)
where X and Y are the co-ordinate values, b0 and b1
are the regression coefﬁcients of X on Y and N is the
number of co-ordinates. These normal equations are of
the regression line of X on Y, which is slightly different
to the regression line of Y on X. The regression line of
X on Y is used to estimated values of X for given values
of Y. The regression line of Y on X is used to determine
any value of Y corresponding to a given value of X. If
the value of Y lies within the range of Y-values of the
extreme co-ordinates, the process of ﬁnding the corre-
sponding value of X is called linear interpolation. If
it lies outside of the range of Y-values of the extreme
co-ordinates then the process is called linear extrapo-
lation and the assumption must be made that the line of
best ﬁt extends outside of the range of the co-ordinate
values given.
By using the regression line of X on Y, values of X
corresponding to given values of Y may be found by
either interpolation or extrapolation.

Determine the equation of the regression line of

Since the regression line of inductive reactance on fre-
quency is required, the frequency is the independent
variable, X, and the inductive reactance is the depen-
dent variable, Y. The equation of the regression line of
Y on X is:
Y = a0 + a1X
and the regression coefﬁcients a0 and a1 are obtained
by using the normal equations
Y =a0N + a1

and XY=a0

The number of co-ordinate values given, N is 7.
Substituting in the normal equations gives:
855 = 7a0 + 1400a1
(1)
212 000 = 1400a0 + 350 000a1
(2)
1400×(1) gives:
1 197 000 = 9800a0 + 1 960 000a1
(3)
7×(2) gives:
1 484 000 = 9800a0 + 2 450 000a1
(4)
(4)−(3) gives:
287 000 = 0 + 490 000a1
from which, a1= 287 000
490 000 =0.586
Substituting a1=0.586 in equation (1) gives:
855 =7a0 + 1400(0.586)
i.e.
a0 = 855−820.4

=4.94
Thus the equation of the regression line of inductive
reactance on frequency is:
Y =4.94+0.586X
Problem 2.
For the data given in Problem 1,
determine the equation of the regression line of
frequency on inductive reactance, assuming a linear
relationship.
In this case, the inductive reactance is the independent
variable X and the frequency is the dependent vari-
able Y. From equations (3) and (4), the equation of the
regression line of X on Y is:
X = b0 + b1Y
and the normal equations are

X = b0N + b1

Y
and

XY = b0

Y + b1

From the table shown in Problem 1, the simultaneous
equations are:
1400 = 7b0 + 855b1
212 000 = 855b0 + 128 725b1
Solving these equations in a similar way to that in
Problem 1 gives:
b0 = −6.15
and b1 = 1.69, correct to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
Thus the equation of the regression line of frequency on
inductive reactance is:
X =−6.15+1.69Y
Problem 3.
Use the regression equations
calculated in Problems 1 and 2 to ﬁnd (a) the value
of inductive reactance when the frequency is 175Hz
and (b) the value of frequency when the inductive
reactance is 250ohms, assuming the line of best ﬁt
extends outside of the given co-ordinate values.

(a)
From Problem 1, the regressionequation of induc-
tive reactance on frequency is
Y=4.94+0.586X. When the frequency, X, is
175Hz, Y=4.94+0.586(175)=107.5, correct to
4 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, i.e. the inductive reactance is
107.5ohms when the frequency is 175Hz.
(b)
From Problem 2, the regression equation of fre-
quency on inductive reactance is
X=−6.15+1.69Y. When the inductive reac-
tance, Y, is 250ohms,
X=−6.15+1.69(250)=416.4Hz, correct to 4
signiﬁcant ﬁgures, i.e. the frequency is 416.4Hz
when the inductive reactance is 250ohms.
The graph depicting the two regression lines is shown
in Fig. 63.2. To obtain the regression line of induc-
tive reactance on frequency the regression line equation
Y=4.94+0.586X is used, and X (frequency) values of
100 and 300 have been selected in order to ﬁnd the cor-
responding Y values. These values gave the co-ordinates
as (100, 63.5) and (300, 180.7), shown as points A
and B in Fig. 63.2. Two co-ordinates for the regression
line of frequency on inductive reactance are calculated
using the equation X=−6.15+1.69Y, the values of
inductive reactance of 50 and 150 being used to obtain
the co-ordinate values. These values gave co-ordinates
(78.4, 50) and (247.4, 150), shown as points C and D
in Fig. 63.2.
It can be seen from Fig. 63.2 that to the scale drawn, the
two regression lines coincide. Although it is not nec-

Determine the equations of (a) the regression line of
force on radius and (b) the regression line of radius
on force. Hence, calculate the force at a radius of
40cm and the radius corresponding to a force of
32newtons.
Let the radius be the independent variable X, and the
force be the dependent variable Y. (This decision is
usually based on a ‘cause’ corresponding to X and an
‘effect’ corresponding to Y.)
(a)
The equation of the regression line of force on
radius is of the form Y=a0 +a1X and the con-
stants a0 and a1 are determined from the normal
equations:
Y = a0N + a1
X
and XY = a0
X + a1

(from equations (1) and (2))
Using a tabular approach to determine the values

Solving

equations
gives
a0 =33.7 and a1=−0.617, correct to 3 signiﬁ-
cant ﬁgures. Thus the equation of the regression
line of force on radius is:
Y =33.7−0.617X
(b)
The equation of the regression line of radius on
force is of the form X=b0 +b1Y and the con-
stants b0 and b1 are determined from the normal
equations:
X = b0N + b1
Y
and
XY = b0
Y + b1
Y 2
(from equations (3) and (4))
The values of the summations have been obtained
in part (a) giving:
145 = 8b0 + 180b1
and 2045 = 180b0 + 5100b1
Solving
these
simultaneous
equations
gives
b0 =44.2 and b1 =−1.16, correct to 3 signiﬁcant
ﬁgures. Thus the equation of the regression line of
radius on force is:
X =44.2−1.16Y
The force, Y, at a radius of 40cm, is obtained
from the regression line of force on radius, i.e.
y =33.7−0.617(40)=9.02,
i.e. the force at a radius of 40cm is 9.02N
The radius, X, when the force is 32newtons is
obtained from the regression line of radius on
force, i.e. X=44.2−1.16(32)=7.08,
i.e. the radius when the forceis 32N is 7.08cm.

Chapter 64
Sampling and estimation
theories
Why it is important to understand: Sampling and estimation theories
Estimation theory is a branch of statistics and signal processing that deals with estimating the values
of parameters based on measured/empirical data that has a random component. Estimation theory can
be found at the heart of many electronic signal processing systems designed to extract information;
these systems include radar, sonar, speech, image, communications, control and seismology. This chapter
introduces some of the principles involved with sampling and estimation theories.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand sampling distributions
•
determine the standard error of the means
•
understand point and interval estimates and conﬁdence intervals
•
calculate conﬁdence limits
•
estimate the mean and standard deviation of a population from sample data
•
estimate the mean of a population based on a small sample data using a Student’s t distribution

Introduction
The concepts of elementary sampling theory and esti-
mation theories introduced in this chapter will provide
the basis for a more detailed study of inspection, con-
trolandqualitycontroltechniquesusedinindustry.Such
theories can be quite complicated; in this chapter a full
treatment of the theories and the derivation of formulae
have been omitted for clarity – basic concepts only have
been developed.
64.2
Sampling distributions
In statistics, it is not always possible to take into account
all the members of a set and in these circumstances, a
sample, or many samples, are drawn from a population.
Usually when the word sample is used, it means that a
random sample is taken. If each member of a popula-
tionhasthesamechanceofbeingselected,thenasample
taken from that population is called random. A sample
which is not randomis said to be biased and this usually
occurs when some inﬂuence affects the selection.
When it is necessary to make predictions about a popu-
lation based on random sampling, often many samples
of, say, N members are taken, before the predictions are
made. If the mean value and standard deviation of each
of the samples is calculated, it is found that the results
vary from sample to sample, even though the samples
are all taken from the same population. In the theories
introduced in the following sections, it is important to

know whether the differences in the values obtained are
due to chance or whether the differences obtained are
related in some way. If M samples of N members are
drawn at random from a population, the mean values for
the M samples together form a set of data. Similarly, the
standard deviations of the M samples collectively form
a set of data. Sets of data based on many samples drawn
from a population are called sampling distributions.
They are often used to describe the chance ﬂuctuations
ofmeanvaluesandstandarddeviationsbasedonrandom
sampling.
64.3
The sampling distribution of the
means
Suppose that it is required to obtain a sample of two
items from a set containing ﬁve items. If the set is the
ﬁve letters A, B, C, D and E, then the different samples
which are possible are:
AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE,
CD, CE and DE,
that is, ten different samples. The number of possible
different samples in this case is given by 5 × 4
2 × 1 i.e.
10. Similarly, the number of different ways in which
a sample of three items can be drawn from a set having
ten members can be shown to be 10 × 9 × 8
3 × 2 × 1 i.e. 120.
It follows that when a small sample is drawn from a
large population, there are very many different combi-
nations of members possible. With so many different
samples possible, quite a large variation can occur in
the mean values of various samples taken from the same
population.
Usually, the greater the number of members in a sample,
the closer will be the mean value of the sample to that
of the population. Consider the set of numbers 3, 4, 5,
6, and 7. For a sample of two members, the lowest value
of the mean is 3 + 4
2
, i.e. 3.5; the highest is 6 + 7
2
, i.e.
6.5, giving a range of mean values of 6.5 −3.5 = 3.
For a sample of three members, the range is 3 + 4 + 5
3
to 5 + 6 + 7
3
that is, 2. As the number in the sample
increases, the range decreases until, in the limit, if the
sample contains all the members of the set, the range
of mean values is zero. When many samples are drawn
from a population and a sample distribution of the mean
values of the sample is formed, the range of the mean
values is small provided the number in the sample is
large. Because the range is small it follows that the stan-
dard deviation of all the mean values will also be small,
since it depends on the distance of the mean values
from the distribution mean. The relationship between
the standard deviation of the mean values of a sam-
pling distribution and the number in each sample can be
expressed as follows:
Theorem 1 ‘If all possible samples of size N are drawn
from a ﬁnite population, Np, without replacement, and the
standard deviation of the mean values of the sam- pling
distribution of means is determined then:
σx =
σ
√
N
Np −N
Np −1

where σx is the standard deviation of the sampling dis-
tribution of means and σ is the standard deviation of the
population.’
The standard deviation of a sampling distribution of
mean values is called the standard error of the means,
thus standard error of the means,
σx = σ
√
N
Np −N
Np −1

(1)
Equation (1) is used for a ﬁnite population of size Np
and/or for sampling without replacement. The word
error in the ‘standard error of the means’ does not mean
that a mistake has been made but rather that there is a
degree of uncertainty in predicting the mean value of
a population based on the mean values of the samples.
The formula for the standard error of the means is true
for all values of the number in the sample, N. When Np
is very large compared with N or when the population
is inﬁnite (this can be considered to be the case when
sampling is done with replacement, the correction factor
 Np−N

approaches unit and equation (1) becomes
σx = σ
√
N
(2)
Equation (2) is used for an inﬁnite population and/or for
sampling with replacement.

In Problem 1 above, it can be seen that the mean of the
population,
3 + 4+ 5 + 6 + 7
5

is 5 and also that the mean of thesamplingdistributionof
means, μx is 5. This result is generalised in Theorem 2.
Theorem 2 ‘If all possible samples of size N are drawn
from a population of size Np and the mean value of the
sampling distribution of means μx is determined then
μx = μ
(3)
where μ is the mean value of the population’.
In practice, all possible samples of size N are not drawn
from the population. However, if the sample size is
large (usually taken as 30 or more), then the relation-
ship between the mean of the sampling distribution of
means and the mean of the population is very near to
that shown in equation (3). Similarly, the relationship
between the standard error of the means and thestandard
deviation of the population is very near to that shown
in equation (2). Another important property of a sam-
pling distribution is that when the sample size, N, is
large, the sampling distribution of means approxi-
mates to a normal distribution, of mean value μx and
standard deviation σx. This is true for all normally dis-
tributed populations and also for populations which are
not normally distributed provided the population size is
at least twice as large as the sample size. This property
of normality of a sampling distribution is based on a
special case of the ‘ central limit theorem’, an important
theorem relating to sampling theory. Because the sam-
pling distribution of means and standard deviations is
normally distributed, the table of the partial areas under
the standardised normal curve (shown in Table 61.1 on
page 661) can be used to determine the probabilities
of a particular sample lying between, say, ±1 stan-
dard deviation, and so on. This point is expanded in
Problem 3.
Problem 2.
The heights of 3000 people are
normally distributed with a mean of 175 cm and a
standard deviation of 8 cm. If random samples are
taken of 40 people, predict the standard deviation
and the mean of the sampling distribution of means
if sampling is done (a) with replacement, and
(b) without replacement.
For the population: number of members, Np = 3000
standard deviation, σ = 8 cm; mean, μ = 175 cm.
For the samples: number in each sample, N = 40
(a)
When sampling is done with replacement, the
total number of possible samples (two or more
can be the same) is inﬁnite. Hence, from equa-
tion (2) the standard error of the mean (i.e. the

From equation (3), the mean of the sampling

sample size is large, the mean of the sampling dis-
tribution of means is the same for both ﬁnite and
inﬁnite populations. Hence, from equation (3),
μx = 175 cm
Problem 3.
1500 ingots of a metal have a mean
mass of 6.5 kg and a standard deviation of 0.5 kg.
Find the probability that a sample of 60 ingots
chosen at random from the group, without
replacement, will have a combined mass of (a)
between 378 and 396 kg, and (b) more than 399 kg.
For the population: numbers of members, Np = 1500;
standard deviation, σ = 0.5 kg; mean μ = 6.5 kg
For the sample: number in sample, N = 60
If many samples of 60 ingots had been drawn from the
group, then the mean of the sampling distribution of

Also, the standard error of means is given by

In addition, the sample distribution would have been

and 396 kg, then the mean mass of each of the 60
ingots lies between 378
60 and 396
60 kg, i.e. between
6.3 kg and 6.6 kg.
Since the masses are normally distributed, it is
possible to use the techniques of the normal dis-
tribution to determine the probability of the mean
mass lying between 6.3 and 6.6 kg. The normal
standard variate value, z, is given by
z = x −x
σ
hence for the sampling distribution of means, this
becomes,
z = x −μx
σx
Thus,
6.3kg
corresponds
to
a
z-value
of
6.3 −6.5
0.0633 = −3.16 standard deviations.
Similarly, 6.6kg corresponds to a z-value of
6.6 −6.5
0.0633 = 1.58 standard deviations.
Using Table 61.1 (page 661), the areas corre-
spondingto these values of standard deviationsare
0.4992 and 0.4430respectively.Hence the proba-
bility of the mean mass lying between 6.3 kg and
6.6kg is 0.4992+ 0.4430 = 0.9422. (This means
that if 10 000 samples are drawn, 9422 of these
samples will have a combined mass of between
378 and 396kg.)
(b)
If the combined mass of 60 ingots is 399 kg, the
mean mass of each ingot is 399
60 , that is, 6.65 kg.
The z-value for 6.65 kg is 6.65 −6.5
0.0633
, i.e. 2.37
standard deviations. From Table 61.1 (page 661),
the area corresponding to this z-value is 0.4911.
But this is the area between the ordinate z = 0 and
ordinate z = 2.37. The ‘more than’ value required

is the total area to the right of the z = 0 ordinate,
less the value between z = 0 and z = 2.37, i.e.
0.5000 −0.4911. Thus, since areas are propor-
tional to probabilities for the standardised normal
curve, the probability of the mean mass being
morethan6.65kg is0.5000−0.4911,i.e.0.0089.
(This means that only 89 samples in 10 000, for
example, will have a combined mass exceeding
399 kg.)

64.4
The estimation of population
parameters based on a large
sample size
When a population is large, it is not practical to deter-
mine its mean and standard deviation by using the basic
formulae for these parameters. In fact, when a popula-
tion is inﬁnite, it is impossible to determine these values.
For large and inﬁnite populations the values of the mean
and standard deviation may be estimated by using the
data obtained from samples drawn from the population.
Point and interval estimates
An estimate of a population parameter, such as mean or
standard deviation, based on a single number is called
a point estimate. An estimate of a population parame-
ter given by two numbers between which the parameter
may be considered to lie is called an interval estimate.
Thus if an estimate is made of the length of an object
and the result is quoted as 150 cm, this is a point esti-
mate. If the result is quoted as 150 ± 10 cm, this is
an interval estimate and indicates that the length lies
between 140 and 160 cm. Generally, a point estimate
does not indicate how close the value is to the true value
of the quantity and should be accompanied byadditional
information on which its merits may be judged. A state-
ment of the error or the precision of an estimate is often
called its reliability. In statistics, when estimates are
made of population parameters based on samples, usu-
ally interval estimates are used. The word estimate does
not suggest that we adopt the approach ‘let’s guess that
the mean value is about...’ but rather that a value is
carefully selected and the degree of conﬁdence which
can be placed in the estimate is given in addition.

Conﬁdence intervals
It is stated in Section 64.3 that when samples are taken
from a population, the mean values of these samples are
approximately normally distributed, that is, the mean
values forming the sampling distribution of means is
approximately normally distributed. It is also true that
if the standard deviations of each of the samples is
found, then the standard deviations of all the sam-
ples are approximately normally distributed, that is, the
standard deviations of the sampling distribution of stan-
dard deviations are approximately normally distributed.
Parameters such as the mean or the standard deviation of
a sampling distribution are called sampling statistics,
S. Let μs be the mean value of a sampling statistic of
the sampling distribution, that is, the mean value of the
means of the samples or the mean value of the standard
deviations of the samples. Also let σs be the standard
deviation of a sampling statistic of the sampling distri-
bution, that is, the standard deviationof the means of the
samples or the standard deviation of the standard devia-
tions of the samples. Because the sampling distribution
of the means and of the standarddeviationsare normally
distributed, it is possible to predict the probability of the
sampling statistic lying in the intervals:
mean ±1 standard deviation,
mean ±2 standard deviations,
or mean ±3 standard deviations,
byusingtablesofthepartialareasunderthestandardised
normal curve given in Table 61.1 on page 661. from this
table, the area corresponding to a z-value of +1 standard
deviation is 0.3413, thus the area corresponding to ±1
standard deviation is 2 × 0.3413, that is, 0.6826. Thus
the percentage probability of a sampling statistic lying
between the mean ±1 standard deviation is 68.26%.
Similarly, the probability of a sampling statistic lying
between the mean ±2 standard deviations is 95.44%
and of lying between the mean ±3 standard deviations
is 99.74%
The values 68.26%, 95.44% and 99.74% are called
the conﬁdence levels for estimating a sampling statis-
tic. A conﬁdence level of 68.26% is associated with
two distinct values, these being S – (1 standard devi-
ation), i.e. S −σs and S+(1 standard deviation), i.e.
S + σs. These two values are called the conﬁdence
limits of the estimate and the distance between the
conﬁdence limits is called the conﬁdence interval. A
conﬁdence interval indicates the expectation or conﬁ-
dence of ﬁnding an estimate of the population statistic
in that interval, based on a sampling statistic. The list in
Table 64.1 is based on values given in Table 61.1, and
gives some of the conﬁdence levels used in practice and
their associated z-values (some of the values given are
based on interpolation). When the table is used in this
context, z-values are usually indicated by ‘ zc’ and are
called the conﬁdence coefﬁcients.

Problem 4.
Determine the conﬁdence coefﬁcient
corresponding to a conﬁdence level of 98.5%
98.5% is equivalent to a per unit value of 0.9850. This
indicates that the area under the standardised normal
curve between −zc and +zc, i.e. corresponding to 2zc,
is 0.9850 of the total area. Hence the area between the
mean value and zc is 0.9850
2
i.e. 0.4925of the total area.
The z-value corresponding to a partial area of 0.4925
is 2.43 standard deviations from Table 61.1. Thus, the
conﬁdence coefﬁcient corresponding to a conﬁdence
limit of 98.5% is 2.43
(a) Estimating the mean of a population when the
standard deviation of the population is known
When a sample is drawn from a large population
whose standard deviation is known, the mean value of
the sample, x, can be determined. This mean value can
be used to make an estimate of the mean value of the
population, μ. When this is done, the estimated mean
value of the population is given as lying between two
values, that is, lying in the conﬁdence interval between
the conﬁdence limits. If a high level of conﬁdence is
required in the estimated value of μ, then the range of
the conﬁdence interval will be large. For example, if the

Section K

684
Higher Engineering Mathematics
required conﬁdence level is 96%, then from Table 64.1
the conﬁdence interval is from −zc to +zc, that is,
2 × 2.05 = 4.10 standard deviations wide. Conversely,
a low level of conﬁdence has a narrow conﬁdence inter-
val and a conﬁdence level of, say, 50%, has a conﬁdence
interval of 2 × 0.6745, that is 1.3490 standard devia-
tions. The 68.26% conﬁdence level for an estimate of
the populationmean is given by estimating that the pop-
ulation mean, μ, is equal to the same mean, x, and then
stating the conﬁdence interval of the estimate. Since the
68.26% conﬁdence level is associatedwith ‘±1standard
deviation of the means of the sampling distribution’,
then the 68.26% conﬁdence level for the estimate of the
population mean is given by:
x ± 1σ x
In general, any particular conﬁdence level can be
obtained in the estimate by using x ± zcσx, where zc is
the conﬁdence coefﬁcient corresponding to the particu-
lar conﬁdence level required. Thus for a 96% conﬁdence
level, the conﬁdence limits of the population mean are
given by x ± 2.05σx. Since only one sample has been
drawn, the standard error of the means, σx, is not known.
However, it is shown in Section 64.3 that
σx =

Problem 5.
It is found that the standard deviation
of the diameters of rivets produced by a certain
machine over a long period of time is 0.018 cm.
The diameters of a random sample of 100 rivets
produced by this machine in a day have a mean
value of 0.476 cm. If the machine produces 2500
rivets a day, determine (a) the 90% conﬁdence
limits, and (b) the 97% conﬁdence limits for an
estimate of the mean diameter of all the rivets
produced by the machine in a day.
For the population:
standard deviation, σ = 0.018 cm
number in the population, Np = 2500
For the sample:
number in the sample, N = 100
mean, x = 0.476 cm

Thus, the 90% conﬁdence limits are 0.473 cm
and 0.479 cm.
This indicates that if the mean diameter of a sam-
ple of 100 rivets is 0.476 cm, then it is predicted
that the mean diameter of all the rivets will be
between 0.476 cm and 0.479 cm and this predic-
tion is made with conﬁdence that it will be correct
nine times out of ten.

For a 97% conﬁdence level, the value of zc has to
be determined from a table of partial areas under
the standardised normal curve given in Table 61.1,

It can be seen that the higher value of conﬁ-
dence level required in part (b) results in a larger
conﬁdence interval.
Problem 6.
The mean diameter of a long length
of wire is to be determined. The diameter of the
wire is measured in 25 places selected at random
throughout its length and the mean of these values
is 0.425 mm. If the standard deviation of the
diameter of the wire is given by the manufacturers
as 0.030 mm, determine (a) the 80% conﬁdence
interval of the estimated mean diameter of the wire,
and (b) with what degree of conﬁdence it can be
said that ‘the mean diameter is 0.425 ± 0.012 mm’.
For the population: σ = 0.030 mm
For the sample: N = 25,x = 0.425 mm
Since an inﬁnite number of measurements can be
obtained for the diameter of the wire, the population is
inﬁnite and the estimated value of the conﬁdence inter-
val of the populationmean is given by expression(5).

For an 80% conﬁdence level, the value of zc is

This indicates that the estimated mean diameter of
the wire is between 0.417 mm and 0.433 mm and
that this prediction is likely to be correct 80 times
out of 100

between the mean value (zc = 0) and +2 standard
deviations.Because the standardisednormal curve
is symmetrical, the area between the mean and ±2
standard deviations is
0.4772× 2, i.e. 0.9544
Thus the conﬁdence level corresponding to
0.425± 0.012 mm is 95.44%
(b) Estimating the mean and standard deviation of a
population from sample data
The standard deviation of a large population is not
known and, in this case, several samples are drawn from
the population. The mean of the sampling distribution
of means, μx and the standard deviation of the sam-
pling distribution of means (i.e. the standard error of the
means), σx, may be determined. The conﬁdence limits
of the mean value of the population, μ, are given by
μx ± zcσ x
(6)
where zc is the conﬁdence coefﬁcient corresponding to
the conﬁdence level required.
To make an estimate of the standard deviation, σ, of a
normally distributed population:
(i)
a sampling distribution of the standard deviations
of the samples is formed, and
(ii)
the standard deviation of the sampling distribution
isdeterminedbyusingthebasicstandarddeviation
formula.
This standard deviation is called the standard error of the
standard deviations and is usually signiﬁed by σs. If s is

the standard deviation of a sample, then the conﬁdence
limits of the standard deviation of the population are
given by:
s ± zcσ s
(7)
where zc is the conﬁdence coefﬁcient corresponding to
the required conﬁdence level.
Problem 7.
Several samples of 50 fuses selected
at random from a large batch are tested when
operating at a 10% overload current and the mean
time of the sampling distribution before the fuses
failed is 16.50 minutes. The standard error of the
means is 1.4 minutes. Determine the estimated
mean time to failure of the batch of fuses for a
conﬁdence level of 90%
For the sampling distribution: the mean, μx = 16.50,
the standard error of the means, σx = 1.4
The estimated mean of the population is based on sam-
pling distribution data only and so expression (6) is used
i.e. the conﬁdence limits of the estimated mean of the
population are μx ± zcσx
For
a
90%
conﬁdence
level,
zc = 1.645
(from
Table 64.1), thus,
μx ± zcσx = 16.50± (1.645)(1.4)
= 16.50± 2.30m.
Thus, the 90% conﬁdence level of the mean time to
failure is from 14.20 minutes to 18.80 minutes.
Problem 8.
The sampling distribution of random
samples of capacitors drawn from a large batch is
found to have a standard error of the standard
deviations of 0.12 μF. Determine the 92%
conﬁdence interval for the estimate of the standard
deviation of the whole batch, if in a particular
sample, the standard deviation is 0.60 μF. It can be
assumed that the values of capacitance of the batch
are normally distributed.
For the sample: the standard deviation, s = 0.60μF.
For the sampling distribution: the standard error of the
standard deviations,
σs = 0.12μF
When the conﬁdence level is 92%, then by using
Table 58.1 of partial areas order the standardisednormal
curve,
area = 0.9200
2
= 0.4600,
giving zc as ±1.751 standard deviations (by interpola-
tion).
Since the population is normally distributed, the con-
ﬁdence limits of the standard deviation of the popu-
lation may be estimated by using expression (7), i.e.
s ± zcσs = 0.60 ± (1.751)(0.12) = 0.60 ± 0.21μF.
Thus, the 92% conﬁdence interval for the estimate of
the standard deviation for the batch is from 0.39 μF
to 0.81 μF.

64.5
Estimating the mean of a
population based on a small
sample size
The methods used in Section 64.4 to estimate the popu-
lation mean and standard deviation rely on a relatively
large sample size, usually taken as 30 or more. This
is because when the sample size is large the sampling
distribution of a parameter is approximately normally
distributed. When the sample size is small, usually taken
as less than 30, the techniques used for estimating the
population parameters in Section 64.4 become more and
more inaccurate as the sample size becomes smaller,
since the sampling distribution no longer approximates
to a normal distribution. Investigations were carried out
into the effect of small sample sizes on the estimation
theory by W. S. Gosset in the early twentieth century
and, as a result of his work, tables are available which
enable a realistic estimate to be made when sample sizes
are small. In these tables, the t-value is determined from
the relationship
t = (x −μ)
s

(N −1)
where x is the mean value of a sample, μ is the mean
value of the populationfrom which the sample is drawn,
s is the standard deviation of the sample and N is the
number of independent observations in the sample. He
published his ﬁndings under the pen name of ‘Student’,
and these tables are often referred to as the ‘Student’s
t distribution’.
The conﬁdence limits of the mean value of a popula-
tion based on a small sample drawn at random from the
population are given by
x ±
tcs
√(N −1)
(8)
In this estimate, tc is called the conﬁdence coefﬁcient
for small samples, analogous to zc for large samples, s
is the standard deviation of the sample, x is the mean
value of the sample and N is the number of members
in the sample. Table 64.2 is called ‘percentile values
for Student’s t distribution. The columns are headed t p
where p is equal to 0.995, 0.99, 0.975, ···, 0.55. For a
conﬁdence level of, say, 95%, the column headed t 0.95 is
selected and so on. The rows are headed with the Greek
letter ‘nu’, v, and are numbered from 1 to 30 in steps
of 1, together with the numbers 40, 60, 120 and ∞.
These numbers represent a quantity called the degrees
of freedom, which is deﬁned as follows:
‘The sample number, N, minus the number of popu-
lation parameters which must be estimated for the
sample.’
When determining the t-value, given by
t = (x −μ)
s

(N −1)
it is necessary to know the sample parameters x and s
and the population parameter μ. x and s can be calcu-
lated for the sample, but usually an estimate has to be
made of the population mean μ, based on the sample
mean value. The number of degrees of freedom, v, is
given by the number of independent observations in the
sample, N, minus the number of population parameters
which have to be estimated, k, i.e. v = N −k. For the
equation
t = (x −μ)
s

(N −1)
only μ has to be estimated, hence k = 1, and v = N −1.
When determining the mean of a population based on
a small sample size, only one population parameter
is to be estimated, and hence v can always be taken
as (N −1) . The method used to estimate the mean
of a population based on a small sample is shown in
Problems 9 to 11.
Problem 9.
A sample of 12 measurements of the
diameter of a bar are made and the mean of the
sample is 1.850 cm. The standard deviation of the
sample is 0.16 mm. Determine (a) the 90%
conﬁdence limits and (b) the 70% conﬁdence limits
for an estimate of the actual diameter of the bar.

For the sample: the sample size, N = 12; mean, x =
1.850 cm; standard deviation s = 0.16 mm = 0.016 cm.
Since the sample number is less than 30, the small sam-
ple estimate as given in expression (8) must be used. The
number of degrees of freedom, i.e. sample size minus
the number of estimations of population parameters to
be made, is 12 −1, i.e. 11
(a)
Thepercentilevaluecorrespondingtoaconﬁdence
coefﬁcient value of t0.90 and a degree of freedom
value of v = 11 can be found by using Table 64.2,
and is 1.36, that is, tc = 1.36. The estimated value
of the mean of the population is given by
x ±
tcs
√(N −1) = 1.850 ± (1.36)(0.016)
√
11
= 1.850 ± 0.0066cm
Thus, the 90% conﬁdence limits are 1.843 cm
and 1.857 cm.
This indicates that the actual diameter is likely to
lie between 1.843 cm and 1.857 cm and that this
prediction stands a 90% chance of being correct.
(b)
The percentile value corresponding to t0.70 and to
v = 11 is obtained from Table 64.2, and is 0.540,
that is, tc = 0.540
The estimated value of the 70% conﬁdence limits
is given by:
x ±
tcs
√(N −1) = 1.850± (0.540)(0.016)
√
11
= 1.850± 0.0026cm
Thus, the 70% conﬁdence limits are 1.847 cm
and 1.850 cm, i.e. the actual diameter of the bar
is between 1.847 cm and 1.850 cm and this result
has a 70% probability of being correct.
Problem 10.
A sample of nine electric lamps are
selected randomly from a large batch and are tested
until they fail. The mean and standard deviations of
the time to failure are 1210 hours and 26 hours
respectively. Determine the conﬁdence level based
on an estimated failure time of 1210± 6.5 hours.
For the sample: sample size, N = 9; standard deviation,
s = 26 hours; mean, x = 1210 hours. The conﬁdence
limits are given by:
x ±
tcs
√(N −1)
and these are equal to 1210 ± 6.5
Since x = 1210 hours,
then
±
tcs
√(N −1) = ±6.5
i.e.
tc = ± 6.5√(N−1)
s
= ±(6.5)
√
8
26
= ±0.707
From Table 64.2, a tc value of 0.707, having a v value
of N −1, i.e. 8, gives a tp value of t0.75
Hence, the conﬁdence level of an estimated failure
time of 1210± 6.5 hours is 75%, i.e. it is likely that
75% of all of the lamps will fail between 1203.5 and
1216.5 hours.

Determine the 95% conﬁdence interval for the true
speciﬁc resistance of the wire.
For the sample: sample size, N = 6, and mean,

Chapter 65
Signiﬁcance testing
Why it is important to understand: Signiﬁcance testing
In statistical testing, a result is called statistically signiﬁcant if it is unlikely to have occurred by chance,
and hence provides enough evidence to reject the hypothesis of ‘no effect’. The tests involve comparing
the observed values with theoretical values. The tests establish whether there is a relationship between
the variables, or whether pure chance could produce the observed results. For most scientiﬁc research, a
statistical signiﬁcance test eliminates the possibility that the results arose by chance, allowing a rejection
of the null hypothesis. This chapter introduces the principles of signiﬁcance testing.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand hypotheses
•
appreciate type I and type II errors
•
calculate type I and type II errors using binomial and Poisson approximations
•
appreciate signiﬁcance tests for population means
•
determine hypotheses using signiﬁcance testing
•
compare two sample means given a level of signiﬁcance
65.1
Hypotheses
Industrial applications of statistics is often concerned
with making decisions about populations and popula-
tion parameters. For example, decisions about which
is the better of two processes or decisions about
whether to discontinue production on a particular
machine because it is producing an economically unac-
ceptable number of defective components are often
based on deciding the mean or standard deviation
of a population, calculated using sample data drawn
from the population. In reaching these decisions, cer-
tain assumptions are made, which may or may not
be true. The assumptions made are called statistical
hypotheses or just hypotheses and are usually con-
cernedwithstatementsaboutprobabilitydistributionsof
populations.
For example, in order to decide whether a dice is fair,
that is, unbiased, a hypothesis can be made that a par-
ticular number, say 5, should occur with a probability
of one in six, since there are six numbers on a dice.
Such a hypothesis is called a null hypothesis and is an
initial statement. The symbol H0 is used to indicate a
null hypothesis. Thus, if p is the probability of throw-
ing a 5, then H0 : p = 1
6 means, ‘the null hypothesis
that the probability of throwing a 5 is 1
6’. Any hypoth-
esis which differs from a given hypothesis is called an
alternative hypothesis, and is indicated by the symbol
H1. Thus, if after many trials, it is found that the dice is
biased and that a 5 only occurs, on average, one in every
seven throws, then several alternative hypotheses may
be formulated. For example: H1:p = 1
7 or H1:p < 1
6
or H1:p > 1
8 or H1:p ̸= 1
6 are all possible alternative
hypotheses to the null hypothesis that p = 1

Hypotheses may also be used when comparisons are
being made. If we wish to compare, say, the strength of
two metals, a null hypothesis may be formulated that
there is no difference between the strengths of the two
metals. If the forces that the two metals can withstand
are F1 and F2, then the null hypothesis is H0 : F1 = F2.
If it is found that the null hypothesis has to be rejected,
that is, that the strengths of the two metals are not the
same, then the alternative hypotheses could be ofseveral
forms. For example, H1 : F1 > F2 or H1 : F2 > F1 or
H1 : F1 ̸= F2. These are all alternative hypotheses to
the original null hypothesis.
65.2
Type I and type II errors
To illustrate what is meant by type I and type II errors,
let us consider an automatic machine producing, say,
small bolts. These are stamped out of a length of metal
and various faults may occur. For example, the heads
or the threads may be incorrectly formed, the length
might be incorrect, and so on. Assume that, say, three
bolts out of every 100 produced are defective in some
way. If a sample of 200 bolts is drawn at random, then
the manufacturer might be satisﬁed that his defect rate
is still 3% provided there are six defective bolts in the
sample. Also, the manufacturer might be satisﬁed that
his defect rate is 3% or less provided that there are six
or fewer bolts defective in the sample. He might then
formulate the following hypotheses:
H0 : p = 0.03 (the null hypothesis that
the defect rate is 3%)
The null hypothesis indicates that a 3% defect rate is
acceptable to the manufacturer. Suppose that he also
makes a decision that should the defect rate rise to 5%
or more, he will take some action. Then the alternative
hypothesis is:
H1 : p ≥0.05 (the alternative hypothesis that
the defect rate is equal to or
greater than 5%)
The manufacturer’sdecisions, which are related to these
hypotheses, might well be:
(i)
a null hypothesis that a 3% defect rate is accept-
able, on the assumption that the associated number
of defective bolts is insufﬁcient to endanger his
ﬁrm’s good name;
(ii)
if the null hypothesis is rejected and the defect rate
rises to 5% or over, stop the machine and adjust or
renew parts as necessary; since the machine is not
then producing bolts, this will reduce his proﬁt.
These decisions may seem logical at ﬁrst sight, but by
applying the statistical concepts introduced in previous
chapters it can be shown that the manufacturer is not
necessarily making very sound decisions. This is shown
as follows.
When drawing a random sample of 200 bolts from
the machine with a defect rate of 3%, by the laws
of probability, some samples will contain no defective
bolts, some samples will contain one defective bolt, and
so on.
A binomial distribution can be used to determine the
probabilities of getting 0,1,2,...,9 defective bolts in
the sample. Thus the probability of getting ten or more
defective bolts in a sample, even with a 3% defect
rate, is given by: 1−(the sum of probabilities of getting
0,1,2,...,9 defective bolts). This is an extremely large
calculation, given by:
1−

0.97200 + 200× 0.97199 × 0.03
+200 × 199
2
× 0.97198 × 0.032 to 10 terms

An alternative way of calculating the required probabil-
ity is to use the normal approximation to the binomial
distribution. This may be stated as follows:
‘If the probability of a defective item is p and a non-
defective item is q, then if a sample of N items is
drawn at random from a large population, provided
both Np and Nq are greater than 5, the binomial
distribution approximates to a normal distribution
of mean Np and standard deviation

(Npq).’
The defect rate is 3%, thus p = 0.03. Since q = 1 −p,
q = 0.97. Sample size N = 200. Since Np and Nq are
greater than 5, a normal approximation to the binomial
distribution can be used.
The mean of the normal distribution,
x = Np = 200 × 0.03 = 6
The standard deviation of the normal distribution
σ =

(Npq)
=

[(200)(0.03)(0.97)] = 2.41
The normal standard variate for ten bolts is
z =
variate −mean
standard deviation
= 10 −6
2.41 = 1.66
Table 61.1 on page 661 is used to determine the area
between the mean and a z-value of 1.66, and is 0.4515

Section K
Signiﬁcance testing
693
The probability of having ten or more defective bolts
is the total area under the standardised normal curve
minus the area to the left of the z = 1.66 ordinate, i.e.
1−(0.5+0.4515),i.e. 1 −0.9515 = 0.0485 ≈5%. Thus
the probability of getting ten or more defective bolts in a
sample of 200 bolts, even though the defect rate is still
3%, is 5%. It follows that as a result of the manufac-
turer’s decisions, for ﬁve times in every 100 the number
of defects in the sample will exceed ten, the alterna-
tive hypothesis will be adopted and the machine will
be stopped (and proﬁt lost) unnecessarily. In general
terms:
‘A hypothesis has been rejected when it should
have been accepted.’
When this occurs, it is called a type I error, and, in this
example, the type I error is 5%
Assume now that the defect rate has risen to 5%, i.e.
the expectancy of a defective bolt is now ten. A sec-
ond error resulting from this decision occurs due to the
probability of getting fewer than ten defective bolts in a
random sample, even though the defect rate has risen to
5%. Using the normal approximation to a binomial dis-
tribution: N = 200, p = 0.05,q = 0.95. Np and Nq are
greater than 5, hence a normal approximation to a bino-
mial distribution is a satisfactory method. The normal
distribution has:
mean, x = Np = (200)(0.05) = 10
standard deviation,
σ =

(Npq)
=

[(200)(0.05)(0.95)] = 3.08
The normal standard variate for nine defective bolts,
z =
variate −mean
standard deviation
= 9 −10
3.08 = −0.32
Using Table 61.1 of partial areas under the standardised
normal curve given on page 661, a z-value of −0.32
corresponds to an area between the mean and the ordi-
nate at z = −0.32 to 0.1255. Thus, the probability of
there being nine or fewer defective bolts in the sample
is given by the area to the left of the z = 0.32 ordinate,
i.e. 0.5000−0.1255,that is, 0.3745.Thus, the probabil-
ity of getting nine or fewer defective bolts in a sample
of 200 bolts, even though the defect rate has risen
to 5%, is 37%. It follows that as a result of the man-
ufacturer’s decisions, for 37 samples in every 100, the
machine will be left running even though the defect rate
has risen to 5%. In general terms:
‘A hypothesis has been accepted when it should
have been rejected.’
When this occurs, it is called a type II error, and, in
this example, the type II error is 37%
Tests of hypotheses and rules of decisions should be
designed to minimise the errors of decision. This is
achieved largely by trial and error for a particular set of
circumstances. Type I errors can be reduced by increas-
ing the numberof defective items allowable in a sample,
but this is at the expense of allowing a larger percentage
of defective items to leave the factory, increasing the
criticism from customers. Type II errors can be reduced
byincreasingthepercentagedefectrateinthealternative
hypothesis. If a higher percentage defect rate is given in
the alternative hypothesis, the type II errors are reduced
very effectively,as shownin the second of the two tables
below, relating the decision rule to the magnitude of the
type II errors. Some examples of the magnitudeof type I
errors are givenbelow,for a sample of 1000components

The magnitude of the type II errors for the output of the
same machine, again based on a random sample of 1000
components and a mean defect rate of 5%, is given on
page 693.
When testing a hypothesis, the largest value of proba-
bility which is acceptable for a type I error is called the
level of signiﬁcanceof the test. The level of signiﬁcance
is indicated by the symbol α (alpha) and the levels com-
monly adopted are 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, 0.005 and 0.002. A
level of signiﬁcance of, say, 0.05 means that ﬁve times
in 100 the hypothesis has been rejected when it should
have been accepted.
In signiﬁcance tests, the following terminology is fre-
quently adopted:
(i)
if the level of signiﬁcance is 0.01 or less, i.e. the
conﬁdence level is 99% or more, the results are
consideredtobe highlysigniﬁcant,i.e.theresults
are considered likely to be correct,
(ii)
if the level of signiﬁcance is 0.05 or between
0.05 and 0.01, i.e. the conﬁdence level is 95%
or between 95% and 99%, the results are consid-
ered to be probably signiﬁcant, i.e. the results
are probably correct,
(iii)
if the level of signiﬁcance is greater than 0.05, i.e.
the conﬁdence level is less than 95%, the results
are considered to be not signiﬁcant, that is, there
are doubts about the correctness of the results
obtained.
This terminology indicates that the use of a level of sig-
niﬁcance of 0.05 for ‘probablysigniﬁcant’ is, in effect, a
rule of thumb. Situations can arise when the probability
changes with the nature of the test being done and the
use being made of the results.
The example of a machine producing bolts, used to illus-
trate type I and type II errors, is based on a single random
sample being drawn from the output of the machine. In
practice, sampling is a continuous process and using
the data obtained from several samples, sampling dis-
tributions are formed. From the concepts introduced
in Chapter 64, the means and standard deviations of
samples are normally distributed, thus for a particular
sample its mean and standard deviation are part of a
normal distribution. For a set of results to be proba-
bly signiﬁcant a conﬁdence level of 95% is required
for a particular hypothesis being probably correct. This
is equivalent to the hypothesis being rejected when the
level of signiﬁcance is greater than 0.05. For this to
occur, the z-value of the mean of the samples will lie
between −1.96 and +1.96 (since the area under the
standardised normal distribution curve between these

z-values is 95%). The shaded area in Fig. 65.1 is based
on results which are probably signiﬁcant, i.e. having a
level of signiﬁcance of 0.05, and represents the proba-
bility of rejecting a hypothesis when it is correct. The
z-values of less than −1.96 and more than 1.96 are
called critical values and the shaded areas in Fig. 65.1
are called the critical regions or regions for which the
hypothesis is rejected. Having formulated hypotheses,
the rules of decision and a level of signiﬁcance,the mag-
nitude of the type I error is given. Nothing can now be
done about type II errors and in most cases they are
accepted in the hope that they are not too large.
When critical regions occur on both sides of the mean of
a normal distribution, as shown in Fig. 65.1, they are as
a result of two-tailed or two-sided tests. In such tests,
consideration has to be given to values on both sides
of the mean. For example, if it is required to show that
the percentage of metal, p, in a particular alloy is x%,
then a two-tailed test is used, since the null hypothesis
is incorrect if the percentage of metal is either less than
x or more than x. The hypothesis is then of the form:
H0 : p = x% H1 : p ̸= x%
However, for the machine producing bolts, the man-
ufacturer’s decision is not affected by the fact that a
sample contains say one or two defective bolts. He is
only concerned with the sample containing, say, ten or
more defective bolts. Thus a ‘tail’ on the left of the mean
is not required. In this case a one-tailed test or a one-
sided test is really required. If the defect rate is, say, d
and the per unit values economically acceptable to the
manufacturer are u1 and u2, where u1 is an acceptable
defect rate and u2 is the maximum acceptable defect
rate, then the hypotheses in this case are of the form:
H0 : d = u1 H1 : d > u2
and the critical region lies on the right-hand side of the
mean, as shown in Fig. 65.2(a). A one-tailed test can
have its critical region either on the right-hand side or
on the left-hand side of the mean. For example, if lamps
are being tested and the manufacturer is only interested

in those lamps whose life length does not meet a certain
minimum requirement, then the hypotheses are of the
form:
H0 : l = h H1 : l < h
where l is the life length and h is the number of hours
to failure. In this case the critical region lies on the left-
hand side of the mean, as shown in Fig. 65.2(b).
The z-values for various levels of conﬁdence are given
in Table 64.1 on page 683. The corresponding levels of
signiﬁcance (a conﬁdence level of 95% is equivalent to
a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05 in a two-tailed test) and
their z-values for both one-tailed and two-tailed tests
are given in Table 65.1. It can be seen that two values
of z are given for one-tailed tests, the negative value
for critical regions lying to the left of the mean and a
positive value for critical regions lying to the right of
the mean.
The problem of the machine producing 3% defective
bolts can now be reconsidered from a signiﬁcance test-
ing point of view. A random sample of 200 bolts is
drawn, and the manufacturer is interested in a change in
the defect rate in a speciﬁed direction (i.e. an increase),
hence the hypotheses tests are designed accordingly. If
the manufactureris willing to accept a defect rate of 3%,
but wants adjustments made to the machine if the defect
rate exceeds 3%, then the hypotheses will be:
(i)
a null hypothesis such that the defect rate, p, is
equal to 3%,
i.e.
H0 : p = 0.03, and
(ii)
an alternative hypothesis such that the defect rate
is greater than 3%,
i.e.
H1 : p > 0.03
The ﬁrst rule of decision is as follows: let the level
of signiﬁcance, α, be 0.05; this will limit the type I
error, that is, the error due to rejecting the hypothe-
sis when it should be accepted, to 5%, which means
that the results are probably correct. The second rule
of decision is to decide the number of defective bolts
in a sample for which the machine is stopped and
adjustments are made. For a one-tailed test, a level
of signiﬁcance of 0.05 and the critical region lying to
the right of the mean of the standardised normal dis-
tribution, the z-value from Table 65.1 is 1.645. If the
defect rate p is 0.03%, the mean of the normal distribu-
tion is given by Np = 200 × 0.03 = 6 and the standard
deviation is √(Npq) = √(200 × 0.03 × 0.97) = 2.41,
using the normal approximation to a binomial distri-
bution. Since the z-value is
variate−mean
standard deviation, then
1.645 = variate−6
2.41
giving a variate value of 9.96. This
variate is the number of defective bolts in a sample such
that when this number is reached or exceeded the null
hypothesis is rejected. For 95 times out of 100 this will
be the correct thing to do. The second rule of decision
will thus be ‘reject H0 if the numberof defective bolts in
a random sample is equal to or exceeds ten, otherwise
accept H ′
0. That is, the machine is adjusted when the
number of defective bolts in a random sample reaches
ten and this will be the correct decision 95% of the time.
The type II error can now be calculated, but there is lit-
tle point, since having ﬁxed the sample number and the
level of signiﬁcance, there is nothing that can be done
about it.

A two-tailed test is used when it is required to test for
changes in anunspeciﬁed direction. For example, if the
manufacturer of bolts, used in the previous example, is
inspectingthediameterofthebolts,hewillwanttoknow
whether the diameters are too large or too small. Let the
nominal diameter of the bolts be 2 mm. In this case the
hypotheses will be:
H0 : d = 2.00mm H1 : d ̸= 2.00mm,
where d is the mean diameter of the bolts. His ﬁrst
decision is to set the level of signiﬁcance, to limit his
type I error. A two-tailed test is used, since adjustments
must be made to the machine if the diameter does not
lie within speciﬁed limits. The method of using such a
signiﬁcance test is given in Section 65.3.
When determining the magnitude of type I and type
II errors, it is often possible to reduce the amount of
work involved by using a normal or a Poisson distri-
bution rather than binomial distribution. A summary of
the criteria for the use of these distributions and their
form is given below, for a sample of size N, a proba-
bility of defective components p and a probability of
non-defective components q
Binomial distribution
From Chapter 60, the probability of having 0,1,2,
3,... defective components in a random sample of N
components is given by the successive terms of the
expansion of (q + p)N, taken from the left. Thus:

Poisson approximation to a binomial
distribution
When N ≥50 and Np < 5, the Poisson distribution is
approximately the same as the binomial distribution. In
the Poisson distribution, the expectation λ = Np and
from Chapter 60, the probability of 0,1,2,3,... defec-
tive components in a random sample of N components
is given by the successive terms of

Normal approximation to a binomial
distribution
When both Np and Nq are greater than 5, the normal
distribution is approximately the same as the binomial
distribution, The normal distribution has a mean of Np
and a standard deviation of √(Npq)
Problem 1.
Wood screws are produced by an
automatic machine and it is found over a period of
time that 7% of all the screws produced are
defective. Random samples of 80 screws are drawn
periodically from the output of the machine. If a
decision is made that production continues until a
sample contains more than seven defective screws,
determine the type I error based on this decision for
a defect rate of 7%. Also determine the magnitude
of the type II error when the defect rate has risen to
10%
N = 80,
p = 0.07,
q = 0.93
Since both Np and Nq are greater than 5, a normal
approximation to the binomial distribution is used.
Mean of the normal distribution,
Np = 80 × 0.07 = 5.6
Standard deviation of the normal distribution,

(80 × 0.07 × 0.93) = 2.28
A type I error is the probability of rejecting a hypoth-
esis when it is correct, hence, the type I error in this
problem is the probability of stopping the machine, that
is, the probability of getting more than seven defective
screws in a sample, even though the defect rate is still
seven%. The z-value corresponding to seven defective
screws is given by:
variate −mean
standard deviation = 7 −5.6
2.28
= 0.61

Section K
Signiﬁcance testing
697
Using Table 61.1 of partial areas under the standard-
ised normal curve given on page 661, the area between
the mean and a z-value of 0.61 is 0.2291. Thus, the
probability of more than seven defective screws is the
area to the right of the z-ordinate at 0.61, that is,
[total area −(area to the left of mean
+area between mean and z = 0.61)]
i.e. 1 −(0.5 + 0.2291). This gives a probability of
0.2709.ItisusualtoexpresstypeIerrorsasapercentage,
giving
type I error = 27.1%
A type II error is the probability of accepting a hypoth-
esis when it should be rejected. The type II error in this
problem is the probability of a sample containing fewer
than seven defective screws, even though the defect rate
has risen to 10%. The values are now:
N = 80,
p = 0.1,
q = 0.9
As Np and Nq are both greater than 5, a normalapprox-
imation to a binomial distribution is used, in which the
mean Np is 80 × 0.1 = 8 and the standard deviation
√(Npq) = √(80 × 0.1 × 0.9) = 2.68
The z-value for a variate of seven defective screws is
7 −8
2.68 = −0.37
Using Table 61.1 of partial areas given on page 661,
the area between the mean and z = −0.37 is 0.1443.
Hence, the probability of gettingfewerthansevendefec-
tive screws, even though the defect rate is 10% is (area
to the left of mean – area between mean and a z-value of
−0.37),i.e.0.5 −0.1443 = 0.3557.Itisusualtoexpress
type II errors as a percentage, giving
type II error = 35.6%
Problem 2.
The sample size in Problem 1 is
reduced to 50. Determine the type I error if the
defect rate remains at 7% and the type II error when
the defect rate rises to 9%. The decision is now to
stop the machine for adjustment if a sample
contains four or more defective screws.
N = 50,
p = 0.07
When N ≥50 and Np < 5, the Poisson approximation
to a binomial distribution is used. The expectation λ =
Np = 3.5. The probabilities of 0,1,2,3,... defective
screws are given by e−λ, λe−λ, λ2e−λ

Thus,
probability of a sample containing

probability of a sample containing

Hence, the probability of a sample containing four or
more defective screws is 1 −0.5367 = 0.4633. Thus
the type I error, that is, rejecting the hypothesis when
it should be accepted or stopping the machine for
adjustment when it should continue running, is 46.3%
When the defect rate has risen to 9%, p = 0.09 and
Np = λ = 4.5. Since N ≥50 and Np < 5, the Poisson
approximation to a binomial distribution can still be
used. Thus,
probability of a sample containing
no defective screws,
e−λ = 0.0111
probability of a sample containing
one defective screw,
λe−λ = 0.0500
probability of a sample containing

probability of a sample containing

0.3423
That is, the probability of a sample containing less than
four defective screws is 0.3423. Thus, the type II error,
that is, accepting the hypothesis when it should have
been rejected or leaving the machine running when it
should be stopped, is 34.2%
Problem 3.
The sample size in Problem 1 is now
reduced to 25. Determine the type I error if the
defect rate remains at 7%, and the type II error
when the defect rate rises to 10%. The decision is
now to stop the machine for adjustment if a sample
contains three or more defective screws.

65.3 Signiﬁcance tests for population
means
When carrying out tests or measurements, it is often
possible to form a hypothesis as a result of these tests.
For example, the boiling point of water is found to
be: 101.7◦C, 99.8◦C, 100.4◦C, 100.3◦C, 99.5◦C and
98.9◦C, as a result of six tests. The mean of these six
results is 100.1◦C. Based on these results, how conﬁ-
dently can it be predicted that at this particular height
above sea level and at this particular barometric pres-
sure, water boils at 100.1◦C? In other words, are the
results based on sampling signiﬁcantly different from
the true result? There are a variety of ways of testing
signiﬁcance,but only one or two of these in common use

Section K
Signiﬁcance testing
699
are introduced in this section. Usually, in signiﬁcance
tests, some predictions about population parameters,
based on sample data, are required. In signiﬁcance
tests for population means, a random sample is drawn
from the population and the mean value of the sam-
ple, x, is determined. The testing procedure depends on
whetherornotthestandarddeviationofthepopulationis
known.
(a) When the standard deviation of the
population is known
A null hypothesis is made that there is no difference
between the value of a sample mean x and that of the
population mean, μ, i.e. H0: x = μ. If many samples
had been drawn from a population and a sampling dis-
tribution of means had been formed, then, provided N
is large (usually taken as N ≥30) the mean value would
form a normal distribution, having a mean value of μx
and a standard deviation or standard error of the means
(see Section 64.3).
The particular value of x of a large sample drawn for a
signiﬁcance test is therefore part of a normal distribution
and it is possible to determineby how much x is likely to
differ from μx in terms of the normal standard variate z.
The relationship is z = x −μx

In Table 65.1 on page 695, the relationship between
z-values and levels of signiﬁcance for both one-tailed
and two-tailed tests are given. It can be seen from this
table for a level of signiﬁcance of, say, 0.05 and a two-
tailed test, the z-value is +1.96, and z-values outside
of this range are not signiﬁcant. Thus, for a given level
of signiﬁcance (i.e. a known value of z), the mean of
the population, μ, can be predicted by using equations
(1) and (2) above, based on the mean of a sample x.
Alternatively, if the mean ofthepopulationis known,the
signiﬁcance of a particular value of z, based on sample
data, can be established. If the z-valuebasedonthe mean
of a random sample for a two-tailed test is found to be,
say, 2.01, then at a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05, that
is, the results being probably signiﬁcant, the mean of
the sampling distribution is said to differ signiﬁcantly
from what would be expected as a result of the null
hypothesis (i.e. that x = μ), due to the result of the test
being classed as ‘not signiﬁcant’ (see page 694). The
hypothesis would then be rejected and an alternative
hypothesis formed, i.e. H1: x ̸= μ. The rules of decision
for such a test would be:
(i)
reject the hypothesis at a 0.05 level of signiﬁcance,
i.e. if the z-value of the sample mean is outside of
the range −1.96 to +1.96
(ii)
accept the hypothesis otherwise.
For small sample sizes (usually taken as N < 30),
the sampling distribution is not normally distributed,
but approximates to Student’s t-distributions (see
Section 64.5). In this case, t-values rather than z-values
are used and the equations analogous to equations (1)

(b) When the standard deviation of the
population is not known
It is found, in practice, that if the standard deviation of a
sample is determined, its value is less than the value of
the standard deviation of the population from which it is
drawn. This is as expected, since the range of a sample
is likely to be less than the range of the population. The
difference between the two standarddeviations becomes
more pronounced when the sample size is small. Inves-
tigations have shown that the variance, s 2, of a sample

The equations given in this section are parts of tests
which are applied to determine population means. The
way in which some of them are used is shown in the
following worked problems.
Problem 4.
Sugar is packed in bags by an
automatic machine. The mean mass of the contents
of a bag is 1.000 kg. Random samples of 36 bags
are selected throughout the day and the mean mass
of a particular sample is found to be 1.003 kg. If the
manufacturer is willing to accept a standard
deviation on all bags packed of 0.01 kg and a level
of signiﬁcance of 0.05, above which values the
machine must be stopped and adjustments made,
determine if, as a result of the sample under test, the
machine should be adjusted.
Population

mean
x = 1.003 kg, population standard deviation σ = 0.01
kg and sample size, N = 36
A null hypothesis for this problem is that the sample
mean and the mean of the population are equal, i.e.
H0: x = μ
Since the manufacturer is interested in deviations on
both sides of the mean, the alternative hypothesis is that
the sample mean is not equal to the population mean,
i.e. H1: x ̸= μ
The decision rules associated with these hypothe-
ses are:
(i)
reject H0 if the z-value of the sample mean is out-
side of the range of the z-values corresponding to
a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05 for a two-tailed test,
i.e. stop machine and adjust, and
(ii)
accept H0 otherwise, i.e. keep the machine run-
ning.
The sample size is over 30 so this is a ‘large sample’
problem and the populationcan be consideredto be inﬁ-
nite. Because values of x, μ, σ and N are all known,

The z-value corresponding to a level of signiﬁcance of
0.05 for a two-tailed test is given in Table 65.1 on page
695 and is ±1.96. Since the z-value of the sample is
within this range, the null hypothesis is accepted and
the machine should not be adjusted.
Problem 5.
The mean lifetime of a random
sample of 50 similar torch bulbs drawn from a
batch of 500 bulbs is 72 hours. The standard
deviation of the lifetime of the sample is 10.4 hours.
The batch is classed as inferior if the mean lifetime
of the batch is less than the population mean of
75 hours. Determine whether, as a result of the
sample data, the batch is considered to be inferior at
a level of signiﬁcance of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01.
Population size, Np = 500, population mean, μ = 75
hours,meanofsample,x = 72 hours,standarddeviation
of sample, s = 10.4 hours, size of sample, N = 50
The null hypothesis is that the mean of the sample is
equal to the mean of the population, i.e. H0: x = μ
The alternative hypothesis is that the mean of the sample
is less than the mean of the population, i.e. H1: x < μ
(The fact that x = 72 should not lead to the conclusion
that the batch is necessarily inferior. At a level of sig-
niﬁcance of 0.05, the result is‘probably signiﬁcant’, but
since this corresponds to a conﬁdence level of 95%,
there are still ﬁve times in every 100 when the result
can be signiﬁcantly different, that is, be outside of the
range of z-values for this data. This particular sample
result may be one of these ﬁve times.)
The decision rules associated with the hypotheses are:
(i)
reject H0 if the z-value (or t-value) of the sample
mean is less than the z-value (or t-value) corre-
sponding to a level of signiﬁcance of (a) 0.05 and
(b) 0.01, i.e. the batch is inferior,
(ii)
accept H0 otherwise, i.e. the batch is not inferior.
The data given is N, Np, x, s and μ. The alternative
hypothesis indicates a one-tailed distribution and since
N > 30 the ‘large sample’ theory applies.

(1.471)(0.9496) = −2.15
(a)
For a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05 and a one-
tailed test, all values to the left of the z-ordinate at
−1.645 (see Table 65.1 on page 695) indicate that
the results are ‘not signiﬁcant’, that is, they differ
signiﬁcantly from the null hypothesis. Since the
z-value of the sample mean is−2.15, i.e. less than
−1.645, the batch is considered to be inferior at
a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05
(b)
The z-value for a level of signiﬁcance of 0.01 for a
one-tailed test is −2.33 and in this case,z-values of
the sample means lying to the left of the z-ordinate
at −2.33 are ‘not signiﬁcant’. Since the z-value of
the sample lies to the right of this ordinate, it does
not differ signiﬁcantly from the null hypothesis
and the batch is not considered to be inferior at
a level of signiﬁcance of 0.01
(At ﬁrst sight, for a mean value to be signiﬁcant
at a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05, but not at 0.01,
appears to be incorrect. However, it is stated ear-
lier in the chapter that for a result to be probably
signiﬁcant, i.e. at a level of signiﬁcance of between
0.01 and 0.05, the range of z-values is less than the
range for the result to be highly signiﬁcant, that is,
having a level of signiﬁcance of 0.01 or better.
Hence the results of the problem are logical.)
Problem 6.
An analysis of the mass of carbon in
six similar specimens of cast iron, each of mass
425.0 g, yielded the following results:
17.1 g,
17.3 g,

Test the hypothesis that the percentage of carbon is

The null hypothesis is that the sample and population

The alternative hypothesis is that the sample and popu-

The decision rules are:

is outside of the range of the z- or t-value corre-

(ii)
accept H0 otherwise, i.e. the mass of carbon is

The number of tests taken, N, is 6 and an inﬁnite
number of tests could have been taken, hence the pop-
ulation is considered to be inﬁnite. Because N < 30, a
t-distribution is used.
If the mean mass of carbon in the bulk of the metal is
4.00%, the mean mass of carbon in a specimen is 4.00%
of 425.0, i.e. 17.00 g, thus μ = 17.00

In general, for any two-tailed distribution there is a
critical region both to the left and to the right of the
mean of the distribution. For a level of signiﬁcance
of 0.2, 0.1 of the percentile value of a t-distribution
lies to the left of the mean and 0.1 of the percentile
value lies to the right of the mean. Thus, for a level of
signiﬁcance of α, a value t(1−α
2 ) , is required for a two-
tailed distribution when using Table 64.2 on page 689.
This conversion is necessary because the t-distribution
is given in terms of levels of conﬁdence and for a one-
tailed distribution. The row t-valuefor avalue of αof 0.2
is t(1−02
2 ), i.e. t0.90. The degrees of freedom v are N −1,
i.e. 5. From Table 64.2 on page 689, the percentile value
corresponding to (t0.90, v = 5) is 1.48, and for a two-
tailed test, ±1.48. Since the mean value of the sample
is within this range, the hypothesis is accepted at a level
of signiﬁcance of 0.2
The t-value for α = 0.1 is t(1−0.1
2 ) , i.e. t0.95. The per-
centile value corresponding to t0.95, v = 5 is 2.02 and
since the mean value of the sample is within the range
±2.02,thehypothesisisalsoacceptedatthislevelofsig-
niﬁcance. Thus, it is probable that the mass of metal
contains 4% carbon at levels of signiﬁcance of 0.2
and 0.1

Comparing two sample means
The techniques introduced in Section 65.3 can be used
for comparison purposes. For example, it may be nec-
essary to compare the performance of, say, two similar
lamps produced by different manufacturers or differ-
ent operators carrying out a test or tests on the same
items using different equipment. The null hypothesis
adopted for tests involving two different populations is
that there is no difference between the mean values of
the populations.
The technique is based on the following theorem:
If x1 and x2 are the means of random samples of size
N1 and N2 drawn from populations having means
of μ1 and μ2 and standard deviations of σ1 and σ2,
then the sampling distribution of the differences of
the means, (x1 −x2), is a close approximation to a
normal distribution, having a mean of zero and a
standard deviation of

Problem 7.
An automatic machine is producing
components, and as a result of many tests the
standard deviation of their size is 0.02 cm. Two
samples of 40 components are taken, the mean size
of the ﬁrst sample being 1.51 cm and the second
1.52 cm. Determine whether the size has altered
appreciably if a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05 is
adopted, i.e. that the results are probably signiﬁcant.
Since both samples are drawn from the same population,
σ1 = σ2 = σ = 0.02 cm. Also N1 = N2 = 40 and x1 =
1.51 cm, x2 = 1.52 cm.
The level of signiﬁcance, α = 0.05
The null hypothesis is that the size of the componenthas
not altered, i.e. x1 = x2, hence it is H0: x1 −x2 = 0.
The alternative hypothesis is that the size of the com-
ponents has altered, i.e. that x1 ̸= x2, hence it is
H1 : x1 −x2 ̸= 0

Problem 8.
The electrical resistances of two
products are being compared. The parameters of
product 1 are:
sample size 40, mean value of sample
74 ohms, standard deviation of whole of
product 1 batch is 8 ohms
Those of product 2 are:
sample size 50, mean value of sample
78 ohms, standard deviation of whole of
product 2 batch is 7 ohms
Determine if there is any signiﬁcant difference
between the two products at a level of signiﬁcance
of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01
Let the mean of the batch of product 1 be μ1, and that
of product 2 be μ2
The null hypothesis is that the means are the same, i.e.
H0 : μ1 −μ2 = 0
The alternative hypothesis is that the means are not the
same, i.e. H1 : μ1 −μ2 ̸= 0
The population standard deviations are known, i.e.
σ1 = 8 ohms and σ2 = 7 ohms, the sample means are
known, i.e. x1 = 74 ohms and x2 = 78 ohms. Also the
sample sizes are known, i.e. N1 = 40 and N2 = 50.
Hence, equation (9) can be used to determine the z-
value of the difference of the sample means. From

For a two-tailed test, the results are probably sig-
niﬁcant at a 0.05 level of signiﬁcance when z lies
between −1.96 and +1.96. Hence the z-value of
the difference of means shows there is ‘no signiﬁ-

For a two-tailed test, the results are highly sig-

6 −2 = 10. The corresponding t-value from Table 64.2
is 1.81. Since the t-value of the difference of the means
is within the range ±1.81, there is no signiﬁcant dif-
ference between the reaction times at a level of
signiﬁcance of 0.1
Problem 10.
An analyst carries out ten analyses
on equal masses of a substance which is found to
contain a mean of 49.20 g of a metal, with a standard
deviation of 0.41 g. A trainee operator carries out
12 analyses on equal masses of the same substance
which is found to contain a mean of 49.30 g,
with a standard deviation of 0.32 g. Is there any
signiﬁcance between the results of the operators?
Let μ1 and μ2 be the mean values of the amounts of
metal found by the two operators.

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference
between the results obtained by the two operators, i.e.
H0: μ1 = μ2
The alternative hypothesis is that there is a differ-
ence between the results of the two operators, i.e.
H1: μ1 ̸= μ2
Under the hypothesis H0 the standard deviations of
the amount of metal, σ, will be the same, and from

For the results to be probably signiﬁcant, a two-tailed
test and a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05 is taken. H0 is
rejected outside of the range t−0.975 and t0.975. The num-
ber of degrees of freedom is N1 + N2 −2. For t0.975,
v = 20, from Table 64.2 on page 689, the range is from
−2.09 to +2.09. Since the t-value based on the sample
data is within this range, there is no signiﬁcant differ-
ence between the results of the two operators at a
level of signiﬁcance of 0.05

Chapter 66
Chi-square and
distribution-free tests
Why it is important to understand: Chi-square and distribution-free tests
Chi-square and distribution-free tests are used in science and engineering. Chi-square is a statistical test
commonly used to compare observed data with data we would expect to obtain according to a speciﬁc
hypothesis. Distribution-free methods do not rely on assumptions that the data are drawn from a given
probability distribution. Non-parametric methods are widely used for studying populations that take on
a ranked order. These test are explained in this chapter.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
calculate a Chi-square value for a given distribution
•
test hypotheses on ﬁtting data to theoretical distribution using the Chi-square distribution
•
recognise distribution-free test
•
use the sign test for two samples
•
use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for two samples
•
use the Mann–Whitney test for two samples
66.1
Chi-square values
The signiﬁcance tests introduced in Chapter 65 rely
very largely on the normal distribution. For large sam-
ple numbers where z-values are used, the mean of the
samples and the standard error of the means of the
samples are assumed to be normally distributed (cen-
tral limit theorem). For small sample numbers where
t-values are used, the population from which samples
are taken should be approximately normally distributed
forthet-valuestobemeaningful.Chi-squaretests(pro-
nounced KY and denoted by the Greek letter χ), which
are introduced in this chapter, do not rely on the popula-
tion or a sampling statistic such as the mean or standard
error of the means being normally distributed. Signiﬁ-
cance tests based on z- and t-values are concerned with
theparametersofadistribution,suchasthemeanandthe
standard deviation, whereas Chi-square tests are con-
cerned with the individual members of a set and are
associated with non-parametric tests.
Observed and expected frequencies
The results obtained from trials are rarely exactly the
same as the results predicted by statistical theories. For
example, if a coin is tossed 100 times, it is unlikely that
the result will be exactly 50 heads and 50 tails. Let us
assume that, say, ﬁve people each toss a coin 100 times
and note the number of, say, heads obtained. Let the
results obtained be as shown below.

Hence the Chi-square value χ2 = 4.36
If the value of χ2 is zero, then the observed and
expected frequencies agree exactly. The greater the
difference between the χ2-value and zero, the greater
the discrepancy between the observed and expected
frequencies.

66.2 Fitting data to theoretical
distributions
For theoretical distributions such as the binomial, Pois-
son and normal distributions, expected frequencies can
be calculated. For example, from the theory of the bino-
mial distribution, the probability of having 0,1,2,...,n
defective items in a sample of n items can be determined
from the successive terms of (q + p)n, where p is the
defect rate and q = 1 −p. These probabilities can be
used to determine the expected frequencies of having
0,1,2,...,n defective items. As a result of counting the
number of defective items when sampling, the observed
frequencies are obtained. The expected and observed
frequencies can be compared by means of a Chi-square
test and predictions can be made as to whether the differ-
ences are due to random errors, due to some fault in the
method of sampling, or due to the assumptions made.
As for normal and t distributions, a table is available for
relating various calculated values of χ2 to those likely
because of random variations, at various levels of conﬁ-
dence. Such a table is shown in Table 66.1. InTable 66.1,
the column on the left denotes the number of degrees of
freedom, v, and when the χ2-values refer to ﬁtting data
to theoretical distributions, the number of degrees of
freedom is usually (N −1) , where N is the number of
rows in the table from which χ2 is calculated. However,
when the population parameters such as the mean and
standard deviation are based on sample data, the num-
ber of degrees of freedom is given by v = N −1 −M,
where M is the number of estimated population param-
eters. An application of this is shown in Problem 4.
The columns of the table headed χ2
0.995, χ2
0.99,... give
the percentile of χ2-values corresponding to levels of
conﬁdence of 99.5%, 99%,...(i.e. levels of signiﬁcance
of 0.005, 0.01,...). On the far right of the table, the
columns headed..., χ2
0.01, χ2
0.005 also correspond to lev-
els of conﬁdence of...99%, 99.5%, and are used to
predictthe‘toogoodtobetrue’typeresults,wheretheﬁt
obtained is so good that the method of sampling must be
suspect. The method in which χ2-values are used to test
the goodness of ﬁt of data to probability distributions is
shown in the following problems.
Problem 2.
As a result of a survey carried out of
200 families, each with ﬁve children, the
distribution shown below was produced. Test the
null hypothesis that the observed frequencies are
consistent with male and female births being
equally probable, assuming a binomial distribution,
a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05 and a ‘too good to be
true’ ﬁt at a conﬁdence level of 95%

To determine the expected frequencies
Using the usual binomial distribution symbols, let p
be the probability of a male birth and q = 1 −p be the
probabilityof a female birth.The probabilitiesof having
5 boys, 4 boys, ...,0 boys are given by the successive
terms of the expansion of (q + p)n. Since there are ﬁve
children in each family, n = 5, and
(q + p)5 = q5 + 5q4p + 10q3p2 + 10q2p3
+ 5qp4 + p5
When q = p = 0.5, the probabilities of 5 boys,
4 boys, ...,0 boys are
0.03125, 0.15625, 0.3125, 0.3125,
0.15625 and 0.3125
For 200 families, the expected frequencies, rounded off
to the nearest whole number are: 6, 31, 63, 63, 31 and 6
respectively.

To test the signiﬁcance of the χχχ2-value
The number of degrees of freedom is given by v =
N −1 where N is the numberof rows in the table above,
thus v = 6 −1 = 5. For level of signiﬁcance of 0.05,
the conﬁdence level is 95%, i.e. 0.95 per unit. From
Table 66.1 for the χ2
0.95, v = 5 value, the percentile value
χ2
p is 11.1. Since the calculated value of χ2 is less than
χ2
p the null hypothesis that the observed frequen-
cies are consistent with male and female births being
equally probable is accepted.
For a conﬁdence level of 95%, the χ2
0.05, v = 5 value
from Table 66.1 is 1.15 and because the calculated value
of χ2 (i.e. 7.598) is greater than this value, the ﬁt is not
so good as to be unbelievable.

Test the null hypothesis that the deposition of grit
particles is according to a Poisson distribution at a
level of signiﬁcance of 0.01 and determine if the
data is ‘too good to be true’ at a conﬁdence level of
99%
To determine the expected frequency
The expectation or average occurrence is given by:
λ = total number of particles deposited
total number of cards
= 69 + 88 + 81 + 48 + 30+ 6
200

The expected frequencies are calculated using a Pois-
son distribution, where the probabilities of there being

sive terms of e−λ

To test the signiﬁcance of the χχχ2-value
The number of degrees of freedom is v = N −1, where
N is the number of rows in the table above, giving
v = 7 −1 = 6. The percentile value of χ2 is determined
from Table 66.1, for (χ2
0.99, v = 6) , and is 16.8. Since
the calculated value of χ2 (i.e. 2.773 is smaller than the
percentile value, the hypothesis that the grit deposi-
tionisaccordingtoaPoissondistributionisaccepted.
For a conﬁdence level of 99%, the (χ2
0.01, v = 6) value
is obtained from Table 66.1, and is 0.872. Since the cal-
culated value of χ2 is greater than this value, the ﬁt is
not ‘too good to be true’.

Test the null hypothesis that the diameters of the

distribution gives a ‘too good’ ﬁt at a level of

To determine the expected frequencies
In order to determine theexpected frequencies, the mean
and standard deviation of the distribution are required.
These population parameters, μ and σ, are based on
sample data, x and s, and an allowance is made in the
number of degrees of freedom used for estimating the
population parameters from sample data.
The sample mean,
x =
12(4.011) + 47(4.015) + 86(4.019) + 123(4.023)

The class boundaries for the diameters are 4.009 to
4.013, 4.013 to 4.017, and so on, and are shown in col-
umn 2 of Table 66.2. Using the theory of the normal
probability distribution, the probability for each class
and hence the expected frequencyis calculated as shown
in Table 66.2.
In column 3, the z-values corresponding to the class
boundaries are determined using z = x −x
s
which in
this case is z = x −4.024
0.00587 . The area between a z-
value in column 3 and the mean of the distribution
at z = 0 is determined using the table of partial areas
under the standardised normal distribution curve given
in Table 61.1 on page 661, and is shown in column
4. By subtracting the area between the mean and the
z-value of the lower class boundary from that of the
upper class boundary,the area and hence the probability
of a particular class is obtained, and is shown in column
5. There is one exception in column 5, corresponding to
class boundariesof 4.021 and 4.025, where the areas are
added to give the probability of the 4.023 class. This is
because these areas lie immediately to the left and right
of the mean value. Column 6 is obtained by multiplying
the probabilities in column 5 by the sample number. 500
The sum of column 6 is not equal to 500 because the
area underthe standardizednormalcurve for z-valuesof
less than −2.56 and more than 2.21 are neglected. The
error introduced by doing this is 10 in 500, i.e. 2%, and
is acceptable in most problems of this type. If it is not
acceptable, each expected frequency can be increased
by the percentage error.

To text the signiﬁcance of the χχχ2-value
The number of degrees of freedom is given by N −1 −
M, where M is the number of estimated parameters in
the population. Both the mean and the standard devia-
tion of the population are based on the sample value,
M = 2, hence v = 7 −1 −2 = 4. From Table 66.1, the
χ2
p-value corresponding to χ2
0.95 and v4 is 9.49. Hence
the null hypothesis that the diameters of the rivets
are normally distributed is rejected. For χ2
0.10, v4, the
χ2
p-value is 1.06, hence the ﬁt is not ‘too good’. Since
the null hypothesis is rejected, the second signiﬁcance
test need not be carried out.

Introduction to distribution-free
tests
Sometimes, sampling distributions arise from popula-
tions with unknown parameters. Tests that deal with
such distributions are called distribution-free tests;
since they do not involve the use of parameters,
they are known as non-parametric tests. Three such
tests are explained in this chapter – the sign test in
Section 66.4 following, the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test in Section 66.5 and the Mann–Whitney test in
Section 66.6.
66.4
The sign test
The sign test is the simplest, quickest and oldest of all
non-parametric tests.
Procedure
(i)
State for the data the null and alternative hypothe-
ses, H0 and H1
(ii)
Know whether the stated signiﬁcance level, α,
is for a one-tailed or a two-tailed test. Let, for
example, H0 : x = φ, then if H1 : x ̸= φ then a
two-tailed test is suggested because x could be
less than or more than φ (thus use α2 in Table 66.3
on page 718), but if say H1 : x < φ or H1 : x > φ
then a one-tailed test is suggested (thus use α1 in
Table 66.3).
(iii)
Assign plus or minus signs to each piece of data –
comparedwith φ (see Problems 5 and 6) or assign
plus and minus signs to the difference for paired
observations (see Problem 7).
(iv)
Sum either the number ofplus signs or the number
of minus signs. For the two-tailed test, whichever
is the smallest is taken; for a one-tailed test, the

Section K
Chi-square and distribution-free tests
717
one which would be expected to have the smaller
value when H1 is true is used. The sum decided
upon is denoted by S.
(v)
Use Table 66.3 for given values of n and α 1 or α2
to read the critical region of S. For example, if,
say, n = 16 and α1 = 5%, then from Table 66.3,
S ≤4. Thus if S in part (iv) is greater than 4
we accept the null hypothesis H0 and if S is
less than or equal to 4 we accept the alternative
hypothesis H1
This procedure for the sign test is demonstrated in the
following Problems.
Problem 5.
A manager of a manufacturer is
concerned about suspected slow progress in dealing
with orders. He wants at least half of the orders
received to be processed within a working day
(i.e. seven hours). A little later he decides to time 17
orders selected at random, to check if his request
had been met. The times spent by the 17 orders
being processed were as follows:
4 3
4 h
9 3
4 h
15 1
2 h
11h
8 1

9 1

15 1
4 h
13h
8h
7 3
4 h
6 3
4 h
Use the sign test at a signiﬁcance level of 5% to
check if the manager’s request for quicker
processing is being met.
Using the above procedure:
(i)
The hypotheses are H0: t = 7h and H: t > 7h,
where t is time.
(ii)
Since H1 is t > 7h, a one-tail test is assumed, i.e.
α1 = 5%
(iii)
In the sign test each value of data is assigned a +
or −sign. For the above data let us assign a+ for
times greater than seven hours anda –forless than
seven hours. This gives the following pattern:
−+ + + + −+ + +
−+ + + + + + −
(iv)
The test statistic, S in this case, is the number of
minus signs (−if H0 were true there would be
an equal number of + and −signs). Table 66.3
gives critical values for the sign test and is given
in terms of small values; hence in this case S is
the number of −signs, i.e. S = 4
(v)
From Table 66.3, with a sample size n =
17,
for
a
signiﬁcance
level
of
α1 = 5%,
S ≤4.
Since S = 4 in our data, the result is signiﬁ-
cant at α1 = 5%, i.e. the alternative hypothesis
is accepted – it appears that the manager’s
request for quicker processing of orders is not
being met.

Use the sign test to test the hypothesis, at a 5% level
of signiﬁcance, that this particular vacuum cleaner
operates, on average, 1.7 hours before needing a
recharge.
Using the procedure:
(i)
Null hypothesis H0: t = 1.7h
Alternative hypothesis H1: t ̸= 1.7h
(ii)
Signiﬁcance level, α2 = 5% (since this is a two-
tailed test).
(iii)
Assuming a + sign for times >1.7 and a – sign
for times <1.7 gives:
−+ −−+ −+ −+ −−
(iv)
There are four plus signs and seven minus signs;
taking the smallest number, S = 4
(v)
From Table 66.3, where n = 11 and α2 = 5%,
S ≤1
Since S = 4 falls in the acceptance region (i.e. in
this case is greater than 1), the null hypothesis is
accepted, i.e. the average operating time is not
signiﬁcantly different from 1.7 h.
Problem 7.
An engineer is investigating two
different types of metering devices, A and B, for an
electronic fuel injection system to determine if they
differ in their fuel mileage performance. The
system is installed on 12 different cars, and a test is

Using the procedure:
(i)
H0: FA = FB and H1: FA ̸= FB where FA and
FB are the fuels in miles/gallon for systems A and
B respectively.
(ii)
α2 = 5% (since it is a two-tailed test).
(iii)
The difference between the observations is deter-
mined and a + or a −sign assigned to each as
shown below:
(A−B) +1.1 −0.9 +1.7 +0.8

+0.4 −1.6 +0.6 +0.3
(iv)
There are seven ‘+ signs and ﬁve ‘−signs’.
Taking the smallest number, S = 5
(v)
From Table 66.3, with n = 12 and α2 = 5%,
S ≤2
Since from (iv), S is not equal or less than 2,
the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, i.e. the
two metering devices produce the same fuel
mileage performance.

Wilcoxon signed-rank test
The sign test represents data by using only plus and
minus signs, all other information being ignored. The
Wilcoxon signed-rank test does make some use of the
sizes of the differences between the observed values
and the hypothesised median. However, the distribution
needs to be continuous and reasonably symmetric.
Procedure
(i)
State for the data the null and alternative hypothe-
ses, H0 and H1
(ii)
Know whether the stated signiﬁcance level, α, is
for a one-tailed or a two-tailed test (see (ii) in the
procedure for the sign test on page 716).
(iii)
Findthedifferenceofeachpieceofdatacompared
with the null hypothesis (see Problems 8 and 9)
or assign plus and minus signs to the difference
for paired observations (see Problem 10).
(iv)
Rank the differences, ignoring whether they are
positive or negative.
(v)
The Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic T is cal-
culated as the sum of the ranks of either the
positive differences or the negative differences–
whichever is the smaller for a two-tailed test,

Section K
720
Higher Engineering Mathematics
and the one which would be expected to have the
smaller value when H1 is true for a one-tailed test.
(vi)
Use Table 66.4 for given values of n, and α 1 or α2
to read the critical region of T . For example, if,
say, n = 16 and α1 = 5%, then from Table 66.4,
T ≤35. Thus if T in part (v) is greater than 35
we accept the null hypothesis H0 and if T is
less than or equal to 35 we accept the alternative
hypothesis H1
This procedure for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is
demonstrated in the following Problems.

Problem 8.
A manager of a manufacturer is
concerned about suspected slow progress in dealing
with orders. He wants at least half of the orders
received to be processed within a working day (i.e.
seven hours). A little later he decides to time 17
orders selected at random, to check if his request
had been met. The times spent by the 17 orders
being processed were as follows:
4 3
4 h
9 3
4 h
15 1
2 h
11 h

Use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at a signiﬁcance
level of 5% to check if the manager’s request for
quicker processing is being met.
(This is the same as Problem 5 where the sign test was
used.)
Using the procedure:
(i)
The hypotheses are H0 : t = 7h and H1 : t > 7h,
where t is time.
(ii)
Since H1 is t > 7 h, a one-tail test is assumed, i.e.
α1 = 5%
(iii)
Taking the difference between the time taken for
each order and 7 h gives:
−2 1

(v)
The Wilcoxon signed-rank statistic T is calcu-
lated as the sum of the ranks of the negative
differences for a one-tailed test.
The sum of the ranks for the negative values is:
T = 1 + 2 + 9 + 12 = 24
(vi)
Table 66.4 gives the critical values of T for
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. For n = 17 and
a signiﬁcance level α1 = 5%, T ≤41
Hence the conclusion is that since T = 24 the result is
within the 5% critical region. There is thereforestrong
evidence to support H1, the alternative hypothe-
sis, that the median processing time is greater than
seven hours.

Use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to test the
hypothesis, at a 5% level of signiﬁcance, that this
particular vacuum cleaner operates, on average,
1.7 hours before needing a recharge.
(This is the same as Problem 6 where the sign test was
used.)
Using the procedure:
(i)
H0 : t = 1.7h and H1 : t ̸= 1.7h.
(ii)
Signiﬁcance level, α2 = 5% (since this is a two-
tailed test).
(iii)
Taking the difference between each operating
time and 1.7 h gives:
−0.3h +0.6h −0.9h −0.3h
+0.1h −0.2h +0.2h −0.3h
+0.4h −0.6h −0.1h
(iv)
These differences may now be ranked from1to 11
(ignoring whether they are positive or negative).
Some of the differences are equal to each other.
For example, there are two 0.1s (ignoring signs)
that would occupy positions 1 and 2 when
ordered. We average these as far as rankings are
concerned, i.e. each is assigned a rankingof 1 + 2
2
i.e. 1.5. Similarly, the two 0.2 values in positions 3

i.e. 3.5, and the three 0.3 values in positions

i.e. 6, and so on. The rankings are therefore:

(v)
There are four positive terms and seven nega-

positive terms have rankings of 1.5, 3.5, 8 and
9.5. Summing the positive ranks gives: T = 1.5 +
3.5 + 8 + 9.5 = 22.5
(vi)
From Table 66.4, when n = 11 and α2 = 5%,
T ≤10
Since T = 22.5 falls in the acceptance region (i.e.
inthiscaseisgreaterthan10),thenullhypothesis
is accepted, i.e. the average operating time is
not signiﬁcantly different from 1.7 h.
[Note that if, say, a piece of the given data was 1.7 h,
such that the difference was zero, that data is ignored
and n would be 10 instead of 11 in this case.]
Problem 10.
An engineer is investigating two
different types of metering devices, A and B, for an
electronic fuel injection system to determine if they
differ in their fuel mileage performance. The
system is installed on 12 different cars, and a test is
run with each metering system in turn on each car.
The observed fuel mileage data (in miles/gallon) is
shown below:

Use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, at a level of

any difference between the two systems.
(This is the same as Problem 7 where the sign test was
used.)
Using the procedure:
(i)
H0 : FA = FB and H1 : FA ̸= FB where FA and
FB are the fuels in miles/gallon for systems A and
B respectively.
(ii)
α2 = 5% (since it is a two-tailed test).
(iii)
The difference between the observations is deter-
mined and a + or a −sign assigned to each as
shown below:
(A −B) +1.1 −0.9 +1.7 +0.8
−0.5 +0.4 −0.5 −0.1
+0.4 −1.6 +0.6 +0.3
(iv)
The differences are now ranked from 1 to 12
(ignoring whether they are positive or negative).
When ordered, 0.4 occupies positions 3 and 4;
their average is 3.5 and both are assigned this
value when ranked. Similarly, 0.5 occupies posi-
tions 5 and 6 and their average of 5.5 is assigned
to each when ranked.

(vi)
From Table 66.4, when n = 12 and α2 = 5%,
T ≤13
Since from (iv), T is not equal or less than 13,
the null hypothesis cannot be rejected, i.e. the
two metering devices produce the same fuel
mileage performance.

A paint supplier claims that a new additive will
reduce the drying time of their acrylic paint. To
test his claim, 12 pieces of wood are painted,
onehalfofeachpiecewithpaintcontainingthe

there is no difference, on average, in the drying
times of the new and regular additive paints.
66.6
The Mann–Whitney test
As long as the sample sizes are not too large, for tests
involving two samples, the Mann–Whitney test is easy
to apply, is powerful and is widely used.
Procedure
(i)
State for the data the null and alternative hypothe-
ses, H0 and H1
(ii)
Know whether the stated signiﬁcance level, α, is
for a one-tailed or a two-tailed test (see (ii) in the
procedure for the sign test on page 716).
(iii)
Arrange all the data in ascending order whilst
retaining their separate identities.
(iv)
If the data is now a mixture of, say, As and Bs,
write under each letter A the number of Bs that
precede it in the sequence (or vice-versa).
(v)
Add together the numbers obtained from (iv) and
denote total by U. U is deﬁned as whichever type
of count would be expected to be smallest when
H1 is true.
(vi)
Use Table 66.5 on pages 724 to 727 for given
values of n1 and n2, and α1 or α2 to read the criti-
cal region of U. For example, if, say, n1 = 10 and
n2 = 16 and α2 = 5%, then from Table 66.5, U ≤
42. If U in part (v) is greater than 42 we accept
the null hypothesis H0, and if U is equal or less
than 42, we accept the alternative hypothesis H1
The procedure for the Mann–Whitney test is demon-
strated in the following problems.
Problem 11.
Ten British cars and eight
non-British cars are compared for faults during
their ﬁrst 10000 miles of use. The percentage of

(cont. from page 723)
Using the above procedure:
(i)
The hypotheses are:
H0: Equal proportions of British and non-British
cars have breakdowns.
H1: A higher proportion of British cars have
breakdowns.
(ii)
Level of signiﬁcance α1 = 1%
(iii)
Let the sizes of the samples be nP and nQ, where
nP = 8 and nQ = 10. The Mann–Whitney test
compares every item in sample P in turn with
every item in sample Q, a record being kept of
the number of times, say, that the item from P is
greater than Q, or vice-versa. In this case there
are nP nQ, i.e. (8)(10) = 80 comparisons to be
made. All the data is arranged into ascending
order whilst retaining their separate identities –
an easy way is to arrange a linear scale as shown
in Fig. 66.1, on page 728.
From Fig. 66.1, a list of Ps and Qs can be ranked
giving:
P P Q P P Q P Q P P P Q Q Q
Q Q Q Q

Write under each letter P the number of Qs that
precede it in the sequence, giving:

The critical regions are of the form U ≤critical
region.
From Table 66.5, for a sample size 8 and 10 at
signiﬁcance level α1 = 1% the critical regions is
U ≤13
The value of U in our case, from (v), is 13 which
is signiﬁcant at 1% signiﬁcance level.
The Mann–Whitney test has therefore conﬁrmed that

reliability than the British cars in the ﬁrst 10 000
miles, i.e. the alternative hypothesis applies.

Use the Mann–Whitney test at a signiﬁcance level
of 5% to determine if there is any evidence of the
two machines producing different results.
Using the procedure:
(i)
H0: There is no difference in results from the
machines, on average.
H1: The results from the two machines are differ-
ent, on average.
(ii)
α2 = 5%

(vi)
From Table 66.5, for n1 = 11 and n2 = 15, and
α2 = 5%, U ≤44
Since our value of U from (v) is less than 44, H0
is rejected and H1 accepted, i.e. the results from
the two machines are different.

the two brands are equal.
2.
A component is manufactured by two pro-
cesses. Some components from each process
are selected at random and tested for breaking
strength to determine if there is a difference
between the processes. The results are:
Process A 9.7
10.5 10.1 11.6 9.8
Process B 11.3 8.6
9.6 10.2 10.9
Process A

Process B
9.4
10.8
At a level of signiﬁcance of 10%, use the
Mann–Whitney test to determine if there
is a difference between the mean breaking
strengths of the components manufactured by
the two processes.
3.
An experiment, designed to compare two pre-
ventive methods against corrosion, gave the
following results for the maximum depths of
pits (in mm) in metal strands:
Method A 143 106 135 147 139 132 153 140
Method B

Revision Test 19
Sampling and estimation theories, signiﬁcance testing, chi-square
and distribution-free tests
This Revision Test covers the material contained in Chapters 64 to 66. The marks for each question are shown in
brackets at the end of each question.
1.
1200 metal bolts have a mean mass of 7.2 g and a
standard deviation of 0.3 g. Determine the standard
error of the means. Calculate also the probability
that a sample of 60 bolts chosen at random, without
replacement, will have a mass of (a) between 7.1 g
and 7.25 g, and (b) more than 7.3 g.
(12)
2.
A sample of ten measurements of the length of a
component are made and the mean of the sample is
3.650 cm. The standard deviation of the samples is
0.030cm. Determine (a) the 99% conﬁdencelimits,
and (b) the 90% conﬁdence limits for an estimate
of the actual length of the component.
(10)
3.
An automated machine produces metal screws and
over a period of time it is found that eight% are
defective. Random samples of 75 screws are drawn
periodically.
(a)
If a decision is made that productioncontinues
until a sample contains more than eight defec-
tive screws, determine the type I error based
on this decision for a defect rate of 8%.
(b)
Determine the magnitude of the type II error
when the defect rate has risen to 12%
The above sample size is now reduced to
55 screws. The decision now is to stop the
machine for adjustment if a sample contains
four or more defective screws.
(c)
Determine the type I error if the defect rate
remains at 8%
(d)
Determine the type II error when the defect
rate rises to 9%
(22)
4.
In a random sample of 40 similar light bulbs drawn
from a batch of 400 the mean lifetime is found to
be 252 hours. The standard deviation of the lifetime
of the sample is 25 hours. The batch is classed as
inferior if the mean lifetime of the batch is less
than the population mean of 260 hours. As a result
of the sample data, determine whether the batch is
considered to be inferior at a level of signiﬁcance
of (a) 0.05 and (b) 0.01
(9)
5.
The lengths of two products are being compared.
Product 1: sample size = 50, mean value of
sample = 6.5 cm, standard deviation
of whole of batch = 0.40 cm.
Product 2: sample size = 60, mean value of

Why it is important to understand: Introduction to Laplace transforms
The Laplace transform is a very powerful mathematical tool applied in various areas of engineering
and science. With the increasing complexity of engineering problems, Laplace transforms help in solving
complex problems with a very simple approach; the transform is an integral transform method which
is particularly useful in solving linear ordinary differential equations. It has very wide applications
in various areas of physics, electrical engineering, control engineering, optics, mathematics and signal
processing. This chapter just gets us started in understanding some standard Laplace transforms.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne a Laplace transform
•
recognise common notations used for the Laplace transform
•
derive Laplace transforms of elementary functions
•
use a standard list of Laplace transforms to determine the transform of common functions

Introduction
The solution of most electrical circuit problems can be
reduced ultimately to the solution of differential equa-
tions. The use of Laplace∗
transforms provides an
alternative method to those discussed in Chapters 33
and 50 to 54 for solving linear differential equations.
67.2
Deﬁnition of a Laplace transform
The Laplace transform of the function f (t) is deﬁned
by the integral
 ∞
0 e−stf (t)dt, where s is a parameter
assumed to be a real number.
Common notations used for the Laplace
transform
There are various commonly used notations for the
Laplace transform of f (t) and these include:
(i)
L{f (t)} or L{f (t)}
(ii)
L(f ) or Lf
(iii)
f (s) or f (s)
Also, the letter p is sometimes used instead of s as
the parameter. The notation adopted in this book will
be f (t) for the original function and L{f (t)} for its
Laplace transform.
Hence, from above:
L{ f(t)}=
 ∞
0
e−stf(t)dt
(1)
67.3 Linearity property of the
Laplace transform
From equation (1),
L{kf (t)} =
 ∞
0
e−stk f (t)dt
= k
 ∞
0
e−stf (t)dt
∗Who was Laplace? See page 605 for image and resume
of Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace. To ﬁnd out more go to
www.routledge.com/cw/bird
i.e. L{k f (t)}=kL{f (t)}
(2)
where k is any constant.
Similarly,
L{a f (t) + bg(t)} =
 ∞
0
e−st(a f (t) + bg(t))dt
= a
 ∞
0
e−stf (t)dt
+ b
 ∞
0
e−stg(t)dt
i.e. L{af (t) + bg(t)} = aL{f (t)}+bL{g(t)},
(3)
where a and b are any real constants.
The Laplace transform is termed a linear operator
because of the propertiesshown in equations (2)and (3).
67.4 Laplace transforms of
elementary functions
Using the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform in equa-
tion (1) a number of elementary functions may be
transformed. For example:
(a)
f(t)=1. From equation (1),
L{1} =
 ∞

(b)
f(t)=k. From equation (2),
L{k} = kL{1}
Hence L{k} = k

Chapter 68
Properties of Laplace
transforms
Why it is important to understand: Properties of Laplace transforms
As stated in the preceding chapter, the Laplace transform is a widely used integral transform with many
applications in engineering, where it is used for analysis of linear time-invariant systems such as electrical
circuits, harmonic oscillators, optical devices, and mechanical systems. The Laplace transform is also a
valuable tool in solving differential equations, such as in electronic circuits, and in feedback control
systems, such as in stability and control of aircraft systems. This chapter considers further transforms
together with the Laplace transform of derivatives that are needed when solving differential equations.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
derive the Laplace transform of eatf (t)
•
use a standard list of Laplace transforms to determine transforms of the form e atf (t)
•
derive the Laplace transforms of derivatives
•
state and use the initial and ﬁnal value theorems
68.1
The Laplace transform of eat f(t)
FromChapter67,thedeﬁnitionoftheLaplacetransform
of f (t) is:
L{f (t)} =
 ∞
0
e−stf (t)dt
(1)
Thus L{eatf (t)} =
 ∞
0
e−st(eatf (t))dt
=
 ∞
0
e−(s−a)f (t)dt
(2)
(where a is a real constant)
Hence the substitution of (s −a) for s in the transform
shown in equation (1) corresponds to the multiplication
of the original function f (t) by eat. This is known as a
shift theorem.
68.2 Laplace transforms of the form
eat f(t)
From equation (2), Laplace transforms of the form
eatf (t) may be deduced. For example:
(i)
L{eat tn}
Since L{tn}= n!

Equations (3) and (4) are important and are used in

and simultaneous differential equations (Chapter 72).

derivative to derive:
(a) L{k} = k
s
(b) L{2t} = 2
s2
(c) L{e−at} =

From equation (3), L{f ′(t)}=sL{f (t)}−f (0)
(a)
Let f (t)=k, then f ′(t)=0 and f (0)=k
Substituting into equation (3) gives:

i.e.
k = sL{k}
Hence
L{k} = k

Let f (t)=2t then f ′(t)=2 and f (0)=0

Hence
L{2t}= 2

(c)
Let f (t)=e−at then f ′(t)=−ae−at and f (0)=1
Substituting into equation (3) gives:
L{−ae−at} = sL{e−at} −1
−aL{e−at} = sL{e−at} −1

f ′′(t) = −a2cosat, f (0) = 1 and f ′(0) = 0
Substituting into equation (4) gives:

Two such theorems are the initial value theorem and the
ﬁnal value theorem.
(a) The initial value theorem states:

The ﬁnal value of the displacement is thus 2cm.
The initial and ﬁnal value theorems are used in pulse
circuit applications where the response of the circuit
for small periods of time, or the behaviour immediately
after the switch is closed, are of interest. The ﬁnal value
theorem is particularly useful in investigating the sta-
bility of systems (such as in automatic aircraft-landing
systems) and is concernedwith the steady state response
for large values of time t, i.e. after all transient effects
have died away.

Chapter 69
Inverse Laplace transforms
Why it is important to understand: Inverse Laplace transforms
Laplace transforms and their inverses are a mathematical technique which allows us to solve differential
equations, by primarily using algebraic methods. This simpliﬁcation in the solving of equations, coupled
with the ability to directly implement electrical components in their transformed form, makes the use of
Laplace transforms widespread in both electrical engineering and control systems engineering. Laplace
transforms have many further applications in mathematics, physics, optics, signal processing, and proba-
bility. This chapter speciﬁcally explains how the inverse Laplace transform is determined, which can also
involve the use of partial fractions. In addition, poles and zeros of transfer functions are brieﬂy explained;
these are of importance in stability and control systems.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne the inverse Laplace transform
•
use a standard list to determine the inverse Laplace transforms of simple functions
•
determine inverse Laplace transforms using partial fractions
•
deﬁne a pole and a zero
•
determine poles and zeros for transfer functions, showing them on a pole–zero diagram
69.1 Deﬁnition of the inverse Laplace
transform
If the Laplace transform of a function f (t) is F(s),
i.e. L{f (t)}=F(s), then f (t) is called the inverse
Laplace
transform
of
F(s)
and
is
written
as
f (t)= L−1{F(s)}
For example, since L{1}= 1
s then L−1
1
s

=1
Similarly, since L{sinat}=
a
s2 +a2 then
L−1

a
s2 + a2

= sinat, and so on.
69.2 Inverse Laplace transforms of
simple functions
Tables of Laplace transforms, such as the tables in
Chapters 67 and 68 (see pages 737 and 742) may be
used to ﬁnd inverse Laplace transforms.
However, for convenience, a summary of inverse
Laplace transforms is shown in Table 69.1.

69.3 Inverse Laplace transforms using
partial fractions
Sometimes the function whose inverse is required is not
recognisable as a standard type, such as those listed in
Table 69.1. In such cases it may be possible, by using
partial fractions, to resolve the function into simpler
fractions which may be inverted on sight. For example,
the function,
F(s) = 2s −3
s(s −3)
cannot be inverted on sight from Table 69.1. However,
by using partial fractions, 2s −3
s(s −3) ≡1

Poles and zeros
It was seen in the previous section that Laplace trans-
forms, in general, have the form f (s)= φ(s)
θ(s) . This is
the same form as most transfer functions for engineer-
ing systems, a transfer function being one that relates
the response at a given pair of terminals to a source or
stimulus at another pair of terminals.
Let a function in the s
domain be given by:
f (s)=
φ(s)
(s −a)(s −b)(s −c) where φ(s) is of less
degree than the denominator.
Poles: The values a, b, c,…that makes the denomi-
nator zero, and hence f (s) inﬁnite, are called
the system poles of f (s).
If there are no repeated factors, the poles are
simple poles.
If there are repeated factors, the poles are
multiple poles.
Zeros: Values of s that make the numerator φ(s) zero,
and hence f (s) zero, are called the system
zeros of f (s).
For example:
s −4
(s +1)(s −2) has simple poles at s =−1
and s =+2, and a zero at s =4
s +3
(s +1)2(2s +5) has a
simple pole at s =−5
2 and double poles at s =−1, and
a zero at s = −3 and
s +2
s(s −1)(s +4)(2s +1) has simple
poles at s =0,+1, −4, and −1
2 and a zero at s =−2
Pole–zero diagram
The poles and zeros of a function are values of complex
frequency s and can therefore be plotted on the complex
frequencyor s-plane.The resultingplot is the pole–zero
diagram or pole–zero map. On the rectangular axes,
the real part is labelled the σ-axis and the imaginary
part the jω-axis.
The location of a pole in the s-plane is denoted by a
cross (×) and the location of a zero by a small circle
(o). This is demonstrated in the following examples.
From the pole–zero diagram it may be determined that
the magnitude of the transfer function will be larger
when it is closer to the poles and smaller when it is
close to the zeros. This is important in understanding
what the system does at various frequencies and is cru-
cial in the study of stability and control theory in
general.

zero on a pole–zero diagram.
(a)

Hence, s=−10 is a zero of R(s)
(b)
For the denominator to be zero, s =0 or s =−25

Chapter 70
The Laplace transform of the
Heaviside function
Why it is important to understand: The Laplace transform of the Heaviside function
The Heaviside unit step function is used in the mathematics of control theory and signal processing
to represent a signal that switches on at a speciﬁed time and stays switched on indeﬁnitely. It is also
used in structural mechanics to describe different types of structural loads. The Heaviside function has
applications in engineering where periodic functions are represented. In many physical situations things
change suddenly; brakes are applied, a switch is thrown, collisions occur. The Heaviside unit function is
very useful for representing sudden change.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne the Heaviside unit step function
•
use a standard list to determine the Laplace transform of H(t −c)
•
use a standard list to determine the Laplace transform of H(t −c) · f (t −c)
•
determine the inverse transforms of Heaviside functions
70.1
Heaviside unit step function
In engineering applications, functions are frequently
encountered whose values change abruptly at speciﬁed
values of time t. One common example is when a volt-
age is switched on or off in an electrical circuit at a
speciﬁed value of time t.
The switching process can be described mathemati-
cally by the function called the Unit Step Function –
otherwise known as the Heaviside unit step function.
Fig. 70.1 shows a function that maintains a zero value
for all values of t up to t = c and a value of 1 for all
values of t ≥c. This is the Heaviside unit step function
and is denoted by:
f(t)=H(t −c) or u(t −c)
1
f(t)
f(t) =H (t – c)

t
Figure 70.1
where the c indicates the value of t at which the func-
tion changes from a value of zero to a value of unity
(i.e. 1).

where for t < 2,H(t −2)t 2 = 0 and when t ≥2,
H(t −2) · t2 = t2. The function H(t −2) suppresses
the function t 2 for all values of t up to t = 2 and then
‘switches on’ the function t 2 at t = 2.

Heaviside functions
In
the
previous
section
it
was
stated
that:
L{H(t−c).f (t−c)} = e−csF(s)whereF(s)=L{f (t)}
Written in reverse, this becomes:
if F(s) = L{f(t)}, then e−csF(s) = L{H(t −c) · f(t −c)}
This is known as the second shift theorem and is
used when ﬁnding inverse Laplace transforms, as
demonstrated in the following worked problems.

Why it is important to understand: The solution of differential equations using Laplace transforms
Laplace transforms and their inverses are a mathematical technique which allows us to solve differential
equations, by primarily using algebraic methods. This simpliﬁcation in the solving of equations, coupled
with the ability to directly implement electrical components in their transformed form, makes the use
of Laplace transforms widespread in both electrical engineering and control systems engineering. The
procedures explained in previous chapters are used in this chapter which demonstrates how differential
equations are solved using Laplace transforms.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand the procedure to solve differential equations using Laplace transforms
•

Introduction
An alternative method of solving differential equations
to that used in Chapters 33 and 50 to 54 is possible by
using Laplace transforms.
71.2
Procedure to solve differential
equations by using Laplace
transforms
(i)
Take the Laplace transform of both sides of the
differential equation by applying the formulae
for
the
Laplace
transforms
of
derivatives
(i.e. equations (3) and (4) of Chapter 68) and,
where necessary, using a list of standard Laplace
transforms, such as Tables 67.1 and 68.1 on
pages 737 and 742.
(ii)
Put in the given initial conditions, i.e. y(0)
and y′(0).
(iii)
Rearrange the equation to make L{y} the subject.
(iv)
Determine y by using, where necessary, partial
fractions, and taking the inverse of each term by
using Table 69.1 on page 748.

Introduction
It is sometimes necessary to solve simultaneous differ-
ential equations. An example occurs when two electrical
circuits are coupled magnetically where the equations
relating the two currents i1 and i2 are typically:
L1
di1

dt + R1i1 = E1
L2
di2
dt + M di1
dt + R2i2 = 0
where L represents inductance, R resistance, M mutual
inductance and E1 the p.d. applied to one of the circuits.

Chapter 73
Fourier series for periodic
functions of period 2π
Why it is important to understand: Fourier series for periodic functions of periodic 2π
A Fourier series changes a periodic function into an inﬁnite expansion of a function in terms of sines and
cosines. In engineering and physics, expanding functions in terms of sines and cosines is useful because it
makes it possible to more easily manipulate functions that are just too difﬁcult to represent analytically.
The ﬁelds of electronics, quantum mechanics and electrodynamics all make great use of Fourier series.
The Fourier series has become one of the most widely used and useful mathematical tools available to
any scientist. This chapter introduces and explains Fourier series.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
describe a Fourier series
•
understand periodic functions
•
state the formula for a Fourier series and Fourier coefﬁcients
•
obtain Fourier series for given functions

Introduction
Fourier∗seriesprovidesamethodofanalysingperiodic
functions into their constituent components. Alternating
currents and voltages, displacement, velocity and accel-
eration of slider-crank mechanisms and acoustic waves
are typical practical examples in engineering and sci-
ence where periodic functions are involved and often
require analysis.

Periodic functions
A
function
f (x)
is
said
to
be
periodic
if
f (x +T )=f (x) for all values of x, where T
is
some positive number. T is the interval between two
successive repetitions and is called the period of
the functions f (x). For example, y = sinx is peri-
odic in x with period 2π since sinx = sin(x +2π)
= sin(x +4π), and so on. In general, if y =sinωt then
the period of the waveform is 2π/ω. The function
shown in Fig. 73.1 is also periodic of period 2π and is
∗Who was Fourier? Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (21 March
1768–16 May 1830) was a French mathematician and physicist
best known for initiating the investigation of Fourier series and
their applications to problems of heat transfer and vibrations.
Fourier is also credited with the discovery of the greenhouse
effect. To ﬁnd out more go to www.routledge.com/cw/bird

If a graph of a function has no sudden jumps or breaks
it is called a continuous function, examples being the
graphs of sine and cosine functions. However, other
graphs make ﬁnite jumps at a point or points in the
interval. The square wave shown in Fig. 73.1 has ﬁnite
discontinuities at x =π, 2π, 3π, and so on. A great
advantage of Fourier series over other series is that it
can be applied to functions which are discontinuous as
well as those which are continuous.
73.3
Fourier series
(i)
The basis of a Fourier series is that all func-
tions of practical signiﬁcance which are deﬁned in
the interval −π ≤x ≤π can be expressed in terms
of a convergent trigonometric series of the form:
f (x) = a0 + a1cosx + a2cos2x
+ a3cos3x + ··· + b1sinx
+ b2sin2x + b3sin3x + ···
when
a0,a1,a2,...b1,b2,...

stants, i.e.

(ii)
a0, an and bn are called the Fourier coefﬁcients
of the series and if these can be determined, the
series of equation (1) is called the Fourier series
corresponding to f (x).
(iii)
An alternative way of writing the series is by
using the a cosx +bsinx =csin(x +α) relation-
ship introduced in Chapter 19, i.e.
f (x) = a0 + c1sin(x + α1) + c2 sin(2x + α2)
+ ··· + cn sin(nx + αn),
where a0 is a constant,
c1 =

For
the
series
of
equation
(1):
the
term
(a1cosx +b1sinx) or c1 sin(x +α1) is called the
ﬁrst harmonic or the fundamental, the term
(a2 cos2x +b2 sin2x) or c2 sin(2x +α2) is called
the second harmonic, and so on.
For an exact representation of a complex wave, an inﬁ-
nite number of terms are, in general, required. In many
practical cases, however, it is sufﬁcient to take the ﬁrst
few terms only (see Problem 2).

The function is periodic outside of this range with

The square wave function deﬁned is shown in Fig. 73.3.
Since f (x) is given by two different expressions in
the two halves of the range the integration is per-

sum, and so on.

Graphs of P1, P2 and P3, obtained by drawing up
tables of values, and adding waveforms are shown in
Figs. 73.4(a) to (c) and they show that the series is
convergent, i.e. continually approximating towards a
deﬁnite limit as more and more partial sums are taken,
and in the limit will have the sum f (x)=π.
Even with just three partial sums, the waveform is start-

Chapter 74
Fourier series for a
non-periodic function
over range 2π
Why it is important to understand: Fourier series for a non-periodic function over range 2π
As was stated in the previous chapter, there are many practical uses of Fourier series in science and
engineering. The technique has practical applications in the resolution of sound waves into their different
frequencies, for example, in an MP3 player, in telecommunications and Wi-Fi, in computer graphics and
image processing, in climate variation, in water waves, and much more. In this chapter, the Fourier series
for non-periodic functions is explained.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
appreciate that Fourier expansions of non-periodic functions have limited range
•
determine Fourier series for non-periodic functions over a range of 2π
74.1 Expansion of non-periodic
functions
If a function f (x) is not periodic then it cannot be
expandedinaFourierseriesforallvaluesofx.However,
it is possible to determine a Fourier series to represent
the function over any range of width 2π.
Given a non-periodic function, a new function may
be constructed by taking the values of f (x) in the
given range and then repeating them outside of the
given range at intervals of 2π. Since this new func-
tion is, by construction, periodic with period 2π,
it may then be expanded in a Fourier series for
all values of x. For example, the function f (x)=x
is not a periodic function. However, if a Fourier
series for f (x)=x is required then the function
is constructed outside of this range so that it is
periodic with period 2π as shown by the broken lines in
Fig. 74.1.
For non-periodic functions, such as f (x)=x, the sum
of the Fourier series is equal to f (x) at all points in the
given range but it is not equal to f (x) at points outside
of the range.
For determining a Fourier series of a non-periodic
function
over
a
range
2π,
exactly
the
same
formulae for the Fourier coefﬁcients are used as in
Section 73.3(i).

Problem 1.
Determine the Fourier series to
represent the function f (x)=2x in the range
−π to +π.
The function f (x)=2x is not periodic. The function is
shown in the range −π to π in Fig. 74.2 and is then
constructed outside of that range so that it is periodic of
period 2π (see broken lines) with the resulting sawtooth
waveform.

Problem 4.
For the Fourier series of Problem 3:
(a) What is the sum of the series at the point of
discontinuity (i.e. at x =π)? (b) What is the
amplitude and phase angle of the third harmonic?
and (c) Let x =0, and deduce a series for π 2/8
(a)
The sum of the Fourier series at the point of dis-
continuity is given by the arithmetic mean of the
two limiting values of f (x) as x approaches the
point of discontinuity from the two sides.
Hence sum of the series at x =π is
π −0

(b)

Hence the third harmonic is given by

When x =0, f (x)=0 (see Fig. 74.3).

Chapter 75
Even and odd functions and
half-range Fourier series
Why it is important to understand: Even and odd functions and half-range Fourier series
It has already been noted in previous chapters that the Fourier series is a very useful tool. The Fourier
series has many applications; in fact, any ﬁeld of physical science that uses sinusoidal signals, such as
engineering, applied mathematics and chemistry will make use of the Fourier series. Applications are
found in electrical engineering, such as in determining the harmonic components in a.c. waveforms, in
vibration analysis, acoustics, optics, signal processing, image processing and in quantum mechanics. If
it can be found ‘on sight’ that a function is even or odd, then determining the Fourier series becomes an
easier exercise. This is explained in this chapter, together with half-range Fourier series.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne even and odd functions
•
determine Fourier cosine series and Fourier sine series
•
determine Fourier half-range cosine series and Fourier half-range sine series
75.1
Even and odd functions
Even functions
A function y =f (x) is said to be even if f (−x)=f (x)
for all values of x. Graphs of even functions are always
symmetricalaboutthey-axis(i.e.amirrorimage).Two
examples of even functions are y =x 2 and y =cosx as
shown in Fig. 20.25, page 228.
Odd functions
A function y =f (x) is said to be odd if f (−x)=
−f (x) for all values of x. Graphs of odd functions are
always symmetrical about the origin. Two examples
of odd functions are y =x 3 and y =sinx as shown in
Fig. 20.26, page 228.
Many functions are neither even nor odd, two such
examples being shown in Fig. 20.27, page 228.
See also Problems 3 and 4, pages 228 and 229.

Half-range Fourier series
(a)
When a function is deﬁned over the range say 0
to π instead of from 0 to 2π it may be expanded
in a series of sine terms only or of cosine terms
only. The series produced is called a half-range
Fourier series.
(b)
If a half-range cosine series is required for the
function f (x)=x in the range 0 to π then an
even periodic function is required. In Fig. 75.5,
f (x)=x is shown plotted from x =0 to x =π.
Since an even function is symmetrical about the
f (x) axis the line AB is constructed as shown.
If the triangular waveform produced is assumed
to be periodic of period 2π outside of this range
then the waveform is as shown in Fig. 75.5. When
a half-range cosine series is required then the
Fourier coefﬁcients a0 and an are calculated as

Chapter 76
Fourier series over any range
Why it is important to understand: Fourier series over any range
As has been mentioned in preceding chapters, the Fourier series has many applications; in fact, any ﬁeld of
physical science that uses sinusoidal signals, such as engineering, applied mathematics and chemistry, will
make use of the Fourier series. In communications, the Fourier series is essential to understanding how
a signal behaves when it passes through ﬁlters, ampliﬁers and communications channels. In astronomy,
radar and digital signal processing Fourier analysis is used to map the planet. In geology, seismic research
uses Fourier analysis, and in optics, Fourier analysis is used in light diffraction. This chapter explains
how to determine the Fourier series of a periodic function over any range.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
understand the Fourier series of a periodic function of period L
•
determine the Fourier series of a periodic function of period L
•
determine the half-range Fourier series for functions of period L
76.1 Expansion of a periodic function
of period L
(a)
A

function
f (x)

period
L
repeats itself when x
increases by L, i.e.
f (x +L)=f (x). The change from functions
dealt with previously having period 2π to func-
tions having period L is not difﬁcult since it may
be achieved by a change of variable.
(b)
To ﬁnd a Fourier series for a function f (x) in
the range −L
2 ≤x ≤L
2 a new variable u is intro-
duced such that f (x), as a function of u, has
period 2π. If u= 2πx
L
then, when x =−L
2 ,
u=−π
and when x = L
2 ,u=+π. Also, let

Chapter 77
A numerical method of
harmonic analysis
Why it is important to understand: A numerical method of harmonic analysis
In music, if a note has frequency f, integer multiples of that frequency, 2f, 3f, 4f, and so on, are known
as harmonics. As a result, the mathematical study of overlapping waves is called harmonic analysis; this
analysis is a diverse ﬁeld and may be used to produce a Fourier series. Signal processing, medical imaging,
astronomy, optics, and quantum mechanics are some of the ﬁelds that use harmonic analysis extensively.
This chapter explains a simple method of harmonic analysis using the trapezoidal rule.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne harmonic analysis
•
perform a harmonic analysis on data in tabular or graphical form
•
consider complex waveform considerations to reduce working of harmonic analysis
77.1
Introduction
Many practical waveforms can be represented by sim-
ple mathematical expressions, and, by using Fourier
series, the magnitude of their harmonic components
determined, as shown in Chapters 73 to 76. For wave-
forms not in this category, analysis may be achieved by
numerical methods. Harmonic analysis is the process
of resolving a periodic, non-sinusoidal quantity into a
series of sinusoidal components of ascending order of
frequency.
77.2
Harmonic analysis on data given
in tabular or graphical form

ters 73 to 76 all require functions to be integrated, i.e.

However, irregular waveforms are not usually deﬁned
by mathematical expressions and thus the Fourier coef-
ﬁcients cannot be determinedby using calculus. In these
cases, approximate methods, such as the trapezoidal
rule, can be used to evaluate the Fourier coefﬁcients.
Most practical waveforms to be analysed are periodic.
Let the period of a waveform be 2π and be divided into
p equal parts as shown in Fig. 77.1. The width of each
interval is thus 2π
p . Let the ordinates be labelled y0,
y1, y2,... yp (note that y0 = yp). The trapezoidal rule
states:

+4.91sin2θ +9.17sin3θ +···
(4)
Note that in equation (4), (−46.42sinθ +69.66cosθ)
comprises the fundamental, (4.91sin2θ −6.50cos2θ)
comprises the second harmonic and (9.17sin3θ −
8.17cos3θ) comprises the third harmonic.
It is shown in Chapter 19 that:
a sinωt + bcosωt = R sin(ωt + α)
where
a =R cosα,
b=R sinα,
R =
√
a2+b2
and
α = tan−1 b
a
For the fundamental,R =
	
(−46.42)2 + (69.66)2
= 83.71
If
a = R cosα,thencosα = a
R = −46.42
83.71
which is negative,
and if
b = R sinα, then sinα = b
R = 69.66
83.71
which is positive.
The only quadrant where cosα is negative and sinα is
positive is the second quadrant.
Hence α = tan−1 b
a = tan−1 69.66
−46.42
= 123.68◦or 2.16rad
Thus (−46.42sinθ + 69.66cosθ)
= 83.71sin(θ +2.16)
By a similar method it may be shown that the second
harmonic
(4.91sin2θ −6.50cos2θ)=8.15sin(2θ −0.92)
and the third harmonic
(9.17sin3θ −8.17cos3θ)=12.28sin(3θ −0.73)
Hence equation (4) may be re-written as:
V = 17.67+83.71 sin(θ +2.16)
+8.15sin(2θ −0.92)
+12.28sin(3θ −0.73)volts
which is the form used in Chapter 27 with complex
waveforms.

77.3 Complex waveform
considerations
It is sometimes possible to predict the harmonic con-
tent of a waveformon inspection of particular waveform
characteristics.
(i)
If a periodic waveform is such that the area above
the horizontal axis is equal to the area below
then the mean value is zero. Hence a0 =0 (see
Fig. 77.3(a)).
(ii)
An even function is symmetrical about the
vertical axis and contains no sine terms (see
Fig. 77.3(b)).
(iii)
An odd function is symmetrical about the origin
and contains no cosine terms (see Fig. 77.3(c)).
(a) a05 0
(b) Contains no sine terms
(c) Contains no cosine terms (d) Contains only even harmonics

(a)
The waveform shown in Fig. 77.4(a) is sym-
metrical about the origin and is thus an odd
function. An odd function contains no cosine
terms. Also, the waveform has the characteris-
tic f (x)=−f (x +π), i.e. the positive and neg-
ative half cycles are identical in shape. Only
odd harmonics can be present in such a wave-
form. Thus the waveform shown in Fig. 77.4(a)
contains only odd sine terms. Since the area
above the x-axis is equal to the area below,
a0 =0.
(b)
The waveform shown in Fig. 77.4(b) is sym-
metrical about the f (x) axis and is thus an
even function. An even function contains no sine
terms. Also, the waveform has the characteris-
tic f (x)=f (x +π), i.e. the waveform repeats
itself after half a cycle. Only even harmonics
can be present in such a waveform. Thus the
waveform shown in Fig. 77.4(b) contains only
even cosine terms (together with a constant
term, a0).
Problem 3.
An alternating current i amperes is
shown in Fig. 77.5. Analyse the waveform into its
constituent harmonics as far as and including the
ﬁfth harmonic, correct to 2 decimal places, by
taking 30◦intervals.

Figure 77.5
With reference to Fig. 77.5, the following characteristics
are noted:
(i)
The mean value is zero since the area above the
θ axis is equal to the area below it. Thus the
constant term, or d.c. component, a0 = 0
(ii)
Since the waveform is symmetrical about the
origin the function i is odd, which means
that there are no cosine terms present in the
Fourier series.
(iii)
The waveform is of the form f (θ)= −f (θ +π)
whichmeansthatonlyoddharmonicsarepresent.
Investigating waveform characteristics has thus saved
unnecessary calculations and in this case the Fourier
series has only odd sine terms present, i.e.
i = b1sinθ + b3sin3θ + b5sin5θ + ···
A proforma, similar to Table 77.1, but without the
‘cosine terms’ columns and without the ‘even sine
terms’ columns is shown in Table 77.2 up to and
including the ﬁfth harmonic, from which the Fourier
coefﬁcients b1, b3 and b5 can be determined. Twelve
co-ordinates are chosen and labelled y1, y2, y3,...y12
as shown in Fig. 77.5
From equation (3),

and
b5 ≈2
12(−0.24) = −0.04
Thus the Fourier series for current i is given by:
i = 8.04 sin θ −2.00sin3θ −0.04 sin 5θ

Chapter 78
The complex or
exponential form
of a Fourier series
Why it is important to understand: The complex or exponential form of a Fourier series
A Fourier series may be represented not only as a sum of sines and cosines, as in previous chapters, but
as a sum of complex exponentials. The complex exponentials provide a more convenient and compact
way of expressing the Fourier series than the trigonometric form. It also allows the magnitude and phase
spectra to be easily calculated. This form is widely used by engineers, for example, in circuit theory and
control theory. This chapter explains how the trigonometric and exponential forms are equivalent.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
derive the exponential or complex form of a Fourier series
•
derive the complex coefﬁcients for a Fourier series
•
determine the complex Fourier series for a given function
•
deduce the complex coefﬁcient symmetry relationships
•
understand the frequency spectrum of a waveform
•
determine phasors in exponential form for various sinusoidal voltages
78.1
Introduction
The form used for the Fourier series in Chapters 73 to
77 consisted of cosine and sine terms. However, there is
another form that is commonly used – one that directly
gives the amplitudeterms in the frequencyspectrumand
relates to phasor notation. This form involves the use of
complex numbers (see Chapters 22 and 23). It is called
the exponential or complex form of a Fourier series.
78.2 Exponential or complex
notation
It was shown on page 270, equations (4) and (5) that:
ejθ = cosθ + j sinθ
(1)
and e−jθ = cosθ −j sinθ

Adding equations (1) and (2) gives:
ejθ + e−jθ = 2cosθ
from which,
cosθ = ejθ + e−jθ

(3)
Similarly, equation (1) – equation (2) gives:
ejθ −e−jθ = 2j sinθ
from which,
sinθ = ejθ −e−jθ

The Fourier coefﬁcients a0, an and bn may be replaced
by complex coefﬁcients c0, cn and c−n such that
c0 = a0
(6)
cn = an −jbn

(7)
and c−n = an + jbn

summation of the cn term when n=0. Thus,

n=0

(10)
The c−n term may be rewritten by changing the limits
n=1 to n=∞to n=−1 to n=−∞. Since n has been
made negative, the exponential term becomes e j 2πnx
L
and c−n becomes cn. Thus,
f (x) =

Since the summations now extend from −∞to −1 and
from 0 to +∞, equation (10) may be written as:

Equation (11) is the complex or exponential form of

Symmetry relationships
If even or odd symmetry is notedin a function,then time
can be saved in determining coefﬁcients.
The Fourier coefﬁcients present in the complex Fourier
series form are affected by symmetry. Summarising

The frequency spectrum
In the Fourier analysis of periodic waveforms seen
in previous chapters, although waveforms physically
exist in the time domain, they can be regarded as com-
prising components with a variety of frequencies. The
amplitude and phase of these components are obtained
from the Fourier coefﬁcients an and bn; this is known as
a frequency domain. Plots of amplitude/frequencyand
phase/frequency are together known as the spectrum
of a waveform. A simple example is demonstrated in
Problem 6, following.
Problem 6.
A pulse of height 20 and width 2 has a
period of 10. Sketch the spectrum of the waveform.

Figure 78.7 shows the corresponding plot of c n
against n.
Since cn is real (i.e. no j terms) then the phase must be
either 0◦or ±180◦, depending on the sign of the sine,
as shown in Figure 78.8.
When cn is positive, i.e. between n=−4 and n=+4,
angle αn = 0◦
When cn is negative, then αn =±180◦; between n=+6
and n=+9, αn is taken as +180◦, and between n=−6
and n=−9, αn is taken as −180◦

sinusoidal input and resulting sinusoidal currents and
voltages within the circuit.
It was shown in Chapter 15, page 171, that a general
sinusoidal voltage function can be represented by:
v = Vm sin(ωt + α)volts
(19)
where Vm is the maximum voltage or amplitude of the
voltage v, ω is the angular velocity (=2πf , where f is
the frequency), and α is the phase angle compared with
v =Vm sinωt
Similarly, a sinusoidal expression mayalsobe expressed
in terms of cosine as:
v = Vm cos(ωt + α)volts
(20)
It is quite complicated to add, subtract, multiply and
divide quantities in the time domain form of equations
(19) and (20). As an alternative method of analysis
a waveform representation called a phasor is used.
A phasor has two distinct parts – a magnitude and
an angle; for example, the polar form of a complex
number, say 5∠π/6, can represent a phasor, where 5
is the magnitude or modulus, and π/6 radians is the
angle or argument. Also, it was shown on page 270
that 5∠π/6 may be written as 5e jπ/6 in exponential
form.
In Chapter 23, equation (4), page 270, it is shown that:
ejθ = cosθ + j sinθ
(21)
which is known as Euler’s∗formula.
From equation (21),
ej(ωt+α) = cos(ωt + α) + j sin(ωt + α)
and
Vmej(ωt+α) = Vm cos(ωt + α)
+ jVm sin(ωt + α)
Thus a sinusoidal varying voltage such as in equa-
tion (19) or equation (20) can be considered to be either
the real or the imaginary part of Vm ej(ωt+α), depend-
ing on whether the cosine or sine function is being
considered.
Vm ej(ωt +α) may be rewritten as Vm ejωtejα since
am+n =am × an from the laws of indices, page 1.
The ejωt term can be considered to arise from the fact
that a radius is rotated with an angular velocity ω, and
α is the angle at which the radius starts to rotate at time
t =0 (see Chapter 15, page 171).
Thus, Vmejωtejα deﬁnes a phasor. In a particular cir-
cuit the angular velocity ω is the same for all the
elements thus the phasor can be adequately described
by Vm∠α, as suggested above.

Thus, v is the sum of two phasors, each with half the
amplitude, with one having a positive value of angular
velocity (i.e. rotating anticlockwise) and apositive value
of α, and the other having a negative value of angular
velocity (i.e. rotating clockwise) and a negative value of
α, as shown in Figure 78.9.

and
cne−jωnt

It can thus be considered that these terms represent pha-
sors, those with positives powers being phasors rotating
with a positive angular velocity (i.e. anticlockwise), and
those with negative powers being phasors rotating with
a negative angular velocity (i.e. clockwise).
In the above equations,
n=0 represents a non-rotatingcomponent,since e0 =1,
n=1 represents a rotating component with angular
velocity of 1ω,
n=2 represents a rotating component with angular
velocity of 2ω, and so on.
Thus we have a set of phasors, the algebraic sum of
which at some instant of time gives the magnitude of
the waveform at that time.

Z-Transforms


Chapter 79
An introduction to z-transforms
Why it is important to understand: An introduction to z-transforms
In mathematics and signal processing, the z-transform converts a discrete-timesignal, which is a sequence
of real or complex numbers, into a complex frequency domain representation. It can be considered as a
discrete-time equivalent of the Laplace transform.
Laplace transform methods are widely used for analysis in linear systems and are used when a system
is described by a linear differential equation, with constant coefﬁcients. However, there are numerous
systems that are described by difference equations - not differential equations - and these systems are
common and different from those described by differential equations.
Systems that satisfy difference equations include computer controlled systems - systems that take mea-
surements with digital input/output boards or GPIB instruments (digital 8-bit parallel communications
interface with data transfer rates up to 1 Mbyte/s), calculate an output voltage and output that voltage
digitally. Frequently these systems run a program loop that executes in a ﬁxed interval of time. Other
systems that satisfy difference equations are those systems with digital ﬁlters - which are found anywhere
digital signal processing/digital ﬁltering is undertaken - that includes digital signal transmission systems
like the telephone system or systems that process audio signals. A CD contains digital signal information,
and when it is read off the CD, it is initially a digital signal that can be processed with a digital ﬁlter.
There are an incredible number of systems used every day that have digital components which satisfy
difference equations. In continuous systems Laplace transforms play a unique role. They allow system
and circuit designers to analyse systems and predict performance, and to think in different terms - like
frequency responses - to help understand linear continuous systems. They are a very powerful tool that
shapes how engineers think about those systems. Z-transforms play the role in sampled systems that
Laplace transforms play in continuous systems. In sampled systems, inputs and outputs are related by
difference equations and z-transform techniques are used to solve those difference equations. In continu-
ous systems, Laplace transforms are used to represent systems with transfer functions, while in sampled
systems, z-transforms are used to represent systems with transfer functions.
This chapter merely provides an introduction to z-transforms – how to read z-transforms from a table,
to appreciate various properties of z-transforms, how to determine inverse z-transforms and how to solve
difference equations using z-transforms.
At the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
•
deﬁne the z-transform
•
prove z-transforms for simple sequences
•
use a table of z-transforms to determine simple transforms
•
understand the properties of z-transforms – linearity, ﬁrst and second shift theorems, translations, ﬁnal and
initial value theorems, and derivatives of transforms
•
use a table of z-transforms to determine inverse transforms
•
use z-transforms to solve difference equations

Using z-transforms to solve
difference equations
In Chapter 71, Laplace transforms were used to solve
differentialequations; in this section, the solution of dif-
ference equations using z-transforms is demonstrated.
Difference equations arise in a number of different
ways – sometimes from the direct modelling of systems
in discrete time, or as an approximation to a differential
equation describing the behaviour of a system modelled
as a continuous-time system. The z-transform method
is based on the ﬁrst shift theorem, (see earlier, page

the following problems.

Exercise 244 (page 715)
1. Expected frequencies: 7, 33, 65, 73, 48, 19, 4, 0;
χ2-value = 3.62, χ2
0.95,ν7 = 14.1, hence hypoth-
esis accepted. χ2
0.10,ν7 = 2.83, hence data is not
‘too good’
2. λ = 2.404; expected frequencies: 11, 27, 33,
26, 16, 8, 3 χ2-value = 42.24; χ2
0.95,ν6 = 12.6,
hence the data does not ﬁt a Poisson distribution
at a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05
3. x = 1.32,s = 0.0180;
expected

cies, 6, 17, 36, 55, 65, 55, 36, 17, 6;
χ2-value

χ2
0.95ν6 = 12.6,
hence
the
null
hypothesis
is
accepted,
i.e.
the
data
does
correspond
to
a
normal
distribution
4. λ = 0.896; expected frequencies are 102, 91, 41,
12, 3, 0, 0; χ2-value = 5.10; χ2
0.95,ν6 = 12.6,
hence this data ﬁts a Poisson distribution at a
level of signiﬁcance of 0.05
5. x = 10.09 MN; σ = 0.733 MN; expected fre-
quencies, 2, 5, 12, 16, 14, 8, 3, 1; χ2-
value = 0.563;χ2
0.95,ν5 = 11.1. Hence hypoth-
esis accepted. χ2
0.05,ν5 = 1.15, hence the results
are ‘too good to be true’
Exercise 245 (page 719)
1. H0 : t = 15h,H1 : t ̸= 15h S = 7. From Table
66.3, S ≤2, hence accept H0
2. S = 6. From Table 66.3, S ≤4, hence null
hypothesis accepted
3. H0: mean A = mean B, H1: mean A ̸= mean
B, S = 4. From Table 66.3, S ≤4, hence H1 is
accepted
Exercise 246 (page 723)
1. H0 : t = 220h,H1 : t ̸= 220h,T = 74. From Table
66.4, T ≤29, hence H0 is accepted
2. H0 : s = 150,H1 : s ̸= 150,T = 59.5. From Table
66.4, T ≤40, hence hypothesis H0 is accepted
3. H0 : N = R,H1 : N ̸= R,T = 5. From Table 66.4,
with n = 10 (since two differences are zero), T ≤8,
Hence there is a signiﬁcant difference in the drying
times
Exercise 247 (page 729)
1. H0 : TA = TB,H1 : TA ̸= TB,U = 30.
From
Table 66.5, U ≤17, hence accept H0, i.e. there
is no difference between the brands
2. H0 : B.S.A = B.S.B, H1 : B.S.A ̸= B.S.B, α2 =
10%, U = 28. From Table 66.5, U ≤15, hence
accept H0, i.e. there is no difference between the
processes
3. H0 : A = B,H1 : A ̸= B,α2 = 5%,U = 4.From
Table 66.5, U ≤8, hence null hypothesis is
rejected, i.e. the two methods are not equally
effective
4. H0 : meanA = meanB,
H1 : meanA ̸= meanB,
α2 = 5%, U = 90. From Table 66.5, U ≤99,
hence H0 is rejected and H1 accepted
