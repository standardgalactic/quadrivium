About the Author
Rik DeGunther attended the University of Illinois as an undergraduate and
Stanford University as a graduate student, studying both applied physics and
engineering economics (some of this education actually stuck!). Over the course
of an engineering career, he worked as a project engineer, project manager, and
product designer. He holds several United States patents and has designed a
wide range of technical equipment, including solar power systems, military
radar jammers, weather measurement equipment, high-powered vacuum tubes,
computerized production hardware, golf practice devices, digital and analog
electronic circuits, unmanned aerial vehicles, guitars and amplifiers, microwave
filters and mixers, automatic cabinet openers, strobe light communications
systems, explosive devices (strictly on accident), cloud height sensors, fog
sensors, furniture, houses, barns, rocket ships, dart throwers, flame throwers,
eavesdropping devices, escape routes, nefarious capers, and you name it. He’s
one of those nerdy guys who likes to take things apart to see how they work and
then put them back together and try to figure out what the leftover parts are for.
Rik is CEO of Efficient Homes, an energy efficiency auditing firm in Northern
California. He is actively engaged in designing and developing new solar
equipment, including off-grid lighting systems and off-grid swimming pool
heaters. He writes weekly op-ed columns for the Mountain Democrat, California’s
oldest and most venerable newspaper. He has also written a golf book (on
putting) and spends most of his free time attempting to improve his relatively
impressive but objectively droll golf handicap, usually to no avail. Sometimes
the urge strikes him to play a very loud guitar, of which he owns a collection
with far more intrinsic quality than the playing they receive. His hearing has
been faltering the last few years, so he rebuilt his amplifier to go up to eleven.


Dedication
Of course, this book is dedicated to Katie, Erik, and Ally. Without them, the
sun would not shine at all, and this work of art wouldn’t exist.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Many thanks to all those who have contributed to the material in this book,
whether wittingly or not: Dick and Betty DeGunther, Professor Mitchell
Weissbluth, Professor A.J. Fedro, Professor Lamb, John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
Leland Stanford, Mike Pearcy, Jordan Cobb, Eric Micko, Vikki Berenz, Connie
Cowan, Betsy Sanders, Jim DeGunther, Sarah Nephew, Freddie Mercury, Dave

on the tricks of the solar trade. Thanks to Dr. Keith Kennedy and Watkins-Johnson
Company for showing restraint above and beyond the call of duty. And thanks
to John Steinbeck for making me understand what’s important and what’s not,

Thanks to the excellent crew at Wiley: Mike Baker, Kelly Ewing (who not only
midwifed this book with grace and patience but also had a baby of her own
during the process). Danielle Voirol, the copy editor, vastly improved the
quality of this book. She asked insightful questions and corrected my awkward
prose so that everybody thinks I’m a much better writer than I really am.
Wiley is fortunate to have her on their staff, but the reader is the real winner in
the deal. Thanks to technical editor Greg Raffio for his excellent and well-received
insights and for generously giving his time to both myself and Wiley. And
thanks to Stephany Evans at Imprint Agency for getting all the ducks in a row.
Last but not least, thanks to all the For Dummies fans out there who have
made the series what it is today.

Introduction
S
olar Power Your Home For Dummies can help you turn your inspirations
into reality without losing your shirt or your sanity. With this book —
and with some good, hard work and perseverance on your part — you can
achieve the laudable goal of installing solar power equipment at your home.
About This Book
This book provides you with an ample solar knowledge base and lets you apply
that info through do-it-yourself projects — or through hiring others to do the
work for you. I use plain English to the extent possible, breaking complex tech-
nical concepts down into bite-sized pieces. But my goal is always to help you
navigate the maze of solar technology as efficiently and sensibly as possible.
Every house is different. Climates are different, even in areas separated by a
couple of miles. Markets are evolving, suppliers are changing, and technology
is constantly evolving. Sometimes you’re going to have to make your own deci-
sions, and I can give you only the pertinent information you need to make the
best one. Or in some cases, all I can do is point you toward the information
sources you need to consult. But you can find the essentials here, tailor them
to your own situation, and get a solar system that really works for you.
Conventions Used in This Book
For simplicity’s sake, this book follows a few conventions:
 Italicized terms are immediately followed by definitions.
 Bold indicates the action parts in numbered steps. It also emphasizes
the keywords in a bulleted list.
 Web addresses show up in monofont.
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to
break across two lines of text. Rest assured that I haven’t put in any extra
characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. Just type in exactly
what you see in this book, pretending as though the line break didn’t
exist.

Foolish Assumptions
Here are some things I assume about you:
 You want to add a solar component to your home. I assume that 
you’ve already decided to move but aren’t really sure which is the best
direction or the best speed. You want to make the right decisions, and
you understand those decisions are entirely yours to make
 You have some do-it-yourself skills. You — or whoever’s helping you
install the equipment — can handle a screwdriver and power drill. You
may know the basics of plumbing or electrical work.
 You want to get things done as efficiently and sensibly as possible.
(Note I didn’t say quickly, because that leads to errors in both judgment
and facilitation.) You don’t necessarily have an engineering degree, and
you don’t want to know every technical detail concerning the various
solar technologies
 You need working knowledge of a project so that you can hire profes-
sionals and discuss matters with them. You don’t plan on handling a
major project yourself, but you want enough information to make
informed decisions.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has seven parts. Without further ado, here are the parts of the
book and what they contain.
Part I: Playing the Energy Game
In this part, you find info on doing a home energy audit so that you can under-
stand exactly how and where you use energy in your home. I also give you a
guide to making improvements in your house so your energy consumption’s
more efficient.
Part II: Understanding Solar — 
Just the Facts, Ma’am
For most users, this part may be the most difficult to read because the tech-
nical and financial concepts can be elusive. Hang in there — understanding
2
Solar Power Your Home For Dummies 

the nuts and bolts can make it easier to make the right decisions later on.
After you get through the preliminaries, I help you decide which direction 
is best for you, and then you’re on your way.
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- 
and Medium-Sized Projects
This part dives into solar power projects that you can start with right now,
today. I describe a lot of interesting and useful little gadgets and small systems
that can make your life easier and more fun. Regardless of how ambitious your
solar aspirations may be, this is a good place to start
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting 
a Little Help from Your Friends
Part IV gets into larger projects that cost more money. I give advice on deciding
whether to do a project yourself or to hire a contractor, and I give advice on
how to hire someone. Greenhouses and solar rooms have some fundamentals
that are consistent with all projects that you need to understand, so I cover the
basics of what you need to know. I also detail how to specify a large-scale PV
system and how to find and hire a contractor to do the installation for you.
Going off-grid is sometimes necessary, and sometimes it’s just a compelling
desire to get away from it all — I tell you how best to do it and under what 
circumstances it’s merited.
Part V: Building and Selling 
Your Solar Home
In Part V, I give a broad range of advice on how to value a solar home, whether
you’re on the buying or selling end. And I tell you how best to find a bare lot
and develop your dream of building your own solar home.
Part VI: Finding the Moolah to Do the Job
This part isn’t about solar energy and the cool equipment you can buy and
install, but dealing with finances is a necessary evil. Many solar projects are
expensive, and you may not even consider doing them unless you can get the
money you need. Check out this part to find out how best to find and procure
financing for your solar projects.

Introduction

Part VII: The Part of Tens
Like every For Dummies book, the Part of Tens includes quick resources 
that provide plenty of information and sage advice compacted into few words.
Above all, this part demonstrates that you aren’t alone. Gain wisdom from
other solar energy enthusiasts’ trials and errors.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book can quickly steer you to the information you need.
Here’s what they stand for:
The Tip indicates a paragraph that elaborates on a nifty little shortcut or
frustration-saver.
This icon should never be ignored. It points out things that can potentially
harm you or your project. Remember: A successful project relies on many
factors, both economic and practical, but the most important gauge of a suc-
cessful project is that nobody gets hurt!
The Technical Stuff icon lets you know that some particularly nerdy, technoid
information is coming up so you can skip it if you want. (On the other hand, if
you want to read it, you don’t actually have to be a nerd — just able to read.)
This icon highlights important information to store in your brain for quick
recall at a later time.
Where to Go from Here
Attitude is the one and only thing you have complete control over in your
life. Projects rarely, if ever, go the way you envisioned when you were draw-
ing up the plans. As a lifelong practitioner of projects big and small, I’ve
learned to be patient and enjoy the road every bit as much as the destina-
tion. When you run into problems — which you will — smile and take a step
back and come up with a witty joke. The harder a project is, the more reward-
ing it’ll be when it’s finished. I can pretty much guarantee that you’re going to
find out precisely what I’m talking about.

Part I
Playing the Energy
Game

In this part . . .
You may be ready to go solar, but first you need to
take a look at how you use energy in your household
and how your energy bill is measured and calculated.
Solar investments can save you money and make your life
more comfortable, but part of the process is understanding
exactly what types of solar investments you should make —
and how big they should be. Here, I show you how to
systematically dissect your energy bills and how to look
around your house to find all kinds of energy conservation
measures to reduce your energy bill even before you invest
in solar.

Chapter 1
Helping the World through 
Solar Power
In This Chapter
 Investing in solar energy
 Looking at the benefits of solar power
 Solving for challenges
P
roducing energy can be dirty work. Carbon emissions, coal slurry,
nuclear waste, and other pollutants can wreak havoc on the environ-
ment, cause health problems, and make people hopping mad. And many
energy sources are in limited supply. Not only does that drive prices up, but
it also leads to political conflicts when people decide they’re not willing to
share. You’re probably not ready to go completely unplugged, but you do
want to play your humble part to save the environment, help the country
become less dependent on outside energy sources, and save money. Tall
order? Maybe not. Above all the energy sources in use today, solar shows the
most long-term promise for solving the world’s energy problems.
On any given day, 35,000 times the total amount of energy that humans use
falls onto the face of the Earth from the sun. If people could just tap into a
tiny fraction of what the sun is providing each day, society would be set. Of
course, some problems do crop up, but they’re solvable, and going solar can
be well worth the effort.
To understand the role solar energy can play in your home, you need to have
a good understanding of where your own energy comes from, where it’s used,
and how much pollution each of your energy sources generates. In this chap-
ter, I explain how solar fits into your day-to-day life — and why it’s such a good
energy option.

Looking for Sustainable Energy
The words renewable and sustainable are being knocked around quite a bit, 
and both are strongly associated with energy conservation. Renewable forms
of energy constantly replenish themselves with little or no human effort. Solar
energy is just one example — no matter how much you use, the supply will
never end (okay, it may end after billions of years, but your using solar power
won’t make the sun burn out any faster). Other examples of renewables include
firewood, water (through hydroelectric dams), and wind power. Note, however,
that firewood is notoriously polluting; the term renewable does not necessarily
imply good environmentalism. Firewood also has another potentially severe
drawback in that people go out into forests and cut down trees, often without
much thought to the overall health of the forest (a good example of not
seeing the forest from the trees).
To make sure that resources last, humans need to focus on conservation, recy-
cling, environmental restoration, and renewable energy sources. Sustainability
is commonly associated with such a holistic approach to personal lifestyle. Not
only are sustainable forms of energy renewable, but they also have the ability
to keep the planet Earth’s ecosystem up and running, in perpetuity. Sustainable
energy, such as solar, is nonpolluting to the greatest extent possible. The basic
notion behind sustainable energy sources is that by their use, society is not
compromising future generations’ health and well-being, nor their ability to use
their own sustainable resources to any less capacity than we have. Who can
argue with this very fundamental version of the Golden Rule?

Part I: Playing the Energy Game 
Consuming the Earth
Here are some statistics about power use in the
United States (from DOE):
 Americans import more than half their fossil
fuels. Thirty years ago, this figure was only
33 percent, and analysts predict that within
a few years, it’ll rise to 66 percent.
 Of all the energy used in the United States, 39
percent comes from oil, 23 percent from nat-
ural gas, 24 percent from coal, 6 percent from
hydropower dams, 7 percent from nuclear, and
only 1 percent from renewables such as solar
energy.
 Americans get 51 percent of their electrical
production from coal, 20 percent from nuclear,
18 percent from natural gas, 2 percent from
petroleum, and only around 9 percent from
renewables, of which the vast majority is
hydro (water). Solar plus wind accounts for
only around 0.18 percent of the grand total.

Understanding Why Solar Is King
Solar power has historically been more expensive than other energy options,
but that’s changing fast because of government investment in technologies,
as well as the simple fact that many more people are investing in solar, which
results in economies of scale. Solar energy equipment increases your finan-
cial standing in basically two ways:
 Savings on your monthly bills.
 Appreciation of your home’s value.
The following sections cover reasons why solar is a great investment, both
financially and environmentally.
Reaping financial rewards
Solar is an investment; you must actively go out and purchase solar equipment
and install it at your home. However, after the initial costs, not only do you
save money from lowering your energy bill, but you also may see the value 
of your home increase.
Comparing savings
So how does investing in solar compare to other investments, such as the
stock market, a savings account, or a new kitchen?
To compare, you need to calculate your payback period. Payback period is a
measure of how long it takes to recoup your upfront investment with the costs
you save. If you install a solar water heater system for $4,000 and it saves you
$50 a month on your power bill, the system will pay for itself in 80 months, or
62⁄3 years. (Though you may easily cut that time in half if the price of oil sky-
rockets and utility rates double, for example, during a war in the Middle East.)
Now consider other ways you can spend that money. With investments in
remodeling, such as a new kitchen, you get no monthly cost reductions at all
unless you’re installing new appliances that are more energy-efficient. If you
put the same $4,000 into an interest-bearing bank account, you may get $20 a
month in interest. After 80 months, you’d make $2,000 in compounded inter-
est, or half your investment. And if you put the same money into the stock
market, you may enjoy a return of $3,400. Of course, you can also lose the
entire thing and drive yourself nuts with regret!

Chapter 1: Helping the World through Solar Power

To play it safe, choose a variety of investments and decide how much you
want to put toward solar power. Stock portfolio managers consider hedging
an important facet of a good portfolio.
In short, if you install solar, you’ll be relatively risk free from exploding
energy costs.
Showing a little appreciation
When you go solar, your home appreciates. Realtors can give you statistics
that estimate how much the value will go up, given the type of investment
and the area you live in.
According to the National Association of Real Estate Appraisers (NAREA), 
for every dollar you save annually in energy costs with solar equipment, the
value of your home increases by up to 20 times your annual energy savings,
depending on the type of system you install. For a solar water heater invest-
ment of $4,000, the value of your home may increase by at least that much!
How can this be? Solar is catching on, and homebuyers are willing to pay
more for solar homes that promise energy savings.
Erasing your carbon footprint
Most energy resources are burned. The worst offender is coal, and the United
States gets around 50 percent of its electrical power from coal-fired plants.
Your carbon dioxide footprint is a measure of how much carbon dioxide you’re
releasing into the environment by virtue of your energy-consuming habits. 
A typical carbon dioxide footprint is around 36,000 pounds (18 tons) per year.
That’s a lot!
10
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 
You don’t have to spend a million 
bucks: Finding financing
Right now, a wide range of government and
industry programs are available to help you
finance your solar investments. Governments are
giving out tax breaks, utilities are offering rebates,
and low-interest loans are available for solar
investments. The net effect is to make your solar
projects less expensive and more attractive on
the bottom line.
In Chapters 21 and 22, I show you how to find 
the right resources and how to work with the
various agencies that you’ll need to interact with.

Solar, however, has no carbon footprint. For each kilowatt-hour (kWh) 
of energy-generating capacity you install with solar, you’ll save that much
from other sources, most likely the electrical power grid. No other alternative
energy resource can offer this impact except wind power and hydro, but
solar is far more versatile and widely available.
These numbers are valuable for calculating cost versus gain for installing solar
systems because — face it — even though pollution isn’t costing you directly
in your wallet, you need to factor it into your thinking.
When you generate solar electricity, you don’t need transmission lines and all
the associated inefficiency. Solar is right there, where you use it. When you
install a 3kWh active solar system, you’re offsetting the need for that much
power from your utility company. But you’re saving about 9kWh of total power
consumption because of inefficiencies. Therefore, you’re actually saving much
more than 3kWh, as well as the associated carbon footprint.
Table 1-1 can help you calculate your own carbon footprint.

Chapter 1: Helping the World through Solar Power

To find how much carbon dioxide you produce by using home fossil fuels,
multiply the amount of fuel you use by the value in the second column, the
pounds of CO2 per unit. For example, suppose you use 400 gallons of home
heating oil; you produce 8,960 pounds of carbon dioxide per year:
400 gal/yr × 22.4 lbs. CO2/gal = 8,960 lbs. CO2/yr.
And here’s your carbon emissions for the 50 gallons of liquid propane you
may use for your barbecue:
50 gal./yr × 12.7 lbs. CO2/gal = 635 lbs. CO2/yr
And here’s the footprint for using 1 ton of firewood in a year:
1 ton/yr × 3,814 lbs. CO2/ton = 3,814 lbs. CO2/yr
Add those together, and your home fossil fuel consumption produces 13,409
pounds of carbon dioxide per year. Ouch! You can cut way down on that if
you switch to solar heating and cooking.
Then calculate your carbon emissions from electricity use. This number
depends on how your local power generators operate. Nuclear reactors emit
very little carbon, and coal-fired generators emit quite a bit. The average North
American value is 1.33 pounds of CO2 per kWh. If you’re using nuclear energy,
you can reduce this number to about 1.0 or less. If you’re strictly relying on
coal-fired electricity, the number could go as high as 2.0. Here’s how you find
out the carbon dioxide output if you use 10,000 kWh of energy:
10,000 kWh/yr × 1.33 lbs. CO2/kWh = 40,000 lbs. CO2/yr (Youch!)
Enjoying solar’s unlimited supply
At sea level, on a sunny, clear day, 1 kWh of sunlight power is falling onto a 
1-square-meter surface. Over the course of a sunny day, you can realistically
expect to capture around 6 kWh of total energy from this same surface area.
That’s 180 kWh per month. Five square meters is enough to completely
replace a typical monthly power bill! If only it was so easy.
If you were to build an active solar panel measuring 100 miles by 100 miles in
sunny Nevada (where you can get plenty of government land for free), you’d
be able to produce enough power to handle all the United States’ electrical
requirements (except when it rained a lot!).
12
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

Exercising your legal rights to sunlight
You have legal rights to your sunlight; nobody can build up so that your solar
exposures are affected. Government acknowledges value in the amount of
sunlight that hits your home.
You have a legal right to demand that your neighbors remove trees and other
impediments to your solar access. If a neighbor’s trees are shading your prop-
erty, you can do something about it. Remember though, this right goes both
ways. If you’re shading somebody else’s property, he or she can force you to
remedy the situation. Check with your local governments to see what sorts of
laws apply to your specifics.
Appreciating solar energy’s versatility
You can use solar energy in many ways, each with different costs and com-
plexity. Later chapters and the upcoming section titled “Small to Supergiant:
Choosing Your Level of Commitment” talk about some projects you can tackle.
But for now, consider that solar power lets you do any of the following:
 Generate electricity for general use: You can install a solar electric 
generating system that allows you to reduce your electric bills to zero.
(See Chapter 17.)
 Cook: Using the sun and your vivid imagination, along with a few easy-
to-build ovens and heaters, solar power can help you put dinner on the
table. (See Chapter 9.)
 Practice passive space heating: The sun can heat your house by strate-
gic use of blinds, awnings, sunrooms and the like. (See Chapters 9, 13,
and 16.)
 Heat water: Use solar energy to heat your domestic water supply — 
or let sun-warmed water heat your house. You may need no electrical
pumps or moving parts other than the water itself. (See Chapters 10, 
11, and 12.)
 Pump water: You can slowly pump water into a tank when the sun is
shining and then get the water back anytime you want. You can also
make your tank absorb sunlight and heat the water. (See Chapter 14.)
 Heat your swimming pool: You can cover your pool with a solar blanket
to heat it cheaply and efficiently. Or you can install solar hot water heating
panels on your roof that can heat your pool year round.
13
Chapter 1: Helping the World through Solar Power

 Add landscape lighting: You can put small, inexpensive solar lights
around your yard and eliminate the need for high-priced overhead lighting
powered by the utility company. With advances in technology, these lights
actually look and work better than hard-wired versions.
 Provide indoor lighting: The technological boom in light-emitting diodes
(LEDs) — small, electronic lights that take very little current and provide
long lifetimes — has enabled a number of effective solar lighting systems
for in-home use with very low power requirements. You can light your
porches and even rooms in your house with a small, off-grid photovoltaic
system connected to a battery. During the day, the battery charges so that
you have enough juice at night to do the job.
 Power remote dwellings: You can completely power a remote cabin, 
RV, or boat with solar. (See Chapter 14.)
Acknowledging the Dents in the Crown
Sounds great! You’re ready to go! But solar isn’t all fun and games. The pros
outweigh the cons — especially when you look at the big picture — but you
should still understand the drawbacks. This section explains a few things to
remember when working with solar energy.
Initial costs and falling prices
Going solar requires an upfront expense. When you go solar, you get a good
payback on your investment, but you do have to put out cash upfront. Most
people don’t want to bother, and many don’t have the cash.
Reliability and timing
Solar works only when the sun is shining. If you want energy at night or on 
a dark day in the winter, you need either batteries or other energy resources.
What makes sense in Arizona doesn’t necessarily make sense in Seattle,
Washington. Ultimately, solar relies on Mother Nature’s generosity, and this
varies from region to region. In fact, it even varies over different locations at
your home.
Also, timing of energy use is everything. In a typical scenario, solar energy
availability is at its peak when the household power demands are minimal.
It’s out of phase with need. This scenario isn’t much of a problem with solar
water heaters because they inherently store the energy for later use. But
solar electric requires either batteries for energy storage or a special system
14
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

called an intertie, which connects to your public utility. In Chapter 14, 
I explain the technical details of an intertie system.
For example, Figure 1-1 shows the typical residential energy requirements
and the energy production of a solar system.
On this typical winter day, the heater is on all night but turned low, and the
lights and appliances are off. In the morning, the family turns up the heater,
turns on lights, takes hot showers, cooks breakfast, and gets ready for school
and work. Then everybody leaves, and the day warms up so the heater shuts
down. At the end of the afternoon, when the sun is on its way down, everybody
returns. Lights are turned on, the heater’s turned up, a log is tossed into the
fireplace, cooking begins in earnest, the kids play video games and make a big
mess, the vacuum is run, and so on.
Red tape and aesthetically 
minded neighbors
You may have to work around building codes. Bureaucrats are a big hassle,
and interfacing with government agencies is frustrating. In addition, only
qualified contractors should install complex electrical systems.
Also, most solar panels are ugly. Nobody wants to look at them. If they’re
your own and you’re benefiting, it’s acceptable. If they belong to your neigh-
bors, it’s a different story. In some communities, solar panels are forbidden.
Many CC&Rs prohibit solar panels altogether, but this situation is changing;

in fact, most legal challenges to solar panels are being stricken by the courts
in favor of environmental conscience. At some point, the federal government
will likely enter the picture and prohibit all banning of solar panels. Several
ongoing efforts are working to make solar panels less obtrusive, so this 
problem will become less important over time.
Effort and upkeep
Going solar takes work. Making good decisions about solar power can be
difficult unless you’ve done your homework. And not only do you have to do
some research, but you also have to work with the equipment itself. Here are
some issues to consider:
 You face some dangers. Active systems can shock you if you don’t know
what you’re doing. Water heating systems can scald you. You’re much
safer sitting in front of your TV than climbing around installing solar
equipment.
 You face equipment challenges in freezing weather. Solar water 
heating panels can freeze up in the winter. You have to pay attention to
how they’re working. Most new solar thermal heating systems get around
the freezing problem by using some form of anti-freeze, but there are still
a good number of existing and new systems that still use water. The anti-
freeze systems are more expensive, and if you don’t need one you will not
want to pay the extra cost, so there will always be water-based systems
available.
 You’re on your own for upkeep and repairs. If you get your power from
the power company, keeping things maintained and running is its prob-
lem. If you have a big array of solar panels on your roof, it’s your problem.
If they break, you pay. When they get old, you update.
Small to Supergiant: Choosing 
Your Level of Commitment
No matter where you start, you can always expand your solar system. For
example, you can invest in a small photovoltaic system for your rooftop and
then expand it as you go, spreading the investment costs over a long period
of time. Read on for ways to get involved.

In Part III, I detail a wide range of simple, straightforward solar projects avail-
able to the do-it-yourselfers. From installing landscape lighting to a standalone
photovoltaic powered attic vent fan, you can begin investing in solar today
with minimal cost and effort. The small-scale projects feature safe operating
levels (typical voltages in a photovoltaic system are so low that you won’t be
able to get a shock). And if you’re no good with tools, have no fear. Some of the
projects don’t even require a screwdriver — you can buy off-the-shelf solutions
that you can use out of the box.
You can also do a number of things in your yard to improve the solar exposure
of your home. Deciduous trees (which shed their leaves in the fall) planted
strategically about your house can ensure summertime cooling while allowing
solar energy to help warm your house in the winter. Planting bushes in the
right spots can reduce the cooling effect of wind, especially around your pool.
And you can also increase the breezes flowing through your house by strategi-
cally arranging trees and bushes. Chapter 8 shows you how.
In Chapter 9, I describe a wide range of small-sized solar investments you 
can enjoy right now. Some of these projects, such as the attic vent fan, can
save you money. It can keep your attic cooler in the summer and lower your
air-conditioning bill. And some of the projects — such as the swimming pool
light ball — are just plain fun. You can even build a solar oven that’ll cook
almost everything you cook in your kitchen stove!
Chapters 10, 11, and 12 explain how you can use the sun to heat water and
how you can put it to work in your home. Installing a solar heating system 
on your swimming pool is a reasonable do-it-yourself project with very real
results, not just in terms of costs saved but also added enjoyment. Installing
a water heating system for your domestic supply gets a little trickier, and it’s
a project usually contracted out to the pros. But if you’re good with tools,
you can probably install one on your own.
If you’re intending to install a full-scale solar energy system in your home, 
a great way to find out about the character of solar energy is to start with the
simpler projects. You discover the importance of good solar exposure, and you
determine when and how solar works the best — as well as the worst. You’ll be
in a better position to make good decisions on how to invest the big bucks
when the time comes.

Chapter 1: Helping the World through Solar Power

Large projects
In Part IV, I describe the larger projects that are wise choices for solar invest-
ment. Full-scale photovoltaic energy generators are the king of the mountain
these days. You probably won’t be able to install one of these systems on your
own. I tell you how to research the available options and decide which is best
for your needs. And I tell you how to find and choose the right contractor for
the job.
Greenhouses are attractive, and you can grow your own food in them, year-
round in some climates. But you can also use a greenhouse or sunroom to
heat your home in the winter. In Chapter 16, I show some examples of the
most popular greenhouse projects.
Off-grid living means there’s no utility company power coming into your home
at all. You can use a solar power system, backed up with a gasoline-powered
generator, to provide all the power you’ll ever need. In Chapter 18, I describe
the things you need to keep in mind if you decide to take this plunge. It’s not
for everybody, and it really doesn’t make much sense unless you’re living so
far away from the utilities that just running the lines to your house would cost
a ton. But for some of the more independent-minded readers, it’s the only way
to go.
Designing a solar home from scratch
Designing a solar home from scratch is clearly the most efficient way to
achieve solar energy advantages. Most existing homes are inefficient in a
number of ways. Insulation may be lacking. Sunlight exposure was not thought
out — it’s just what happened when the house was built on the lot. But when
you design your own home, you can control all the variables. You can achieve
excellent sunlight in the morning while blocking off the afternoon heat. You 
can shelter for wind by taking advantage of existing trees and cover. Best of 
all, you can build your roof to achieve perfect solar exposure.
You can also ensure energy efficiency by using the right materials and building
techniques. The fact is, a good house design can make it so that you don’t need
much energy at all. What could be better for the environment?

I
love moving forward and getting things done because I’m impatient and I
want to see some results. I like pounding nails and gluing stuff together
(although I don’t like pounding my thumb, or gluing my pants to the work-
bench). But before you start the fun stuff, you need to do a little research
first. Why? Investing in solar energy is expensive, and once it’s in place,
you’re stuck with what you’ve got. You can’t put it back into its box and
return it to the store, so you need to make sure that your decisions are
sound.
It’s much cheaper, marginally, to invest in energy conservation measures for
your home before you invest in solar. Furthermore, most people don’t have a
good handle on where and how they’re using energy. When you invest in
solar power, you’re called on to decide, very specifically, what type of system
to install and how much it’s worth in both monetary and labor costs (your
labor costs, once the system is in). By studying the details of your own
household and how you consume energy, you’ll be well along the way to
making wise solar investment decisions.
I use a friend of mine as an example in this chapter. His fictitious name is Bill
Toomuch. He and his small family live on a 5-acre ranch, all electric, in a
2,700-square-foot house. There’s an above-ground swimming pool and a hot
tub. Water is supplied by a well. Analyzing Bill Toomuch demonstrates how
to go about systematically analyzing your own situation. (Plus, it’s fun to spy
on other people and get into their private details.)

Dissecting Your Energy Bills
How, when, and where do you use energy? And why? Looking at nationwide
statistics will give you a baseline to compare your energy usage to. Does it
make sense, or can you make changes? Should you make changes? Most
people are surprised when they find out exactly how much and where they’re
spending their hard-earned cash on energy.
As the saying goes, “The devil is in the details.” In this section, I present a
detailed system for analyzing your energy use.
Collecting the data
The first thing you need to do is collect a stack of power bills if you don’t
already have them. Call your utility company to see whether it’ll send you
copies of your past power bills going back a few years. Most utilities don’t
charge for this service, and some may even do data analysis for you. Ask
when you call. The company may even offer other services, such as a free
home energy audit.
Some of you may be lucky enough to get your utility to graphically plot your
data for you, as well as give you some handy analysis pointers. Ask whether
this service is available.
You also need to collect records of all expenses even remotely related to your
energy consumption. If you don’t have records, recreate them as best you
can. Don’t worry — recreating can serve your purposes just fine. The most
important point is to be complete; leaving something out is much worse than
approximating the data for items that you do include. Here’s a sampling of
what you may want on this list:
 Wood and fuel: List anything you burn for heat, light, or cooking — 
firewood, manufactured logs (such as Duraflame), wood pellets, 
bio-energy products, charcoal, propane, gasoline for lawn tools or 
a generator, kerosene for lanterns or cooking or heating, and so on.
 Collection and transportation: Include the costs of gathering and trans-
porting any fuels. Don’t forget costs of gas cans; chainsaws, saw blades,
or wood splitters for firewood; or propane tanks for the grill.
 Rental fees: Include rental fees for your propane tank, power generator,
or any other items you don’t actually own.
 Equipment purchases: Collect cost information for any new barbecues,
water heaters, space heaters, dehumidifiers, portable air conditioners,
swamp coolers (evaporative coolers), general HVAC systems, power gen-
erators, and so on.
20
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

 Repairs and maintenance: Note what you spend on maintaining and
repairing equipment such as woodstoves. Figure out how much HVAC fil-
ters cost you.
 Household items: Estimate how much you spend on items such as can-
dles and batteries.
Divvying up costs, month by month
Allocating all your energy costs on a month-by-month basis is usually a
straightforward process. Your best bet is to take several years’ worth of data
and find the average for each month. In other words, add the last two or
three years’ worth of February data and then divide by two or three to get
your monthly average. In this way, you’ll average out seasonal weather varia-
tions and other changes, such as vacations.
Keep in mind that you don’t need to split hairs in this analysis. Just by ana-
lyzing your usage in a systematic way, you’ll come to understand your energy
picture much better. It’s the structure of the analysis that’s more important
than the details.
Note: Many utilities do what’s called averaging, where they don’t actually
read your meter every month. They come out periodically and read it and
then average it over a few months. If this is the case, you can still get a good
understanding of your energy habits, but some of the detail is lost. If you feel
the need, call the company and ask how your bill is structured.
For other items, figuring out monthly costs can be more challenging. You
want to divide up costs so that they reflect how much you use a certain
energy source in each month. For example, if you have a propane tank that’s
filled periodically by the propane company, you may have a tough time figur-
ing out the monthly usage. Just get the yearly total and divide that up on a
monthly basis. Your estimates will be very good. If you use the propane only
for heat, allocate the cost to those months in which you use heat. If you use
some for hot water and some for heat, divide it up as best you can. Make sure
that the yearly total comes out right. Ditto with firewood and all the associ-
ated expenses. Most people buy a big stack once a year. How much did you
use each month? Divvy up the costs.
Servicing for equipment should likewise be allocated (by month) according
to the use of that equipment. For example, if you service your heater in July
for $240, it only makes sense to assign that $240 to those months when you
use heat. If you service only once every three years, allocate the costs
accordingly. Once again, don’t worry if you’re not perfect. Just do the best
you can and you’ll see that it’s good enough.
21
Chapter 2: Surveying Your Household Energy Efficiency and Use

For large equipment expenditures, accountants use a term called 
depreciation. Here’s how it works:
1. Determine initial costs.
For example, perhaps a gas fireplace costs $4,000 plus 7 percent sales
tax, with another $200 for permits and inspection. The total is $4,480.
2. Estimate how much that equipment increased the value of your home.
A gas fireplace may increase the value by $2,500. The best way to find
out how much an investment affects the value of your home is to consult
with a realtor or an appraiser. But you’ll probably find that your own
estimate is close enough, although most people are guilty of great gen-
erosity when it comes to this calculation. Just be reasonable.
3. Subtract the increase in value from the initial costs to get the net cost
of the equipment.
The net cost of the fireplace is $4,480 – $2,500, or $1,980.
4. Estimate the lifetime of the equipment in terms of months.
The fireplace should be usable for ten years, or 120 months. When you
buy the fireplace, ask the store for a number and then multiply this
amount by about 80 percent to account for generosity. (The store 
does want to sell you a fireplace, after all.) Another way you can esti-
mate this figure is to simply use the lifetime of the equipment you’re
replacing as a basis. If you’re replacing a 10-year-old fireplace, use 
10 years for the estimated cost of the one you’re selling.
5. Divide the net cost by the lifetime of the equipment to calculate the
monthly depreciation.
Dividing $1,980 by 120 tells you that the fireplace costs $16.50 per
month.
For an even more accurate picture, allocate the cost of the fireplace to
only the winter months. For example, you use the fireplace only over the
six months from October through March. Dividing the yearly cost ($198)
by 6 tells you that the fireplace costs $33 per month in October through
March and $0 per month in April through September.
Checking out a sample electric bill
The best way to illustrate how to do an energy survey is to use Bill Toomuch
as an example. Figure 2-1 shows a typical sample from Bill Toomuch’s utility
bills. Here’s a list of some of his energy costs:
 His utility company is PG&E, in Northern California.
 He uses 3 gallons of gasoline a month in lawnmowers, leaf blowers, and
so on. That’s around $8 per month, year round.
22
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

 He uses $15 per month in propane for his barbecue, and because he’s in
sunny California, the usage is consistent over the course of the year.
 His HVAC system broke down, and it cost $267 to fix. A repair this size is
typically done once every two years, so the monthly cost is around $11.
 In the winter months, he burned manufactured logs in an old fireplace
and estimated the costs as follows: January $62, February $60, March
$35, April $10, October $10, November $62, and December $96
(Christmas cheer!).
 Bill’s wife loves candles; she spends about $20 per month on them.
 He spends $23 per month in batteries for remotes, flashlights, sprinkler
controllers, and so on.
Bill’s home is all electric, so that makes up the lion’s share of his total energy
cost. Bill called his utility company and got four years’ worth of history,
broken down by month.
The billing date is from 1/12/2007 through 2/12/2007. The total for the bill is
$403.30. (Kilowatt-hours) of usage is 2,311. (Just for interest, the average
daily cost is $13.) Adding the expenditures from the miscellaneous items I list
earlier, Bill’s total energy bill for this period is $547. Ouch! Somebody’s not
turning the lights off when they leave the room (Bill has two kids).
On your own power bill, note your rate structure. For most people, this step
is easy. The cost per kWh stays the same, no matter how much power they
use. Some people, however, are billed on a tiered system, which basically
means that their rates go up the more energy they use. Other rate structures
may include time-of-use (TOU), which means you pay more during peak
hours.
In Bill Toomuch’s case, there’s a baseline usage rate for the first 530.4 kWh at
$0.11430. (I didn’t even know a thousandth of a penny existed!) For 101 to 130
percent of that baseline (up to 689.52 kWh), the rate goes up to $0.12989 —
not much of an increase. From 131 to 200 percent of baseline usage (up to
1,060 kWh) costs $0.22944, and 201 to 300 percent (up to 1,591.2 kWh) costs
$0.32146 per kWh. This latter rate is nearly three times the base rate — quite
a penalty Usage over 300 percent is even more punitive, and so on.
Finding costs per kWh
Electric bills often list the cost per kWh, but when you factor in all the extra
fees power companies charge you, the price per kWh jumps. Check out the
breakdown that energy companies provide. Generation, transmission, and
distribution are pretty straightforward. But if your power company is any-
thing like Bill’s, you may be coughing up cash for public purpose programs,
nuclear decommissioning, trust transfer amounts (TTA), DWR bond charges,
ongoing CTC, energy cost recovery amounts, and the like.

Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

To figure out how much you’re actually spending, simply divide the total of
your bill by how many kWh’s you used. In Bill’s case, this yields 17.5 cents
per kWh. Comparing this amount to some other parts of the country is
instructive. In central Florida, the overall rate is around 11.6 cents per kWh.
In Milwaukee, it’s around 10.4 cents. (As usual, California is leading the way
into the future, which in this case is higher energy prices.)
To see how your rate compares, visit the Energy Information Administration
Web site at www.eia.doe.gov. There, you can find a number of reports,
including information on the retail prices of electricity on a state-by-state
basis.
Interpreting the data
After you compile all your data, add to your monthly utility bills the other
energy costs to get a grand total for each month. The most important other
costs are gas expenses such as propane, natural gas, liquid gas, and so on.
Place your data in a chart.

Chapter 2: Surveying Your Household Energy Efficiency and Use

Here’s what you can glean from the data:
 Changes in energy usage: The shape of the curve is typical. The heater
is on a lot in the winter, and the air conditioner in the summer. If you use
an air conditioner, your potential graph should look similar in shape,
unless you have unusual climate conditions.
 Baseline usage: You can establish your baseline usage by looking at the
months in which no heating or air-conditioning are used at all. May and
September are the usual candidates. In the example, Bill Toomuch’s
baseline usage is approximately 1,500 kWh. (Baseline usage is the energy
consumption with both heating and air-conditioning factored out. This
figure is of interest because it tells you how much you’re spending on
heating and air conditioning, versus the rest of your requirements.)
 Average kWh per day: Add up the total number of kilowatts you used
that year and divide by 365 (or 366 in a leap year). The average
American kWh per day is around 20, so see how your usage compares.
Bill Toomuch uses over three times that. His house is bigger, with a lot of
extra goodies, but he has plenty of room for improvement.
 Seasonal rate changes: Check your bills to find out whether you have a
rate increase in relation to the winter months when the same amount of
total power was used. This jump is common; the power company
charges more during peak seasons.
Accounting for anomalies
Not every drop or rise in energy usage reflects changes in your energy habits.
Individual years are subject to strange weather patterns or maybe one-time-
only events, such as a big wedding. Look at several years’ worth of data and
if you see any numbers that look out of place, try to figure out why. You may
want to plot several years’ worth of graphs to get a more comprehensive idea
about your energy consumption.
26
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 
Getting the time of day
You may also be on what’s a time of use (TOU)
billing system. This system requires a special
power meter that can distinguish between how
much energy you use during different portions
of the day, such as from noon to 6 p.m. The
power company bills you more for energy used
during this peak time slot. You may have three
or four different time slots, each with its own
rate. If you have this type of system in place, you
can create even more data lines on your graphs
that’ll illustrate your habits.

Watch out for isolated events on your bills. For example, perhaps one of Bill
Toomuch’s monthly statements included a one-time deduction as a result of
the power company’s settling a lawsuit with energy providers who charged
too much. You need to factor this sort of thing out because it has no bearing
on your habits.
Do you have a really high bill one month? One that sticks out like a sore
thumb? Here are the biggest reasons:
 The addition of occupants in your home
 The addition of appliances, like a freezer in the garage
 Faulty appliances
 The use of too much heating or air conditioning
 Use of appliances with large motors (pumps, compressors, 
air conditioners)
 Seasonal appliances — electric blankets, dehumidifiers, lots of shop
lighting, power tools
 An estimated bill or one that reflects a higher time period
 A wedding or a big party
 Uncle Bill’s motor home parked in the driveway
Adding Up Typical Energy Usage
You need to look at the details of how you’re using energy at your house in
order to determine the best way to spend time and money reducing your
power bills — and how best to invest in solar equipment. A good start is to
first look at how the average household in America uses energy. You can com-
pare your own situation and get some real insights.
According the Department of Energy (DOE), the average household expends
the following percentages on its energy consumption:
 44 percent on heating and cooling
 30 percent for lighting, cooking, and appliances
 18 percent for water heating
 8 percent for refrigerators
27
Chapter 2: Surveying Your Household Energy Efficiency and Use

The single most expensive power requirements in any home are the heating,
ventilation, and air-conditioning system, or HVAC. Answer these questions:
 What type do you have — wood burning stove, gas fireplace, electric
heat pump, or something else? How do you pay for the energy in each?
 How much would upgrading to a more efficient method cost? Assign
dollar values to the alternatives. Most houses that have wood stoves
also have other heaters as well. What’s the tradeoff?
 If pollution is an important consideration to you, what’s your carbon
footprint for each alternative? If you have a wood stove, your cost may
be very low (if you cut your own wood), but your carbon footprint may
be astronomical.
 Add all the separate costs and look at the grand total. Do this for several
years. What’s the trend?
 Have unit costs changed over the last few years? Natural gas, for exam-
ple, fluctuates a lot in price. What’s the trend? How does this affect your
household economy?
Next, you want to analyze the power usage that’s contained in your baseline.
Table 2-2 lists some typical numbers for home appliances.

Use Table 2-2 to estimate your own approximate usage. Modify according to
your personal situation. For example, you can lower your estimates if you
turn off lights religiously and use fluorescents exclusively. On the other hand,
you have to raise the amounts if
28
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

 You have kids, because they often need a lot more washing and drying of
clothes.
 Take a lot of hot and/or long showers.
 Own a roomful of aquariums.
 Have a huge television with a powerful sound system.
 Charge up your golf cart in the garage every night — that costs a lot.
 Plug in your RV.
Spend some time going around your house, looking at all the different ways
that you consume energy. You may come across things you never even
thought of before, such as automatic sprinkler controllers or garage door
openers (these take surprisingly more energy than you think). Work with
your baseline number until you have a rough understanding of everything
that goes into it.
Auditing Your House
In this section, I explain how to systematically go through your house and
rectify the most costly energy problems. If you do this audit yourself, you can
understand what makes your house tick. Make sure that you put on your
grungiest clothes, because you’re going to be climbing around in your base-
ment and attic. (But please be careful.)
The point is to do something about your big inefficiencies, not to study all
the little ones. In economics, the idea behind this strategy is called diminish-
ing marginal utility. It says that the first dollar you spend on improving your
efficiency will have a big impact. The next dollar you spend, not so big an
impact. After you get out to a certain point, you no longer get a dollar’s
return for your dollar investment, which is when you should stop — unless
you’re working with carbon footprints, of course. Then it’s up to you.
You can get professional help if you need to (see the upcoming “Getting
Professional Audits” section). Plenty of resources are available. But at the
very least, look over the shoulder of the professional if you decide to hire
one. Ask questions, and find out what’s going on. If he or she says some-
thing’s amiss, look for yourself.
Plugging leaks
You can save from 5 to 30 percent off your heating and air-conditioning bill
simply by plugging up air leaks, as I describe in the following sections.
29
Chapter 2: Surveying Your Household Energy Efficiency and Use

Check for gas leaks as well. Gas system leaks are dangerous and costly. You
should be able to smell them. If you do smell a leak, call a qualified service
technician from your utility company as soon as possible; gas leaks can be
very dangerous.
Pressure test
You may already know where the drafts are. Find out why. Is the air entering
through an unsealed door? A window? A vent? Is it coming from a heater
vent? A pressure test can help you pinpoint those leaks so you can trace
them down and seal them off. Try to perform this test when it’s cold outside
and warm inside.
1. Seal off your house and turn off heating and cooling sources.
Completely extinguish any fireplace fires. Close the fireplace damper as
much as possible. Turn off your HVAC system. Turn off any furnaces. If
you have a gas water heater, turn that off, too. Close all the windows and
doors in your house. Make sure to close any skylights or vents.
2. Turn on all the exhaust fans in your house (normally located in
kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms).
If you don’t have any exhaust fans, aim a portable fan out a single open
window and turn it on.
Quickly make sure that your fireplace is okay. If it’s leaky (for example,
air is coming down the chimney and out into the house), you’ll be draw-
ing in some stink. If so, turn the fans off and inspect your fireplace to
find out why it’s so leaky. If you can, fix it because it’s inefficient (when
you’re not using the fireplace, heat will be escaping up the chimney). If
you can’t fix it, forge ahead if the smell isn’t too bad. If the smell is really
bad, may want to call a fireplace specialist. Old houses often have very
leaky fireplaces because people simply didn’t care about energy effi-
ciency. Maybe it’s time to install modern, well-designed gas stove.
3. Search for leaks around the house.
With the fans on, your house is depressurized, so any leaks are readily
apparent. Go around the house with a bowl of water, dip your hand in,
and move your wet hand around windows, electrical outlets, switches,
doors, molding interfaces, attic hatches, basement hatches, and so on.
You should be able to feel a leak, especially if it’s cold outside.
Another way to do this step is with a stick of incense; when the smoke
fluctuates, you’ve found a leak. Or use a candle; when the flame flickers,
you’ve found a leak.
4. Get a ladder or a chair and check for leaks in overhead lights.
Such leaks are very common, but unfortunately they’re a little more diffi-
cult to fix if you don’t have good attic access.
30
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

5. Turn off the fans and then fix the leaks as appropriate.
Caulking works wonders, but it can look bad. You may want to use the
clear kind. Or perhaps you can fix the leaks from the outside, where
caulking is more acceptable. Drafts start somewhere and end some-
where, so you’re best off fixing both sides of the problem. You may be
able to seal off some areas with duct tape.
Buy a caulking gun that has a pressure relief gasket, or else the caulk will
keep coming out when you’re done squeezing the trigger, making a big
mess (and possibly leading to PG-13 language).
You can also buy aerosol cans of expandable insulation that work really
well, but beware; this stuff is nasty, and it gets all over everything. I have
yet to find anything that can clean it off, but it sure works well. Your best
bet is to go in your garage first and practice spraying it on a newspaper
you can ball up and throw away.
If you have a leak in an outlet or switch, turn the electricity off in the
entire house before you go in there and fix it. Flip the main circuit
breaker off. You may have to reset your clocks, but you’ll be alive to do
it — so don’t complain!
6. You may need to climb into the attic to fix overhead light fixtures.
Step only on the joists; if you step on the sheetrock, your foot may go
down into the room below, which would be very startling for all con-
cerned. Or you could go down into the room below, which would be
even more startling!
7. After you’ve finished fixing leaks, turn the exhaust fans back on and
repeat the wet hand (or incense or candle) routine from Step 2.
Your house will be tighter now, and any remaining leaks will be even
more obvious. Repeat the fixing stage.
8. Repeat the whole process until you’re satisfied.
Door seals
Check the seals around your exterior doors. Applying foam weather stripping
is easy; it comes in self-stick tapes of various sizes. Measure how much you
need, pull off a chunk of the existing seal (if there is some), and take it to the
hardware store as an example of the specific type of material you need. There
are a lot of different forms and thicknesses; don’t go to the hardware store
expecting to guess right. If there is no seal, measure the surface widths that
you will applying the material to, and get the hardware store clerk to help
you identify the right material. The bottom line is that some weatherproofing,
even if it’s not optimum, is much better than none. Your worst problem may
be appearance. Use a sharp box knife to cut off any excess material.
31
Chapter 2: Surveying Your Household Energy Efficiency and Use

The DOE’s Consumer Guide (www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/
you_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11280) 
may be helpful for deciding which types of insulation work best in your cli-
mate and physical conditions.
Check along the bottoms of the doors as well. Sealing thresholds takes a little
more effort, but your hardware store likely has plenty of insulating solutions
that you should be able to implement yourself with no more than a screw-
driver. Check out the store’s stock and how the different items are used. For
example, vinyl door sweeps are very effective for the bottom of a doorway,
while foam insulation works well around the periphery.
Window seals
Stationary windows should be well caulked. Get the good stuff, the kind that
lasts for 50 years. (You don’t need it to last for 50 years, but it’ll work better
for 10 years if it’s rated for 50.) Sliding windows take more ingenuity, but your
hardware store clerk can help you.
Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning inspection
Most ducts are for sending heated or cooled air into the house; one large one
is the return. They all need to be tightly sealed. Leaks in the ductwork are
worse than air leaks in your house because the ducts are pressurized, which
magnifies the amount of air escaping through cracks and openings. So make
sure that you access your HVAC system and visually inspect the duct system
snaking around your house. If the ducts aren’t well insulated, you can get kits
at hardware stores. If the ducts are insulated, fix any rips or tears.
When working with dusty ducts, wear a dust mask; get them at your hard-
ware store. (By now, you should know where that is.)
You can find many problems with just a quick glance. It’s amazing how many
people are heating their basements without even knowing it. I’ve been in a lot
of houses where the insulation is just shredded off the ducts. I’ve also been in
a lot of houses where junctions have broken, leaving a big opening. Rats and
mice like to chew through, and they leave little openings that are hard to find
(unless you’re a small rodent).
Here are some things to remember when you inspect and fix your ductwork:
 You can turn the HVAC on so that the ducts are pressurized and find
leaks with a wet hand. (See the earlier “Pressure test” section for info on
how this works.)
 Duct tape works wonders, but it doesn’t stick to dusty surfaces very
well. If you have a dust problem, wrap the duct tape around and around
and just cover up the dust. It’s easier than trying to clean it off.
32
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

 Close the ducts leading to rooms where you don’t need the HVAC system
to operate. Ask how to do this at the hardware store; it should have the
materials you need.
Outdoors now
Go outside and visually inspect for leaks. Use your imagination. And remem-
ber: When in doubt, squirt caulk! What’s the worst that can happen? Here are
some places to pay special attention to:
 Look at faucets, pipes, electrical wiring, and electric outlets. Cracks
often form around the junctions where the pipes fit through foundations
and siding; fix these with caulk. Even if you’re only sealing off your base-
ment, which you’re not heating or cooling, you’ll be better off inside the
upper part of the house .
 Check all interfaces between two different building materials. Bricks
to foundation; interior corners with molding strips; where siding and
foundations meet; roofs to siding; and so on. Plug all holes and voids
with caulk — the good stuff.
If icicles are clustering around a particular location at your house, you
have a leak somewhere above that’s melting snow. The water drips down
and then refreezes into icicles. These leaks are usually pretty good sized.
 Look for cracks in mortar, foundations, siding, and so on. Seal these
with appropriate materials.
 Check for cracks and voids around exterior doors and windows.
These gaps may not result in air leaks inside the house, but while you’re
in your grungy clothes and the proper mood, you may as well seal water
leaks to prevent damage that could cost money and turn into air leaks.
 Check storm windows for seal integrity. The interior window may be
well sealed, but the storm window will work better if it’s also sealed.
Checking insulation
Check insulation wherever you can. If you find it wholly inadequate, you have
a big decision on your hands. Putting in new insulation is expensive, and the
payback time is going to be way out there. On the other hand, you’re wasting
money and energy if you don’t do it. Here are some areas you can focus on:
 Voids in the insulation are easy to deal with. They usually occur around
light fixtures and where somebody has been working, pushing it aside.
Fix these voids by either replacing the insulation, or filling them with
expandable foam insulation (the real messy stuff).
33
Chapter 2: Surveying Your Household Energy Efficiency and Use

 The most important room is your family room, so if you only have
enough money to insulate one room, that’s it.
 If you have a basement, check to see whether the ceiling is insulated. If
not, putting some in is a relatively simple job.
 Having the insulation in the attic thickened is easiest. You can do this
yourself, although working with insulation is a hassle (make sure that
you use a dust mask at all times). You can find companies in the phone
book to come in and spray powdered insulation, which works nicely.
 Hot water pipes should be well insulated. A number of easy options that
work well are inexpensive and widely available. The best bet is a length
(usually four feet) of foam cylinder with a lengthwise cut that allows you
to simply push the piece over a pipe. Another option that works a little
better is fiberglass insulation tape, but it requires you to unroll the tape
around and around the pipe, which can be very difficult if the pipe is
attached close to a wall, or under a floor. Ask at your hardware store.
When the insulation in your attic is substandard, it’s also substandard in the
walls, and that problem isn’t so easy to remedy. The best bet may be to
simply put new siding on the outside of your house. You can get good-looking
siding with great insulation properties, and at least when you spend money
like this, you can accomplish a visual remodeling as well.
Minding the details
The following list covers some details that can make a big impact, depending
on your home.
 Help windows insulate. Single-pane windows are poor insulators.
Changing to double pane is best but expensive. You can put up heat-
sealing cloth barriers in the summer or storm windows in the winter.
Check out Chapter 12. This step can make a very big difference, and 
you don’t have to spend an arm and a leg. You may consider doing it 
in one room only, such as the family room or your master bedroom.
 Let attics breathe. Attics need to breathe properly. They’re usually built
with vent systems either right through the roof or up in the walls below
the eaves. If they get completely clogged with dust, your attic gets much
hotter in the summer. Clean out all vents. If you don’t have any vents,
consider putting some in. Ask at your hardware store to find out how
best to do it in your area.
 Change filters. Clogged filters force the machinery to work harder,
which takes more energy to do the same job. Changing filters every
month or so is unquestionably cheaper than paying the extra power bill.
34
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

You can get really fancy, expensive filters, but don’t bother — they’re
not worth it. Buy a whole box of cheap ones (much cheaper by the
dozen) and change them all the time.
Filters in your range hood can get gummed up with grease, keeping your
fan from pushing any air. The fan can end up spinning the power meter
like mad, so make sure that you change range hood filters as well.
 Replace or service inefficient HVAC systems. If your HVAC systems are
old, they’re undoubtedly inefficient. Your best bet is to call an HVAC ser-
vice company and have someone come out to analyze your equipment.
The serviceperson can tell you how much better new equipment will
perform, although you should keep in mind that his or her motive is to
sell new equipment. Do your research, and let the buyer beware. Get at
least three quotes.
If your systems aren’t old, having them serviced still may pay (with the
realization that this may be asking for a scam). My experience with
HVAC service companies is that many have a set price, regardless of
what they do. A broken heat pump costs $267. A new fan costs $267.
Tightening some screws? You guessed it. Before anyone comes out, ask
him how he charges and what you’re going to get for your money. Does
he warrant his work? If he fudges, call around. You can find somebody
who’s on the up and up.
 Lower your wattage and turning off the lights. Each light bulb is clearly
marked with a wattage. A 60-watt bulb left on for an hour consumes 0.06
kWh. Ten 60-watt bulbs in recessed lighting in your ceiling turned on for
4 hours consumes 2.4 kWh. At a rate of 15 cents per kWh, this costs 36
cents a day. For a month, the total comes to $10.80, or $130 per year.
Add to that the cost of new bulbs, and it may be costing you more than
$150 a year to leave those overhead lights on every night. Calculations
like this can be surprising.
Do you have an outside light that burns all night? If it’s 600 watts, it’s
costing you
0.600 kWh × 10 hrs/day × 30 days/month × 0.15 $/kWh = $9/month
Don’t cut yourself any slack if you use dimmers. They’re very inefficient.
Fluorescents use much less power to put out the same light intensity.
They cost more (but last up to ten times longer, so not really), but com-
pare this expense to the gain you get not only with reduced power bills
but also a reduced carbon footprint (see Chapter 1 for details on carbon
emissions). Okay, so fluorescents look different; they have a bluish light
that flickers. You can’t put them on a dimmer. Sometimes they’re just not
right. But at least give them a try.
35
Chapter 2: Surveying Your Household Energy Efficiency and Use

Analyzing your major appliances
Major appliances consume a lot of power. To find out how much an appliance
costs per month to run, first estimate how much time it’s on per day. Then
use this formula:
Wattage ÷ 1,000 × hrs/day × $/kWh ÷ 30days/month = total cost per month
A clothes dryer uses 5,570 watts. If you dry clothes for six hours a week,
that’s 6 hours ÷ 7 days = 0.86 hours per day. Here’s what a month’s worth of
use would cost you:
5,570 ÷ 1,000 × 0.86 × 0.15 × 30 = $21.56 per month
If you iron clothes each morning for 15 minutes, it’s costing you
1,200 ÷ 1,000 × 0.25 × 0.15 × 30 = $1.35 per month
Add to that the cost of your washing clothes for six hours a week:
900 ÷ 1,000 × 0.86 × 0.15 × 30 = $3.48 per month
Your total for clothes is $26.40 per month. If you put up a clothesline, you
save $21.56 per month in cash and about 1,748 of carbon dioxide emissions
per year. Plus, your clothes smell better. You may also want to consider that
all that dryer heat eventually goes out the vent pipe to the great outdoors,
which seems like such a waste.
Getting Professional Audits
You can call your power company to do an audit for you. Some companies
come to your house and look at your situation in detail — these are the best
kind. Other utilities offer an Internet analysis or a mail-order analysis, which
is probably only of modest interest because it doesn’t take your specifics into
account. Of course, if it’s a mail-in type deal, you may as well just struggle
through it yourself — by the time you’re done compiling enough information
to make the mail-in audit worthwhile, you’ve basically done the job yourself.
Same thing with Internet audits.
If you get a professional audit done, take some of their suggestions with a
grain of salt. The biggest inefficiencies are easy to detect, especially if you’ve
never even tried before. I can tell you from experience doing audits that most
houses have glaring problems that can usually be fixed for less than a few
hundred dollars.
36
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

If you do decide to hire an auditor, look here:
 National Association of Energy Service Companies (NAESCO)
202-822-0950 or www. naesco.org
 The phone book under energy conservation services and products
 Phone book under utilities, electric service or utility providers or gas
utility companies
 The Home Energy Saver (http://hes.lbl.gov), sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Energy, which offers a free home energy audit as well as
carbon footprint estimates
Here’s what to do prior to a professional audit:
 Assemble all electric and utility bills for the past two or three years.
 Make a list of occupant habits, especially noting whether anyone is
home during the day. Are there kids? Are clothes washed and dried fre-
quently? Are long showers taken? Big baths?
 Note the thermostat setting in your house.
 Make a list of questions you may have.
• If you want to make a change or improvement in your household,
ask how it would fit in with the results of your audit. Then ask for
some advice. Auditors have tons of experience, and they’re usually
very proud to expound.
• Ask about financing programs the company has for improvements
the auditor suggests.
• Ask about guarantees for their work. If they tell you can achieve a
reduction, how accurate are they warranting that claim?

B
efore installing solar power, reducing your energy consumption as much
as possible makes sense. For every dollar you spend on energy conser-
vation, you’ll save much more on the cost of your solar system. For example,
if you can save 1 kWh per day on your power bill (5 percent of the typical
North American household’s energy use), your solar energy system will cost
around $7,000 less. The number depends on the level of subsidies and tax
breaks you can find (see Part VI), but the impact is obvious.
Through conscientious change of habits, the average household can reduce
its energy consumption 20 percent. And through investments in energy-
saving equipment, another 15 percent may be possible. That’s a third off your
monthly bills, and it’ll reduce the cost for your solar investments because
you can install less capacity! (Need I mention pollution? Didn’t think so.)
In this chapter, I show you how to make your home energy efficient. Some
ways are cheap and easy; some are expensive and involved. Go ahead and
take your pick. And for additional advice, visit the U.S. Department of
Energy’s guide to energy efficiency at www.eere.energy.gov/consumer.

Conserving Energy without 
Reducing Quality of Life
Conserving energy reduces greenhouse gases, relieves the strain on natural
resources, lowers energy costs, and eases the manmade assault on Mother
Nature. There seems to be an inherent assumption that energy conservation
also entails a reduction in quality of lifestyle, but Europeans use far less
energy than North Americans, and arguing that their lifestyles are any worse
would be difficult. In Europe, energy efficiency has been ingrained for a long
time to the point where it’s a self-perpetuating logic of its own.
On a residential street, most of the houses are similar. The people living
inside don’t look the same, but culturally, they’re similar. They’re in the same
neighborhood, after all. But one house may be paying $400 a month in power
bills while the other is only paying $50. You can see an equivalent difference
in their carbon footprints. (For more on carbon footprints, see Chapter 1.)
Yet by all external accounts, both houses enjoy the same quality of life.
The house with the lower power bills has solar equipment installed on its
roof. And it probably has deciduous trees on the southern front. It looks
better for it, especially in the autumn. It has solar light tubes in the kitchen so
that lights aren’t on very often. The occupants open and close windows to
optimize ventilation. They use space heaters in winter and turn their ther-
mostats down, but they wear sweaters so they’re just as warm.
Here are some more things you may notice about the efficient house:
 It’s darker at night.
 The garage door is closed all the time.
 Blinds and awnings are opened and closed a lot.
 Solar tubes and skylights are visible on the roof.
 A clothesline bisects the backyard.
 The noise pollution from an HVAC (heating, ventilation, and 
air-conditioning system) is much less.
 You don’t hear a TV on all the time.
You get the picture. Both houses have the same quality of life, but there’s a
very big difference.

Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

Changing Habits and Equipment 
Is Hard to Do — Or Is It?
This section discusses some of the easiest ways to save power. You don’t
even need to make a cash investment. All you have to do is change some
habits and become more aware of your consumption.
Lighting
Most households have a good number of lights on at the same time (some
even during the daylight hours!). Basic logic suggests that you don’t need
more than one light per person turned on at any give time, but let’s be 
practical — lighting affects ambience quite a bit. It can make a room seem
much more inviting, softening the hard edges and implying security and 
well being. Lighting can magnify the best features of your house, both inside
and out, and it’s not reasonable to reduce lighting to the strict task of 
functionality.
Lighting (and darkening) the interior
You can probably do better with your lights. Do you turn them on by habit or
necessity? Sure, the house looks nice and warm with a bunch of incandes-
cents burning away, but you’re an emancipated energy slave now, and it’s
time to revert to darkness. Let there be dark!
Take a look at some tips:
 Here’s some bottom-line logic you can’t argue with: One light bulb per
person in the house at any given time.
 If you want a dimmer, just use lower wattage bulbs. Dimmers don’t save
energy; they just consume it differently.
Incandescents are inefficient because they put out a lot of heat along with
their light. Using them makes even less sense in the summer, when you’re
trying to cool your house. For every 100 Watts of incandescent lighting, your
air conditioner needs to run an extra 80 Watts to offset the heat. Using fluo-
rescent bulbs in the summertime can make a difference.
The reason many people don’t use fluorescents is habit. So maybe you don’t
like the bluish, flickering light. It looks like an office, and you get enough of
that at work. But newer versions are much better. The spectrum is friendlier.
41
Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient

Fluorescent bulbs contain mercury, so when they finally, finally burn out,
recycle them or dispose of them at a hazardous waste facility.
Lighting the great outdoors
You don’t need to limit your energy conservation habits to the inside of your
house. For example, many people like the sense of enhanced security with
bright outdoor flood lighting. A more sensible approach is to use a motion
detector to turn the light on for only five minutes at a time. You still achieve
your security — probably even more so because an intruder is more likely to
flee if he’s suddenly illuminated. He (okay, she, but that’s not as likely) may
even be more inclined to intrude if the light is on all the time because he or
she will be able to see that no threats around, such as sleeping dogs, people
in a corner on a lawn chair, and so on.
A number of inexpensive products on the market feature the following:
 Motion detectors and timers to limit the on-time
 LEDs for bright spotlights at very low energy consumptions
 Solar power systems that don’t need any hardwiring (You can get the
same performance as a hard-wired overhead light. The only drawback is
that you need to mount these where they’ll get some sunlight.)
Appliances and electronics
Appliances gobble up a lot of energy. That’s one reason why the Department
of Energy, in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
has devised an energy efficiency rating system named ENERGY STAR that
tells you how much energy you can expect an appliance to consume in a year.
Figure 3-1 shows you a sample appliance label that uses the ENERGY STAR
rating system. (Visit www.energystar.gov for more information.)
Beneath where it says “This Model Uses” is the estimated energy consump-
tion for the particular model. Below that amount is the minimum energy con-
sumption for models of the same type, as well as maximum energy
consumption for models of the same type. You can tell how good (or bad)
your appliance is with respect to the industry availability. Of more interest is
the annual cost, which is estimated using national energy cost averages. If
your costs are higher than the national average, expect your appliance to
cost more, and vice versa.
You can use these numbers to calculate how much money you’ll save by
throwing out your old appliance (donate it to a charity and write it off, or sell
it in the newspaper) and replacing it with a nice new one. Don’t forget to cal-
culate carbon footprints (see Chapter 1). New appliances are often quieter
and better looking as well.

Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient

Refrigerators are the prime candidate for updating. New ones are much
better than old, and they make less noise. You can always sell an old refriger-
ator, which is not necessarily true of stoves and dishwashers and other major
appliances.
Buying new appliances isn’t the only way to rack up savings. The following
sections discuss ways you can reduce energy usage with your current appli-
ances and electronics.
Cooking appliances
Limit heat from cooking. You can turn your oven off before food is finished
cooking, especially in the summer. And in the summer, whatever heat you
generate in your oven will eventually bleed into your house, so that exact
amount of heat will have to be offset by your air conditioner. You also get this
added heat when cooking on the stovetop.
Use the barbecue in the summer to cook all your food, including vegetables.
Gas barbecues are much better for the environment than charcoal, and
because they’re much more convenient, you’ll be more inclined to use them.
And contrary to what a lot of barbecue aficionados claim, gas barbecues
don’t smell bad. Besides, most people who use charcoals squirt a bunch of
nasty lighter fluid over the coals, which is terrible for the environment and in
some communities, banned.
Microwaves are the most efficient way to heat foods, but sometimes they’re
not practical because of the astringent textures that result. Toaster ovens
provide a happy median, and I recommend sitting one next to your
microwave. Get one with a timer, or at some point, you’ll forget what you’re
doing, burn something, set off the smoke alarms, and wake up the dog.
Or you can use a solar oven, which effectively captures solar radiation into a
confined, insulated space to heat just like a conventional oven but with no
energy cost and no pollution (see Chapter 9).
Refrigerators
Here’s how to keep both the temperature and your energy use down:
 Use your ice dispenser, if you have one. You won’t have to open your
door and let in the warm air, which then needs to be recooled, costing
extra energy.
 Turn the temperatures up on your existing freezer/refrigerator.
Experiment to see how it works. It makes a big difference in cost but not
much in terms of food quality.
44
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

 Clean your coils. At the bottom of your refrigerator are cooling coils
that need to be vacuumed at least twice a year. When crud builds up on
the coils, your compressor is much less efficient, which means your
refrigerator has to run longer. Does your refrigerator run all the time?
Dirty coils are probably why. You can get special dusters from your
hardware store. After cleaning the coils, not only do you save on energy,
but your house is also quieter. It’s amazing how many people never, ever
clean their coils.
 Get rid of that old freezer in your garage. Why is it there again?
Because you can get a price break when you buy an entire pig? Is it
worth it? Consider carbon footprint.
Electronics
Look around your house and you’ll find all sorts of electronic equipment
that’s drawing power even when it’s turned off. LEDs are lit, fans are running.
You don’t think this adds up? Turn off everything in your house and go out
and look at your electric meter. For most of you, it’s still spinning. The best
way to control phantom loads is to use power strips (the kind that are
common with computer systems). You can get them at any variety store for
less than ten bucks; make sure to get one with grounding prongs and quality
switches. When you’re not using the equipment, simply turn off the power
strip. This works especially well for entertainment centers. Big TVs and
stereos draw a lot of current even when they’re shut off. Your cable box also
draws a lot of current even when turned off.
45
Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient
Testing, one two three
Here’s a fun little project. See what it takes to
get your meter to stop dead. You may not even
be able to do it. Try shutting your entire house
off by flipping down the main circuit breaker in
your fuse box. Is your meter still moving? Call
the power company because you may have a
current leak through the ground. It happens.
If you shut off your entire house and your meter
stops moving, but then when you turn the power
back on you still have movement when every-
thing’s turned off, start unplugging things. First
unplug the little gizmos with LEDs, such as your
cable box. Telephones. Stereos and clock
radios.
Check out how much energy each item uses. A
lot of meters have outdoor outlets located
nearby. If not, run an extension cord over there.
Experiment with some of your favorite appli-
ances and gadgets. For example, plug in your
hair dryer and watch your meter go berserk. Try
a space heater; they gobble juice up about as
fast as Speedy Gonzalez.

Many people flip their television on as soon as they get home. It makes an
empty house less lonely and enlivens the environment. If you need that exter-
nal stimuli, try a radio instead. It consumes much less power. Or maybe you
might talk to your kids. If they’re not more interesting than TV, it’s probably
your fault, not theirs.
Vacuuming and laundry
Here are some tips on efficiently using the appliances that keep your carpet
and clothes clean and dry:
 Get an upright vacuum cleaner. Central vacuums waste tons of energy,
and they move far more air than an exhaust fan. (The good news is
they’re hard to leave on too long because they make so much noise.)
 Forget the dryer and use a clothesline instead. You can get nifty retrac-
tion mechanisms to make the clothesline disappear when not in use. You
don’t even have to air your dirty — uh, clean — laundry outside. Just
hang the clothesline in your garage and run a fan near an open window
while you’re at work (unless your garage is full of stinky old cars or
incontinent cats!). You can also hang certain items of clothing over the
shower rod in your bathroom. Open the window, or drying may take 
forever.
 Always keep your dryer’s lint trap cleaned out. Every time you run the
dryer, check it.
 Clean clogged dryer vents. A snaking, crimped dryer vent hose is as
bad as a clogged filter — maybe even worse. The vent may be very diffi-
cult to check out, but it’s worth it — clogged vents are also a fire hazard.
I’ve seen dryer hoses filled with lint — no air movement at all. No
wonder the dryer was on for three hours at a time, and then the clothes
were still damp and hot.
Hot water
Whether you’re heating water in the sun (see Chapter 10), using solar sys-
tems to supplement your domestic water heater (Chapter 12), or just trying
to cut down on how much energy your water heater uses, you can easily
reduce your hot-water needs — without kicking anyone out of the house.
Practicing some slick hot-water conservation habits
Hot water consumes an average of 18 percent of a typical household’s energy
needs. You can make a big difference in your power bill if you can just
manage to change a few habits. Most of these suggestions are easy to imple-
ment, and you’ll quickly find that your quality of life has been impacted only
marginally.
46
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

 Use cold tap water. Most of the sink taps nowadays have a single lever
for controlling both hot and cold water. You push the lever to one side to
get hot and vice versa. Rarely do people actually want hot water, but
inevitably they push the lever to the middle when they draw water for
any use at all. Even though you’re not getting any hot water from the tap
because it takes a while to get there, you’re still drawing hot water from
the tank and wasting it. From now on, when you draw tap water, push
the lever completely to the cold side.
On that subject, drawing hot water from the kitchen tap for use in cook-
ing is wasteful. When you draw hot water, you need to wait a few min-
utes for it to get there. You’re filling up all the intervening pipes with hot
water in the process. Then you fill a cup, or a bowl with the hot water.
The fact is, the amount of water in your pipes can be over ten or twenty
times the amount you actually use.
Heat cold water in the microwave oven. The stove is better than the tap
but not as good as a microwave.
 Run a full dishwasher. Washing a 12-piece dinner set of dishes by hand
takes around 2.5 kWh of heated water. Washing the same dishes in a
machine takes only around 1.5 kWh, and the dishes are much cleaner.
You don’t need to rinse the dishes with hot water prior to putting them
into the dishwasher. Most people prewash their dishes more than they
need to.
 Take showers instead of baths. A five-minute shower takes a third of the
water of a bath. If you want to spend half an hour soaking, a bath is
better, but most people simply want to clean off.
 Lower the water temperature at the source. Set the temperature of
your domestic water heater to 120°F instead of the scalding 160°F it’s
probably at right now. Here’s a table of the costs of heating 64 gallons of
water per day with electric power when you set the thermostat to differ-
ent temperatures:
Temperature
Yearly Cost (at 12 cents per kWh)
160°F
$675
150°F
$604
140°F
$537
130°F
$460
120°F
$405
That’s a typical savings of $270 per year. Will you even be able to tell?
Probably not. So why is it set so high? It’s the old school of thought,
back in the days when energy was inconsequential.
47
Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient

Fixing up your shower, pipes, and water heater
You can also save energy just by making a few household repairs or 
improvements:
 Repair leaky faucets, especially hot water. The leak may seem tiny, but
the cost adds up fast.
 Put a flow constrictor into your shower head. And take a look at how
much water your current shower head is wasting. Is water going all over
the place? What’s the point in aiming water at the walls? You also don’t
need to turn the hot water up so that the windows steam. You can take a
longer, cooler shower and save energy.
Get a gallon container and turn your shower on. Measure how long it
takes to the fill the container. Your flow rate is 60 divided by the mea-
sured number of seconds. If it takes 15 seconds, your flow rate is 4 gal-
lons per minute. A typical rate is 2.5 gallons per minute. A good energy
conservation rate is around 1.75 gallons per minute.
 Drain your domestic water heater twice a year through the valve at
the bottom to remove water heater crud. Drain about two quarts into a
bowl or container. You’ll get rid of the sediment that settles on the
bottom that makes for less efficient heating.
Using on-demand water heaters and heat recovery systems
An on-demand water heater doesn’t have a large reservoir of hot water.
Instead, it uses a small heating chamber with super high-speed capacity. As
water is drawn through the chamber, it heats it up to the set temperature
within seconds, so you have no heat loss as the water sits there in a storage
tank. This heater makes more sense in houses where you don’t use hot water
for extended periods of time, such as in a vacation home that’s is empty for
entire seasons.
Look in the phone book for suppliers in your area. These systems are more
expensive than conventional, but if you use hot water only occasionally,
they’ll likely pay off.
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) comprise, on average,
around 25 percent of a typical household’s energy costs. Your proportion
may be much greater, depending on your climate. And most homes are ineffi-
cient in terms of insulation properties, so there is a lot of wasted energy. By
changing a few habits and making some inexpensive modifications, you can
save a lot of money.
48
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

Keeping your cool as you change temp control habits
By simply altering the way you run your equipment, you can save money on
energy costs. Habits die hard, it’s true. But you’ll find that these changes
won’t be nearly as hard as, say, eating much less, or exercising much more.
 Make sure your registers flow freely. How much junk can fall through
and create air dams is amazing. Children’s toys are prime candidates.
You can hurt your heat pump if all the registers in your house are shut
off. What’s the point?
 Close off unused rooms. You can do so by either closing the registers
(or turning off the valve if you have a radiator) or by closing the door to
that room.
 Cut your use of exhaust fans. When you run bathroom or kitchen
exhaust fans while your HVAC is working, you’re pulling the conditioned
air from your home and forcing it outside. This air needs to be replen-
ished somehow. You draw in hot or cold air through leaks, and the HVAC
system needs to work a lot harder than necessary.
Do you really need to use that exhaust fan? If so, crack open a nearby
window to minimize the wasted energy. After you’re done using the fan,
close the window again.
Sometimes in bathrooms the exhaust fan is connected to the light, and
whenever you turn the light on the fan is also on. Face it: There’s only
one good reason to use an exhaust fan in a bathroom. Yes, you know
when. The rest of the time it’s a waste (no pun intended). You can also
put an exhaust fan in with its own switch, maybe even remotely con-
trolled. Ask at your friendly hardware store for the different options.
 Use dehumidifiers in hot climates. Dehumidifiers make a room feel
better on your skin, so you can turn the temperature up while retaining
the same comfort level.
 Always use efficient fans even when the air conditioner is on. Moving
air makes you feel better, so you can dial up the temperature in the room
and get the same effect.
 Keep fireplace dampers and flues tightly closed when not in use. Not
just seasonally, but all the time. If you’re only using your fireplace on the
weekends, close it up the rest of the time.
Structural changes: Windows and roofs
You may benefit from investing in new windows, or a new roof. Windows have
the potential to add a great deal of beauty to your home, so investing in them
can be functional (if you buy ones that operate better than your old ones),
49
Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient

energy efficient (many new materials and manufacturing techniques are avail-
able), and aesthetic (windows are generally the visual focus of a room, or at
least they have that potential). Roofs always need to be changed, but you
might consider installing an energy-efficient roof when your old roof poops
out.
Using high-tech storm windows
Many old houses come complete with an entire set of storm windows, and
putting them up and taking them down is a ritual of seasonal change.
Basically, they accomplish the same thing as double-pane glass.
A relatively inexpensive thing you can do is have new, high-tech glass put
into the storm window frames. You can get really good performance.
However, keep in mind that old houses with storm windows usually don’t
have very good insulation in the walls. Simply improving the r-value (see
sidebar) of the windows may be only a drop in the bucket.
Getting new windows
Changing windows is expensive, but it can have a profound effect. You can
get all kinds of different glass. Some is designed for cold climates — it lets in
sunlight but insulates well for heat. Glass for hot climates blocks off sunlight,
particularly in certain parts of the spectrum such as the UV (ultraviolet),
which can cause damage and bleaching of fabrics inside the house.
Double-pane glass is the norm now. You can get triple pane, but it’s expensive
(and even more expensive when Johnny hits a baseball through it).
You don’t need to change all the glass in your house. The family room or
living room is the most important. Plus when you change a window, it’s a
major decorative feature. You can change the big window in your main living
area, and if you change nothing else you’ve dramatically altered the charac-
ter in that room. If you put in an energy-efficient window, with appropriate
window coverings, you can also change the way the room feels. For example,
direct sunlight in the summer may not be hot to a thermometer, but it feels
hot on your skin, and that’s what really matters.
Window contractors are in the phone book. Call one that deals with a number
of different brands. A lot of them carry only one brand, and you’re not likely
to get a fair and balanced appraisal of all the options. Many window suppliers
work with contractors a majority of the time. Sometimes these companies are
not really enthusiastic about working with onesy-twosey private accounts.
Look around for the right supplier because the prices vary quite a bit.

Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

Swimming pools and hot tubs
Swimming pools lose a lot of heat by wind. If you simply install some low
bushes on the windward side, your yard will be prettier, and you’ll use less
energy heating your pool. If you don’t heat your pool, it’ll stay warmer, and
your season will be longer. You can even get drought-resistant bushes that
you don’t even have to water.
Most people with swimming pools run the filters for much longer than they
need to. Two hours a day for a swimming pool works just fine. Try it and see
whether it changes things appreciably. Pool pumps take a lot of power; the
less you can use them, the better.
Old hot tubs use so much energy it may be a sin. You can improve the situa-
tion with a good cover. Look in the phone book for suppliers; they’re all over
the place. Get a good cover; weather takes a toll, and the cheap ones crack
and crumble after a few years, plus they’re not as well insulated.
If you have a redwood tub, get rid of it and buy a new energy-efficient model.
They’re very nice. The one I have came with preprogrammed filter cycles. I
turn them down to half-usage, and the water is just as clean as before I made
the change, plus I don’t have to change filters nearly as often. If your filters
are clogged, the pump is working too hard. Loading your pump costs a lot
more than cleaning the filters periodically.
If you have an old fiberglass style hot tub with meager insulation, you can
make a nice do-it-yourself project by squirting expandable foam insulation
around the outside, beneath the outer cover. Have fun with this stuff. Make
sure to wear your grungiest clothes, preferably ones you don’t mind throwing
away when you’re done.
51
Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient
r-value
r-value is a complex technical term used in the
industry to denote the level of insulative prop-
erties an insulation material offers. In general,
the higher the r-value, the better the insulation.
When you buy insulation, your dealer will be
able to tell you what your local code requires 
for new homes in your area. You can decide
whether you want to spend extra money for a
higher r-value. You don’t need to increase your
r-value in the entire house to get some benefit
of the extra investment. The family room is the
most important room in the house because it’s
where your family spends the most time

Window Covers: Blinds, 
Awnings, and Shades
You can achieve better insulative properties with your windows by simply
covering them with appropriate materials (sun reflectors, insulation webs,
and colored fabrics), and making it a habit to open and close blinds and cur-
tains at certain times of the day, depending on the weather and time of year.
Blinds
Blinds can be great insulators. The honeycomb variety work well in cold
weather. Close them at night or when you’re not home. They can also be
excellent absorbers or reflectors of sunlight, depending on what type you get.
In cold climates, you want blinds to absorb sunlight and warm up the room.
You can do the same if you open the blinds, but then you won’t be insulating.
There are a wide range of blind styles, and it’s impossible to get into details
here. Big box hardware stores all carry a number of brands and have very
good samples you can get your hands on. Prices vary from $20 per window to
more than $300 per window.
On the other hand, if your main problem is heat in the summer, you want a
blind that will reflect sunlight as much as possible. If you simply put a blind
inside a window to keep sunlight out of the room, it’ll absorb a lot of heat,
but the heat will still be inside the room. You can put blinds over windows on
the outside, which works much better in hot weather because the sunlight is
stopped outside. Of course the blind gets really hot, but who cares? Go to
your big-box hardware store to see the various options. The best bet, from
my experience, is the solar screen variety because you can see through the
material (sunlight is attenuated 80 percent or more, so the view is darker),
but you can still see the view outside. (See Chapter 9 for more on blinds.)
If you have a big picture window that lets a lot of sunlight in on hot days, you
can hang a cheap, roll-up blind on the outside. Get one that’s solid so that it
completely cuts off all light. If you can, leave an air gap of 6 inches or more
between the window and the blind. Yes, the room will be dark and creepy, but
if you’re at work for the day, it won’t matter, and the room will feel a lot better
when you get home. Buy a cheap one because it probably won’t last more
than a season or two hanging outside in the direct sunlight. Take it down and
store it when autumn arrives.
52
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

Awnings
Awnings are great light shades as well. You can buy them with a variety 
of slat structures that accomplish a number of different functions (see 
Figure 3-2).
The Venetian awning allows sunlight in the winter, when the sun is low in the
sky, and blocks sunlight in the summer, when the sun is high. Venetians also
allow you to see out of the top of your window, and the effect is much more
open than the hood awning.

53
Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient

Hood awnings are common because they’re more decorative. They can be
made of nice fabrics that match the house. They work better in rainy climates
because they keep cold water off your windows. You can lose a lot of heat by
water-based convection from rain.
For the do-it-yourselfers, you can build very nice–looking wood slat awnings
that can be attached to most surfaces. You can buy designs over the Internet,
but even more fun is designing them yourself. Calculate the best angles by
creating sun charts (see Chapter 8). You can paint them to match your house,
and you can use materials that last a long time. You can even devise an
adjustment scheme that allows you to raise or lower the pitch, depending on
conditions.
Shades and screens
Solar shade cloth works very nicely, and you can remove it in the summer.
Solar shade cloth is similar to conventional screens, but it’s thicker and has a
specially designed mesh to inhibit infrared and ultraviolet light, neither of
which do you any good in your house other than heating (since you can’t see
either wavelength). Solar shade cloth also has more integrity, and lasts
longer, so the added expense isn’t as bad as it may seem. Newer fabrics allow
light to pass through without too much blur. On hot summer days, a lot less
light is desirable — even if the room temperature is the same, the room feels
cooler with less sunlight. Solar screens work better than sunlight-inhibiting
blinds because they’re on the outside, and the heat isn’t dissipated on the
inside as it is with blinds.
A good do-it-yourself project is to upgrade your existing screens from the
cheap bug screens that are so common, to the solar shade cloth type materi-
als. You don’t need to change all the windows, just the ones where you want
to inhibit sunlight. Big picture windows facing south are the best candidates.
You can get screen at most hardware stores, but you can get the better per-
forming stuff online or in specialized solar catalogs. It’s a very good cost/
benefit tradeoff.
Automatic retractable shades are available from specialty suppliers. In my
area, the big expensive houses generally come with electrically retractable
shades mounted outside on roller tracks. Many of these houses have two
floors of continuous windows facing west. On hot summer days, the sunlight
can be murder, and without a shade the house would be uninhabitable. Plus
in the winter, they can act as insulators.
54
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

Retractable shades are also commonly used overhead for patios and porches,
where late afternoon and evening sunlight can prevent you from using the
area. In this case, leave them up all day, or your floor will heat up. Let the
shade heat up instead, because any breeze will quickly cool it off — not so
with concrete or tile floors, which hold heat for a long time.
Optimizing Operating Schedules
Most people set their thermostats to the desired temperature and then leave
it be. But if you adjust your home’s temperature at different times of the day,
you can achieve cost savings without any decrease in standard of living at all.
This advice is true in both summer and winter and particularly when nobody
is home during daylight hours.
Controlling heating and cooling
Most people adjust their thermostats manually. You set the temperature, and
your heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system (HVAC) decides how to
get the house there. Conservation calls for setting the temperature at 68°F in
the winter and 82°F in the summer.
You can shut off your air conditioner at night, and your house will likely stay
cool enough to be comfortable. If the temperature is hotter outside than in,
don’t open your windows. If vice versa, open up. You can also lower the ther-
mostat temperature in the winter at night and sleep snug as a bug under a
good comforter.
Busting some popular myths
For the most part, homeowners try to minimize their use of the HVAC.
Everybody understands it costs a lot. You can take further measures to
reduce your costs, but first I need to dispel some common misconceptions:
 A lot of people think that if you turn your system off for a while, it works
all that much harder when you turn it back on. This is not true. HVAC
systems are either off or on. They don’t work harder under any circum-
stances. They just work longer. So if you turn your system off, the energy
you save during that time period will be equal to the energy you need to
get your house back to normal temperature.
You don’t save money by turning your thermostat off and on. You do
save money by turning it down, or in the summer, turning it up.
55
Chapter 3: Making Your Home Energy Efficient

 A lot of people think that if you want your house to get to the set tem-
perature faster, you turn the thermostat past the desired set point. For
example, you come into a cold house and turn the HVAC on and then
adjust the thermostat up to 90°F so things will heat up fast. The system
doesn’t work this way. The temperature will increase only so fast — and
no faster.
You save money by turning your thermostat down as much as possible when-
ever you can (vice versa in the summer). If you can turn it down 15°F
overnight, for eight hours, you can save 5 to 15 percent off your energy bill.
Whenever you’re gone for a few hours, turn your temperature down (in
winter). Vice versa for summer air-conditioning season.
Programming your thermostat
Programmable thermostats can save a lot of money. You can install them
yourself if you get one that’s compatible with your system. Ask at your local
hardware store. Programmable thermostats accomplish the following:
 Make daily or weekly programs that turn your temperatures up and
down without your attention
 Allow manual override so you can always set the temp where you want
it, if only briefly
 Have an occupancy feature that can tell whether somebody’s in the
house; otherwise the temperature stays at standby
I highly recommend automatic controllers. Make sure to get one that has
easy programming and good instructions written clearly on the unit itself;
otherwise, you may be constantly searching for the manual. Also get one that
has a clear, legible, and commonsensical display. It’s amazing how counterin-
tuitive some thermostats are. Who designs these things, anyway?
Opening and closing windows and doors
In the same way that you can save by programming your HVAC system to
operate at varying levels at different times of day or night, you can also
achieve cost savings by strategically opening and closing windows and doors
over the course of a day.
When you want breezes through your house, open windows and doors only
on the windward and leeward sides of the house, and try to balance the open-
ings. Don’t just open every window you can. Experiment a little and you’ll see
the different results.
56
Part I: Playing the Energy Game 

In addition, follow these tips:
 For best effect, use blinds and window coverings in conjunction with
opening and closing windows. (See “Window Covers: Blinds, Awnings,
and Shades,” earlier in this chapter.)
 For cooling purposes, open windows that aren’t in the direct sunlight.
 If you have multiple stories, opening windows on different floors can
increase the flow of breezes. Experiment to see what works best.
 In the winter, open all blinds that are exposed to the sun. Let the sun
shine into the room instead of striking the blind. Close the blinds when
the outside is cold and lightless in order to insulate the window as much
as possible.
 Use blinds and drapes wisely. Open them when you want sunlight and
heat to come in. Close them when your air conditioner is running. And
most people don’t do this, but close them on cold nights to add an extra
layer of insulation to the windows.

efore you start getting your hands dirty with solar

of the basic technologies behind solar equipment. You

solar investment will get you the best return on your hard-
earned investment dollars. In this part, I show you how to

hen you understand the basics of radiation, you’re in a better position
to decide on the optimum solar-energy system to install in your home.
You don’t have to rely on a salesperson’s wild claims and potentially suffer an
avoidable disappointment when things don’t pan out as advertised. Knowledge
is power, and power is what this book is all about. It can take many forms.
Understanding the Nature of Light
The sun is a huge nuclear reactor that’s converting its own mass into light
particles, or photons. Trillions of photons fill Earth’s atmosphere every
second; the sun pervades us with its photons.
Imagine snakes squirming frantically across a hot road. Their entire bodies
wriggle in such a way that the motion pushes them forward. You can picture a
photon precisely the same way, except the squirming, or oscillating, is much
faster. And photons never rest; they’re always moving at the speed of light. An
important aspect of a photon is it’s wavelength, which is just what it sounds
like. In the case of the snake, the wavelength is the distance between two suc-
cessive peaks in its wriggling motion. Larger snakes have longer wavelengths,
and vice versa. It will also be true that larger snakes wriggle much slower than
smaller snakes, and this is called the frequency. Wavelength and frequency are
inversely related; both terms you will encounter in the literature, but they basi-
cally just mean the same thing, except in mirror image.

62
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 
Wavelength is important for solar systems because all the physical compo-
nents that make up a solar system respond differently to different wave-
lengths. For example, the sun puts out far more infra-red radiation than
visible, although we humans don’t see any infra-red at all. In some solar appli-
cations, it’s the infra-red that is the most important, in other applications we
may only be interested in visible light.
When you focus your eyesight on an object, you see the light that has reflected
off that object. So when you see a green plant, the plant has absorbed all the
wavelengths besides green. When you see white, you’re seeing all the colors at
the same time. A white object generally doesn’t absorb any colors of light at 
all — it reflects them. On the other hand, a black object absorbs everything.
This property is very useful for solar projects because you’re interested in cre-
ating equipment that absorbs as much sunlight as possible.
The peak of the spectrum occurs in the visible region. Below visible (on the
wavelength scale) is ultraviolet light, and above visible is infrared. Each photon
has energy, and you see different colors because your eyes react to differences
in energy. Red photons have less energy than blue, and infrared photons have
much less energy than ultraviolet. From a physics standpoint, there’s no difference
between photons that are visible or invisible, aside from different energies, but
your eyes discriminate and draw conclusions. Figure 4-1 shows the complete
spectrum of sunlight.
Getting off light: The sun’s good behavior
Here are some facts about the sun:
 The sun’s nuclear reaction consumes 4.2
million tons of mass per second. Not to
worry, though. At this rate, the sun will last
another 6 billion years, which is probably a
lot longer than mankind will last.
 The Earth intercepts only 2 billionths of the
sun’s total energy output. Humans are but
insignificant pipsqueaks in the grand
scheme of things.
 The amount of sunlight that falls on the
Earth’s surface is 35,000 times the amount
of total energy used by humans. That’s a lot
of sunlight to spare.
 At sea level on a clear day, 1 kWh of sun-
light falls on a 1-square-meter area. That’s
enough power to run most appliances in
your house.

Here Comes the Sun: Radiation 
Reacting with Matter
In the context of solar power, radiation simply means sunlight, the entire
spectrum. When engineering a solar system, the interaction between sunlight
and the various materials that comprise the system is of utmost concern.
Without the proper interaction, the system will be inefficient and may not
work the way it’s supposed to.

Chapter 4: Working with Solar Basics

A bit of light interaction
Radiation reacts with matter in a number of ways, all of which can play a role
in your solar-power system:
 Absorption: When a photon is absorbed, it’s energy is changed into a
different form, either heat of electrical energy. Every solar system is pri-
marily concerned with absorption, for until that happens there is no
capture of energy.
 Transmission: When light simply goes right through a medium, it’s
called transmission. Windows are good transmitters, and the atmos-
phere is a rather good transmitter when the air’s clear and smog free.
 Scattering: Scattering occurs when photons interact with molecules, the
result being that a “secondary” form of radiation emits in many direc-
tions at once. Scattering is responsible for such diverse phenomenon as
rainbows and the dusk/dawn reddening of the sky.
In the atmosphere, light scatters off individual molecules, and scattering
occurs much more readily with blue light than red. Hence, when you
look up into the sky, you see blue because blue light is bouncing around
all over the place. On the other hand, when you see light that has trav-
eled through a lot of atmosphere (in the evenings and mornings) it often
appears red because that wavelength passes through the atmosphere
the most easily.
 Reflection: Mirrors are reflectors. In general, shiny, hard surfaces are
much better reflectors than porous, dark surfaces. Reflection differs
from scattering in that the direction of a reflection is a mirror image of
the incident (the original) photon.
Some mediums pass radiation, but also insulate heat very well. This idea is
useful with solar collectors because you want sunlight to enter your system,
but after it’s converted into heat, you don’t want that to get back out. Glass
impregnated with iron silicon transmits wide spectrums of light and also
insulates heat very well.
When a medium doesn’t transmit or reflect all wavelengths equally, it’s called
a filter. People can make windows that pass visible light very well but reflect
ultraviolet. Sunglasses are a perfect example of filters. By selectively filtering
certain wavelengths, for example, ultra-violet, visibility can be enhanced
while cutting out heat. Filter performance also comes into play when design-
ing glazing for solar water heating collectors (glazing is the material that
covers the collector and allows sunlight to enter the system). (See Chapter
10.) In this case, it is desirable to allow the maximum amount of sunlight to
enter the system, and so the filter properties are centered where the most
sunlight is, namely the visible and near infra-red regions of the spectrum.
64
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

All materials are a combination of reflectors, transmitters, and absorbers. For
example, windows transmit only around 85 percent of the light that strikes
them; they reflect the rest. Likewise, Earth’s atmosphere reflects, absorbs,
and transmits, and each acts as a filter because each effect depends on the
wavelength of the incident light (incident just means the light that’s coming
into a surface). The windows in your home, while they may not seem like it,
filter out a lot of sunlight. When people mess around with the composition of
the atmosphere, for example by loading it with carbon dioxide or other pollu-
tant molecules, they end up inadvertently changing weather patterns. That’s
the gist of global warming, which I touch on in the next section.
Look! Up in the sky! Light 
through the atmosphere
Figure 4-1 (earlier in this chapter) shows the difference between the spec-
trum of sunlight that hits Earth’s upper atmosphere and the spectrum that
reaches ground level. Under normal conditions, as much as 35 percent of
solar radiation is reflected back into space or absorbed before it hits the sur-
face of the Earth. In the presence of clouds or pollution, the reflection and
absorption can be much greater.
Water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone absorb 10 to 15 percent of sunlight.
In the upper atmosphere, ozone (three oxygen atoms bonded together, or O3)
filters out virtually all the ultraviolet radiation (short wavelength radiation —
very energetic. Note in Figure 4-1 that plenty of ultraviolet light comes from
the sun, but almost none of it actually reaches the Earth’s surface. If it were
to reach the planet’s surface, life would drastically change.
65
Chapter 4: Working with Solar Basics
The greenhouse effect
Some materials are very good at transmitting
radiation while at the same time insulating for
heat. For example, as Earth’s atmosphere fills up
with carbon dioxide, the air still passes along
the same amount of radiation, but the atmos-
phere becomes better at trapping heat. The net
effect is that the Earth is heating up more than it
would under completely natural circumstances.
Glass (which you find in actual greenhouses)
likewise transmits radiation and insulates at the
same time. To give you an idea of how profound
the effect is, consider that a car sitting in the
sun heats up because of the same greenhouse
effect. And everyone knows just how miserably
hot a car can get.

A number of years ago, people were greatly concerned about the hole in the
ozone layer. But this concern was partially allayed with the banning of certain
aerosols and refrigerants that contained ozone-depleting compounds called
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), commonly known as Freon. Here’s a good example
of how environmental policy actually works!
In addition, atmospheric depth makes all the difference. At noon, when the
sun is directly overhead, sunlight passes through much less atmosphere than
at dawn or dusk (see Figure 4-2).
You can see why the middle of the day is hottest. It’s not because, as some
people believe, the sun is closer. Rather, the sunlight passes through much
less atmosphere. The Earth is tilted on its axis, –23° to be precise. Figure 4-3
shows what happens as Earth rotates.
The sun seems hotter in the summer than in the winter, but that’s not really
true. The sun doesn’t change; it’s the air and the position of the Earth that
change. Less sunlight energy reaches the Earth’s surface in the winter for the
same reason that you get less solar energy at dawn and dusk.

Using Sunlight Converted into Heat
When a photon (light particle) strikes a surface that absorbs light, the
photon’s energy is transformed into heat. Heat, or thermal energy, is simply
motion. A hot surface has a lot of molecular motion, and hot objects can burn
you because they pass their excessive energy right into your skin.
The following sections explain the basics of heat transfer and how that may
influence what goes into your solar collector.
On the move: Modes of heat transfer
Many solar applications require sunlight to be converted into heat. Then you
want to transfer that heat and change it into a usable form, usually in a loca-
tion removed from where the heat is captured. Heat can move from one spot
to another in several ways:
 Conduction: In conduction, energy is transferred between molecules
within a substance. Only heat moves, not the molecules. (Well, mole-
cules are always moving, but the molecules tend to vibrate in place
rather than switch places.) Heat always moves from a hotter surface to a
cooler surface (technically speaking, heat moves in both directions, but
statistically the most movement occurs from hotter to cooler). Copper is
an excellent conductor of heat. In fact, most good conductors of electric-
ity are also good heat conductors. Glass is a poor conductor of heat and
electricity and is therefore considered an insulator.

Chapter 4: Working with Solar Basics

 Convection: Convection is the transfer of heat between a fixed, rigid sur-
face and a moving fluid in contact with that surface or the transfer of heat
as molecules move from one point to another within the fluid. A fluid is
any substance that can flow, so air is also considered a fluid. As opposed
to conduction, the hot molecules themselves move and switch places.
Water flowing over a hot surface becomes hot. In a tank of water, the
hotter molecules expand and weigh less and move upwards while gravity
draws the colder, heavier molecules down. This heat exchange is called
thermosiphon, and it’s a type of convection.
 Radiation: A hot object emits infrared radiation. The sun is a perfect
radiator. Fires radiate heat, a lot of which you can see. A really hot fire
glows white; all wavelengths in the spectrum are present. As the fire cools
down, the color changes to orange, then to red, and finally, when you can’t
see the embers anymore but can still feel the heat, the radiation is entirely
infrared. The colors reflect the energy content of the fire.
In Chapter 10, I get into detail on how solar heating systems make use of
these properties. In fact, every engineered system must take into account
heating and cooling concerns because there is always a transfer of energy
from one part of a system to another. If there weren’t a transfer of energy,
nothing would be happening, and it would be a political system instead of an
engineered system.
Keeping the heat where you want it 
Solar heat collectors are designed to collect as much solar radiation as possible.
Not only do you want to maximize surface area, but you also want to orient the
collector in a way that maximizes the amount of solar radiation gathered over
the course of a day. Solar heat collectors also ought to do the following, all of
which affect what kind of materials go where in your solar collector:
 Convert that radiation into heat as efficiently as possible. This conver-
sion almost always entails the use of a black surface, which absorbs
radiation efficiently.
 Transfer the heat into a usable medium. In most cases, you want to
heat water. If you collect the heat in a black tube, you can simply run
water through that tube, and the heat naturally transfers into the water.
Other fluids, such as antifreeze fluid (which doesn’t freeze up in winter)
may also be used.
To move heat effectively, a material needs to be a good conductor (or as
physicists like to say, it needs to have high thermal conductivity).
68
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

 Insulate to prevent heat loss. For insulators, you want to use materials
that make for poor conductors. Converting radiation into heat in the
wintertime is easy, but then the cold weather and wind simply steal the
heat right back. In order to prevent this loss, people insulate the collec-
tor from the outside world with materials, such as fiberglass insulation,
or double-pane glass windows.
 Store a sufficient amount of heat. Heat capacity is a measure of how
much heat energy (in British thermal units, or Btus) is required to raise
the temperature of a given volume of a material by one degree
Fahrenheit. To be effective at storing heat, a material needs a high heat
capacity. Table 4-1 shows some materials of interest.

So the ideal material for storing and moving heat needs to have a high heat
capacity and also has to be a good conductor. Although wood and concrete
store a lot of heat, you can’t move it into or out of these materials very easily.
Steel is very good, but it rusts. Of course, water is the cheapest, so it’s used
to store and transfer heat, but the problem is that it doesn’t absorb radiation
because it’s clear. Copper painted black absorbs, stores, and conducts heat
extremely well, so copper is used extensively in solar heat collectors.
69
Chapter 4: Working with Solar Basics

Converting Sunlight into Electricity:
Photovoltaic Cells
Most people are familiar with photovoltaic cells (PV cells). You see them on
calculators, the kind that don’t require batteries. You see PV panels on
people’s roofs and on businesses and schools and government buildings.
Remote telephones along the interstates have PV panels poised overhead.
A standard PV cell, shown in Figure 4-4, is a thin semiconductor sandwich,
with two layers of highly purified silicon. A semiconductor is a crystal that is
constructed in such a way as to yield certain specific properties that can be
used in electrical circuits. Transistors are made of semiconductors.
Microprocessors are as well. In fact, the entire field of modern electronics
uses various forms of semiconductors, so the implications are worldly. If you
connect an electrical circuit to your semiconductor sandwich when sunlight
is shining on it, electricity flows. 
Photovoltaic arrays are nothing more than huge matrices of interconnected
semiconductor sandwiches. The color appears shiny blue. Usable PV systems
are comprised of all sorts of equipment that protects the user from electrical
shock, stores the electricity in battery banks, and converts the direct current
(DC) into alternating current (AC), which is what people use in their houses.
But at the heart of each system is a simple conversion process like that shown
in Figure 4-4.

epending on where you live geographically — and the orientation and
exposure of your particular house or business — you get more or less
usable sunshine. Even within small, localized regions, weather patterns vary
due to topography and landscape details like trees and ponds. So two identi-
cal solar systems separated by a few miles, but otherwise built and operated
identically, may yield different energy outputs averaged over a period of time.
In this chapter, I explain the factors that allow you to optimize the orientation
and location of solar systems at your home. This information can give you a
head start in making important decisions, such as which type of system will
work best for you, how big a system you will need, and how much potential,
in relative terms, you can expect to achieve. Above all, this chapter gives you
an idea how to evaluate the relative economics of a solar investment, the
details of which I get into in Chapter 6, on payback analysis.
Mother Nature in Your Neck 
of the Woods: Climate
Weather is today’s phenomenon, but climate is a description of the general
weather patterns over a long period of time. It may be cold and rainy in Los
Angeles today, and that’s the weather, but the climate is warm and temperate.
Good solar designers assess climate particulars to enhance system perfor-
mance. Climate includes elements such as temperature, precipitation, and
wind speed. Here’s a look at how climate can affect your solar system:

 Sunlight: Climate dictates how much sunlight you can expect annually.
The map in Figure 5-1 shows the average number of hours per day of
sunshine in the United States and Canada. That the Southwest gets the
most sunshine per day — and that Canada and the northern states get
the least — should come as no surprise. The sun is higher in the sky in
the southern states, so the days are longer.
 Snowfall: You want to locate your panels so they avoid being inundated
with heavy layers of snow. For example, some locations on your roof will
experience very shallow snow buildups as compared to other parts of
your roof. Also, some parts of your roof may be warmer than others due
to proximity to heaters, exhausts, chimneys, and so on.
 Cloud cover: If you’re living in a cloudy region, you still have solar
energy, and it’s generally diffused (spread out). As a result, collector
panel orientation isn’t so critical because light will be coming in at many
different angles rather than just directly overhead from the sun.
 Smog: Air pollution and smog affect the amount of sunlight you can
expect to receive. If you do live in an area with heavy air pollution,
expect less system output over an extended period of time.
 Air density: You get better solar exposure in the mountains than near
sea level simply because the air is thinner and scatters less sunlight. You
can make an approximate estimate of how clear your air is by simply
observing how blue the sky is on a clear day. Thick air scatters more red
light, and so the appearance of the sky is less blue and more white.
 Temperature: With PV systems (not solar water heaters), the lower the
temperature, the happier the semiconductors, and the greater the
output. You can get more system output on a cold, clear day than a
sunny day.
 Frequent fog: If you’re living in an area that’s foggy and misty in the
morning (in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example) but the mist burns
off into a clear sky by noon, you want to orient your solar panels more
westward to optimize the amount of sunlight you can achieve over the
course of a day.
 Wind: If you have a lot of wind, you need to consider where you mount
your solar equipment for a couple of reasons:
• Wind can tear equipment off of its mounting hardware and result in
expensive repairs, not to mention dangerous conditions. If you’re
in a windy climate, you need to make sure that you specify, heavy-
duty mounting equipment. Mounting schemes all have wind speed
specifications; pay close attention because mishaps are expensive.

Chapter 5: Evaluating Your Solar Potential
• Wind cools surfaces very efficiently (through convection — see
Chapter 4 for details on heat transfer). If you have a swimming
pool, one of your best bets is to install landscaping that breaks the
rush of wind that will cool the pool water much more than your
intuition would indicate. Solar water heating panels may heat the
water very effectively, but it doesn’t make much sense to install
expensive solar panels without addressing wind cooling first,
because adding a few bushes and trees will be much cheaper than
adding extra collector capacity. Plus it looks nicer and is better for
the environment.You can obtain generalized information and maps
about the nation’s solar resources from the following:
 The National Renewable Energy Laboratory: Located in Golden,
Colorado, the NREL (www.nrel.gov) has a solar resources section on
its Web site; follow the prompts to obtain a data log for your city, or a
nearby large city. You can get an estimate of the BTU’s/square meter/day
you can expect. This data is valuable because it averages out all of the
factors that I explain in the previous bulleted list.
 National Climatic Data Center: The NCDC (www.ncdc.noaa.gov), in
Asheville, North Carolina, claims to have the world’s largest archive of
climate data.
Plotting Your Sun Charts
Sun charts plot how much direct sunlight you can expect over the course of a
day. They’re an easy and intuitive way to visually display the movement of
the sun across the sky. The following sections explain how to create your
own sun charts and how to use them to evaluate the amount of sunshine you
can expect to receive at your home.
Considering climate and energy use
Your climate dictates how much energy you
need and when you need it. In temperate cli-
mates, the requirement for heating and cooling
is generally lower. In northern climates, you
don’t need to worry about cooling your house at
all. Your problem is how to heat your house in
the winter.
Part of assessing climate is what you want your
solar system to do for you. If you have a cabin
in northern Minnesota, you probably won’t be
there much in the wintertime. And then you’ll
heat it using renewable wood. In the summer,
you don’t need to cool, and all you want to do is
obtain some nighttime lighting and run a small,
efficient refrigerator. In this case, a modest, off-
grid photovoltaic system with a battery backup
can do the job. Even if you get only a few hours
of sun each day, and it’s low in the sky, you can
still install a system that works for you.

76
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 
Charting out the basic path of the sun
The position of the sun may be plotted with two angles (azimuth, which is the
angle from true south, and elevation, which is the angle from level, or in most
cases the horizon), as shown in Figure 5-2.
Figure 5-3 shows you how to create a graph of the sun’s passage over the
course of a day. Imagine a sheet of graph paper wrapped around your house.
Figure 5-4 shows what your sun chart looks like if you plot the movement of
the sun over the course of a day on your graph paper. The arc in the middle
represents either spring or fall. All other paths lie somewhere between the
two extremes, represented by summer and winter equinox, which are the
longest and shortest days of the year.
Adding skyline effects
You can easily add a skyline (any impediments to direct sunlight, which
includes horizon, buildings, trees, towers, and so on) to your sun charts.
Trees, neighboring roofs, tall buildings, mountains — you can easily include
each of these (see Figure 5-5).

Chapter 5: Evaluating Your Solar Potential
When the sun goes behind a mountain or a tall building, you don’t get any
direct sunlight at all. If the sun goes behind a tree, you may get some direct
sunlight, but mostly you get shading. The horizon changes the time of dawn
and dusk. If your house has a big mountain to the direct west, dusk falls a lot
earlier. If you go up on your roof, the whole skyline profile should change
compared to that on the ground. Each location on your house has a different
skyline.

You can either buy (very expensive, and you only need it once) or rent 
($25 per week) a Solar Pathfinder (www.solarpathfinder.com), which
works as follows: You stand at the site you want to measure, aim the device
south (it has a compass), level it (it has a bubble level), and then read the
shade reflections on a domed indicator. A chart under the dome shows hours
and months when any bit of shade will be a problem. These devices are
rather complex, but they’re interesting because you can see how they incor-
porate all the ideas in this chapter.
Noting sunlight intensity
In addition to how much direct sunlight you get, sunlight intensity is impor-
tant. When the sun is lower in the sky, solar radiation must pass through
more atmosphere, and it’s therefore reduced by scattering and absorption.
Figure 5-6, which is very similar in nature to a sun chart, shows how it works.
The sun is the most intense when it’s directly overhead. And summer sun-
light is much stronger than winter. You already know that — all you do now is
make a plot to show what your intuition already understands.
Sunlight likewise changes along with the weather. Figure 5-7 shows what hap-
pens when the weather’s cloudy or foggy. If your climate is often foggy or
hazy in the morning, the charts show a very shallow curve on the left-hand
side, and then when the fog burns off, the chart goes back up to normal.

Collector Cross Sections
The final piece of the puzzle is collector cross section. Imagine a sheet of paper
that you look at from different perspectives. If you set it on a table and look
down, directly at it, it will look like a sheet of paper, nice and rectangular; you
see the entire extent of the paper. If you look at it from the side, you will
hardly see anything at all except a thin line. As you move your perspective
around, the sheet grows bigger and smaller, and the rectangle becomes a par-
allelogram with odd angles. A fixed solar collector works on the same princi-
ple. The more surface area that is exposed to direct sunlight, the more output
the collector is capable of.
How you orient your collectors with respect to the sun-chart angles is of criti-
cal importance. For example, if you mount your collectors facing north, you
will obviously get more sunlight than if they’re facing south, simply due to
cross-section issues. If you mount your collector facing toward the west, you
will get afternoon and evening system output. In this section, I explore some
results of cross-section engineering that are of practical use.
Pretend you’re the sun, looking down on your own house. Figure 5-8 shows
what a solar panel would look like from different vantages.

To get a better understanding of the relationship of the angles, set a business
card in a reclined, fixed position on a table top and then move around from
side to side, and up and down (mimicking the way the sun moves over the
sky during the course of a day and over the seasons), noting how much area
of the card you can see from different vantage points.
The difference in the sky between equinoxes (middle of winter and middle of
summer) is 46°, which is considerable. Try it for yourself with the business
card setup. If the angle is off by 25°, you still pick up 90 percent of available
radiation (which means you see 90 percent of the full surface area). Off by 45°,
and it goes down to 71 percent. Even at 80°, you still get 17 percent exposure.
Plus, there’s a lot of scattering in the air. Even after the sun is set, some sun-
light is still available.
Earth: Going full tilt
The Earth is tilted on its axis 23.5°, and the 
following figure shows what happens to the
position of the sun in the sky over the course of
a year.
Regardless of where you live, the difference
between the sun’s peak angles in the sky from
December to June is 46°. Regions closest to the
poles experience seasons when the sun never
shines, and six months later, seasons when the
sun never goes below the horizon (known as
white night).
The optimum elevation angle for your solar
system depends on your latitude. In general, the
optimum tilt angle is equal to your latitude, for
this will ensure the maximum amount of sunlight
exposure over the course of a year. Even better
would be to manually change the elevation of
your solar collectors over the course of a year
to “follow” the sun’s elevation in the sky.

In most cases, you may not have much choice. If your roof faces southwest
and its pitch is 45°, that’s how you’ll end up mounting, unless you want to get
into some really odd-looking and expensive mounting racks.
The best orientations face due south. As for altitude, the best bet is to orient
the panels to the altitude of the sun in the middle of the equinoxes, or around
March 20 and September 20. This angle depends on your latitude.
If you need more power, simply install more surface area. It’s cheaper and
more reliable than installing moving mounts that track the sun. The idea is to
maximize the cross section at all times. You clearly get more energy out of
your system with moving mounts, so it’s a calculation of cost versus gain; but
moving trackers are expensive and have moving parts, so they fail and
require maintenance. And experience has taught that moving mounts just
aren’t worth it for the vast majority of applications.

Calculating Payback on Your 
Solar Investment
In This Chapter:
 Using a system for analyzing the solar options
 Looking at real-life scenarios you can compare with your decisions
W
ith every investment, you have options. You don’t need to invest in
solar energy at all. You can just leave your house the way it is and
instead put your riches toward life insurance, stocks and bonds, real estate,
and so on. When something breaks, you don’t have to replace it with solar;
you can just put the same thing back in. But as the financial pros say, you
should assemble a mixture of investments to limit your risk, and solar power
may be just the ticket to help balance your portfolio — and help the environ-
ment in the process.
Hedging is making investments that reduce risk. If you invest in solar, you
shield your utility bill from energy price fluctuations. If you put a solar system
on your roof that reduces your energy bills to zero, that’s exactly where they’ll
stay, even if the cost of energy quadruples. That’s a powerful form of hedging.
In this chapter, I give you the big picture on calculating payback — the amount
of time you have to wait to recoup your investment — and help you evaluate
the costs, gains, and risks of solar power. I also help you analyze solar invest-
ments so you can see what kinds of returns you can expect. Finally, I take you
through some real-life scenarios so you can see the numbers in action.
Analyzing Solar Investments
An important factor to consider when deciding how much money to earmark
toward each investment is the risk profile. Some investments entail more risk
than others. A bank is much safer than the stock market, for example. When
an investment entails more risk, it needs to offer more of a chance for gain to
offset the increased risk.

84
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 
The following sections outline a system for analyzing solar investments. The
goal is to compare different investment options using the same criteria of
costs, gains, and risks and then choose the best one.
Calculating net costs
The first step in calculating payback is to calculate costs. In this chapter, I dis-
cuss net costs, which means the total net amount that you’re paying for your
solar investment. These days, most solar investments are eligible for rebates
and tax advantages, which are subtracted from the “retail” cost of a system.
Collecting cost data
The typical solar system has many cost components, and the sum total of all
the individual costs must be added up to yield the total cost. Note also that
the timing of the costs is important, as well as the timing of the rebates and
tax advantages. Timing is important because of the basic idea that a dollar
today is worth more than a dollar in one year, the difference being given by
current interest rates. So the result of a cost compilation will usually be a
timeline rather than a single number.
Consider the following factors:
 Equipment: Sometimes equipment costs are spread out over time — for
example, if you get financing from a supplier or different parts of a system
are delivered at different times. You need to specify the timeline, as well
as the dollar value of each outlay.
 Installation costs: If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, you won’t have to worry
about installation. If you hire out, installation costs may be either fixed
or an hourly rate, depending on the complexity of the job.
 Refuse: Add in costs if you’ll pay to have project trash hauled away.
 Maintenance: Consider the likelihood that you’ll have to pay for
servicing — and when that may occur, so you know whether it’s likely 
to be covered by warranty.
 Taxes, permits, fees: Note when such charges are due.
 Interest: If you finance your equipment, the interest is a cost.
 Taxes: Many states have legislation that lets you install solar equipment
without paying higher property taxes, but you should find out whether 
it applies to you (see Chapter 22 for details on state incentives). In rare
cases, property taxes may go up as a result of a solar investment.

Subtracting estimated gains and discounts
You recover some of your expenses right away, so you can subtract that amount
from your costs. For example, you may be able to take advantage of rebates and
subsidies offered by utilities, state and federal governments, manufacturers, and
so on. Or if you’re installing equipment for your home business or office, you
may be able to depreciate certain items. (See Chapter 21 for details.)
You also need to consider both salvage (if you can sell some of the old equip-
ment you’ll be taking out) and appreciation — the value of your home goes up
when you install solar. The appreciation amount depends on the following:
 The cost for a homebuyer to put in new equipment personally: Don’t
expect to get much more than that. However, if the cost of new solar
equipment increases, the value of your equipment can also go up.
Equipment can increase in value if inflation becomes significant or 
if the demand for solar equipment increases (supply versus demand).
 The amount of documentable energy savings achieved with the equip-
ment: Your energy bills provide proof of the energy savings achieved.
 Changes in energy costs: The more energy costs rise (all energy), the
more your equipment — and thus your property — is worth.
 Popularity: Some things sell because of a fad. In some real estate markets,
a solar home is worth a lot more than the same model with conventional
energy.
85
Chapter 6: Calculating Payback on Your Solar Investment
$1 today versus $1 tomorrow
Strictly speaking, when doing payback calcula-
tions, the time cost of money must be taken into
account, which basically means that you dis-
count the value today of a receipt of a dollar in
the future.
Suppose that you have a choice between two
alternatives: $1 today or $1 a year from now. You
take the $1 today, of course. But how much
would you be willing to trade that dollar today
for a payment in one year? The answer is given
by the current interest rate, or even more pre-
cisely, by what the interest rate is going to be
over the course of the next year. Say that the
interest rate is 6 percent. Then you would trade
a dollar today for $1.06 a year from today.
In calculating payback, it works the other way
around. For example, if you’re going to save
$100 a year from now, that savings is only worth
$94 today (at 6 percent interest).
In the following calculations, I ignore the time
cost of money, for simplicity sake. A way to
account for the time cost of money, without
making the computations overly complex, is just
be very conservative. The net effect is the same.

Giving a ballpark about how much appreciation you can expect is impossible,
but the most likely case is that you’ll get around 25 percent more than new
equipment costs. Best case, you may double your original investment after
five years. Worst case, you may not get anything at all if the equipment is old
and obsolete.
Figuring out monthly savings
With most solar investments, lowering monthly utility bills is the ultimate
goal. Here’s how to calculate your potential savings:
1. Look at your power bills and determine your average monthly energy
use (gas or electric).
Use the electric bill if the new system will reduce your use of electricity,
the gas bill if it’ll reduce your gas use.
Suppose, for example, you want to replace an electric water heater with
a solar one. You look at your power bills and find that you use an aver-
age of 1,000 kWh of electricity per month.
2. Out of that number, estimate how much energy the system you’re
replacing uses or how much energy the new system produces.
86
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 
Making online calculations
Fortunately, a number of resources can help you
gather numbers for the calculations, and some
even walk you through an automated calcula-
tion. You just answer their questions, and they
crunch the numbers:
 Database of State Incentives for Renewable
Energy: Visit www.dsireusa.org. DSIRE
is a comprehensive source of information on
state, local, utility, and federal incentives that
promote renewable energy and energy
efficiency.
 Clean Power Estimator: Check out www.
consumerenergycenter.org/rene
wables/estimator. 
Clean 
Power
Estimator is an economic evaluation software
program the California Energy Commission is
licensing for use from Clean Power Research.
The program provides California residential
and commercial electric customers a per-
sonalized estimate of the costs and benefits
of investing in a photovoltaic (PV) solar or
small wind electric generation system.
 The Energy Grid: See www.pvwatts.
org. This tool allows you to estimate the
number of watts of power you can expect
from your solar system in a given geograph-
ical area.
 Find Solar: Go to www.findsolar.com.
These estimators are driven by extensive
databases of solar ratings, regional
weather conditions, and applicable incen-
tives. Very practical.

In the example, perhaps an energy audit tells you that water heating
makes up 20 percent of your total electric bill (see Chapter 2 for more on
energy audits).
To estimate output of a PV system, use the specifications given for the
proposed equipment and modify them up or down depending on your
solar exposure (see Chapter 5). Ultimately, you’re going to be making an
educated guess. The best way to get a good estimate is to ask your pro-
fessional contractor because he has experience and local empirical data.
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, the problem is more difficult. The best way to
account for the inescapably hazy nature of projections is to be conserva-
tive and see how the economics come out. Then redo the calculations
with optimistic numbers and see how the payback calculations turn out.
3. Multiply your average monthly energy costs by the percentage you
found in Step 2 to figure out how much you save per month.
At $0.15 per kWh, suppose the total monthly bill is $150:
$150 × 20% = $30
The solar water heater therefore saves you $30 per month.
If your power company’s cost per kWh depends on when you use the energy
or how much you use, always use the rate structure that is going to apply
after you finish the project. For example, if you install a PV system in
California, you’re likely to get a new power meter and a new rate structure.
You may be going from a tiered structure to a TOU structure, in which case
you should estimate the cost savings by the TOU structure (see Chapter 2 for
details on rate structures). Rate structures are changing all the time, but it’s
likely that most areas are heading for the TOU structure that California cur-
rently uses. It’s also true in California that utilities have to pay you the same
rate they charge you, which isn’t necessarily true in other parts of the coun-
try. The devil is in the details.
As energy costs rise, your savings increase even more. The Energy
Information Administration reported that from 1996 to 2007, electricity
energy costs increased an average of 2.2 percent per year (www.eia.doe.
gov/emeu/steo/pub/contents.html), and the change may be even
greater in the future — or in your region of the country.
Putting the numbers together: 
Figuring payback
Payback is the amount of time you need to hold on to your investment for it
to pay for itself. In the case of solar, almost the entire investment is upfront,
meaning you have to invest cash before you see a single dime of savings.
87
Chapter 6: Calculating Payback on Your Solar Investment

Payback is measured in years or months. You simply take the net costs of
your solar system (costs minus discounts and appreciation — see the earlier
“Calculating net costs” section) and divide it by your anticipated monthly
savings (see “Figuring out monthly savings”). For example, if you invest
$2,000 in a solar water heater that saves $30 a month in electric costs, here’s
your payback period:
$2,000 ÷ $30/month ≈67 months, or 5.6 years
Analyzing risk
No investment is risk-free. The following elements can affect the returns you
get on your investment:
 Repairs and maintenance: Solar equipment is not simple when it’s
doing a big job. And being outdoors all the time is wearing, especially in
extreme climates (how’d you like to be strapped to a roof 24/7?) You
can’t always anticipate when something will break down, and if your
equipment has problems after the warranty expires, your costs go up.
 Efficiency decreases over time, just as it does for autos and humans
and pretty much everything. PV panels may see a 15-percent decline in
ten years. It’s harder to estimate the decline in water systems, but it’s on
the same order, unless you’re using hard water or have well water with a
lot of sediment. Use 15 percent per ten years in your calculations for a
good approximation.
 Lifetime: Eventually, every system will simply not be worth running any-
more. PV systems are warranted up to 20 years, water systems for up to
15. However, it’s not as bad as that, because what the warranties really
cover is guaranteed performance. You will probably be able to run your
systems for much longer than the warranties, but they simply won’t be
putting out the same performance.
 Inexperience: If you design and install a system yourself, the perfor-
mance may not be as good as you planned. The experts know all the
little tricks, but you don’t. Savings can suffer, and you may have to pay
an expert to come in and set things straight.
 Newer, more efficient technologies: People like new things because
they’re new. The bottom line with a solar system is the performance it’s
putting out, but it may be true that a homebuyer simply doesn’t like a
system that’s 10 years old simply because it’s 10 years old. Newer equip-
ment is always more efficient as well. This increased efficiency rarely
results in a situation that merits tossing out old equipment that is still
working, but it may make a difference to a prospective buyer.
88
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

Accounting for the intangibles
Good decisions aren’t just predicated on dollars and cents. You also need to
consider the intangibles, such as aesthetic beauty and pollution mitigation,
among others. Not everything comes with a price tag, but you certainly need
to factor in how much these elements are worth to you. You can do this by
either assigning dollar values, as best you can, or making a list of priorities so
that if two potential options have the same numerical score (payback calcula-
tion), one option will win over the other based on the intangibles.
Allowing for drawbacks
You should account for any inconvenience. Note whether your system is going
to require more work on your part. Solar water heaters, for example, take
maintenance. Decide whether you’re going to do it or hire someone else to do
if for you. In addition, when you install a solar system, you’re introducing dangers
into your house: electrical shocks. Scalding water. Falling off a roof. Discovering
stepladder malfunctions. Think about whether you’re okay accepting these risks.
Also factor in your feelings about the look of your house and how that may
affect resale value. Some solar equipment can be ugly. Do the pipes running
up the side of your house look industrial? Do photovoltaic panels make your
house look unearthly?
89
Chapter 6: Calculating Payback on Your Solar Investment
Paying the piper –– or not
Some investment gains are subject to income
tax and some aren’t. You will need to decide
for yourself, based on your own financial situ-
ation, whether an investment qualifies for
taxes and, if so, how much they may be. (Ask
your tax preparer for accurate details.)
For example, all interest earned from a savings
account is subject to income tax. In the early
spring your bank will send you a statement that
you must include with your tax return submission
(or you’ll be hearing from the IRS). Stock earnings
and dividends are generally taxed as capital
gains, and so on. If you’re in a high income tax
bracket, total taxes may be as high as 50 percent,
in which case this question is very important. If
you’re retired and your income is very low, you
may not have to pay any taxes at all. 
Savings from solar equipment are never taxed. If
you save $1,000 a year on your power bills from a
solar system, the government will not tax that
$1,000 savings. If you’re in a high tax bracket,
solar equipment is a better investment, compar-
atively . Solar equipment may be viewed as a tax
shelter, in this regard. 
When comparing investment options, you
always need to take into account whether
you’re going to be paying income taxes or not.
Accountants generally use after-tax dollars
when they compare options. For the examples
in this chapter, you should amend the results to
jibe with your tax situation. 

Considering priceless benefits
Think about visual improvements. For example, if you invest in a maple tree,
you get shading in the summer, which is a form of solar system performance,
but the greater pleasure is having a nice tree near your house. When you
invest in window coverings, you enjoy better insulation by virtue of the fact
that you can shade your home’s interior from solar radiation, but the greater
gain is probably in the remodel.
Don’t forget environmental improvements: When you invest in solar, you’re
saving a lot of carbon dioxide, and you’re also helping with national energy
independence.
Examining Real-Life Scenarios
Compare your own solar investment decisions with these examples and you
can get a good idea of how your investment stacks up. In most cases, just
substitute in your own numbers. In some cases, you may have to adjust the
model to fit your exact situation.
Decisions often come down to the details of your rate structure. You can find
it on your power bill. You may be able to change your rate structure with a
simple call to the utility. Some allow for choices. In fact, you may be able to
save some money simply by changing your rate structure.
Supplementing an existing
water heater with solar
To calculate payback, first find the monthly energy savings. Suppose Household
X uses an average of 1,000 kWh of electricity per month. At $0.15 per kWh, the
monthly cost is $150. An energy audit determines that water heating com-
prises 18 percent of the total electric bill, at a cost of $27 per month (see the
earlier “Figuring out monthly savings” section for details on such calcula-
tions). With the solar water heater, that amount drops to zero, so $27 is its
monthly savings.
Then determine the net cost of the equipment. A solar water heating system
costs $2,000, including parts and installation. A federal government tax credit
of 30 percent is available, for a total of $600. The net cost is $1,400. The war-
ranty is for 5 years, so the homeowners won’t have to pay maintenance costs
for the first 60 months.
To recover the initial investment of $1,400, Household X will need
$1,400 ÷ $27/month ≈52 months
90
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

That’s a good investment. A solar water heater may last about 20 years, and
Household X is making a profit within the first 5 years.
Putting money in a bank or stock market
Here’s how some other investments stack up: Put $1,000 in a savings account
at 6 percent, and you gain compounded interest. You have $1,000 in interest
12 years after you make your original investment, which is the payback
period. At any point in time, you can pull your money back out of the bank,
with zero risk.
If you put your money into the stock market and get a return of 12 percent,
the payback period is only six years. But the value of your stock could also
go down in value, maybe all the way to zero. Because the risk is much higher
in the stock market, you insist on a higher potential gain or else you’ll just
put your money into a bank.
A good general rule is the Rule of 72: To find the number of years required to
double your money at a given interest rate, just divide the interest rate into
72. For a 12-percent return:
$72 ÷ 12 = 6 years
Accounting for pollution
Suppose you’re installing a solar water heater in an area where the climate is
northern. There isn’t as much sunshine, and the winters are colder. Cost sav-
ings are $13.50 per month (or half as much as in the preceding section). For
this example, assume constant energy costs, which is probably a simplification.
(The point here is to illustrate how you can account for pollution.) When the
monthly savings are cut in half, the payback period for a $1,400 water heater
is twice as long — about 104 months. This isn’t much different from the return
(or payback) you can get at a bank, where there’s zero risk and you can take
your money back out whenever you want. When you invest in solar, you’re
stuck with what you’ve got. This is a bad investment.
But how much is it worth to reduce pollution? Ten dollars a month? Twenty?
How much would you pay to completely eliminate your carbon footprint
altogether? $1,000 a year?
Out of your total carbon footprint (see Chapter 2), figure out how much CO2
the old water heater contributes. The typical carbon footprint is around
91
Chapter 6: Calculating Payback on Your Solar Investment

40,000 pounds per year. The typical footprint from a water heater is 3,000
pounds per year, or 7.5 percent of the total.
If you’re willing to spend $1,000 a year on pollution mitigation, you’d spend
7.5 percent of this on heating water. That’s $75 per year, or $6.25 per month.
Add this to the savings column, and instead of only $13.50 per month, the
real savings is $19.75. This makes the payback 71 months, which is a better
proposition:
$1,400 ÷ ($13.50 + $6.25) ≈71 months
If you’d spend $2,000 a year eliminating pollution, total cost savings are $27
per month, which is all the way back to the original example with a payback
of 52 months (see the preceding section). This is a good investment.
Reaping rewards of rising energy costs
What if energy costs rise 12 percent per year instead of staying flat? That
percentage is higher than historical norms, but it’s not difficult to imagine how
this might come to be, with all the pressure coming to bear on the energy
markets. When energy costs rise, each year the savings grow. Perhaps your
$1,400 solar water heater saves you $27 per month the first year. But the next
year the savings grow to $30.24 per month ($27 × 1.12). Then $33.87 ($30.24 ×
1.12), then $37.93, then $42.49, and so on. Look at the yearly savings to see how
they add up:
Year

$406.43

4
$37.93
$455.20
–$148.51
The payback in this case is 44 months (down from 52 months if the energy
costs were to stay the same).
Regardless of how high energy costs go, the amount that’s being spent on
heating water is locked in at zero. This is a form of hedging, or making an
investment that reduces risk.
Here’s another benefit, not quite as tangible but still very real: There’s no
reason to take shorter showers or skimp on that bath, no matter how high
energy costs may go! A solar heating system has so much capacity; not using
all of it saves nothing.
92
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

Thinking about tiered rate structures
In a tiered rate structure, the more energy you use, the more you pay per kWh. So
in California, for example, not all watts are created equal. Some tiered rate struc-
tures are very punitive, with the highest rates three or four times the base rate.
Solar system savings come from the highest tier first. In such a rate structure,
cost savings can easily be twice as much. Payback is therefore half as long.
A solar water heater may offset 18 percent of the household energy use, but
this may comprise more like 35 percent of the total dollar value in a typical
tiered rate structure.
In a tiered rate structure, small investments work best. As the size of your
investment grows, the payback gets worse because you get less and less
return on your investment.
Appreciating a solar home’s 
increase in value
Suppose some homeowners decide to sell five years after installing a solar
water heater. Energy costs are rising, and monthly savings from the solar
water heating system are now $48 per month, or $600 per year. A home buyer
will pay more for the home because of this built-in cost reduction.
How much more? New systems cost $2,800, and tax rebates are a thing of the
past because everybody and their brother are now in the market for solar. A
lot of work is involved, and most buyers don’t want to do it. They’d have to
read some highly technical books, for example (unfortunately, they didn’t
know about this handy little guide).
Even more importantly, most homebuyers use mortgages, where balancing
monthly payments with a fixed income is the game. Forty-eight dollars per
month in cost-savings translate into $48 that can be spent somewhere else. A
buyer could get a larger mortgage, for example. For $50 a month, after taxes,
you can borrow $14,000. So although putting in their own solar system may
be an option (after the purchase) for homebuyers, they also have a strong
incentive to purchase existing solar equipment with their mortgage.
In terms of appreciation, the homeowners are likely to get about 125 percent
of the price of new equipment. For the example, a 25-percent appreciation
would be $3,500 (that is, $2,800 times 125 percent). Suppose that with rising
energy costs, the original investment of $1,400 paid for itself in 44 months
(see the preceding section). After that, the cost savings were all pure profit.
At 60 months, the sellers get a further profit of $2,100 at the sale of the house.
93
Chapter 6: Calculating Payback on Your Solar Investment

Financing solar investments 
with a home equity loan
It’s common to save more on energy costs than the payments on a mortgage
equity loan used to purchase a solar system. You pay no upfront cost when
you finance an investment. You do have to pay off the loan at some point, but
from day one, you save more than you pay. Your cash flow is in the black.
Suppose you borrow $1,400 for a solar water heater with a promise of $27 per
month in savings. An interest-only home equity line of credit at 6-percent tax-
deductible interest for the $1,400 is only $8 per month (from mortgage payment
tables). That’s a net gain of $19 per month.
Here’s the payback period for this scenario:
$1,400 ÷ $19/month = 74 months
At some point the loan is repaid (principal payments usually kick in after five
to ten years), although most equity loans get paid off when the house is sold
or refinanced. When it’s sold, you often get more for your solar equipment
than what you paid (see the preceding section for details).
Replacing broken water heaters
When your water heater crashes, doing nothing is not an option. Now you must
spend money, probably a good chunk. How much more do you have to spend
for a solar system? Probably not much. Now’s really the time to go for it.
For example, a solar water heating system costs $3,000, and a conventional
water heater costs $1,400. The difference is only $1,600, whereas if you take
out a working water heater in order to upgrade to solar, the real investment is
the entire $3,000. (And if you factor in rebates and subsidies, the difference
may be zero.)
Diving in to swimming pool solar heaters
A solar pool heater does not save money — except when you compare it to all
the other options. Solar collectors load the filter pump (make it run harder) so
it costs more to run. Sometimes a lot more. If you want a lot of heat, you have
to run the filter pump for upwards of 8 hours a day. This extra pump time is
solar-system cost, and if you’re in a tiered rate structure, it can add up to
quite a bit. If you’re in a TOU structure, you also get dinged because you need
to run your pump at peak times (midafternoon, when it’s sunniest).

Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

When you invest in a solar pool heater, you pay thousands to get higher
power bills. It’s not worth trying to do a payback analysis on a deal like that.
The only gain is comfort, and that’s hard to value. But people pay a lot for
solar pool heaters. In some areas, they’re on every roof. Ask an owner, and he
or she will probably tell you they’re great. Pools cost upwards of $25,000.
Another $3,000 to make it much more enjoyable isn’t a bad investment. Your
swimming season will be extended — a solar heater may triple the amount of
time swimmers actually spend in the pool, as opposed to around it.
The other options are insane: a big, gas heater that gobbles propane, or electric,
with a 24/7 spinning power meter. (You could light a big fire and boil water, but
that’s labor intensive.) A solar pool heater not only heats your pool much
cheaper than the other options, but the pollution effects are infinitely better.
Blowing hot air
The investment: an attic vent fan powered by PV panels. Equipment costs
$350, and installation takes two hours and requires brains, ladders, roof
climbing, and decent tools.
An energy audit determines that the fan will save $25 per month in air-
conditioning costs over a four-month summer period (see Chapter 2 for
details on energy audits). At $100 per year, the payback is only 3.5 years.
You also boost your comfort. The house is a lot more comfortable on the
days when it isn’t hot enough to turn the AC on. And because the fan lets hot
air escape, you get more of these days.
The alternatives to installing a solar fan? Not installing anything at all and
paying for all that extra air conditioning or installing a hard-wired fan for
more than $1,500 because you need a licensed electrician to do the installa-
tion, as well as county inspections and permits.
Working with solar in your home office
You can go off the power grid with a home office. A remote cabin solar power
kit costs $1,000, with 12 volts DC (direct current) output and a battery so
power is always available. You can use the system to run DC lights, a vent
fan, coffee maker, radio, and a PC laptop computer with printer. A small
inverter provides minimal 120 volts AC (alternating current) power for tele-
phones and other support gear.
The total investment, including wiring and DC equipment (lights, fans, and an
AC voltage adaptor), is $1,500. Installation is extra, but with the kits available,
95
Chapter 6: Calculating Payback on Your Solar Investment

a do-it-yourselfer can tackle the job. And because the solar equipment is used
for a business, it’s depreciated, which reduces taxes.
The system saves around $30 per month in utility-provided electricity, so the
payback is 50 months. When all taxes are taken into account, the payback
can be as low as 30 months.
Investing in a full-scale PV system
Suppose some homeowners have good roof exposure for solar equipment
and they want to install a full-scale, intertie (connected to the grid so that
extra generated power is credited to your power bill) PV system in a three-
bedroom, two-bath house. Their monthly average electric bill is $260, and
energy consumption is 1,600 kWh’s per month. The home is all electric.
After an audit, they employ conservation measures to decrease the bill 15
percent to 1,360 kWh’s per month, or $221 (Chapter 2 discusses energy
audits; Chapter 3 can tell you more about reducing energy use). The goal is to
reduce the average monthly electric bill to zero.
A TOU rate structure will apply when the system is in place. The owners
believe they can use 90 percent of their electricity in off-peak hours, so they’ll
be selling most of their solar production back at the top rate and using it at a
much lower rate. In California, utilities are required by law to pay you for
your excess generated power the same rate they charge you. In some states,
the utilities pay you only a percentage of the rate they charge. Look for this
to change in the future, because it’s a way to encourage solar investment.
A 5 kWh system that’ll do the job costs $40,000. The state will give a rebate of
$10,000 directly to the PV system contractor so it’s not even billed to the
homeowners. The total out-of-pocket cost is $30,000. On top of that, the feds
will give a $2,000 tax credit for the system, which now costs only $28,000.
The warranty is 20 years on the panels, less for some of the other equipment.
Reliability is good on the brand chosen, which isn’t the cheapest. In theory,
maintenance and repair costs should be very low.
The owners finance this with an equity loan at $140 per month, tax
deductible. They’re immediately saving the difference between the power bill
they’ve erased ($221) and the cost for the loan — in this case, $141 per
month after taxes. From day one, this deal is in the black.
Using 7 percent as the energy inflation rate, the payback is 11 years, but this
doesn’t account for the fact that the value of the equipment is also rising
because demand is rising. With this factor included in the equation, the pay-
back goes down to 7 years.
96
Part II: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

The potential savings in carbon footprint are 13,000 pounds per year. Not bad!
What will happen to the value of your equipment if rebates and subsidies dry
up? Homebuyers will have to pay a lot more if they choose to install their
own equipment. The seller providing that equipment with the house has
become much more attractive.
Installing both a water heater and PV
Household Y uses 12 kWhs of electricity per month. A solar water heater sup-
plement costs $4,000 and will save 18 percent of the power consumption. A
full-scale PV system will offset the entire electric bill for a cost of $30,000. If
both systems are installed, the capacity of the PV system can be 18 percent
less, for 18 percent less cost.
Here’s what installing both a water heater and a PV system will cost:
$4,000 + 82% of $30,000 = $28,600
Going with the PV option only costs $30,000. That’s a savings of $1,400.
But is it worth it? Maybe not. Water heaters need maintenance. Some are very
reliable and work for decades, but PV systems are relatively trouble-free. You
also have two investment projects to contend with instead of one. With these
numbers, I recommend installing only the PV system. Your calculations may
indicate a bigger divergence, in which case your decision may be different.
This decision may also depend on financing. For example, you may be able to
finance a big PV system, but not both, so your decision may be to install only
PV for this reason.
When does it make good sense to install a solar water heater? A $3,000 invest-
ment is reachable in cash for most homeowners. You get a good payback,
especially if you’re in a tiered rate structure. You can always add PV later,
after you’ve determined how much cost savings you’ve achieved with the
water heater, or when your finances allow for a larger investment.
Or perhaps you can get a solar tax credit of 30 percent of the cost of your
system, at a maximum of $2,000. This means you get a $2,000 tax credit for a
$6,000 solar water heater, as well as a $30,000 PV system. The percentages
are a lot better for the water heater, making its payback much better.
If tax credits or rebates are limited in any given calendar year, you’re better
off installing hot water and PV in different years.

The Best Projects for Do-It-Yourselfers
For those who like to work with tools, the following projects provide the best
opportunity to hammer, screw, cut, and curse.
Solar cooking is a lot of fun, and nearly anybody can do a good job of building
an oven (see Chapter 9). It’s rewarding, and the food tastes good. Ovens are
cheap enough that you can make mistakes and rebuild without being out
much hard-earned cash. They’re simple enough so that most do-it-yourselfers
can develop their own designs after they learn the ropes. Designing your own
equipment is especially fun when the final product is getting better and
better with each effort. You can build a solar oven for less than $40 and with
very few tools.
The ways you can create a solar fountain are diverse; plus you get to work
with all kinds of interesting physics. In this project, you can make something
truly beautiful out of next to nothing. You can even use the technology to pro-
vide a domestic water supply for a remote cabin. (See Chapter 8 for details.)
Another good option is an attic fan; it makes so much sense for hot climates,
and it has good payback if you do it right. (Flip to Chapter 9.)
Solar water heaters are ideal financial investments, especially if you’re in a
tiered rate structure (see Chapter 6), and many can be installed by the do-it-
yourselfer. You can typically save 40 percent of the cost of a system when
you do your own installation. You can install a complete system for under
$1,500 in equipment. Right now, the feds give you a 30-percent tax break, so
you can get in for about a grand. (See Chapters 10 and 12.)
101
Chapter 7: Installing Your Solar System
Reaping the rewards of photosynthesis
Start a vegetable garden and use solar energy
to feed your family. You want a good start? Put
a tomato plant into a big wooden barrel and give
it decent food and water. You even can get a
small automatic valve so you don’t have to do
the watering. Tomatoes are relatively forgiving,
and they provide even if you’re lax. But if you’re
diligent, you can get tons of fat tomatoes.
Thousands of different varieties are available.
Get a rugged, proven performer; forget fancy
unless you’re a good gardener. (If you’re really
interested in growing things, check out Gardening
Basics For Dummies, by Steve Frowine and the
National Gardening Association.)
Full-scale gardens are dubious in terms of pay-
back. They’re expensive and a lot of work. But
there’s nothing like the feeling you get when the
entire, incredibly delicious dinner came from
the garden — even the rabbit stew.

Considering the Best Overall Investments
You want the most return for your investment. Or maybe you’re looking for
the quickest payback for the least amount of effort and cost. These projects
are the winners in this category.
 Conservation: Perform an energy audit and perform all the energy con-
servation measures that your audit suggests. Energy conservation saves
money, reduces pollution, and helps make going solar much more practical.
See Chapter 3.
 Interior blinds and window coverings: These items yield the best pay-
back because they have so much influence on your environment. The
payback’s not monetary, but who says it has to be? (See Chapter 9.)
 Solar screens: Solar screens (Chapter 9) are the easiest, biggest payback
for the smallest investment. For a few dollars a year, you can keep a lot
of heat out of your house, save on energy costs, and make a room more
comfortable on sunny days. Of course, the overall value depends on the
installation; yours may be overly difficult or impossible due to window
configurations or accessibility. While large, southern-exposed picture
windows are the best candidates because they have the greatest affect
on solar radiation, they’re sometimes difficult to completely cover with-
out creating some ugliness in the process.
 Landscaping: Plant a tree or two. A few years later, you’ll understand
what a real payback is. Not only will you reap the benefit of a beautiful
yard, but the cooling effect can also be dramatic. I have a personal bias
here, I should admit; I favor beauty over financial return, and I encourage
you to as well. After all, beauty is lasting, and it shares with everybody
equally. Flip to Chapter 8.
 Solar battery chargers: They’re easy to use and inexpensive, and when
you charge your own batteries instead of purchasing disposables, you
definitely save a lot of money. See Chapter 9.
 Solar attic fans: Solar attic fans (Chapter 9) are great for the experi-
enced do-it-yourselfer, especially if you live in a hot climate.
 Intertie systems: Intertie system economics depends a great deal on
subsidies and rebates and tax breaks, but when they’re advantageous,
you get a lot of value out of a single, overriding investment. You get guar-
anteed power rates (free) forever, and this locked-in rate may be very,
very important. But you also save a lot of carbon dioxide pollution,
which should be a factor in your decision (see Chapter 17).
 Hot water heaters: They can get a big return in tiered rate structures,
and they can get really big returns when you do your own installation.
Chapters 10 and 12 can fill you in.
102
Part IV: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

 Solar light tubes (tubular skylights): Solar light tubes (Chapter 9) are a
good do-it-yourself project with a potentially big return. When you put
some thought into where one should go, the effect can be very dramatic
for the cost. Try to find somebody who already has one who can show
you how it works, because they have a definite character.
Getting the Most Out of Your Equipment
Here’s my best advice in the entire book: I call it the measure-twice-cut-once
rule. When working a project, do one part at a time, and then put it aside for
one week. You can do this sort of thing with any project, and I guarantee it’ll
come out better. The more of a novice you are with the particular skills of a
project, the more this rule applies.
For example, suppose that you want to put a PV system up on your roof.
Phase 1: Decide on all the options, collect all the financial numbers, then put
it aside and forget about it. A week later, rethink the whole thing. Then calcu-
late all the paybacks and scenarios. Make a plan. Forget it again for another
week. Then start making calls to contractors. Talk to owners about costs and
performances. Get a feel for the supply market — who’s good, who’s not. Wait
a week. Make a decision; contractor, money, where it’s coming from, and the
like. Wait another week. Cast the decision in concrete and start moving.
Here are some other tips:
 Buy kits when you can. Even when a contractor does an installation,
ask for complete kits whenever possible. System performance is better,
and you can rely on the instructions and support. And you don’t run into
any arguments about whose parts aren’t working right when a cobbled-
together system is performing poorly. Contractors generally favor cer-
tain manufacturers and types of systems, so you may want to use this
tip in selecting a contractor. If two contractors are tied, all things being
equal, favor the one who plans on using a kit.
 Get a price for installation, even if you want to do it yourself.
Sometimes the price difference between buying a kit and installing it
yourself isn’t much different from having the entire thing professionally
designed and installed. Professionals can get parts more cheaply than
you can, and they can install quickly and efficiently. (On the other hand,
what’s the point of calling yourself a do-it-yourselfer if you don’t?)
 Get more than one bid, preferably three. Solar is growing by leaps and
bounds. Things are changing fast, and options are expanding. When you
get three bids, they’ll probably be different — maybe a lot. Understand
why. Growing, inventive markets are always buyer-beware.
103
Chapter 7: Installing Your Solar System

 Don’t automatically go for the lowest bid — it may be the highest bid in
disguise. A lot of new characters are getting into solar energy these days.
Many are great. The industry is attracting new blood. On the other hand,
some newcomers are setting up shop only because so much work is avail-
able. Good contractors always have references who’ll generally be happy
to put in an encouraging word. If your contractor is vague about references,
proceed with caution. Newcomers with slim references may be the best
option, but there’s more risk, so you should expect their price to reflect it.
 Get references. Try to find somebody who already has the system
you’re thinking about purchasing. What are his recommendations?
Playing It Safe
Honestly assess your skill set in terms of handling dangerous situations. If
you’re not a great do-it-yourselfer but you like trying and know you’ll get
better, you can do a lot of things where nobody can get hurt. Overall, when it
comes to safety, don’t mess around. This section outlines some situations to
avoid, things you shouldn’t do unless you really know what you’re doing, and
areas where you should be particularly cautious.
Intertie PV-generating systems
Only people who really, truly know what they’re doing in all aspects of the
job should install a grid intertie system. In such a system, your homegrown
power generator is connected into the public utility grid so you can sell back
excess power. You can’t interface with the utility company unless you’re
highly qualified — and licensed. The utility company also has a lot more
lawyers than you do, and it will sue you in a heartbeat if you do anything
slightly out of its realm of comfort.
Don’t wire up or work on a PV intertie system if you’re not qualified: The
voltages are high enough to kill.
Plumbing and electrical work
Avoid plumbing or electrical work if you don’t understand the code require-
ments or safety hazards. For example, any power system that puts out 120
volts AC is potentially dangerous. If you don’t understand high voltages and
how you can get a shock, don’t mess around with this stuff. At all.
104
Part IV: Understanding Solar — Just the Facts, Ma'am 

Bad installations can create dangers that don’t have to be. Books can take
you only so far into the project world. Experience counts. This doesn’t neces-
sarily mean you shouldn’t try something you’ve never done. You can get
good explanations for how to do things from a clerk in a hardware store, and
you can do many jobs on that basis. Just understand that patience and con-
sideration are at premium when you’re forging new territory.
If you perform work that falls under county code, you may have problems
selling your house someday if an inspector determines that you haven’t met
the standards. If you do an installation incorrectly, you may have problems
with your homeowners’ insurance. Code exists for a good reason: It’s not just
so the government can give you a hard time — it’s to keep things safe and
consistent. You wouldn’t want to buy a house with sub-code work, and you
don’t have to. A seller must bring it up to code. If you sell your house with
the promise of solar energy, you’ll be expected to turn over equipment that’s
up to code and does what it’s supposed to.
You can plumb all you want on a system that’s not connected to your domestic
supply, such as an outdoor fountain or a swimming pool. But when you install a
solar water heater, you may want to have a plumber install the pipes at the very
least (see the upcoming “Water heaters” section). You can buy all the equipment,
mount it into place, and then get a plumber to connect the pipes.
Also, many of the governmental/tax incentives require a system to be
installed by professionals with certain minimum certification credentials.
Solar panels
Climbing around on roofs is statistically the most dangerous part of any
installation. Injuries can be severe, maybe even fatal. Do you belong up on a
roof? Not just climbing around, but pulling heavy weights and tools and going
back and forth a lot? If you have a flimsy ladder, you’re asking for big trouble.
After all, solar panels are heavy and awkward. (Imagine hoisting a heavy
piece of plywood around in the wind while you’re balancing on a roof, and
you get the idea.)
Solar water heating panels can be particularly heavy when full of water. If you
don’t know your roof can take the weight, either find out from an engineer, which
costs you money, or forget about it. Imagine what a stinking mess a caved-in roof
would be, especially with hot water dripping all over! You probably wouldn’t be a
lifelong solar fan.
Also pay attention to local ordinances. Sometimes building codes forbid solar
panels in view from the street, although more and more state legislatures are
banning this limitation.
105
Chapter 7: Installing Your Solar System

Water heaters
Don’t install a solar water heater if you don’t understand its engineering, par-
ticularly its dangers and maintenance requirements.
Water heaters can be problematic in hot weather. When a solar panel sits in
the direct sun long enough, the water can sometimes get to over the boiling
point. Solar panels have been known to rupture from steam pressure, which
can burn (not to mention cost a lot to fix). Or the pipes can fill with super-
heated water and burst inside your house.
Always keep children away from solar water heating systems and the associ-
ated pipes. Also, add some safety measures to your valves. Most solar water
heaters have valves for controlling flows and evacuating equipment for vari-
ous reasons, such as performing maintenance or keeping water from freezing
in the pipes in cold weather. Children love to play with valves, so buy valves
with padlock loops to prevent children from reaching up and twisting a valve
with superheated water.
Batteries
Batteries are safe, effective, and reliable when used properly, but they can
also cause worse injuries than electrical shocks. If the terminals of a big bat-
tery get shorted, a tremendous arc of current flashes, precisely the same as
an arc welder. You don’t want to be around when it happens.
Unsealed batteries can emit noxious fumes. They can corrode, so take special
precautions when you dispose of them. In order to wire up a safe and effi-
cient battery circuit, you need to know exactly what you’re doing.
Buy a system with batteries in complete form — all these battery dangers
should be adequately addressed.

T
he great outdoors is a good place to begin with solar projects, so in this
chapter, I introduce some ventures that get you out of the house. Operating
a fountain with solar power, for example, means you can tune in to Mother
Nature even more than with the usual solar project. You can make fountains
small enough to sit on a table or large enough to fill an entire yard. They sound
soothing, and just about everybody likes waterfalls.
Or you can go low-tech, planting particular types of trees and shrubs in certain
locations around your house to achieve dramatic improvements in temperature
in both summer and winter. And with trees and bushes, you also get natural
beauty.
Solar lights are easy and convenient functional decorations that anybody can
install. You can make your yard come to life at night for less than $20. And for
$200, you can light up the place like your own theme park.
Finally, controlling the amount of direct sunshine that falls on a patio or a
porch enables you to spend a lot more time there. You can make it warmer in
the winter and cooler in the summer. Think shade!
Building a Solar Fountain
Solar fountains are a simple, straightforward do-it-yourself project that work
for any skill level. (The electrical work is bare bones minimum, with zero
danger of shock or calamity.) Pumps and PV modules work well together. You

110
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 
can literally connect the two wires from a PV module with the two wires of a
DC pump motor, and you’re in business. The pump works when you have
sunshine, and the more, the merrier.
A basic fountain system has a minimum of several parts:
 A fountain (the structure, including the water path)
 A lower reservoir of water
 A pump
 Some tubing
 Wiring
 A power source
Some systems use an upper reservoir to store water, which evens out the
erratic flow of the fountain on a partly cloudy day. In periods of bright sun-
shine, the upper reservoir fills up; when it’s shady, it slowly drains down.
You can build a solar fountain any size you want, indoors or out, and you can
create a soothing ambience with peaceful, gurgling water. Spend as little as
$40 or as much as $10,000. All sizes are available for the do-it-yourselfer. The
bigger jobs are just bigger, not more complex.
Making a basic barrel solar fountain
An easy do-it-yourself fountain, shown in Figure 8-1, is made of two separate
halves of oak barrels.
Here’s how the fountain works: In sunlight, the upper reservoir fills slowly.
When the sun goes behind a cloud, the fountain maintains flow by draining
the upper reservoir. When the upper reservoir gets too full, water drains
through the overflow spout. You can close the lower valve and save water in
the upper reservoir for use later, such as when you go to bed or when you’re
having a dinner party with friends.
Water trickling sounds come from three sources: the valve, the overflow spout,
and the pump tube. It’s interesting to note the different sequences of sounds
you get from various weather conditions and time of day.
A solar well pump system works on the same principles. During sunlight
hours, well water is pumped into a reservoir located above a house. On
sunny days, the reservoir fills up, but it has enough capacity to work even
through a few cloudy days. Water runs into the house by simple gravity feed,
with well-regulated pressure — at least until the reservoir drains.

Parts list
You generally want to build the reservoir parts of the fountain before select-
ing a pump, so buy the materials in two stages. Here’s what you need to build

 Two halves of an oak barrel: These cost $20 and up per half at big nurs-
eries. Nice barrels from wineries cost more, but they’re very good quality
and usually look better for a lot longer. They’re not easy to cut in half, so
buy them precut.
 Clear silicon sealant: Seal cracks and leaks with clear silicon sealant,
sold at all hardware stores.
 A completely reliable support structure: Use heavy, rigid concrete
blocks or bricks to support the upper reservoir, with the bottom around
an inch higher than the top of the lower — it can get very heavy. Keep
the upper reservoir as level as possible. The lower barrel can sit on the
floor, with the back edge supporting the upper reservoir.
The upper reservoir can weigh upwards of 200 pounds if you’re using big
barrels. If you don’t get it set with integrity, it can come crashing down.
Always use concrete or mortar or glue whenever possible. If you need to,
make the structure rigid enough so a kid can climb onto it without mishap.
 A valve (faucet): For $8 you can get a good brass faucet. Even better, gift
shops often sell fancy faucets made of copper (green patina). Faucets
made for outdoor hose systems come with male-threaded mounting ports,
so you can screw the faucet into the barrel after you drill a hole.
 One copper tube, around 4" long, between 1⁄2" and 3⁄4": Copper tubes are
stock items in plumbing departments.
Or you can use a decorative valve that matches the other one as your
overflow spout. Just open it up all the way and leave it like that.
After you build the basic fountain (see the next section) and before you buy the
next set of materials, determine how much flow you need. Bring a hose over to
the finished fountain, along with a 1-gallon container, and do the following:
1. Place the hose in the 1-gallon container and adjust the water flow so
that the hose fills the container in 1 minute.
2. Set the hose in the upper reservoir of your fountain and find out what
kind of flow 1 gallon per minute results in.
If this is fine, buy a 1-gpm pump.
3. If you’re not satisfied with the result in 2, readjust the flow either up
or down and measure the container fill time once again.
Use the formula: 1/fill time in minutes to get the flow rate.
4. Reapply to the fountain and determine whether the new flow is correct.
The smaller the cheaper, but pumps can also wear out over time, so
don’t cut it too close. Many pumps have a flow adjustment valve; they’re
worth the extra money.
112
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

You’re then ready to buy some of the more mechanical parts of the fountain:
 A 12VDC submersible pump, at least 1⁄2 gpm (gallons per minute) flow
with 2 feet of head pressure: Head pressure is a pump spec, usually in
feet, which tells you how much vertical height the pump will be able to
force water. You may want bigger and faster, which makes more noise and
moves more water. Most retail outlets for pumps assist their customers
in choosing the best pump for the particular application. Use this free
resource, if possible. Otherwise, the best bet is to look on the Internet.
 Four feet of tubing that connects with the pump: Clear plastic is the
best choice because it’s less visible. Buy matching tubing when you buy
the pump.
 A 5-watt or larger PV module with 12VDC output: How much power?
Ask the pump experts, and they’ll tell you how much flow you’ll get for
how much power. Keep in mind this flow is going to happen only under
the best conditions.
For $50 you can buy a complete kit with PV module, pump, wiring, and
tubing. You don’t get much flow, but it works just fine if you like subtlety.
 A mounting scheme for the PV module: You can lay a PV module
directly on the ground or rocks or gravel, and it’s not harmful. But in
general, it does better the higher you can get it. Rooftop is best if you
want a steady flow because you get sunshine all day without contending
with shadows. If you want variation, plan to mount it in a place where
shadows change over the course of the day.
 Wire from the PV module to the pump: Tell the hardware store clerk
how big your solar module is in watts at 12VDC, and he should be able
to give you the wire you need. Direct burial cable used for household
120VAC systems is a good option because you can simply dig a trench,
lay it in, and then cover it back up with the dirt.
Your hardware store has a variety of wire splicing kits; when you’re ready
to do the wiring, make a diagram of where the pump and switch and PV
module are; measure the distances in feet. Get both the wire you need and
the proper splicing kit at the same time because they’re one and the same.
 An SPST (single pose, single throw) switch, electrical box, and faceplate:
The cheapest switch is an off/on light switch for a house. You can buy
one for $1, and it’s easy to wire. Buy a matching electrical box and face-
plate; many styles are available. The most convenient boxes come with
nails ready embedded into the plastic housing; hold it up to a post and
pound the nails in, and you’re hard mounted with integrity.
Assembly and operation
Before you begin, get your first set of parts ready (see the preceding section for
a list of what you need to build the fountain structure). Then follow these steps:
113
Chapter 8: Digging In to Landscape Projects

1. Prepare the oak barrels and install the valve and overflow spout.
Seal any cracks and leaks in the barrels with clear silicon sealant. In one
of the halves (the upper reservoir), drill a hole near the bottom for your
valve (faucet) and install it. If your faucet has a male-threaded mounting
port, you can twist it right in by hand (use clear silicon sealant very lib-
erally and wipe away the excess after you have the valve in).
In the same half, drill a hole for the overflow spout about an inch from
the top, not directly over the valve but a couple of inches away. Angle
the hole with a slightly downward tilt so when water drains through the
spout, it’ll pour outward.
2. Finish the reservoir parts of the fountain.
Put the top and bottom reservoirs into place, setting the upper reservoir
on its support structure with mortar, concrete, or glue.
3. Determine how much flow you need and purchase the appropriate
pump, tubing, and wiring (see the preceding “Parts list” section).
4. Install the solar pump system and put the tubing in place.
The pump goes at the bottom of the lower reservoir, as low as possible. The
PV module goes into sunshine, and the tubing connects the pump to
the upper reservoir.
5. Complete the wiring, connecting the PV module to the switch and the
switch to the pump.
Use your wire splicing kit. Make all wiring runs as short and direct as
possible, and make excellent connections everywhere.
A shoddy connection is like a weak link in a chain; it defines the overall
quality. Bad connections don’t last long outdoors, in the elements. If you
don’t do a connection right, you’ll be redoing it soon and suffering
performance anxiety in the meantime.
Here’s how to operate: With the switch off and the valve closed all the way,
fill the upper reservoir one-quarter of the way. Fill the lower reservoir an inch
from the top, and then flip the switch on. Adjust the valve so that the upper
reservoir fills slowly on a sunny day.
Some tips:
 Oak barrels are made of individual wood staves, which are tightly
pinched together by steel straps. If you let an oak barrel dry out, the
gaps between the staves tend to warp and expand. Always keep the bar-
rels as full as possible to avoid this issue. If it does become a problem,
you can recover the original integrity by filling the barrels (which are
going to leak) repeatedly until the leaks stop.
114
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 When you buy your pond materials, get some anti-algae tablets. You can
also use swimming pool chlorine, if it’s handy.
You can have fun and discover a lot about solar by experimenting with all the
different variables. A lot of subtle physics is at work — gravity, pumps, sunlight,
weather, evaporation, balance, fluid flow, energy storage, power, and so on.
For example, you can face the solar panel east or west to change the time of
day you want to run your fountain the strongest. If you like to wake up to a
fountain, face the module due east. If you like to come home in the afternoon
to a peaceful waterfall, face the PV module into the southwest. You can even
use two PV modules connected in parallel to cover both early morning and
late afternoon (when you buy the PV modules, make sure to tell the sales
staff so they can get you the right kind to do this with). On the other hand, if
you want your fountain to change a lot over the course of a day, put the solar
module in a partly shaded backyard where shadows are constantly evolving.
Designing your own master creation
All solar fountains have essentially the same types of operation and parts as
the wooden barrel fountain. Designing and building your own version isn’t
hard. You can find a whole range of prefabricated fountains in gift shops and
nurseries — check them for design ideas. If you have rocks, all you need is
some mortar, and you can make one of the best fountain structures imaginable!
Given a choice, I recommend the extra work of rock and mortar because you
avoid leaks (with the oak barrels), and rock fountains tend to resist algae
buildup better. Of course, a rock and mortar fountain is probably going to be
fixed forever where you build it, whereas you can move an oak barrel fountain.
Your biggest decision is how large to make the upper reservoir. The larger the
reservoir, the longer the capacity (in time) to continue flowing without sun-
light on the solar panels. Then again, you don’t need one at all — if you go
without, your fountain goes exactly with the sunlight, and you can hear how
much sunshine there is at any given time.
Deciding how much power you need impacts cost the most. For more power,
you need both a bigger pump and a bigger PV module. Tall fountains require
more expensive pumps and PV modules to move the same amount of water.
Try to go for subtle. If you want to make up for lack of flow, make a lot of little
fountains instead of one big one. Make your fountain shallow and broad if you
want big.
115
Chapter 8: Digging In to Landscape Projects

Many landscape fountains use a black rubber liner that fits snugly over
almost any contour. It’s easy to install, seals very well, and lasts a long time.
Unleash your imagination. Broad, shallow reservoirs work better than
narrow, deep ones because the water levels don’t vary nearly as much.
You have to keep your solar fountain topped off with water because you can’t
let the pump run dry. The easiest way is to connect a drip valve from a land-
scape watering system into the lower reservoir (just barely suspend the dripper
over the edge of the lower reservoir — don’t let it hang down into the water, or
it may siphon out your water). Make sure to leave a drainage path for when the
lower reservoir overflows (you don’t want to use this method if your fountain 
is indoors or sitting on a finished floor such as tile). If you’re not getting enough
water to keep the lower reservoir filled, use more dripper heads. Overflow
doesn’t hurt the system, but you don’t want the pump to run dry, which 
happens when you don’t have enough water. Err on the side of full.
The best fountains blend in with the natural scenery. Use natural rock and sur-
round the fountain with plants. If you’re interested in creating a natural ecosys-
tem and using a solar pump to enliven it with some moving water, use broad,
shallow reservoirs, and locate the valve only an inch or so below the level of
the overflow spout. The depths of the ponds will vary only by that amount.
You can build a good-sized solar fountain for $300 if you use natural materials
and your own elbow grease. Just $500 can get you a beautiful koi pond fed by
a naturally flowing spring — a solar spring, that is!
If you want to do an installation but not a design, buy a complete fountain or
pond kit, which comes with detailed instructions and expert suggestions.
Each kit comes with specific design suggestions, including a parts list and
labor instructions. Or you can buy a prefabricated fountain without a pump
and then install your own solar components. Look in the Yellow Pages under
fountains and ponds.
Lighting Your Yard with Solar
One of the easiest and cheapest ways to start out in solar is by installing
lighting in your landscape. For $15, you can get a decent solar light with a
range of mounting schemes. The simplest units come with a built-in stake so
you literally don’t do anything more than stick it into the ground. If it turns
out that you don’t like that spot, pull it out and stick it somewhere else.
The vast majority of solar landscaping lights come one-piece, with the PV
module on top of the light itself, so you should put the whole thing where it
116
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

can get a reasonable amount of direct sunlight. However, solar lights may sur-
prise you by how well they work, given a meager amount of light. If the lights
don’t get much sun, they still come on at dusk — they just don’t last all the
way to dawn. Your best bet is to try one out in the location you want, even if
no direct sunlight is there. It may work just fine.
Some lights are static, meaning they don’t blink or change colors. Background
lighting, for example, should be static; it should establish a sense of place
and highlight the best features of the environment. The most functional loca-
tions for the spotlight variety are around porches and walkways and along
driveways where people will be walking. Put one near your garbage can out
back, and you don’t have to flip the light switch anymore. You can also get
solar lights connected to motion detectors (see Chapter 9).
Other lights revolve through patterns of color and brightness. The effect is
entirely different. Dynamic lights should add a subtle hint of presence. One of
my favorite solar lights is a clear plastic butterfly that changes colors slowly
and subtly. It comes on a stake with a 2-foot wand to the butterfly, which
seems to be floating because you can’t see the wand at night. It draws your
eye without demanding it, and the colors are rich and textured.
Don’t buy cheap lights, because they don’t last. If it’s in a flimsy plastic housing,
don’t buy it. Aluminum is good; heavy black plastic is cheaper and works just
as well. You may want to buy an entire matching set; 6 units for $60 is usually
good quality.
Planting Trees and Shrubs for 
Shade and Wind Control
Plants add natural beauty and keep the air supply clean by trapping dust,
consuming carbon, and making oxygen. But adding some leafy vegetation can
give you some other perks as well.
With growth fueled by the sun, plant cells are Mother Nature’s original solar
cells — and you can harness the power of landscaping to provide shade and
keep you cool. By planting deciduous trees and shrubs, you can work the sun
to your advantage in both summer and winter. The leaves provide shade in
the summer, and the bare branches let sunlight in during cold winter months.
And by planting trees around your house, you can also increase or decrease
the breezes through the house. This section tells you how.
117
Chapter 8: Digging In to Landscape Projects

Planting for your day in the shade
A wall or roof that’s shaded from a tree or shrub can be 20°F cooler than the
same thing in full sun. On a hot summer day, the air temperature under a tree
can be 25°F cooler than on nearby blacktop.
Thermal mass is the amount of heat energy a substance can hold. Bricks, con-
crete, stones, and the like hold a lot of heat. Wooden decks are pretty good at
it as well. So if the sun shines on a concrete patio, that patio is going to be
hot most of the night. But landscape bark, mulch, and plants don’t hold much
heat at all. If sun shines on landscape bark all day, there won’t be much
stored energy at the end of the day, and the temperature goes down reason-
ably fast. So a bit of strategic planting can help you create some cool spots.
Big windows to the south of your house are the best location for shade plant-
ing. Sliding glass doors or big, wide doors of any kind are best of all. Also
plant for summer shade over high-thermal-mass patios, porches, sidewalks,
wooden and synthetic decks, and so on. The closer to the house, the better.
Choosing deciduous plants — which shed their leaves in the fall — ensures
summer shade and winter warming.
Directing the wind
Figure 8-2 shows you how to plant trees to either decrease or increase the
breezes through your house.
Your prevailing wind is the direction the wind blows most of the time. (Go out-
side, observe the direction of the wind, and then keep a log over a period of
time — say, ten measurements a month over the course of a year.) To decide
where to plant, draw an overhead view of your house and then include an
arrow for prevailing wind. Mark the location of each window, and then plan
accordingly. The prevailing wind may change over the course of the seasons,
so you’ll have to decide which season is the most important in your operating
scheme. In general, a good design includes plants for both winter and summer.
Here are some tips on plant selection and care when planting windbreaks:
 If you want the most tree the fastest, don’t get the biggest tree — get
the one with the biggest root ball. Make sure that the nursery didn’t
just plant a small root ball into a big container. The bigger the root ball
(if it’s healthy), the bigger your tree will be in a few years.
 Regardless of where you live, use natural and indigenous plants. They
grow better and are proven to last. Talk to the staff at a local nursery
about your project and show them your drawing. They should know the
118
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

perfect plants for each spot, and they can tell you how to get the fastest
growth with fertilizers and water scheduling. In general, you want ever-
greens for winter windbreaks, but your options for summer are wide open.
 Keep your plants on a water schedule. For about $20, you can get a bat-
tery-powered digitally programmed valve that works great anywhere
you have a hose. You can automatically water a number of trees for $40,
including the drippers and tubes. Trees and shrubs grow like mad if you
feed and water them properly, but they don’t grow much at all if you
don’t. Making water automatic is a wise investment.

Convection cooling (see Chapter 4) from the wind is a big heat loss in swim-
ming pools. By placing a perimeter of shrubs on the windward side of the
pool, you can make your pool look better and swim in warmer water at the
same time.
Antisolar Power: Using Awnings,
Lattices, and Overhangs
Sometimes you don’t want to harness the power of the sun so much as con-
trol it. This section tells you a bit about ways to tap into the power of shade
so you can keep your outdoor areas comfortably cool.
The most beneficial spot to shade your house with outdoor blinds and screens
is a back porch, especially if it’s concrete or stone. Wooden decks are also good
candidates because they hold a lot of heat. The net effect of making a patio or a
porch more comfortable is that you can spend more and better time there. You
basically increase the square footage of your house with this investment!
You can also build a nice looking lattice structure overhead that acts as a sun
break. Cover the lattice with a sunscreen to keep heat and bugs out at the
same time. Or even better, use deciduous vines. Be careful with them, how-
ever; some (like grapes) are savagely invasive and will take over your entire
yard in a year or two. Of course, this may be your goal. (Grapes also yield
fruit, which is very nice.)
If you screen in a covered porch, you can leave the doors and windows into
the house wide open. Not only can this make you feel like you have an extra
room in the house, but the house will be considerably cooler as well. You can
either build your own roof or buy kits for roofs made of canvas or vinyl or
fiberglass. (See Chapter 16.)
Automatic awnings (motor-powered, either solar, battery, or household cur-
rent) are also available — they work via a handheld remote control (the same
kind used on TVs).
Gazebos are available in complete kits to cover anywhere from 10 square feet
to over a few hundred. In hot climates, a gazebo often makes the difference
between rarely using a patio or lawn space and always using it. High-quality
units come with screens that you can easily open and close. Some units come
with solar ceiling fans. You can spend anywhere from $50 to tens of thou-
sands of dollars on complete units.
120
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Overhangs are often good do-it-yourself projects with both financial gain and
aesthetic beauty. Figure 8-3 shows the basic idea.
You can design an overhang to match your house and roofline. This can make
a huge difference in the appearance of your house and give you function at
the same time.
You’ll have to design your own overhang because each one is so different
that no universal designs or supplies exist. The best bet is to use the same
materials your house and roof are made of. Make every effort to make the
overhang look like it belongs to your house. Before you start nailing things
down, set up the materials in the best approximation of the final design and
see what it looks like.
This is not a simple do-it-yourself project because the design phase is very
important. On the other hand, if your design is simple, most people can build
an overhang with minimal tools and experience.
You can get a carpenter to help you, and it shouldn’t cost too much. You can
get a carpenter to do only the design for you, and you can build the design.
Go to a construction site and just ask one of the framers. You don’t need a
licensed contractor because you don’t need a license.

S
tarting out with small projects makes sense because you find out how
solar works through experience. When you move up to bigger and more
powerful systems, you get to understand the ropes. In payback terminology,
you decrease risk by starting out simply.
In this chapter, I present all kinds of fast and easy solar projects. Some are
sensible; some are just for fun. Who’s to say which is more important?
Going for Gizmos, Gadgets, and More
Whatever you choose for your first solar experiments, make sure that you
have fun with them. You may want to begin with some of these solar toys and
novelties:
 Solar clip fans for hats: Cooler heads will prevail! Hat fans clip on to
your hat visor, and a tiny PV cell spins a fan, which you can aim at your
face. At around $10 apiece, they’re great for baseball games, the beach,
reading, or napping.
The lifetime of the product is speculative at best, but you can have fun
in the meantime. Buy a batch and give one to each kid you know, or give
them out at promotions — everybody will remember you.

 Spinning prism: This $20 toy attaches to your window via a rubber 
suction cup. Facing outdoors is a PV panel that feeds a motor that spins
a large crystal. When the sun shines directly, the crystal sends twirling
prismic patterns around the room. At some point, you may get weary 
of it — kids don’t, though.
 Solar dollhouse: PV panels on the roof can power hair drying and other
necessities of modern life — all for zero pollution. Be prepared when the
young owner wants to know why the lights work only when you don’t
really need them.
 Solar car: With PV cells on this car’s roof, the sunnier the faster. That’s 
a curious performance characteristic for a car — not really practical, but
hey.
 Solar pond fountain: The solar pond fountain is a one-piece float for 
your swimming pool or pond. Solar panels power a pump that squirts 
a little fountain straight up — the more sunshine, the noisier. Just take it
out of the box and float it. Some look like lily pads; very cheesy. You can
typically pick one up for $50.
If you want your gadgets a little more practical (at least in theory), you may
want to consider the items I describe in the following sections.
Washing with portable showers
With the solar portable shower, you fill a specially constructed plastic bag
with water and then place it in direct sunlight to heat up. The 5-gallon bag 
is clear on top, facing the sun while it’s warming. The back wall is black to
absorb maximum sunlight. Most portable showers come with a thermometer
so you know when it’s ready.
At that point, hang it from a tree for a gravity-fed, hot shower. It’s convenient
for camping and backpacking. It’s also good on boats when you want to get
cleaned off at the end of the day. You can hang one out by your swimming pool
for a quick, simple rinse. They can also serve as solar hot water bottles — big,
hot, soft, and free.
If you forget about them, portable showers can get really hot, over 120°F, so
beware. Always sample the temperature before you use it.
Shining light on solar flashlights
A solar flashlight always has fresh batteries — as long as you don’t store it 
in a dark drawer or cabinet. Get one of these and store it on the windowsill.
They’re bright enough to be functional, and they last a long time after they’re
charged. Are they worth $25 (compared to conventional flashlights for $10)?
124
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Well, they’re cool, and because you have to set them out in the open, they’re
conversation pieces. And if you’re the type who always runs out of batteries,
this may be the cure.
Doing yard work with solar machinery
You can buy a solar/battery–powered lawnmower — but you can’t store it 
in a dark shed, or it won’t do much work! With a full charge, you can mow for
around an hour, which should cover even the biggest lawn. They weigh about
as much as a regular mower, but do cost more. They work the same way; you
have to sweat and grunt and groan and push them over every square inch, 
so you may just want to pay a neighbor kid to the do the job for you.
You can buy a solar-powered leaf blower, which makes sense for small yards,
where gas is overkill, electric power cords are a hassle, and conventional
rechargeable units have to be located near an AC plug. When not in use, 
you can store a solar-powered leaf blower anywhere you have sunlight.
Creating ambience with swimming 
pool novelty lights
Here’s my favorite toy: a clear plastic disk, around 6 inches in diameter and 
2 inches thick that floats in a pool. During the day, a battery charges via a PV
module. At night, an eight-color LED display cycles through an evolving pattern
that shines down into the water so that the entire pool glows with the color.
These lights can sauce up your pool like nothing else. Static lights create 
ambience, but moving lights create presence.
They’re cheap — and they should be because they don’t last long. But at 
$12 apiece, it’s okay. If you have a pool, you know $12 is nothing in the grand
scheme of things.
Use at least two lights at a time — they have the same patterns but different
speeds. Sometimes they get in sync. Four work best.
I recommend getting some for a party. Make sure that they’re in plenty of sun-
light before the party starts. Tell kids they’re spaceships, and they’ll probably
believe you!
Spreading holiday cheer
Running long, snarled power cords to your strings of Christmas lights is a
thing of the past. Now you can use solar-powered lights that don’t plug in it
125
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

all. A small PV module charges a battery during the day. At night, illumination
comes from low-power LEDs. But they show up loud and clear when they’re
aimed right. If you want to put up only a string or two, the job takes about 
10 minutes. Solar works very well in freezing, clear weather, and the LED
lights look great against snow.
You may not get a lot of Christmas cheer in extended periods of thick
weather. The lights do always go on after dusk for at least some time, but if
they didn’t get much charge, they go off soon. Still, do you really need lights
after midnight?
Coverings and Barriers: Letting (Or Not
Letting) the Sun Shine In
Controlling the amount of sunlight that enters your house or patio is an 
easy way to both regulate temperature and enhance the appearance of your
house.
Choosing locations for window coverings
Window coverings are a great way to control the amount of light that comes
in and to create an insulating or cooling effect in your home. Figure 9-1 shows
your different window covering options, and Table 9-1 explains what happens
with each one.
With a blind inside, you can get the best insulation. However, the heat is
inside because sunshine comes in through the window and strikes the blind.
The gap between the blind and the window can get very hot because of the
greenhouse effect. This result is desirable in the winter but not the summer,
when you may have a cooler room if you just leave the window uncovered
and let the sun and air in.
You can get interior blinds made to warm a room in the winter if that’s your
main goal. They absorb sunlight, and they also provide insulation where you
need it. On the other hand, interior blinds for summer reflect a lot of light on
the outside (exterior) surface, which may be made of a different material or
made a different color, from the inside surface. In general, a white blind works
well for reflecting sunlight the best, but you can also find (more expensive)
specially coated blinds that reflect the maximum amount of sunlight.
With a solar screen tacked up on the outside of a window, most of the sunlight
is gone before it even gets to the window. The screen gets hot, and you end 
up with an insulation barrier to keep that heat trapped, but it’s all outside the
126

window, which makes for a cooler interior. This is good for summertime, but
counterproductive for winter.

blind and the opened window that it’s covering. But that setup isn’t always
easy or practical.
When your air conditioner is on, you want to create as much insulation as
possible. You can do so by closing your blinds all the way. If you have outside
covers, lower them into place. The best scheme for a sunny house that uses a
lot of air conditioning is both solar screens and interior blinds. The house is
very dark inside, but it’s also cooler. (You can also use window overhangs —
see Chapter 8.)
Investing in blinds and drapes
Windows are the showpiece in any room, and window covers make a big 
difference in the decor. With a stock blind from a hardware supplier, you get
mounting hardware and instructions, plus quality that’ll last for more than 
a few seasons.
Indoor blinds and drapes
You can get the most bang for your decorating buck with inside blinds, spend-
ing anywhere from $10 to thousands. Inside blinds and drapes are good for
cold weather. The best insulators are made of honeycombed fabrics. Keep
them open whenever you have sun; close them otherwise, especially on a cold
night. Curtains work the same way, and you have a much broader selection of
fabrics and styles. In the summer, you may not even notice the difference
between open and closed.

Outdoor blinds
You can easily hang an outdoor blind on the frame above a window or a door.
Some outdoor blinds come with sunscreen (see the preceding section).
Outdoor blinds are usually made of vinyl. When you hang one outside your
window, that’s what you’re going to be seeing from the inside. Some are prettier
than others.
If you want to raise and lower the blind often, retraction may be important.
Most blinds are manual, with cords that you pull different ways. Some are
automatic, and you can even find solar-powered retractors that work with 
a hand-held remote control. You don’t even need to go outside.
Import shops stock different sizes of rollup bamboo shades, often as low as $5.
These shades work well outside because they look reasonably good and are
cheap enough so that when the weather eats it up, you can just toss it out. You
need to get some mounting hardware, probably in a different store (unless you
just nail the shades up there, which can be minimum cost for maximum gain).
Installing sunscreens for summer
Installing sunscreens is the cheapest way to prepare a window for the summer
season, and it’s also one of the best. Sunscreens reflect a lot of sunlight and
create an insulation barrier on the outside.
Most sunscreens are dark, heavy-duty fabric screens with a shiny surface.
Some are a flexible, tinted plastic film. They can reflect up to 90 percent of all
sunlight.
Looking at placement, payback, and installation advice
Only windows that get more than a few hours of direct sunlight a day benefit
from sunscreen installation. The best candidates are tall windows facing south,
but east and west can also get very hot. Of course, part of the effect is the 
psychological comfort of shading, and you may want that anywhere.
You don’t want sunscreens in the winter, so they’re only temporary, which
means you need to mount them in removable frames or tack them up. You
can also roll them up like a blind or buy a finished blind that has solar screen.
Or get automatic, electric controllers so that with the push of a single button,
you can command every solar screen in your house.
129
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

You can expect at least three years’ lifetime with quality sunscreen, at around
$0.75 per square foot. (Cheap screen bleaches out and looks perpetually dirty.)
For a 3' x 6' window, if a screen lasts five years, the cost is only $2 per year
(with the cheapest installation method, namely tacking it up with thumbtacks).
If your climate is hot and sunny, you’ll undoubtedly get good payback on this
small investment.
Call a screen shop directly for tools, materials, and advice on how to install
sunscreen. Sunscreens come up to 8 feet wide, in huge rolls, so that you can
get as much length as you want. You can do the installation with nothing
more than tacks, a hammer, and a box cutter, but a good stapler ensures 
a quality, consistent job and is much easier.
You may want to ask the shop about coming out and putting up the sunscreen
for you. The workers can do a window in a few minutes, and their bid for the
entire job may not be much different from what you’d pay for the material
alone.
Getting framed
You can buy frames for sunscreens in a range of colors, and they come either
loaded with screen or empty. Most are aluminum. Easy-to-use mounting hard-
ware is an essential. Buy that when you get the frames because it’s one and the
same problem; the frames are useless without mounting hardware.
130
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 
Creating a manual screen retractor
The figure shows a way to make a manually oper-
ated screen retractor that works reliably, is easy
to use, and costs very little. You need a wooden
mount that’s slightly wider than your window,
three eyelets, a sunscreen, tacks, a dowel rod (as
long as the mount), and screws or nails (to install).
1. Drill three holes in the mount and attach the
eyelets.
The first two holes are 6" from each end of
the mount; the remaining hole should be 1"
from the end. Screw in the eyelets, making
sure that all three holes are lined up, facing
the ends of the mount.
2. Using a box cutter, cut the sunscreen to
size.
You want to make the sunscreen larger than
the window by about 4 inches, although if
you don’t have the room, any size will work,
even if it’s smaller than the window. A size
smaller than the window will just be
unsightly from inside, looking outside.
3. Tack the sunscreen onto the roll-up rod
(dowel) and the mount.
4. Put the cords in place.
Tie a cord to an eyelet that’s 6" from the end,
loop the cord over the top of the mount and
under the rod, and go back up through the
eyelet. Repeat on the other side. Then
thread both cords through the end eyelet,
the one that’s 1" from the end of the mount.
5. Screw or nail the mount onto the window
frame.
To retract the screen, simply pull the cords.

131
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results
If you like, paint the wood to match your house.
You can use pulleys instead of eyelets and get
smoother performance. If wind is an issue, get 
some fishing weights (the kind with holes so you
can get a nail through) and nail them into the ends
of the roller dowel, equal weight on each side.

Houses with wooden window frames work the best because they accept 
nearly every mounting scheme. If your house is stucco or you don’t have wood
around your windows, you’re limited to prefabricated frames with appropriate
mounting hardware. The job is more expensive but still potentially worthwhile.
Calculating the cost savings is difficult, so you’ll have to use your budgetary
constraints to decide whether it’s worthwhile. To find out what the effect will
be, get some cheap screen and tape it up to see how it changes your room; you
may not like the effect, which will govern how much you’re willing to spend.
If the frame’s wood, the fastest and cheapest way to cover a window is to
tack the screen right onto the window frame, using a hammer and tacks. Cut
the piece of sunscreen down to a few inches bigger than what you need, tack
it up, and then trim it with a scissors or a box cutter.
If you want a better look, consider cutting some planks of wood to frame 
the window, painting them, tacking them up over the screen (the screen is
already tacked up over the window — the frames are only for appearance,
not functionality), and trimming the excess screen to match. 
Get the wood from a lumber store — you can probably find a store that cuts
the wood for you, and the pieces will be exact and square. (Cabinet shops are
usually willing to do a small cutting job if you can’t find a lumber store that
does it.)
Using screws for installation is best because taking the screens down and then
putting them back up next year is easier. You need a drill to predrill holes for
the screws and a screwdriver. The lumber store staff can show you the best
screws and drill bits to use.
Putting up radiant barriers
A radiant barrier is a sheet of thin material that looks like reinforced aluminum
foil. You usually tack it up beneath your roof joists, and it keeps a lot of outside
heat out of your attic. The material itself isn’t all that expensive at $0.20 per
square foot. For a 2,000-square-foot house, the material costs $400. (Because
your roof joists are angled, you’ll need more material than the square footage
of your house. Multiply your square footage by 1.25 to get a good approxima-
tion of how much you need. Don’t worry if you don’t cover the entire roof.)
Also, do not cover up any vents because radiant barriers will not transmit air.
It’s advisable in hot climates; it cools the house down more than enough to
pay you back. But if you want your attic to get warm in the winter, it has the
opposite effect because it will prevent heat from entering, resulting in a cooler
132
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

house. Controlling the temperature in your attic is always a balance between
seasonal extremes, so decide whether heat or cold or both are your major
problem.
Installation is a bear, unless you can lay the material directly onto the floor
(or over the joists and insulation comprising the floor). Open rafters are the
best candidates, but if you have no floor and you have to hop around on
joists, you may want to find a different solar investment.
When installing on overhead joists, absolutely get a very good stapler. Electric
is best — get a powerful one. You’re going to be holding your arms over your
head half the time, and then you’ll be crouching over and twisting into a 
pretzel shape the other half. When you pull the trigger, you want a good, solid
staple to go in without argument.
Even if you can cover only a portion of the rafters, radiant barriers are worth
it. Try to cover an entire small area rather than spots at a number of different
areas. The hottest spots on your roof (usually the southern exposures) are
the best candidates.
Walls also work with radiant barriers, and doing a wall is usually a lot easier. An
uninsulated garage that gets way too hot in the summer is a good candidate,
although it may look like a spaceship when you’re done.
Before you decide to spend the money and install a radiant barrier, go up 
into your attic and see what it’s going to be like crawling around nailing it up.
Envision lifting the material up into the attic and then unrolling it, cutting it,
and holding it up into place. Envision the tools you need to carry around. One
person can’t put up radiant barriers, so get some assistance.
Attics can roast you fast. They can heat to over 130°F, easy. Working in the
morning usually solves this problem. Don’t kid yourself; if the temperature
feels really hot, it can be dangerous.
Securing Your Home
You can make some easy, solar-powered security systems for very little cost.
You can also have a lot of fun at somebody else’s expense.
By using strategic combinations of motion-activated sprinkler heads and
security lights, you can keep just about anything or anybody away from your
house. The great news is that both of these products come solar-powered, so
they work even in a power outage. These security devices are far from fool-
proof, but they deter 99 percent of potential offenders. The trick is place-
ment. Plan for maximum surprise and dramatic result.
133
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

Hosing down your problems
The idea is simple: Aim a stream of water into a region being sensed by a
motion detector — upon detection, the water triggers on. The entire thing is
powered by a solar panel, so you can set it up anywhere you have a hose.
Here are some intriguing applications:
 Security: If I were a burglar stalking a house and all of a sudden I was
hosed, I’d leave.
 Pest deterrence: Neighbor’s dog like your yard late at night? Deer eating
your landscape? Daughter’s boyfriend pushing it? Not if they have to
take an unplanned shower.
 Practical jokes: You can get some laughs out of this, but you better
make sure that the intended victim has a sense of humor and is dressed
appropriately. Set up your video camera first.
Blasting the bad guys with light
The device is called a security light, but you can find other applications. A PV
module connects via a length of wire to a battery, a spotlight, and a motion
detector. The module needs to be mounted in direct sunlight, the more the
better, but you can mount the light itself anywhere. Wire lengths of 15 feet
are common, but you can go a lot longer if you need to. The typical price is
around $80.
On the other hand, if you pay an electrician to install an electric junction box,
you’re looking at over $400, easy. And that location may not really be the best
location after all. With solar, you can position anywhere, easily and quickly.
And you can hang one of these inside your house just as well as out. The trick
is to get the PV panel in the sun — that’s all that matters.
Here are some applications:
 Aim it out over your front porch, and nobody ever has to approach your
house in the dark. Or mount it over your garage door, facing the driveway,
to provide light whenever somebody drives up.
 Aim it at a door, and whoever comes through suddenly finds himself or
herself in a spotlight.
 Use it as a motion-activated light inside your garage, or hang the light
over the work area in a remote storage shed.
 Put up a barn light to welcome the cows when they finally come home.
134
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 Dark basements are perfect. When you go down, the light comes on. It
goes off after you leave — no more grabbing around for switches and
burned-out light bulbs.
 Get some gazebo lighting or position one over a picnic table. Whenever
you sit down, you have light.
 In a remote cabin, you can provide all your lighting needs, indoors and
out. Just remember, motion sensors have a preset on time (you can
adjust this with some units to over ten minutes) so mount the units
where they’ll consistently pick up motion in the room. If not, you may be
caught in the dark, waving your hands around in an attempt to shed
some light. Actually, that sounds kind of fun — you may even be able to
invent a game out of it.
Engaging in Small Power Projects
You can run just about anything off of PV panels. The biggest questions are
 Whether you need a battery or not: A battery is required whenever
you’ll be using a device when the sun is not shining, such as night.
 Whether you need an inverter: PV panels put out DC voltages only; if
you need AC voltages, such as the kind that appliances take, you need
an inverter.
Battery power: Charging up your life
PV modules are ideal for charging batteries. The electronics are minimal, and
the costs are low because of it.
Leaving dead car batteries behind
Got an old truck, car, or RV that sits around and doesn’t get started very often?
How about a boat? If they’ve been giving you problems starting, a solar charger
may be a very cheap and effective solution. When a vehicle sits around without
being started up for a while, its battery grows weak. If the battery is old, it’s
even worse.
For $40, you can get a solar battery charger. A PV module plugs in to the 
cigarette lighter jack, and you lay the module out on the dashboard in the
sun. While you’re gone, it trickle charges your battery. A solar charger won’t
overcharge your battery, so you don’t have to worry about removing it, even
when the vehicle is running. But it probably won’t revive a dead battery,
although it won’t hurt anything to try.
135
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

Auto batteries cost around $80. With the $40 solar charger, you get more life-
time, up to 50 percent more, so there’s a reasonable payback. But how much
is it worth (in peace of mind, not to mention the costs of a tow-truck visit)
not to get stranded when you can’t get your car started?
Charging your electronics batteries with the sun
Standard, off-the-shelf batteries cost around $0.75 apiece. The cost for 100
throw-away alkaline batteries is $75, plus trips to the store to buy them. And
batteries have nasty chemicals, such as lead and acids. You run across an
environmental issue with 100 batteries.
Rechargeable batteries cost $4 apiece, and the good ones issue the same
charge as a throw-away. A solar charger costs $40, but the charge cycles are
free. You can charge a good rechargeable battery over 500 times. (Note that
the number 500 applies to devices like remote controllers, which don’t take
much current; if you’re drawing a lot of current and running the batteries
down to their minimum, expect more on the order of 200 times.)
The cost for a rechargeable battery and 100 charges is $44, which is already a
better deal than alkaline. But here’s the best part: The cost to charge the next
100 times is zero. And the next, and the next. After 500 free charges, you may
need a new battery, but that’s only $4.
Alkalines cost about 20 times as much as quality rechargeables to operate.
(Cheap rechargeables have much worse payback, so avoid them.) Spend
some extra money on quality batteries, and it’s a good investment.
The time to charge batteries (most devices charge four at a time) depends on
how much direct sunlight you receive. Setting up near a window is often good
enough if you don’t need a lot of batteries. If you use a lot, you need direct
sunlight. Kitchen bay windows are convenient candidates.
Keep a reserve of charged batteries. Buy twice as many as you need — it
doesn’t cost more because you go twice as long before you need to buy new
batteries.
Small-scale PV systems: Using 
just a modest amount of power
For $1,000, you can get a solar power system big enough to run anything 
in your house aside from the major appliances. You can power a home office,
where you may be able to write off some costs as a business expense. Or use
a solar power system in a remote cabin or a boat cabin or an RV. (For info on
large-scale PV systems, see Chapter 17.)
136
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

About $1,000 can get you 500 watt hours, or 1⁄2 kWh, or a 60-watt light bulb 
for 8 hours. This is plenty of power to run an office or all the equipment other
than power tools at a construction site. At this size (on the order of a small
end table), you won’t be toting your solar system around in a case, although
you can find units on sturdy wheels.
Working with RV appliances
Small appliances for RVs, boats, and camping are widely available, and any 
of these work with 12VDC solar power systems.
You may even be able to run some appliances without batteries, which makes
things a lot cheaper and easier. Heaters don’t care how the power looks (it can
fluctuate, the voltages and currents can change, there can be ripples galore);
how much heat you can generate is all that matters. Fans may blow directly
from a PV module; the more sun, the harder the fan pushes. Water pumps don’t
need batteries, and some portable coolers are made to connect directly to
solar panels.
You can also get a power system with a 120VAC outlet so you can use your
existing household electrical devices. You give up efficiency, but it may be
worth it. If you have a 12VDC system, you can buy a really cheap 120VAC
inverter from an auto supply store. They come with a cigarette lighter plug, 
so you have to do some splicing because most solar systems don’t come with
cigarette lighter jacks. The AC power is dirty, but it works for certain things
just fine. It’s difficult to specify a list for what will work and what won’t with-
out giving it a try. Radios may be noisy, as well as TVs, but some have good
internal power regulators. Anything with an internal battery won’t mind the
noisy AC power.
Going Off-Grid on a Piece-by-Piece Basis
You can go off-grid with small functions — you don’t need to go off-grid with
your entire home. You’ll save on your power bill, plus enjoy some interesting
independence and help save the environment, all in one.
Making your reading lamp go off-grid
If you like to read, you can spend $50 to get a small, battery-charged light
(LED) that works for four hours on a four-hour charge. A PV module with a
length of wire attaches to a battery/light/switch housing with Velcro backing.
137
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

Apply the matching Velcro anywhere you may want light. During the day, plug
in the PV module and set that in the direct sunlight. At night, press the light
into the Velcro and use it.
Solar lamps put out a lot of light, but it’s focused on a spot. The trick is to get
that spot on your book, and you find you have plenty of light. For this, you
want a lamp with an arm that extends out, over your book.
Stick Velcro onto the bottom of a conventional lamp head employing a goose-
neck adjustment arm, and press the solar light into that. You’ll be able to
position it directly over your book, about a foot and a half away.
If you’re using the solar lamp only in one location, run a cord over to a window
and tape the solar module flat onto the inside, facing out. You’ll probably get
enough sunlight to meet your needs. If not, look for more-direct sunlight.
If it’s not bright enough, use two. You can also buy more-expensive designs
with better lights, color, focusing, and battery.
Installing solar light tubes 
(tubular skylights)
A solar tube lighting system collects sunlight on the roof and transmits it down
a shiny, silver pipe into the diffuser, which broadcasts the light into the room
below. Figure 9-2 shows how a solar tube lighting system works. You can make
most rooms bright enough to work in, and they stay a lot cooler.

Solar light varies with the clouds and weather, changing the intensity of light
in the room quite a bit. You’re much more conscious of the outdoors. When
the sky is partly cloudy, you can get a lot of fluctuation. Personally, this is my
favorite aspect of solar tubes.
The light creates a certain cool mood due to the silver color. Some light tubes
come with filters for creating moods, but they cut out light as well. You can
change the nature of a room very dramatically with a filter.
Costs and payback
The typical price (uninstalled) is $230 for a 4-foot pipe length. After that, 
you need to buy extensions for $20 a foot.
Large-diameter units can output as much light as a dozen 100-watt light bulbs
at one-tenth the heat. If a $250 solar tube displaces only three 100-watt light
bulbs for eight hours a day, it pays for itself in 19 months. If you factor in the
cooling effect, payback is even faster.
Location
The best locations are dark corners in family rooms. That way, the light gets
used the most and has the most dramatic affect. They’re also good for dark,
isolated bathrooms. The natural light is comforting, and you never have to flip
a light switch during the day. Beware, though. They can drastically change the
way decor looks, maybe making the existing facades obsolete. Be prepared for
a much different bathroom.
If you have a dark kitchen, a solar tube may be the perfect solution, especially
if a lot of people come and go during the day. The cool tone of the light goes
especially well in a stainless steel kitchen.
Installation
You need a jigsaw, a sheetrock saw, screwdrivers, and basic tools. You
also need the requisite nerve to saw a hole through your roof; if you don’t
know what you’re doing, you can hire experts to install solar tubes. Chin
up, however — solar tubes come with very good installation instructions
and the appropriate sealing materials. The manufacturers rely on the do-it-
yourselfers, so they bend over backwards telling you how to do it (as well
as how not do it, which is just as important).
Here are some tips for handling some of the installation challenges:
 Don’t try to buy separate parts; get a complete kit, with however many
extension tubes you think you need. You may want to get an extra and
leave it in the box for return. Otherwise, when you find that you don’t
have enough extension tube, you’ll probably have holes cut in ceilings
and roofs, and you won’t want to stop everything and go to a store. And
Murphy’s law says that when you get there, they’ll have just run out.
139
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

 The hardest part of the job is probably in the attic space, so plan your
route up, then your route over to where the work is going to be done, and
then how you’ll sit and stand when you get over there. Also, realize that
you’ll be toting tools with you; the best bet is a tool belt, but if you don’t
have one, use a sturdy bag. Of course, Murphy says that once you reach
the work location, you’ll discover that you didn’t remember a particular
tool!
 You may want to look at the installation instructions before you buy a unit
for a list of tools you’ll need. If you’re going to have to buy one, or rent
one, add that to the cost of the project.
 Cutting through a typical roof takes more than a toy saw, so use a good
jigsaw. Composite shingles eat jigsaw blades, so get extra.
 Take extra precautions to seal against the weather. (Use a good silicon
sealant, although most kits will come with appropriate sealant.) If the
elements can possibly get in, they will — maybe not this year, but
Mother Nature has infinite patience.
 You can botch a few things on this job and nobody will ever notice, but
you need to get the hole in your ceiling right. Measure twice; cut once.
 The key to a successful project is to locate the hole properly in your 
ceiling before you start cutting. Installation instructions are very explicit
for this step, so follow them closely.
 You’re going to want to make sure that you have enough extension tube.
(Most solar tubes come with 4 feet of extension tube, with 2-foot exten-
sions as options.) Get more than you think you need, save the receipt, and
take back the extra. The last thing you want is to get halfway through the
job, with holes in your ceiling and roof and discover you don’t have
enough extension tube.
Using tabletop solar fans
Simply take a small 12VDC room fan and a suitable PV panel and wire them
directly together. The hotter the sun, the more the air moves — no need for
batteries. At $150, a solar fan isn’t a cheap option, but it may be reasonable 
if your energy costs are high enough. Plus, you can use one anywhere; you
don’t need a plug.
These fans work nicely on porches, where you can position the panel right 
outside to catch the most sunlight. They’re great for RV or even tent camping
when the weather’s hot enough. Solar fans are perfect for a pleasure boat in the
hot sun. Pool houses, as well as remote casitas (small guest houses), likewise
benefit.
140
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Cooking with the Sun
A solar oven can bake at temperatures above 350°F. You can’t rely on precision
temperature control, so you have to stick with foods that aren’t fussy. But
plenty of foods fit the bill.
You can set a solar oven anywhere you want — in the backyard, next to the
barbecue, or on a balcony with a lot of sunlight. After working with your oven
for a few weeks, you should be able to cook just as well as you do indoors.
You just need to pick up a few tricks first. In this section, I explain these
tricks — as well as how to build your own solar oven.
Solar ovens are not toy ovens, not by a long stretch. A solar oven can burn
you every bit as badly as a conventional oven. You generally want to keep kids
away (although a weak solar oven may be a good way for them to discover
some fundamentals without much danger — a weak oven is one used in
cloudy conditions or one with poor insulation or no reflectors).
Making a solar oven
You can make a good solar oven for under $40, and it works even if you do 
a messy job of construction. In fact, they’re so cheap, building a sloppy test
oven to learn the ropes is a good strategy. Then you can build yourself a 
quality unit that’s more convenient and lasts a long time.
Here’s a parts list for the oven itself (the next section mentions pans you use
when doing the actual cooking):
 Plain old cardboard box, around 20" x 20" x 18" deep; double-walled 
corrugated cardboard walls are best.
 A sturdy piece of flat cardboard that matches the top of your oven; if the
oven is 20" x 20", that’s the size lid you need, with a little overlap.
 Tape, with good old duct tape working just fine. Masking tape also works,
but not the kind for painting because the adhesive is too weak.
 Standard household insulation (not white styrofoam, but hardboard
style), 1" thick; this stuff is around $11 for a 4' x 8' piece.
 Aluminum foil, heavy duty with one shiny side at least, about 10 square
feet.
 White glue.
 Flat, black spray paint designed for barbecue pits or woodstoves.
 Turkey bags or big roasting bags.
141
Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

Figure 9-3 shows how to assemble your oven:
1. Bend the flaps of the cardboard box out and down, and tape them
down at the corners.
2. Prepare the insulation and aluminum foil and glue them in the box.
Cut the insulation to size to fit the bottom of the box, then the front and
back, left and right sides of the cardboard box. For even better results,
use two layers of insulation. Glue aluminum foil on one side of each
piece of insulation, and spray paint the foil black. Glue the pieces of
insulation into the box with the black facing the inside of the oven. If
you’re using fiberglass-based insulation, use gloves and eyewear; the
insulation should indicate when these precautions are necessary.
3. Prepare the lid.
Make sure that the cardboard lid is a little larger than the top of your
oven. Then cut an opening in the lid to match the interior size of the
oven. Cut the roasting bag and tape it over the opening in the lid.
4. Poke the barbecue thermometer through the front of the oven.
Cooking with a solar oven
The first time, just set the oven into direct sunlight and watch the tempera-
ture climb. Play around and see how the temperature varies with different
conditions.
Ovens that get the hottest are the ones that get the most amount of periodic
positioning into direct sunlight.
You can use your solar oven in the winter, but it won’t get as hot because the
outside air is cooler, plus you get less sunlight in the winter (see Chapter 5).
To do the actual cooking, you need a good drip pan to facilitate both cooking
and cleaning. Use a shallow cookie sheet or pan, shown in Figure 9-4, that fits
inside your oven (because of the added insulation, its length and width need to
be at least 2" smaller than the bottom of your cardboard box). You also need a
black, aluminum baking pot with a snug lid — everything that’s cooked will go
into this pot, so this will limit your food options. You can make an oven as big
as you want, however, so that you’re not really limited. Some people have
cooked Thanksgiving turkeys in a solar oven, to very good effect. The pot will
get hotter than the temperature of the oven cavity itself (unlike a conventional
oven), so be extra careful. You’ll be pulling the heated pot up and out of the
oven, so get handles that facilitate this upward and downward motion. Certain
pots work better than others, so try some different candidates and see what
happens.

Chapter 9: Jumping In to Small Projects with Big Results

Solar ovens can get real hot, over 400°F. Not only can you get burned, but 
if you put napkins or other flammables onto them, you can start a fire. (The
cardboard box is well insulated from the heat, so it won’t catch on fire.) Treat
a solar oven with the same level of respect that you treat your conventional
oven.
You can use a simple oven as a warmer for rolls and potatoes and food that’s
already been cooked. This method is especially convenient next to a barbecue
pit. As you finish burgers or brats, put them into the solar oven — they stay
nice and hot.
You may be able to cook corn on the cob. Put each ear into a roaster bag 
with some butter, seal it, and wait. The precise amount of time isn’t important,
and neither is the temperature. You can cook half a dozen ears next to your
barbecue, and they taste better than the boiled variety.
Likewise, you can heat pots of beans, chili, and other canned goods such 
as vegetables and soups, depending on the sun.
Solar ovens aren’t ideal for foods with specific times and temperatures. 
For example, a cake may not be a good idea.
Your solar oven already has a built-in timer. In the morning, just put something
in and then aim the oven at whatever point in the sky you want it to cook. For
example, aim where the sun is at 5 p.m., and when you get home from work,
your dinner’s ready!
Improving your next solar oven design
After you know how to build a basic solar oven (see the earlier “Making a solar
oven” section), you’re free to play around with the design. Here are some ideas:
Set a shallow cookie sheet,
or similar, on floor of oven

 Reflectors: You can boost the heat quite a bit with a reflector, which
functions to increase the amount of total sunlight radiation that gets into
the oven cavity. Cut some cardboard, glue aluminum foil to each piece
(shiny side out), and tape the reflectors together and onto the oven (see
Figure 9-5).
 Mounting: The best way to mount a solar oven is on a cart with wheels.
That way, you can easily twist it around and point the oven toward
direct sunlight.
 Glass window: Go to a window shop and get a piece of glass that looks
around the size of a good solar oven lid. The next time you build an
oven, use a box enclosure that matches. Glass shops often give out
frame assemblies for free. Glass is a much better insulator than a plastic
bag. Double-pane glass is even better, as long as the seal between the
panes isn’t broken, in which case it’s useless.
Be careful if you have an aluminum frame, which can get very hot.
Wooden frames have such good insulation that you don’t need a hot pad
to move them.
 Size: Bigger capacity ovens with large reflectors are capable of getting
really hot, and they’re easier to work the food in and out of. With a good-
sized, glass-windowed oven and reflectors, you may be able to roast a
turkey on Thanksgiving Day, depending on the weather.
 Plywood box: The sturdiest boxes are made of plywood. You can buy
pieces cut from lumber yards or get wood from a cabinet shop. The wood
is square and even, which affords integrity with nothing more than wood
glue to hold it together. Some of the best homemade solar ovens are made
of plywood frames, which not only can you twist to follow the sun, but
you can also rotate up and down to maximize the sunlight.

T
he sun is a perfect water heater — all you have to do is expose water to
sunlight, and it warms up with zero pollution. Heating water is easier than
creating electricity for the do-it-yourselfer, and it usually makes more econom-
ical sense as a first step. Even if you decide to put in a large-scale electrical
system, you should first consider installing a solar water heater because you
can then specify a smaller electrical system. The ratio of dollars-saved on your
power bill to dollars-invested is usually better for solar water heating than
solar electrical generation. You can spend less than a few hundred dollars on
the simplest system, or you can spend upwards of $5,000 for the most 
complex.
In this chapter, I go through the basics of heating water with the sun, from
collectors to flow systems to mounting the systems. I also help you decide
whether to do the work yourself or hire a contractor. Finally, I offer you an easy
water purification project so you can break into the water distillation racket. 
(If you want info on installing a solar water heater supplement in your home,
flip to Chapter 12. If you’re interested in heating your swimming pool with 
a solar heater, go to Chapter 11.)
Exploring Water Heating Systems
The most basic classification of solar water heaters is whether they’re active
or passive. In active (or forced circulation) systems, pumps move the fluids.
These systems require both a power source and a controller, which decides

when to pump or not pump. Passive systems use no pumps to move the water.
(However, this definition comes with an asterisk. When you use the pressure
from your cold water supply to drive your system, you still have a pump some-
where — it just belongs to your municipality! Or if you’re on a well, the pump 
is deep within the Earth.) Passive means no pumps or moving parts are in the
solar system itself. Passive systems are cheaper because they’re simpler and
have fewer parts. But they’re also less versatile. Active systems, on the other
hand, are capable of outputting more energy and working under a wider range
of weather conditions. I explain a number of systems in the following sections,
both active and passive.
In addition to choosing between active and passive systems, you have a couple
of other decisions to make:
 Direct systems heat the water right in the collector. Open-loop systems
are all direct. Water is fed into the loop and taken out of the loop after it’s
heated.
 Indirect systems use heat exchangers. A secondary fluid (water, glycol, 
or antifreeze) collects the heat, which is then transferred to the water via
a heat exchanger. These systems are used in cold climates, where water
would freeze if it were exposed to the elements. Closed-loop systems have
isolated circuits with a constantly recirculating fluid. They’re all indirect
and active (they require pumps). They require entirely different engineer-
ing than open-loops and are generally much more expensive because of
their increased parts count and complexity.
Getting the Scoop on Solar Components
Every passive solar water heating system has several basic functions and
components:
 Collectors: Sunlight must be collected and transformed into usable heat.
 Flow: A flow system channels the heated water to where you plan to 
use it.
 Controller: A controller makes judicious decisions on when and how 
to move the water.
 Mounting: You mount the collector to optimize the amount of sunlight
received (see Chapter 5 for more on your solar potential).
Active systems add a pump and an active (electrical) means of controlling
the pump.
148
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

In systems with copper and metal parts, using softened water is essential
because hard water will calcify and corrode some pipes. You may need to
find out whether your water is soft enough.
Any solar water heating system presents a danger of scalding. Water over a
temperature of 160°F can burn you badly enough to require medical attention.
You need to understand exactly what your system is doing and where the dan-
gers lurk. If you’re going to install any kind of system, even if you don’t do it
yourself, you should understand what’s going on inside and why. If you have
children, consider all the ways they may be able to hurt themselves. When in
doubt, back off, think things through, and proceed with caution. Well-designed
systems account for these dangers, and the systems are perfectly safe. County
codes all require the use of a temper valve, which mixes hot water with supply
water to reach the desired user temperature.
Collecting the sunlight
Some systems are nothing more than solar collectors. For example, when
covering your swimming pool with a solar blanket, you simply float it directly
over the water. When you want to swim, you remove the blanket. You can do
this by hand or use mechanized rollers that automatically retract the blanket
for you. In either case, you are the controller because you’re deciding when
to place or remove the blanket.
149
Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water
The big chill: Avoiding freeze damage
Freeze damage is a major concern. If you have
no danger of freezing, you can use any type of
system you want. If your climate freezes a lot,
you’re limited, although your options are still
good. Here’s how to deal with the risks:
 In a process called recirculation, some sys-
tems (active) turn the pump on when the
temperature gets low enough. Moving liquid
will not freeze nearly as easily as stationary
liquid. This method works well, but it’s ineffi-
cient; the basic goal of a solar system is to
collect energy, not use it to preserve the
system.
 Drain valves, either manual or automatic,
may purge the collector and exposed pipes
of all fluids. This works, but in this context,
all means all because if any trace amounts
linger, freeze damage can still occur. This
works well, but once again, the process
takes energy, and this implies inefficiency.
 Closed-loop systems use antifreeze and a
heat exchanger. Water in the system can
ever freeze. These are the most common
types of systems installed on houses in
North America because they’re the most
versatile and reliable.

As for more technical systems, a wide range of different collector construc-
tions are available, with varying performance characteristics that depend on
the application and quality of materials. Regardless of the type, some funda-
mentals apply.
The efficiency of a collector is a measure of how well it converts radiation into
usable heat. Efficiency is a function of how hot the collector is; the hotter an
object, the more heat it emits. The idea is to collect the heat, not emit it.
Running higher quantities of fluids through a collector (or running the fluids
faster) doesn’t result in any more heat collection because that’s determined by
the available radiation. However, running more fluids through usually keeps the
collector cooler, which means less heat loss to the external ambient, and
therefore better efficiency.
The lifetime of a collector is important in your decision-making. Some don’t last
more than a couple of years with full exposure to the sun. Others are guaran-
teed for more than ten years. If you’re placing your collector in an easy-access
location, a limited lifetime — and its associated cheap cost — may be best. But
if you don’t want to change equipment (if it’s up on a roof), expect to pay more
for your collectors.
Integral collector storage (ICS) collectors for pools
Direct, integral collector storage (ICS) collectors — such as swimming pool col-
lectors and the batch collectors commonly used in Third World countries —
are filled with the water that’s being heated. The simplest and cheapest collec-
tor on the market is a flexible, plastic molded grid suitable for swimming pool
applications. These come in 2' x 16' sheets (among other sizes) that you can
lay right on the ground. The flow diagram in Figure 10-1 shows a very simple
swimming pool collector.
Lay these collectors on the ground, connect them right into your existing
pool pump system with flexible hose, and you’re ready to go. Or you can lay
them on a roof with a few mounting straps to keep them from sliding. If you
have a Spanish tile roof, you can get collectors that curve right around the
profile — it’s expensive but doable.
ICS collectors are available in most swimming pool supply stores. Expect to
spend around $230 for 80 square feet for the simplest models. For the kind you
mount onto your roof, the added integrity (lifetime) and performance costs
more.
Efficiency is very good because these collectors don’t get too hot unless you’re
pumping the water through the collector slowly. Even then, inefficiency doesn’t
cost you much. (ICS collectors are notoriously inefficient in wind and rain, but
so what?)
150
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Most ICS collectors are made of copolymer plastic. Some designs are more 
efficient at collecting heat because they swirl the water around to maximize
contact with the plastic walls. However, they also make the pump work harder,
so there is a tradeoff. If your power rates are high, the extra expense of loading
your pump is probably not worth the increase in efficiency.
Here are a few pointers to keep in mind:
 Always consider repairs. Find out whether a repair kit comes with the
collector or if you can get one. Ask what happens if the collector gets 
a hole. Look for a warranty.
 If you stomp on ICS collectors, they can rupture. Children have also been
known to find innovative ways to destroy them. (Of course, as any parent
knows, children find innovative ways to destroy just about everything!)
 Hard or mineral-laden water can build up and block the flow as well as
prevent radiation from being converted into heat. Mineral buildup also
makes the heat transfer between the plastic and the water less efficient.
You can’t clean out the deposits once they build up in the collector. You
can get chemicals from a swimming pool supply store to remove minerals
from the water, and you can also get a filter that you use on the input from
your domestic water supply. (The flow rate is cut considerably, so expect
a lot longer times to fill your pool.) On the plus side, the plastic materials
are impervious to the caustic nature of chlorine.
 Plastic collectors expand and contract with temperature. Therefore,
mounting must always allow for flexibility.

Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water

Batch collectors
A version of direct ICS (see the preceding section), batch collectors can be very
simple: Simply put a tank of water in the sun and let it heat up (see Figure 10-2).
If you paint the tank black, it absorbs heat. If you use some reflective material
such as aluminum foil to focus even more sunlight onto the tank, it works even
better. If you seal it in an enclosed container with a glazed window, you get the
best results.
The reflector serves to heat all the surfaces of the tank, top and bottom, as
well as collect sunlight from a larger area than just the tank itself. If the reflec-
tor is big enough, you can collect a whole lot of heat. The window insulates
the tank from the weather outside, preventing heat loss at night and in cold
climates. (Note that you don’t necessarily need the reflector inside the glaze,
or window. (Most people think of a window as being glazed, but in the world
of solar, glazing and windows are often equivalent and exchangeable terms.)
Insulation around the walls of the housing reduces heat loss.
Batch collectors work well without pumps and control systems, so they’re
good candidates in remote locations. And they’re simple to build: You can
make one out of a 55-gallon drum painted black, and in some parts of the
world, this is standard operating procedure.
Batch collectors can weigh a lot, more than 1,000 pounds, so you need to
make sure that the mounting location can handle this kind of weight. Don’t
get fooled by their empty weight.

Flat-plate solar collectors
Figure 10-3 shows a very common flat-plate solar collector. A rectangular box
(2' or 4' wide by 4' to 12' long and 8" thick) contains the parts. A copper or 
aluminum absorber plate at the bottom of the box is finished black to absorb the
maximum amount of sunlight. Rows of fluid circulation tubes (copper, or another
good heat conductor) are in direct contact with the absorber plate; as sunlight
warms the plate, heat transfers to the circulation tubes and into the fluid. The
absorber plate is insulated from the housing, and a glass or plastic cover
(called a glaze) seals the unit and allows maximum sunlight in with minimum
heat loss. Quality units feature a glazed window made of low-iron silicon glass.
Flat-plate solar collectors are the most widely used type of collector. They
heat water very efficiently, and they have no moving parts or maintenance
requirements, aside from keeping the window clean of debris. They work well
in wind and rain, shed snow very well because of their inherent warmth, and
can endure brief freezing conditions without damage. And if you combine this
configuration with an ICS type collector (see the earlier section) by using large-
diameter tubes to hold the water, cold damage takes even longer to occur. You
can configure a multiple of these units in either series or parallel arrangements
and double or triple the capacity. This is often a good tactic when you need to
distribute the weight over a larger surface area of your roof.
Here are a few safety and maintenance issues to consider:
 Exercise care when working around any glazed collector. Not only can
the parts get very hot, but the fluid is designed to get very hot as well.
 Depending on how large the unit is and how much metal mass is used, 
a flat-plate solar collector may weigh quite a bit. Carefully think out posi-
tioning onto the roof and mounting beforehand. Mounting usually means
getting plenty of help.
 Always purchase the mounting hardware with the collector to eliminate
the possibility of dissimilar metals and galvanic reactions. (If you put
certain metals in contact with each other, they corrode due to chemical
reactions between the metals.) When you buy mounting hardware as part
of your system, the manufacturers have already selected the proper 
materials for you.

Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water

 Glazes are very fragile; they can literally shatter with the slightest 
provocation. Work carefully.
Evacuated tube collectors
Figure 10-4 shows the construction of an evacuated tube solar collector. A row 
of glass envelopes (tubes) have had the air removed, which creates a vacuum
and makes for excellent insulation. Copper rods inside the tubes are physically
connected to a massive copper tube inside the enclosed header, through which
water (or other liquid) flows. The copper rods get very hot on a sunny day, and
the heat moves directly into the copper mass in the header and from there into
the fluid. When reflectors are located behind the tubes, these collectors can be
even more effective.
These collectors are impervious to freezing conditions and work very well,
even when the air temperatures go below zero. They are more expensive,
however.
People can also make these systems with fluid-filled tubes inside, instead 
of rods. Then you have a direct, batch-type evacuated collector (see the 
preceding section). Look for more of these in the future.
Evacuated tube collectors work well in windy and wet conditions that would
normally cool down other types of collectors. This type of system doesn’t
freeze and is extremely well insulated, yielding effective heat storage. In fact,
the rods can reach temperatures exceeding 250°F while the glass envelopes 
are cool to the touch. They don’t shed snow, and they’re way too fragile to try
to brush the snow away or scrape ice off.
These collectors perform better than other types of collectors on cloudy
days, and on sunny days, they work for more of the daylight hours because
the tubes are always perpendicular to the sun (see Chapter 5).
Evacuated tube collectors are very fragile; if the seal breaks, performance 
is poor because the vacuum is compromised, and insulation is poor.
154
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Pipe dreams: Setting up the flow of traffic
Pipes and/or tubing runs from the collector to the working apparatus — 
usually back and forth so you have parallel sets, one pipe always hotter than
the other. (One pipe is directing water into the collector; the other has the
warmed water going back into the workable apparatus.)
Here are some tips on choosing your materials:
 Pipe makeup: For household systems, copper pipe is the best choice. It’s
flexible, easy to work with, operates over a wide range of temperatures,
resists corrosion, and is commonly available. But it’s heavy, especially
when filled with water, so you need to take care mounting it properly. For
swimming pool systems, PVC pipe is the overwhelming choice, although
flexible hoses are often used with portable systems.

Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water

 Pipe size: Consider your goals when choosing a pipe thickness (the outer
diameter of the pipe). A very thick pipe weighs much more than a very thin
one when filled with water. On the other hand, a thick pipe makes your
system more efficient because the pump doesn’t have to work as hard.
 Insulation: Insulation is a must outdoors and highly recommended 
inside. Fiberglass pipe insulation is very good indoors, but it’s useless out-
doors because it absorbs water, causing it to saturate and rot. Outdoors,
HT/Armaflex is your best bet. It lasts a long time, indoors and out. Put a
plastic jacket over the insulation to shield it from the elements.
 Flanges: You need to use suitable flanges to keep the pipe in place when
feeding through roofs or walls. You don’t want to introduce leaks into your
house when you install solar equipment. You also need to be mindful of
weight loads because flanges often bear the brunt of the forces. Flanges
come with weight-load specifications, but these numbers are dependent
on proper installation, so read the instructions carefully.
Make sure that you map out the flow of fluid before installation. Minimizing
the length of runs is desirable for cost and efficiency. Also, bury pipes when-
ever possible, which prevents freezing, makes for very good insulation, and
hides them from view.
Be mindful of the pressures that can build up at the bottom of the pipes if
you’re running them up to a second- or third-story roof (see the next section
for info on pressure relief valves). You also need to understand how to purge
air from the pipes when you fire up a system. (You can do so in a number of
ways, and your system instructions will detail the method that applies to
your particular situation.)
Painting pipes the same color as your house’s exterior is common, so plan on
using a good primer on PVC or metal pipes. If you use insulation, it may not
take paint very well.
Completing the flow system 
with valves and monitors
The big functional items are in place. To keep the pressures and temperatures
where they should be, a number of different valves are commonly used. And
to be able to see how your system is operating, monitors are installed in
appropriate locations.
 Thermometers, flow meters, and pressure gauges: These devices let you
see the system parameters; otherwise, you have no way to tell whether
anything’s happening, let alone happening the right way.
156
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 Check valves: These valves allow fluid to flow in only in one direction.
The most common are swing valves, which have a little gate that swings
like a dog door that’s constrained to only one direction. The best ones
are made of bronze, and they’re very reliable. Because the gate is gravity
forced, swing valves only work when they’re horizontal or tilted upward.
Don’t use spring check valves; they load pumps too much, which 
constricts flow.
 Pipe unions: These connectors join two pipes without solder or perma-
nent connection. Pipe unions are commonly used to interface with all col-
lectors, so you can remove the collector from the system for servicing or
replacement without having to cut pipe.
 Drain valves: Drain valves are part of every solar water system because
they are the means to drain the fluid out of the system (maintenance,
weather safety, and so on). Ball valves are most reliable; they use a spin-
ning ball with a big hole, constrained in a socket. They’re either on or off.
Gate valves (such as the faucets used on your backyard hoses) have a
twist handle that regulates the amount of flow by means of a gate lowered
into the fluid path. People don’t use them much on solar heating systems
because you rarely want a valve that’s partially open.
 Relief valves: These valves protect against pressure buildup (on the 
top of your water heater you’ll likely see one). They’re required for every
closed loop system (see the earlier “Exploring Water Heating Systems”
section).
Be careful; relief valves can pop open at any time, and they spray the
area with whatever’s in the pipes or tank they’re protecting. If they’re on
a hot water tank, it’s going to be hot water. If they’re in a solar system,
the hot water may be super heated. In general, always use a drainage
tube with a relief valve so that if the valve does open, you channel the
flow to a safe location, such as under an enclosed porch.
 Tempering valves (mixing valves): These valves have three ports: cold in,
hot in, and mixed output. A twist handle controls the output temperature
at your faucet.
Tempering valves provide very important anti-scald protection and are
always part of solar water heating systems. Don’t be cheap here!
 Motorized valves: These valves are controlled electrically. They can be
either off-on or proportional (a mixture of off and on, or an ability to con-
trol the amount of flow). The type chosen is a function of the applica-
tion. For example, in most system applications, off/on is all that is
required, and these valves are cheaper and easier to operate.
157
Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water

 Vacuum breakers: Vacuum breakers allow air into a system when it’s
depressurized. You use them to quickly drain systems, such as rooftop
pool collectors. If you need to drain your system for winter use, you usu-
ally need a vacuum breaker; if you need to drain quickly, a vacuum
breaker is definitely necessary.
Forcing the issue with pumps 
and thermosiphons
Active systems always use a powered pump. For a swimming pool, it’s the filter
pump. For a closed-loop system, you need an electric pump in the closed loop.
A temperature probe, or probes, and a control circuit turn the pump off and on
appropriately. There are a thousand different types of pumps, and the best way
to choose a pump is to buy a complete system. It’s a difficult engineering prob-
lem to choose the proper pump, so if you need to do it, call a pump store and
talk to a clerk for advice.
If you have a passive system connected to your water source, the municipal-
ity is your pump. For well users, the pump is deep at the bottom of your well.
In either case, you don’t need to provide the pump, but you still have one in
the system.
You can get some circulation without using a pump. A passive thermosiphon
is a device set up with a tank mounted above the thermal collector. Hot water
weighs less than cold, so as the water in the collector heats up, hot water
rises into the upper tank while the heavier, cold water migrates down into the
collectors. Thermosiphons are entirely passive, and they are commonly used
in isolated locations where electricity is not available. With no moving parts,
thermosiphons are extremely reliable and efficient.
Directing traffic with controllers
A solar blanket for your swimming pool is controlled by applying the blanket
or retracting it. You’re the controller. Other solar water heaters, however,
require temperature controllers that are a little more high-tech. Take a look:
 A collector connected to your pool pump works whenever the pump is
working. The controllers are electric clocks that cycle every 24 hours;
you adjust the mechanical position of off and on tabs.
 Domestic water heater systems often use an electronic controller that
takes temperatures, time of day, and other factors into account. These
158
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

controllers are usually digital, and you can easily program them for your
particular application. They also prevent scalding fluids, and they control
valves to evacuate systems in freezing conditions.
 Differential temperature controllers have two separate temperature
probes located in various parts of a system; they open and close valves
in response to programmed logic.
Addressing mounting concerns
If you mount solar panels on your roof, you can accomplish several things:
 You maximize your solar exposure, so you don’t have to worry about
shading from your house, trees, and the like.
 You can use the roof’s pitch to angle your solar collector to intercept the
most sunlight without the need for complex brackets.
 You’re shielding a portion of your roof from direct sunlight, moving that
heat to a different location. If you were to cover your entire roof with
solar panels, no direct sunlight would ever hit your roof. Your attic
would be cooler, as would your entire house!
When you’re deciding whether to mount equipment on your roof, consider
how long it’s going to be before you need to put up a new roof. Having the
roofers contend with solar collectors makes job more expensive, so you may
want to opt for ground-mounting or change the roof first. Here are some other
factors to consider:
 Weather: Ultimately, understanding when and how to maintain your
system so it won’t be destroyed in bad weather is your responsibility.
Most solar collectors include warranty restrictions against freezing
damage, but it’ll be on your dime if you don’t follow the rules. If you
need to follow certain restrictions against freezing, how you mount the
collector may be important. For example, if you need special valves to
drain your system, you need to make sure that the valves are readily
accessible.
The wind can exert big forces on your panels. If they aren’t mounted
properly, you can end up with a destructive flying object (DFO) in the
neighborhood!
 Proximity to the domestic water heater tank: Close is best. The farther
from the storage tank you place the collector, the more inefficient the
system will be. In the winter, heat loss from uninsulated pipes may 
actually offset heat gains.
159
Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water

 Damage from wildlife: Animals can destroy panels. Do you have rac-
coons? How about birds that may consider a nice solar panel to be the
perfect toilet? Cows can destroy a panel in three seconds flat. Goats may
prefer them for dessert. The list goes on.
 Human damage and safety: Consider whether the panel location lends
itself to vandalism, theft, or target practice. If your kids are likely to see
your solar collector as a state-of-the-art set of monkey bars, you may
want to put the panels up and away.
 Potential failures and drainage issues: A small hole in a closed-loop 
circulating system can turn into big trouble. If you put a solar collector
below the level of your swimming pool, a small hole can literally drain
your entire pool.
 Available space: Redundancy may be desirable — instead of using one
large collector, you can use two that are half the size.
 Available sunlight and desire for efficiency. With adjustable mounting
brackets, manual adjustment allows for varying the elevation angle over
the course of the year. The winter sun is much lower in the sky than in
summer; by adjusting the angle of your collector, you can optimize effi-
ciency. You may also want to couple more sun during the morning versus
the afternoon; in this case, you adjust the east/west orientation. (For more
on maximizing solar potential, see Chapter 5.)
 Appearance: Passive solar panels aren’t beautiful objects of art. If you
want to put collectors on your roof, go up there and lay a dark-colored
tarp down and then step back and see what it’s going to look like from the
street. Does it destroy the aesthetic harmony of your roof? Roof lines can
drastically influence the appearance of your house.
How does your solar collector affect the neighbor’s view? You may not
want to make enemies out of your neighbors by shifting the “ugly burden”
over to them.
Deciding Whether to Do It Yourself
You have the option to install solar systems entirely on your own, or you can
hire a contractor to do the entire job or any portion of it.
Weighing your options
You can design a system reasonably well without professional guidance. Still,
climbing around on a roof and soldering pipes isn’t for everyone. In addition
to your own skills, here are some factors to consider when deciding whether
to install a solar water system on your own:
160
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 Cost: You can save a lot of money by doing your own installation. First,
the contractors mark up the parts, so you can get them cheaper if you
look around. And of course, contractors have high labor rates, which
include insurance, licensing, and so on.
 System problems and installation risks: The vast majority of problems
with solar water heating systems occur from faulty installation. Even
licensed contractors make mistakes, but at least if you hire a contractor,
you’ll have recourse.
If you break a big, heavy collector, you have a massive object with a
voided warranty that you need to truck back to the factory. Is it worth
it? And mounting on your roof requires holes in your roofing material. If
you don’t do it right, you can create leaks. Nothing is worse than finishing
a nice new project, only to find that you have an even bigger project
fixing the leaks in your roof during a heavy rainstorm!
 Safety risks: Getting the panels onto your roof may be the most difficult
part of an installation. Use common sense about whether to hire some-
body to mount your collectors! Consider the amount of damage that may
occur if you fall and weigh it against the potential cost savings of doing-it-
yourself. It’s quite a mismatch — you can’t argue that.
Thousands of accidents occur each year when people fall off roofs, and
the injuries can be serious, maybe even fatal. Composition shingles can
be slippery when they’re old because the surface grit comes loose. This
can catch you by surprise (and the only surprise you want is on your
birthday). Roofs are always dangerous when they’re wet. Roofs with
steep pitches are always dangerous, period.
 Warranties and insurance: Sometimes when you do your own installa-
tion, the manufacturers’ warranties don’t apply. Check first with the
manufacturers. (Some manufacturers refuse to sell their parts to private
parties; they work only through licensed contractors.) Also check with
your insurance company to see what varieties of damages will be 
covered by an incorrectly installed system.
 Tax incentives and rebates: Sometimes tax incentives and rebates are
contingent upon a system being installed by a qualified and licensed
contractor. See Chapter 21 for more details on how to research the 
particulars.
 County codes: A lot of locales require county building inspectors for the
plumbing job. You can do your own plumbing and still pass, but you may
want to consider this in your decision.
161
Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water

Going alone
Most swimming pool systems are reasonable projects for do-it-yourselfers
because they use PVC, don’t exposure you to high temperatures, and are
mostly passive. If you make a mistake, the consequences aren’t dire. You 
may flood your roof or your yard, but you won’t destroy your home.
Most domestic water heater projects require plumbing skills, at the very least.
You need to understand all the valves and system pressure requirements. As
you do the installation, you need to route the pipes to the collectors and then
back to the working volume. Weight considerations are important. You need to
use the right feedthroughs, flanges, and clamps. But this stuff can be easy if
you do your homework. All kinds of online resources can help you plan your
installation.
Copper tube soldering is tricky, so if you’re hesitant about working with copper
tubing, get some tubes, a blowtorch, solder, and flux, and try some solder
joints before you decide to do the whole job. If you’re like me, you’ll completely
shank the first try, the next won’t be so bad, and the tenth will be very good.
If you design a system yourself, you may either overspecify or underspecify
the capacity, but this is no big deal. The block diagrams (the system prescrip-
tion, including all the parts and where they go in relation to each other, and
in relation to the mounting environment) are the most important thing to get
right. You have to have the valves, the pumps, and collectors, in the right
location. Then you need to build the system according to plan.
You can avoid a lot of problems by ground-mounting. If you have enough
room around your house, this may be the way to go. Plus you get good
access for servicing and upgrades.
Before you begin the installation stage, make a detailed list of the tools you
need. Do you have them? Can you rent them? Consider how you’re going to
get the collectors up on the roof (Two large friends? A winch? Elephants?).
And as always, measure twice; cut once.
At the very least, get a quotation or two, even if you’re inclined to do your
own installation. You can learn a lot. And here’s some of the best advice in
this entire section: Try to find a house you can go to that has the same type
of system you’re considering. Take a detailed look at all the parts and what
sort of tasks are going to be required. There’s no substitute for getting your
hands on the real thing.

Purifying Your Drinking Water
Here’s a great bite-sized solar project for the do-it-yourselfer. Not only can
you build a solar water-purification system such as the one in Figure 10-5, but
you can also design it. Designing is just as much fun as building, and it’s more
rewarding because the system’s entirely yours (unless it doesn’t work, of
course — then you need to figure out how to blame somebody else).
The system uses distillation, a process that can remove salts, microorgan-
isms, and even chemicals such as arsenic, leaving you with pure H2O. Here’s
how it works: If you leave salty or contaminated water in an open container,
the water evaporates and leave the contaminants behind. If you heat the
water, the process speeds up considerably.
After the water evaporates, the water vapor condenses on the glass window
and drips down into the catch trough. Tilt the catch trough just slightly and
put a bottle or other container underneath the low end, and voila! Purified
water.
You can make a purification system as cheaply or as expensively as you want.
People in Third World countries use large, efficient versions of this same exact
device that are capable of purifying hundreds of gallons a day. A system the
size of a microwave oven can yield up to 3 gallons of purified water on a sunny
day. Here’s what you need for a basic solar still:
 A wooden (or even better, sheet metal) enclosure as shown in Figure 10-5;
if you want to get imaginative, find a good metal box and cut a hole for the
glaze cover
 Reflective material such as aluminum foil (shiny side out)
 Black paint (the kind used for barbeque pits works best)
 Glass (you don’t need glazed glass; just use plain old window glass if you
like — you can get pieces of discarded glass from window shops for little
more than a smile)
 Insulation (the white foam stuff is cheap, effective, and easy to work with)
 Glue (silicon sealant or similar weather-resistant material)
 A tray that’s black or has some other quality that absorbs heat
163
Chapter 10: Heating and Purifying Water

Now take a look at the assembly:
1. Paint the exterior of the box black to enhance absorption.
2. Install the reflective surface at the back and side walls of the enclosure
and glue the insulation to the bottom.
3. Put a tray of contaminated water inside the enclosure, place the glass
on top, and aim toward the sun.
That’s it — you’re done!
The first few times you use this device, the water may taste a little odd. Let the
system “sweat” for a few weeks, and the bad taste will go away.

When designing or improving your unit, make filling the inner tray with water
convenient. Position it by a hose, for example. Then you don’t have to carry
water to your system. Configure some kind of funnel through the sidewall so
you can pour the water right into the tray without spilling. Make the unit so
you can remove the glazing top and clean out the tray because the contami-
nants are going to remain behind. You’ll get a good idea of how bad your tap
water is when you see what’s left in the tray over a period of time!

A
lmost everyone wants to conserve energy and help reduce greenhouse
gases. Certain energy expenditures, such as driving, heating, and lighting,
are just plain necessary for most people (although you can still reduce them).
Others, including swimming pool heat, are entirely optional creature comforts.
If you adopt the energy conservation tenet, the only real solution is to use solar
energy to heat your pool because it’s the only method that’s completely
pollution-free.
Luckily, swimming pool projects are very accessible for the do-it-yourselfer.
You can spend as little as $200 and as much as $5,000. In this chapter, I show
you how to choose the best system for your needs, and I also present a couple
of fun projects that you can build yourself — and in the process, you can 
discover a lot about solar energy systems.
Warming with Solar Pool Covers
The cheapest and most effective solar-heating system for your swimming pool
is a solar cover. You can get one for around $0.30 a square foot, so covering an
average size pool costs about $130.

Using a plastic cover alone can extend your swim season a couple of months
on each end of the summer. In the Midwest, for example, you may be able to
swim in a completely unheated pool from mid-May until mid-September —
four months. But if you use a cover, you can swim from mid-April until mid-
October. And the water will be more comfortable over the entire season,
which means you’ll use the pool a lot more.
Understanding how covers work
Despite the fact that the surface area of most swimming pools is large, very
little of the sunlight is stored as heat. Pool water is transparent (hopefully),
so it simply passes sunlight right through.
A cover absorbs the sunlight and then transfers that heat to the water. Some
covers are black for this very reason, but the most widely used are made of
inexpensive clear plastic that looks like the bubble wrap used for packing.
These covers are made of a special material designed to store the sunlight as
heat, and air bubbles work as insulation so that the heat becomes trapped in
the pool water.
Covers can do the following:
 Prevent heat from escaping your pool: Retaining heat is especially
important at night, when the air is cooler than the swimming pool. In 
an uncovered pool, you can easily lose 4°F or 5°F in temperature over
the course of a cool night.
 Directly convert solar radiation into usable heat: In an in-ground pool, 
a cover can increase the water temperature by 5°F for each 12 hours of
coverage, and it can increase the temperature by up to 10° when covered
for 20 hours. When you put a pool cover over your pool, you can stick
your hand down underneath it and literally feel the heat.
 Limit evaporation: Each gallon of evaporated 80°F water removes about
8,000 Btus (2.34 kWh) from the pool.
 Reduce chemical depletion: This advantage reduces cost, and you can
consider it a form of energy conservation.
Reviewing operational considerations
You do have to place covers onto the water and then remove them. I freely
admit covers can be a big hassle. You may decide to increase the surface area
of your solar collectors just so you don’t have to deal with a cover. But just
168
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

about everybody who’s ever used a cover can tell you it works. And all kinds
of systems are available for removing and replacing the cover — some manual,
some automatic. In fact, you don’t any system at all; you can just fold them and
unfold them, as needed.
Manual systems cost around $300. These roll up the cover, much like a
window blind. But you still have to pull it back out over the pool, which may
mean you have to get into the water first. In either case, cranking the handle
isn’t easy; people who don’t have much upper body strength may have a
hard time.
Automatic systems can cost more than $1,000, and the installation is a bear.
But all you have to do is press a switch and voila! Back and forth (at least in
theory, because all mechanical systems are prone to failures).
Don’t store a cover in the sunlight when it’s not on the pool. They get really
hot, and the plastic material degrades.
Getting the most out of your pool cover
What’s great is that you don’t need to cover your entire pool to reap the
benefits. Many pools are kidney shaped, but you can float a rectangular cover
over the pool, and it’ll still help considerably.
Use a cover only when you know you won’t be using the pool for a few days
at a time. But when you swim everyday, you can leave it off. You don’t need 
a cover during the hottest months, which is when people want to swim the
most. Just fold it up and store it for the season.
Covers can be dangerous! If a person (particularly a child) falls onto a cover
on a pool, he or she can get wrapped in the cover, which can be very difficult
to get out of. Or if somebody swims under a cover and tries to surface for air,
the swimmer won’t find any. Be careful, and provide appropriate supervision.
Of course, you want to replace the cover when it begins to fray. When plastic
bubble wrap covers get old, plastic shards can get into the filter and may
even cut the filter paper, necessitating a new, expensive filter.
Looking at the Pluses and Minuses 
Using a solar-heating system for your swimming pool makes a lot of sense. For
starters, installation can be very easy — the simplest systems take about an
169
Chapter 11: Diving In to Swimming Pool Projects

hour. You can also design and build systems over a wide range of costs and
complexities, zeroing in on the system that fits your precise needs. Swimming
pools already have pumps and controllers in their filtration systems, so tying 
in solar collector panels with existing equipment is pretty straightforward.
Swimming pool solar collectors are inexpensive because they don’t need to be
glazed, or sealed. Plus they can have a flimsier construction because failures
aren’t dire. You can get very large surface areas for a low price.
On the downside, solar collectors increase the workload of your pool pump,
thereby drawing more electricity to filter the same amount of water. That’s
right — solar panels for your pool are not completely free of energy bills! You
may see them advertised as entirely free, but they’re not.
If your system is properly designed, using solar to heat your pool is a lot
cheaper than other options such as gas heaters, electric heaters, and so on.
But if your system is poorly designed, it can end up costing you more elec-
tricity than what you gain in heat. And a poorly designed system can wear
out expensive pump motors really fast.
Making Your Swimming Pool Efficient
Boosting the efficiency of your swimming pool is an important first step.
Here’s how to make your swimming pool energy efficient so that when you
add solar, you get the most bang for your buck:
 Reduce bends in the piping. Sharp bends in the piping slow down the
flow and require more power to do the same job. Unfortunately, many
pool installers completely fail this simple requirement. If your pipes are
all over the place, rebuild the system — PVC is a cinch to work with.
 Make sure that all valves are working properly. If you have gate valves,
replace them with ball valves, which are more efficient. Make sure that
all ball valves are completely open or closed.
 Keep the filter clean. A dirty filter loads the pump, which costs a lot
more power. If your filter is old, replace it. Cartridge filters are much
better than diatomaceous Earth.
 Install a smaller, higher efficiency pump, and run it less each day. Use
the smallest, most efficient pump possible — 3⁄4 horsepower is usually suf-
ficient. If your pump is a few years old and wasn’t designed with enough
capacity for solar panel use, buying a new one will almost surely be eco-
nomical. Most people will find that they can run their pool pump much
less time than they currently are doing and still achieve satisfactory
cleanliness. Give it a try.
170
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

A large power pump filters your pool water faster, and some people like
that because it means you can run the pump less (which means you listen
to it less). But here’s the problem: If you’re planning on putting up solar
panels, the amount of heat they put into the pool is a function of how
much time water is flowing through them; the quantity of water isn’t as
important. So if you have a large pump that moves water quickly, you’re
not optimizing your solar panels.
 Install windbreaks around your pool. Wind can increase evaporation
300 percent or more, which wastes a lot of energy, much more than you
may think. (For info on using trees and shrubs as windbreaks, see
Chapter 8.)
Understanding a Simple Starter System
Figure 11-1 shows the simplest system possible for heating your swimming
pool using a solar panel. Your pool system already includes the pump, con-
troller, and filter, along with PVC pipes that route the water flow. Simply break
into the PVC line after the filter and run a couple of flex hoses (or PVC, if you
prefer) to the solar collector panel, which you can lay out on the ground or set
against a hill to achieve some angular tilt toward the sun.

Chapter 11: Diving In to Swimming Pool Projects

When the valve is closed, water runs exclusively through the solar collect
or panel, heating the water. As you open the valve, water flows less and less
through the collector panel because the path through the valve is so much
easier. In this way, you can adjust how much heat is going into your pool. 
In the middle of summer, you may not want any additional heat.
Solar collector panels are available at most pool supply stores. You can get 
a 4' x 20' panel for around $220. Flex hoses cost around $15 apiece. Adaptors
are sometimes necessary.
Here are some ways to run the system for best results:
 Place the solar collector panel where it sees the most sunlight when
the pool pump is running. If you’re not running the pump in the late
afternoon, don’t worry if the collector is shaded at that time. You may
need to adjust the pump run time to match sunlight conditions.
 If you place the solar collector panel on your roof, try to minimize resis-
tance to the water flow. Roof-mounted collectors may work better, but
the piping runs may be more complex, and you’re increasing the workload
of your pump. If you use PVC, minimize tight angles and use 2"-diameter
pipe.
 Keep the solar panel out of the wind as much as possible. Wind causes
convection cooling, which results in less heating of the water. However,
remember that placing the panel in the sun is more important than 
keeping it out of the wind.
 For best heating results, run the pool pump during the sunniest time of
the day; running it longer will result in more heat in the pool. However,
in the middle of the summer, your pool may actually get too hot if you run
your pump during sunshine hours with a solar collector in line; run the
pump at night instead.
 Account for whether you’re using a pool cover. If you use a pool cover
(see the preceding section) in conjunction with the solar panel, you can
raise the temperature up to 15°F. Without a cover, use about 50 percent
more surface area in your collectors to achieve the same temperature
gains (assuming, of course, that your collectors are in sunlight).
 If you want to use two or more solar collector panels, connect them in
parallel. Flexible solar collector panels that are designed to fit together
in a parallel “ganged” arrangement, as shown in Figure 11-2, are available.
(For an explanation of series and parallel, see Chapter 4.)
Parallel-ganged solar collectors are the type you commonly see on roofs.
You can put as many of them together as you want. The more you use, the
easier the pump’s job is and the more heat you collect. A good number of
new configurations claim higher efficiency.
172
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Deciding on the Size of Your Collectors
The general rule is to use a total collector surface area that’s about half the
surface area of your pool. But this varies quite a bit. Sizing your collector 
surface area depends on a number of factors:
 The pump’s running time: The longer it’s on, the more heat you collect
in the pool for a given collector size. So you can use less collector size if
you run the pump longer (up to a point; you still need sunlight, and if you
run the collectors for too long, the sunlight won’t be available). Running
more water faster through the collectors doesn’t do any good.
 Pool location: If you have an aboveground pool, the heat loss is much
greater. You need a collector with more surface area.
 Solar potential when the pump is on: Note how your solar panels 
are oriented. How much sunlight do you get? Many roofs aren’t oriented
south, so collectors mounted flush aren’t working as efficiently as they
could be (see Chapter 5). Hazy days don’t get much radiation, either. In
those cases, you need more surface area. For example, in Seattle you will
need more surface area than in Phoenix.
 Shade: If you have shade problems, you can solve these, but you may
not want to. Cutting down Old Man Oak isn’t much of an option if your
blood is truly green. Otherwise, choose a larger collector.

Chapter 11: Diving In to Swimming Pool Projects

 Wind: If you have a lot of wind, your collectors will run inefficiently. Not
so with glazed collectors, but the open ICS collectors (see Chapter 10)
used for swimming pools are very sensitive to wind. So if you’re in a windy
climate, increase your collector size or increase the pump time per day.
Installing a Complete System
Swimming pools cost a lot, upwards of $30,000. If you don’t have any kind of
swimming pool heater, your useable season may be around four months of
the year. If you install a swimming pool heating system, you can get eight
months. This explains the popularity of pool heaters.
Figure 11-3 shows a diagram of an entire full-scale, professional-grade, swim-
ming pool solar system. When the pump is on, the controller decides whether
to activate the solar collectors by measuring the temperature at the collectors
and the temperature of the pool water. When heat’s available at the collector,
the motor valve opens, and the pump moves water up into the collectors and
back down to the swimming pool.
Here are the operational details concerning the valves:
 When the controller deactivates the motor valve and no longer allows
water to pump into the collectors, the vacuum breaker allows the
system to purge itself of liquid for two reasons:
• You don’t want water in the collectors at night because it cools
down; when you first activate the collectors the next day, you’ll
dump a bunch of cool water into your pool, which is at odds with
the goal.
• Purging the water ensures it won’t freeze up and burst the pipes 
or collector.
 The check valve prevents water from flowing backwards through the
pump and filter.
 You use the manual valves to deactivate the system and purge the pipes
in off seasons or during maintenance.
People almost always mount the solar collectors on the roof. The collectors
need to have a slight downward tilt to facilitate draining. Make sure that you
don’t injure the roof and cause leaks.
If you put your solar panels on your roof, keep in mind that your pump will
have to force water up to the height of the solar panels. Some pumps may be
unable to do this if the panels are much higher than the pool. Find out what
specs apply to your pump. The appropriate specification is called head pres-
sure, and it’s given in terms of feet. To be safe, measure from the surface of
the pool to the top of the collector and add 4'.
174
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Piping is almost always 2" PVC. Keep 90° bends to a minimum because they
increase the resistance to water flow, which makes the pump work harder.
You can design your system for future expansion so that you can change indi-
vidual parts whenever you want. That way, you can experiment with operating
parameters without worrying about blowing something up or causing damage
to your house. The worst you can accomplish is a flooded roof or backyard —
or maybe a bruised ego.
Creating a Simple Homemade System
A simple homemade solar pool-heating system, as shown in Figure 11-4, 
performs ideally, and you can build it entirely on your own. You lower the
submersible pump into the pool water so it’ll always be primed. The pump
runs off the 12VDC that the PV module supplies. The amount of water the

pump passes through the solar collector panel depends entirely on how much
sunlight is incident on the PV module: At night, the pump doesn’t run at all. On
cloudy days, the pump runs slowly. When it’s sunniest, the pump is cranking
full speed.
Because the heating system pump is separate from your filter pump, you can
run your pool filter pump for only two hours a day without having any effect
on how much heat you get from your collectors. In some locales, the power
rates are much different during day and night; you want to run your filter
pump at night, but you need to run your solar collectors during the day. 
With this system, you solve that problem.
A solar PV panel to power the pump costs about $130, and a pump costs
around $40, for a total of $170. You keep your power bill for the pool pump to
a bare minimum, perhaps saving you enough in one season to pay for all the
parts of your new system.
You need to get a submersible pump with enough head pressure to raise the
water up to the height of your collector. To determine ideal head pressure,
measure the vertical distance from the water surface to the collector and 
add 4'.
If you put the collector on the ground, almost any pump will do the job. If you
can put the collector below the surface of the pool, you can get help from
siphon physics.

You also need wiring, a solar collector, piping, and a PV module. A 12VDC
panel should be strong enough to power your pump.
Making Your Own Collector
This project has you make your own collector out of black, plastic landscape
tubing. If your collector gets broken, you can fix your collector in a jiffy, which
can’t be said for commercially available collectors. Combine your collector
with a PV-driven submersible pump system (see the preceding section), and
you can have a very effective solar pool-heating system for a very cheap price.
And you can do it all yourself!
First, gather your tools and materials:
 Black, plastic landscape tubing: For $30, you can get a 1,000' roll of 1⁄4"
tubing, which yields around 21 square feet of collector.
 Junctions: When you buy the tubing, get junctions that fit the tubing.
You’ll need to go from the tubing to an interface for the pump, and
because there are so many different kinds of pumps, you’re on your own.
 Mounting hardware: Where are you going to locate your collector? If on a
roof, think through how you’re going to mount it so that wind and weather
won’t cause problems. Once again, you will need to get creative here.
Here’s how to put it all together:
1. Cut appropriate lengths of black, plastic landscape tubing.
If you make the lengths really long, like 100 feet, the water can get down-
right hot at the end of the tube. You’re better off making parallel tracks
and keeping the lengths shorter.
Use narrow-diameter tubing because it transfers heat from the tubing 
to the water better than big-diameter tubing.
2. Arrange the tubes and make connections.
You can find all kinds of Ts and junctions in the landscaping department
at your hardware store. Putting these systems together is fun; they’re like
building blocks. You can do it any number of ways and you’ll end up with
a working collector.
3. Turn the pump on.
If you’ve got enough head pressure, the air will be forced out of the tubes
(you’ll see a lot of bubbles coming out for a while). The water coming out
should be warm.

Chapter 11: Diving In to Swimming Pool Projects

String your collector out any way you want (as long as it’s in the sun). You
can loop it around your backyard, over fences, or on groundcover, gravel, or
concrete. You can string it across your backyard and then up to your roof
where you can run it back and forth. If you put it on concrete, you can collect
a lot of heat from reflection and conduction (for more on heat transfer, see
Chapter 4).

eating water for your home comprises anywhere from 17 to 28 percent
of your power bill, and most hot water goes right down the proverbial
drain. From washing dishes and clothes, to taking baths and showers, to
cooking food and warming your pool water, the range of activities that
requires hot water is extensive.
An electric water heater supplying a family of four uses 11.4 barrels of oil per
year. That’s more oil than that consumed by a medium-sized auto driven 12,000
miles per year, at 22 mpg, which uses only 11.1 barrels. When you install a solar
water heater to supplement your domestic water supply, you’re producing all
the energy on site, in your collectors. There’s no pollution at all.
In this chapter, I run through some of your options for supplementing your
domestic water heater with solar power. I discuss the various systems, explain
installation, and even talk a bit about warming your house with radiant heat.
(For details on the basics of solar water heating, including info on solar
collectors and other components, see Chapter 10.)

Looking at the Various Systems
A wide range of supplemental water-heating systems are on the market, but
only three — which I discuss in the next section — have stood the test of
time. You can install any of them yourself, although you may not want to.
Even if you intend to have a pro do the installation, make sure that you
understand the various alternatives in order to make the best decision on
which system you want. You also need to understand your system in order to
get the most out of it. In this section, I explain your options and some of the
factors that should go into your final selection.
Highlighting the most popular systems
Literally dozens of different types of systems are available, but only a few 
have stood the test of time. Sticking with proven entities is always a good idea,
despite the extravagant claims you may hear regarding new technologies. In
the real world, Murphy has a voracious appetite, and until something is tested
thoroughly, the jury is still out.
The integral collector system (ICS)
ICS is the simplest and cheapest system, and it’s ideal for mild climates. But 
it also has the most potential for freezing damage because the collector holds
the water being heated. Big batch collectors, however, can withstand longer
freezing conditions than less bulky systems.
180
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 
Tapping into your hot water supply
Hot water storage is never perfect. At night, all
storage tanks lose heat, resulting in inefficiency.
So the best time to use hot water is right after
your storage tank has been charged up — in
other words, afternoon. This is less true if your
storage tank is very well insulated.
By changing some habits, you can literally
reduce the energy workload on your conven-
tional water heater to zero. For example, if each
member of the family takes a shower at a differ-
ent time of the day, a batch collector can heat up
again between showers. If you take your shower
in the afternoon, after the tank has been heating
up during the midday sun, your residential heater
has to do very little work. You can run your dish-
washer or wash clothes in the late afternoon
instead of the morning. The list goes on — use
your imagination. Avoid using hot water first
thing in the morning as much as possible.
In the winter months, when you’re getting very
little solar energy, the timing of when you use hot
water doesn’t matter as much because it almost
all comes from your electric or gas heater.

These systems are passive (they don’t have internal pumps) and are normally
plumbed directly between the cold water supply and the water heater, making 
the plumbing job easy and straightforward. Whenever someone opens a
tap in the house, water flows from the collector into the water heater. If the
water in the collector is hot enough, the domestic water heater doesn’t need to
add any heat at all.
All ICS systems need to be drained of water when in danger of freezing. The
systems use manual or automatic valves. A burst collector costs a lot of money
to fix. They’re big and bulky, and you may end up having to send them back to
the factory. But they’re cheap and easy to use and install, which is why they’re
so common. You just need to understand the operational drawbacks if you’re
going to successfully utilize one.
Drainback systems
Drainback systems (direct, ICS) do exactly that: They drain the fluid out of 
the collector and exposed pipes when no sunlight’s available — at night, for
example — or when there’s no more need to heat the domestic water because
it’s already at temperature. These systems use a special tank for holding the
drained fluid. These types of systems are medium on the cost scale and can
be used in cold climates. There is less risk of bursting pipes than a conven-
tional ICS system, but more risk than a closed-loop antifreeze system (see the
next section).
Closed-loop antifreeze systems
Closed-loop antifreeze systems use fluids other than water to collect the
heat; then a heat exchanger transfers that heat into the domestic water
supply. These systems are far and away the most widely distributed type sys-
tems in the world because they work in almost any climate. They’re the most
expensive as well.
These systems aren’t entirely free of problems. The antifreeze solution breaks
down when the weather gets really hot and then turns corrosive. These types
of systems require service, and owners need to stay on their toes in order to
prevent big problems.
Skimming through the lesser systems
A few other systems deserve mention as well. However, these don’t warrant 
a top recommendation because they’re applicable to specific conditions. If you
want to understand the technology, it’s worth reviewing these systems. If you
buy a house with a system already installed, you may encounter one of these
systems:
181
Chapter 12: Supplementing Your Domestic Water Heater

 Recirculation systems: These systems use a temperature sensor to
determine freezing dangers; in cold temperatures, a pump starts recircu-
lating water through the exposed collector and pipes. Water in motion 
is extremely difficult to freeze, so the water in the system can be below
freezing without actually becoming solid. This works most of the time,
but not all. And when in recirculation mode, the system loses a lot of
heat, which is the opposite of what you’re trying to do in the first place.
Avoid these systems. They don’t offer enough pros to offset the loss of
efficiency.
 Thermosiphon systems: Thermosiphon systems work well in theory, but
you need to mount the storage tank above the collector (at a higher eleva-
tion, because hot water rises). You see these in Third World countries
with moderate climates because they’re very cheap and easy and reliable.
Some ICS systems also use the thermosiphon effect to good advantage.
 Open-loop flooded systems: These systems are similar in nature to ICS
systems, but they use a flat-plate collector and a storage tank. They don’t
really offer any advantages over an ICS system, and they freeze up faster
and tend to clog faster as well. Avoid them.
Considering factors that dictate 
the type of system
Several operational factors dictate the type of system that will work best for
your particular application:
 Freezing weather: The most important factor in determining the best
system for your needs is your climate — in particular, the likelihood of
freezing. Water expands when it freezes, and almost everybody who lives
in cold climates knows about burst pipes.
Copper is the piping of choice for domestic water heater systems because
it ages well, works over a wide temperature range, is easy to work with,
and withstands hard water. But a well-insulated 3⁄4" copper pipe full of
water freezes in less than five hours at 29°F. A burst pipe is a greater
danger in most systems than collector damage.
If you live in freezing conditions, consider a closed-loop antifreeze
system. If freezing is occasional, you can use any system you want, as
long as you purge the system of water before freezing conditions occur.
Design your system with appropriate drain valves, in easily accessible
locations.
 Potential high-temperature conditions: Too much heat can be every 
bit as damaging as too much cold. ICS collectors may burst if the water
inside boils. Antifreeze systems won’t suffer this problem. If you have
any other type of system, and the weather gets real hot, just slightly
open a hot water faucet anywhere in the house, and fresh, cool water
182
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

will constantly feed through your collector. Don’t worry about wasting
energy; you’re not paying for the wasted hot water, and it’s not costing
any pollution. In fact, you can store hot water in your bathtub for later
use, if you want. Just add more hot water at that time, if you need to.
 Quantity of hot water produced: The average household uses around
10,000 to 15,000 Btus per person per day. Collectors are rated in terms of
how many Btus per day they generate, given average conditions. Realize
that your hot water output varies over the seasons and weather condi-
tions. Install a system that’s smaller than you need as opposed to larger.
Extra capacity is just wasted money.
 Purity of your water supply: Mineral buildup can decrease the efficiency
of your system. Try an experiment: Pour water into a clean container and
then let the water evaporate. Repeat this a good number of times, say 20.
Is there a white residue? Any kind of residue? Now imagine exposing your
solar collector to this. Over the course of a year, you build up much more
than what you can see in your container.
You may want to consider a water softener. If you have one, you definitely
want to run the water through the water softener before it gets to your
solar system. And you may want to consider installing an even more
extensive water purification system. The subject is beyond the scope of
this book, but you can research the details over the Internet. Check out
www.realgoods.com.

The type of domestic water heater you already have in your house can dictate
what type of solar water heater you install. If your domestic water heater is
nice and new, find a solar system that supplements it. If you’re ready for a
change of domestic heater, combine the decision on which type with the
decision on a new solar system. Integrated systems work better.

Chapter 12: Supplementing Your Domestic Water Heater

Following Good Advice (Mine)
Regardless of whether you decide to install a system yourself or have a con-
tractor do the job, there are some definite tips you will want to keep in mind.
I highly recommend that you try to check out a real, live system of the type you
decide on. Will the neighbors let you look at theirs? Ask your potential supplier
for references and then find out whether you can go look at the system and ask
the owners what they think. Here are some of my recommendations:
 Opt for a complete system — it works the best. Mismatched components
reduce efficiency and may even void warranties.
Make sure the system includes monitoring devices. Temperature gauges
and flow meters indicate proper operation and let you know when the
system needs servicing.
 Seek out quality parts. Quality parts mean fewer service calls. Reputation
is critical. Look at consumer Web sites and ask around, and review the
owner’s manual before you buy. Does the manual make sense? Is it easy to
read? Is it logical? If you get a bad feeling about the manual, cut and run.
 Pay attention to contractor quality — it’s a big factor. Too many cheap
jobs end up being expensive. The number-one failure mode of all solar
water systems is faulty installation.
Check whether the manufacturer and installer are affiliated with the Solar
Energy Industries Association (SEIA). With all the buzz over solar these
days, all kinds of unskilled, unsavory folks are getting into the business.
Use your common sense; if it’s too good to be true, it surely is.
 Understand the contract terms. Every contract specifies the equipment
to be installed, but you also want to know what sort of specification per-
formance is guaranteed. Remember — you’re buying a performance
package, not a bunch of hardware.
 Know who’s liable. Figure out who’s providing the warranty — the con-
tractor or the manufacturer. Ask whether the contractor is warranting the
installation. Figure out who’s going to pay for collateral damage and what
happens if a faulty system wreaks havoc inside your house. Know who’s
liable if a contractor falls off your roof. Check with your homeowners’
insurance to see whether you’re covered for problems such as freezing
damage. Will your insurance go up? What are the deductibles for
mishaps?
 Look out for red tape. Find out whether you need a county building
permit or inspections.
184
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 Decide how you want to establish that the contract is completed prop-
erly. If you pay cash after the hardware is installed, what assurance do
you have that your system is going to operate according to the contract
specification? What if it doesn’t? What if your energy savings are nowhere
near what they should be? This can become a nasty blame game, espe-
cially if you haven’t thought it out beforehand. Make sure that you and the
contractor have a specific way to measure system performance and then
get that method into the contract.
 If you’re going to sell your house, find out what sort of documentation
you need to pass along to the new buyers. Are they expecting a home
warranty? Will a home-warranty company cover your solar addition?
Heating Things Up in Your Old Hot Tub
The old style hot tubs are notoriously inefficient because they lack insulation.
The biggest energy consumption with a hot tub occurs when the pump is run-
ning and the cover is off. When you’re using your bubble generator, the water
is cooling very quickly as well. Hot tubs can use over 10 kWh when they’re
cranking away at full speed. That’s mucho grande, maybe the champion in 
your entire household.
If you have a hot tub, the best bet for keeping it that way is to use the system
shown in Figure 12-1.
You need a collector that can achieve over 105°F water temperatures — this
implies a flat panel or some other insulated collector. A temperature probe is
located in the collector fluid, another in the hot tub itself. The delta controller
(delta, in engineering parlance, means difference) decides when to open the
valves and run the pump.
Note that a big difference between this system and most others is that you’re
not interested in storing the most amount of heat for later use; you only need
to keep the hot-tub water regulated at a specific temperature. Too hot is just
as bad as too cold. Therefore, this system is inherently inefficient because
you’ll rarely be using it to its utmost capacity. In a way, this is kind of a
shame.
These systems are expensive, on the order of $1,500 for equipment and
another $500 for installation. Because you can buy a nice new, very efficient
hot tub for around $4,000, you may want to consider doing that instead.
185
Chapter 12: Supplementing Your Domestic Water Heater

Installing an ICS Batch System 
for Mild Climates
If you live in a mild climate, you can install a simple ICS system because you
don’t have to worry about freezing conditions and super hot conditions. Even
if these conditions are rare, you can still install an ICS, if you take a few 
precautions.
Figure 12-2 shows a simple and effective system for preheating the water that
goes to your existing domestic water heater. Over the course of a sunny day,
the water in the collector heats up from solar radiation. Due to the insulation,
heat doesn’t exit the system anywhere nearly as quickly as it enters. Because
of the thermosiphon effect, hotter water migrates to the upper copper tube
(even when no water flows, the heat will flow) so that the water that ulti-
mately flows down into your water heater tank (when a faucet is opened in
the house) is the hottest water from the collector.
Whenever somebody opens a hot water tap in your house, that much water 
is pumped through the collector, into your domestic hot water tank.
Collectors heat the water directly, so they’re a significant part of ICS. Figure
12-3 shows two different versions of typical solar collectors. The collector on
the right-hand side shows the more common arrangement. It offers some dis-
tinct advantages. The large diameter, black finished, copper tubes beneath

the glazed cover (and insulated from the frame) are connected in series so
that water flows from the bottom to the top (such collectors are mounted at
an angle). Each of the copper tubes can typically hold 10 gallons of water.
A 3' x 8'–unit holds 30 gallons of water and collects about 22,000 Btus for an
average North American day. Cost is around $1,500 for the collector, about
$2,200 if you add in the cost for pipes, installation hardware, and labor for
installation. Larger units are also available: A 4' x 8'–unit holds 50 gallons of
water and can collect 30,000 Btus per day. Cost is around $1,700, plus installa-
tion. Or you can expand to two batch collectors by plumbing them in series,
but you need to mount the second system physically above the first in order
to get a proper thermosiphon effect.

Chapter 12: Supplementing Your Domestic Water Heater

Complete kits include all the valves, plus the collector and its associated
mounting hardware. If you do opt to do it yourself, give some serious consider-
ation to how you’ll lift the collector (even empty, they weight a lot) wherever
you plan on mounting it. The collector can weigh upwards of 500 pounds when
full of water (which means the units can withstand winds of up to 180 mph!).
Make sure that your roof can take this weight. You don’t want to find out the
hard way that it can’t.
If you mount heavy collectors close to the edge of your roof, the rafter load
will be easier to handle because the load will be directly over a load-bearing
wall. And if you mount one of these collectors right near your water heater,
you can use as little as 8 feet of tubing to complete the system.
Here are some considerations to keep in mind concerning the valves:
 Draining the system: Valves drain the water when freezing is a possibility
for more than a day or so. Note the bypass valves, which allow water to
bypass the solar collector and revert to normal, hot water tank operation.
The valves may be controlled either automatically or manually.
Heat is a problem as well. These collectors can burst if the water gets 
too hot, so drain the system when experiencing extremely hot, sunny con-
ditions. Or turn a hot water faucet on in the house (just a little will do) to
be on the safe side. If you don’t have a temperature probe in the water line
up at the collector, you aren’t able to tell how hot the water is. When in
doubt, drain the system. Consult the user’s manual for your collector to
get some advice on when this is appropriate.
 Locating the drain valves: Make sure to locate the drain valves where
children won’t open them up and get scalded. For safe drainage, locate
the drain valves outside; they may look exactly like a hose faucet. You
may want to consider some kind of locking valve that requires a key to
open.
 Controlling water temperature with a tempering valve: The tempering
valve is critical. It mixes cold water with the heated water from the collec-
tor when the collector water exceeds a certain temperature. This prevents
scalding water from entering your household plumbing system. Always
use a tempering valve in your system and never buy a cheap one.
 Testing water temperature: You can always find out how hot the water
in the collector is by sampling from the downstream drain valve. Learn
your system performance, and you’ll be rewarded.
188

Installing a Drainback System 
for Most Climates
Indirect, active, closed-loop drainback systems, shown in Figure 12-4, are an
excellent choice for most climates — except those that receive a lot of snow
and get really cold. They’re the best choice in hot climates, though they’re
much more expensive to install than ICS. The advantage is that you have no
freezing danger. (See the earlier sections on system types.)
The controller reads two temperature sensors and then determines when to
pump fluid through the collector. When the pump is off, the fluid in the collec-
tor and feeder pipes drains back into the drainback tank. (This requires that
the collector be mounted higher than the drainback tank, which may be a prob-
lem in some applications.) Fluids other than water work in the closed-loop heat
exchanger circuit; however, water’s best because it doesn’t degrade when it
gets hot.
Most manufacturers offer complete kits for these systems, so you don’t need
to calculate the system parameters. These kits work very well; I highly 
recommend you stick with the plan.

Chapter 12: Supplementing Your Domestic Water Heater

Here are some installation considerations to keep in mind:
 Raising the liquid up to the collectors sometimes takes a lot of force, so
your pump must have sufficient head pressure. (Measure head pressure
by the difference in the vertical height of your collector, and the location
of the heat exchanger tank.) You can use a PV cell, but this is sometimes
inadequate because there may not be enough sunlight to yield enough
power. On the other hand, if there’s not enough sunlight to run the pump,
there’s probably not enough sunlight to provide meaningful heat. PV
power generally works well because you can forego the need for a con-
troller; when there’s enough sun for heat, there’s enough sun for electrical
pumping.
 Installation must ensure the closed-loop system drains quickly and 
completely. Locate drainback tanks as high as possible but low enough to
ensure the entire weather-exposed parts will drain back. The less distance
between the drainback tank and the collector, the less head pressure the
filter needs, which means less power.
 Pipes should never be horizontal, so ensure a minimum of 15° slope.
Because purified water is best for the closed-loop system, these systems
are prone to freezing. When mounting the pipes, making sure they all have
a slope so that they’ll drain by force of gravity is critical. Sometimes pipes
sag, and the low points retain some water, which can cause the pipes to
burst in a freeze. The collector must be mounted so that it, too, will drain
completely.
 Don’t use 90° bends. Instead, use two 45° bends staggered apart.
 Larger diameter copper pipe works best. Use a minimum of 3⁄4".
Installing an All-Weather, Closed-
Loop Antifreeze System
Closed-loop, active, antifreeze systems are the most versatile and failsafe of
all the systems. Most new solar homes features a variation of one kind or
another (see Figure 12-5).
A special water-heater tank incorporating a heat exchanger works in conjunc-
tion with one or more flat-plate, roof-mounted collectors (see Chapter 10 for
details on flat-plate collectors). Glycol, or some equivalent antifreeze fluid,
fills the collector and associated routing pipes. A controller measures the
temperature in the collector fluid, as well as the temperature in the hot water
tank. When heat’s available for transfer, pumps are activated to move the col-
lector fluid. The hot water heater tank also has a backup means for indepen-
dent heating, either gas or electric.
190
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

The flat-plate collectors can be mounted in almost any configuration, at great
distances from the exchanger. The closed loop is always full of fluid, so the
pump pressure requirements are much easier than those for a drainback
system.
The pump can be very small, with very little head pressure, which means you
can opt for lower power and better efficiency. Running these types of pumps
off a PV panel is practical, which increases efficiency even more. (At night,
when no sunlight can power the PV panel, there’s no hot water to be pumped
anyway, so it’s a good match.)
You can get complete kits. Installation of the parts is no more difficult than
for other systems, but charging the closed-loop isn’t straightforward, and
doing it incorrectly can damage the system and give you inefficient perfor-
mance. I recommend that you don’t install one of these systems yourself,
even if you’re a skilled do-it-yourselfer.
The major limitation of these systems is the tendency of the antifreeze fluid to
degrade over time. When the fluid gets really hot (it’s always in the collector,
at all times) it degrades very quickly, resulting in inefficiency and buildup of
deposits on the interior walls of the pipes and collector. For a properly main-
tained system, you should need to change the antifreeze fluid only every ten
years. Have a qualified serviceperson inject new fluid into the system — it
has to be done just right.

The best way to prevent the fluid from overheating is to make sure that the
fluid in the closed-loop is circulating at all times when it’s sunny out. Therefore,
you can get really hot water in your domestic tank, and a tempering valve is
critical. You need to use copper pipe — it’s the only material that can with-
stand very high temperatures.
Make sure that the copper pipe is well insulated wherever children may
touch it. The pipe can get extremely hot.
Taking a Quick Peek at Radiant 
Heat Floor Systems
Installing a radiant heat floor system (see Figure 12-6) is almost surely not a
do-it-yourself project, but it merits elaboration because it’s such a complete
and effective way to use solar energy water heating. A snaking closed loop of
plastic tubing runs beneath your floor. When hot water flows through the
tubing, the heat radiates upward through the floor and into the room.
You can use solar heated water to literally heat your home off-grid. Radiant
heat, without solar, costs much less than forced-air heating for efficiency 
reasons. But when you supplement your radiant heat system with a solar
water heater, you can drive your heating costs down to nearly nothing. Of
course, sunshine isn’t very reliable, particularly on the coldest nights when
you most need heat, so you can’t use solar heating exclusively; it can only be 
a supplement. But it can be very effective.
You can use any type of water heating system with a radiant floor system, but
the capacity of hot water that you use goes up dramatically with a radiant heat
floor system. So the attraction of a solar system also goes up dramatically,
because you get much cheaper hot water per gallon.
At the very least, radiant heating reduces your carbon footprint. When you
combine it with solar, the pollution savings can be impressive.
The engineering is complex, and the installation is clearly not for the faint of
heart. There are technical problems, of course, but the systems have been in
use for a long, long time. New technologies are making these the system of
choice for a lot of homes.
Here’s why: With conventional forced-air systems, hot air comes in through
the vents and immediately rises to the ceiling. That’s not where you want it,
so you need to either pump in more heat than you really need (inefficiency)
or use overhead fans to move the air back down (inefficiency). Moving air
makes you feel colder, and you get stuck listening to blower noise as a big
machine goes on and off all night. Furthermore, heated air dries out very fast,
so your lips dry up, and your skin gets tight.
192
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

With radiant floors, the heat starts at ground level and rises naturally, which 
is much more efficient. There’s no blower noise, wind chill is nonexistent, and
you don’t have to mess with HVAC filters. The big benefit is that the heat is in
the room — the floor and furniture — not just the air. You can adjust your ther-
mostat to a lower temperature in a radiant house and achieve the same com-
fort level because the floor and furniture are where the heat is. Where you set
the thermostat is a question of comfort, not numerical temperature.
The floor of your house gets nice and warm. You can use hardwood floors or
tile and slate, and the floor never feels cold. You can go barefoot in the middle
of winter, and you don’t end up hopping around looking for your slippers.
If you’re planning on a room addition to your house, consider using a radiant
floor in that room. Your existing HVAC system likely won’t have enough capacity
to heat an additional room. Adding a solar water heater to your house and
using your domestic heater to heat the radiant floor in the addition works
wonders, and it’s much cheaper than adding another small HVAC system.
You can also cool your house with radiant flooring. It doesn’t work quite as
well as heating, but if you have solar panels, you can use these at night to cool
the water that’s already in the closed loop of the radiant floor system. The
reason the collectors will cool is simply because they have so much area, and
the heat will escape into the cool, nighttime air. This is especially true if 
a breeze is blowing.

Chapter 12: Supplementing Your Domestic Water Heater

A geothermal system in conjunction with radiant heat is also an excellent
way to go. Geothermal is a system of wells drilled into the ground; water is
run through the wells, and the inherent warmth of the earth’s interior is used
in a heat exchanger. In general, geothermal systems work best in climates
that are both very hot in the summer and cold in the winter.

 Building a solar-powered space heater
U
nless you live in a perfect climate, heating and air conditioning 
make up the largest component of your power bill. Ultimately, what
you’re buying is nothing more than comfort, because you don’t need air condi-
tioning — and most of the time, you don’t need heat. But comfort comes from
more than just air temperature. Humidity is a factor, and moving air feels much
different than static air at the same temperature. By moving air appropriately
through your house, you can achieve a higher level of comfort — and save
money by using your heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system
less, particularly in the summer.
Note: In order to gain the most advantage in moving air, you need to first
manage solar heat entry into your house. Chapter 9 addresses sunscreens,
window blinds, awnings, and other shading methods. Chapter 8 shows meth-
ods for planting trees and bushes around your house to optimize breezes and
shading. Chapter 16 shows how to build greenhouses and solar rooms to 
control air temperatures in your house.
Capitalizing on Natural Ventilation 
Each house has a natural ventilation scheme that results from weather pat-
terns, physics, and the layout of the house. You need to understand the nat-
ural ventilation scheme in your own house before you decide how to optimize
air movement by using active fans or passive effects. Active methods include
ceiling fans, whole house fans, attic fans, and so on. (I get into fan types in the
upcoming “Choosing and Using Your Number-One Fans” section.) Passive
methods take advantage of heat rising and cooler air settling.

Writing a general prescription for moving air is impossible because house 
layouts are so different. But in this section, you find out about passive methods
(with a little active assistance) that you can tailor to your own floor plan. By
exploiting both the chimney effect and prevailing winds, you can passively cool
your house well enough to preclude air conditioning on all but the hottest
days. The following sections explain how these phenomena work, how you can
exploit them to get the best cooling effect, and how to adjust your strategy as
the seasons change.
The most efficient ways to move air always complement the natural ventila-
tion scheme and never work against it.
Catering to the prevailing winds
Prevailing winds are the most common wind speed and direction in your area.
Typically, prevailing winds come from the southwest in the summer and the
northwest in the winter. Some areas have very consistent prevailing winds, but
other areas experience changes almost daily. You may already have a good idea
what the prevailing wind is at your house, but you can refine your understand-
ing by keeping a log — say once a day for a month (and then one month out of
each season, because prevailing winds do vary over the year). In particular,
how does the prevailing wind at your house change over the course of a day?
Over the seasons?
Prevailing winds dictate the arrangement of fans and window openings that
work best in your house. You want to create a kind of mini wind tunnel so that
the air follows its natural path, coming in through one window and blowing out
the one across from it without getting sidetracked. Here’s a typical situation
(refer to Figure 13-1):

 If all four windows are closed, you get no breeze in the house.
 If only one of the windows is opened, very little air movement occurs 
in the house.
 If windows 2 and 4 are opened while 1 and 3 are closed, very little air
movement occurs because the two open windows are at around the
same air pressure.
 If windows 1 and 3 are both open, a good breeze moves through the
house.
 If all four windows are open, you get good air movement.
With windows 1 and 3 open, aiming a fan out window 3 enhances the natural
scheme. However, if you mount a window fan aiming into the house at window
3, it works directly against the natural ventilation scheme. You may end up
with no air movement at all (see Figure 13-2).

Chapter 13: Breezeway: Directing Wind within Your House

The prevailing winds blow toward window 1, so a fan at window 1 should
blow into the room. If you set a fan in the middle of the room with windows 
1 and 3 open, with the fan facing window 3, you enhance the natural scheme,
but not nearly as efficiently as when the fan is right in the window.
Consider the different situations outside of the windows. For example, if a
particular window has a nice big tree overhead with lawn directly outside, air
being drawn into the house through that window is cooler than that from a
window situated over concrete in the direct sunshine. In Figure 13-2, a big
tree over window 1 works the best.
Letting the heat rise: Chimney effect
Chimney effect describes how hot air rises. In a closed room, the temperature
at the ceiling is always higher than that on the floor because hot air is less
dense than cold air (hot weighs less than cold). The difference in air tempera-
ture can be more than 15°F. You can achieve cooling, without any prevailing
breezes at all, by arranging vents in your house so the heat can escape in a
fairly direct path. Note that the openings are at different heights, which is
key. Figure 13-3 shows a possible arrangement.
Always work with the natural ventilation scheme, never against. For example,
if you install a whole house fan in the attic vent, as shown in the figure, you
need to direct the air up, into the attic, never back down into the house. (For
more info, see the later sections titled “Whole house fans” and “Installing a
Solar Attic Vent Fan.”)

Many different types of vents allow you to take advantage of the chimney
effect. Add some of the vents in the following list if you see the need 
(see Figure 13-4):
 Ridge vent
 Roof vent
 Gable vent
 Soffit vent

Developing a strategy to 
optimize air movements
To lay out your air-movement strategy, first draw a rough floor plan of your
house, marking all the windows, doors, skylights, vents, fans, and so on. Draw
your attic, with all the vents and openings. Then, using what you know about
prevailing winds, try figure out what the natural ventilation scheme is for
both inside the house and the attic.

Chapter 13: Breezeway: Directing Wind within Your House

On paper, experiment with different combinations of doors and windows and
vents to determine how best to achieve comfort without using fans and other
active devices. Then imagine using fans to forcibly move air. Where would one
single fan work the best in conjunction with windows and doors? How big does
that one fan need to be? One small fan in the right location can easily produce
more comfort than a huge fan in the wrong spot.
Make sure that you follow some general ventilation rules:
 To increase the speed of the breezes, use smaller openings for the inlets
and larger openings for the outlets.
 Make the air move over as long a path as possible. Windows a few feet
apart don’t do much. Opening all the windows at the same time doesn’t
do much, either.
 Hot air rises, so locate an attic vent at the highest part of your attic.
 Try to draw in air from cooler outside areas, but note that doing so may
not be practical due to prevailing winds.
 Don’t open or close all windows at the same time; optimizing your
breezes takes a strategy that ultimately boils down to trial and error.
 Determine a daily routine. What works best in the morning is rarely 
what works best in the afternoon or at night.
Dealing with seasonal variations
Requirements in winter are usually diametrically opposed to those in the
summer, which makes the strategizing trickier. In the winter, you want to retain
heat as much as possible, whereas in the summer, you want to get rid of heat.
Most houses are designed to optimize one season only, which creates prob-
lems during the other seasons. You need some means of opening or closing
vents to optimize for both winter and summer.
Consider the following scenarios as you play around with your house layout
drawing in search of the best solutions.
 Summer: In the summer, dehumidifiers work well in conjunction with
fans, window blinds, and air-movement techniques. Without the air con-
ditioning on, you can open and close windows and vents at will. You want
maximum, cool breeze through the house, hopefully from a window that’s
under a big tree so the air’s cooler. You also want to maximize the breeze
in your attic, which you can accomplish by locating a vent at the highest
point in the attic (to capitalize on the chimney effect).
When the AC is on, you must close all windows. The best bet is to close
all window coverings as well to increase insulation and prevent solar
heat from entering the house.
200
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

You also want to consider how heat will move in your house when the air
conditioner’s on. If you can arrange a fan to blow air over your body while
the AC is on, you can turn the thermostat up and get the same comfort
effect; therefore, small fans are always a good idea in an air-conditioned
house.
 Winter: In the winter, you close all windows, so prevailing wind isn’t 
a factor inside the house; however, air flow still matters in the attic. You
want to close off the attic space in order to retain heat up there. You also
want to direct the heat to where you live in the house the most, probably
the kitchen and family room. Humidifiers can increase comfort.
If you have a roof vent for purging hot air in the summer, cover it up in
the winter. Heavy plastic garbage bags work well with duct tape (but
aesthetically minded neighbors may start a petition, so use your
common sense).
 Fall and spring: Depending on the weather, use techniques from either
summer or winter. For the most part, it’s not that important to do much
of anything in spring and fall because the temperatures are comfortable.
Choosing and Using Your Fans
After you determine the natural ventilation scheme in your home (see the pre-
ceding sections), you can enhance the effect with the use of active fans. Like
anything else, some fans are better than others. What you want is to achieve
the highest efficiency at the lowest cost (both operating and equipment
costs). In this section, I present some general rules for fans.
Viewing fan efficiency and operation
The efficiency of a fan is the amount of air it moves divided by the power it
consumes. Fans are rated for how much air they can move in a given amount of
time. The most common spec is cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can calculate
how many cubic feet are in your house, room, or attic (length × width × height)
to find the proper size fan. Be aware, however, that the fan is measured in ideal
conditions of air flow, which you probably won’t be experiencing. Buy a fan
about 20 percent larger than your calculations suggest.
Long, meandering hallways impede air flow much more than they may seem, 
so air flow routes should be as straight and clear as possible. The whole is only
as good as the weakest link in the chain, so you must set up the fans properly.
Consider the entire airflow path and make the flow as easy as possible. You
lose efficiency if you
201
Chapter 13: Breezeway: Directing Wind within Your House

 Aim a fan directly at a wall
 Set a fan near a window that’s only cracked open
 Aim a fan through a dust-coated grate
The most efficient movement of air occurs when a fan has a cowling. (A cowling
prevents air around the tip of the blades from circling about the outside of the
blades — they’re used extensively for jet engines.) Figure 13-5 shows why. A fan
without cowling allows air to loop around the outer edges. However, a cowling
prevents the looping and forces the air forward, moving much more air for the
same power. An enclosed window fan with a cowling is the most efficient.
If all you’re after is some air movement in a closed room, you can skip the
cowling. But if you’re interested in moving a large quantity of air through
your house, it becomes more important. Most heavy-duty work fans come
with cowlings.
Thermostats are switches that open or close at a set temperature. They come in
handy when you set up a fan in a remote location, such as an attic. When the
attic reaches a certain temperature, the thermostat (and the fan) activates.
When it’s hot in the summer, you get ventilation. In the winter, the fan never
comes on. You can get a thermostat in most hardware stores for around $15.
They’re small, metallic disks, around an inch and a half in diameter. You’ll have
to do some AC wiring, which means there may be a shock hazard if you’re not
careful. You may want to hire an electrical contractor for the job.
Never leave a fan on in an enclosed room when no humans are present. All
fans are heaters. They dissipate power, giving it off as heat. If you put a fan in a
closed room, the air temperature will rise — it’s a fact of physics. You may feel
cooler because of the breeze, but the temperature rises. Leaving an oscillating
fan on all day long in an enclosed house while you’re at work only wastes 
electricity and heats your house.
Considering fan types
Many fans are available at a wide range of prices. Choosing the right unit 
for your needs can ensure you get the proper effect you’re looking for.
Oscillating fans
Oscillating fans move back and forth. These fans work only for convective
cooling, and they’re dubious at that.
If you want to achieve the most convective cooling for the least cost, get a
small, stationary fan and aim it directly onto your uncovered body. Position it
close so that you get the most benefit from the air movement. A big oscillating
fan on the other side of the room is inefficient and may even make things worse
by stirring up hot air near the ceiling.
202
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Box fans
Box fans are portable units you can move around as the need occurs. Most
have some kind of cowling, some better than others. Blade design also deter-
mines the efficiency of the air flow. You can find fans that are impressively
efficient, but keep in mind that paying extra for a good fan may not be as
worthwhile as simply using a smaller, cheaper fan the right way in the first
place.

Chapter 13: Breezeway: Directing Wind within Your House

If you have room, a large, lower-powered fan is better than a small brutish
one. The larger the blades (not power, blade size), the more slowly the blades
can move to achieve the same amount of air. Fan noise is important. Cheap
ones are loud, clanky, and inefficient. Good ones make a smooth, even sound.
Window fans
Window fans come with a sheet metal mounting arrangement that fits right 
into an open window and seals around the edges (a perfect cowling). Most of
these fans are very efficient. The best way to move air in your house is by
using a good window fan mounted into the most appropriate window, probably
upstairs on the downwind side of your house (the fan aims out the window).
One small window fan mounted properly can do the same work as a number 
of large fans scattered about the house. (See the earlier “Catering to the 
prevailing winds” section.)
Exhaust fans
Consider exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens. When you turn on a 
bathroom fan without any bathroom windows open, the exhausted air is
drawn from the house, and outside air is drawn into the house through what-
ever openings are available (leaks in the insulation, open windows, and the
like). Exhaust fans shouldn’t be used when the HVAC system is running, but 
if you need to, open a small window nearby so that you can control the air
movement.
If you’re cooking in the summer when the AC is on, exhaust fans can make a big
impact on the comfort in your house. This is true especially if you’re boiling
water, because not only does that heat the air, but it also humidifies. Run the
fan on high, but crack open a nearby window so that you don’t pull expensive,
cooled air out of your house. Also, when you’re finished cooking, run cold
water from your tap over the heated pots and pans to wash the heat down the
drain instead of letting it slowly seep into the house.
Ceiling fans
Ceiling fans may or may not bring outside air into the house, depending on
how you’ve set up vents. They can accomplish two things: convective cooling
and reversing or enhancing the chimney effect. Here’s how to use your ceiling
fan to get the most benefit (see Figure 13-6):
 Create some convective cooling: All you need for convective cooling 
is air movement, and it doesn’t really matter how you achieve it. With 
a ceiling fan, you can get convective cooling by running the fan in either
direction. If you run the fan so that air is pushing directly down at you, it
will feel entirely different than if the air is being pushed up, around, and
then down against the walls. The latter is a more indirect movement and
may feel more comfortable by virtue of being less imperative.
204
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 Draw the heat up: If you have a vent (or an open window near a ceiling),
you can enhance the chimney effect by running a ceiling fan in the
reverse direction.
 Reverse the chimney effect by pushing hot air down: In the winter, you
can use a ceiling fan to push hot air back down into the room. In a small
room, it won’t make much difference which direction the fan is running,
because the air will simply circle around; the net effect is to equalize the
temperature in the entire room. In a large room, push the air downward.
Note that in this case, if you’re sitting directly below the fan, convective
cooling from the air movement may exceed the warming effect.
In the summer, whether a ceiling fan is really beneficial is an open question.
You want hot air to rise to the ceiling and stay there; however, when you run
a ceiling fan in either direction, you’re stirring up the hot air and moving it
around the room. On the other hand, you get a very nice convective cooling
effect from a ceiling fan, which can probably more than offset the warming
effect.

Chapter 13: Breezeway: Directing Wind within Your House

A well-positioned ceiling fan can allow you to lower your thermostat by 4°F
and achieve the same comfort level. Ceiling fans work best when the fan
blades are 7' to 9' above the floor and 10" to 12" below the ceiling.
You may need several fans in a large room. Aesthetics will likely dictate the
choice of size, but the bigger blades are quieter because they move more
slowly to achieve the same airflow.
The maxim you get what you pay for is especially true for ceiling fans. Cheap
ones make noise, are inefficient, and don’t last long because they have shoddy
bearings. In other words, cheap ceiling fans are very expensive, particularly if
you factor in the time and effort it takes to install one.
Whole house fans
Whole house fans are mounted in the ceiling between a high point in your
house and the attic. They draw air through open windows, exhaust it up
through the attic space, and cool the attic space. (Any air movement through
the attic space will cool it because the air you’re drawing in is almost always
cooler than the air in the attic space.)
You never run a whole house fan with the HVAC on and run one rarely in the
wintertime. But in the summer, when the outside air temperature cools down
at night, a whole house fan works better than any other air-movement
scheme.
A great advantage is that you can open any window in the house and get air
movement in that room. You can open some windows more than others and
regulate the relative effects.
In the summer, you turn on the fan when the sun goes down and leave it on
all night. In the morning when the sun comes up, shut it off and close all the
windows and drapes in the house to keep the most heat out.
In the winter, you need to cover a whole house fan with some kind of insulation
so that you don’t lose a lot of heat up into the attic.
The easiest way to cover your fan for the off-season is to unplug your whole
house fan and simply cover the whole unit (on top, from the attic) with a
thick, old blanket from a thrift store.
Some house fans come with metal vents that automatically open or close
when the fan is on or off. The insulation properties of these are very poor,
and they generally leak a lot as well.
206
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Here are some mounting tips:
 Whole house fans make a lot of noise because they’re big and powerful,
and because they need to be mounted in a central location, the noise is
prevalent in the entire house. Mount them on rubber gaskets to reduce
the noise.
 If your attic isn’t well vented, a ceiling fan will move very little air for the
amount of power it consumes. Go up into your attic and check to make
sure that you have plenty of vents. If not, either make some vents or
don’t use a whole house fan.
Attic vent fans
As opposed to a whole house fan, an attic vent fan draws air in from one part of
the attic, and out another. There is no air movement in the house below, and so
attic vent fans can be run when the house is closed up (for example, when the
air conditioner is on).
See the upcoming “Installing a Solar Attic Vent Fan” section for project
advice.
Directly Powering Tabletop 
and Ceiling Fans
You can use PV modules to directly power tabletop fans (portable units) and
ceiling fans. Tabletop fans that run off of 12VDC are available (look for them
in RV, boat, and camper Web sites). This method is also practical for gazebos,
porches, outbuildings, and other applications without AC power.
The advantage of solar power is that you don’t need to pay for expensive elec-
trician labor or county building permits to install hardwiring. For example, in a
remote gazebo, you’d have to first get a county building permit to run house-
hold electrical power to the site. Then you’d have to dig a deep trench for the
electrical conduit and hire an electrician to run the conduit and connect to
your fuse box. The electrician would also have to configure switch boxes,
switches, and other code wiring, finally culminating with a junction box where
the fan needs to hang. The cost of such a project can run well over $2,000, not
including the fan itself.
207
Chapter 13: Breezeway: Directing Wind within Your House

On the other hand, a complete do-it-yourself solar fan system might cost 
$300 (see the next section).
Greenhouses are an excellent application as well because they generally
don’t need electrical power for any reason other than driving fans to cool the
air in the summer. Solar-powered fans are ideal because there’s no need for
expensive electrical wiring. Plus, they’re safer because they run off of low, DC
voltages. Greenhouses are often wet and humid, creating shock hazards with
conventional wiring schemes.
Installing a Solar Attic Vent Fan
Attics can get to be over 160°F in the hot summer sun. This heat migrates
down via conduction through your ceiling and into your house. Even in the
middle of the night, a poorly ventilated attic stays very hot. If you can some-
how manage to continuously purge the air in your attic with outside air, your
entire house will be much cooler. This idea is especially true of old houses
with poor insulation.
One way to purge an attic is with a whole house fan (see the earlier “Whole
house fans” section). If the weather’s not too hot out, a whole house fan can
keep air moving through the living space and purge heat from the attic above.
But you can’t run them when the air conditioner is on because they require
the house to be opened up, and they don’t have the desired effect when the
outside temperature is hotter than the inside. However, attic vent fans can be
run anytime, regardless of whether the house is opened up or closed off. In
particular, when you’re running an air conditioner, you want an attic vent to
cool the attic as much as possible because that will decrease the work load
on the air conditioner (which is very expensive to run).
Cover up your attic vent fan in the winter to prevent natural ventilation and
keep heat trapped in the attic space.
Opting for solar
A solar attic vent fan can be installed anywhere and requires no county permits
or electrician labor. Figure 13-7 shows a solar attic vent system.
The fan runs whenever the sun shines on the PV modules; this makes perfect
sense because when the sun is the brightest, you want the most air pumping.
The unit comes on only when the set temperature is reached. For the cost and
complexity, a solar vent fan may be one of your best solar investments in a hot
climate.
208
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Choosing the best location
Attic vent fans work any number of ways. Figure 13-8 has the fan mounted on
the roof and in the gable. (See “Letting the heat rise with the chimney effect”
for more on vent types.) Either scheme works essentially the same, the mount-
ing choice depends on ease of installation. The gable scheme is also more
weather-proof, because rain isn’t apt to fall into the attic space through the
opening, and leaks around the seals won’t cause problems like they will in the
roof.
The most efficient setup involves placing the fan in the rooftop because you
can locate it right at the apex of the roof, where the most heat collects due to
the chimney effect. Note in the figure that the rooftop vent is on the down-
wind side of the house to complement the natural ventilation scheme from
prevailing winds.
The following steps explain what to do as you choose your ideal setup:
1. Determine your attic’s natural ventilation scheme.
Go up into your attic and find the vents and openings designed for ventila-
tion. Make a rough drawing and an air movement analysis. (See the earlier
section titled “Capitalizing on Your Natural Ventilation Scheme.”) Identify
a location where it makes the most sense to locate an attic vent fan.
2. Look for ways to improve the natural ventilation scheme.
For example, if you only have a few vents and they’re in spots that don’t
enhance prevailing winds or the chimney effect (which says that heat
rises), putting in a few more vents may be easy. In particular, most houses

could use a vent or two near the top of the roof to enhance the chimney
effect. You can get inexpensive vents from most hardware stores, and
they’re relatively easy to install.
Consider what the vents will look like from the street. You may want to
locate roof vents so they won’t be visible from the street level.

3. Determine the best location for the fan.
In keeping with the rule to always enhance the natural ventilation
scheme, the most logical spot to put a vent fan is usually in a roof vent,
near the apex, with a cowling around the fan. Many roofs already have
passive vents; these openings are prime candidates for installing a fan,
but the dimensions and accessibility may preclude this.
Always try to locate a fan downwind in order to equalize ventilation
throughout the attic.
Also pay attention to available sunlight at potential locations on your
roof. If you can’t find a place that gets evening sun, you may have to buy
components separately, as I explain in the next section.
Selecting the type of fan 
for your application
Attic vent fans come in two forms: one-piece units and distributed units. 
A one-piece unit is built as in Figure 13-9. Total cost for a one-piece unit is
around $350.
One-piece attic vent fans are very simple to install; you don’t even need to 
go into the attic space. Simply cut a round hole in your roof, pull the shingles
back, slide the unit up under the shingles, and drop it into the hole. Seal for
weatherproofing, and you’re done.
Avoid trusses by going into the attic and drilling a hole out through the roof
halfway between adjoining joists. Back up on the roof, find the hole, and go
from there.

Chapter 13: Breezeway: Directing Wind within Your House

However, one-piece units may present a potential problem: The solar modules
are fixed in place on the unit, and the best location for your vent fan may not
be the best location for collecting sunlight. (If your solar modules aren’t getting
good sun, the fan won’t be pumping good air quantities.) In this case, you need
to go with a distributed-type system.
You can buy separate components for much less cost than a one-piece unit —
a separate 12VDC fan powerful enough to do the job costs about $100, and 
a PV module to run it costs another $130. However, the installation is more
expensive and difficult. You need a hood of some kind over the fan to prevent
rain from getting into the attic, or soaking the fan itself. You could potentially
install the fan on a vertical surface, behind a grate, and avoid a lot of installa-
tion problems, like cutting through a roof (which always entails risk or leaks).
Get better performance by tilting the PV modules to the west so you get the
most air movement in the afternoon. Tilting the modules to peak at around 
2 p.m. can provide the most comfort in the house.
Building a Solar Space Heater
Figure 13-10 shows the rudiments of a very effective solar space heater that
you can build for around $400 in parts. Over the course of a sunny day, this
system can heat a room very effectively, at zero cost — there are no pumps,
fans, or moving parts. This size can easily heat a small office in the dead of
winter, as long as the sun is shining. Or you can build a number of smaller
units and distribute them around your house. These also work well for barns,
work rooms, and so on, particularly in outbuildings with no power available.
The unit operates on both the chimney effect and greenhouse effect. The solar
collector absorbs sunlight and converts it into heat, which becomes trapped
in the collector via the greenhouse effect. The air around the absorber heats,
expands, and rises, creating a natural convection current via the chimney
effect. Vents at the top and bottom of the collector allow air-looping move-
ment between the collector and your house. Cool air is drawn into the bottom,
heated in the collector, and then feeds back into the house through the top
vents.
In the summer, you need to block off the vents to prevent operation. On a
cold night, close the vents to prevent the reverse process from occurring.
The best location is a south-facing wall, but east or west can also be useful,
depending on what time of day you want the heat.

Chapter 14
Solar Pumps, Wind Power, 
Hydro Power, and Batteries 
in Applications
In This Chapter
 Running pumps directly from PV modules
 Using batteries when powering small remote cabins, RVs, and boats
 Considering wind and water power as alternative solar power resources
You can use portable solar PV systems for cabins, boats, RVs, backups, 
in-home offices, and outbuildings, such as barns, offices, exercise rooms,
and so on. The usual advantages apply: reducing both your electric utility bill
and pollution. You can also use PV systems to run well pumps and swimming
pool pumps. Well pumps are often located in remote locations, so the use of
solar PV for power precludes the need to pay for costly power transmission
line runs. Solar powering your swimming pool pump makes sense because the
pump will run the hardest when the sun is the brightest, which reflects how
the pool itself will be used. Wind and water power are also solar resources, so 
I describe in general terms when and how both alternatives should be used
and point you in the right direction if you decide to pursue them.
As with any solar application, energy conservation is the first step. Before
specifying your system needs, do an energy audit and take the indicated
energy conservation measures (see Chapters 2 and 3). A general rule: Each
dollar you save on conservation will save you around $5 on the cost of a
small solar-power system.
Considering solar alternatives other than electrical PV is also wise. For 
example, solar water heaters work very well for remote applications. Do-
it-yourselfers can build batch-style water heaters for very little cost (see
Chapters 10 and 12). Chapter 9 includes a good number of small solar 
systems that you can use independently of other systems.

Directly Powering Pumps and Motors
PV panels (see Chapter 4) can directly power DC electrical motors (no batter-
ies required). Chapter 13 details an attic vent fan system. Other applications
are similar in nature with regard to system components and operation.
You can purchase individual parts and assemble and install systems yourself,
but buying completed kits makes a lot more sense because the pros probably
know how to integrate parts into working systems better than you do.
Water supply systems
Solar power is very useful for water supply systems. The most common appli-
cations are for household water supplies and agricultural and livestock needs.
Of course, using utility-provided water is more economical in most places, but
in remote locations, it’s simply not available. The pipes and trenches that
would be required to get to the desired site are often prohibitively expensive.
And in these types of applications, providing utility electrical power — which
you’d need to power your own pump — is likely also prohibitively expensive,
so there’s a double whammy.
Solar water pumps can be located anywhere there’s available sunshine and 
a relatively clean water supply (dirty water may be filtered, but filters clog up,
and the pump flow becomes constricted, so the application quickly becomes
maintenance intensive). The water supply can be a well, creek or river, lake,
and so on.
Water-pumping systems all include a few basic components, as shown in
Figure 14-1.
On a sunny day, the PV-powered pump slowly fills the reservoir. In a household
application, the storage reservoir is located above the house so that when
someone opens a tap, gravity provides the water pressure to the faucets.
These types of systems are common for lakeside cabins and homes in the
California mountains.
For livestock applications, the reservoir may be nothing more than a ditch or 
a cattle trough set on the ground. This system also works for crop irrigation
where there’s no reservoir at all. The water simply feeds directly into the irriga-
tion pipes. Because the pressure varies quite a bit, broadcasting sprinklers are
impractical, but drippers work very well.
216
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Here are the calculations you need to make in order to specify the system size:
 Daily water usage, in gallons, both average and maximum: This amount
may vary over the course of the year. For example, some livestock appli-
cations don’t require water in the winter months at all because the
animals are in grocery stores, waiting to take center stage at your 
holiday banquets.
 Available sunshine, in average hours per day, and your need for a 
consistent water supply: Can you tolerate a few days of drought? If so, 
the reservoir may be smaller. If you need water all the time and sunshine
is inconsistent, you’ll need a larger reservoir, along with larger PV mod-
ules so you can fill the reservoir on sunny days. (See Chapter 5 for info 
on appraising your solar potential.)
 Difference in vertical height between the top level of the water source
and the output end of the pump hose: For agricultural applications, this
distance is usually small, on the order of 10 or 20 feet. For some residen-
tial applications, this number can be more than 100 feet, which makes
the pump much more expensive. This number is called the pump’s head
pressure.
Specifications for pumps list a table of wattages versus pump capacities and
heads. For example, see Table 14-1.

A pump, plus a matching PV panel, costs around $1,400 for the 80 W version
and $1,600 for the 115 W version. You have to add the cost of pipes and tubes,
but you don’t have to spend much more than that. If needed, a simple float-
type switch can turn the pump off when the reservoir is full, but the system
will be more efficient if you can figure out a way to use all the water that can
possibly be pumped.
Swimming pool pump systems
Swimming pool solar pumps are available, but they’re expensive upfront. The
advantage is that conventional pool pumps (which are relatively inexpensive)
cost a lot to run, but with a solar system, you’ll never have to pay another
cent for powering your pool pump. In particular, if you have a solar swimming
pool heating system (hot-water collectors) and a large-scale solar PV system
(Chapter 17) on a time-of-use (TOU) rate structure (see Chapter 6), you need
to run your pool pump in the afternoon when power rates are at their peak.
A conventional pump system is prohibitively expensive to run in this case. In
the long term, you’d be better off with a solar pump system, which would be
much more consistent with your green philosophy.
The more sunshine you get, the more the pool pump runs. This works nicely
because swimming hours (how much your family uses the pool) usually track
the amount of sunshine as well. Table 14-2 shows a typical performance chart
for a system. Note: Back pressure is a measure of head and piping resistance
to flow. If the filter is clogged up and the piping is corroded or blocked, the
flow levels decrease as the back pressure increases.

Working with PV Systems with Batteries
You can safely and reliably install off-grid PV systems because the voltages
and power capacities are low. Batteries can be tricky (see Chapter 18 for more
details on batteries and their operations), so avoid them if at all possible.
Assessing your power needs
Regardless of the application, the first step is to assess your power needs. You
can add up the power consumptions of individual appliances and other loads
you need to run, but you also need to define how many loads will be running
concurrently and at what times. Here are four specifications of interest:
 Total system capacity, measured in kilowatt-hours per day: This is the
total amount of electricity you need over the course of a day.
 Peak instantaneous power output, measured in watts: You have a lot 
of control over this specification because you can run appliances at differ-
ent times. For example, if your usual routine includes turning on the lights
in the morning at the same time you turn on the coffee maker, you can
change to a programmable coffee maker that has your coffee ready before
you wake up. Or you can run your microwave oven only when all the
lights are off, and so on.
 Duty cycle (a measure of how often the system is used weekly):
A weekend cabin used for two days a week has a duty cycle of 2⁄7, or
approximately 28 percent. A system used every day has a duty cycle 
of 100 percent.
219
Chapter 14: Solar Pumps, Wind Power, Hydro Power, and Batteries

 How many hours of good sunlight a day you can expect: Estimating with
much accuracy is difficult because sunlight depends a great deal on the
weather. It also depends on the time of year in which you’re interested in
using your system. For a weekend cabin in the mountains, used only in
the summer, you may expect 8 hours a day of sunshine, and in the thin
mountain air, you’ll get very good solar exposure. (See Chapter 5 for more
details on estimating your sunshine.) For a cabin used twice a month for 
a few days all year round, the worst case will be in winter, when you may
only get four hours a day of cumulative sunshine, maybe even less if it’s
snowing and the panels are covered up.
Table 14-3 shows a typical sample load analysis chart for a weekend cabin
(your table will be different, of course). (See Chapter 2 for a list of typical
power draws for different household loads.) In this situation, the duty cycle
is around 28 percent (two days per week), and the cabin is used only in the
summer months, so the average expected sunlight per day is around eight
hours (the weather’s rarely cloudy, and the air is thin and cool — excellent
for solar applications).

Here’s how to do some significant calculations from this chart:
 Total energy needs in one day (in kWh/day): Total up the Watt-Hours/
Day column and divide by 1,000
1,699 kWh/day ÷ 1,000 = 1.699 kWh/day
 Daily energy needs adjusted for inefficiency (10%): Multiply the total
daily energy needs by 1.1
1.699 kWh/day × 1.1 ≈1.9 kWh/day
220
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 Maximum instantaneous load: Decide which appliances will be on at
the same time and add their power draws. (You can control this number
by simply restricting the simultaneous use of certain appliances — for
example, don’t use the microwave and the coffee pot at the same time.)
1,200 W
 Duty cycle: Divide the number of days per week the cabin is used by 7
2 days ÷ 7 days ≈0.28 = 28%
 Average kWh per day: Multiply the adjusted daily energy needs by the
duty cycle
1.9 ÷ 2⁄7 ≈0.54 kWh/day
The specifications that define the example system are the following (when
you purchase a system, you need these numbers to tell system size and 
composition):
 Solar panel output: At eight hours of good sunlight per day, the example
requires a 67.5-watt solar panel. (Take the average kWh per day of 0.54
and divide by 8 hours.)
It’s best to multiply this number by 1.3, just to be on the conservative
side. This yields around 90 watts.
 Voltage output: In the example, it’s 12VDC, but you can also use other
voltages. (12VDC is the most common because it’s what boats, cars and
RVs use. The choice is governed by the equipment you use.)
 Battery size: Calculate battery size, which is specified in terms of 
amp-hours (Ah). Most batteries are 12VDC, but other sizes are also avail-
able. For this example, assume you have a 12VDC system. Take the total
adjusted kWh/day, multiply this by 1,000 to get kWh/day, and then divide
this value by the battery voltage. For the example, this yields 158 Ah:
1.9 kWh/day _ 1,000 W/kW ≈158 Ah
12 VDC
In order to get the best performance and economics out of a battery, 
it’s best to over-spec the capacity by 100 percent, which yields around
300 Ah.
 Fuse size: Fuse size is determined by the maximum current draw. Take
the maximum instantaneous load and divide by the voltage. For the
example, this yields 100 amps:
1,200 W ÷ 12VDC = 100 amps
This is a problem. Not only are currents higher than 30 amps dangerous,
but the wire sizes also have to be very thick. Note that if you toss the
microwave oven out of the picture, the maximum instantaneous power
outage is only around 300 watts, which yields 25 amps. This number’s
practical. It’s time to make a solar oven (see Chapter 9) or get a camping
stove that operates off of propane.
221
Chapter 14: Solar Pumps, Wind Power, Hydro Power, and Batteries

A basic 12VDC starter systems costs $1,100 with battery and outputs 0.4 kWh
per day (which isn’t very much energy). The PV panel size is 60" x 24". A 1.6
kWh kit costs $5,000 with battery backup; panel size is 60" x 100". These num-
bers are for four hours of pretty good sun per day. You may actually be able to
get twice these numbers, under the best conditions. Of course, you’ll also get
less on a rainy day.
You can get more capacity out of your portable solar system (and save money
by using a smaller PV panel) by aiming the PV panel directly at the sun at all
times. If you can, design a mounting system that makes this easy and practical.
The easiest way is to simply set the panel against a wall and move it manually.
Or you can mount it on a cart with wheels and turn it occasionally. Aim the
panel east in the morning, south during the middle of the day, and west in the
afternoon. Or at the very least, change the vertical angle (elevation) a few
times per year.
Auto batteries don’t work in these applications because they’re designed to
output high currents for very short periods of time. In household power appli-
cations, low currents for long, sustained periods are the norm. Also, auto bat-
teries aren’t designed to discharge a large percentage of their capacity. What’s
needed are deep-cycle batteries, which are the kind used in golf carts.
Many small-scale systems are subject to rebates and subsidies, just like PV
systems. See Chapter 21 for details on how to research this subject.
Powering remote and mobile locations
Standalone PV systems (with batteries) aren’t economical compared to using
the power grid for your power needs. But where no grid power is available —
for example, on boats and RVs or for remote mountain cabins — they’re excel-
lent solutions. You can either install a medium-sized system in a fixed format,
or you can make your system portable so you can use it in a number of differ-
ent venues. Or simply move the PV panels and leave everything else fixed. You
can get PV modules that are flexible and waterproof. Some PV modules fold up
for portability.
Some users are interested in backup power, for when the grid goes down. 
A cheaper alternative than solar is a gas-powered generator, but these take
time to start, make noise, and need ventilation; and they stink, not to mention
pollute. For those who are interested in a peaceful, clean environment, solar 
is the best choice.
It’s wise to supplement medium power PV systems with other solar systems,
such as hot water heaters and solar ovens (see Chapters 9 and 10). The latter
are cheaper per kWh, and by dividing the tasks, you lower your risk that a
broken system will disrupt your entire lifestyle.
222
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

Wind and Water Solar Power
Windmills and hydro-power generators are also sustainable solar resources.
Both are energy sources derived from the sun, although indirectly compared to
solar collectors (PV and hot water). Wind is caused by changes in air pressure
brought on by different regions of the globe heating and cooling at different
rates due to variations in solar exposure. Rain is caused by evaporation, which
results from warming and cooling as well; hydro-power comes from rain stor-
age in reservoirs, creeks, and the like.
The two methods are very similar in the way they generate voltages with spin-
ning turbines. The concept is very simple: When you apply a power source to
an electric motor, the shaft spins. On the other hand, if you reverse the process
and manually spin the shaft of an electric motor, its two wires output power.
The physics goes equally in either direction. Practical designs can be very
complex, but at the heart is always the electric motor principle. Inverters are
required (just as with solar PV panels) to convert the raw voltages from the
rotors into usable power, typically 12VDC because batteries are the norm.
Another style of inverter converts into standard 120VAC household current.
Although solar PV panels and water heater collectors work only when there’s
direct sunshine, both wind and water are available at any time of day or night.
Wind, however, can come and go, from minute to minute. Water resources gen-
erally don’t vary much over the course of a day, but they can vary over sea-
sons and are also subject to droughts when there may be no power available 
at all for extended periods.
Hydro power is also a built-in energy storage mechanism because you can
make a reservoir from which you can draw water any time you want it. In fact,
a reservoir is generally a good idea because it makes pressures constant. Of
course, the big problem with hydro power is that you need to be by a river or
stream (or dam) to be able to use it. Most people don’t have this luxury, but for
those who do, this is an excellent and economical source of solar power.
The good news is that you can get rebates and subsidies for wind and water
power the exact same as for PV systems and water heating systems. They’re
all solar power and are therefore grouped together in this regard.
In the following sections, I explain the general concepts of using both wind
and water power so that you can decide whether they’re viable options for
you, and if so, how best to proceed.
Blowing with the wind
A wind turbine looks like a small airplane with a huge propeller — and that’s
because that’s what it basically is. Wind pushes the vane (the opposite of
223
Chapter 14: Solar Pumps, Wind Power, Hydro Power, and Batteries

what happens with an airplane propeller), which turns the propeller and
forces the alternator to rotate, thereby outputting AC power.
Wind turbines (see Figure 14-2) work well under certain conditions, in 
which case the economics are good. They also have a number of operational
drawbacks.
Here are the pluses of wind power:
 Power can be generated anytime, day or night.
 In some locations, wind is virtually a constant (magnitudes may vary,
but output power is always available).
 Wind speeds vary over terrain, so you can find locations on your property
that provide maximum potential. Ridge lines, coastlines, and the tops of
barren hills are the best candidates.
 Wind is available almost everywhere, in all climates. In many of the
worst climates, it’s very powerful.
And here are some drawbacks:
 Extremely high wind conditions may destroy or damage a unit. Turbines
want a minimum amount of wind to begin working, but they also don’t
want to be subjected to tornadoes.

Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 Batteries are definitely required because you just never know when
you’ll get wind.
 In some communities, you may be prevented from installing a wind 
turbine due to noise and visual blight issues.
 Mounting is a bear. In general, the higher the unit, the better the output
energy, all things being equal. One hundred feet is considered optimum,
and that’s a long way up there. The mounting must have a tremendous
amount of integrity because of the torques that need to be withstood.
And consider this: How do you raise the mount? You have to choose
among a number of methods, each with pros and cons. And what if the
mount were to break in high winds? Not only would this be very expen-
sive, but imagine the unit crashing down onto something.
 Rotors are noisy and obtrusive when they’re spinning (which they’re
hopefully doing quite a bit). The bigger the blades, the more power they’ll
generate, but they also make more noise because they’re in contact with
more air. They also attract a lot of visual attention and may clutter up a
placid environment.
 Cost varies depending on how much wind is available. At some point,
solar PV is a better investment. But if you get a lot of wind, wind is 
a cheaper and more reliable way to go than PV.
 Moving parts are never as reliable as stationary, so PV wins out in this
category.
 Wind power is relatively obscure. Finding somebody to do your installa-
tion and servicing may be very difficult.
 Obstructions such as trees, houses, barns, and the like all affect wind
speed. And because wind direction varies, obstructions in one direction
may or may not be important in other directions. The best bet is to stay
well away from all obstructions, and this may be prohibitive because of
the topography or layout of your property.
In general, a wind turbine must be mounted at least 30 feet above the ground
and at least 200 feet away from obstructions. There’s 40 percent more wind at
100 feet than at ground level.
The smallest turbines (with 6-foot rotors) sell for around $1,000, not including
installation (tower building and raising, plus wiring and so on). They output
400 watts of power at wind speeds of 28 miles per hour (this is a pretty good
wind) and can withstand winds up to 110 miles per hour. You can use these
numbers to get an idea of how many kilowatt-hours per day you can expect, 
on average; then you can devise a battery bank accordingly.
225
Chapter 14: Solar Pumps, Wind Power, Hydro Power, and Batteries

A turbine with a 15-foot rotor produces 3.2 kilowatts at 28 mile-per-hour winds
for around $8,000, including installation. Fifteen feet is big, and the turbine
makes a deep swooping noise. You’ll know it’s there.
Tower costs vary depending on height, but a typical tower kit for a small 
turbine runs around $700 (50' height). The installation is the tricky part. You
better know what you’re doing or somebody could literally be killed. The
higher up, the more effective; but the higher up, the more expensive the tower.
Using water resources 
for your power needs
Eight percent of United States’ electricity comes from hydro generators
located on major riverways.
Water power is by far the biggest solar energy resource, and it can also be 
generated on small scales. Of course, you need access to a waterway, though
either moving or stationary water can work. If the resource is stationary, you
need to locate a hydro turbine somewhere below the top of the water, the
lower the better because you get more head pressure. If the water is moving,
you can simply dip a hydro turbine down into the water, at any depth level you
want.
You can use the movement of tides to generate electricity, but this is trickier 
to exploit than a river resource, although it has the potential to be more consis-
tent over the course of a long time. However, you can generate electricity only
when the tide is moving (either in or out, it doesn’t matter which direction).
Hydro power has a lot of benefits if you’re close to a suitable water resource.
However, it also has drawbacks to consider.
Here are some of the advantages of water power:
 You can generate more kWhs per cost than any other energy resource, 
in particular solar PV panels.
 No batteries required (although they do make the system work better).
You can assume your hydro generator output will be pretty constant, at
least from hour to hour. Over the course of a year, you may have major
variations.
 You can install a system of virtually any size power output if your water
source is big enough, which is usually a requirement for economically
viable applications. If your water source is small, power outputs will
fluctuate quite a bit and may be zero for extended periods.
226
Part III: Doing It Yourself: Small- and Medium-Sized Projects 

 You can generate power day or night, in any weather (freezing may
cause problems, but you can usually design around them).
 Hydro systems have very long lives, are relatively trouble free, and
require very little maintenance.
 A submersible hydro-power generator (moving water) for $1,200 gets you
2.4 kWh daily with a 9 mph stream. This is good economics, compared 
to other solar resources.
And here are some disadvantages of water power:
 Complex electrical system designs and mounting schemes are difficult
with water pressures pushing all the time. This is not a trivial system
design to tackle, although do-it-yourselfers can safely do it if they’re
patient and willing to try things, then adjust, then try, and then adjust
until they’ve finalized the best arrangement.
 Waterways can dry up in droughts.
 Upfront costs are high, particularly for stationary water systems. In
addition to the hydro generator, you need a good inverter to convert the
raw voltages from the alternator into the standard household voltages
that will run your equipment. Not many hydro generators are sold
because so few people have access to a good water supply.
If you’re interested in moving forward, you need to take some measurements
based on your water source:
 For moving water: Measure the water flow and speed. Flow is how much
water passes a given point in a minute. Generally, you won’t be able to
use the entire flow from a creek or river because that disrupts all wildlife
functions. You can measure speed by simply tossing a stick out into the
water and timing its travel over a given distance. (Measure the distance by
pacing it out, one pace is around a yard.) An approximate measure is good
enough, because speed changes so much that an accurate measurement
gives no better results.
 For stationary water: You need to devise a pipe system that produces
maximum pressure. This is a complicated (albeit interesting) subject, and
you’ll need to find some detailed resources. There are two types: high fall
(head) – low volume, and high volume – low-head. The former is the type
of system described previously.
You need water rights (legal classifications), which can sometimes be confus-
ing and contentious. Just because you’re next to a river or lake doesn’t mean
you have the right to use the water for generating power.
227
Chapter 14: Solar Pumps, Wind Power, Hydro Power, and Batteries

Here are the government agencies that control water rights:
 U.S. Geological Survey: www.usgs.gov
 Army Corps of Engineers: www.usace.army.mil
 Department of Agriculture: www.usda.gov
 County engineer: Do an online search or check in the phone book under
county government agencies
You may have to deal with all four agencies before you start generating hydro
power. Good luck!

Making the decision to install a big PV system on your
roof is important because it involves a lot of money and
needs to be done just right. I show you how to calculate
the finances, find a contractor, and come to an agreement
with your contractor on the size and location of your PV
system. Finally, for those of you who want to completely
cut off all ties to the utility company, you can try off-grid
living. I show you how to calculate the best system for

I
n Part IV, I address large-scale solar projects that you can choose to do your-
self or contract out to a professional. You can do (almost) all the work on
any project yourself. But do you want to? Or should you? You can save a lot of
money by doing the work on your own, but you can also run into problems and
end up paying a lot more to get things fixed. In this chapter I give you a variety
of factors to consider when making the decision to either do a project yourself,
or hire a contractor. Also keep in mind that you can usually hire a contractor to
do only a portion of a job for you.
You need to understand the permit and inspection process so that you know
how difficult it’s going to be. The process varies by region, so I provide also
guidelines for doing research.
Getting Good Information
If you’re thinking about doing a big project at your house, understanding the
entire process, from design to completion and use, is by far the most impor-
tant place to begin. Take your time; don’t set a deadline and don’t set a sched-
ule. Create no expectations that’ll cause you to hurry and make mistakes. The
solar industry is still maturing and is evolving quickly, so getting a good grip
on things, even for those who are experienced and knowledgeable, can be a
challenge.

Here are some important steps to take:
1. Research your subject (which you’ve already started doing by reading
this book).
Go online and find every system you can that looks like the one you
want. Look up manufacturers — how many are there? Are they new? 
Are there alternatives? In particular, you want to look for kits whenever 
possible, regardless of whether you’re doing the work yourself or 
contracting.
2. Make drawings, including parts lists and specifications.
Don’t worry if they’re not completely accurate; just making drawings 
can move you along in the right direction. If you can, obtain some formal
drawings (those that have been approved by a county building depart-
ment) and make your own drawings look the same. The more complete
you can make your drawings, the easier your project will go.
3. Take a trip to your county building department and informally
inquire about what you’re going to do.
The best resource you can obtain is a friendly, courteous, willing clerk.
Good luck! Show the staff your informal drawings. These people are
bureaucrats, but be nice, cooperative, and patient. Don’t get angry, no
matter what they say or do. They can offer some really good advice, and
at the very least, you can find out what you’re going to be up against if
you decide to enter the formal permit process on your own.
The upcoming “Passing code” section explains questions you should ask
during this trip.
4. Call around.
Call contractors, trade agencies, and stores that sell equipment. Ask them
about the system you are contemplating; ask them the pros and cons and
what advice they can offer. Always talk to more than one resource so that
you’re not led in a particular direction that they want you to go (the 
direction that will make them the most money, of course).
Being Realistic about Codes 
and Regulations
Every major project on your house is subject to a whole book full of codes and
regulations. In theory, government regulations exist to help people maintain
safe, reliable, predictable, and consistent systems, but the permit system
doesn’t always work as planned. Even if you’re in the business, trying to stay
abreast of all the codes, regulations, laws, fees, and so on regarding the solar
industry is prohibitive. In the following sections, I commiserate with you about
232
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

the aggravations, note some of the reasons you should try to follow code, and
give you tips to help you complete the process successfully.
On the honor system: Choosing 
to follow code
Red tape is a major hassle. Bureaucrats often seem more concerned that
you’ve dotted your i’s and crossed your t’s than they are with safety and relia-
bility, and applying for permits can easily double the complexity of a building
project. Your drawings themselves must follow code — which can be difficult
to interpret — and if you make adjustments to your original design, you have
to resubmit your drawings and get new permits.
Furthermore, none of this is free. You have to pay fees for permits and then
fees for inspections, and then your property may be reappraised at a higher
value so your property tax can go up, sometimes considerably.
Code basically says you shouldn’t rewire anything in your house without a
permit and an inspection. You can’t change your plumbing, either. The fact is,
though, you may be able to install a solar system completely on your own —
it’ll likely work well, give you the performance you anticipated, and be safe and
reliable. Perhaps nobody will find out you didn’t get permits, and when you go
to sell your house, the subject most likely won’t even come up. And even if it
does, most buyers won’t flinch because most houses have work that’s not 
to code. Homeowner’s insurance policies often contain clauses that cover
subcode (or uninspected) installations on your house.
So if wading through the red tape is a big overhead rate that provides little
benefit, why bother? Here are the some of the biggest reasons:
 It’s the law. Codes are laws, and I can’t advocate breaking the law. (And
if you do build without a permit and an angry neighbor turns you in, you
may have to pay fines, stop work, and/or remove the work you’ve
already completed.)
 Codes provide safety standards. Especially if electrical or plumbing work
is new to you, codes can inform you of safety issues. Following code can
also help ensure that you don’t knock out those pesky load-bearing walls
or install a collector your roof can’t support.
 Contractors can get into legal problems for not getting permits, but
even more to the point, it’ll be impossible for you to sue them if some-
thing goes wrong. Courts don’t recognize your legal right to sue if you’re
working outside the system, and rightly so. You’ll have a very difficult
time finding a contractor who’ll work outside of the permit process.
(Contractors can take care of the permit and inspection process for 
you — see the upcoming “Hiring a Contractor” section.)
233
Chapter 15: Deciding between Doing It Yourself and Contracting

 Following codes and getting formal permits reduces the legal liability
you may face if somebody is injured on your property. If you want to
play it safe, go the formal route. You may want to consult with your insur-
ance agent to find out how your liability insurance is affected if you have
noncode work.
 Many rebates and warranties require you to go through the formal
permit process. You can’t really blame manufacturers for insisting that
the equipment they’re selling you is professionally installed because
they take on more risk if it’s not. And government agencies want code
work because, well, they’re government agencies and they support all
other government agencies.
Passing code
Final permit applications and drawings should be as polished as your resume
or an important business proposal. Here are some tips that can help you
make sure that your drawings and installation pass code:
 The best way to find out about codes is to visit your county building
department. Tell the inspector exactly what you’re planning to do and
ask him what you need to do.
 Base your drawings off of formal drawings that have already passed
code. You can find these drawings from friends or from the building
department at your county government.
 Informally visit the visit the county building office with your initial draw-
ings and ask about them. Also ask as many questions about the permit
process as you can, including the following:
• How long is the wait?
• How many forms are required?
• How long does it take to fill out the forms?
• What are the fees?
• What inspections are required?
• What happens if you do a job yourself and it doesn’t pass 
inspection?
• How do you request an inspection?
 Make your drawings as complete as possible, and include materials and
spec lists. Bureaucrats often reject drawings for not having the proper
legends, so make sure that yours are accurate. Take your plans to the
234
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

building department and be prepared to go through another round 
when it looks at them and tells you that you need more items. It’s unlikely
you’ll get your plans approved the first time through the mill. That’s okay,
because above all, you want your plans as good as you can get them. By
using the inspectors as information resources, you’ll end up with a better
final product.
Hiring a Contractor
Part of your decision on whether to do a project yourself or hire a contractor
should involve understanding exactly what a contractor can do for you and
what the process will be. Be aware that after you sign a contract, backing out
and going it alone are going to be difficult.
In the following sections, I describe what a contractor does and how it affects
your project timeline.
Knowing what a contractor can do
Every contractor uses a standard contract and follows approved practices. You
always have the right to negotiate; contractors always have the right to refuse.
You can engage a contractor at any point in the project, but most refuse to
come in after you’ve done half the job (or if they do, they’re inclined to charge
a lot and smirk at your ignorance). Most want to be a part of the design, which
may or may not cause problems. You can hire a contractor to do an entire
project, or just parts of it.
Contractors can
 Do your design (and it will probably be a good one)
 Make the drawings according to the standards the permit entities
require
 Obtain permits
 Manage the schedule and get the parts when they’re needed
 Manage any subs that are needed
 Keep the site safe and clean
 Deal with all the inspections and be responsible when an inspection 
is rejected
235
Chapter 15: Deciding between Doing It Yourself and Contracting

 Effect quality control
 Solve problems quickly and efficiently
You can save money by negotiating to do any of these items yourself. You can
do a design and find a contractor who will build accordingly. Or you can be
responsible for keeping the work site clean, and you can probably come to an
agreement that you assist on the job as much as possible. You may even find a
contractor who’ll let you do all the actual work but who will do the drawings,
permits, and inspections for you.
Getting bids
Always, always, always get multiple bids. Even if you’re planning on doing 
a project completely on your own, you should get bids. (I can hear from my
contractor friends that this wastes their time and that they resent it, but you
can get a lot of good, free information this way.) Let contractors know you’re
going out for competitive bids, and never make a commitment of any kind.
You may be able to find only a single contractor who can do the job you have
in mind. In this case, try to get some information about how much the job
costs in other locales so you have something to compare. The reality is that if
only a single contractor is doing solar installations in your area, you’re on thin
ice. Most likely, the contractors will be charging too much because they aren’t
competing.
The best bet is to ask friends who have the same kind of system you’re inter-
ested for referrals (or warnings to stay away, as the case may be). You can 
look contractors up with the Better Business Bureau, or you can get informa-
tion from state regulatory agencies. The Internet contains a lot of referral sites
(but beware — these may be paid for by the contractors themselves!). Type
the name of your city or county and the kind of project you want to do into
your search engine.
Never use family members or friends. You may think they’ll give you a better
price and better service, but you’ll probably regret such an arrangement. They
may be thinking they can charge you more because of the lack of competitive
bids or that they can work your job when it’s convenient because you won’t
fire them. Of course, if Uncle Roy the solar installer discovers you had a solar
installation done by one of his competitors, he may not show up for Christmas
dinner, so tread carefully. (On the other hand, maybe you don’t want Uncle Roy
around for Christmas dinner.)
236
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Comparing bids
After you get the bids, the problem becomes one of comparing apples to
apples, which is almost always difficult with solar because the industry is fairly
new and there are so many different ways to do things. Choosing the contrac-
tor comes down to three criteria, which I explain in the following sections.
Craftsmanship
To evaluate craftmanship, get referrals. Go to a site where the contractor has
completed a job and look at the solder joints, the weld joints, and the neat-
ness and simplicity of the installation. How long did it take? (Although time
may not seem important, it reveals experience and efficiency.) How long has
the contractor been in the business? Look at older installations as well as the
most recent.
If you can, find a job your potential contractors did that they don’t mention 
on their lists of references — then talk to the owner. That’s where you can find
some real information. All contractors can give you a list of happy references
and show you a pile of after-job surveys that are glowing and exuberant. But
what of the customers who aren’t on these lists? Ask contractors how many
jobs they’ve completed and then ask why there are so many fewer references.
(They won’t like this question!)
Make sure to ask about workmanship warranties. If contractors are offering
only the warranty that comes from the manufacturer, beware. Ask about
bonding, insurance, licenses, and so on. If your contractor doesn’t like these
questions, watch out. Good contractors are glad to hear these questions; 
it means their shady competitors will be weeded out.
Compatibility
Some contractors are just dubious characters, and some are living in a differ-
ent universe than you and I. The bottom line is that you want a contractor
who, when he sees your phone number on his caller ID system, is happy to
answer the phone.
Having a good relationship matters a lot. Not only does it foster cooperation
and increase the likelihood that problems will be ironed out quickly and effec-
tively, but a contractor who doesn’t like you simply isn’t going to go the extra
mile for you (that’s right — the feelings can go both ways). You may get the
work done as per spec, but you won’t get the extra time spent to get the pipe
joints just right. Or you won’t get your phone calls returned until it can’t be
put off anymore.
237
Chapter 15: Deciding between Doing It Yourself and Contracting

Your personality enters into the equation as well. Are you prone to nitpick and
micro manage? Are you impatient? In this vein, when you talk to references, ask
specific questions about personality issues. Is the contractor impatient? Will
she spend extra time explaining the process to you, or does she simply want to
be left alone to do her job? Will she show up at odd hours?
Cost
Cost is very important, but ultimately, it may be the least significant factor.
Why? So many things can go wrong, and problems generally add up to more
cost. If you get a bid that’s much lower than the other ones, beware. Your
contractor probably doesn’t understand what he’s doing, either technically
or competitively. Or maybe you’re getting a contractor with a much lower
overhead rate. Why? Does he not carry insurance? Is he working out of his
truck or off of his bicycle? Will he be around in three months to provide 
warranty coverage?
Interviewing a contractor
Contractors all want the job for the most amount of money they can get.
Here’s how to wade through the quicksand:
 Let the contractor do the talking during the interview. If you’re talking,
you’re not getting information. If you feel the need to convince a contractor
to do a job, you’re setting yourself up for a disappointment down the line
because these folks are generally good at smelling blood.
 Ask the same questions of each contractor.
 Ask contractors what they want and expect.
 Ask them what problems they foresee. If none at all, beware.
 Give a hypothetical scenario such as, “What if you’re halfway through
and find that the parts aren’t fitting together the way they’re supposed
to?” Or “What if you’re injured somehow?”
 Ask them whether they use multiple sources of supply. If they’re stuck
on one single system supplier, ask them why and whether they’d install
a system from another supplier if you were to purchase the material
yourself. Don’t exclude them if they refuse; just find out why.
 Ask whether they’re committed to finishing the project after they begin.
Be clear upfront that finishing the project is one of your requirements.
Ask them what can be done if a project stalls.
 Ask what conditions would merit tossing out the contract.
238
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Contracting
Let your contractor know that you’re very happy to have him doing your job.
Begin working with your contractor well before your contractor begins work
on your project.
When contracting, get everything in writing. And throughout the entire project,
clearly tell the contractors that everything will be in writing. Any decisions
made or changes made will be in writing only. E-mail is okay, but print out
e-mails and keep them in a file folder. I repeat: Get everything in writing. Get
everything in writing, all the time, always. It’s not that people are to be dis-
trusted, but verbal communication is like that children’s game “Telephone,” in
which the message gets garbled each time it’s spoken. Writing forces clearer
articulation.
In addition to a lot of verbiage and conditions that are generally boilerplate, 
a contract should include the following:
 Prices
 A schedule of events that the two of you can easily establish and
approve
 Cash flow (when payments are due, how much they are, and so on)
Be aware that contracts must be legal. In other words, neither you nor the
contractor can agree to do something that’s illegal. Also, a contract cannot
violate standard business practices, so something in the contract may simply
be unenforceable by the courts.
Never pay a contractor until the work is finished. The best bet is not to make
any payments at all until the entire job is finished. You may need to make
progress payments, but these need to be very well specified. For example, you
may pay 20 percent of the contract amount once the foundation for a sunroom
is laid. You pay another 20 percent when the frame is built. Another 20 percent
comes when the windows and walls are installed, and the final payment comes
when the final inspection is approved.
Working with a contractor 
after the job begins
When you’re on the go, you need to work with your contractor as effectively
as possible. Now is not the time to express doubt about her abilities. Now’s
239
Chapter 15: Deciding between Doing It Yourself and Contracting

the time to follow the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them
do unto you:
 Let her know that you think this is a two-way street. Of course she has
responsibilities, but so do you. When she knows that you understand
this, she’ll be more enthusiastic.
 Always be completely square and decisive. You may not want to express
disappointment about how a job is turning out, but you had better if that’s
what you’re feeling. Let your contractor know that that’s what you expect
of her as well. In my experience, playing word games always leads to
problems.
 Communicate routinely. Every morning, before work starts, go over the
project. Ask about problems. Ask about the schedule and the budget.
Ask, “What do you need from me?” Even if it’s only for a few minutes,
establishing the routine is worth the effort.
 Be friendly no matter what. Don’t get emotional. Problems happen; be
cool when they do, and your contractor will be more honest with you
about everything.
 Offer cold drinks. Make a cooler available. Go the extra mile.
 Don’t forget the need for a restroom. Make it nice and easy to get to, 
and keep it clean.
 Establish some ground rules that both of you must follow. When is it
okay to communicate? When shouldn’t you call? Who needs to keep
what clean? Should workers be allowed to use radios or remove their
shirts when it’s hot? Can they hose themselves down to cool off? Ask
them whether they have any ground rules they would like you to follow.

Greenhouses and Sunrooms
In This Chapter
 Deciding between the various solar room alternatives
 Exploiting the greenhouse and chimney effects
 Looking at some project types
 Arranging your solar room designs to maximize efficiency and effect
T
he two types of solar rooms are greenhouses and sunrooms. Greenhouses,
which are either connected to your house or separate, can help warm your
house as well as provide inexpensive, delicious, highly nutritious food or
beautiful, soothing, decorative plants. Sunrooms, which are always part of
your house, add living space and square footage to your home for a relatively
low cost, increase the efficiency of your heating and cooling efforts, and
brighten up the ambience and decor.
Most home additions cost more than your property value increases. But with
solar rooms, the greater design freedom and fewer building restrictions allow
you to enjoy immediately profitable appreciations, especially if you do it
yourself. You can get away with simple design elements that would never pass
muster in your house proper, which means designs can be imaginative and
nonconforming. And you can use inexpensive materials and support schemes
that wouldn’t work with the rest of your house. If you’re clever enough, and
patient, you can build a very nice solar room for next to nothing, which you
can’t say about any other room addition.
Every house is different, so no general design works universally. But all effective
solar rooms follow general principles that can help you get the most efficient
performance out of your new additions. If you’ve always wanted to make a
big do-it-yourself impact on the basic form and structure of your house, this
chapter tells you how to shine.

242
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 
Choosing a Type of Solar Room
The most basic difference between sunrooms and greenhouses is their func-
tion, namely whether you want to add comfortable living space for yourself
or your plants. The following sections expand on this idea, noting how func-
tion carries over to design.
Both greenhouses and sunrooms can increase a home’s privacy by providing
a buffer between the outside world and the interior spaces. Figure 16-1
demonstrates how an attached greenhouse can dramatically improve the
aesthetic attraction of a home, at a very low cost compared to other 
remodeling alternatives.
Growing green things
Greenhouses, whose main purpose is to support plant life, are very func-
tional. Here are some basic greenhouse requirements:
 They need to invite the maximum amount of sunlight, which generally
requires a glass ceiling or sloping glass walls.
 Their temperatures need to be regulated (the difference between the
hottest and coldest temperatures needs to be kept to a minimum, dic-
tated by the type of plants).
 They need adequate ventilation to provide oxygen for the plants.
 They need a water supply.
 The floors need to be able to withstand water leaks and mud spillage.
Figure 16-1:

Well-designed greenhouses in cold climates can support the growth of plants
all winter long, even in freezing conditions. In fact, greenhouses often need
cooling means such as vents or radiant barriers to keep from getting too hot.
On the other hand, greenhouses need to be sealed in order to maximize
warming in the winter, so the interior air can get stagnant or too humid for
comfort. The bottom line is that greenhouses need constant management and
manipulation of air movement and sun exposure, not to mention the work
needed to grow healthy, vigorous plants. Greenhouses are also prone to get-
ting very dirty, so they’re more commonly separated from the house.
Basking in the sunroom
Sunrooms are designed as extensions of your home’s living space. You can
put some plants inside if you want, or you can completely enclose them and
put in carpeting and fine furniture.
Leaving the doors and windows open between your house and a sunroom
can give a sense of increased floor space and size to your home. There’s no
cheaper way to increase the square footage of your home than by building a
solar room off your family room. In my own house, we practically live in our
solar room, and we eat dinner out there nearly every night. It’s the one project
that we all agree we couldn’t live without.
A well-designed sunroom can provide up to 60 percent of a home’s heating in
the winter, depending on the amount of sunlight available. Even in very cold
climates, a sunroom can work efficiently. And particularly in a cold climate, a
sunroom can provide needed relief from the gray doldrums of winter.
Such rooms generally have watertight roofs, which are usually solid. Too much
sunlight is uncomfortable, and ultimately, your sunroom needs to be comfortable
and inviting. Sunrooms can contain skylights and vents, and both increase the
livability factor. Sunrooms also exploit the greenhouse effect to great advantage,
but without plant growth, so managing the air quality and keeping things clean
are much easier. The goal is to provide a warming space in the winter and to
enhance a house’s spatial and light composition.
Exploiting Natural Effects
As with all solar projects, exploiting and enhancing the natural laws of
physics are the necessary starting points. The basic idea is to catch as much
solar radiation as possible during the day and then to keep that energy inside
and use it wisely at night.
243
Chapter 16: Glass Houses (and Plastic, Too): Greenhouses and Sunrooms

Understanding the greenhouse effect
Everybody’s heard of the greenhouse effect (see Figure 16-2); people invoke it
to explain global warming, which is one of the big reasons most people are
interested in solar energy in the first place. In this case, you want the green-
house effect to work to your benefit.
Greenhouses work by the fact that sunlight enters the space through the
windows (which may be plastic or glass or any transmission elements), gets
converted into heat by absorption, and then the heat is constrained to stay
within the space by insulation. Convection cooling is also greatly reduced
when the space is enclosed. (See Chapter 4 for more details.)
Sunlight enters the enclosed space through the glazing (window) and then gets
absorbed and stored as heat energy. The heat is then constrained to stay in
the enclosed space via the same glazing’s insulation properties, plus insulation
in the walls. You can enhance the greenhouse effect by increasing the amount
of radiation the window allows to enter while maximizing the glass’s insulation
against heat.
The space must be well sealed to prevent leakage, although the greenhouse
effect is often powerful enough to work well in relatively leaky environments.
In fact, sometimes it works so well you can’t tolerate all the heat.

Up, up, and away with the chimney effect
When air heats, it becomes lighter in weight. Cold air weighs more, and hence
gravity exerts a larger force on it. So the hot air rises, making the air in a room
warmer near the ceiling than the floor. The phenomenon is called the chimney
effect because of the way smoke goes up a chimney above a burning fire instead
of spreading out into the room. Cold air is drawn into the fire, and the hot air
rises quickly up the chimney. The air movement is brisk and consistent
because the effect is pronounced.
With most solar rooms, the vents are movable, which means you can easily open
or close them to take advantage of the chimney effect. When the solar room is
warmer than the house, the vents open, allowing heat from the sunroom to enter
the house (vice versa at night or on cold winter days). Or when the room’s just
too hot, you can completely close off the space from the rest of the house.
Figure 16-3 shows how a sunroom works.
Vent fans can enhance the chimney effect. Solar-powered ceiling fans work
well because they don’t need to be hard-wired (no code problems or
expenses associated with electricians), plus they work hardest when the sun
is hottest, which is usually what you want.

Solar powered vent fans efficiently positioned right into the vent openings can
also work to great advantage. Greenhouses can also be vented with solar-
powered fans, which work well when the greenhouse isn’t attached to the
house and has no electricity available. Solar-powered fans are also better
environmental solutions (see Chapter 13 for details).

As with all solar projects, kits are the best bet for the do-it-yourselfer, and a
big industry is dedicated to manufacturing and selling prefabricated kits for
costs anywhere between a few hundred dollars to hundreds of thousands. For
example, small greenhouses made of plastic tarp (greenhouse film) and semi-
circular aluminum frame elements are great for growing food — no building
code, no hassle. They’re very cheap, starting at around $300. You can get
options such as automatic vents, automatic watering systems, blinds and
reflectors, and so on.
Extruded aluminum frame sunrooms are common, and their availability is
proliferating as costs decrease. You can build them with all windows, or for
better structural integrity and some relief from bright sunshine, with insulated
fiberglass panels interspersed with windows. They usually have solid,
insulated roofs to give the space more of an interior feel.
Prices start at around $10,000 for complete do-it-yourself kits and can go much
higher. Installations aren’t that expensive, so you should get a quote for doing
it yourself versus contracting, factoring in how much work installing it yourself
would take. Contractors come in and put these things up in a few short days,
and they know the ins and outs of getting permits and the like (when working
with contractors, building the project outside of the permit process is almost
impossible — see Chapter 15). People who get these sunrooms are generally
very happy with the result and recommend them to their friends and neighbors.
For the money, if you’re a do-it-yourselfer, a custom design can add the most
visual appeal to your home. But you can still get kits of windows and wall
materials to make things easier. Look on the Internet and in the phone book
for ideas. You can get books for greenhouses and sunrooms in big hardware
stores or through bookstores, both tangible and online. If you’re patient and
spend enough time on research and design, you can do a very good job and
you’ll be happy with the result, both functionally and aesthetically.

Getting the Most Out of Your Design
Solar rooms all have the same basic fundamental components. There are a
million ways to build a solar room, but some practical generalizations can
ensure a successful project. In this section, I explain the basic components of
a solar room and give you some tips on building and design.
Anatomy of a solar room
Solar rooms all have the same basic components. The following sections
explain the functional elements of an ideal solar room (also see Figure 16-4).
The transparent cover (also referred to as glazing, or windows) allow for sun-
light entry. The rock pile is thermal mass, which stores heat and serves to reg-
ulate a consistent temperature in the space. A reflective wall lining is optional;
it serves to reflect sunlight down onto the thermal mass and plants. Insulated
north wall is also optional; the insulation works with the thermal mass to keep
heat in the space and maintain a consistent internal temperature.
Letting some sun shine in
As with all solar systems, a collector, or transparent cover, allows sunlight to
enter. The larger the area, the more energy captured. You can control seasonal
and daily variation by orienting the collector’s east/west direction (azimuth)

and altitude (upward angle toward the sky). You can also maximize sunlight in
the morning (good for comfort and generally good for sunrooms because you
want a warm space early in the morning, and afternoon sunlight is often too
harsh and hot for comfort) or in the heat of the afternoon (best for maximum
heat capture). Chapter 5 explains more about available sunlight.
Commercial greenhouses are usually made with glass ceilings (roofs), but you
can get the same open effect by angling the window glass (see Figure 16-4).
Double-pane glass works well as a collector, and a number of window coat-
ings and other optical engineering methods can also work to good effect
because they allow light to pass through but also insulate for heat. Some
inexpensive plastic materials also work well, though they tend to blur the
view, so they’re generally more suitable for greenhouses than sunrooms.
Greenhouses often have solar reflectors mounted into their roofs in the summer
because there’s just plain too much sunlight. You can choose from a range of
clever movable insulation methods, such as a blind mechanism loaded with
radiant barrier reflective material (see Chapter 9). Hoods, overhangs, and
awnings can also control the seasonal and daily variation of sunlight. Window
blinds are often used in solar rooms to prevent heat escape at night, to keep
the room from getting too hot in the summer, or to enhance privacy. They also
make the room much more attractive.
Keeping the heat
After the sunlight enters the space, an absorber captures the energy and
transforms it into heat. Dark, rough surfaces — such as gravel floors in a
greenhouse or dark furniture and carpet in a sunroom — work best.
Heat storage is accomplished via thermal mass and material (see Chapter 4).
Rocks are cheap and work well, and water is a good choice because it’s cheap,
holds heat, and is readily available. For maximum functional effect, drums filled
with water may be painted black and set in the direct sunlight. The storage
means is almost always located directly below or behind the absorber, and in
many instances, it can be the same thing. Figure 16-5 shows some heat storage
methods. A water wall is a rectangular space filled with water; it’s more common
to see individual drums stacked on top of each other than an entire wall
made to hold water; either option works well. The only thing that matters is
how much mass is present. In either case, take care to close off the water to pre-
vent evaporation and keep mosquitoes from laying eggs in the stagnant water.
Sunrooms don’t require as much thermal mass because you can close them
off from the house when needed. However, if you want to maintain maximum
comfort around the clock, some form of heat storage is a good idea. Concrete
floors are good solutions because they provide not only mass but also a
good, solid underpinning to the room.

Putting heat on the move
Heat distribution systems move the heat, as appropriate. The best methods
exploit the chimney effect (the idea that heat rises), but fans and vents are
also effective, if designed properly. Keep in mind that heat can be moved by
conduction, convection, or radiation (see Chapter 4). Always work with the
natural movement of air (see Chapter 13), especially your prevailing winds.
Control mechanisms decide when and how to move the heat. Fans may be
switched, vents may be opened and closed, thermostats may switch off 
and on at preset temperatures, and so on. In most applications, you’re the
controller — you decide when to open and close windows and vents and blinds.
If you’d rather opt for non-electrical means, an automatic vent opener — a
compact, mechanical, heat-activated device — can open windows, skylights,
greenhouse vents, and so on at a temperature you select. Because they don’t
use electricity, you can mount them anywhere. For heavy windows and vents,
simply use multiple units.
Following design and building tips
A do-it-yourselfer can design and build a solar room for a relatively low cost,
with relatively low risk. You don’t need electrical wiring or plumbing, and you
don’t need to obey all the building code requirements that are unavoidable
inside of a house.
You can work through a project without having to apply for building permits
or to have the property value reappraised (with the commensurate increase
in property taxes). Simply build the room against the house, but don’t actu-
ally connect it to the house proper (no electricity, water, or continuous wall
connections) — in this case, it’s just a porch. Keep in mind, however, that
when you don’t go through the permit process, you can’t advertise your solar
room as part of the square footage of the actual house. This may or may not
matter to potential buyers, who’ll appraise the value on their own terms
when they take a tour with their realtor. To be sure, check with a local realtor
and get his or her opinion of your local situation.
Location and surroundings
Before you get into the details of design, you should make some decisions
about where you want the room and what kind of environment you want to
create. Always build your sunroom on a southern front (although eastern
sunrooms are popular as well for breakfast niches). Put the absorbers and
thermal mass on the north side, at the back of the room. If you can’t, your
room will still work but not to maximum advantage.
250
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

The best location in your house is adjacent to the kitchen for attached green-
houses and adjacent to the living room or family room for sunrooms. These
locations afford not only the most efficient use but also the most use in general.
Try to use as much of your home’s existing walls as possible, preferably on
both the east-and-west end of the sunroom. These walls are already insulated,
and they match the house.
An easy and straightforward candidate for solar rooms are existing porches
and decks that already have the basic support structures and flooring in
place. All you need to do is build up and around.
As for surroundings, you may want to plant deciduous trees at the same time
as the building of your solar room. Sometimes solar rooms can get too hot in
the summer. In particular, western trees block the harsh late afternoon sun. You
can cut back the sun in the summer and allow it all in during the winter. Plus the
room will be much prettier if you can look out at a nice tree. Partnering with
Mother Nature gives a certain continuity to the entire project. (See Chapter 8 for
more details on how to plan your landscaping.)
Materials and design
Kits are widely available for both greenhouses and sunrooms. You can find
showrooms where samples are available, so try to touch things before you
buy; photos are often misleading and rarely reflect reality the way you expect.
Of course, you may want to design your own solar room. As much as a well-
designed solar room can enhance your house’s aesthetics, a poorly designed
one can make your house look awkward and uninviting. Make very good
drawings done to scale before you begin building (use graph paper and let 
1 inch of graph paper represent 1 foot). Consider all the angles, and if you
can, draw some different perspectives (from the street, for example). The
more thought you give to the appearance before you start, the better the
odds that your solar room will increase the value of your home.
As you draw your design and try to figure out what materials you want to use
for your glazing, remember these tips:
 Sloped glazing allows for more sunlight entry, but it also gets much dirtier
and is leakier and harder to install.
The do-it-yourselfer should avoid horizontal glass because it can be dan-
gerous if it breaks and therefore takes special engineering techniques to
ensure integrity.
 In cold climates, use between 0.65 and 1.5 square feet of double-pane glass
for each square foot of building floor area. In temperate climates, use
between 0.3 to 0.9 square feet for each square foot of building floor area.
251
Chapter 16: Glass Houses (and Plastic, Too): Greenhouses and Sunrooms

In practical terms, don’t worry if you can’t achieve these ratios. Anything
will work to your advantage. Solar rooms are usually compromises between
the best physics and the best aesthetics and cost. In general, aesthetics
should win for sunrooms, functionality should win for greenhouses.
 Glass shops often do retrofits of entire houses; they remove the old win-
dows and install new ones. You can buy the old windows for next to
nothing (they’re usually single pane, but if they’re almost free, you can’t
complain). Reusing such glass may lend a discontinuous visual effect, so
be prepared to add some paint or other finishes.
 A lot of new plastic materials are very effective at glazing. These materials
are unsuitable in your house, but they’re okay in a solar room. If you’re
building a strictly functional greenhouse, you can use corrugated plastic
roofing panels on both the roof and sides. These make for very easy
designs and construction because you can nail everything up very easily,
plus it comes with foam sealant strips that are very effective and cheap.
You can use the clear stuff — or the somewhat transparent green stuff if
your climate is too sunny and hot for full exposure. Greenhouse kits made
of plastic sheets instead of windows are also easy, cheap, and effective.
If possible, use the same roofing and siding and window materials that your
house is made of for better aesthetics. If you can’t, don’t try to match at all —
just do something that’s complementary but totally disparate. Nothing mis-
matches more than an attempt at matching that doesn’t quite cut it. This is
like matching clothes; blue and orange match up much better than orange
and a little bit different orange, which just ends up looking cheap.
Especially in a greenhouse, make sure that you pay attention to ventilation.
Chapter 13 can tell you more about fans and ventilation schemes.
Cleanliness
You may be able to tolerate dirty windows in the rest of your house, but solar
rooms have a tendency to magnify imperfections. Let the sun shine in!
Plan on devising a good, efficient, easy method of washing the windows often.
Keep good-quality squeegees on hand (get long poles), and allow for drainage
of ammoniated chemicals below (don’t put sensitive plants directly beneath
the windows because they’ll get the chemicals into their root systems). Don’t
wash windows with a hose attachment; otherwise, you’ll end up with water
sediment building up and streaking.

nstalling a full-scale intertie system at your home is the king of solar invest-
ments. You can offset your entire electric bill, at essentially zero pollution.
The cost is high, more than $8,000 anywhere up to $100,000. For some, it’s a
simple decision because the main goal is to eliminate pollution. For most readers,
payback is an important consideration. I use an example to illustrate the scope
of the problem. While the concepts are somewhat technical, they are intuitive,
so forge ahead with the realization that you can understand this subject as well
as an engineer.
Once you install a PV system, you have little maintenance. You may want to
change your consumption habits, though. For the most part, you can install
PV panels on your roof and forget about them. (In Chapter 22, I describe a
finance system where the PV system isn’t even at your home; it’s at a remote
location somewhere, and you’re simply benefiting from its production.)
There are two basic types of PV systems:
 Intertie, which work in conjunction with the utility grid
 Standalone, which require batteries and other special support hardware
In this chapter, I restrict the discussion to intertie systems because they
comprise the vast majority of installations. In Chapter 18, I address stand-
alone systems. Even for those only interested in standalone, I recommend a
quick breeze through this chapter so that you understand some of the basics
of PV systems in general.

254
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 
Like a capital expenditure for a business, a PV system is an investment tool,
not just a simple investment that you can ignore while it makes you money.
You must use the tool wisely and optimally for it to pay off, so you need to
know the ins and outs both before and after you buy your system. This chap-
ter can get you started on what you need to specify and contract to have a
PV system professionally installed in your home.
Almost all PV systems connected to the utility are professionally installed. You
can install a system yourself if you want to, but there are a whole range of
reasons not to, which I explain in detail in Chapter 7. In particular, you are not
allowed to connect to the grid yourself; you need the power company to do that.
The Benefits of Powering Your
Home with PV Systems
At this point in time, a majority of PV system buyers are more interested 
in pollution mitigation than gross return on investment. Few other invest-
ments can positively impact the environment as much as an intertie 
(utility-connected) PV system. But in many cases, a PV system is also a 
better financial investment than most other investment options. Here’s 
a short list of PV system advantages:
 Subsidies: Government has a vested interest in promoting solar power
because of its overwhelmingly positive environmental impact, as well as
the desirable political impact of energy independence (getting free of
imported oil, in other words). The best way to promote solar power, of
course, is to get more people to invest in it, and the best way to do that
is to subsidize it.
Subsidies, rebates, and tax breaks are widespread, and they’re becoming
more prevalent every day. In some parts of the country, the total discount
on a system cost can be more than 50 percent. Pay too many taxes? Why
not get something back from the government for a change? Perhaps there
is a free lunch after all. For more on subsidies, see Chapter 21.
 Pollution mitigation: You can literally erase more than 40,000 pounds of
carbon dioxide a year by going with a large-scale PV system. And if you’re
hooked up to the utility’s power grid, whenever you’re not using the power
you generate, someone else is, so you’re offsetting another person’s
carbon footprint as well — see the next section for details.
 Hedging: All investments require you to predict the future. If you think
energy costs are going to rise quite a bit, solar power is a very wise
option. When you bring your power bills down to an average of zero,
they’ll stay there regardless of how much energy costs rise. This is a

very powerful form of portfolio management called hedging, in which
you not only get a good return on your investment but also ensure that
regardless of what happens in the future, your investment will still pay
off. In fact, the more energy costs rise, the better your original investment
in solar will turn out to be.
If the government gets serious about lowering greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, it’s going to tax consumption and subsidize solar power
and other pollution-free solutions. These taxes make solar a better
investment because the higher costs won’t impact you.
 Lifestyle insurance: When energy costs rise, people with solar power will
still be able to use the same amount of energy they were using previously.
Unused solar capacity is a waste of your investment dollar, so you may
as well use the capacity you have. Those without solar will be scrambling
to conserve or scrambling to buy solar (which makes your equipment
more valuable). You not only ensure financial security, but you also
ensure lifestyle security when you invest in solar.
 Appreciation: Your property value can increase by more than the cost
of your original PV investment — without raising your property taxes
(see Chapter 6)! Not only will you save on monthly power bills, but you’ll
see an immediate increase in your home’s value.
 Intangibles: PV customers enjoy many intangible benefits. It’s fun to see
your power meter go backwards (take that, utility company!). It’s encour-
aging to know that you’re doing your fair share to mitigate global warm-
ing. It’s comforting to know your future is more secure. And let’s face it:
Solar power is cool. When you put panels on your roof, people notice,
and they’ll be nicer to you. Well, maybe . . .
Intertie: Hooking Up for a Little
Electrical Give and Take
In most cases, the financial viability of a PV investment hinges on whether
you can install an intertie system for a number of reasons. Each reason is
important for you to understand because it not only impacts your payback
analysis, but suggests that you adjust your energy consumption habits in
order to optimize your payback.
Here’s the basic idea behind intertie. You install a PV system at your house,
which connects to your household electrical system. Simple, so far. With an
intertie system, when your PV panels are generating more electrical power
than your house is using, your meter essentially spins backwards because
your excess power is going right back into the utility grid and being used by
255
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

somebody else connected to the grid. It’s like a big bank account; you can
withdraw or make deposits. If you can’t go intertie, your only other recourse
is to install a big bank of batteries, which is uneconomical.
Intertie is such an important concept that state and federal governments are
legislating that utility companies must allow their solar-producing customers
to tie in with these systems. Utility companies don’t necessarily want these
types of customers; their technical risk increases, and their revenues
decrease. In some states, the utilities must pay you the exact same rate that
they charge their customers for power. In other states, the utilities pay you
less, but this situation is changing with legislation. It would not be a stretch
to say that the viability of the entire PV industry depends on intertie.
One other point: Contrary to popular belief, most intertie systems will not
work when the grid is down. This concept is counterintuitive. You install your
own power production equipment, so you should be able to have power
regardless. But the fact is, the utilities do not want you putting power onto
the grid when the grid is down because it endangers line workers and may
actually destroy transformers and other power equipment. The safest and
best way to eliminate this risk is to insist that PV intertie producers use
equipment that will not operate when the grid is down. But it’s not really
much of a constraint because power outages are rare and usually occur at
night when your PV system is not producing power. You can, however, pur-
chase PV systems that will work during power outages, but they’re more
expensive and probably aren’t worth the extra cost.
Selling your power makes the difference
When PV first came onto the market, the energy consumed in the production
process for PV panels was greater than the energy that the panel could put out
in its lifetime. This contradiction was acceptable for NASA applications but not
at all economical for residential consumers. Over time, costs decreased to the
point where solar power became a viable financial investment but only under
the best circumstances. In order to encourage widespread use, the government
stepped in and initiated subsidies and tax breaks. But the biggest benefit of all
came when net metering was legislated into law.
Net metering means that you can sell your excess power back to the utility
company. If your solar PV system generates more power than you use, the
excess is fed back up the power wires to some other customer. Your power
meter literally spins backwards!
Why net metering is tops
Why is equitable net metering so great for PV system economics? Every solar
system, whether PV, water heating, an so on, has a certain maximum capacity.
256
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

This depends on the size of the system, of course, but it also depends on
other factors, such as the orientation and location of the solar collectors 
and how much sunlight is available (see Chapter 5). On a cloudy day, system
capacity is much less than on a sunny day. On a hot, summer day, the capacity
can be very large.
The point is that solar systems don’t put out consistent power from minute
to minute, day to day, or season to season. So the problem with a standalone
system (which isn’t connected to the grid like an intertie system) is that you
get wildly fluctuating energy outputs, which makes it very difficult to operate
your household because you can’t assume how much energy you’ll have
available. But when you tie into the grid, you can use as much power as you
want, whenever you want, and your PV system is merely contributing when-
ever it can. Picture it like a bank. You put money in during the day, when the
sun is shining, and then later on you can make withdrawals.
System utilization is an efficiency standard. How much of your system capac-
ity are you actually using? The greater the utilization, the better the financial
investment because you’re reaping more of a return. If your solar energy
system is sitting idle half the time, it’s a big waste. For example, a solar water
heater is useless when you’re on vacation because its capacity is entirely
wasted. The same is true for a standalone PV system.
But when you’re tied to the grid, your utilization is always 100 percent because
every bit of power your system generates is used. When you’re on vacation,
you’re using no power but still generating the same amount, which is all sold
back to the utility. The intertie system is actually making your vacation cheaper!
A little help from Uncle Sam: Making sure the utilities play fair
Why was net metering made into law? Utility companies are like any other
company — they want to grow and make more profits. It’s not in their inter-
est to promote solar energy because it cuts into their market. Imagine if
everybody were to go solar — the utility companies would dry up and blow
away (yes!). So utilities aren’t particularly interested in allowing you to con-
nect to their power grid. So at first, they refused to allow solar power genera-
tors to connect to their grids. And then they refused to pay fair prices for the
excess power. They charged more for the power they sold than they paid for
the power they bought. (Too bad we can’t all get in on that game!)
But now, under most net-metering laws, utility companies must pay you the
same retail rate they charge their own customers for power. This means they
can’t gouge you (although they’d like to).
257
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

Reaping net-metering rewards 
with time-of-use rates
In some regions, net metering is even more advantageous because the utilities
have what’s called time-of-use (TOU) rate scheduling in which electricity 
rates are highest from noon until 6:00 p.m. (peak time). (For info on other 
rate structures, see the later section called “Working with different utility rate
structures.”) The rate during this period can be over three times the rate at other
times (off-peak). This rate scheduling works extremely well for intertie PV systems
because that’s when they generate a majority of their power (remember, by law
the utilities often must pay you the same rate they’re charging for power, so at
peak times, they must pay you peak rates). Figure 17-1 shows how this works.
To illustrate an important point, assume that you produce all your solar
power during peak hours but use none during that same time period. Say the
peak rate is three times the off-peak rate. This means that if you sell 10 kWh
of energy to the utility company during peak hours and use 30 kWh during
off-peak, your power bill will be net zero. This, in turn, means that you can
purchase a much smaller PV system than your monthly power bill would
imply if your goal is to wipe out your entire power bill. For example, if your
monthly power usage is 1,000 kWh, you can install a solar PV system that
puts out only 11 kWh per day. This is obviously much cheaper than a system
that puts out 33 kWh per day, which is what you’d need if there were no TOU
rate structure.
In realistic situations, a three-times peak-to-base rate yields more like a 1.5
ratio of system sizing (but this is still significant because PV is expensive).
It’s like putting a dollar in the bank and getting back $1.50 later that night.

The TOU structure nicely illustrates what I mean by solar PV being an
investment tool — you must change your power usage habits in order to
capitalize on the advantage. The harder you work your investment, the better
it pays off.
For you aspiring entrepreneurs out there who just had a light bulb go off in
your head, there is a proviso. Most intertie rule structures preclude the util-
ity from actually paying you for excess power over the average of an entire
year. At the end of one year, they calculate how much you owe, or vice versa.
But if they owe you, they simply erase that from the books, and you get noth-
ing. Therefore, if you purchase a system that’s larger than your needs, the
excess is completely wasted (at least from your standpoint — the utility
loves it). Financially, the biggest mistake you can make is to install a system
that’s too large. However, this erasing of the utility’s debts may change at
some point because it’s in society’s best interest to reap as much solar-
generated electricity as possible.
If your biggest interest is pollution mitigation, keep in mind that choosing
your system based on TOU rate structures doesn’t save as much pollution.
For example, if your total energy consumption is 1,000 kWh per month and
you’re installing a small system with the expectation that you’ll exploit the
TOU advantage, the pollution savings will be only for the power you gener-
ate. If you’re getting back twice as much power from the utility than you’re
generating, then you’re not saving your entire energy consumption worth of
pollution, only half. From a pollution standpoint, only how the energy is gen-
erated, not what time of day the energy is generated, makes any difference.
Understanding the Basic Parts 
of Every PV System
Most solar systems are complex, even if they’re inexpensive. A solar water
heater includes a pump, pipes, temperature probes, electrical connections,
liquid valves and controls and so on. But an intertie solar PV system is actu-
ally very simple, despite its high cost (see Figure 17-2).
PV modules generally go on your roof, although you can mount them anywhere
space permits. (Chapter 5 addresses where you should place the PV modules.)
An inverter (usually mounted in your garage or near your power meter) con-
verts the DC voltages from the PV modules into AC voltages that are compatible
with both your household AC current, and the grid power coming in from the
utility.
259
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

A number of junction boxes, along with suitable wiring, complete the system.
You already have a main fusebox. When your intertie system is installed, the
workers simply wire into an existing fuse location, and you’re online, so to speak.
The following sections describe the various parts of a solar PV system.
PV panels
PV panels, which cost around $5 per watt, are the single biggest expense. For a
typical installation, PV panels comprise around 60 percent of a system cost, and
they take up the most space as well. Be aware that PV modules are temperature
sensitive; when the weather gets hot, power output goes down. Systems often
output more power on a cold, clear winter day than a hot, muggy summer day,
despite the fact that there’s a lot more sunshine on a summer day.
If you have an option between a breezy location and a stagnant location, the
breezy location will give you more energy output because of convection cooling,
everything else being equal.
Different types of panels are finding their way onto the market. The technologies
aren’t important to you, the end user, but the configurations (how they’re
combined physically will govern how much space they take, and how they take
that space) may be. Some panels are flexible, and some can be mounted

directly over tiled roofs. Some panels are made into roofing shingles, so you
simply put them up over the trusses, and you don’t need shingles. A lot of new
technologies become available all the time, but most of them are going to
need some maturation to compete with the tried-and-true flat panels.
Most panels are blue; some are black. Color doesn’t matter much. You can
compare the performances of individual panels, but it doesn’t do a lot of
good because ultimately what you’re after is system performance, and that
depends on how well the components work together and other factors.
One thing you do need to be concerned with is warranty, and in this vein,
manufacturer reputation and longevity. Most PV panel warranties are for 
25 years, but beware; panels degrade over time. System warranties specify
only a percentage of original power output over time, say 80 percent after 
20 years. Over time, your system will put out less and less energy; it’s
inevitable.
You can research a host of other specifications to your heart’s content. (In
fact, you can get a PhD in solar panels if that’s your cup of tea.)
Mounting equipment
Ground-mounted systems are more expensive than roof-mounted systems
because they require concrete posts and special frames. On the other hand,
you can orient the panels any way you want, and so the extra cost may be
offset by the increased production of the system (see Chapter 5 for details on
solar potential).
Disconnect switch
Disconnect switches are of critical importance, and they need to be mounted
within easy reach. Every member of your family should know exactly how to
turn the PV system off for safety reasons. If there is any abnormal behavior in
your homes electrical system, shut off the solar system first. Most disconnect
switches also have fuses that will prevent equipment damage.
DC-to-AC inverters
Inverters are the next-biggest expense after PV panels. Inverters take the low-
voltage, high-current signals from the PV panels and change them into 120VAC,
261
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

which is directly compatible with grid power. Inverters cost around $0.50 per
watt, or around $2,000 for a typical installation. Options include the following:
 Monitoring functions aren’t strictly necessary, but they’re interesting and
can tell you how your system is working. The simplest are a display on
the inverter that shows how much power is being produced at any given
time. Then you can get a reading of total generated power, either weekly,
daily, or lifetime. You can get an inverter with a remote monitoring station
that you can put inside your house so that you can read it without going
into the garage (or wherever the inverter is installed). And, of course, you
can get a monitor that connects to your computer so that you can call up
on the Internet, even when you’re at work, to find out how your system is
working. These latter systems also provide you with an opportunity to do
all sorts of complicated calculations on, say, how much carbon dioxide you
are saving. In general, you pay more for the monitoring functions, and they
don’t change your production, so they can only decrease the attractiveness
of your investment.
 Safety features include switches and fuses that prevent dangerous situa-
tions from turning into reality.
 Expandability ports are often wise. You can purchase a larger capacity
inverter than what you currently plan on installing so that later on, in a
few years, you can add PV modules.
 You can buy an inverter that works when the grid power is shut off, but
these cost a lot more because they are rare (no economies of scale), and
the utilities don’t want them. They have to be manually switched into
the off-grid mode, however, so if a power failure occurs, you still have
interruption. If the power failure is at night, when you have no system
production because there’s no sunlight, the feature is useless.
 The most popular feature is a digital display that tells you exactly how
much power your system is producing.
Efficiency is an important factor; any inefficiency is wasted energy, which
gets turned into heat. Inverters can get very hot, particularly on the sunniest
summer days when production is maximum. Where you physically locate an
inverter may be important.
If you plan to expand your system in the future, buy a larger inverter than
you need.
Wiring and fuse box connections
Wiring, conduit, and connections to your household main fuse box are minor
expenses, but they comprise a big chunk of the labor for installation. You
want the installers to hide the conduits if they can. Long wire runs cost more
because the wire is generally heavy gauge.
262
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Utility power meters
Power meters are usually provided by the utility company when the service-
persons come to your house to inspect your system and connect it to the grid.
Conventional power meters are capable of spinning backwards, but the utility
commonly changes to a special digital meter when you connect to the grid
because almost all solar customers go to the TOU rate structure, which requires
more intelligent processing than a mechanical device is capable of (see the
earlier section titled “Reaping net-metering rewards with time-of-use rates”). 
You look at the display, and it tells you whether you’re spinning forwards or
backwards (though the word spinning is obsolete with the digital meters). The
utility company may charge you for the meter and the installation, as well as a
hookup fee. C’est la vie.
Evaluating Your Hardware
As with any hardware, you can nitpick the details and dissect the perfor-
mances of individual components in order to compare operations and effi-
ciencies. But if you purchase your system from a quality contractor, the staff
will have chosen the best equipment for you simply because it’s in their best
interest. (You don’t need the technical details, but if you want to study them,
get data sheets from the contractors and go for it.)
Reliability is of utmost importance, but you can’t get this from a data sheet.
Keep in mind that when you’re connected to the grid, if your system goes
down, it’s costing you money by virtue of the fact that it’s not making you any
money (like any capital equipment). Reliability is critical, along with a good
contractor who’ll respond to problems quickly and efficiently.
Testing standards are not universal, making it difficult to compare data
sheets because you may be comparing apples to oranges. Furthermore, when
you look at individual data sheets, deducing system performance is very diffi-
cult. Once again, it’s best to trust your contractor to integrate the best parts
into the best system.
Purchase only systems (not just individual components, but systems) that have
proven track records. (Ask your contractor about this; he may push a brand
new system, but you should avoid anything brand new.) You can also consult
the usual consumer guides for brand reputation. This is tough because the
industry is evolving rapidly and new products are constantly coming out with
better performance promises. But talk is cheap, and when you’re spending as
much money as a PV system costs, you should be conservative. Buy the
tortoise, not the hare.
263
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

STC means standard test conditions, which are laboratory conditions under
which a device is tested. PTC means practical test conditions, and the fact that
these even exist implies that STC is not very realistic. Rule of thumb: Expect
only around 75 percent of the performance promised under STC. A 200 W
module will give you only 150 W under real conditions. (How do they get
away with this, shall we say, euphemistic approach? Well, how do burger
joints get away with those advertisements of massive burgers so big they
bulge out of the bun and need to be served with a forklift?)
This brings up a fundamental problem, which is rather unique to the solar
industry: Contractors fudge on their guarantees; they have no choice. When
you purchase a system from a contractor, your contract includes some kind of
performance clause. It has to, or else you wouldn’t have a contract. But you
can never tell with solar power because performance depends on so many
uncontrollable factors, such as sunshine, air quality, utilization, and so on.
But where does that leave you? Suppose you buy a system, and it’s not doing
what the projections indicated. You go back to the contractor, and they say 
it’s not their fault. But let’s be cynical for a moment. Assume you have an
unscrupulous contractor who understands that you’re going to take the lowest
bid for the job. So these people bid a system that they know isn’t going to
produce as much as you need because they can bid cheaper this way and get
the job. After the system is in and you discover the system is too small, there’s
little you can do aside from rue the day you signed with that contractor.
The moral of the story? Know the technology, understand the process for
yourself, and find a contractor you can trust. For some tips on doing research
and getting bids, check out Chapter 15.
Installing a PV System in a Nutshell
You don’t want to hurry your decision-making, so expect the entire process
of installing a full-scale PV system to take 90 days or more. Too much money
is at stake, and you want to make sure that you’re doing everything just right.
There are also delays inherent in getting building permits, rebate approvals,
and so on. One hundred twenty days is more realistic, and if you’re truly seri-
ous about conserving and altering your energy consumption patterns, you
can expect the process to take six months. Here’s a list of all the things you
need to do:
1. Perform an energy audit and take conservation steps (see Chapters 2
and 3).
Before you even get started on your solar system, you need to figure 
out exactly how much energy you’re using and where it’s going. This is
264
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

particularly important when you’re signing up for a time-of-use (TOU)
rate structure because you’ll be able to glean a lot of little insights on
how to use power differently at different times of the day.
Some states require an energy audit before you can buy a solar system.
California is making this a requirement if you want to collect their siz-
able rebate. Why? It’s not really in the interest of your contractor to help
you reduce your power consumption because that means they’ll be sell-
ing you a smaller system. But you get a much better payback by con-
serving prior to buying a big PV system. Plus it’s in society’s best
interest to use as little power as possible. Hey, the government is subsi-
dizing you, so they have a right to tell you what to do — and besides,
they’re right.
2. Decide how much to invest and how to finance it.
During the course of your energy audit you collect a lot of financial infor-
mation regarding energy costs and how they accrue in your household.
You must also collect cost and performance estimates for PV systems,
including the following:
• PV system costs, lifetimes, expansion potentials, warranty, and
so on: The best bet is to call contractors and have a preliminary
conversation about these issues. They’ll know all the rebates, sub-
sidies and tax credits because it helps them sell systems. They’ll
come to your house and be very nice about assisting you because
they know this is a big investment, and they’re going to have to do
a bang-up sales job. Don’t be shy about exercising these people —
if they don’t want to help you and answer difficult questions, find
somebody who will.
• Rate structures: Find out which structures you’ll qualify for after
the equipment is in place. Your current structure may not be applic-
able anymore. Can you change structures later if you don’t like the
one you’re in? Can your utility company change structures on you
later? You may find yourself in a real bind if you install a system
under a certain rate structure but then you get a nice letter from
your utility informing you that they’re changing your status. (For
more on rate structures, see the upcoming section titled “Working
with different utility rate structures” and Chapter 6.)
• Review the physical installation options: How much roof space
will a system take up? Do you have a suitable roof, facing approxi-
mately south? If not, you may have to ground mount, which is
more expensive, plus visually questionable for the neighbors. What
condition is your roof in? If you need a new roof, you should proba-
bly take care of that first, because the roof job will be a lot more
expensive if you have to have the PV panels removed (the roofers
will certainly not do it) by a contractor and then replaced at the
end of the job.
265
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

• Work out the cash flow for the investment: You’ll probably have
to make a down payment (typically $1,000) at contract signing.
Then you’ll have to pay somewhere like half the remaining balance
at the beginning of installation. As soon as the system is in place,
the other half is due. Make sure to find out when the system will
begin producing power. You may have a gap in time between your
last payment to the contractor and the utility approving your
system, at which point you can turn it on.
You won’t accrue the benefit of tax breaks until your next tax filing,
which can take over a year or more. Are rebates payable to you or
the contractor? In California, rebates are paid directly to the con-
tractor, so they’re not a part of your cash flow at all.
• Financing options and costs: Chapters 21 and 22 can fill you in on
subsidies and loans.
3. Locate contractors and go out for formal bids.
Talk to as many contractors as you can. Get them to come to your house
and look at your situation in some detail. They can’t give you an accu-
rate quote until they do. If they quote you a price over the phone, it’s
only an approximation. If they tell you it’s not, say goodbye right before
you hang up.
4. Choose the best contractor and write the contract.
At this point, you’ll probably have to write a check for a down payment.
For more on choosing a contractor, see Chapter 15.
5. Wait for equipment to arrive (it’s rarely stock), approvals for building
permits, subsidies, tax breaks and so on.
Expect this to take up to six weeks or more.
6. Allow for installation and inspections by the county and utility company.
Installations typically take a couple of days. The county inspectors will look
at your system and certify it. The utility company is very concerned with
your system because you’ll be feeding potentially dangerous power back
into their grid. If a utility employee is working on the grid somewhere
nearby, he or she could get a nasty shock from your system if it’s not
shut down.
7. Wait for the utility to put in a new meter and connect to the grid.
When everything is ready, the utility company installs a new power
meter and officially hooks you up. Now you’re in the power generating
business. Woohoo!
8. Get a tutorial on how to operate your system.
Your contractor needs to walk you through the entire system and explain
the hazards and proper operation. You should be aware of potential
266
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

problems and how to identify them. At this point, you can watch the dis-
play on your inverter cranking out numbers. Your contractor should
explain exactly what the numbers mean.
9. Submit any paperwork to utilities, states, and so on for final rebate
payments.
Rebates aren’t payable until the system is in place and working properly.
If your contractor is receiving the rebate directly, you don’t need to do
anything. If you’re receiving it, you want to get it as fast as you can.
10. Change your household habits to optimize system payback.
Up to this point, everything has been educated speculation. Now reality
sets in. Is your system operating the way it should? The way it’s capa-
ble? Are you using power at the right times of the day? Are your savings
what you thought they should be? If you’re on a tiered rate structure, or
a TOU rate structure, you will probably need to change some of your
consumption habits in order to capitalize. Talk to your contractor about
the things you can do, and if the system is not producing the way it was
projected, why that may be the case. Most of the time, it’s not the
system, but the operation that is causing the discrepancy.
11. Maintain and repair the system.
In Murphy’s immortal words, “Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.”
Unlike most other investments, PV system problems are entirely yours
to solve. Even if you’re under warranty, you have to call the contractor
and notify him; he has no idea of knowing when your system is broken.
12. Expand in the future.
As I demonstrate in the following payback section, the best tact (strictly
from an investment standpoint) is to install a smaller system than you
think you need and allow for the possibility for future expansion. You
can easily do this by purchasing an inverter that’s larger than you need
and adding more solar panels later, perhaps when energy costs rise.
Analyzing Payback in Detail
Your home is probably the biggest expenditure you’ll ever make, followed by
your car. A full-scale PV system can cost anywhere between $8,000 to $80,000
(the average is around $22,000) and so ranks high up on the list of large
expenditures as well.
A range of factors determine the viability of a PV system investment. Not all
of these can be enumerated, but they’re all important. Payback analysis is a
267
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

method that allows you to calculate how long it’ll take to recoup your original
investment in solar equipment (see Chapter 6). But payback also includes
intangibles, such as satisfaction in knowing you’re doing something to make a
difference in the environment. In the following sections, I describe the factors
that affect the payback of your solar system.
Pollution mitigation
The value you place on pollution mitigation is hard to quantify, but at some
point you’ll need to consider it. (In Chapter 6 I present a method for quantify-
ing your pollution mitigation commitment.)
For many, investing in a PV system is an easy decision. It’s not about money,
although economic payback has to be somewhat reasonable. It’s about
Mother Nature and saving the planet from global warming. You can save more
than 40,000 pounds of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere each year by con-
verting your home to solar electric — how much is that worth to you?
The fact is that it’s going to cost each and every one of us to clean up our
planet. Gas prices will rise, and so will general energy costs. At some point,
the government will mandate taxes and fuel efficiencies and take measures to
force people to conserve. In other words, at some point, it’s going to cost
everyone a lot more for energy.
Energy prices and utility rates
The future outlook of energy prices may be the single biggest factor in how
much you choose to invest in a PV system. When a PV system contractor
estimates your system needs and the amount of money you’ll save, he or she
will make an assumption on the increase in energy costs (usually around 
7 percent per year, which in this age of political uncertainty seems rather
conservative). If you think it’s going to be more than that, tell the contrac-
tors, and they can use your numbers in their computer generations to give
you a more accurate appraisal.
Ask your contractor specifically to do two different payback analyses: one
with energy rising at 7 percent and another with energy costs rising at 14 per-
cent. The two projections will show a huge difference, illustrating precisely
how important future energy costs are in the decision-making process.
Utility rates directly determine how much cost savings you can expect. This
is a complicated issue, and I spend an entire section addressing it later on.
You usually have a choice of rate structures, so you need to understand this
issue so you can make the best decisions.
268
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Important point: When you operate in a tiered rate structure, which is almost
always the case, regardless of whether you’re in a TOU structure or not, you
are eliminating the energy in the highest tiers first, with the installation of a
solar system. This means that your payback is higher for a smaller sized
solar system than a larger (one that offsets your entire electrical bill). If mon-
etary payback is your primary motive, a smaller system is always best in a
tiered structure (say around two-thirds of your total electrical usage). But
you can always purchase an inverter that is larger than your PV panels are
capable of outputting and expand at a future date. In fact, adding panels to an
existing system is easy; the labor for installation is largely in the wiring and
conduits and meter connections. Adding capacity later is relatively inexpen-
sive, plus you won’t need to go through the permit process again because
you’re already online. 
A related point: Solar contractors rarely explain this point to you because they
want to sell you the largest system possible. They also don’ explain the benefit
of conservation, for the same reason. When you have a contractor do a finan-
cial analysis, have her do a payback for a smaller system versus a large system,
and you can see for yourself just how much better the payback will be. She
likely won’t volunteer to do run this calculation, so you’ll have to ask.
Local climate and system output
Local climate determines how much sunlight you can expect over the course
of a year. A PV system in Seattle, Washington, where it’s cloudy and rainy, will
be harder to justify than a system in Phoenix, Arizona. You can account for
your local climate’s lack of sunshine by up sizing your system, but this obvi-
ously costs more, and the payback is not so good. (For more on estimating
solar potential, see Chapter 5.)
Financial incentives
Incentives and subsidies are available from both the federal and state govern-
ments. I detail the options in Chapter 21. Suffice here to say that in some
locales, you can discount your system cost by up to 60 percent. This is a big
number, and it obviously changes the nature of your investment decision.
269
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

Mounting considerations
The structure and location of your house determines the mounting options
you have — and how much you pay for them. Many roofs are unsuitable for
solar panels for various reasons. Some roofs simply don’t allow for rigid
mounting. Tile roofs are difficult, although doable (and expensive).
You generally want your PV panels aligned toward the south, at an optimum
pitch equal to your latitude. (See Chapter 5 for more information on this topic.)
Any other angles, and you get less performance. In California, for example, the
state rebate amount is determined by how effective your system will be. The
PV system contractor comes to your house and makes some measurements,
and from these can tell you how much production you can expect. If your roof
has partial shading at some time of the day, this will factor into the equation.
The condition of your roof is also important. Are you going to have to change the
roof soon? If so, you’ll have to contract with your solar system provider to
come back out, take the panels down for however long it takes to change the
roof, and then put them back up after the roof is finished. Ask the contractor
for an estimated cost to do this (expect around $1,500, more or less).
Otherwise, you may want to replace the roof first.
If you can’t mount equipment on your roof, you can mount it on the ground.
The biggest advantage is that you can orient the panels however you want. You
can face them directly into the south, at the precise angle that’s optimum. 
You can even use adjustable mounts to adjust the pitch a couple of times a
year in order to maximize the sunlight exposure as the sun moves higher and
lower in the sky over the seasons. But ground mounting is often unsightly, plus
it’s more susceptible to shading issues and much more prone to damage and
tampering. Ground mounting is also more expensive because of the extra con-
crete work — and the fact that you’ll likely need to have some trenches dug
for wiring. A contractor can give you a feel for the different mounting costs.
Working with different utility
rate structures
If you’ve ever taken a good look at your power bill, you’ve noticed that utilities
don’t speak plain language. Most utilities are publicly regulated companies,
which means that their rules of operation are essentially determined by legisla-
tors. Low-income customers get subsidies; farmers get special rates; and resi-
dential, commercial, and industrial customers all have different rate structures.
What this boils down to a very complicated network of rate structures. But in
order to understand exactly how your solar system will profit you, you need to
understand, at the very least, the rate structure you’ll be operating under after
your system is finished.
270
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Types of rate structures
The rate structure you’re now in may or may not be available with solar power,
but it could affect your decision to go with solar versus simply staying where
you are. Here are the types of rate structures:
 Simple: Simple rate structures charge x dollars per kilowatt-hour. No
problem. The first kilowatt-hour you buy is the same price as the last.
Unfortunately, this structure is rare.
 Seasonal: Seasonal rate structures change rates in summer and winter.
Summer rates are always higher than winter. You may not even know it,
but you’re probably on a seasonally adjusted structure right now.
 Tiered: Tiered rate structures are common. You get a baseline energy
usage, say 600 kilowatt-hours per month. If you use more than this, the
rate goes up, sometimes punitively. Here’s a sample tiered rate structure:
Percent of Baseline
Monthly Energy Use
Cost Per kWh
0–100%
0–904.8 kWh
$0.11589
101–130%
904.8–1,176 kWh

201–300%
1,810–2,715 kWh
$0.2284
Over 300%
Over 2,716 kWh
$0.3465
Most tiered rate structures also have different rates for summer and
winter. Compare your February bill with your August bill, and you’ll
probably find that your power costs more in August. Summer rates are
sometimes a lot more. The summer season is typically May through
September, five months.
 Time-of-use (TOU): TOU rate structures have different rates depending
on what time of day you use your power. Here’s a typical example:
Time
Summer Rates
Winter Rates
Peak (noon
$0.29372/kWh (ouch!)
$0.11472/kWh
to 6:00 p.m.)
Off-peak
$0.08664/kWh
$0.08966 per kWh
271
Chapter 17: Plugging In to the Grid with a Full-Scale PV System

This rate structure requires a special power meter with a clock and 
two different totals: peak usage and off-peak usage. Obviously, using
power in the afternoon, in the summer, is very expensive. The reason 
utilities do this kind of thing is that it costs them a lot more to provide
power during peak times. Everybody’s air-conditioner is on, and the utility
can’t produce all the power required by all their customers. They have to
purchase power somewhere else, which requires a lot of overhead, not to
mention the fact that transporting power over long distances via trans-
mission lines is inefficient.
 Combined: Combined rate structures can get very complex. In Northern
California, intertie customers are put on a tiered, TOU, seasonal rate
structure as in Table 17-1.

Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Getting the most out of intertie systems with a variable rate structure
Utilities are usually required to pay you their current retail rate for any power
you sell back to them via your intertie PV system. Clearly, what you want to
do is sell power to them at the highest rate possible, which is during the
summer peak hours. But you won’t be selling them power unless you’re using
less than you’re generating. In order to do this, you’ll probably need to
change household habits (see Chapter 3 for tips).
During the winter, your net total (power that you sell the utility, minus the
power you use from the utility) due will probably decrease each month
because you’re not pumping out much power. But come summer, if you’re
generating a lot of excess power, your running total will increase fast. The
best months for generating excess power are May, June, and September. In
July and August, it’s difficult to avoid afternoon air-conditioning unless you
work special hours, like late in the day. In this case, a programmable thermo-
stat comes in handy so it can cool your house down by the time you get
home while still avoiding peak use.
Seasonal variations are useful because you’ll be generating more power in the
summer than the winter. But this rate structure is only an advantage if you
also use less power in the summer than the winter. If you’re in a mild summer
climate and don’t need much air-conditioning, you’ll be in great shape.

TOU rate structures clearly provide the most advantage for intertie solar
customers (see the earlier section called “Reaping net-metering rewards with
time-of-use rates”). But how do you minimize power usage from noon until 
6:00 p.m.? Here are a few options (see Chapter 3 for more energy-saving ideas):
 Don’t use your washer or dryer or any other appliances in the after-
noon. And don’t use fans, swimming pool pumps, spa pumps, lights, and
so on during this time period, either.
 Get a special switch for your domestic water heater that’ll basically turn
it off from noon until six. You’ll still have hot water, but the water won’t
be heating up at all, so if you use water, it will slowly begin to cool. If you
use a lot of hot water during this time, you’ll eventually start getting
cold water from your tap.
 If the day is going to be hot, turn your air conditioner on in the morning,
get the house really cool, then turn it off and close all your window
blinds to maximize insulation.

ff-grid means you’re not connected to a public utility for your electrical
power. The term usually also means you’re not connected to utility gas,
water, and sewer. However, in this chapter, I address only electrical power
because that’s the angle that solar can solve. (Myriad books and magazines
are dedicated to going completely off-grid if you’re interested.)
Here are a few reasons for going off-grid:
 No utility power is available, period. This situation may be the case if
you’re living in a remote location. You have a number of options, but solar
power is one of the best, particularly if you’re concerned with pollution.
Solar solutions include not only PV panels and solar water heating
systems but also wind and water power, so the options are diverse.
 Bringing utility power in costs way too much. If you’re off the beaten
path, you can probably get the utility company to bring power in, but
you’ll have to pay for the long line lengths and poles, trenches, and the
like. This job can sometimes cost more than $100,000. A standalone
solar power system can save you a lot of money.
 You just want to be off-grid because of the allure of independence.
Perhaps you just plain don’t like utility companies and abhor paying
their monthly bills. Perhaps you love the idea of going completely green.
Perhaps you’re just a grouchy old soul who answers the door for nobody
because you think the entire world is, well, stupid. During power black-
outs, the rest of the world will go black while you’re still chugging away
without skipping a beat. This is ideal if you like to gloat.

In this chapter, I tell you what to expect when you go off-grid, how to evaluate
your system needs, and what an off-grid system may look like.
Understanding Off-Grid Ramifications
You have choices when you go off-grid. Propane works well for heating 
and cooking and refrigeration. Wood stoves are popular for remote houses and
cabins because there’s usually a ready supply of firewood. But at some point,
you’re going to want to plug in your television, and the choices are more lim-
ited. Gas-powered generators are inexpensive and can put out a lot of power
when needed. But they’re noisy, cumbersome, and smelly, and they pollute
quite a bit. If you’re out in the middle of nowhere, a gas generator is inherently
contradictory with the peaceful coexistence you’ve chosen.
The majority of off-grid homes use some form or forms of solar, whether it be
wind turbines, hydropower, hot water heaters, or PV systems. Batteries are
an inevitability because it’s impossible to arrange a lifestyle to use power as
it becomes available, so some means of storage is needed. Inverters transform
the voltages output by wind turbines, hydro alternators, and solar PV panels
into voltages that are commonly used in household applications, so they’re
also a part of off-grid systems. The following sections describe the fundamental
system architectures and suggest ways to further pursue off-grid solar
power systems.
Off-grid lifestyles often lead to improved personal relationships between
family members, who end up spending more quality time together. Go off-grid
with people you like.
Considering higher costs and maintenance
Chapter 17 details PV electrical generating systems connected to the grid
(intertie systems). One of the major reasons for installing such a system is
that it lets you sell your excess power back to the utility company. The bottom
line is that an intertie system operates at 100 percent of its productive capacity
because someone is always using energy as it’s being created.
Off-grid solar power systems provide electrical power, but it’s relatively
expensive. When you install an off-grid solar PV system, you can’t get anywhere
near 100-percent utilization, plus you need batteries, charge controllers
(which control the battery functions), and so on; all this extra equipment
is expensive, and it requires a lot of maintenance.

You need to understand what you’re doing with an off-grid system; you 
can’t just plug and play. You have to take care of batteries, monitor system
performance, and adjust your habits on a daily basis depending on how much
power your system is generating. In general, off-grid PV systems cost at least
two times as much per kilowatt-hour as an intertie system, and they take ten
times more attention on your part.
Energy conservation measures are always the beginning of any solar power
lifestyle, but they’re even more important with off-grid systems because the
economics dictate it. The best start is to build a very energy conservative
house that maximizes your solar potential (see Chapter 19). Efficient appliances
and personal habits are also a must.
Most banks won’t touch an off-grid home. You may not be able to get a first
mortgage, and second mortgages are even more prohibitive. If you ever want
to sell your house, off-grid will drive away 99 percent of potential buyers, and
the higher cost of a mortgage (if one’s even available) will be reflected in a
lower selling price. If you have a choice, off-grid is not an investment at all —
it’s a discretionary, luxury expense.
Standalone systems are generally subject to rebates and subsidies, just like
intertie PV systems and hot water systems. See Chapter 21 for details on how
to research this subject.
Looking green
From a pollution standpoint, you can do the world more good by using an
intertie system because you’ll be generating more usable power for a system 
of a given size. Each kilowatt-hour of energy you generate with an intertie
system offsets that much energy from the grid — it’s a one-to-one relationship.
This isn’t true with an off-grid system; a lot of the potential energy generation 
is wasted simply because you don’t end up using it. (If you’re on vacation,
generating capacity is completely wasted; if you don’t use as much power as
your system generates, you’re wasting potential production.) There is a fine
point here; this is different than wasting energy. This is wasting the potential to
produce energy, and while this entails no pollution, or costs, you are foregoing
potential gain, which changes the economics. The best bet is to share your
system with the world, if at all possible.
And batteries are inefficient, so you waste energy in that regard as well (more
on this subsequently). Batteries are also disposable-waste nightmares
because they’re so full of nasty chemicals.
277
Chapter 18: Divorcing the Grid: Going Solo with Solar Power Systems

Carbon dioxide is an important pollution culprit these days, but it’s not the
only one. Groundwater pollution is a growing problem. Waste management is
expensive, and it increases everybody’s tax burden. If you aren’t really savvy
with your batteries, the lifetimes can be atrocious, so the pollution problem
is increased not only by the mere use of batteries but also by improper use. I
give a brief tutorial on batteries, but you need to read the operating manuals
that come with your off-grid system, pay attention to the monitors, and
discover how to work optimally with your batteries.
On the flipside, most people who choose to go off-grid are environmentally
conscious and competent when it comes to using their resources.
Conservation and proper usage come naturally with the off-grid lifestyle.
Surveying Off-Grid Solar Options
Off-grid PV systems are expensive, so find any means you can to reduce the
energy requirements. Most off-grid houses use a wide range of energy resources,
in sharp contrast to the typical all-electric suburban home. Solar hot water
heaters are always good candidates because they’re cheaper per kilowatt-
hour than an off-grid PV system, and solar lighting systems are always wise.
This variety can be an advantage in that you aren’t completely disabled with
power blackouts. In fact, you’ll be completely impervious to power outages,
and even if one of your resources goes down, the majority of your lifestyle will
still be intact.
Off-grid solar electrical systems all use the same basic components, with other
elements added according to need. Figure 18-1 shows a typical off-grid system.
Here are the functions of each part:
 Charge controller: The charge controller feeds current into the battery
bank at the required voltage. Good charge controllers draw the best
performance out of the batteries and are very important for economics
because they influence efficiency.
 Battery bank: The battery bank is typically made up of six or more indi-
vidual batteries connected with stout cables in either series or parallel
arrangements.
 Inverter: The inverter changes DC to AC voltages suitable for use with
household equipment. An inverter is optional if you use DC loads 
exclusively.
 DC loads controller: You may be using both DC (boat, RV, and auto
appliances) and AC loads (standard household appliances). The DC loads
controller maintains the proper currents and voltages into the DC loads.
278
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

 AC generator: As a backup power supply, the AC generator isn’t strictly
necessary but is usually part of any off-grid system in order to prevent
blackouts when the sun is weak for extended periods of time.
 Transfer switch: The transfer switch alternates the power source
between either the inverter output (when battery power is available) or
the AC generator.
 AC loads controller: This device includes appropriate fuses and switching
means and maintains the voltages and currents used by the AC appliances
connected to the system.
The following sections outline some fundamental choices with regards to
your PV system composition.
AC or DC
Which type of current you choose depends on what you want to run. If it’s
just a few lights at night, with a coffee maker and a fan or two, DC is fine.
However, the market for DC appliances is far smaller than 120VAC, so you

may go for AC if you’re using standard household appliances (which is the
most common way to go and is cheaper and better because of the wide-
spread availability of AC appliances compared to DC appliances).
DC, which is more efficient because batteries use direct current, is usually
the choice for small cabins and small power systems. You can use DC appliances
for RVs and boats, so envision your cabin like a big RV, and you get the pic-
ture. But DC also requires larger wire diameters, which can be very costly if
you need to run lengths of more than 50 feet or so.
If you use DC, you need to decide the voltage. 12VDC is the standard used for
RVs, boats, and cars, but because it’s the lowest voltage, it requires the most
expensive wiring. Other choices are 24VDC, 48VDC, and so on, but these
become progressively more dangerous for electrical shock hazards, and find-
ing compatible appliances is harder. With AC voltages, the universal standard
is 120VAC.
Understanding Batteries (Familiarity
Breeds Contempt)
After you install a PV intertie system (see Chapter 17), you can completely
ignore it for the most part. Keeping the solar panels clean is about the extent
of your maintenance.
But when you install a system with batteries, you have to stay on top of
things. The battery or battery pack is the core of any off-grid system, and it
drives the system’s cost. All action comes and goes from the battery, and
much of the safety and control equipment is designed to protect either the
battery or the balance of the system from the battery. You absolutely have to
understand batteries, or you’ll end up paying an arm and a leg for new ones
all the time and you won’t get decent performance out of the ones you have.
The following short primer is designed to give you an idea of what you’re
going to be facing, but it’s nowhere near complete. After you buy your system,
thoroughly read and understand the detailed directions that come with it.
Buy a well-proven kit, and read the directions at least three times (make sure
that you stay awake while reading)! Battery systems work very well and give
you excellent long-term performance. Consider your auto; it has a big battery
system, and you rarely need to mess around with it. But that’s because the
battery system has been designed and tested over generations and millions
of other cars like yours. You’ll run into problems if you design your own
system using novel new technologies and unproven applications.
280
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Battery types
A wide range of different battery types are available, each with different per-
formance characteristics and varying costs. Battery technology is changing
very fast, and new types are constantly coming onto the market. It’s impossible
to describe the myriad types here. If you need batteries, contact any dealer,
such as Real Goods at www.realgoods.com, and ask for technical assistance.
By far, lead-acid batteries offer the best performance versus cost for large
energy-storage applications. These are the same type of batteries used in
autos, but auto batteries have entirely different internal constructions
because they’re designed to output a huge amount of current for only a small
amount of time; household energy storage applications, on the other hand,
require relatively low-power output for long periods. Also, the depth of
charge is different for auto batteries (depth of charge is the amount of total
capacity a battery is designed to lose between charges). Auto batteries yield
very little of their total capacity, but household storage batteries are
designed to go deep into their total capacity.
Capacity and efficiency
Battery capacity is a measure of how much total energy a battery can hold.
Ratings come in amp-hours (Ah). To get the total energy capacity, simply 
multiply this number by the voltage. Thus, a 100 Ah battery at 12 volts yields
1.2 kilowatt-hours of energy.
In general, the larger the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the battery is.
However, the faster you pull the charge out of a battery, the lower the capacity,
so the capacity is really useful only for comparing different batteries. It’s not a
true measure of what you can get out of a battery. (Sound so complex it’s
almost impossible to get a good handle on things? You’re catching on.)
Batteries are also inefficient. When you put a certain amount of energy into
them, they lose a percentage. When you take a certain amount of energy back
out, they lose another percentage. The average loss is about 20 percent,
meaning that for every 100 watt-hours you put in, you can get only 80 watt-
hours back out. But inefficiencies increase with age, which means your
system capacity also decreases with age.
Also, the higher the voltage, the more efficient the system. Batteries are
available in either six or twelve volts, and you can connect them in series or
parallel (see Chapter 4) to get 6VDC, 12VDC, 18VDC, 24VDC, and so on. If
you’re using an AC inverter, with AC appliances, it won’t make any difference
which battery voltage you decide on, so ask your dealer what he recommends
and make sure that the rest of the system is compatible with that voltage.
281
Chapter 18: Divorcing the Grid: Going Solo with Solar Power Systems

Maintenance
Batteries self-discharge at a rate of around 5 percent per month, so when they
sit around, they grow useless. If they’re dirty, with oily or corrosive tops, 
they can discharge at a rate of 5 percent per week. Furthermore, battery
internal chemicals can crystallize, resulting in a resistance to recharging. The
solution is to discharge and charge on a regular basis. If you have an off-grid
PV system with batteries and you go on vacation for an extended period of
time, your batteries will not appreciate it at all. They’ll miss you so much that
they self-destruct.
Batteries are like your body: They need activity to stay in peak health. Too
much activity, and they get worn out. Too-intense activity, and they can be
damaged. The best bet, if you’re intent on batteries, is to regard them as
another member of your family. They need attention, maintenance, their own
living space, and so on. (They do not, however, require tuition, nor do they
get married to somebody you loathe.)
Lifetime
Batteries should last a few years when used properly. Expect about four years.
If this is your first time with batteries, expect around three years. If you’re like
Curly, Moe, or Larry, expect one year or death, whichever comes first.
A battery monitor system can help you keep track of battery performance. At
a cost of around $250, it’s probably worth it. It can tell you exactly how much
capacity your batteries have and how much they’ve been used over their life-
times. No surprises.
Risks
Batteries are full of nasty chemicals. Really nasty. And they produce poiso-
nous gases, so it’s not enough to simply avoid touching the chemicals. Sealed
batteries avoid the gassing issue, but their performance isn’t as good (mean-
ing they’re more expensive in the long run).
If possible, while you’re using them, bury sealed batteries in a sealed container.
Design this in as part of your system. Batteries can inflict much less mischief
if they’re buried underground. Avoid putting them in your house if you can —
garages are good if they have ventilation. Always keep children away from
batteries. When it comes time to discard the batteries, never bury them; take
them to a recycling center. You will have to pay for this service, but please do it.
282
Part IV: Home Solar Projects: Getting a Little Help from Your Friends 

Risks aren’t limited to toxic substances. Batteries are capable of outputting huge
amounts of current, and this can be even more dangerous than an electrical
shock. The voltages from a battery aren’t generally high enough to cause
electrical shocks (although if you connect enough batteries in a series, you
can get a good shock). But a battery can discharge enough current to melt
metal, creating a very serious burn hazard (machine shops and manufacturers
use electricity in a similar way in arc welding). If you have a big battery bank,
and drop a bicycle or a metal tool onto it, you may be treated to a Fourth of
July spectacle right in your own house! Be careful!
Specifying and Pricing Your Systems
At a minimum, you need to determine the following in order to get a good
idea how much your standalone PV system will cost:
1. Calculate the total watt-hours per day of energy you’ll need.
Compile a list of all your appliances and devices and how many hours
per day each will be run. You can find the wattage rating by either look-
ing at the label on the appliance (almost all appliances will have a label)
or making a measurement using a standard watt meter (available from
Real Goods at www.realgoods.com).
2. Define your peak instantaneous power output, measured in watts.
Determine which appliances you’ll be running at the same time; add their
power draws, in watts. You have a lot of control over this specification
because you can run appliances at different times.
3. Figure out the duty cycle.
Duty cycle is a measure of how often the system is used. A weekend
cabin used for two days has a duty cycle of 2⁄7, or about 28 percent. A
system used every day has a duty cycle of 100 percent.
4. Estimate how many hours of good sunlight a day you can expect.
Sunlight is difficult to estimate with much accuracy because it depends
on the weather. It also depends on the time of year during which you’re
interested in using your system. For a weekend cabin in the mountains,
used only in the summer, you may expect eight hours a day of sunshine,
and in the thin mountain air, you’ll get very good solar exposure. For a
cabin used twice a month for a few days all year round, the worst case
will be in winter, when you may only get three hours a day of cumulative
sunshine, maybe even less if it’s snowing and the panels are covered.
Assume worst case, and be conservative on top of that.
In the following section, I give an example of how to put all this data together
to come up with a final answer.
283
Chapter 18: Divorcing the Grid: Going Solo with Solar Power Systems

Peeking In on a Real-Life Scenario
In this section, I walk through some of the calculations for an off-grid home in
the mountains of Northern California. Here’s what you need to keep in mind
about this scenario:
 The duty cycle is 100 percent, and the house is used year-round.
 Worst-case expected sunlight per day is around four hours.
 A two-day power reserve is required because the backup generator is 20
years old and may or may not start, depending on its cantankerous mood.
There may be some days when power is simply not available, but this is
acceptable because the residents like to read, and a few good candles will
work just fine.
 The system must output 120VAC.
And in case you’re curious, here’s how the owners are reducing their energy
requirements:
 They use a wood-burning stove exclusively for heat.
 Residents don’t need electric-powered water heating because they use a
solar water heater.
 Both the cooking stove and refrigerator work with bottled propane.
 The house is extremely efficient, with well-designed window overhangs, a
sunroom on the southern front, and a modular design that enables the living
area to be closed off to the rest of the house on the cruelest winter days.
 A solar attic vent fan is installed in the attic space, and a large solar-
powered ceiling fan in the great room keeps the comfort level on the
hottest summer days tolerable.
Calculating needs

Next, calculate battery size, which is specified in terms of amp-hours (Ah).
Most batteries are 12VDC, but other sizes are also available. For this example,
assume a 12VDC system.
1. Take the total kWh/day, multiply this by 1,000 to get kWh/day, and
then divide this value by the battery voltage.
For the example, this yields 233Ah:
2.5 kWh/day _ 1,000 W/kWh ≈233 Ah
12VDC
285
Chapter 18: Divorcing the Grid: Going Solo with Solar Power Systems

2. The generator is old, so triple the result from Step 1 to account for the
two reserve days.
To cover the two reserve days, the cabin owners need batteries that can
hold three days’ worth of charge, which yields around 700 Ah:
233 Ah × 3 ≈700 Ah
3. Multiply the minimum battery capacity from Step 2 by a factor of two.
Batteries last much longer when they’re not drained of more than about
70 percent of their available energy. In the long term, getting a battery
with a larger capacity will cost much less than replacing batteries more
often — plus a performance margin is always nice (the net effect will be
more reserve days). Therefore, the residents need a total of 1,400 Ah of
battery capacity:
700 Ah × 2 = 1,400 Ah
Finally, they’re going to need a larger PV module capacity in order to get the
three-day reserve. It’s okay to go without power a few times, and there’s a
backup generator, so if they double the size of the PV module capacity, they
should be safe. Hence, the owners need 1,400 watts of PV.
Checking out the complete system
Take a look at the components of the complete system. You can install a
system like this yourself for around $14,000. In many off-grid applications,
you don’t need to get a county permit or have inspectors look at your
system. You’re pretty much on your own, although you should be aware of
your local requirements.

Note: Peace signs are optional, although for some reason, they seem to go
hand in hand with off-grid lifestyles.
Sealed gel storage batteries are used because they’re safer; they cost more,
but it’s worth it, especially if kids are around.
In your system, you need to aim the PV modules optimally (see Chapter 5).
You may want to use adjustable mounts so you can get more out of the
system in the winter by aiming the panels lower in the sky. If so, mount the
PV panels on the ground, instead of a roof — you can make adjustments
easily and often.
Using wind or water doesn’t change things much. Just substitute a hydro gen-
erator or wind turbine for the PV panels. That energy source may be much
less reliable, but on the other hand, it may be more reliable, particularly with
water power. You can also use a combination, which is what a lot of off-grid
home styles incorporate. (See Chapter 14 for more on wind and water.)
Remember that when you do your calculations, use conservative estimates
and allow for worst-case scenarios. So over the course of the summer, and
when it’s sunny and clear, the system has much more capacity, maybe
double. And the need for reserve is less because the odds of needing it are
much less.
Ironically, the power consumption is less in the summer because the days are
longer and the residents are living outside more. But that’s the nature of a
solar system. You don’t save anything by using a solar system at less than
capacity, so the net result in practical terms is that in sunny weather, you can
use more power without worrying about conserving.

Buying, Selling,
and Building a
Solar Home

In this part . . .
I
n this part, you’re talking serious money, with potentially
fabulous rewards. The fact is, many solar technologies
are relatively new and untested, and if you’re planning on
living in a solar home, whether you buy it or build it, you’re
going to have to make wise decisions because you simply
can’t rely on anybody else to make them for you.
I show you how to decide between buying a completed
solar home and finding an existing home to convert to solar.
I explain how to determine how much a solar home is worth
versus a conventional home. I also show you how to find
the right lot for a new solar home and how to design a
good solar home to match that lot. Finally, I give you tips
on how to find a good contractor and work with him or
her during the building phase of a project.

S
tarting from scratch is the best possible way to get a solar home. By
building a new home, you can control all the factors, including both
passive and active. You can design the rooms exactly the way you want them.
And you have good equity on the day you move in. When you build your own
house, you also cut out all the profit margins that developers and financiers
normally take.
But building from scratch is a demanding process, full of surprises. To get an
idea of the difficulties (as well as the rewards), read Building Your Own Home
For Dummies (Wiley) by Kevin Daum, Janice Brewster, and Peter Economy.
You can build an energy-efficient solar home for the same cost as a conventional
home. When you consider the fact that you won’t have any energy bills, a green
home actually costs less in terms of your monthly cash flow. This savings means
you can afford a larger mortgage, which in turn means you can build a more
expensive home (note I did not say bigger!).
For the same amount of money, you can build a large, sparsely outfitted house,
or a smaller house with more expensive fittings, appliances, and so on. The
smaller the house, the better the potential for energy efficiency. So the first
rule of thumb for an efficient house is to keep it small and appoint it well.
This isn’t really a problem if you pay attention to a few location features and
design guidelines, which is what this chapter is all about.

Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 
Following the Basic Rules
of Home Building
Building a home is a major project, probably the biggest one you’ll ever
undertake. By keeping in mind a few basic rules, you can maintain your sanity
and establish a better working relationship with contractors, designers, and
others involved in the process.
The one overriding rule that you should never break is “Be patient.” You’re
going to live in your new home a long time, particularly if you do a good job
and end up loving it (why should you expect anything less?). To get everything
just right, the whole project will probably take a couple of years. You’ll make
compromises, but impatience should never be the reason why you give in.
Perhaps that perfect lot is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, even though it’s
not quite right for your solar home. But you can make design adjustments to
account for certain compromises, so insisting on perfection is impractical
and not really necessary.
Don’t rely on your home being completed by a certain date. Some people
who build a new home sell their current house long before their new place is
ready, and they have no choice but to be impatient. Just be patient and have
frequent conversations with your builder so you know when the construction
process is behind or ahead of schedule.
The second rule is to take your new-home project seriously. Obviously, you
want your new house to be the best it can be. But you’ll probably be working
with a general contractor, too. Keep in mind that building homes is his liveli-
hood, and he probably has a family that counts on a steady income. As a
result, contractors are very cautious about committing to a big job. They
have all, unfortunately, seen potential jobs go away at the drop of a hat, and
they’ve been left in the lurch. So never treat the process casually. Your deci-
sions have major consequences for others, and you have a responsibility to
proceed with respect for the ways in which you are influencing others’ lives.

Everybody’s heard the realtor’s favorite maxim, “Location, location, location.”
With solar power, this consideration becomes slightly modified, and orientation
becomes a critical factor.
You’re going to have to be a lot more fussy about your lot when you build a
solar house. You want a piece of land that allows you to orient your house

with a good southern exposure for PV panels and water heating collectors,
and also for windows, sunrooms, and living spaces. On some lots, this is very
difficult to achieve because of the street orientation and the location of trees
and other shade potentials.
A barren lot is worth much less than a landscaped lot, but if the landscaping
doesn’t enhance the solar potential, or actually reduces it, it’s useless, or maybe
even a negative. Of course, you can raze everything, but that’s at odds with the
underlying green philosophy. On the other hand, you may have no choice, and
then it will be incumbent on you to make things good with Mother Nature.
Of course, you need to keep in mind the features every homebuyer looks for
when choosing a location (neighborhood, size of the home and lot relative to
nearby houses, and so on) because one day you may need to sell your home,
and potential buyers will consider these things. But for now, you need to find
out two things:
 Whether you can build your solar-powered home in the neighborhood
you’re considering
 If the piece of property you’re eying allows you to maximize the sun’s
energy
This section can help you answer these concerns.
Evaluating local building
codes and regulations
As you consider various locations for building a solar home, the first thing
you need to answer is whether the local building codes support such a pro-
ject. Unfortunately, some communities are behind the times and don’t have
laws and codes that are user-friendly.
You should start with the local building department (at the county headquarters)
and discuss your plans for a solar home with a representative. During the
meeting, you can find out what solar features are allowed and which ones are
no-nos. You can also get a feel for how onerous and expensive the building
process is going to be. Be sure to ask whether the department subsidizes solar
homes and how you can get in on that action. Find out if other solar homes have
been built in your area or the particular neighborhood you’re considering.
If your conversation with the folks at the local building department goes well,
your next step is to contact the homeowner’s association where you want to
build, or read through its charter. Here’s where you may find the biggest 
293
Chapter 19: Building a Solar Home from the Ground Up

contradictions. Many association bylaws ban solar panels because they’re
ugly; these restrictions are probably illegal. Nevertheless, you can try to comply
with the rules against having solar panels in public view by orienting your
house so the panels face south but aren’t visible from the street. This requires
the front of your home to face north and the back to face south.
If you still have questions about what you can and can’t do, find a local con-
tractor with experience building solar homes. He’ll be able to answer a lot of
your questions very accurately.
Considering the solar potential
When you build a house, there’s more to the story than just sun exposure.
Solar is a general philosophy and takes into account water power, wind
power, breezes, landscaping, thermal mass, and so on. Start a log book, and
for each location you’re considering, record facts, figures, and your observa-
tions for each of the following aspects. (Chapter 5 goes into detail on how to
evaluate solar potential.)
Know your solar exposures
What latitude are you in? What is the sun’s path over the course of a year at that
latitude? For each site, stand in the middle of the lot and plot the sun’s course
(you can make a graph, as per Chapter 5). You may have to do some guesswork
about what the situation will be from a rooftop that hasn’t been built yet. Different
spots on a lot will have different solar exposures with different shading issues.
It goes without saying that you don’t want to cut trees down. Look for deciduous
trees and try to envision your house with those trees on the southern exposure,
but not shading solar collectors on the roof. You can plant trees, but it will take
a long time before they can rival natural, healthy, indigenous trees.
294
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 
Out of sight, into court
I know of some homeowners who decided to put
the solar panels at the side of their house so they
couldn’t see them, but their neighbor’s could.
This rather selfish attitude got them sued by the
neighbor and the homeowner’s association for
violating the “visual appearance” clause.
The association won because the judge found
that the homeowner himself was declaring the
panels visual blights because he didn’t want to
look at them either. Everybody lost a lot of money,
even the winners. When it comes to rules, try to
work within them, and never be stubborn about
right and wrong.

Analyze prevailing winds
Natural breezes are absolutely free and can make a major difference in the com-
fort of a home. Look for locations where hills magnify breezes in the summer. In
the winter, you want natural brush and landscaping to block the cold winds
from the north. (Chapter 13 addresses ventilation and cooling issues.)
To thoroughly gauge the winds, you need to visit a potential location at differ-
ent times of the year and in different weather patterns. Be patient in order to
be thorough.
Determine the water rights and drainage
Do you need a well? Wells have their advantages and disadvantages. You
won’t have a water bill, but you’ll need expensive equipment. You can install
a solar-powered well with a storage reservoir (see Chapter 14), and your
water will be free forevermore. But wells can dry up, and the water can be of
questionable quality.
You also need to determine the property’s natural drainage. Some locations
simply won’t work for a home unless you radically alter the property’s con-
tour, which goes against the green mantra. How much water will your prop-
erty require? Are you going to landscape? How will that affect drainage?
Look in to other factors
If you can, camp out for a day or two on a prospective lot. At the very least,
visit at midnight, in the morning, and in the afternoon. Visit at different times
of the year, if that’s an option. What sounds do you hear? Who is moving
around and when?
And don’t forget to determine what may happen in the future. Are you going
to have a shopping mall next door five years hence? How about a freeway? Or
an airport? To find out about these kinds of things, ask your realtor and at
your county building department.
Designing Your Solar Home
Your goal in building a solar-powered house is to maximize the benefits of
Mother Nature and minimize her drawbacks. So when you design your home,
putting the rooms, walls, and windows in certain places and not others
makes a huge difference. You should think about your house on a couple of
different levels:
 How your home and lot can work together
 The overall size of the house
295
Chapter 19: Building a Solar Home from the Ground Up

 Exterior factors that affect solar usage
 The location of the rooms inside the house
The following sections delve in to each of these items.
Taking advantage of your lot’s features
When you plan to build a solar house, you want to find the right lot first, and
then get busy on the blueprints. You don’t want to commit to a particular house
design, and then insist on finding a lot that will bear it out. Each lot will support
a different style of house with a layout that maximizes views, breezes, landscap-
ing, and so on. So your house design should be a function of the lot.
You can take advantage of many of the existing features of your lot as you
design your house. When you consider the terrain and landscaping, think
about how those features change through the different seasons. How do the
land, trees, and any other nearby structures influence the wind, precipitation,
sun, and so on? Design on a 12-month basis, not just on the current season.
Hillsides work very well for providing insulation via Earth berms and half
basements. If you choose a hillside facing south, you can get two floors’
worth of good sun exposure while enjoying northern insulation.
Deciduous trees work well on western and southern exposures. A house usu-
ally feels much nicer with direct sunshine in the morning, so try to keep the
eastern shading to a minimum if that’s your goal.
Getting the basic principles right
Small is beautiful. A smaller house uses less building materials, is cheaper to
maintain, requires less HVAC capacity, uses less energy, and so on. You can
make a small house every bit as spacious as a large house if you
 Avoid long, wide hallways
 Combine utility functions like laundry and storage
 Put in less bathroom space (make the bathrooms tall, as opposed to
wide, and you’ll get a spacious effect)
 Forget both a living room and family room and combine them into one
central great room
Your house will also feel much larger with a nice sunroom off the living area.
And finally, with good, unimpeded views to the outdoors, a house feels much
296
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 

bigger than one with small windows leading nowhere. This could be the most
important aspect of your entire design and is consistent with the green
philosophy.
When you design a small house, you create central living areas, which work
much better than a meandering house with wings. Consider the ratio of square
footage of living space (exclude utilities, hallways, and other areas where you
spend virtually no time) to total surface area of the outside of the house. A
house with a lot of wings is difficult to heat and cool, requires more mainte-
nance, and simply does not need to be. It’s a sign of surrender, not conquest.
Starting on the design from the outside
Probably the most important factor for getting the most solar bang when
building a house is to orient your house in the right direction on the prop-
erty. The long axis of the house should run east to west for the greatest
southern exposure. The front of the house can face south or north. Up to 20
degrees off true south will work well enough. If you’ve got a squared-shaped
house, then you will want to put the family room and kitchen on the southern
front to maximize your solar exposure.
The other thing I recommend is to base your design on heat movement; try to
exploit the chimney effect and the greenhouse effect. Of course, you’ll want to
take advantage of natural breezes by venting appropriately (see Chapter 13).
Up on the rooftop and what’s underfoot
Roof exposure is critical for locating collectors. The roof is the ideal place for
them because you’ll have fewer shadows; plus, it’s easier to hide the panels
with a clever design. You don’t need to locate all your solar panels on one
expanse of roof, although visually it’s usually more acceptable.
You can mount the collectors on the ground if you have enough room. But this
requires wire runs and is more difficult to hide because hiding the collectors
usually involves some sort of shading (which kinda defeats the purpose!).
Hard rectangular shapes aren’t conducive to passive solar, so plan on break-
ing up the roof lines (which always looks better anyway). When you mount
your solar collectors on the roof, the pitch should match the optimum solar
potential angle. This is related to your latitude (see Chapter 5).
The more thermal mass, the more consistent the temperatures in the house.
Slab foundations are best for this reason. Solar rooms with concrete floors
and masonry walls work well, too.
297
Chapter 19: Building a Solar Home from the Ground Up

Windows shouldn’t be a pain
The size of your windows affects the overall insulation properties of your
house. Larger windows, of course, are less efficient, but they let in the most
ambience as well, so it becomes a balancing act. You can achieve interior
lighting by use of solar light tubes (see Chapter 9), so you don’t necessarily
need windows for light.
Reducing the number of windows on the northern exposure helps to increase
insulation. If your best view is northern, the light will be cold and dull, and the
windows on that side won’t provide much solar heat, but will allow a lot of heat
to escape. You may want a narrow house where the family room enjoys north-
ern views while at the same time takes advantage of the southern exposure.
Good solar houses always have well-designed overhangs over the windows,
porches, and doorways, particularly in the family room.
Strategically placing the garage
Your garage can be located in the least desirable area of your lot. A western
exposure can be hot and uncomfortable in the late afternoons and evenings,
so you can put a garage on that side. You can also achieve a buffer from cold
winter winds by placing the garage on the cold, windy side of the house. Or
perhaps a view from one side of the house is unattractive, in which case the
garage should go there.
What living space works best where
Consider time of day versus room usage in your layout. Are you in a home office
all day? Do you want to wake up in the sunshine? Think about the following
points when you design your interior spaces:
 Family rooms generally work best on a southern exposure. Your family will
spend most of their time there and get the most benefit from solar potential.
 Eastern kitchens are more congenial because you avoid the hot afternoon
exposures while ensuring a bright morning wakeup call. A southeastern
breakfast nook is ideal.
 A master bedroom on the northern front stays cooler, quieter, and darker.
 Put closets, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and other utility-type rooms on
the north. You can tolerate poor lighting and cold exposures better in
these rooms, so it won’t matter if the windows are smaller.
 Sunrooms and windows are always best on the south where they receive
the most sunlight. Use screened-in porches to shade windows on the
east and west sides of a house.
298
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 

Open airways make a house seem more spacious, as well as ensuring natural
air movement. Avoid long, meandering hallways and rooms with odd angles
and high, unventilated ceilings.
The Devil’s in the Details of Fabrication
You’ve defined the general design of your house. Now it’s time to specify the
particular materials and devices.
Floors and windows
Tile floors have more thermal mass than wood, cost less, last longer, and take
less maintenance. You can run a radiant heat system under your tile floor for
even more comfort in the winter (see Chapter 12). You can set your thermo-
stat down a few degrees and feel just as comfortable as in a conventionally
heated house.
Avoid aluminum-framed windows because they conduct too much heat. Specify
double pane windows, at the very least. You can get triple pane, as well as
special windows with gas insulation between panes, but the cost goes up
markedly. You’re better off simply using fewer and smaller windows on the
north and other fronts where there’s no sunshine exposure.
Don’t skimp on the quality of your windows because windows determine the
value of your house to a large degree. Spend some extra money for windows
with nice-looking frames and special features. At the very least, choose win-
dows that are easy to operate because you’re going to be opening and closing
them a lot. If money is a concern, you can spend some extra dough for fancier
features on the few windows that are important to the ventilation scheme.
Window blinds, awnings, and solar screens (see Chapter 9) provide visual
appeal while retaining heat or preventing sunshine. After all you’ve been
through, don’t skimp here because these can make or break the ambience of a
house. It’s a common error in home building to forget about the stuff you’ll need
after you move in. Then it’s not in the budget, which is probably going to be tight.
299
Chapter 19: Building a Solar Home from the Ground Up

Appliances and utilities
You’ve got a much better selection of energy-saving devices today than you
had just a few years ago. Obviously, you want to install energy-efficient appli-
ances, heating and cooling equipment, lighting, and other active devices.
You should use the smallest HVAC system possible for the amount of square
footage in your home. And install ceiling fans in the rooms where you spend a
lot of time. They save money and look good in the way they break up a ceiling
(see Chapter 13).
A stove, whether gas, wood, or something else, is always a good idea in the
family room because you can use it exclusively 90 percent of the time for your
heating needs. Most of the time you don’t need to heat your entire house. In
the same vein, room heaters and air conditioners are much cheaper to operate
than a whole house HVAC system.
To conserve water, use as few sinks as possible and keep the piping runs as
short as possible. Showers are more energy efficient than bathtubs, although it
won’t matter if you have a good solar water heater system and use it properly.
Lighting without electrical is always desirable. Use solar tubes, reflectors, ori-
entations, and so on. Celestories can provide both heating and lighting over
the course of the year. Install PV panels for whatever lights and other devices
that need electricity to operate.
If you’re building a swimming pool, consider a solar-powered pump. It will be
expensive up front, but you’ll never pay a cent to power it. This is especially
true if your house is in a region with TOU metering (see Chapter 11 for pool
systems and Chapter 17 for TOU strategies).
Roofing and ventilation
Roofing shingles should be reflective and insulative, unless you’re more
interested in a hot attic in the winter than a cool one in the summer. In either
case, consider how you’re going to vent your attic in both seasons.
You should consider placing radiant barriers in the attic space. Put these in
while you’re building the home because they’re much more difficult to install
after the fact. And the material is relatively inexpensive, considering the
potential benefit.
To keep your house cool in the summer without running the air conditioning,
install an attic vent fan, controlled by a thermostat switch, or a whole house
fan located in a central spot (see Chapter 13).
300
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 

As long as I’m talking about heating and cooling, I’ll remind you that insulation
should be as thick as you can afford.
Time to Start Pounding Nails
Hiring a contractor and going through the construction process are pretty
much the same for solar homes as they are for conventional homes. You
don’t need a contractor who has built solar homes before; the passive
aspects of the solar design are part of the blueprints, and any contractor
should be able to do the job properly.
As far as installing the solar equipment itself, a good plumber should be able to
install the solar water heating equipment. If the plumber you’ve contracted with
can’t do it, ask him to subcontract the installation to a solar installer. The entire
solar water heating system should be installed as part of the finished house.
The PV system is another story, however. The problem is that you just don’t
know how much capacity the system will need. You won’t know how much
energy your house requires until you’ve lived in it for a year or so. The
energy requirements depend on your personal habits and how the house is
affected by weather patterns. If your system is intertie, which it definitely
should be if you have the option, you won’t get anything from the utility com-
pany if you provide it with the extra power that you don’t use (see Chapter
17 for more details). Therefore, the best bet is to wait a year or so before you
install your PV system.
When you design the house and start construction, make the roof pitch and
construction optimum for PV panels. And design the PV system layout so the
installation will be quick and easy when the time finally comes. Leave room
near the fuse box for an inverter and switches.
The problem with waiting to install the PV system is that you probably want
to finance it as part of your new house. If you wait a year and decide to put in
a $25,000 system, you’ll need to come up with the cash then. You may be able
to get a home equity loan, but the terms won’t be as favorable as if you
wrapped the PV financing into the original home loan. So if you want to take
care of all the financing at once, estimate your energy needs, and install a
system that’s smaller than you think you’ll need. You can buy an oversized
inverter for the smaller system so that when you’re ready to expand it, you
only need to put in a few more solar panels to zero out your power bill. And
you may find that the smaller system keeps your power bill in the lower tiers,
so you don’t have much of an economic incentive to install that extra capac-
ity (see Chapter 6 for more details).

 Looking for a conventional home to turn in to solar

 Selling your solar home
T
he bulk of this book is dedicated to solar projects you can do in or around
your home. But perhaps you want to move in to an existing solar home
where everything is already in place. You won’t have to do any projects at all —
they’re already done for you. Or perhaps you want to buy a conventional
home that is more suitable for solar systems than your current home, and
you plan on installing the solar systems in your new place.
In addition to the usual pest, roof, and other inspections normally done for a
real estate transaction, you will need to have energy audits and solar potential
inspections. In particular, you need to understand solar equipment because
you are going to have extra responsibilities with a solar house, and those
responsibilities lie squarely on your shoulders. Add the facts that solar is
relatively new and most real estate agents don’t thoroughly understand the
ins and outs, and you realize how important it is for you to be wise about
what you’re getting into. This chapter helps you make the most of buying
(and later, selling) a solar home.
Whether buying or selling, your goal is always to get the best deal you can. With
conventional homes, this is a familiar process for everyone involved. But it gets
a little trickier with a solar home because the market is relatively untested and
things are changing fast. You need to understand how solar affects home prices
in your area. A solar home is always going to cost more than a conventional
home, and whether you’re buying or selling, you need to understand how to
put a number on this difference. This chapter shows you how.

304
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 
Buying an Existing Home with the
Intention of Installing Solar
On a drive through almost any neighborhood, you generally see one, two, or
more homes for sale. The vast majority of them won’t be solar, but who cares?
You can install solar equipment on any home. The majority of this book
addresses how to do this.
The upside to buying an existing home and converting it to solar is that the
options are much greater. You have more control over the house’s location, its
layout, and its price and size. Not to mention, you have more houses to choose
from. In some areas, solar homes are a real rarity, and you may not even be able
to find one that’s for sale. Restricting yourself to buying an existing solar home
will probably mean you’ll make some big compromises on the type and style of
home you want. This is a questionable strategy, given how important a home is
in your life.
Even if there are solar homes in your area, they probably won’t be for sale.
Homeowners rarely install expensive solar equipment right before they sell. It
takes too much work and financing to be worth it, and the returns — while
good on paper — are risky. If you do find a solar home for sale, the solar
equipment is probably older and not as efficient as new systems that take
advantage of the impressive technological improvements realized the last
decade or so.
Of course, buying a house and making it solar has other benefits and draw-
backs. I cover these in the next sections.
Dwelling on the pros
For a do-it-yourselfer, what’s better than having a blank canvas on which to
install brand-new solar projects? That’s what you get when you buy an existing,
un-solarized home. Solar projects are fun and interesting — much more so
than moving walls and redoing plumbing. Plus, you get the satisfaction of
seeing tangible results on your power bills.
When you install your own equipment, it will be brand-new with a full warranty.
New equipment is always better than old because technology is always
improving. And when you put a system in yourself, you’ll know the equipment
better, and you won’t have to trust a seller’s claims of performance.
You can also get cost savings when you do the work yourself. As a do-it-
yourselfer, you can install equipment for much less than a professional solar 

contractor. So the value you place on solar equipment will be less than what
a seller is probably going to demand for a completed solar home. Plus, you
may be able to get subsidies or tax incentives to install new solar equipment.
After you’ve lived in the home a while and know your energy usage, you can
install equipment as the need arises. You may want to install a small PV
system with the expectation of future expansion when utility rates increase.
Also, net metering (see Chapter 17) may not be available right now, but it’s
slated to be available in the future.
In some cases, you may be able to demand that some improvements be done
before you buy an existing home. Perhaps you can get a seller to install some
solar equipment or some energy-efficiency equipment as a condition of sale.
If a water heater is shot, perhaps you can demand a solar water-heating system
be put in its place. If the windows have seen better days, maybe you can talk
the sellers into installing some good double-pane windows. If you get a moti-
vated seller, you can leverage your position. You may also ask for money (to
be paid at escrow) for solar improvements and in this way tie the financing
into your original first mortgage.
Considering the cons
Buying an existing, nonsolar home that you plan to convert involves lots of
unknowns: How much power will you need? How much money will you sink
into solar systems and where will it come from? How much time and energy
will converting the house require?
With an existing home, you’ll likely need to get an energy audit, and perhaps
live in the home a few months before you know how much power you need.
When you buy a completed solar home, there’s a track record of perfor-
mance, and so the risk on return is less.
You’ll probably finance the home with a mortgage, which won’t include
money for your future solar improvements. You may be able to get a home
equity loan to pay for the upgrades, but ultimately, this will cost you more
than if you simply buy a completed solar home and wrap all the extra value
into the primary mortgage.
After you’ve figured out where the money is going to come from, you need to
determine who’s going to do these projects and when. It takes work and time
to do projects, and you may have to deal with a number of contractors. Many
people have experienced contractors often enough to know that they want to
avoid them in the future. If you’ve never worked with a contractor, be aware
that it can often be frustrating. Talk to friends, neighbors, and coworkers to
get a sense of local contractors’ quality of work.
305
Chapter 20: Buying and Selling a Solar Home

If you decide to take on the solar projects yourself, consider your resources.
Are there good hardware stores nearby? Where will you get your supplies?
Do you have enough time to tackle the projects? Do you know what you’re
doing? (I’m sure you do after reading this book. Just don’t ask your wife for
her opinion unless you’re itchin’ for an argument.) You may be able to get a
guarantee of performance when you buy a completed solar home. But when
you do the installs yourself, you don’t get any kind of guarantees, or at the
very least, they are hazy.
Getting the information you need
If you’re going to buy an existing conventional home and install your own
solar, you need to carefully and accurately evaluate the home’s suitability for
solar. Here’s a checklist:
 Get a professional energy audit, if possible. The seller may let you do
one, but it’s a tough request to grant before you’ve made an offer on her
house. It’s one thing to walk through a house; it’s quite another to climb
around in basements and attics poking tools into things. Would you want
somebody doing that to your house before you knew if he was serious?
Inspections are normally done after an offer is made and accepted.
 Evaluate existing energy equipment for potential improvements. Is the
HVAC old? Perhaps you can demand a new one be installed. How about
wood stoves or gas stoves? Are they working properly, or do they need
to be replaced? If they’re not in the house, can they be installed? Should
they be installed? Attic vents? First of all, do they exist? Secondly, do they
make sense. The latter question is tough to answer; ask the energy
auditor to take a look and make some recommendations.
 Make a list of all the solar investments that will work in your new
home. Then estimate the costs for doing each project, based on the
construction and layout of the house. This is relatively easy to plan for
active solar, like PV and hot water. But it’s going to be tougher to decide
what will work for passive, and you’ll probably find that moving walls
and cutting into ceilings isn’t really worth the cost, given the potential
savings on your power bills. Passive solar is much easier to design and
build into a home than it is to modify a home for.
 Evaluate the outside of the house as well. Do the trees shade the way they
should? Are they deciduous? If not, what will it take to rectify the situation?
Can you add a sun porch, or a trellis, that will change the nature of the
layout? How about adding overhangs over windows (see Chapter 8)?
 Read Chapter 19 on building a solar home from scratch. It details all
the things you want to do when you design an ideal, new solar home.
When you’re looking at a prospective home, compare its features with
the ideals expressed in Chapter 19. And who knows; you may become
convinced that your best bet is to build your own custom solar home.
306
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 

Buying an Existing Solar Home
Unfortunately, not too many solar homes have been built yet. This is going to
be changing quite a bit as solar power catches on, but the reality is that if
you want a solar home, you’re going to have to look long and hard, and you
may be disappointed with what you find. You can build your own solar home
(see Chapter 19), but that’s a long, difficult undertaking.
Solar communities are springing up around the country. All the homes feature
both passive and active solar, and the designs have been done by professionals
who know how to make solar systems work to their fullest potential. In some of
these communities, the houses each have their own solar PV and hot water
panels. In other communities, collective solar facilities are shared and main-
tained by a central administrative function. That way, individual homeowners
don’t need to worry about the hassle and expense of doing it themselves.
The trend toward solar communities makes a lot of sense, and you should
pursue finding a house in one of these neighborhoods, if possible. All your
neighbors will have the same equipment you’ll be using, and you’ll have a
community of support for technical problems and user issues. A ready army
of professionals will be available to help when needed, because the entire
community has an interest in maintaining trustworthy contacts.
But for most buyers, it’s going to be an individual enterprise. As usual, “Let
the buyer beware” is the rule. If you find a solar home that you’re interested
in, you need to do the usual inspections, but you also have to make sure that
the solar equipment is sound and does what it’s supposed to do. Keep in mind
that solar equipment increases the maintenance responsibility of any house;
you need to know how to use the equipment and how to take care of it, even
if it’s all in perfect working order.
Checking out the home
Armed with all of the smarts you’ve picked up reading this book, you should
be able to walk through a solar home and generally figure out if it’s up to snuff.
If you see too many things that look outdated or that don’t seem to be working
properly, move on. You want to take advantage of as much of the sun’s energy
as you can. This section explains what you should look for as you evaluate
whether a particular solar home will meet your needs.
An energy-efficiency audit is always a good idea, not just for the solar equipment,
but for the entire house. You can have this done as part of the usual due
diligence, or you may want to pay for it upfront before you start getting
serious about the house. This audit will also reinforce your conclusions 
from your evaluation of the home.

Chapter 20: Buying and Selling a Solar Home

Poking around outside
Before you even set foot in the house, you can get a feel for how effective the
solar features are by looking at the home’s orientation, structure, and land-
scaping. (For information on the ideal solar home, see Chapter 19.)
 Which way does the home face? The best bet, for solar, is a southern
front, but it doesn’t mean that the home needs to face the south. A good
solar home will have southern windows, and the family room will be on
the south, preferably with large windows shaded by deciduous trees.
 Are the deciduous trees in the right spots?
 Are there solar tubes showing on the roof? Skylights?
 Do the windows have overhangs?
 Are thermal masses being used effectively?
 Look at the roof and see if the collectors are aligned optimally. Are they
facing east or west? Could you make a few changes and get more out of
the equipment? Are there trees shading the collectors that you could cut
back to get more productivity? Are the collectors dirty or damaged?
You’ll get a roof inspection as a matter of routine. Keep in mind that not only
will you need a new roof at some point, but if solar panels have already been
installed, you’ll also have to pay to get the equipment dismantled first, and
then reassembled after the new roof is in place. You’ll also be getting no solar
production during this period.
Looking at the home’s design
You can change some things about a home’s interior. Other things you have
to live with. Here are some features to consider:
 Is the family room on the south, with big windows?
 Are the blinds strictly decorative, or do they also have functionality?
 Is the fireplace centrally located?
 An efficient home uses a large, central living space. Homes that are
spread out with meandering hallways require a lot more energy to heat
and cool, plus they use a lot more building materials.
 Utility spaces should be located in easy to access points.
 The kitchen should be adjoining the garage.
 Windows should be functional as well as decorative. The best designs
have windows that are both functional and decorative at the same time.

Inspecting the existing solar systems
You’ll want to carefully inspect any existing solar systems. The best bet is to
have a professional check them out. (Perhaps the energy auditor is qualified 
to do so; otherwise, call around, but be aware that a solar contractor may try to
sell you a new system.) You can check the systems for yourself, which is a good
idea, because if you buy the house, they’re going to become your property, and
your responsibility, so you’ll have to know how to operate and maintain them.
 Find out whether the systems can be expanded. For example, is the
inverter larger than its current output power? If so, PV panels can be
added. A hot water system can usually be expanded by adding more
collectors.
 Check the PV system. You can do this by looking at the power output on
a sunny day near solar noon.
1. Check the panels and see how far off the optimum angle they are.
2. Simply read the digital meter on the face of the inverter.
This will be the maximum amount of power you can expect to get
out of the system.
With this information, you can determine the maximum system output,
and from this amount, you can estimate the annual generation, that will
yield your cost savings. (Chapter 17 explains PV systems in great deal.)
 Are there local building department permits for the equipment? Why
not? You may want to insist on the seller getting this done, although
she’s probably going to balk because it’s a big hassle.
Asking about installation and upkeep
In all likelihood, the seller of the solar structure (how’s that for alliteration!)
will be eager to talk to you about his home. Take advantage of his passion for
his home and lifestyle and find out the following information:
 When was the equipment installed?
 Who installed the equipment?
If it’s a do-it-yourself job, have the work checked out by a pro, or check
it yourself, especially if you’re also a do-it-yourselfer.
 Where was the solar equipment purchased? Is the company still in
business? Why not?
 Who designed the solar equipment? If it’s passive, was the architect or
designer qualified? Temper this answer with some common sense. A pro
309
Chapter 20: Buying and Selling a Solar Home

can design a poor house, and a novice can design a great house (especially
if she’s read this book!). Ultimately, it’s performance that counts, not
pedigree.
 How much warranty is left? Is the warranty transferable (this is important)?
Have any warranty repairs been done? If so, pay attention to what went
wrong. If several warranty repairs have been done, beware, especially if the
warranty is about to expire.
 What records have been kept regarding system performance and 
maintenance?
 Can I look at the manuals that came with the equipment? You may be able
to get these on the Internet, but a conscientious owner (the kind you want)
should keep them. Read through the manuals and you’ll understand the
equipment and what it’s going to need by way of maintenance and repair.
If you buy the house, ask the owners to leave behind the manuals and
any maintenance records or other relevant paperwork for your reference.
Sleuthing out energy costs
If everything else about the home checks out, take a look at the power bills. If
the seller doesn’t have them, she (and sometimes you) can get them from the
utility company. If you can’t get any power bills, something is wrong. The
seller should be proud to show them off, as the vast majority of solar home
owners are.
Of course, personal habits enter into the equation, so you need to temper
what you find with a consideration of how the seller’s energy usage may
differ from your own. This may not be easy, particularly if you’re not able to
talk directly to the seller. How many people live in the house? The kind of
cars they drive often signals how they use energy in their home. If they’re all
driving enormous SUVs, it’s likely you’ll be able to do better on energy con-
servation than they do. Or you can simply ask about their energy habits,
although this is a tough nut to crack.
If some monthly bills show a total that blips up inexplicably, it could be
because the solar equipment was broken at that time. Ask why the bill
blipped, and take warning if the answer doesn’t jibe with the seller’s claims of
how often the equipment went down.
You also need to consider utilization, which is how much solar equipment is
being used versus its maximum capacity. For example, if the house has a
solar water heater, how much of its capacity is being used to offset the cur-
rent power bill? If it can put out twice as much energy as it is currently, is this
important to you? If your family is bigger, you’ll use more hot water, and you’ll
probably use more energy in general. This may or may not be reflected in
higher energy bills.
310
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 

You should also talk to the utility company and find out the following:
 Is there a net metering agreement. If so, does it carry over?
 What is the rate structure going to be? If it’s not going to be the same as
the one in place the last few years, your utility bills are going to be different.
 What are the new bills going to be? Now you’ve got some math to do,
but luckily you have my expert advice to rely on.
 Can you change the rate structure if you want?
Determining a solar home’s value
A solar home is going to cost more than a comparable conventional home. To
figure out a fair offering price, you can ask your real estate agent for an esti-
mate on how much a conventional home is worth in your potential home’s
neighborhood, and then add the value of the solar equipment.
Of course, a major transaction like buying a house is never as easy as it
sounds. You can place two sorts of values on a house: financial, based on
hard facts (this is the one the bank is interested in), and emotional, based on
how you feel about the house and what it’s worth beyond monetary value to
you. Combine these two values, and you’ve got a good idea of what you
should offer for the house.
Some banks may not add any value for solar equipment (actually, it’s more up
to the appraiser, but that’s a technicality). This can be a problem if you’re
trying to get a very high loan-to-value ratio, which is the amount of the mort-
gage you’re applying for, divided by the sales price of the house. If you have a
good down payment, it won’t matter if the bank doesn’t take the solar fea-
tures into account. If the bank’s disregard for solar becomes a problem, shop
around for different banks. While some are completely ignorant of solar,
others welcome it (see Chapter 22).
Delving in to the data
When you’re trying to figure out how much a solar home is worth, start with
getting what are called comps in the real estate business. These are the recent
sales prices of comparable homes with solar power in the same local area.
After you’ve determined the market value, you can look at the home’s features
and decide how those will influence the price. Here’s a rundown:
 How much would it cost to have a contractor come in and install all the
solar equipment that is already in place? A solar home’s equipment should
never be worth more than this, although buzz can sometimes send values
311
Chapter 20: Buying and Selling a Solar Home

higher. Plus, it’s more difficult to do projects yourself, and a lot of people
simply don’t want to, so they’ll pay more for it already in place.
 How much maintenance is there going to be? Who is going to do it? How
do you place a value that? Do you have tools and expertise?
 What is your seller claiming is the increase in value due to the equipment?
Is this reasonable? Are the promises reasonable?
Make sure to get in writing exactly what equipment is staying or going. In
most states, real estate law clearly states that if a piece of equipment is
attached to a house, it’s part of the house. Doors are part of a house, whereas
refrigerators aren’t. In theory, all of the solar equipment is part of the house.
But this is often misunderstood, particularly with regard to swimming pool
systems, which sometimes end up going with the seller to her new house.
Because you’re buying a solar house, you have one additional piece to con-
sider when it comes to determining financial value: the savings you expect to
realize from the solar power.
 How much less are the energy bills than those of a comparable conven-
tional home? Realize that you can buy more house when you don’t have
a monthly utility bill (see Chapter 6).
 Where do you think power rates are going to go in the future? If you
think they’re going to go through the roof, a solar home is worth more.
 How much is it worth to you to mitigate pollution? See Chapter 6 for a
method of calculating this rather intangible issue.
 Are there tax incentives to buying an existing solar home? You may be
eligible to get tax credits, retroactive rebates, and so on. See Chapter 21.
 What will owning a solar home do to your insurance rates? Call your
insurance agent and ask how solar equipment might affect your rates.
Listening to your heart
Many people wind up buying a home based more on emotions than on facts.
In some cases, your heart (or your gut) is right; in other instances, you need
to pay attention to all of the red flags your head is throwing at you. Consider:
 Would you buy this house if it were exactly the same structure, but without
any solar equipment? How much would you pay for it then?
 Would you want to live in this house if it weren’t solar? Why not? How
much do you value your compromise in comfort and aesthetics?
Now you’ve got a decision to make. How much do you want the house? That’s
the bottom line. Put your head together with your real estate agent’s to come
up with a competitive offer.
312
Part V: Building and Selling Your Solar Home 

Selling Your Solar Home for Big Bucks
The day will come when you need to sell your solar home. You want to get the
most money you can for your home, of course. How do you accomplish this?
Some factors come into play long before you think about parting ways with
your abode. As you install and maintain equipment, keep good records of
everything. If you can’t validate your solar claims, your systems may be
worthless. Or even more detrimental to your cause, you may cast yourself as
untrustworthy in general, because why would you be making claims if you
can’t back them up?
When you’re ready to let the world know your home is for sale, find a real
estate agent who knows solar houses and can help you capitalize on the
“buzz” of solar homes. The right agent will let the right buyers know you’ve
got a solar home for sale. At present, most people have no clear idea what
solar means. They don’t really care about a solar house, and these people
aren’t likely to pay more for your solar home than they would pay for a con-
ventional home. As energy rates rise, this will change out of necessity. But
one thing is always true of marketing: You need to reach the right market to
get the best price.
You are going to price your home higher than a conventional home, and
rightly so. But if you don’t reach the right market, your home won’t sell, and
then you’ll have a reputation in local real estate circles for trying to sell a
home that’s overpriced.
The initial entry of a home onto a market is the most important timeframe
because the longer a house sits on the market waiting for a buyer to come
along, the less interest real estate agents have in showing it. Even if you sub-
sequently lower your price, they still aren’t going to get as enthused as they
do with a house that’s new on the market and priced correctly.
It’s very important to price a home properly upfront. The starting point is comps
(comparable house sales prices in your area), but after that, it’s a question of
experience and an ability to read the market. A good realtor can tell you exactly
what your house will sell for. Most sellers, however, pressure the realtor to list
the house at a higher price because they want more (of course), but they’re also
unrealistic. If you hire a realtor who is listed as a top producer, you’ll get one
you can and should trust. Top producers cost the same as other Realtors, but
come with an important pedigree.
There is no formula for what you can get for a solar home over a conventional
home. Home values vary greatly from region to region, but the cost of solar is
313
Chapter 20: Buying and Selling a Solar Home

relatively constant, so the percentage difference for a solar home is going to
vary from region to region. The key is to get a realtor who is on the same page
as you and ask about her solar experience. Most listings appear on the Internet
these days. Make sure to include the words green and solar as keywords. In the
MLS listing, use the same words. Stress the fact that the utility bills are lower;
you may even want to parade that fact on the top of any brochures and fliers
that the realtor produces. You can even notify local environmental groups, such
as the Sierra Club.
Finally, make sure to read the earlier sections in this chapter on buying a solar
home. Understand that now you’re on the opposite side of the table. Throughout
the process of showing the house, landing a potential buyer, and negotiating a
deal, you and the buyer will be at odds over some things. They want to pay the
lowest price possible; you want to receive as much money as you can from the
deal. They want documentation and maybe some upgrades or repairs. You want
to minimize your headaches and any additional expenditures. But on the other
hand, you’ll both want some of the same things — a smooth transaction and a
house that lives up to its solar potential. With a little patience and some help
from your real estate agent, you can make it all work out.

breaks, rebates, and the like. And I give some good advice

T
he fact is, solar power is not a cut-and-dried winner in terms of investments.
(Chapter 6 details payback analysis techniques that you can use to calcu-
late the value of a solar investment to compare it with other types of invest-
ments.) The bottom line for a solar investment depends on three things in
particular: cost of energy (which will rise); amount of sunlight available
(which varies greatly from region to region — see Chapter 5); and cost of
solar equipment
Although basic equipment costs don’t vary much between regions, one thing
that does affect how much you pay for your system by region is government
subsidies. This chapter details the basic ideas behind subsidies and then shows
you how to do your own research to determine how best to obtain and use them.
The Different Types of Subsidies
Governments have recognized the value of solar energy, especially in achieving
a more pollution-free energy consumption. Plus, solar power has the potential
to free North America from reliance on foreign oil, which is desirable from 
a political stability standpoint. (Getting oil from the Mideast creates a lot of
problems.) Governments also recognize the marginal nature of a solar invest-
ment, and they’ve resolved to do something on the cost end of the equation
(some politicians may claim to be able to do something on the sunshine supply
end, but as usual they’re just blowing hot air).

318
Part VI: Finding the Moolah to Do the Job 
Subsidies, where the government helps you pay for part of the cost of your solar
system, are very powerful incentives to invest in solar, and a solar customer
can see up to a 50-percent cost reduction by using all the subsidies available.
However, the subsidies scene is constantly changing, so it’s impossible to
specify the precise details of subsidies and rebates simply because they’re
apt to change without notice. I list a number of resources for you to consult
to find the timely information that you will need.
The following sections describe the types of subsidies available.
Rebates
A rebate is money given back to a customer after he or she makes a purchase.
Manufacturer’s rebates work the same as they do for other products. You buy
a solar system or component, and the manufacturer gives you either an instant
rebate at the checkout or one that you need to mail in with proof-of-purchase.
Government solar rebates operate basically the same way. The rebate is paid
directly to the professional solar contractor, so the customer doesn’t need to
finance the entire investment and then wait to get the rebate back. This is, in
effect, a secondary rebate because it allows solar customers to more easily
purchase their systems. But because these rebates come from government
sources, they’re also laden with overwrought details generally incomprehen-
sible to the average layperson.
For example, here’s how rebates work in California. For a PV system, you can
get up to 25 percent of the cost of a system in rebates, but the amount depends
on the system’s productivity. So the state has a very specific computer program
that potential customers use to predict system performance. Inputs are the
following:
 Your geographical area: Data banks show the statistical weather patterns
in your area. This includes cloud density and frequency, average temper-
atures, air density, and the like. Your latitude also gives an indication of
sunlight exposure. All these numbers combined yield a measure of how
much sunlight you can expect in a given year. Some microclimates (a
climate that, because of terrain, landscaping, and other factors, may
differ from a climate only a mile away) may have much less sunshine
than a nearby area, so be prepared for some surprises here.
 The size and orientation of your solar collectors: The greatest solar
exposure comes from a specific roof angle (depending on your latitude)
and a specific azimuth angle, namely true south (see Chapter 5 for
details). For any angles other than these, you get a lower rebate. If your
roof is all wrong, not only do you get a lower rebate, but you also get
less productivity as well.

To maximize your rebate, you may be able to mount your solar collec-
tors on the ground and get all the angles just perfect. You can also get a
higher rebate by employing adjustable mounts that track the sun over
the course of a year — and result in greater productivity.
 Any shading issues inherent to the collector location: A special hemi-
spheric reflector device is used to measure the relative location and
shading effects of trees, mountains, chimneys, other buildings, and so on.
The device can tell whether these impediments will affect your solar expo-
sure at any time of the year. A computer program translates this data into a
single number that tells how much solar potential your collector site has.
 The efficiency of your system: This is also related to a system’s 
productivity. Manufacturers must define a system’s efficiency, but this
number also depends on where the collectors are located. (If they’re 
on the northern side of your roof, the score goes down.) The overall
system productivity is what’s of interest; this is the total amount of
energy a system will produce in a given year. The government is subsidizing
energy production, not a system. It’s a fine point of distinction, but it makes
sense. (As a matter of interest, in California, you may choose to get your
subsidy after the system is installed instead of using forms and paperwork
to calculate a theoretical efficiency when the system is installed. In this
way, the actual performance is used to gauge how big the subsidy will be,
which often results in a larger subsidy than the necessarily conservative
theoretical.)
For a perfect solar location, the state rebates 25 percent of the cost of your
solar system (acceptable market costs are specified so that you can’t get a
higher rebate for a system that’s out of market pricing guidelines). In actual-
ity, 25 percent is rare. Most numbers come in around 20 to 24 percent. When
they come in much lower, your solar investment quickly loses allure.
You may run into a buy-down caveat: As time progresses, the rebates are
scheduled to decrease, which encourages solar customers to buy now
instead of later. The reason for this is reasonable: The basic idea with subsi-
dies is that they’ll force the cost of solar to come down over time, so why
invest now? Why not just wait until prices do come down? But if everybody
were to have this philosophy, prices would never drop. Ideally, as the rebates
diminish, prices will come down, so the net cost of a system won’t change
over time. (Well, okay, but when do government programs ever work the way
they’re supposed to?)
The effect of this rebate has been wildly popular in California, which has some
of the highest power rates in the country, plus the prospect of seeing greater
increases in energy rates than the rest of the country due to the robust
environmental laws that the state legislature is passing. In addition, Californians
remember (not fondly) the energy price spikes that resulted in companies like
Enron playing with energy prices, resulting in higher profits for the company
at the expense of the energy consumers. There were blackouts and brownouts
and power outages in the middle of steamy, sunny afternoons.
319
Chapter 21: Subsidizing Your Solar Projects with Other People’s Money

Tax credits
Tax credits, which are subtracted from the amount you owe on your state or
federal taxes, are an increasingly common form of subsidy. You must buy a
certain type of system to qualify, and the credit is taken on your tax return,
either state or federal. As a result, you must carry the cost until your return
is filed, and any refund comes back to you. This wait can take more than a
year, depending on when you buy a system.
A tax credit is far better than a tax deduction because a tax deduction is sub-
tracted from your taxable income. So if you’re paying a marginal tax rate of 28
percent and you get a deduction of $1,000, you save $280. But tax credits
come out of the amount you owe, so a $1,000 tax credit saves you $1,000.
Both tax deductions and tax credits may be available for a solar system. Many
times, both the federal and state governments are offering programs, and the
terms will vary. It’s important to understand the distinction between credits
and deductions because they make a big difference on the bottom line.
Here’s an example. The U.S. federal government allows a 30-percent tax credit
for both solar PV systems and solar water heating systems, up to a maximum
of $2,000 per year. If your solar water heater system costs $6,000 to install,
you get $1,800 off the price. If your solar PV system costs $30,000, you get
only $2,000 off the price. This savings encourages smaller solar investments
because you save a greater percentage.
To maximize your tax credits, spread your solar investments out over time.
Install a solar water heater this year and a PV system the next. And if 
possible, install two smaller systems instead of one larger.
No property tax increases
Many states have laws that prevent your property taxes from rising due to
the increase in value of your home from a solar investment. So if you install a
$40,000 PV system, your county can’t reassess your property and charge you
extra taxes for having a home that’s worth $40,000 more. Very few other
investments qualify for this exemption, and because it’s basically being paid
for by the government, it’s a tax break.
Incentives for home-operated businesses
The incentives for businesses are even greater than those for residences, so
if you have a home business or office, you may qualify for higher tax credits
and rebates. Why? One reason is that businesses use most of their energy in
320
Part VI: Finding the Moolah to Do the Job 

the middle of the afternoon, so they’re less apt to go for solar energy when
there’s net metering (see Chapter 17 for more on net metering). Another is
that the green spirit that motivates many solar investments (thereby making
the investment more attractive than mere numbers would imply because you
save pollution as well as money) doesn’t exist for businesses. (For a way to put
a dollar value on pollution savings, see Chapter 6.)
Businesses can also take advantage of accelerated depreciation schedules for
solar equipment. This stuff can get complex; ask your tax preparer for the
details. (Ugh! Now I sound like one of those irritating mortgage-broker
commercials on the radio.)
Net metering
Utilities aren’t particularly enthusiastic about offering rebates, nor do they
really want residential customers to hook solar equipment up to the grid.
Recognizing this, the 1978 federal Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA)
mandates local utilities to pay “avoided” or wholesale costs to entities that
want to sell it. This is the basis for net metering (see Chapter 17). It makes solar
PV investment very viable (see Chapter 17 for details of the whys and where-
fores). Without net metering, solar PV would be no more than a rare novelty.
States often have even more stringent net metering rules. In California, the
utilities must pay you the same rate that they charge for power. For example,
if you’re on a TOU (time of use) rate schedule, the utility must pay you the same
rates it’s charging its customers at different times of the day. This arrangement
is a very strong incentive for using solar power because the highest power rates
always apply in the middle of the afternoon. Midafternoon is the highest demand
period because businesses are all using air conditioners at the same time, but
it’s also the time when solar PV systems are outputting at the maximum rate.
So if you have a PV intertie system, you can plan your power consumption to
take advantage of the non-symmetric exchange of energy (see Chapter 17 for
the technical details).
Tax-deductible home equity loans
Although they may not be a direct subsidy of solar power systems, tax-
deductible home equity loans are akin to a government subsidy. If you take out
a second mortgage to pay for your solar equipment, the government lets you
deduct the interest on that loan from your taxes. So if you’re making a monthly
payment of, say, $300 for a second mortgage, your net cost may be only $200.
The tax-deductible home equity loan works exactly like a subsidy, but it’s
called something else. See Chapter 22 for more details on financing.

Researching All the Subsidy Options
Things are changing so fast that it’s impossible to keep up with all the gov-
ernment programs. I can only point you in the right direction and give you a
nudge. Your job is to poke around and get all the details for yourself. Here’s
how to research the subject further:
 Talk to your tax preparer. Tax preparers should be versed in the details
of solar tax credits, but if not, they can still access the information sources
they need to process your rebates and tax credits. Solar is relatively new,
so give preparers a break if they don’t know the details upfront, but keep
at them to find out if they don’t. Expect to pay more for your tax prepa-
ration because there will be more forms (practically indecipherable to
the average layperson, so if you’re thinking about preparing your own,
be forewarned).
 Ask contractors. Solar contractors need to know about subsidies
because they help sell systems. PV contractors are experts at tax credits
and rebates, and they’ll usually help you process them as well. Even if
you’re going to do the installation yourself, you can get good informa-
tion from contractors when you ask them for competitive quotations.
 Contact utility companies. Utilities will give you information, although
they don’t necessarily want to. But they have to (it’s required by law), so
if you push a little, you can get all kinds of information, and it’s almost
always free. You can find a customer service number on your utility bill.
When you call, ask if a particular department is dedicated to subsidies.
 Search online. Of course, the Internet is a great source of information.
Use a search engine to look up key words like “solar energy tax incen-
tives,” “solar power rebates,” and so on. One thing will lead to another,
and who knows where you’ll end up?
When doing research, keep in mind that there are subsidies for all kinds of
other systems beside solar. For example, if you install an energy-efficient front
door, you may qualify for a 10-percent tax credit. Gas fireplaces may get you a
credit. Be expansive in your search, and you can find all kinds of little goodies.

M
any solar projects are inexpensive enough that you don’t need to worry
about coming up with the dough (see Chapter 9 in particular). Some
projects are in the middle of the expense range, where it could go either way.
But the biggest and brightest undertakings are often expensive enough that
you need to borrow money to purchase and install them. This chapter covers
the various financing options and offers sage advice on how best to proceed
with the banks and financial institutions that offer the loans.
When you apply for a loan, regardless of where you apply, the main factor the
bank is interested in is risk, which is the likelihood that you’ll default on your
payments or perpetually make late payments. When risk is high, the loan’s
interest rate is high; it’s very simple. If you want to take out a loan for a solar
project, your job is to convince the financial institution that you constitute
low risk.
In this chapter, I show you how to increase your odds of successfully obtaining
a good loan (that is to say, one with a low interest rate).
Financing through Loans
The government is interested in promoting solar power, so it has a wide range
of loan subsidies available. In essence, the government accepts part of the risk
of a loan, so a bank can offer you a lower interest rate. It’s worth your while to
spend some time looking into the various government programs because you
can often get a loan for better terms. Chapter 21 gives you more details on
subsidies.

Borrowing money the old-fashioned way
When people need large amounts of money, they either look to a bank or
whip out their credit cards. To finance your big solar projects, you can
pursue several types of loans:
 Home equity loans are the most common loans and the best options. If
you’re contemplating a large solar project, you probably own your own
home. (Why would anybody install a big solar system on a home she’s
renting?)
In parts of the country where real estate values are rising, homeowners
enjoy equity, which is the difference between what’s owed in mortgages
on the home and the home’s market value (or appraised value, which
should be the same but rarely is). You can use your equity to get a loan at
a much lower interest rate because the bank’s risk is greatly reduced by
using real estate as collateral (the goods the bank will take if you don’t
pay on your loan). The bank won’t need to come after the equipment
you’ve financed because the bank can go after the house itself (banks
generally don’t care what you do with the money, so they may not even
know about your solar equipment). Homeowners plan to pay off their
debt long before they let a bank take their home away. Home equity loans
are generally tax deductible (consult your tax preparer for details).
 Supplier loans are available from manufacturers and suppliers who pro-
vide solar equipment. However, solar vendors generally sign up with an
equity loan broker and simply act as the sales outlet for somebody else’s
loans. You can probably find a better interest rate if you go directly to a
bank, but the convenience may offset the cost. Or solar vendors may
actually offer better terms because they have a strong incentive to close
a sale, and making inexpensive financing available helps considerably.
These companies use the equipment itself as collateral for the loan. Supplier
loans are similar to automobile loans that dealerships offer when you buy
a vehicle. The car is collateral, and if you don’t pay the loan, a repo man
(or woman) comes to your house late at night and takes back the car —
perfectly legal. If you default on a supplier loan for your solar equipment,
the company may send someone in the middle of the night to grab the
collectors off your roof — you probably won’t mistake him for Santa Claus!
 Consumer loans don’t require any collateral, so the lender’s risk is high.
You can get a credit card with a $30,000 credit limit far more easily than
should ever be possible. The reason it’s so easy? The interest rate is sky
high; the bank expects a number of defaults and lets the customers who
don’t default cover the losses from the ones who do. Plus, you don’t get
any sort of tax deduction on the interest.
Consumer loans are the modern version of loan shark products,
although the creditors no longer break your fingers when you default. If
you’re a good credit risk, avoid consumer loans like the plague.

Exploring home energy ratings
A less-traditional option of financing your major solar project is through an
energy-efficient financing program, but your home has to qualify for the program.
To qualify, you need to have your home audited and rated by a licensed
expert. He or she will do an energy audit (see Chapter 2) and write a report that
estimates annual energy use and costs. You can also expect some recommen-
dations for improvements that you’ll have to implement as a loan-approval
condition. To get the best loan terms, you have to convince the financing
institution that the improvements you plan to fund with the loan proceeds
make sense in the grand scheme of things. That’s reasonable.
If things look good, you can get special energy-efficient financing programs that
have lower interest rates than conventional loans. Keep in mind, however, 
that with these loans, you’ll be required to pay for the energy audit and 
deal with government agencies.
Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET) is a network of mortgage
bankers, builders, and others. RESNET has solar loan programs available for
the right customers. Check them out at www.natresnet.org.
Pursuing energy efficient mortgages
There are two types of energy efficient mortgages (EEMs): those for either new
or existing homes. You can obtain one of these loans for a new home, an
existing home, or a refinance. The advantage is a lower interest rate, which is
subsidized by the federal government.
Here’s a quick breakdown of who’s providing what, but keep in mind that I’m
talking about the government, so terms and programs are subject to change
at a lawmaker’s whim:
 Fannie Mae: The Federal National Mortgage Association encourages
lenders to provide EEMs by establishing guidelines and certain types of
incentives. Check out what’s available at www.fanniemae.com. You can
also get a list of lenders who have signed on with the programs.
 Freddie Mac: The Federal Home Mortgage Loan Corporation does the
same basic things as Fannie Mae but is generally more interested in long-
term loans. Check out its offerings at www.freddiemac.com.
 Farmer Mac: This agency is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and
is for those of you who are down on the farm. Go to www.usda.gov for
details.

Chapter 22: Financing Your Solar Investments

Thinking about other mortgage options
Here are some other potentially useful government agencies:
 Department of Energy (DOE) at www.doe.gov.
 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) at
www.hud.gov.
 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at www.va.gov/vas/loan.
State agencies often provide subsidized loans as well. Check out the
prospects at www.naseo.org, the Web site for the National Association of
State Energy Officials.
Considering Alternative Financing
You also may want to look at some other financing programs. In the sections
that follow, I go over a couple of your options: leasing equipment or buying
remote parcels of land so you can generate power and sell it back to the power
company.
Leasing solar equipment
In one new idea that’s taking hold, companies install solar equipment on your
roof, but they retain ownership of the equipment. You lease the equipment
from them for a fixed monthly cost or a percentage of the system’s produc-
tion, which works nicely if you save more on your power bill than the
monthly cost of the lease. Or alternatively, you can use these programs to
lock in the cost of your energy so that when it rises, you won’t be bitten like
everyone else. You don’t have to have any cash upfront, and this is often a
very popular way to finance a big purchase, as evidenced by how many vehi-
cles are leased on the same basic principle.
Ultimately, it’s almost always a better investment to finance the equipment
yourself and purchase it rather than lease it. But many people simply don’t
have the cash, they want to put their money into something else, or they
don’t want to sign up for a loan that appears on their credit report.
Be aware that, just as with cars, solar equipment has a residual value (the
defined value that is estimated at the beginning of the lease; this amount may
or may not be the actual market value) at the end of the lease. If your solar
equipment has decreased in value for some reason (not super-likely, but it can
happen), you may have to pay a big chunk of change to get out of the lease.
326
Part VI: Finding the Moolah to Do the Job 

Buying an energy-producing plot of land
Another concept that’s likely to grow in the coming years is an ownership
concept in which you don’t actually install your solar equipment at your resi-
dence. Instead, a company buys land in Nevada or somewhere really sunny.
The company divides the parcel up into small plots, each around 40' x 40'.
Using cash or some other kind of financing package, you buy the plot of land
and a solar PV system that’s installed on your plot and connected to the grid.
The energy production belongs to you, and the equipment belongs to you. In
practical terms, this is really no different than if the equipment were at your
house, except nobody can see it, and you don’t have to maintain it. Plus the
equipment is probably in a sunnier location without any shade hindrances.
Whether this concept works or not in your area depends on whether a utility
company will allow it. Most won’t pay you for excess power averaged over
the course of a year. When you install an intertie system at your house, if you
generate more power than you use, you’ve wasted that power because you
won’t get anything for it. Obviously, with this remote location setup, there’s
no power use, only generation, so the entire thing earns credit. The good
news is that the idea makes so much sense that governments are beginning
to require utilities to accept the program, whether they want to or not (Okay,
they don’t want to; why would any business agree to reduce its market?).
Remote ownership plans have plenty of advantages for the average homeowner.
You can buy your solar equipment for much less. The company doesn’t have
to come to your residence to install the panels. All the systems are basically
the same construction but in different sizes. Maintenance is straightforward
and cheap, and the land is cheap. The productivity is high, and because the
electric circuits are conjoined centrally, efficiency is much better. It’s estimated
that if 100 square miles of Nevada desert (of which there’s no shortage) were
covered with solar PV panels, the nation’s electrical needs would be met with
almost zero carbon emission.
Working with Banks (Their Way
or the Highway)
Banks have very rigid rules and procedures for lending money, and the people
you’ll be talking to have absolutely no power to alter these. When you’re ready
to talk to someone about getting cash for your project, you need to package
your proposal to meet the bank’s expectations, or you’re wasting your time.
Keep in mind that you, the borrower, aren’t the bank’s primary customer. A
bank’s customers are the people who give it money, not the people who borrow
it. Banks make profits by lending you money at higher rates than it has to pay its
customers for the money.
327
Chapter 22: Financing Your Solar Investments

Banks are also concerned with risk, and they constantly strive to make loans
at the lowest risk possible. When somebody defaults on a mortgage, espe-
cially a second mortgage, it’s very costly for the bank.
If you want to do business with a bank, present yourself as a low-risk proposi-
tion. Get all your papers in perfect order. Get a copy of your credit report and
make sure there are no surprises (banks hate surprises!). Look smart, be smart,
and be prompt. When they demand more information, don’t whine. Always
remember that most of what loan officers do is search for a reason to deny
you a loan; that’s how they reduce the bank’s risk. Basically, all they can do is
say yes or no.
Don’t take the process personally. It certainly isn’t personal. You are but a
spoke in the wheel, or worse, you are but a Social Security number in the flesh.
Your property is the collateral for the loan, and it’s critical in the risk-reduction
process. To convince the bank that your property is ideal collateral, you have
to convince the bank that if you default on the loan, it’ll be able to sell your
house quickly for a good price. Houses that are odd in character (off-grid home!
Beware! — see Chapter 18) or that require modifications prior to sale (purple
and yellow paint!) can cause hiccups. Banks want vanilla flavors for the same
exact reason that you see mostly vanilla ice cream at the grocery store —
because everybody wants it.
Keep in mind, however, that reducing risk isn’t necessarily bad because 
you and the bank are on the same wavelength here. The bank wants your
house to be worth as much as possible, and so do you. If you want to find 
out how to make your house more attractive as collateral, ask a real estate
agent how to make your house worth more money.
Rules are the vernacular of banks. There are soft rules and hard rules, and if
you don’t pass a hard rule, you’re automatically rejected. Here are some typi-
cal hard rules that you may encounter (your bank’s rules may be different;
this is just an example to demonstrate the scope):
 Borrowers must have a credit score of 620 or better.
• A score of 720 and above means you’re golden. You can get whatever
you want.
• If your score is 680 to 719, you’ll get a loan after jumping through
some hoops.
• A score of 620 to 679 means you’ll pay more interest and may have
to be patient and work long and hard to produce extra documentation
for the bank before they’ll give you a loan.
• With a score below 620, you’re going to have to save up for a while
if you want solar.
328
Part VI: Finding the Moolah to Do the Job 

 The loan-to-value ratio (a home’s value to total secured loans) must be
70 percent or less.
 The property can’t be off-grid.
 The property must be occupied by you, not a renter.
If you don’t meet these hard criteria, you’re denied — period. On the other
hand, some rules can be finessed when appropriate:
 A borrower’s debt-to-income ratio (the total amount of money you owe,
divided by your gross income) must be less than 50 percent. This usually
means the ratio after you get the loan, not before.
 The borrower needs an average bank balance of $2,000.
 The borrower must have a job or other source of income.
 Credit card balances must not exceed certain limits.
 The content in your credit report must be favorable. Credit reports are
important. They contain your credit score and other little tidbits of
information about you, such as how often you’ve been late in your
payments, your current credit card balances, and so on. You can always
put a statement of your own into a credit report, but nobody will believe
you if the numbers are contrary.
You’ll probably also need to provide recent tax returns when you apply for a
loan. Banks review your return to find out the source of your income and how
much you earn. Salaries are the safest form of income, followed by commissions.
Self-employed individuals are a little dicier, but if your income is consistent over
time, you can get by. Other income, like rental income, is offset by losses, so
always pay attention to the net result because the bank certainly will.
Cash or liquid assets are an excellent way to reduce your risk in the bank’s
eyes. “But wait,” you say. “Why would I get a loan if I have cash?” Actually,
having $20,000 in cash or other liquid assets is always an excellent financial
strategy because it reduces risk (that golden word, once again). You can
make interest off of the cash while it’s in a bank, and you pay interest for bor-
rowing other money, but that’s tax deductible. Ultimately, you’ll be out a
little, in a net sense, but if your family suffers a financial disaster or a health
crisis, you’ll have cash to tide you over, and that’s music to a bank’s ears. So
for those of you who have cash, you still may want to take out a loan.
In this vein, if you have stocks, bonds, and other investments, you’ll have an
easy time getting a loan, even if these other financial holdings aren’t used as
collateral. It’s very easy to get a loan when you don’t need one, because
that’s the type of low-risk situation banks are looking for.

 Identifying the best money-saving propositions in solar power
 Making your house look a lot better
 Creating a more comfortable home environment
I
n this book, I describe hordes of projects and improvements you can tackle.
Your personal situation dictates the type of solar investment that’s best for
your own home, but some projects stand out because they’re practical for nearly
every homeowner, in both monetary and aesthetic terms. In this chapter, I
give you my list of the ten best solar investments, based on my own experience
and the feedback from others who have also worked with solar.
Nurturing Mother Nature 
with Landscaping
Okay, landscaping isn’t strictly solar if what you’re looking for is technology
that grabs sunlight and puts it to work in a constructive way. But you don’t
always need to grab photons and train them to get the most benefit out of the
sun. Landscaping is the hands-down winner of the best solar project because
you get so much in return. (Note that I didn’t say monetary return. My personal
opinion is that monetary return, strictly on its own merits, doesn’t really
have all that much merit.)
Planting hearty, healthy, happy deciduous trees in the right location around
your house gives you cooler summers and warmer winters, but most of all,
you can look out your windows and be reminded of why we care so much
about our planet Earth.
Planting bushes, shrubs, and trees as windbreaks allows you to enjoy natural
breezes in your home, without the sound of whirring fan blades to remind
you of technology.

334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Plants create oxygen out of carbon dioxide, the modern bugaboo of environ-
mentalism. If the world had enough trees, global warming wouldn’t be such
an imposing issue.
And finally, you get yourself outdoors and you get exercise when you do your
own landscaping. There’s a certain simplicity to digging a hole. It’s about as
close to nature as you can possibly get, and that in itself is justification.
Installing PV Systems to Offset 
the Most Carbon Pollution
PV is the grand dame of solar investments and is going to experience hyper
growth over the coming years. In Chapter 2, I tell you how to calculate your
carbon footprint, and the results generally shock most people. You can get a
feel for just how much humans affect the environment when you realize that,
on average, economically active Americans are responsible for nearly 40,000
pounds of carbon dioxide per capita.
When you install a large PV solar system, you cut out a tremendous amount
of pollution because our electrical power grids are extremely inefficient. For
each kWh of energy you create with a PV system, you save five or six times
that much utility-generated power, most of which comes from coal-fired plants
in North America. PV systems allow for tremendous environmental leverage,
and that will never change.
Strictly from a monetary standpoint, PV systems are becoming more competi-
tive, and as energy rates rise, they will become good investments. But even if
you pencil out the investment and it doesn’t look too good (because your power
bills aren’t that high, or you don’t get all that much sunshine), you can use a
technique that I present in Chapter 6 to modify your financial analysis with a
valuation of pollution mitigation, and you’ll probably come to the conclusion
that a large PV system makes sense.
In addition, when you install a PV system, you lock in your energy rates for a
long time, namely at zero. If you think energy rates are going to rise precipi-
tously, PV is almost always a great investment. And really — what else is
going to force America off its oil addiction than high energy rates?
Using a Solar Swimming Pool Heater
When you install a solar heating system on your swimming pool, you can use
your pool more than you would without a heater. The water temperature is
much more comfortable, and you can swim over a longer season.

The average swimming pool costs around $25,000 to install. It takes up a big
chunk of your backyard and requires a lot of maintenance. With all the time
and money you put into your pool, it’s probably the most expensive luxury
you will ever purchase.
You can use a pool without a solar heater for about four months, but at the
beginning and end of the season, the water is freezing, and you go swimming
because you spent so much on the pool and you’re bound and determined to
use it. But when you install a solar heater, you can use your pool for half the
year, and the water temperature is more comfortable for that entire time. A
$5,000 pool system makes your $25,000 pool investment much more sensible.
(See Chapter 11 for more on capturing solar power to heat your pool.)
From a pollution standpoint, a solar heater is ideal (zero pollution) compared
to the sinful alternatives (propane and electric).
Putting a Cover on Your Swimming Pool
I can hear the howls of indignation over this one. Swimming pool covers are a
hassle. But for the price, they have a huge effect on how you enjoy your pool.
Swimming pool covers basically accomplish the same thing as solar pool heaters
(see the previous section) but cost about 3 percent as much (they’re about
$150). They keep a pool cleaner, so you save on chemicals as well.
If you’re in a climate where you don’t need a pool heater during the summer,
you can extend the swimming season a month or two by using a cover only a
month before and a month after you would normally use the pool. Chapter 11
explains additional benefits of swimming pool covers.
You can attach the cover to a retracting mechanism so that you won’t hate your
cover like you would if you had to fold it by hand every time you swim. The
cheapest manual retractors cost around $300. You also can install an electric
retractor, but now you’re talking about the kind of money you’d spend on a
solar water heater, so you might as well put in one of those instead.
Harnessing the Sun to Heat Your Water
Solar water heaters, when properly designed and installed, are great invest-
ments because they are much cheaper than PV systems, which are often out
of the average person’s financial range. Most homeowners can afford a few
thousand dollars for a solar water heater system without taking out loans.
335
Chapter 23: Ten Best Solar Investments

A benefit of solar water heaters is that you’ll never need to conserve on hot
water, regardless of how high energy rates go. It makes no sense to use a
solar system at less than its full capacity, because it saves nothing.
From a pollution standpoint, heating water typically comprises around 18
percent of your power bill, so you can save exactly that much from your
carbon footprint.
As far as utility costs, if you’re on a tiered rate structure, a solar water heater
cuts into the most expensive part of your power bill first. For example, if you
save 18 percent of the electrical energy you use, you may be able to save
about 30 percent of your total power bill (see Chapter 6 for more details).
Lighting Your Yard All Night Long
For little cost, you can put a range of fun and interesting lights around your
yard. They charge during the daylight hours and come on at night. They need
little sunlight, given the amount of light they put out.
The alternatives are awkward, clumsy, and demanding. Low-voltage systems
have thick-gauge wires that you need to run around your yard, tripping
people and getting chewed up by the dog. And the lengths of runs you can
get away with are limited because the wire is so expensive.
Putting in solar lighting is as simple as one, two, three. And if you don’t like
the way things look, changing the layout is as simple as four, five, six. Try the
static lights and the changing-color decorative lights. You can get a whole
range of different mounting schemes, so you can place the lights anywhere.
(Chapter 8 has more info on solar lighting.)
My experience is that the lights don’t even need to be in direct sunlight. Put
them under a tree, and they’ll work. You also can get ones that have the PV
panels connected to the light by a wire, so you can put the PV panel in direct
sunlight and the light under your porch roof.
Redecorating for Functionality
and Appearance
Window blinds make a big difference in the overall look and comfort level of
your home. Windows attract a lot of attention (they break up walls, which are
monotonous), and they’re a source of natural sunlight. The eye is naturally
drawn to a window, particularly a big one in your family room or living room.
336
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

The fact is, windows are a major source of heat transfer. In the summer, windows
let in too much heat energy by both radiative sunlight and conductive move-
ment. In the winter, windows allow a lot of heat to escape by conduction. Your
house would be much more energy efficient if it didn’t have any windows at
all, but this setup is absurd. The solution? Put in window blinds that have
good insulation and reflective properties.
With the right blinds, you can significantly reduce heat transfer as well as reflect
most incident sunlight. The functional effect is dramatic. The aesthetic is even
more so, if you choose the right ones. (Chapter 9 has suggestions on what sorts
of blinds to hang where.) Large windows in family rooms and living rooms are
the best candidates for installing blinds. You get the most bang for the buck
when you cover these large areas of glass.
Putting Up Overhangs to Make Your
Home More Comfortable
By using overhangs to shade your southern windows appropriately, you can
increase natural warming in the winter and prevent overheating in the summer.
You also can improve the natural light in your home by increasing the amount
of sunshine you let in during the winter, when you want as much light as
poss-ible (it makes you feel warmer, and perception is half the game), and 
by decreasing it in the summer, when a lot of light makes you feel hot.
Controlling the sun as it shines into your house lets you regulate the temperature
variations. Nobody likes a home where the temperature swings wildly over the
course of a day. And temperature variations tend to make materials swell and
shrink, which causes cracking and premature wear. When you install a well-
designed overhang over a porch or sunroom, you minimize temperature
variations.
Overhangs are very reasonable do-it-yourself projects (Chapter 8 has more
details). You don’t need electrical experience or plumbing know-how. There
are usually no extraordinary weight requirements that entail consulting a pro-
fessional engineer. And if you keep things modest, you don’t need to get a
county building permit or permission from an association design committee.
Increasing Your Living Space
You can add a solar room onto your home for far less cost than a conventional
room. You can put in nearly any size you want, and do-it-yourself kits are
straightforward and well designed. You can build a solar room out of aluminum
337
Chapter 23: Ten Best Solar Investments

or wood, and you can put in however many and whatever size windows you
want. You can incorporate a concrete floor (for maximum thermal mass), or
you can use an existing wooden or synthetic deck.
If you do it right, you can build a solar room without getting a building permit
(forego electric power and don’t connect it permanently to your house). You
can build a solar room out of plastic corrugated materials that cost very
little. You can grow plants in a greenhouse year round, or if you want to get
really exotic you can grow fruits, flowers, or vegetables. If you choose to
build a sunroom, you can use it as extra living space when it’s not too hot. If
you insulate it well, you’ll have a family room for about one-tenth the cost of
adding to your house.
Banishing Hot Air with 
a Solar Attic Vent Fan
If you’ve ever gone into your attic on a hot summer day, you know what real
heat is all about. It can get so hot that it’s dangerous. Temperatures over
160°F are not uncommon. All that heat stays up there all night, and it tries to
sink into your house through the insulation in your ceiling. Most homes have
passive, natural venting schemes in the attic, but that doesn’t do much to get
the hot air out of your house.
A properly designed solar attic vent fan can move a lot of air (see Chapter 13)
over the course of a day. The system works hardest when there’s a lot of 
sunshine. You don’t need to run expensive electrical power up to the fan,
which means you can install one just about anywhere you want.
As a do-it-yourself solar project, it’s ideal because you get to use some PV
panels, which is fun (if your definition of fun is cool hardware). You won’t get
any electrical shocks from the low voltages, and the tools required are minimal.
You can complete the project in one day, and you’ll discover a lot about your
house by studying the layout and functionality of your attic.

Using Just About Every Tool in the Box 
to Install a Solar Water Heater
If you want to install a solar water heater, you have to be good at plumbing,
electrical wiring, solder joints, PV panel installation, copper tube cutting,
climbing around on roofs, figuring out what to do when things don’t fit right,
and that’s just for starters. You need to understand water pressure and how
it can cause pipe weld joints to burst at the worst possible times. You need to
understand what happens in cold weather to water that might freeze in an
exposed pipe. You need to know how to evacuate closed systems of air and
how to burp and drain pipes completely, or else you’ll be sorry.

You need to know how to choose the best kit among a horde of suppliers who
have very poor literature and don’t like to answer the phone very often.
When they finally pick up, they tend to sound like you’re an idiot for asking
perfectly logical questions.
You need to be patient and be able to change horses in midstream. And you
need to realize that after your system is in working order and you’re reaping
the benefits, something may go wrong if you don’t operate it properly.
In other words, installing a solar water heater is a do-it-yourselfer’s dream
come true! Chapter 10 has loads of information to get you started. Enjoy.
Literally Going Green with Landscaping
Who cares about the new trend toward “green consciousness?” We’re talking
a green thumb. Landscaping means you’re completely outdoors, and that
should be enough to convince any green enthusiast. When you’re landscaping,
nothing can really break, and you won’t run into parts that don’t fit. You can
start off small, with maybe just a new tree planted in a strategic location, or
you can rip out any trees, bushes, or plants you don’t like and replace them
with ones that support your solar-power habits. Chapter 8 contains all sorts
of ideas you can implement.
Venting Your Attic and Cooling 
Off the Entire House
A solar attic vent fan project is great because you get to do a little bit of every-
thing (in contrast to the solar water heater project where you get a whole lot of
everything). You can install a solar attic vent fan in a day or so, depending on
how difficult your attic structure is. You get to install a PV panel, which requires
you to figure out orientation and placement. You do some simple wiring without
having to be too fussy about quality. You can use electrical tape and just twist
the wires together, or you can use a soldering iron and get fancy with shrink
tubing. You need to make some drawings of your attic, and really think about
prevailing winds and pressures and how they affect air movement. You need
to figure out the best spot to install the fan, and you need to know a little about
fan technology, but if you don’t, it’s okay because your system will still work
pretty well.
You can’t get shocked, no matter how hard you try — a good thing, although
some of you are surely disappointed by this.

You may fall off your roof, even if you don’t try. I know of at least ten guys who
have fallen off roofs. (I would use the gender-neutral term “people,” but I don’t
know any women who have fallen off a roof.) All the do-it-yourselfers I know
are envious of these guys, and I suspect they secretly wish they could fall off
a roof, too.
Ultimately, a solar attic vent fan works really well. I installed one on my own
roof, and the house was much cooler the very next day. We don’t have to turn
on our air conditioner nearly as much. The problem is, nobody can really see
it, so it’s hard to brag about. For project instructions, turn to Chapter 13.
Sheltering Living Spaces from the Sun
Trellises are good projects because they’re functional as well as nice looking.
You can make them out of wood or synthetic material. You can even get kits
of aluminum parts. Plant some flowering vines around your trellis, and the
results will be fantastic.
Awnings allow you to really shine in the design department. You can sauce up
a plain old window with a good awning, and if you design it right, you can take
advantage of the winter sunshine and then block the summer sun from 
shining in.
Overhangs are really nothing more than glorified awnings. You can really
change the look and functionality of a house with one strategically designed
overhang. You can take a rectangular, boxy house and make it look interesting
and appealing for a very low cost. You don’t need a county building permit or
inspection if you keep your project reasonably modest.
Chapter 8 has more tips for each of these projects.
Warming up the Water with an Off-Grid
Swimming Pool Solar Heater
You can make a solar hot water heater out of landscape tubing, and you can
design it to fit just about anywhere. It’s cheap and just as effective as the col-
lectors that cost $600 apiece.
You can connect a small submersible pump to a PV panel, and if you know a
few rudimentary things about pumps and pressures and flow, you can make
water flow through your homemade collector without having to run it through
341
Chapter 24: Ten or So Best Do-It-Yourself Projects

the pool pump. Solar collectors don’t care how fast the water is running
through them; they’ll put out the same amount of heat with fast or slow flow.
So your small system will heat your pool just as much as if you connected it to
the pool pump, and it won’t load your pump, which makes it cost more to run.
Here’s the thing: You want to run your pool pump as little as possible, but
you want to get the most amount of heat you can from your solar collectors.
So the PV-powered system runs whenever sunshine hits the PV panel. This is
ideal because that’s when the collectors can heat the water.
If you’re on a TOU rate structure, you don’t want to run your electric pool
pump in the afternoon when rates are high. But this is when you need to run
the pump to get heat out of the panels. Your homemade solar pool-heating
system solves this problem nicely. Chapter 11 has solar projects, ranging
from the simple to the more involved, for your pool.
Providing an Endless Source
of Purified Drinking Water
The water purifier project I describe in Chapter 10 is a good project because
it’s relatively easy, foolproof, and cheap. Or as cheap as you want to make it.
You can make a small purifier or a big one with valves and drippers and all
kinds of features. You can purify a gallon of water a day or a thousand, and
the concept is the same. You can use salvaged parts, so if your game is to get
everything for free, here you go.
This project is good if you’ve got a remote cabin (off-grid enthusiasts!) and
have access to a creek that’s of dubious origin (all together now — what do
bears do in the woods?). Or if you just want to purify your local tap water,
you can use this project for that purpose, too.
Now You’re Really Cooking
Solar cooking is fun and interesting; it teaches you about solar radiation and
how it can vary in different weather patterns.
You can build a simple oven, or you can get fancy and make a super-duper
one. You can even design and build an automatic tracker, which follows the
sun over the course of the day automatically, so that you don’t have to do it
manually. You can make an automatic tracker in several different ways, which
all involve interesting physics.
342
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

You can make a solar oven any size you want; Chapter 9 has details for building
a basic one and a sturdier one. I have a small solar oven next to my barbecue,
and I can cook corn on the cob while flipping the ribs. For some reason, the
corn has a unique, very pure flavor.
Charging Your Batteries the Solar Way
This isn’t really a project because you don’t actually build anything. But
using a solar battery charger requires strategy and scheduling, and it gives a
good lesson on solar power and PV panels. This is probably one of the easi-
est ways to start using solar power. Chapter 9 explains what you need to
know about getting the most bang for your solar beam.
Reading Under the Sun at Night
An off-grid reading light is a great project, and you can get as fancy as you
want. Start with a simple, self-contained camping light comprised of a small
PV panel and a little pod containing a rechargeable battery, a light sensor, a
switch, and a few LEDs. Then hang this light over your favorite reading chair
(you may need to monkey around to get the light to shine in just the right spot),
and you can read every night for hours without plugging in to the grid. Get
the lowdown on these lights in Chapter 9.
For those of you who are more ambitious when it comes to electronics, you
can design your own circuit (they can be very easy or very clever and effi-
cient). You can design your own optics, which is a real gas if you know a little
about the subject. You can get cheap optics parts from Edmund Scientific.
Pumping Water to New Heights
Solar fountains have tons of potential for do-it-yourselfers. You can make a
small one or a massive one. You can make them work any number of ways.
You can make one work all night long, if you want.
If your back is strong and your will ironclad, you can use indigenous rocks and
mortar to build a cascading waterfall in your backyard that everybody will
marvel at. You can make one very noisy with water splashing like Niagara Falls,
or you can make a modest, gentle trickle. You can toss some koi into a pond
and create a bio system complete with water plants and nightly raccoon raids.
343
Chapter 24: Ten or So Best Do-It-Yourself Projects

The technology is simple, but you’ll need to do some wiring, and you’ll need
to think about how the system components affect the whole. You need to
know water pressure, flow rates, valves, electrical current, and so on (Chapter
8 can get you started). All in all, you’ll have to contemplate tons of physics,
and that’s half the fun.
Getting Creative with a Solar-Powered
Sprinkler
Of all the great toys and gadgets the world of solar offers, the clear winner for
most fun is the solar-powered sprinkler. Consider this project a bonus, the
11th installment in a list of ten items.
Here’s how it works. You connect the unit (including the sprinkler head and
motion detector) to your garden hose and sprinkler and stake it firmly into
the ground. Then turn the faucet on. When the motion detector senses move-
ment, the sprinkler discharges a blast of water; then it turns off.
The practical use for a solar-powered sprinkler is to keep animals at bay. For
example, you can keep deer from eating all your landscaping, skunks out of
the cat food, or raccoons off the roof. When the motion detector senses their
presences, it sprays, they skedaddle. Chapter 9 offers some other uses.
But you can also have some fun with this device. Install it on a hot summer
afternoon, and the next time the kids run by, they’ll be delighted by the sur-
prise shower. Or place it next to the sidewalk, and when unsuspecting neigh-
bors stroll by on their nightly walk, watch them suddenly pick up the pace to
avoid the sprinkles. Just remember: There’s no harm in an occasional practi-
cal joke, but don’t do it too often. You know what they say about paybacks!

W
hen starting a new hobby (or, maybe in this case, a new lifestyle), it’s
wise to start out simple and work your way up. If you plan on going for
broke and installing a full-scale PV system one day, you should understand
the ins and outs of photovoltaics first, because then you’ll know how to get
the most out of your system. And it’s natural to be skeptical of solar power;
maybe you want to see what it’s all about before you spend a big chunk of your
hard-earned money on a major investment.
Personally, I like small projects. Get in, get out, and move on. That’s what you
find in this chapter. And if you’ve got kids, some of these projects are ideal to
do together because they’re easy and fun. And maybe you can even sneak in
a science lesson or two. (You can find more information on most of these
ideas in Chapter 9.)
Landscape Lighting
This is probably the cheapest way to get started using solar power. You can
install a single light in a strategic location and get a lot of effect. It takes five
minutes and costs less than $10. You won’t get a jolt of electricity, and if the
lights don’t illuminate an area exactly the way you had planned, you can
move them around to your heart’s content.
One of my all-time favorite gizmos is a swimming pool light that changes
colors. It floats on the surface and casts its light down into the pool so the

entire pool changes colors. The lights are fun to swim underneath, and kids
love to play games with them. (A word of caution, though: Kids usually wind
up breaking them.)
The same color-changing scheme is used to good effect in some decorative
yard lights. They add just a hint of mystique to your yard and gently catch
the eye. If you have a big picture window, put one of these outside it.
Portable Showers
Portable showers are kind of silly, I’ll grant that. You fill a big plastic bag with
water and set it in the sun. When the water heats up enough (to 105°F or so),
you hang the bag from a tree, stand underneath it, open a small plastic valve,
and voilà, you have a shower au naturel. Ahhh . . .
You can use one near your swimming pool to rinse the chlorine off after a
swim. You can use them while camping. You can use one for a hot water
bottle big enough to soothe your entire back or stomach.
Sunscreens with Roll-up Mechanisms
A lot of sunlight comes into your non-northern windows over the course of 
a hot day. This has two negative effects. First, the sunlight makes the room
temperature hotter, and second, the bright light makes the room seem hotter
(a psychological effect). It’s a fact that if two rooms are the same exact temper-
ature, but one has a lot of sunlight and the other is dark, people prefer the
darker room.
Solar screens reduce the amount of sunlight coming into a room by up to 90
percent. It costs around $2 per year to cover a typical window, and the effect
is dramatic. You get the most heat reduction in your house when you install
sunscreens on the biggest south-facing windows.
You can tack sunscreens up with ordinary thumbtacks, and they look good
from both inside and out if you take care to cut the screen corners flush with
the window frame. You can make a retractor mechanism for a few dollars. This
device allows you to retract the screen when you don’t want it to cover the
window. (For the same reason a room seems cooler in the summer with a screen,
the room will seem warmer in the winter without the screen.)
346
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Solar Fountains
You can get a good solar fountain for under $100. The water will flow when
the sky is sunny and cut back when it’s cloudy. You’ll be aware of how much
sunshine you are receiving at any given time.
You can build a large solar fountain for a little bit more if you do most of the
labor yourself and use natural landscaping elements, like indigenous rocks.
You can build a really big fountain, and the only cost you’ll incur is for the
solar pump.
You can build a solar fountain with a large upper reservoir so you can even
out the fluctuations in water flow when the sun changes. The reservoir also
allows you to save the water for use later, like when you’re dining nearby.
You can locate a solar fountain anywhere, as long as you put the PV panel in
sunlight.
Sun Tea
Here’s the cheapest project you can possibly do with the sun. Put some tea
bags and water in a big glass jar with a lid, and leave it in the sunshine for a
few hours. By the middle of the afternoon, you’ll have refreshing sun tea. You
don’t need to heat water on the stove or in the microwave, and the tea tastes
wonderful. (Just don’t leave the jar in the sun too long.)
Battery Chargers
If you use a lot of batteries, you can drastically cut back on battery costs by using
rechargeable batteries in conjunction with a solar charger. And I’m not only talk-
ing about the standard household batteries, either. You can get solar chargers
for vehicle batteries, notebook computer batteries, and small appliances.
Using these devices gives you a very good lesson on PV technology because
you’ll need to locate the PV panel in a good, sunny spot to get the most juice
into your battery.

Chapter 25: Ten Cheap Solar Projects and Devices

Solar Cooking
Here’s a fun and potentially productive project that anybody can do. For less
than $50, you can make a good solar oven. You can easily save this much in
power bills over the course of a sunny season, and if you make your oven
with enough quality, you can use it most of the year. Plus, in the summer, you
won’t be heating your house with conventional cooking.
Solar Hat Fans
This is a cheap toy, but a fun one. Give solar hat fans as gifts that people will
remember for their novelty. Kids will have a gas with them. Solar hat fans are
small solar-powered fans that clip onto your hat visor, and they cost only $10
apiece. If you’ve got a business, put your logo on the fans and hand them out
to potential customers. Look up www.realgoods.com for a supply.
Solar Lamps
For around $40, you can get a little light module that you can charge during
sunlight hours and use when it gets dark. They’re similar to solar landscape
lighting and just as effective. You can read with the light or hang one in your
tent for a cool light that you can play cards under for hours.
Solar Flashlights
Are you always getting frustrated when you reach for your flashlight and its
batteries are pooped out again? A solar flashlight is always ready to go when
you need it. Instead of storing it in a drawer, you need to put it on a window
sill, but it’s worth it. Kids love these lights, and they’re much brighter than
you think. They work by using well-designed optics and efficient LEDs.
They’re great for remote cabins, boats, camping, RVs, and so on.

elieve it or not, you can abuse solar power. I don’t mean just by laying
out naked in the sun for hours without sunscreen, but rather by installing
ill-advised projects or not attending to the details as well as you should. For
some of you, this chapter is a reminder of what not to do. For others, it’s a
how-to seminar.
Installing Like Curly, Moe, and Larry
I watched a Three Stooges movie where Curly plugged a leak in a shower by
connecting a pipe to it. Then the other end of the pipe leaked, so he connected
another pipe to that. The other end of that pipe leaked, so he installed another
pipe. Pretty soon, the bathroom was filled with pipes. Moe came in and slapped
Curly and then pulled Larry’s hair and slapped him, too. Curly retaliated by
whacking Moe on the head with a large wrench, and so it went.
If you fail to see the humor in this, you probably should not install a solar water
heater. In fact, anytime you install anything, keep your sense of humor handy.

Opting for a Solar Swimming Pool 
Heater Rather Than a Solar Cover
Wait a minute, you’re thinking. This project was listed in the ten best solar
projects chapter!
Exactly. Solar pool heaters are very expensive, and you don’t get any return on
investment from them. They don’t last that long because sunshine and chlorine
eat them up. They’re hard to maintain because they’re on your roof, and they
leak everywhere when they break (not if they break, when they break).
And you know what? A solar pool cover is about 2 percent of the cost and
works better. Plus, if you’ve got any sort of respect for Mother Nature, you
don’t mind freezing cold water because that’s exactly the way she serves it
up most of the time. So what’s a little cold water? Instead of getting out of bed
in the morning and flipping on your coffee pot, jump into your freezing pool.
You’ll be awake in no time (and think of all the energy you’ll save).
Going Out of Your Mind 
by Going Off-Grid
If you have a choice between going off-grid and installing a PV intertie system,
do not go off-grid. The economics are horrible, in a relative sense. Off-grid
systems use batteries, which are operational and waste nightmares. Plus, you
can’t get a mortgage for an off-grid house.
Nevertheless, a movement is afoot to “go back to Mother Nature” by going
off-grid. This movement would be better titled, “getting away from humanity
while punching Mother Nature in the gut.”
You can save a heckuva lot more pollution by going intertie than off-grid in
many ways. If you want to get away from humanity (I’m empathetic, believe
me), go backpacking and remember to take biodegradable toilet paper. Then
when you get back home, check your intertie PV system to see how much of
a net surplus of energy you generated.

Relying on Solar When You 
Rarely See the Sun
If you’re in a cloudy, rainy, cold climate, and your utility rates are low, don’t
install a PV system, no matter how much you want to jump on the bandwagon.
You can use your money to save the world in many other planet-friendly, more
efficient ways. Install a geothermal system for heating and cooling. Put in a
pellet stove and figure out how to work it perfectly. Give to Greenpeace.
Cheaping Out on Water Heater Systems
If you review the availability of solar water heater systems, you’ll find a large
range of prices and performances, and you’ll discover that some systems don’t
work very well in cold climates. If you’re in a climate where temperatures can
drop below freezing, the pipes or the collector in some solar water heaters can
burst (but the manufacturer will never tell you that).
Now picture this scenario: It took six men to lift the collector onto your roof,
and this was after it took an hour to pull the thing out of its very large, very
expensive packing crate that was delivered via truck because UPS doesn’t
deliver anything that big. So now you need to get six men to lift it back down,
repack it, and send it back to the factory for warranty repairs. The company
fixes it, repacks it, then trucks it back to you (warranty repairs generally
don’t cover shipping costs, so you’ll have to pay those). Then you must find
six men to lift the collector back into place on your roof. But you still have
the same problem: You cheaped out and bought a system not made for your
particular climate.
The point of all this? Be very thorough when researching and selecting a
solar water heater system. It’s the best thing under the sun, but it can be the
worst if you don’t do your homework.
Your Eyes Are Bigger Than Your Stomach
Any solar system that generates more energy than you use is a waste. You save
nothing by using a solar system at less than its capacity. If you install a solar
water heater that’s too big, you’ve wasted money. If you install an intertie
system that’s too big, you get nothing for the excess power that you don’t use.
351
Chapter 26: Ten or So Worst Solar Mistakes

Skipping the Groundwork
Strictly speaking, you don’t have to do an energy audit and take conservation
steps before installing a solar system. But bypassing these processes violates
the spirit of solar philosophy. Actually, I don’t really have to put this item in
this list because you’re already an environmentalist, right?
Going with the Cheapest Bid 
Because It’s the Cheapest
Do I really need to elaborate? In case I do, let me just remind you that you get
what you pay for. Cheap usually means more headaches, shoddy quality, and
more money in the long run. Spend a little more money up front for quality
equipment and better workmanship. In the end, you’ll be glad you did.
Ignoring Murphy’s Law
If you think I’m just joking when I talk about Murphy’s Law, think again. I’ve
been doing projects since I was 5. I’ve done easy ones, I’ve done hard ones.
I’ve been in the linear particle accelerator at Stanford University working on
projects with doctors and engineers who have fancy degrees and thousands of
years’ worth of experience. Nothing ever goes the way it’s supposed to. Never.
Always remember: Measure twice, cut once. Then be prepared for anything,
and always be patient. Every project involves art and science. The science
part is usually obvious, and that’s what attracts most people. The art is in
smiling when things go awry.
