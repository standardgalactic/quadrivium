Introduction
Introduction
Here follows a collection of examples of how one can solve linear diﬀerential equations with polynomial
coeﬃcients by the method of power series. The reader is also referred to Calculus 3b, to Calculus 3c-3,
and to Complex Functions.
It should no longer be necessary rigourously to use the ADIC-model, described in Calculus 1c and
Calculus 2c, because we now assume that the reader can do this himself.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

Solution of diﬀerential equations by the power series method
Example 1.1 1) Find the radius of convergence ϱ for the power series
(1)
∞

p=1
p · x2p−1.
2) Find the sum function f(x) for (1), when x ∈] −ϱ, ϱ[, e.g. by termwise integration of (1).
3) Prove that if y = ∞
n=0 anxn is a power series solution of the diﬀerential equation
(2) (x2 −1) d2y
dx2 + 6x dy
dx + 4y = 0,
then we have the recursion formula
an+2 = n + 4
n + 2 an,
n ∈N0.
4) Find the solution y = ϕ(x), x ∈I, of (2), for which ϕ(0) = 1 and ϕ′(0) = 0.
1) We get by the criterion of roots x ̸= 0 that
p
|ap(x)| =
p√p · x2 ·
1
p
|x|
→x2
for p →∞.
From the condition of convergence x2 < 1 follows that ϱ = 1.
2) If we put
f(x) =
∞

p=1
px2p−1,
for |x| < 1,
then
F(x) =

hence by diﬀerentiation,
f(x) = F ′(x) = 1

(1 −x2)2 =

for |x| < 1.

(n + 1) {(n + 4)an −(n + 2)an+2} xn.
It follows from the identity theorem that
(n + 1){(n + 4)an −(n + 2)an+2} = 0
for n ∈N0,
thus for every n in the summation domain. Since n + 1 ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, we get
(n + 4)an = (n + 2)an+2
for n ∈N0,

which is fulﬁlled if and only if just one of the following two formulæ is satisﬁed
an+2 = n + 4
n + 2 an,
or
an+2
n + 4 =
an
n + 2,
for n ∈N0.
Remark 1.1 In the text, only the former one is required. Note that the latter one is easier to
treat. In fact, if we put bn =
an
n + 2, then it is written
bn+2 = bn,
n ∈N0,
where bn =
an
n + 2.
♦
4) If ϕ(0) = 1 and ϕ′(0) = 0, then a0 = 1 and a1 = 0, hence b0 = 1
2 and b1 = 0. It follows from
the recursion formula for bn that b2n+1 = 0, and thus a2n+1 = 0 for every n ∈N0. Furthermore,
b2n = b2n−2 = · · · = b0 = 1
2, hence
a2n = (2n + 2)b2n = n + 1,
for n ∈N0.
If x ̸= 0, then we get by (1) that the power series solution (where ϱ = 1) is given by
ϕ(x) =

By insertion into the diﬀerential equation we see that this is a solution
ϕ(x) =
1
(1 −x2)2
for x ∈] −1, 1[.
Remark 1.2 It is often worth the trouble to inspect the equation instead of immediately to start on
the method of inserting a power series into the diﬀerential equation. In the present case we e.g. get
by using the rules of diﬀerentiation for |x| < 1 that
0

thus

Putting c = 3c2 we get by another integration,
(x2 −1)2y = c1 + c

and the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation becomes
y =
c1
(x2 −1)2 + c2 · x3 −3x
(x2 −1)2 ,
|x| < 1,
c1, c2 ∈R arbitrære.
Since
dy
dx = c1 · x · {· · · } + c2 ·
 3x2 −3
(x2 −1)2 + x(· · · )

,
we get
y(0) = c1 = 1
and
y′(0) = −3c2 = 0,
hence c1 = 0 and c2 = 0, and the speciﬁc solution is
ϕ(x) =
1
(1 −x2)2
for x ∈] −1, 1[.
Example 1.2 Prove that the diﬀerential equation
x d2y
dx2 + (3 −2x2)dy
dx −4xy = 0,
x ∈R,
has a simple inﬁnity of solutions which can be written as power series from x = 0, i.e. on the form
y =


n=0
anxn,
x ∈] −ϱ, ϱ[,
where a0 ∈R is an arbitrary constant.
Find the radius of convergence ϱ and the sum function f(x) for a0 = 1.
1) The equation is linear of second order with polynomial coeﬃcients. The coeﬃcient x of d2y
dx2 is only
0 for x = 0, so the formal power series solutions either have radius of convergence ϱ = 0 or ϱ = ∞.

get by collecting the two series,
0 = 2a1 +
∞

n=2
n{(n + 2)an −2an−2}xn−1.
3) It follows from the identity theorem that every coeﬃcient is 0, hence
2a1 = 0,
og
n{(n + 2)an −2an−2} = 0
for n ≥2,
because the summation domain is given by n ≥2.
Since n ̸= 0 for n ≥2, this is reduced to a1 = 0, and to the recursion formula
(3) (n + 2)an = 2an−2
eller
an =
2
n + 2 an−2
for n ≥2.
4) Solution of the recursion formula.
Since we have a leap of 2 in the indices of (3), we have to consider separately the two cases, where
n is odd or even.
a) It follows from a1 = 0 and (3) that a3 = 0, a5 = 0, . . . , hence by induction, a2n+1 = 0 for every
odd index 2n + 1, n ∈N0.
b) For even indices we start by replacing n by 2n in (3), thus
a2n =
2
2n + 2 a2n−2 =
1
n + 1 a2(n−1),
n ∈N.
We deﬁne the auxiliary sequence bn = a2n and then get the two variants of the recursion
formula (3),
(4) bn =
1
n + 1 bn−1
or
(n + 1)bn = bn−1,
n ∈N.
Here we have three methods of solution:

Calculus 3c-4
 
11 
 
i) Induction. Since b0 is “free”, the ﬁrst coeﬃcients are
b1 = 1
2b0,
b2 = 1
3b1 =
1
3 · 2b0,
b3 = 1
4b2 =
1
4 · 3 · 2b0.
Set up the hypothesis
bn =
1
(n + 1)! b0,
n ∈N,
(rigtig for n = 1, 2, 3).
It follows from the recursion formula that the successor becomes
bn+1 =
1
(n + 1) + 1 b(n+1)−1 =
1
n + 2 bn =
1
(n + 2)! bn,
which is the same as the hypothesis only with n replaced by n + 1. Then the hypothesis
follows by induction.
ii) Recursion. By iteration of the recursion formula we get (note that the diﬀerence between
the denominator and the index is constantly equal to 2),
bn
=
1
n + 1 bn−1 =
1
n + 1 · 1
n bn−2 = · · ·
=
1
n + 1 · 1
n · · · 1
2 b0 =
1
(n + 1)! b0.
iii) Multiplication by n! ̸= 0 (an integrating factor) gives
(n + 1)!bn = n!bn−1 = · · · = 1!b0, dvs. bn =
1
(n + 1)!b0.

5) Insertion into to formal power series. We get in all three cases that
a2n+1 = 0
and
a2n = bn =

6) Radius of convergence. If we put bn(x) = |a0| ·
1
(n + 1)! x2n ≥0, we get for a0 ̸= 0 and x ̸= 0
that bn(x) > 0, hence
bn+1(x)
bn(x)
= |a0|x2(n+1)
(n + 2)!
· (n + 1)!
|a0|x2n =
x2
n + 2 →0 < 1
for n →∞. It follows from the criterion of quotients that the series is convergent for every
x ∈R, thus ϱ = ∞, and the interval of convergence is R.
7) Sum function. The coeﬃcient
1
(n + 1)! indicates that we should think of an exponential function.
When a0 = 1 and x ̸= 0 we get by the change of indices n →n −1 that
y =

(n + 1)!x2n =

n!x2(n−1) = 1

A comparison with the exponential series

Example 1.3 1) Prove that the diﬀerential equation

dx + (3 −x4)y = 0,
x ∈R,
has precisely one power series solution y = ∞

,
and ﬁnd this solution.
Find the interval of convergence and sum function of the series.
2) Find another solution on R of (5), which is linearly independent of the ﬁrst one, and which at
(x0, y0) = (0, 0) fulﬁls (y′
0, y′′
0, y′′′
0 ) = (1, 0, 0).
3) Find the complete solution of (5) on R+.
The problem is strictly speaking over-determined, because the singularity at x = 0, where the coeﬃ-
cient of y′′ is 0 also creates some conditions.

into the diﬀerential equation we get by adding some convenient zero terms that

(removal of terms and collecting the series).
Hence it follows form the identity theorem that we have for the removed terms (the ﬁrst ﬁnite
sum),
n = 0 :
3a0 = 0,
i.e. a0 = 0,
n = 1 :
0 = 0,
i.e. a1 arbitrary,
n = 2 :
−a2 = 0,
i.e. a2 = 0,
n = 3 :
0 = 0,
i.e. a3 arbitrary,
and the recursion formula for n ≥4 (from the inﬁnite series)
(n −1)(n −3)an = an−4,
for n ≥4.
It follows in particular, since a0 = a2 = 0, and since there is a leap of 4 in the indices, by induction
that a2n = 0 for every n ∈N0.
For odd indices n = 2m + 1 the recursion formula is written
2m · 2(m −1)a2m+1 = a2m−3 = a2(m−2)+1,
m ≥2.
If we put bm = a2m+1, then
22m(m −1)bm = bm−2,
m ≥2,
hence by a multiplication by 2m−2(m −2)! ̸= 0 for m ≥2,
(6) 2mm!bm = 2m−2(m −2)!bm−2,
m ≥2.

If we put
cm = 2mm!bm = 2mm!a2m+1,
then cm = cm−2 by (6), thus c2p+1 = · · · = c1 and c2p = · · · = c0, hence
c2p+1 = 22p+1(2p + 1! a4p+3 = c1 = 2 · 1! a3 = 2a3,

It follows from the identity theorem for n ∈N0 (the summation domain) that

n ∈N0.
Since n + 2 ̸= 0 for every n ∈N0, this equation is reduced to the recursion formula,
(n + 1)an+2 + (n + 3)an = 0,
for n ∈N0.

Since also n + 1 ̸= 0 and n + 3 ̸= 0, this can more conveniently be written

It follows from the line element that a0 = 1 and a1 = 0, hence the recursion formula gives by induction

By insertion into the diﬀerential equation it is easily seen that this is in fact the complete solution in
all of R.
Remark 1.4 This example is an excellent illustration of the limitations of the power series method:
We only obtain the solution in the interval of convergence ] −1, 1[, and we have to insert into the
diﬀerential equation that the solution is valid in all of R.
The reason of this strange phenomenon can be found in the concept of a “singular point of the
diﬀerential equation”. By this we understand a zero of the coeﬃcient of the highest order term d2y
dx2 ,
here 1 + x2. The singular points are here complex, ±i, and they cannot be seen in the real analysis.
They nevertheless inﬂuence the radius of convergence, because the numerical values of all (complex)
singular points are the candidates of the radius of convergence. Here | ± i| = 1, in accordance with
ϱ = 1.

We get from the identity theorem for n ∈N0 (the summation domain) that
(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 −(n2 −64)an = 0
for n ∈N0.
Since (n + 2)(n + 1) ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, this can be rewritten as
an+2 =
n2 −64
(n + 1)(n + 2) an = (n + 8)(n −8)
(n + 1)(n + 2) an,
n ∈N0.
2) If ϕ(0) = 1 and ϕ′(0) = 0, then a0 = 1 and a1 = 0. The leap of the recursion formula is 2, so it
follows by induction that a2n+1 = 0 for n ∈N0.

For even indices we rewrite the recursion formula (n →2n)

For n = 4 we get a10 = 0, and then it follows from the recursion formula that a2n = 0 for n ≥5.
Hence
ϕ(x) = a8x8 + a6x6 + a4x4 + a2x2 + a0.

thus
ϕ(x)
=
128x8 −256x6 + 160x4 −32x2 + 1
=
32(x2 −1)(2x2 −1)2x2 + 1.
b) Alternatively we have found the structure
ϕ(x) = a8x8 + a6x6 + a4x4 + a2x2 + 1,
a0 = 1,
so
ϕ′(x) = 8a8x7 + 6a6x5 + 4a4x3 + 2a2x,
ϕ′′(x) = 56a8x6 + 30a6x4 + 12a4x2 + 2a2,
hence by insertion,
0
=
(1 −x2)ϕ′′(x) −xϕ′(x) + 64ϕ(x)
=
64 + 64a2x2 + 64a4x4 + 64a6x6 + 64a8x8
−2a2x2 −4a4x4 −6a6x6 −8x8
−2a2x2 −12a4x4 −30a6x6 −56a8x8
+2a2 + 12a4x2 + 30a6x4 + 56a8x6
=
(64+2a2)+(60a2+12a4)x2+(48a4+30a6)x4+(28a6+56a8)x6.
Since the coeﬃcients of this equation are 0, we must have
a2 = −32,
a4 = −60
12 · a2 = 160,
a6 = −48
30 · a4 = −256,
a8 = −1
2 a6 = 128,
hence by insertion,
ϕ(x) = 128x8 −256x6 + 160x4 −32x2 + 1.
Example 1.8 Find, expressed by means of a power series, a solution through the line element (0, 0, 1)
of the diﬀerential equation
x d2y
dx2 + x dy
dx + y = 0.
Find the radius of convergence and sum function of the series.
1) The coeﬃcient x of the highest order term d2y
dx2 is only 0 for x = 0 in the complex plane. Hence,
any formal power series solution of the diﬀerential equation can only have its radius of convergence
ϱ ∈{0, ∞}. We shall hope for ϱ = ∞.
2) Insert the formal series into the diﬀerential equation. Thus we assume that we have the

3) Identity theorem. We have here a power series for 0. This power series is unique with all its
coeﬃcients equal to 0. Hence, every index which is included in the summation must be zero, hence
for n ∈N0. We thus obtain the recursion formula
0 = (n + 1)nan+1 + (n + 1)an = (n + 1){nan+1 + an}
for n ∈N0.
Since n + 1 ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, we can remove this factor, so we get the simpler recursion formula
(9) nan+1 + an = 0
for n ∈N0.
Remark 1.5 If a common factor of a recursion formula has zeros in the domain of validity, then
these zeros must be excepted in the further investigator, before we can remove the factor. There
is no problem here, because n + 1 ̸= 0. ♦
4) Solution of the recursion formula (9).
a) Standard method. Express an+1 by an. (Warning: One must never divide by 0.) Calculate
the ﬁrst coeﬃcients. Set up an hypothesis of induction and prove it by induction (the bootstrap
principle).
i) If n = 0, then 0 · a1 + a0 = a0 = 0 (in agreement with the line element).
Then we get by the line element that a1 = f ′(0) = 1.
If n ≥1, then (9) is rewritten as
(10) an+1 = −1
n an
for n ∈N.
ii) Since a1 = 1, it follows from (10) that
a2 = −1
1 a1 = −1,
n = 1,
a3 = −1
2 a2 = +1

n = 2,

Based on these values, we set up the hypothesis
(11) an = (−1)n−1 ·
1
(n −1)!,
n ∈N.
Check: It is true for n = 1, 2, 3, 4.
iii) Induction. Assume that the hypothesis is true for some n ∈N. Then by the recursion
formula (10) the successor is
an+1 = −1
n an = (−1)(n+1)−1 ·
1
((n + 1) −1)!,
which is precisely the hypothesis where n has been replaced by n + 1.
It follows by the bootstrap principle that (11) holds for every n ∈N.
b) Recursion We get as in (a) that a0 = 0 and a1 = 1, and (10), hence
an+1 = −1
n an,
n ∈N.
If we replace n by n −1, we get
an = −

n ≥2,

n ∈N0.
We get by the change of index n →n −1,
an = (−1)n−1 ·

(n −1)!,
n ∈N.
c) Integrating factor. Write (9) as
nan+1 = −an
for n ∈N and a0 = 0, a1 = 1.
Multiply this equation by (−1)n(n −1)! ̸= 0 for n ∈N,
(−1)nn!an+1 = (−1)n−1(n −1)!an
for n ∈N.
If we put bn+1 = (−1)nn!an+1, then
bn+1 = bn = · · · = b1 = (−1)00!a1 = 1,
hence
bn = (−1)n−1(n −1)!an = 1, dvs. an = (−1)n−1
(n −1)! , n ∈N.

We get in all three cases that

6) Determination of the radius of convergence! (The task is without any signiﬁcance without
this step).

It follows from the criterion of quotients that the formal series is convergent for every x ∈R,
so ϱ = ∞, and the formal solution is indeed a solution!
b) We know that ϱ = limn→∞

Summing up we get the solution via the power series method,
y = xe−x
for x ∈R.
Alternative solution method.
The power series method is rather cumbersome.

Example 1.9 Given the diﬀerential equation
(12) x d2y
dx2 −(x + 2) dy
dx + 2y = 0.
1) Find a power series solution ϕ1(x) of (12), for which
ϕ1(0) = ϕ′
1(0) = ϕ′′
1(0) = ϕ′′′
1 (0) = 1.
Find the radius of convergence and the sum function of the series.

ϕ′′′
2 (0) = 0.
Find the radius of convergence and the sum function of this series-
3) Find for each of the intervals ] −∞, 0[ and ]0, ∞[ the complete solution of (12).
We see that both (1) and (2) are over-determined problems, because we in both cases have four
equations in two unknowns.

Identity theorem. This gives for n ∈N0 (the summation domain)

for n ≥0,
hence by a multiplication by n! ̸= 0,
(13) (n −2) {(n + 1)!an+1 −n!an} = 0,
for n ≥0,
which can also be applied in (2).

If n = 2, the (13) trivially, no matter the values of a2 and a3.
If n ̸= 2, the recursion formula is reduced to
(14) (n + 1)! an+1 = n! an
for n = 0, 1 og n ≥3.
It follows from ϕ1(0) = ϕ′′′
1 (0) = 1 that a0 = 1 and 3! a3 = 1, hence a3 = 1
6. Notice that
ϕ′
1(0) = 1! a1 = 0! a0 = 1
og
ϕ′′
1(0) = 2! a2 = 0! a0 = 1,
thus the conditions ϕ′
1(0) = ϕ′′
1(0) = 1 are automatically satisﬁed. They should not have been
assumed, because they can be derived.
Since
(n + 1)! an+1 = n! an = · · · = 3! a3 = 1
for n ≥3,
we have an = 1
n! (also for n = 2, 1, 0), so
y =

2) If ϕ′′′
1 (0) = 3! a3 = 0, then an = 0 for n ≥3 by (13), and
ϕ2(x) = 2 + 1
1! x + 2
2! x2 = x2 + 2x + 2,
because ϕ2(0) = 2.
In particular, ϕ′
2(0) = ϕ′′
2(0) = 2, so these conditions are automatically
fulﬁlled, i.e. they are superﬂuous.
3) The complete solution for x ̸= 0 is then by the existence and uniqueness theorem given by
y = c1ϕ1(x) + c2ϕ2(x) = c1ex + c2(x2 + 2x + 2),
where c1, c2 ∈R are arbitrary constants.
We have some additional variants of solution, in which one does not apply the power series method.

hence by another integration

x2e−x dx = c1 + c2e−x(x2 + 2x + 2).
The complete solution for x ̸= 0 is
y = c1ex + c2(x2 + 2x + 2).
Second alternative. By inspection of the equation we see that the sum of the coeﬃcients is 0,
x −(x + 2) + 2 = 0.
Now d2y

3) An application of the identity theorem gives the recursion formula
(n + 1){nan+1 −(n + 1)an} = 0
for n ∈N0,
where N0 is the summation domain. Now, n + 1 ̸= 0 for every n ∈N0, so this can be reduced to
(17) nan+1 = (n + 1)an,
for n ≥0.
4) The line element (0, 0, 1) implies that
y(0) = a0 = 0,
og
y′(0) = 1! a1 = 1,
hence a1 = 1.
Notice that if we put n = 0 into (17), we also get a0 = 0, so the setup is strictly speaking
over-determined.
5) The recursion formula (17) has now been reduced to
nan+1 = (n + 1)an
or
an+1 = n + 1
n
an
for n ≥1,
because a0 = 0 and a1 = 1.
Solution of the recursion formula.
a) Induction. It follows from a1 = 1 that
a2 = 2
1 · a1 = 2,
a3 = 3
2 · a2 = 3.

Induction hypothesis:
an = n
for n ∈N,
(rigtig for n = 1, 2, 3)
Assume that the hypothesis is true for some n ∈N. Then we get for the successor that
an+1 = n + 1
n
· an = n + 1
n
· n = n + 1,
which has the same structure as the hypothesis, only with n replaced by n + 1.
The hypothesis then follows by induction. (The bootstrap principle).
b) Recursion. From a1 = 1 and an =
n
n −1 an−1 for n ≥2 it follows recursively that
an =
n
n −1 an−1 =
n
n −1
n −1
n −2 an−2

= · · · =
n
n −1
n −1
n −2 · · · 2
1 a1 = n.
Since also a1 = 1, we have in general an = n for n ∈N.
c) The divine inspiration. If we divide the recursion formula by (n + 1)n ̸= 0, then
an+1
n + 1 = an
n ,
n ∈N.
By putting bn = an
n , this is also written
bn+1 = bn = · · · = b1 = a1
1 = 1,
dvs. bn = an
n = 1,
hence
an = n
for n ∈N.
6) The formal power series solution is
y =
∞

n=1
nxn.
The radius of convergence may e.g. be found by the criterion of roots. In fact, put cn(x) =
n|x|n ≥0. Then
n
cn(x) =
n√n · |x| →1 · |x|
for n →∞.
The condition of convergence is that |x| < 1 = ϱ, hence the radius of convergence is ϱ = 1, and
the series is convergent for x ∈] −1, 1[.
Once the interval of convergence has been found, we know that we have found a true power series

for 0 < |x| < 1 with arbitrary constants c1 and c2 ∈R.
9) Extension to x = 0.
(This is here fairly diﬃcult.)
Due to the laws of magnitude we have
x · ln |x| →0 for x →0. Hence, y2(x) can be extended continuously to x = 0 by taking the limit,
lim
x→0 (−y2(x)) = lim
x→0
x ln |x| + 1
(1 −x)2

(1 −0)2 = 1,
hence we have the continuous extension
−y2(x) =

⎨
⎩

for x ̸= 0,

for x = 0.
We note here that −y2(x) is not continuously diﬀerentiable at x = 0. We have e.g.
d
dx(x ln |x|) = 1 + ln |x| →−∞
for x →0,
and y2(x) does not belong to the class C2 i x = 0.
It is possible to interpret the solution, if we use the concept of weak diﬀerentiation.
10) Alternative solution for 0 < |x| < 1 without using series. This variant is very hard, so it is
only given here without comments. It shall only illustrate that it is also a possible method in this
case. We rewrite the equation in the following way:

It follows from the identity theorem that if n ∈N0 (the summation domain), then
(n + 2){(n + 1)an+2 −(n −1)an} = 0
for n ∈N0.
Now, n + 2 ̸= 0 for every n ∈N0, so this can also be written
(n + 1)an+2 = (n −1)an
for n ∈N0.
There is a leap of 2 in the indices, and for n = 1,
2 · a3 = 0 · a1 = 0,
hence by induction, a2n+1 = 0 for n ≥1, while a1 is arbitrary.
In particular, y = x is a solution which can also be seen immediately.
We get for even indices
(2n−1)a2n =· · ·=(0−1) · a0 =−a0, dvs. a2n = −

2n −1 a0.

This is a linear diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order in u = dz

for |x| < 1.
Here we have allowed x = 0, because it is seen that the solution can be extended continuously to this
value.
Example 1.13 1) Prove that every power series solution of the diﬀerential equation
(x −x2)d2y
dx2 −dy
dx + 2y = 0,
is of the simple form ϕ(x) = kx2, where k is an arbitrary constant.
2) Then ﬁnd a power series solution ϕ(x) with ϕ′′(0) = 0 of the diﬀerential equation

dx + 2y = 3x2,
and ﬁnd the radius of convergence and sum function of this power series solution.

The right hand side of the diﬀerential equation is 0, and n + 1 ̸= 0 for every n ∈N0 (summation
domain), hence we get by the identity theorem that
(n −1)an+1 = (n −2)an,
for n ∈N0.
If n = 2, then a3 = 0, hence an = 0 for every n ≥3.
If n = 1, then a1 = 0, hence a0 = 0.
Summing up we get that y = a2x2 are the only power series solutions of the homogeneous equation.

2) Since the left hand side of the inhomogeneous equation already has been calculated above as a
series, we immediately get


n=0
(n + 1){(n −1)an+1 −(n −2)an}xn.
Since n + 1 ̸= 0, we get by the identity theorem for n = 2 that
3=(2+1){(2−1)a2+1−(2−2)a2}=3a3, thus a3 = 1,
and
(n −1)an+1 = (n −2)an
for n ∈N0 \ {2}.
We get from ϕ′′(0) = 0 that a2 = 0. If n = 1 then 0 = −a1, so a1 = 0.
If n = 0, then −a1 = 0 = −2a0, hence a0 = 0.
If n ≥3, then
(n−1)an+1 =(n−2)a2 =· · ·=(3−2)a3 =1, dvs. an =

so the formal series are

y′ =


n=2
nanxn−1,
y′′ =
∞

n=2
n(n −1)anxn−2,
with the same lower bound n = 2.
2) The coeﬃcient of the term of highest order is x + x2 = x(x + 1) = 0 for x = 0 and x = −1 (the
singular points). Hence, the radius of convergence satisﬁes ϱ ∈{0, 1, ∞}.
3) By insertion of the series into the diﬀerential equation we obtain by reading from the right towards
the left,
2x

n=2
(n+1){(n−1)an+nan+1}xn.
4) Then it follows from the identity theorem,
2a2 = 2,
thus
a2 = 1,
and the recursion formula [NB: The factor n + 1 > 0 can be removed]
(n −1)an + nan+1 = 0
for n ≥2,
i.e. when n goes through the summation domain.
5) Solution of the recursion formula. We write this formula in one of the following ways
an+1 = −n−1
n
an,
n ≥2, eller nan+1 = −(n−1)an,
n ≥2.
a) Induction. Since a2 = 1, we get
a3 = −2−1

a2 = −1

n = 2,
a4 = −3−1

n = 4.
A reasonable induction hypothesis is
(18) an = (−1)n
n −1
for n ≥2.

Calculus 3c-4
 
50 
 
At least this is fulﬁlled for n = 2, 3, 4. Assume that (18) holds for some n ≥2. Then we get
for the successor an+1 by using the recursion formula,
an+1 = −n −1
n
· (−1)n
n −1 = (−1)n+1
n
=
(−1)n+1
{n + 1} −1,
which has the same structure as (18), only with n replaced by n+1. We conclude by induction
(the bootstrap principle) that (18) holds in general.
b) Recursion. When we repeat the recursion formula downwards, we get instead
an+1
=
−n −1
n
an =
	
−n −1

(n−1 factors)
=
(−1)n−1 · 1
n,
hence by the change of index, n + 1 →n,
an = (−1)n
n −1
for n ≥2.
c) Inspection. If we put bn = (n −1)an, then
bn = −bn−1 = (−1)2bn−2 = · · · = (−1)n−2bn−(n−2) = (−1)nb2,
so
bn = (n −1)an = (−1)nb2 = (−1)n(2 −1)a2 = (−1)n,
and
an = (−1)n
n −1
for n ≥2.
We obtain by all three methods
a0 = a1 = 0
and
an = (−1)n
n −1
for n ≥2.
6) The formal series is

Here we recognize the logarithmic series with ϱ = 1, and the sum of the series is for |x| < 1,
y = x ln(1 + x),
x ∈]−1, 1[.

equation, and the the equation can be solved by some known solution formula.

If y(0) = 0, then a0 = 0, so a2n = 0 by induction.
If a1 = y′(0) = k, then
a2n+1 = 2
2n a2n−1 = 1
n a2n−1.
If we multiply by n! ̸= 0, then we get by recursion,
n!a2n+1 = (n −1)!a2(n−1)+1 = · · · = 1!a1 = k,
hence

When we multiply by (2n)!

(2n)!
4nn! a2n = (2(n−1))!
4n−1(n−1)! a2(n−1) = · · · =

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

ϕ(0) = a0 = 0,
ϕ′(0) = 1 · a1 = 0,
ϕ′′(0) = 2a2 = 2.
Then we must have
a0 = 0,
a1 = 0

a2 = 1.
By these assumptions the expression of (1) is reduced to

n=3
n{(n −2)an −2an−2}xn−1.
It follows from the identity theorem that we get the recursion formula
n{(n −2)an −2an−2} = 0,
for n ≥3.
Since n ̸= 0, this equation is reduced to
(n −2)an = 2an−2
for n ≥3.
There is a leap of 2 in the indices, so we must consider the cases of n odd or even separately.
a) If n = 2p + 1 is odd, then the recursion formula becomes
(2p −1)a2p+1 = 2a2p−1,
p ≥1.
Now a1 = 0, so a3 = 0, etc., and it follows by induction that all a2p+1 = 0.
b) If n = 2p (≥3), hence p ≥2, we get instead
(2p −2)a2p = 2a2p−2,
p ≥2,
which is reduced to
(p −1)a2p = a2(p−1),
p ≥2.
Here there are more possible solutions:
i) The elegant one. Multiply by (p −2)! ̸= 0. It follows immediately that
(p −1)!a2p = (p −2)!a2(p−1) = · · · = 1!a2 = 1,
hence
a2p =
1
(p −1)!
for p ≥2 (even for p ≥1).
ii) Recursion. By iteration of
a2p =
1
p −1 a2(p−1),
p ≥2,
(notice how p −1 occurs on the right hand side) we get
a2p =
1
p −1 ·

p −2 · · · 1

(p −1)!,
p ≥2, (p ≥1).

p = 2 :
a4 = 1;

3 −1 a4 = 1
2,
p = 4 :
a8 =

4 −1 a6 =

Then we set up the hypothesis
a2p =
1
(p −1)!
(True for p = 1, 2, 3, 4).
By the recursion formula (p →p + 1),
a2(p+1) = 1
p a2p = 1
p ·
1
(p −1)! = 1
p!,
and the hypothesis follows in general by induction.
Summing up we have proved that we necessarily must have that
a0 = 0,
a2n−1 = 0,
a2n =
1
(n −1)!
for n ∈N.

It remains to be proved that the radius of convergence is ϱ > 0. This can either be done by
comparing with a standard series of known radius of convergence ϱ > 0 (this is here suﬃcient; we
shall, however, postpone this method to (3)) or by a direct proof. (This is actually superﬂuous
here, if we start with (3), though we shall nevertheless go through the argument here.)
Let bn(x) =

Addition. This equation can also be solved alternatively by “a dirty trick”. Since diﬀerentiation
lowers the degree by 1, and multiplication by x increases the degree by 1, we get for the general term
of the series,
xd2y
dx2
has degree n −2 + 1 = n −1,
2x2 dy
dx
has degree n −1 + 2 = n + 1,
dy
dx
has degree n −1 = n −1,
4xy
has degree n + 1 = n + 1.
We see that only the degrees n + 1 and n −1 with the leap of 2 occur, so the possible power series
solutions must necessarily have the structure
y = c1f(x2) + c2xg(x2) = ϕ(x),
where f and g are functions of t = x2.

We have ϕ(0) = 0, ϕ′(0) = 0 and ϕ′′(0) = 2, so we guess on a solution of the form
y = ϕ(x) = f(x2)
which is even.
For x ̸= 0 we apply the change of variable t = x2, (monotonous in each of the intervals x < 0 and
x > 0), hence

only integrate the corresponding series term by term (a transcendental function).

2) Prove by using the result of (1) that (23) has a solution y = ϕ(x) of the form (24), which satisﬁes
the conditions ϕ(0) = 1, ϕ′(0) = 0, ϕ′′′(0) = 0, and that this solution is given by

2) It follows by the identity theorem from the structure of (1) that
a1 = 0,
2a2 + a0 = 0,
a1 = 0,
n(n −3)an −an−2 = 0 for n ≥4.
Then by the initial conditions,
ϕ(0) = a0 = 1,
ϕ′(0) = a1 = 0,
ϕ′′′(0) = 3 · 2 · 1 · a3 = 0,
hence, summing up,

and the recursion formula
n(n −3)an = an−2
for n ≥4.
In particular, a4p−1 = 0 for p ∈N.
By choosing n = 2p even the recursion formula is reduced to
2p(2p −3)a2p = a2(p−1)
for p ≥2
(even for p ≥1).
When a0 = 1 and a2 = a2·1 = −1

Obviously, a0 = 1 and a1 = −2 −1

−2p −1
(2p)!

2(p −1)! = a2(p−1),

and the recursion formula holds.
Then it follows from the recursion formula,
ϱ2 = lim
p→∞
a2(p−1)
a2p

p→∞2p(2p −3) = ∞,
so the radius of convergence is ϱ = ∞.

Example 2.6 Given the diﬀerential equation
(25) (2x2 + 1)d2y

3) Find the sum function of the power series of (2).
4) Find a solution of (25) through the line element (0, 0, 2).
The example can be treated in several ways. The main variant is of course the power series method.


n=0
(n + 2)(n + 1){2an + an+2}xn.
Since (n + 2)(n + 1) ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, it follows from the identity theorem that we have the
recursion formula
an+2 + 2an = 0
for n ∈N0.

2) Then we get from ϕ(0) = 0 that a0 = 0, and from ϕ′(0) = 1 that a1 = 1.
The recursion formula has a leap of 2 in the indices, so we conclude by induction that a2n = 0 for
every n ∈N0.
For n = 2p + 1, p ∈N0, odd the recursion formula becomes
a2(p+1)+1 = −2a2p+1.
The ﬁrst terms are
a1 = 1,
a3 = −2,
a5 = (−2)2,
so we set up the hypothesis a2p+1 = (−2)p.
Assume this hypothesis. Then by the recursion formula,
a2(p+1)+1 = −2a2p+1 = −2 · (−2)p = (−2)p+1,
which is the hypothesis with p replaced by p + 1. Then the hypothesis follows by induction, i.e.
the bootstrap method.

Alternatively it follows by recursion that
a2p+1 = −2a2(p−1)+1 = (−2)2a2(p−2)+1 = · · · = (−2)pa1 = (−2)p.

This is a quotient series of quotient q = −2x2, so the condition of convergence is | −2x2| < 1,
i.e. |x| <
1
√
2, and we get ϱ =
1
√
2.
3) The quotient is q = −2x2, hence the sum function is in ]−ϱ, ϱ[ given by
ϕ(x) = x
∞

p=0
qp =

1 −q =
x
1 + 2x2 ,
for |x| <

√
2.
4) The solution through the line element (0, 0, 2) satisﬁes ψ(0) = 0 and ψ′(0) = 2 = 2 · ϕ′(0). The
equation is linear, and since ψ(0) = 2 · ϕ(0), the solution is
ψ(x) = 2ϕ(x) =
2x
1 + 2x2 ,
|x| <
1
√
2.
Remark 2.3 We have so far only found the solution ϕ(x) =
x
1 + 2x2 in the interval |x| <
1
√
2. It is,
however, immediately seen that the function is deﬁned for every x ∈R. By a simple test it is also a
solution for x ∈R. We ﬁrst calculate
ϕ′(x) =
1
1 + 2x2 −4x2 + (2 −2)
(1 + 2x2)2
=
1
1 + 2x2 −
2
1 + 2x2 +
2
(1 + 2x2)2 = −
1
1 + 2x2 +
2
(1 + 2x2)2
and
ϕ′′(x) =
4x
(1 + 2x2)2 −
16x
(1 + 2x2)3 .
We get by insertion
(2x2 + 1)ϕ′′(x) + 8xϕ′(x) + 4ϕ(x) =
4x
1 + 2x2 −
16x
(1 + 2x2)2 −
8x
1 + 2x2 +
16x
(1 + 2x2)2 +
4x
1 + 2x2 = 0.
It follows from the test that ϕ(x) =
x
1 + 2x2 is a solution of (25) in R.
Here we have produced the full argument. One can, however, obtain this result without any calculation
at all. In fact, according to the previously shown results ϕ fulﬁls the diﬀerential equation in the interval
|x| <
1
√
2. Then note that since ϕ(x) is a rational fractional function, deﬁned in R, the same is true
for ϕ′(x) and ϕ′′(x). When these fractional functions are inserted into (25), these inserted functions
“cannot distinguish between if we are inside or outside the interval |x| <
1
√
2”. Since the equation is
satisﬁed inside the interval, it must also be fulﬁlled outside the interval, and we conclude that ϕ(x) is
a solution in R.

Remark 2.4 Again we can solve the equation directly by an inspection. In fact, we get by a small
reformulation of (25)

and the complete solution is
y = c1 ·

2x2 + 1 + c2 ·

2x2 + 1,
x ∈R.
The rest is easy.

ϕ(0) = 1,
ϕ′(0) = −2.

for every ﬁxed x ∈R, so ϱ = ∞.
Remark 2.5 This equation can also be solved alternatively by some manipulation. It is, however,
more tricky here. By some trial and error we see that the right idea must be to multiply the equation
by 1−x, then add something and immediately subtract it again. We introduce in this way a singularity
at x = 1, which ought to be discussed as well. We shall, however, decline from doing this here.
We get by using the sketch above,
0

x(1 −x)d2y

Then notice that
d


(1−x)dy
dx + (2−x)y

= (1−x)d2y

ex
x(1 −x)2 dx.
We have a power series expansion of the ﬁrst term from x = 0. This does not exist for the second
term because of the factor x in the denominator of the integrand. On the other hand, the singularity
at x = 1 is removed, because the singularity of the integrand of second order (in the denominator) by
integration becomes a singularity of ﬁrst order, and this is cancelled by the factor 1 −x, which has a
zero of ﬁrst order at x = 1. ♦

Remark 2.6 If we here remove the terms for n = 0 and n = 1, we get precisely the desired form.
The following investigation becomes, however, more easy, if we keep the equivalent form, derived
here, which is obtained by adding zero terms.
2) It follows from the identity theorem that a1 = 0. Since n + 2 ̸= 0 for n ≥0, we derive the
recursion formula
(n + 3)an+2 + (n + 1)an = 0,
for n ≥0.
The recursion formula has a leap of 2 in the indices. Since already a1 = 0, we conclude by induction
that a2n+1 = 0 for all odd indices.
For even indices the recursion formula is written
(2n + 3)a2(n+1) + (2n + 1)a2n = 0,
for n ≥0,
hence by recursion,
a2(n+1) = −2n+1
2n+3 a2n = (−1)n+1 · 2n+1
2n+3 · 2n−1
2n+1 · · · 1
3 a0 = (−1)n+1
2n + 3 a0.
Then by a change of index,
a2n = (−1)n
2n + 1 a0 = (−1)n
2n + 1,
n ∈N, og for n = 0.
The formal power series solution is given by
y =
∞

n=0
(−1)n
2n + 1 x2n.
The radius of convergence is ϱ = 1, so the series is convergent for ]−1, 1[.

y = 1
x

Remark 2.7 Again the example can be treated alternatively with some manipulation,

,
so (29) can be written
(31)
d
dx

(x2 + 1) d

If we integrate (31), then
(x2 + 1) d
dx(xy) = c2,
i.e.
d
dx(xy) =
c2
x2 + 1.
Then by another integration,
xy = c1 + c2 Arctan x,
hence
y = c1
x + c2
Arctan x
x
for x ̸= 0.
Since Arctan x
x
→1 for x →0, and Arctan x
x
is even and diﬀerentiable with ϕ′(0) = 0, and since 1
x
cannot be extended to 0, the answer of (2) becomes
y = ϕ(x) = Arctan x

Example 2.9 Given the diﬀerential equation
(32) (x2 + x)d2y
dx2 + (3x + 2)dy
dx + y = 0,
x ∈R.
1) Prove that if the power series of radius of convergence ϱ > 0,
(33)

is a solution of (32), then

for x ∈]−ϱ, ϱ[.
2) Prove that (32) has a solution y = ϕ(x) of the form (33), satisfying the condition ϕ(0) = 1.
3) Find the sum function for the power series of (2).
Remark 2.8 We ﬁrst demonstrate the “untraditional” solution, which shows that it pays oﬀjust to
think about the problem before one starts on some standard procedure.
We get by some small rearrangements of the equation
0
=
(x2 + x)d2y
dx2 + (3x + 2)dy
dx + y =

(x2+x)d2y
dx2 + (2x+1)dy

(x + 1)

xdy



dx

(x + 1) d
dx(xy)

.
Hence by an integration,
(x + 1) d
dx(xy) = c1,
i.e.
d
dx(xy) =
c1
1 + x
for x ̸= −1.
Then by another integration,
x · y = c1 ln |1 + x| + c2.
If we also assume that x ̸= 0, then we get the complete solution
y = c1
ln |1 + x|
x
+ c2 · 1
x
for x ̸= 0, −1.
The former function can actually be extended to x = 0, because the power series expansion for
0 < |x| < 1 is
ln(1 + x)
x

Then we apply the standard method.


n=0
(n + 1){(n + 1)an + (n + 2)an+1}xn.
When we remove the ﬁrst two terms, we get the desired form. We shall, however, here keep the
form above, because it will be more convenient in the following.
2) The series above is a power series expansion of 0. This is by the identity theorem unique, hence
we get by identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients the following recursion formula
(n + 1){(n + 1)an + (n + 2)an+1} = 0
for n ∈N0.
Now, n + 1 ̸= 0 for n ∈N0, so this is immediately reduced to
(n + 2)an+1 = −(n + 1)an,
n ∈N0.
This diﬀerence equation can be solved in three diﬀerent ways.
a) The divine inspiration. If we introduce
bn = (−1)n(n + 1)an,
then
bn+1 = (−1)n+1(n + 2)an+1 = (−1)n(n + 1)an = bn,
n ∈N,
and thus
(−1)n(n + 1)an = bn = bn−1 = · · · = b0 = 1 · a0 = ϕ(0) = 1.

We then get
an = (−1)n
n + 1
for n ∈N0.
b) Recursion. It follows from
(n + 1)an = −nan−1
that
an = −
n
n + 1 an−1,
n ∈N.
By repeating this formula with n replaced by n −1 etc., we get

c) Induction. Consider again the recursion formula in the form
an = −
n
n + 1 an−1,
n ∈N,
med a0 = 1.
If n = 1, then a1 = −1
2.
If n = 2, then a2 = −2
3
	
−1
2

3.
If n = 3, then a3 = −3
4 · 1
3 = −1
4.
This gives us the hint of the structure
an = (−1)n
n + 1 ,
n ∈N0.
Assume that this formula holds for some n ∈N0. This is at least true for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Then we get by this assumption that
an+1 = −n + 1
n + 2 an = −n + 1
n + 2 · (−1)n
n + 1 = (−1)n+1
n + 2 ,
which is the assumption of induction with n replaced by n + 1. Hence
an = (−1)n
n + 1 ,
for n ∈N0.
We see that no matter the choice of method of the solution of the recursion formula, the formal
power series solution of the problem becomes
ϕ(x) =
∞

n=0
anxn =

n=0

The radius of convergence can be found by the criterion of roots,

hence ϱ = 1.
3) The formal power series can also be written

hence ϱ = 1, and


n=4
{(n−2)(n−3)an+an−2}xn,
and we can in the following argue on both expressions. We shall here choose the given version
from the example.
Remark 2.9 Because possible singular points are given by x2 = 0, i.e. x = 0, the possible radii
of convergence are ϱ ∈{0, ∞}.

2) It follows from the initial conditions,
ϕ(0) = a0 = 0,
ϕ′(0) = 0 = a1,
ϕ′′(0) = 2!a2 = 2,
ϕ′′′(0) = 3!a3 = 0,
thus
a0 = 0,
a1 = 0,
a2 = 1,
a3 = 0.
Then by the identity theorem,
6a0 = 0,
2a1 = 0,
a0 = 0,
a1 = 0,
and
(n −2)(n −3)an + an−2 = 0,
for n ≥4,
which fortunately is in agreement with a0 = 0 and a1 = 0 found previously.
If n ≥4, then (n −2)(n −3) > 0, and the recursion formula is rewritten as
an = −
1
(n −2)(n −3) an−2,
for n ≥4.

There is here a leap of 2 in the indices, so we shall divide into the two cases of odd and even
indices.
From a3 = 0 follows by induction that a2p+1 = 0 for all odd indices ≥3, thus for all odd indices,
because also a1 = 0.
For even indices we write n = 2p ≥4, which is satisﬁed for p ≥2,
a2p = −
1
(2p −2)(2p −3) a2(p−1),
p ≥2.
In order to ﬁnd some common pattern we try the ﬁrst values,
a2 = 1,
a4 = −1
2 · 1,
a6 = +
1
4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 1
4!.
These values inspires us to the hypothesis of induction
a2p = (−1)p+1
(2p −2)!,
i.e. a2(p−1) =
(−1)p
(2p −4)!.
a) By the ﬁrst values it is seen that the hypothesis holds for p = 1, 2, 3.
b) Induction. Assume that
a2(p−1) =
(−1)p
(2p −4)!
for some p ≥2.
Then by the recursion formula
a2p = −
1
(2p −2)(2p −3) a2(p−1) = −
1
(2p −2)(2p −3) ·
(−1)p
(2p −4)! = (−1)p+1
(2p −2)!,
which is precisely the hypothesis of induction for p.

If we put z = y
x2 , the equation is reduced to
d2z
dx2 + z = 0,
the complete solution of which is
z = y
x2 = c1 cos x + c2 sin x,
hence
y = c1x2 cos x + c2x2 sin x,
for x ̸= 0.
Example 2.11 Given the diﬀerential equation
(36) x2 d2y
dx2 −2xdy
dx + (x2 + 2)y = 0,
x ∈R.

2) Prove that (36) has a y = ϕ(x) of the form (37), satisfying the initial conditions
ϕ(0) = 0,
ϕ′(0) = 0,
ϕ′′(0) = 2.


n=3
{(n−1)(n−2)an+an−2}xn = 0.
2) It follows from the identity theorem that a0 = 0 and that the recursion formula becomes
(n −1)(n −2)an + an−2 = 0
for n ≥3
It is given that
ϕ(0) = a0 = 0,
(in agreement with the identity theorem),
ϕ′(0) = 1 · a1 = 0,
i.e. a1 = 0,
ϕ′′(0) = 2!a2 = 2,
i.e. a2 = 1.
The recursion formula has a leap of 2 in the indices, so it follows from a1 = 0 by induction that
a2m+1 = 0, m ∈N0.
If n = 2m is even, the recursion formula is written
(39) (2m −1)(2m −2)a2m = −a2(m−1)
for m ≥2.
(Note that m ̸= 1).
When we multiply by (−1)m−1(2m −3)! ̸= 0, we get
bm := (−1)m−1(2m −1)!a2m = (−1)m−2(2m −3)!a2(m−1) = bm−1,
thus
bm = (−1)m−1(2m −1)!a2m = · · · = b1 = (−1)0 · 1!a2 = 1,
and hence
a2n = (−1)n−1
(2n −1)!,
n ∈N.
Alternatively we get by recursion of (39),
a2m
=
−
1
(2m −1)(2m −2) a2(m−1) = (−1)2

(2m −1)(2m −2)(2m −3)(2m −4) a2(m−2)

(2m −1)(2m −2) · · · 3 · 2 a2 = (−1)m−1

If x ̸= 0, then an(x) =

(−1)n−1
(2n −1)! x2n
 =
x2n
(2n −1)! > 0. We get by the criterion of quotients
for x ̸= 0 that
an+1(x)
an(x)
=
x2n+2
(2n+1)! · (2n−1)!
x2n
=

(2n+1)2n →0 for n →∞.
Hence we conclude by the criterion of quotiens that the series is convergent for every x ∈R, so
the interval of convergence is R.

(−1)n
(2n+1)! x2n+1 = x sin x,

Remark 2.11 One can also solve this equation by a small trick. Since we have a singular point at
x = 0, and since x = 0 clearly gives y(0) = 0 for every solution, it seems natural to put y = xz and
then derive some diﬀerential equation in z. From
dy
dx = x dz
dx + z
og
d2y
dx2 = x d2z
dx2 + 2 dz
dx,
follows by insertion that
0

x2 d2y
dx2 −2xdy
dx + (x2 + 2)y =

x3 d2z


x3z+2xz

=
x3 d2z
dx2 + x3z = x3
 d2z
dx2 + z

.
Thus, we get the equation when x ̸= 0,
d2z
dx2 + z = 0,
the complete solution of which is
z = c1 sin x + c2 cos x.
Therefore, if x ̸= 0 then the complete solution of the original equation is
y = c1x sin x + c2x cos x,
c1, c2 arbitrære.
Remark 2.12 If we put y1(x) = x sin x, then both y1(0) = 0 and y′
1(0) = 0. This fact will cause some
extension problems at x = 0, where we cannot conclude anything from the existence and uniqueness
theorem. We shall not go further into this diﬃcult question.

Then by the identity theorem.
(40) a1 = 0
and
a3 = 0,
and the recursion formula (with a leap of 4 in the indices)
(41) n(n −2)an = 4an−4
for n ≥4.
2) We get by induction from (40) and (41) that a4n+1 = 0 and a4n+3 = 0, hence
a2n+1 = 0
for n ∈N0.
If y(0) = a0 = 1 and y′′(0) = 2!a2 = 0, thus a2 = 0, it follows again by induction that
a4n+2 = 0
for n ∈N0.
The remaining case is an = a4m, i.e. n = 4m, m ∈N0, where a0 = 1. We write in this case (41) in
the form
4m(4m −2)a4m = 4a4m−4,
m ≥1,
which is rewritten as
(42) 2m(2m −1)a4m = a4(m−1),
m ≥1.
We can solve this recursion formula in several ways, of which we shall only demonstrate a couple.
a) If (42) is multiplied by (2m −2)! = (2(m −1))!, then
(2m)!a4m = {2(m −1)}!a4(m−1) = · · · = {2 · 0}!a0 = 1,
hence
a4m =
1
(2m)!,
m ∈N0.

b) We get by recursion from (42) that
a4m

a2·2m =

2m(2m −1) · a2·(2m−1) =
1
2m(2m −1)(2m −2)(2m −3) a2·(2,−4)

2m(2m −1) · · · 2 · 1 a2·0 =

y =


m=0
a4mx4m =


m=0
1
(2n)!(x2)2m = cosh(x2).
We recognize the series as the series of cosh(x2) of radius of convergence ϱ = ∞, so the interval
of convergence is R.
3) If some power series solution existed with y′(0) = 1, then a1 = 1, which violates (40). Hence, we
cannot have any power series solution of the equation, for which y′(0) = 1.
Alternatively, put t = 0 into the diﬀerential equation,
0 = 0 · y′′(0) −y′(0) −4 · 03y(0) = −y′(0),
dvs. y′(0) = 0.
It is immediately seen that one cannot have any solution for which y′(0) = 1 whatsoever.
Remark 2.13 By using a general solution formula, a linearly independent solution is given by

Example 2.13 Consider the diﬀerential equation

dx2 + x2y = 0.
Given (and shall not be proved) that there exists a power series solution of the form ∞
n=0 anxn.
1) Find a recursion formula for the coeﬃcients an of the power series solution (one shall not solve
the equation of recursion).
2) Find a0, a1, a2, a3 and a4 for the power series solution for which we have the initial conditions
y(0) = 1 and y′(0) = 0.
1) By inserting the formal series
y =

Then by the identity theorem, a2 = 0 and a3 = 0, and the recursion formula
n(n −1)an + an−4 = 0
for n ≥4,
thus
(n + 4)(n + 3)an+4 + an = 0
for n ≥0.
2) Clearly, a0 = 1 and a1 = 0. It follows from (1) that a2 = 0 and a3 = 0. Finally, we get from the
recursion formula,
(0 + 4)(0 + 3)a4 + a0 = 0
for n = 0,
so a4 = −1
12.
Summing up we have
a0 = 1,
a1 = a2 = a3 = 0
and
a4 = −1

An eigenvalue problem solved by the power series method
Example 3.1 One can sometimes also use the power series method in more complicated problems.
We shall here give one example of an eigenvalue problem, which can be solved by the power series
method. If one wants to know more about eigenvalue problems, the reader is referred to e.g. Calculus
4b.
Consider the eigenvalue problem
d4y
dx4 + (λ −x)d2y
dx2 −dy
dx = 0,
x ∈[0, λ].
y(0) = y′(0) = y′′(λ) = y′′′(λ) = 0.
This is the model equation of the deviation from the vertical of a vertically thin column of length λ
under the inﬂuence of the weight of the column itself. We shall ﬁnd the smallest eigenvalue λ.
1) Start by an inspection of the equation. Since
d
dx

(λ −x)dy
dx

= (λ −x)d2y
dx2 −dy
dx,
we can also write the diﬀerential equation in the form
d4y
dx4 + d
dx

(λ −x)dy
dx

= 0.
This can immediately be integrated
d3y
dx3 + (λ −x)dy
dx = c,
c arbitrær.
2) Identiﬁcation of c by the boundary value y′′′(λ) = 0 gives
c = y′′′(λ) + (λ −λ)y′(λ) = 0.
Hence, the problem is reduced to the simpler homogeneous equation
d3y
dx3 + (λ −x)dy
dx = 0,
which is identiﬁed as a second order diﬀerential equation in dy
dx. If we therefore put z = dy
dx, then
d2z
dx2 + (λ −x)z = 0,
where the boundary values for z are given by
z(0) = y′(0) = 0
and
z′(λ) = y′′(λ) = 0.
Remark 3.1 We have already used the boundary value y′′′(λ) = z′′(λ) = 0 above, and we see
that it also follows from the equation. Furthermore, y(0) = 0 is not at all relevant for z = y′.

3) Change of variable. The factor λ −x is annoying, so we chance the variable to t = λ −x. If we
put
u(t) = z(x),
i.e.
u(λ −x) = z(x),
the equation is transferred into
d2u
dt2 + tu(t) = 0
med
u(λ) = 0 og u′(0) = 0.
4) We shall now for some time neglect the boundary condition u(λ) = 0, when we ﬁnd a power series
solution of this equation. We shall of course later apply the condition u(λ) = 0. Since u′(0) = 0,
we have a1 = 0. By insertion of the formal series
u(t) =

It follows from the identity theorem that a2 = 0 (we knew already that a1 = 0), and for n ∈N
(the summation domain)
(n + 2)(n + 1)an+2 + an−1 = 0
for n ∈N.
By n →n + 1 this is transformed into
(n + 3)(n + 2)an+3 + an = 0
for n ∈N0.
Here we have a leap of 3 in the indices, hence, because a1 = 0 and a2 = 0, we conclude by induction
that
a3n+1 = 0
and
a3n+2 = 0
for n ∈N0.
We have now reduced the power series solution to

where the recursion formula for a3n = bn is obtained by the change n →3n, thus

and hence
bn+1 = −

(3n + 3)(3n + 2) bn,
bn = a3n,

Hence, the series is convergent for every t ∈R, and ϱ = ∞.
Now we should in reality consider a boundary value problem, so a0 = b0 ̸= 0 are“free”. We
choose arbitrarily a0 = b0 = 1. Then by induction,

6) It remains to ﬁnd the smallest (positive) λ = λcrit, for which we have a proper solution, i.e. for
which a0 ̸= 0. Here we use the boundary condition y′(0) = 0, hence by (43),
y′(0) =
∞

n=0
a3nλ3n = 0
where a0 = 1.
This transcendent equation is solved approximately in the following way:
We put for convenience η = λ3, and ﬁnd successively the smallest root of each of the polynomials
Pn(η) =
n

k=0
a3kηk,
n ∈N.
Since a3k has alternating sign, the possible real roots can only be positive. In the ﬁrst polynomials
we may only get complex roots. However, if two successive polynomials Pn(η) and Pn+1(η) have
their (smallest) real roots ηn and ηn+1, then every successive polynomial Pn+m(η) will also have
a (smallest) real root ηn+m. Since a3n is alternating it is easily proved that ηn+m, m > 1, always
lies between ηn and ηn+1, so we obtain a convergent sequence of number. The following numerical
calculations show that the convergence is fairly fast.
