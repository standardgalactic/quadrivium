Preface
Welcome to Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6. Part of Wiley’s Adobe courseware series, 
this book is designed as a complete introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver for Creative Suite 
6. With this series, we’ve set out to produce a series of textbooks that deliver compelling 
and innovative teaching solutions to instructors and superior learning experiences for 
students. Infused and informed by in-depth knowledge from Adobe Certified Experts and 
Dreamweaver professionals who have created many official training titles for Adobe Systems, 
and crafted by a publisher known worldwide for the pedagogical quality of its products, these 
textbooks maximize skills transfer in minimum time. Students are challenged to reach their 
potential by using their new technical skills as highly productive members of the workforce. 
This courseware was designed to ensure you receive the topical coverage that is most relevant 
to your personal and professional success. 
Wiley’s Adobe courseware Program
Wiley’s Adobe courseware series is a complete program for instructors and institutions to 
prepare and deliver great courses on Adobe software technologies. With this courseware series, 
we recognize that—because of the rapid pace of change in the technology and curriculum 
developed by Adobe—there is an ongoing set of needs beyond classroom instruction tools 
for an instructor to be ready to teach the course. This courseware program endeavors to 
provide solutions for all these needs in a systematic manner in order to ensure a successful and 
rewarding course experience for both instructor and student via technical and curriculum 
training for instructor readiness with new software releases and a great set of tools for 
delivering instruction in the classroom and lab. All are important to the smooth delivery of a 
course on Adobe software, and all are provided with Wiley’s Adobe courseware program. We 
think about this model as a gauge for ensuring that we completely support you in your goal of 
teaching a great course. 
VIDEO TUTORIALS
Your Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 textbook comes with access to approximately 
2 hours of online video tutorials. The video tutorials are designed to supplement each lesson 
in the book. These video tutorials are created and presented by the authors and demonstrate 
topics covered in each lesson or related topics that enhance your understanding of each lesson.

Pedagogical Features
The Wiley Adobe courseware and textbooks for Adobe Creative Suite 6 are designed as 
complete introductory textbooks on a particular Adobe software product. The books are 
also designed to cover all the learning objectives for that product’s related Adobe Certified 
Associate (ACA) exam. The ACA exam is industry-recognized and identifies skills and topics 
expected for entry-level positions. Each ACA exam item is referred to as an exam objective, 
and these objectives are highlighted throughout the textbooks. Many pedagogical features have 
been developed specifically for this courseware. Unique features of our task-based approach 
include a Lesson Skill Matrix that correlates skills taught in each lesson to the ACA objectives; 
Certification Ready exercises; and two levels of increasingly rigorous lesson-ending activities—
Competency Assessment and Proficiency Assessment.
Presenting the extensive procedural information and technical concepts woven throughout 
the textbook raises challenges for the student and instructor alike. The Illustrated Book Tour 
that follows provides a guide to the rich features contributing to Wiley’s Adobe courseware 
pedagogical plan. Following is a list of key features in each lesson designed to prepare students 
for success on the certification exams and in the workplace:
• Each lesson begins with a Lesson Skill Matrix. More than a standard list of learning 
objectives, the skill matrix correlates each software skill covered in the lesson to the 
specific ACA exam objective.
• Each lesson features a real-world Business Case scenario that places the software skills 
and knowledge to be acquired in a real-world setting.
• Concise and frequent Step-by-Step instructions teach students new features and provide 
an opportunity for hands-on practice. Numbered steps give detailed instructions to help 
students learn software skills. The steps also show results and screen images to match what 
students should see on their computer screens.
• Illustrations provide visual feedback as students work through the exercises. The images 
reinforce key concepts, provide visual clues about the steps, and allow students to check 
their progress.
• When the text instructs a student to use a particular tool, tool images are shown within 
the text.
• Important technical vocabulary is listed in the Key Terms section at the beginning of the 
lesson. When these terms are used later in the lesson, they appear in bold italic type and 
are defined. The Glossary contains all of the key terms and their definitions.
• Engaging point-of-use Reader Aids located throughout the lessons tell students why 
this topic is relevant (The Bottom Line) and provide students with helpful hints (identified 
with the words Take Note) or ways to expand their skills (identified using the text Learning 
More). Reader aids also provide additional relevant or background information that adds 
value to the lesson.
• Certification Ready features throughout the text signal students where a specific 
certification objective is covered. They provide students with a chance to check their 
understanding of that particular ACA exam objective and, if necessary, review the section 
of the lesson where it is covered. This courseware provides complete preparation for ACA 
certification.
• Each lesson ends with a Skill Summary, recapping the ACA exam skills covered in

the lesson.
• Accompanying video tutorials for each lesson provide a visual way to see selected 
content from the each lesson presented by the authors.
• The Knowledge Assessment section provides a total of 20 questions from a mix of 
True/False and Multiple Choice, testing students on concepts learned in the lesson.
• Competency Assessment and Proficiency Assessment sections provide progressively 
more challenging lesson-ending activities.
• Integrated Circling Back projects provide students with an opportunity to renew and 
practice skills learned in previous lessons.
• The student companion website contains the online files needed for each lesson.

Business Case
The company owners are in a hurry to get the website started. They have provided 
you with sample text content and images to add to the site. They’d like the text to 
be formatted in a uniform way across the site. The company has specifi c colors and 
fonts the owners would like used for the type, but want to make sure headers and 
body copy are distinct from one another. Some of the tools you’ll need to understand 
to make an effi  cient workfl ow for these requirements will include CSS and image 
placeholders.

Lesson 2: Setting Up a New Site 
A deeper look into the Files panel
Renaming and updating links in the Files panel
The Files panel can perform tasks within Dreamweaver that are typically done within your 
operating system such as renaming and deleting fi les. Not only does this save time but has 
other advantages as well. In the case of renaming fi les, Dreamweaver will automatically allow 
you to update any links on the page including images.
Follow these steps to update links
Step-by-Step
1. In the Files panel, expand the images folder if necessary by clicking on the arrow (Mac) or 
plus sign (PC) immediately to the left of the folder icon.
2. Click once on the fi le name beets.jpg and it will become active signifying that you can 
rename the fi le name. Type bunchofbeets and then press Return/Enter. The Update 
Files window appears asking if you would like to update index.html.
3. Press Update. Nothing will have appeared to change, which is exactly the point. If 
you had renamed this graphic in your operating system,, there would have been a 
broken image on your page because the original reference to beets.jpg would be wrong. 
Dreamweaver recognizes the potential error and prompts you to fi x it by updating the 
link. Behind the scenes in your HTML, Dreamweaver has rewritten the correct code for 
you. This is a major advantage in using Dreamweaver as it makes it diffi  cult for you to 
accidently break links to assets in your site.
4. You can also duplicate and/or delete fi les within the Files panel. Select the 
bunchofbeets.jpg image in the Files panel and then click on the context menu in the top 
right of the panel and choose Edit > Duplicate. A duplicate image with the word copy in 
the fi le name is added to your Files panel.
5. Select the duplicate image you just created (bunchofbeets - Copy.jpg) and press the 
Delete key on your keyboard. You will be prompted by Dreamweaver asking if you want 
to delete the selected fi les. Press yes and the fi le will be gone.
6. Choose File > Save All. Congratulations! You have fi nished this lesson.

Lesson 14: Adding Interactivity with the Spry Framework 
The Spry Accordion panel
6. Repeat step 5 for the labels 2, 3, and 4, renaming them Clothing, Home Products, and 
Lifestyle, respectively. Next, you’ll add content to each panel that corresponds to its label.
7. In your Files panel, locate the text folder and expand it. Double-click and open the fi le 
named accordiontext.html. This contains the text you’ll add to the accordion panel.
8. Select the text below the Food Products heading (don’t include the heading itself), and 
choose Edit > Cut. Return back to your index_work.html page.
9. Click the blue tab labeled Spry Accordion: Accordion 1 to ensure it is selected; then, in the 
Properties panel, click the Food Products panel to open it (Figure 14-20). 
Figure 14-20: Open the Food Products panel by clicking it in the Properties panel.
Highlight the placeholder text on your page, and then choose Edit > Paste to paste it in 
the text from your content fi le.
10. Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the remaining paragraphs in the accordiontext.html fi le, pasting 
them into the Clothing, Home Products, and Lifestyle panels, respectively.
As with the other Spry Widgets, the default style will need to be changed to match the 
look and feel of your site.
11. Under the CSS Styles panel, locate the attached style sheet named SpryAccordion.css, 
and expand it to reveal its rules.
12. Select the .AccordionPanelTab rule. To the right of the background color property, click 
the color swatch and notice that your cursor is an eyedropper. Place the eyedropper in the 
green area immediately above the accordion, and click once to sample the green color from 
the header (Figure 14-21). This sets the background color to #88B036 (green).
Figure 14-21: Using the eyedropper, sample the green from the header to apply it as a background-color.
13. Select the .AccordionPanelOpen .AccordionPanelTab rule. Click on the 
background-color value and type #CF9, then press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). This sets the open panel color to a light green,
14. Select the .AccordionPanelContent rule. Locate the height property shown in the 
Properties list, and change its value from 200px to 100px. This changes the height of the 
content panels when shown.
There are a few more styles to change before you are done styling the accordion. One of 
the default styles for this widget is a Focused style which defi nes the appearance of the 
accordion when it is selected. By default, it is blue (although you cannot see this unless you 
preview in a browser), so you will change this now.

Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Understanding hyperlinks
3. Press the Live button located in the Document toolbar at the top of your page as seen in 
Figure 3-9. You will not see a dramatic diff erence, but your text may shift slightly. Select 
the fi rst heading in the window and try to delete it; you will be unable to, because Live 
View is a non-editable workspace. However, Live View does allow you to edit your page 
when you are in Split view. Here, you are allowed to edit in the Code view and changes 
will be refl ected in real time. An additional advantage is that your document does not have 
to be saved in order to see the changes.
Figure 3-9: When Live View is enabled, Dreamweaver simulates a web browser.
4. Click the Live button again to deactivate this view. While Live View is a useful addition to 
Dreamweaver, it does not replace the need to preview your page in a browser. Web pages 
might be rendered diff erently depending on your visitor’s browser, and so it is a good habit 
to check your page occasionally as you make changes to your design. 
Take Note...
You can also preview your page designs in other browsers and for diff erent platforms using 
Adobe’s Browser Lab service. We cover the steps for this in Lesson 16,” Managing your 
Website: Reports, Optimization, and Maintenance.”
Understanding hyperlinks
When people visit a website, they usually expect to see more than one page. Imagine trying 
to shop for a new book by your favorite author on a site that consisted of nothing more than 
a single order form with every book off ered by a retailer like Amazon.com. This might seem 
absurd, but without hyperlinks you wouldn’t have much choice.
Hyperlinks make the Web a truly interactive environment. They allow the user to freely 
navigate throughout a website, or jump from one site to another. There are a number of ways 
to create links in Dreamweaver, but before you get started, you should be aware of some 
fundamental facts. 
Links rely on directory paths to locate fi les. A directory path is simply a description of a fi le’s 
location that can be understood by a computer. A classic, real-world example is an address. If 
you wanted to send a letter to your friend Sally in Florida, you would have to specify the state, 
city, street, and house number where Sally can be found. If Sally lived at 123 Palm Street in 
Orlando, the path would be:
Florida/Orlando/123 Palm Street/Sally

5. Choose View > Code. You will now look at some of the coding features available in the 
coding toolbar in Dreamweaver.
The Coding toolbar
The Coding toolbar contains buttons that let you perform many standard coding operations, 
such as collapsing and expanding code selections, highlighting invalid code, applying and 
removing comments, indenting code, and inserting recently used code snippets. The Coding 
toolbar is visible only in the Code view and appears vertically on the left side of the document 
window. To see what each button does, position the cursor over it until a tooltip appears.

Open Documents
Lists the documents that are open. When you select a document, 
it is displayed in the document window.
Show Code Navigator
Displays a list of code sources related to a particular selection 
on your page. Use it to navigate to related code sources, such 
as internal and external CSS rules, server-side includes, external 
JavaScript files, parent template files, library files, and iframe 
source files. You can access the Code Navigator from Design, 
Code, and Split views, as well as from the Code Inspector.
Collapse Full Tag
Collapses the content between a set of opening and closing tags 
(for example, the content between <body> and </body>). You 
must place the insertion point in the opening or closing tag and 
then click to collapse it.
Collapse Selection
Collapses the selected code.
Expand All
Restores all collapsed code.
Select Parent Tag
Selects the content and surrounding opening and closing 
tags of the line in which you’ve placed the insertion point. If 
you repeatedly click this button, and your tags are balanced, 
Dreamweaver will eventually select the outermost <html> and 
</html> tags.
Balance Braces
Selects the content and surrounding parentheses, braces, or 
square brackets of the line in which you’ve placed the insertion 
point. If you repeatedly click this button, and your surrounding 
symbols are balanced, Dreamweaver will eventually select the 
outermost braces, parentheses, or brackets in the document.
Line Numbers
Hides or shows numbers at the beginning of each line of code.
Highlight Invalid Code
Highlights invalid code in yellow.
Word Wrap
Changes the Word Wrap from Soft Wrap to Hard Wrap (or vice-
versa)
Syntax Error Alerts in 
Info Bar
Enables or disables an information bar at the top of the page 
that alerts you to syntax errors. When Dreamweaver detects a 
syntax error, the Syntax Error Information bar specifies the line 
in the code where the error occurs. Additionally, Dreamweaver 
highlights the error’s line number on the left side of the 
document in Code view. The info bar is enabled by default, but 
only appears when Dreamweaver detects syntax errors in the 
page.

Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Linking images
Image maps
If you would like to add active links within a graphic , then you need to turn to image 
maps. Sometimes called “hotspots,” an image map is one or more defined areas within a 
graphic that are hyperlinked to unique documents. For example, imagine a graphic that 
displays the United States. You would like your user to be able to click on any one of the 
states in the image and navigate to a unique HTML page. You can accomplish this with 
Dreamweaver’s hotspot tools.
The three hotspot tools are the circle, rectangle and polygon. Each of these tools will 
allow you to draw an area on top of an image and then link to a document. In the map 
example above, if there were a square or rectangle-shaped state (like Kansas) you could 
use the rectangle hotspot tool. If there were such a thing as a circular or oval state you 
could use the circle hotspot tool. Most useful in this example would be the polygon 
hotspot tool which lets you create multi-sided hotspots, so you could trace the borders of 
Massachusetts for example.
To create an image map area
1. Select an image in the Design view of a page that you would like to add a hotspot. 
When the image is selected in the bottom half of the Properties panel you will see 
the map section. (If you do not see this section it may be collapsed from view. Click 
on the white arrow in the lower-right corner of the Properties panel to expand it.)
2. Select either the rectangle, circle or polygon hotspot tool and draw the shape over 
the area you would like to make active. When you fi rst click, a dialog box will 
appear prompting you to add “alt” text for your image map. Click OK.
Alt text helps with the accessibility of your page by adding a text description that can 
be read by screen readers.
Note: If you are using the polygon hotspot tool click in the image to set the starting 
point. Position the pointer where you want the fi rst straight segment to end, and 
click. Continue clicking to set endpoints for subsequent segments. 
3. If necessary, you may reshape the boundaries of the hotspot by clicking on the 
Pointer hotspot tool then clicking and dragging any of the anchor points that appear. 
4. When done drawing and modifying your shape with your shape type relevant text 
into the Alt fi eld that appears in the Hotspot section of the Properties Panel. 
5. To add a link to document, you may either type a url in the Link fi eld or use the 
Point to File icon or Browse for File button just like you would with a standard 
hyperlink. 
6. Locate the Map fi eld in the Properties panel and type an appropriate name for your 
image map. This map name is used for a single map and should be unique, especially 
if you have more than one image map on a page.

Lesson 4
Circling Back 1 
Building an effi  cient workfl ow is essential when it comes to creating a website. You can spend 
many hours just updating pages if you don’t understand global options such as templates, 
library items, and CSS. If you get all three components working together, you can focus on 
other areas, such as design and content, without tediously updating one page at a time with 
simple changes such as background color or font. 
Building a CSS Template Page
Project 1
Project 1: Building a CSS Template Page
The design company you work for is interested in building pages that will act as CSS templates 
for future clients. Your employers want sample pages that will display some generic color and 
text format schemes they can use for a presentation on a sales pitch meeting. They want the 
layout and design to be simple, but concentrate on how the text will appear. 
Launch Dreamweaver if you haven’t already. Establish a new root folder and site called CSS 
templates. 
1. Create a new web page; save it as CSS-template.html.
2. Type the following text on the new HTML page:
Mr. Mike’s Pizzeria
Nothing compares to our hand-tossed pizza made with only the freshest 
ingredients. Try our signature pizzas, tasty salads and signature breadsticks. 
Copyright 2012 Mr. Mike’s Pizzeria, LLC. All Right Reserved
3. Use the button on the left of the panel to make sure the Properties panel is set to the CSS 
settings and not to HTML. 
4. Highlight the Header text, “Mr. Mike’s Pizzeria”; using the Properties panel, change the 
font to Tahoma.
5. Once the New CSS Rule window opens, set the selector type to Class. Name the selector 
.header. For the Rule Defi nition, choose New Style Sheet File. 
6. Name the new fi le style-template.css and save it in your root folder. 
7. Click the Edit Rule button. Set the Font-size to 18 pt. Click the Background Category 
and choose a light blue for Background-color. 
8. Click OK. 
9. Select the body copy text and click the Edit Rule button. Leave Class as the selector 
type and name the selector .body; the Rule Defi nition should just remain in your style-
template.css fi le.
10. Choose Georgia for the Font-family and set the Font-size to 12 pt. Choose black for the 
Color setting. Click OK when fi nished. 
11. Select the text “Copyright 2012 Mr. Mike’s Pizzeria, LLC. All Right Reserved” and click 
the Edit Rule button. Leave Class as the selector type and name the selector .footer; the 
Rule Defi nition should just remain in your style-template.css fi le.
12. Choose Georgia for the Font-family and set the Font-size to 9 pt. Choose a dark gray for 
the Color setting. Click OK when fi nished. 
13. Choose File > Save All to save all fi les.

Preparing to Take an Exam
The workplace demand for digital media skills—creating, managing, integrating, and 
communicating information by using Adobe’s dynamic multimedia, video, graphic, web, or 
design software—is on the rise. This new certification program will help educators effectively 
teach and validate digital communications skills while providing students with credentials that 
demonstrate real-world prowess to prospective employers.
What are the Benefits of Becoming Certified?
By certifying one’s skills, individuals can validate their technical abilities and demonstrate 
proficiency. Adobe’s associate-level certifications are based on research about digital 
communications skills required by industry, government, and education. The objectives reflect 
the foundation skills needed to be successful communicators in today’s digital world.
In educational settings, industry-recognized certification programs ensure students and 
teachers are acquiring the knowledge and skills valued in today’s workplace. For institutions 
seeking to keep curriculum vitalized and relevant, certification plays a critical role in bridging 
classroom learning to real-world application.
Preparing to Take an Exam
Unless you are a very experienced user, you will need to use a test preparation course to 
prepare for the test to complete it correctly and within the time allowed. Wiley’s Adobe 
courseware is designed to prepare you with a strong knowledge of all exam topics. With some 
additional review and practice on your own, you should feel confident in your ability to pass 
the appropriate exam.
After you decide which exam to take, review the list of objectives for the exam. This list can 
be found in Appendix A at the back of this book. You can also easily identify tasks that are 
included in the objective list by locating the Lesson Skill Matrix at the start of each lesson and 
the Certification Ready sidebars in the margin of the lessons in this book.
To take the ACA test, visit www.certiport.com/adobe to locate your nearest testing center. Then 
call the testing center directly to schedule your test. The amount of advance notice you should 
provide will vary for different testing centers, and it typically depends on the number of 
computers available at the testing center, the number of other testers who have already been 
scheduled for the day on which you want to take the test, and the number of times per week 
that the testing center offers ACA testing. In general, you should call to schedule your test at 
least two weeks prior to the date on which you want to take the test.
When you arrive at the testing center, you might be asked for proof of identity. A driver’s 
license or passport is an acceptable form of identification. If you do not have either of 
these items of documentation, call your testing center and ask what alternative forms of 
identification will be accepted. If you are retaking a test, bring your ACA identification 
number, which will have been given to you when you previously took the test. If you have not 
prepaid or if your organization has not already arranged to make payment for you, you will 
need to pay the test-taking fee when you arrive.
Test Format
All ACA certification tests are live, performance-based tests. There are no multiple-choice, 
true/false, or short-answer questions. Instructions are general: you are told the basic tasks to 
perform on the computer, but you aren’t given any help in figuring out how to perform them. 
You are not permitted to use reference material other than the application’s Help system.

Lesson 1
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
Before you start, be sure to download the lesson files from http://www.wiley.com/college/sc/adobeseries.
You will work with several files from the dw01lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting up section of this book.
Take Note...
If you want to get started and create a page, jump ahead to “Tag structure and attributes” 
later on in this lesson. Otherwise, the next few pages provide you with an overview of key 
capabilities and features of Dreamweaver CS6.
What is Dreamweaver?
Dreamweaver is an excellent web design and development tool for new and experienced 
users alike. Over the years it has become the preferred website creation and management 
program, providing a creative environment for both designers and developers. Whether you 
design websites, develop mobile phone content, or script complex server-side applications, 
Dreamweaver has something to offer. 
Design and layout tools
Dreamweaver’s many icon-driven menus and detailed panels such as the Insert panel 
(Figure 1-1) make it easy to insert and format text, images, and media (such as video files and 
Flash movies). This means that you can create attractive and functional web pages without 
knowing a single line of code—Dreamweaver takes care of building the code behind-the-
scenes for you. Dreamweaver does not create graphics from scratch; instead, it is integrated with 
Adobe Photoshop CS6, so you can import and adjust graphics from within the application.
Figure 1-1: The Insert panel features objects  
in several categories that let you easily add  
images, web forms, and media to your page.

Lesson 1: Dreamweaver CS6 Jumpstart
What is Dreamweaver?
Site management and File Transfer Protocol 
Dreamweaver has everything you need for complete site management, including built-in 
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) capabilities between a server and your local machine; reusable 
objects (such as page templates and library items); and site optimization tools (such as link 
checkers and site reports), so that you can ensure that your site functions properly and looks 
good. If you’re designing your pages with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), then the W3C 
Validation, the Browser Compatibility Check, and the CSS Advisor features will help you 
locate and troubleshoot any potential display issues that may occur across different web 
browsers.
Coding environment and text editor
Dreamweaver lets you work in a code-only view of your document (Figure 1-2) that acts 
as a powerful text editor. Features such as color-coding, indentation, and visual aids make 
Dreamweaver an excellent text editing or coding environment for web designers of any level.
Figure 1-2: Code view is a full-featured text editor that color-codes, tags, and scripts for editing  
that’s easier to decipher.
For more experienced developers, Dreamweaver supports popular coding and scripting 
languages, such as JavaScript, in addition to several server-side languages, including 
ColdFusion, PHP, and ASP.NET. Specialized insert menus and code panels help you build 
pages and applications in the language of your choice.
Take Note...
Scripting languages, such as those used to build interactive web pages or e-commerce sites, fall 
into two categories: client-side and server-side. Client-side languages (such as JavaScript) run 
in your browser, while server-side languages (such as ColdFusion) require that special software 
be installed on the server in order to run.

Lesson 1
Mobile design and development features
The tools in Dreamweaver have evolved as the Web has evolved. The most recent versions of 
the application have numerous features designed to help make your website look and function 
well in the rapidly growing arena of mobile phones and devices. The Multiscreen Preview 
feature allows you to preview your pages in common screen sizes for smartphones and tablets 
and can be accessed by choosing Window > Multiscreen Preview (Figure 1-3).
Additionally, there is support for creating Media Queries, which are a CSS3 feature aimed 
at creating unique page layouts for different-sized screens. For more advanced users there is  
support for jQuery Mobile, which creates unique user interfaces for touchscreen devices. There 
is also support for creating native applications for iOS and Android operating systems with the 
new addition of the PhoneGap integration added in Dreamweaver CS6.
Figure 1-3: Multiscreen Preview allows you to test your pages in common screen sizes for mobile and other devices.
Who uses Dreamweaver?
Dreamweaver’s popularity is a result of its flexibility. Its ability to build a site from conception 
to launch—and provide continued maintenance afterward—makes it a preferred tool among 
industry professionals, businesses, and educational institutions. However, it remains easy and 
accessible enough for novice designers to get up-and-running quickly. It’s not unusual to see 
Dreamweaver utilized for personal projects or by small businesses and media professionals, such 
as photographers and painters, to maintain a web presence.

Dreamweaver’s workspace features
Dreamweaver’s workspace features
This book is dedicated to exploring, learning, and putting to use all that Dreamweaver has to 
offer. This section looks at some of the application’s key features.
Four different points of view: When you work with a document, Dreamweaver lets you 
see your work in one of four views: Code, Split, Design, or Live view. Dreamweaver’s default 
Design view lets you add elements to your page in a visual fashion, either by dragging objects 
onto the page from the Insert panel, or by directly adding text, image or multimedia content. 
More experienced web designers and coders can use the Code view to edit a document’s 
HTML code and scripts directly, enhanced with easy-to-read color-coding and visual aids. 
For those who like something in between, the Split view provides a split-pane Design and 
Code view all at once as seen in Figure 1-4. You can easily change views at any time with a 
single click in the Document toolbar. The Live view is a type of “reality check” that allows 
you to view your page in a native web browser, eliminating the need to leave the program in 
order to preview your designs.
Figure 1-4: The Split view lets you edit your page visually while also seeing the code being created behind the scenes.

Built-in FTP: You can easily upload and download files to and from your web server using 
the Files panel’s drag-and-drop interface. You can also use the Get/Put button at any time to 
post pages you’re currently working on. In either case, there’s no need for separate software. 
Dreamweaver also provides Check In/Check Out functionality and synchronization features; 
these allow multiple people to work more safely and efficiently on the same site.
Page and code object Insert panels: You can find intuitive icons for most common web 
page elements in a categorized Insert panel, from which you can add elements to your page 
with a single click. You can use additional panels to fine-tune any page element to ensure that 
you see exactly what you want. Included in the default Insert panel are tools for formatting 
text, building forms, and creating layouts. You can also customize a Favorites tab with your 
most-used icons.
Customizable workspace layouts: You can save combinations and positions of panels 
and toolbars for easy recall at any time. Save multiple workspace layouts for different users, 
or create different workspaces for specific tasks, such as coding or designing page layouts 
(Figure 1-5).
Figure 1-5: You can choose a specific workspace layout in order  
to create an arrangement of panels that suits you best.

Powerful visual aids: Take advantage of the precision you’re accustomed to in other 
design programs through Dreamweaver’s guides, rulers (Figure 1-6), measuring tools, and 
customizable positioning grid; many of these features are found and can be activated within 
the View menu. Dreamweaver’s Design-Time style sheets let you customize the look of your 
page exclusively for the editing process, making layout quicker and easier without permanently 
altering the page’s appearance.
Figure 1-6: Rulers, a document grid, and guides help you size and position page items with precision.
CSS Styles panel: Take advantage of the vast design and formatting options that CSS 
provides through Dreamweaver’s full-featured CSS Styles panel, which lets you create, edit, 
and manage styles on-the-fly from a single panel.

Lesson 1
The Assets Panel
Dreamweaver has an Assets Panel which can be accessed by clicking on the Assets tab or 
choosing Window > Assets. The Assets panel automatically catalogs different types of content 
and code from your site and allows you to easily locate and apply an asset by clicking and 
dragging or applying it. One example of how the Assets panel can be useful is colors. All colors 
that you use in a site are automatically listed in the Colors section, so if you would like to reuse 
a color that you have worked with previously it will automatically be available for you to apply.
Figure 1-7: The Colors section of the Assets panel allows you  
to see colors used in a site and apply them to other objects.
The Assets panel will allow you to access and reuse multiple types of content and code within 
your site (all of which you will learn more about throughout the book) including images, 
hyperlinks, Flash files, Shockwave movies, movie files, scripts, templates, and library items.
Live View and Live Code
Experience tells you that visual web editors often display differently than the browsers they’re 
emulating. As script-driven interactivity gains popularity, the need to accurately design the 
different states of your page (including menus, panels, and interface elements), has become 
increasingly important. The static nature of the Design view in Dreamweaver often times does 
not meet users’ advanced needs.

Lesson 1: Dreamweaver CS6 Jumpstart
Live View and Live Code
Dreamweaver’s Live View mode (Figure 1-8) uses the WebKit rendering engine (which is 
also the basis for the Safari and Google Chrome web browsers), to give you a more accurate 
preview of your page in the same way that a browser would render it.
Figure 1-8: Live View enables you to preview your page as if it were in a web browser.
When you are in the Live View mode, the Live Code feature is enabled. Live Code allows you to 
see, in real time, how visually changing your page affects the code behind the scenes. If you have 
added interactive elements such as drop-down menus or accordion panels, then you can visually 
select an item on the page and see how the HTML code might be affected. 
Also useful is the Freeze JavaScript button (or the F6 key). This feature freezes your page in a 
particular state (for example, with a menu locked open and a hover effect in place). You can then 
edit those interactive elements directly in Dreamweaver.
CSS Inspection and the Enable/Disable Feature
Another feature that is enabled when in Live View is the Inspect Mode. This mode allows 
users to peek at the visual model and structure of a page by hovering over elements on the page 
as seen in Figure 1-9. When hovering in Inspect Mode you can see the relationships between 
the HTML elements on your page and the styles assigned to them. This is useful because it 
dramatically shortens the time it takes to locate any given style for any given object on the 
page. However, when paired with the Enable/Disable feature, the Inspect Mode becomes even 
more powerful.
The Enable/Disable feature allows you to temporarily “turn off” an applied style on your page. 
This can be very useful when dealing with unfamiliar or complex designs where half the battle 
is simply understanding what styles are being used. Disabling a style will remove its properties

Lesson 1
so that you can visually observe the results. Keep in mind that disabling is always temporary, 
and that it is just as easy to restore the style by clicking Enable.
Figure 1-9: In the Inspect Mode, mousing over the elements in the Design view reveals the HTML and CSS code.
Related files
Web-based projects are becoming more complex than ever before, and you often find that 
even a single page is composed of a variety of assets. These assets can include Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS), external JavaScript files, and more. Dreamweaver CS6 has a feature that will 
help you become much more effective at designing and managing sites and applications with 
multiple assets.
The Related Files bar runs across the top of your document window, just below the document 
tabs as shown in Figure 1-10. The bar shows you all the various files that, when combined, 
create your finished page. You can switch between these files using the Related Files bar 
without losing the visual preview of their parent page. Design view (or Live View) always 
shows the parent file, but you can now edit any of the related files without losing their 
important visual context.

Code Navigator
Code Navigator
The Code Navigator (
) is a feature enabled in the Design view that appears when you hover 
over an element on the page. Clicking on the Navigator will let you see a quick summary of 
any CSS styles that have been applied (as seen in Figure 1-11), and if you choose to, you can 
click on the style in order to view the code directly. The benefit is that it is no longer necessary 
to manually hunt through your style sheets to find a specific rule; it’s just a click away in 
Dreamweaver.

Support for Content Management Systems 
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 1
Photoshop smart objects
Dreamweaver offers support for Photoshop smart objects, meaning you can drag a PSD 
file into a web page within Dreamweaver, optimize the image for the Web (as seen in 
Figure 1-12), and even resize it.
Figure 1-12: Inserting a native Photoshop file into Dreamweaver will trigger an automatic  
conversion into a suitable web graphic such as JPG, PNG, or GIF.
Also, if you decide to update the original PSD file at a later time, then a red arrow appears on 
the image in Dreamweaver to indicate that the source file has changed. You can then click the 
Update from Original button in the Property Inspector and a new version of the image will be 
created.
Support for Content Management Systems 
Enjoy authoring and testing support for content management systems like WordPress, Joomla! 
and Drupal. A CMS/blog software like WordPress provides users with an easy way to publish 
content online and has features such as automatic archiving and database integration. In the past, 
designers have been frustrated with creating the page designs for a CMS using Dreamweaver 
because these systems generally rely on a relatively complex combination of dynamic pages 
(often PHP) that could not be previewed in Dreamweaver. For designers or users who are not 
code-savvy, the complexity of these files can be daunting. Dreamweaver can now help you 
discover the related files needed to put together the pages in your CMS framework.
Dreamweaver does this by previewing the files of a CMS framework in the Design view (as 
long as you have a testing server defined), using the built-in Live View option. With this 
feature, Dreamweaver CS6 also lets you interact directly with a database, which means you can 
now test online forms, insert and modify database records, and more.

Subversion
HTML5, CSS3, and PHP code hinting
For advanced users, there is now built in code-hinting support for HTML5 and CSS3 syntax 
as seen in Figure 1-13. This means the “library” of HTML and CSS syntax that is now 
available within Dreamweaver is larger than ever, which is a good sign for those designers and 
developers who need to build modern web pages. 
Additionally, advanced users who use the scripting language PHP will be happy to learn that 
Dreamweaver CS6 now has improved support for PHP syntax. This includes code completion 
and syntax checking, as well as full support for all core functions, constants, and classes. PHP 
code hints have also been improved substantially.
 
Figure 1-13: Dreamweaver provides support for HTML5, CSS3, and PHP code-hinting.
HTML and CSS Starter Pages
HTML and CSS Starter Pages have been around in Dreamweaver for a few versions now. These 
pages allow you to get a jumpstart on building page layouts by choosing from a variety of pre-
built page layouts that you can subsequently modify. In Dreamweaver CS6, the code for these 
starter pages is new and improved for modern web browsers and comes with plenty of code 
commenting behind the scenes to help you start modifying your pages quickly. You can view 
starter pages by choosing File > New. The Layout column features a number of page layouts. 
CSS starter pages can also be found by clicking on the Page From Sample button.
Subversion
Dreamweaver has improved support for Subversion, a version control system similar to CVS 
and Visual SourceSafe (VSS). Subversion is typically used by companies to maintain a team 
environment on larger projects that require changes to be logged and versions to be controlled. 
Without Subversion, if you wanted to maintain versions, you would have to do the work yourself 
by maintaining folders and copies of previous versions. With Subversion, all files are kept on the 
Subversion server. Changes are tracked so that you can restore your project to any previous state. 
Subversion is enabled by choosing Site > New Site ( or Site > Manage Sites), choosing Version 
Control and then clicking the Access menu and choosing Subversion.

Lesson 1
Business Catalyst integration
Adobe’s Business Catalyst is an online service that provides a variety of features such as online 
store/shopping cart capabilities, e-mail marketing, web form functionality, analytics extension, 
and more. With the Business Catalyst extension in Dreamweaver you can log-in to Business 
Catalyst and synchronize multiple sites at once. Dreamweaver can be used to access and edit 
the style module used on your Business Catalyst connected sites. 
InContext Editing
InContext Editing is another feature of Business Catalyst that allows any user to make simple 
content changes within a web browser. To change a web page, users simply browse to the 
page, log in to the InContext Editing service, and edit the page. 
The creator of the page in Dreamweaver must specifically make the HTML page editable  by 
specifying regions on the page that users are allowed to edit. For example, you could select a 
table and then transform it into an InContext Editing editable region. When a user logs into 
the InContext Editing service, they can edit the content in the table directly in a browser.
• For more resources on getting started with InContext Editing in Dreamweaver see 
http://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/dreamweaver/incontextediting.html
The need for consistency in a website
It is important to be aware of the Dreamweaver features mentioned previously, but it is also 
important to take a step back and look at the big picture. More than any individual feature, 
Dreamweaver helps to add consistency to the website building process. To help understand 
this, consider the elements that virtually every website needs to be useful.
• Consistent Page Layout
When a visitor to a website navigates from page to page, there is an expectation that the layout 
remains the same. Of course there will be differences in appearance based on page content, but 
in general, aspects such as the height and width of columns should not change without reason. 
• Consistent navigation and user interface
Users also expect the behavior, appearance and functionality of a website to be consistent. For 
example, a navigation link to the “Contact” section that works on one page but not another is 
very disconcerting and frustrating to a user. Any interactive elements such as buttons, menus, 
or accordion panels should act as expected and have a consistent look.
• Consistent page color, text and link appearance
In a similar fashion to layout and navigation, users can be thrown off or distracted when 
they navigate from one page to another and elements such as font size and color are suddenly 
different.

Identifying your websites purpose, audience and audience needs
How Dreamweaver improves consistency
One of the main ways Dreamweaver can help prevent these issues is with the use of style sheets 
and, in particular, external style sheets. With an external style sheet you can define the rules 
for page layout (and other styles) in one single document. With proper use of a style sheet, the 
components of a page are defined in one central location and page layout, fonts, navigation and 
color all use a single set of style rules, thereby ensuring consistency.
There are other features within Dreamweaver that can help your sites become more consistent:
• Snippets, Library Items and Templates
Dreamweaver has three features that can help you reuse components within your site. Snippets 
are small sections of code that you may want to reuse from page to page such as a table or a 
copyright notice. Library Items are similar to Snippets in that they are reusable, but unlike 
Snippets (which once placed on a page have no connection to the original) Library Items that 
you place on a page maintain a relationship with the original, allowing you to update multiple 
instances with a single change. Templates take the concept of reusability to the ultimate level 
and allow you to link multiple pages to one single master.
• The Assets panel
All websites have a collection of items that are constantly reused, such as colors, images, and 
links. The Assets panel collects many of these items automatically for you for to reuse. For 
example, instead of having to define that you want to save a particular color, Dreamweaver 
automatically scans your site for hexadecimal color code and stores it for you. Other categories in 
the Assets panel include media files such as video and Flash, scripts, library items, and templates.
Identifying your websites purpose, audience and audience needs
When designing a website, an important question to ask is, “Why does this website need to exist?” It 
seems strange but a client might not be able to tell you exactly why they want a website. The answer, 
“Because everyone else has one,” is not a good enough answer.
Imagine a carpenter who is hired by a homeowner to build a “structure” in their backyard, with 
little information provided about the final project. The carpenter needs to know the purpose of the 
structure. Do they want a shed? A bandstand? A garage? Just as structures have different purposes, 
so do websites. As a designer you should be able to define, or have the client define, the goal of 
the website in a simple sentence. For example, in this book, you will be designing a site called 
OrganicUtopia, a store that sells organic fruits and vegetables and has the following goal:
Help current and potential customers learn why they should shop at OrganicUtopia and to promote a 
healthy lifestyle.
Although the designer may not have defined this objective, she can certainly contribute to the 
conversation. Here are some of the questions that might arise in discussing the functionality and 
design of such a site:
• Will the site be free? If yes, will there be advertising and is that something the designer needs 
to include in the layout?
• Is there a target audience in mind for the site and if so what is the typical occupation, sex, 
education, residence, race and computer literacy of this audience?
• What, if any, user interactions might there be on site. For example, can users submit recipes 
or simply browse existing ones?
In larger organizations, these conversations might also involve web developers, who would 
be responsible for any database functionality, along with the marketing department, the sales

department, and other interested stakeholders. Even if these discussions take place before you, the 
designer, are brought into the project, you will want to have a good understanding of the goals of a 
website before you start any design work.
Is your content relevant?
After defining the purpose of the site as well as the typical profile of a visitor, it is important to 
spend time thinking about, creating and organizing content. A web designer or developer is often 
more than just an “architect.” Just as an architect needs to have a sense of what are good materials 
and bad materials, so must the designer and developer have a sense of what makes content work on 
the Web.  You need to be able to communicate these concepts to a client. Here are some criteria for 
deciding whether content is relevant and/or appropriate for a website and its audience.
• Page content should serve a single specific purpose
When a user is on a page, they often know exactly what they are looking for. Whether they 
are reading an article, looking for a product, or trying to get in touch with you, your pages 
should contain content designed to serve a specific purpose
• Content must be helpful and of practical use
Too often, the creators of a website publish content without taking into consideration the 
context of the user and the format of the web. A good example of this is the press release. Press 
releases have been a standard tool for many years for distributing information about a new 
product or other notable aspects of a business. However, a press release is often not targeted 
toward customers but toward the media. (When is the last time you read a press release 
from beginning to end?) Consider the format you are delivering your content in. Are there 
hyperlinks to external sites? Could some or all the content be delivered as a chart, graph or 
even a video?
• Organize your content
It has been demonstrated that visitors to a website are more likely to scan a website rather 
than read every word. You can organize data by dividing it into chunks and using headings, 
subheadings, lists, tables, and images. 
• Sentence structure, grammar and typographical errors
If a visitor notices basic writing errors in content, they will be under the impression that you 
don’t care or not trustworthy. Evaluate if your sentences are clear and bring value to your 
message. Even reading copy out loud can uncover problems that can remain hidden onscreen. 
Many business websites have copywriters and proofreaders for a reason; you or your client may 
benefit from using a professional who can help shape your content.
Making Design and Development decisions
Understanding the features of Dreamweaver is one thing, but understanding the needs of 
your users and how that will affect the design and development of your website is another. 
Before you begin work on your site, you should take some time to consider how your end-
user’s requirements could affect the decisions you make. The following items are some of the 
variables you need to take into account when designing a website:
• Download Speed
Although the rise of broadband Internet connections has been steadily increasing across the 
world, you need to take into account the experience of users who may not have the fastest 
connections. Although desktop connections may be getting faster, keep in mind that the rise

of mobile web browsing means that the slower connection speed for mobile devices plays an 
important part. Many designers assign a limit on the total file size for an individual page. A 
conservative limit would be 100k per page; this excludes content that is high-bandwidth such 
as video.
• Screen Resolution
The number of screen sizes on the market is as wide as it has ever been, from small mobile 
screens (320 × 480 pixels) to large, high-resolution monitors (1920 × 1080 pixels and higher). 
Users are beginning to expect websites to function well at any size, and while there are 
technical solutions such as Dreamweaver’s Fluid Grid layout, it is important that you decide 
which screen sizes you would like to target and start from there.
• Support for JavaScript, plug-ins and multimedia
Many modern web pages have features that are dependent on JavaScript and/or browser 
plugins such as Flash. You need consider the possibility of what happens in the scenario where 
the user does not have these features. It will be different for every technology; for example 
JavaScript is enabled by default in the majority of web browsers, even so, you should consider 
the scenario in which it is turned off or not functioning. Can your site still function without 
it? Is there some sort of fallback? Consider the role of Flash, a browser plug-in. Flash and 
Flash video is supported in more than 95% of all desktop browsers, but in the mobile browser 
landscape it is not supported in iOS (iPhone and iPad). Therefore, your mobile audience will 
have a drastically different experience unless you have some sort of fallback in place.
Project Management
Whether you are a single person responsible for an entire site from design to launch or part of 
a larger team, you should have a sense of the stages involved in the creation of a website and 
how long these stages last. Web design doesn’t happen in a vacuum, there are usually clients 
involved and these clients have expectations. One way to define any project is to look at the 
following three variables; time, budget, and scope and think about how they are related.
• Time
Projects have deadlines, and for the sake of simplicity, let’s consider the final deadline to be 
defined as the public launch of a site. Of course, throughout the evolution of a website there 
might be other deadlines, such a deadline for final designs, a deadline for all content to be 
approved, a deadline for final site navigation, and more.
• Scope
Scope is not only the size of a website (measured in page count) but also the type of features 
that are included. “Scope creep” is a phenomenon that occurs in many projects in which 
new features are requested or sometimes emerge for various reasons. For example, a client 
might suddenly ask for a calendar feature on their website. Designers, developers, and project 
managers generally expect some level of scope creep on a project and try to manage it as best as 
possible.
• Budget
Money and resources are an unavoidable part of the equation. No client has an unlimited 
budget; and expectations on the size and scope of a project are often related to the budget on 
hand.
As you may have guessed, these three variables are interconnected. For example, if the 
deadline for the launch of a site is fixed and a new feature is requested at the last minute, then 
we can imagine two scenarios: 1.) The budget needs to increase (because now those designers

are working 12 hours a day until launch time to get things done!) 2.) If the budget is fixed (as 
well as the deadline) then the scope has to decrease, perhaps a certain feature is dropped and 
the time that is now freed-up is applied to the new calendar feature.
The role of “deliverables”
The term “deliverables” is one that every web designer and developer should be familiar 
with. In general, deliverables are all the assets that you agree to create and hand over to 
your client (or another part of a team). Deliverables will include the final website, but 
often include other documentation or material in the earlier stages of a project. Examples 
of deliverables might include a site map, wireframes, a flow diagram, mockups, and a 
specification document describing one or more pages on a site. Although deliverables are 
more commonly associated with larger projects with multiple members on a team, they 
could easily be associated with a smaller project. For example, a solo web designer might 
create a simple one page website for a client. In addition to delivering and building the 
site, one of the deliverables would include a text document that includes the web hosting 
information (e.g., user name and password) as well as instructions that would allow the 
client to be able to update the site on their own. Defining deliverables is a crucial step at 
the beginning of a project, and is designed to ensure that everyone involved has a single 
point of reference to rely on.
Project Phases
There will obviously be differences between small projects and large-scale ones, but there are 
still some commonalities worth discussing:
• Defining a project plan
Projects that are delivered on-time, on-budget and with all the requested features usually 
have had a solid project plan in place. A project plan might include clearly assigning tasks and 
responsibilities to various members of a team, assigning due dates and allocating resources 
(such as making sure machines are available for browser testing). In larger organizations, this 
role might fall upon a single person (appropriately known as a “project manager”). In smaller 
organizations, this role might also be the designer or another member of the team. 
• Planning and analysis
All websites should have a reason for existing and serve the needs for one or more sets of users. 
The creator of a site should have a very good sense of this before moving further. Try to define 
the goal of a website in a single sentence, you may find this harder than you expect! Research 
and analysis into the needs of users is also crucial at this stage. Looking at any competing or 
similar websites is a natural and helpful thing to do, however be cautious of defining a goal 
that is not truly yours (or your clients’).
• Designing
Designing a site does not mean opening Dreamweaver and beginning to create your pages. 
Typically, you might start the design process with a sketch. It is fast and easy to present a sketch 
to a client or team member and receive feedback which will help the design of the site evolve. 
Mockups are another tool to consider, a mockup might be a single page done in a program 
such as Photoshop, and attempts to convey color, type, and layout without moving into the 
realm of HTML and CSS yet.

Flowcharts, storyboards and wireframes
• Building
The main subject of this book, the building of a site, involves organizing all the available 
content such as text and images into HTML (or a scripting language such as PHP), CSS and 
perhaps JavaScript. Additionally, a logical and usable navigation system (often referred to as 
information architecture) is needed.
• Testing
All sites should undergo a testing process before launch. Again, the amount of testing will 
vary depending on the scope of the project. Common tests include: checking a site for broken 
hyperlinks or images, checking page appearance on multiple browsers and platforms, checking 
for accessibility and readability. (There is also usability testing, which is best done toward the 
beginning or middle of a site’s development cycle, not the end. Usability testing is a separate 
process that involves gathering feedback from unique users in order to help identify problems 
with site features or site goals).
• Site launching and maintenance
Site deployment (or “launching”) is the final step and involves transferring site documents 
from a local or network system to a final destination or URL. Care must be taken here not 
to break site functionality or appearance during this transfer process. This can happen by 
forgetting assets such as style sheets, images or any other necessary document.
Flowcharts, storyboards and wireframes
There are important stages in the design process you should complete before writing a single 
line of HTML or CSS. If you begin designing visuals or building pages before you are 
prepared, you may end up discarding your original work. By using flowcharts, storyboards, 
and wireframes you can explore different design options and functionality quickly (and 
therefore less costly). Whether or not you use all three models generally depends on the size 
of the project. Larger projects that incorporate complicated elements, such as connection to a 
database, or use multiple features, will benefit from using all three models.
Flowcharts
Flowcharts provide a visual overview of how your website is organized. A flowchart does 
not attempt to document every single page in a site, it is more concerned with illustrating 
the primary navigation within a site as well as the relationships of pages. The term primary 
navigation relates to the hierarchy of a site. Hierarchy can be defined as the level of importance 
you assign to specific pages. For example, if you define the home page as the most important 
page, what is the second most important page? Or are there multiple pages with equal 
importance? This process of defining the hierarchy of pages as well the navigation of a site is 
often referred to as information architecture. 
Flowcharts quickly and easily communicate the structure of a site to clients or other members 
on your team. Visually, you create a flowchart by creating boxes that represent pages (or 
collections of pages) and visually linking them together with lines. Depending on the size of 
your project, a flowchart could be as simple as a sketch on a notepad, or created in a program 
such as Visio or even Adobe Illustrator or InDesign.

Lesson 1
Storyboards
Flowcharts abstractly illustrate a site’s hierarchy and navigation, but say nothing about the 
content on the pages. Storyboards help you focus on the content on a page as well as provide 
a way to fine-tune your navigation and site structure. A storyboard consists of multiple pages 
based on those defined in the flowchart. Each storyboard is then filled out with navigation, 
a list of related links, a functional description of the page, images, text and some notes on 
content for that page. Although the storyboard is focusing on content it is not focused on 
design or page layout, this is traditionally the role of the wireframe discussed next.
A storyboard could be created by hand as a sketch or diagram, but is more often done digitally. 
Many people will choose to use Dreamweaver to create very basic HTML pages that function 
as storyboards although you could also use other applications such as Illustrator or InDesign.
Wireframes
The goal of a wireframe is to take you one step closer to your HTML and CSS designs 
but without committing to design decisions such as images, colors, and fonts. Wireframes 
are typically created in black and white or shades of gray, using placeholders. At this stage, 
organization of the content and the features of the site are still a priority, the goal is to allow 
time for feedback from clients or other members involved with the project. It is still easy to add 
or remove features to a site at this stage and much less expensive than when the site is in the 
process of being built!
Programs such as Adobe Fireworks allow you to quickly build interactive wireframes using 
a set of standard text and image placeholders as well as other common elements such as form 
controls, buttons, or video players.  
Testing your website’s hierarchy 
At the wireframe stage, it is possible that your original flowchart needs to be updated due to 
changes you discovered along the way. It is also possible that you may have strayed from your 
original hierarchy, perhaps by dropping or modifying elements in your navigation bar or 
other changes. You can always compare the flowchart to the wireframe and make sure pages 
are reflected but another way to determine if the planned hierarchy is being followed is by 
adding an element of interactivity. For example, by making working links in your navigation 
menus, you can confirm that your site navigation is logical and that a user can reach all pages 
from any other page or that no page becomes “orphaned.” An orphaned page is a document 
that exists in your website but has no incoming links. At any point in the site-building process 
Dreamweaver can check for orphan pages by checking a site for broken links.
Take Note...
Checking a site for broken links is covered in Lesson 16 “Managing your Website: Reports, 
Optimization, and Maintenance.”

How websites work
How websites work
Before embarking on the task of building web pages (and in turn, a website), it’s a good idea 
to know the basics of how websites work, how your users view them, and what you need to 
know to make sure your website functions and looks its best.
A simple flow chart
What happens when you type in a website address? Most people don’t even think about it—
they just type in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and the website appears. They most 
likely don’t realize how many things are going on behind the scenes to make sure that pages 
gets delivered to their computer so that they can do their shopping, check their e-mail, or 
research a project.
http://www.yoursite.com/
User Machine (client)
Web Host (server)
When you type a URL or IP address in the address bar of a web browser, you are connecting 
to a remote computer (called a server), and downloading the documents, images, and resources 
necessary to render the pages you will view while on the site. Web pages aren’t delivered as a 
finished product; your web browser is responsible for reconstructing and formatting the pages 
based on the HTML code included within the pages. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 
is a simple, tag-based language that instructs your browser how and where to insert and format 
pictures, text, and media files. Web pages are written in HTML, and Dreamweaver builds the 
HTML as you construct your page in the Design view.
An Internet Service Provider (ISP) enables you to connect to the Internet. Some well-
known ISPs include Verizon, Comcast, and EarthLink. You view web pages over an Internet 
connection using a browser, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Safari. A browser can 
decipher and display web pages and their content, including images, text, and video.
Domain names and IP addresses
When you type in a website address, you usually enter the website’s domain name (such as 
Wiley.com). The website owner purchased this domain name and uses it to mask an IP address, 
which is a numerical address used to locate and dial up the pages and files associated with a 
specific website. 
So how does the Web know what domains match up with what IP address, and in turn, 
with what websites? It uses a Domain Name Service (DNS) server, which makes connections 
between domain names and IP addresses.

An introduction to HTML
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
22
Lesson 1
Servers and web hosts
A DNS server is responsible for matching a domain name with its companion IP address. 
Think of the DNS server as the operator at a phone company who connects calls through 
a massive switchboard. DNS servers are typically maintained by either the web host or the 
registrar from which the domain was purchased. Once the match is made, the request from 
your user is routed to the appropriate server and folder where your website resides. When 
the request reaches the correct account, the server then directs it to the first page of the 
website, which is typically named index.html, default.html, or whatever the server is set up to 
recognize as a default starting page.
A server is a machine very much like your desktop computer, but it’s capable of handling traffic 
from thousands of users (often at the same time!), and it maintains a constant connection to 
the Internet so that your website is available 24 hours a day. Servers are typically maintained 
by a web host. Web hosts are companies that charge a fee to host and serve your website to 
the public. A single server can sometimes host hundreds of websites. Web hosting services are 
available from a variety of providers, including well-known Internet service companies such as 
Yahoo!, and other large, dedicated hosting companies. It is also common for a large company to 
maintain its own servers and websites on its premises. 
The role of web browsers
A web browser is an application that downloads and displays HTML pages. Every time you 
request a page by clicking a link or typing in a website address you are requesting an HTML 
page and any files that it includes. The browser’s job is to reconstruct and display that page 
based on the instructions in the HTML code, which guides the layout and formatting of 
the text, images, and other assets used within the page. The HTML code works like a set of 
assembly instructions for the browser to use.
An introduction to HTML
HTML is what makes the Web work; web pages are built using HTML code, which in turn is 
read and used by your web browser to lay out and format text, images, and video on the page. 
As you design and lay out web pages in Design view, Dreamweaver writes the code behind the 
scenes that is necessary to display and format your page in a web browser.
Contrary to what you may think, HTML is not a programming language, but rather a simple 
text-based markup language. A markup language is a system for annotating (marking up) 
a document in syntax that is different than the plain text. HTML uses tags, or bracketed 
keywords, in order to format page content such as text or images. An example of a tag would 
be <p> which is the paragraph tag. Many tags also require a closing tag, which is the keyword 
preceded by a forward slash (/), for example </p>. HTML is not proprietary to Dreamweaver—
you can create and edit HTML in any text editor, even in simple applications such as Windows 
Notepad and Mac OS X’s TextEdit. Dreamweaver’s job is to give you a visual way to create web 
pages without having to code by hand. If you like to work with code, however, Dreamweaver’s 
Code view is a fully featured text editor with color-coding and formatting tools that make it 
easier to write and read HTML and other languages.
XHTML 1.0 Transitional
The language of HTML has continued to evolve over the years and there are a few different 
page types currently in use. Unless you specifically change it, the default page type that 
Dreamweaver creates is named XHTML 1.0 Transitional. To keep things simple for now, 
think of XHTML (which was introduced around the year 2000), as a stricter version of the 
www.allitebooks.com

Lesson 1
23
Lesson 1: Dreamweaver CS6 Jumpstart
An introduction to HTML
HTML language that was used to build the first web pages in the 1990s, when the Web was 
first created (for now, we’ll refer to this as HTML 4.0, although the technical details are a bit 
more complicated). XHTML was designed to make web pages more compatible with newer 
platforms, such as mobile phones and handheld devices. XHTML combines elements of 
HTML and XML, a language used to describe data. XML, or Extensible Markup Language, 
has become a popular method of exchanging information among seemingly unrelated 
applications, platforms, and systems.
What’s the difference?
The difference between HTML 4.0 and XHTML is not terribly dramatic. The structure of the 
language changes somewhat with XHTML in that it becomes stricter. Whereas HTML 4.0 
was very forgiving of coding practices such as overlapping or unclosed tags, XHTML requires 
that all tags be closed and properly nested. HTML 4.0 doesn’t care which case you use when 
constructing tags, but in XHTML, all tags must be lowercase. 
Here’s an example of how HTML and XHTML might differ. The break element is used to 
push or “break” content to the next line on a page. In HTML, you can do this by simply 
adding the opening tag <br>. In XHTML, all opening tags must also have a closing tag. The 
long way to do this would be <br></br>. However, there is special syntax in XHTML that 
lets you get away with less code, and this syntax is called self-closing. You can write tags to 
self-close by using a forward slash—making sure there is a space between the br and the forward 
slash—and then closing the bracket like so:
<br />
The result is a well-formed language that takes advantage of newer browsers and device 
platforms, while remaining compatible with older browsers. As noted previously, working 
with XHTML in Dreamweaver requires nothing more than creating a new page.
What about HTML5?
In 2004, a group of representatives from browser manufacturers, such as Opera, Mozilla, 
and Apple, and a group of working web developers formed an independent group 
called the WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). 
Their mission was to create a better HTML markup specification, designed to build the 
new type of web application without breaking backwards compatibility with existing 
browsers. 
The term “HTML5” has grown to cover a number of developing web technologies such 
as CSS3, JavaScript as well as a number of related technologies such as Geolocation, 
Canvas, and Offline Storage. The use of HTML5 for mobile applications and websites 
has become particularly popular, since for many websites the ability to present 
multimedia can best be accomplished with the HTML5 <video> and <audio> tags. 
In fact HTML5 markup introduces several new tags designed to make the structure of 
a web page more logical. The most important of these new elements include <footer>, 
<nav>, <section>, <aside>, and <article> as well as other new elements that play 
a less important role such as <hgroup> and <wbr>. These new tags are aimed at making 
page layout more organized, standardized, and efficient for designers and developers.

Tags can also accept CSS rules that specify additional information for how the tag should 
display the content. CSS rules may have one or more properties, such as size, color, or 
alignment. Take a look at the line that reads: This text will appear inside of its own paragraph. 
This line is enclosed in a p (paragraph) tag, which separates it from the other text by a line 
above and below. You can add a CSS class rule to this to align the text.

The structure of an HTML document
In HTML a pair of tags is referred to as an “element.” For example, in the last exercise 
you created a style for one of the paragraph elements on the page. HTML elements define 
the structure of a page as well as the content hierarchy (importance) and examples include 
headings, lists, images, tables, formatting such as the strong, small, and em tags and even the 
HTML documents themselves. The HTML element is the most fundamental element you will 
use. It is used to specify the beginning and end of HTML in a document:
<html></html>
The HTML element consists of two tags that contain two key sections of your web page: the 
head and the body. The head element of your page contains items that are not visible to your 
user, but are important nonetheless. Search engine keywords, page descriptions, and links to 
outside scripts or style sheets are all found in the head element. You create the head of the 
document inside the HTML tags using the <head> tags:
<html>
<head></head>
</html>

Lesson 1: Dreamweaver CS6 Jumpstart
An introduction to HTML
The body of your page is where all the visible elements of your page are contained. This is 
where you insert text, images, and other media. You define the body of the page using the 
<body> element:
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
My text and pictures go here...
</body>
</html>
Whenever you create a new HTML document in Dreamweaver, this structure is created 
automatically before you add anything to the page. Any visual elements you add to the page 
are added, using the appropriate HTML code inside the <body> element.
Placing images in HTML
You use some elements in HTML to place items, such as pictures or media files, inside a web 
page. The <img> element is the most common example; its job is to place and format an image 
on the page. To place an image and see the resulting code, follow these steps:

viewing both the layout and the code for your page. In the Design view portion of the 
Split view, click below the line of text to place your cursor underneath it. This is where 
you’ll place a new image.

Take Note...
The Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box appears when you add images to provide 
additional information for users with special needs (such as the visually impaired). You should 
always provide each image with alternate text, but you can disable this panel by choosing 
Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver > Preferences (Mac OS). In the Accessibility 
category, uncheck the Images option.

5.	 The code shows that the HTML <img> element has been used to place the image. Click 
once on the image in the document window to select it. The Property Inspector at the 
bottom of the page displays and sets the properties for the image.
6.	 Choose File > Save to save your work, then choose File > Close.
Note that in HTML, images and media are not embedded, but placed. This means that the 
elements contain additional information known as attributes, and values that point to the 
location of an image file, and may even contain other information such as the width and 
height values.
Colors in HTML
In Dreamweaver’s various panels and in your code, each color is referred to by a six-character 
code preceded by a pound sign. This code is called the hexadecimal code, and it is the system 
that HTML pages use to identify and use colors. You can reproduce almost any color using 
a unique hexadecimal code. For example, a lime green hexadecimal color is #9F3 as seen in 
Figure 1-20.
The first, middle, and last two digits of the hexadecimal code correspond to values in the 
RGB spectrum. For instance, white, which is represented in RGB as R:255 G:255 B:255, is 
represented in HTML as #FFFFFF (255|255|255). Choosing colors is easy, thanks to a handy 
Swatches panel, which you can find in many places throughout the work area. 
Figure 1-20: The Swatches panel makes it easy to work with colors.
Take Note...
The color pickers in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator also display and accept hexadecimal 
codes, making it easy to copy and paste colors between these applications and Dreamweaver.

Lesson 1
Case sensitivity and whitespace rules
HTML is a flexible language that has very few rules regarding its own appearance. Based 
on how strictly you want to write it, HTML can be either very specific about whether tags 
are written in upper- or lowercase (called case sensitivity), or not specific at all. To see how 
HTML treats whitespace, follow these steps.
Follow these steps to see how HTML treats whitespace
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose File > Open. When the Open dialog box appears, navigate to the dw01lessons 
folder. Select the Whitespace.html file, and then press Open. 
2.	 If your file is not in Split view, press the Split button in the Document toolbar at the top 
of the page, so that you can view both the layout and the code as seen in Figure 1-21. The 
first three paragraphs have different amounts of space between them in the HTML but will 
be rendered on the page one after the other.
Figure 1-21: The browser ignores any whitespace between the paragraphs.
This tells you that whitespace and line returns are ignored by the browser. You have to 
begin making a distinction between code that is readable by humans versus the way a web 
browser interprets and renders code.

3.	 You will see there are a few different ways to format your text. In the Design view, 
click once after the sentence that reads, This is one sentence, and then press Shift+Enter 
(Windows) or Shift+Return (Mac OS) twice. This creates two line returns—you can see 
that each line return is created in your code by a <br> (break) tag as seen in Figure 1-22. 
When rendered in the browser, the <br> tag adds blank lines between the sentences; 
however the sentences are technically within the same paragraph. This is sometimes 
referred to as a hard return. This method is actually not the ideal way to add new lines on 
your page, although it does occasionally come in handy.
Figure 1-22: To create a line return, hold down the Shift key while pressing the Enter or Return key.
4.	 To create a new paragraph, position your cursor before the phrase This is another, and press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The text is separated by a line above and below, 
and is wrapped inside a set of <p> (paragraph) tags. This is the preferred method of adding 
paragraphs.
Take Note...
Other than a standard single space (such as the space used between words), several consecutive 
spaces created by the spacebar are ignored and are displayed as only one space in Design view 
and in a browser.

Lesson 1
 File name restrictions and conventions
Although HTML is very flexible, there are a few things to pay attention to. The following 
is a list of file naming restrictions (issues which may cause errors) and conventions (standard 
practice for designers and developers):
• Forbidden Characters
When you save your HTML files, stay away from using any of the following characters as they 
may cause problems in your file directory or when loading in a web browser: *&^%$#@!
• Filename extensions
The most common filename extension for files containing HTML is .html. A common 
abbreviation of this is .htm, which originated because some early operating systems and file 
systems limited file extensions to three letters. You can use either extension interchangeably 
these days.
• Avoid whitespace in file names
In the early days of the web, using HTML documents that had a space in the file name such 
as “about us.html” could cause errors on certain web servers resulting in the page not loading 
or other problems. This issue has largely been solved and web servers generally replace spaces 
with the characters %20. However, to be safe it is highly recommended that you avoid spaces 
in your file name. For readability you can use a dash or an underscore instead of a space such as 
“about_us.html” or “about-us.html”.
• Avoid the forward slash “/” and the back slash “\” 
Using either the forward or back slash in your file names (such as “2/6/2012.html” could 
potentially cause problems on a web server or could be misinterpreted as a path to a directory 
by the browser, server, or user.
• Be consistent with upper or lowercase when naming files
Many designers and developers have settled on using all lowercase for their file 
names (for example “contact.html” not “Contact.html” or “CONTACT.html”. 
One reason for this that on certain servers directory and file names are case sensitive 
so this address: http://www.mysite.com/myGreatSite.html is not considered the same as 
http://www.mysite.com/mygreatsite.html. If you decide on a convention of consistently using 
lowercase, you can avoid the problem of creating errors with mixed case file names. Lowercase 
also has the benefit of being more readable, especially when compared to all uppercase.
• Using “index.html” vs. “default.html”
The file names “index.html” and “default.html” are used as the default file loaded by a web 
browser when it is sent to a directory (most familiarly as the home page of a website). The 
“index.html” convention has generally become the standard, although “default.html” will 
likely work on most servers.

Lesson 1: Dreamweaver CS6 Jumpstart
An introduction to HTML
Element hierarchy
HTML elements should have a well-formed hierarchy or nesting structure in order to make 
sure that everything displays as it should. The element at the top of the hierarchy is the <html> 
element, and every other element you create is contained within it. Elements such as the <body> 
end up nesting all the other elements on a page, such as the <p> (paragraph), <img> (image), 
and <strong> (bold) elements. In addition, structural elements (such as those that create divs, 
paragraphs, lists, and tables) hold more weight than formatting tags such as <strong> (bold) and 
<em> (italic). Take this line of code, for example:
<strong><p>Big bold paragraph</p></strong>
Although code such as this may work in certain browsers, it isn’t structured well because the 
<strong> tag technically holds less weight than the <p> tag. The following code represents a 
better way to include the bold type:
<p><strong>Big bold paragraph</strong></p>
Dreamweaver generally does a great job of keeping tags properly nested or contained within 
each other. When you choose to manipulate the code by hand, you should always keep good 
coding techniques in mind.
Explorations in code
Although this book occasionally refers to the code for examples, hand-coding is not a primary 
goal of these lessons. The best way to learn how code represents the layouts you are building 
visually is to switch to the Code view and explore what’s happening behind the scenes.
It’s important to remember that every button, panel, and menu in Dreamweaver represents 
some type of HTML tag, attribute, or value; very rarely will you learn something that is 
unrelated or proprietary to Dreamweaver alone. Think of the Dreamweaver workspace as a 
pretty face on the HTML language.

A look at the Welcome Screen
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 1
A look at the Welcome Screen
A common fixture in most CS6 applications is the Welcome Screen, which is a launching 
pad for new and recent documents. In Dreamweaver, the Welcome Screen appears when 
the application launches or when no documents are open as seen in Figure 1-23. From the 
Welcome Screen, you can create new pages, create a new site, open a recent document, or use 
one of Dreamweaver’s many starter pages or layouts.
Figure 1-23: The Welcome Screen appears when you launch the application, or when no documents are open.
Here’s what you’ll find on the Welcome Screen:
Open a Recent Item: A list of the last few documents you worked on appears in the far left 
column, or you can browse to open a different file using the Open button at the bottom.
Create New: In addition to HTML pages, you can choose from a variety of new document 
formats, such as CSS, JavaScript, and XML. Dreamweaver is not just a web page-building tool, 
but also a superior text editor, making it ideal for creating many non-HTML files. You can 
also define a new Dreamweaver site using the link at the bottom, or choose the More folder for 
even more new file options.
Top Features (videos): On the far right side of the Welcome Screen, there is a column that 
contains link to videos of Top Features. These videos explore some of the new top features of 
Dreamweaver CS6, including Fluid Grid Layouts, Business Catalyst, and the CSS Transitions 
panel among others. The videos are located on Adobe’s website, adobe.com, and when you click 
on one, Dreamweaver launches the site in your web browser to give you access to the video.

Creating, opening, and saving documents
Creating, opening, and saving documents
The lessons throughout this book require that you create, save, and open existing files. You 
can accomplish most file-related tasks from the File menu at the top, or from the Welcome 
Screen that appears when you launch Dreamweaver.
Creating new documents
Dreamweaver creates text files most commonly in the form of HTML files (or web pages). It 
can also create files in a variety of text-based languages, including CSS, XML, JavaScript, and 
even Flash ActionScript. 
You can create blank files that you build from the ground up, or you can get started with 
a variety of layout templates and themes as seen below in Figure 1-24. You can create new 
documents from the File menu or from the Welcome Screen. Here, you’ll create a new page 
using the File menu.
Figure 1-24: The New Document dialog box gives you a choice of new files in a variety of formats and templates.
Follow these steps to create a new document
Step-by-Step
1.	 To create a new document, choose File > New. The New Document dialog box appears. 
2.	 Select Blank Page and under the Page Type column, choose HTML. Under Layout, 
choose <none> to start a new blank document. Leave the DocType drop-down menu at 
its default. Press Create.
3.	 Choose File > Save or File > Save As to start the process of saving your document.
4.	 When prompted, choose a location for your file and assign it a name. Note that you must 
save HTML files with an .html extension, or they will not be interpreted properly in a 
browser. This rule applies for files of any type (such as .xml, .css, and .cfm).
Opening a recently opened document
To open a document you’ve worked on recently, Choose File > Open Recent or, from 
the Welcome Screen, select a document under the Open a Recent Item column.

and access will be needed to make updates to the site, such as adding new pages. 
Your task requires that you understand how to set up site management, connect to a

Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw02lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Creating a new site
In Dreamweaver, the term site refers to the local and remote storage locations where the files 
that make up a website are stored. A site can also include a testing server location for processing 
dynamic pages. To take full advantage of Dreamweaver’s features, you should always start by 
creating a site. In Dreamweaver CS6, there is a new category called a Business Catalyst Site. 
Business Catalyst is a service that Adobe provides (for a fee) that allows you to connect your

website with analytic software and other features. However, we do not cover setup of Business 
Catalyst sites in this book.
The easiest way to create a standard new site in Dreamweaver is to use the Site Setup dialog 
box. One way to access this dialog box is by choosing Site > New Site from the menu bar.
Take Note...
You can also use the Manage Sites dialog box to create a new site. This and other functions 
of the Manage Sites dialog box are discussed later in this book.
In this lesson, you begin by using the Site Setup dialog box to accomplish the following tasks:
• Define the site
• Name the site
• Define the local root folder
• Set up a remote folder
• Explore advanced settings
• Save the site
By default, the Site Setup dialog box opens with the Site Settings available. The options 
available here will help guide you through the essentials of defining your site. The Servers, 
Version Control, and Advanced Settings options allow you to set up local, remote, and testing 
servers directly.
Follow these steps to set up a new server
Step-by-Step
1.	 Launch Dreamweaver CS6, if it is not already open, then choose Site > New Site. First, 
you have to name the site. In the Site Name text field, type Organic Utopia as seen in 
Figure 2-1.
Figure 2-1: Type the Site Name into the text field.

Lesson 2
43
Lesson 2: Setting Up a New Site 
Creating a new site
Next, you need to set up a local root folder, which is where Dreamweaver stores the files 
with which you’re currently working. The Local Site Folder field allows you to enter 
information regarding where you’ll be working with your files during development.
Take Note...
To ensure that the links you set up on your computer will work when you upload the site to a 
web server, it is essential that you store all the site’s resources in one main folder on your hard 
drive, then identify it within Dreamweaver. This is because the links will only work properly 
if all the site’s elements remain in the same relative location on the web server as with your 
hard drive.
2.	 Click on the Folder icon (
) to the right of the Local Site Folder text field to navigate to 
any pre-existing files. In the next step, you will locate the lesson files we have provided for 
this chapter.
If you did not click on this folder and click Save, Dreamweaver would simply create a new 
folder on your system where you could begin to create new pages in your site. In this case, 
you will be pointing to a pre-existing folder that already has files within it.
It is important to distinguish between adding a new site (which is what you are doing

Dreamweaver knows where this folder is on your system. This folder is known as the 
root folder and will always contain the content that will eventually be your website.
3.	 Navigate to your desktop and locate the dw02lessons folder you copied to your desktop 
earlier.
4.	 Select the dw02lessons folder. On the Windows platform, click Open to open this folder, 
then press Select (Windows). On the Mac OS platform, press Choose to choose this as 
your local root folder. The field now shows the path to your newly defined local root 
folder. 
At this point, you have done the minimum amount of steps required to begin working on 
a site, however you will take a look now at some of the optional features within the Site 
Setup process.
5.	 Click on the Servers tab. This section allows you to define the remote server where your 
website will end up being hosted. Take a moment to read the heading in the dialog box. 
Note that it says you do not need to fill in this information to begin creating a website. It 
is only necessary if you are connecting to the Web.
You are not connecting to the Web in this lesson, but you should take a look at the screen 
anyway to understand the information needed.

6.	 Click on the + button and the Basic site settings window appears as seen in Figure 2-2. 
Here there are fields for Server Name, Connect Using, FTP Address, Username and 
Password, along with other options. These settings allow you to choose both a destination 
and a method (FTP being the most common) for Dreamweaver to use to transfer files.
Figure 2-2: Set up access to your remote folder.
As noted earlier, this is an optional step, and you do not have to define your 
remote folder at this stage. Dreamweaver allows you to define your remote folder at a 
later time, such as when you’re ready to upload.
7.	 Click on the Advanced tab. Click on the Server Model menu in the Testing Server section. 
Here there are choices for different scripting languages such as PHP and ASP pages. If you 
are an advanced user, this is where you would set up the connections to your testing server.
Again, you won’t be making any changes here, so press Cancel.

8.	 Click on the Version Control option on the left to access Subversion settings. Subversion, 
a VCS (or version control system), keeps track of changes made to files, enabling users to 
track changes and return to previous versions of any file. For this exercise, make sure the 
Access pull-down in this window is set to None, as you won’t be using Subversion.
You’ve now completed the site setup process, using basic settings. Don’t close the Site 
Setup dialog box yet, though, as you’ll now explore the options found under the Advanced 
Settings option.
Version Control
Subversion is a system that requires a dedicated installation on a server. Once a Subversion 
SVN repository is installed, it allows multiple users to work with files in a powerful way. 
An example of a problem that Subversion solves is when two or more people on a team 
happen to be working on the same file. The Subversion system can prevent a file from 
being overwritten accidentally. Multiple versions of the same file are always saved and can 
even be compared and merged as needed. Additional features of Subversion include the 
ability to synchronize changes of files as well as the ability for a user to hide a file with 
File Cloaking, thereby preventing others from accessing it until ready.
Advanced site-creation options
Chances are if you are new to Dreamweaver or web design you won’t need these advanced 
settings. If you are in this category, press Save and skip to the Adding Pages section. Other

Lesson 2
The information you set in the Local Info window identifies your Default Images folder, 
what your links are relative to, and a web URL to be used if you don’t have a remote 
server defined. One of the more important Local Info settings, though, is case-sensitive 
link checking.
The case-sensitive link checking feature ensures that your links will work on a Unix server, 
where links are case-sensitive. If you’re using a Windows or Mac OS server, this doesn’t 
matter as much, but it is a good idea to follow the strict naming and linking conventions of 
a Unix system in case you ever move your site to a different server.
Take Note...
A web server delivers web pages on the request of a client (such as a browser) using HTTP. 
There are different operating systems on web servers just as there are different operating 
systems on the desktop. In rare instances, these differences can affect the way your site works 
and this is why Dreamweaver provides options such as case-sensitive link checking.
If you happen to have already defined a CSS3 site-wide Media Query file, this is where 
you could redefine or modify it. (We cover the creation of site-wide Media Query files in 
Lesson 15, “Mobile Design and Layout.”)
The remaining categories to the left of the Advanced tab of the Site Setup dialog box help 
to define your site’s production, collaboration, and deployment capabilities. They include 
the following:
Cloaking allows you to specify file types or specific files that you do not want uploaded 
to the server.
Design Notes is a collaboration tool that keeps notes regarding the development of the 
page or site. 
File View Columns is an organizational tool. If you want to share the custom columns 
with others, you must enable Design Notes as well. 
Contribute is a separate application that enables users with basic word processing and web 
browser skills and little or no HTML knowledge to create and maintain web pages.
Templates can be automatically updated with rewritten document paths using this 
option.
Spry is a JavaScript library for web designers. It allows designers to build pages that 
provide a richer experience for their users.
Web Fonts allows you to define where you are storing the web fonts you would like to 
use for this site.
3.	 At this point, you are finished defining your settings, so press Save. Dreamweaver creates a 
site with the settings you have defined. 
You are now ready to work with pages for your defined website and take advantage of 
Dreamweaver’s site features.

Adding pages
Adding pages
Dreamweaver contains many features to assist you in building pages for your site. For example, 
you can define properties for pages, including titles, background colors or images, as well as 
default text and link colors.
The first step for creating a new page correctly was taken when you defined the site in the last 
exercise. By defining the root folder, Dreamweaver will always create new pages in your site 
automatically. These pages are now visible in the Files Panel in the lower right of your screen 
as seen here in Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-4: The Files panel.

Lesson 2
1.	 Choose File > New. The New Document dialog box opens as seen in Figure 2-5.
Figure 2-5: Use the New Document dialog box to add a page to your site.
2.	 You can create a new page using a predesigned layout, or start with a blank page and build 
a layout of your own. In this exercise, you’ll start with a blank page and in later lessons, 
you will get a chance to explore some of the other options. Click on the Blank Page 
category on the left side of the New Document dialog box.
3.	 In the Page Type column, you can select the type of page you want to create (for example, 
HTML, ColdFusion, and so on). Select HTML if it is not currently selected.
In the Layout column, you can choose to base your page on a prebuilt design. These 
predesigned layouts fall into one of three categories:
Fixed creates a layout with columns that do not resize based on the user’s browser settings. 
They are measured in pixels.
Liquid creates a layout with columns that resize if the user resizes the browser window, 
but not if the user changes the text settings.
HTML5 creates a fixed layout that uses the new HTML5 elements such as <header>, 
<section> and <article> among others.

4.	 Click on <none> in the Layout column to build the page without using a prebuilt layout.
5.	 Click on the DocType menu in the lower-right corner. This DocType drop-down menu 
(seen in Figure 2-6) defines the document type for different versions of HTML including 
HTML5. XHTML 1.0 Transitional is the default setting and is suitable in most cases, so 
be sure to bring it back to this option.
Figure 2- 6: Choose XHTML 1.0 Transitional as your DocType.

are in Code View, you should switch to the Design view now.)
Figure 2-7: Your new, blank HTML page.
Saving a page to your site
You should get accustomed to saving pages to your local root folder early and often. It is very 
important that you store all your site’s resources in one main folder on your hard drive so that 
the links you set on your computer will work when your site is uploaded to a server. 
Follow these steps to save a page to your site
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose File > Save.
2.	 In the Save As dialog box, Dreamweaver should have automatically opened your 
dw02lessons folder which was defined earlier in the Site Settings.
If this is not the case, navigate to your desktop and locate the dw02lessons folder.
3.	 In the Save As text field, name your file about_us.html. 
4.	 Click Save to save the page in your local root folder. In the Files panel note that the file 
about_us.html has now been added. Again, this is why site settings are so important in 
Dreamweaver, files are automatically saved and organized based on having a site definition.

Defining page properties
Defining page properties
Now that you’ve created a page in Dreamweaver, you’ll use the Page Properties dialog 
box to specify its layout and formatting properties. For example, you can set page titles, 
background colors and images, text, and link colors, as well as other basic properties of every 
web page. You use this dialog box to define page properties for each new page you create, and 
to modify the settings for pages you’ve already created.
Follow these steps to create and modify settings for pages
Step-by-Step
1.	 To access the Page Properties dialog box, choose Modify > Page Properties, or use the 
keyboard shortcut Ctrl+J (Windows) or Command+J (Mac OS). The Page Properties 
dialog box appears, with the Appearance (CSS) category selected by default as seen in 
Figure 2-8.
Figure 2-8: The Page Properties dialog box.
Settings found in the Appearance (CSS) category will automatically create a Cascading 
Style Sheet that defines the appearance of your page. Using a CSS file to define these page 
properties adds flexibility to your design, as styling can be changed more easily, and more 
universally, than if your defaults are defined using HTML code.
2.	 The Page font and Size fields define the default appearance of text on your page. For now, 
leave these settings at their defaults. You’ll be styling type with CSS in later lessons in this 
book.
3.	 The Text color option allows you to set a default color in which to render type. To set a 
text color, click on the color swatch next to Text; the Swatches panel appears. You can 
choose your default text color by clicking on the appropriate swatch from the Swatches 
panel. Try this by clicking on any color swatch, and press Apply to apply your desired 
default text color.
You can also type the hexadecimal notation for your desired color into the text field. Type 
the hex code 666666 in the text field to specify a dark gray as the default text color.
Take Note...
You’ll see the effects of this change later in this lesson, when you add text to your page using 
the Files panel.

Defining page properties

4.	 Use the Background color option to choose a background color for your page. Click on the 
color swatch next to the Background text field; the Swatches panel appears. You can choose 
your background color by clicking on the appropriate swatch from the Swatches panel. Try 
this by clicking on any color swatch, then press Apply to see the results.
You can also choose the background color by typing the hexadecimal notation for your 
desired color into the Background text field. Type the hex code 739112 in the Background 
text field (as seen in Figure 2-9), then press Apply to specify a green as the background 
color.
Figure 2-9: Set a background color for your page.
5.	 The Background image field allows you to set a background image for your page. 
Dreamweaver mimics a browser’s behavior by repeating, or tiling, the background image 
to fill the window. To choose a background image, click the Browse button next to the 
Background image text field. The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
6.	 Navigate to the folder titled “Images” within the dw02lessons folder and select 
bg_gradient.gif for your page background; then press Apply. You will see the 
background image, which is a gradient, appear on the page. Background images are tiled 
both horizontally and vertically by default, which is not appropriate for this image, so you 
will fix this with the Repeat property.
7.	 From the Repeat drop-down menu, choose repeat-x (as seen in Figure 2-10). Click Apply 
to see the change.
Figure 2-10 Choose a background image for your page (background.gif).

Lesson 2
53
Lesson 2: Setting Up a New Site 
Defining page properties
Take Note...
You can also type the path to your background image into the Background image text field. 
8.	 By default, Dreamweaver places your text and images in close proximity to the top and left 
edges of the page. To build in some extra room between your page edges and the content 
on them, use the Margin settings in the Page Properties dialog box. In the Left margin 
text field, type 25 to place your content 25 pixels from the left edge of the page. In the Top 
margin text field, type 25 to place your content 25 pixels from the top edge of the page.
The Appearance (HTML) category in the Page Properties dialog box contains many of the 
same settings you just defined. Setting default page attributes with HTML code, however, 
is not recommended. Setting appearance with CSS is a better option.
The Links (CSS) category allows you to define the appearance of linked text within your 
document. For more information on creating hyperlinks, see Lesson 3, “Adding Text and 
Images.” 
9.	 Click on the Links category on the left-hand side and leave the Link font and Size settings 
at their defaults (same as Page font). This ensures that your hyperlinks will display in the 
same typeface and size as the rest of the text on your page.
10.	 Set the colors for your different link types in the following fields:
Link Color: Type #fc3 for the default link color applied to linked text on your web page.
Visited links: Type #ccc for the color applied to linked text after a user has clicked on it.
Rollover links: Type #f03 for the color applied to linked text when a user rolls over it.
Active links: Type #ff6 for the color applied when the user clicks on linked text.
11.	 Because you’re using CSS formatting, you can choose whether or not (and/or when) you 
want your links to be underlined. This is not possible with HTML formatting. Choose 
the default setting of Always Underline in the Underline style drop-down menu as seen in 
Figure 2-11.
Figure 2-11: Choose default colors for links, visited links, and active links.
The Headings (CSS) category allows you to define the font, style, size, and color of 
heading text within your document.
12.	 Click the Headings (CSS) category and leave the settings at their defaults for now. You’ll 
be using CSS to style your heading text later in this book.

Defining page properties

Lesson 2
13.	 Click the Title/Encoding category to the left of the Page Properties dialog box to expose 
more settings. Most of these settings are better left alone unless you know what they do 
and why you need to change them, with the major exception of the first one: Title.
14.	 Type Organic Utopia: About Us in the Title text field as seen in Figure 2-12. 
Take Note...
The document title is not the same thing as the document file name.The document title 
appears in the title bar of most browser windows and is also used when a user bookmarks a 
page. Document titles are used extensively by search engines to help categorize your page.
Leave the Document Type (DTD) set to XHTML 1.0 Transitional. This makes the 
HTML document XHTML-compliant.
Unicode (UTF-8) will likely be set as the default option. This specifies the encoding used 
for characters in your page, letting the browser know what to expect.
The Unicode Normalization Form is likely set to C (Canonical Decomposition). This setting 
is rarely changed unless you have a specific reason for changing it. Unicode Normalization 
Forms has to do with the way special characters such as glyphs are rendered on the screen.
Figure 2-12: The Title/Encoding category allows you to title your page and/or specify the encoding used.
15.	 Click the Tracing Image category in the left part of the Page Properties dialog box. 
A tracing image is a JPEG, GIF, or PNG image that you create in a separate graphics 
application, such as Adobe Photoshop or Fireworks. It is placed in the background of your 
page for you to use as a guide to recreate a desired page design.

application and use it as a visual guideline.
20.	When activated, the tracing image replaces any background image you’ve added to your 
page, but only in Dreamweaver. Tracing images are never visible when you view your 
page in a browser. Now that you have a sense of how the tracing feature works, you’ll 
remove it. Select the path within the Tracing Image field and press Delete to remove it.

4.	 Switch back to the Design view to continue this lesson.
A deeper look into the Files panel
You have already seen how Dreamweaver populates the Files panel when you define a new site. 
However, the Files panel is more than just a window into your root folder; it also allows you to 
manage files locally and transfer them to and from a remote server. The Files panel maintains a 
parallel structure between local and remote sites, copying and removing files when needed to 
ensure synchronicity between the two.
The default workspace in Dreamweaver displays the Files panel in the panel grouping to the 
right of the document window.
When you chose to use the dw02lessons folder as your local root folder earlier in this lesson, 
Dreamweaver set up a connection to those local files through the Files panel.

Renaming and updating links in the Files panel
The Files panel can perform tasks within Dreamweaver that are typically done within your 
operating system such as renaming and deleting files. Not only does this save time but has 
other advantages as well. In the case of renaming files, Dreamweaver will automatically allow 
you to update any links on the page including images.
Follow these steps to update links
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, expand the images folder if necessary by clicking on the arrow (Mac) or 
plus sign (PC) immediately to the left of the folder icon.
2.	 Click once on the file name beets.jpg and it will become active signifying that you can 
rename the file name. Type bunchofbeets and then press Return/Enter. The Update 
Files window appears asking if you would like to update index.html.
3.	 Press Update. Nothing will have appeared to change, which is exactly the point. If you 
had renamed this graphic in your operating system, there would have been a broken image 
on your page because the original reference to beets.jpg would be wrong. Dreamweaver 
recognizes the potential error and prompts you to fix it by updating the link. Behind the 
scenes in your HTML, Dreamweaver has rewritten the correct code for you. This is a 
major advantage in using Dreamweaver as it makes it difficult for you to accidently break 
links to assets in your site.
4.	 You can also duplicate and/or delete files within the Files panel. Select the 
bunchofbeets.jpg image in the Files panel and then click on the context menu in the top 
right of the panel and choose Edit > Duplicate. A duplicate image with the word copy in 
the file name is added to your Files panel.
5.	 Select the duplicate image you just created (bunchofbeets - Copy.jpg) and press the 
Delete key on your keyboard. You will be prompted by Dreamweaver asking if you want 
to delete the selected files. Press yes and the file will be gone.

Lesson 3
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your 
workspace. See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of 
this book.
You will work with several files from the dw03lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw03lessons folder. Go 
to Site > New Site, and name the site dw03lessons, or, for details on creating a site, refer to 
Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
Making text and images accessible
The Internet is a powerful tool allowing users from all over the world to access information 
remotely. However, there are often technical obstacles on a web page that prevent users with 
disabilities from accessing this information. There are a few different categories of disability 
types including Visual (Blindness, low vision, or color blindness), Hearing (Deafness), Motor 
(Inability to use a mouse, limited motor control, or response time) and Cognitive (Learning 
disabilities, inability to remember or focus on large amounts of information). Website 
accessibility, therefore is defined as the practice of providing equal access to the information 
and functionality of your website by people of all abilities and disabilities.
Include accessibility in the early plans of your website
Thinking about accessibility up-front in the design process is well worth your time. In 
addition to being the morally right thing to do, all websites strive to achieve the largest 
audience possible. Some estimates place the number of people in the population with some 
type of disability around 20%. This does not mean that all members of this group have 
difficulties accessing the Internet, but it is a large number nonetheless and excluding a group of 
people from accessing your site translates into lost sales and/or decreased visibility and publicity 
for your site.
In some scenarios, making your website accessible could also be the law. In the United States, 
there are laws that apply toward federally- or state-funded websites. These laws include the 
American with Disabilities Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Sections 
504 and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Many international laws also address 
accessibility. 
Below you will find a list of some key principles of accessible design. Most accessibility 
principles can be implemented very easily and will not impact the overall “look and feel” of 
your website.
Basic principles of website accessibility
So now that you’ve established what Accessibility is and why it matters, the question is how 
can you address these concerns on a practical level on your website. Throughout this book we 
will provide you explicit directions for using Dreamweaver for accessibility purposes, but a few 
general principles are in order:

Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Making text and images accessible
• Provide appropriate alternative text
Alternative text provides a text alternative to non-text content in web pages such as images. It 
is useful for people who are blind or visually impaired and rely on a screen reader to have the 
content of the website read aloud.
• Ensure users can complete and submit all forms
Form elements (text field, checkbox, drop-down menus) should have a label using the 
<label> tag. 
• Label links 
Add a title attribute to your links. The title attribute contains descriptive information about 
the link (such as the destination) and can be read aloud by screen readers and appears in most 
browsers when a user hovers over a link.
• Allow users to skip repetitive elements on the page
You should provide a method that allows users to skip repeated elements on the page such as 
navigation. This can be accomplished by providing a “Skip Navigation” or “Skip to Content” 
link at the top of the page which jumps to the main section of the page.
• Do not rely on color alone to convey information
The use of color is a valuable tool in design, but do not use color to convey information. Users 
who are colorblind may not be able to perceive it and will be unavailable to screen readers
• Keyboard equivalents
The accesskey attribute can be added to certain form elements, including area, button, input, 
label, legend, and textarea.
Screen Readers
Screen reading devices are designed to read aloud the content of a page. It is easy to imagine 
how this can be done with text, but what about other elements such as images. How does a 
screen reader handle these? In HTML an image can be referenced in the code like so:
<img src="tree.jpg">
This is the simplest example of the image tag but this tag has support for an attribute called the 
alt attribute, whose job is to provide a text alternative for non-text objects, so within the code 
it looks like this:
<img src="tree.jpg" alt="Maple tree">
Strictly speaking, adding the alt attribute to images is optional. As you will see in later lessons, 
Dreamweaver prompts you to add the alt attribute every time you insert an image. However 
Dreamweaver does not do this for other elements on the page, they will require your attention 
for maximum accessibility. Objects such as hyperlinks, image maps, table data order, buttons, 
movies, and sound need extra help in order to be read by a screen reader. You’ll learn some of 
these techniques throughout the book and in Lesson 16, “Managing your Website: Reports, 
Optimization, and Maintenance,” you will learn how to run a test within Dreamweaver to 
check your pages for accessibility.

Lesson 3
Website Usability
Accessibility and Usability are very closely related, but whereas accessibility is concerned 
with providing equal access to the information and functionality of your website, usability is 
concerned with removing the obstacles to the information on your site for your users. Some 
aspects of usability may seem obvious while other may not be so obvious. You will learn how 
to run a formal usability test in Lesson 16, but here are a few general principles:
• Visual hierarchy
Hierarchy is defined as organizing content into levels of importance. The tags in HTML 
can help you organize and group your content in logical ways and create a logical hierarchy. 
Headings, for example, come in six sizes (h1-h6). The heading 1 tag should contain the most 
important content on the page and using CSS font size and color you can direct your user’s eye 
to this heading first.
• Consistent location of repeatable items
Place elements such as navigation menus, search boxes or any other content that is visible on all 
the pages in your site in the same place in order to avoid user disorientation.
• File size (page load time)
Be aware of how the file size of a page can effect the usability of a site, especially for those 
users who have slower connections. Be judicious when adding content that can affect page load 
time such as animation, video, or audio. Optimize your images to achieve the smallest file size 
possible without losing image quality. If the total file size of a page is more than 100k, be aware 
that users with slower connections (including mobile) may experience delays in page load.
• Place the most important information above the fold
In the world of print media the term “above the fold” referred to the top half of a newspaper 
where the most important information is located. A website obviously has no fold, but there is 
a vertical cut-off point beyond which the user must scroll. Scrolling doesn’t have to be avoided, 
but there may be a point where it makes more sense to break a single long page into multiple 
pages and create links. 
Improving readability
Text is a significant proportion of most web pages and arguably the most important 
component. Regardless of what type of website you have, it is important that you have an 
understanding of the basic rules of Readability. Readability on the Web is defined as how 
well your users can process the information within your content. Poor readability will drive 
users away from your site. Excellent readability allows users to efficiently read and absorb the 
information in your text. There are some basic concepts to be aware of that will help you 
create readable text:
• Contrast 
One of the most important factors determining readability Good contrast largely goes 
unnoticed as it makes text easy on the eyes. Poor contrast forces the users eye to work hard and 
results in slower intake of information and possible abandonment of the site. Black text on a 
white background is the standard and most safe level of contrast. Be careful of any colored text 
on a colored background, especially for large blocks of text.

Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Adding text
• Font Size
One of the most obvious elements determining readability The smaller the font, the harder is 
to read, but what are the guidelines? It is hard to define a single number because readability 
is partially based on other factors such as the target audience of your website and the amount 
of text within a given section. For body copy, the general rule of thumb is that anything less 
than 10 pixels for font size is too small for most readers. Consider the following fact: if you 
were to do no styling whatsover, the default web browser font size for a paragraph is 16 pixels. 
Therefore you should use your best judgement and consider all the other factors and stay 
within 10-16 pixels for the majority of your text.
• Serif versus sans-serif
A conservative way to choose fonts for your page is to use serif fonts (such as Times or 
Georgia) for your body copy and sans-serif fonts (such as Verdana or Trebuchet) for your 
headings. There has been some evidence that serif fonts are somewhat easier to read on the 
computer screen. However you should take this advice with a grain of salt, Verdana, for 
example is a sans-serif font that was specifically designed for readability on a monitor and 
works well as body copy. 
• Paragraph line-height and line length
Line-height is the amount of space between the lines in a paragraph. Too much line-height 
can cause the reader to lose their place in the text. Too little line-height causes text to look 
cramped and can frustrate the reader. Line length refers to how long a line of text is. If line 
length is too long the user works hard to stay on track and they often lose their place. If line 
length is too short the user has to retain infomation as their eye skips to the next line and they 
can also lose their place. 
• Organization of content
On the web the user is often “scanning” your text instead of truly reading it. The web tends 
to be more about information seeking rather than the more focused reading of a magazine 
article or a book. To make your copy scannable, you should make good use of headers and 
hierarchy and provide focus points to guide the user through the content. Examples of focus 
points include using lists of information where necessary, using images to break up content and 
taking the factors mentioned above (font-size, color, paragraph spacing) into account.
Typography and images on the Web
Dreamweaver CS6 offers some convenient features for placing images and formatting text. In 
this lesson, you’ll be working with a few pages within a site and adding some photos and text 
to a simple page for a fictional store.
Adding text
You should already have created a new site, using the dw03lessons folder as your root. In this 
section, you’ll be adding a headline and formatting the text on the events.html page.
Follow these steps to add text to a page
Step-by-Step
1.	 If it’s not already open, launch Dreamweaver CS6. 
2.	 Make sure your dw03lessons site is open in the Files panel. If not, open it now.

3.	 Double-click on the events.html file in your Files panel to open it in the Design view. 
Without any formatting, the text seems random and lacks purpose. First, you’ll add a 
headline to give the first paragraph some context. 
4.	 Click to place your cursor in front of the word There’s in the first paragraph. Type 
OrganicUtopia Events and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create a line 
break as seen in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1: Typing the words OrganicUtopia Events and then putting them on their own line.
5.	 Click and drag to highlight the phrase you just typed. You will now format your text 
using the Property Inspector. Located at the bottom of the screen, the Property 
Inspector allows you to format your text using a combination of HTML and CSS. HTML 
stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and CSS stands for Cascading Styles Sheets. 
You will learn much more about the use of HTML and CSS in the next lesson; however, 
you will need to have a basic understanding of these two languages in order to use the 
Property Inspector to format your text.

6.	 Locate the Property Inspector at the bottom of your screen; there are two buttons immediately 
below the word “Properties.” If necessary, click on the HTML button to see your HTML 
formatting options. Choose Heading 1 from the Format drop-down menu. The text gets larger 
and becomes bold. By default, the style of any HTML text formatted as Heading 1 is generic: 
the color is black and the font-family is Times New Roman (Figure 3-2). 
Figure 3-2: Use the Format drop-down menu in the Property Inspector to make the selected text a level-1 heading.
Although you are working in Dreamweaver’s Design view, you have actually changed the 
HTML code for this page. Page content such as text is wrapped in opening and closing 
tags, and everything between these two tags is formatted according to the rules of these 
tags. The text OrganicUtopia Events originally had an opening and closing tag defining it 
as a paragraph. The code looked like this:
<p>OrganicUtopia Events</p>
The first <p> is the opening tag for a paragraph, and the second </p> is the closing tag 
for a paragraph. A pair of opening and closing tags in HTML is called an element. So in 
the previous step, you changed the formatting of the text from a paragraph element to a 
Heading 1 element, and the HTML code changed to this:
<h1>OrganicUtopia Events</h1>
Headings are important structural elements in HTML. The largest heading is H1, and the 
subsequent headings become smaller with H2, H3, and so on. For the next step, you will 
format this text in order to change the font style of this heading to Arial; however, you 
will not be using HTML to accomplish this, but rather CSS.

7.	 Click anywhere inside the heading OrganicUtopia Events; you do not need to have it 
selected. In the Property Inspector, click on the CSS button to access the formatting options. 
Choose Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif from the Font drop-down menu as seen in Figure 3-3. 
Figure 3-3: The CSS section of the Property Inspector allows you to change the font.
The New CSS Rule dialog box appears. 
8.	 From the Selector Type drop-down menu, choose Tag. In the Selector Name text field, 
the selector h1 has been chosen for you (Figure 3-4). Dreamweaver does this because you 
placed your cursor inside the text formatted as H1.

Press OK. Your heading is now styled in Verdana.

Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Adding text
The role of the font stack
Dreamweaver allows you to format text in a way that is similar to desktop publishing 
and word processing applications, but there are important differences to keep in mind. 
When you chose the styling, Verdana, Geneva, and sans-serif, they were listed together 
as one option in the Font drop-down menu. When a web page is rendered in a browser, 
it uses the fonts installed on the user’s computer. Assigning multiple fonts allows you to 
control which font is used if the person viewing your page doesn’t have a specific font 
installed. In this case, if the user doesn’t have Verdana, Geneva displays instead. Sans-serif 
is included as the last option in case the user doesn’t have either Verdana or Geneva. A 
generic font family (either sans-serif or serif) is listed at the end of all the options in the 
Font drop-down menu.
The Font drop-down menu has a list of default font-families, however you can also 
create a custom font-stack by choosing the Edit Fonts option and in the Edit Font List 
window that appears, select one or more option from the list of Available fonts and add 
them to the Chosen fonts list and then click OK. You will now have a custom font list 
that will always be available in the Fonts menu within the Property Inspector.
Additional text formatting options
There are additional HTML text formatting options, some of them may not be used frequently 
but you should know that they exist. Try selecting text on your page and using some of the 
following formatting.
• Blockquote 
The blockquote element will take selected text and indent it slightly to the right, thereby 
setting it off visually from the rest of the page. (Choose Insert > HTML > Text Objects > 
Blockquote.)
• Abbreviation
The abbreviation element allows you to describes an abbreviated phrase.
By marking up abbreviations you can give useful information to browsers, spell checkers, 
translation systems, and search-engine indexers.
You will now change the text color using the Property Inspector.

Importing Word and Excel documents
You cannot import Microsoft Word or Excel documents directly into Dreamweaver, 
those file formats are not supported. There are two useful methods, however for bringing 
in the content from these documents.
Microsoft Word
• If you have Microsoft Word on your system, you may open the file and then save it as Plain 
Text (.txt) and then open this file directly in Dreamweaver by choosing File > Open. Keep 
in mind that .txt files do not support Microsoft Word styles so any formatting will be lost. 
In many cases, however, this is preferable as you will have finer control over the name and 
properties of the styles you create in Dreamweaver.
• The other method for importing is by copying selected text in Microsoft Word (by choosing 
Edit > Copy) and then switching to Dreamweaver and choosing Edit > Paste Special. The Paste 
Special dialog box gives you multiple options for how you would like the text to be formatted 
when you click OK. 
In general, if you would like no styles to be transferred you would select the “Text Only” 
option or the “Text with Structure”option. If you would like to carry over styles from 
Word you should try either the “Text with structure plus basic formatting” or the “Text 
with structure plus full formatting” options. Keep in mind that if you import styles from 
Microsoft Word they are automatically converted to CSS styles and these are not always 
logically named or useful. We highly recommend not attempting to import styles form 
Word unless necessary.
Microsoft Excel
• If you have Microsoft Excel on your system, you may open the file and then save it in a 
delimited format such as a comma separated value file (.csv) and then open this file directly in 
Dreamweaver by choosing File > Open. If you open a .csv file directly, the data appears as plain 
text. Oftentimes a more useful option is to choose File > Import Tabular Data in which case 
you can format the data into an HTML table and maintain the row and column structure. (An 
exercise outlining these steps can be found in Lesson 8, “Working with Tables.”)
• The other method for importing data is by copying selected text in Microsoft Excel (by 
choosing Edit > Copy) and then switching to Dreamweaver and choosing Edit > Paste Special. 
As in the examples listed above for Microsoft Word, you may choose to bring in data as plain 
text or with structure and formatting styles. The primary difference here is that if you choose 
to bring in data with the “structure” options, the data will be pasted as a table.
Linking to Microsoft Word and Excel files
• You can link elements such as text or images to Word and Excel documents as well. Simply 
select the object you would like to link and then choose Insert > Hyperlink. In the Hyperlink 
window, click on the Folder icon in the Link section and navigate to a Word or Excel 
document. It is important that this file already be located within your current site folder (just 
like any other asset such as images or video). Keep in mind that a visitor who clicks on this link 
online will need some method of opening Word or Excel files.

Lesson 3
An introduction to styles
You have styled the first element on your page by first formatting the text as a Heading 1 in 
HTML, and then you changed the font and color using CSS. It’s important to realize that 
every change you make in the Design view creates or modifies the code. In the next exercise, 
you’ll begin to explore the HTML and CSS code behind the Design view. To help put this 
exercise in context, a little background on HTML and CSS is in order.
The HTML language has been around since the dawn of the Web. It’s easiest to think of 
HTML as the structure behind the pages that are rendered in your web browser. An HTML 
page at its most basic is a collection of text, images, and sometimes multimedia such as Flash or 
video files. The different sections of a web page, such as a paragraph, a heading, or a list, are all 
elements. 
CSS is also a language, but it has not been around as long as HTML. In many ways, CSS was 
created in order to allow HTML to do what it does best: create the structure of a page, but 
not style. CSS is a simple language that works in combination with HTML to apply style to 
the content in web pages, such as text, images, tables, and form elements. CSS uses rules, or 
style instructions, that the HTML elements on your page follow. The most important thing to 
remember is that HTML and CSS are two separate languages, but they are very closely aligned 
and work together very well.
In the last exercise, you were introduced to this interplay between HTML and CSS. There was 
an HTML element for the Heading 1 formatting. In the code it looks like this:
<h1>OrganicUtopia Events</h1>
That was the HTML element. The CSS rule that defines the appearance of the <h1> element 
looks like this:
h1 {
font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;
color: #9C3; 
}
CSS has a different syntax than HTML. In HTML, tags are defined by angled brackets, and 
you have opening tags, <h1>, and closing tags, </h1>. In CSS code, you are not working 
with tags at all, instead you use selectors. In the CSS code above, the h1 is referred to as 
the selector because it is selecting the HTML element and then declaring some rules for its 
appearance. Because you’ve established that HTML and CSS are two separate languages and 
have different syntax, it’s important that you see where this code lives in your web page. You 
will do this by changing Dreamweaver’s workspace.
This exercise is intended to help you understand the relationship between HTML and CSS 
code that is created in Dreamweaver, and is not necessarily the way you will always work in 
the program. Many people will work in the Design view most of the time, but the Split view 
you are about to use is very helpful for learning the languages of HTML and CSS.

An introduction to styles
Follow these steps to format text using CSS
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click on the Split button in the Document toolbar at the top of your page to open up 
the Split view. The Split view allows you to see your code and the design of your page 
simultaneously. 
2.	 Click quickly three times in the paragraph beneath OrganicUtopia Events in the Design 
view. In the Code view the text is highlighted between the opening and closing paragraph 
tags as seen in Figure 3-6. As noted above, this is referred to as the paragraph element. 
Figure 3-6: A paragraph highlighted in the Split view.
You will now change the font size of your paragraphs.
3.	 Make sure you have CSS selected in the Property Inspector at the bottom of your page and 
choose 18 from the Size drop-down menu. The New CSS Rule dialog box appears again. 
This dialog box appears because it is the first time you have attempted to style a paragraph. 
After you define the properties, all text formatted as a paragraph will appear as indicated.
4.	 From the Selector Type drop-down menu, choose Tag. Since there are different categories 
of CSS rules, Dreamweaver wants to know which one you would like to use. You will 
stick with Tag for now (as you did in the last exercise). In the Selector Name text field, the 
selector p has been chosen for you because your cursor was inside a paragraph. Press OK 
to apply the changes; in this case, the font size is set to 18 pixels. Now let’s look at the CSS 
code that is defining this font size.
5.	 Within the Code view of the split screen is all the HTML and CSS code that defines the 
appearance of this page. On the right side of the Code view, scroll up by clicking on the 
up arrow or by clicking the scroll bar and dragging upward. Toward the top of the page, 
you are looking for a few lines of code that look like this:

Lesson 3
<style type="text/css">
h1 {
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
color: #9C3; 
}
p {
font-size:18px;
}
</style>
Between the two <style> tags are all the CSS rules you have created up to this point. 
Previously, you learned that CSS has a different syntax than HTML: because all the CSS 
rules are actually contained within an opening <style> tag and a closing </style> tag, 
they are allowed to have a different syntax. Additionally, the style tag itself is nested inside 
an opening and closing <head> tag. In the world of HTML, nothing contained within 
head tags is rendered on a web browser’s screen. You will explore this further in the next 
lesson, but this is referred to as an internal style sheet.
You will now see that changes made in Dreamweaver’s Code view apply to the Design 
view as well. 
6.	 In the Code view, locate the line font-size:18px in the rule for p, and select the value 
18 by clicking and dragging over it. Type 14 to change the value. Although you made a 
change in the Code view, it has not yet been automatically updated in your Design view. 
You need to refresh your page in order to see the changes occur in the Design view.
7.	 In the Property Inspector, press the Refresh button to apply the changes; your paragraph 
text becomes smaller (Figure 3-7). 
Figure 3-7: Changes made in the Code view are reflected in the Design view after pressing the Refresh button.
Take Note...
You can also click once inside the Design view for the page to refresh automatically.

Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Previewing pages in a web browser
On the Web, font sizes are specified differently than they are in print. The numerical 
choices in the Size drop-down menu refer to pixels instead of points. Also, the xx-small 
through larger options may seem oddly generic if you are accustomed to the precision 
of print layout. Because web pages are displayed on a variety of monitors and browsers, 
relative measurements can be a useful way for designers to plan ahead for inevitable 
discrepancies in the rendering of pages.
8.	 Click inside the first paragraph in the Design view. You will now change the color of 
the paragraph slightly to a dark gray rather than the default pure black. In the Property 
Inspector, click on the color swatch, and in the top-left corner, locate the dark gray 
swatch, which is hexadecimal color #666. Click on the swatch to apply the color. Notice 
that not only does the appearance in the Design view change, but in your Code view a 
new line of CSS has also been created (color: #666).
Working in the Split view can be a great way to learn about hand-coding without diving 
in completely. Even if you’re not quite comfortable editing code, keeping an eye on the 
code that Dreamweaver writes for you can give you a better understanding of how things 
like CSS affect your web pages.
9.	 Click the Design view button to return to Design view.
10.	 Choose File > Save. Keep this file open for the next part of this lesson.
Take Note...
For a more in-depth look at Cascading Style Sheets see the Web Design with HTML and 
CSS Digital Classroom book available in electronic and print formats.
Previewing pages in a web browser
Viewing your pages in the Design view is helpful, but visitors to your site will be using a web 
browser to access your site. In Lesson 1, “Dreamweaver CS6 Jumpstart,” you learned how 
browsers use HTML code to render a page. Unfortunately, not every browser renders HTML 
code in exactly the same way, so it’s important to test-drive your pages in a number of different 
browsers to check for inconsistencies and basic functionality.
Next, you’ll use Dreamweaver’s Preview in Browser feature to see how the OrganicUtopia 
site looks in a web browser.

Lesson 3
1.	 With events.html open in Dreamweaver, choose File > Preview in Browser (Figure 3-8) 
and select a browser from the available options. This list varies, depending on the browsers 
you have installed on your hard drive.
Figure 3-8: Preview in Browser allows you to see how a selected browser would render your page.
Take Note...
The options found under File > Preview in Browser can be customized by choosing File > 
Preview in Browser > Edit Browser List. 
2.	 When events.html opens in the browser of your choice, look for differences between 
the Design view preview and the version rendered by your browser. At this stage, there 
shouldn’t be anything too surprising, but there may be subtle differences in spacing and 
font style. Close your web browser.
There is another method to preview your pages: the Live View feature. Live View allows 
you to preview your page without having to leave the Dreamweaver workspace. You 
can think of Live View as a browser within Dreamweaver (in fact, it is the same WebKit 
rendering engine found in browsers such as Apple’s Safari and Google’s Chrome, among 
others).

3.	 Press the Live button located in the Document toolbar at the top of your page as seen in 
Figure 3-9. You will not see a dramatic difference, but your text may shift slightly. Select 
the first heading in the window and try to delete it; you will be unable to, because Live 
View is a non-editable workspace. However, Live View does allow you to edit your page 
when you are in Split view. Here, you are allowed to edit in the Code view and changes 
will be reflected in real time. An additional advantage is that your document does not have 
to be saved in order to see the changes.
Figure 3-9: When Live View is enabled, Dreamweaver simulates a web browser.
4.	 Click the Live button again to deactivate this view. While Live View is a useful addition to 
Dreamweaver, it does not replace the need to preview your page in a browser. Web pages 
might be rendered differently depending on your visitor’s browser, and so it is a good habit 
to check your page occasionally as you make changes to your design. 
Take Note...
You can also preview your page designs in other browsers and for different platforms using 
Adobe’s Browser Lab service. We cover the steps for this in Lesson 16, “Managing your 
Website: Reports, Optimization, and Maintenance.”
Understanding hyperlinks
When people visit a website, they usually expect to see more than one page. Imagine trying 
to shop for a new book by your favorite author on a site that consisted of nothing more than 
a single order form with every book offered by a retailer like Amazon.com. This might seem 
absurd, but without hyperlinks you wouldn’t have much choice.
Hyperlinks make the Web a truly interactive environment. They allow the user to freely 
navigate throughout a website, or jump from one site to another. There are a number of ways 
to create links in Dreamweaver, but before you get started, you should be aware of some 
fundamental facts. 
Links rely on directory paths to locate files. A directory path is simply a description of a file’s 
location that can be understood by a computer. A classic, real-world example is an address. If 
you wanted to send a letter to your friend Sally in Florida, you would have to specify the state, 
city, street, and house number where Sally can be found. If Sally lived at 123 Palm Street in 
Orlando, the path would be:
Florida/Orlando/123 Palm Street/Sally

Lesson 3
This simply means that inside Florida, inside Orlando, in the house numbered 123 on a street 
named Palm Street, you can find a person named Sally. Hyperlinks follow the same logic:
www.somewebsitesomewhere.com/photos/mydog.jpg
This URL address is a link to a JPEG image named mydog.jpg, which is inside a folder named 
photos on a website named somewebsitesomewhere.com. 
Creating hyperlinks
Later in this lesson, you’ll be creating a gallery page to showcase some of the sample products 
mentioned in the main paragraph. Before you work on that page, you’ll link it to the home 
page by creating a hyperlink. If you are not already in Design view, select Design view now.
Follow these steps to create a hyperlink
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Property Inspector, click on the HTML button to access the HTML properties.
2.	 In the first paragraph, highlight the word products in the second sentence.
3.	 In the Property Inspector, type products.html in the Link text field (Figure 3-10). Press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). The highlighted word automatically becomes 
underlined. It is important to note that we have created this page for you and it is 
currently inside your site folder, you are simply linking to it.
Figure 3-10: Type products.html into the Link text field in the Property Inspector.
4.	 Choose File > Save and then File > Preview in Browser.
5.	 Click on the new products link. The products page appears in your browser window. This 
is because a previously existing page named products.html was located in this folder.
Now visitors can easily navigate to the products page, but what happens when they want 
to go back to the events page? It looks like you’ll need another link.
6.	 Return to Dreamweaver and double-click on products.html in the Files panel. Click to 
the right of the word Produce and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create a 
new line. Choose Insert > Hyperlink to open the Hyperlink dialog box. 
The Hyperlink dialog box is one of the many ways to create a link in Dreamweaver. It 
offers all the options found in the Property Inspector, with a few additions.

8.	 Click on the Browse button to the right of the Link text field to open the Select File 
dialog box. The dw03lessons folder you defined as the root for this site should be selected 
for you by default. If not, click the Site Root button. Select events.html and press OK 
(Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
9.	 Click inside the Title field and type Organic Utopia events page. Titles are strictly 
optional for hyperlinks, but they improve accessibility for users with assistive technologies, 
such as Screen Readers. Additionally, adding titles to your hyperlinks can also improve 
your site’s search engine rankings. Click OK to commit the changes; notice that a link 
to events.html has been created for you using the text entered into the Text field in the 
Hyperlink dialog box.
10.	 Choose File > Save and keep this file open for the next part of this lesson.
Named Hyperlink Anchors
In addition to linking from one page to another, you can also link to a specific location 
on a page. This is most useful on pages with lots of content. Imagine a page that has a list 
of the 100 best restaurants in the world and you would like to link to number 99 on this 
page. You could add a named anchor to this item and then create a hyperlink sending a 
user directly to the section.
To create and link to a Named Anchor
1.	 Place your cursor in front of the first letter of the page element you would like to 
link to.
2.	 Choose Insert > Named Anchor or click the “Named Anchor” icon in the 
“Common” toolbar.
3.	 Give your anchor a name; type best99.
4.	 Click OK. Named anchors appear as a small anchor icon in the Design view and as 
<a name="best99"> in the Code view.
5.	 To link to the named anchor you need to select the element you want linked (such as 
a text).
6.	 In the Properties Inspector, use the Point to File icon and drag it to the name anchor. 
You could also type in the anchor name within the Link field of the Properties 
Inspector, like so #best99.

Lesson 3
Relative versus absolute hyperlinks 
After reading about the fundamentals of hyperlinks and directory paths a few pages ago, you 
may be surprised by the simplicity of linking events.html and products.html. Instead of entering 
a long directory path in the Link text fields, you merely typed the name of the file. This kind of 
link is called a relative hyperlink. Let’s go back to the address example to see how this works.
Remember Sally from Orlando? Imagine you were already standing on Palm Street, where she 
lives. If you called her for directions to her house, she probably wouldn’t begin by telling you 
how to get to Florida. At this point, all you need is a house number. Relative links work the 
same way. Because events.html and products.html both reside in the dw03lessons folder, you 
don’t need to tell the browser where to find this folder.
Now you’ll create an absolute link that will allow visitors to access the Adobe website to learn 
more about Dreamweaver CS6.
Follow these steps to create an absolute hyperlink
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click on the events.html tab above the Document toolbar to bring the page forward. 
Scroll down to the bottom of the page if necessary. Using the Design view window, create 
a new line at the bottom of the page after the text that reads “Occasionally we gather...”, 
and type This page was created with Adobe Dreamweaver. 
2.	 Highlight the words Adobe Dreamweaver and in the Common section of the Insert panel 
on the right side of the screen, click on the Hyperlink icon to open the Hyperlink dialog 
box (Figure 3-12).
Figure 3-12: The Hyperlink icon in the Insert panel  
is another convenient way to create links.
3.	 The Hyperlink dialog box opens. Notice that Adobe Dreamweaver has been entered into 
the Text field for you. In the Link text field, type http://www.adobe.com/products/

forward slashes.

Take Note...
You do not have to type the absolute hyperlinks if you have the website open in your browser. 
In your web browser, select the address in the address bar, copy it, and then paste it into the 
Link field in Dreamweaver.
4.	 Choose _blank from the Target drop-down menu (Figure 3-13). Choosing the _blank 
option will cause the hyperlink to the Adobe website to open in a new, blank browser 
window or tab (depending on the browser).
Figure 3-13: Set the target window for the hyperlink to

The Target attribute 
The target attribute in HTML specifies where to open a linked document. There 
are four possible values for this attribute
• _blank  Opens the linked document in a new window or tab 
• _self  Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is 
default) 
• _parent  Opens the linked document in the parent frame
• _top  Opens the linked document in the full body of the window

Absolute and relative links can be used to access web pages, but it’s also possible to link to an 
e-mail address. Instead of opening a new web page, an e-mail link opens up the default mail 
program on a visitor’s computer and populates the address field with the address you specify 
when creating the link. As you may imagine, this kind of link can work differently depending 
on how your visitors have configured their computers.

Creating lists
Bulleted lists may be familiar to you if you have worked with word processing or desktop 
publishing applications. Lists are a helpful way to present information to a reader without the 
formal constraints of a paragraph. They are especially important on the Web. Studies indicate 
that people typically skim web pages instead of reading them from beginning to end. Creating 
lists will make it easier for your visitors to get the most from your website without sifting 
through several paragraphs of text.
Follow these steps to create a list in HTML
Step-by-Step
1.	 On the events.html page, click and drag to highlight the four lines below Spring Events.
2.	 Make sure you have the HTML button selected in the Property Inspector at the bottom 
of your page, and click the Unordered List button (Figure 3-15). The highlighted text 
becomes indented, and a bullet point is placed at the beginning of each line.
Figure 3-15: Use the Unordered List button in the Property Inspector to create a bulleted list.
3.	 Click the Ordered List button to the right of the Unordered List button. The bullets 
change to sequential numbers. 
4.	 Choose Format > List > Properties to open the List Properties dialog box. Choose 
Bulleted List from the List type drop-down menu to return to your first style of list. The 
Numbered List and Bulleted List options in the List type drop-down menu also allow you 
to switch between ordered and unordered lists. 
5.	 From the Style drop-down menu, choose Square as seen in Figure 3-16. This changes the 
default circular bullets to square bullets. Press OK to exit the List Properties dialog box.
Figure 3-16: Change the bullet style to square in the  
List Properties dialog box.
You may have noticed that the four lines of text in your list have lost their style. They are 
slightly larger than your paragraphs and they are black, not dark gray. This is because a 
style has been defined for paragraphs, but not an unordered list. You will now create a new 
CSS rule for the appearance of all unordered lists in the document.

the selector ul has been chosen for you; ul is the HTML tag for an unordered list. If ul 
is not chosen for you, type ul inside this text field. Press OK to apply the changes; in this 
case the font size is set to 14 pixels. Now you need to change the color of the unordered 
list to match the color of your paragraph.

Creating lists
Creating a Definition list
Ordered and Unordered lists are used frequently in web pages. There is a third type of 
list in HTML that is used less frequently called a Definition list. A Definition list is a list 
of terms and corresponding definitions
Example:
Professional sports teams of Boston
	
Boston Red Sox
	
Boston Celtics
	
Boston Bruins
Definition lists have a slightly more complex structure than either ordered or unordered 
lists. In the example above, “Professional sports teams of Boston” is the definition term 
(which uses the dt tag) and the three teams are each definition descriptions (using the dd 
tag). So in HTML, the example looks like this:
<dl>
	
<dt>Professional sports teams of Boston</dt>
	
	
<dd>Boston Red Sox</dd>
	
	
<dd>Boston Celtics</dd>
	
	
<dd>Boston Bruins</dd>
	
</dt>
</dl>
The formatting of Definition lists are also different than either ordered or unordered lists. 
The definition description(s) for any given definition term will be indented one level by 
default, making it visually clear that the description is a sub-category of the term.
To create a definition list
1.	 Place your cursor on a new line where you would like to add the list and choose 
Insert > HTML > Text Objects > Definition List.
Type your definition term (this is the dt tag).
2.	 If you would like the next line to be a Definition Description, press Return and 
Dreamweaver will automatically add one (this is the dd tag). Alternatively if 
you wanted another Definition Term on the second line instead of a Definition 
Description, you could choose Insert > HTML > Text Objects > Definition term.

Paying attention to copyright 
Anyone who publishes content to the Web needs to be aware of the legal issues involved. In 
general, unless you have created the content yourself (such as text, images, video, music or any 
other media) you will need the permission of the creator. There are some exceptions to this 
principle, although they are very rare.
• Intellectual property 
Refers to unique content for which a set of exclusive rights are recognized under law. Under 
intellectual property law, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible 
assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, 
phrases, symbols, and designs. 
• Copyright
Copyright is one type of Intellectual Property and is a legal concept giving the creator of 
original work exclusive rights to it, usually for a limited time. There are certain standards for 
labeling content that is copyrighted, such as the copyright symbol (©) or the word “copyright” 
or adding the date of publication on the content. It is important to note that the lack of a 
copyright on content (such as an image) does not mean that there is no copyright. The author 
of a creative work is automatically assigned a legal copyright regardless of whether there is a 
label or not.
• Fair Use Doctrine
Fair use is a doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring 
permission from the rights holders. General examples of this would include news reporting, 
commentary, criticism, and for some educational purposes. There are some general guidelines 
for determining whether content can be used as fair use. For more information on this, visit:
http://fairuse.stanford.edu/Copyright_and_Fair_Use_Overview/chapter9/9-b.html
So how does this all affect you, the web designer? As stated earlier, do not use content on 
your site unless you are sure you have permission from the creator. If you have any questions 
about whether something can be used, hold off until you have consulted someone with legal 
background.
• Derivative work
A derivative work is material that is “based on or derived from” another work such as a 
painting of a scene from a movie.
You may not distribute a derivative work of a work under copyright without the original 
author’s permission unless the content meets certain criteria of fair use.
A web designer, for example, might take a famous photograph and apply a Photoshop filter to 
it. Chances are this image will still remain under copyright even though it has been altered 
slightly.

Lesson 3
Citing a website or other content from the Internet
The World Wide Web is built on hyperlinked documents which makes it easy for you 
to link to or embed content from other websites. An informal citing of material can be a 
mention in your text, e.g., “On April 24, 2012, Newsweek had listed on its website . . .”. 
If a more formal citation is required you can follow these guideline examples below. The 
web is not like a print publication so try to include relevant information such as the date 
visited or modified:

Inserting images
Images are an essential part of most web pages. Just as lists make content friendlier and more 
accessible, images help to give your visitors the rich, visual experience that they’ve come to expect 
on the Web. However, before you learn to insert images, you will briefly learn about web graphics.
Image resolution
Image resolution is defined as the number of pixels in a digital image, typically as 
“width × height”. Your original image has an absolute number of pixels and if you need to 
resize it, this is most often done in an image editing program such as Photoshop. While it is 
possible to resize images with Dreamweaver, it’s generally not a good idea. Specifying the 
width and height of an image in the Property Inspector changes the display size of the image, 
but it does not resample the image the way a graphic processing application like Photoshop 
does. For example, a JPEG image that is 150 pixels by 150 pixels might have a file size of 30k. 
You could resize this image in Dreamweaver by 50% and the result would be a thumbnail 
image displayed at 75 pixels by 75 pixels. However, even though the image is visually smaller, 
the file size remains the same. A visitor to your website still must download the 30k file and 
this translates to slower loading time for the image (and possibly the page) and a potentially 
poor user experience, especially if they have low bandwith.
Image formats
The three most common image formats on the Web are JPEG, GIF, and PNG. While an 
exhaustive description of how each of these formats compresses data is beyond the scope of this 
book, a general overview can help you avoid some common pitfalls.
The JPEG format was created by a committee named the Joint Photographic Experts Group. Its 
sole purpose is to compress photographic images. Specifically, it uses lossy compression, which 
means that it selectively discards information, to reduce the size of a file. When you save a JPEG, 
you decide how much information you are willing to sacrifice by selecting a quality level. A 
high-quality image preserves more information and results in a larger file size. A low-quality 
image discards more information, but produces a smaller file size. The goal is to reduce file size 
as much as possible without creating distortion and artifacts.

Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Inserting images
Because JPEGs were designed to handle photographic images, they can significantly reduce the 
size of images containing gradients and soft edges, without producing noticeable degradation. 
However, reproducing sharp edges and solid areas of color often requires a higher quality setting.
The GIF format was created by CompuServe. GIF is an acronym for Graphics Interchange 
Format. Unlike the JPEG format, GIFs do not use lossy compression. Instead, GIFs rely on a 
maximum of 256 colors to reduce the size of images. This means that images with a limited 
number of colors can be reproduced without degradation. Logos, illustrations, and line 
drawings are well-suited to this format. Unlike JPEGs, GIFs excel at reproducing sharp edges 
and solid areas of color. However, because photographic elements such as gradients and soft 
edges require a large number of colors to appear convincing, GIF images containing these 
elements look choppy and posterized. 
The PNG format has become increasingly popular on the Web in recent years because it 
incorporates many of the best features of JPEGs and GIFs. The PNG format is closer to GIFs 
in that it offers lossless compression and comes in two categories: 8 bit and 24 bit. This means 
it can be used quite effectively for simple graphics as well as continuous tone photographic 
images. A PNG also offers better transparency features than a GIF, most significantly the 
support of alpha channels. For many years the adoption of PNGs (especially the use of the 
transparency) was held back because Internet Explorer 6 ignored the transparency. As the 
number of people using that browser continues to decline, the PNG format is being used more 
frequently. For more information on web graphics see the Web Design with HTML and CSS 
Digital Classroom book, which is available in both print and electronic formats.
Creating a simple gallery page
Now that you have a better understanding of the types of images that are appropriate for use 
on your website, it’s time to build the products.html page that you linked to earlier in this 
lesson.
Follow these steps to create a gallery page
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click on products.html in the Files panel or click on the tab, as it’s still open. 
Place your cursor after the word Produce and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) 
to create a new line.
2.	 Choose Insert > Image. The Select Image Source dialog box appears. If your site folder 
does not open automatically, click the Site Root button, and then double-click the images 
folder. Select beets.jpg and press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
3.	 When the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box appears, type Beets in the 
Alternate text field. Press OK.
Take Note...
The Alternate text field in the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box corresponds to 
the Alt attribute of an <img> tag. Including a description of the inserted image in this field 
is not technically necessary, but it is good practice. It provides information about the images to 
visually impaired visitors using screen readers. Also, Alt text is displayed in place of images on 
some handheld devices, and browsers where images are disabled.

Lesson 3
4.	 Click on the Split button in the Document toolbar to view the code that was written by 
Dreamweaver when you inserted beets.jpg (Figure 3-18). An <img> tag was created, with 
four attributes. The src attribute is a relative link to the .jpg file in your images folder. 
The alt attribute is the alternate text you specified in the last step. The width and height 
attributes are simply the width and height of the image, and these have automatically been 
added by Dreamweaver. Press the Design button to return to this view.
Figure 3-18: Dreamweaver creates an <img> tag with a number of attributes when you insert an image.
Take Note...
Although you can scale an image in Dreamweaver, you need to be very careful doing so. The 
width and height attributes of an image are automatically pulled from the dimensions of your 
web graphic You can scale a graphic in Dreamweaver two ways: 1.) By modifiying the Width 
and Height values of a selected image within the Properties panel or 2.) Clicking and dragging 
one of the corners of a selected image in the Design view.
In general, it is highly recommended that you not scale an image using either of these two 
techniques. It is easy to distort an image using these techniques and the recommended practice is 
to use an image editor such as Photoshop to do your scaling and then replace the image.
5.	 Double-click on the images folder in the Files panel to reveal its contents. In the document 
window, click to the right of the beets image and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) 
to create a new line. Click and drag cucumbers.jpg from your Files panel directly below the 
beets image in the Design view. When the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box 
appears, type Cucumbers into the Alternate text field. Press OK.

9.	 Choose File > Save and leave products.html open for the next part of this lesson.
Linking images
Often, gallery pages on the Web contain small thumbnail images that are linked to larger, 
high-resolution images. Like many web conventions, there are practical reasons for this format. 
Because all the images on a gallery page must be downloaded by visitors in order to view the 
page, small images are necessary to keep the page from taking too long to load. Additionally, 
a user’s screen isn’t large enough to accommodate multiple large pictures at one time. Giving 
your visitor a way to preview which pictures they would like to see on a larger scale makes the 
page more user friendly and interactive.
Follow these steps to link images in your gallery page
Step-by-Step
1.	 In products.html, click on the image of the beets to select it. In the Property Inspector, 
type images/beets_large.jpg into the Link text field. Press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS).
Manually typing in the link is one way to link to the image, but can introduce errors. 
Here is a second method using Dreamweaver’s Point to File feature.

Image maps
If you would like to add active links within a graphic , then you need to turn to image 
maps. Sometimes called “hotspots,” an image map is one or more defined areas within a 
graphic that are hyperlinked to unique documents. For example, imagine a graphic that 
displays the United States. You would like your user to be able to click on any one of the 
states in the image and navigate to a unique HTML page. You can accomplish this with 
Dreamweaver’s hotspot tools.
The three hotspot tools are the circle, rectangle and polygon. Each of these tools will 
allow you to draw an area on top of an image and then link to a document. In the map 
example above, if there were a square or rectangle-shaped state (like Kansas) you could 
use the rectangle hotspot tool. If there were such a thing as a circular or oval state you 
could use the circle hotspot tool. Most useful in this example would be the polygon 
hotspot tool which lets you create multi-sided hotspots, so you could trace the borders of 
Massachusetts for example.
To create an image map area
1.	 Select an image in the Design view of a page that you would like to add a hotspot. 
When the image is selected in the bottom half of the Properties panel you will see 
the map section. (If you do not see this section it may be collapsed from view. Click 
on the white arrow in the lower-right corner of the Properties panel to expand it.)
2.	 Select either the rectangle, circle or polygon hotspot tool and draw the shape over 
the area you would like to make active. When you first click, a dialog box will 
appear prompting you to add “alt” text for your image map. Click OK.
Alt text helps with the accessibility of your page by adding a text description that can 
be read by screen readers.
Note: If you are using the polygon hotspot tool click in the image to set the starting 
point. Position the pointer where you want the first straight segment to end, and 
click. Continue clicking to set endpoints for subsequent segments. 
3.	 If necessary, you may reshape the boundaries of the hotspot by clicking on the 
Pointer hotspot tool then clicking and dragging any of the anchor points that appear. 
4.	 When done drawing and modifying your shape with your shape type relevant text 
into the Alt field that appears in the Hotspot section of the Properties Panel. 
5.	 To add a link to document, you may either type a url in the Link field or use the 
Point to File icon or Browse for File button just like you would with a standard 
hyperlink. 
6.	 Locate the Map field in the Properties panel and type an appropriate name for your 
image map. This map name is used for a single map and should be unique, especially 
if you have more than one image map on a page.

Using image placeholders

Lesson 3
Using image placeholders
Often, you will want to start building web pages before you have all the final content available. 
This happens regularly in professional situations where different people may be responsible for 
preparing images, writing copy, and creating the site. Next, you’ll build a second section in the 
products.html page that will eventually include a collection of chocolate pictures.
Follow these steps to create an image placeholder
Step-by-Step
1.	 In Dreamweaver, on the products.html page, place your cursor to the right of the eggplants 
image, and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to create a new line.
2.	 Type Chocolate, then press the HTML button in the Property Inspector and choose 
Heading 2 from the Format drop-down menu. Place your cursor at the end of the word 
Chocolate and press Enter/Return to create a line below this new heading.
3.	 Choose Insert > Image Objects > Image Placeholder. When the Image Placeholder dialog 
box appears, type belgianchocolate in the Name text field, 300 in the Width text field, 
and 200 in the Height text field. Leave the Color set to the default and the Alternative text 
field blank. Press OK to exit the dialog box.
A gray box with the name belgianchocolate appears as seen in Figure 3-21. This box 
is simply an <img> tag with an empty Src attribute. If you are new to web design, it’s 
important to note that placeholders are not required, but they are useful in allowing you to 
visualize a page when you don’t have images available. Now you’ll insert an image into the 
placeholder by setting the Src attribute in the Property Inspector.
Figure 3-21: The belgianchocolate image placeholder.
4.	 With the belgianchocolate image placeholder selected, click and drag the Point to File icon 
to the right of the Src text field and locate the belgianchocolate.jpg image. The image of 
the Belgian chocolate replaces the gray box.
5.	 In the Property Inspector, use the Point to File icon of the Link text field to link 
belgianchocolate.jpg to belgianchocolate_large.jpg. Choose File > Save and leave this 
file open for the next part of this lesson.

Editing images
Editing images
Although it’s best to make adjustments to your images using a professional graphics-editing 
program like Adobe Photoshop, sometimes that’s not an option. Dreamweaver offers a number 
of editing options, including an Edit link that allows you to quickly open a selected image in 
the graphics editor of your choice.
Take Note...
The Edit button can be customized in the File Types/Editors section of the Preferences dialog 
box, found under the Dreamweaver drop-down menu. You can use this section to add or 
subtract programs from the list of available editors, and set programs as the primary choice for 
handling specific file extensions. 
Adjusting brightness and contrast
Now you’ll use Dreamweaver’s Brightness and Contrast button to lighten up the eggplants 
image on your products page.
Follow these steps to edit an image
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click on the eggplants.jpg image in products.html to select it, then click on the 
Brightness and Contrast button in the Property Inspector as seen in Figure 3-22.
Figure 3-22: Select the Brightness and Contrast button in the Property Inspector.
A warning dialog box appears, indicating that you are about to make permanent changes 
to the selected image. Press OK.
2.	 When the Brightness/Contrast dialog box appears, drag the Brightness slider to 20 or type 
20 in the text field to the right of the slider.
3.	 Drag the Contrast slider to 10 or type 10 in the text field to the right of the slider.
4.	 Click the Preview checkbox in the lower-right corner to see the original photo. Click the 
Preview checkbox again to see the changes. Press OK.
Take Note...
While changing the brightness and contrast is very convenient in Dreamweaver, you should be 
sure you are not performing the corrections on the original, as these changes are destructive.

Editing images

Lesson 3
Optimizing images
In most cases, if you need to have fine control over the appearance of your graphics, you should 
open an image editor designed for that purpose. Both Dreamweaver and Photoshop are made 
by Adobe, and you’ll see some of the integration between the two in this exercise. However, 
sometimes you will just want to make a quick-and-easy change to a graphic. In this scenario, 
you can use the Edit Image Settings option in the Property Inspector.
You’ll use this feature to change the optimization of the belgianchocolate.jpg image, but before 
you make any permanent changes, you’ll duplicate this image in the Files panel. It’s good 
practice to save copies of your image files before making permanent changes. Later, you’ll use 
this backup copy to undo your changes.
Follow these steps to optimize an image
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, click on the belgianchocolate.jpg file to select it. From the Files panel 
menu (
), select Edit > Duplicate. A new file named belgianchocolate - Copy.jpg appears in 
the list of files inside the images folder.
2.	 Click on the belgianchocolate.jpg image in the document window to make sure it 
is selected, then click the Edit Image Settings button (
) in the Property Inspector at 
the bottom of your page. The Image Optimization window appears (Figure 3-23). This 
window allows you to either choose from a number of compression presets, or to create 
your own. Currently, the format is set to JPEG because Dreamweaver recognizes the type 
of file you have selected. Notice in the bottom-left corner that the file size is listed; in this 
case, 31k. Pay attention to this number as it plays a role in the rest of this exercise.
Figure 3-23: The Image Optimization window appears when  
you click on the Edit Image Settings button.
3.	 Click the preset menu and choose GIF for Background Images. The optimization settings 
appear. Click the Color menu and choose 4. The image of the chocolate changes to a 
preview of these settings, and the image has become flat with most of the detail removed. 
Notice that the file size has changed to 3K.
This tells you that you would achieve a tremendous reduction in file size, but it would 
occur at the expense of image quality. In fact, the GIF file format is not generally suited 
for photographic images. You will now try a custom setting.

Lesson 3
103
Lesson 3: Adding Text and Images
Editing images
4.	 Click the Format menu and choose JPEG from the list. You now have a slider for quality, 
the default value is 80 and you can see the file size has changed to 9K. Drag the slider to 
the left to a quality of 10 and notice that the image quality changes instantly. Again, this is 
too drastic a trade-off. Drag the quality slider to 90. The image looks slightly better than it 
did at a quality of 80, and you have a file size of around 14K (which is approximately 50% 
of the original image).
Click OK to commit the change. Note that this method of optimization is risky if you do 
not have a backup. (Recall the backup created in step 1.) 
5.	 You can also choose to do your optimization in Photoshop. Click the cucumbers image, 
and then in the Property Inspector, click the Photoshop icon if available (Figure 3-24). 
Note that you must have Photoshop installed for this icon to be visible. As noted earlier, 
you can always change the photo editor that Dreamweaver uses by opening Edit > 
Preferences > File Types/Editors (PC) or Dreamweaver > Preferences > File Types/
Editors (Mac), and then changing the application associated with images.
Figure 3-24: Click on the Photoshop icon to launch Photoshop.
In addition to integration with Photoshop images, Dreamweaver will also integrate with 
Fireworks and Flash assets as well. PNG assets will be associated with Fireworks by default 
and SWF files can be associated with Flash’s FLA format in a similar manner.
6.	 The image will open in Photoshop, and then you can make any changes you want, as well 
as use the more in-depth controls of the Save for Web feature. We will not walk through 
that process now, so you can close this image and return to Dreamweaver.
Photoshop Smart Objects
Photoshop’s .psd format is not a valid file type for the web, however you can insert a .psd 
file using Dreamweaver’s Smart Objects feature. Inserting a native Photoshop file into 
Dreamweaver will trigger an automatic conversion into a suitable web graphic such as 
JPG, PNG, or GIF. The original PSD file is still linked, however, and the converted.
Smart Objects are labeled with a unique icon in Dreamweaver’s design view. 
If the source Photoshop file is modified for any reason then a red arrow appears on the 
image in Dreamweaver to indicate that the file has changed. You can then click the 
Update from Original button in the Property Inspector and the latest version of the 
image will be updated.

belgianchocolate - Copy.jpg in the Files panel and choose File > Rename. Type 
belgianchocolate_original.jpg and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
2.	 Click on the chocolate image in the Design view to select it. In the Property Inspector at 
the bottom of your page, highlight the text that reads images/belgianchocolate.jpg in the Src 
text field. 
3.	 Click and drag the Point to File icon to the belgianchocolate_original.jpg image you 
just renamed. The compressed image is replaced with the copy you made earlier.

The owners at Organic Utopia are discovering that they’d like to have more 
elaborate text in terms of how the text is presented on the screen. They’d like to 
have list items that stand out on their own aside from the body copy, and they’d 
like the hyperlinks to be a bit more prominent with the use of custom colors. 
Another thing they’ll need is the ability to modify the text globally. To build the 
workflow for this, a more in-depth understanding of style sheets is going to be 
necessary, especially the ability to create external style sheet files.

Lesson 4
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
In the last lesson you had a brief introduction to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS); now you will 
dive in a bit deeper. CSS is a simple language that works alongside HTML to apply formatting 
to content in web pages, such as text, images, tables, and form elements. Developed by the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), CSS creates rules, or style instructions, that elements 
on your page follow. There are three locations for CSS: 1) An internal style sheet where the 
styles are located directly within the <head> section of an HTML document, 2) inline styles 
(the CSS is located side by side with your HTML tags), or 3) An external style sheet where 
styles are located in an external file that can be linked to any number of HTML pages. If you 
completed Lesson 3, you have had experience with the first option. 
A style sheet is a collection of CSS rules; typically, rules that belong to a specific project, 
theme, or section are grouped together, but you can group rules in any way you want. You 
can place style sheets directly within your page using the <style> tag or in an external .css 
file that is linked to your document with the <link> tag. A single page or set of pages can use 
several style sheets at once.
You can apply CSS rules selectively to any number of elements on a page, or use them to 
modify the appearance of an existing HTML tag. Each CSS rule is composed of one or more 
declarations. A declaration contains both a property and a value. Examples of properties 
include color, width, and font size. Examples of values for these properties are green, 450px, 
and 12px, respectively. Dreamweaver’s CSS Styles panel lets you easily view and modify any 
of these properties and values and change the appearance of your page in real time.
This sample rule is composed of three declarations that control the color, typeface, and size of 
any text to which it’s applied. In the simplest example, the CSS rules define the appearance of 
an H1 or heading element:
h1 {
color: red;
font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Sans-serif;
font-size: 28px;
}
Here is the result of the preceding code snippet applied to text:
CSS-styled text shown in the Design view.
CSS rules can affect properties as simple as typeface, size, and color, or as complex as 
positioning and visibility. Dreamweaver uses CSS as the primary method of styling page text 
and elements, and its detailed CSS Styles panel makes it possible to create and manage styles at 
any point during a project.

Lesson 4: Styling Your Pages with CSS
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
The different levels of CSS
Just like HTML, CSS is an evolving language. The “rules” for how to use a language 
such as HTML or CSS are contained in a master document called a specification. There 
is no single specification for CSS, instead it has been broken down into levels. Currently 
there are 3 levels of CSS commonly referred to as CSS1, CSS2 and CSS3. It is important 
to have a passing knowledge of these levels as it will impact what design features you can 
reliably use in your page designs.
CSS1
The specification for how to use CSS was first released to the world in 1996 with this 
version and although many of the fundamentals of the language are the same, most 
people consider CSS 1.0 to be obsolete and rely on the CSS 2.0 specification.
CSS2
CSS2 builds on CSS1 and with few exceptions all valid CSS1 style sheets are valid CSS2 
style sheets. Anyone building a website in the 21st century has most likely used the CSS2 
specification (There is also a CSS 2.1 specification). However, the main consideration to 
keep in mind is that just because something is defined in the specification does not mean 
it has always worked in web browsers. For example a concept called “Css child selectors” 
was introduced in this specification but browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 did not 
support it correctly (or at all). Therefore, although officially included in the specification, 
in real world use CSS child selectors were avoided until there was a wider level of 
browser support. (Internet Explorer 7 and above do support CSS child selectors.)
CSS3
CSS3 is the latest version of CSS and includes many features that are either completely 
different than those or CSS2 or are improved features found in CSS2. For example CSS3 
media queries (covered in Lesson 15 “Mobile Design and Layout”) were completely 
new whereas CSS3 border radius improves the functionality of the border property 
introduced in CSS1 and CSS2. CSS3 is still very much a work in progress and although 
many of the features can be relied on to work in modern browsers there are also many 
that do not work in any browser reliably or have partial support.

CSS replaces inefficient HTML styling
Before CSS came along, you styled text on a page using the <font> tag in HTML; you could 
wrap this tag around any paragraph, phrase, or tidbit of text to apply color, or to set the font 
size and typeface. Although it was reliable, it was also very inefficient. Imagine a page with 
10 paragraphs. Using the <font> tag, you would have to add the <font> tag 10 times, even if

the color, size, and typeface values were exactly the same. Although the <font> tag is not in 
use as much anymore, you should still understand how it works. You will now open an HTML 
document in which the list is styled using the <font> tag.
Follow these steps to get an idea of the inefficiency of HTML-only code
Step-by-Step
1.	 In your Files panel located in the lower-right corner of your screen, locate and double-
click the HTML file named FontTagList.html to open it in the document window. 
2.	 Press the Code View button in the Document toolbar at the top of the document window. 
Notice that the <font> tag is used to style the items in the bulleted list (Figure 4-1).
Figure 4-1: Here, a <font> tag is used to format each bullet point. If you add more bullet points, you’ll need to  
use more <font> tags to keep the style of those bullets consistent with the others.
As you can see, there’s a lot of repetition in this code. 
3.	 Press the Design View button on the Document toolbar. Position your cursor at the end of 
the last bulleted item, press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to add a new bullet point, 
and type Peppers. You see that the text reverts to the default typeface, size, and color as 
seen in Figure 4-2. You would have to add a new <font> tag with the same attributes as the 
others to get it to match. If you wanted to change an attribute such as the color for all the 
bullet points, you would have to adjust each tag separately. In early versions of Dreamweaver, 
there were actually ways to perform global changes using HTML; however, these were 
sometimes tricky to control, and CSS offers a better solution in any case.

What are Cascading Style Sheets?
The benefits of CSS styling
CSS introduces a new level of control and flexibility far beyond the <font> tags in HTML. A 
significant benefit of CSS is the ability to apply consistent formatting of elements across one or 
all pages in a website. In the following exercises, you will learn a few different ways to create 
CSS rules that affect the style of your text. The first method you will explore involves creating 
tag- or element-based style rules. If you completed Lesson 3, you saw this method used to 
format text. This type of rule alters the appearance of an existing HTML tag, so the tag and 
any content that appears within it always appears formatted in a specific way. Instead of having 
to add a <font> tag around the contents of each new bullet point in a list, it would be easier 
for you to set a rule that states that items in a list should always be blue, for example. 
Follow these steps to get an idea of the benefits of CSS
Step-by-Step
1.	 Locate and double-click the file named CSSList.html from the Files panel to open it.
2.	 Press the Design View button in the Document toolbar if necessary. The list that appears 
onscreen, unlike the one you saw in the previous example, is formatted without the use of 
<font> tags, and uses only CSS.
3.	 Position your cursor after the last bulleted item and press the Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) key to create a new bullet point. Type in Peppers. The new text matches the 
bullet points above it. 
4.	 Press Enter/Return again to add a fifth bullet point, and type Okra. 
No matter how many bullet points you add, the formatting is applied automatically every 
time.
5.	 Select Split view at the top of the document window so that you can see both code and 
design (Figure 4-3):
Figure 4-3: CSS allows you to define a style rule for a list item. All list items on this page will be blue.
What you’ll notice is the absence of any formatting tags like the <font> tags you saw 
in the last exercise. In this example, you have several list items; however, all the styling 
information, such as the font-family, size, font style, and color, is being defined in one 
place: the CSS rule for the <li> tag. 
6.	 If necessary, scroll to the top of the page and you’ll see the code that makes this possible:

What are Cascading Style Sheets?
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 4
<style type="text/css">
<!--
li {
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
font-size: 13px;
font-weight: bold;
color: #0000FF;
}
-->
</style>
In the code above, a CSS selector (seen here as li) is being used to define the style of all 
list items. It’s almost like a dress code for all <li> tags; they know that when they are 
used on the page, they must look a certain way. Best of all, if you need to modify their 
appearance, you make your changes to that single style rule at the top of the page. You 
will get a chance to do this shortly; however, let’s take a step back and look at how CSS is 
controlled in Dreamweaver.
7.	 Choose File > Save to save your work, then choose File > Close.
How do you create CSS rules in Dreamweaver?
In this exercise, you will take a tour of Dreamweaver’s CSS controls. If you haven’t worked 
with CSS before, this is a chance to learn a bit more about how it works. If you have worked 
with CSS previously, this section will help you understand the Dreamweaver interface and 
how it applies to familiar concepts. Regardless of your comfort level with CSS, you won’t 
be making any changes, merely getting familiar with features that you will be using in later 
exercises.
You work with CSS rules in a few ways in Dreamweaver:
Using the CSS Styles panel
You can use Dreamweaver’s CSS Styles panel to create new rules and/or style sheets that you 
can place directly within one or more pages in your site. You can easily modify rules directly 
from the CSS Styles panel. Furthermore, you can selectively apply rules from several places, 
including the Style or Class menu on the Property Inspector, or the tag selector at the bottom 
of the document window.

Lesson 4: Styling Your Pages with CSS
What are Cascading Style Sheets?
Creating styles using the Property Inspector
Whenever you format text directly on your page using the Property Inspector, Dreamweaver 
saves your settings as a new rule, which you have to name in your document. Rules that 
Dreamweaver creates appear in your CSS panel, where you can easily modify or rename them.
Follow these steps to create a style using the Property Inspector
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click in the second paragraph, Hi there! I’m styled with an embedded, or INTERNAL style 
sheet!
2.	 In the Property Inspector at the bottom of the screen, press the HTML button if necessary. 
This paragraph is styled using a CSS class named red. You’ll learn more about classes and 
how to create and modify them shortly.
3.	 Press the CSS button in the Property Inspector. You can see some of the properties of this 
rule here in the Inspector (Figure 4-6), and you can also create and modify them here as 
you did in the previous lesson.
Figure 4-6: CSS styles are automatically created when you format text with the Property Inspector.
4.	 In the CSS styles panel, you should be in the All view. If not, click this button now. If the 
style labeled .red is visible, click it now. (If it is not visible, click the + sign to the left of 
the <style> label.) Compare the Property Inspector with the CSS Styles panel: they are 
displaying the exact same information at the moment. However, as your styles become 
more complex, you will see that the Property Inspector only shows you the most common 
styles, whereas the CSS Styles panel always shows you all of them.

Lesson 4
In the Code view
CSS rules can also be created and modified directly in the Code view. Editing CSS in 
Dreamweaver’s Code view offers a great degree of control and is often called hand-coding. Many 
coders and designers prefer hand-coding because of this control, but it’s not for everyone. For 
example, when you work in the Code view misspellings or an incomplete knowledge of CSS 
syntax can easily break a page. 
Follow these steps to display the Code view
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click in the second paragraph if you are not currently inside it. Press the Code view 
button to view your page in Code view. If you haven’t worked with code previously, see if 
you can locate the second paragraph of HTML. (It has the class named “red.”) 
2.	 On the left side of the screen, notice that the line numbers are running from top to 
bottom; when working with code, each line has its own number, making it easy to refer to 
and locate objects.
On line 10, select the value red in the color property and then delete it. Now type 
#CE1A30 as seen in Figure 4-7. As soon as you start typing, Dreamweaver’s code-hinting 
appears, giving you a color picker. Code-hinting is a form of assistance from Dreamweaver 
that can make the task of typing code by hand a little easier. However, you can also ignore 
it, and you should for this exercise.
Figure 4-7: Modifying the CSS color property in Code View.
3.	 Press the Design view button. The text is still red, however it is using a hexadecimal color 
instead of a keyword. The danger of adding CSS properties by hand of course, is that if 
you mistype the value you may get a different color or no color at all.

through a small pop-up window. Additionally, it allows you to click on a property and edit it 
directly in the Split view.

Step-by-Step
1.	 Press Alt (Windows) or Command+Option (Mac OS) and click on the third paragraph. 
A small window appears, listing the properties of the CSS rule applying to this paragraph. 
The window lists the name of the style sheet, as well as the rule .greenText.
2.	 Place your cursor over the .greenText class, and the properties appear in a yellow pop-
up window as seen in Figure 4-8. This feature allows you to quickly view the properties 
without needing to move to the CSS Styles panel or go into Code view.
Figure 4-8: The Code Navigator displays the CSS rules applied  
to a paragraph.
Understanding Style Sheets
The term Cascading in Cascading Style Sheets alludes to the fact that styles can live in three 
different places, each of which has its strengths and weaknesses. You’ve actually been working 
with all three types of styles in the last exercise. The first paragraph is being defined with an 
inline style, the second with an internal style sheet, and the third with an external style sheet. 
Inline styles 
An inline style is a set of CSS properties defined directly in an HTML tag using the style 
attribute. These are slightly less common because you can’t reuse them easily, and reusability 
is one of the major benefits of CSS. Nevertheless, inline styles are a part of the CSS language, 
and you should know what they are.
Follow these steps to create an inline style
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the file StylePlaces.html click three times rapidly to select the first paragraph. 
2.	 Press the Split view button, and notice that your selected text is nested inside a paragraph 
or <p> element; however, the CSS style rules for color, font-family, and font-size are 
contained directly inside the opening paragraph tag (Figure 4-9). This is called an inline 
style because the CSS rules are not separated from the HTML.

Lesson 4
Although inline styles are part of CSS, they are used infrequently. They present many of 
the same problems as the older <font> tags in HTML. They only apply to one tag at a 
time and are not easily reusable. So when are they used? Inline styles are useful when an 
internal or external style sheet may not be available; a good example of this is HTML-
based e-mail. They are also used in certain situations to override other styles, but you will 
learn more about this later.
Figure 4-9: An inline style places rules within a  
HTML opening tag.
Internal versus external style sheets
Internal style sheets are CSS rules that are contained directly within a document, using the 
<style> tag. The entire style sheet is contained within the opening and closing <style> tags. 
External style sheets are style rules saved in a separate document with the extension “.css.” One 
of the fundamental differences between internal and external style sheets is that with internal 
style sheets, the CSS rules apply only to the HTML in a single document. 
For example, if you had a ten-page website and could only use internal style sheets, you would 
essentially have ten style sheets: one per page. If you made a change on one page and then 
needed to make the other pages look the same, you would have to either copy or redefine 
internal styles from page to page—not an enjoyable prospect.
External style sheets, by contrast, have CSS rules located in one single document. You can 
attach .css files, or external style sheets, to an unlimited number of HTML pages. This method 
is extremely flexible: if a style rule such as the font-color for a paragraph is changed in the 
external style sheet, all paragraphs in the site are instantly modified, whether it be two pages, 
ten pages or 100 pages.
In Dreamweaver, when you create a new style, the default behavior is to use an internal style 
sheet. In many ways, a web browser doesn’t care which type of style sheet you use; it renders 
the page exactly the same. There are certain situations when an internal style sheet makes more 
sense than an external style sheet and vice-versa. You will explore this in more detail in later 
exercises, but first you need to know how to determine whether a style is internal or external. 
Follow these steps to determine if a style sheet is internal or external
Step-by-Step
1.	 Open StylePlaces.html if you do not already have it open and click the Design View 
button to enter the Design view. In the CSS Styles panel, click on the All button if 
necessary. In the top half of the screen you will see a listing for <style> and one for 
StylePlacesCSS.css. The first line is the internal style sheet, and the second is for the 
external style sheet.
2.	 If necessary, click the arrow to the left of the plus sign (Windows) or the arrow (Mac OS) 
to the left of the <style> option, and it expands to show you the rule for the class red. 
Again, if necessary, click the arrow to the left of StylePlacesCSS.css to expand this and 
see the rule for the class .greenText. You may have noticed that the listing for the inline 
style is not here; only rules for internal and external style sheets are visible in All mode.
In the last exercise, you used the Code Navigator to view the CSS rules applied to a 
paragraph. You can also use the Code Navigator to quickly determine where the CSS 
rules are located.

Lesson 4

What are Cascading Style Sheets?
3.	 Back in Design view, Alt+click (Windows) or Command+Option+click (Mac OS) inside 
the second paragraph to open the Code Navigator. The window reads StylePlaces.html 
and the class .red is indented below it as seenin Figure 4-10. If a style is located inside an 
HTML document, as it is in this case, it must be an internal style.
Figure 4-10: The Code Navigator has located the origin  
of this CSS rule to be in StylePlaces.html.
4.	 Place your cursor over the .red class, and all the properties appear; this is a quick way to 
determine the properties.
5.	 Click on the .red rule, and Dreamweaver’s Split view opens, sending you directly to the 
internal style. An experienced hand-coder might use this to directly edit the rule as you 
did earlier, although you will not be making any changes at this point. Now you will look 
at the external style sheet again using the Code Navigator.
6.	 Alt+click (Windows) or Command+Option+click (Mac OS) in the third paragraph to 
open the Code Navigator.
7.	 This time, the Code Navigator window lists StylePlacesCSS.css first. If a style is located 
inside a .css document, as it is in this case, it is an external style. Place your cursor over the 
.greenText class, and all the properties appear.
8.	 Click on the .greenText class, and in the Split view, the external style sheet 
StylePlacesCSS.css appears (Figure 4-11). Doing this actually opens the external style 
sheet, which is a separate document. 
Figure 4-11: An External Style Sheet is a separate document with the extension .css.
To return to the original HTML document, press the Source Code button immediately to 
the left of the button labeled StylePlacesCSS.css.
9.	 Choose File > Save All. Close this document for now. Choosing Save All saves not just the 
HTML document but the external stylesheet at the same time.
Understanding why they’re called Cascading
You have learned how CSS integrates with HTML, and that there are three categories of 
styles: inline, internal, and external. Additionally, you have seen that an HTML document, 
such as the one from the last exercise, can contain all three types. Now you’ll begin to explore 
when you might use one type over the other. A good way to look at this is to ask the question: 
Which one of the three style types is most dominant?

Creating and modifying styles 
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
122
Lesson 4
To help you picture this, consider the following situation: you have a paragraph, or more 
accurately, a <p> tag in your document, and you have the three style types (inline, internal, 
and external). Each one targets the <p> tag with the same property (color, for example) but 
they all have different values. So which one wins? The answer is the inline style, which is the 
most dominant because it is closest to the HTML source. The strength of competing styles is 
largely related to where the style is in relation to the HTML source. For internal and external 
styles, if they have competing rules, whichever style comes last within the HTML is the 
strongest. So in the following scenario, imagine that there is a paragraph style in the external 
style sheet (styles.css) declaring paragraphs to be blue. Because it comes after the internal style 
sheet’s rule for red paragraphs, the external style sheet “wins” and the paragraph is blue.
<style type="text/css">
p {
color: red;
}
</style>
<link href=" styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
However it is equally possible that the author of the HTML has arranged the styles in a 
different order:
<link href=" styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<style type="text/css">
p {
color: red;
}
</style>
Here, the paragraphs will be red because the internal style sheet comes last in the HTML code. 
There is no default order of styles in the documents that Dreamweaver creates, so you do need 
to be aware of this rule.
Take Note...
We have simplified the relationship for now. The strength of internal styles versus external 
styles can actually change depending on where the references to these styles are in the HTML. 
If the reference to the internal style sheet appears last in the HTML, these rules would be 
strongest. If the reference to the external style appears last in the HTML, then these would be 
the strongest.
Creating and modifying styles 
You will now get a chance to begin working more deeply with CSS. In this exercise, you’ll 
be picking up where you left off in the last lesson with the events page for the OrganicUtopia 
website. In that lesson, you covered the creation of new CSS rules; however, you essentially 
worked with just one category of CSS rules, the element or tag-based rules. In all instances 
from the last lesson, you defined the properties for a tag, such as <h1>, <p>, and <ul> 
(unordered lists). You will now explore how to create classes and IDs. First, a brief review of 
the styles you used in the last lesson for tag styles.
A tag style assigns rules directly to a specific HTML tag to alter its appearance. You can attach 
tag styles to any tag from the <body> tag down; as a matter of fact, when you modify page 
properties (Modify > Page Properties) to change default text formatting and background color, 
you are using a tag style assigned to the <body> tag.

Lesson 4: Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
The most basic tag styles are very straightforward. For instance, when you create a 
rule definition for the <p> (paragraph) tag, all paragraphs appear the same. The limitations 
begin when you want to customize one specific paragraph to appear different from the others. 
You will explore some solutions to this dilemma; for now, keep in mind that tag styles are 
a great way to ensure consistency across multiple elements and pages where specific tags are 
used, such as lists, tables, and paragraphs.
Follow these steps to modify a style
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click the events.html file in the Files panel to open it. This page has already had 
its Heading 1, paragraph, and list styled. You will now style the Heading 2.
2.	 In the Design view, click inside the heading Spring Events. This is already formatted as a 
Heading 2 for you.
3.	 Click the CSS button in the left side of the Property Inspector; this allows you to define 
the properties of the Heading.
4.	 Choose 18 from the Size drop-down menu on the Property Inspector, and the New CSS 
Rule dialog box appears. From the Choose a contextual selector type for your CSS rule 
drop-down menu, choose Tag. In the Selector Name text field, the selector h2 has been 
chosen for you as seen in Figure 4-12. Dreamweaver does this because you placed your 
cursor inside the text formatted as h2. Press OK. Now you can add additional properties, 
and Dreamweaver adds them to the definition of the h2 tag.
Figure 4-12: Defining a Heading 2 for the first time causes the New CSS Rule  
dialog box to appear.
5.	 In the Property Inspector, click on the color swatch to choose a color for your text from the 
Swatches panel that appears. Select a dark green. The color #390, located in the top row, is 
used in this example. Your heading now changes to green. You have just styled the font-size 
and color of the <h2> tag. At this point, all text formatted as h2 appears this way. You will 
now format the last heading in the page in order to see this.
6.	 Click inside the text, Rent our facility. In the Property Inspector, click the HTML 
button. You need to toggle into this view because you now want to change the HTML 
formatting, not the CSS.

Creating and modifying styles 
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
124
Lesson 4
7.	 In the Property Inspector, note that the Format for this text is currently set to None. From 
the Format drop-down menu, choose Heading 2 (as seen in Figure 4-13) to see your text 
change.
Figure 4-13: Formatting text as a Heading 2 assumes the properties of the CSS rule.
What you have seen in this exercise is an example of HTML and CSS working together 
with a tag style. In this case, all text tagged in the HTML as a Heading 2 or <h2> is 
defined by the CSS rule as green and 18 pixels. At this point you may be itching to create 
more complex layouts; if you understand the fundamentals of styling tags, it will pay off as 
you move to the next level of CSS. 
8.	 Choose File > Save but keep this file open. You will be working on it in the next exercise.
Creating a class style with the Property Inspector
In the last exercise, you created a new CSS rule by defining the properties of the <h2> tag. 
Now you will create another CSS rule, this time using a class. In CSS, class styles have unique 
names and are not associated with any specific HTML tag. A CSS class can have a specific 
style that can be applied to one or more elements in your website. So you might create a 
class called holidayText, for example, and the properties of this class might be a single 
rule defining the font-color. Once the class is created, this text could then be applied to a 
table, paragraph, heading, or form element simultaneously. So on Halloween, if you change 
the property of the font-color to orange, all text that is defined by the holidayText class 
is orange, and on Valentine’s Day, if you change the property of the font-color to red, it all 
changes to red. 
In this exercise, you will create a class for the copyright text at the bottom of the page in order 
to distinguish it from the rest of the page.

Lesson 4

Lesson 4: Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
Follow these steps to create a class style
Step-by-Step
1.	 Locate the paragraph at the very bottom of your page, click immediately before the 
copyright symbol, and then drag across until the two lines are selected.
2.	 Press the CSS button in the Property Inspector if necessary; note that this text has a size 
of 14 pixels and a dark gray color. This is because these are paragraphs and the CSS rules 
for paragraphs in this document currently have these properties. You will now format all 
this text with a different size and font, and then add a background color. First notice the 
section of the Property Inspector labeled Targeted Rule and note that it is set to <New 
CSS Rule> as seen in Figure 4-14.
Figure 4-14: The Targeted Rule is set to <New CSS Rule>.
Because CSS is so flexible, you often have many options for styling. Here, Dreamweaver 
is telling you that a new rule will be created. The other option is that you could update 
the paragraph rule that already exists. You can see this option by clicking the menu and 
noting the “p” rule in the Cascade section. For now, make sure that New CSS Rule is still 
selected.
3.	 In the Property Inspector, click on the drop-down menu for Size and change the size 
from 14 pixels to 10 pixels. The New CSS Rule dialog box appears. The default choice 
for Selector Type is Class, which is what you would like to use. Classes, unlike the Tag 
styles you have been using, must be named; additionally, you must name the class, as 
Dreamweaver does not do it for you. 
Take Note...
Older versions of Dreamweaver automatically assigned generic names to new classes, such as 
.style1, .style2, and so on. In recent versions of Dreamweaver when it comes to styles, 
users are now required to name CSS classes. Although this may seem to be an extra step, it is 
a good one. By being forced to assign names to styles, users are more aware of the code they are 
generating, which makes their web pages easier to maintain.

Lesson 4
4.	 In the Selector Name field, type copyright. As you type, notice that Dreamweaver 
adds the text, This selector name will apply your rule to all HTML elements with class 
“copyright.” (Figure 4-15) This is Dreamweaver’s way of helping you understand how 
your new class can be applied.
Figure 4-15: Set the rules for the new copyright class.
5.	 Press OK. You now see the text formatted at 10 pixels. Once the class is created, you can 
add other properties.
6.	 Click once in the first line of the copyright text. Notice in the Property Inspector, in 
the Targeted Rule section, the menu is now set for .copyright. This is important, as it 
confirms that you are modifying the class, not creating a new rule or modifying the 
paragraph tag style. In the Property Inspector, choose Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif from 
the Font menu to add this property to the copyright class. Now you’ll add a new line of 
text and apply the copyright class to it.
7.	 Place your cursor at the end of the last line of the paragraph and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS) to add a new line. Type the following text: All images on this 
website are the copyright of Glenn “The Hodge” Hodgkinson. Notice that the 
text is still using the copyright style. If you wanted to remove this class for any reason, you 
could click on the Targeted Rule drop-down menu and choose Remove Class.
Creating and modifying styles in the CSS Styles panel
Using the Property Inspector is a quick-and-easy way to create and apply styles and make some 
basic formatting choices; however, the number of style choices in the Property Inspector is 
very limited. To take advantage of the full power of CSS, you will begin to dive into the CSS 
Styles panel. In this exercise, you’ll explore some of the powerful options that CSS has at its 
disposal. The first thing you’ll do is change the background color of your page by adding a

7.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box that appears, click the Background Category, click 
on the Background-color swatch, and choose white (#FFF) from the list. Press OK. The 
two copyright paragraphs at the bottom of the page are styled with white backgrounds. The 
gap between the two paragraphs reveals the background color because these are separate 
paragraphs, and are both block elements. The gap is somewhat visually unappealing and is 
something you will be fixing a bit later in the lesson. 
Advanced text formatting with CSS
Text on the Web is necessarily limited due to the fact that designers cannot assume that 
fonts they choose in Dreamweaver will be available to the user. There is a small set of fonts 
that designers can use that are essentially guaranteed to be on all users’ systems. Given this 
limitation, you can use some of the properties in CSS to give your text a distinctive look. In 
this exercise, you will work with the line spacing of your paragraphs and lists, and the letter 
spacing of your headings. 
Take Note...
The limitations on web fonts are slowly changing, and in Dreamweaver CS6, there is now a new 
feature that allows you access to a wider range of font choices. For now, it is still important to learn 
the basics. We cover the new web fonts feature in Lesson 7, “CSS3 Transitions and Web Fonts.”

Lesson 4
129
Lesson 4: Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
Follow these steps to explore advanced text formatting with CSS
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS panel, double-click the rule for p (paragraph) to open the CSS Rule definition 
dialog box. You will now override the default line-height for your paragraphs. If you 
have a print background, you may be familiar with leading, which is the amount of space 
between the lines in a paragraph. Line-height is the same thing as leading.
2.	 In the Line-height field, type 20; the value is automatically set for pixels. Press Apply, and 
you will see the space between your paragraph lines increase. Extra line-height can often 
make your text more readable, so it is great that you have this option in CSS. However, a 
problem may arise if you change the font-size. For example, setting the fixed value of 20 
pixels looks good with 14-pixel type, but what if you were to later change the font-size 
of your paragraph? The 20-pixel line-height would look strange. A more flexible way to 
assign line-height is to use a percentage.
3.	 From Line-height drop-down menu to the right of the text field, choose percent (%). 
Change the value from 20 to 120, (as seen in Figure 4-18) and press Apply. You won’t 
actually see a dramatic difference because the end result is similar, but by assigning the 
line-height to 120 percent, your initial font-size isn’t as important. There will always be 
the height of the line plus 20 percent extra, no matter what the font-size is. Press OK.
Figure 4-18: Changing the line-height value of a paragraph to a percentage  
is more flexible than using pixels.
Notice that the list under Spring Events did not change. This is because the line-height 
property applies solely to paragraphs, not lists. If you want to make this list appear the same, 
you could always apply the same value of line-height. However, you will be adding extra 
space between the lines to make the list stand out from the rest of the page.
4.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click on the ul rule. The CSS Rule definition dialog 
box appears. In the field for line-height, type 150; then from the drop-down menu to the 
right, select percentage (%). Press OK, and you now have extra space between your list 
items. Now you’ll style your Heading 2 element.

5.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the h2 rule. In the Text-transform section, click 
the menu, and from the list, choose uppercase. Press Apply, and you will see your two 
headings, Spring Events and Rent Our Facility!, transform to uppercase. This helps your 
headings stand out and is a lot faster than retyping these headings by hand. Now you’ll add 
some space between all the letters.
Take Note...
Transforming your text to uppercase is just a style; in the HTML, your original text still 
has the standard formatting. One of the few times this might be an issue is if your web page 
is being viewed without a style sheet; older cell phones and PDAs with web browsers do not 
fully support style sheets (or use them at all), and so your text would appear lowercase as it is 
in the HTML.
6.	 Select the Block category in the CSS Rule definition dialog box. Block styles generally 
control the way text is displayed in the browser. In the field for Letter-spacing, type 5; 
then choose px from the drop-down menu to the right. Press Apply, and the two headings 
are extended. Each letter pair has 5 pixels of space between them. Press OK. When 
used well, letter-spacing can make your headings more readable and unique as seen in 
Figure 4-19.

Lesson 4: Styling Your Pages with CSS
Creating and modifying styles 
Fine-tuning page appearance with contextual and pseudo-class selectors
CSS allows you to create styles that are targeted at specific HTML elements on your page. 
Understanding these techniques is crucial if you want to gain control over the appearance of 
your page. Look at the Spring Events list on your page: lines 1 and 4 both begin with the word 
Free. Let’s say you wanted to emphasize this word to attract your user’s attention. You could 
simply bold the word, but what if you not only wanted to bold it, but change the color as well. 
It would be possible to create a class to do this, but there is another option that has some useful 
benefits called contextual selectors. 
Dreamweaver actually refers to contextual selectors, which is the official CSS term for them, 
as compound selectors. Despite the terminology, they are very powerful and important to 
understand.
Contextual selectors apply formatting to tags and classes when they appear in a specific 
combination. For instance, you often have separate rules for the <p> (paragraph) and 
<strong> (bold) tag, but what if you want a rule for <strong> tags that are used inside <p> 
tags? Contextual selectors can handle this; for instance, you can designate that any text inside a 
<strong> tag must be red, unless it is used within a <p> tag, in which case it should be blue. 
This breathes new life into your tag styles by multiplying the number of times you can use 
them in conjunction with each other. 
Follow these steps to create a selector
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the first line of the Spring Events list, select the word Free. Click the HTML button in 
the Property Inspector, then press the Bold button. (This actually creates a <strong> tag 
in the HTML.) Using the example from above, let’s say that simply bolding this wasn’t 
enough and you wanted to add some color.
2.	 Press the CSS button in the Property Inspector; then click the menu for Targeted Rule 
and choose <New CSS Rule>. You must do this; otherwise, when you choose a color, you 
will target the whole list, which is not what you want.
3.	 Click the color swatch in the Property Inspector and choose the dark green swatch in the 
top row, #030. The New CSS Rule dialog box appears.

4.	 From the Choose a contextual selector type for your CSS rule drop-down menu, choose 
Compound (based on your selection). In the Selector Name field, the text body ul li strong 
appears as seen in Figure 4-20. This may look strange at first, but it’s logical if you read 
it from left to right. The body tag is the ancestor, or parent, of the ul tag. The strong tag 
is referred to as a descendent selector. In other words, your style will only apply to strong 
tags, which are nested in a list item (which is nested in the unordered list, and so on). 
Figure 4-20: Set the Selector Type to Compound to create a contextual selector.
Take Note...
In the official specification of CSS, the term “descendent selectors” is used to define this ability 
to select elements that are descendents of another element in the document. 
Dreamweaver includes the body element in this rule, but it’s not necessary. Technically 
speaking, body is the ancestor of all tags in a document, so Dreamweaver wants to include 
it. There’s no harm in leaving it as is, but it is a little redundant. In any case, you have the 
option to shorten this code manually. 
5.	 Below the Selector Name section, click the Less Specific button, and the list of rules is 
shortened to ul li strong. This has no effect on the behavior of the rule. Press OK. The 
word Free is now bold and dark green. Deselect the text to see the final result. The rule is 
in place, and anything that is bold inside a list will have this appearance. You can see this 
now by bolding the word Free in the fourth line of the list.
6.	 Press the HTML button in the Property Inspector. Select the word Free in the fourth line 
and then press the Bold button in the Property Inspector. The word takes on the same 
appearance. Bolding anything else in the list causes it to have the same appearance, while 
bolding anything not in a list has only the default effect.

Styling hyperlinks
You’re slowly beginning to pull together a page with a color theme to it, even if there is no 
layout per se. A frequently asked question when people are learning to create web pages is how 
to style the hyperlinks on a page. This can be accomplished with CSS, although there are some 
precautions. Since the early days of CSS, the default style for unvisited hyperlinks has been a 
bright blue with an underline and a purple color with an underline for visited hyperlinks. An 
argument can be made that users might be confused by hyperlinks that do not fit this mold. 
On the other hand, many designers like being able to color their hyperlinks to match the rest 
of their page. Regardless of the debate, it’s important to understand how to do this. 
Technically speaking, hyperlinks live in a category called a pseudo-class. A pseudo-
class selector affects a part or state of a selected tag or class. A state often refers to an item’s 
appearance in response to something happening, such as the mouse pointer rolling over it. One 
of the most common pseudo-class selectors is applied to the <a> tag, which is used to create 
hyperlinks. You’ll now create a pseudo-class selector to affect the appearance of hyperlinks on 
the events.html page in different states:

menu; this is because Dreamweaver is attempting to create a compound rule, but in fact 
you are only interested in the last four options, which are a:link, a:visited, a:hover, 
and a:active. Choose a:link (as seen in Figure 4-21), which affects the appearance of a 
hyperlink when it hasn’t yet been visited. Press OK.
Figure 4-21: Set the Selector type to Compound and choose a:link  
from the Selector menu.
3.	 The CSS Rule definition dialog box appears. Under the Type category, click the color 
swatch next to Color and choose the green shade you used in the previous exercise (#030). 
Press OK, and the products link in the first paragraph as well as the two links at the 
bottom of the page are now green instead of blue. Now you’ll set the style for hover links, 
or a:hover.

4.	 Make sure that the products link in the first paragraph is selected and once again, choose 
New from the CSS Styles panel menu and the New CSS Rule dialog box opens. You will 
leave the state for the visited link alone for now. In this case, the default purple is fine. You 
will now change the state for a:hover, which defines the color of a hyperlink when a user 
places their cursor over it.
5.	 From the Choose a contextual selector type for your CSS rule drop-down menu, choose 
Compound. In the Selector Name section, choose a:hover from the drop-down menu, 
then press OK.
6.	 From the Type category, click the color swatch next to Color and select the bright orange 
approximately in the center of the Swatches panel (#C60). In the Text-decoration section, 
mark the last checkbox labeled none as seen in Figure 4-22. This removes the underline 
from the hyperlink for the hover state only. Press OK.

pointer rolls over them.
You can preview the appearance of the hyperlinks by clicking on the Live View button in 
the Application bar or opening your page in a browser.
7.	 Choose File > Save; then choose File > Preview in Browser and choose a browser from 
the list to launch it. Place your cursor over the products link, but don’t click it. This is the 
hover link. Click the products link to bring you to the products page, and then click back 
to the events page by clicking the Events link at the bottom of the page. The products link 
is now purple because the browser understands you have visited it.
You will leave off styling the a:active link for now. Setting the a:active property 
defines the way a link appears when it is being clicked on by a user. Close the web 
browser.
Div tags and CSS ID selectors
Your page is coming along nicely on the style front, as you have used quite a bit of CSS, but 
looking at your page, it’s fair to say that it is still lacking a cohesive style. All your various 
headings and paragraphs, as well as your list, are floating about on the page, and with the 
exception of the copyright text at the bottom of the page, it’s difficult at a single glance to 
get a sense of where one section ends and another begins. It’s time to add more structure to 
your page through the use of the <div> tag and more control of your CSS with ID selectors. 
CSS ID styles can be applied to any HTML element in a document. All class styles are 
displayed in the CSS Styles panel with a hash tag [#] preceding their name and in the Style 
pop-up menu of the text Property inspector. Unlike Class styles, ID styles can only be used 
one time per page.

Lesson 4: Styling Your Pages with CSS
Div tags and CSS ID selectors
Let’s look at the structure first. It would be nice to gather the text on the bottom of your page, 
starting with the line, Occasionally we gather…, and then the two paragraphs below, and put it all 
into a single section. You could then take this new section and style it separately from the rest 
of the page. This is possible with the <div> tag. In this exercise, you will begin by creating a 
footer ID.
Follow these steps to create  a div tag
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click and drag to select all the text from the line, Occasionally we gather…, down to the 
bottom of the page. You will be grouping these three paragraphs together.
2.	 Immediately above the CSS Styles panel is the Insert tab. Click on this once to open the 
Insert panel. If the drop-down menu is not set to Common, select Common from the 
menu now. In the Common section, press the Insert Div Tag (
) button, and the Insert 
Div Tag dialog box opens as seen in Figure 4-23. In the Insert section, the default choice is 
Wrap around selection; this is exactly what you want to do, so leave this option as is.
Figure 4-23: Press the Insert Div Tag button in the Common section of the  
Insert panel.
A <div> tag by itself doesn’t do anything until some CSS properties are attached to it. 
In other words, unlike other HTML tags, which often have a default visual effect in the 
browser (think of headings), the <div> tag has no effect on your rendered page unless you 
specifically instruct it to. You will now get to do this.
3.	 In the field labeled ID, type footer. Just like classes, IDs should have good, descriptive 
names to help identify them. You’ll now apply a background color of white to the entire 
block of text you selected. Notice that there is a field for class as well. Classes and IDs are 
very similar. The difference between them is that classes can be used multiple times on 
different elements on a page, whereas an ID can only be used once. In this case, an ID is 
appropriate because there is only one footer on this page.
4.	 Click the New CSS Rule button. You don’t need to change anything here; just confirm 
that you are creating an ID with the name footer. The footer name is preceded by the 
pound sign (#). This is the main difference between ID names and class names. If this 
were a class named footer, it would be named .footer. Press OK, and the CSS Rule 
definition dialog box appears.

Lesson 4
5.	 Select the Background category, then click the Background-color swatch. Choose the pure 
white swatch (#FFF) and press OK. Press OK again to close the Insert Div Tag dialog box. 
In Dreamweaver’s Design view, a box has appeared around the text and there is now a 
white background unifying the footer text as seen in Figure 4-25.
Figure 4-24: Set the Background-color to #FFF in the CSS Rule definition dialog box.
If you haven’t guessed by now, these are the first steps toward page layout with CSS. A 
footer is a common element on most pages, and there are a few other obvious ones as well: 
headers, sidebars, and navigation bars to name a few. You’ll begin working with these page 
structures more deeply in upcoming lessons, but first you’ll need to have some more control 
of the CSS rules that you’ve been working with this lesson.
Internal versus external style sheets
Now that you’ve seen how to modify a few items in a single page at once, you can imagine 
how powerful a style sheet shared by every page in your website can be. As noted earlier, when 
you create new CSS rules, you have the opportunity to define them in the current document 
or in a new CSS file. A collection of rules stored in a separate .css file is referred to as an 
external style sheet. You can attach external style sheets to any number of pages in a site so that 
they all share the same style rules. 
So far, you’ve created internal, or embedded, styles. This means you wrote the style rules 
directly into the page using the <style> tag. Although you can format a page with an internal 
style sheet, this method is not very portable. To apply the same rules in another page, you have 
to copy and paste the internal style sheet from one page to another. This can create inconsistency 
among pages if the same rule is updated in one page and not the other.
To utilize the true power of style sheets, you need to create an external style sheet that any or 
all pages on your site can share. When you change an external style, pages linked to that style 
sheet are updated. This is especially handy when working with sites containing many pages 
and sections.
You can create external style sheets in the following ways:
• Move rules from an internal style sheet into a new CSS file.
• Define styles in a page in a new document using the New CSS Rule panel.
• Create a new CSS document from the Start page or File menu.
Now you will export internal styles from your events.html page into a separate CSS file so that 
other pages may share them.

Step-by-Step
1.	 With the events.html document open, expand the style sheet shown in the CSS Styles 
panel so that you can see all the rules you have created. If you have limited screenspace, 
double-click the Insert panel to collapse it. Also remember you can expand a pane by 
clicking the bottom edge and dragging down.
2.	 Click the first rule below the <style> tag at the top of the panel and then scroll down if 
necessary to locate the last rule. Shift+click the last rule in the panel so that all the rules are 
selected. In the upper-right corner, press the CSS Styles panel menu button (
) and choose 
Move CSS Rules (Figure 4-26).
Figure 4-26: Select All rules in your style sheet and then choose  
Move CSS Rules.
3.	 The Move CSS Rules dialog box appears, asking if you want to move the styles to an 
existing or a new style sheet. Select A new style sheet and press OK.
4.	 A Save Style Sheet dialog box appears, asking you to choose a name and location for the 
new file that is about to be created. Name it mystyles, navigate to the root folder of your 
site (dw04lessons folder), and choose Save.
5.	 Look inside your CSS Styles panel and note that the new style sheet, mystyles.css, is 
listed and all the rules are nested within. The internal style sheet (shown as <style>) 
is still in your document, but it contains no rules. You can always click the plus sign 
(Windows) or arrow (Mac OS) to the left of mystyles.css to collapse or expand it.

Lesson 4
Attaching an external style sheet to your page
Dreamweaver automatically made the new external style sheet available to the current page by 
attaching it. However, you will have to link this style sheet to other pages in your site to use it. 
You can accomplish this with the Attach Style Sheet command in the CSS Styles panel.
Follow these steps to use an external CSS style sheet in your page
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click the products.html file from the Files panel. This page is a version of the 
products page you created in Lesson 3, “Adding Text and Images.” You will now link your 
new style sheet to this page. 
2.	 If necessary, click the All button in the CSS Styles panel, then at the bottom of the CSS 
Styles panel, click the Attach Style Sheet icon (
). The Attach Style Sheet panel appears.
3.	 Next to File/URL, click the Browse button to locate a style sheet file to attach. In the 
dw04lessons folder, select the mystyles.css file from the Select Style Sheet dialog box and 
press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS). The stylesheet is now listed in the File/URL 
field (Figure 4-27). Press OK to close the Attach External Style Sheet dialog box.
Figure 4-27: Adding an external style sheet.
The page refreshes with the styles defined in the external style sheet. You can also see that 
the CSS Styles panel shows that mystyles.css and all its rules are now available for use and 
editing.
Modifying attached style sheets
Because an attached style sheet appears in your CSS Styles panel, you can modify any of its 
rules and the changes will apply across other pages that share that style sheet. You’ll be another 
step closer to layout now by modifying the body property in order to add some margins to 
your page.
Follow these steps to modify an external style
Step-by-Step
1.	 If necessary, in the CSS Styles panel, click the plus sign (Windows) or arrow (Mac OS) to

2.	 Click the Box category and deselect the checkbox labeled Same for all in the Margin 
column as seen in Figure 4-28.
Figure 4-28: Deselect the checkbox in the Margin section of the Box category.
Because CSS is based on a box model, it treats every element as a container. Because the 
<body> tag is the largest container, if you modify its margins, it affects all the content 
on the page. You’ll specifically be changing the left and right margins to create a more 
centered layout.
3.	 In the Margin field labeled Right, type 15, and choose % from the drop-down menu.
4.	 In the Margin field labeled Left, type 15, and choose % from the menu (Figure 4-29). 
Press OK, and your content shifts toward the center.

5.	 Choose File > Save All, and then preview your page in the browser. You are able to 
navigate between the products page and the events page using the hyperlinks in each 
document. Shorten the width of your browser, and notice that the content adjusts 
accordingly. There will always be 15 percent space to the left of content in the browser 
window and 15 percent to the right, thereby centering your content. Open the events.

Lesson 4
Creating a new .css file (external style sheet)
Although it’s easy to move styles to a new .css file, you can also create styles in a new .css file 
from the beginning. The New CSS Rule dialog box gives you this option whenever you create 
a new rule. By creating styles in an external .css file, you can avoid the extra step of exporting 
them later and make the style sheet available to other pages immediately. 
Follow these steps to create a new .css file
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, double-click on the event1.html file. 
2.	 From the CSS Styles panel menu, choose New; the New CSS Rule dialog box appears.
3.	 Set the Selector Type as Tag, and choose body from the Tag drop-down menu if it is not 
automatically selected. At the bottom of the screen, click the Rule Definition menu and 
choose (New Style Sheet File) as seen in Figure 4-30; then press OK.
Figure 4-30: Creating a new external style sheet from scratch.
4.	 You are prompted to name and save the new .css file. Name it morestyles.css and save it 
in the root folder of your site.
5.	 When the CSS Rule definition dialog box appears, choose the Background category. Set 
the background color to light yellow, #FFC. Press OK to create the rule.
Your page’s background color should be yellow, and the CSS Styles panel reflects that the 
style was created in a new external style sheet. Now you can attach this style sheet to any 
other page in your site.

Skill Summary
More details on CSS
Inheritance
When you nest one rule inside another, the nested rule inherits properties from the rule 
in which it’s contained. For instance, if you define a font-size and font-family for all <p> 
tags, then it carries over to a class style used within the paragraph. This paragraph may 
not specify values for either property. It automatically inherits the font-size and font-
family from the <p> tag selector.
CSS rule weight
What happens if two classes of the same name exist in the same page? It is possible to 
have two identically named styles, either in the same style sheet or between internal and 
external style sheets used by the same page. Along the same lines, it is possible to have 
two rules that both apply to the same tag. If either of these cases exists, how do you 
know which rule is followed?
You know which rule is followed based on two factors: weight and placement. If two 
selectors are the same weight (for instance, two tag selectors for the body tag), then the 
last defined rule takes precedence. 
If a rule of the same name is defined in both an internal and external style sheet in your 
document, the rule from the last defined style sheet takes precedence. For instance, if an 
external style sheet is attached to the page anywhere after the internal style sheet, the rule 
in the attached style sheet wins.

Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Skill
Objective 
Demonstrate general and Dreamweaver-specific knowledge of best practices for 
designing a website, such as maintaining consistency, separating content from 
design, using standard fonts, and utilizing visual hierarchy
2.1
Organize web page layout with relative and absolutely-positioned div tags and 
CSS styles
5.2
Business Case
The Organic Utopia website is starting to get more complex. The company owners 
have decided to go with a more visually-engaging layout that includes adding text 
over images. Their idea of the design also includes separate text blocks, and they’d 
like to add more distinctive borders to separate one body of text from another. 
DIVs are a great tool for accomplishing these tasks.
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw05lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw05lessons folder. Go to 
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
The CSS Box model
CSS positions elements within a page using the Box model, which refers to the fact that 
all HTML elements have default boxes that you can choose to style. You can think of a box 
as a container for text, images, media, tables, and other content. In most cases, the width 
and height of a box is determined by the amount of content; however, you can also assign

an explicit width and height to any box. Additionally, each box can have its own optional 
padding, margin, and border settings (described in detail shortly). 
Toward the end of Lesson 4, “Styling Your Pages with CSS,” you began to explore page 
structure through the use of the HTML <div> element. The Box model in CSS applies to all 
elements in HTML but is often paired with <div> tags. The <div> element, in conjunction 
with CSS rules, can be freely positioned, formatted, and even told how to interact with other 
boxes adjacent to it. You can also stack and overlap <div> containers, opening the door to 
flexible and creative layouts that are not possible with HTML alone.
This lesson dives deeper into the many uses of the <div> element. If you have jumped directly 
to this lesson, it is highly recommended that you understand the basic concepts in Lesson 4, 
“Styling Your Pages with CSS,” before starting this one.
Take Note...
If you’ve worked with layout applications such as InDesign, the idea of creating and positioning 
containers for page content should be very familiar to you. Boxes created with the <div> tag 
can be thought of as analogous to the text and image frames you create in InDesign.
The basics of CSS margins, padding, and borders
The Box model allows each element on a page to have unique margin, padding, and border 
settings (Figure 5-1).

D. Content width. E. Visible width.
Margins refer to the transparent area surrounding the box, which you set using the margin 
group of CSS properties. Margins can play an essential role in creating distance between a box 
and the content surrounding it (such as other boxes), or the boundaries of the page itself. You 
can set margins for all sides at once or uniquely for each side. 
Padding is the distance between the inside edge of the box and its contents. By setting 
padding, you create space between the box and any text, images, or other content that it 
contains. You set padding using the padding group of CSS properties, and, like margins, you 
can set padding for all four sides of a box at once or for each side individually.
The border property of a box is transparent by default, but you can add width, color, and a 
border style for decoration or definition around boxes. Borders sit directly between margins 
and padding, and define the actual boundaries of the box. You set borders using the border 
group of CSS properties and, like margins and padding, you can define borders for all four 
sides at once or for each side individually.
You can incorporate each property into any style rule and attach it to a box, similar to the way 
you’ve attached classes to paragraphs and tables in previous lessons.

Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
The CSS Box model
Reviewing the <div> element
As mentioned earlier, when exploring and creating page layouts with CSS, you will frequently 
encounter and use the <div> element. The <div> element creates areas or divisions within an 
HTML document; you can place page content such as text and images directly within sets of 
<div> tags. Dreamweaver enables you to create CSS-driven page layouts using the Insert Div 
Tag and Draw AP Div buttons in the Insert panel; both of these features use <div> tags to 
create areas of layout, but do this in different ways.
Reviewing the ID selector 
In Lesson 4, “Styling Your Pages with CSS,” you learned about the different selector types 
in CSS: classes, tags, pseudo-class selectors, and IDs. In this lesson, IDs take center stage 
and become an essential part of working with CSS boxes and positioning. An ID is a special 
selector type created for a unique element using the same name within a page, and it’s meant 
for one-time use only. ID rules appear within a style sheet and are preceded by a pound sign 
(#), in contrast to classes, which are preceded by a period character ( . ).
Because IDs can be used only once per page, they are ideal for setting properties that need to 
be specific to a single element, such as positioning information. In other words, page elements 
such as headers or columns occupy a specific position on the page, such as top, right, left, and 
so on. When creating layouts using the Insert Div Tag button, Dreamweaver requires you to 
create or assign an ID rule for each box created. When drawing boxes with the Draw AP Div 
button, Dreamweaver automatically creates a unique ID rule that contains positioning, width, 
and height information for that specific box. 
Because the <div> element has no display attributes, it is given its properties by either an ID or 
a class, or both. Dreamweaver has a bias; therefore, the program is more likely to use CSS IDs 
for layout. Think of an ID as a set of instructions that give a <div> its unique appearance and 
behavior (as DNA does to a human being). An ID rule is matched to a <div> using the tag’s 
ID attribute as seen in Figure 5-2. 
Figure 5-2: The Code view shows the style sheet and <div> tag that create the container.

Lesson 5
Tables or CSS for layout?
When CSS first appeared as a tool for layout (in the early 2000s), a debate started within 
the web design community about the best approach to creating page layouts, because 
designers could use either CSS or HTML tables. The argument went something like this: 
Many designers felt like tables were the wrong tool for the job and CSS, with its box 
model, should be adopted as the primary method for positioning page content. Designers 
in favor of tables asserted that tables are more reliable in older browsers and easier and 
quicker to build. For the most part, the argument has been resolved: CSS layout is now 
regarded as the industry standard for creating page layouts.
Here is a brief overview of what you need to know:
Tables: Although fewer sites are being built from scratch in tables these days, there 
remain countless websites that were built with them and are still on the Web being 
updated and maintained. Designers who find themselves having to maintain a tables-
based site would do well to understand their behavior. Also, HTML email often relies on 
the use of tables due to the limited capabilities of email readers.
Tables’ limitations include the following: You are restricted to its cell-based structure, and 
to achieve more complex layouts, you need to nest several levels of tables. Tables also add 
extraneous code to pages and can present difficulties in accessibility for devices such as screen 
readers.
CSS: CSS positioning has been around for many years. However different browsers have 
chosen to support it at varying and inconsistent levels. At this point, CSS positioning 
has a set of Best Practices that are widely known and used across the web design and 
development industry. If you need your sites to work reliably in older browsers, testing is 
still necessary to expose potential inconsistencies.
The CSS Advisor and Browser Compatibility Check features in Dreamweaver CS6 
benefit designers who want to use CSS more extensively. These tools flag and help 
troubleshoot any CSS-related items that may be incompatible or inconsistent in 
commonly used browsers. The CSS Advisor and Browser Compatibility Check are 
discussed in detail in Lesson 16, “Managing Your Website: Reports, Optimization, and 
Maintenance.”

Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Creating a centered container for your page
Creating a centered container for your page
The goal of this lesson is to create the home page for the Organic Utopia site. This page will 
look like the thumbnail in Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3: The completed layout you will be creating in this lesson.
The home page will be a different design and layout than the rest of the site (this layout is 
covered in more detail in Lesson 6, “Advanced Page Layout.”), and you will start by creating 
a container that will end up nesting the other sections of your page such as the header, sidebar 
and other elements. This container will have a fixed width of 960 pixels and also be centered 
within the browser window. 
This container will use a combination of relative positioning and automatic margins to achieve 
the centering effect. Relative positioning allows you to position this box relative to the body 
of the page, and the automatic margins will force the fixed-width container to stay centered 
regardless of the browser window’s width.
Follow these steps to create a centered container
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, navigate to the dw05lessons folder and double-click the layout.html 
file to open it. This document has been partially prepared for you, with a background 
color and a page title added. Additionally, the default font, font color, and font size have 
been defined as Lucida Sans, grey, and small, respectively. Your first step will be to add a 
box, which will become your main column of text.
2.	 If it’s not already visible, open the Insert panel by choosing Window > Insert. The Insert 
panel features a list of objects that can be added to your pages easily.

Lesson 5
3.	 In the bottom-left corner of your document window, click the <body> tag. Remember, 
the body tag encloses all the other tags within a page. You will now create a new <div> 
element that will function as a container for the other layout elements. In the Insert panel, 
click the Insert Div Tag button (Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-4: Click the Insert Div Tag to  
add a container div element.
4.	 The Insert Div Tag dialog box appears. Click in the ID text field and type container, 
then click the New CSS Rule button. In the New CSS Rule definition dialog box that 
appears, make sure that #container is listed as the Selector Name and then click OK. 
The CSS Rule definition dialog box appears and you can begin to style your container div.
5.	 Select the Box listing in the Category column on the left side of the dialog box. In the 
Width text field, type 840 and make sure px (pixels) is selected from the drop-down menu 
to the right. For Height, type 800 in the text field. In the Margin section, uncheck Same 
for All, then, from the Right margin drop-down menu, choose auto. Choose auto from 
the Left margin drop-down menu as seen in Figure 5-5. 
Figure 5-5: Choose the settings for the #container element.
You’ll explore using margins in more depth, but by setting a margin value of auto to the 
left and right side of the container, you are instructing the browser to put equal amounts 
of space on the right and left sides. The end result will be a box that is centered within the 
browser window. 
6.	 Select the Background category on the left side of the dialog box, then click the 
Background-color swatch and choose the white (#FFF) swatch. This adds a background 
color of white to your entire container, separating it from the background.

7.	 Select the Positioning category on the left side of the dialog box and choose relative from 
the Position drop-down menu. This is key to the success of your next steps. By setting the 
position of the container to relative you will be able to position the page elements using 
the container as a frame of reference. Press OK in this dialog box, as well as OK for the 
Insert Div Tag dialog box that is still open.
8.	 Choose File > Save, then choose File > Preview in Browser. Your container will be 
centered in the middle of your browser window and Dreamweaver’s default placeholder 
text is aligned in the top left of your container (Figure 5-6). (Occasionally, we have 
noticed Dreamweaver does not add this placeholder text; if this is the case for you, return 
to Dreamweaver, click within the container, and then type content for id “container” 
Goes Here.)
Figure 5-6: With position set to relative and auto margins the container element will always be centered.
Resize the browser width; the container stays centered until the window is narrower 
than 840 pixels, at which point the box is cropped. Close your browser. If your container 
div did not appear centered, it is possible you are using an older browser. Even if your 
container div is centered, there are a few additional steps you will now add to ensure the 
page centers in older browsers.
Making layouts cross-browser compatible
If you are new to web design, welcome to the world known as CSS hacks. In an ideal world, 
all web browsers would render HTML and CSS using the same set of rules, and all web 
pages would look the same, regardless of the browser. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
Cross-browser compatibility is the term used to identify how a web page functions and 
appears on the multiple web browsers and operating systems used by your target audience. For 
example, older web browsers such as Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4 do not render CSS 
positioning particularly well. More modern browsers have their own set of quirks as well. In 
certain cases, additional rules can be added to the CSS that make the page work. These fixes 
are never ideal because they require additional code and sometimes create more problems than 
they solve; however, they are necessary if you want your pages to look similar across browsers.

Lesson 5
Follow these steps to fix a cross-browser compatibility problem
Step-by-Step
1.	 With layout.html open, double-click the body rule in the CSS Styles panel to edit its 
properties. In the CSS Rule definition dialog box, select the Block category and choose 
center from the Text-align drop-down menu. Press OK.
This fixes a problem that exists with version 6 (and earlier) of Internet Explorer regarding 
automatic margins. Although this fixes the bug, it creates another problem in that it will 
center all text on your page (you can see this currently in your container). So, in order to 
fix that problem you must create another rule to counteract this one.
2.	 Double-click the #container rule in the CSS Styles panel. In the CSS Rule definition 
dialog box, select the Block category on the left, and then choose left from the Text-align 
drop-down menu. This will align your text to the left, and all is back to normal. Press OK 
to accept these changes.
3.	 Choose File > Save.
In this exercise you created a centered box named container. In the next exercise, you 
will place all your other layout sections as well as your content, into this container. Before 
doing this, a brief overview of the difference between absolute and relative positioning 
may help.
Take Note...
For a more in-depth look at cross-browser compatibility see the Web Design with HTML 
and CSS Digital Classroom book available in electronic and print formats.
Absolute versus relative positioning
Absolute positioning: An element that is set to absolute strictly follows the positioning values 
given to it, relative only to its containing element. The containing element can be another div 
or the page itself. Absolutely positioned elements are pulled out of the normal flow of HTML 
content, and regardless of what surrounds them (for example, text content or neighboring 
divs), they always appear at the exact coordinates assigned to them. 
Figure 5-7 is an example of a div absolutely positioned within another div. The larger div 
(Box #1) is the containing element, and so any positioning values assigned to Box #2 are 
relative to the element boundaries of Box #1.
Figure 5-7: Box #2 is contained, or nested,  
within Box #1.

Lesson 5
157
Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Creating a centered container for your page
Adding additional content to the containing box (#1) has no effect on the nested div. It 
remains positioned outside the flow of HTML as seen in Figure 5-8.
Figure 5-8: Box #2 remains in position even  
with added content in Box #1.
Relative positioning: A relatively positioned element accepts values for position properties 
such as top and left, but it also takes the normal flow of neighboring HTML content into 
account. In Figure 5-9 are the same boxes and values shown in the preceding two figures; the 
only difference here is that the position property for Box #2 has been set to relative instead of 
absolute.
Figure 5-9: Box #2 is still offset, just as before,  
but it’s being displaced by the content before it.
Although it appears that the top and left values have changed, they haven’t. Unlike absolutely 
positioned elements, relatively positioned elements stay within the normal flow of HTML 
content, which means that they can be displaced by the elements (in this case, the text) 
surrounding them. In this example, Box #2 is still 50 pixels from the top and 50 pixels from the 
left, but its point of reference is the end of the preceding text content, not Box #1.

Creating a centered container for your page
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
158
Lesson 5
Positioning items relatively is useful when you want an item to flow with the items surrounding it. 
Figure 5-10 shows five divs nested inside a larger div to create a menu.
Figure 5-10: All menu items are positioned  
relative to one another, and so they fall into  
place based on each other’s position.
The same example is shown in the Figure 5-11, with the position set to absolute for all menu 
items. The result is a collapse of the menu—all the menu items are trying to occupy the same 
place at the same time, without regard for their neighbors.
Figure 5-11: When set to absolute, the  
menu items stack on top of one another,  
because they all must be at the same place,  
regardless of the elements that surround them.
Take Note...
The files used for these examples are located in the dw05lessons folder, and are named 
absolute_relative.html and relative_menu.html. Open them in Dreamweaver and explore the 
code to further your knowledge.
Any element, or, in this case, any box, can have the position property applied, and one of five 
possible values can be set: absolute, fixed, relative, static, or inherit. The two most commonly 
used are absolute and relative, and although both can accept positioning properties such as top 
and left; they are rendered differently, even with identical positioning values.

Positioning content with AP Divs
Positioning content with AP Divs
Now that your container is centered on the page, you’ll need to add boxes to hold content 
within the container. The easiest and most visual way to place boxes in Dreamweaver is with 
the Draw AP Div button. An AP Div is Dreamweaver’s name for absolutely positioned div 
elements and is represented in the Design View as a box into which you can add text and/or 
other elements such as images or media. An AP Div is placed exactly where you draw it, using 
the page as its point of reference by default; after drawing, you can reposition it precisely.
For this exercise, you’ll want your AP Divs to be positioned using the container as their point 
of reference. To change the default behavior of AP Divs as you draw them, an additional step is 
required. This step will ensure that your AP Divs are nested inside the container div.
1.	 In the layout.html document, choose Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver 
> Preferences (Mac OS) and then choose the AP Elements category. Click the checkbox 
labeled Nesting (Figure 5-12). This ensures that the new boxes you create will be nested 
inside the container. Click OK.
Figure 5-12: Set your Preferences so that new AP Elements automatically nest when inside  
your container.
Creating a header section with the Draw AP Div
You have already created a container that is centered within your page; now you’ll add the 
other layout elements, starting with the header. The Draw AP Div tool allows you to add 
boxes within your pages manually. Once a box is added, you can style it with CSS (change the 
width and height, add background color and more) and you can also add content such as text 
or images.

2.	 In the Insert panel, click the Draw AP Div button. Move back over the page; your cursor 
is now a crosshair signifying that you can begin to draw.
3.	 Place your cursor below the placeholder text in the top-left corner of the container and 
then click and drag down and to the right to draw a box. Stop approximately 25% of the 
way down the screen. The box appears with a handle in the top left corner as seen in 
Figure 5-14.
Figure 5- 14: The newly created AP Div has a handle in its top-left corner.
4.	 Click the selection handle in the top-left corner of the AP Div and click and drag the box 
around the screen to see how you can position the box manually. Notice in the Property 
Inspector that the properties for your box are displayed and dynamically change as you 
move it; currently just the Left and Top position (L and T) will change. Your settings will 
likely be different than those in the figure.
Click inside the Bg color text field, type #9fcc41, and then press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) to apply the color, which is a yellow-green shade (Figure 5-15).
Figure 5-15: The Property Inspector displays the properties of the AP Div and allows you to set its background color.
You will now position this box to become your header.

currently named apDiv1. Select the text within this text field and type header.

Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Positioning content with AP Divs
When Dreamweaver creates new AP Divs, it gives them the default names of apDiv1, 
apDiv2, and so on. You can, and most often should, rename these, simply because the 
default name is nondescriptive and unhelpful. Keep in mind that functionally, this is 
exactly the same step as the previous exercise when you named the div “container.” In 
both cases you are creating a CSS ID behind the scenes.
6.	 Select the placeholder text Content for id “container” Goes Here and delete it. You are 
about to create your header at the top of the page and you don’t need this content.
7.	 If you currently do not have rulers visible, choose View > Rulers > Show. Click the edge of 
the header div again, and pay careful attention to the L (Left) and the T (Top) values. 
You will now position the header to the top-left corner of the container using the 
Property Inspector.
8.	 In the Property Inspector, type 0px into the L (Left) text field and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS). The box moves and the left side of the box is positioned horizontally 
at 0 pixels. Type 0px into the T (Top) text field and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). The top of the box is positioned vertically at 0 pixels as seen in Figure 5-16. 
Be sure to type the number and the px value (i.e., 100px) together in order for position to 
be valid.
Figure 5-16: With Top and Left values both set to 0px the header is aligned to the top-left corner of the container.
9.	 You also need to set the width of this header. Again, you could do this manually by 
dragging the edges of the header box, but this is not precise. It is better to use number 
values and match the width of the header to the width of the container.
In the Property Inspector, type 840px for the W value and 80px for the H value.
10.	 You can add content to the box by simply typing in it. Click inside the box on the 
workspace and type Organic Utopia. You’ll be replacing this with the logo a bit later, for 
now this will serve as a placeholder.

File > Preview in Browser or by pressing the Preview/Debug in browser button ( ) at the 
top of the document window. Close the browser when finished.
Adding an introduction section to your page
Now you can add additional sections to your page. The first section you’ll add is a box below 
the header where you’ll format an introductory paragraph to state the mission of the site, and 
grab the user’s attention.
Follow these steps to create an introduction section
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Insert panel, click the Draw AP Div object and draw a box below your header. 
Don’t worry about the exact size of the box, but make the width about half the header and 
roughly twice the height. 
A good habit to get into is renaming your AP Divs immediately after they are created. 
2.	 Click the edge of the new div and in the CSS-P Element text field, type intro and press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
3.	 Click inside the intro box and type the following text: Organic Utopia is a community 
owned and operated supermarket and marketplace. Anyone may shop in our 
stores but members enjoy special discounts and other benefits. (Figure 5-17) 
Figure 5-17: The #intro AP Div with added text.
Now you’ll format the text in this box using techniques from the last lesson.
4.	 In the Property Inspector, click the HTML button if necessary. Select and highlight the 
text you entered and choose Paragraph from the Format drop-down menu.
5.	 With the text still selected, click the CSS button in the Property Inspector. Then click 
the Font drop-down menu and choose the Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif 
family. The New CSS Rule definition dialog box will open. The Selector Type will be 
compound. The Selector Name is #container #intro p. Press the Less Specific button 
to set the selector to #intro p. 
Press OK and the change is applied.

choose the keyword large. Your text size will enlarge as seen in Figure 5-18.
Figure 5-18: Set the paragraph text inside the intro box to Georgia and large.
Depending on how large you made your intro box, you will likely need to adjust the 
width and height of the box.
7.	 Click the edge of the intro box to activate it and then click any of the anchor points on 
the box to adjust the width and height. We used a width of 720px and a height of 130px. 
Click anywhere on the background of the page to deselect the intro div.
Adding images to your layout
Before you add the remaining sections of your page, you’ll add images to both the header and 
container sections of the page. First, you’ll add a background image of vegetables to the right 
side of your header.
Follow these steps to insert a background image
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel double-click the #header rule to open the CSS Rule definition 
dialog box. Click the Background category. In addition to the background color, you can 
also add CSS background images.
2.	 In the Background image section, press the Browse button. In the select Image Source 
dialog box, navigate to the images folder within the dw05lessons folder and select 
veggies.jpg. Press OK (Windows) or Choose (Mac OS). Press Apply and you will see the 
image tiled across the header. (If you see a Missing Profile message click OK.)
By default, background images in CSS have this tiled effect, so you will need to add

3.	 From the Background-repeat drop-down menu, choose no-repeat. From the Background-
position (X) drop-down menu, choose right. Press OK and you see the image now aligned 
to the right side of the header as seen in Figure 5-19.
Figure 5-19: Background images can be added and positioned to a <div> element.
A background image is controlled by CSS, and you can only have one background image 
per element. So in order to have two images inside the header, you’ll add the Organic 
Utopia logo as an inline element. This means the logo is being added to the HTML code, 
not the CSS. 
4.	 Select the Organic Utopia placeholder text in the #header div and delete it. Then 
choose Insert > Image. In the Select Image Source dialog box, navigate to the images 
folder within the dw05lessons folder and select ou_logo.gif. Press OK (Windows) or 
Open (Mac OS). Type OrganicUtopia Logo into the text field when asked to add an 
Alternative text tag, and then press OK. The image appears in the top-left corner of the 
header. You will position this image away from the sides of the header box later in the 
lesson. (If you receive a Missing Profile message, click OK.)
Take Note...
When working with images, follow this rule of thumb: HTML inline images should be used 
for content; CSS background images should be used for decoration. One way to test this rule 
is to imagine the impact on the page if the image were not displayed. In the example above, 
the image of the vegetables is not essential, so the website would not be adversely affected if the 
image is not displayed; however, the logo is important, so it should be considered content, not 
decoration.

Photoshop integration
Often the images used in your web page need to be modified in Photoshop before they 
integrate well with your design. Photoshop and Dreamweaver are integrated in a few ways. In 
this exercise, you will see how Dreamweaver can optimize .psd files when you insert them into 
your page.
Follow these steps to insert and optimize a .psd image
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #container rule. Click the Background 
category and choose the Browse button in the Background-image section. In your 
dw05lessons folder, open the artwork folder. Choose the veggiebackground.psd file 
and press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS) The Image Optimization dialog box appears 
(Figure 5-20).
This dialog box appears because you have chosen a .psd file to import and this is not a valid 
file format for the Web. Dreamweaver triggers the Image Optimization dialog box, which 
allows you to optimize the graphic and save it in a more appropriate format.
Figure 5-20: Importing a .psd file into Dreamweaver will  
trigger the Image Preview, allowing you to save as a web graphic.
2.	 Click the Preset menu and choose “JPEG high for Maximum Compatibility” if it is not 
already selected. Slide the Quality slider to 1 and notice that the preview of the image on 
your page becomes pixelated. Reducing the quality results in a smaller file size, but going 
too low results in unacceptable loss of detail.
3.	 Drag the Quality slider to 70, and notice that the quality improves dramatically. As with 
most compression, the goal is to find a good balance between small file size and image 
quality.
4.	 Click OK, and then navigate to the images folder in the dw05lessons folder and double-
click it. In the URL section, notice the path images/veggie_background.jpg. It’s important 
to understand that you are saving a copy of the original PSD file as a JPEG in this step. 
Click Save and you now have a link to the new background image.
5.	 Click the Background-repeat drop-down menu and choose no-repeat, and then click OK.

Adding Main and Sidebar content areas
Now you’ll add two more sections to your page: a main column, which will feature the 
latest news from our fictional company Organic Utopia and a sidebar column, which features 
incentives for visitors to become members.
Follow these steps to create a content area
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Insert panel, click the Draw AP Div button, then place your cursor below the intro 
box and click and drag down and to the right as seen in Figure 5-21. As you are drawing 
the AP Div notice there are width and height values that are updated in the Status Bar on 
the bottom right of your document window
FIgure 5-21: The width and height of an AP Div are updated in the Status bar as you draw the div.
Make the AP Div roughly 450px wide by 200px high. Don’t try to get the exact 
dimensions, as it is very difficult to be precise when drawing. You can always fine-tune the 
width and height in the Property Inspector.
2.	 Click the border of the div and in the CSS-P Element text field rename the div to main. 
Next, click the Bg color swatch in the Property Inspector and from the color swatches that 
appear, choose white.
3.	 Click the Draw AP Div button again and draw another box to the right of the Main div. 
Make this one approximately the same height, and the width should be about 240. Again 
don’t worry about the exact dimensions for now.
4.	 Click the border of the new div and in the CSS-P Element text field, type sidebar to 
rename the AP Div. Click the Bg color menu and make this background white as well.
You’ll now make sure the top edges of the two boxes are lined up.

Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Positioning content with AP Divs
5.	 Click the handle on the top-left of the main div and reposition it to the following left and 
top values: L (Left) should be 35 and T (Top) should be 260 as seen in Figure 5-22. 
Figure 5-22: Setting the Left and Top values of an AP Div.
6.	 Click the top-left edge of the sidebar div and type 260 for the Top value. You can use the 
left and right arrows on your keyboard to nudge the div horizontally. We ended up with a 
Left value of 515.
With the top values the same for both boxes, the top edges line up. Once the boxes are lined 
up, you can always move them as a unit by selecting and dragging or nudging them.
7.	 Click the edge of the main div to select it and then Shift+click the sidebar. With both 
boxes selected, press your up arrow keys to move both boxes upward. There is no right 
value here, use your judgment and push the two boxes closer to the intro text.
Adding additional content and styles
Up to this point, you’ve been working with the base structure of your layout. Now it’s time to 
add additional content in the form of text so that you can see how your layout works with real 
content, and make any necessary changes. 
Follow these steps to add new content
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click the main_content.html file in the Files panel to open it. This is text that 
has already been formatted; all that is necessary is to copy and paste it into your layout.

Positioning content with AP Divs

168
Lesson 5
2.	 Choose Edit > Select All and then choose Edit > Copy. Close the main_content.html 
document. In the layout.html document, click inside the main div and choose Edit > Paste. 
The content appears styled as Lucida Grande as seen in Figure 5-23 because there is a rule 
in the body defining the font-family; however, there are no CSS rules yet for headings or 
paragraphs.
Figure 5-23: The results of copying and pasting the main_content.html page into your main div element.
You pasted more content than can fit inside this box, which is why the text is flowing 
outside the boundaries of the container. In fact, what you are seeing is one of the 
disadvantages of using AP Divs. Defining the width and height of a box in pixels creates an 
inflexible container. One solution to this is simply to expand the size of the box.
3.	 Click the bottom of the blue border for the div and drag it down slightly, the box will 
automatically expand to fit the existing content.
Now you’ll add the content to the member benefit section.
4.	 Double-click the memberbenefits_content.html file in the Files panel. Choose Edit > 
Select All and then choose Edit > Copy. Close the memberbenefits_content.html 
document. In the layout.html document, click inside the sidebar and choose Edit > Paste.
5.	 Click the bottom of the sidebar div and drag it down slightly to expand the box to fit the 
content.

Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Setting margins and borders
Setting margins and borders
As you learned earlier, CSS uses the Box model for elements, and as such, each element can be 
given unique margins, padding, and borders, either for decorative or practical purposes.
Now that you have content inside your columns, it is clear that you need to do some fine-
tuning. Your text and logo are crowded against their respective div elements and you should 
make them more pleasing and readable. Technically, you can start anywhere, but in this 
exercise, you’ll start at the top of your page and work down. 
Follow these steps to create settings for margins and borders
Step-by-Step
1.	 Select the Organic Utopia logo in the header. In the CSS Styles panel, press the New 
CSS Rule button ( ). The New CSS Rule dialog box appears and the Selector Name, 
#container #header img is selected. Since the rule gets more specific from left to 
right, ultimately you are targeting the <img> tag located inside the header div, which is 
inside the container div. Click OK. 
2.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box that appears, select the Box category on the left. If 
necessary, move the dialog box to see the logo. Uncheck the Same for All checkbox in the 
Margin section. In the Top text field, type 20 and press Apply. The logo is pushed down 
20 pixels from the top of the header div, because there is now a 20-pixel margin applied to 
the top of the image.
3.	 In the Left margin text field, type 15 and press OK. Adding a 15-pixel left margin pushes 
the logo to the right. Now you’ll add similar margins in the main column.
4.	 Click anywhere inside the heading Celebrating Vegetables in the main column. In the 
CSS Styles panel, press the New CSS Rule button. In the New CSS Rule dialog box, 
make sure the selector name reads #container #main h2. Press OK.
5.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box, select the Box category, and uncheck the Same for 
All checkbox in the Margin section. In the Left text field, type 15 as seen in Figure 5-24 
and press OK.
Figure 5-24: Applying a left margin of 15 to the main heading.
6.	 Click inside the paragraph below the Celebrating Vegetables heading. In the CSS Style 
panel, press the New CSS Rule button and in the New CSS Rule dialog box, make sure 
that #container #main p is highlighted in the Selector Name text field. Press OK.

Lesson 5
7.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box, select the Box category from the left column, and 
uncheck the Same for All checkbox in the Margin section. In the Left and Right text 
fields, type 15. You need to add both left and right padding because the text fills the main 
container. Press OK.
Overriding default margins in CSS
If you are new to Dreamweaver and/or CSS, an important concept is that of default margins. 
Web browsers will apply default margins to most block elements unless there is a value 
overriding them. So paragraphs and headings, for example, will have space between them even 
if you haven’t set a value. You can see this space by using Dreamweaver’s Inspect feature.
Follow these steps to override the default margins in CSS
Step-by-Step
1.	 In your document window, click the Live View button to cause the Live Code and Inspect 
buttons to appear. Click the Inspect Mode; Dreamweaver will prompt you to change your 
workspace settings. Press “Switch Now” to change your settings to the Split Code view. 
Now you can hover over elements on your page and see the normally invisible margins.
2.	 Place your cursor over the Celebrating Vegetables heading. The yellow highlight shows 
the margins being applied to this element as seen in Figure 5-25.
Figure 5-25: The Inspect feature in Dreamweaver CS6 highlights the margins of an element in yellow.
Hover over the paragraph below the heading and note there are margins being applied 
here as well. In order to reduce the space, you will need to reduce the bottom margin of 
the heading and the top margin of the paragraph.
3.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the “All” tab, and then locate and double-click the 
#container #main h2 style and then select the Box category. Set the bottom margin 
value to 0 px and press OK.
4.	 Place your cursor over the heading. Note that the bottom margin is gone (in other words, 
there is no yellow border). You now need to set the top margin of the paragraph to 0 as 
well.

Lesson 5
171
Lesson 5: Creating Page Layouts with CSS 
Setting margins and borders
5.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #container #main p style and select the Box 
category. Set the top margin value to 0 px and press OK. Now all the paragraphs in the 
main column shift upward.
6.	 Click the Live View button to de-activate this mode, and then click the Design button to 
return to your default mode.
Take Note...
Because margins and padding are invisible, many designers resort to applying either 
background colors or borders to elements at the beginning of the layout process. This helps 
to understand the relationship between various sections on the page. The Inspect button 
in Dreamweaver partially removes the need to do this, but you may still find the original 
technique useful.
Adding borders to elements
The ability to add borders to elements is a great feature in CSS. Because of the CSS Box 
model, almost anything can be styled with borders: div elements, headings, lists and more. 
Additionally, the style, width and color of these borders can be set globally or for any given side.
Follow these steps to add a CSS border
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Style panel, double-click the #main style and then click the Border category to 
begin setting these properties.
2.	 In the Style category uncheck the Same for all checkbox. Click the Top menu and choose 
solid. Then click the Bottom menu and choose solid.
In the Style menu, note the other options available. Styles such as dotted and dashed are 
the most reliable styles. For various reasons the other options such as groove, ridge, etc. are 
not particularly well-supported in older browsers and you should use them sparingly.
3.	 In the Width category, uncheck the Same for all checkbox and click the Top menu. Note 
that you can also choose keywords here for thin, medium or thick. Select (value) and then 
type 2. The default value is px. Click the Bottom menu and type 2.
4.	 In the Color category, uncheck the Same for all checkbox and in both the Top and Bottom 
fields type #063 (Figure 5-26). This is a dark green color.

Take a moment to admire your layout. You’re almost done; however the last step is to 
future proof your page layout.
6.	 Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
Future proofing your layout
Absolutely positioning the elements of your page layout is very stable and reliable, but it also 
has some fundamental limitations. You have already seen what happens when there is more 
content than can fit inside a box: the box overflows resulting in unattractive content. You 
have also seen one solution, which is simply to expand the size of the box. Even this is not an 
ideal solution though. Content on the Web changes constantly; text is added and removed, 
images are inserted and so on. The designer of the page may have little or no control over this, 
especially if they are handing a website off to a client who will eventually be updating and 
modifying the site. 
To help strengthen your layout for future modification, you can use a CSS property called 
overflow. This will help you prevent the worst-case scenario of text that breaks your layout as it 
overflows its container. For this exercise, you’ll apply overflow to the Members Benefits sidebar.
Follow these steps to add a scrollbar
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the bottom edge of the sidebar and then drag the bottom of the box upward until 
half of the list items are overflowing out of the box as seen in Figure 5-27.
Figure 5-27: Text that is overflowing over the sidebar.
2.	 Double-click the #sidebar style in the CSS Styles panel and then click the Positioning 
category.
3.	 Click the Overflow menu and choose auto. This automatically adds scrollbars to 
any <div> element that has more text than can fit inside. Click OK. You will see in 
Dreamweaver’s design view that the box has snapped to fit the original height.

The pros and cons of Absolutely Positioned CSS layouts
4.	 Choose File > Save, then File > Preview in Browser. Your div now has a scrollbar. While 
it may not be an ideal solution if you do not like scrollbars, at least it doesn’t break the 
layout. Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
The pros and cons of Absolutely Positioned CSS layouts
You will now take a look at the limitations and weaknesses of the layout you have just created. 
Absolutely positioned layouts in Dreamweaver are the quickest and easiest way to get a web 
page up and working, however, as noted earlier they are not the most flexible. 
In this exercise, we hope to point out some of the limitations of Absolutely Positioned layouts 
so that you can judge for yourself whether they fit all your needs or whether you need to be 
looking at the next step of creating pages using more advanced layout techniques, which are 
covered in Lesson 6, “Advanced Page Layout.”
To illustrate this, you will take a look at your existing layout with the premise that someone 
has asked you to make the entire container larger and also switch the position of the two 
columns on your page.
Follow these steps to work more with AP divs
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Design view, click the edge of your #container div to select it and in the Property 
Inspector, change the Width from 840 to 960. The container width expands but when 
adding this extra 120 pixels of space, your header and the other sections are no longer 
well-aligned.
Your background image is now also too narrow. This cannot be easily resolved in 
Dreamweaver. You would have to go back to Photoshop, resize the image, and export it 
again. For now, you’ll simply turn it off temporarily.
2.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the #container style, and click the All button if necessary. 
Now select the background-image property. Click the Disable/Enable CSS Property 
button ( ) at the bottom of the panel (Figure 5-28) to turn off this image for now.
Figure 5-28: Clicking the Disable/Enable  
CSS Property button removes the style for  
the background image.
With the background image temporarily removed, it is easier to see the structure of your 
layout.

Lesson 5
3.	 Click the right edge of the header and drag it to the right to expand the width. Drag the 
header beyond the container and notice it is easy to break your layout. This is because 
absolutely positioned elements don’t interact with the other elements on the page; you 
need to manually adjust them.
4.	 In the CSS Property Inspector, set the W (Width) value of the header to 960. It must 
match the width of the container exactly. Although you’ll also notice that the background 
image of the vegetables remains flush right.
5.	 Click the edge of the intro box, and, using your arrow keys, nudge it to the right until it is 
centered within the page.
Now you need to switch the position of the main and sidebar divs.
6.	 Click the edge of the main div and use your arrow keys to nudge it to the right. Notice 
that it overlaps your sidebar. This is due to the behavior of absolutely positioned elements 
allowing them to occupy the same space on the page. 
Take Note...
The property that controls which element is highest in the stacking order is called the z-index. 
Dreamweaver sets this property automatically when you create AP Divs. Elements with the 
higher z-index value will always “win” and be visible over elements with a lower z-index. 
You can also modify z-index values if you choose to adjust this.
7.	 Click the edge of the sidebar div and using your arrow keys nudge to the left until it 
reaches the original position of the main div. 
You may need to nudge the position of the two boxes until you are satisfied with their 
position. Additionally, feel free to adjust the width of the boxes if needed (Figure 5-29).
Figure 5-29: Switching the position of the two boxes requires you to move them manually.
Adjusting the width of the layout and the columns is not significantly difficult but it’s 
also not very efficient. Wouldn’t it be nice if expanding the width of the container 
automatically readjusted the columns within the new space? In fact, there are techniques 
you can use to accomplish this. They are called float-based layouts and you will learn these 
techniques in the next lesson. For now, save and close the files.

The pros and cons of Absolutely Positioned CSS layouts
Printing web pages
Whether it is desktop or mobile, web pages are meant to be delivered on screens first and 
foremost, however printing should not be an afterthought. 
In the earlier days of the web, browsers would often print a web page based on a straight 
conversion of pixels to inches. This meant that in order to safely include your content on 
a standart 8 ½ × 11 inch piece of paper your website would have to be about 600 pixels 
wide if using a fixed-width layout. Because this is a very restrictive width for screens, this 
technique is rarely used today.
Virtually all web browsers today (and most recent browsers) will scale a web page 
automatically. This is a function of the browser and overrides the designer’s intent. You 
can experiment with your own layout and your current web browser to see the results.
Another option is to create a special “print stylesheet”. This can be done by adding a 
reference to a separate style sheet in your head section as follows:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" type="text/css" 
media="print" />
The name “print.css” is arbitrary here, you can name this anything you would like. The 
important part of this code is the media=”print” attribute and value. This tells the web 
browser to use this style sheet when printing.

As the designer of the Serenity Spa website you need to create a photocollage effect with 
overlapping images. You will use AP Divs and the Z-index feature to do this 
1.	 On the gallery.html page, use the Draw AP Div tool, click and drag to draw a rectangle 
that is about one-sixth of the size of the entire page. Select the box by clicking on the tab 
in the upper left corner, and copy and paste it three times. Distribute the boxes around the 
page.

2.	 Place your cursor in one of the boxes. Click on the Common category of the Insert bar, 
and select the Image icon. 
3.	 Choose one of the images in the images folder and press OK. The image will now appear 
inside the box. If you need to resize the image, click on the image itself, put your cursor 
on one of the handles, hold down the Shift key, and drag the handle to resize the image. 
To resize the box, select the box by clicking on the tab in the upper left corner, then click 
on one of the box handles and drag until the box is the size you want. 
4.	 Follow the procedure outlined above to add images to the other three boxes on the page. 
The boxes should overlap. 
5.	 Now, select each box, one at a time, and look at the z-index in the Property Inspector. 
Change the z-index of each box, assigning each one a different number, 1 through 3. 
Notice how the overlapping of the boxes changes as you assign the z-index numbers to 
them. Find the box that is at the back of all of the others, select it, and give it a z-index of

Business Case
The Organic Utopia site requires a consistent column layout. The trouble is that 
setting up columns on a webpage isn’t a matter of dragging and dropping objects 
anywhere on the webpage; there are some rules dictated by the code. Getting more 
in-depth knowledge about CSS and DIVs will help with this process.
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. 
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw06lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw06lessons folder. Go to 
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
Graphic design elements and principles
In web design, page layout can be divided into two categories: the aesthetics of a page and the 
underlying CSS and HTML code that renders the page in the browser. You’ll have time to 
explore the code side later in the chapter but first here is a brief overview of design concepts 
that will help you understand the elements of a page.

Graphic design elements and principles
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
182
Lesson 6
• Line, shape and form
The line is one of the most basic elements in a page layout.  Lines are used to divide space and 
separate content. Shape describes two-dimensional space, the three basic shapes are square, 
triangle and circle. Form is the three-dimensional version of a shape. So if the shape is square, 
then the form would be a cube.
• Color, contrast and texture
Color is a complex subject, but at its essence, color evokes reactions in people. You can use 
color to help visually organize your layout or use color as an accent on the page to attract the 
user’s eye. Contrast is the technique of creating visual differences on the page, this could be 
placing two different colors side by side but contrast could also be the juxtaposition of two 
different shapes, typefaces or images. Texture in web design is always implied through the style 
of design (since there is no physical texture on a screen!). The visual texture of a background 
graphic or a pattern in your layout can help control the perception of the user. A leopard skin 
texture for a banking site, for example, would not likely inspire confidence to the user.
• Emphasis, movement and balance
Emphasis is the technique of making a specific element stand out to the eye. Movement is the 
technique of simulating motion or using graphical elements (such as arrows) to help direct the 
eye. Balance is the state of a page in which the design is clearly arranged in a planned, visual 
pattern.
• Unity, proximity and repetition
Unity is the feeling of “completeness” achieved when at least two or more components of your 
page have something in common such as color or other style. Proximity is the closeness or 
distance of individual design elements. Repetition is when a page element occurs more than a 
few times.
• Rule of thirds
A well known composition principle (also seen in photography, film and other disciplines) in 
which a page (or image) is divided into 9 imaginary equal parts (two equally-spaced horizontal 
lines and two equally-spaced vertical lines), and important compositional elements are placed 
along these lines or their intersections. This technique tends to create more interesting layout 
than simply centering the content would.
• White space
The absence of text and graphics is known as white space. Properties such as margins, space 
between columns and paragraphs can all be adjusted to achieve a form of balance. Too little 
white space and a page is cramped, busy and hard to read. Too much white space and a page 
can feel empty, lacking content and call attention to itself.
• Alignment
Alignment in page layout design is the technique of keeping related objects such as text and 
images, in line. Alignment is one of the keys to keeping the user’s eye focused on the content.

Lesson 6

Lesson 6: Advanced Page Layout
Layout with AP divs versus layout with floats
Symmetry
Symmetry is when the weight of a page layout is evenly distributed around a central vertical or 
horizontal axis, for example if a page is split into two equal columns. Horizontal and vertical 
symmetry are the two most common forms, but there is also diagonal symmetry in which the 
central axis is a diagonal line. Radial symmetry occurs when objects are rotated in a certain 
direction around a point, in nature you might see radial symmetry in the spiral of a seashell. 
Asymmetry is when the weight of a page layout is not evenly distributed around a central axis. 
Avoid these mistakes in your page designs 
It takes experience to become a great visual designer, until you come more experienced 
you are likely to make some mistakes along the way. There are a few simple guidelines or 
“best practices” that you can follow that will help you create page designs that avoid the 
worst of these mistakes
• Don’t use color merely for decoration. Color has the ability to evoke feeling and 
draw attention to a page element such as a heading or a section of a page. But color 
can be abused if it is too bright or saturated.
• Avoid extraneous graphics. Just as with color, imagery can draw attention to a 
section of a page. If an image is relevant then this is fine, however don’t add graphics 
just to fill up space on a page.
• Page design should be consistent across the site. Even if your website has many 
sections and pages, these pages should feel unified. The contact page of your site 
might only be a single column whereas your home page has three columns, but they 
should both still feel as if they are part of the same family. This can be accomplished 
by using consistent page elements such as heading sizes, font colors, and graphics.
Layout with AP divs versus layout with floats
In this lesson, you’ll learn an advanced method of layout in Dreamweaver using CSS boxes 
that are floated as columns. Unlike the inflexible nature of AP Divs, floated layouts can 
accommodate additional content more easily, and once you learn how to use them, they will 
allow you to use more creative layout options.
You may be asking: why are there two methods of layout in Dreamweaver, and why am I 
learning both? To understand this, it helps to keep in mind that historically Dreamweaver 
has been designed for use in the Design view (in other words, not working in code). As you 
will soon see, the CSS float property that you will be using to create columns was not truly 
designed to be a tool for layout, and requires a good understanding of CSS to be useful.
Floated layouts are trickier to control and understand than AP Divs. Additionally, older web 
browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 have well-documented bugs and quirks that can prevent 
floated layouts from rendering correctly. To address these problems, coding techniques known 
as “browser hacks” have been developed over the years. The browser hacks involve adding 
additional code targeted toward one browser in order to make the pages look the same.
In Dreamweaver, it is likely that the program leans toward using the more reliable and easier-to-
manipulate AP Divs because of its traditional user base. However, as users of Dreamweaver seek 
to duplicate some of the sophisticated sites they see online, they really have no choice but to work 
with floats. As you walk through this lesson, it is important to keep in mind that you do not 
necessarily have to choose between absolutely positioned layouts and floated layouts. Layouts that 
combine both AP Divs and floated layouts are commonplace and combine the strengths of both.

Layout with AP divs versus layout with floats
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 6
In addition to the two layouts described above, Dreamweaver CS6 has added a third category 
of layouts: “fluid layouts.” The fluid layout feature represents the latest development in web 
design and development: creating web pages designed to adapt to screens of different sizes. 
You will have the opportunity to work with this feature at the end of the lesson; however, you 
should note that this form of layout is not for everyone, so understanding the fundamentals of 
float-based layouts is still the recommended path for most Dreamweaver users.
To start creating more sophisticated and flexible layouts, you will first need to have a good 
understanding of the float property.
Creating a floated image
One of the reasons the float property in CSS was created was to allow for the appearance of 
text to wrap around an image. This concept was borrowed from print design, where the effect 
is standard practice and often called text wrap or runaround. In CSS, this effect is achieved by 
allowing elements following a floated element in the HTML markup to surround the element, 
effectively changing position. This behavior also makes it possible to create columns on a page, 
although this may not have been the original intent of the rule. 
In this exercise, you will learn the basics of using the float property by applying it to an image 
in order to wrap text.
Follow these steps to create a floated image
Step-by-Step
1.	 From the dw06lessons site, open the floatimage.html page. You will see a page with a 
large paragraph block of text. Click in the middle of the paragraph, immediately before 
the sentence, “We also have added recyclable shopping bags.”
2.	 Now choose Insert > Image and in the Select Image Source dialog box, choose the 
image recycle_bag.gif from the images folder, and choose OK. In the Alt text field, 
type shopping bag and click OK. The image has width and height dimensions of 
81 × 101 pixels and is inserted as a block inside the paragraph as seen in Figure 6-1. 
Figure 6-1: An image with default styling placed inside a paragraph.

Lesson 6
185
Lesson 6: Advanced Page Layout
Layout with AP divs versus layout with floats
The amount of space between the two sentences is determined by the height of the graphic. 
This is the default flow of HTML when an inline image is inserted into a paragraph.
You’ll now wrap the text around the image by applying the float property to the shopping 
bag graphic.
3.	 Make sure the image is still selected and then click the New CSS Rule button in the CSS 
Styles panel. Click the menu for Selector Type and choose Class. In the Selector Name 
text field, type .floatimage and click OK.
4.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box, click the Box category, then click the Float drop-
down menu and choose right. Click OK.
5.	 Make sure the shopping bag graphic is still selected; if it is not, do so now. Look at the 
Property Inspector, there is a Class drop-down menu, which by default is set to None 
(Figure 6-2).
Figure 6-2: The default Class is set to None.
From the Class drop-down menu, choose floatimage as seen in Figure 6-3. With the class 
applied, the image will now be removed from the flow of the text and be pushed far right 
to the edge of the container.
Figure 6-3: Change the Class to floatimage.
6.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the .floatimage rule. In the Box category, click the 
Float drop-down menu and change the value from right to left, then press OK.
The image now floats to the left and the text wraps around it. This wrapping behavior is 
extremely important to keep in mind as you work with floated elements. You can float 
elements to the left or right only.
7.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the .floatimage rule and in the Box category 
uncheck the Same for All checkbox for the Margin, then type a value of 10 for the Top 
and 10 for the Right. Make sure the unit is pixels. Press OK. The image now is set off 
from the text, adding needed space (Figure 6-4).

Lesson 6
8.	 Choose File > Save, and then File > Preview in Browser to see the results in your browser. 
This technique is a simple and useful application of the float property. The next step is to 
apply this same concept to other elements, not just images. In the next exercise, you will 
float div elements to create columns. Close your browser and then close the floatimage.
html document.
Creating columns with HTML and CSS
One of the most important aspects of working with floated elements is understanding how 
they interact with their surrounding elements. This relationship is easy to understand when 
you have an object with a fixed width and height such as the shopping bag graphic from the 
last exercise. When floated elements are objects that are not fixed in size, such as a column 
which is defined by the amount of text inside, things can get interesting. 
Creating the HTML Structure with div elements
To begin, you’ll start with a page similar to the Organic Utopia layout from Lesson 5, 
“Creating Page Layouts with CSS.” Specifically, the container div is 960 pixels wide and styled 
to be centered within the browser. The header has one inline image (the Organic Utopia logo). 
You will first define the structure of the page by adding div elements for the various sections.
Follow these steps to structure an HTML document with divs
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, double-click the layout.html page. Your first step will be to add the 
navigation section.
2.	 In the Insert panel, click the Insert Div Tag button, and the Insert Div Tag dialog box 
opens. Here you can choose where you would like the new div element to be inserted. 
You need the navigation div element to follow the header.
3.	 In the Insert Div Tag dialog box, click the Insert drop-down menu. Select the After tag 
option, then in the drop-down menu to the right, choose <div id="header">. Type 
navigation in the ID text field, then press the New CSS Rule button (Figure 6-5).
Figure 6-5: Set the properties in the Insert Div Tag dialog box.
The New CSS Rule definition dialog box opens. Click OK. You will now add a few 
simple styles to the navigation div.
4.	 In the CSS rule definition dialog box, click the Background category and type #88b036 
into the Background-color text field to add a green background color. Then click the Box 
category and type 100 in the Width text field, then from the drop-down menu to the 
right choose %. Click in the Height text field and type 36, and leave the value set to px. 
Click OK. Click OK again in the Insert Div Tag dialog box. Your navigation section now 
spans across the width of the container.

Lesson 6
187
Lesson 6: Advanced Page Layout
Creating columns with HTML and CSS
You’ll now add three div elements for the main and sidebar columns, as well as the footer. 
These next three steps are essentially variations on step 3: You are adding structural elements 
to your page and giving the elements good names to begin styling them. 
5.	 Click the Insert Div Tag button in the Insert panel. Click the Insert drop-down menu and 
choose the After Tag option, and then in the drop-down menu to the right choose <div 
id="navigation">. Type main in the ID text field and then click OK. 
6.	 Click the Insert Div Tag button in the Insert panel. Click the Insert drop-down menu 
and choose the After Tag option, then in the drop-down menu to the right, choose <div 
id="main">. Type sidebar in the ID text field and then click OK. 
The last section you will add will be for the footer at the bottom of the page.
7.	 Click the Insert Div Tag button in the Insert panel. Click the Insert drop-down 
menu. Select the After Tag option, then in the drop-down menu to the right choose 
<div id="sidebar">. Type footer in the ID text field, click the New CSS Rule button, 
then click OK. You will be adding a background-color style now so you can more easily 
see how the footer interacts with the two columns.
8.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box for the footer, click the Background category and in 
the Background-color text field, type #CCC to add a light gray. Click OK, and then click 
OK again in the Insert Div Tag dialog box. You now have the main sections of your page 
(Figure 6-6), and you now have to start setting the widths of the columns.
Figure 6-6: The main sections of your web page are now created.
Setting the width and floating the columns
With the basic structure of your page set up in HTML, you will now set the width of the main 
and sidebar columns and float them using CSS. You will return to the navigation bar in a later 
exercise.
Follow these steps to float the columns and set the width
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the New CSS Rule button and the New CSS Rule window 
appears. If the Selector Type menu is not set to ID, click on the menu and choose this 
option, then click on the Selector Name menu and from the list that appears choose main 
and then click OK.

Creating columns with HTML and CSS

Lesson 6
2.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box that appears, click the Box category, and then type 
600 inside the Width text field. From the Float drop-down menu, choose right. Click OK 
and you will see the main column moves to the right and the sidebar column moves up to 
fill in the remaining space. Now you’ll add some content to see how it fits into the column.
3.	 In the Files panel, double-click the main_content.html page. Select all the text on 
this page, then press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Command+C (Mac OS) to copy it. Close 
the file, then select the placeholder text in the main div and press Ctrl+V (Windows) or 
Command+V (Mac OS) to paste. The column expands to accommodate all the content. 
Notice that the footer appears to be behind the main column. This is a result of the floated 
properties you just added. You’ll take a look at this shortly, but first you will style the 
sidebar.
4.	 Click inside the sidebar div, then in the CSS Styles panel, click the New CSS Rule button. 
Press the Less Specific button once, and the Selector Name reads #sidebar. Click OK, 
and in the CSS Rule definition dialog box, click the Box category. In the Width text field, 
type 360. From the Float drop-down menu, choose left. Click OK. Visually, very little 
will change, but the two columns now have explicit widths and both are floating. 
5.	 In the Files panel, double-click the sidebar_content.html page. Select all the text on this 
page and copy it. Close the file, and then click inside the sidebar div and paste, replacing 
the placeholder text. The sidebar expands to fit this content, which is a definition list 
(Figure 6-7).
Figure 6-7: The sidebar section is floated to the left and has a width of 360. The main section is floated to  
the right and has a width of 600.
Take Note...
We have cheated a bit in this exercise and created pre-existing styles for the sidebar content. 
Many of the techniques for modifying the margins of elements have been covered in earlier 
lessons. If you’re curious, you may look at the styles for the <dl> and <dd> elements within 
the styles panel or the code view to see the details.
What may be most confusing is the behavior and appearance of the footer div. As noted earlier, 
it appears to be behind your two columns. The reason for this has to do with the nature of 
floated elements. Floated elements are removed from the default flow of HTML and since 

Lesson 6
189
Lesson 6: Advanced Page Layout
Creating columns with HTML and CSS
both columns are floated, the footer ignores them and moves up directly below the navigation 
section. This is also why the height of the footer has expanded. From the perspective of the 
footer, there are no columns to interact with so it assumes its default behavior.
In order to push the footer below the columns, you need to add another CSS property to the 
footer called clear.
Using the clear property
When you apply the clear property to an object, you are essentially adding a rule that says 
No floated elements are allowed on either side of me. In fact, you can specify whether the left, right 
or both sides can have floated elements. You’ll try two different options in order to understand 
the clear property better.
Follow these steps to use the clear property
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #footer style, and click the Box category. From 
the Clear drop-down menu, choose right. Click OK. This puts the footer box on the 
bottom of the page. You may need to scroll down to see it.
Although this seems to do the trick, there is a potential pitfall. You set the clear value to 
right, but what would happen if the content in the main column were shorter than the 
content in the sidebar? Understanding the answer to this question will go a long way 
toward your understanding of floats and clears, so you’ll do a short experiment.
2.	 In the main div, select the last three paragraphs and headings and then delete them. With 
less content in this column now, the footer still behaves the same and stops at the bottom 
of the main column, but the sidebar is longer now so the footer overlaps it as seen in 
Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8: Select and delete the last three paragraphs and headings in the “Main” div.
Of course, you could fix this by switching the value of the clear property from Right to 
Left. This would prevent the footer from being next to the sidebar, but the problem is that 
you may never know which column will have the most content, so the safest solution is to 
apply the clear property to both sides.
3.	 Choose Edit > Undo Delete to bring the content back into the main div.

Lesson 6
4.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the footer style and from the Clear drop-down menu 
choose both, then click OK. The footer div will now always be at the bottom because no 
floated elements are allowed to the left or the right.
Creating a list-based navigation bar
Floats can not only be used for simple image wrapping and creating columns, but also to create 
navigation. Here you’ll start creating a list-based navigation that uses CSS. This is a great 
way to create easily editable navigation bars that are also search engine-friendly because they 
use text instead of images. Additionally, you can think of navigation as simply a list of links to 
other pages, so it makes sense to use the list element. The first step is to add the content and 
then style the list items and the navigation element. 
Follow these steps to create a navigation bar using list items
Step-by-Step
1.	 Select the placeholder text in the navigation div and then click the HTML button in the 
Property Inspector, if necessary. Click the Unordered List button ( ) and the text will 
become the first bullet in an unordered list.
2.	 Replace the placeholder text by typing Home, and then press Return. This adds a new list 
item. Add the following navigation sections pressing Return after each one: About Us, 
Products, Services, Contact. Your layout will appear to break as the list items are added 
(seen in Figure 6-9). Don’t worry; you will be using float properties to turn this list into a 
horizontal navigation bar. 
Figure 6-9: Add the list items that will serve as your navigation.
You will now link the five items. The pages in this case have not been created so you will 
use a placeholder link for each item.

Lesson 6
191
Lesson 6: Advanced Page Layout
Creating a list-based navigation bar
3.	 Select the Home list item, click inside the Link text field in the Property Inspector and 
type # and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This symbol creates a 
placeholder hyperlink. Repeat this step for each list item until all five are hyperlinked.
Now you’ll apply the float property and turn this vertical list into a horizontal one.
4.	 Click the <li> element in the tag selector as seen in Figure 6-10.
Figure 6-10: Select the <li> element in the tag selector.
Click the New CSS Rule button in the CSS Styles panel and choose Less Specific so the 
Compound Selector reads #navigation ul li. Click OK.
5.	 In the Box category, from the Float drop-down menu, choose left. Press the Apply button, 
and you will see that your list items are now stacked horizontally rather than vertically. By 
applying the float property, you have overridden the list items’ default behavior. However, 
there is still more work that you need to do.
6.	 Click the List category, then from the List-style-type drop-down menu, choose none. This 
removes the bullet points from each list item. Click OK. 
You still need to do more work; specifically, you need to create styles for the <a> element 
that is for hyperlinks You’ll style the appearance and position of these links now.

7.	 Click inside any link in the navigation, and then in CSS Styles panel, click the New CSS 
Rule button. The selector type is compound, but unnecessarily complex; press the Less 
Specific button so the Selector Name is set to #navigation ul li a, as seen in Figure 
6-11 and then click OK.
Figure 6-11: Create a new CSS rule for the navigation hyperlinks.
8.	 In the Type category, check the Text-decoration checkbox labeled none. This will remove 
the default underline below your hyperlinks. Click the Color swatch and choose white.
9.	 Click the Box category and uncheck the Same for all checkbox for Padding. Type 8 px 
for the top and bottom values, and 15 px for the left and right values (Figure 6-12). Press 
Apply to see the space added between each hyperlink.

10.	 Click the Block category, and then from the Display drop-down menu, choose block. This 
property and value changes the appearance of the list item: it expands and also allows the 
entire block to be clickable, not just the text. Click OK.
You’re almost finished; however, your navigation links are currently overlapping the 
boundaries of the green navigation bar. This is because of some default margins — a topic 
you have run into before. In this case, the default margins of the unordered list are the 
culprit.
11.	 Click anywhere inside the navigation, if necessary, and then click the <ul> tag in the Tag 
Selector. Then, click the New CSS Rule button in the CSS Styles panel. Press the Less 
Specific button, making sure the selector reads #navigation ul, and then click OK.
12.	 In the CSS Rule definition dialog box, click the Box category and type 0 for Margin 
and Padding (Figure 6-13). Click OK and the hyperlinks are now centered within the 
navigation element.
Figure 6-13: Set the margins for the navigation to give it a more defined look.
The last piece to add is a little interactivity. Say that when the user mouses over any one of 
the navigation links, you would like it to change color. This improves usability by letting the 
user know the links are active. You can do this with the hover property for hyperlinks.

Figure 6-14: Select the a:hover property.
To make the style work in Dreamweaver, type #navigation in front of the a:hover

Changing column layout and size
Changing column layout and size
Another benefit of using floated containers for layout is that they are very easy to modify. For 
example, perhaps you would like to experiment with your sidebar being on the right rather 
than the left, or perhaps you would like to experiment with changing the width of the entire 
layout. This can all be accomplished with a few easy modifications of the styles.
Follow these steps to edit column layout and size
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #main style. Click the Box category, change the 
Float value from right to left, and then click OK. This pushes the main box over to the 
left of the container and the sidebar slips to the right.
2.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #sidebar style, click the Box category, change 
the Float value from left to right, and then click OK. There will be no visual change in 
this case, but it does ensure that the sidebar is flush against the container as seen in Figure 
6-16. That’s it! Two simple style changes create a completely different layout.
Figure 6-16: Change the Float value of the #sidebar style from left to right.
If you’d like to change the overall width of your page layout you can do this by modifying 
the #container div. 
3.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #container style and click the Box category. 
Change the Width from 960 to 1100 and then press Apply. This expands your container, 
and because your columns are floating, they will both remain aligned to their respective 
sides. For the purpose of this exercise, the original value of 960 is better, so type this value 
back again. For now, the important part is to understand the concept.
4.	 While you are here, select the Height value and delete it, leaving it empty. Having a fixed 
height is useful at the beginning of the layout progress, but it should be removed at some 
point in order to accommodate more content. Click OK.
Fine-tune your page: currently, the main column is aligned flush left against the container 
and the text is too close to the edge of the container. This is a common layout problem; 
you will now look at some techniques designed to help you create your own custom 
layouts and to better understand the behavior of floated elements.

Lesson 6
5.	 Double-click the #main style in the CSS Styles panel, and then click the Box category. 
Uncheck the Same for all checkbox for Margin, type 20 inside the left margin, and then 
click OK. Notice that this change had the desired effect of adding space between the main 
column and the surrounding container. However, there is another effect: the sidebar has 
now “slipped” down below as seen in Figure 6-17.
Figure 6-17: Adding 20 pixels of left margin to the #main column.
This effect is to be expected because you are trying to squeeze two boxes into a fixed 
width space. Remember that the container is 960 pixels wide. The main column is 600 
pixels wide, and you just added 20 pixels to it, thus making the true width 620 pixels. The 
sidebar is 360 pixels wide; adding the combined widths results in 980 pixels.
This is a common dilemma with fixed width layouts, but as long as you understand the 
relationships, it is easy to fix. In this case, you’ll try reducing the width of the main 
column.
6.	 Double-click the #main style in the CSS Styles panel, and then click the Box category. 
Change the width from 600 to 580 and press Apply. The width is reduced and the sidebar 
slips back up.
However, you can take this a bit further: the columns are actually very close to each other. 
You can add more space by reducing the width of the main section even further.
7.	 Type 550 as the width, and then click OK. You now have an additional gap of space 
between the main section and the sidebar.
Take Note...
Keep in mind that you could have decreased the width of the #sidebar style if you 
preferred to keep the width of the #main column intact. There are no set rules for how to 
do this correctly. Layout in CSS becomes interplay between width, margins, padding, and 
content; every page has slightly different requirements. Just be sure to keep track of all these 
relationships in your own designs, since it can get confusing as you add more elements.

Lesson 6

Lesson 6: Advanced Page Layout
Creating the appearance of equal height columns
Creating the appearance of equal height columns
There is now another part of your layout that you need to pay attention to: the column height. 
Currently, the main column is longer than the sidebar; visually this isn’t really a problem 
because neither column has a background color, so the whole page appears white. But what 
happens if your design requires that explicit columns be defined by color? In this exercise, 
you’ll look at one solution for this issue. 
Follow these steps to create columns of equal height
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the rule for the sidebar div. Click the Background 
category, then, in the Background-color text field, type #C8D9BC.
2.	 Click the Border category. Uncheck the Same for all checkboxes for Style, Width and 
Color. In the row labeled Left, choose solid in the Style column’s drop-down menu, and 
type 2 in the Width columns text field. In the Color column’s text field, type #060. 
Click OK. The background color and border properties are now added to the sidebar 
(Figure 6-18).
Figure 6-18: Set the border for the #sidebar div.
The problem with the column is an aesthetic one. A column sometimes looks better when 
it spans to the bottom of the page rather than cutting off abruptly. Additionally, if you are 
using this layout throughout your site, every page will likely have different amounts of 
content. As a user moves from page to page, this would create irregular page appearance, 
as the column height jumps up and down based on the amount of content. To solve this, 
you’ll add a background image to the container div, which simulates the appearance of the 
column from top to bottom.
3.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the rule for the container div. Click the Background 
category, and for the Background-image property, press the Browse button and locate the 
container_bg.gif file in the images folder. Click Choose (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
This graphic is 960 pixels wide (which matches the width of your container), but it is only 
2 pixels high. Essentially, it is a thin horizontal slice of the page and includes the sidebar 
color and green border. 

Creating the appearance of equal height columns
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 6
4.	 From the Background-repeat drop-down menu, choose repeat-y. This ensures the graphic 
will only be tiled from top to bottom. Click OK and you will now see your columns filled 
in as seen in Figure 6-19.
Figure 6-19: A “fake column” background image creates the effect of a column extending the height  
of the page.
Now, the length of the column is irrelevant. The image background will always reach the 
bottom of the page and maintain a consistent appearance. 
Take Note...
Although this technique is useful, it relies on your layout being finalized. If the width of your 
container or the position of any of your columns changes, you must then change the background 
image. Additionally, other changes, such as the color of a column or any padding adjustments 
may also require you to modify your background image. For this reason, you should wait until 
the small changes and adjustments to your layout are complete before making a column background.

How to create a fake column background in Photoshop
The easiest way to make the fake column background is if you happen to have a mockup 
of your website as an image file or as a Photoshop file with layers. However, if you 
don’t have a mockup, you need to be more creative. Here’s how we created our page 
background.
1.	
Preview your web page in the browser. Look to make sure you have a clear cross-section of 
your columns from left to right. If there is any text or images in the column, you may need 
to go back to Dreamweaver and remove them temporarily.
2.	
Using your system’s screen capture program, capture your screen. In the Mac OS, this can 
be done with the keyboard shortcut, Command+Shift+3. In Windows, use the Print Screen 
button to capture.
In the case of the Mac OS, this will create a png file that will be saved to your desktop. In the 
case of Windows, this will copy the screen image to your clipboard.
3.	
In Photoshop, either open the screen capture image directly (Mac OS) or if in Windows, 
choose File > New, then press OK and press Ctrl+V.
4.	
Click the Rectangular Marquee tool, then in the Options panel, change the style from 
Normal to Fixed Size. Type in a width of 840 px and a height of 2 px. If your original 
layout has a different width, you will need to change this width value to match.
5.	
Click anywhere in the image with the Marquee tool to add a floating selection. Using your 
arrow keys, you must line up the selection exactly with the edges of the container. If the 
selection is even 1 pixel off it will result in a mismatch between the image and the real 
HTML columns.
6.	
Choose Image > Crop, then choose Save for Web and Devices to save it as a gif, jpg or png. 
Try to optimize the image in order to make it as small as possible. For example, in our case, 
we saved it as a gif using only four colors.
Browser compatibility
Up to this point, the concepts of creating a layout with floats and clears have made sense. 
There may have been some unusual or unexpected behaviors, but for the most part, once you 
understand the rules, you can begin to think about how you can apply this to your own designs. 
That’s the good news. The bad news is that the expected behavior of CSS boxes takes a bad turn 
when we factor older browsers such as Internet Explorer 6 into the equation. 
Due to certain rendering bugs in the browser, the behavior of floated elements can be hard to 
predict, and in some situations can completely “break” a layout. Web designers and developers 
have addressed this unfortunate behavior over the years by adding code fixes for Internet 
Explorer 6 to their style sheets, or by coming up with scripting solutions. 
Adding code for IE 6
In the layout you have built, there is a code fix you will need to add to make the layout 
function well in IE 6. The problem is that the footer div that you cleared will not always be 
pushed below your columns. The bug that causes this can be fixed by “faking” a height for the 
footer. In general, IE 6 doesn’t like floated elements that have no height, so this fix can solve 
many problems.

Lesson 6
Follow these steps to account for IE 6 in your code
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #footer style, and in the Box category, type 1 
for Height. Then click the drop-down menu and choose % as seen in Figure 6-20.
Figure 6-20: Set the Height for the #footer div.
IE 6 needs this height value to prevent the layout from breaking.
2.	 Click OK and although you will not see any change, the layout is now fixed in IE. This 
fix might not have seemed too difficult, but more complex layouts will reveal other 
potential problems, especially when floats become involved. There is also the question 
as to whether you need to add the fix at all for this particular browser; however, this is a 
separate issue.
3.	 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Do I need to optimize for Internet Explorer 6?
As of this writing, Internet Explorer 6 is a ten-year-old browser, and Internet Explorer 7, 
8, and 9 have been released. Each version has improved the rendering of CSS, and in any 
case, the latest statistics have shown that use of Internet Explorer 6 has dropped down 
below 1% in the United States. (Although it is still far larger in other parts of the world. 
See www.ie6countdown for specific details.) 
For many years, the extra code and troubleshooting involved in solving layout issues 
with Internet Explorer 6 was a significant problem that added time to the development 
process. Although this issue is no longer as relevant, the general problem of browser 
compatibility has not gone away. There are still differences between the way browsers 
interpret pages. However, in the year 2012, many of these issues have to do with 
evolving technology, such as CSS3 and HTML5, a topic we cover in more depth in the 
chapters “Mobile Design and Layout,” and “CSS3 Transitions and Web Fonts.”

Applying finishing touches
You’ll now tidy up some loose ends with your layout. Specifically, you’ll add a background 
image to your header, and then move the rules in your current style sheet to an external style 
sheet so you can use these styles for other pages in your site.
Follow these steps to add the finishing touches to your layout
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, double-click the #header style to open it. Choose the Background 
category and then click the Browse button for Background-image. Navigate to the images 
folder located in your dw05lessons folder, choose veggies.jpg and then click Open.
2.	 Click the background-repeat menu and choose no-repeat. Click the Background-
position(x) property and choose right. Click OK. Notice that the veggies image has 
been applied to the right side of your header as seen in Figure 6-21.

Now you will move all the style rules to an external style sheet so you can use these styles 
on new pages.
3.	 In the CSS Styles panel, be sure the All button is selected, click the first style (body), scroll 
down, and then Shift+click the last style (dd). This will select all the styles for the page.
4.	 Click the panel menu (
) at the top right corner of the CSS Styles panel, and choose 
Move CSS Rules.
5.	 Click the radio button labeled A new style sheet and click OK. You’ll be prompted to save 
your style sheet. Type styles in the Save As text field and click OK (Windows) or Save 
(Mac OS). You now have an external style sheet that can be attached to new or existing 
pages in your site. (If you receive a message saying that duplicate names are being copied, 
confirm the save, don’t cancel.)
6.	 Choose File > Save All.
Testing CSS layouts across browsers
Your layout may be looking good in Dreamweaver’s Design view but you always need to test 
your layout in the real world of browsers. The general process looks something like this:
• 
Never rely solely on the design view. Preview your pages in Dreamweaver’s Live view 
first. Live view is the quickest way to see your final design as it will appear in a browser.
• 
If you have multiple browsers on your system preview your page in these browsers and you 
may discover discrepancies that require you to refine your layout.
• 
In order to test your layout in browsers that you may not have access to, consider using a 
service such as Adobe Browserlab which allows you to check your layout in a number of 
different browsers as well as other platforms.
For more specifics on using Adobe BrowserLab refer to Lesson 16.

Troubleshooting CSS issues with Visual Aids
Dreamweaver has a few visual aids built-in to help you understand the CSS box model 
and how it affects your page. 
CSS Layout Outlines
Displays the outlines of all CSS layout blocks on the page. This visual aid is turned on by 
default and can be accessed by choosing View > Visual Aids > CSS Layout Outlines.
CSS Layout Box Model
Displays the box model (padding and margins) of selected CSS layout block. This visual 
aid is turned on by default and can be accessed by choosing View >  Visual Aids > CSS 
Layout Box Model
CSS Layout Backgrounds
Displays temporarily assigned background colors for individual CSS layout blocks, and 
hides any other background colors or images that normally appear on the page. This 
visual aid is not turned on by default and can be accessed by choosing View > Visual 
Aids > CSS Layout Backgrounds.
Creating more sophisticated layouts
The two-column layout you created represents a good foundation for a website. You would 
refer to this as a “Two-column fixed-width layout with a header and footer.” However, you 
may be looking for more options. For example, what about a three-column layout, or a liquid 
layout in which the content adjusts to the width of the browser (also referred to as a flexible or 
fluid layout)? It is beyond the scope of this book to walk through all these options. However, 
Dreamweaver does offer a way to create different layouts on-the-fly. You can choose from a 
gallery of new layouts whenever you create a new page.

column, the None option is the default, but you can also choose from a number of pre-

2.	 Choose the 2 column liquid, left sidebar, header and footer option. Notice that a small

3.	 Choose File > Save As and when prompted, save this file as 2col_liquid.html. Choose File 
> Preview in Browser and adjust the width of the browser and you will see that the width of 
the container page adjusts, as well as the content within. Unlike the layout you created earlier, 
you might choose this layout because it is more adaptable for different sized monitors. 
Take a moment to read the text in this page. It mentions that the code for this page has 
been commented. You’ll take a look at this code now, in order to better understand the 
pros and cons of using these pre-generated pages.
Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
4.	 Click the Code View button and scroll to the top if necessary. The code in light gray 
represents comments that describe virtually every line of the CSS. So why is there a need 
to comment this file so heavily? To make a long story short, the code in this file is very 
robust and is optimized for cross-browser display. This means there are styles that address 
various bugs across different browsers, as well as other relatively advanced CSS code.
This presents a dilemma: You will benefit most from these templates only as long as you know 
how to modify them. In order to modify them effectively, however, you need to understand 
the rules of HTML and CSS relatively well. There is a limit to how far a WYSIWYG (What 
You See Is What You Get) application can take you in learning these rules. 
This should not stop you in exploring these page layouts. They are extremely useful, and 
can be incredible time-savers. Just be aware that reverse-engineering how a page works 
can also be time-consuming, and that the answers may lie in the rules of HTML and CSS, 
and not in the Dreamweaver application.

Dreamweaver Fluid Grid Layout
A new feature in Dreamweaver CS6 is the addition of Fluid Grid Layouts. This is a system 
for creating websites that are alternatively known as adaptive or responsive, meaning that the 
layout of your pages changes depending on the size of the user’s screen. The model for this 
form of layout is in many ways radically different than the techniques presented in this lesson. 
Fluid Grid Layout uses a combination of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create layouts that 
are optimized for mobile devices and monitor screens of different sizes.
The techniques covered in this lesson are very well-tested and reliable in the current crop of web 
browsers; the techniques used for Fluid Grid layout introduce new complexities that are best 
covered in a separate lesson. This is why we cover them in Lesson 15 “Mobile Design and Layout.”

Business Case
The Internet has evolved quite a bit since its inception. Among the new tricks we 
can do are transitions for page elements. The Organic Utopia owners have chosen 
to be on the cutting edge and employ this technology to set them apart from their 
competitors, who are still relying on more conventional approaches. The owners also 
want to use custom fonts for their company’s website—something that was not 
practical just a few years ago, but now is. Using CSS3 capabilities in Dreamweaver 
CS6, you’ll be able to create dynamic transitions and incorporate any font that the 
client wants.

Understanding the role of CSS3

Lesson 7
Understanding the role of CSS3
Cascading Style Sheets is a separate language from HTML; however, both languages are 
constantly evolving. The original CSS1 specification was released in 1996 and included many 
of the basic CSS properties used today, such as background-color, font-family and so on. Over 
the years, new versions of CSS have emerged with revisions and additions to the original 
specification. CSS3 is the latest version of the language and offers a number of new CSS 
properties that give designers new tools for adding style to their pages.
The details of the evolution of CSS are not as important as understanding the key issue: 
browser support. Although CSS3 offers a number of exciting and useful features, designers 
and developers need to know which features the different web browsers can reliably support. 
There are a tremendous number of new features in CSS3, and these features have different 
levels of browser support. Some features you can use today very reliably, others may not be 
supported for years. The architects of CSS3 have broken up the language into categories called 
“modules”; examples include Backgrounds, and Borders and Animation, among others. In this 
lesson, you’ll learn how to use CSS Transitions from the Animation module, and Web Fonts 
from the CSS Fonts module. 
Other tools for animation and interactivity
CSS3 transitions are just the latest option for creating interactive and animated elements on the 
Web. You will be looking at other techniques including Flash animation (Lesson 10, “Adding 
Flash, Video, and Sound Content”) and JavaScript (Lesson 14, “Adding Interactivity with the 
Spry Framework”). The decision as to which version to use is based on a number of factors 
including your target audience and any technical limitations. We discuss these limitations in 
more detail in the relevant lessons, but here is a brief overview:
• CSS3 transitions are best suited for user inteface elements such as buttons and navigation 
bars, however they are not visibile on all browsers, particularly older ones. But CSS3 
transitions are extremely well-supported on modern mobile browsers and are often the best 
option for that audience.
• JavaScript animation and interactivity are more reliable than CSS3 transitions for browsers on 
the desktop and generally work well for mobile. They are not optimized for mobile however 
and more complex JavaScript animation may be harder to style with CSS. 
• Flash animation can give you more creative freedom than either CSS3 or JavaScript 
animation and capabilities such as the drawing tools and the other features of the Flash 
authoring program is far more capable than anything found in CSS3 or JavaScript . The 
current trend, however, is to move away from using Flash for user interface animation and 
to reserve it for dedicated animation projects such as animated movies and games. A large 
reason for this has to do with lack of support for Flash content on mobile devices such as the 
iPhone and iPad.
• Adobe Edge is one of a few applications that promises a workflow allowing you to create 
animations whose output is CSS3 code, not the SWF format (used in Flash). Adobe Edge 
has a timeline editor very similar to Adobe Flash Professional and allows you to add motion 
to graphics and HTML elements. When working with Edge, you are working directly with 
HTML files and the animation is created with CSS3 code.This means that you could create a 
page in Dreamweaver, open this page within Edge, and then create a sophisticated animation. 
When complete, the animation requires no special browser plugin, just a modern browser 
that supports CSS3.

Lesson 7: CSS3 Transitions and Web Fonts 
Adding a CSS Transition
Adding a CSS Transition
CSS Transitions in Dreamweaver CS6 offer you a way to create simple animations on your 
page using only CSS. This is in contrast to the traditional method of creating effects, such as 
image rollovers, using JavaScript or Flash. 
The basic concept of CSS Transitions is this: an object is animated by changing a property 
(or properties) over time. For example, in the following exercise you will start with a box that 
has its height property set to 350 pixels. You will then animate the height property down to 
50 pixels over a period of two seconds. The result will be a slow collapsing effect when the 
user places their cursor over the box.
You’ll start with a simple example file, and then in a later exercise, you will apply CSS 
transitions to the Organic Utopia layout.
Follow these steps to create a CSS transition
Step-by-Step
1.	 Open the 07_csstransitions.html document. Currently, this page has a single style rule 
for the ID #box. You should take a look at these styles before proceeding.
2.	 In the Design view, click the edge of the box to select it. To be sure that you have the 
actual box selected, check for the blue outline that will appear around the box, which 
confirms that it is selected. In the CSS Styles panel, click the All button if necessary, 
and then click the #box style. This will expose the properties currently used. (If your 
Properties panel does not look like Figure 7-1, click on the “Show only set properties” 
icon in the lower-left corner of the CSS Styles panel.)
Figure 7-1: The CSS properties associated with the CSS ID #box.
The properties used here are background-color, border, height, width, font-
family, and text-align. All these properties (and many more within CSS) can be 
animated using transitions.
Pay particular attention to the height property and the value, currently set to 300 pixels. 
You will now create a single transition that will animate the height of the box from the 
original 300 pixels to a more narrow height.

3.	 Choose Window > CSS Transitions to open the CSS Transitions window. This window 
lists all the existing transitions used in a document, and also allows you to Create, 
Remove, and Edit transitions.
4.	 Click the + sign in the upper-left of the CSS Transitions window; the New Transition 
window appears (Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-2: The New Transition window offers a number of options for you to create transition effects.
5.	 Click the Target Rule menu. The only choice available is for #box, the rule you examined 
in Step 2. In more complex documents, you would see all the rules used and could choose 
any of them. Choose #box from this drop-down menu.

6.	 Click the Transition On menu to see all the options available as seen in Figure 7-3. A 
transition starts in one state and then moves to another, but something must trigger the 
transition. This menu lists the various options: active, checked, disabled, enabled, focus, 
hover, indeterminate, and target. You’ll learn more about these options shortly. 
Figure 7-3: The options available within the Transition on menu.
7.	 Choose the Hover option.
8.	 Click inside the Duration field and type 2.
CSS Transitions provide a way to control the speed of animation changes for one or more 
CSS properties. In this instance, you are stating that you want this transition to last two 
seconds. You will return to the two other options—Delay and Timing Function—in the 
next exercise, but first you need to define which property you want to animate.

9.	 Click the + sign at the bottom of the Property section. A menu appears with the entire list 
of CSS properties you can control. Select the height property as seen in Figure 7-4.
Figure 7-4: Choose the height property from the available list of CSS properties.
Take Note...
As this list shows, you cannot animate every single CSS property. For the official list of 
available properties visit:  
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/#animatable-properties-10
10.	 Click inside the field labeled End Value, type 50, and make sure the menu to the right 
remains on pixels (px). The starting height of the box is 300 pixels; using this transition, you 
will change it to 50 pixels over a period of two seconds when the user hovers over the box.
Click the Create Transition button to add it.

Adding a CSS Transition
11.	 Choose File > Save As, type 07_csstransitions_work in the File name and click Save to 
save this file in the dw07lessons folder. Choose File > Preview in Browser.
Place your cursor inside the top of the box; you will see the box animate from the original 
height of 300 down to 50 pixels. As you move your cursor off the box, it begins to 
animate back to its original height as seen in Figure 7-5.
Figure 7-5: When the user hovers over the box, it animates from a starting height of 300 pixels to an ending height of 50.
This is a very basic example of a single CSS transition. In the next exercise, you will add 
more transitions and learn how to edit your existing one.
12.	 Close both the browser window and the original 07_csstransitions.html page. Return to 
Dreamweaver. Keep the 07_csstransitions_work.html file open, since you’ll be working 
with it in the next exercise.
What if you can’t see the transition?
You might not be able to see the transition effect in the last exercise if your web browser 
does not support the transition property. The support for CSS3 Transitions is relatively 
new and not all properties are equally supported across all browsers, specifically the most 
popular versions of Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, and 9. 
At the time of this writing, Microsoft has indicated that Internet Explorer 10 is scheduled 
to support CSS Transitions. The following online resource provides a useful table to help 
you see the level of support for CSS Transitions for past, present, and future (planned) 
browsers.

Lesson 7
Modifying a CSS Transition
Now that you have seen how a CSS Transition works, you’ll now see how to modify the 
existing transition speed, add a delay, and adjust the timing of the animation using a feature 
called Easing.
Before you get started with the modifications, you’ll take a quick look at the CSS code that 
Dreamweaver creates in the background. 
Follow these steps to modify a CSS transition
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the Code View in your document and locate the <style> section at the top; 
specifically, the #box rule. Notice that there are five lines of code that were created by 
adding the transition, starting with -webkit-transition: all 2s; and ending with 
transition: all 2s; (Highlighted in Figure 7-6).
Figure 7-6: The generated transition CSS that was created by Dreamweaver.
Five lines of code may seem like a lot; however, each line is exactly the same code, and 
each targets a specific web browser. The code -webkit-transition: all 2s; begins 
with a “vendor-specific prefix” to target Webkit browsers such as Apple Safari and Google 
Chrome. The code -moz-transition: all 2s; targets Mozilla browsers (Firefox). 
The next two lines, -ms-transition: all 2s; and -o-transition: all 2s; target 
Microsoft and Opera browsers.
The last line, transition: all 2s; is the “official” CSS3 property name for transitions. 
The reason for having five lines of almost-identical code is that each browser has its own 
timeline for supporting a new CSS3 property. For example, Google Chrome may have 
required the prefix -webkit in version 8.0. When it becomes evident that transitions are 
working reliably and are well-liked by designers, Google Chrome might choose to drop the 
requirement for the prefix in version 10.0. The goal is for all browsers to eventually support 
the “official” property transition; the only reason to use the vendor-specific ones would be 
to provide support for older browsers.

2.	 Look below the code for the #box style; you will see the style #box:hover. This code 
represents the trigger you set for the transition in the last exercise.
3.	 Click the Design view to toggle back to your page. Most likely, you will not need to 
modify the CSS transition code by hand, but you should understand where you can find it 
within the CSS, and understand some of the underlying concepts.
4.	 In your CSS Transitions window, click hover and then press the Pencil icon (
) to edit the 
transition (Figure 7-7). 
Figure 7-7: Select hover and then click the Pencil icon  
to edit a transition.
The Edit Transition window opens, allowing you to modify the values you created in the 
last exercise.
Take Note...
You can also double-click hover or div#box to open this window. 
5.	 Select the value 2 inside the Duration field and type 0.5. This will change the duration 
from two seconds to half a second. 
6.	 Click inside the Delay field, type 1, and make sure the menu to the right is set to s (for 
second). Delaying a transition simply means the transition will not begin until one second 
after the user hovers over the box.
7.	 Notice that there is a value in the Timing Function field set to ease. This is the default 
setting, so while you didn’t set this in the last exercise, Dreamweaver fills it in as though 
you had.

Lesson 7
What is easing?
Easing is a term well known in computer animation that you might have seen before, 
particularly if you have used Adobe Flash. Easing allows you to vary the speed of a 
transition over time. For example, you may want an animation to start off slow and then 
speed up, or perhaps the reverse: start off quickly and then slow down.
Dreamweaver CS6 has six options for easing:
Linear
Maintains a constant speed for the duration of the transition.
Ease 
The animation starts slowly, accelerates, and then slows down when approaching the end 
of the transition.
Ease-in
The animation begins slowly, and then progressively accelerates until the end of the 
transition.
Ease-out
The animation starts quickly, and then progressively slows down until the end of the 
transition.
Ease-in-out
The animation starts slowly at the beginning, maintains a steady rate in the middle, and 
then slows down toward the end of the transition.
Cubic-bezier(x1,y1,x2,y2)
Allows you to create a custom animation using the cubic bezier model. A sample value 
might be cubic-bezier(0.4,0.2,0.8,0.7). This particular example would result in an 
animation that starts off slowly and speeds up toward the end of the transition.

8.	 Click the Timing Function menu and choose ease-out (Figure 7-8). The ease-out 
timing will cause the animation to start off quickly and then slow down. (Note that this 
effect will be difficult to see with the new half second duration.)
Figure 7-8: Choose ease-out from the menu of Timing Functions.
9.	 Click the + sign at the bottom of the Property section. You will now animate a second 
property to go with the height transition.

10.	 Choose background-color from the list, and then click the End-Value swatch; the color 
picker appears. Choose a dark pink color, such as #C36 (Figure 7-9).
Figure 7-9: Choose a dark pink color for the background-color property.
Notice that the values for Duration, Delay, and Timing Function are the same. If you want 
to create separate values for the background-color animation, you would need to click the 
menu at the top of the Edit Transition window and change it to “Use a different transition 
for each property.”
11.	 Click Save Transition, and then choose File > Save. Preview the page in your browser 
and place your cursor at the top of the box as seen in the second image in Figure 7-10. 
Remember that there is a one-second delay that you added in Step 5; after this delay, the 
box will change height rapidly and simultaneously fade from gray to pink.
Take Note...
CSS3 transitions are supported in all major browsers except Internet Explorer. The current 
release of Internet Explorer is version 9 (as of this writing), however the next version (10) 
will support CSS3 transitions. For a detailed look at browser support visit: 
http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions.

Adding CSS Transitions to a navigation menu
12.	 Close the browser as well as the 07_csstransitions_work.html file.
In these two exercises, you learned the fundamentals of CSS Transitions on a sample file. 
Now you’ll apply what you’ve learned to a more realistic layout.
Adding CSS Transitions to a navigation menu
User interface elements such as navigation bars, menus, or buttons are great to use with CSS 
Transitions. Subtle animation can add an extra bit of sophistication and style to your pages.
Follow these steps to create a navigation menu with CSS Transitions
Step-by-Step
1.	 Open the 07_nav_transition.html document by double-clicking it in the Files panel.
2.	 Choose File > Preview in Browser to view this page in the browser. Hover over the 
navigation as seen in Figure 7-11 to see the default styles. The effect you are seeing is a 
traditional CSS2 hover effect, the background color of a list item changes to a lighter green 
when the cursor is hovering over it. However, the change is instant, in CSS2 syntax, you 
have no control over how long it takes to go from the darker green to the lighter green. In 
CSS3 syntax, you do have this control using transitions. You will add a transition to make 
the hover effect more interesting.
Figure 7-11: The current hover effect is either on or off.
Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
3.	 If your CSS Transitions window is not currently open, do so now by choosing Window > 
CSS Transitions.

style for list items that are also hyperlinks inside the navigation div.)
Figure 7-12: Choose the #navigation ul li a style from the menu.
5.	 Click the Transition On menu and choose hover.
6.	 Click the + sign in the Property section and choose background-color from the list. For 
Duration, type 400; click the menu to the right and change it from s to ms (milliseconds). 
Leave the delay set to 0. For the Timing Function, choose ease-in-out and for the End 
Value, type #9FCC41. (This color matches the one currently used.)
You’ll now combine another effect by changing the foreground color of the text inside the 
navigation.
7.	 Click the + sign in the Property section and choose color from the list. By default, 
this second property is inheriting all the values added for the first value. You want more 
control, so you’ll have to define separate rules for this color property.

Using CSS3 for web page layout
In the preceding exercise you learned one small aspect of CSS3 (transitions). However there are 
other elements of CSS3 that have enormous potential to change the way designers work with 
page layout and elements such as drop-down menus, accordion panels and other user interface 
controls.
Currently, the most reliable method of creating these types of page components is to use a 
combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (and perhaps image files for textures or gradients). 
This is the technique you will learn in Lesson 14 “Adding Interactivity with the Spry 
Framework.” Using some or all the following features found in CSS3 you could create similar 
controls without any JavaScript or image files. 
• CSS3 Shapes
Using a combination of the CSS3 border-radius property and CSS3 transforms it is possible to 
create basic primary shapes such as circles, rectangles, diamonds, arrows and more. These can 
be used instead of graphics to create the components of a navigation bar, for example.
• CSS3 Gradients
The CSS3 gradient feature can replace the type of linear and radial gradients currently created 
in applications such as Illustrator and Photo-shop. The linear-gradient property could be 
applied to button or navigation menu background for example.

Lesson 7
225
Lesson 7: CSS3 Transitions and Web Fonts 
Adding web fonts to your site
• CSS3 :target selector
Not all of CSS3 is related to visual styling. Improvements in functionality are also part of 
the specification. For example the CSS3 pseudo-lector named :target. This feature is similar 
to the existing :hover pseudo-selector (which defines what happens when a user places their 
cursor over a link). The :target pseudo-selector allows you to target sections of an element 
(such as a paragraph) and do something to it such as turn its visibility off or on. In terms of 
page components you could use :target to create a tabbed system on your pages, something that 
today is most often accomplished with JavaScript.
There are many more areas of CSS3 to explore, the dilemma with all these cool features comes 
down to browser support. If you decide to use any CSS3 features (especially those that provide 
significant functionality such as a menu) you need to take a hard look at the current state of 
browser support for the feature and look into using fallbacks if the feature is not supported.
The basics of web fonts
The limited choice of fonts for the Web has been a problem for many years. (The way fonts 
work on the Web was outlined in Lesson 3, “Adding Text and Images.”) The core issue is that 
if you define a specific font in your CSS and a visitor to your site does not have that font, a 
substitute font is used. If you do not specify any font-family at all, the default font will be Times 
New Roman. Unfortunately, the list of fonts that are guaranteed to be installed on all users’ 
computers is very small. As a result, over the years designers have looked for alternatives and 
workarounds to this limitation, but none of these techniques have had overwhelming success.
However, there is now an accepted technique called Web Fonts in Dreamweaver CS6; 
technically, this is a feature of CSS3 called @font-face. The use of web fonts has gained 
industry support from designers and developers, and more importantly, from companies that 
make and license fonts. Simply put, CSS web fonts allow you to embed any font within a 
page by declaring the font you want to display and placing this font on your web server. When 
a user visits your site, their browser renders the page using this font wherever specified. Adding 
web fonts is a straight-forward process in Dreamweaver CS6; however, there are some details 
(technical and legal) that you need to be aware of.
Adding web fonts to your site
In this exercise, you will add the web font “Droid Sans Bold” (which is licensed for web 
use) to your website, embed that font so that it is available for use on a page, and then style a 
heading with the new web font.
Follow these steps to style text using a web font
Step-by-Step
1.	 Open the 07_webfonts.html document by double-clicking it in the Files panel.
There are a few steps you should take before adding a web font. In this example, you will 
style the first heading, “Welcome to organic utopia.” You should first understand where 
the current style comes from.

Lesson 7
2.	 In the Design view, click anywhere inside the heading, “Welcome to organic utopia.” You 
can easily determine this is a Heading 1 element in two ways: 1) The tag selector indicates 
this is an <h1>; and 2) In the HTML section of the Property Inspector at the bottom of 
your page, you can see that Heading 1 is the value of the Format (Figure 7-15).
Figure 7-15: You can identify this element as a Heading 1 using either the Tag Selector or the Property Inspector.
You should also determine the style that is currently used for the heading.
3.	 Click the <h1> tag in the tag selector to highlight the tag. In the CSS Styles panel, click 
the Current tab. Adjust the height of the Rules and Properties sections inside the CSS 
Styles panel as needed.

Lesson 7: CSS3 Transitions and Web Fonts 
Adding web fonts to your site
You are looking for the rules used to style this heading, and there are three: body, 
#container, and #main. This tells you that there is no CSS style for an h1 on this page. 
Click the body rule as seen in Figure 7-16.
Figure 7-16: Identifying the styles applied to the h1.
The body rule indicates that the following properties are used: a color of #333; the 
font-family “Lucida Sans Unicode,” “Lucida Grande,” sans-serif; and the font-size small. 
Remember that the word “cascading” is part of Cascading Style Sheets, and you are seeing 
that effect here. The font Lucida Sans is defined in the body, and because there are no 
other styles for h1, the cascade is in effect, so it inherits the color and font-family styles.
Lucida Sans is a font that is extremely common on most users’ computer systems; you’ll 
now add a web font that is not so common.
4.	 Choose Modify > Web Fonts; the Web Fonts Manager window opens. This dialog box 
will allow you to embed fonts that are located in your system.
5.	 Click Add Font; the Add Web Font dialog box appears (Figure 7-17).

The use of web fonts has been complicated because you cannot use a single font 
format and have it supported across all browsers. The following table lists the level of 
browser font support for the different font types. Essentially, it comes down to the 
need to include them all if you want your font styles to be consistent.
The following table lists the various levels of support for the different font-types:

• OpenType (OTF): A widespread font format that is heavily supported by the industry. 
Initially developed as a collaboration between Adobe and Microsoft, one of the primary 
advantages of OpenType is cross-platform support. However, there are additional typesetting 
features, including glyph support, that make OpenType fonts the primary font of choice for 
professional font foundries.
• TrueType (TTF): Originally developed by Apple and later adopted by Microsoft, TrueType 
fonts are still widely in use today as they are largely cross-platform compatible and also offer 
sophisticated typesetting controls, such as hinting, which is a technique that improves the 
quality of the font in low resolution screens.
• SVG: A vector-based format that is notable because it is currently the only font type supported 
by Apple’s iOS for iPod and iPad devices. SVG fonts are text documents that define the font 
outlines as vector objects within the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic) language.
• Web Open Font Format (WOFF): The latest addition to the world of web fonts, WOFF 
has the potential to become a standard for web fonts, since it is in the final stages of being 
recommended as a standard by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). One of the key 
benefits of WOFF is the ability to heavily compress the font files and optimize them for 
distribution over an Internet connection.
• Embedded OpenType (EOT): A variation on OpenType created by Microsoft and largely 
supported only by Internet Explorer. EOT has a variety of copy-protection features built-in, 
designed to prevent copying of fonts.

Styling your heading with a web font
10.	 Click OK. You will now see Droid Sans Bold listed in your Available Web Fonts 
(Figure 7-18).
Click the Done button in the Web Fonts Manager.
Figure 7-18: The Web Fonts Manager lists the available fonts for your current site.
At this point, your new web font, Droid Sans Bold, has been made available to all existing 
pages and any new pages in the current site. Additionally, this web font will be available to any 
document in Dreamweaver, even if it is part of another site.
Font Licensing
Understanding the rules of font licensing is an important part of using web fonts. You 
can technically add a font to a page, but this does not mean you are always allowed to. 
The fonts on your system may have specific licenses that only let you use them in print 
or for other specific uses. Even if you have paid for a font, this still does not necessarily 
mean you have paid for the web license of this font. You will need to ensure that you are 
allowed to use the fonts you add with the Web Font Manager. 
For more information on web font licensing issues, visit the Web Font Licensing FAQ 
from the Adobe Type Team:
http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/web-font-licensing-faq
Styling your heading with a web font
In addition to the legal licensing limitations involved with web fonts, there is also an aesthetic 
consideration. Not all fonts are designed to be rendered on the screen. The creators of a typical 
font are often more concerned with how the font renders in print or how the font looks at 
small sizes versus large sizes (or vice-versa). The web font you are using, Droid Sans Bold, was 
specifically designed to render well on small and large screens alike. Many designers still feel the 
majority of web fonts work best as headings rather than as large blocks of body text in paragraphs. 
This is a matter of interpretation and will likely change as more fonts are released for web use. 
In this exercise, you will style your main heading with your new web font option.

Lesson 7
Follow these steps to style a heading with a web font
Step-by-Step
1.	 Make sure you have clicked inside the Heading 1 labeled, “Welcome to organic utopia.” In 
the tag selector, make sure you click the <h1> tag as seen in Figure 7-19.
This highlights your Heading 1 and makes it easier for Dreamweaver to understand that 
you want to target this style.
Figure 7-19: Click the <h1> tag in the Tag Selector to select the top heading.
2.	 Click the CSS button in the Property Inspector if you are not currently in this view. Now 
click the Font menu; toward the bottom of this list, you will see Droid Sans Bold. Select 
this choice to apply it, and the New CSS Rule window will appear because there has not 
been a style defined for a <h1> element yet.

Lesson 7: CSS3 Transitions and Web Fonts 
Styling your heading with a web font
3.	 Click the Selector Type menu and choose Tag. Dreamweaver will recognize you have 
selected an h1 element, so this is the style that will be created. In other words, all Heading 
1 elements will have the Droid Sans Bold font style. If Dreamweaver is attempting to 
create a Compound selector, press the Less Specific button until only h1 remains in the 
Selector Name field as seen in Figure 7-20.
Figure 7-20: Although you have applied the web font style, it may not be reflected in the Design view.
4.	 Click OK. You have just applied the font style to your heading, but you might not see this 
change in your Design view. This is a limitation for some web fonts; you will only see an 
accurate view in the browser or in Dreamweaver’s Live View.
5.	 Click Dreamweaver’s Live View; you will see your heading set in Droid Sans Bold. You may 
not notice the difference immediately because Droid Sans and Lucida Sans are fairly similar; 
however, if you compare the letter “g” in the word organic to the letter “g” in the heading 
further down the page (One stop shopping), you will see the difference.
You can still use certain CSS formatting to make the web font-styled heading more 
distinctive. You’ll now add a style to make the heading uppercase.
6.	 In the CSS Styles panel, choose All and locate the stylesheet.css link. Notice that 
@font-face is listed. You will likely never modify this style—it is simply worth pointing 
out that is has been created. Double-click this h1 rule to open the CSS rule definition 
window.

Where can I get more fonts?
As noted earlier, you should only use web fonts that have been licensed for that purpose. 
Many individual font foundries, such as Adobe and Monotype, have their own policies and 
systems for using web fonts. However, there are a growing number of online resources that 
provide designers and developers with web fonts that are properly licensed, and in many 
cases, are free or open-source. You should explore these options, but be aware that you may 
not find your favorite fonts listed here.
Fontsquirrel
This site offers a number of free fonts that are licensed for commercial work. The site is 
also a good resource for creating your own web fonts using the @font-face.

Google Web Fonts provides a large number of free open-source fonts for use in your 
projects. It also provides a convenient way to sort and filter through the numerous 
options.

Objective 
Import tabular data to a web page
4.11
Business Case 
Up until now, Organic Utopia owners have provided simple copy and images for 
the site. Now, they’re providing information such as tabular data from spreadsheet 
programs and you need to incorporate this into your pages. This requires using 
HTML tables that are designed to display certain types of data into your web projects.
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw08lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw08lessons folder Go to 
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
Using tables in web design
Tables are ideally suited for displaying tabular data. As discussed in Lesson 5, “Creating Page 
Layouts with CSS,” in the beginning days of the Web, tables were the best tools available 
for designers when it came to layout. Over the years, Dreamweaver has steadily introduced a 
number of tools and visual aids to help people work with tables. Dreamweaver has mirrored 
the Web in that it has begun to shift its focus to CSS layout rather than table layout. Slowly, 
the table is reclaiming its original purpose: displaying tabular data.
In this lesson, you will learn how to automatically import and format existing data into a table. 
You will also explore how to modify rows and columns, style tables with CSS, and create new 
tables from scratch.

Importing table data
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
240
Lesson 8
Importing table data
You’ll get a chance right away to see tabular data in action by importing a .csv file into 
Dreamweaver. Tabular data refers to data that has been exported from a spreadsheet and 
can be formatted by Dreamweaver as a table. A majority of tabular data is exported from 
spreadsheet programs in the .csv (comma-separated values) and .txt (text) file formats. These 
are called comma, tab, or other delimited files. Essentially this means that a spreadsheet 
application converts the data within its rows and columns to an intermediate format that 
Dreamweaver can read.
Although Dreamweaver can open these files, it does not format them directly. With a comma-
delimited file, for example, each column value is separated by a comma and each line break 
starts a new row. In Figure 8-1 you can see how Dreamweaver displays the raw .csv file that 
you are going to be working with:
Figure 8-1: The text editor’s view of a comma-delimited file.
When imported into Dreamweaver, this file will be translated accordingly into the rows and 
columns of a new table.
Follow these steps to import table data
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, double-click the tips.html file to open it. This is a styled page for the 
tips section of the OrganicUtopia site. You will be inserting a .csv file with data on the 
vegetable-growing zones of North America.
2.	 Click after the last sentence in the main paragraph and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) to make sure your cursor is below the text. Choose File > Import > Tabular 
Data. The Import Tabular Data dialog box opens.
3.	 In the Import Tabular Data dialog box, press the Browse button and locate the 
temperate_zones.csv file in your dw08lessons folder. Press Open.

4.	 Click on the Delimiter menu to see the various options that are available. In your case, you 
will be choosing Comma. In the Table width section, leave the Fit to data option selected 
as seen in Figure 8-2. 
Figure 8-2: The settings in the Import Tabular Data dialog box affect the way a table is created.
Take Note...
You can either set a specific width for the generated table or let Dreamweaver construct the 
table automatically, based on the line-length of the incoming data.
5.	 Press OK and your table is imported into your document below the text. Your table is 
imported with 3 columns and 12 rows as seen in Figure 8-3. A quick way to confirm this 
is to look in the Property Inspector, where there is a field for columns and rows as well as 
other useful ways to work with tables.
Figure 8-3: A three-column and 12-row table generated by Dreamweaver from a comma-delimited file.
6.	 Press Dreamweaver’s Code view button to see the code that makes up this table. It’s safe to 
say that this is something you would not want to code by hand.
The table is now ready to be formatted according to your specifications. As you can see, 
you can save yourself a lot of time if your source data is properly formatted. Dreamweaver 
creates a table for you with all the data properly placed, eliminating the need for you to 
build a table, and type, or copy and paste, content into each cell.

Selecting table elements
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
242
Lesson 8
Selecting table elements
It’s worth taking a few moments to learn how to select the various elements of your table. 
Selecting a specific part of a table can be little tricky until you learn how. In this exercise, 
you’ll look at ways to select a table’s rows and columns both by hand and using controls in the 
Property Inspector. The components of a table include rows, columns, and cells, and other 
elements such as table headers and footers. The table you created needs some modification. It’s 
rare that a table is created exactly right, and making small tweaks to the column widths and 
the row heights is the norm.
Follow these steps to select table elements
Step-by-Step
1.	 Press the Design view button in the Document toolbar and click anywhere on the 
background of the page. In this case you do not want the table to be selected. Without 
clicking, place your cursor over the edges of the table; you see the different sections of the 
table light up with a red border. Also notice that your cursor switches to a black arrow. The 
red border is Dreamweaver’s visual cue for which part of the table you will be selecting, 
and the black arrow points in the direction of the row or column to be selected.
2.	 Place your cursor high in the upper-left corner until the entire table is outlined in red as 
seen in Figure 8-4. Click once, and the table is selected.
Figure 8-4: A red border designates which section of the table you are selecting—in this case, the entire table.
3.	 Place your cursor to the left of the word Zone until you see the top row outlined; click 
once to select the row.
4.	 Move your cursor to the top of the word Zone until you see the numbered column 
outlined in red; click once to select the column. 
Selecting a single cell is a little trickier, as the red outlines only appear when your cursor is 
on the edge of a table, not inside of one.
5.	 Click inside the cell with the word Zone. In order to select the cell, use the tag selector 
at the bottom-left of your document window. These tags are an alternative way to select 
parts of the table.

Lesson 8
243
Lesson 8: Working with Tables
Modifying table size
6.	 Click on the <table> tag first; this selects the table just as you did in step 2. Click on the 
<tr> tag next; this selects the table row. The <tr> tag appropriately stands for table row. 
Lastly, click on the <td> tag, and the cell itself is selected as seen in Figure 8-5; <td> is 
defined as a table cell in HTML. Note that in each of these cases the selected element is 
outlined in black.
Figure 8-5: Clicking on the appropriate table tag in the tag selector selects that part of the table.
Some people prefer this method of selecting elements of their tables because it removes the 
chance that clicking on the table will move or modify it.
7.	 Click inside any cell in the table again, and choose Modify > Table > Select Table. This is 
yet another way to select tables. The Modify > Table command is one you’ll be returning 
to. You can also select the table by right-clicking (Windows) or Ctrl+clicking (Mac OS) 
the table and choosing Table > Select Table from the contextual menu.
Modifying table size
Although importing tabular data from a text file is quick and easy, the data is seldom formatted 
perfectly. When you first imported the data, there was a choice to Fit Table Width To Data. 
The width of the table, when you choose this option, isn’t always predictable due to the way 
Dreamweaver does its calculations. Although it is possible to set the width of the table during 
the import stage, this isn’t always convenient if you don’t know what the data looks like. 
Luckily, it’s easy to change the size of tables in Dreamweaver. The first thing you’ll do is set a 
fixed width for the table.
Follow these steps to modify the table size
Step-by-Step
1.	 If your table is not currently selected, select it now using any of the methods you learned 
in the last exercise. In the Property Inspector, type 550 in the W text field and make sure 
the drop-down menu to the right is set to pixels, then press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS). This expands the table to a width of 550 pixels.

Modifying table size
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
244
Lesson 8
Look closely at the top of your table; there is a visual guide outlined in green that displays 
the width of your table as well as the width of each column. This guide will come in 
handy when you are trying to create precisely measured tables, although it can also be 
turned off.
Take Note...
You can turn off this guide by choosing View > Visual Aids > Table Widths. 
2.	 Choose File > Save, then File > Preview in Browser and open this page in your browser. 
Resize the browser window a few times. Because the table has a fixed width of 550 pixels, 
its width stays constant. Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
3.	 In the Property Inspector, your table should still be selected. In the W (Width) text field, 
type 75 and choose % from the drop-down menu to the right (Figure 8-6); notice a 
change in your table width in the Design view.
Figure 8-6: You can set the table width to a percentage of the browser window by using the Property Inspector.
Choose File > Save, then preview the page in your browser again and resize the browser 
window. The table width now resizes because you set it to be a percentage rather than a 
fixed width. Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
4.	 Reset your table to the original width by typing 550 in the W text field and choosing 
pixels from the drop-down menu. 
You also have the ability to resize the columns and rows in the Design view. You can do 
this manually using the Property Inspector
5.	 Place your cursor inside the table and then over the dividing line between the first column 
and the second column. Your cursor changes to a double-arrow. Click and drag slowly to 
the right to expand the width of the first column. N notice at the top of the two columns 
that there are blue numbers that update with the width of the columns. This has the effect 
of reducing the second column’s width, although it leaves the third column’s width alone. 

Lesson 8
245
Lesson 8: Working with Tables
Modifying table structure
6.	 Expand the first column to at least 50 pixels; the content in the second column breaks to 
the next line. Place your cursor on the dividing line between the second and third column, 
and click and drag slowly to narrow the width of the third column (thereby expanding the 
width of the second column). This example uses values of 390 pixels for the third column 
and 88 pixels for the second. 
Take Note...
If you are mathematically inclined, you may have noticed that the three column values don’t 
add up to 550. This is because there are additional factors of cell padding, cell spacing, and 
borders to consider.
Oftentimes, approximate column widths are not sufficient; Dreamweaver allows you to 
apply exact column widths in the Property Inspector.
7.	 Place your cursor above the first column until the red outline appears, and click once to 
select the column. The bottom half of the Property Inspector expands, allowing you to 
adjust the properties of only this column. Type 45 into the W text field. The width does 
not appear to change dramatically, but it is now 45 pixels (Figure 8-7).
Figure 8-7: Selecting a column and entering a specific width in the Property Inspector sets the column to that width.
8.	 Click above the second column to select it. Type 100 into the W text field. Click above 
the third column and type 400 in the W text field. (This will have little effect on the 
appearance of the table.) 
You also have the ability to create a fixed height for rows.
9.	 Click on the left edge of the top row to select the whole row. In the Property Inspector, 
type 35 in the H text field, and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to apply the 
change.
Modifying table structure
In addition to modifying the width of columns and rows, the structure of a table often needs 
to be modified (for example, adding and deleting rows and columns, as well as merging cells 
in the column). First, you’ll add a new row to the top of your table and then convert it to a 
header row. There are a few ways to add rows and columns in Dreamweaver, you’ll begin with 
the Modify > Table command.

box opens.
3.	 The Insert Rows radio button should be selected. For Number of rows, leave the default

to add the new row to the top of the table.
Figure 8-8: Use the Insert Rows and Columns dialog box to add  
new rows or columns to an existing table.
4.	 Place your cursor on the left side of the new row until the red outline appears. Click 
once to select it. In the Property Inspector, locate the Header checkbox and check it to 
designate this row as a Header row. Behind the scenes, Dreamweaver uses the HTML 
<th> tag to define this as a table header. This will help you style your table later on.
Now you’ll merge the three cells in this top row in order to add the header text that will 
span across your columns.
5.	 With the top row still selected, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) to open a 
contextual menu. Choose Table > Merge Cells, and the three cells merge into one. This is 
referred to as columnspan.
6.	 Click inside this merged cell and type US temperate zones with average min.

Creating a table
Creating a table
In addition to creating a table from tabular data, you can also create a table from the ground up 
using Dreamweaver’s Insert Table command.
Follow these steps to create a new table
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click to the right of your existing table, and then press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS) two times. You will be placing a second table two lines below the first.
2.	 Choose Insert > Table, and the Table dialog box opens. Type 12 in the Rows text field, 
and 2 in the Columns text field. Type 550 in the Table width text field to match the width 
of your first table and make sure the drop-down menu is set to pixels. Set the Border 
thickness value to 1 if it is not already. 
The Cell padding and Cell spacing values should have no value (Figure 8-10); you’ll return 
to these properties shortly.
Figure  8-10: The Insert > Table command creates a new table.
3.	 In the Header section, select the third option, Top, in order to designate the top row as the 
header. 
4.	 In the Caption field, type Best months to plant vegetables (Zones 4–7). Table 
captions are a bit more specific than table headers. A table caption is a short description 
of the table contents and has its own <caption> element; by default, they are displayed 
centered and at the top of the table. 
Table captions are not required, but they are useful, especially from an accessibility 
perspective, as they supply useful information to screen readers and other devices. Press 
OK to insert the table.
5.	 Below the caption, in the first cell of the first column, type Month. In the first cell of the 
second column, type Vegetables to Plant. Your columns may shift; in order to adjust 
them, click on the divider between the two columns, and click and drag it as necessary to 
visually divide the two columns evenly.
6.	 In the second row of the Month column, type April, then five rows below, type May.

type each vegetable name in its own row—first Carrots and then Spinach. Skip one row 
and, making sure you are beginning in the same row as May, type Corn, Tomatoes, 
Peppers, Cucumbers.(Figure 8-11)
Figure 8-11: Press keyboard arrows to quickly move from one cell to another when typing text.

the rows.

Formatting and styling tables in HTML
There are two different paths to take when it comes to styling a table. The first method is to 
use HTML tag properties to modify attributes such as the cell padding, border, and background 
color in a table. However, these same attributes can also be controlled with the second method, 
CSS. It’s fair to say that there are more options for styling a table with CSS; however, styling a 
table with HTML tags is faster for most people. Which method you choose often depends on 
the project specifications. You’ll be learning both methods here so that you have the option 
to choose. You’ll also get a chance to consider the pros and cons of both methods. First, you’ll 
start off with the traditional method of styling tables with HTML tags and properties.

Lesson 8

Lesson 8: Working with Tables
Formatting and styling tables in HTML
Follow these steps to style a table in HTML
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the second table you created (Best months to plant vegetables), click on the edge of 
the header row to select it. In the Property Inspector, click on the HTML category, 
if necessary, and then click the Bg (Background) color swatch. In the left column of 
swatches, choose the light gray (#CCCCCC). The background color of the header row 
changes to gray. (Figure 8-12)
Figure 8-12: Select a row and click the Bg color swatch to apply a background color.
2.	 Click inside the April cell, then drag down and to the right until you reach the cell 
containing the text Spinach; this selects all the cells in these four rows and two columns.
3.	 Click in the Bg swatch text field and type #FFFCCC, a light yellow swatch in the lower-
right corner. All four rows now have the same background color.
4.	 Click on the left edge of the empty row above the row labeled May. Click the Bg color 
swatch and choose white for this background color. Then click in the May cell and drag 
down and to the right to the last cell containing the text Cucumbers. Click the Bg color 
swatch and choose the light pink color swatch, #FFCCFF, in the bottom-right corner.
Now, you will center the text in your columns.
5.	 Click at the top of the first column to select it. In the Property Inspector, from Horz 
(Horizontal) drop-down menu, select Center (Figure 8-13). Select the second column and 
repeat this step to center this text.
Figure 8:13: Select a column and click the Center option in the Horizontal menu of the Property Inspector.
6.	 Choose File > Save, then File > Preview in Browser. Your text is visually categorized by 
background color now, but it would be a stretch to say that this is a visually pleasing table. 
There are a few other properties that you can adjust to make this table look a bit better. 
Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver. 
You’ll now examine the properties of cell padding.

Lesson 8
7.	 Click in one of the corners of the table until the entire table is outlined in red. Then click 
on the table to select it. In the Property Inspector, locate the text field for CellPad and 
type 10. Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to apply the change. There are now 
10 pixels of space added to the inside of all cells. This has the effect of giving your text a 
bit more breathing room from the borders around it. 
Cellpad is a property that determines the amount of space, measured in pixels, between 
the sides of a cell and its contents.
8.	 With your table still selected, locate the text field for CellSpace in the Property Inspector. 
Type 10 in the CellSpace text field, then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
commit the change (Figure 8-14). The table changes appearance again. This time, the 
width between the cells is increased.
Cellspace is the property that determines the amount of space between your cells.
Figure 8-14: A table with cellpadding of 10 pixels and cellspacing of 10 pixels.
The space between the cells (the cellspacing) is taking on the properties of the background 
color. Unfortunately, you cannot control the color of the cellspacing, and so you will 
actually remove it completely.
9.	 In the Property Inspector, type 0 in the CellSpace text field and press Enter (Windows) 
or Return (Mac OS). This removes cellspacing completely. At this point, you only have 
properties for cellpadding. 
10.	 With the table still selected, locate the text field for Border; it is currently set for 1 pixel, 
which is the default setting used when a table is created. Replace this value with 0 and press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). This removes the border completely. 
This trick of removing borders completely is used quite a bit with pure HTML tables. This 
is because there are no good ways to control the appearance of borders using pure HTML. 
Increasing the border size creates a thick, beveled look that can detract from the rest of 
your page. Better control for borders exists in CSS.

11.	 Place your cursor on the small black square on the lower-right of the table until you see 
the double-arrow. Click and drag the table to the left to reduce its width. You can use the 
value at the top of the table if you choose, or just change the width until you’re satisfied. 
The figure 8-15 below uses a new width of 350 pixels. 
Figure 8-15: Click and drag the edge of a table to reduce the width.
12.	 With the table still selected, press the Split view button in order to see the code generated 
for this table (Figure 8-16). In the first line of the table, you see the settings for the width, 
height, border, and cell padding. In all the <td> or cells, you see the properties for 
alignment and background color repeated for every row. This extra code is part of the 
tradeoff for the easy application of the color and alignment. Part of the dilemma with this 
table now is that the alignment and background color settings, as well as the cellspacing, 
cellpadding, and border settings, are not linked to your CSS in any way.

Formatting and styling tables with CSS

Lesson 8
One problem of creating pure HTML tables is the inability to quickly copy the style of one 
table and apply it to another. Because the content of the table and the style are intertwined, it’s 
hard to separate one from the other. The larger problem is that pure HTML tables have none 
of the benefits associated with CSS. If your tables are not linked to any CSS, what happens 
when you redesign your website? As you saw in the last lesson, a simple change in CSS code 
can change the background color of your entire site. If the design of your tables clashes with 
your page, you have a lot of work to do as you locate each table and tweak it to fit.
Formatting and styling tables with CSS
In this exercise, you’ll style your initial table using many of the same concepts covered in the 
previous exercise, such as padding and borders, but this time you’ll do it with CSS. There 
is a little bit more work involved initially, but the result will be a table that not only is more 
visually appealing than an HTML-based table but also has a reusable style that can be applied 
to new tables. It’s possible to create tag-based styles for all your tables—in other words, to 
create CSS rules for the various HTML table elements (<td>, <tr>, and so on). In fact, this is 
not a bad idea when creating a default style for tables in a website. In this example, however, 
you will be creating a class style that can readily be applied to different tables. It’s not unusual 
to have three or four different styles of tables in a large website, each with their own CSS class 
definitions.
First you’ll start by creating general rules for the background color, border, and font appearance 
of the table; then you’ll create more specific rules as you drill down into the table.
Follow these steps to style a table using CSS
Step-by-Step
1.	 Press the Design View button to return to this view. Select the first table you created (US 
Temperate Zones…) by clicking on one of the corners when you see the red outline. If 
necessary, choose Window > CSS Styles to open the CSS Styles panel. In the CSS Styles 
panel, click on New CSS Rule button at the bottom of the panel; the New CSS Rule 
dialog box appears.
2.	 In the Selector Type drop-down menu of the New CSS Rule dialog box, leave the default 
choice of Class selected. In the Selector Name text field, type styledtable. Remember that 
class names are up to you, and choosing a name that is easy to identify and remember is 
the goal.

3.	 From the CSS Rule definition drop-down menu, select the mystyles.css external style 
sheet (Figure 8-17) . This is an important step because you would like to add these styles 
to your external style sheet rather than writing them to the tips.html page only. 
Figure 8-17: Creating a new class for the style of the table and defining it in the  
external style sheet.
4.	 Press OK, and the CSS Rule definition dialog box opens. Select the Background category 
and click the Background-color swatch. Choose the color white (#FFF) and press OK. 
You see no changes onscreen because you need to apply the .styledtable class to the 
table. You’ll do that now, and then return to adding more styles.
5.	 Your table should still be selected; if it isn’t, then select it now. In the Property Inspector, 
the table properties should be active. (If you are seeing the HTML and CSS properties, 
you have not selected the table.) On the right side of the Property Inspector, choose 
styledtable from the Class drop-down menu to apply the class as seen in Figure 8-18. The 
background of your table changes to white.
Figure 8-18: Apply a class to a table by choosing the class name in the Property Inspector.

Lesson 8
Now you’ll return to the styledtable class style and add additional properties. You could 
have created all your rules first and then applied the styledtable class; however, doing it this 
way allows you to preview your styling in real-time. Now you’ll add some borders and 
change the font-styling for the entire table.
6.	 Double-click on .styledtable in the CSS Styles panel to reopen the CSS Rule 
definition dialog box. From the Font-family drop-down menu, choose the Verdana, 
Geneva, sans-serif. In the Font-size text field, type 10, and leave the drop down menu to 
the right set to px. In the Color text field, type #006 (a dark blue), and press Apply to see 
your changes to the table. Now you’ll add a thin border around the entire table.
7.	 Select the Border category, and choose Solid from the Top drop-down menu under 
“Style.” In the Width text field, type 1. In the Color text field, type #006, which is the 
same dark blue you used for the font-color (Figure 8-19). Press OK. 
Figure 8-19: Your styled table with background-color, font styling and a border.
The last property you’ll add to the .styledtable class is one that is not available in the 
standard CSS Rule definition dialog box. It’s important to realize that the language of 
CSS is quite large to begin with, and will continue to expand in the future. There are CSS 
properties that may not be used every day but nonetheless can be very useful. You’ll semi-
automatically add one such property now called border-collapse. This property removes 
the space between table cells.
8.	 In the bottom half of the CSS Styles panel in the section labeled Properties for “.styledtable,” 
click on the blue underlined text, Add Property. (You may need to expand this panel in order 
to see it at the bottom of the list.) In the resulting text field, type border-collapse, then press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to commit the change.

earlier in the lesson. 
2.	 In the CSS Styles panel, press the New CSS Rule button ( ) to open the New CSS

(Figure 8-21). This is what you want because you are creating a specific rule for <th> tags, 
but only those found inside the styledtable class.
Figure 8-21: Create a compound rule to style all header rows within the styledtable class.
3.	 The Selector Name text field has been automatically populated as .styledtable tr th. 
Remember that compound rules are read from left to right. So, within the styledtable class, 
you are targeting table rows (tr) and specifically, table headers (th) within table rows.

Controlling cell alignment, padding, and borders with CSS
You’ll now make the content within your table a bit more readable by aligning your text 
and padding your cells, as well as creating borders around each cell. Controlling borders and 
padding is much more flexible in CSS than in HTML; for example, the cellpadding values in 
HTML are uniform—there is no control over left, right, top, and bottom, as there is in CSS. 
The same applies to borders. However, before you begin styling padding with CSS, it’s a good 
idea to remove these values from the HTML so that there are no surprises.
Follow these steps to modify cell alignment, padding, and borders with CSS
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click any corner of the table in order to select it. In the Property Inspector, notice the 
values for CellPad and CellSpace; they are empty, but this stands for default, not zero. You 
must specifically instruct Dreamweaver to use a value of zero.
2.	 For all three properties of CellPad, CellSpace, and Border, type 0 (Figure 8-25). Press 
Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) when you have added the last value.
Figure 8-25: Type 0 for CellPad, CellSpace, and Border to make sure they are removed.
3.	 Click inside any cell of your table, and in the bottom-left corner of your document 
window, click on the <td> tag to select a cell. You could also Ctrl+click (Windows) or 
Command+click (Mac OS) a cell to select it.

rule that applies only to cells within the .styledtable class. Your selector name reads 
.styledtable tr td. Click OK. The CSS Rule definition dialog box appears.
5.	 Select the Block category, then from the Text-align drop-down menu, choose center as 
seen in Figure 8-26. Press Apply to see this center.
FIgure 8-26: Applying a text-align of center to the <td> element centers all text in your cells.
6.	 Select the Box category, and in the Padding section, type 5 in the Top text field. Uncheck

text shift slightly. One of the main differences between HTML cellpadding and CSS 
cellpadding is the ability in CSS to control all four sides of a cell’s padding individually.
7.	 Select the Border category, and in the Style section, choose Dashed from the Top drop-
down menu.
8.	 Type 1 in the Width text field, and in the Color text field, type #9AA8BD, the 
hexadecimal number for a light blue-gray. Press OK to apply the style.

Creating alternate row styling with CSS
A common feature found in many tables is to alternate colors for every other row. When 
done correctly, this increases the contrast between the rows and allows the user to visually 
separate the content of the table. This is easily done in CSS by creating a new class solely for 
background color.
Follow these steps to create alternate row styling with CSS

1.	 Click on the edge of the row labeled 1 to select it. In the CSS Style panel, press the New 
CSS Rule button ( ). The New CSS Rule dialog box opens. 
Unlike the last few exercises, you will not be using a compound selection. Instead, you 
will be creating a new class. The reason for this is that you only want to style every other 
row. There is no automatic way to do this in CSS; after you create the class, it will have to 
be applied manually.

Reusing CSS for other tables
Reusing CSS for other tables
As you have seen, CSS styling for tables is very powerful and capable of spicing up the 
appearance of tables without sacrificing their structure. Like CSS for text and layout, the real 
power is obvious when you apply and link the style to another table.
Follow these steps to reuse CSS with new tables
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click on the file veggie_names.html. This page is currently linked to the same 
external style sheet as the tips.html page, and includes an unstyled table. All that needs to 
be done is to apply the styledtable class you created to this table.
2.	 Click anywhere in the table, and then click the <table> tag in the lower-left corner of 
the document window to select the table. 
3.	 In the Property Inspector, choose styledtable from the Class drop-down menu on the far 
right. The style is applied, and the appearance of this table matches the other. The style 
is flexible enough that, even though the top row has three cells, it has the header style 
applied (Figure 8-30).
Figure 8-30: Applying the styledtable class to a previously unstyled table.
That’s it! The hard work of creating the original style pays off when it comes time to 
creating new tables with identical style. Better yet, if you need to make a global change 
such as changing the background color or font color, changing a property in the external 
sheet will ripple through to all tables.
4.	 To add the alternating rows of color, click on the third row. In the Property Inspector, 
press the HTML button, and from the Class drop-down menu, choose oddrow. Repeat 
this step with every other row to add the style. 
The added benefit of having this class handy is that some tables benefit from this style 
more than others, and so it is your decision whether or not to use it.

no easy way to do this with a static HTML table. Another limitation of tables, especially tables 
created from tabular data where you may not have control over the order, is the difficulty of 
sorting the data. Dreamweaver has a feature that allows you to sort your data alphabetically by 
the column of your choice. 
In the first part of the exercise, you will do some copy-and-pasting in order to switch the first 
two columns.
Follow these steps to sort tabular data
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the edge of the table to select it. Choose Edit > Copy to copy the table.
2.	 Click to the right of the table, press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) twice, and 
choose Edit > Paste. You can copy and paste tables in Dreamweaver within a page, or 
from one page to another.
3.	 In the first table, click at the top of the second column (Common Name) to select the 
entire column. Choose Edit > Copy to copy the contents of the column. Now click at 
the top of the first column (Latin Name) to select it. Choose Edit > Paste to replace the 
content of the first column. You now have duplicate columns momentarily, but the next 
step is to copy content from the second table.
4.	 In the second table, click on the top of the first column (Latin Name) to select it. Choose 
Edit > Copy to copy this column’s contents. Return to the first table and click on the top 
of the second column; then choose Edit > Paste. 
5.	 Click on the second table and delete it now, as you no longer need it. 
Now you’ll sort the first column alphabetically using Dreamweaver’s little-known Sort 
Table feature.
6.	 Select the first table and choose Commands > Sort Table to open the Sort Table dialog 
box. You do not have to make any changes here because the default settings seen in Figure 
8-31 fine, but take a quick look at the options. The Sort By menu allows you to choose 
which menu Dreamweaver will use to sort. The Order menu allows you to choose how 
the table should be sorted, either alphabetically or numerically. Alphabetically is correct 
for now.

Business Case
Since you’ve started developing websites, you got off to a good start by creating page 
layouts and including all the necessary content. Now, you feel the need to become 
more efficient with the application workspace. You’ll find there are several ways of 
customizing the program and enabling you to configure the look and features in a 
way that suits your personal workflow. Let’s change gears with a different project 
and focus a little more on reshaping the program to fit individual tastes while 
exploring other layout techniques...
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw9lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw9lessons folder. Go to 
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
Customizing panels and panel groups
Panels can be moved, grouped, and docked to help keep everything you regularly use at your 
fingertips. In the next part of this lesson, you’ll create a custom workspace layout for CSS 
layouts. You’ll start by removing certain panels and repositioning the remaining panels.

Lesson 9
Follow these steps to customize Dreamweaver panels
Step-by-Step
1.	 Make sure your dw09lessons folder has been defined as a site as described in the Starting 
Up section. This first exercise does not require any of the lesson files, as you will be 
focusing on the workspace.
To ensure you are starting from the same workspace as we are, choose 
Window > Workspace Layout > Designer. Then choose ‘Reset Designer,’ You will now 
customize your panels.
2.	 Locate the Business Catalyst tab, click the panel menu in the top right, and then choose 
Close Tab Group.
3.	 Right-click or Control+click (Mac) the Adobe Browserlab tab and choose Close 
Tab Group.
4.	 Click once on the Files tab to expand this panel (seen in Figure 9-1). (To show a closed 
panel, click once. To hide it, double-click it.)
Figure 9-1: Click the Files tab to show the  
Files panel.
There are two panels within the CSS panel group: CSS Styles and AP Elements. The AP 
Elements panel is currently hidden. In order to see both panels simultaneously, you’ll drag 
the AP Elements panel out of the tab group.

Lesson 9
269
Lesson 9: Fine-Tuning Your Workflow
Customizing panels and panel groups
5.	 Click and hold the AP Elements tab. Drag this tab into your workspace to remove it from 
the CSS panel group. This now becomes a floating window (seen in Figure 9-2) , which 
you can keep floating if you want. Many users prefer to have all their panels within a 
single column, so you’ll add it back in now.
Figure 9-2: Dragging the AP Elements panel out of the CSS panel group  
turns it into a floating window.
6.	 To keep the AP Elements panel from interfering with your workspace, you can dock it 
with the other panels. Place your cursor over the AP Elements tab at the top of the panel, 
and click and hold. 
7.	 Drag the AP Elements panel immediately above the title bar of the Files panel group. Be 
careful here: if the entire Files panel is highlighted blue, you will be adding to the group. 
You are looking for a thin blue line above the Files tab; this indicates that you are creating 
a new group. When a solid line appears above the Files panel group, release the AP 
Elements panel to snap it into place.

Lesson 9
8.	 If necessary, adjust the width and height of the panels by placing your cursor on the edges 
of any panel group. When the black double-arrow appears, you can click and drag to 
adjust as needed. When you’re finished, the panels should look similar to Figure 9-3. This 
configuration gives you quick access to the panels you’ll use the most when creating the 
CSS-based layout in this exercise.
Figure 9-3: The customized panels.
9.	 Dreamweaver CS6 also has the same Icon view as the other applications in the Creative 
Suite. Click the double-arrows on the top-right corner of the entire column of panels; 
they will collapse to the icon view.
10.	 Click the Files icon; that group will expand so you can work with it. This group will 
temporarily stay open until you start working on the document or click another icon.
You can decide whether you prefer to work in the expanded panel view or the icon view. 
For now, you’ll return to the panel view.
11.	 Click the double-arrows to return to the expanded panel view.
12.	 To save this workspace, choose Window > Workspace Layout > New Workspace. When 
the New Workspace Layout dialog box appears, type CSS Layout into the Name text 
field and press OK.
13.	 Choose Window > Workspace Layout > Designer to switch to the default workspace; 
then choose Window > Workspace Layout > CSS Layout to switch back to the custom 
workspace you just created.

Using the Favorites tab on the Insert bar
Using the Favorites tab on the Insert bar
To help organize the many options available in the Insert panel, Dreamweaver groups similar 
items into categories. You may have already found yourself using some items more often than 
others. The Favorites category is a great way to group commonly used items into one place 
for quick access. 
Follow these steps to edit the Favorites tab
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click the index.html file in the Files panel. In this exercise, you’ll be inserting 
a number of images and AP Divs to create two pages in the Sounds of Nature website. 
These options are currently hidden within the insert panel, so you’ll need to expand it.
2.	 Expand the Insert panel by clicking the Insert tab at the top of the panel. If necessary, 
adjust the heights of your available panels by dragging the borders between them.
3.	 If the menu at the top of the Insert panel is not currently set to Common, click on it  and 
choose the Common option. Note that Images are one of the options here. Now click on the 
menu again and choose the Layout option and note the Draw AP Div object is listed here. 
The Insert panel has a number of different objects such as hyperlinks, form tags, Spry 
elements, media and other objects that you can click on to insert. However if you find 
yourself inserting the same objects over and over, you might want to group them. You can 
do this with the Favorite category of the Insert panel.
4.	 Click the Favorites category in the Insert panel’s drop-down menu. Right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) in the empty gray area beneath the Favorite category, 
and choose Customize Favorites from the resulting contextual menu. The Customize 
Favorite Objects dialog box appears (Figure 9-4).

Resizing the document window
If you’re familiar with any page layout or graphics programs, adjusting the size of the window 
in which you’re working is probably something that you do regularly. However, when you’re 
working on web pages in Dreamweaver, it’s a good idea to think carefully about the size of 
your document. Because a number of different hardware and software configurations may 
be used to view your content, it can be tricky to make sure your website looks well on every 
user’s computer. In the next part of this lesson, you’ll resize the document window to make 
sure the Sounds of Nature website is being designed with the target audience in mind.

Lesson 9: Fine-Tuning Your Workflow
Resizing the document window
Follow these steps to resieze the Dreamweaver window
Step-by-Step
1.	 Index.html should still be open in your document window. If not, open it now. Also, 
make sure you’re in the Design view. If necessary, press the Design View button in the 
Document toolbar.
2.	 Look at the very bottom of your document window; there are several controls relating to 
the Window Size on your screen (Figure 9-6).
A
B
C
D
Figure 9-6: A. Mobile Size (480 × 800).  B. Tablet Size (768 × 1024).  C. Desktop Size (1000 × 620).   
D. Window Size.
Pay particular attention to the numbers 779 × 489 in our figure; this is the Window Size. 
It is quite likely your numbers will be different. This number represents the full width 
Dreamweaver is capable of displaying given the user’s screen size. Because we are using 
a monitor set to 1024 × 768, this is as wide as Dreamweaver can display the page on our 
screen.
3.	 Click the Window Size numbers to access a menu. The default setting is actually set to the 
“Full Size” option. Dreamweaver calculates these numbers instantly.
You will also that see there are other monitor size options in this menu. From the menu, 
choose the option that reads 1260 × 875. What happens on your screen depends on the size of 
your monitor. On our 1024 × 768 monitor, a scroll bar appears that allows us to scroll over to 
the right of the document. Generally speaking, you can leave this setting to Full Size unless 
you have a specific need to preview your page in different size screens.
Take Note...
The second value seen in this step, 1280 × 1024 Maximized, refers to the “true” size of the 
page as if the user were maximizing their browser window to the fullest. The 1260 × 875 
number is a more realistic estimate of the available space a web browser would occupy on the 
screen (accounting for browser features, such as scroll bars).
There are three monitor icons that will allow you to change the window size to three 
different presets.

Changing the Zoom level
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
274
Lesson 9
4.	 Click the first icon immediately to the right of the menu labeled 100% (Figure 9-7). This 
is the Mobile Size (480 × 800) preset.
Figure 9-7: The Mobile Size preset changes the dimensions of the screen to 480 pixels wide by 800 high.
This will set the window size to 480 pixels wide by 800 high and have the effect of 
cropping your current page. The goal here is to show you the window size as if you were 
viewing the site with a mobile device. Although this can be a useful feature, it’s a bit 
deceptive. Dreamweaver is not trying to reproduce the behavior of a web browser on a 
smartphone, it’s simply limiting the width and height of your current window.
A more sophisticated method of designing your pages for mobile devices is covered in 
Lesson 15, “Mobile Design and Layout,” using the Multiscreen feature.
5.	 Click the next icon to the right, which is the Tablet Size. Note the change in the screen. 
Click the last icon, which is the Desktop view and is set to 1000 pixels by 620. All these 
settings can be useful if you want to see how your designs appear in these different size 
screens. Just remember that there is no substitute for seeing your design in a web browser.
6.	 Click the Window Size menu, and then click the “Full Size” option to set the screen back 
to the maximum amount of space on your monitor.
Changing the Zoom level
Changing the zoom level or magnification of a web page is very different than changing the 
window size as you did in the last exercise. You need to understand the difference between 
the two: changing the zoom level in Dreamweaver is very similar to zooming in an image 
program, such as Photoshop or Illustrator. In those applications, there are good reasons for 
changing the zoom level, since they are used for photography and illustration. On the Web, 
there’s not as much of a need to examine objects at a magnified level.
Changing the magnification level in Dreamweaver can be helpful for exact positioning or 
viewing multiple documents at once, but we recommend that you return to 100 percent 
when you’re finished. Now, you’ll use the Zoom and Hand tools to navigate throughout your 
document.

Lesson 9
275
Lesson 9: Fine-Tuning Your Workflow
Using guides
Follow these steps to change the zoom level
Step-by-Step
1.	 At the bottom of the document index.html page, select the Zoom tool (
). Click twice 
inside the document window to zoom to 200 percent.
2.	 With the Zoom tool still selected, press and hold the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) 
key and click once inside the document window. The About page zooms out to 
150 percent. These zoom shortcuts are standard across Adobe’s applications.
3.	 At the bottom of the document window, select the Hand tool (
) to the left of the Zoom 
tool. Click and drag the document in any direction within the document window. The 
Hand tool allows you to drag a document around in its window like a piece of paper. 
(Figure 9-8)
Figure 9-8: Use the Hand tool to drag a document around in its window.
4.	 Double-click the Zoom tool at the bottom of the document window to return to 100 
percent. Now, choose 66% from the Set magnification drop-down menu to the right of 
the Zoom tool. Depending on the size of your monitor, this magnification level may allow 
you to see the entire About page. If not, use the Zoom tool or the Set magnification drop-
down menu to find the appropriate size.
Occasionally, this option will be useful if you have a lot of content on the page and you 
want to see the basic structure of the layout. Don’t forget to set the view back to 100% 
when you are done.
5.	 Click the Selection tool ( ) in the bottom of the document window and choose 100% 
from the Set magnification drop-down menu. 
Using guides
In Lesson 5, “Creating Page Layouts with CSS,” you learned how AP Divs can be added 
to a page for precise layout. Guides are horizontal or vertical lines that you can add to 
Dreamweaver’s Design view and can be a useful tool for AP Divs, as well as the other types of 
layout techniques. Guides allow you to line up and measure different elements on your page. In 
this exercise, you’ll add an AP Div to index.html, and then place an image inside the div. First, 
you’ll draw some guides to help you size and position the div.

Using guides
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
276
Lesson 9
Follow these steps to create guides
Step-by-Step
1.	 If your rulers are hidden, choose View > Rulers > Show to turn them on.
Take Note...
Rulers can use inches, centimeters, or pixels in Dreamweaver. Because pixels are the most 
common unit of measurement on the Web, they are the default. If you prefer inches or 
centimeters, right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the rulers to access a context 
menu where you can choose your preferred unit. In this lesson, you’ll be using pixels, so it’s a 
good idea to stick with them for now.
2.	 Click inside the vertical ruler on the left side of your document window, and then drag 
a guide into the center of the page. Notice, as you drag, that a yellow box appears with 
the pixel number of your horizontal ruler. When you let go and move your cursor off the 
ruler, it will disappear.
Dragging a guide manually is useful, but you can also set a guide’s position precisely.
3.	 Double-click on this guide to open the Move Guide dialog box. From this dialog box, you 
can set an exact location for guides. This feature can be especially helpful when building a 
web page based on sketches or mockups. 
4.	 Type 38 in the Location text field and press OK. The guide is repositioned 38 pixels from 
the left side of the document.
5.	 Create another vertical guide and set its position to 494 pixels, either by dragging it to this 
position or setting its value precisely. 
What if you wanted to determine the exact width between these two guides you just 
added? Instead of using a calculator, you can allow Dreamweaver to do it for you.
6.	 Press and hold the Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key and move your cursor 
across the three sections of your page as defined by the guides (seen in Figure 9-9). A blue 
line with arrows on either end indicates the distance between each of your guides, as well 
as the distance between guides and the edge of the document window. Between the two 
guides, you can now see that the width is exactly 456 pixels.
Figure 9-9: Hold down Ctrl (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) and hover  
over the vertical areas defined by guides.

7.	 Drag two horizontal guides down from the ruler at the top of the document window. 
Double-click on each of them, and then use the Move Guide dialog box to position one

the document.
8.	 Next, you’ll draw an AP Div and start adding some content; but first make sure that Snap 
to Guides is turned on, by choosing View > Guides > Edit Guides. The Guides dialog box 
appears, with a number of options for customizing your guides. 
If you happen to be using a color in your web page that makes the guides hard to see, you 
can change their color here. Also, the Lock Guides option can be a helpful way to avoid 
accidentally repositioning guides. For now, make sure Snap to Guides is checked as seen in 
Figure 9-10 and press OK.
Figure 9-10: The Guides dialog box allows you to change  
the color of guides and turn snapping on and off.
9.	 Now that your guides are set up, you’re ready to add some content. With the Favorites 
category selected in the Insert panel, click the Draw AP Div object. Draw an AP Div 
inside the box created by your four guides. 
10.	 The edges should snap to the guides easily. If they don’t, select the div by clicking an edge 
and dragging it until it snaps to a guide.
11.	 Click inside the div to place your cursor, and then select the Image object in the Favorites 
category of the Insert panel.
12.	 In the Select Image Source dialog box, select hp_photo.jpg from the Images folder inside 
the dw09lessons folder, and press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).

13.	 In the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, type Soothing Lakefront into the 
Alternate text field and press OK. The hp_photo.jpg image fits nicely inside the div you 
created earlier (Figure 9-11).
Figure 9-11: The hp_photo.jpg placed inside of the AP Div.
14.	 Choose File > Save and leave index.html open.
Using grids
Much like guides, grids are a visual aid used in Dreamweaver’s Design View that consist of 
an overlay of vertical and horizontal lines on your page. In the next part of this lesson, you’ll 
be adding AP Divs and images to the About page of the Sounds of Nature website. Creating a 
custom grid will help you align and evenly distribute these new elements on the page.
Follow these steps to create a custom grid
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click on the about.html file in your Files panel to open the About page. You may 
notice that this page has a white background and uses a default typeface. Later on, you’ll 
use the tag selector to change this.
2.	 Choose View > Grid > Grid Settings to open the Grid Settings dialog box. Much like 
the Guides dialog box, the Grid Settings dialog box can be used to specify the grid color 
and turn on snapping. Type #CCCCCC in the Color text field and check Show Grid and 
Snap to Grid to turn the grid on and enable snapping.

3.	 For this layout, type 38 in the Spacing text field and make sure pixels are selected as the 
unit of measurement (Figure 9-12). Choosing a spacing of 38 pixels creates a series of 
squares that are 38 pixels high by 38 pixels wide. Press OK.
Figure 9-12: The Grid Settings dialog box.
4.	 With the grid established, add the AP Divs that will house your images. Click the Draw 
AP Div object in the Favorites category of the Insert panel. Draw a square div that is 3 
grid units wide and 3 grid units high. Use figure 9-13 for reference.
Figure 9-13: Draw a square AP Div.
5.	 Press the Draw AP Div element in the Favorites category of the Insert panel again, and 
draw a second AP Div one grid unit below the first. Use Figure 9-14 for reference.
Figure 9-14: Draw a second AP Div one grid unit below the first.
6.	 Click inside the first div to place the cursor, and then press the Image element in the 
Favorites category of the Insert panel.

7.	 In the Select Image Source dialog box, select tree.jpg from the images folder inside the 
dw09lessons folder, and press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
8.	 In the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, type tree into the Alternate text 
field and press OK. The tree image is positioned inside the AP Div on your page.
9.	 Repeat steps 7 and 8 to add forest.jpg to the second div. Type forest into the Alternate 
text field of the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box. You page should look like 
Figure 9-15. 
Figure 9-15: The about.html page after inserting the tree and forest images.
10.	 Choose File > Save and leave about.html open for the next part of this lesson.
The tag selector
In HTML, the organization of elements takes the form of a family tree. In the previous two 
exercises, you created AP Divs and then inserted images into them. In HTML terms, all these 
images are children of the AP Divs within which they reside. The tag selector is a feature 
of Dreamweaver that allows you to select HTML elements based on their relationship to one 
another. The tag selector has been used in previous sections of this book, but in this exercise 
you’ll use it to apply a single style that will affect the entire about.html page.

Lesson 9

Lesson 9: Fine-Tuning Your Workflow
The tag selector
Follow these steps to use the tag selector
Step-by-Step
1.	 With the About page open, click once on the forest image that you inserted at the end 
of the last exercise. At the bottom-left corner of the document window are a number of 
HTML tags. This is the tag selector. The <img> tag at the end of this line is highlighted to 
indicate that the forest.jpg image is selected. In addition, the Property Inspector displays 
information and options related to this image (Figure 9-16).
Figure 9-16: With the forest image selected, the <img> tag in the tag selector is highlighted and the  
Property Inspector displays information and options related to this image.
2.	 In the tag selector, click on the <div#apDiv2> tag to the left of the <img> tag. Notice 
that the options in the Property Inspector change to reflect the selected div. In this case, 
you’ve selected the parent of the forest image.
3.	 To further illustrate this relationship, choose Edit > Select Child from the main menu. 
The <img> tag becomes highlighted in the tag selector, and the Property Inspector 
changes to reflect the selected element.
4.	 Now, select <body> on the far-left side of the tag selector. The Property Inspector 
displays options and information related to the <body> tag. Press the CSS button in the 
Property Inspector if necessary and then, from the Targeted Rule drop-down menu, 
choose body_style (Figure 9-17).
Figure 9-17: With the <body> tag selected in the tag selector, choose body_style from the Targeted Rule  
drop-down menu.

Skill Summary
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 9
Because many CSS properties are inherited throughout the document, it is possible to 
write generalized rules that will be applied to all the elements on a page. In this case, 
body_style changes the font and text color for the entire document because every element 
is a descendant of the body.
5.	 Choose File > Save and leave about.html open for the next part of this lesson.
Tiling documents
By default, Dreamweaver organizes open documents with a series of tabs in the upper-left 
corner of the document window. If you’d like to compare documents, or you simply prefer to 
use separate windows for each document, the tiling option provides an alternative for viewing 
open files. Document tiling allows you to place one or more pages side by side on your 
screen. Next, you’ll use this feature to simultaneously view the index page and the about page 
of the Sounds of Nature website.
Follow these steps to view multiple documents using tiling
Step-by-Step
1.	 Both index.html and about.html should still be open. If they are not, open them now.
2.	 Choose Window > Tile Vertically (Windows) or Window > Tile (Mac OS). This will 
send the two pages into two windows side-by-side. This feature can be useful for dragging 
and dropping objects from one page to another or to work on both pages if you have a big 
enough monitor.
The fastest way to group these two pages back together is different depending which 
platform you are on PC or Mac.
3.	 On the Mac, click the index.html tab, drag it to the about.html tab, and then release 
it. They will now be grouped as tabs again. On the PC, the best way to group the two 
document windows again is to click on the maximize button in the top right corner of 
one of the documents.
You have finished Lesson 9, “Fine-Tuning Your Workflow.”

Changing the Physical Properties of a Div
Project 9-1
Something people forget about DIVs is that they can serve as a design element in addition to 
being a container. You’ll add a DIV to a webpage to explore this concept more by using the 
CSS Styles panel. 
1.	 Choose File > New > Blank Page > HTML > None to create a new empty webpage.
2.	 Using the Insert panel, choose the Layout category. Select the Draw AP Div tool. 
3.	 Click and drag a AP Div on your webpage, don’t worry about where you place it or how 
big it is. 
4.	 Make sure the new AP Div is selected by clicking it on the webpage. 
5.	 Choose Window > CSS Styles.
6.	 Click on the arrow to the left of <style> and then double-click the #apDiv1 element.
7.	 Use the Rule Definition panel to try out the various appearance options such as 
Background and Border. To keep the window open while experimenting, use the Apply 
button to view your changes. When you are satisfied with the results, click OK.
8.	 Save your file, name it Lesson9_Project.html and keep it open for the next exercise 
below.
Naming AP Divs

the Status Bar to adjust the preset monitor settings. 
Circling Back 2
As you saw earlier in the chapter, guides and grids are beneficial features that aid in the process 
of creating your layout. There will be occasions when you have a client who doesn’t know 
the type of layout they want, and asks you to improvise. In such cases, you will need to design 
your own layout. Many new web designers will make the mistake of trying to design and 
create the layout at the same time. This isn’t the best approach to take, especially when you’re 
new to the program and the process. You can end up frustrated when trying to understand the 
features of Dreamweaver and trying to figure out design at the same time.
Creating a Mockup
Project 1
For the next exercise, you won’t need a computer, just pencil and paper.
With pencil and paper in hand, open a web browser. Start visiting various websites that you 
find inspiring. If you need more direction, try www.bestwebgallery.com for some ideas. Make 
notes about the designs you like and why. Translate the visual design of the sites you find into 
a sketch. Use squares to abstractly mark up the numbers of columns, headers, footers, and 
navigation, and horizontal lines to represent text.
Once you have a sense of how other layouts are built, try one on your own. You don’t need 
to be a great artist, just draw squares to represent images and straight lines to represent text 
content. This is how most websites by professionals start, with a simple drawing to represent 
where elements such as graphics, text, and media will be placed. 
1.	 Draw at least 4 or 5 layouts to give yourself some options to choose from and explore 
design a bit. 
2.	 Pick the one you like best for the next project.

Now that you have an idea of what your layout is in sketch form, you can focus on putting it 
together in Dreamweaver. 
1.	 Open Dreamweaver and establish a new site and root folder called Layout. 
2.	 Create a new HTML page in Dreamweaver and save it as layout1.html.
3.	 Using your drawings as a reference, recreate the basic layout structure using the guides as 
you did earlier in this lesson. 
4.	 If you don’t see the rulers, choose View > Rulers > Show. Double-check that the units are 
in pixels. 
5.	 Start dragging out ruler guides to represent the layout you chose. 
6.	 Once the guides are in place, add images and text using AP Divs. 
Don’t Forget to Customize!
Project 3
Remember that you can reconfigure your workspace to suit your needs. If you’re unhappy 
with how the program is presented, change it and create your own workspaces.
1.	 Open Dreamweaver. Find panels that you like to use regularly and open them (e.g., 
Window > CSS Styles if you are using CSS heavily). 
2.	 Drag and drop the panels you have open into a configuration you like. 
3.	 Choose Window > Workspace Layout > New Workspace. In the dialog box that appears, 
type a name for the workspace (you can use your name) and click OK.
4.	 Find another task (or set of tasks) you do on a regular basis; open the panels that would go 
with the task or tasks (e.g., Snippets and Behaviors if you’re doing code work) and set up a 
new workspace for that particular task. 
5.	 Repeat as necessary to create your own custom workspaces.

Lesson 10: Adding Flash, Video, and Sound Content 
Skill
Objective 
Use the Assets panel
3.4
Include video and sound in a web page
4.7
Add animation and interactivity to content
4.8
Business Case
The owners of Organic Utopia would like to add more exciting content to their site 
in the form of sound and video. Video is a must-have now to add more engaging 
visual elements and set your site apart from others. Once you understand some of 
the format considerations and how to use them, video becomes an indispensable tool 
that will take your site to a whole new level. 
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw10lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create a site definition that points to the dw10lessons folder. Go 
to Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site definition, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a 
New Site.”
Making web content interesting
Adding video, sound, and animation to a web page is one way to make your pages more 
interesting and engaging. Video, for example, plays a key role in supplying interesting and 
varied web content. The barrier to creating original video has decreased dramatically in 
recent years as has the barrier to distributing these videos online. Videos allow individuals and

companies to post commercials, speeches, and other content that otherwise would be difficult 
or cost-prohibitive to reach a large audience.
Sound allows you to enhance web pages by supplementing visual content with music or sound 
effects. Sound also inspires user interaction (as you’ll see later in this lesson), thereby giving the 
user a more interesting online experience. 
Animation gives web pages a whole new life by adding movement and effects to images that 
still pictures just can’t match. Something moving on a web page automatically draws a visitor’s 
eye. Movement is especially effective for banner ads, buttons, and whatever else you’d like your 
visitors to pay attention to.
Best Practices for Animation
Although animation can be a great addition to your pages, there are a few things to keep in mind:
• Animations should not be distracting. Users might enjoy your animation the first time, 
but if they are trying to read an article on your website, that animation might not be so 
enjoyable after the 40th time. Most animated content can be set to play one or two times, 
avoid animations that endlessly loop if at all possible. 
• Animations should add value. Creating animations is a fun process for the designer, but 
it is easy to get carried away. Gratuitious animation can actually remove value from your site. 
Before adding any element with animation, take a step back and consider if it is truly useful 
for the user.
• Keep it short. Unless the animation is the only content on the page, try to keep your 
animations as short as possible. Your users may not have the patience for a long animation and 
longer animations will also be larger file size which translates to a longer download time.
• Manage file size and be aware of technical limitations. Animations will necessarily add 
file size to your page and this may affect those users with slower bandwidth (such as mobile 
users). In fact, your mobile users may not be able to view your animation at all depending on 
the technologies involved. For example, currently there is no support of the Flash plugin on 
Apple’s iOS platform so your animations will not play on devices such as the iPhone and iPad.
Inserting Flash movies
Adobe’s Flash CS6 Professional application is used primarily to create animation and 
interactive projects. In terms of animation, you can use Flash to create animated web banners, 
buttons, splash pages, slide shows, and more. Inserting Flash animations into your web page is 
a great way to bring life to an otherwise static environment.
Web banners are a significant component of online advertising, and if a web banner includes 
moving elements, that movement automatically draws the user to the banner. In this exercise, 
you will add a flash banner to place on a website.

Lesson 10
Site assets versus Favorite assets
The Assets panel contains a complete list of all recognized assets within a site (such as 
the 3 swf files in your current site), although initially very useful, imagine a site that had 
hundreds of SWF files (or any other category of Assets such as images or colors). Locating 
a particular file could take a while.
For this reason, Dreamweaver has a Favorites list to which you can add frequently used 
assets and group related assets together. You can also give them nicknames to remind 
yourself what they’re for, and find them easily in the Assets panel.
Working with Favorites list
• Select one or more assets in the Site list of the Assets panel, then click the Add To Favorites 
button.
• To view Favorites click on the Favorites radio button at the top of the Assets panel.
• To place Favorite assets into a group click the New Favorites folder in the Assets panel, label the 
folder and then drag one or more Favorites into the folder.
• To remove a Favorite click the Remove from Favorites button
Take Note...
Favorite assets are not stored as separate files on your disk; they’re references to the assets 
in the Site list. Dreamweaver keeps track of which assets from the Site list to display in the 
Favorites list.
5.	 Click on the ou_sidebar_ad.swf file in the Assets panel and drag it to the sidebar_ad div 
to insert it.
6.	 Type Organic Utopia sidebar ad in the Title text field when the Object Tag 
Accessibility Attributes dialog box appears, then press OK.
As you can see, inserting a Flash movie into a web page is much like inserting an image. 
The width and height of the .swf are automatically established based on the file’s physical 
size, just as they are for images such as .jpeg and .gif files. 
The .swf file appears with a generic Flash icon on a gray image.
Take Note...
You must have Flash Player, which is available free from Adobe, installed to view an .swf 
file. If you don’t have the application installed, visit adobe.com/products/flashplayer 
to download and install it. Note that visitors to your website also must have Flash Player 
installed to view your Flash content. A good rule of thumb when including Flash content on 
a website is to let visitors know as soon as they get to your site that they’ll need to have Flash 
Player. Be sure to include the link to the Flash Player web page (the URL provided at the 
beginning of this paragraph) so that visitors can download the Flash Player, if necessary.

Adding video
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 10
Adding video
Adding video to a web page is relatively easy, assuming the video has already been optimized 
for the Web. A full discussion about the various file formats and how to convert digital video 
to a web optimized format is beyond the scope of this book. However, the decision to include 
web video should be based on an evaluation of your audience. The large file sizes associated 
with video can affect the experience of users who don’t have high-speed Internet connections. 
In this section, you will learn how to integrate video into your web pages using three of the 
most popular formats: Flash Video, QuickTime, and Windows Media.
Flash Video
Flash video has been widely used for web video for a number of years, and is still the format 
of choice for a large number of sites. This is changing somewhat due to the rise of mobile 
devices (and specifically the lack of support for Flash video on these devices). Nevertheless, one 
of the primary advantages of Flash Video is that playback is enabled for any browser with the 
Flash plug-in. Since more than 95% of all desktop web browsers have some version of the plug-
in installed, this means your video will find the widest possible audience. Again, this is not 
always true on mobile. Additionally, Flash video can be compressed to a reasonable size while 
maintaining image quality.
Different programs create Flash video, including the Adobe Media Encoder, Premiere Pro, and 
even Photoshop. Creating the video is a separate process, so you’ll want to do your homework 
and learn as much as you can about how it works in order to get the best results. There are 
essentially two file formats that are used in Flash video: .flv and .f4v. The .flv format is the 
traditional flash video format and .f4v is a newer format. In this exercise, you’ll add a pre-
existing .flv video file into your page and add simple player controls to allow users to control 
the playback of the movie.

and select the ou_veggies.flv file and then press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
Figure 10-4: The Insert Flash Video dialog box.
Take Note...
In this example, Progressive Download Video was chosen instead of Streaming Video because 
the former is the more common method among web developers. Progressive Download 
Video works by downloading the video to the user’s hard-drive; however, the video will start 
to play as soon as it is able. In other words, the user doesn’t have to wait for the entire video 
to download in order to see it. Streaming Video streams video content and plays it on a 
web page after a short buffer period. The buffer period ensures smooth playback. The catch is 
that to enable Streaming Video, your videos must be accessible through a web streaming service 
such as Adobe Flash Media Server. If you want to learn more about the process, click the 
Help button on the Insert Flash Video dialog box.
Next, you’ll want to select a skin. A skin is a control panel that shows up on the bottom 
of the video, and allows the user to control video playback. In other words, this is where 
users can play, rewind, and fast-forward their videos.

3.	 Click on the Skin drop-down menu to examine your choices. You see a preview of the 
skin just below the menu. In Figure 10-5, we used Corona Skin 3.
Figure 10-5: A number of skins are available in the Skin drop-down menu.
Take Note...
If your video is ten seconds or longer, choose a skin that includes a slider control so that users 
can scroll through the video at their convenience.
4.	 Click on the Detect Size button so that Dreamweaver can establish the physical space the 
video will occupy on the page. The size is based on the size of the actual video.
You can manually type in a size, too, although be sure you are aware of the dangers here. 
Entering a size that’s bigger than the original video will either blur or pixelate your video. 
Additionally, the width and height of a video is called the aspect ratio, and if you enter a 
width and height that do not match the original aspect ratio, then your viewers will see 
distorted video. In general, there’s no reason not to let Dreamweaver detect the video size.

Lesson 10
HTML5 Video
HTML5 video is a relatively new alternative to Flash video (and other plug-in based video 
such as Quicktime or Windows Media Video). It has become particularly popular for iOS 
devices such as the iPhone and iPod which do not support Flash (and by extension Flash 
Video). HTML5 video supports certain types of video in their native formats such as .MP4, 
.OGV and .WEBM and does not require a browser plug-in. A browser plug-in is a module 
of code that is not installed in a web browser by default, the most notable plug-in is perhaps 
Adobe’s Flash Player. To add video to a page you can add the <video> tag and any browser 
that supports this tag (as well as the codec for the type of video being used) will play the video.
There are additional benefits to using HTML5 video: There are a set of native video 
controls (such as play, pause and volume) that can be added with a simple line of code and 
are keyboard accessible. Because of the architecture and specification of the <video> tag 
additional features such as text transcripts and/or captions can be added and in general 
HTML5 video is more searchable and discoverable by search engines because the code is 
exposed as an element with attributes (just like the paragraphs and headings on a page).
Adding HTML5 video to a web page
Unlike Flash Video, Dreamweaver CS6 does not have a specific command or object in 
the Insert menu allowing you to easily add HTML5 video. You must type the <video> 
element and any attributes in the Code view.
1.	
Choose File > New and in the New Document window make sure the page type is set to 
HTML and then click on the DocType menu and choose HTML5 and then click Create.
A new untitled document is created.
2.	
Choose File > Save and save this file into the same folder as the video you would like to add 
(For this exercise we refer to an .mp4 video file and a .webm video file).
3.	
Click on the Code button to enter the code view and then locate the opening <body> tag 
and press return/enter to add space between the two <body> tags.
4.	
Add the following code:
<video autoplay controls tabindex="0"> 
<source src="my _ video.mp4" type='video/mp4; codec="mp4a.40.2"'> <source 
src="my _ video.webm" type='video/webm; codec="vp8"'> </video> 
In this example you will need to replace the values my_video.mp4 and my_video.webm 
with the names of your own video files (as well as supply the video files themselves). 
In this example, there are two video files being declared as the source. It is considered 
best practice to provide multiple video files when using HTML5 video because there 
is no single video format that is supported by all browsers. In this example .mp4 is 
supported by the most recent versions of Apple Safari and Internet Explorer and .webm is 
supported by the most recent versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.
The attributes in the opening <video> tag are autoplay, controls and 
tabindex="0". These are optional but very useful. The autoplay attribute begins 
the video automatically, the controls attribute adds basic player controls and the 
tabindex attribute ensures that the player is keyboard accessible.

Lesson 10: Adding Flash, Video, and Sound Content 
QuickTime video and Windows Media
QuickTime video and Windows Media
QuickTime and Windows Media are also common video formats used on the Web. In 
many ways they are similar; both offer compressed video with various levels of image and 
sound quality. When adding either file format to a page, the key thing to keep in mind is that 
viewers must have the necessary plug-in to view the video. Unlike Flash video, this is not 
necessarily a sure thing. QuickTime is traditionally Mac OS-based and Windows Media Video 
is traditionally Windows-based.
You can download QuickTime from Apple.com/quicktime/download. To view Windows Media  
files, you need Windows Media Player, which you can download at Microsoft.com/windows/ 
windowsmedia/download. (At the time of this writing, there was no plug-in support from either 
Apple or Microsoft that allowed Windows Media Video to play on a Mac.)
QuickTime and Windows Media video are inserted into a page the same way as Flash Video. 
The difference between the video formats is that users create QuickTime and Windows Media 
video using different software applications, for example Adobe Premiere Pro and Apple Final 
Cut Pro. 
The process for inserting either QuickTime or Windows Media Video is the same. In this 
example you may choose either format depending on your platform.
Follow these steps to insert a QuickTime or Windows Media Video
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, open the insertvideo.html file. Click below the heading, A look at our 
vegetables, if necessary.
2.	 Go to the Assets panel and select the Movies button to show the videos available in your 
site.
3.	 Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) on the veggies.mov file (or the 
veggies.wmv if in Windows), and choose Insert from the contextual menu to insert 
it into the page. You’ll see a plug-in icon (   ) on the page, indicating that a plug-in is 
required to see the file.(Figure 10-7)
Figure 10-7: Inserting QuickTime or Windows Media Video files creates a generic plug-in icon.

QuickTime video and Windows Media
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 10
4.	 When you insert a plug-in file, you need to manually enter the size of the file; 
Dreamweaver will not automatically detect it for you. You will also need to add 20 pixels 
to the height to make room for built-in player controls. The source video here is 320 by 
240 so in the Property Inspector, type 320 in the W (width) window and 260 in the H 
(height) window. 
Again, you are using 260 for the height to allow space for the controller. QuickTime and 
Windows Media files already have a controller built in with the plug-in. You need to allow 
a little extra space for the video controls when you’re entering a size manually.
5.	 To preview the file within Dreamweaver, choose File > Preview in Browser. 
If you see a message that Dreamweaver was unable to find the plug-in that handles this 
media type, it does not necessarily mean your system cannot play the video (although 
this is still possible). It only means that Dreamweaver can’t find the correct plug-in. If this 
should happen, try to preview the video in your browser; you may find it works there.
Take Note...
The problem of playing video on your system may also have to do with the lack of a codec. 
Web video can get a little tricky because there are file formats (such as .mov or .wmv) and there 
are codecs. The codec does the job of actually compressing the frames of your video and there 
may be any number of codecs used for a particular file format. Both QuickTime and Windows 
Media Player are generally good at identifying which codec you or your users may be missing 
and then providing links to download and install the necessary codec.
Save your file if prompted and your video will now appear on your web page as seen in 
Figure 10-8.

Lesson 10: Adding Flash, Video, and Sound Content 
Inserting sound 
Other web video considerations
In addition to size, consider the following when you’re preparing video for the Web:
Length: Unless you’ll be offering video through a streaming video service, keep the 
video length down to keep the file size manageable and the progressive playback smooth.
Audio: Although stereo is nice, using stereo files on the Web is a little iffy, as many 
home users don’t have stereo speakers hooked up to their computers. Stereo creates a 
larger file size and doesn’t add that much to the quality of the sound unless you’re doing 
some tricks with the balance between the speakers, which people without speakers won’t 
hear anyway. Keep your video sound set to mono to help manage the file size a bit more 
effectively.
Movement, animated graphics, and effects: These things make a video look nice, 
but increasing the file size can interrupt playback. 
Copywritten material: Be careful when choosing material for your video, especially 
when it comes to music. Pirating is a big issue today. Unless you have the rights to the 
music or you have permission from the music publisher and are paying royalties, you 
can’t use music for promotional or commercial purposes when it comes to publishing 
material on the Web.
Inserting sound 
Sound is another element you can use to enhance your website. Sound has the same 
considerations as video: it can take a while to download and it requires a plug-in, such as 
QuickTime or Windows Media Player, to hear it.
You can incorporate different types of sound files into a web page. Select a format that will run 
on any computer, whether the user is on the Windows or Mac OS platform. Three formats are 
common: .aif, .wav, and .mp3.
Files in the .aif or .wav format are similar; the main difference is where they originate. 
Windows is generally linked to the .wav format, and Mac OS is associated with the .aif format. 
The Windows and Mac OS platforms can read both formats. In addition, these files sound 
similar to one another: both are dynamic and depending on the settings can result in high-
quality files.
You can also play .mp3 format files on both the Windows and Mac OS platforms. The big 
advantage to using an .mp3 file is that it’s typically smaller in size than an .aif or .wav file. 
Depending on the compression settings, the .mp3 format may not reproduce full CD-quality 
sound, but it downloads faster and takes up less hard drive space. In this exercise, you’ll add an 
mp3 file to your page.

Lesson 10
Follow these steps to insert a sound file
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, double-click the sound.html file. Click in the empty paragraph just 
below the What fruit is being eaten in this clip? paragraph.
2.	 Choose Insert > Media > Plugin (Figure 10-10).
Figure 10-10: Choose the generic Plugin option to insert sound.
3.	 In the Select File dialog box, go to the assets folder located in the dw10lessons root folder. 
Choose the crunch.mp3 file and click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
A plug-in icon (   ) appears in the table, indicating that a plug-in is required to hear the 
sound. This plug-in will play in the handler application set for .mp3s in your browser. On 
the Mac, for example this will be the QuickTime player and in Windows this will be the 
Windows Media player. Again, this may be the first time your system has encountered an 
MP3 file in the browser, and you may be prompted to download an additional plug-in.
Even though there is no visual element to an audio file, by setting the width, you can 
allow the handler application to display a controller.
4.	 Click the edge of the plug-in icon and drag it to the right to extend it to approximately 
150 pixels wide.
5.	 Choose File > Save, then preview the page in a browser by pressing the File > Preview in 
browser button. In most browsers, the sound will play automatically.
To give users the ability to control the playback of the sound file you will need to change a 
parameter back in Dreamweaver.

9.	 Close your browser. 
Preparing audio for the Web
Audio has the same considerations as any other digital file type. You need to pay 
attention to file size while trying to maintain quality. 
Various programs offer audio-editing and format capabilities. This includes programs 
such as Adobe Soundbooth, Apple Soundtrack Pro, and Audacity (which is available as a 
free download on the Web).
Once you’ve edited a sound to your liking, you need to set up certain technical 
specifications for the final file. This includes the type of file you’ll output (.mp3, .aif, and 
so on), whether the sound is in stereo or mono, and a sample rate. For the Web, a good 
sample rate is in the 22kHz–32kHz range; 22kHz is at the low end of acceptable quality, 
and anything higher than 32kHz starts to weigh down the file size. 
Stereo is nice, but unnecessary, unless you’re moving sound from the left speaker to the 
right speaker and vice versa. You can save a significant amount of file space by keeping 
the sound file set to mono.
There are a number of compression choices when it comes to audio. Your best bet is 
to experiment and see what gives you the results you want. Creating audio files is very 
much like creating video for the Web: there are no definite answers, and you need to 
experiment to find the best balance between file size and quality.

Business Case
The Organic Utopia site is now growing in size. The company owners are intent 
on adding a lot more information that will require many more pages. The design of 
the site needs to remain uniform, but remain easy to update. Dreamweaver offers 
tools to streamline the process in the form of templates and library items.
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw11lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create a site definition that points to the dw11lessons folder. Go to Site 
> New Site, or, for details on creating a site definition, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
Creating modular page elements
You may have heard the term modular before; whether referring to a prebuilt house that you 
can cart away and place on your property, or a well-built, scalable website. Modular refers to 
anything you can break down into standardized, reusable components.
Most websites contain common elements such as headers, footers, and menus that appear 
consistently across each page. The ability to convert these elements into reusable items is 
essential for maintaining a consistent look and feel across your pages. Add the ability to 
make components manageable from a single place and to make sitewide updates, and editing 
becomes a breeze.

Introducing snippets
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
310
Lesson 11
Dreamweaver provides three modular features: snippets, library items, and templates. Each 
feature offers a different level of reusability, from simple code tidbits to entire pages, complete 
with navigation, content, and styling.
Introducing snippets
As you build pages and websites, you’ll find yourself creating many similar items several times 
over. Whether you’re creating a two-column layout table or a contact form, snippets make 
it possible to add any piece of code to a common library, where you can reuse it by simply 
dragging and dropping it into the page. You can store virtually any item on a page as a snippet. 
The Snippets panel is like a super clipboard, and using a snippet is similar to copying and 
pasting an element onto your page. Changes to a snippet in the Snippets panel do not update 
snippets you’ve already used in your pages. For this reason, snippets are a great way to store and 
place any common page elements that you don’t need to manage globally.
Examples of snippets might include common navigation bars, form elements, tables, and 
even JavaScripts. Snippets are stored as part of the Dreamweaver application, and they 
are not specific to any Dreamweaver site. You can add your own snippets directly within 
Dreamweaver, and they will be available for you to use at any time on any site.
The Snippets panel
The Snippets panel displays all available Dreamweaver snippets, broken down by category. You 
can add and edit snippets and categories directly from the Snippets panel. Using a snippet from 
the Snippets panel is as simple as locating it and dragging it from the panel to the page. 
Dreamweaver provides many ready-to-use snippets that serve as great starting points for forms, 
lists, and navigation bars (to name a few); many of these require little more than text changes 
and some basic styling. In the following lesson, you will use some of these snippets to quickly 
build existing pages for the product display component of the Organic Utopia site. 
Follow these steps to insert a snippet
Step-by-Step
1.	 Double-click the home.html file in the Files panel to open it. Choose Window > 
Snippets to launch the Snippets panel (you can also click on the Snippets tab). In the 
category list, locate the Text folder and click on the arrow to the left to expand it (Figure 
11-1). You’ll use the service mark snippet to add a service mark to this page.
Figure 11-1: The Snippets panel contains many  
categories of pre-built snippets for your use.

2.	 Click to the right of the heading, Welcome to organic utopia. Inside the Text folder, double-
click the service mark snippet, and a superscripted sm appears in the heading.
3.	 At the top of the Snippets panel is a preview of the code that was inserted. In the Snippets 
panel, click on the panel menu (
) in the upper-right corner and choose Edit. The Snippets 
dialog box appears with a name, a description, the snippet type, and then the actual code 
(Figure 11-2). This snippet is using the <sup>, or superscript, HTML element.

4.	 Press Cancel, as you won’t be making any changes at this time.
5.	 Choose File > Save.
Creating new snippets
Whenever you have something on a page that you’d like to reuse, creating a new snippet is 
a good option. You can create new snippets directly from the Snippets panel, and from any 
selected element(s) on a page. 
In this section, you’ll convert a pre-existing table to a snippet.
Follow these steps to create a new snippet
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose File > Open, and choose the gardentips.html page. This page has a pre-styled 
table. Converting this table to a snippet will allow you to place it anywhere you like. 
2.	 Click anywhere inside the table, and then choose Modify > Table > Select Table. You 
could also click on the edge of the table to select it.
3.	 For this next step, you need to make sure the Text folder within the Snippets panel is not 
selected. If the folder is still open, click the minus sign (-) (Windows) or arrow (Mac OS) 
to collapse it. This also ensures that the folder is no longer highlighted. At the bottom of 
the Snippets panel, click on the New Snippet icon ( ). The Snippet dialog box opens, and 
all the code within the table is automatically copied into the Insert before window.
4.	 In the Name field, type Vege_table. In the Description field, type A three column 
styled table listing the latin and family names of common vegetables. For the 
Snippet type, select the Insert block option. For Preview type, select the Design option as 
seen in Figure 11-3 and then press OK.

Introducing snippets
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 11
Choosing the Insert Block option ensures that the table is inserted as a stand-alone element. 
Setting the Preview type to Design allows you to see a preview of the table in the Snippets 
panel, rather than the code.
Figure 11-3: Setting options in the Snippet dialog box.
In the Snippets panel, you see the new snippet listed. By default, it is located in the last folder 
you used (Text). Before you do anything else, you’ll organize your Snippets panel.
5.	 In the bottom of the Snippets panel, click on the New Snippet Folder icon (
). A new folder 
appears; rename this folder ou snippets, then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). 
Click on the Vege_table snippet and drag it on top of this new folder. 
Snippets are actually external files with the extension .csn and are stored deep within your 
operating system. If someone else has used your current computer to do this lesson, you 
may see this snippet already present. You may remove it by clicking on the snippet and 
then clicking the Remove icon (
) at the bottom of the Snippets panel.

Introducing snippets
6.	 Click once on the Vege_table snippet, if necessary. In the top half of the panel, there is 
a design preview of the table. It is most likely cropped. Depending on how much space 
you have, it may not be possible to view the entire table; however, you can expand this 
window by clicking on the dividing line of the panel, and dragging up or down until it 
resembles Figure 11-4. 
Figure 11-4: Click and drag the dividing line in the Snippets  
panel to expand or contract the view.
7.	 Choose File > Open, and choose the latin_names.html file. Click once below the 
Heading, Latin and Family names for common vegetables. In the Snippets panel, double-
click the Vege_table snippet, and it is inserted into the new page.
In many ways, a snippet is just a faster way to copy and paste. However, there are a few 
things to be aware of. Snippets only copy the HTML code and none of the associated CSS. 
If you look at the preview of the table snippet in the Snippets panel, you will see that it 
is unstyled. However, when you inserted it into the latin_names page, it appeared styled. 
This is because the Snippets panel only previews the raw HTML in the design view. The 
CSS rules for the table are being saved in an external stylesheet and all the pages in this site 
are already linked to this stylesheet. If you inserted this table into a blank page, it would 
appear unstyled until you attached the style sheet to the page.

8.	 In the Snippets panel, click on the panel menu in the upper-right corner and choose Edit. 
The Snippet dialog box appears. In the first line, change the table width value to 350 
(Figure 11-5) and press OK. This has no effect on the current table because there is no link 
between the code in the Snippets panel and the code on your page. However, all future 
tables will use the new value.
Figure 11-5: Changing the table width when editing a snippet.
9.	 Choose File > Save All. Keep this document open for the next exercise.
Take Note...
The Snippets panel lets you modify a snippet only through its HTML code. Here’s a 
shortcut: if you make a change in the Design view, you can recreate the snippet by selecting it 
and then choosing New Snippet from the Snippets panel. If you select the folder containing the 
original snippet and save it under the same name, you will be prompted to replace it.
Introducing library items
While snippets are useful, they are perhaps most useful for items that will never change, like 
a person’s name or a logo. However, a more powerful concept is an item that you can add to 
multiple pages and have linked to an original master item. This is where Dreamweaver library 
items come in.
With Dreamweaver library items, you can save any common element and manage it from 
a master copy in your site folder. When you place a library item on a page, the item remains 
attached to its master; any changes you make to the master automatically update any instances 
of the item placed throughout your site. Dreamweaver makes sure that any instances of a 
library item are synchronized.
Library items (unlike snippets) are specific to each Dreamweaver site, and they are stored as 
separate .lbi files in your site’s Library folder.

Introducing library items
1.	 Library items are located in the Assets panel. Choose Window > Assets, if it isn’t already 
open, and then click the Library icon (
) at the very bottom. The panel is empty because 
there are no library items in your site, yet (Figure 11-6).
Figure 11-6: The Library Items category of the Assets panel.
You can add, edit, and manage all library items in your site directly from this panel. You 
will now convert the Global Navigation menu in your header to a library item. 
2.	 Click on the home.html tab in the top of your document window to open this page. 
Click on the border of the GlobalNav <div> element in the upper-right corner to select it. 
(This is the small box that contains the “Site Map | Login” text.)

Introducing library items
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
316
Lesson 11
3.	 In the Assets panel, click the New Library Item button ( ). You will see a dialog box 
appear, warning you that this style sheet information will not be copied with this item. 
Press OK. The selected menu is added as a new library item; name it GlobalNav. If you’re 
prompted to update links, choose Update. This ensures that any hyperlinks or references 
to image files are preserved. The GlobalNav div is now linked to the new library item you 
created. Note that your GlobaNav div is now highlighted in yellow (Figure 11-7) ; this 
is the visual indicator Dreamweaver uses for library items. Now you’re ready to add this 
library item to other pages.
Figure 11-7: The GlobalNav <div> element is highlighted yellow because it is  
now a library item.
4.	 Click on the gardentips.html tab at the top of your document window to view this page 
(or open the file it if it is closed). Locate the GlobalNav library item in the Assets panel, 
and drag it onto the header of the page. An instance of the GlobalNav <div> element is 
placed. 
5.	 Click on the latin_names.html tab (or open it if it is closed) from the Files panel. As you 
did in step 4, drag a copy of the GlobalNav library item from the Assets panel to the header 
section. Just as before, an instance of the GlobalNav <div> element is placed.
The GlobalNav is now set in the exact location across three pages of your site. You will 
now modify your library item and all three pages will change.
Modifying and updating library items
The convenience and power of library items are apparent when you need to update a common 
item across several pages. Because all instances of a library item remain attached to a master copy, 
when the master item is edited from the library item list, every instance mirrors these changes.
You can edit library items from the Assets panel or by choosing the Open button from the 
Property Inspector when a library item instance is selected on the page. 
Follow these steps to modify a library item
Step-by-Step

Lesson 11

Lesson 11: Maximizing Site Design
Introducing library items
1.	 From the Library Items list in the Assets panel, double-click the GlobalNav library item 
to open it for editing. A new tab opens because the library item is actually a new file: 
GlobalNav.lbi (Figure 11-8). 
Figure 11-8: The GlobalNav library item opens as a separate document and has no style associated with it.
It’s important to realize that there is no style information associated with this file, 
as Dreamweaver warned you when you created the item. However, this is actually a 
good thing; it simply takes getting used to the idea that you are modifying the HTML 
content—all the style information resides in the style sheet.
2.	 Where it currently reads Login, select the text, then type Your Account. You will now 
link the text within the GlobalNav menu to the appropriate HTML pages. Select the text 
Your Account, then in the Property Inspector, click on the HTML button, if necessary. 
Next, click on the Browse for File folder icon (
) to the right of the link field. In the 
Select File window, choose login.html. Press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).
3.	 Select the Site Map text. In the Property Inspector, click on the HTML tab if necessary, 
and click on the Browse for File icon (
) to the right of the link field. In the Select File 
dialog box, choose sitemap.html, then press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS). 
4.	 Choose File > Save. The Update Library Items dialog box appears with a list of the three 
files (Figure 11-9). Whenever you modify a library item and save it, a list of all files using 
the item appears, and you are given the choice to update or not. 
Figure 11-9: When saving library items, any pages affected will appear  
in the Update Library Items dialog box.
5.	 Click Update. The files update and the Update Pages dialog box appears.

Introducing library items

Lesson 11
6.	 Click on the Show Log option in the Update Pages dialog box. A list of the files that were 
updated appears; this is where you can check to see if there were any problems and how 
many files were updated. Press Close.
7.	 Open home.html, gardentips.html, and latin_names.html if they were not already 
open, and you see that all instances of the menu have been updated in all three pages. 
Library items are tremendously powerful; the larger the site, the more useful they become. 
They are tremendously useful with hyperlinked navigation, where they can help prevent 
broken hyperlinks. 
For example, currently you have three documents all using a library item that is linked to 
the login.html and sitemap.html pages. But what happens if you move those two pages 
into a new folder? You will do this now so you can see how Dreamweaver keeps track of 
the move and prompts you to update the links.
8.	 Click on the Files tab, if necessary, to view the list of files in your site as seen in Figure 
11-10. Click on the root folder at the top of the panel (Site – dw11lessons), and then right-
click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) to open a context menu. Choose New Folder. 
Rename the new folder GlobalNav and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Figure 11-10: Right-clicking on the root  
folder allows you to create a new folder.
9.	 In the Files panel, click and drag the login.html file into this new GlobalNav folder. As 
soon as you do, the Update Files dialog box appears with the list of all the files that need to 
be updated. This is a huge time-saver if you need to restructure your site. Traditionally, you 
would have to go to each page and relink everything that pointed to this page. Now click 
Update, and the links on each page are all updated behind the scenes.
10.	 Click and drag the sitemap.html file to the GlobalNav folder; press Update, and all the 
files are updated. 
11.	 Choose File > Save All, update your pages if prompted, and then close all your open files.
Take Note...
Occasionally you may need to detach a library item from its master. In order to do this, you 
must select the library item and then click Detach from original from the Property Inspector. Just 
be aware that once a library item is detached, any future changes must be made manually. Also, 
it is sometimes easier to select a library item in the Code view rather than in the Design view.

Introducing templates
Introducing templates
If you are creating several pages that need to share the same look and layout, Dreamweaver 
templates are for you. A Dreamweaver template is a master document from which other pages 
can be created; these pages inherit all the elements from the original template, but you can 
modify each page to include unique content and elements. As with library items, when you 
edit a template, all pages based on that template update to reflect your changes.
When you create a template, you specify editable regions, or areas of the page that you can 
modify. By default, all elements of a page created from a template are locked for editing. 
You can make changes only from the original master template. You can set sections of a 
page as editable so that you can add or modify content without accidentally (or intentionally) 
disturbing the original layout.
Templates are also a great mechanism for controlling access to pages on a site. If you need to 
provide editing ability to others, you can lock out important page elements and give users 
access to only certain sections of the page.
Templates are site-specific and are stored in a Templates folder under your site’s root folder. 
You open, edit, or create templates from the Templates list in the Assets panel.
Take Note...
Dreamweaver templates work with Contribute, a basic but powerful web content  
management tool. You can design and manage templates that can be modified and  
published by Contribute users.
Creating a new template
For the Organic Utopia site, imagine that you need to create many different category and 
product detail pages for the products in the store. To do this, you’ll set up templates for each page 
so that new pages can be easily created but will remain visually consistent with the master layout.
Follow these steps to create a new Dreamweaver template
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel (Window > Files), locate and double-click the product_detail.html 
page to open it for editing. This page has generic text and a placeholder image that will 
serve as your template.
2.	 Click on your Assets panel, and then click on the library item. As you did with the other 
pages, click and drag the GlobalNav item onto the header. This page will shortly serve as 
a template, and by including a library item, you are maximizing automation.

Introducing templates

3.	 Save the product_detail.html page as a template by choosing File > Save as Template. 
The Save As Template dialog box appears as seen in Figure 11-11. 
Figure 11-11: Naming a new template.
4.	 Choose Save to save the template. If prompted, allow Dreamweaver to update any links by 
choosing Yes from the dialog box.
Working with editable regions
Once you create a template, you have the ability to add template objects which are special 
features only available to this page type. The most common template object is the editable 
region. When new HTML pages are generated from templates, the editable region defines 
the section of a page you would like to be editable and all other areas will remain non-editable.
Follow these steps to create an editable region in a template
Step-by-Step
1.	 Select the placeholder text in the product_detail template that reads Product Category. 
Choose Insert > Template Objects > Editable Region. The New Editable Region dialog 
box appears.
2.	 Name the new editable region ProductCategory and click OK. The placeholder text 
now appears inside a black box with a blue tab at the top. This portion of the page and the 
content within it will now be editable in any pages created from this template.
3.	 Select the placeholder text in the product_detail template that reads Product Name. 
Choose Insert > Template Objects > Editable Region. The New Editable Region dialog 
box appears. Name this ProductName and click OK.
4.	 Select the image placeholder, then choose Insert > Template Objects > Editable Region. 
The New Editable Region window appears. Name this ProductImage (as seen in 
Figure 11-12) and click OK.

6.	 Choose File > Save to save the template. You may see a warning about putting the editable 
region within a block tag; click OK.
At this point, you can create any number of pages and manage them from this template. 
The editable regions you created will allow you to add content to any new pages based 
on this template, but will protect the main layout and page elements from unintended 
changes.
Creating new pages from templates
Now you’re ready to create multiple product pages that will be based on the new template you 
have built. You’ll create two pages, enough to give you a sense of how templates work.
Follow these steps to create a new page using a template
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose File > New. In the New Document dialog box, click the Page from Template 
option. The Site column lists all the sites you have defined; click the dw11lessons site. In the 
second column, the product_detail template should be selected. Press Create. This opens 
a new, untitled document based on the template. Choose File > Save. When prompted, 
navigate to the products folder in the dw11 lessons folder. Name this file eggplants.html 
and press Save.
2.	 Click inside the header of your page and notice that you are unable to select or move 
anything. This section is uneditable. Notice, in the upper-right corner, the yellow 
highlighted box that reads Template:product_detail. In a similar fashion to library items, 
this yellow highlight indicates that the page is based on a template.
Dividing a page into editable and non-editable regions can be useful for any situation 
where the designer of the site would like some control over how the site is modified. 
Someone not familiar with Dreamweaver could easily learn to update the editable regions, 
and at the same time, there would be little risk that they click on something by accident 
and modify it.
3.	 Select the text inside the ProductCategory editable area and type Vegetables. Select the 
text in the ProductName area and type Eggplants. Select the Product_image placeholder, 
and in the Property Inspector, press the Browse for File button (
) to the right of the Src 
text field (Figure 11-13).
Figure 11-13: Click on the Folder icon to locate the eggplant image.
Navigate through your dw11lessons folder and locate the images folder. Select the

If you want to modify a template-based page beyond what the editable regions allow, you can 
use the Modify > Templates > Detach from Template command, which breaks the current 
page away from the master template, allowing you to edit it freely. Keep in mind that a page

Repeating regions
A single region may not be the best way to display the content you add to a template-based 
page. You may require a template that can handle a number of items, such as a table that 
displays products in a category. If you need to build a flexible template that can hold any 
number of uniform items, you can add a repeating region to it.
Repeating regions allow you to define an element on a template as repeatable. When you 
create a page based on that template, you can increase, or repeat, the number of regions to 
accommodate the information. You’ll also be able to reorder these repeated regions at any time 
without having to move the content. For example, you could set elements such as a table row, 
paragraph, or small display table as a repeating region, and then duplicate as many as you need 
to fit the content at hand.
A repeating region is not automatically editable. You need to set editable regions inside any 
repeating element in order to add to or edit its content.
In the following steps, you’ll add a repeating region to your category.html page and convert it 
to a template so that you can use it to display any number of products in a specific category.

You’re now ready to create a page from the new category_display template and see how 
repeating regions work. 
Follow these steps to create a new page with a repeating region template
Step-by-Step
1.	 Open the Assets panel if necessary, then select the category_display template, and choose 
New from Template from the Assets panel menu.
2.	 Save the new document as category_chocolate.html in your site’s root folder. Notice the 
new repeating region in the middle of the page—its tab features four buttons that allow 
you to add, remove, and shift repeating regions up or down in the stacking order (seen in 
Figure 11-18). 
Figure 11-18: A repeating region has four buttons you can use.
3.	 Click the plus sign button (+) on the top of the repeating region; a new table row with two 
more product display tables appears. Press the plus sign button two more times to see how it 
will automatically add new rows. Press the minus sign button to see how to remove a row. 
In the next step, you’ll fill in the first four products with information to complete your page. 
4.	 In the first row, type Belgian Chocolate in the ProductName text field and French 
Chocolate in the ProductName2 text field. In the second row, type German Chocolate 
in the ProductName text field and Swiss Chocolate in the ProductName2 text field. 
The four products now appear in the category page, and as an added benefit, if you wanted 
to reorder the rows you could do so using the repeating region toolbar.

Creating a Library Item from Scratch
Project 11-1
You’ll practice creating a library item from scratch since we supplied one to you last time. One 
thing to consider is what makes a good candidate for a library item, the menu you did earlier 
was a great example. This time, we’ll do something a simpler that while it will only need to be 
updated once a year, it’s a good choice for a library item since it is information that could be 
featured throughout the site.
1.	 Choose File > New > Blank Page > HTML > None to create a new empty webpage.
2.	 Type out (Your Name or Company Here) Copyright 2012 on your webpage. 
3.	 Save the page as copyright.html.
4.	 Go to Window > Assets, make sure the Library button has been selected.
5.	 Select the copyright text you just typed.
6.	 Click the New Library Item button at the bottom of the panel. 
7.	 Name the library item copyright.
8.	 Place your new copyright text on separate pages or better still templates and update as 
needed!
More Template Exploration
Project 11-2
One of the more powerful ways to create an efficient workflow is to build your own templates 
of course. However, Dreamweaver does offer a starting point if you’re looking for some layout 
ideas. 
1.	 Choose File > New.
2.	 Choose the Blank Template category on the left followed by the HTML template for the 
Template Type. 
3.	 Pick any one of the numerous layouts to explore. We recommend creating several and 
investigating the various layouts at your disposal and modifying them.

Business Case
Up to now, the owners at Organic Utopia have loved your work. Unfortunately, 
they’re working with a new programming expert who is quite adamant about the 
code format. However, you are not a code expert, so you cannot achieve cleaner code 
without having a strong programming background. Dreamweaver includes some 
great options that will help you achieve clean, organized code without having to be 
a professional developer. 
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw12lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw12lessons folder. Go to 
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
Working with code 
Although Dreamweaver’s traditional audience has been for those who prefer to work in the 
Design view and not with code, there are many good reasons to dive into the code editing 
view. In this lesson, you will look at some of the unique functions available in the Code view 
by taking a look at an older web page.

Lesson 12
Accessing code with the Quick Tag editor 
In this exercise, you will use a feature called the Quick Tag editor. This feature is generally for 
users who are more familiar with their code. The Quick Tag editor offers an easy way to add 
CSS class or ID names as well as attributes to your code without having to leave the Design 
view. The Quick Tag editor works in conjunction with the tag selector. In this exercise, you’ll 
apply a CSS class to an image to float it to the right.
Follow these steps to use the Quick Tag editor
Step-by-Step
1.	 Open the oldcode.html file, and click on the image of the beets. In the bottom-left of 
the document window is the tag selector which now has the <img> tag selected.
2.	 Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) the <img> tag in the tag selector. A 
contextual menu appears with all the code for the selected image. Choose Quick Tag Editor 
from the menu. The Quick Tag Editor appears as seen in Figure 12-1, displaying the code 
for this tag.
Figure 12-1: Viewing the attributes and properties of a tag in the Quick Tag Editor.
Instead of switching to the Code view to make changes to this code, you can make 
changes within the editor.
3.	 Click once after the align="left" code and press the spacebar. A code-hinting menu 
is triggered, allowing you to choose from a list of possible choices. Double-click the class 
option; the code will be written for you. Notice that the only option, floatright, is 
listed; press the Return (or Enter) key to apply this class. Your image now has the class 
applied and is floating to the right.
You can also use the Quick Tag Editor to remove unnecessary code. For example, this 
page uses the older <font> tag to style text.

4.	 Click anywhere inside the main paragraph of your document. In the tag selector, click 
on the <font> tag and then right+click (Windows) or Ctrl-click (Mac OS) and from the 
context menu choose the Remove Tag option as seen in Figure 12-2. 
Figure 12-2: Quickly remove a tag by choosing Remove Tag.
This removes both the opening and closing font tags and the text now reverts to its default 
unstyled appearance.
Inserting tags with the Tag Chooser
Dreamweaver’s Tag Chooser is a dialog box that allows you to insert any tag into your page 
with the Dreamweaver tag libraries—these include the Macromedia ColdFusion, ASP.NET, 
and PHP tag libraries among others. The Tag Chooser allows you to insert any tag from the 
Dreamweaver tag libraries in your page.
Follow these steps to insert a tag with the Tag Chooser
Step-by-Step
1.	 Switch to Code view by choosing View > Code or by pressing the Code View button on 
the Document toolbar.
2.	 Click in line 5 immediately before the <style> tag and press return. Now click back in the 
empty line 5. You will now add the title tag, which this document does not have.
3.	 Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac OS) and select Insert Tag. The Tag Chooser 
appears. The left pane contains a list of supported tag libraries, and the right pane shows 
the individual tags in the selected library.

4.	 Expand the HTML tags library if necessary, and then click the Page Composition 
subcategory; click the General category, and then click the <title></title> tag. Click 
the Tag Info button to expand this window (Figure 12-3). This info gives you a brief 
synopsis of the function of the tag and is a great way to learn more about HTML tags. 
 
Figure 12-3: Use the Tag Chooser to add from a list of tags. Click on the Tag Info button to learn more about the tag.
5.	 Click the Insert button to add the tag to your code, then click the Close button. Your 
cursor is inside the <title> tags so type The Lowly Beet.
The Tag Chooser helps you categorize and use  HTML tags
Although you have been working with HTML tags throughout the book, the Tag Chooser  
you just used is a great way to view and access all the tags available in HTML as well as learn 
more about their their exact function using the Tag Info description.
• The Page Composition section includes HTML tags such as the html, head, body and 
title tags
• The Formatting and Layout section includes HTML tags such as the h1–h6, p, em, and 
strong tags.

Inserting and editing comments
Comments are descriptive text that you insert in HTML code to explain the code or provide 
other information. By default, the text of the comment appears only in the Code view and is 
not displayed in a browser. You can also modify existing comments. In this exercise, you’ll add 
your own comment to the HTML code, and edit a comment already in the code.
Follow these steps to insert and edit an HTML comment
Step-by-Step
1.	 Go back into Design view by clicking on the Design view button in the Document 
toolbar. Click in front of the first character in the first paragraph and choose Insert > 
Comment. 
2.	 Dreamweaver displays the Comment dialog box. Type We need to add two or three 
links to other websites in the text below as seen in Figure 12-4 and then press OK.
Figure 12-4: Type the comment into the Comment dialog box.
3.	 If you have not already set this up on your system, a box will appear warning that you will 
not be able to see comment markers in the Design view. If this message appears, select 
View > Visual Aids > Invisible Elements. Press OK. You will now enable the preference 
to view Invisible Elements.
4.	 Choose Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver > Preferences (Mac OS) and click 
on the Invisible Elements category. Check the box for Comments, and click OK. You now 
see a small icon with an exclamation point (!)—this is the visual representation of your 
comment. Click on the icon and the Properties panel will display the comments.
Comments are a good way to communicate to members of a team who may be working 
on the same file. These comments are also visible in the Code view.
5.	 Switch back to the Code view by choosing View > Code or by pressing the Code view 
button on the Document toolbar. 

Using HTML5 Code-hinting

Lesson 12
In the line that corresponds to the location of your comment, Dreamweaver has inserted a 
comment tag (in gray, by default) that looks like Figure 12-5: 
 
Figure 12-5: Comments inserted into your code can be seen in both Design and Code view.
Take Note...
To delete a comment, select it in Design view and press Delete. In the Code view, highlight 
the entire line and delete it.
6.	 Choose File > Save to save your work.
Using HTML5 Code-hinting
The internal library of code that is available to Dreamweaver CS6 evolves as the language of 
the Web evolves. If you are working with the next generation of web pages, Dreamweaver has 
access to the latest HTML5 elements.
Follow these steps to use the code-hinting panel
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Code view, locate the <img> element on or around line 20. Place your cursor 
immediately before the opening <img> tag and press Return (Mac OS) or Enter 
(Windows) to move this code to the next line. 
Click once in the empty line you just created above the <img> element. You will now be 
adding a new HTML5 element.
2.	 Type a left angle bracket (<): Dreamweaver’s code-hinting panel appears. Code-hinting 
is a feature that displays a list of every element that is a part of Dreamweaver’s library of 
HTML tags.

in Figure 12-6 and press Return (Mac OS) or Enter (PC).
 
Figure 12-6: Use code-hinting to select the HTML5 figure tag.
3.	 Type the closing bracket. Dreamweaver will not automatically do it for you.
The HTML5 <figure> element is designed to help structure your web pages by giving 
you a more specific way to define images on your pages. For example, you could add a 
common style for all figures on your page.
4.	 You need to add the closing tag for the figure element, so click once at the end of the line 
of the <img> code and press Return.
5.	 On this new line, type a left bracket and a forward slash: </. Dreamweaver will 
automatically complete (auto-complete) the rest of the tag as seen in Figure 12-7.
 
Figure 12-7: Dreamweaver will auto-complete your closing tags.

Code Hints category. To turn off code-hinting, click to clear the Enable Code Hints checkbox. 
To prevent Dreamweaver from auto-completing your tags, select Never from the Close 
tags section.

Working in the Code view
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
340
Lesson 12
Working in the Code view
As you’ve seen, the Code view is a hand-coding environment for writing and editing HTML 
and CSS. More experienced users who work in scripting languages such as JavaScript, PHP, 
and ColdFusion, can modify their workspace to suit the way they prefer to work with code.
View options
You can set word wrapping, display line numbers for the code, highlight invalid code, set 
syntax coloring for code elements, set indenting, and show hidden characters from the 
View > Code View Options menu. The Code view options are not available when you 
are in the Design view, only when in Code or Split view.
Word Wrap: wraps the code so that you can view it without scrolling horizontally. This 
option doesn’t insert line breaks; it just makes the code easier to view. 
Line Numbers: displays line numbers along the side of the code. 
Hidden Characters: displays special characters in place of white space. For example, 
a dot replaces each space, a double chevron replaces each tab, and a paragraph marker 
replaces each line break. 
Highlight Invalid Code: causes Dreamweaver to highlight all HTML code that 
isn’t valid in yellow. When you select an invalid tag, the Property Inspector displays 
information on how to correct the error. 
Syntax Coloring: enables or disables code coloring.
Auto Indent: makes your code indent automatically when you press Enter or Return 
while writing code. The new line of code indents to the same level as the previous line.
Syntax Error Alerts: in Info Bar conveniently displays mistakes in your code.
Modifying the Code view workspace
You can view the source code for Dreamweaver documents in several ways. You can display it 
in the document window by switching to the Code view, you can split the document window 
to display both the visual page and its related code in Split view, or you can work in the Code 
Inspector, a separate coding window. The Code Inspector works like a detachable version of 
the Code view for the current page.
Follow these steps to modify your workspace
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose View > Code and Design, to view the code and visually edit the page in the 
document window at the same time. By default the Code view is split with the Code on 
the left and Design view on the right.

3.	 Place your cursor over the splitter bar between the Design view and the Code view. Click 
and drag the bar to the right and the Design view will expand as the Code view contracts. 
4.	 Choose Window > Code Inspector (Figure 12-9). Working in the Code Inspector is 
just like working in the Code view, except that it is in a separate window. This might be 
useful, depending on how you choose to manage your workspace (for example, users who 
have two monitors could put this window in a separate window). 
 
Figure 12-9: You can also view your HTML code in the Code Inspector window.
Press the Close button to close the Code Inspector for now. From the View menu, choose

5.	 Choose View > Code. You will now look at some of the coding features available in the 
coding toolbar in Dreamweaver.
The Coding toolbar
The Coding toolbar contains buttons that let you perform many standard coding operations, 
such as collapsing and expanding code selections, highlighting invalid code, applying and 
removing comments, indenting code, and inserting recently used code snippets. The Coding 
toolbar is visible only in the Code view and appears vertically on the left side of the document 
window. To see what each button does, position the cursor over it until a tooltip appears.

Open Documents
Lists the documents that are open. When you select a document, 
it is displayed in the document window.
Show Code Navigator
Displays a list of code sources related to a particular selection 
on your page. Use it to navigate to related code sources, such 
as internal and external CSS rules, server-side includes, external 
JavaScript files, parent template files, library files, and iframe 
source files. You can access the Code Navigator from Design, 
Code, and Split views, as well as from the Code Inspector.
Collapse Full Tag
Collapses the content between a set of opening and closing tags 
(for example, the content between <body> and </body>). You 
must place the insertion point in the opening or closing tag and 
then click to collapse it.
Collapse Selection
Collapses the selected code.
Expand All
Restores all collapsed code.
Select Parent Tag
Selects the content and surrounding opening and closing 
tags of the line in which you’ve placed the insertion point. If 
you repeatedly click this button, and your tags are balanced, 
Dreamweaver will eventually select the outermost <html> and 
</html> tags.
Balance Braces
Selects the content and surrounding parentheses, braces, or 
square brackets of the line in which you’ve placed the insertion 
point. If you repeatedly click this button, and your surrounding 
symbols are balanced, Dreamweaver will eventually select the 
outermost braces, parentheses, or brackets in the document.
Line Numbers
Hides or shows numbers at the beginning of each line of code.
Highlight Invalid Code
Highlights invalid code in yellow.
Word Wrap
Changes the Word Wrap from Soft Wrap to Hard Wrap (or vice-
versa)
Syntax Error Alerts in 
Info Bar
Enables or disables an information bar at the top of the page 
that alerts you to syntax errors. When Dreamweaver detects a 
syntax error, the Syntax Error Information bar specifies the line 
in the code where the error occurs. Additionally, Dreamweaver 
highlights the error’s line number on the left side of the 
document in Code view. The info bar is enabled by default, but 
only appears when Dreamweaver detects syntax errors in the 
page.

Applies previously specified code formats to selected code or 
to the entire page if no code is selected. You can also quickly 
set code formatting preferences by selecting Code Formatting 
Settings from the Format Source Code button, or edit tag libraries 
by selecting Edit Tag Libraries.
The number of buttons available in the Coding toolbar varies depending on the size of the 
Code view in the document window. To see all the available buttons, resize the Code view 
window or click the Show More arrow at the bottom of the Coding toolbar.
Collapsing and expanding tags and code blocks
Dreamweaver lets you collapse and expand code fragments so that you can hide and show 
various sections of your code. This can help reduce the amount of screen space that is taken up 
and also prevent mistakes since code that is collapsed cannot be edited. When you select code, 
Dreamweaver adds a set of collapse buttons next to the selection (minus symbols in Windows; 
vertical triangles in Mac OS). You can collapse code only in the Code view.
Follow these steps to collapse or expand tags and code blocks
Step-by-Step
1.	 Make sure you are in the Code view by pressing the Code view button on the Document 
toolbar. Scroll to the top of the screen if necessary and click anywhere between lines 6 and 
14, which is the <style>, tag that contains all your CSS. 
2.	 Click the Collapse Full Tag button in the coding toolbar. You can also choose Edit > 
Code Collapse > Collapse Full Tag. The <style> tag is now collapsed (Figure 12-10). 
This feature is useful for reducing the amount of screen space that your code occupies on 
the screen.
 
Figure 12-10: The Collapse Full Tag button collapses the relevant tag.
Click on the plus sign (Windows) or arrow (Mac OS) on the left to expand the code again.

3.	 In the Coding toolbar click on the Select Parent Tag button. This will select the code that 
is nesting your existing selection. In this case, the parent is the <head> tag, which is now 
selected.
Take Note...
The Select Parent Tag button is a great alternative to selecting code by hand. Selecting by 
hand can often introduce mistakes; the Select Parent Tag will always be more reliable and 
faster.
4.	 In the Coding toolbar click on the Collapse Selection button to collapse the <head> tag 
and all its content. You could have also chosen Edit > Code Collapse > Collapse Selection. 
5.	 Click anywhere within your document and note that you could begin to work in your 
HTML and the <head> tag will always remain collapsed until you need to access it.
6.	 Double-click the head tag to expand it again as seen in Figure 12-11.
 
Figure 12-11: Double-clicking collapsed code will expand it.
Take Note...
To expand all code at once, you can also choose Edit > Code Collapse > Expand All. All 
your code fragments are now restored to their original view.
Validating your code
In addition to the many options available for formatting your code, you can also use 
Dreamweaver to find out if your code has tag or syntax errors; this is called validating code. 
Dreamweaver can validate documents in many languages, including HTML, XHTML, PHP, 
ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML), Java Server Pages (JSP), Wireless Markup Language 
(WML), and XML. You can validate the current document or a selected tag. 
Highlighting and correcting invalid code
You can set Dreamweaver to highlight invalid code (in yellow) in the Code view. When you 
select a highlighted section, the Property Inspector offers information on how to correct the 
error. Invalid code is not highlighted by default in Code view. In order to view the invalid 
code, you must enable this option in the View menu.

2.	 Two tags become highlighted in yellow the <b> and the <i> tags (Figure 12-12).
 
Figure 12-12: Invalid code is highlighted in yellow in both the Design and Code views.
3.	 Click once on the first highlighted (invalid) code for the <b> tag. In the Property 
Inspector, this has been identified as invalid markup because there is an unclosed or 
overlapping tag as seen in Figure 12-13. (In this case, the author used two opening tags 
and no closing tags.)
 
Figure 12-13: The Property Inspector identifies the invalid code and suggests how to correct it.
4.	 Correct the error by removing the incorrect markup. Individually select each of the four 
highlighted tags and then delete them. You can now style them correctly either in the 
Design view or the Code view; for now, you will leave them as is.

Running a Report
Site reports allow you to scan your code using a set of criteria. Code which doesn’t fit the 
criteria is identified, allowing you to fix it. In this exercise, you’ll run all the reports for HTML.
Follow these steps to run a report
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose File > Save. Then choose Site > Reports and in the site Report window that 
appears, check all five boxes for HTML reports as seen in Figure 12-13. Be sure that 
the Report on menu is set to Current Document. You can also run reports sitewide, for 
certain files only or an entire folder.
 
Figure 12-13: Check the HTML Reports you would like to run.
2.	 Press Run; the results of the Report appear in a new Site Reports panel below the 
Properties panel. In this case, there are two warnings that the alt attribute is missing from 
your images. The alt attribute improves accessibility for images on your page for assistive 
devices, such as screenreaders. This is not technically required, but you should add them.
3.	 In the Site Reports panel, double-click the first warning. You will be sent directly to the 
code and the image will be selected. In the Properties panel, locate the Alt text field and 
type Logo as seen in Figure 12-14 nd then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to 
commit the change.

Type Beets in the Alt text field, then press Enter or Return to commit the change.
5.	 Choose File > Save to save your file. You should also close the entire group of the report 
tabs. You can do this by clicking on the context menu at the top-right of the panel and 
choosing Close Tab Group.
Formatting code
Once you’ve validated your code, you can further change its look by formatting code. This 
is done by specifying formatting preferences, such as indentation, line length, and the case 
of tag and attribute names. Many developers who code by hand have certain conventions 
or preferences for the way their code appears on the page or for the formatting used. 
Dreamweaver helps automate certain code formatting tasks that would otherwise be time-
consuming and tedious.
Follow these steps to set preferences for automating code formatting
Step-by-Step
1.	 Select Edit > Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver > Preferences (Mac OS). 
2.	 When the Preferences dialog box appears, select Code Format from the Category list on 
the left. The Code Format preferences appear on the right as seen in Figure 12-15. 
 
Figure 12-15: Choose from the Code Format preferences to further change the look of your code.
The Code Format preferences allow you to change the way code is written in 
Dreamweaver. For example, when you press the Tab key, your cursor indents four spaces. 
Using this preference window, you could increase or decrease the amount of the indent.

code, shifting it to the right or left by one tab. 
Follow these steps to change the indentation level of code
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Code view, click in front of the div element for the header and press the Tab key 
twice. Alternatively, you could select Edit > Indent Code or use the indent button on the 
Coding Toolbar. 
2.	 To outdent the selected block of code, press Shift+Tab, or you can select Edit > Outdent 
Code.
Take Note...
You can also select multiple elements and Indent and Outdent them. 
3.	 Choose File > Save to save your work, then close the file by choosing File > Close.

Further Exploration of the Tag Chooser — Inserting DIVs
Project 12-1
You had a taste of inserting a tag earlier in this exercise. Now, let’s try something you’re 
familiar with but from a different vantage point. Here, you’ll insert a DIV into an empty web 
page to see what kind of options the Tag Chooser offers as opposed to using the Insert DIV 
Tag button.
1.	 Choose File > New > Blank Page > HTML > None to create a new empty webpage.
2.	 Save the page as insert-div.html.
3.	 Choose Insert > Tag.
4.	 In the Tag Chooser, select HTML tags and then div, then click Insert.
5.	 Note the Tag Editor - div window: it offers access right away to properties such as 
alignment, style sheet attachment and accessibility, as well as interactive events. 
6.	 Explore the window and options available and try attaching a style sheet of your own.
7.	 Leave the file open for the next exercise below.

Lesson 13: Building Web Forms
Skill
Objective 
Create forms
4.13
Business Case
Organic Utopia owners have a requirement for their company’s website to encourage 
customer interaction and collect customer data for future marketing campaigns. 
They’d like you to come up with forms for their website that will allow such actions. 
The form tools give you the ability to create text fields that users can use to input 
data and then e-mail that data to a specific source for collection. 
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw13lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create a site definition that points to the dw13lessons folder . Go 
to Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site definition, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a 
New Site.”

Building a contact form
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 13
The basics of HTML forms
HTML forms are commonly used for questionnaires, hotel reservations, order forms, data 
entry, and a variety of other applications. Users provide information by entering text, selecting 
menu items, and so on, and then submit that information to you through a server.
Figure 13-1 shows the simple form you will be creating that includes labels, radio buttons, and 
push buttons (used to reset the form or submit it):
Figure 13-1: Forms are a great choice when you want to gather information from your audience.
How forms work
An HTML form is a section of a document that often contains content such as text or images, 
markup, special elements called controls (checkboxes, radio buttons, and menus, among 
others), and labels on those controls. A form is completed when a user modifies its controls (by 
entering text and selecting menu items), and submits the form to an agent for processing.
When you add form controls in Dreamweaver, you are essentially creating the front-end of the 
form. A user can add all the data required on the page, but this data needs to saved and processed 
at a specific location when the user presses the Submit button. It’s important to understand that 
Dreamweaver does not provide this location for you. You will need to work with your hosting 
provider or another service in order to have a system for accepting user data and then processing 
it in some way. You will learn more about this process a bit later in the lesson.
Building a contact form
In this lesson, you’ll build a contact form for OrganicUtopia. This form allows users to be 
added to a mailing list for news of sales and special events, and it provides the site owners with 
relevant data, such as name, e-mail, and which information they would like to receive.

Lesson 13
357
Lesson 13: Building Web Forms
Building a contact form
Inserting the <form> tag
The first step in building a form in Dreamweaver is to add a form element, which serves as 
a container for the form fields you’ll be adding to it. In hand-coded HTML, you do this by 
inserting the <form> tag into your code. In the Design view, you can add a form element 
using the Form button.
Follow these steps to insert a <form> tag
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose File > Open. When the Open dialog box appears, navigate to the dw13lessons 
folder. Select the formbase.html file and press Open. We have added most of the form 
content for you, but you will have to remove the placeholder text and add the proper form 
controls.
2.	 In the Design view, place an insertion cursor where you want your form to appear. 
Because this is an existing page, click with your mouse in the white area immediately to 
the left of the word Name as seen in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2: Insert your cursor before the Name text field label.
3.	 In the Insert panel on the right side of your screen, choose the Forms category from the 
drop-down menu to display options for adding form elements to a page.
4.	 From the Forms category of the Insert panel, select the Form element ( ) as seen in 
Figure 13-3.
Figure 13-3: Options for adding form  
elements to a page are found in the Forms  
category of the Insert panel.

Building a contact form
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 13
5.	 You should now see a red outline on your page. This is how a form is displayed in the 
Design view. If you don’t see this outline, choose View > Visual Aids > Invisible Elements 
to turn on the form element’s visibility as seen in Figure 13-4.
Figure 13-4: A dotted red outline on your page indicates a placed form element.
Now you’ll take a look at the code generated by the steps you just completed in the Design 
view. This is for educational purposes to help you understand the foundations of how 
forms work.
6.	 In the Document toolbar just above your document window, click the Code view button 
to switch to your page’s HTML code view.
7.	 In line 214 of your code, you should see the newly added <form> element (Figure 13-5). 
Take note of the default attributes and values (ID="form1" name="form1" 
method="post" action=""). You’ll learn more about these attributes shortly. For now, 
simply note that these were created.
Figure 13-5: In HTML code, a form element is added using the <form> tag.
Since this form element is currently empty, you’ll need to move the existing content 
(Name, Address, and so on) from the current location on the page to the form element you 
just created. 
8.	 In the Document toolbar just above your document window, click the Design view button 
to switch to your page’s visual layout view.
9.	 Starting with the text labeled Name, click and drag downward to select all the text below 
your form element.
10.	 Choose Edit > Cut to copy the text to your clipboard and remove it from its current 
location on the page.
11.	 Click inside the red outline that represents your form element to place an insertion cursor 
there. 
12.	 Choose Edit > Paste to place the text from the clipboard into your form element.

Lesson 13
359
Lesson 13: Building Web Forms
Building a contact form
All the text for your element labels is now located inside the form element seen here in 
Figure 13-6.
Figure 13-6: Cut and paste existing content from your page into the form element.
Setting form properties
As indicated previously, the <form> tag includes four different attributes and values by default. 
These attributes are listed as ID, name, method, and action, and they represent the HTML 
form element’s properties. The default values for these attributes are not necessarily ideal, so 
you’ll modify them. 
Follow these steps to set form properties
Step-by-Step
1.	 Make sure the form element you added in the previous exercise is selected by clicking on 
the edge of its red outline. A form field element must be selected before you modify its 
properties.
2.	 In the Property Inspector at the bottom of your document window, you now have access 
to some of the properties associated with the <form> tag, seen her iin Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-7: The fields in the Property Inspector reflect properties found inside the <form> tag in HTML code.
The Form ID makes it possible to identify and control the form with a script, as well as to 
style the form with CSS. It is also very important for form validation, which is discussed 
later in this lesson.
Take Note...
A form ID is the same ID attribute you have been using to style divs. This form, for example, 
would have the ID #form1 by default, which is not a useful name.

Building a contact form

Lesson 13
3.	 In the Form ID text field, type the name contact. Press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS).
The Action field allows you to specify the script, for example, a Common Gateway Interface 
(CGI) script or a PHP page, that processes the user’s form data. You can type the path to this 
file, or use the Browse button to navigate to the desired file. In most cases, you’ll need to get 
this information from your system Administrator or hosting provider.
4.	 Because you have not yet defined the processing method for this form, leave the Action 
text field blank. 
5.	 For method, make sure the POST method for this exercise is selected, which it likely is by 
default.
The Method menu
The Method drop-down menu is where you choose the method used to transmit the data 
to a server. The Method drop-down menu includes the following choices:
Default uses the browser’s default setting to submit the form data to a server. Most 
browsers use the GET method by default.
GET includes the form data as part of the URL of the request to the server. GET has a 
length limitation of 8,192 characters in the URL and is less commonly used to send long 
forms than the POST method.
POST is similar to GET, but it embeds the form data in the header of the server request 
instead of in the URL. Although the POST method is the most commonly used, be 
aware that pages sent by this method cannot be bookmarked and are not encrypted for 
security purposes.
6.	 Choose application/x-www-form-urlencoded from the Enctype drop-down menu 
(Figure 13-8). The Enctype field defines the encoding type of the data being submitted 
to a server. Application/x-www-form-urlencoded is used in most situations, unless you’re 
asking the user to upload a file, in which case you would choose multipart/form-data.
Take Note...
The optional Target property specifies the window or frame in which to display the data that is 
returned. The target value is included in the <form> tag only when you choose to specify it.
Figure 13-8: Form properties are set in the Property Inspector.
Now that you’ve defined the properties of the form, you’ll use options in the Insert panel’s 
Forms section to add elements to the form.

Adding form elements
Adding form elements
A Dreamweaver form is not a working form until you add the elements, or fields, that allow 
the user to provide information to you. Thankfully, the Forms category in the Insert panel 
(Figure 13-9) contains everything you need to insert any kind of form field into your page.
Figure 13-9: The Forms category in the  
Insert panel contains everything you need  
to add interactive fields to your form.
Common form elements
Of the many form elements you can add using the Insert toolbar, these are the most 
commonly used ones:
Text fields accept alphanumeric text entries, in single- or multiple-line formats, or in a 
password (bulleted) format.
Checkboxes allow users to make as many choices as they want from a list of options.
Radio buttons allow only mutually exclusive choices in that selecting one radio button 
deselects all others in the group.
List menus permit the selection of single or multiple items from a scrolling list, whereas 
Jump menus allow you to set each option from a scrolling list to link to a document or 
file.
Buttons perform actions when clicked. You can assign the default Submit or Reset 
action to buttons, or define other processing tasks in a script.
A good way to understand all the options available in Dreamweaver for adding elements 
to a form is to add them to the form you created earlier.

Lesson 13
Adding text fields
The simplest and most common type of form field is the text field. Users can enter anything, 
from their name, to their credit card number, to their dog’s name, into a text field. You control 
the formatting of their responses using the Property Inspector.
Follow these steps to add a text field to a form
Step-by-Step
1.	 Within your form, click immediately to the right of the word Name.
2.	 Press the Text Field button ( ) in the Insert panel. The Input Tag Accessibility Attributes 
dialog box opens (Figure 13-10), allowing you to set attributes to make your form field 
more accessible for users as well as whomever is receiving the data after submission.
Figure 13-10: Make your form more accessible by changing your  
settings here.
3.	 In the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, specify the following:
In the ID section, type Mailing_list_name.
In the Style section, choose No label tag. The label element in a form provides additional 
usability for the user. You will take a look at how to use the label tag shortly.
4.	 Press OK. A new text field appears within the form outline on your page as seen here in 
Figure 13-11.
Figure 13-11: The settings you entered define the look of the Name  
text field as it’s added to your form.

Lesson 13

5.	 If it’s not already selected, select the text field by clicking on it, and notice the options that 
are available in the Property Inspector. 
6.	 Type 55 in the Char Width text field to set the text input area to a width of 55 characters.
7.	 Type 30 in the Max Chars text field to set the maximum number of characters that can 
be entered. For example, if this were a telephone number field, you probably would have 
limited it to ten characters.
8.	 Choose Single Line from the Type options. Choosing the Password option would cause 
the user’s entry to appear as black dots, even though the correct value would be submitted 
to the server. The Multi-line option is discussed later, in the “Adding a text area” section.
9.	 Repeat steps 1 to 9 to add Address and City/State/Zip text fields beneath the Name field. 
When creating the Address text field, give it the ID Mailing_list_address and give 
the last text field the ID Mailing_list_city_state_zip. When naming form elements, 
you should stay away from using spaces between words. It is better to use underscores or 
hyphens instead.
10.	 Choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the dw13lessons folder and 
type organicform.html into the Name text field. Click Save.
Now preview the open page in a browser by pressing the Preview/Debug in browser 
button on the Document toolbar. Your form should look like Figure 13-12:
Figure 13-12: This is what your form should look like with text fields added.
11.	 Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
Adding checkboxes
Checkboxes are another valuable tool in your form control toolkit. They’re valuable when you 
want to get specific responses from your users and you don’t want to give them the opportunity 
to enter incorrect information into text fields. Again, you control the formatting of their 
responses using the Property Inspector. In this exercise, you will take a look at the use of form 
labels as well as the importance of setting the names of your form elements.
Follow these steps to add checkboxes to a form
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click and drag to select both the word Sales and the (Checkbox) placeholder text. Press 
Delete to remove it from your form and place an insertion cursor.
2.	 Click on the Checkbox element (
) in the Insert panel. The Input Tag Accessibility 
Attributes dialog box opens.
3.	 In the Input Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, type Sales for ID, then type Sales for 
the Label. Choose the Wrap with label tag and make sure that Before form item is selected 
for the Position. The label tag is an optional element that adds an extra level of usability to 
your checkboxes. Users will now be able to click on the text (in addition to the checkbox) 
in order to make their selection. The Before and After form item options allow you to 
change the position of the checkbox.
4.	 Press OK. A new checkbox appears within the form outline on your page.

5.	 If it’s not already selected, click to select the checkbox, and notice the options that become 
available in the Property Inspector (Figure 13-13).
Figure 13-13: Settings that are specific to the checkbox you’ve just added to your form appear in the Property Inspector.
6.	 In the Checkbox name text field on the left side of the Property Inspector, type Receive_
Info and press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS). It is important to understand what 
you are changing here. The name of the checkbox is different from the ID of a checkbox. 
An ID is used to style an element, the name is what gets passed when the user presses 
submit. The problem is that Dreamweaver automatically sets the name based on what you 
enter for ID back in the Input Tag dialog box, however this is not always a good choice. 
In the case of checkboxes, you want all the checkboxes to have the same name. To do this 
you will need to override Dreamweaver’s default naming to make this field accessible for 
scripting and validation.
7.	 Type Sales in the Checked value text field to define the data that’s passed to the server 
when the user checks this checkbox.
8.	 In the Initial State section, the value Unchecked should be selected; if it is not, do so now. 
This setting defines how the checkbox appears when the page is first loaded.
9.	 Next, select the word Events and the placeholder (Checkbox) text and delete them. Click 
on the Checkbox element in the Insert panel. In the Input Tag box, type Events and for 
Label, type Events. Additionally, be sure that Before form item is selected for the Position 
and click OK.
10.	 Click on the checkbox and change the checkbox name to Receive_Info. Because this 
name is the same as the first checkbox, users will be able to check both and have the values 
passed. In the Checked Value text field, type Events and press Enter or Return.
11.	 Repeat steps 9 and 10 with different values for the ID and Label to add a third checkbox 
for Charity Drives. Again, be sure to rename the checkbox, Receive_Info.
Now, preview the open page in a browser. Your form should look like figure 13-14:
Figure 13-14: Your form, with checkboxes inserted, should look like this.
12.	 With the page open in the browser, click the text next to the checkboxes; notice that this 
action selects the box. This is a function of the label tag. Try clicking on the text of your Name 
and Address text fields. They do not have the same behavior because they do not have labels.
Labels improve accessibility for all users, in particular for those who may be using screen 
readers or other devices.
13.	 Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver.

Lesson 13: Building Web Forms
Adding form elements
Adding radio buttons
When you add radio buttons to your form, you encounter the same settings in the Property 
Inspector as you do when you add checkboxes. The only difference between checkboxes 
and radio buttons is that from a group of radio buttons, only a single option can be selected. 
Checkboxes allow the selection of multiple options.
To make two or more individual radio buttons mutually exclusive, you select two or more 
radio buttons and give them the same name in the Property Inspector.
Creating a group of radio buttons by adding buttons one by one is often more time-consuming 
than it’s worth. Thankfully, Dreamweaver offers a more efficient method for creating a list of 
mutually exclusive options: the radio group.
Adding radio groups
The Radio Group element in the Insert toolbar provides a quick and easy way to add a list of 
radio buttons to your form. The same rules regarding naming and values apply, but the Radio 
Group dialog box allows you to include several entries in a group at once.
Follow these steps to add radio groups to a form
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click and drag to select the three (Radio Button) placeholders and their labels (Yes, No, 
and Can’t Remember). Press Delete to remove them from your form. You’ll create your 
own labels for this group.
2.	 Click on the Radio Group button in the Insert panel. The Radio Group dialog box opens 
(Figure 13-15), and offers several property options.
Figure 13-15: Set properties for your radio group in the Radio Group dialog box.
3.	 In the Name text field of the Radio Group dialog box, type Membership Status to give 
the group a name that associates all the radio buttons together.
You will now create a unique label for each button.
4.	 Click on the first entry in the Label column and type Member. 
5.	 In the Value column of the Radio buttons section, you assign a value to each button to be 
passed back to the server. Click on the first entry in this column and type member. This 
returns a value of member when the user clicks on the Member radio button.
6.	 Make sure Line breaks (<br> tags) is selected in the Layout using section at the bottom of 
the dialog box. This will place a hard return after each radio button.
7.	 Repeat steps 4 to 6, but this time create a label called Non-Member and a value of 
nonmember.

8.	 Click OK. Choose File > Save, and then preview the open page in a browser. Click on 
each of the two radio buttons and note that only one radio button can ever be selected 
(Figure 13-16). This is a function of a radio button group: for cases where you want more 
than one option to be selected and returned, you could use a checkbox.
Figure 13-16: After adding the radio group, your form should look like this.
9.	 Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver.
Take Note...
Checkboxes can also be added as groups using the Checkbox Group option in the Insert 
panel.
Adding lists and menus
Lists and menus show choices within a list that permits users to choose single or multiple 
options. The List option displays as a scrolling list, and the Menu option displays as a drop-
down menu. As is the case with most form fields, you set the properties for lists and menus in 
the Property Inspector.
Follow these steps to add lists and menus to a form
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click and drag to select the placeholder text—(List) Store Events, Planting Season, 
Anything—that follows your radio group. Press Delete to remove it from your form. 
You’ll create your own labels for this list.
2.	 Press the Select (List/Menu) button ( ) in the Insert panel. The Input Tag Accessibility 
Attributes dialog box opens. 
3.	 Type Volunteer in the ID text field and leave the additional settings as is, then press OK.

settings become available on the right side of the Property Inspector.
6.	 Type 3 in the Height text field to set the number of items to be visible at any given time in 
the scrolling list.
7.	 Click in the checkbox to the right of the Selections option to allow multiple selections. 
With this feature activated, users can choose more than one option from your list at a 
time.
8.	 Click on the List Values button to enter items for your scrolling list. The structure of the List 
Values dialog box is identical to that of the Radio Group dialog box. Type Store Events as 
your first Item Label and store_events for the first value to be returned. 
Now you will add two more items to the list.
9.	 Click the Plus button (+) in the left corner of the List Values window, and type 
Planting Season as the second Item Label. Then click under the Events value and type 
plantingseason. Click the Plus button (+) again. Type Anything as the third Item Label, 
and, finally, click under the Planting value and type anyevent as seen in Figure 13-18. 
Click OK.

10.	 Choose File > Save to save your work. Preview your page in the browser and click one of 
the labels to see how it is selected. Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver.
Adding a text area
Sometimes within a Dreamweaver form, you want to have a field that simply provides an open 
area into which users can enter text. For this form, you’ll add a textarea element to provide a 
region for users to type in their comments about the site.
Follow these steps to add a text area to a form
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click and drag to select the placeholder text, (Comments), and retype it without the 
parentheses, to use as a label for this field.
2.	 Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to move your cursor to the next line.
3.	 Click on the Textarea element (
) in the Insert panel. The Input Tag Accessibility 
Attributes dialog box opens.
4.	 In the ID text field, type Comments. In the Style section, select Wrap with label tag.
5.	 Click OK. A new text area appears within the form outline on your page.
6.	 Click the text area, and notice the options that are now available in the Property Inspector.
7.	 Type 40 in the Char width text field to set the text input area to a width of 40 characters.
8.	 Leave the Num lines text field set to 5, and leave Type set to Multi line.

Adding a File Upload field
If you want users to be able to upload a file to your server—for example, a photo for ID 
purposes—you’ll want to add a File Upload field.
Follow these steps to add a file upload field
Step-by-Step
1.	 Close the browser and return to organicform.html in Dreamweaver. Click and drag to 
select (Upload), and delete it to place an insertion cursor next to your label.
2.	 Click on the File Field button (
) in the Insert panel. The Input Tag Accessibility 
Attributes dialog box opens.
3.	 In the Input Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box, type filefield for the ID. Additionally, 
make sure the Wrap with label tag field is selected.
4.	 Click OK. A new file field, with the Browse button included, appears within the form 
outline on your page.
5.	 Click to select the file field, and notice the options that become available in the Property 
Inspector.
6.	 Type 30 in the Char width text field to set the text input area to a width of 30 characters.
7.	 Type 30 in the Max chars text field as seen in Figure 13-20 to set the maximum number 
of filename characters that can be entered.

8.	 The Class drop-down menu allows you to apply CSS to style this form field. Using CSS to 
style form fields is discussed in more detail later in this lesson.
You are now finished with the file field section of your form. Users can now either enter 
the desired file name or click Browse to navigate to it.
Take Note...
For the file field element to actually upload a user’s file to your server, you’ll need to ask your 
server Administrator how the server is configured to accept files.

Lesson 13
Creating Submit and Reset buttons
As you might expect, none of the field elements you’ve been adding to your form do any good 
if the user doesn’t have a way to send the information to you. Buttons provide the means for 
the either to commit an action. A submit button provides the means for a user to submit 
form data and a reset button provides the means for a user to reset the fields and start the 
form over.
Follow these steps to create Submit and Reset Buttons on a form
Step-by-Step
1.	 Place your cursor after the Upload field, then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) 
to specify where you want your button(s) to appear.
2.	 Click on the Button element (
) in the Forms category of the Insert panel. The Input Tag 
Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens.
3.	 In the dialog box, specify the following:
In the ID section, type Submit.
In the Style section, choose No label tag.
4.	 Click OK. A new button, labeled Submit by default, appears within the form outline on 
your page.
5.	 If it’s not already selected, click to select the button, and notice the options that are now 
available in the Property Inspector (Figure 13-22).
Figure 13-22: Button properties are set in the Property Inspector.
6.	 The word Submit is displayed in the Value field as well. You could change this value to a 
more user-friendly name if you wanted such as Send, however for now you’ll leave it as is.
7.	 The three options in the Action section specify the action carried out when the user clicks 
this button. Select the Submit form radio button in the Actions section. Submit and Reset 
form are self-explanatory, but the None option builds a generic button that you can set to 
trigger a JavaScript behavior, which is discussed later in this lesson.
8.	 The Class drop-down menu allows you to apply CSS to style this form field—another 
technique that is covered later in the lesson.
9.	 Repeat steps 1 to 9 to add Reset and Validate buttons next to the Submit button. Choose 
Reset from the Action section in the Property Inspector for the Reset button, and None 
for the Validate button. Additionally, you will need to type Validate in the Value field to 
change the default value as seen in Figure 13-23. 
Figure 13-23: The Submit, Reset, and Validate button are  
now placed in the form.

Lesson 13: Building Web Forms
Styling forms with CSS
Now that you’ve finished adding the necessary form fields to your Contact Form page, 
you’ll add style to the form and its elements, using CSS.
Styling forms with CSS
In Lesson 4, “Styling Your Pages with CSS,” you explored the many ways you can use CSS to 
format text and position content on an HTML page in Dreamweaver. However, the usefulness 
of CSS is not limited to static page content. Dynamic content, such as form fields, can also be 
successfully and creatively styled using CSS.
Attaching external styles
This exercise assumes you have already learned some of the basics of working with styles 
covered in previous lessons. You will now focus on applying some existing styles to the form 
elements that you’ve added in this lesson. The styles you apply have been created for you, but 
you must attach them to your form page in order to access them.
Follow these steps to attach an external style sheet
Step-by-Step
1.	 If your CSS Styles panel is not currently open, open it now by choosing Window > CSS 
Styles.
2.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click on the Attach Style Sheet button ( ) in the lower-right 
corner of the panel. The Attach External Style Sheet dialog box opens (Figure 13-24).
Figure 13-24: Select the CSS file you want to attach using The Attach External  
Style Sheet dialog box.
3.	 Next to the File/URL field, click the Browse button and select formstyles.css from the 
dw13lessons folder. Press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS) to exit the Select Style Sheet 
File dialog box. 
4.	 In the Attach External Style Sheet dialog box, click the Link radio button to create a link 
<href> tag in the code for this page, and reference the location of the published style 
sheet. Most major web browsers support the link method.
5.	 In the Media drop-down menu, you can define the target medium for your style sheet. For 
this exercise, leave this setting at its default, which is blank.
Take Note...
For more information on media-dependent style sheets, see the World Wide Web Consortium 
(W3C) website at W3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html.
6.	 Press OK to attach the style sheet to this document.

Styling forms with CSS
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
372
Lesson 13
Setting a background color
Once the formstyles.css style sheet is attached, the backgrounds of your form fields change 
to a light blue color as seen in Figure 13-25. This happens because formstyles.css contains a 
tag selector rule, which instructs the <form> tag you added earlier in the lesson to include 
a background color. The rule redefines the <form> tag, so the color is applied only to the 
background of the form fields themselves, and not to the entire body of the page.
Figure 13-25: The formstyles CSS contains a rule that specifies a background color.
A major benefit of using CSS is that once you complete the initial styling, you can revisit the 
CSS file and change the included style rules. Because the blue background doesn’t fit in with 
the color scheme of your site, you’ll edit the form rule to change the background to a light gray.
Follow these steps to set a background color
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the All button (if necessary) to show all styles attached to 
this document. Locate formstyles.css in the list of All Rules, and expand it by clicking 
on the Plus button (+) (Windows) or triangle button ( ) (Mac OS) to the left side. (You 
can collapse the <style> tag and the SpryMenuGarHorizontal.css style sheet to make 
more room in the panel.)

2.	 From the list of style rules included within formstyles.css, click on the input rule to 
select it for editing as seen in Figure 13-26.
Figure 13-26: Selecting the input style in  
your formstyles.css style sheet reveals the  
style being used.
3.	 Double-click the input style. The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
4.	 Select the Background category to the left, and, in the Background color text field to the 
right, type the hexadecimal code #d7d7d7, to replace the current color (Figure 13-27).
Figure 13-27: You’ve successfully changed the background color of your form fields by editing an attached CSS.
5.	 To preview the change to the background color, press Apply. Press OK.
You’ve just used a tag selector CSS rule to change the background color of your form. 
Next, you’ll use a class style to change the appearance of the labels on your form fields.

Lesson 13
Styling form elements
You may have noticed another CSS rule included in formstyles.css along with the <form> 
definition. It’s a class style called .labels, and it contains properties that change the font, 
color, and weight of your form field labels.
Follow these steps to style form elements
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the .labels CSS rule to select it; in the bottom half of the 
panel, you can see the properties currently set for the class (Figure 13-28).
The font-family has been changed to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif.
The font-weight is set to bolder.
The color has been set to a hexadecimal notation of #9FCC41, or green.
Figure 13-28: The .labels rule can also  
be edited in the CSS Styles panel.
You’ll now apply this style.
2.	 In the document window, click anywhere within the Name label, which precedes the first 
text field in your form.
3.	 In the Property Inspector, click the HTML button if necessary; click the Class menu and 
choose labels from the list. Because the Name, Address, and City/State/Zip are all within 
the same paragraph, the style will be applied, making them all green (Figure 13-29). 
Figure 13-29: The .labels class applied to your form.
These are just a few of the ways you can use CSS to style form elements. Experiment further 
with different properties to make your form more visually pleasing.

Lesson 13

Lesson 13: Building Web Forms
Adding form validation
Form processing and validation
As attractive as CSS styling can make your form in Dreamweaver, you can’t collect form data 
without using a server-side script or application (for example, CGI, PHP, ASP) to process the data. 
CGI scripts are perhaps the oldest method of server-side scripting used to process form data. 
Several websites offer free CGI scripts that you can use. The hosting company for your website 
may also provide CGI scripts that perform many common tasks, such as collecting e-mail 
addresses or allowing visitors to send you comments through a web form. Other methods 
include the use of other scripting languages, such as PHP, ASP, and others. It is beyond the 
scope of this book to cover all the various ways to process form data.
It’s also worth noting that form validation, a method for ensuring that the user has 
entered the correct type of data in the form’s fields, also requires scripting to work correctly. 
Thankfully, Dreamweaver is capable of adding JavaScript code that checks the contents of 
specified text fields. This code is added through the use of the Validate Form behavior.
Adding form validation
The Validate Form behavior provides checks and balances for users when they complete forms 
on your site. You can make certain fields required, make sure a user has entered a value in a 
required field, or make sure a user has entered the correct type of information in a field. You 
can run validation on all fields in a form, or on individual fields contained in that form.
The first step, however, is to get to know the Behaviors panel.
A look at the Behaviors panel
Generally speaking, the Behaviors panel provides a means for you to add JavaScript code to 
your page without actually having to type in the code. The code it inserts adds interactivity to 
your site, and is usually triggered by some user action. For example, when the user clicks on 
or hovers over a link, the behavior performs a task. Behaviors are hardly limited to use with 
forms, as they’re commonly used to add rollovers, open new windows, check for plug-ins, and 
add navigation elements, among other functions.
Specifically, you use the Behaviors panel to add, modify, and remove behaviors. Because you can 
apply multiple behaviors to the same object, you can also reorder them in the Behaviors panel.

Adding form validation

376
Lesson 13
Follow these steps to use the Behaviors panel
Step-by-Step
1.	 Access the Behaviors panel by choosing Window > Behaviors. It docks with the Tag 
Inspector panel on the right side of your screen. If necessary, expand the panel grouping 
and click on the Behaviors tab to bring it to the front as seen in Figure 13-30.
Figure 13-30: The Behaviors panel.
2.	 In the document window, click the Validate button you created earlier. You need to 
attach a behavior to objects on your page. For this exercise, the object you need to attach a 
behavior to is the Validate button.
3.	 Click the Plus button (+) at the top of the Behaviors panel to see the list of available 
options for the selected object (Figure 13-31). In this case, the menu displays options 
associated with a button element. If an option is grayed out, that action is not available for 
the selected object.
Figure 13-31: The list of available behaviors for your selected  
button element.
4.	 Select the Popup Message action. The Popup Message dialog box appears.

5.	 Type Validate this form! into the Message text field as seen in Figure 13-32, and click OK.
Figure 13-32: Enter text into the Popup Message dialog box to have it appear on  
the screen.
The behavior is set, but it needs an event, or trigger.
Setting an event or trigger
An event (or trigger) is generally a specific user action needed for the Popup Window (or 
other behaviors) to work. In this case, you’ll set the window to appear when the user clicks the 
Validate button.
Follow these steps to set an event or trigger
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the top-left corner of the Behaviors panel, click on the Show All Events button ( ). The 
Show All Events button provides a complete list of all possible triggers for this behavior 
(Figure 13-33).
Figure 13-33: There are a number of  
choices for the event that triggers your  
specific behavior.
In this case, the default option “onClick” is the correct choice.
2.	 Choose File > Save All and preview your page in a browser.

Validating form fields

3.	 Press on the Validate button at the bottom of your form. The pop-up message you set 
earlier appears (Figure 13-34).
Figure 13-34: Use this feature to warn  
your viewers, or to guide them in a  
certain direction.
Take Note...
Depending on the security configurations of your browser, you may be prompted to allow blocked 
content. If you’d like to change your preferences to avoid conflicts with scripts created in the 
Behaviors panel, refer to your browser’s documentation for instructions on changing the default 
settings.
4.	 Press OK to close the message, and close your browser window and return to 
Dreamweaver.
To further explore the Behaviors panel and its features, you’ll add a Form Validation 
behavior to the same button.
Validating form fields
The Validate Form action allows you to prevent the submission of a form unless a certain field 
(or fields) is filled in by the user. You’ll apply this action to the Validate button you created.
Follow these steps to validate form fields
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the document window, select the Validate button at the bottom of your form. The 
Behaviors panel should display the Popup Message action you added in the last exercise.
2.	 At the top of the Behaviors panel, click the Plus button (+), and select Validate Form from 
the drop-down menu that appears. The Validate Form dialog box opens. Dreamweaver 
automatically identifies the fields you have used on the page and lists them in the fields 
section.
3.	 Choose “Mailing_list_name,” the first entry in the Fields list. Click the Required 
checkbox to require data entry into this field before the user can submit the form.

Lesson 13
379
Lesson 13: Building Web Forms
Validating form fields
4.	 Click the Anything radio button so the field accepts any alphanumeric entry as seen in 
Figure 13-35. If you want to require that only numerical data be entered, you would select 
the Number radio button. If you want to check for an @ symbol within the entered data, 
you would click the Email address radio button. Finally, if you want to check for a number 
within a specific range, you could enter that range in the Number from and to fields.
Figure 13-35: Specify which form elements get validated, and what is accepted.
5.	 Click OK to close the Validate Form dialog box.
6.	 Choose File > Save, then preview the form page in your browser. Leave the Name field 
blank, and click on the Validate button at the bottom of your form.
Unfortunately, the Popup Message behavior you added earlier runs before the Validate 
Form behavior, requiring you to close the Popup Message window to see the results of 
your validation. After you dismiss the Popup Message you will see the error message 
stating that the Mailing list name is required. 
This means you have just a little more work to do; you’ll now adjust the Validate Form 
behavior to correct these errors.

Lesson 13
Changing a form field’s behavior order
To keep the pop-up message from appearing before the results of your validation, you’ll need 
to change the Validate Form behavior’s position in the behavior order, delete it, and reapply it 
to the correct button.
Follow these steps to change a form field’s behavior order
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Dreamweaver document window, click on the Validate button to select it. 
2.	 Click the Show Set Events button in the Behaviors panel to toggle over to this view (if 
necessary). You will now see your two actions, Popup Message and Validate Form, which 
share the same event, or trigger (Figure 13-36).
Figure 13-36: Use the Behaviors panel  
to reorder behaviors and make them  
behave differently for the viewer.
3.	 Click on the Validate Form behavior to select it, and click the up arrow at the top of the 
panel to move it to a position above the Popup Message behavior. Although this makes 
the Validate Form action run first, the pop-up message still appears after the validation 
window is closed. It actually makes more sense not to have the Validate Form behavior 
attached to the Validate button at all. You will now remove this behavior and attach it to 
the Submit button instead.
4.	 Click on the Minus button (–) to delete it from the behaviors associated with the Validate 
button.
5.	 Click on the Submit button at the bottom of your form to select it. Repeat steps 2-4 in the 
preceding exercise to add the validation action to the Submit button.
Now it’s time to see the fruits of your labor.

Skill Summary
Verifying field contents
Now that you’ve adjusted the Validate Form behavior, you’ll need to make sure the form 
functions as you expect it to.
Follow these steps to change field contents
Step-by-Step
1.	 Preview the open page in your browser, and click on the Validate button. This should now 
display only the pop-up message. Close it.
2.	 Click on the Submit button. Even though the data is not actually submitted (for lack 
of a CGI script), the Validate Form warns you that required fields have not been filled 
(Figure 13-37).

functions as you originally intended, thanks  
to some editing in the Behaviors panel.
You’ve successfully added validation to your form, and completed this lesson in the

Examining more Behaviors
Project 13-1
Behaviors are something that can really enhance the interactivity of your webpage for various 
reasons. Let’s add another behavior, but don’t forget to go back in there and keep trying out 
different options. Another way to find out more about Behaviors is to select Help from the 
panel flyout menu. 
1.	 Choose File > New > Blank Page > HTML > None to create a new empty webpage.
2.	 Save the page as behavior.html.
3.	 Choose Window > Behaviors.
4.	 Click and hold the Add Behavior button and select Go To URL.
5.	 In the URL field, type: http://www.adobe.com.
6.	 Click OK and save the file. Once saved, preview in a browser to see what happens. Due to 
the onLoad trigger, your browser should jump to the Adobe website as you as you preview 
the page.
7.	 Leave the file open for the next exercise below.
Examining the Code
Project 13-2
Many behaviors are based on Javascript. When you add a behavior, the code is automatically 
added in the background. It’s good to get familiar with what Javascript looks like in context to 
the other code you’ve been working with such as HTML and CSS. You’ll take a look at and 
learn to identify Javascript below. 
1.	 Continue with the page from above.
2.	 Choose the Code view. 
3.	 Look for the line that starts <script type="text/javascript"> and then the end tag 
</script>. Everything in between is the Javascript from the behavior you created above.

each to something unique. 
4.	 Test in a browser. 
What’s going on in the Background
Project 13-4
The form itself seems simple enough compared to what is actually processing the form in the 
background. Many form driven functions require security, such as a form that accepts credit 
card information. Understanding the security is an important aspect; CGI script is one of the 
types of code that is often used when securing form information.

and information more visually interesting. In order to do this easily, you can use 
Dreamweaver’s Spry objects to create interactive user interface elements, such as 
accordion-style displays, customizable menu bars, and much more.
Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. See 
“Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw14lessons folder in this lesson. Make sure that 
you have loaded the dwlessons folder onto your hard drive. See “Loading lesson files” in the 
Starting Up section of this book.
Before you begin, you need to create site settings that point to the dw14lessons folder. Go to 
Site > New Site, or, for details on creating a site, refer to Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site.”
Introducing the Spry Widgets
Introduced in Dreamweaver CS3, Spry Widgets give you the ability to create powerful, 
interactive navigation and user interface elements with easy-to-use insert bar objects. Spry 
Widgets include drop-down and accordion menus, expanding panels, and tabbed containers, 
all of which harness the power of CSS for easy customization and styling to match any project. 
They are a great way to enhance navigation, organize content, and add dynamic style to your 
web pages.

Lesson 14
In addition, the Spry framework offers a set of data elements and display items that allow you to 
create dynamic page content that can read from an XML file. You can find the Spry Widgets 
in their own category on the Insert panel, and within the Layout category as well.
The Spry framework for AJAX
Developed by Adobe, Spry Framework is a JavaScript library and features data-driven and 
interface elements that can be easily added to a page and customized. Many of these elements 
can incorporate real-time data from XML or HTML files. These can be integrated into your 
existing pages to add features not available with HTML alone.
What is AJAX?
AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and represents a combination of 
technologies: JavaScript, XML, and DHTML (more commonly referred to as DOM Scripting). 
AJAX is used to develop what is sometimes referred to as Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). 
RIAs are a great example of how the Web continues to evolve and progress beyond the static 
web page. RIAs exchange data behind the scenes and can easily update the appearance and 
display of the web page without the need to reload the page over and over again.
A great example of an RIA is Google’s Gmail, which has the ability to update messages, create 
online chats, and retrieve address book contacts in real-time without the need to go to another 
page or even reload the existing one. Here, AJAX is used to send and retrieve XML-based data 
behind the scenes and updates the appearance and information on the page in real-time.
A look at the project
In this lesson, you’ll be completing the OrganicUtopia home page by using and customizing 
different Spry Widgets. Before you get started, take a look at the completed version of the page 
to get an idea of what you’ll be working toward.
If you haven’t already created a site definition for this lesson in Dreamweaver, follow the 
instructions in Lesson 2, “Setting Up a New Site,” to do so before moving ahead.
Follow these steps to view the finished project
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, locate the index_done.html page, and double-click it to open it.
2.	 To view the Spry Widgets in action, choose File > Preview in Browser, and select a 
browser to preview the page. Depending on which browser you are using, you may see a 
message indicating that scripts are being blocked. Press the Allow Blocked Content button 
to allow the scripts to be run.

The Spry Menu bar
3.	 With the page open in a browser, move over the Navigation bar at the top. Notice 
that hovering over each menu item expands it to reveal more menu items as seen in 
Figure 14-1. 
Figure 4-1: The completed Spry page contains numerous interactive elements.
4.	 On the right, click on the accordion-style menu to expand and contract different 
categories of products. 
5.	 In the center of the page, locate the three tabs labeled featured, what’s new, and 
testimonials. Click on each one to reveal a different content area—notice that the page 
doesn’t refresh when you do this.
6.	 In the lower-right corner, click the Contact Us bar to reveal a signup box.
7.	 Close the browser and return to Dreamweaver. Then, choose File > Close to close the 
current file.
The Spry Menu bar
In Lesson 6, “Advanced Page Layout,” you created your navigation bar from scratch using an 
HTML list styled with CSS. However, imagine that you are asked to create a more interactive 
menu, one which activates a drop-down menu of the sub-categories of your site. Although this 
is possible to do using CSS with perhaps some help from JavaScript, it is not necessarily easy or 
fast. The Spry Menu bar creates a multi-tiered horizontal or vertical menu that can be easily 
added as a master navigation element in your page(s). These menus are easy to add, and the 
Spry Menu bar is a great alternative.
The Spry Menu bar can be added from the Insert panel and customized using the Property 
Inspector and CSS Styles panel.

Lesson 14
Follow these steps to add the Spry Menu bar
Step-by-Step
1.	 From the Files panel, locate and open the index_start.html file for editing. 
2.	 Choose File > Save As, and save the page as index_work.html into your site’s root folder. 
Take Note...
If you can’t locate your current site folder, click the Site Root button at the bottom of the Save 
As dialog box to automatically locate and set it as your save location.
3.	 At the top of the page, locate the div with the placeholder text that reads {Menu Bar Here} 
and select the text as seen in Figure 14-2. 
Figure 14-2: Locate the placeholder text where the menu bar will go.
Now, delete the text, and be sure to leave your cursor in its place.
4.	 Open the Insert panel if necessary, and then select the Spry category from the drop-down 
menu at the top to display the Spry data objects and widgets.
5.	 Click the Spry Menu bar icon to insert a new menu bar at your cursor position. Choose 
Horizontal from the dialog box that appears, and click OK to add the menu bar to your page. 
The bar will be added with four generic navigation items as well as the default Spry Menu 
bar style which is a light gray background and black text (Figure 14-3). You will be restyling 
the appearance of the menu a bit later, but first you need to add new menu items.
Figure 14-3: The inserted Spry Menu bar.
Take Note...
To select an entire widget and make it active in the Property Inspector, click the blue tab that 
appears above its top-left corner.
6.	 The Property Inspector now displays all the options for the new widget. This includes 
three columns, each of which represents a new level of navigation for a drop-down menu. 
Locate the leftmost column, which lets you add and customize the top level links on the 
menu bar. Select the first item titled Item 1.

7.	 Locate the Text field on the right side of the Property Inspector. Type the name Home to 
rename the item (Figure 14-4). Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).
Figure 14-4: Use the Property Inspector to modify and rearrange menu bar items and links.
8.	 Repeat steps 6 and 7 for Item 2, Item 3, and Item 4, renaming them Products, Services, 
and Contact Us, respectively.
This covers the top level navigation for now; next, you will quickly add two more levels to 
your navigation. For each top-level menu item, you can add up to two additional tiers of 
menus.
9.	 Select the Products link in the leftmost column on the Property Inspector. 
Locate the plus sign above the second column, and click it to add a new submenu item as 
seen in Figure 14-5. 
Figure 14-5: Add a second level to the menu by clicking the plus icon in the second column.
Locate the Text field on the right, and rename the new item Gourmet Foods. Press 
Enter/Return.
10.	 Click the plus sign above the second column twice more to add two new submenu items. 
Rename them Lifestyle and Beauty. Next, you’ll add a third tier by creating a submenu 
for the Lifestyle link you just added.
11.	 Select the Lifestyle link in the center column. Locate the plus sign above the rightmost 
column, and click it twice to add two new submenu items to the Lifestyle link.
12.	 Select each of the new items and use the Text field on the right side of the Property 
Inspector to rename them Furniture and Accessories, respectively. Press Enter/Return. 
In addition to adding levels, you can delete them as well. Your first link to Home has three 
sub-items that Dreamweaver added by default. You will delete them as they don’t reflect 
your site structure.
13.	 In the leftmost column, select the top-level link named Home. Click on Item 1.1 and then 
press the minus icon to remove this link. Repeat this step for Item 1.2 and Item 1.3 so 
there are no sub-items.
You’ll now reorder some of the items in the Services menu.
14.	 In the Property Inspector, click on the Services link and then press the up arrow. This 
moves the item up one level and Services is now the second category (Figure 14-6).
Figure 14-6: Use the up and down arrows above the first list to reorder the top-level links to set the final order.

15.	 Choose File > Save to save your page. The Copy Dependent Files dialog box appears to let 
you know that files will be copied to your site directory to support the new menu. Click 
OK to save the page.
Spry Support Files
The first time you save a page that includes a Spry Widget, you are prompted to save 
new and necessary files to your site. If you look at your Files panel, you will notice that 
a new Spry Assets folder has been added to your site files. This folder contains essential 
JavaScript, CSS, and image files that style your new widget and make it work. Be sure to 
copy this folder to your web server when publishing your site—your widgets will not work without it.
16.	 Press the Live View button on the Document toolbar to test your new menu. Mouse over 
each menu item to see the rollover effects and submenus you created. Press the Live View 
button again to return to your editing view. 
Customizing Spry Widgets with CSS 
Now that you’ve added a new Spry Menu bar and customized the navigation options, you’re 
ready to start giving it some style. Each new widget added to your page includes its own, 
attached CSS file that you can modify to have your new menu match the look and feel of your 
site. All CSS rules can be managed from the CSS Styles panel just like your existing page styles.
Follow these steps to customize Spry Widgets
Step-by-Step
1.	 Locate and, if necessary, expand the CSS Styles panel. Double-click the Insert panel to 
collapse it and give yourself more screen space. You have two groups of CSS styles in this 
page: styles.css is the external style sheet that contains the majority of the styles for the 
page, and SpryMenuBarHorizontal.css is the external style sheet for just the menu bar. 
Click the All tab to locate the attached SpryMenuBarHorizontal.css style sheet, and 
expand it to view all its rules. 
Click the minus sign (Windows) or down arrow (Mac OS) to the left of styles.css to 
collapse this list and view only the Spry menu styles as seen in Figure 14-7.

Lesson 14: Adding Interactivity with the Spry Framework 
Customizing Spry Widgets with CSS 
There are more than a dozen style rules for this menu; you will now modify a few of them 
in order to match your page design. A word of warning: the style names for these menu 
items are very similar and long, so you will need to pay careful attention to which style 
you are modifying. It may help you to expand the width of the CSS Styles panel in order 
to see the style names.
2.	 Select the ul.MenuBarHorizontal rule to view its properties (Figure 14-9). This rule 
controls the overall appearance and size settings for the menu bar.
Figure 14-8: Click Add Property to add a new CSS rule.
3.	 Click Add Property at the bottom of the existing property listing. An empty field appears 
with a menu to the right.
Note that depending on your workspace you may need to expand the Properties section of 
the CSS Styles panel to see the properties.
4.	 Click on the drop-menu and scroll down the resulting list to select the font-family 
property. This triggers a new field to the right. Click on this drop-menu and choose the 
Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif family.
5.	 Locate the font-size property, which has a default value of 100%. Click the 100% value and 
type 11, then click the rightmost drop-down menu and choose px for the unit value. This 
will have the effect of making the entire menu bar slightly smaller.

6.	 Select the ul.MenuBarHorizontal a rule to view its properties. In the Properties 
section, click on the value for background-color (#EEE) and type #88B036 (green) 
as the new color and press Enter (Window) or Return (Mac OS) as seen in Figure 14-10. 
This sets the background color of the menu bar which happens to be the same shade as the 
navigation div.
Figure 14-10: Modify the background-color property of the rule  
to change the appearance of the menu bar items.
7.	 Click the color swatch (currently set to #333) under the color property and change the 
color to #FFFFFF (white) and press Enter (Window) or Return (Mac OS). This changes 
the color of the hyperlinked text on each menu item.
8.	 In the list of rules, select the following to view its properties:
ul.MenuBarHorizontal a.MenuBarItemHover, ul.MenuBarHorizontal 
a.MenuBarItemSubmenuHover, ul.MenuBarHorizontal 
a.MenuBarSubmenuVisible rule 
This rule controls the appearance of linked menu items as you roll over them in the menu; 
it is currently set to a dark blue.
Take Note...
Because this long CSS rule will be difficult to locate in the panel, you can count upward from 
the bottom of the rules. It is the seventh from the bottom and the default background color is 
#33C (blue).
9.	 Click the color swatch under the background-color property and type #9FCC41 (light 
green) as the new color.

style changes you’ve made (Figure 14-11). 
Figure 14-11: Use Live View to preview the style changes and interactivity on your new menu.
11.	 Click Live View again to return to the standard view. Choose File > Save All to save your 
project. You’ll now take a look at another navigation element: the tabbed panel.
The Spry Tabbed panel
The Spry Tabbed panel widget organizes content into several panels that you can toggle 
between by clicking on tabs. This is a great way to organize items on a page: it saves space and 
can improve usability when used correctly. 
Editing the content of the tabbed panels is a bit easier to edit than the Spry Menu bar, instead 
of using the Property Inspector to add and modify content, you can type directly within the 
tabs or containers in the document window. Tabbed panels can contain almost any type of 
content, including text, images, video, and Flash movies.
You’ll now add a Spry Tabbed panel to your page to display three pieces of featured content.
Follow these steps to add a Spry Tabbed panel
Step-by-Step
1.	 Near the top of your page, select the placeholder text that reads {tabbed panels here}, and 
delete it. Leave your cursor at this position.
2.	 Click the Insert panel if necessary to expand it. Locate and click the Spry Tabbed Panels 
button and click it to add a new tabbed panel set.

3.	 Locate the Panels column in the center of the Property Inspector below. This shows you 
the current panels (and tabs) in your panel set, and lets you add new ones. Click the plus 
sign at the top of the column to add a third tab to your panel set.
The new tab is out of order, so press the down arrow in the Panels section to move Tab 3 
to the bottom of the list.
4.	 In the Property Inspector, click Tab 1 to activate it as seen in Figure 14-13. On the page 
and within the tab, select the text “Tab 1” and type What’s New in its place. 
Figure 14-13: Select the text inside Tab 1 and rename it to What’s New.
5.	 Select the text within Tab 2 and type Featured. Select the text within Tab 3 and type 
Customer Testimonials. Be careful as you move from one tab to the next: if the 
visibility icon appears and you click it, the tab will open up. For now, you just want to 
rename the tab headings.
Next, you will add content into the areas inside each tab.
6.	 Below the tabbed panel, you’ll see three paragraphs of content that you’ll move and 
organize into the new panel group. Highlight the entire first paragraph, beginning with 
the headline Shop In the Green and be sure to include the recycle bag image. Choose Edit 
> Cut.
7.	 Select the placeholder text within the first tab (Content 1), then choose Edit > Paste to 
paste the content directly into the What’s New panel. You will now place content into the 
Featured panel.
8.	 Place your cursor over the Featured tab but don’t click yet. 
9.	 Wait for the visibility icon to appear (Figure 14-14) and then click once to bring the tab to 
the front.

Take Note...
If you want to change which panel is open by default, you can use the Default Panel drop-
down menu on the Property Inspector to determine which tab and panel are loaded first.
13.	 In the CSS Styles panel, locate and expand the style sheet named SpryTabbedPanels.css, 
which was attached when you added the tabbed panel group. Like the Spry Menu bar, the 
tabbed panel has a dedicated style sheet that you can modify to change its appearance.

the currently selected tab.
16.	 Select the rule named .TabbedPanelsContentGroup. Click on the background-color 
value (#EEE) and type #CF9 and press Enter/Return. This sets the background color of 
the entire panel to the same shade of green as the tab.
The panels height is currently being defined by the amount of content. If you wanted to 
override this, you could set an explicit height for the panels.

the .TabbedPanelsContentGroup style.
18.	 Choose File > Save All. Then preview your page in the browser to see your tabs in action. 
The copy-dependent files dialog box will appear. Click OK to accept. There are a few 
other styles that you could modify here, but for now, you’ll move on to the next Spry 
Widget: the Accordion Panel.
The Spry Accordion panel
At first glance, the Spry Accordion panel resembles a standard vertical menu bar. As the 
name suggests, however, each item contracts and expands to reveal a content panel where you 
can add text and images. The accordion panel allows you to have only one panel open at a 
time. 
Accordion panels are great for navigation, tree-style navigation or lists, or organizing related 
content (such as a Frequently Asked Questions list) into a clean, panel-style format. As with the 
other Spry Widgets, the Spry Accordion uses its own style sheet, which you can easily modify 
to make it match your current theme.

10.	 Repeat steps 8 and 9 for the remaining paragraphs in the accordiontext.html file, pasting 
them into the Clothing, Home Products, and Lifestyle panels, respectively.
As with the other Spry Widgets, the default style will need to be changed to match the 
look and feel of your site.
11.	 Under the CSS Styles panel, locate the attached style sheet named SpryAccordion.css, 
and expand it to reveal its rules.
12.	 Select the .AccordionPanelTab rule. To the right of the background color property, click 
the color swatch and notice that your cursor is an eyedropper. Place the eyedropper in the 
green area immediately above the accordion, and click once to sample the green color from 
the header (Figure 14-21). This sets the background color to #88B036 (green).
Figure 14-21: Using the eyedropper, sample the green from the header to apply it as a background-color.
13.	 Select the .AccordionPanelOpen .AccordionPanelTab rule. Click on the

Properties list, and change its value from 200px to 100px. This changes the height of the 
content panels when shown.
There are a few more styles to change before you are done styling the accordion. One of 
the default styles for this widget is a Focused style which defines the appearance of the 
accordion when it is selected. By default, it is blue (although you cannot see this unless you 
preview in a browser), so you will change this now.

you are done, close the browser and return to Dreamweaver.
The Spry Collapsible panel
This simple panel displays or reveals its contents when clicked, and is a great way to hide 
information that doesn’t need to be visible at all times. You can think of the Spry Collapsible 
panel as a piece of the Spry Accordion that can only display a single panel and label.
You’ll add a single Spry Collapsible panel to create a hidden e-mail signup form at the bottom 
of your page.

Lesson 14
Working with Spry Data Widgets
In addition to what you’ve seen so far, the Spry panel includes a whole group of powerful data 
widgets that can read from an external XML file. This is perfect for creating pages and page 
elements (such as calendars, news, and blogs) that otherwise would require manual formatting. 
You can connect XML information to a pre-configured data widget from the Spry panel (such 
as the Spry Table), or build your own display components using common page objects such 
as lists, tables, and div tags. You can even use CSS to format Spry data widgets so they blend 
perfectly with your existing design. 
What is XML?
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language, and is the standard now used to describe and 
exchange data between seemingly unrelated systems. XML, like HTML, uses a series of tags—
however, that’s where the similarities end. Unlike HTML, XML doesn’t use a series of pre-
defined tags; instead, XML developers create tags using names they understand and that are 
relevant to the data they’re trying to work with.
A typical XML document may look like the following:
<meeting>
<attendee>
<name>John Smith</name>
<dept>Payroll</dept>
<extension>2225</extension>
</attendee>
</meeting>
Each tag is referred to as a node; the nodes and structure of an XML file are referred to as a 
schema.
XML can exist on a web server outside your local site, or as a local XML file. How this XML 
file is created, or where it comes from, is up to you, and this will be different for every project. 
Because XML documents are plain text, they can be created in Dreamweaver, as well as a 
variety of other popular text editors.
Creating a Spry XML data set
Before you can add a data widget to your page, you must first create a Spry XML data set. 
These are pointers to XML data sources (such as an XML file in your site folder) that let 
Dreamweaver know where the file is and what information it contains. A single page can use 
multiple data sets, and you can manage all data sets from the Bindings panel.
Follow these steps to create a Spry XML data set
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the Spry Data Set button (
) at the top of the Insert panel’s Spry category. The 
Spry Data Set dialog box appears.
2.	 At the top, choose XML from the Select Data Type drop-down menu. Type events as the 
Data Set Name.
3.	 Click the Browse button next to the Specify Data File field. When the Select XML Source 
dialog box appears, navigate to the data folder in your site’s root directory. Select the 
events.xml file in the folder and press OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS).

Working with Spry Data Widgets
The schema panel shown in Figure 14-25 displays the node structure of your XML document.
Figure 14-25: Pointing to the XML file to be used as a Data Set.
4.	 Click on the <event> node; the xData path at the bottom of the dialogue box should read 
calendar/event.
This node is a Row Element which is a repeating node: this is appropriate because many 
events are held and they all have the same structure: Month, Date, Year.
5.	 Press Done to create the data set. You will now created data bindings to this data.
6.	 A new Bindings panel will now be visible as seen in Figure 14-26 (if not, choose Window 
> Bindings to display it). This is where you can view and manage your data sets and see 
the nodes that they contain. You may need to adjust the height of the Bindings panel or 
the surrounding panels to see the contents better.

Lesson 14
Adding a Spry Data Widget: The Spry Repeat List
Once you’ve created a Spry data set, you are ready to add a Spry Data Widget to your page. A 
Spry Data Widget is simply an HTML structure (such as a list or table) that is designed to build 
itself from information it finds in a Spry Data Set. Rather than having to manually add bullet 
points or rows, the widget builds as many as it needs to display the records found in a specific 
data set.
An easy way to display data from your new XML Data Set is by using a Spry Repeat List, 
which uses one of three HTML list styles (unordered, ordered, or definition list) to display 
data. As with any standard HTML structure, you can fine-tune its look with basic CSS 
properties. To get you started, the lesson file includes some pre-created CSS classes that you 
will apply to your generated content.
Follow these steps to add a Spry Repeat List Widget
Step-by-Step
1.	 Locate the section in the right column of your page that begins with the header events. 
Select the placeholder text {calendar here}.
2.	 Under the Spry category on the Insert panel, click the Spry Repeat List button to add a 
new list. The Insert Spry Repeat List dialog box appears.
3.	 From the Container Tag drop-down menu, you can choose one of three list types, or even 
use a form SELECT menu. Select the DL (Definition List) as seen in Figure 14-27.
Figure 14-27: Choose the DL (Definition List) as your structure.
Take Note...
A Definition List displays information in tiered Title/Definition sets. It is similar to a 
standard ordered or unordered list, except that each bullet contains a set of two pieces of 
information.
4.	 From the Spry Data Set drop-down menu, make sure events is selected, which is the XML 
data set you created earlier. The new list will build itself dynamically from information it 
finds in this dataset. 
5.	 From the DT Column drop-down menu, make sure date is selected. This corresponds to 
the date node found in your data set, and will display the date as the header for each list 
item created.

6.	 From the DD Column drop-down menu, select title (Figure 14-28). This will display the 
event title below the date in each list item created.
Figure 14-28: Choose the DL (Definition List) as your structure, and set it to display  
the date and title fields from your XML file.
7.	 Click OK. If a dialog box appears prompting you to Add a Spry Region, make sure to 
press Yes. Without it, the data will not load into the widget.
Take Note...
If you forget to add a Spry Region, or need to recreate it, you can use the Spry Region button, 
found underneath the Spry category of the Insert panel. Just make sure that any Spry Data 
Widgets are placed inside the new region!
8.	 A new Spry Region is added to your page, as well as a new definition list. You will see 
placeholders for the information in your data set. Preview your page in the browser or Live 
View; these will be replaced with actual data from your data set as seen in Figure 14-29.

Styling and fine-tuning data widgets
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
408
Lesson 14
Styling and fine-tuning data widgets
Once you’ve added a data widget, you can fine-tune it by adding additional data fields, 
rearranging the order of data fields, and of course, styling it with some basic CSS. Your current 
lesson file contains an attached style sheet with some pre-created styles that you can assign to 
your new Spry Repeat List to give it some style. You will also add data fields to your list that 
aren’t currently being displayed, such as the time and description for each calendar event.
Before you begin, make sure that you turn Live View off in the Document toolbar if necessary.
Follow these steps to style a widget
Step-by-Step
1.	 Locate your new Spry Repeat List in the right-side column, and click to position your 
cursor directly after the {date} placeholder text. 
2.	 Add a space, and type a colon (:). You’ll follow this colon with the actual event time from 
your XML data set, which the list is not currently using.
3.	 If it is not currently visible, choose Window > Bindings to display your Bindings panel. 
You’ll see your events data set listed, as well as the data fields below it. Locate and select 
the time data field in the list—this contains the time for each event.
4.	 Click and drag the time data field from the Bindings panel, and release it next to the {date}: 
text on the page. This adds a placeholder for the time to your repeat list. It should read 
{date}:{time} as seen in Figure 14-30.
Figure 14-30: Drag fields from the Bindings panel to add placeholders to your repeat list. The  
new {time} placeholder will fill in the time information from your XML file.
5.	 Directly below the date and time, click to position your cursor after the {title} placeholder. 
Press Shift+Return/Enter to create a line break. Here is where you’ll place a caption for 
each event as defined in the XML file.
6.	 On the Bindings panel, locate the caption field within the events data set. Click and drag 
it from the Bindings panel and place it in the new line you created on your page below the 
{title}. This adds a new placeholder for {caption}.

Lesson 14: Adding Interactivity with the Spry Framework 
Styling and fine-tuning data widgets
7.	 Now you’ll use some pre-created CSS rules to dress up your list. Select the entire line in 
your list that reads {date}:{time}. On the left side of the Property Inspector, press the HTML 
button, if necessary, to switch to HTML view. Select .eventDate from the Class drop-
down menu to apply it to the selected text (Figure 14-31).
Figure 14-31: Select text in your repeat list and apply a class from the Property Inspector to style it.
8.	 Select the text that reads {title}. Select .eventTitle from the Class drop-down menu to 
apply the rule to the selected text.
9.	 Highlight the text in your list that reads {caption}. Select .eventCaption from the Class 
drop-down menu to apply the rule to the selected text.
10.	 Choose File > Save to save your page. Click the Live View button on the Document 
toolbar to preview your list with the newly added data and CSS rules (Figure 14-32).
Figure 14-32: The finished and styled Spry Repeat List, shown in Live View.
11.	 Click Live View again to turn it off.
From this point, you can simply update the attached XML files without the need 
to modify the data widgets in any way. Because each Spry Data Widget populates 
dynamically, new data will flow into the widget each time the page is loaded.
12.	 Choose File > Close. You are done with this lesson!

CSS is the main component that changes the look of your Spry Widgets. But since you’re using 
CSS, you can save it and apply it to future Spry Widgets you may add later. 
Launch Dreamweaver CS6 if you haven’t already. 
1.	 Create a new blank HTML page.
2.	 Add a Spry Widget such as a Spry Menu. 
3.	 Modify it with CSS to your liking. 
4.	 Save the style sheet as an external style sheet to apply to Spry menus you work with later.

Understanding code elements is good when bringing in outside code documents. You don’t 
have to be a coder to recognize how some of the objects are making the connections once 
you’ve had a chance to look at both the code and how the interface puts all the pieces together. 
1.	 Go to the location on your computer where you’ve stored the lesson files for this book, 
find the dw14lessons folder. 
2.	 Go inside the folder and open up the events.xml in a simple text editing program or 
Dreamweaver to take a look at the code. 
Circling Back 3
You saw how dynamic Spry objects can be in terms of making your webpages more interesting 
to explore. Getting more familiar with the Spry objects that you have at your disposal could 
help you generate ideas for how to approach design. You’ll practice adding various Spry 
components, and then modifying them using CSS. 
Menu Bar
Project 1
Menus are a key component for navigation and design. You want the design to be interesting 
enough to compel someone to click it, but you also want to make sure users know where 
they’re going. Creating a menu that’s eye catching is part of what you’ll be doing in the 
following exercise, but pay attention to how you’re naming your topics and sub-topics. 
Remember, you’re not designing this for site you, you’re designing it for anyone who might 
visit your site, so be sure to name topics / sub-topics in such a way that users will know the 
section of the website they will end up on when exploring your menu. 
1.	 Open Dreamweaver and establish a new site and root folder called Spry.
2.	 Create a new webpage and save it as menu.html.
3.	 Open the Insert panel and choose the Spry category.
4.	 Click to add a Spry Menu Bar. Choose Horizontal for the layout.

7.	 Choose Window > CSS Styles.
8.	 Open the properties for SpryMenuBarHorizontal.css and start to modify the visual 
properties of your new menu.
9.	 Repeat the process, but try it with a vertically-oriented menu instead.
Tabbed Panels
Project 2
Tabbed panels are a great way to visually organize your page. Placing content within a tab 
emphasizes the fact that it is conceptually different than other content on your site. HTML 
does not allow you to add panels, but you can add them with the help of the Spry Framework. 
1.	 Continue to work in your Spry site and add a new page called panels.html.
2.	 Open the Insert panel and choose the Spry category.
3.	 Click to add a Spry Tabbed Panel.
4.	 Change the name of the tabs to represent a topic and sub-topic, for example, About Us and 
Contact Information.
5.	 Style the panels visually using the CSS Styles panel under the SpryTabbedPanels.css 
settings. Try different settings and explore design options.
6.	 Add some text content to each of the panels and test it in a browser.
Accordion Panels
Project 3
Screen space is always at a premium on the Web, especially with sites that feature large 
navigation structures. Accordion panels are one strategy at your disposal for maximizing screen 
space.
1.	 Continue to work in your Spry site and add a new page called accordion.html.
2.	 Open the Insert panel and choose the Spry category.
3.	 Click to add a Spry Accordion.
4.	 Change the name of the tabs to represent a topic and sub-topic, such as About Us and 
Contact Information.
5.	 Style the panels visually using the CSS Styles panel under the SpryAccordion.css 
settings. Try different settings and explore design options.
6.	 Add some text content to each of the panels, test in a browser, and compare the flow to 
your panels.html page.

The rise of the mobile web
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
416
Lesson 15
The rise of the mobile web
Creating websites has always presented certain challenges. Among these challenges is the fact 
that the people who visit your site might have different-size monitors; therefore, the page 
layout that works well on one screen might not work so well on another screen. Another 
challenge is the different versions of web browsers that users might have. A page that looks 
one way in Internet Explorer 9 might not look the same way on Internet Explorer 6. Despite 
these challenges, the Web has thrived and grown tremendously because the benefits it offers far 
outweigh the downsides. Instant access to information, the ability to easily share information 
through hyperlinks and e-mail, the convenience of online shopping and payment: these are all 
major benefits.
The mobile web is a broad definition for the emergence of websites and mobile applications 
that are designed to be viewed on portable and typically small screen devices. The Web is now 
portable. It is no longer tethered to a desktop, and is accessible wherever a user has a connection. 
In many cases, external peripherals, such as the keyboard and mouse, have dropped in favor of 
touchscreens’ miniature keyboards. Built-in features such as GPS and cameras can also come 
into play, allowing the user to interact with the Web in new and different ways.
However, with all these benefits come new challenges. Portable screens also mean smaller 
screens. Consequently, your great desktop design suffers as it scales. Navigation that works well 
on the desktop may become difficult to click at ¼ the size. Other challenges include the still-
limited bandwidth that currently exists when using a cellular network, the inability to play 
certain media such as Flash or web video, and web browser incompatibility, which is an issue 
that has not been quite resolved.
Dreamweaver tools for mobile layout
Dreamweaver CS6 has a few different tools for designers and developers who want to optimize 
their content for mobile devices. Before proceeding, you should learn about the different 
categories of the mobile web, which are explained next.
• Native Applications
Smartphones, such as those on iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile platforms, have 
achieved a tremendous amount of growth and popularity since 2007 and the introduction 
of Apple’s iPhone. Native applications, or “apps,” live on a user’s device. Apps are tightly 
integrated with the Web and display content from the Web, but they are not exclusively 
dependent on the Web. Dreamweaver CS6 is capable of creating native applications for 
iOS, Android, Blackberry, webOS, and symbian; however, it does so with the help of 
the Phonegap framework. With PhoneGap and Dreamweaver CS6, you start with an 
HTML and JavaScript document and are able to then build multiple apps for the different 
platforms. We do not cover PhoneGap functionality in this lesson or in this book.

Figure 15-1: The PhoneGap service integrated with  
Dreamweaver CS6 allows you to build native  
applications for mobile devices.
• Websites
All websites that can be accessed on a desktop browser can also be accessed on a mobile 
browser; therefore, every web page is part of the mobile web. However, as you will soon 
see, when a mobile web browser visits a website, the appearance of that site might be 
different from the desktop version. There are a few different explanations for this: 
–– The appearance of a web page on a mobile device might be different than the desktop 
version due to the scaling effect that the device’s web browser applies. Apple’s popular 
mobile Safari browser, for example, scales a web page to fit the screen and also allows 
for touch gestures such as pinch, zoom, or swiping in order to navigate through a page. 
Websites that were never intended for mobile viewing will still have these features because 
they are built-in to the browser itself.
–– The appearance of a web page on a mobile device might be different than the desktop 
version because the designer or developer has created a separate version designed for 
mobile. All web browsers, whether they are mobile or desktop, advertise themselves with 
something called a user agent. The creator of a website can let in all desktop user agents to 
their “standard site” and redirect all mobile users to a separate “mobile site.”

Lesson 15
Mobile website features in Dreamweaver
This lesson focuses on two methods for creating websites optimized for mobile. The first 
method focuses on using the Multiscreen feature and CSS3 Media Queries. In the exercise for 
this method, you will take the existing layout created in Lesson 6, “Advanced Page Layout,” 
and create a layout optimized for a mobile device, such as a smartphone. The second method 
focuses on the new Fluid Grid Layout feature in Dreamweaver CS6. This method also uses 
CSS3 Media Queries, but in a slightly different and more advanced way than the first exercise.
Dreamweaver does its best to simplify the process used to create mobile optimized sites. 
These are websites designed to function well on smaller screen, portable devices. You should 
note that this is the most advanced and difficult lesson in this book. You should also realize 
that at the time of this writing, there is no application on the market that makes designing 
a website for multiple screens “easy.” We firmly believe that a thorough understanding of 
the fundamentals of HTML, particularly CSS, is important when working with your sites. 
Therefore, once you have learned some of these fundamentals, you will find the tools in 
Dreamweaver to be extremely helpful and efficient.
Viewing your web page with the Multiscreen feature
Dreamweaver CS6 has improved the Multiscreen feature introduced in CS5.5. This feature 
helps you preview your pages in different screen sizes. Specifically, this multiscreen preview 
shows you your design in three different views by default: one for the desktop, and the other 
two for the smaller screens found in smartphone and tablet devices. Given that mobile device 
screens come in different sizes, you can also customize these views to any resolution you want. 
Additionally, Dreamweaver takes advantage of CSS3 Media Queries to let you build individual 
style sheets customized for each view. If you have not worked with Media Queries before, 
this exercise is designed to introduce you to the concept and also to help you learn how to use 
them in Dreamweaver.
Follow these steps to view a web page with the Multiscreen feature
Step-by-Step
1.	 In the Files panel, double-click the media_queries folder and then double-click 
15_index.html to open it. The basic design here is based on the one you created in 
Lesson 6 and uses floats and clears to create columns.
2.	 Choose File > Preview in Browser and select a browser. This page has a fixed-width size 
of 960 pixels and works well on most desktop monitor resolutions. 
To preview this page as it would appear on a mobile device such as a Smartphone or tablet 
device, you can use Dreamweaver CS6’s Multiscreen option.

This window adapts to the amount of space on your screen, which is dependent on your 
monitor resolution. In fact, if your monitor resolution is lower than 1280 pixels wide, you 
will have a difficult time working with Multiscreen Preview in general.

Lesson 15
As you can see from the preview, the Phone view and the Tablet view are not wide 
enough to fit your fixed-width page. You should note that Multiscreen is not an emulator. 
(An emulator is software that attempts to imitate a hardware phone or other computer 
device.) Most modern smartphones would actually scale your entire page to fit in the 
browser window. The Multiscreen feature is showing you the page based on a strict 
interpretation of the viewport.
A viewport, as it relates to mobile devices, is best described as a viewing area on the screen 
through which a user views a web page. 
4.	 Click the Viewport Sizes button in the top right corner; the default Viewport sizes appear. 
The default values for the Phone viewport is 320w by 300h; the default values for the 
Tablet viewport is 768w by 300h. The default width for the Desktop viewport is 1126w, 
but no height is defined. (If your sizes are different, click the Reset to Defaults button.)
These numbers are not arbitrary; the Phone viewport width is 320 and the Tablet 
viewport width is 768 because these are typical screen resolutions for devices such as the 
iPhone, iPad, and others. 
Take Note...
Screen resolutions actually do vary among devices, but Dreamweaver has chosen these as 
standards.
5.	 Click Cancel. You can modify the viewport sizes to fit your needs; however, we 
recommend you use the default sizes until you become more familiar with the reasons for 
modifying the sizes.
These viewport sizes are important because you can create unique style sheets that will 
only apply to viewports of a certain size. For example, for the smallest viewport you might 
want a layout that is only a single column, instead of the current three-column layout 
designed used for the desktop layout. You can do this in Dreamweaver using MultiScreen 
Preview and a related feature called Media Queries.
6.	 Keep the Multiscreen Preview window open; you’ll use it in the next exercise. First, we 
will present a brief overview of Media Queries before continuing.
Media Queries defined
Media Queries in Dreamweaver take advantage of a feature in CSS3, which is the latest version 
of CSS. This feature is part of the CSS3 specification called CSS3 Media Queries. Media 
Queries are a way of delivering different page layouts to users based on the capabilities of their 
screen or screens.
You can think of a CSS3 media query as a combination of HTML and CSS syntax that 
examines the capability of a user agent, typically a web browser, and lets you send it styles 
based on certain values. The most common capability queried is the width of a screen or a 
mobile device; other capabilities, such as the device orientation (landscape or portrait), can 
also be detected. Since media queries detect the capabilities of a user’s screen and serve styles 
that fit that screen, they are well-suited for today’s web environment with its different monitor

resolutions. Figure 15-4 shows a simplified version of how media queries work: each device 
gets a specific style sheet based on the size of its screen.

Server
Figure 15-4: Unique style sheets are delivered to users depending on their screen capabilities.
Here is a different example: suppose a user has a smartphone with a screen resolution of 320 
pixels wide by 480 pixels high, and the phone is in portrait mode (vertical). This user visits a 
website that uses media queries. When the user visits the site, the media queries built into the 
page detect the capabilities of the phone and serve it a specific style sheet with a single column 
layout. When the user rotates the phone into landscape position, the change is detected and the 
media queries send a style sheet designed for a 480 pixel-wide screen (the layout might have 
two columns instead of one).
From the perspective of users, they are simply getting the ideal layout for the screen size they 
are using. Users might notice this change in layout momentarily as they rotate their screen or 
visit the site on different devices, but the overall goal is to improve their experience on the site 
by improving aspects such as readability, navigation, and presentation of content.

Lesson 15
Creating a site-wide media query file
As noted earlier, Media Queries are a relatively new advance in web design and are part of the 
CSS3 specification. (Most of the CSS you have been working on throughout this book has been 
part of the CSS2.0 specification.) There are many benefits to using media queries, but their use is 
a tradeoff because they are not fully supported by all browsers (particularly older browsers).
There are a few ways to add Media Queries to a page. The first method adds the Media 
Queries code within your existing style sheet (either an internal or external style sheet). The 
second method is the one that Dreamweaver CS6 uses by default, and is called a site-wide media 
query file. A site-wide media query file is a special type of external style sheet that has no style 
rules; instead, its only job is to import any number of other style sheets into your page.
In this exercise, you’ll learn how to create a site-wide query file as well as new style sheets for a 
Phone layout and a Tablet layout. You’ll also learn to link your existing style sheet to the site-
wide media query file.
Follow these steps to create a media query file
Step-by-Step
1.	 Your Multiscreen Preview window should be open from the last exercise. If it is not, click 
the Multiscreen button.
2.	 Click the Media Queries button in the Edit section at the top right of the preview 
window. The Media Queries window appears (Figure 15-5).
 Figure 15-5: The Media Queries window in Dreamweaver CS6.
The site-wide media queries file you are about to create will function as a hub to import 
style sheets with rules designed for Phone and Tablet screens. 

Lesson 15

The rise of the mobile web
3.	 In the Write Media Queries to section, click the option button for Site-wide media query 
file, and then click the Specify button. In the window that appears, click the CSS File 
menu and choose Create new file. Type mobilestyles in the CSS File field as seen in 
Figure 15-6 and click OK.
Figure 15-6: Specify a new site-wide media query file.
As noted earlier, this site-wide media query file has a very specific job: it imports external 
style sheets that contain styles for your different screen sizes. It’s currently empty and so 
you will now create those style sheets.
Take Note...
After you have defined a site-wide media query file, the information is stored within your site 
definitions. To access it, choose Site > Manage Site. Choose your current site and click Edit. 
Click the Advanced Settings; the path to your site-wide media query file appears. 
4.	 Make sure the “Force devices to report actual width” check box is selected. This option 
overrides a smartphone’s default behavior of scaling a web page to fit the screen. 
Take Note...
Selecting this option places the following line of HTML in the head section of your page:  
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />.
5.	 In the Media Queries window, click the Default Presets button; three media query presets 
appear in the middle window (Figure 15-7). 
Figure 15-7: The three default presets for Media Queries.
The first preset is called Phone, and you can use it for screens up to 320 pixels wide. This 
preset is selected automatically; you can see the properties of this media query in the 
Properties section at the bottom. The important value here is max-width, which is set to 
320px.

Lesson 15
6.	 Locate the CSS File section and make sure Create new file is selected. Click the Folder 
icon on the far right and the Save File As window appears. Navigate to the media_queries 
subfolder in your dw15lessons folder, type phone in the File name field, and then click 
Save.
7.	 Click the second preset for Tablet and note the properties for min-width and max-width. 
These properties are the media queries designed to detect the width of the user’s browser 
viewport; the value for Min Width is set to 321 and value for Max Width is set to 768. In 
practical terms, this means that the tablet style sheet will be used for any browser width 
between those two values.
Furthermore, any browser less than 321 pixels wide will use the Phone style sheet defined 
in the last step. 
8.	 Click the Folder icon on the far right side of the CSS File section (seen in Figure 15-8); 
the Save File As window appears. Navigate to the media_queries subfolder in your 
dw15lessons folder, type tablet in the File name field , and then click Save.
Figure 15-8: Setting the media queries and style sheet for tablet devices.
The last media query you need to add is for Desktop screens; in this case, any viewport 
wider than 768 pixels.
9.	 Click the Desktop preset. This preset has a min-width set to 769; there is no need to add 
a max-width. This time, click the CSS File menu and choose Use Existing file. Click the 
Folder icon, and within your media_queries folder, click the styles.css document, and then 
click OK (Windows) or Open (Mac OS). Since this is the current style sheet that contains 
your page’s styles, you only need to point to it. 
10.	 Click OK in the Media Queries window, and then close the Multiscreen Preview window. 
Locate the files you just created within the Files panel (mobilestyles.css, phone.css, and 
tablet.css).

Lesson 15
425
Lesson 15: Mobile Design and Layout 
The rise of the mobile web
11.	 In the Files panel, double-click the mobilestyles.css file to open it. This is the site-wide 
media query file you created in Steps 3 and 4. Note that it uses the @import syntax to link 
to the other three external style sheets (Figure 15-9). Keep this file open; you will modify 
it in the next exercise.
Figure 15-9: The site-wide media query file mobilestyles.css with the added media query files. 
The preceding steps might seem long, but you only need to do them the first time you set 
up media queries. Once you have them set up, you have a framework for creating unique 
styles for screens of different sizes.
Organizing your style sheets
Dreamweaver CS6’s media queries feature simplifies complicated tasks when creating site-wide 
media queries, but it’s not perfect. To ensure your style sheets are most effective, you need to 
manually fine-tune them. In this exercise, you will organize the style sheets you created in the 
last exercise.
Follow these steps to organize your style sheets
Step-by-Step
1.	 Your mobilestyles.css file should still be open from the last exercise. If not, open it by 
double-clicking the file in the Files panel. 
2.	 Select the following code, and then choose Edit > Cut, Ctrl+X (Windows), or Cmd+X 
(MacOS).
/* Desktop */ 
@import url("styles.css") only screen and (min-width:769px);
3.	 Place your cursor on the first line, and then choose Edit > Paste, Ctrl+V (Windows), or 
Cmd+V (Mac OS) to paste the code at the top of your document as seen in Figure 15-10. 
This step is necessary to ensure that the desktop style sheet is used first, followed by the 
styles for the phone and tablet style sheets.
Figure 15-10: Your Desktop preset links to your original external style sheet.

The rise of the mobile web

Lesson 15
4.	 Next, select the following code (highlighted in red) and delete it. Do not delete the 
semicolon at the end of the line, or your styles will no longer work.
/* Desktop */ 
@import url("styles.css") only screen and (min-width:769px);
This step is necessary for older browsers that don’t support media queries and only need a 
standard style sheet to use. Since this line is now a reference to your original style sheet, 
you should not encounter problems with older browsers.
5.	 Choose File > Save to save this style sheet. Your next step is to remove the reference in 
your HTML page to your original style sheet.
6.	 If it is not already open, click your 15_index.html document to open it. Click the Source 
Code button in the top-left corner to view the HTML of your document. Click on the 
Code button to enter the Code view. 
7.	 In the Code view, locate the following line in your head section (it should be on line 7):
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
Select this entire line and then press Delete to remove it.
This code is the original link to your style sheet, but you don’t need it because you added a 
reference to this file in your mobilestyles.css document.
8.	 Choose File > Save All.
Creating a layout optimized for mobile
Now that you have prepared your site with a site-wide media query file and the associated style 
sheets, you can begin using them. The general principle of CSS3 Media Queries is that you use 
the exact same names for the style rules in your phone and tablet style sheets as the style rules 
in your desktop style sheet. By using the same names, you override the desktop style wherever 
needed. For example, you will first apply this rule with the ID style called #container. In 
your desktop style sheet, this ID style defines the width of the entire page as 960 pixels. In 
your phone style sheet, you will create another rule with the name #container, but you will 
set the width to 100% for this style. 
In the following exercise, you will only work with the phone style sheet; use the tablet style 
sheet for practice.
Follow these steps to work with a phone style sheet
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the Multiscreen button to preview your page, and for this exercise, focus on the 
Phone view. From all appearances, the multiscreen preview looks exactly the same as it did 
at the beginning of the lesson, and yet all the work you did in the last few exercises will 
now begin to pay off. Close your Multiscreen Preview window.
2.	 In your Related Files toolbar, click the phone.css link. The blank style sheet opens in the 
Code view indicating that there are no styles in this file, yet. (The line labeled @charset 
"utf-8"; is not a style, it helps the browser understand the language being used.) Your first 
task is to change the width of your container.

The rise of the mobile web
3.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the New CSS Rule button, and then in the Selector Type 
menu, choose ID. Click the Selector Name menu and choose container from the list 
(Figure 15-11).
Figure 15-11: Creating a new rule for the container ID in your phone.css style sheet.
4.	 Click OK. In the CSS rule definition window, click the Box category and type 100 in the 
width box. Click the menu to the right and change the value from px to %. Click OK.
To see the effect this has on your phone style sheet, you will need to preview your page in 
the Multiscreen Preview.
5.	 Since you cannot open the Multiscreen Preview when you have a style sheet selected, click 
the Source Code button in your Related Files toolbar to switch to your HTML page. Now 
click the MultiScreen button to view your page. 

The rise of the mobile web
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
428
Lesson 15
6.	 When the Multiscreen Preview page opens, you will see your page has dramatically changed 
in the Phone viewport (Figure 15-12) . By setting the width of the container to 100%, it 
will only be as wide as the viewport and most of the content within will have shifted or is 
overlapping. For example, the background image of the vegetables is now under the logo. 
Also notice the navigation bar does not fit all the way across the screen and has broken to the 
next line. Scroll down the page and note that your side columns have shifted. 
Figure 15-12: The Phone view shows the effect of changing  
the container width to 100%.
As you can see, creating a page optimized for mobile is not as simple as setting the 
container width to 100%. The page has changed, and you will need to modify it. The 
layout elements inside the container need to be addressed as well, since most of them have 
height or width values set as pixels. Also, some of the elements are floating. To fix the rest 
of the page, you will add rules that remove floats and override any explicit pixel width or 
height value. The goal is to create a single column layout.
Tips and strategies for optimizing pages for mobile
The following is a list of tips and strategies to consider when designing pages for mobile. 
Navigating and using websites on smaller screens or screens that are touch-enabled is 
very different from the desktop, and you should take it into consideration.
• Navigation should be at or near the top of the screen to be easily accessible. Repeat 
navigation at the bottom of all your pages so the user does not have to scroll up after 
reading a page.
• For touchscreen devices, use a large target size for navigation links to prevent 
accidental clicking.
• Touchscreen devices do not always have a hover capability as triggered by the mouse 
cursor on desktops. Plan your styles accordingly and avoid rollover styles.
• Avoid image-based navigation; use list-based navigation styled with CSS.
• Single-column layout is much easier to navigate and read on a smaller screen. A general 
strategy for accomplishing this with media queries is by removing floated elements and 
most layout containers with fixed width and height pixel values.

7.	 Close your Multiscreen Preview; you’ll now add more styles to your phone.css style sheet 
and create a single-column layout.
Take Note...
Since the Multiscreen Preview is large, it can become cumbersome to constantly open it 
and close it. If you have dual monitors, you can drag this window to a second monitor. 
Alternatively, you can collapse the Multiscreen Preview window by clicking the double arrows 
in the top-right corner. Click the arrows again to expand it.
8.	 Click the phone.css button in the Related Files toolbar. You’ll now add styles for the 
header section.
9.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the New CSS Rule button, and then in the Selector Type 
menu, choose ID. In the Selector name box, click the Selector Name menu and choose 
header.
10.	 Click OK. In the CSS rule definition window, click on the Background category. Click 
the Background-image menu, and then choose none as seen in Figure 15-13. Click OK. 
We will remove the image of the vegetables, which works well in the desktop version, but 
not in the phone version. 
Figure 15-13: Setting the background-image to none removes the image of the vegetables from the header.
11.	 Choose File > Save all. Choose Source Code and then click the Multiscreen button to 
see your progress. The background image no longer appears in the header for the Phone 
viewport. Close your Multiscreen Preview window.
Your next step is to address the styles of the navigation bar. Typically, CSS navigation bars 
have a few different rules that you need to modify.

Creating styles for navigation and a single-column layout
Creating easy-to-use mobile navigation is very important because you want users to read 
your content and not be frustrated by content that’s difficult to access. The hit target for mobile 
navigation should be large enough for touchscreens, and easy to read. You’ll add these styles now.
Follow these steps to create styles for easy-to-use mobile navigation
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the phone.css button in the Related Files toolbar. In the CSS Styles panel, click the 
New CSS Rule button, and then in the Selector Type menu, choose ID. In the Selector 
name box, type #navigation and click OK.
In the CSS rule definition window, click the Font-size menu and choose the keyword 
medium to override the 36 pixel value set in the original style sheet. This action prevents 
issues when there are differences between device screen resolutions.
2.	 Click the Positioning category, click the Height menu, and choose auto to override the 
fixed height of 36 pixels from the original style sheet. Click OK to create these styles.
You will need to do more work to make the navigation look better. There are often 
different rules for CSS navigation menus, so you also need to modify these.
3.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the New CSS Rule button, and then in the Selector 
Type menu, choose Compound. In the Selector name box, type #navigation ul li 
(Figure 15-14).This targets the style of the list items.
Figure 15-14: Create a compound selector to make a style for the navigation list items.
Click OK. In the CSS rule definition window, click the Box category, click the Float 
menu, and choose none. This overrides the float:left rule set in your original style sheet. 
Click OK.

4.	 Click the Source Code button to switch to your HTML page, and then click the 
Multiscreen button. Notice that by setting the float property of the list items to none, the 
list reverts to its default positioning, which is vertical (Figure 15-15).
Figure 15-15: Changing the float value of list  
items to “none” creates a vertical navigation  
instead of a horizontal one.
Your page is starting to improve: the navigation is now a single column. Place your cursor 
over the links and notice that the original hover styles are still present. One of the benefits 
of CSS3 Media Queries is that the original styles that have no overrides are still used.
Scroll down and notice that you still need to improve other areas: the main content and 
the sidebar still appear broken, but this is relatively easy to fix.
5.	 Close the Multiscreen Preview window, and then click the phone.css button in the 
Related Files toolbar.
6.	 In the CSS Styles panel, click the New CSS Rule button, and then in the Selector Type 
menu, choose ID. Click the Selector name menu and choose the main ID.
Click OK. In the CSS rule definition window, click the Box category, click the Float 
menu, and choose none. This overrides the float:left property and value set in your 
original style sheet.
7.	 Click the Width property menu and choose auto as seen in Figure 15-16.
Figure 15-16: Set the float value of the main column to none and the width to auto.

9.	 Choose File > Save All Related Files, click the Source Code button, and click the 
Multiscreen button. Scroll down your page and notice that your content section and 
sidebar now fill the screen from edge to edge. Also, notice that by removing the floats, 
your sidebar is now located below the main content.
10.	 Close the Multiscreen Preview menu window. You can also test your page in 
Dreamweaver’s Live view. First, click the Design button to switch to this view. Then click 
the Live view button. Live view uses the WebKit rendering engine, which is the same as 
Apple Safari and Google Chrome browser. 
11.	 Click the Window Size menu located on the bottom right of your document window, 
and from the list that appears, choose 320 × 480 Smart Phone as seen in Figure 15-17; your 
window will automatically adjust to this size and your media query file will be applied. 
This will also work in the Design view; however, you should place your cursor over the 
navigation. Note that in Live view the rollovers are active.
Figure 15-17:  In Live View, you can see the values of your window width. When the width is less than 321, the layout switches 
to the phones.css styles.
You can also preview your page in the browser and reduce the width of the window. 
Note that some browsers will not let you make the window that small. The phone.css is 
designed for phone browsers, not desktop browsers.
You can create and add other styles to the phone style sheet. You now have the 
foundations of how to create different layouts using media queries in Dreamweaver CS6, 
and apply this foundation to the table style sheet. You can close the currently open files; 
you will not need them.

The basics of Fluid Grid Layout
Dreamweaver’s Fluid Grid Layout expands on the concept of media queries. To understand 
fluid grids, think about page layout. Remember that the layout you began working with at 
the beginning of this lesson was a “fixed-width” layout set to a width of 960 pixels wide. 
Fixed-width layouts are very common on the Web because they are reliable to work with and 
control. However, one of the downsides of fixed-width layouts is that they do not respond well 
to different size screens. Many designers feel that fixed-width layouts do not reflect the nature 
of the Web and that “flexible” or “fluid” layouts are better suited for content. Flexible layouts 
generally use percentages or em units to define the various sections on the page. For example, 
the width of a sidebar might be defined as 33% of the page rather than 450 pixels.
Take Note...
If you would like to see the results of this exercise before you begin, navigate to the done folder 
within the fluidgrid folder, open the index.html file within a browser that supports media 
queries and resize the browser window.
Follow these steps to create a Fluid Grid layout
Step-by-Step
1.	 Chose File > New Fluid Grid; the New Document window appears with the Fluid Grid 
Layout settings on the screen (Figure 15-18).
The first major change that you will see is that Fluid Grids actually create three layouts at 
a time: Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop. Each of these layouts is defined as media queries; in 
this way, the settings are very similar to the ones you saw in the last exercise. However, 
notice that fluid grids use media queries, and they add grid structure to help you align 
content on the page.
Figure 15-18: The Fluid Grid Layout has layout settings for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

The rise of the mobile web
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 15
Each of the three layouts has a number of columns that will be created by default. The 
Mobile layout has five columns, the Tablet layout has eight columns, and the Desktop 
layout has ten columns. You can type any number of columns you want for each type of 
layout, but for now, you will use the defaults. Notice that the mobile layout has a unique 
setting, “25% of column width.” This represents the space between each of the columns, 
otherwise known as the gutter width. Additionally, each of the three layouts has a default 
page width listed at the bottom. For mobile, this is 91%; for tablet, this is 93%; and for the 
desktop, this is 90%. This means all the layouts will have a small amount of padding on the 
left and right sides.
Take Note...
If you do not see these values, click the Reset to Default button. 
2.	 Click Create; you will be prompted to generate a new external style sheet. Navigate to 
your dw15lessons folder, locate the fluidgrid folder, save this style sheet as base.css, and 
then click OK. A new document opens; you are in the unique fluid grid mode with a five- 
column layout and a default grid layout div element with placeholder text (Figure 15-19). 
You’ll learn more about both of these features shortly. For now, we’ll discuss the structure 
of this page and the related files created for Fluid Grid Layouts.
Figure 15-19: The default grid layout with a fluid grid layout div and placeholder content.
3.	 Choose File > Save and navigate to the fluidgrids folder if necessary. Save this document 
as index.html and click OK. You will be prompted to copy two dependent files: 
boilerplate.css and respond.min.js. You’ll learn more about the role of these files 
shortly; for now, click Copy. The two files will be saved into your fluidgrids folder.

Lesson 15: Mobile Design and Layout 
The rise of the mobile web
Working with Fluid Grids is different from what you might be used to. This initial view of 
five columns is the Mobile view for your web page. There are two other views as well: Tablet 
and Desktop. These views can be accessed by clicking any of the three icons (Figure 15-20).

Figure 15-20: A. Mobile size (480 × 800).  
B. Tablet size (768 × 1024). 
C. Desktop size (1000w). D. Window Size.
4.	 Click the Tablet Size icon; the size of the window changes to 768 by 1024 and displays 8 
columns.
5.	 Click the Desktop Size icon; the size of the window changes to 1000 wide; the height is 
set to the vertical space on your screen.
Regardless of the view you are in, you should note that the columns are visual aids only 
and are designed to help you align the Fluid Grid Layout Divs.
6.	 Choose View > Visual Aids and select the Fluid Grid Layout Guides option to turn off the 
guides. The reason for turning off the guides is to see your page design better; however, 
these guides are key to working with the Fluid Grid feature, so choose View > Visual Aids 
and select Fluid Grid Layout Divs to turn them back on.
7.	 Click the Mobile Size icon to return to the default five-column view. Dreamweaver opens 
this view initially because one of the foundations of Fluid Grid Layout is a concept called 
“mobile first.” The basic idea is that when designing a website from scratch, you start with 
the mobile design and layout first, and then move upward to the larger tablet and desktop 
sizes.
The foundations of “mobile first” design
Mobile first is a concept in web design that has been gaining popularity among 
designers in recent years. The basic idea is that when you are creating a new website 
design, you begin working with the mobile design first, and then move on to your larger 
screen designs. The rationale is that technique forces you to identify your most important 
or “core” features first, thus ensuring that they are folded into the mobile experience for 
your users. 
The traditional technique of starting with your complex desktop layout and removing 
or restyling parts until you arrive at your mobile layout can lead to design compromises 
and inefficient styles. By incorporating mobile first concepts into Fluid Grid Layouts, 
Dreamweaver is helping to promote the adoption and importance of designing for 
different size screens.
Creating your mobile layout
In the first half of this lesson, you covered the basics of using site-wide media query files. Note 
that you are still using media queries with Fluid Grid Layouts. However in this case, rather 
than dividing your media queries into separate style sheets, the rules for your three layouts 
are gathered in one style sheet (in this case, base.css). Specifically, as you begin to create the 
styles for the single column layout in this exercise, keep in mind that all these styles will 
automatically be applied to your larger tablet and desktop layouts.

Lesson 15
Follow these steps to create a mobile layout
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click in the default div that was created by Dreamweaver. In the Properties panel, locate 
the Div ID field, select the default value, and type header. (Figure 15-21)
Figure 15-21: Change the name of the default fluid grid layout div to “header.”
2.	 Select the placeholder text inside the header and delete it. Choose Insert > Image. 
Navigate to the images folder inside the fluidgrid folder and locate the ou_logo.png file. 
Click Open (Mac OS) or OK (Windows). Type logo in the Alternate Text field, and then 
click OK. 
You just added the image to a “Fluid Grid Layout Div Tag.” Dreamweaver always adds a 
Fluid Grid Layout Div Tag to your page when you start a new Fluid Grid Layout. You can 
add new ones to your page as needed.
3.	 Click the edge of the header div if necessary to make sure it is selected. Then, in the Insert 
panel, click the Insert Fluid Grid Layout Div Tag object; a dialog box appears. Make sure 
that the Start new row check box is selected, type introcontent, and then click OK.
A new fluid grid layout div appears below the header. Select the placeholder text and then 
press delete to remove it.
4.	 In your files panel, double-click the intro_content.html document. Select everything 
on the page by pressing Cmd+A (Mac OS) or Ctrl+A (Windows) and then copy it. Toggle 
back to your index page, click inside the introcontent div, and press Cmd+V (Mac OS) or 
Ctrl+V (Windows) to paste it (Figure 15-22).

copy it. Toggle back to your index page, click inside the secondarycontent div, and press 
Cmd+V (Mac OS) or Ctrl+V (Windows) to paste it.
7.	 Click the edge of your secondarycontent div to select it. Then, in the Insert panel, click the 
Insert Fluid Grid Layout Div Tag object; a dialog box appears. Type events and click OK.
8.	 In your files panel, double-click the events.html document. Select everything on the 
page by pressing Cmd+A (Mac OS) or Ctrl+A (Windows) and then copy it. Toggle back 
to your index page, click inside the events div, and press Cmd+V (Mac OS) or Ctrl+V 
(Windows) to paste it (Figure 15-23).
Figure 15-23: The events fluid grid layout div is located below secondarycontent.
9.	 Click the edge of your events div to select it. Then, in the Insert panel, click the Insert 
Fluid Grid Layout Div Tag object; a dialog box appears. Type footer and click OK. You’ll 
leave the placeholder content in here for now.
10.	 Within the secondarycontent div, click below the heading “Celebrate Vegetables.” Choose 
Insert > Image. Navigate to your images folder, select beets_fluid.jpg, and click Open 
(Mac OS) or OK (Windows). Type beets in the Alternate Text field and click OK. The 
image is inserted below the heading as seen in Figure 15-24.

11.	 Choose File > Save All.
This is the foundation of a mobile layout. There is much more you could do in regards to 
styling, but now that you have a basic layout with content, you’ll take a look at the way 
Fluid Grid Layouts work with additional layouts.
Creating a tablet layout
You have seen the three views that are part of Fluid Grid layouts, and you just created a simple 
single-column layout for a mobile device. Note that Dreamweaver created styles for the mobile 
view, the tablet view, and the desktop view. In fact, it has placed these styles in three separate 
media queries (one for mobile, one for tablet, one for desktop). You’ll now modify your mobile 
layout so that it is better suited for a tablet device.
Follow these steps to create a tablet layout
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the Tablet Size icon to switch to this view. As you begin adjusting the layout to two 
columns, keep in mind that the new styles will only apply to the tablet layout.
2.	 Click the edge of the introcontent div to select it and place your cursor on the anchor 
point located on the right of the div. Click and drag to the left to begin resizing the 
container as seen in Figure 15-25.
Figure 15-25: Resize a fluid grid div by clicking and dragging the right edge.
Note as you drag that the indicator shows you the width and how many columns you 
have. Drag until you reach three columns and approximately 35% width.
3.	 Click the edge of the secondarycontent div to select it and notice on the top-right corner 
there is an arrow. Hover over this for a moment, and the tool tip indicates the arrow will 
move the edge up a row. Click the arrow; notice that the edge doesn’t shift position. This 
is because you need to resize the div in order to fit in the space above.
4.	 Place your cursor on the resize anchor point (on the right edge of the div) and drag to the 
left. When the div width reaches five columns, it will jump up into the space above. Keep 
resizing the div until it is four columns wide.

Lesson 15
439
Lesson 15: Mobile Design and Layout 
The rise of the mobile web
5.	 Now place your cursor on the anchor point on the left edge of this div and wait for the 
tooltip. This indicates that it will shift the div. Click and drag to the right until the right 
edge of the div snaps to the furthest column as seen in Figure 15-26.
Figure 15-26: Resize a fluid grid div by clicking and dragging the right edge.
At this point, you have the basics of a two-column layout, but for the tablet view only.
6.	 Click the Mobile Size icon to switch back to this view; note that the mobile layout has 
remained in its single-column view. Click the Tablet Size icon to see the two-column 
view you just created, and then click the Desktop view. This view is still using the single- 
column layout; it has not been affected by the changes made in the Tablet view.
7.	 Choose File > Save All to save your work, but keep this document open. In the next 
exercise, you will build a three-column layout for the desktop.
Creating a three-column fluid layout for the desktop
In keeping with the mobile first philosophy, the desktop is the last design you will work on.
Follow these steps to create a three-column fluid layout
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the Desktop view icon if you are not currently in this view.
2.	 Click the edge of the introcontent div to select it, and place your cursor on the anchor 
point located on the right of the div. Click and drag to the left to begin resizing the 
container. Resize this div until you reach three columns.
3.	 Click the edge of the secondarycontent div to select it and click the arrow on the top right. 
This will attempt to move the div up a row, but because it is too wide, you have to resize 
it in order to fit in the space above.

Lesson 15
4.	 Place your cursor on the anchor point located on the right of the div and drag it to the left. 
When the div is narrow enough, it will jump up into the space above. Continue resizing the 
div until it snaps to four columns (Figure 15-27), which is a width of approximately 38.7%.
Figure 15-27: Resize a fluid grid div by clicking and dragging the right edge.
5.	 Click the edge of the events div to select it, and click the arrow at the top right to move 
it up a row. As with the other divs, you need to resize it in order to fit into the available 
space.
6.	 Place your cursor on the anchor point located on the right side of the div and drag to 
the left. When the div is narrow enough, it will jump up into the space above. Continue 
resizing the div until it snaps to three columns, which is a width of approximately 28.5%.
7.	 Choose File > Save All. At this point you have the foundations of a fluid and adaptive 
layout.

Lesson 15

Lesson 15: Mobile Design and Layout 
The rise of the mobile web
8.	 Click the Live button to see your layout in the Live View (Figure 15-28). When using 
Fluid Grid Layouts, the Live View behaves a bit differently. Typically, the Live View acts 
as a web browser and only allows you to view your content, not edit it. However, you can 
see that the Visual Aids are still visible. Additionally, if you click the edge of any of your 
divs, it will become active and you can then adjust their size or shift them as needed.
Figure 15-28: In the Live view, the Fluid Grid layout is still visible and the layout divs can be adjusted as well.
If you need to see your layout in action, the browser is still the best place.
9.	 Choose File > Preview in Browser; your page will load in the three column layout view 
(most likely). Slowly reduce the width of your web browser and note how the columns 
of text begin to resize. This is the “fluid” part of fluid layouts: because your columns are 
defined by percentages, not pixels, this is the expected behavior. At the same time, the 
amount of space between these columns also remains proportional.
10.	 Keep reducing the width of the browser; it will eventually switch to the two-column 
layout. Continue reducing the width of the browser until it switches to the single-column 
Mobile layout.

The rise of the mobile web
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
442
Lesson 15
11.	 Continue resizing your browser window back and forth between the three views, and pay 
particular attention to the image in the middle column (Figure 15-29). This image is also 
fluid; in other words, it will resize according to how much space it has available. This is 
most obvious in the single-column mobile view.
Figure 15-29: The images added to your layout will be fluid or responsive by default.
This fluid image behavior is actually made possible by the inclusion of the boilerplate.css 
support file that all Fluid Grid Layouts include by default. (You saw these dependent files 
created in step 1 of the first exercise.)
12.	 Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver. You will now take a look at how to style 
your pages.
Looking deeper into the dependent files
When you create a fluid grid layout, the two dependent files that are created are 
boilerplate.css and respond.js. For the most part, you will not touch any of these files. If 
you are familiar with what they do and need to modify them, you can.
boilerplate.css: This is a popular framework for modern websites that has been 
customized and modified for Dreamweaver’s fluid grid layout documents. Essentially, 
you can think of this as a well-tested and documented CSS reset file that pays 
special attention to the formatting of page styles in older browsers and supports 
some of the newer media query features. For detailed information on this page, visit 
http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/The-style/.
respond.min.js: This external JavaScript file provides support for CSS3 media queries 
in web browsers that do not support them natively. For detailed information on what this 
code does, visit https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond.

Lesson 15: Mobile Design and Layout 
The rise of the mobile web
Styling elements in your fluid grid layout
The layout you created is fairly minimal at the moment. The method of creating and applying 
styles is not new when working with Fluid Grids; however, there is added complexity you have 
to take into account. Remember that every time you create a style, it is not just created in one 
place, but three. To see how to manage this, you’ll style the header of your page.
Follow these steps to style elements in a fluid grid layout
Step-by-Step
1.	 Click the Mobile size icon to view your single-column layout.
2.	 Look within your CSS Styles Panel and click the All tab, if necessary. Expand the base.
css external style sheet to see all the rules. You might also need to expand the All Rules 
section of the panel as seen in Figure 15-30.
Figure 15-30: The list of rules within your base.css style.
3.	 Starting at the top of the list, scroll down until you find the first #header style. After you 
locate it, keep scrolling down the list to find a second #header rule. Continue scrolling 
down through the list to find the third #header style.
Although it is not immediately obvious, the first header rule sets the style for the mobile 
styles, the second header sets the style for the tablet, and the third header rule sets the style 
for the desktop.

The rise of the mobile web
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification

Lesson 15
3.	 Double-click the first #header rule. In the CSS Rule definition window, click the 
background category. In the Background-color field, type #b1d564 as seen in Figure 15-31. 
This is the same shade of green as the background color of the organic utopia logo. Click 
OK to apply it.
Figure 15-31: Applying a background color to the header.
4.	 In the Design view, note that your header is now the same color as the background. Click 
the Tablet and Desktop views, and note that they have inherited the same background color.
Generally, this is not a problem since you don’t want to style the header three different 
times. However, there might be times when you do want the style of an element to be 
different in your tablet or desktop views.
5.	 In your CSS styles panel, double-click the second #header style (the one for the tablet). 
Click the background category, then click the Background-color swatch, and then choose 
a dark red (the exact shade is not important). Click OK.
This header style is now specific only to the Tablet view. Click the Tablet view to see it.

Skill Summary
6.	 Choose File > Save All, and then preview your page in the browser. Resize your browser 
window until it switches to the tablet view layout. You will see the background color of 
the header change (Figure 15-32).
Figure 15-32: The header in your tablet view has a different background color style.
Typically, you wouldn’t change the background color style of a header. This exercise was 
just a demonstration of how to apply styles for specific layouts.
7.	 Close your browser and return to Dreamweaver. Double-click the second #header rule 
in the CSS Styles panel, click the background color property, and remove the color you 
added in Step 5. Click OK.
8.	 Choose File > Save All to finish the lesson.

Introduction
Before starting, make sure that your tools and panels are consistent by resetting your workspace. 
See “Resetting the Dreamweaver workspace” in the Starting Up section of this book.
You will work with several files from the dw16lessons lesson folder in this lesson. Make sure 
that you have downloaded the dwlessons onto your hard drive.
Creating a remote connection and publishing files to the Web
You’ve already used the Files panel throughout this book to locate and open files within your 
site projects. In addition to serving as a useful file browser, the Files panel also serves as a 
full-featured file transfer application and synchronization tool. From the Files panel, you can 
upload your site to a web server, synchronize local and remote files, and manage files and notes 
between multiple designers.

Creating a remote connection and publishing files to the Web
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
452
Lesson 16
Establishing a remote connection
The Files panel uploads, retrieves, and synchronizes files between your local site and a web 
server. Typically, this is done using File Transfer Protocol (FTP), which connects to and allows 
interaction between your local machine and a web server (there are other options as well, 
including SFTP, WebDav, and more). Before you can transfer files, you’ll first need to establish 
a remote connection to the web server that stores your website files. A remote connection is 
a method used to enable the upload and download of files to and from your web server, using 
Dreamweaver.
Take Note...
You will not be able to proceed with this portion of the lesson if you do not have FTP 
information available for a web server. If you do not have this information or do not have a 
connection to the Internet, you can choose to read through the steps or skip to the Testing Site 
Integrity exercise in this lesson.
Before you start this lesson, make sure you have the following:
• The FTP address of the web server and specific directory. This would be provided 
by your web-hosting provider as part of your account details, or from your company or 
organization’s IT department. A typical FTP address looks like ftp.mysite.com.
• A user login and password for access to the server. Most web servers require a user 
login and password for access. This information should be available from your web-hosting 
provider as part of your account details, or from your organization’s IT department.
• The specific directory to which your files should be uploaded. In many cases, this is 
the main directory or folder that appears when you connect to your web server. However, in 
certain cases, you’ll need to upload files to a specific directory other than the main directory.
• The web address (URL) or IP address where you can view your uploaded files 
on the server. Sample addresses would be www.mysite.com/, www.mysite.com/2007/, or 
http://100.0.0.1.
Web server connection options 
FTP is still the default choice in Dreamweaver CS6; however, FTP is an aging protocol. 
Many people are wary of security concerns related to FTP because data sent over FTP is 
not encrypted.
SFTP stands for “SSH File Transfer Protocol” and represents a more secure version of 
FTP.
FTP over SSL/TLS is another more secure version of FTP that relies on encryption. 
For this option, a server must have previously been specifically set up as trusted.
Local/Network allows you to define a remote folder on a network drive you may be 
connected to. Depending on the setup, this network may or may not also be connected 
to the Internet
WebDav is a technology that allows file access to a remote server. It is often used 
collaboratively with multiple users allowed access to the same file system.
RDS is a security component of ColdFusion Server that permits users to access files and 
databases through a remote HTTP connection.

Certain servers may require a passive FTP connection to connect successfully. If you are certain 
your FTP information is correct, but experience a long delay or failure when connecting, check 
the Use Passive FTP checkbox in the Advanced tab, Remote Info category, and try again.

Viewing files on a remote web server
A remote web server is a location where site files are hosted so that people can view them 
online. Once you’ve established a connection to your web server, you can expand the Files 
panel for a split view that displays both your remote and local files. You can easily drag and 
drop between both sides to upload or download files and update existing files.

Follow these steps to transfer files to and from the server
Step-by-Step
The built-in FTP and file transfer functionality of the Files panel makes it a snap to place files 
on your remote server or download files onto your local machine. This can be accomplished 
using the Get and Put buttons, or by dragging and dropping files between the Remote and 
Local file listings in the Files panel. Please note again, this exercise involves publishing your 
sample documents to a remote server, and therefore publishing them to the Internet; be very 
careful not to overwrite any pre-existing files that may be crucial to your website.
1.	 Make sure you’ve connected to the remote server as described in the previous exercise, and 
that you can see your remote files in the left-hand column of the Files panel.

when asked if you would like to include dependent files.
Figure 16-6: Select a file and click the Put button to upload it to the remote server.
Take Note...
When you transfer a document between a local and remote folder, a window may open, 
offering you the option of transferring the document’s dependent files. Dependent files are 
images, external style sheets, and other files referenced in your document that a browser loads 
when it loads the document. This feature can be very useful: think of it as a way to make 
sure that any files which are linked to a particular document come along for the ride, however, 
for the purposes of this exercise, it will be unnecessary to transfer dependent files.

Using Check In/Check Out and Design Notes
Using Check In/Check Out and Design Notes
If you’re collaborating with others on a project, you’ll want to set up an environment where 
everyone can edit files independently without overlapping or overwriting someone else’s work. 
For these situations, the Check In/Out and Design Notes features can help you to manage 
workflow and communicate with others on a Dreamweaver site project.
Check In and Check Out
Dreamweaver’s Check In/Check Out feature is a way of letting others know that you are 
working on a file and don’t want it disturbed. When Check In/Check Out is enabled, a 
document that you’re editing becomes locked on the remote server to prevent others from 
modifying the same file at the same time. If you attempt to open a file that’s been checked 
out by another user, you see a warning that lets you know that the file is in use and who is 
currently working with it. Check In/Check Out doesn’t require any additional software to 
run, and other Dreamweaver users can check out files if they also have Check In/Check Out 
enabled in their site definition. 
Take Note...
The Check In/Check Out system does not work with a testing server. To transfer files to 
and from a testing server (if one is set up), use the standard Get and Put commands.
Follow these steps to enable Check In/Check Out
1.	 Choose Site > Manage Sites. Select the Dreamweaver site that you want to enable 
Check In/Check Out for and choose Edit.
2.	 In the Site Setup window, click on the Servers button, then select your site and click on 
the pencil icon at the bottom to edit the server settings.
3.	 Click on the Advanced button and then click on the Enable file check-out checkbox.
4.	 Type your name and e-mail, as you see in Figure 16-8. This information will appear to 
other Dreamweaver users who attempt to retrieve a file that you have checked out. Press 
Save and then press Save again to exit.
Figure 16-8: Enable check in/check out in the Site Definition panel to manage workflow between several users.
Step-by-Step

Checking files in and out
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
460
Lesson 16
What is Check In and Check Out? 
Dreamweaver creates a lock (LCK) file for every document that is checked out; this basic 
text file contains the name and e-mail address of the user who has checked out the file. 
LCK files are written to both the remote server and local folder using the same name as 
the active file. When files are checked back in, the LCK files are deleted from both the 
remote server and local folder.
Although LCK files are not visible in the Files panel, they work behind the scenes to let 
Dreamweaver know what’s checked out and what isn’t. Checked-out files appear on both 
the local and remote file listings with a check mark next to them. Note that a colleague 
not using Dreamweaver can potentially overwrite a file that’s checked out—however, 
LCK files are visible in applications other than Dreamweaver, and their appearance alone 
can help avoid any overwriting issues.
Take Note...
A user will be allowed to override your lock and switch checkout status to themselves. Make 
sure you establish rules with others about how to share and manage locked files.
Checking files in and out
When you check a file out, you are downloading it from the remote server to your local root 
folder, and placing a lock on the remote copy. Both your local copy and the remote copy 
appear with check marks next to them, which indicates that the file is currently checked out 
for editing. When you check a file back in, you are uploading the modified version to the 
remote server, and removing any locks currently on it.
Follow these steps to checking out a file  
Step-by-Step
1.	 Launch the Files panel and click the Expand button to expand it so that you can see both 
your local and remote files listed, as you see in Figure 16-9. 
2.	 Select the file in your local folder that you want to check out, and use the Check Out 
button (
) at the top of the panel.

Note that Dreamweaver overwrites your local copy of the file, as it needs to get the remote 
file from the server. The local and remote versions of the file appear with check marks 
next to them in the Files panel. 
Figure 16-9: Check files out before modifying them so other users won’t accidentally overwrite your work.
3.	 Open the checked file from your Local Files panel for editing. Make any necessary changes 
to the file, then save and close it.
4.	 From the Files panel, select the file again in the local Files panel and check it back in, using 
the Check In button (
) at the top of the panel. The file is uploaded to—and unlocked 
on—the remote server. 
Take Note...
When you transfer a document between a local and remote folder, a window may open 
offering you the option of transferring the document’s dependent files. Dependent files are 
images, external style sheets, and other files referenced in your document that a browser 
loads when it loads the document. For this exercise, it won’t be necessary for you to transfer 
dependent files.
Your local copy becomes read-only, and appears with a padlock icon next to it. Next time 
you open the file for editing, Dreamweaver will automatically check out and get the latest 
copy from the server.
5.	 Collapse the Files panel to return it to the dock.

Using Design Notes
Introduction to Adobe Dreamweaver CS6 using ACA Certification
462
Lesson 16
Using Design Notes
Design Notes store additional information about a file or media object in your Dreamweaver 
site. These notes can be for your own use, or they can be shared with others using the same 
root folder. Design Notes can be set to appear automatically when the file is opened, making 
it easy to display up-to-date information to others working on the same site. All Design Notes 
are stored as separate files in a _notes folder inside of your site’s root directory.
What can be put in Design Notes?
Design Notes can contain any information that is important to the file or project; you can store 
design instructions, updates about the project, or contact information for project managers and 
supervisors. You can also store sensitive information that you ideally would not want in the 
file itself, such as the name of the last designer to work on the file or the location of important 
assets. You can even set the status of the file to indicate what stage of the revision the file is in.
Follow these steps to create a Design Note
Step-by-Step
1.	 To create a Design Note, under the Files panel, open the store.html file from the current 
site. 
2.	 Choose File > Design Notes. The Design Notes dialog box appears.
3.	 Type a message in the Notes field. If you wanted to insert the current date stamp, you 
could click the Calendar button ( ) above the Notes field. If you want the note displayed 
when the file is next opened, check Show when file is opened.
The Status menu is used to set the document status; this can be useful in letting other 
collaborators know the revision stage of the current document.
4.	 Press OK to create the Design Note.
To view a Design Note, choose File > Design Notes when a file is open in the document 
window. As mentioned earlier, you can also choose to have Design Notes automatically 
appear when the file is first opened.
Take Note...
Design Notes can also be created or viewed directly from the Files panel; right-click 
(Windows) or Ctrl + click (Mac OS) a document in the files list and choose Design Notes 
from the contextual menu.

Testing site integrity
Catching potential issues on a page before your visitors do is key to ensuring success from the 
start. Broken links, display issues, or unreadable pages can make the difference between a great 
first impression and a poor one. To look for and address problems before you publish your site, 
Dreamweaver provides many useful tools that can point out potential hazards and, in some 
cases, help you find the solution.
Using Check Links
The Check Links feature detects any broken links between pages in your local site and will 
identify orphaned files that are not linked to or used by any document within the site. 
Follow these steps to check links on a page
Step-by-Step
1.	 From the Files panel, double-click and open the index.html document.
2.	 Choose File > Check Page > Links, as you see in Figure 16-12.

6.	 Close the Link Checker panel by right-clicking (Windows) Ctrl+clicking (Mac OS) the 
Link Checker tab and choosing Close Tab Group. Save and close the current document.
Checking links sitewide
Check Links can be used on a single document, multiple documents (through the Files panel), 
or an entire local site at once.
Follow these steps to check Links site-wide
Step-by-Step
1.	 Choose Site > Check Links Sitewide.
2.	 The Link Checker panel appears, as shown in Figure 16-14. By default, any broken 
links are displayed. All the broken links here are referencing the same incorrect link to 
category_books_cds.html. This could have happened if you or a collaborator on the site 
changed the name of the file within the operating system or another web editor.
Figure 16-14: Choose Site > Check Links Sitewide to check for broken links throughout the  
current local site. The Link Checker panel opens and displays any broken links found.
3.	 To view external links, choose External Links from the Show drop-down menu at the top 
of the panel. This site will have none, but any links to outside web pages that you have on 
your site would be listed.
Take Note...
External links are displayed, but aren’t validated by Dreamweaver. The Link Checker can 
only validate links between local documents and files.
4.	 To view orphaned files, choose Orphaned Files from the Show drop-down menu at the 
top of the panel. In this site, a number of files will appear. Orphaned files are files that are 
not currently being linked to in your site. This may include stray multimedia files that 
have not been added to a page yet. You will not be doing anything with these files at this 
moment. 
5.	 Choose Broken Links from the Show drop-down menu to return to the broken links 
report. Click on the first of the broken links shown to edit it. Click on the folder icon and 
browse through your site folder to locate the category_bookscds.html file. Select this 
file, press OK and then press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS).

open the files to make the changes!
Link Checker results
If and when the Link Checker returns results, you can jump to any problem document to 
view and fix any issues. The Link Checker panel’s Show menu (located at the top of the 
panel) toggles between three different Link Checker reports: Broken Links, Orphaned 
Files, and External Links.
Broken Links lists links that point to files not found within the local site. To jump to 
a page that contains a broken link, double-click the filename shown in the left column 
of the Link Checker panel. To correct a link directly from the Link Checker panel, click 
the link shown under the Broken Links column of the panel to edit it. Type in the proper 
page name or use the folder to browse to the proper file. If you edit a broken link this 
way, Dreamweaver can apply the same correction throughout other pages on your site.
Orphaned Files are any pages, images, or media files not linked to, referenced, or used 
by any files in your site. This report can be useful in identifying unused files that can be 
cleaned up from the local site, or pages that should be linked to (like a site map) but were 
overlooked.
External Links lists any links to outside websites, pages, or files; and like the Broken 
Links panel, allows you to directly edit them or jump to the page that contains them. It’s 
important to note, however, that Dreamweaver does not validate external links—you 
will still be responsible for double-checking these links on your own. You’ll also notice 
that e-mail (mailto:) links are included in this list.

Understanding report results
At first glance, you may be overwhelmed at the amount of information returned by site 
reports. Keep in mind that many of the listings returned are recommendations or possible 
issues that should be looked into, not necessarily items that will prevent a site from working. 
Learning to read these site reports a little more closely will enable you to decide which items 
are crucial to your site’s performance, requiring immediate action. Listings are displayed with 
three distinct icons. 
Icon
Name
Use
Question Mark
These listings suggest possible accessibility issues that should be 
investigated. Many of these issues have a reference to a specific W3C/
WCAG guideline.
Red X
These listings indicate a failure to meet a certain guideline or 
requirement. Possible listings could include missing header 
information, deprecated HTML markup, or page titles that are not 
defined properly.
Warning Sign
Warnings indicate missing information that may be potentially 
detrimental to a site’s performance, such as missing ALT text for 
images.
To further familiarize yourself with the specifics of accessibility reports you can consult the 
Checklist of Checkpoints for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Published by the W3C  
this is large checklist of accesibility features that you can use as a guideline for your sites. 
There are three levels of priorities: Priority 1 are features that must be satisified, Priority 2 are 
features that should be satisfied and Priority 3 are features that could be satisfied. For a full 
listing of the checklist visit:

Using Site Reports
Although the value of site reports increases with larger websites, features such as the Link 
Checker are one of the main reasons that Dreamweaver is used in a production workflow. 
Without this feature, identifying broken links would be extremely time-consuming. In 
addition, because Dreamweaver allows you to fix any broken links without needing to 
open the pages, even more time is saved.
Addressing a listed item
After you’ve sifted through the report results, you’ll want to use the Results panel to address 
items listed in the Site Reports tab.

about the issue found.
The Description column shows that an image on this page is missing the ALT attribute 
and alternate text. This attribute can potentially affect accessibility of your site; you don’t 
need to fix it, but we highly recommend you do.
2.	 Double-click the store.html listing to open the page for editing. Your document window

Although accessibility has come a long way since the beginning of the Web, it still has 
a long way to go. Although Dreamweaver’s site reports help identify areas of your page 
that can be read by screen readers, much of this information is gathered by experience (alt 
tags, headers, page titles, and captions for example, are all read by screen readers).

development and is known as the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (WAI-
ARIA for short). One portion of the specification, called landmark roles, is specifically 
designed to be used with HTML and XHTML elements. A landmark role is a way of 
categorizing and identifying different parts of a web page. For example, a role called 
banner identifies the region that contains the primary heading of the page. You can add 
this role as an attribute for the HTML5 <header> element, for example:
<header role="banner">
Some of the landmark roles have direct equivalents to HTML elements. For example, the 
role="form" attribute is used for form elements and the role="navigation" is used for 
the HTML5 <nav> element. You can use landmark roles today, but you might need to review 
your code in the future to ensure that it is aligned with the specification when it is finalized.
You can learn more about WAI-ARIA and landmark roles here:
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/usage#usage_intro
http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/
The aria-practices page above also includes sample code and best practices for adding 
landmark roles into your web pages.
Specific techniques for addressing usability
Throughout this book we have attempted to point out cases where Dreamweaver paves the 
way for improving accessibility. For example, by now you should be aware of how inserting 
an image onto a page will always trigger the Image Tag Accessibility Attributes window and 
remind you to add an Alt tag. However, a full commitment to making your pages accessible to 
as many users as possible requires a lot of work. Here are some of the techniques to consider:
• Have a good sense of which elements of a web page are not read or could be confusing for 
someone using a screen readers such as graphics without alt tags, hyperlinks without title 
attributes, text that is embedded as an image, imagemaps, buttons and rich media such as 
Flash, video or sound.
Take Note...
For more information on Screen Reader Compatibility visit  
http://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/
• Although there are certain default keyboard conventions (such as pressing the Tab key 
to navigate from field to field) you can control the order in which fields are activated by 
changing the tab index value in the dialog box for form elements.
• CSS fonts and CSS3 web fonts. This issue is covered in multiple locations throughut the book, 
but essentially the guidelines are to use only the most common web fonts if using standard 
CSS and to be aware of browser compatibility for the latest CSS3 web fonts functionality.

Lesson 16
The Browser Compatibility Check 
When you format page content or create layouts with CSS, you’ll want to be certain that 
your pages appear consistently across a variety of browsers. Some combinations of HTML and 
CSS can unearth some nasty display bugs in specific browsers. In fact, some browsers may not 
support certain CSS properties at all. To seek out and fix any potential CSS display problems, 
you’ll use Dreamweaver’s Browser Compatibility Check (BCC) reports in conjunction with 
the CSS Advisor.
Optimizing pages for launch
Although page optimization is discussed at this point in the book, it is by no means an 
afterthought. A big part of preparing a site for success involves making it accessible to users 
with special needs, such as those who are visually impaired, or preparing it for indexing by 
various search engines. In addition to clean design and well-written content, pages can be 
optimized through the use of keywords, descriptions, and often-overlooked tag attributes, such 
as alternate text (alt) for images and a page’s Title area. Combined, these pieces of information 
facilitate site usability and visibility in several essential ways. 
Search engine visibility and Search Engine Optimization 
A big part of a website’s success stems from its visibility. Visibility comes through good 
advertising, networking with other sites, and, above all, proper indexing and listings on the 
Web’s major search engines. Search engines can be a key to generating business and visits to your 
site, but only if your website can be easily found. Major search engines such as Google (which 
powers AOL, MySpace, and Netscape searches), Yahoo! (which powers AltaVista and others), 
and LiveSearch (formerly MSN Search) use a variety of factors to index and generate listings for 
websites. Many of these factors start at home, or more appropriately, on your home page.
Titling your documents with the <title> tag
Each document’s head area contains a <title> tag, which Dreamweaver automatically inserts 
with any new HTML/XHTML document. At its most basic, the <title> tag sets a display 
title for a page in the browser window. You can modify the <title> tag contents using the 
Title text field that sits at the top of your document window. By default, each new document is 
issued the default title of Untitled Document. The <title> tag and its contents, however, can 
be a powerful and effective way to assist search engines in indexing your page.
What makes a good title?
A good document title ideally should include keywords that describe your site’s main 
service, locale, and category of business or information. In addition to the obvious—your 
company’s name—think about the categories you would want your site to appear under on 
a web directory or as the result of a web search. For instance, the McKnight Institute would 
ideally want users looking for science museums or exhibits in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 
area to find them first. A possible title could be: The McKnight Institute: Science Museum, 
Educational Exhibits and Attractions, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Optimizing pages for launch
This title contains several important keywords that describe the Institute’s offerings, and 
features the Institute’s name and location. In addition, reshuffling these phrases and words 
produces several other search terms that could be beneficial to the Institute, such as:
• Science Exhibits
• Philadelphia Museum
• Pennsylvania Attractions
Take Note...
Avoid the rookie mistake of including only your company name in the document title. 
Remember, web searchers who haven’t used your business before will only search by terms 
that apply to the service they are seeking (for example, wedding photographers, Washington, 
D.C.). Even the most recognized names on the Web such as eBay and Amazon, include 
generic search terms in their page titles.
Follow these steps to add a title to your web page 
Step-by-Step
1.	 From the Files panel, select and open the index.html document to open it for editing.
2.	 Locate the Title text field at the top of the document window, as shown in Figure 16-20. 
It currently displays the default title of Untitled Document. Select its contents and 
type The McKnight Institute: Science Museum, Educational Exhibits and 
Attractions, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and press Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Mac OS).

4.	 Note, in Figure 16-21, that the title now appears in the bar at the top of the browser 
window. Close the browser window and return to Dreamweaver.
Figure 16-21: The most basic purpose of the <title> tag is to display a title at the top of the browser window. If used properly,  
it can also be used as a powerful hook for search engines.
Take Note...
While there is technically no limit to title length, the W3C’s Web Consortium Accessibility 
Guide recommends that page titles be a maximum of 64 characters to be considered “well-
defined.” Titles exceeding this length may generate warnings in the Site Reports Results 
panel. Longer titles may also appear truncated (cut off) when displayed in some browser 
windows.
What determines the Bookmark or Favorite name?
It’s common for users to bookmark a site or specific page they’ve found so that they can 
easily return to it. Every browser has a bookmark feature, which allows users to mark 
and display favorite sites in an organized list; sometimes, favorite sites are listed in a 
Bookmarks bar in the browser window.
The document title determines the text that appears with a bookmark, so it’s important 
to consider this when creating a good document title. Using a vague or non-descriptive 
title (or even worse, the default Untitled Document text) can make it impossible for 
a user to remember which bookmark is yours. A good title appears as a descriptive 
bookmark in a browser’s Favorites list or Bookmarks bar.

Adding meta keywords and descriptions
While Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a broad topic that’s far beyond the scope of this 
book; good SEO methods begin at the design level. Search Engine Optimization is defined 
as the process of structuring the HTML and CSS code of your site in order to best expose the 
content to search engines. Search engines use a variety of factors to rank and list web pages. 
Keywords and descriptions can help specify the search terms that are associated with your site 
and how it’s listed. The HTML <meta> tag enables you to associate any page with a specific 
list of search terms, as well as a brief description of the page or the website itself. Like the 
<title> tag, <meta> tags are placed in the <head> section of a page, and can be added from 
the Common Insert bar on the right side of your workspace.
Follow these steps to add a keyword to your metatags 
Step-by-Step
1.	 If it’s not already open, choose File > Open and locate and open the index.html 
document for editing.
2.	 From the Common Insert bar, choose the Keywords button from the Head tags group.
3.	 When the Keywords window appears, as shown in Figure 16-22, add a comma-separated 
list of search keywords that you’d like associated with this page, or the site in general. 
While there is no general consensus on the limit of how many keywords you can use, 
common sense says that you should be able to categorize your site in roughly 20 keywords 
or fewer. For example, type museum, technology exhibits, attractions, family 
attractions, philadelphia, pennsylvania museums. Press Return (Windows) or Enter 
(Mac OS) to add the keywords.
FIgure 16-22: From the Common category of the Insert bar, choose the Keywords object from the Head tags group and enter  
a list of keywords in the resulting dialog box.
4.	 Now you’ll add a description that a search engine can use to summarize your page when 
creating a listing for it. Choose the Description button from the Head tags group on the 
Common Insert bar.

Launching your site
Before launching your site for the public—and to ensure that your site works at, and looks, its 
best—take a moment to go over this pre-flight checklist.
Site Launch Checklist
• Enter FTP or upload information and test your FTP connection.
• Check links sitewide and repair missing or broken links and images.
• Run site reports and address crucial issues. Put special emphasis on:
–– Missing document titles
–– Missing alt text
–– Invalid markup that may cause display issues
• Open the homepage (index.html, and so on) and navigate through your site, using menus, 
links in copy, and linked images to check page flow. Do this in several browsers, and, if 
possible, on both Windows and Macintosh platforms.
• View your home page and major section pages in a web browser in the three most common 
screen resolutions: 640 × 480, 800 × 600, and 1024 × 768. 
• If you created storyboards at the beginning of the design process pull these out again and 
check to make sure the final site reflects the user goals and workflow defined
Checking your site against storyboards
In Lesson 1, “Dreamweaver CS6 Jumpstart,” you learned about the role of storyboards in the 
planning stage of site design. A storyboard consists of number of pages that describe a site’s 
navigation, each pages may have a list of related links, a functional description of the page, 
images, text and some notes on content for that page. You can do a comparison of your final 
website to the storyboard by using it as a checklist of sorts. Does the functionality and content 
of the final site reflect the functionality and content of the storyboard? If not, then why not? 
Was the content removed (or never delivered?) In the end, if the storyboards were well thought 
out, this step is a good measure of success. Were you able to include all the features you had 
originally planned? Maybe you ended up adding more, in which case you should ask for a raise!

Browser testing
A web browser is a program that renders HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files according to a set of rules 
built into the application. Although web browser manufacturers use the recommended guidelines 
of the Word Wide Web Consortium’s specifications for HTML and CSS, they can interpet these 
rules as required for their own purposes. Browser manufacturers can also add their own rules to the 
specifications to add features to their browsers that are not available in others. 
Throughout this book we have attempted to stay away from techniques that result in web page 
elements that may not look the same on different browsers and operating systems (or at least make 
it clear what the differences are and how to account for this). Here is a quick review of the page 
elements that are historically worth investigating:
• Form elements that have no styling look different on Mac versus PC. Controls such as 
buttons and scrollbars will use the operating system’s default user interface. To a certain 
extent, CSS styles can standardize most of these controls.
• Rich media such as audio and video is dependent on the capabilities of the operating system 
and therefore may either use a different user interface for controls (such as a volume slider) 
or may simply not appear. Media that depends on a plug-in for functionality (such as Flash 
and/or Flash video) may not have support in the mobile environment.
• CSS styles that are not supported in specific browsers. There are a number of CSS selectors 
or properties that do not work consistently across all browsers, although Dreamweaver’s 
browser compatibility reports can help identify these, the ultimate test is to check your pages 
in multiple browsers.
• CSS fonts and CSS3 web fonts. This issue is covered in multiple locations throughut the 
book, but essentially the guidelines are to use only the most common web fonts if using 
standard CSS and to be aware of browser compatibility for the latest CSS3 web fonts 
functionality.
Adobe BrowserLab
No matter how thorough your knowledge is of the various web page elements that might look 
different in different browsers, the ultimate test is to check for yourself. Typically, this is accomplished 
by using a separate machine than the one you have been working on. If you develop on a Mac, you 
can a use a PC and vice-versa. The problem with this approach is that it does not cover all the bases. 
It is impractical to have multiple browsers (and multiple versions of these browsers) on a machine.
This is where Adobe Browserlab enters the picture.  Adobe BrowserLab is an online service that you 
can use as a stand-alone product or in conjunction with Adobe applications, such as Dreamweaver 
CS6. BrowserLab lets you preview your page in a number of different browsers and platforms, so 
you are not limited to Mac or PC. 
1.	 Open a page you would like to test in multiple browsers. Open the Adobe BrowserLab 
panel if it is not currently open.
2.	 Click on the Preview button. BrowserLab is an online service that Adobe provides and the 
first time you use it you will have to enter an Adobe ID and password (or create one if you 
haven’t already). Because the service requires your pages to be uploaded to Adobe’s server, 
you will have to give permission for this by clicking Accept (Or Deny if you do not wish 
to give permission).

Site feedback and testing
Congratulations on launching your first Dreamweaver site project! There’s nothing more 
exciting than having your hard work on the Web, and available for the world to see. The 
important thing to remember is that your website should not be static; part of maintaining a 
successful website requires continuously evolving it to meet the needs of your viewers, and 
keeping the content fresh and new.
Whether your site is for business, pleasure, or self-promotion, be sure to solicit feedback from 
friends, family, and colleagues after you’ve launched. Alert a small and trusted group about the 
launch by sending out an e-mail, mailing a postcard, or posting a notice on a blog (sometimes 
this is referred to as the ‘beta’ stage). Feedback and constructive criticism (a little praise is okay, 
too) are the best ways to objectively know what needs improvement. You’ll probably receive 
more feedback and suggestions than you can handle, so focus on points that are common across 
multiple users, and address any major issues before making a more public launch (for instance, 
to your entire client base).

Focus on focus groups
Focus groups are an excellent way to get non-biased feedback on a major new site or product 
launch, and they have been a regular practice in product marketing and research for years. 
A focus group is composed of a group of individuals who are brought together to analyze, 
try out, and comment on a specific product—in this case, your website—for the purpose of 
obtaining feedback and testing the product’s effectiveness. 
Groups can be guided through certain portions or processes on the site, or may be encouraged 
to navigate it on their own. Afterwards, they are polled with specific questions about 
their experience, and the results are put together to form a picture of the site’s usability, 
effectiveness, and impact. This may include questions such as the following:
• Did you feel the website was easy to navigate? On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate 
the difficulty level in locating specific pages or topics?
• Did the design, including graphics and color themes, effectively help communicate the 
website’s offerings?
• On a scale from 1 to 10, how would you rate the quality of the written content on the site?
Focus groups are often interactive, encouraging participants to talk with each other and 
share their opinions. In some cases, a moderator may be used to regulate group discussions, 
and hand out questionnaires. Participants can be composed of a focused demographic group 
(for instance, 25- to 35-year-old technology professionals), or they can represent a diverse 
professional and demographic range.
Focus groups are reasonable for any size company to organize—even if it’s just you and five 
friends—and are a highly effective way to find out what’s currently working and what’s not. 
Give it a try; you may find the results encouraging, surprising, or even slightly discouraging. 
The trick is to use this feedback wisely toward the main purpose of making a better website, 
and you’ll be glad you did.
Website design resources
There is a vast amount of information, and many tutorial-based websites, covering topics 
from web page standards to advanced CSS design. Here is a small sampling of some useful 
sites that can help you take your skills and knowledge further. Use these in conjunction with

Lesson 17: Dreamweaver CS6 New Features 
Business Case
Your performance review is coming up shortly, and one of the questions that will be 
asked is how you are keeping up with current technology. In order to answer this, 
you should have a familiarity with the latest features in Dreamweaver CS6.
What’s new in Dreamweaver CS6?
The version of Dreamweaver prior to CS6 was Dreamweaver CS5.5; the fact that Adobe 
released a “.5” version might indicate that Adobe is increasing the speed at which it releases 
updates. This increase in speed makes sense for a program such as Dreamweaver, due to the 
speed at which web technology evolves. In fact, most of the major additions in 5.5 were 
new features for the rapidly evolving landscape of mobile design, including the Multiscreen 
feature (with support for CSS3 media queries), support for jQuery mobile, and support for the 
development of iOS and Android applications using the Phonegap Framework, among others. 
Some of the new features in 5.5 have been integrated into the exercises in this book, most 
notably in Lesson 15, “Mobile Design and Layout.” However, given that many users might 
have upgraded directly to Dreamweaver CS6 from CS5, we cover the 5.5 features in a separate 
section at the end of this lesson.
Dreamweaver CS6 introduces three major new features: Fluid Grid Layout, CSS3 Transitions, 
and Web Font Integration. These features have also been integrated into some of the lessons 
in this book, primarily in Lesson 15, “Mobile Design and Layout” and Lesson 7, “CSS3 
Transitions and Web Fonts.” In addition to these major new features, there are a few upgrades 
to pre-existing features such as Business Catalyst, jQuery Mobile, and PhoneGap.

Lesson 17
Fluid Grid Layout
Dreamweaver’s new Fluid Grid Layout feature (Figure 17-1) is essentially a combination of 
two advanced layout techniques currently used by a number of web designers today: 1) a grid 
system; and 2) responsive web design. Grid systems have been a staple of print and web design 
for many years, and involve the designer using a “grid” structure (composed of rows and 
columns) on a page to make the aligning and grouping of content more structured. Responsive 
web design is a relatively new layout technique for the Web that allows page layout to respond 
or adapt based on the user’s screen size.
Figure 17-1: An empty Fluid Grid Layout page with its default columns.

Lesson 17
489
Lesson 17: Dreamweaver CS6 New Features 
What’s new in Dreamweaver CS6?
Fluid Grid Layout allows a designer or developer to build a new page with an empty grid, and 
then add Fluid Grid Layout Divs into which they can add content such as text and images. 
These layout containers are unique in that they snap to the grid columns (Figure 17-2), but just 
as importantly, you can also control the way the layout containers appear based on the size of 
the user’s screen. For example, you could create a five-column layout for users with extremely 
wide desktop monitors; and users with small screen sizes, such as mobile phones, would see just 
a single-column layout.
Figure 17-2: The Fluid Grid feature creates three layouts by default: one for mobile screens, one for tablets, and one for desktops.
The goal of Fluid Grids is to allow your website to respond or adapt to the user’s screen while 
maintaining the degree of structure and composition that a grid layout provides.

Lesson 17
CSS transitions
Dreamweaver CS6 has a new CSS Transitions feature that includes the ability to add animation 
effects to objects on your page. An example of a transition is a button that gradually changes 
color when the user hovers over it, known as a rollover effect (Figure 17-3). In previous 
versions of Dreamweaver, you had to use some form of JavaScript to create a rollover 
effect, perhaps even use one of the Spry effects (which are JavaScript). CSS Transitions in 
Dreamweaver are built with CSS3 syntax that allows you to set the duration, delay, and easing 
of many CSS properties, including background-color, opacity, font-size, and much more. 
Figure 17-3: CSS Transitions allow you to add effects, such as an animated navigation menu with fade effects.
One of the benefits of CSS Transitions is that you can create basic visual effects within 
Dreamweaver without JavaScript or Flash. A good use of transitions, for example, is to create a 
smooth fading effect on the user interface, such as menus.
Web fonts
Dreamweaver CS6 takes major steps toward addressing the lack of choice in fonts to use on 
the Web with the new Web Fonts feature (Figure 17-4). This feature takes advantage of the 
@font-face property in CSS3 to give Dreamweaver users a much easier way to add new 
fonts to their page. When you choose Modify > Web Fonts, the Web Fonts Manager appears, 
allowing you to link to any commercially-licensed web font you want to embed on your page.
Figure 17-4: Adding a web font to your site requires linking to the font files in your local folder.

Lesson 17
491
Lesson 17: Dreamweaver CS6 New Features 
PhoneGap Build Service
After you embed a specific web font on your page, you can easily apply the style of the font 
using the Property Inspector. The addition of web fonts in Dreamweaver means it is quite easy 
to add unique styles to page elements such as headings and still maintain the benefits of CSS 
(Figure 17-5).
Figure 17-5: A heading with a Web Font style applied.
jQuery Mobile Swatches
Dreamweaver CS5.5 introduced support for jQuery Mobile (see the following section New 
Features in Dreamweaver CS5.5 for a full description). In addition to the features found in 
the previous version, there is now the addition of jQuery Mobile Swatches in CS6. This 
feature allows you to quickly style jQuery layout elements as well as user interface elements by 
dragging and dropping color swatches onto your page. You can choose from a preset number 
of element themes within Dreamweaver as well as download additional themes for your use. 
This feature is accessed within a jQuery site by choosing Window > jQuery Mobile Swatches.
PhoneGap Build Service
This feature is an upgrade of the PhoneGap integration introduced in Dreamweaver CS5.5 
(see the following section New Features in Dreamweaver CS5.5 for a full description). The 
PhoneGap Build Service allows you to connect with your online PhoneGap account in 
order to build native applications for the following mobile operating systems: iOS, Android, 
Blackberry, webOS and symbian. This integration dramatically reduces the complexity 
involved in compiling these applications and also provides online emulators as well as the 
ability to download your compiled applications from your PhoneGap account. This feature can 
be accessed by choosing Site > PhoneGap Build Service.

Lesson 17
New Features in Dreamweaver CS5.5
The Multiscreen Preview option and the related CSS3 Media Queries are perhaps the biggest 
change in Dreamweaver CS5.5, but there are several other new additions, many of which are 
related to mobile design and development.
CSS3 and HTML5 authoring support 
Dreamweaver CS5.5 has added to its internal library of code many of the new HTML5 
elements and CSS3 styles. Examples of HTML5 elements now available include <header>, 
<nav>, <aside>, and others (Figure 17-6). In previous versions of Dreamweaver, there was no 
code that indicated the use of these elements. Users could still add the elements, but they were 
not readily available in Dreamweaver’s code-hinting interface.
Figure 17-6: You can easily create HTML5 pages in Dreamweaver  
with code-hinting support for the new HTML5 elements.
Similarly, CSS3 includes several new styles to help you enhance your pages, including features 
such as rounded corners, gradients, border images, and more. These CSS3 properties are 
now readily available in Dreamweaver’s code-hinting library (Figure 17-7). (This library 
also includes the vendor-specific prefixes needed to ensure that styles are visible on specific 
browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer.) 
Figure 17-7: You can easily add CSS3 styling in Dreamweaver  
with code-hinting support for the new CSS3 styles.
jQuery Mobile integration
Designers and developers who need to create web pages and user interfaces optimized for 
mobile devices can create Dreamweaver projects using the jQuery Mobile Framework. jQuery 
is generally used for desktop applications to enhance websites with the reliable JavaScript 
code included in this open-source JavaScript library. The jQuery Mobile Framework is 
a relatively new addition that lets you add features such as animations and components for 
touchscreen interfaces, form field validation, pattern matching, and more.
You can create a site optimized for mobile by choosing File > New Page From Sample > 
jQuery Mobile to open a layout that has placeholder content and several built-in user interface 

Lesson 17

features (Figure 17-8). Some examples of these built-in interface features are a multi-page design 
with styles formatted for mobile, animated pages and collapsible panels, and buttons designed for 
the touch-sensitive capabilities of smartphones, tablets, and other touch-enabled screens.
Figure 17-8: The default layout for a jQuery Mobile project  
includes page elements targeted for touchscreen interfaces.
Support for building native mobile apps for iOS and Android with PhoneGap 
In addition to the jQuery Mobile support, designers and developers can now use 
Dreamweaver to build native applications for iOS and Android applications with help from 
the PhoneGap Framework. This framework packages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files into 
native applications to let designers and developers with limited or no programming nowledge 
build native apps. 
You can build an entire site as a native application by choosing Site > Mobile Applications > 
Build. For the Android operating system, Dreamweaver helps install the necessary SDKs on 
your system using the Easy Install option. For iOS, you need to manually install Apple’s Xcode 
or the Apple iOS SDK to compile the applications from Dreamweaver.
Take Note...
You can create native applications for Android or iOS with Dreamweaver CS5.5 or CS6 and 
support from the PhoneGap framework.
W3C Validation
Designers and developers have long used the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a 
resource to help troubleshoot problems. The W3C provides a free service that checks HTML, 
XHMTL, and CSS documents for syntax errors. In the past, you would have had to go to the 
W3C website and either upload your file, or copy and paste your code into their web interface. 
Starting with the release of CS5.5, Dreamweaver now allows you to send your file directly 
by clicking the W3C button at the top of your document window. The results then appear 
within a W3C Validation window in Dreamweaver. W3C Validation is a built-in validation 
engine in Dreamweaver allowing authors of an HTML document to check for conformance to 
HTML or XHTML standards.
