Bridging Theory  
                  and Practice
Focus on the Financial Crisis and Sovereign  
Debt Crisis
Global Financial Crisis boxes reflect the reality of the recent 
financial crisis and ongoing sovereign debt crisis, noting ­lessons 
learned. Twenty-two boxes across the book illustrate and ­ 
analyze key details.
The Law of One Price as the Unifying 
Valuation Framework
The Law of One Price framework reflects the modern idea that 
the absence of arbitrage is the unifying concept of valuation. This 
critical insight is introduced in Chapter 3, revisited in each part 
opener, and integrated throughout the text—motivating all major 
concepts and connecting theory to practice.
Study Aids with a Practical Focus
To be successful, students need to master the core concepts and 
learn to identify and solve problems that today’s practitioners face.
Common Mistakes boxes alert students to frequently made 
mistakes stemming from misunderstanding core concepts and 
calculations—in the classroom and in the field.
Applications that Reflect Real Practice
Corporate Finance features actual companies and leaders in the field.
Interviews with notable practitioners—six new for this edi-
tion—highlight leaders in the field and address the effects of the 
financial crisis.
General Interest boxes highlight timely material from financial 
publications that shed light on business problems and real-
company practices.
European Sovereign Debt  Yields: A Puzzle
countries would be fiscally responsible and manage their 
debt obligations to avoid default at all costs. But as illus-
trated by Figure 6.6, once the 2008 financial crisis revealed 
the folly of this assumption, debt yields once again diverged 
as investors acknowledged the likelihood that some coun-
tries (particularly Portugal and Ireland) might be unable to 
repay their debt and would be forced to default.
In retrospect, rather than bringing fiscal responsibility, 
the monetary union allowed the weaker member countries 
to borrow at dramatically lower rates. In response, these 
countries reacted by increasing their borrowing––and at 
least in Greece’s case, borrowed to the point that default 
became inevitable.
Before the EMU created the euro as a single European cur-
rency, the yields of sovereign debt issued by European coun-
tries varied widely. These variations primarily reflected 
differences in inflation expectations and currency risk (see 
 Figure 6.6). However, after the monetary union was put in 
place at the end of 1998, the yields all essentially converged to 
the yield on German government bonds. Investors seemed to 
conclude that there was little distinction between the debt of 
the European countries in the union––they seemed to feel that 
all countries in the union were essentially exposed to the same 
default, inflation and currency risk and thus equally “safe.”
Presumably, investors believed that an outright default 
was unthinkable: They apparently believed that member 
GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
Discounting One Too Many Times
The perpetuity formula assumes that the first payment 
occurs at the end of the first period (at date 1). Sometimes 
perpetuities have cash flows that start later in the future. In 
this case, we can adapt the perpetuity formula to compute 
the present value, but we need to do so carefully to avoid a 
common mistake.
To illustrate, consider the MBA graduation party 
described in Example 4.7. Rather than starting immedi-
ately, suppose that the first party will be held two years from 
today (for the current entering class). How would this delay 
change the amount of the donation required?
Now the timeline looks like this:
We need to determine the present value of these cash flows, 
as it tells us the amount of money in the bank needed today 
to finance the future parties. We cannot apply the perpetuity 
formula directly, however, because these cash flows are not 
exactly a perpetuity as we defined it. Specifically, the cash 
flow in the first period is “missing.” But consider the situ-
ation on date 1—at that point, the first party is one period 
away and then the cash flows are periodic. From the per-
spective of date 1, this is a perpetuity, and we can apply the 
formula. From the preceding calculation, we know we need 
$375,000 on date 1 to have enough to start the parties on 
date 2. We rewrite the timeline as follows:
Our goal can now be restated more simply: How much do 
we need to invest today to have $375,000 in one year? This 
is a simple present value calculation:
PV = $375,000/1.08 = $347,222 today
A common mistake is to discount the $375,000 twice 
because the first party is in two periods. Remember—the 
present value formula for the perpetuity already discounts the 
cash flows to one period prior to the first cash flow. Keep in 
mind that this common mistake may be made with perpetu-
ities, annuities, and all of the other special cases discussed in 
this section. All of these formulas discount the cash flows to 
one period prior to the first cash flow.

QUESTION: What are the main policy 
instruments used by central banks to control 
the economy?
ANSWER: The Federal Reserve (Fed) 
deploys several policy tools to achieve its 
goals of price stability, maximum sustain-
able employment, and financial stability. 
Lowering the federal funds short-term 
interest rate, the primary policy instrument, 
stimulates the economy. Raising the federal funds rate gener-
ally slows the economy. Buying and selling short-term U.S. 
Treasury securities through open market operations is standard 
practice. Prior to the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the Fed’s 
balance sheet ranged from $700–$900 billion. But when 
the Fed was unable to lower interest rates further because 
rates were so close to zero already, it resorted to large-scale, 
longer-term open market operations to increase liquidity in 
the financial system in the hopes of stimulating the economy 
further, thus growing its balance sheet significantly. With 
open mouth operations, the Fed’s announcements of its intent 
to buy or sell assets indicates its desired degree of future 
policy accommodation, often prompting markets to react 
by adjusting interest rates immediately. The Fed’s Lender-of-
Last-Resort authority allows it to lend money against good 
clarity and confidence in the financial 
wherewithal of each other. One effective, 
innovative tool, the Term Auction Facility 
(TAF), stimulated the economy by pro-
viding cheap and readily available term 
funding to banks, large and small, on the 
front lines of the economy, thus encour-
aging them to extend credit to businesses 
and consumers. After reducing the 
policy rate to near zero to help revive the 
economy, the Fed instituted two Quan-
titative Easing (QE) programs––special 
purchases of government and agency 
securities––to increase money supply, 
promote lending, and according to some 
proponents, increase prices of riskier 
assets.
The Fed also addressed the global 
financial crisis by establishing temporary central bank 
liquidity swap lines with the European Central Bank and 
other major central banks. Using this facility, a foreign 
central bank is able to obtain dollar funding for its custom-
ers by swapping Euros for dollars or another currency and 
agreeing to reverse the swap at a later date. The Fed does 
not take exchange rate risk, but it is subject to the credit 
risk of its central bank counterparty.
QUESTION: What tools is the European Central Bank 
(ECB) using to address the sovereign debt crisis? How does its 
approach compare to the Fed’s approach to the 2007–2009 
financial crisis?
ANSWER: As a novel economic federation, the ECB

EXAMPLE 4.14
Evaluating an Annuity with Monthly Cash Flows
Problem
You are about to purchase a new car and have two options to pay for it. You can pay $20,000 in 
cash immediately, or you can get a loan that requires you to pay $500 each month for the next 
48 months (four years). If the monthly interest rate you earn on your cash is 0.5%, which option 
should you take?
Solution
Let’s start by writing down the timeline of the loan payments:
The timeline shows that the loan is a 48-period annuity. Using the annuity formula the present 
value is
 PV (48@period annuity of $500) = $500 *
1
0.005
 ¢1 -
1
1.00548≤
 = $21,290
Alternatively, we may use the annuity spreadsheet to solve the problem:
Thus, taking the loan is equivalent to paying $21,290 today, which is costlier than paying cash. 
You should pay cash for the car.

       Teaching Students  
        to Think ­Finance
With a consistency in presentation and an innovative set of learning aids, Corporate Finance simultaneously meets the needs of 
both future financial managers and non-financial managers. This textbook truly shows every student how to “think finance.”
Practice Finance to Learn Finance
Working problems is the proven way to cement and demonstrate 
an understanding of finance.
Concept Check questions at the end of each section enable 
students to test their understanding and target areas in which 
they need further review.
End-of-chapter problems written personally by Jonathan 
Berk and Peter DeMarzo offer instructors the opportunity 
to assign first-rate materials to students for homework and 
practice with the confidence that the problems are consistent 
with chapter content. Both the problems and solutions, which 
also were written by the authors, have been class-tested and 
accuracy-checked to ensure quality.
Data Cases present in-depth scenarios in a business setting 
with questions designed to guide students’ analysis. Many 
­questions involve the use of Internet resources and Excel 
­techniques.
Simplified Presentation of Mathematics
One of the hardest parts of learning finance is mastering the 
jargon, math, and non-standardized notation. Corporate Finance 
systematically uses:
Notation Boxes: Each chapter opens by defining the variables 
and acronyms used in the chapter as a “legend” for students’ 
reference.
Timelines: Introduced in Chapter 4, timelines are emphasized 
as the important first step in solving every problem that 
involves cash flows.
Numbered and Labeled Equations: The first time a full equa-
tion is given in notation form it is numbered. Key equations  
are titled and revisited in the chapter summary.
Using Excel Boxes: Provide hands-on instruction of Excel 
­techniques and include screenshots to serve as a guide for students.
Spreadsheet Tables: Select tables are available as Excel files, 
enabling students to change inputs and manipulate the under­
lying calculations.
USING EXCEL 
Excel also has a built-in function, IRR, that will calculate the IRR of a stream of cash flows. 
Excel’s IRR function has the format, IRR (values, guess), where “values” is the range containing 
the cash flows, and “guess” is an optional starting guess where Excel begins its search for an IRR. 
See the example below:
There are three things to note about the IRR function. First, the values given to the IRR func-
tion should include all of the cash flows of the project, including the one at date 0. In this 
sense, the IRR and NPV functions in Excel are inconsistent. Second, like the NPV function, the 
IRR ignores the period associated with any blank cells. Finally, as we will discuss in Chapter 7, 
in some settings the IRR function may fail to find a solution, or may give a different answer, 
depending on the initial guess.

This is your second interview with a prestigious brokerage firm for a job as an equity analyst. You 
survived the morning interviews with the department manager and the Vice President of Equity. 
Everything has gone so well that they want to test your ability as an analyst. You are seated in a room 
with a computer and a list with the names of two companies—Ford (F) and Microsoft (MSFT). You 
have 90 minutes to complete the following tasks:
 
1. Download the annual income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements for the last 
four fiscal years from MarketWatch (www.morningstar.com). Enter each company’s stock symbol 
and then go to “financials.” Export the statements to Excel by clicking the export button.
 
2. Find historical stock prices for each firm from Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com). Enter your 
stock symbol, click “Historical Prices” in the left column, and enter the proper date range to 
cover the last day of the month corresponding to the date of each financial statement. Use the 
closing stock prices (not the adjusted close). To calculate the firm’s market capitalization at each 
date, multiply the number of shares outstanding (see “Basic” on the income statement under 
“Weighted Average Shares Outstanding”) by the firm’s historic stock price.
 
3. For each of the four years of statements, compute the following ratios for each firm:
Valuation Ratios
Price-Earnings Ratio (for EPS use Diluted EPS Total)
Market-to-Book Ratio
Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA
(For debt, include long-term and short-term debt; for cash, include marketable securities.)
Profitability Ratios

W
E WERE MOTIVATED TO WRITE THIS TEXTBOOK BY A CENTRAL 
­insight: The core concepts in finance are simple and intuitive. What makes the 
subject challenging is that it is often difficult for a novice to distinguish between 
these core ideas and other intuitively appealing approaches that, if used in financial decision 
making, will lead to incorrect decisions. De-emphasizing the core concepts that underlie 
finance strips students of the essential intellectual tools they need to differentiate between 
good and bad decision making.
We present corporate finance as an application of a set of simple, powerful ideas. At the 
heart is the principal of the absence of arbitrage opportunities, or Law of One Price—in 
life, you don’t get something for nothing. This simple concept is a powerful and important 
tool in financial decision making. By relying on it, and the other core principles in this 
book, financial decision makers can avoid the bad decisions brought to light by the recent 
financial crisis. We use the Law of One Price as a compass; it keeps financial decision 
makers on the right track and is the backbone of the entire book.
New to This Edition
We have updated all text discussions and figures, tables, data cases, and facts to accurately 
reflect developments in the field in the last four years. Specific highlights include the 
­following:
n	 Increased coverage of early stage financing in Chapter  23 (Raising Equity Capital), 
including a detailed explanation of angel financing, venture capital deal terms, and an 
expanded explanation of typical returns investors might earn.
n	 Addressed the implications of negative interest rates throughout the book.
n	 Expanded coverage of the European debt crisis in Chapter 6 (Valuing Bonds) including 
a case study on the Greek default.
n	 Added material throughout Part 5 (Capital Structure) that relates the capital structure 
to the current debate on bank leverage.
n	 Added coverage in Chapter 1 (The Corporation) describing the ongoing changes to 
how stocks are traded worldwide.
n	 Expanded the explanation of key financial ratios in Chapter 2 (Introduction to Finan-
cial Statement Analysis) and index arbitrage in Chapter 3 (Financial Decision Making 
and the Law of One Price).
n	 Redesigned sections of Chapter  22 (Real Options) with new examples to make the 
exposition clearer.
n	 Updated the coverage in Chapter 13 (Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency) 
to reflect recent developments in asset pricing.
n	 Six new practitioner interviews incorporate timely perspectives from leaders in the field 
related to the recent financial crisis and ongoing European sovereign debt crisis.
n	 Added Nobel Prize boxes to reflect the recent Nobel Prizes awarded for material covered 
in the book.
n	 Added a new Case Study, two new Data Cases, new problems and refined many others, 
once again personally writing and solving each one. In addition, every single problem 
is available in 
, the groundbreaking homework and tutorial system that 
accompanies the book.

The Law of One Price as a Unifying Principle of Valuation
This book presents corporate finance as an application of a small set of simple core ideas. 
Modern finance theory and practice is grounded in the idea of the absence of arbitrage—or 
the Law of One Price—as the unifying concept in valuation. We introduce the Law of One 
Price concept as the basis for NPV and the time value of money in Chapter 3, Financial 
Decision Making and the Law of One Price. In the opening of each part and as pertinent 
throughout the remaining chapters, we relate major concepts to the Law of One Price, cre-
ating a framework to ground the student reader and connect theory to practice.
Table of Contents Overview
Corporate Finance offers coverage of the major topical areas for introductory-level MBA 
students as well as the depth required in a reference textbook for upper-division courses. 
Most professors customize their classes by selecting a subset of chapters reflecting the 
subject matter they consider most important. We designed this book from the outset with 
this need for flexibility in mind. Parts 2 through 6 are the core chapters in the book. We 
envision that most MBA programs will cover this material—yet even within these core 
chapters instructors can pick and choose.
Single quarter course: Cover Chapters 3–15; if time allows, or students are previously 
familiar with the time value of money, add on Chapters 16–19.
Semester-long course: Incorporate options (Chapters 20–22) and Part 10, Special Topics, 
chapters as desired.
Single mini-semester: Assign Chapters 3–10, 14, and 15 if time allows.

Acknowledgments
Looking back, it is hard to believe that this book is in its fourth edition. We are heartened by 
its success and impact on the profession through shaping future practitioners. As any text-
book writer will tell you, achieving this level of success requires a substantial amount of help. 
First and foremost we thank Donna Battista, whose leadership, talent, and market savvy are 
imprinted on all aspects of the project and are central to its more than 10 years of success; 
Denise Clinton, a friend and a leader in fact not just in name, whose experience and knowl-
edge were indispensable in the earliest stages; Rebecca Ferris-Caruso, for her unparalleled 
expertise in managing the complex writing, reviewing, and editing processes and patience in 
keeping us on track—it is impossible to imagine writing the first edition without her; Jami 
Minard, for spearheading marketing efforts; Kate Fernandes, for her energy and fresh per-
spective as our new editor; Miguel Leonarte, for his central role on MyFinanceLab; Gillian 
Hall for getting the book from draft pages into print; and Paul Corey for his insightful lead-
ership and unwavering support of this fourth edition. We were blessed to be approached by 
the best publisher in the business and we are both truly thankful for the indispensable help 
provided by these and other professionals, including Kathryn Brightney, Dottie Dennis, 
Meredith Gertz, Nancy Freihofer, Melissa Honig, and Carol Melville.
Updating a textbook like ours requires a lot of painstaking work, and there are many who 
have provided insights and input along the way. We would especially like to call out Jared 
Stanfield for his important contributions and suggestions throughout. We’re also appreciative 
of Marlene Bellamy’s work conducting the lively interviews that provide a critically important 
perspective, and to the interviewees who graciously provided their time and insights.
Of course, this fourth edition text is built upon the shoulders of the first three, and we have 
many to thank for helping us make those early versions a reality. We remain forever grateful 
for Jennifer Koski’s critical insights, belief in this project, and tireless effort, all of which were

critical to the first edition. Many of the later, non-core chapters required specific detailed 
knowledge. Nigel Barradale, Reid Click, Jarrad Harford, and Marianne Plunkert ensured that 
this knowledge was effectively communicated. Joseph Vu and Vance P. Lesseig contributed 
their talents to the Concept Check questions and Data Cases, respectively.
Creating a truly error-free text is a challenge we could not have lived up to without our 
team of expert error checkers; we owe particular thanks to Sukarnen Suwanto, Siddharth 
Bellur, Robert James, Anand Goel, Ian Drummond Gow, Janet Payne, and Jared Stanfield. 
Thomas Gilbert and Miguel Palacios tirelessly worked examples and problems in the first edi-
tion, while providing numerous insights along the way.
A corporate finance textbook is the product of the talents and hard work of many talented 
colleagues. We are especially gratified with the work of those who updated the impressive 
array of supplements to accompany the book: Janet Payne and William Chittenden, for the 
Instructor’s Manual, Test Item File, and PowerPoint; and Sukarnen Suwanto, for his accuracy 
review of the Solutions Manual.
As a colleague of both of us, Mark Rubinstein inspired us with his passion to get the 
history of finance right by correctly attributing the important ideas to the people who 
first enunciated them. We have used his book, A History of the Theory of Investments: My 
Annotated Bibliography, extensively in this text and we, as well as the profession as a whole, 
owe him a debt of gratitude for taking the time to write it all down.
We could not have written this text if we were not once ourselves students of finance.  
As any student knows, the key to success is having a great teacher. In our case we are lucky  
to have been taught and advised by the people who helped create modern finance: Ken 
Arrow, Darrell Duffie, Mordecai Kurz, Stephen Ross, and Richard Roll. It was from them 
that we learned the importance of the core principles of finance, including the Law of One 
Price, on which this book is based. The learning process does not end at graduation and 
like most people we have had especially influential colleagues and mentors from which we 
learned a great deal during our careers and we would like to recognize them explicitly here: 
Mike Fishman, Richard Green, Vasant Naik, Art Raviv, Mark Rubinstein, Joe Williams, 
and Jeff Zwiebel. The passing of Rick last year was a loss we will feel forever. We continue 
to learn from all of our colleagues and we are grateful to all of them. Finally, we would 
like to thank those with whom we have taught finance classes over the years: Anat Admati, 
Ming Huang, Dirk Jenter, Robert Korajczyk, Paul Pfleiderer, Sergio Rebelo, Richard 
Stanton, and Raman Uppal. Their ideas and teaching strategies have without a doubt 
influenced our own sense of pedagogy and found their way into this text.
Finally, and most importantly, we owe our biggest debt of gratitude to our spouses, 
Rebecca Schwartz and Kaui Chun DeMarzo. Little did we (or they) know how much 
this project would impact our lives, and without their continued love and support—and 
especially their patience and understanding—this text could not have been completed. We 
owe a special thanks to Kaui DeMarzo, for her inspiration and support at the start of this 
project, and for her willingness to be our in-house editor, contributor, advisor, and overall 
sounding-board throughout each stage of its development.

Decision Making  
and the Law of  
One Price
WHY STUDY CORPORATE FINANCE? No matter what your role in a corpora-
tion, an understanding of why and how financial decisions are made is essential. The 
focus of this book is how to make optimal corporate financial decisions. In this part of 
the book, we lay the foundation for our study of corporate finance. We begin, in Chap-
ter 1, by introducing the corporation and related business forms. We then examine the 
role of financial managers and outside investors in decision making for the firm. To make 
optimal decisions, a decision maker needs information. As a result, in Chapter 2, we 
review an important source of information for corporate decision-making—the firm’s 
financial statements.
We then introduce the most important idea in this book, the concept of the absence 
of arbitrage or Law of One Price in Chapter 3. The Law of One Price allows us to use 
market prices to determine the value of an investment opportunity to the firm. We will 
demonstrate that the Law of One Price is the one unifying principle that underlies all 
of financial economics and links all of the ideas throughout this book. We will return to

THE MODERN U.S. CORPORATION WAS BORN IN A COURTroom 
in Washington, D.C., on February 2, 1819. On that day the U.S. Supreme Court estab-
lished the legal precedent that the property of a corporation, like that of a person, 
is private and entitled to protection under the U.S. Constitution. Today, it is hard to 
entertain the possibility that a corporation’s private property would not be protected 
under the Constitution. However, before the 1819 Supreme Court decision, the owners 
of a corporation were exposed to the possibility that the state could take their busi-
ness. This concern was real enough to stop most businesses from incorporating and, 
indeed, in 1816 that concern was realized: The state seized Dartmouth College.
Dartmouth College was incorporated in 1769 as a private educational institution 
governed by a self-perpetuating board of trustees. Unhappy with the political leanings 
of the board, the state legislature effectively took control of Dartmouth by passing 
legislation in 1816 that established a governor-appointed board of overseers to run 
the school. The legislation had the effect of turning a private university under private 
control into a state university under state control. If such an act were constitutional, 
it implied that any state (or the federal government) could, at will, nationalize any 
corporation.
Dartmouth sued for its independence and the case made it to the Supreme Court 
under Chief Justice John Marshall in 1818. In a nearly unanimous 5–1 decision, the 
court struck down the New Hampshire law, ruling that a corporation was a “contract” 
and that, under Article 1 of the Constitution, “the state legislatures were forbidden to 
pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.”1 The precedent was set: Owners of 
businesses could incorporate and still enjoy the protection of private property, as well 
as protection from seizure, both guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. The modern busi-
ness corporation was born.

1.1  The Four Types of Firms

Today, the corporate structure is ubiquitous all over the world, and yet continues to evolve 
in the face of new forces. In 2008 the financial crisis once again transformed the financial land-
scape, bringing down giants like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG and reshaping investment 
banks like Goldman Sachs into government-guaranteed commercial banks. Government bailouts have 
provoked challenging questions regarding the role of the federal government in the control and 
management of private corporations. In the wake of the crisis, significant reforms of the regulation 
and oversight of financial markets were passed into law. Understanding the principles of corporate 
finance has never been more important to the practice of business than it is now, during this time of 
great change.
The focus of this book is on how people in corporations make financial decisions. This chapter 
introduces the corporation and explains alternative business organizational forms. A key factor in the 
success of corporations is the ability to easily trade ownership shares, and so we will also explain the 
role of stock markets in facilitating trading among investors in a corporation and the implications that 
has for the ownership and control of corporations.
	
1.1	 The Four Types of Firms
We begin our study of corporate finance by introducing the four major types of firms: sole 
proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, and corporations. We explain each 
organizational form in turn, but our primary focus is on the most important form—the 
corporation. In addition to describing what a corporation is, we also provide an overview 
of why corporations are so successful.
Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is a business owned and run by one person. Sole proprietorships 
are usually very small with few, if any, employees. Although they do not account for much 
sales revenue in the economy, they are the most common type of firm in the world, as 
shown in Figure 1.1. Statistics indicate that nearly 72% of businesses in the United States 
are sole proprietorships, although they generate only 4% of the revenue.2 Contrast this 
with corporations, which make up under 18% of firms but are responsible for 83% of U.S. 
revenue.
Sole proprietorships share the following key characteristics:
	
1.	 Sole proprietorships are straightforward to set up. Consequently, many new busi-
nesses use this organizational form.
	
2.	 The principal limitation of a sole proprietorship is that there is no separation 
between the firm and the owner—the firm can have only one owner. If there are 
other investors, they cannot hold an ownership stake in the firm.
	
3.	 The owner has unlimited personal liability for any of the firm’s debts. That is, if the 
firm defaults on any debt payment, the lender can (and will) require the owner to 
repay the loan from personal assets. An owner who cannot afford to repay the loan 
must declare personal bankruptcy.

Chapter 1  The Corporation
	
4.	 The life of a sole proprietorship is limited to the life of the owner. It is also difficult 
to transfer ownership of a sole proprietorship.
For most businesses, the disadvantages of a sole proprietorship outweigh the advantages. 
As soon as the firm reaches the point at which it can borrow without the owner agreeing 
to be personally liable, the owners typically convert the business into a form that limits the 
owner’s liability.
Partnerships
A partnership is identical to a sole proprietorship except it has more than one owner. The 
following are key features of a partnership:
	
1.	 All partners are liable for the firm’s debt. That is, a lender can require any partner to 
repay all the firm’s outstanding debts.
	
2.	 The partnership ends on the death or withdrawal of any single partner, although 
partners can avoid liquidation if the partnership agreement provides for alternatives 
such as a buyout of a deceased or withdrawn partner.
Some old and established businesses remain partnerships or sole proprietorships. Often 
these firms are the types of businesses in which the owners’ personal reputations are the basis 
for the businesses. For example, law firms, groups of doctors, and accounting firms are often 
organized as partnerships. For such enterprises, the partners’ personal liability increases the 
confidence of the firm’s clients that the partners will strive to maintain their reputation.
A limited partnership is a partnership with two kinds of owners, general partners 
and limited partners. General partners have the same rights and privileges as partners in 
a (general) partnership—they are personally liable for the firm’s debt obligations. Limited 
partners, however, have limited liability—that is, their liability is limited to their invest-
ment. Their private property cannot be seized to pay off the firm’s outstanding debts. 
Further­more, the death or withdrawal of a limited partner does not dissolve the partnership, 
and a limited partner’s interest is transferable. However, a limited partner has no manage-
ment authority and cannot legally be involved in the managerial decision making for the 
business.

Private equity funds and venture capital funds are two examples of industries dominated 
by limited partnerships. In these firms, a few general partners contribute some of their 
own capital and raise additional capital from outside investors who are limited partners. 
The general partners control how all the capital is invested. Most often they will actively 
participate in running the businesses they choose to invest in. The outside investors play no 
active role in the partnership other than monitoring how their investments are performing.
Limited Liability Companies
A limited liability company (LLC) is a limited partnership without a general partner. 
That is, all the owners have limited liability, but unlike limited partners, they can also run 
the business.
The LLC is a relatively new phenomenon in the United States. The first state to pass 
a statute allowing the creation of an LLC was Wyoming in 1977; the last was Hawaii in 
1997. Internationally, companies with limited liability are much older and established. 
LLCs rose to prominence first in Germany over 100 years ago as a Gesellschaft mit
beschränkter Haftung (GmbH) and then in other European and Latin American coun-
tries. An LLC is known in France as a Société à responsabilité limitée (SARL), and by 
similar names in Italy (SRL) and Spain (SL).
Corporations
The distinguishing feature of a corporation is that it is a legally defined, artificial being 
(a judicial person or legal entity), separate from its owners. As such, it has many of the legal 
powers that people have. It can enter into contracts, acquire assets, incur obligations, and, 
as we have already established, it enjoys protection under the U.S. Constitution against 
the seizure of its property. Because a corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct 
from its owners, it is solely responsible for its own obligations. Consequently, the owners 
of a corporation (or its employees, customers, etc.) are not liable for any obligations the 
corporation enters into. Similarly, the corporation is not liable for any personal obligations 
of its owners.
Formation of a Corporation.  Corporations must be legally formed, which means that 
the state in which it is incorporated must formally give its consent to the incorporation by 
chartering it. Setting up a corporation is therefore considerably more costly than setting 
up a sole proprietorship. Delaware has a particularly attractive legal environment for cor-
porations, so many corporations choose to incorporate there. For jurisdictional purposes, a 
corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated. Most firms hire lawyers to 
create a corporate charter that includes formal articles of incorporation and a set of bylaws. 
The corporate charter specifies the initial rules that govern how the corporation is run.
Ownership of a Corporation.  There is no limit on the number of owners a corporation 
can have. Because most corporations have many owners, each owner owns only a small 
fraction of the corporation. The entire ownership stake of a corporation is divided into 
shares known as stock. The collection of all the outstanding shares of a corporation is 
known as the equity of the corporation. An owner of a share of stock in the corporation is 
known as a shareholder, stockholder, or equity holder and is entitled to dividend pay-
ments, that is, payments made at the discretion of the corporation to its equity holders. 
Shareholders usually receive a share of the dividend payments that is proportional to the 
amount of stock they own. For example, a shareholder who owns 25% of the firm’s shares 
will be entitled to 25% of the total dividend payment.

38	
Chapter 1  The Corporation
A unique feature of a corporation is that there is no limitation on who can own its stock. 
That is, an owner of a corporation need not have any special expertise or qualification. 
This feature allows free trade in the shares of the corporation and provides one of the most 
important advantages of organizing a firm as a corporation rather than as sole proprietor-
ship, partnership, or LLC. Corporations can raise substantial amounts of capital because 
they can sell ownership shares to anonymous outside investors.
The availability of outside funding has enabled corporations to dominate the economy, 
as shown by Panel (b) of Figure 1.1. Let’s take one of the world’s largest firms, Wal-Mart 
Stores Inc. (brand name Walmart), as an example. Walmart had over 2 million employees, 
and reported annual revenue of $486 billion in 2014. Indeed, the top five companies by 
sales volume in 2014 (Walmart, Sinopec, Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobile, and BP) had 
combined sales exceeding $2 trillion, an amount significantly larger than the total sales of 
the more than 22 million U.S. sole proprietorships.
Tax Implications for Corporate Entities
An important difference between the types of organizational forms is the way they are 
taxed. Because a corporation is a separate legal entity, a corporation’s profits are subject to 
taxation separate from its owners’ tax obligations. In effect, shareholders of a corporation 
pay taxes twice. First, the corporation pays tax on its profits, and then when the remaining 
profits are distributed to the shareholders, the shareholders pay their own personal income 
tax on this income. This system is sometimes referred to as double taxation.
S Corporations.  The corporate organizational structure is the only organizational struc-
ture subject to double taxation. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code allows an 
exemption from double taxation for “S” corporations, which are corporations that elect 
subchapter S tax treatment. Under these tax regulations, the firm’s profits (and losses) are 
not subject to corporate taxes, but instead are allocated directly to shareholders based on 
their ownership share. The shareholders must include these profits as income on their indi-
vidual tax returns (even if no money is distributed to them). However, after the sharehold-
ers have paid income taxes on these profits, no further tax is due.
Example 1.1
Taxation of Corporate Earnings
Problem
You are a shareholder in a corporation. The corporation earns $5 per share before taxes. After 
it has paid taxes, it will distribute the rest of its earnings to you as a dividend. The dividend is 
income to you, so you will then pay taxes on these earnings. The corporate tax rate is 40% and 
your tax rate on dividend income is 15%. How much of the earnings remains after all taxes are 
paid?
Solution
First, the corporation pays taxes. It earned $5 per share, but must pay 0.40 * $5 = $2 to 
the government in corporate taxes. That leaves $3 to distribute. However, you must pay 
0.15 * $3 = $0.45 in income taxes on this amount, leaving $3 - $0.45 = $2.55 per share after 
all taxes are paid. As a shareholder you only end up with $2.55 of the original $5 in earn-
ings; the remaining $2 + $0.45 = $2.45 is paid as taxes. Thus, your total effective tax rate is 
2.45/5 = 49%.

The government places strict limitations on the qualifications for subchapter S tax treat-
ment. In particular, the shareholders of such corporations must be individuals who are U.S. 
citizens or residents, and there can be no more than 100 of them. Because most corpora-
tions have no restrictions on who owns their shares or the number of shareholders, they 
cannot qualify for subchapter S treatment. Thus most large corporations are “C” corpora-
tions, which are corporations subject to corporate taxes. S corporations account for less 
than one quarter of all corporate revenue.

1.2	 Ownership Versus Control of Corporations
It is often not feasible for the owners of a corporation to have direct control of the firm 
because there are sometimes many owners, each of whom can freely trade his or her stock. 
That is, in a corporation, direct control and ownership are often separate. Rather than the 
owners, the board of directors and chief executive officer possess direct control of the corpo-
ration. In this section, we explain how the responsibilities for the corporation are divided 
between these two entities and how together they shape and execute the goals of the firm.
The Corporate Management Team
The shareholders of a corporation exercise their control by electing a board of directors, 
a group of people who have the ultimate decision-making authority in the corporation.

Example 1.2
Taxation of S Corporation Earnings
Problem
Rework Example 1.1 assuming the corporation in that example has elected subchapter S treat-
ment and your tax rate on non-dividend income is 30%.
Solution
In this case, the corporation pays no taxes. It earned $5 per share. Whether or not the corpora-
tion chooses to distribute or retain this cash, you must pay 0.30 * $5 = $1.50 in income taxes, 
which is substantially lower than the $2.45 paid in Example 1.1.
Corporate Taxation Around the World
Most countries offer investors in corporations some relief 
from double taxation. Thirty countries make up the Orga-
nization for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD), and of these countries, only Ireland offers no relief 
whatsoever. A few countries, including Australia, ­Canada, 
Chile, Mexico and New Zealand, give shareholders a tax 
credit for the amount of corporate taxes paid, while oth-
ers, such as Estonia and Finland, fully or partially exempt 
­dividend income from individual taxes. The United States 
offers partial relief by having a lower tax rate on dividend 
income than on other sources of income. As of 2015, for 
most investors qualified dividends are taxed at up to 20%, 
a rate significantly below their personal income tax rate. 
Despite this relief, the effective corporate tax rate in the U.S. 
is one of the highest in the world (and nearly 30% above the 
median for the OECD).*

Chapter 1  The Corporation
David Viniar is Chief Financial Officer and 
head of the Operations, Technology and 
Finance Division at Goldman Sachs—the 
last major investment bank to convert from 
a partnership to a corporation. As the 
firm’s CFO, he played a leading role in the 
firm’s conversion to a corporation in 1999 
and charting the firm’s course through the 
financial crisis of 2008–2009.
QUESTION: What are the advantages of 
partnerships and corporations?
ANSWER: We debated this question at 
length when we were deciding whether 
to go public or stay a private partnership 
in the mid-1990s. There were good argu-
ments on both sides. Those in favor of 
going public argued we needed greater 
financial and strategic flexibility to achieve 
our aggressive growth and market leadership goals. As a 
public corporation, we would have a more stable equity 
base to support growth and disperse risk; increased access 
to large public debt markets; publicly traded securities with 
which to undertake acquisitions and reward and motivate 
our employees; and a simpler and more transparent struc-
ture with which to increase scale and global reach.
Those against going public argued our private partner-
ship structure worked well and would enable us to achieve 
our financial and strategic goals. As a private partnership, we 
could generate enough capital internally and in the private 
placement markets to fund growth; take a longer-term view 
of returns on our investments with less focus on earnings vol-
atility, which is not valued in public companies; and retain 
voting control and alignment of the partners and the firm.
A big perceived advantage of our private partnership was 
its sense of distinctiveness and mystique, which reinforced 
our culture of teamwork and excellence and helped differ-
entiate us from our competitors. Many questioned whether 
the special qualities of our culture would survive if the firm 
went public.
QUESTION: What was the driving force behind the 
conversion?
ANSWER: We ultimately decided to go public for three 
main reasons: to secure permanent capital to grow; to be 
able to use publicly traded securities to finance strategic 
acquisitions; and to enhance the culture of ownership and 
gain compensation flexibility.
QUESTION: Did the conversion achieve its 
goals?
ANSWER: Yes. As a public company, we 
have a simpler, bigger and more perma-
nent capital base, including enhanced 
long-term borrowing capacity in the 
public debt markets. We have drawn 
on substantial capital resources to serve 
clients, take advantage of new business 
opportunities, and better control our own 
destiny through changing economic and 
business conditions. We have been able 
to use stock to finance key acquisitions 
and support large strategic and financial 
investments. Given how the stakes in our 
industry changed, how capital demands 
grew, going public when we did fortu-
nately positioned us to compete effectively 
through the cycle.
Our distinctive culture of teamwork and excellence has 
thrived in public form, and our equity compensation pro-
grams turned out better than we could have hoped. Making 
everyone at Goldman Sachs an owner, rather than just 221 
partners, energized all our employees. The growing size and 
scope of our business—not the change to public form—has 
presented the greatest challenges to the positive aspects of 
our culture.
QUESTION: What prompted Goldman’s decision to become a 
bank holding company in Fall 2008?
ANSWER: The market environment had become extraor-
dinarily unstable following the collapse of Bear Stearns in 
March 2008. There was an increased focus on the SEC-
supervised broker/dealer business model, and in Septem-
ber, market sentiment had become increasingly negative 
with growing concerns over Lehman Brothers’ solvency. 
Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the 
sale of Merrill Lynch in the middle of September, and 
notwithstanding the reporting of quite strong earnings 
by both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, it became 
clear to us that the market viewed oversight by the 
Federal Reserve and the ability to source insured bank 
deposits as offering a greater degree of safety and sound-
ness. By changing our status, we gained all the benefits 
available to our commercial banking peers, including 
access to permanent liquidity and funding, without 
affecting our ability to operate or own any of our current 
businesses or investments.

1.2  Ownership Versus Control of Corporations

In most corporations, each share of stock gives a shareholder one vote in the election of the 
board of directors, so investors with the most shares have the most influence. When one or 
two shareholders own a very large proportion of the outstanding stock, these shareholders 
may either be on the board of directors themselves, or they may have the right to appoint 
a number of directors.
The board of directors makes rules on how the corporation should be run (including 
how the top managers in the corporation are compensated), sets policy, and monitors the 
performance of the company. The board of directors delegates most decisions that involve 
day-to-day running of the corporation to its management. The chief executive officer 
(CEO) is charged with running the corporation by instituting the rules and policies set by 
the board of directors. The size of the rest of the management team varies from corporation 
to corporation. The separation of powers within corporations between the board of direc-
tors and the CEO is not always distinct. In fact, it is not uncommon for the CEO also to 
be the chairman of the board of directors. The most senior financial manager is the chief 
financial officer (CFO), who often reports directly to the CEO. Figure 1.2 presents part 
of a typical organizational chart for a corporation, highlighting the key positions a financial 
manager may take.
The Financial Manager
Within the corporation, financial managers are responsible for three main tasks: mak-
ing investment decisions, making financing decisions, and managing the firm’s cash 
flows.
Investment Decisions.  The financial manager’s most important job is to make the firm’s 
investment decisions. The financial manager must weigh the costs and benefits of all invest-
ments and projects and decide which of them qualify as good uses of the money stockhold-
ers have invested in the firm. These investment decisions fundamentally shape what the 
firm does and whether it will add value for its owners. In this book, we will develop the 
tools necessary to make these investment decisions.

management activities.

Chapter 1  The Corporation
Financing Decisions.  Once the financial manager has decided which investments to make, 
he or she also decides how to pay for them. Large investments may require the corporation 
to raise additional money. The financial manager must decide whether to raise more money 
from new and existing owners by selling more shares of stock (equity) or to borrow the money 
(debt). In this book, we will discuss the characteristics of each source of funds and how to 
decide which one to use in the context of the corporation’s overall mix of debt and equity.
Cash Management.  The financial manager must ensure that the firm has enough cash 
on hand to meet its day-to-day obligations. This job, also commonly known as manag-
ing working capital, may seem straightforward, but in a young or growing company, it 
can mean the difference between success and failure. Even companies with great prod-
ucts require significant amounts of money to develop and bring those products to market. 
Consider the $150 million Apple spent during its secretive development of the iPhone, 
or the costs to Boeing of producing the 787—the firm spent billions of dollars before the 
first 787 left the ground. A company typically burns through a significant amount of cash 
developing a new product before its sales generate income. The financial manager’s job is 
to make sure that access to cash does not hinder the firm’s success.
The Goal of the Firm
In theory, the goal of a firm should be determined by the firm’s owners. A sole proprietor-
ship has a single owner who runs the firm, so the goals of a sole proprietorship are the same 
as the owner’s goals. But in organizational forms with multiple owners, the appropriate 
goal of the firm—and thus of its managers—is not as clear.
Many corporations have thousands of owners (shareholders). Each owner is likely to have 
different interests and priorities. Whose interests and priorities determine the goals of the firm? 
Later in the book, we examine this question in more detail. However, you might be surprised 
to learn that the interests of shareholders are aligned for many, if not most, important deci-
sions. That is because, regardless of their own personal financial position and stage in life, all 
the shareholders will agree that they are better off if management makes decisions that increase 
the value of their shares. For example, by July 2015, Apple shares were worth over 120 times as 
The Dodd-Frank Act
the financial system,” (ii) put an end to the notion of “too 
big to fail,” (iii) “protect the American taxpayer by ending 
bailouts,” and (iv) “protect consumers from abusive finan-
cial services practices.” Time will tell whether the Act will 
actually achieve these important goals.
Implementing the wide-ranging financial reforms in the 
Dodd-Frank Act requires the work of many federal agen-
cies, either through rulemaking or other regulatory actions. 
As of mid-2015, five years since Dodd-Frank’s passage, 247 
of the reforms have been finalized, providing a clear picture 
of the Dodd-Frank regulatory framework. But another 143 
rules or actions await completion. While only two-thirds of 
the rules have been finalized, many of the core reforms have 
been or are nearing completion.  For instance, the Volcker 
Rule, which bars banks that take government-insured depos-
its from making speculative investments took full effect in 
late July of 2015.
In response to the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. federal gov-
ernment reevaluated its role in the control and management 
of financial institutions and private corporations. Signed 
into law on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act brought a sweep-
ing change to financial regulation in response to widespread 
calls for financial regulatory system reform after the near 
collapse of the world’s financial system in the fall of 2008 
and the ensuing global credit crisis. History indeed repeats 
itself: It was in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash 
and subsequent Great Depression that Congress passed the 
Glass-Steagall Act establishing the Federal Deposit Insur-
ance Corporation (FDIC) and instituted significant bank 
reforms to regulate transactions between commercial banks 
and securities firms.
The Dodd-Frank Act aims to (i) promote U.S. financial 
stability by “improving accountability and transparency in

much as they were in October 2001, when the first iPod was introduced. Clearly, regardless of 
their preferences and other differences, all investors who held shares of Apple stock over this 
period have benefited from the investment decisions Apple’s managers have made.
The Firm and Society
Are decisions that increase the value of the firm’s equity beneficial for society as a whole? 
Most often they are. While Apple’s shareholders have become much richer since 2001, its 
customers also are better off with products like the iPod and iPhone that they might oth-
erwise never have had. But even if the corporation only makes its shareholders better off, 
as long as nobody else is made worse off by its decisions, increasing the value of equity is 
good for society.
The problem occurs when increasing the value of equity comes at the expense of oth-
ers. Consider a corporation that, in the course of business, pollutes the environment and 
does not pay the costs to clean up the pollution. Alternatively, a corporation may not itself 
pollute, but use of its products may harm the environment. In such cases, decisions that 
increase shareholder wealth can be costly for society as whole.
The 2008 financial crisis highlighted another example of decisions that can increase 
shareholder wealth but are costly for society. In the early part of the last decade, banks took 
on excessive risk. For a while, this strategy benefited the banks’ shareholders. But when the 
bets went bad, the resulting financial crisis harmed the broader economy.
When the actions of the corporation impose harm on others in the economy, appropri-
ate public policy and regulation is required to assure that corporate interests and societal 
interests remain aligned. Sound public policy should allow firms to continue to pursue the 
maximization of shareholder value in a way that benefits society overall.
Ethics and Incentives within Corporations
But even when all the owners of a corporation agree on the goals of the corporation, these 
goals must be implemented. In a simple organizational form like a sole proprietorship, the 
owner, who runs the firm, can ensure that the firm’s goals match his or her own. But a 
corporation is run by a management team, separate from its owners, giving rise to conflicts 
of interest. How can the owners of a corporation ensure that the management team will 
implement their goals?
Agency Problems.  Many people claim that because of the separation of ownership and 
control in a corporation, managers have little incentive to work in the interests of the 
shareholders when this means working against their own self-interest. Economists call this 
an agency problem—when managers, despite being hired as the agents of shareholders, 
put their own self-interest ahead of the interests of shareholders. Managers face the ethical 
dilemma of whether to adhere to their responsibility to put the interests of shareholders 
first, or to do what is in their own personal best interest.
This agency problem is commonly addressed in practice by minimizing the number 
of decisions managers must make for which their own self-interest substantially differs 
from the interests of the shareholders. For example, managers’ compensation contracts are 
designed to ensure that most decisions in the shareholders’ interest are also in the manag-
ers’ interests; shareholders often tie the compensation of top managers to the corporation’s 
profits or perhaps to its stock price. There is, however, a limitation to this strategy. By tying 
compensation too closely to performance, the shareholders might be asking managers to 
take on more risk than they are comfortable taking. As a result, managers may not make 
decisions that the shareholders want them to, or it might be hard to find talented managers

Chapter 1  The Corporation
The Dodd-Frank Act on Corporate Compensation  
and Governance
n	 Require firm disclosure and shareholder approval of 
large bonus payments (so-called “golden parachutes”) to 
ousted senior executives as the result of a takeover.
n	 Require disclosure of the relationship of executive pay to 
the company’s performance, as well as the ratio between 
the CEO’s total compensation and that of the median 
employee.
n	 Require disclosure of whether executives are permitted to 
hedge their stock or option holdings.
n	 Create “clawback” provisions that allow firms to recoup 
compensation paid based on erroneous financial results.
Compensation is one of the most important conflicts of 
interest between corporate executives and shareholders. To 
limit senior corporate executives’ influence over their own 
compensation and prevent excessive compensation, the Act 
directs the SEC to adopt new rules that:
n	 Mandate the independence of a firm’s compensation 
committee and its advisers.
n	 Provide shareholders the opportunity to approve—in a 
non-binding, advisory vote—the compensation of exec-
utive officers at least once every three years (referred to as 
a “Say-on-Pay” vote).
Global Financial Crisis
willing to accept the job. On the other hand, if compensation contracts reduce managers’ 
risk by rewarding good performance but limiting the penalty associated with poor perfor-
mance, managers may have an incentive to take excessive risk.
Further potential for conflicts of interest and ethical considerations arise when some 
stakeholders in the corporation benefit and others lose from a decision. Shareholders and 
managers are two stakeholders in the corporation, but others include the regular employees 
and the communities in which the company operates, for example. Managers may decide 
to take the interests of other stakeholders into account in their decisions, such as keeping a 
loss-generating factory open because it is the main provider of jobs in a small town, paying 
above-market wages to factory workers in a developing country, or operating a plant at a 
higher environmental standard than local law mandates.
In some cases, these actions that benefit other stakeholders also benefit the firm’s share-
holders by creating a more dedicated workforce, generating positive publicity with cus-
tomers, or other indirect effects. In other instances, when these decisions benefit other 
stakeholders at shareholders’ expense, they represent a form of corporate charity. Indeed, 
many if not most corporations explicitly donate (on behalf of their shareholders) to local 
and global charitable and political causes. For example, in 2013, Walmart gave $312 million 
in cash to charity (making it the largest corporate donor of cash in that year). These actions 
are costly and reduce shareholder wealth. Thus, while some shareholders might support 
such policies because they feel that they reflect their own moral and ethical priorities, it 
is unlikely that all shareholders will feel this way, leading to potential conflicts of interest 
amongst shareholders.
Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission
On January 21, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on 
what some scholars have argued is the most important First 
Amendment case in many years. In Citizens United v. Fed-
eral Election Commission the Court held, in a controversial 
5–4 decision, that the First Amendment allows corporations 
and unions to make political expenditures in support of a 
particular candidate. This ruling overturned existing restric-
tions on political campaigning by corporations. But because 
it is highly unlikely that all shareholders of a corporation 
would unanimously support a particular candidate, allowing 
such activities effectively guarantees a potential conflict of 
interest.

	
1.2  Ownership Versus Control of Corporations	
45
The CEO’s Performance.  Another way shareholders can encourage managers to work in 
the interests of shareholders is to discipline them if they don’t. If shareholders are unhappy 
with a CEO’s performance, they could, in principle, pressure the board to oust the CEO. 
Disney’s Michael Eisner, Hewlett Packard’s Carly Fiorina, and Barclay’s Antony Jenkins 
were all reportedly forced to resign by their boards. Despite these high-profile examples, 
directors and top executives are rarely replaced through a grassroots shareholder uprising. 
Instead, dissatisfied investors often choose to sell their shares. Of course, somebody must 
be willing to buy the shares from the dissatisfied shareholders. If enough shareholders are 
dissatisfied, the only way to entice investors to buy (or hold on to) the shares is to offer 
them a low price. Similarly, investors who see a well-managed corporation will want to 
purchase shares, which drives the stock price up. Thus, the stock price of the corporation 
is a barometer for corporate leaders that continuously gives them feedback on their share-
holders’ opinion of their performance.
When the stock performs poorly, the board of directors might react by replacing the 
CEO. In some corporations, however, the senior executives are entrenched because boards 
of directors do not have the will to replace them. Often the reluctance to fire results because 
the board members are close friends of the CEO and lack objectivity. In corporations in 
which the CEO is entrenched and doing a poor job, the expectation of continued poor 
performance will decrease the stock price. Low stock prices create a profit opportunity. 
In a hostile takeover, an individual or organization—sometimes known as a corporate 
raider—can purchase a large fraction of the stock and acquire enough votes to replace the 
board of directors and the CEO. With a new superior management team, the stock is a 
much more attractive investment, which would likely result in a price rise and a profit for 
the corporate raider and the other shareholders. Although the words “hostile” and “raider” 
have negative connotations, corporate raiders themselves provide an important service to 
shareholders. The mere threat of being removed as a result of a hostile takeover is often 
enough to discipline bad managers and motivate boards of directors to make difficult deci-
sions. Consequently, when a corporation’s shares are publicly traded, a “market for cor-
porate control” is created that encourages managers and boards of directors to act in the 
interests of their shareholders.
Corporate Bankruptcy.  Ordinarily, a corporation is run on behalf of its shareholders. 
But when a corporation borrows money, the holders of the firm’s debt also become 
investors in the corporation. While the debt holders do not normally exercise control 
over the firm, if the corporation fails to repay its debts, the debt holders are entitled 
to seize the assets of the corporation in compensation for the default. To prevent such 
a seizure, the firm may attempt to renegotiate with the debt holders, or file for bank-
ruptcy protection in a federal court. (We describe the details of the bankruptcy process 
and its implications for corporate decisions in much more detail in Part 5 of the text-
book.) Ultimately, however, if the firm is unable to repay or renegotiate with the debt 
holders, the control of the corporation’s assets will be transferred to them.
Thus, when a firm fails to repay its debts, the end result is a change in ownership of the 
firm, with control passing from equity holders to debt holders. Importantly, bankruptcy 
need not result in a liquidation of the firm, which involves shutting down the business 
and selling off its assets. Even if control of the firm passes to the debt holders, it is in 
the debt holders’ interest to run the firm in the most profitable way possible. Doing so 
often means keeping the business operating. For example, in 1990, Federated Department 
Stores declared bankruptcy. One of its best-known assets at the time was Bloomingdale’s, a 
nationally recognized department store. Because Bloomingdale’s was a profitable business,

Chapter 1  The Corporation
Airlines in Bankruptcy
On December 9, 2002, United Airlines filed for bank-
ruptcy protection following an unsuccessful attempt to 
convince the federal government to bail out the company’s 
investors by providing loan guarantees. Although United 
remained in bankruptcy for the next three years, it con-
tinued to operate and fly passengers, and even expanded 
capacity in some markets. One of those expansions was 
“Ted,” an ill-fated attempt by United to start a budget air-
line to compete directly with Southwest Airlines. In short, 
although United’s original shareholders were wiped out, as 
far as customers were concerned it was business as usual. 
People continued to book tickets and United continued to 
fly and serve them.
It is tempting to think that when a firm files for bank-
ruptcy, things are “over.” But often, rather than liquidate the 
firm, bondholders and other creditors are better off allowing 
the firm to continue operating as a going concern. United 
was just one of many airlines to move in and out of bank-
ruptcy since 2002; others include U.S. Airways, Air Canada, 
Hawaiian Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and Delta Airlines. In 
November 2011, American Airlines became the latest airline 
to declare bankruptcy. Like United in 2002, American con-
tinued to operate while it cut costs and reorganized, returning 
to profitability in mid-2012. American ultimately settled with 
creditors in December 2013 as part of a merger agreement 
with US Airways.
neither equity holders nor debt holders had any desire to shut it down, and it continued 
to operate in bankruptcy. In 1992, when Federated Department Stores was reorganized 
and emerged from bankruptcy, Federated’s original equity holders had lost their stake in 
Bloomingdale’s, but this flagship chain continued to perform well for its new owners, and 
its value as a business was not adversely affected by the bankruptcy.
Thus, a useful way to understand corporations is to think of there being two sets of 
investors with claims to its cash flows—debt holders and equity holders. As long as the 
corporation can satisfy the claims of the debt holders, ownership remains in the hands of 
the equity holders. If the corporation fails to satisfy debt holders’ claims, debt holders may 
take control of the firm. Thus, a corporate bankruptcy is best thought of as a change in 
ownership of the corporation, and not necessarily as a failure of the underlying business.

1.3	 The Stock Market
As we have discussed, shareholders would like the firm’s managers to maximize the value 
of their investment in the firm. The value of their investment is determined by the price of 
a share of the corporation’s stock. Because private companies have a limited set of share-
holders and their shares are not regularly traded, the value of their shares can be difficult to 
determine. But many corporations are public companies, whose shares trade on organized 
markets called a stock market (or stock exchange). Figure 1.3 shows the major exchanges 
worldwide, by total value of listed stocks and trading volume.
These markets provide liquidity and determine a market price for the company’s shares. 
An investment is said to be liquid if it is possible to sell it quickly and easily for a price 
very close to the price at which you could contemporaneously buy it. This liquidity is 
attractive to outside investors, as it provides flexibility regarding the timing and duration 
of their investment in the firm. In addition, the research and trading of participants in 
these markets give rise to share prices that provide constant feedback to managers regarding 
investors’ views of their decisions.

Primary and Secondary Stock Markets
When a corporation itself issues new shares of stock and sells them to investors, it does so 
on the primary market. After this initial transaction between the corporation and inves-
tors, the shares continue to trade in a secondary market between investors without the 
involvement of the corporation. For example, if you wish to buy 100 shares of Starbucks 
Coffee, you would place an order on a stock exchange, where Starbucks trades under the 
ticker symbol SBUX. You would buy your shares from someone who already held shares 
of Starbucks, not from Starbucks itself. Because firms only occasionally issue new shares, 
secondary market trading accounts for the vast majority of trading in the stock market.
Traditional Trading Venues
Historically, a firm would choose one stock exchange on which to list its stock, and almost 
all trade in the stock would occur on that exchange. In the U.S., the two most important 
exchanges are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Secu-
rity Dealers Automated Quotation (NASDAQ).
Prior to 2005, almost all trade on the NYSE took place on the exchange’s trading floor 
in lower Manhattan. Market makers (known then on the NYSE as specialists) matched 
buyers and sellers. They posted two prices for every stock in which they made a market: 
the price at which they were willing to buy the stock (the bid price) and the price at which 
they were willing to sell the stock (the ask price). When a customer arrived and wanted to 
make a trade at these prices, the market maker would honor the posted prices (up to a lim-
ited number of shares) and make the trade even when they did not have another customer 
willing to take the other side of the trade. In this way, market makers provided liquidity by 
ensuring that market participants always had somebody to trade with.

the order and can change the order 
almost instantly. Because computers 
have more control over orders than 
human traders did, there is less risk 
associated with placing an order. Con-
sequently there are more orders and 
greater liquidity.
QUESTION:  How has NASDAQ been 
affected by these changes and what does 
the future hold?
ANSWER: NASDAQ has become 
an innovative, technologically savvy 
company—much like the companies 
we list. Fifteen years ago we operated 
a single stock market in the United 
States. Thanks to increased techno-
logical efficiency, today we operate 
three stock markets, three listed-
options markets, and a futures market. Operating these 
seven markets requires less than half the personnel required 
for a single market 15 years ago. To compete in this envi-
ronment, NASDAQ had to develop a better trading system 
to handle our increased order volume. Order volume that 
took an entire day to process 15 years ago, today takes a 
few seconds. We’ve also transformed our culture from sup-
porting an industry based on human traders to one based 
on algorithmic traders and the IT professionals who design 
those algorithms. 
QUESTION: Is High Frequency Trading a cause for concern in 
the market? Should it be limited?
ANSWER: Specific concerns about High Frequency Trading 
are generally about market disruptions and manipulation, 
and cases center around the operation of trading algo-
rithms. I believe market oversight is evolving to appropri-
ately address disruptive or manipulative activity.
These days essentially every order in the United States 
is handled by a computer trading algorithm. Simply put, 
we are all High Frequency Traders. Consequently, limiting 
High Frequency Trading should not be a policy objec­
tive. What should be a policy objective is making sure that 
equity markets benefit investors and issuers by ensuring 
that the algorithms do not disrupt the markets and that 
they operate in a manner that is fair to investors. The 
market exists to support capital formation and economic 
growth. Market operators such as NASDAQ work with 
regulators and others to look after the interests of investors 
and issuers.
As Chief Economist and Senior Vice 
President for NASDAQ, Dr. Frank 
Hatheway leads a team of 20 profes-
sionals who serve as an internal consul-
tancy for the NASDAQ markets. Their 
work includes designing new features, 
evaluating operations markets, and 
advising on strategic initiatives.
QUESTION: Compared to 15 years ago, 
the number of potential trading venues 
for investors has changed dramatically. 
Who have these changes benefited?
ANSWER: The number of trading 
­venues has increased dramatically. In 
2000 you placed an order on NAS-
DAQ or the NYSE, and the major-
ity of trading activity in that stock 
occurred on the same market as your 
order. That’s not the case anymore. Your trade may be 
executed on the National Stock Exchange, BATS, or one 
of 10 other exchanges. To deal with the soaring number 
of venues, trading became highly automated and highly 
competitive, benefiting both individual and institutional 
investors. A fast retail trade in the 1980s took about three 
minutes and cost over $100 (in 1980s money). Now it’s 
a mouse click, browser refresh, and maybe $20 (in 2016 
money). Trading costs for individual investors are down 
over 90 percent since 2000. Institutional-size block orders 
are also cheaper and easier to trade today.
Automation has virtually removed traditional equity trad-
ers like the market makers, specialists, and floor brokers at 
the exchanges. As the head of the trading desk for a major 
firm quipped around 2006, “I used to have 100 traders and 
10 IT guys. I now have 100 IT guys and 10 traders.” The 
once bustling New York Stock Exchange floor is now essen-
tially a TV studio.
QUESTION: How have these changes affected market 
liquidity?
ANSWER: Liquidity is very transitory. The computer algo-
rithms controlling trading constantly enter orders into the 
market and remove orders if the order fails to trade or if 
market conditions change. The algorithms quickly re-enter 
removed orders into the market, leading to rapidly chang-
ing prices and quantities. Also, numerous studies show 
that there is more liquidity in the market today. To control 
an order 15 years ago, you phoned your broker with your 
instructions. Today, the algorithm you selected controls

In contrast to the NYSE, the NASDAQ market never had a trading floor. Instead, all 
trades were completed over the phone or on a computer network. An important difference 
between the NYSE and NASDAQ was that on the NYSE, each stock had only one market 
maker. On the NASDAQ, stocks had multiple market makers who competed with one 
another. Each market maker posted bid and ask prices on the NASDAQ network that were 
viewed by all participants.
Market makers make money because ask prices are higher than bid prices. This differ-
ence is called the bid-ask spread. Customers always buy at the ask (the higher price) and 
sell at the bid (the lower price). The bid-ask spread is a transaction cost investors pay in 
order to trade. Because specialists on the NYSE took the other side of the trade from their 
customers, this cost accrued to them as a profit. This was the compensation they earned for 
providing a liquid market by standing ready to honor any quoted price. Investors also paid 
other forms of transactions costs like commissions.
New Competition and Market Changes
Stock markets have gone through enormous changes in the last decade. In 2005, the 
NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges accounted for over 75% of all trade in U.S. stocks. Since 
that time, however, they have faced increasing competition from new fully electronic 
exchanges, as well as alternative trading systems. Today, these new entrants handle more 
than 50% of all trades, as shown in Figure 1.4.
With this change in market structure, the role of an official market maker has largely 
disappeared. Because all transactions occur electronically with computers matching buy 
and sell orders, anyone can make a market in a stock by posting a limit order—an order to 
buy or sell a set amount at a fixed price. For example, a limit buy order might be an order to 
buy 100 shares of IBM at a price of $138/share. The bid-ask spread of a stock is determined

1.	 What are the important changes that have occurred in stock markets over the last decade?
	
2.	 What is the limit order book?
	
3.	 Why are people who post limit orders termed “providers” of liquidity?
by the outstanding limit orders. The limit sell order with the lowest price is the ask price. 
The limit buy order with the highest price is the bid price. Traders make the market in the 
stock by posting limit buy and sell orders. The collection of all limit orders is known as the 
limit order book. Exchanges make their limit order books public so that investors (or their 
brokers) can see the best bid and ask prices when deciding where to trade.
Traders who post limit orders provide the market with liquidity. On the other hand, 
traders who place market orders—orders that trade immediately at the best outstanding 
limit order—are said to be “takers” of liquidity. Providers of liquidity earn the bid-ask 
spread, but in so doing they risk the possibility of their orders becoming stale: When news 
about a stock arrives that causes the price of that stock to move, smart traders will quickly 
take advantage of the existing limit orders by executing trades at the old prices. To pro-
tect themselves against this possibility, liquidity providers need to constantly monitor the 
market, cancelling old orders and posting new orders when appropriate. So-called high 
frequency traders (HFTs) are a class of traders who, with the aid of computers, will place, 
update, cancel, and execute trades many times per second in response to new information 
as well as other orders, profiting both by providing liquidity and by taking advantage of 
stale limit orders.
Dark Pools
When trading on an exchange, investors are guaranteed the opportunity to trade imme-
diately at the current bid or ask price, and transactions are visible to all traders when 
they occur. In contrast, alternative trading systems called dark pools do not make their 
limit order books visible. Instead, these dark pools offer investors the ability to trade 
at a better price (for example, the average of the bid and ask, thus saving the bid-ask 
spread), with the tradeoff being that the order might not be filled if an excess of either 
buy or sell orders is received. Trading on a dark pool is therefore attractive to traders 
who do not want to reveal their demand and who are willing to sacrifice the guarantee 
of immediacy for a potentially better price.
When dark pools are included, researchers estimate that in the U.S. alone there could 
be as many 50 venues in which to trade stocks. These venues compete with one another 
for order volume. Because traders value liquid markets, an important area of competi-
tion is liquidity—exchanges try to ensure that their limit order books are deep, that is, 
that they contain many orders. As a result, exchanges have been experimenting with dif-
ferent rules designed to encourage traders who provide liquidity and discourage traders 
who take advantage of stale limit orders. For example, some trading venues pay traders to 
post limit orders and charge traders who place market orders. Others pay for orders from 
retail investors and impose additional charges on high frequency trading. The prolifera-
tion of exchange venues has generated a wide variety of different compensation schemes. 
Indeed, BATS operates different markets with different rules, essentially tailoring markets 
to the perceived needs of customers. It is highly unlikely that we have seen the end of these 
changes. Stock markets remain in a state of flux, and only time will tell what the eventual 
shake out will look like.

1.1  The Four Types of Firms
	
n	 There are four types of firms in the United States: sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited 
liability companies, and corporations.
	
n	 Firms with unlimited personal liability include sole proprietorships and partnerships.
	
n	 Firms with limited liability include limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and 
corporations.
	
n	 A corporation is a legally defined artificial being (a judicial person or legal entity) that has many 
of the same legal powers as people. It can enter into contracts, acquire assets, incur obligations, 
and, as we have already established, it enjoys the protection under the U.S. Constitution against 
the seizure of its property.
	
n	 The shareholders in a C corporation effectively must pay tax twice. The corporation pays tax 
once and then investors must pay personal tax on any funds that are distributed.
	
n	 S corporations are exempt from the corporate income tax.
1.2  Ownership Versus Control of Corporations
	
n	 The ownership of a corporation is divided into shares of stock collectively known as equity. 
Investors in these shares are called shareholders, stockholders, or equity holders.
	
n	 The ownership and control of a corporation are separated. Shareholders exercise their control 
indirectly through the board of directors.
	
n	 Financial managers within the firm are responsible for three main tasks: making investment 
decisions, making financing decisions, and managing the firm’s cash flows.
	
n	 Good public policy should ensure that when firms take actions that benefit their shareholders, 
they are also benefiting society.
	
n	 While the firm’s shareholders would like managers to make decisions that maximize the firm’s 
share price, managers often must balance this objective with the desires of other stakeholders 
(including themselves).
	
n	 Corporate bankruptcy can be thought of as a change in ownership and control of the corpora-
tion. The equity holders give up their ownership and control to the debt holders.
1.3  The Stock Market
	
n	 The shares of public corporations are traded on stock markets. The shares of private corpora-
tions do not trade on a stock market.
	
n	 Traders provide liquidity in stock markets by posting limit orders.
	
n	 The bid-ask spread is determined by the best bid and offer prices in the limit order book.

Introduction to  
­Financial ­Statement 
Analysis
As We Discussed In Chapter 1, One of the Great advantages 
of the corporate organizational form is that it places no restriction on who can own 
shares in the corporation. Anyone with money to invest is a potential investor. As a result, 
corporations are often widely held, with investors ranging from individuals who hold 
100 shares to mutual funds and institutional investors who own ­millions of shares. For 
example, in 2012, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) had about 980 
million shares outstanding held by nearly 600,000 shareholders. Most shareholders 
were small. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway was the largest shareholder with about 
an 8% stake. Less than 1% of the company was owned by insiders (IBM executives).
Although the corporate organizational structure greatly facilitates the firm’s access 
to investment capital, it also means that stock ownership is most investors’ sole tie to 
the company. How, then, do investors learn enough about a company to know whether 
or not they should invest in it? How can financial managers assess the success of their 
own firm and compare it to the performance of competitors? One way firms evaluate 
their performance and communicate this information to investors is through their finan-
cial statements.
Firms issue financial statements regularly to communicate financial ­information to 
the investment community. A detailed description of the ­preparation and analysis of 
these statements is sufficiently complicated that to do it justice would require an entire 
book. Here, we briefly review the subject, emphasizing only the material that investors 
and corporate financial managers need in order to make the corporate-finance deci-
sions we discuss in the text.
We review the four main types of financial statements, present ­examples of these 
statements for a firm, and discuss where an investor or manager might find various 
types of information about the company. We also discuss some of the financial ratios 
that investors and analysts use to assess a firm’s performance and value. We close the 
chapter with a look at a few highly publicized financial reporting abuses.

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
	
2.1	 Firms’ Disclosure of Financial Information
Financial statements are accounting reports with past performance information that a firm 
issues periodically (usually quarterly and annually). U.S. public companies are required to 
file their financial statements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
on a quarterly basis on form 10-Q and annually on form 10-K. They must also send an 
annual report with their financial statements to their shareholders each year. Private com-
panies often prepare financial statements as well, but they usually do not have to disclose 
these reports to the public. Financial statements are important tools through which inves-
tors, financial analysts, and other interested outside parties (such as creditors) obtain infor-
mation about a corporation. They are also useful for managers within the firm as a source 
of information for corporate financial decisions. In this section, we examine the guidelines 
for preparing financial statements and introduce the types of financial statements.
Preparation of Financial Statements
Reports about a company’s performance must be understandable and accurate. Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) provide a common set of rules and a standard 
format for public companies to use when they prepare their reports. This standardization 
also makes it easier to compare the financial results of different firms.
Investors also need some assurance that the financial statements are prepared accurately. 
Corporations are required to hire a neutral third party, known as an auditor, to check the 
annual financial statements, to ensure that the annual financial statements are reliable and 
prepared according to GAAP.
International Financial Reporting Standards
Because Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) 
differ among countries, companies operating internationally 
face tremendous accounting complexity. Investors also face 
difficulty interpreting financial statements of foreign com-
panies, which is often considered a major barrier to inter-
national capital mobility. As companies and capital markets 
become more global, however, interest in harmonizing 
accounting standards across countries has increased.
The most important harmonization project began in 
1973 when representatives of 10 countries (including the 
United States) established the International Accounting 
Standards Committee. This effort led to the creation of the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in 2001, 
with headquarters in London. Now the IASB has issued a 
set of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
The IFRS are taking root throughout the world. The Euro-
pean Union (EU) approved an accounting regulation in 2002 
requiring all publicly traded EU companies to follow IFRS in 
their consolidated financial statements starting in 2005. As of 
2012, over 120 jurisdictions either require or permit the use 
of IFRS, including the EU, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Rus-
sia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. China, India and 
Japan will soon follow suit. Indeed, currently all major stock 
exchanges around the world accept IFRS except the United 
States and Japan, which maintain their local GAAP.
The main difference between U.S. GAAP and IFRS is 
conceptual—U.S. GAAP are based primarily on account-
ing rules with specific guidance in applying them, whereas 
IFRS are based more on principles requiring professional 
judgment by accountants, and specific guidance in applica-
tion is limited. Even so, some differences in rules also exist. 
For example, U.S. GAAP generally prohibit the upward 
revaluation of non-financial assets, whereas the IFRS allow 
the revaluation of some such assets to fair value. U.S. 
GAAP also rely more heavily on historical cost, as opposed 
to “fair value,” to estimate the value of assets and liabilities.
Effort to achieve convergence between U.S. GAAP and 
IFRS was spurred by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It 
included a provision that U.S. accounting standards move 
toward international convergence on high-quality account-
ing standards. Currently SEC regulations still require 
public U.S. firms to report using U.S. GAAP. That said, 
modifications to both IFRS and U.S. GAAP have brought 
the two closer together, with the key remaining differ-
ences in the areas of impairment charges, leasing, insur-
ance, and the treatment of financial instruments. As of 
mid-2015, the SEC looks likely to allow U.S. companies 
to use IFRS to provide supplemental information, but it 
will still require them to file their financials in accordance 
with U.S. GAAP.

cer. As Morgan Stanley’s Vice Chairman of

QUESTION: What best practices do you 
­recommend for financial managers? 
ANSWER: 
1.	 Maintain a tight financial control envi-
ronment with respect to accounting con-
trols and process. Incorporate a strategic 
approach to IT architecture to ensure 
data integrity, consistency, and process controls while 
reducing reliance on human, manual processes—a source 
of risk and errors.
2.	 Ensure a robust budgeting and capital allocation process 
built on a strong Financial Planning & Analysis team that 
is well integrated into the business. Push data transparency 
to business leaders. They are best positioned to make 
difficult trade-offs in the budgeting process, but often 
lack data granularity to make those choices (and to see 
the imperative).
3.	 Culture matters. A culture of honest, frank debate that 
challenges the status quo and avoids homogeneity of 
thought makes the job more fun and leads to better 
results. A broad range of experience, and even some ­“battle 
scars,” ensures� the organization recognizes patterns to 
foresee emerging risks. In that regard, a diverse team with 
respect to gender, race, and socioeconomic background 
brings differentiated perspectives, contributing to effective 
risk management.
4.	 Make tough calls early and, ideally, once. Lead.
QUESTION: How has the crisis shaped the role of the CFO, or 
your view of it? 
ANSWER: In financial services, it redefined the perception 
of a CFO. Beyond focusing on accounting and external 
reporting functions, the CFO is now also the firm’s most 
senior global manager for guardianship and risk manage-
ment. Guardianship includes accounting (the controller 
function) and overseeing a comprehensive approach to IT 
systems. Risk management requires identifying sources of 
vulnerability, stress testing, and planning against them. The 
CFO has become a trusted adviser to the 
CEO, board and business leaders, which 
includes budgeting, capital allocation, 
and sensitivity analyses. Finally, in certain 
industries the CFO is the point person 
with regulators.
QUESTION: What key lessons did you take 
from the financial crisis? What advice would 
you give future CFOs? 
ANSWER: I have three key takeaways from 
the financial crisis, relevant in both good 
and bad markets as well as across industries:
1.	Understand your greatest sources of 
vulnerability and defend against them. 
For financial services, liquidity (access 
to cash) was a weak spot. In that period, 
we often said, “Liquidity is oxygen for 
a financial system: without it, you choke.” Without 
sufficient liquidity, banks were forced into a negative 
cycle of selling assets to raise cash. As Morgan Stanley’s 
CFO, I managed liquidity with the maxim that it was 
sacrosanct. We invested substantially in the amount 
and durability of the company’s liquidity reserve. Simi-
larly, regulators coming out of the crisis appropriately 
demanded higher capital, lower leverage, better liquid-
ity, more durable funding, and rigorous stress testing, 
which imposed transparency on the banks and exposed 
their weaknesses.
2. 	Build a robust control infrastructure ahead of needs, includ-
ing financial and risk management controls, systems, and 
processes. Just as one shouldn’t drive a car at 100 mph 
with mud on the windshield, business leaders must have 
visibility about their business from accurate, insightful, 
and timely data consistent with strong financial controls. 
Rapid growth industries need to invest in infrastructure 
early because the business requirements continue to grow 
so rapidly.
3. 	Recognize that time is your enemy. Treasury Secretary 
Paulson told me during the financial crisis that you 
must have the will and the means to solve problems; too 
often, by the time you have the will, you no longer have 
the means. He was talking about policy, but that rule 
applies to any decision maker. The glaring examples, 
in retrospect, were the clear signs of crisis in August 
2007 and the March 2008 collapse of Bear Stearns, 
but reactions were slow or nonexistent. Even in good 
times, business leaders must focus on resource optimiza-
tion to maximize the potential for highest returns on 
investment.

Types of Financial Statements
Every public company is required to produce four financial statements: the balance sheet, 
the income statement, the statement of cash flows, and the statement of stockholders’ equity. 
These financial statements provide investors and creditors with an overview of the firm’s 
financial performance. In the sections that follow, we take a close look at the content of 
these financial statements.

2.2	 The Balance Sheet
The balance sheet, or statement of financial position,1 lists the firm’s assets and liabili-
ties, providing a snapshot of the firm’s financial position at a given point in time. Table 2.1 
shows the balance sheet for a fictitious company, Global Conglomerate Corporation. 
Notice that the balance sheet is divided into two parts (“sides”), with the assets on the left 
side and the liabilities on the right. The assets list the cash, inventory, property, plant, and 
equipment, and other investments the company has made; the liabilities show the firm’s 
obligations to creditors. Also shown with liabilities on the right side of the balance sheet is 

the stockholders’ equity. Stockholders’ equity, the difference between the firm’s assets and 
liabilities, is an accounting measure of the firm’s net worth.
The assets on the left side show how the firm uses its capital (its investments), and 
the right side summarizes the sources of capital, or how a firm raises the money it needs. 
Because of the way stockholders’ equity is calculated, the left and right sides must balance:
The Balance Sheet Identity
	
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity
(2.1)
In Table 2.1, total assets for 2015 ($177.7 million) are equal to total liabilities ($155.5 
million) plus stockholders’ equity ($22.2 million).
Let’s examine Global’s assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ equity in more detail.
Assets
In Table 2.1, Global’s assets are divided into current and long-term assets. We discuss each 
in turn.
Current Assets.  Current assets are either cash or assets that could be converted into cash 
within one year. This category includes the following:
	
1.	 Cash and other marketable securities, which are short-term, low-risk investments 
that can be easily sold and converted to cash (such as money market investments 
like government debt that matures within a year);
	
2.	 Accounts receivable, which are amounts owed to the firm by customers who have 
purchased goods or services on credit;
	
3.	 Inventories, which are composed of raw materials as well as work-in-progress and 
finished goods;
	
4.	 Other current assets, which is a catch-all category that includes items such as pre-
paid expenses (such as rent or insurance paid in advance).
Long-Term Assets.  The first category of long-term assets is net property, plant, and 
equipment. These include assets such as real estate or machinery that produce tangible 
benefits for more than one year. If Global spends $2 million on new equipment, this $2 
million will be included with property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheet. Because 
equipment tends to wear out or become obsolete over time, Global will reduce the value 
recorded for this equipment each year by deducting a depreciation expense. An asset’s 
accumulated depreciation is the total amount deducted over its life. The firm reduces the 
value of fixed assets (other than land) over time according to a depreciation schedule that 
depends on the asset’s life span. Depreciation is not an actual cash expense that the firm 
pays; it is a way of recognizing that buildings and equipment wear out and thus become 
less valuable the older they get. The book value of an asset, which is the value shown in the 
firm’s financial statements, is equal to its acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Net property, plant, and equipment shows the book value of these assets.
When a firm acquires another company, it will acquire a set of tangible assets (such as 
inventory or property, plant, and equipment) that will then be included on its balance 
sheet. In many cases, however, the firm may pay more for the company than the total 
book value of the assets it acquires. In this case, the difference between the price paid for 
the company and the book value assigned to its tangible assets is recorded separately as 
­goodwill and intangible assets. For example, Global paid $25 million in 2013 for a firm 
whose tangible assets had a book value of $5 million. The remaining $20 million appears 
	
2.2  The Balance Sheet	
59

60	
Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
as goodwill and intangible assets in Table 2.1. This entry in the balance sheet captures 
the value of other “intangibles” that the firm acquired through the acquisition (e.g., brand 
names and trademarks, patents, customer relationships, and employees). If the firm assesses 
that the value of these intangible assets declined over time, it will reduce the amount listed 
on the balance sheet by an amortization or impairment charge that captures the change in 
value of the acquired assets. Like depreciation, amortization is not an actual cash expense.
Other long-term assets can include such items as property not used in business opera-
tions, start-up costs in connection with a new business, investments in long-term securi-
ties, and property held for sale. The sum of all the firms’ assets is the total assets at the 
bottom of the left side of the balance sheet in Table 2.1.
Liabilities
We now examine the liabilities shown on the right side of the balance sheet, which are 
divided into current and long-term liabilities.
Current Liabilities.  Liabilities that will be satisfied within one year are known as ­current 
liabilities. They include the following:
	
1.	 Accounts payable, the amounts owed to suppliers for products or services pur-
chased with credit;
	
2.	 Short-term debt or notes payable, and current maturities of long-term debt, which 
are all repayments of debt that will occur within the next year;
	
3.	 Items such as salary or taxes that are owed but have not yet been paid, and deferred 
or unearned revenue, which is revenue that has been received for products that have 
not yet been delivered.
The difference between current assets and current liabilities is the firm’s net working 
­capital, the capital available in the short term to run the business. For example, in 2015, 
Global’s net working capital totaled $9 million ($57 million in current assets – $48 million 
in current liabilities). Firms with low (or negative) net working capital may face a shortage 
of funds unless they generate sufficient cash from their ongoing activities.
Long-Term Liabilities.  Long-term liabilities are liabilities that extend beyond one year. 
We describe the main types as follows:
	
1.	 Long-term debt is any loan or debt obligation with a maturity of more than a year. 
When a firm needs to raise funds to purchase an asset or make an investment, it 
may borrow those funds through a long-term loan.
	
2.	 Capital leases are long-term lease contracts that obligate the firm to make regular 
lease payments in exchange for use of an asset.2 They allow a firm to gain use of an 
asset by leasing it from the asset’s owner. For example, a firm may lease a building 
to serve as its corporate headquarters.
	
3.	 Deferred taxes are taxes that are owed but have not yet been paid. Firms generally keep 
two sets of financial statements: one for financial reporting and one for tax purposes. 
Occasionally, the rules for the two types of statements differ. Deferred tax liabilities gen-
erally arise when the firm’s financial income exceeds its income for tax purposes. Because 
deferred taxes will eventually be paid, they appear as a liability on the balance sheet.3
2See Chapter 25 for a precise definition of a capital lease.
3A firm may also have deferred tax assets related to tax credits it has earned that it will receive in the future.

Stockholders’ Equity
The sum of the current liabilities and long-term liabilities is total liabilities. The difference 
between the firm’s assets and liabilities is the stockholders’ equity; it is also called the book 
value of equity. As we stated earlier, it is an accounting measure of the net worth of the firm.
Ideally, the balance sheet would provide us with an accurate assessment of the true value 
of the firm’s equity. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to be the case. First, many of the assets 
listed on the balance sheet are valued based on their historical cost rather than their true 
value today. For example, an office building is listed on the balance sheet according to its 
historical cost net of depreciation. But the actual value of the office building today may be 
very different (and possibly much more) than the amount the firm paid for it years ago. The 
same is true for other property, plant, and equipment, as well as goodwill: The true value 
today of an asset may be very different from, and even exceed, its book value. A ­second, and 
probably more important, problem is that many of the firm’s valuable assets are not captured 
on the balance sheet. Consider, for example, the expertise of the firm’s employees, the firm’s 
reputation in the marketplace, the relationships with customers and suppliers, the value of 
future research and development innovations, and the quality of the management team. 
These are all assets that add to the value of the firm that do not appear on the balance sheet.
Market Value Versus Book Value
For the reasons cited above, the book value of equity, while accurate from an accounting 
perspective, is an inaccurate assessment of the true value of the firm’s equity. Successful 
firms are often able to borrow in excess of the book value of their assets because creditors 
recognize that the market value of the assets is far higher than the book value. Thus, it is 
not surprising that the book value of equity will often differ substantially from the amount 
investors are willing to pay for the equity. The total market value of a firm’s equity equals 
the number of shares outstanding times the firm’s market price per share:
	
Market Value of Equity = Shares outstanding * Market price per share
(2.2)
The market value of equity is often referred to as the company’s market capitalization (or 
“market cap”). The market value of a stock does not depend on the historical cost of the firm’s 
assets; instead, it depends on what investors expect those assets to produce in the future.
Example 2.1
Market Versus Book Value
Problem
If Global has 3.6 million shares outstanding, and these shares are trading for a price of $14 per 
share, what is Global’s market capitalization? How does the market capitalization compare to 
Global’s book value of equity in 2015?
Solution
Global’s market capitalization is (3.6 million shares) * ($14/share) = $50.4 million. This market 
capitalization is significantly higher than Global’s book value of equity of $22.2 million. Thus, inves-
tors are willing to pay 50.4/22.2 = 2.27 times the amount Global’s shares are “worth” according to 
their book value.
Market-to-Book Ratio.  In Example 2.1, we computed the market-to-book ratio (also 
called the price-to-book [P/B] ratio) for Global, which is the ratio of its market capitaliza-
tion to the book value of stockholders’ equity.
	
2.2  The Balance Sheet	
61

62	
Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
	
Market@to@Book Ratio = Market Value of Equity
Book Value of Equity 
(2.3)
The market-to-book ratio for most successful firms substantially exceeds 1, indicating 
that the value of the firm’s assets when put to use exceeds their historical cost. Variations in 
this ratio reflect differences in fundamental firm characteristics as well as the value added 
by management.
In Fall 2015, Citigroup (C) had a market-to-book ratio of 0.76, a reflection of inves-
tors’ assessment that many of Citigroup’s assets (such as some mortgage securities) were 
worth far less than their book value. At the same time, the average market-to-book ratio 
for major U.S. banks and financial firms was 1.9, and for all large U.S. firms it was 2.9. In 
contrast, Pepsico (PEP) had a market-to-book ratio of 8.3, and IBM had a market-to-book 
ratio of 11.3. Analysts often classify firms with low market-to-book ratios as value stocks, 
and those with high market-to-book ratios as growth stocks.
Enterprise Value
A firm’s market capitalization measures the market value of the firm’s equity, or the value 
that remains after the firm has paid its debts. But what is the value of the business itself? 
The enterprise value of a firm (also called the total enterprise value or TEV) assesses the 
value of the underlying business assets, unencumbered by debt and separate from any cash 
and marketable securities. We compute it as follows:
	
Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash
(2.4)
From Example 2.1, Global’s market capitalization in 2015 is $50.4 million. Its debt 
is $116.7 million ($3.5 million of notes payable, $13.3 million of current maturities of 
long-term debt, and remaining long-term debt of $99.9 million). Therefore, given its cash 
balance of $21.2 million, Global’s enterprise value is 50.4 + 116.7 - 21.2 = $145.9 mil-
lion. The enterprise value can be interpreted as the cost to take over the business. That is, 
it would cost 50.4 + 116.7 = $167.1 million to buy all of Global’s equity and pay off its 
debts, but because we would acquire Global’s $21.2 million in cash, the net cost of the 
business is only 167.1 - 21.2 = $145.9 million.

2.3	 The Income Statement
When you want somebody to get to the point, you might ask him or her for the “bot-
tom line.” This expression comes from the income statement. The income statement or 
­statement of financial performance4 lists the firm’s revenues and expenses over a period 
of time. The last or “bottom” line of the income statement shows the firm’s net income, 
which is a measure of its profitability during the period. The income statement is some-
times called a profit and loss, or “P&L” statement, and the net income is also referred to as 
the firm’s earnings. In this section, we examine the components of the income statement 
in detail and introduce ratios we can use to analyze this data.
4In IFRS and recent U.S. GAAP pronouncements, the income statement is referred to as the statement of 
financial performance.

Earnings Calculations
Whereas the balance sheet shows the firm’s assets and liabilities at a given point in time, 
the income statement shows the flow of revenues and expenses generated by those assets 
and liabilities between two dates. Table 2.2 shows Global’s income statement for 2015. 
We examine each category on the statement.
Gross Profit.  The first two lines of the income statement list the revenues from sales 
of products and the costs incurred to make and sell the products. Cost of sales shows 
costs directly related to producing the goods or services being sold, such as manufacturing 
costs. Other costs such as administrative expenses, research and development, and interest 
expenses are not included in the cost of sales. The third line is gross profit, which is the 
difference between sales revenues and the costs.
Operating Expenses.  The next group of items is operating expenses. These are expenses 
from the ordinary course of running the business that are not directly related to producing 
the goods or services being sold. They include administrative expenses and overhead, sala-
ries, marketing costs, and research and development expenses. The third type of operating 
expense, depreciation and amortization, is not an actual cash expense but represents an 
estimate of the costs that arise from wear and tear or obsolescence of the firm’s assets.5 The 
firm’s gross profit net of operating expenses is called operating income.
5Only certain types of amortization are deductible as a pretax expense (e.g., amortization of the cost of 
an acquired patent). Also, firms often do not separately list depreciation and amortization on the income 
statement, but rather include them with the expenses by function (e.g., depreciation of R&D equipment 
would be included with R&D expenses). When depreciation and amortization has been separated in this 
way, practitioners often refer to the expense items as “clean” (e.g., “clean R&D” is R&D expenses exclud-
ing any depreciation or amortization).

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
Earnings before Interest and Taxes.  We next include other sources of income or expenses 
that arise from activities that are not the central part of a company’s business. Income from 
the firm’s financial investments is one example of other income that would be listed here. 
After we have adjusted for other sources of income or expenses, we have the firm’s earnings 
before interest and taxes, or EBIT.
Pretax and Net Income.  From EBIT, we deduct the interest expense related to outstand-
ing debt to compute Global’s pretax income, and then we deduct corporate taxes to deter-
mine the firm’s net income.
Net income represents the total earnings of the firm’s equity holders. It is often reported 
on a per-share basis as the firm’s earnings per share (EPS), which we compute by dividing 
net income by the total number of shares outstanding:
	
EPS =
Net Income
Shares Outstanding =
$2.0 Million
3.6 Million Shares = $0.556 per Share
(2.5)
Although Global has only 3.6 million shares outstanding as of the end of 2015, the 
number of shares outstanding may grow if Global compensates its employees or execu-
tives with stock options that give the holder the right to buy a certain number of shares 
by a specific date at a specific price. If the options are “exercised,” the company issues 
new stock and the number of shares outstanding will grow. The number of shares may 
also grow if the firm issues convertible bonds, a form of debt that can be converted to 
shares. Because there will be more total shares to divide the same earnings, this growth 
in the number of shares is referred to as dilution. Firms disclose the potential for dilu-
tion by reporting diluted EPS, which represents earnings per share for the company 
calculated as though, for example, in-the-money stock options or other stock-based 
compensation had been exercised or dilutive convertible debt had been converted. For 
example, in 2014, Global awarded 200,000 shares of restricted stock to its key execu-
tives. While these are currently unvested, they will ultimately increase the number of 
shares outstanding, so Global’s diluted EPS is $2 ­million/3.8 million shares = $0.526.6
6In the case of stock options, the diluted share count is typically calculated using the treasury stock method, 
in which the number of shares added has the same value as the profit from exercising the option. For 
example, given Global’s share price of $14 per share, an option giving an employee the right to purchase 
a share for $7 would add ($14 - $7)/$14 = 0.5 shares to the diluted share count.

2.4	 The Statement of Cash Flows
The income statement provides a measure of the firm’s profit over a given time period. 
However, it does not indicate the amount of cash the firm has generated. There are two rea-
sons that net income does not correspond to cash earned. First, there are non-cash entries 
on the income statement, such as depreciation and amortization. Second, certain uses of 
cash, such as the purchase of a building or expenditures on inventory, are not reported 
on the income statement. The firm’s statement of cash flows utilizes the information 

from the income statement and balance sheet to determine how much cash the firm has 
­generated, and how that cash has been allocated, during a set period. As we will see, from 
the perspective of an investor attempting to value the firm, the statement of cash flows 
provides what may be the most important information of the four financial statements.
The statement of cash flows is divided into three sections: operating activities, investment 
activities, and financing activities. The first section, operating activity, starts with net income 
from the income statement. It then adjusts this number by adding back all non-cash entries 
related to the firm’s operating activities. The next section, investment activity, lists the cash 
used for investment. The third section, financing activity, shows the flow of cash between the 
firm and its investors. Global Conglomerate’s statement of cash flows is shown in Table 2.3. 
In this section, we take a close look at each component of the statement of cash flows.
Operating Activity
The first section of Global’s statement of cash flows adjusts net income by all non-cash 
items related to operating activity. For instance, depreciation is deducted when comput-
ing net income, but it is not an actual cash outflow. Thus, we add it back to net income 
when determining the amount of cash the firm has generated. Similarly, we add back any 
other non-cash expenses (for example, deferred taxes or expenses related to stock-based 
compensation).

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
Next, we adjust for changes to net working capital that arise from changes to accounts 
receivable, accounts payable, or inventory. When a firm sells a product, it records the reve-
nue as income even though it may not receive the cash from that sale immediately. Instead, 
it may grant the customer credit and let the customer pay in the future. The customer’s 
obligation adds to the firm’s accounts receivable. We use the following guidelines to adjust 
for changes in working capital:
	
1.	 Accounts Receivable : When a sale is recorded as part of net income, but the cash has 
not yet been received from the customer, we must adjust the cash flows by deducting 
the increases in accounts receivable. This increase represents additional lending by 
the firm to its customers, and it reduces the cash available to the firm.
	
2.	 Accounts Payable : Conversely, we add increases in accounts payable. Accounts pay-
able represents borrowing by the firm from its suppliers. This borrowing increases 
the cash available to the firm.
	
3.	 Inventory : Finally, we deduct increases to inventory. Increases to inventory are not 
recorded as an expense and do not contribute to net income (the cost of the goods 
are only included in net income when the goods are actually sold). However, the 
cost of increasing inventory is a cash expense for the firm and must be deducted.
We can identify the changes in these working capital items from the balance sheet. 
For example, from Table 2.1, Global’s accounts receivable increased from $13.2 million in 
2014 to $18.5 million in 2015. We deduct the increase of 18.5 - 13.2 = $5.3 million on 
the statement of cash flows. Note that although Global showed positive net income on the 
income statement, it actually had a negative $1.2 million cash flow from operating activity, 
in large part because of the increase in accounts receivable.
Investment Activity
The next section of the statement of cash flows shows the cash required for invest-
ment activities. Purchases of new property, plant, and equipment are referred to as 
capital expenditures. Recall that capital expenditures do not appear immediately as 
expenses on the income statement. Instead, firms recognize these expenditures over 
time as depreciation expenses. To determine the firm’s cash flow, we already added 
back depreciation because it is not an actual cash outflow. Now, we subtract the actual 
capital expenditure that the firm made. Similarly, we also deduct other assets purchased 
or long-term investments made by the firm, such as acquisitions or purchases of mar-
ketable securities. In Table 2.3, we see that in 2015, Global spent $21 million in cash 
on investing activities.
Financing Activity
The last section of the statement of cash flows shows the cash flows from financing activi-
ties. Dividends paid to shareholders are a cash outflow. Global paid $1 million to its share-
holders as dividends in 2015. The difference between a firm’s net income and the amount 
it spends on dividends is referred to as the firm’s retained earnings for that year:
	
Retained Earnings = Net Income - Dividends
(2.6)
Global retained $2 million - $1 million = $1 million, or 50% of its earnings in 2015.
Also listed under financing activity is any cash the company received from the sale of 
its own stock, or cash spent buying (repurchasing) its own stock. Global did not issue or 
repurchase stock during this period. The last items to include in this section result from 

changes to Global’s short-term and long-term borrowing. Global raised money by issuing 
debt, so the increases in borrowing represent cash inflows.
The final line of the statement of cash flows combines the cash flows from these three 
activities to calculate the overall change in the firm’s cash balance over the period of the 
statement. In this case, Global had cash inflows of $1.7 million, which matches the change 
in cash from 2014 to 2015 shown earlier in the balance sheet. By looking at the statement 
in Table 2.3 as a whole, we can determine that Global chose to borrow to cover the cost 
of its investment and operating activities. Although the firm’s cash balance has increased, 
Global’s negative operating cash flows and relatively high expenditures on investment 
activities might give investors some reasons for concern. If that pattern continues, Global 
will need to raise capital, by continuing to borrow or issuing equity, to remain in business.
Concept Check	
1.	 Why does a firm’s net income not correspond to cash generated?
	
2.	 What are the components of the statement of cash flows?
Example 2.2 
The Impact of Depreciation on Cash Flow
Problem
Suppose Global had an additional $1 million depreciation expense in 2015. If Global’s tax rate 
on pretax income is 26%, what would be the impact of this expense on Global’s earnings? How 
would it impact Global’s cash balance at the end of the year?
Solution
Depreciation is an operating expense, so Global’s operating income, EBIT, and pretax 
income would fall by $1 million. This decrease in pretax income would reduce Global’s tax 
bill  by 26% * $1 million = $0.26 million. Therefore, net income would fall by 1 - 0.26 =  
$0.74 million.
On the statement of cash flows, net income would fall by $0.74 million, but we would add 
back the additional depreciation of $1 million because it is not a cash expense. Thus, cash from 
operating activities would rise by -0.74 + 1 = $0.26 million. Thus, Global’s cash balance at the 
end of the year would increase by $0.26 million, the amount of the tax savings that resulted from 
the additional depreciation expense.
	
2.5	 Other Financial Statement Information
The most important elements of a firm’s financial statements are the balance sheet, income 
statement, and the statement of cash flows, which we have already discussed. Several other 
pieces of information contained in the financial statements warrant brief mention: the 
statement of stockholders’ equity, the management discussion and analysis, and notes to 
the financial statements.
Statement of Stockholders’ Equity
The statement of stockholders’ equity breaks down the stockholders’ equity computed 
on the balance sheet into the amount that came from issuing shares (par value plus paid-in 
capital) versus retained earnings. Because the book value of stockholders’ equity is not a 
useful assessment of value for financial purposes, financial managers use the statement of 
stockholders’ equity infrequently (so we will skip the computational details here). We can,

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
however, determine the change in stockholders’ equity using information from the firm’s 
other financial statements as follows:7
 Change in Stockholders’ Equity = Retained Earnings + Net sales of stock
	
 = Net Income - Dividends +
	
 Sales of stock - Repurchases of stock
(2.7)
For example, because Global had no stock sales or repurchases, its stockholders’ equity 
increased by the amount of its retained earnings, or $1.0 million, in 2015. Note that this 
result matches the change in stockholders’ equity shown earlier on Global’s balance sheet.
Management Discussion and Analysis
The management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is a preface to the financial state-
ments in which the company’s management discusses the recent year (or quarter), providing 
a background on the company and any significant events that may have occurred. Manage-
ment may also discuss the coming year, and outline goals, new projects, and future plans.
Management should also discuss any important risks that the firm faces or issues that 
may affect the firm’s liquidity or resources. Management is also required to disclose any 
off-balance sheet transactions, which are transactions or arrangements that can have a 
material impact on the firm’s future performance yet do not appear on the balance sheet. 
For example, if a firm has made guarantees that it will compensate a buyer for losses related 
to an asset purchased from the firm, these guarantees represent a potential future liability 
for the firm that must be disclosed as part of the MD&A.
Notes to the Financial Statements
In addition to the four financial statements, companies provide extensive notes with ­further 
details on the information provided in the statements. For example, the notes document 
important accounting assumptions that were used in preparing the statements. They often 
provide information specific to a firm’s subsidiaries or its separate product lines. They show 
the details of the firm’s stock-based compensation plans for employees and the different 
types of debt the firm has outstanding. Details of acquisitions, spin-offs, leases, taxes, debt 
repayment schedules, and risk management activities are also given. The information pro-
vided in the notes is often very important to interpret fully the firm’s financial statements.
7Sales of stock would also include any stock-based compensation.

2.6	 Financial Statement Analysis
Investors often use accounting statements to evaluate a firm in one of two ways:
	
1.	 Compare the firm with itself by analyzing how the firm has changed over time.
	
2.	 Compare the firm to other similar firms using a common set of financial ratios.
In this section we will describe the most commonly used ratios—related to profitability, 
liquidity, working capital, interest coverage, leverage, valuation, and operating returns—
and explain how each one is used in practice.
Profitability Ratios
The income statement provides very useful information regarding the profitability of a 
firm’s business and how it relates to the value of the firm’s shares. The gross margin of a 
firm is the ratio of gross profit to revenues (sales):
	
Gross Margin = Gross Profit
Sales

(2.8)
A firm’s gross margin reflects its ability to sell a product for more than the cost of produc-
ing it. For example, in 2015, Global had gross margin of 33.3/186.7 = 17.8%.
Because there are additional expenses of operating a business beyond the direct costs 
of goods sold, another important profitability ratio is the operating margin, the ratio of 
operating income to revenues:
	
Operating Margin =
Operating Income
Sales

(2.9)
The operating margin reveals how much a company earns before interest and taxes from 
each dollar of sales. In 2015, Global’s operating margin was 10.4/186.7 = 5.57%, an 
increase from its 2014 operating margin of 7.1/176.1 = 4.03%. We can similarly compute 
a firm’s EBIT margin = (EBIT/Sales).
By comparing operating or EBIT margins across firms within an industry, we can 
assess the relative efficiency of the firms’ operations. For example, Figure 2.1 compares 
the EBIT margins of five major U.S. airlines from 2007 to 2012. Notice the impact on 
profitability from the financial crisis during 2008–2009, as well as the consistently low 
profits of the largest and oldest of the carriers, United-Continental (UAL), relative to its 
competitors.
Concept Check	
1.	 Where do off-balance sheet transactions appear in a firm’s financial statements?
	
2.	 What information do the notes to financial statements provide?
Solution
The percentage growth in the sales of grocery products was 1558/1518 - 1 = 2.6%. Similarly, 
growth in Refrigerated Foods was 9.2%, Jennie-O Turkey Store was 4.4%, Specialty Foods was 
- 2.7%, and International and Other categories were 19.2%. Thus, International and Other 
categories showed the highest growth.
If these growth rates continue for another year, sales of Grocery Products will be 1558 * 
1.026 = $1598 million, and the other categories will be $5071 million, $1746 million, $883 mil-
lion, and $637 million, respectively, for total revenues of $9.9 billion, a 6.7% increase over 2014.
	
2.6  Financial Statement Analysis

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
In addition to the efficiency of operations, differences in operating margins can result 
from corporate strategy. For example, in 2014, high-end retailer Nordstrom ( JWN) had an 
operating margin of 9.8%; Wal-Mart Stores (WMT, brand name Walmart) had an operat-
ing margin of only 5.6%. In this case, Walmart’s lower operating margin was not a result 
of its inefficiency. Rather, the low operating margin is part of Walmart’s strategy of offering 
low prices to sell common products in high volume. Indeed, Walmart’s sales were nearly 
36 times higher than those of Nordstrom.
Finally, a firm’s net profit margin is the ratio of net income to revenues:
	
Net Profit Margin = Net Income
 Sales

(2.10)
The net profit margin shows the fraction of each dollar in revenues that is available to 
equity holders after the firm pays interest and taxes. In 2015, Global’s net profit margin 
was 2.0/186.7 = 1.07%. One must be cautious when comparing net profit margins: 
While differences in net profit margins can be due to differences in efficiency, they 
can also result from differences in leverage, which determines the amount of interest 
expense, as well as differences in accounting assumptions.
Liquidity Ratios
Financial analysts often use the information in the firm’s balance sheet to assess its ­financial 
solvency or liquidity. Specifically, creditors often compare a firm’s current assets and current

liabilities to assess whether the firm has sufficient working capital to meet its ­short-term 
needs. This comparison can be summarized in the firm’s current ratio, the ratio of current 
assets to current liabilities:
Current Ratio =
Current Assets
Current Liabilities
Notice that Global’s current ratio increased from 48/44 = 1.09 in 2014 to 57/48 = 1.19 
in 2015.
A more stringent test of the firm’s liquidity is the quick ratio, which compares only cash 
and “near cash” assets, such as short-term investments and accounts receivable, to current 
liabilities. In 2015, Global’s quick ratio was (21.2 + 18.5)/48 = 0.83. A higher current or 
quick ratio implies less risk of the firm experiencing a cash shortfall in the near future. A 
reason to exclude inventory is that it may not be that liquid; indeed an increase in the cur-
rent ratio that results from an unusual increase in inventory could be an indicator that the 
firm is having difficulty selling its products.
Ultimately, firms need cash to pay employees and meet other obligations. Running out 
of cash can be very costly for a firm, so firms often gauge their cash position by calculating 
the cash ratio, which is the most stringent liquidity ratio:
Cash Ratio =
Cash
Current Liabilities
Of course, all of these liquidity ratios are limited in that they only consider the firm’s 
current assets. If the firm is able to generate significant cash quickly from its ongoing 
activities, it might be highly liquid even if these ratios are poor.
Example 2.4 
Computing Liquidity Ratios
Problem
Calculate Global’s quick ratio and cash ratio. Based on these measures, how has its liquidity 
changed between 2014 and 2015?
Solution
In 2014, Global’s quick ratio was (19.5 + 13.2)/44 = 0.74 and its cash ratio was 19.5/44 = 0.44. 
In 2015, these ratios were 0.83 and 21.2/48 = 0.44, respectively. Thus, Global’s cash ratio 
remained stable over this period, while its quick ratio improved slightly. But although these 
liquidity ­measures have not deteriorated, a more worrisome indicator for investors regarding 
Global’s liquidity might be its ongoing negative cash flow from operating and investing activi-
ties, shown in the statement of cash flows.
Working Capital Ratios
We can use the combined information in the firm’s income statement and balance sheet 
to gauge how efficiently the firm is utilizing its net working capital. To evaluate the 
speed at which a company turns sales into cash, firms often compute the number of 
	
2.6  Financial Statement Analysis	
71

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
accounts receivable days—that is, the number of days’ worth of sales accounts receiv-
able represents:8
	
Accounts Receivable Days = Accounts Receivable
Average Daily Sales 
(2.11)
Given average daily sales of $186.7 million/365 = $0.51 million in 2015, Global’s 
receivables of $18.5 million represent 18.5/0.51 = 36 days’ worth of sales. In other 
words, on average, Global takes a little over one month to collect payment from its cus-
tomers. In 2014, Global’s accounts receivable represented only 27 days’ worth of sales. 
Although the number of receivable days can fluctuate seasonally, a significant unex-
plained increase could be a cause for concern (perhaps indicating the firm is doing a 
poor job of collecting from its customers or is trying to boost sales by offering generous 
credit terms).
There are similar ratios for accounts payable and inventory. For these items, it is natural 
to compare them to the firm’s cost of sales, which should reflect the total amount paid to 
suppliers and inventory sold. Therefore, accounts payable days is defined as:
	
Accounts Payable Days =
Accounts Payable
Average Daily Cost of Sales
(2.12)
Similarly, inventory days = (inventory/average daily cost of sales).9
Turnover ratios are an alternative way to measure working capital. We compute turn-
over ratios by expressing annual revenues or costs as a multiple of the corresponding work-
ing capital account. For example,
	
Inventory Turnover = Annual Cost of Sales
Inventory

(2.13)
Global’s inventory turnover in 2015 is 153.4/15.3 = 10.0*, indicating that Global 
sold roughly 10 times its current stock of inventory during the year. Similarly, accounts 
­receivable turnover = (annual sales/accounts receivable) and accounts payable turn­
over = (annual cost of sales/accounts payable). Note that higher turnover corresponds to 
shorter days, and thus a more efficient use of working capital.
While working capital ratios can be meaningfully compared over time or within an 
industry, there are wide differences across industries. While the average large U.S. firm had 
about 49 days’ worth of receivables and 54 days’ worth of inventory in 2015, airlines tend 
to have minimal accounts receivable or inventory, as their customers pay in advance and 
they sell a transportation service as opposed to a physical commodity. On the other hand, 
distillers and wine producers tend to have very large inventory (over 300 days on average), 
as their products are often aged prior to sale.
Interest Coverage Ratios
Lenders often assess a firm’s ability to meet its interest obligations by comparing its earn-
ings with its interest expenses using an interest coverage ratio. One common ratio to 
consider is the firm’s EBIT as a multiple of its interest expenses. A high ratio indicates that 
the firm is earning much more than is necessary to meet its required interest payments. 
8Accounts receivable days can also be calculated based on the average accounts receivable at the end of the 
current and prior year.
9As with accounts receivable days, these ratios can also be calculated using the average accounts payable or 
inventory balance from the current and prior year.

As a benchmark, creditors often look for an EBIT/Interest coverage ratio in excess of 5* 
for high-quality borrowers. When EBIT/Interest falls below 1.5, lenders may begin to 
question a company’s ability to repay its debts.
Depreciation and amortization expenses are deducted when computing EBIT, but they 
are not actually cash expenses for the firm. Consequently, financial analysts often compute 
a firm’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, as a 
measure of the cash a firm generates from its operations and has available to make interest 
payments:10
	
EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation and Amortization
(2.14)
We can similarly compute the firm’s EBITDA/Interest coverage ratio.
10Because firms often do not separately list depreciation and amortization expenses on the income statement, 
EBITDA is generally calculated by combining EBIT from the income statement and depreciation and amortiza-
tion from the statement of cash flows. Note also that because the firm may ultimately need to invest to replace 
depreciating assets, EBITDA is best viewed as a measure of the firm’s short-run ability to meet interest payments.
Example 2.5 
Computing Interest Coverage Ratios
Problem
Assess Global’s ability to meet its interest obligations by calculating interest coverage ratios using 
both EBIT and EBITDA.
Solution
In 2014 and 2015, Global had the following interest coverage ratios:
2014:  EBIT
Interest = 7.1
4.6 = 1.54 and EBITDA
Interest = 7.1 + 1.1
4.6
= 1.78
2015:  EBIT
Interest = 10.4
7.7 =1.35 and EBITDA
Interest = 10.4 + 1.2
7.7
= 1.51
In this case Global’s low—and declining—interest coverage could be a source of concern for its 
creditors.
Leverage Ratios
An important piece of information that we can learn from a firm’s balance sheet is the 
firm’s leverage, or the extent to which it relies on debt as a source of financing. The debt-
equity ratio is a common ratio used to assess a firm’s leverage. We calculate this ratio by 
dividing the total amount of short- and long-term debt (including current maturities) by 
the total stockholders’ equity:
	
Debt@Equity Ratio = Total Debt
Total Equity
(2.15)
We can calculate the debt-equity ratio using either book or market values for equity and 
debt. From Table 2.1, Global’s debt in 2015 includes notes payable ($3.5 million), current

74	
Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
12While net debt should ideally be calculated by deducting cash in excess of the firm’s operating needs, 
absent additional information, it is typical in practice to deduct all cash on the balance sheet.
maturities of long-term debt ($13.3 million), and long-term debt ($99.9 million), for a 
total of $116.7 million. Therefore, its book debt-equity ratio is 116.7/22.2 = 5.3, using 
the book value of equity. Note the increase from 2014, when the book debt-equity ratio 
was only (3.2 + 12.3 + 76.3)/21.2 = 91.8/21.2 = 4.3.
Because of the difficulty interpreting the book value of equity, the book debt-equity 
ratio is not especially useful. Indeed, the book value of equity might even be negative, mak-
ing the ratio meaningless. For example, Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) has, based on the strength 
of its cash flow, consistently borrowed in excess of the book value of its assets. In 2014, 
it had debt of $1.8 billion, with a total book value of assets of only $600 million and an 
equity book value of -$1.2 billion!
It is therefore most informative to compare the firm’s debt to the market value of its equity. 
Recall from Example 2.1 that in 2015, the total market value of Global’s equity, its ­market 
capitalization, is 3.6 million shares * $14/share = $50.4 million. Therefore, Global’s ­market 
debt-equity ratio in 2015 is 116.7/50.4 = 2.3, which means Global’s debt is a bit more than 
double the market value of its equity.11 As we show later in the text, a firm’s market debt-equity 
ratio has important consequences for the risk and return of its stock.
We can also calculate the fraction of the firm financed by debt in terms of its debt-to-
capital ratio:
	
Debt@to@Capital Ratio =
Total Debt
Total Equity + Total Debt
(2.16)
Again, this ratio can be computed using book or market values.
While leverage increases the risk to the firm’s equity holders, firms may also hold cash 
reserves in order to reduce risk. Thus, another useful measure to consider is the firm’s net 
debt, or debt in excess of its cash reserves:
	
Net Debt = Total Debt - Excess Cash & Short@term Investments
(2.17)
To understand why net debt may be a more relevant measure of leverage, consider a firm 
with more cash than debt outstanding: Because such a firm could pay off its debts imme-
diately using its available cash, it has not increased its risk and has no effective leverage.
Analogous to the debt-to-capital ratio, we can use the concept of net debt to compute 
the firm’s debt-to-enterprise value ratio:
	
 Debt@to@Enterprise Value Ratio =
Net Debt
Market Value of Equity + Net Debt
	
 =
Net Debt
Enterprise Value
(2.18)
Given Global’s 2015 cash balance of $21.2 million, and total long- and short-term debt of 
$116.7 million, its net debt is 116.7 - 21.2 = $95.5 million.12 Given its ­market value of 
equity of $50.4 million, Global’s enterprise value in 2015 is 50.4 + 95.5 = $145.9 million, 
11In this calculation, we have compared the market value of equity to the book value of debt. Strictly 
speaking, it would be best to use the market value of debt. But because the market value of debt is 
­generally not very different from its book value, this distinction is often ignored in practice.

and thus its debt-to-enterprise value ratio is 95.5/145.9 = 65.5%. That is, 65.5% of 
­Global’s underlying business activity is financed via debt.
A final measure of leverage is a firm’s equity multiplier, measured in book value 
terms as Total Assets/Book Value of Equity. As we will see shortly, this measure captures 
the amplification of the firm’s accounting returns that results from leverage. The market 
value equity multiplier, which is generally measured as Enterprise Value/Market Value 
of Equity, indicates the amplification of shareholders’ financial risk that results from 
leverage.
Valuation Ratios
Analysts use a number of ratios to gauge the market value of the firm. The most common 
is the firm’s price-earnings ratio (P/E):
	
P/E Ratio =
Market Capitalization
Net Income
=
Share Price
Earnings per Share
(2.19)
That is, the P/E ratio is the ratio of the value of equity to the firm’s earnings, either 
on a total basis or on a per-share basis. For example, Global’s P/E ratio in 2015 was 
50.4/2.0 = 14/0.556 = 25.2. In other words, investors are willing to pay over 25 times 
Global’s earnings to purchase a share.
The P/E ratio is a simple measure that is used to assess whether a stock is over- or under-
valued based on the idea that the value of a stock should be proportional to the level of 
earnings it can generate for its shareholders. P/E ratios can vary widely across industries 
and tend to be highest for industries with high expected growth rates. For example, in late 
2015, the median large U.S. firm had a P/E ratio of about 21. But software firms, which 
tend to have above-average growth rates, had an average P/E ratio of 38, while automotive 
firms, which have experienced slower growth since the recession, had an average P/E ratio 
of about 15. The risk of the firm will also affect this ratio—all else equal, riskier firms have 
lower P/E ratios.
Because the P/E ratio considers the value of the firm’s equity, it is sensitive to the 
firm’s choice of leverage. The P/E ratio is therefore of limited usefulness when compar-
ing firms with markedly different leverage. We can avoid this limitation by instead 
assessing the market value of the underlying business using valuation ratios based on 
the firm’s enterprise value. Common ratios include the ratio of enterprise value to rev-
enue, or enterprise value to operating income, EBIT, or EBITDA. These ratios compare 
the value of the business to its sales, operating profits, or cash flow. Like the P/E ratio, 
these ratios are used to make intra-industry comparisons of how firms are priced in the 
market.
	
2.6  Financial Statement Analysis

Mismatched Ratios
When considering valuation (and other) ratios, be sure that 
the items you are comparing both represent amounts related 
to the entire firm or that both represent amounts related solely 
to equity holders. For example, a firm’s share price and market 
capitalization are values associated with the firm’s equity. Thus, 
it makes sense to compare them to the firm’s earnings per 
share or net income, which are amounts to equity ­holders after 
interest has been paid to debt holders. We must be careful, 
however, if we compare a firm’s market capitalization to its rev-
enues, operating income, or EBITDA because these amounts 
are related to the whole firm, and both debt and equity holders 
have a claim to them. Thus, it is better to ­compare revenues, 
operating income, or EBITDA to the enterprise value of the 
firm, which includes both debt and equity.
Common Mistake

76	
Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
The P/E ratio, or ratios to EBIT or EBITDA, are not meaningful if the firm’s earnings 
are negative. In this case, it is common to look at the firm’s enterprise value relative to sales. 
The risk in doing so, however, is that earnings might be negative because the firm’s under-
lying business model is fundamentally flawed, as was the case for many Internet firms in 
the late 1990s.
Operating Returns
Analysts often evaluate the firm’s return on investment by comparing its income to its 
investment using ratios such as the firm’s return on equity (ROE):13
	
Return on Equity =
Net Income
Book Value of Equity
(2.20)
Global’s ROE in 2015 was 2.0/22.2 = 9.0%. The ROE provides a measure of the return 
that the firm has earned on its past investments. A high ROE may indicate the firm is able 
to find investment opportunities that are very profitable.
13Because net income is measured over the year, the ROE can also be calculated based on the average book 
value of equity at the end of the current and prior year.
Example 2.6 
Computing Profitability and Valuation Ratios
Problem
Consider the following data as of July 2015 for Walmart and Target Corporation (in $ billion):
Compare Walmart’s and Target’s EBIT margins, net profit margins, P/E ratios, and the ratio 
of enterprise value to sales, EBIT, and EBITDA.
Solution
Walmart had an EBIT Margin of 26.6/485.7 = 5.5%, a net profit margin of 16.2/485.7 = 3.3%, 
and a P/E ratio of 235.6/16.2 = 14.5. Its enterprise value was 235.6 + 48.8 - 9.1 = 275.3 bil­
lion, which has a ratio of 275.3/485.7 = 0.57 to sales, 275.3/26.6 = 10.3 to EBIT, and 
275.3/(26.6 + 9.2) = 7.7 to EBITDA.
Target had an EBIT margin of 4.5/73.3 = 6.2%, a net profit margin of 2.5/73.1 = 3.4%, and 
a P/E ratio of 52.9/2.5 = 21.2. Its enterprise value was 52.9 = 12.8 - 2.2 = $63.5 billion, which 
has a ratio of 63.4/73.1 = 0.87 to sales, 63.5/4.5 = 14.1 to EBIT, and 63.5/(4.5 + 2.1) = 9.6 to 
EBITDA.
Note that despite the large difference in the size of the two firms, Target trades at higher, 
though comparable, multiples.

Another common measure is return on assets (ROA), which we calculate as:14
	
Return on Assets = Net Income + Interest Expense
Book Value of Assets

(2.21)
The ROA calculation includes interest expense in the numerator because the assets in the 
denominator have been funded by both debt and equity investors.
As a performance measure, ROA has the benefit that it is less sensitive to leverage than 
ROE. However, it is sensitive to working capital––for example, an equal increase in the 
firm’s receivables and payables will increase total assets and thus lower ROA. To avoid this 
problem, we can consider the firm’s return on invested capital (ROIC):
	
Return on Invested Capital =
EBIT (1 - tax rate)
Book Value of Equity + Net Debt
(2.22)
The return on invested capital measures the after-tax profit generated by the business itself, 
excluding any interest expenses (or interest income), and compares it to the capital raised 
from equity and debt holders that has already been deployed (i.e., is not held as cash). Of 
the three measures of operating returns, ROIC is the most useful in assessing the perfor-
mance of the underlying business.
14ROA is sometimes calculated as Net Income/Assets, inappropriately ignoring the returns generated by 
the assets that are being used to support the firm’s debt obligations (see also the box on Mismatched Ratios 
on page 75). Also, the interest expense that is added back is sometimes done on an after-tax basis in order 
to eliminate the benefit of the tax savings provided by debt. Finally, as with ROE, the average book value 
of assets at the beginning and end of the year may be used.
Example 2.7 
Computing Operating Returns
Problem
Assess how Global’s ability to use its assets effectively has changed in the last year by computing 
the change in its return on assets and return on invested capital.
Solution
In 2015, Global’s ROA was (2.0 + 7.7)/177.7 = 5.5%, compared to an ROA in 2014 of 
(1.9 + 4.6)/148.9 = 4.4%.
To compute the return on invested capital, we need to calculate after-tax EBIT, which 
requires an estimate of Global’s tax rate. Because Net income = Pretax income * (1 - tax rate), 
we can estimate (1 - tax rate) = Net income/Pretax income. Thus, EBIT * (1 - tax rate) = 
10.4 * (2.0/2.7) = 7.7 in 2015, and 7.1 * (1.9/2.5) = 5.4 in 2014.
To compute invested capital, note first that Global’s net debt was 3.2 + 12.3 + 76.3 - 19.5 = 
72.3 in 2014 and 3.5 + 13.3 + 99.9 - 21.2 = 95.5 in 2015. Thus, ROIC in 2015 was 
7.7/(22.2 + 95.5) = 6.5%, compared with 5.4/(21.2 + 72.3) = 5.8% in 2014.
The improvement in Global’s ROA and ROIC from 2014 to 2015 suggests that Global was 
able to use its assets more effectively and increase its return over this period.

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
To conclude our discussion of financial ratios, Table 2.4 presents the various measures of profit-
ability, liquidity, working capital, interest coverage, leverage, valuation, and operating returns.
The DuPont Identity
We can gain further insight into a firm’s ROE using a tool called the DuPont Identity 
(named for the company that popularized its use), which expresses the ROE in terms of the 
firm’s profitability, asset efficiency, and leverage:
	
ROE = ¢ Net Income
Sales
≤* ¢
Sales
Total Assets≤* ¢
Total Assets
Book Value of Equity≤
(2.23)
The first term in the DuPont Identity is the firm’s net profit margin, which measures its 
overall profitability. The second term is the firm’s asset turnover, which measures how 
efficiently the firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales. Together, these terms determine 
the firm’s return on assets. We compute ROE by multiplying by a measure of leverage 
called the equity multiplier, which indicates the value of assets held per dollar of share-
holder equity. The greater the firm’s reliance on debt financing, the higher the equity 
multiplier will be. Applying this identity to Global, we see that in 2015 its asset turnover 
is 186.7/177.7 = 1.05, with an equity multiplier of 177.7/22.2 = 8. Given its net profit 
margin of 1.07%, we can compute its ROE as
ROE = 9.0% = 1.07% * 1.05 * 8

Determinants of ROE
Problem
For the year ended January 2015, Walmart (WMT) had sales of $485.7 billion, net income 
of $16.2 billion, assets of $203.7 billion, and a book value of equity of $85.9 billion. For the 
same period, Target (TGT) had sales of $73.1 billion, net income of $2.5 billion, total assets of 
$41.4 billion, and a a book value of equity of $14 billion. Compare these firms’ profitability, 
asset turnover, equity multipliers, and return on equity during this period. If Target had been 
able to match Walmart’s asset turnover during this period, what would its ROE have been?
Solution
Walmart’s net profit margin (from Example 2.6) was 16.2/485.7 = 3.34%, which was just below 
Target’s net profit margin of 2.5/73.1 = 3.42%. On the other hand, Walmart used its assets more 
efficiently, with an asset turnover of 485.7/203.7 = 2.38, compared to only 73.1/41.4 = 1.77 for 
Target. Finally, Target had greater leverage (in terms of book value), with an equity multiplier of 
41.4/14 = 2.96, relative to Walmart’s equity multiplier of 203.7/85.9 = 2.37. Next, let’s compute 
the ROE of each firm directly, and using the DuPont Identity:
 Walmart ROE = 16.2
85.9 = 18.8% = 3.34% * 2.38 * 2.37
 Target ROE = 2.5
14 = 17.9% = 3.42% * 1.77 * 2.96
Note that due to its lower asset turnover, Target had a lower ROE than Walmart despite its 
higher net profit margin and leverage. If Target had been able to match Walmart’s asset turnover, 
its ROE would have been significantly higher: 3.42% * 2.38 * 2.96 = 24.1%.

2.7	 Financial Reporting in Practice
The various financial statements we have examined are of critical importance to investors 
and financial managers alike. Even with safeguards such as GAAP and auditors, though, 
financial reporting abuses unfortunately do take place. We now review two of the most 
infamous examples.
Enron
Enron was the most well known of the accounting scandals of the early 2000s. Enron 
started as an operator of natural-gas pipelines but evolved into a global trader dealing in a 
range of products including gas, oil, electricity, and even broadband Internet capacity. A 
series of events unfolded that, in December 2001, led Enron to file what was, at the time, 
the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. By the end of that year, the market value of 
Enron’s shares had fallen by over $60 billion.
Interestingly, throughout the 1990s and up to late 2001, Enron was touted as one of 
the most successful and profitable companies in America. Fortune rated Enron “The Most 
Innovative Company in America” for six straight years, from 1995 to 2000. But while 
many aspects of Enron’s business were successful, subsequent investigations suggest that 
Enron executives had been manipulating Enron’s financial statements to mislead investors 
and artificially inflate the price of Enron’s stock and maintain its credit rating. In 2000, for 
example, 96% of Enron’s reported earnings were the result of accounting manipulation.15
Although the accounting manipulations that Enron used were quite sophisticated, the 
essence of most of the deceptive transactions was surprisingly simple. Enron sold assets at 
inflated prices to other firms (or, in many cases, business entities that Enron’s CFO Andrew 
Fastow had created), together with a promise to buy back those assets at an even higher future 
price. Thus, Enron was effectively borrowing money, receiving cash today in exchange for a 
promise to pay more cash in the future. But Enron recorded the incoming cash as revenue and 
then hid the promises to buy them back in a variety of ways.16 In the end, much of Enron’s 
revenue growth and profits in the late 1990s were the result of this type of manipulation.
WorldCom
Enron’s record as the largest bankruptcy of all time lasted only until July 21, 2002, 
when WorldCom, which at its peak had a market capitalization of $120 billion, filed for 
­bankruptcy. Again, a series of accounting manipulations beginning in 1998 hid the firm’s 
financial problems from investors.
In WorldCom’s case, the fraud was to reclassify $3.85 billion in operating expenses 
as long-term capital expenditures. The immediate impact of this change was to boost 
15John R. Kroger, “Enron, Fraud and Securities Reform: An Enron Prosecutor’s Perspective,” University of 
Colorado Law Review (December 2009): pp. 57–138.
16In some cases, these promises were called “price risk management liabilities” and hidden with other 
­trading activities; in other cases they were off-balance sheet transactions that were not fully disclosed.
Concept Check	
1.	 Why is EBITDA used to assess a firm’s ability to meet its interest obligations?
	
2.	 What is the difference between a firm’s book debt-equity ratio and its market debt-equity ratio?
	
3.	 To compare the valuations of firms with very different leverage, which valuation multiples would be 
most appropriate?
	
4.	 What is the DuPont Identity?

WorldCom’s reported earnings: Operating expenses are deducted from earnings immedi-
ately, whereas capital expenditures are depreciated slowly over time. Of course, this manip-
ulation would not boost WorldCom’s cash flows, because long-term investments must be 
deducted on the cash flow statement at the time they are made.
Some investors were concerned by WorldCom’s excessive investment compared to the 
rest of the industry. As one investment advisor commented, “Red flags [were] things like 
big deviations between reported earnings and excess cash flow . . . [and] excessive capital 
expenditures for a long period of time. That was what got us out of WorldCom in 1999.”17
Sarbanes-Oxley Act
The Enron and Worldcom scandals had an immediate and tangible impact on the 
­accounting world. Both firms had been audited by the same accounting firm, Arthur 
Andersen, and accusations begin to emerge about their business practices in late 2001. By 
March 2002, Arthur Andersen was indicted on charges following from the Enron case, and 
it was convicted in June. With its reputation destroyed, the firm quickly collapsed, leaving 
its clients to find new auditors. These new auditors had a strong incentive to “clean house” 
and as a result new instances of errors and/or outright fraud were uncovered. ­Professors 
Alexander Dyck, Adair Morse, and Luigi Zingales used this event to estimate that nearly 
15% of firms may have engaged in some form of financial misrepresentation, and that such 
fraud costs investors on average 22% of the firm’s enterprise value.18
In an attempt to improve the reliability of financial reporting and corporate governance, 
Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) in 2002. While SOX contains many provi-
sions, the overall intent of the legislation was to improve the accuracy of information given 
to both boards and shareholders. SOX attempted to achieve this goal in three ways: (1) 
by overhauling incentives and the independence in the auditing process, (2) by stiffening 
penalties for providing false information, and (3) by forcing companies to validate their 
internal financial control processes.
Because auditors often have a long-standing relationship with their clients and receive 
lucrative auditing and consulting fees from them, their desire to continue earning these 
fees may make auditors less willing to challenge management. SOX addressed this concern 
by putting strict limits on the amount of non-audit fees (consulting or otherwise) that an 
accounting firm can earn from a company that it audits. It also required that audit partners 
rotate every five years to limit the likelihood that auditing relationships become too cozy 
over long periods of time. Finally, SOX called on the SEC to force companies to have audit 
committees that are dominated by outside directors, with at least one outside director hav-
ing a financial background.
SOX also stiffened the criminal penalties for providing false information to shareholders 
(fines of up to $5 million and up to 20 years imprisonment), and required both the CEO 
and CFO to personally attest to the accuracy of the firm’s financial statements. Further-
more, CEOs and CFOs must return bonuses or profits from the sale of stock that are later 
shown to be due to misstated financial reports.
Finally, Section 404 of SOX requires senior management and the boards of public com-
panies to validate and certify the process through which funds are allocated and controlled, 
and outcomes are monitored. Section 404 has arguably garnered more attention than any 
other section in SOX because of the large potential compliance costs that it places on firms.

These costs can be especially significant (in percentage terms) for small companies, and 
critics have argued that they are sufficiently onerous to cause some firms to avoid them by 
remaining privately held.20
Dodd-Frank Act
To mitigate the compliance burden on small firms, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
and Consumer Protection Act passed in 2010 exempts firms with less than $75 million 
in publicly held shares from the SOX Section 404 requirements. It also requires the SEC 
to study how it might reduce cost for medium-sized firms with a public float of less than 
$250 million, and to assess whether such measures would encourage more firms to list on 
U.S. exchanges.
Dodd-Frank also broadened the whistleblower provisions of SOX, so that an indi-
vidual who provides “information related to a possible violation of the federal securi-
ties laws (including any rules or regulations thereunder)” that results in penalties or 
recoveries by the SEC or agencies is eligible to receive from 10 to 30% of that penalty 
or recovery.

capital to pay off the investors who wanted to withdraw 
their capital, and the scheme finally collapsed.* 
How was Madoff able to hide perhaps the largest fraud 
of all time for so long? Rather than simply manipulate his 
accounting statements, Madoff made them up with the assis-
tance of a virtually unknown accounting firm with only 
one active accountant. Although many investors may have 
questioned why such a large fund, with $65 billion in assets, 
would choose an unknown and tiny audit firm, not enough 
of them recognized this choice as a potential red flag. In addi-
tion, because Madoff’s firm was private, it was not subject 
to the strict regulatory requirements for public companies 
(such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and so had weak report-
ing requirements. As this case makes clear, when making an 
investment decision, it is important not only to review the 
firm’s financial statements, but also to consider the reliability 
and reputation of the auditors who prepared them.
*For reasons why fraud may be more likely to occur in booms, and  
then exposed in downturns, see P. Povel, R. Singh, and A. Winton, 
“Booms, Busts, and Fraud,” Review of Financial Studies 20 (2007): 
1219–1254.
19$65 billion is the total amount Madoff had reported to his investors, including (fictitious) returns; 
investigators are still trying to determine the exact amount that investors had actually contributed to the 
fund, but it appears to be in excess of $17 billion (see www.madofftrustee.com).
“It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been 
­swimming naked.” 
—Warren Buffett
On December 11, 2008, federal agents arrested Bernie 
Madoff, one of the largest and most successful hedge fund 
managers. It turned out that the $65 billion19 fund he ran 
was in fact a fraud. His spectacular performance of the last 
17 years, generating consistent annual returns between 10% 
and 15%, was actually a complete fabrication. Madoff had 
been running the world’s largest Ponzi scheme: That is, he 
used the capital contributed by new investors to pay off old 
investors. His strategy was so successful that for more than a 
decade investors ranging from Steven Spielberg to New 
York University, as well as a number of large banks and 
investment advisors, lined up to invest with him. Indeed, 
Madoff quite likely would have been able to hide the fraud 
until his deathbed had not the global financial crisis spurred 
many investors to seek to withdraw funds from their Madoff 
accounts in order to raise cash and cover losses elsewhere in 
their portfolios. In addition, the financial crisis meant there 
were few new investors with both the cash and the willing-
ness to invest. As a result, Madoff did not have enough new

Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi Scheme

2.1  Firms’ Disclosure of Financial Information
	
n	 Financial statements are accounting reports that a firm issues periodically to describe its past 
performance.
	
n	 Investors, financial analysts, managers, and other interested parties such as creditors rely on 
financial statements to obtain reliable information about a corporation.
	
n	 The four required financial statements are the balance sheet, the income statement, the state-
ment of cash flows, and the statement of stockholders’ equity.
2.2  The Balance Sheet
	
n	 The balance sheet shows the current financial position (assets, liabilities, and stockholders’ 
equity) of the firm at a single point in time.
	
n	 The two sides of the balance sheet must balance:
	
Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity
(2.1)
	
n	 The firm’s net working capital, which is the capital available in the short term to run the business, 
is the difference between the firm’s current assets and current liabilities. Excluding cash and debt, 
key components of net working capital are accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.
	
n	 Many assets (such as property, plant, and equipment) are listed on the firm’s balance sheet based 
on their historical cost rather than their current market value, whereas other assets (such as 
customer relationships) are not listed at all.
	
n	 Stockholders’ equity is the book value of the firm’s equity. It differs from market value of the 
firm’s equity, its market capitalization, because of the way assets and liabilities are recorded for 
accounting purposes. A successful firm’s market-to-book ratio typically exceeds 1.
	
n	 The enterprise value of a firm is the total value of its underlying business operations:
	
Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash
(2.4)
2.3  The Income Statement
	
n	 The income statement reports the firm’s revenues and expenses, and it computes the firm’s bot-
tom line of net income, or earnings, over a given time interval.
	
n	 The firm’s operating income is equal to its revenues less its cost of goods sold and operating 
expenses. After adjusting for other, non-operating income or expenses, we have the firm’s earn-
ings before interest and taxes, or EBIT.
	
n	 Deducting interest and taxes from EBIT gives the firm’s net income, which we can divide by the 
number of shares outstanding to calculate earnings per share (EPS).
2.4  The Statement of Cash Flows
	
n	 The statement of cash flows reports the sources and uses of the firm’s cash during a given time 
period, and can be derived from the firm’s income statement and the changes in the firm’s bal-
ance sheet.
	
n	 The statement of cash flows shows the cash used (or provided) from operating, investing, and 
financing activities.
2.5  Other Financial Statement Information
	
n	 The change in stockholders’ equity can be computed as retained earnings (net income less divi-
dends) plus net sales of stock (new grants or issuances, net of repurchases).
	
n	 The management discussion and analysis section of the financial statements contains manage-
ment’s overview of the firm’s performance, as well as disclosure of risks the firm faces, including 
those from off-balance sheet transactions.

Chapter 2  Introduction to ­Financial ­Statement Analysis 
	
n	 The notes to a firm’s financial statements generally contain important details regarding the 
numbers used in the main statements.
2.6  Financial Statement Analysis
	
n	 Financial ratios allow us to (i) compare the firm’s performance over time, and (ii) compare the 
firm to other similar firms.
	
n	 Key financial ratios measure the firm’s profitability, liquidity, working capital, interest coverage, 
leverage, valuation, and operating returns. See Table 2.4 for a summary.
	
n	 EBITDA measures the cash a firm generates before capital investments:
	
EBITDA = EBIT + Depreciation and Amortization
(2.14)
	
n	 Net debt measures the firm’s debt in excess of its cash reserves:
	
Net Debt = Total Debt - Excess Cash & Short@term Investments
(2.17)
	
n	 The DuPont Identity expresses a firm’s ROE in terms of its profitability, asset efficiency, and 
leverage:
	
ROE = ¢ Net Income

Total Assets ≤* ¢

2012–2016 Financial Statement Data and Stock Price Data 
for Mydeco Corp.

The Income Statement
	
11.	 Suppose that in 2016, Global launches an aggressive marketing campaign that boosts sales by 
15%. However, their operating margin falls from 5.57% to 4.50%. Suppose that they have 
no other income, interest expenses are unchanged, and taxes are the same percentage of pretax 
income as in 2015.
a.	 What is Global’s EBIT in 2016?
b.	 What is Global’s net income in 2016?
c.	 If Global’s P/E ratio and number of shares outstanding remains unchanged, what is Global’s 
share price in 2016?
	
12.	 Find online the annual 10-K report for Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST) for fiscal year 
2015 (filed in October 2015). Answer the following questions from their income statement:
a.	 What were Costco’s revenues for fiscal year 2015? By what percentage did revenues grow 
from the prior year?
b.	 What was Costco’s operating income for the fiscal year?
c.	 What was Costco’s average tax rate for the year?
d.	What were Costco’s diluted earnings per share in fiscal year 2015? What number of shares is 
this EPS based on?
	
13.	 See Table 2.5 showing financial statement data and stock price data for Mydeco Corp.
a.	 By what percentage did Mydeco’s revenues grow each year from 2013 to 2016?
b.	 By what percentage did net income grow each year?
c.	 Why might the growth rates of revenues and net income differ?
	
14.	 See Table 2.5 showing financial statement data and stock price data for Mydeco Corp. Suppose 
Mydeco repurchases 2.3 million shares each year from 2013 to 2016. What would its earnings

What effect would the acquisition have on Quisco’s EPS this year? (Note that acquisition 
expenses do not appear directly on the income statement. Assume the firm was acquired at 
the start of the year and has no revenues or expenses of its own, so that the only effect on 
EPS is due to the change in the number of shares outstanding.)

Financial Decision 
Making and the Law 
of One Price
IN MID-2007, MICrOSOFt DeCIDeD tO eNter a BIDDING War 
with competitors Google and Yahoo! for a stake in the fast-growing social networking 
site, Facebook. How did Microsoft’s managers decide that this was a good decision?
Every decision has future consequences that will affect the value of the firm. These 
consequences will generally include both benefits and costs. For example, after raising 
its offer, Microsoft ultimately succeeded in buying a 1.6% stake in Facebook, along with 
the right to place banner ads on the Facebook Web site, for $240 million. In addition 
to the upfront cost of $240 million, Microsoft also incurred ongoing costs associated 
with software development for the platform, network infrastructure, and international 
marketing efforts to attract advertisers. The benefits of the deal to Microsoft included 
the revenues associated with the advertising sales, together with the appreciation of 
its 1.6% stake in Facebook. In the end, Microsoft’s decision appeared to be a good 
one—in addition to advertising benefits, by the time of Facebook’s IPO in May 2012, 
the value of Microsoft’s 1.6% stake had grown to over $1 billion.
More generally, a decision is good for the firm’s investors if it increases the firm’s 
value by providing benefits whose value exceeds the costs. But comparing costs and 
benefits is often complicated because they occur at different points in time, may be in 
different currencies, or may have different risks associated with them. To make a valid 
comparison, we must use the tools of finance to express all costs and benefits in com-
mon terms. In this chapter, we introduce a central principle of finance, which we name 
the Valuation Principle, which states that we can use current market prices to determine 
the value today of the costs and benefits associated with a decision. This principle 
allows us to apply the concept of net present value (NPV) as a way to compare the costs 
and benefits of a project in terms of a common unit—namely, dollars today. We will then 
be able to evaluate a decision by answering this question: Does the cash value today of its

benefits exceed the cash value today of its costs? In addition, we will see that the NPV indicates the net 
amount by which the decision will increase wealth.
We then turn to financial markets and apply these same tools to determine the prices of securi-
ties that trade in the market. We discuss strategies called arbitrage, which allow us to exploit situations 
in which the prices of publicly available investment opportunities do not conform to these values. 
Because investors trade rapidly to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities, we argue that equivalent 
investment opportunities trading simultaneously in competitive markets must have the same price. 
This Law of One Price is the unifying theme of valuation that we use throughout this text.
	
3.1	 Valuing Decisions
A financial manager’s job is to make decisions on behalf of the firm’s investors. For 
example, when faced with an increase in demand for the firm’s products, a manager may 
need to decide whether to raise prices or increase production. If the decision is to raise 
production and a new facility is required, is it better to rent or purchase the facility? If 
the facility will be purchased, should the firm pay cash or borrow the funds needed to 
pay for it?
In this book, our objective is to explain how to make decisions that increase the value of 
the firm to its investors. In principle, the idea is simple and intuitive: For good decisions, 
the benefits exceed the costs. Of course, real-world opportunities are usually complex and 
so the costs and benefits are often difficult to quantify. The analysis will often involve skills 
from other management disciplines, as in these examples:
Marketing : to forecast the increase in revenues resulting from an advertising campaign
Accounting : to estimate the tax savings from a restructuring
Economics: to determine the increase in demand from lowering the price of a product
Organizational Behavior: to estimate the productivity gains from a change in manage-
ment structure
Strategy: to predict a competitor’s response to a price increase
Operations: to estimate the cost savings from a plant modernization
Once the analysis of these other disciplines has been completed to quantify the costs and 
benefits associated with a decision, the financial manager must compare the costs and ben-
efits and determine the best decision to make for the value of the firm.
Analyzing Costs and Benefits
The first step in decision making is to identify the costs and benefits of a decision. The 
next step is to quantify these costs and benefits. In order to compare the costs and benefits, 
we need to evaluate them in the same terms—cash today. Let’s make this concrete with a 
simple example.
Suppose a jewelry manufacturer has the opportunity to trade 400 ounces of silver for 
10 ounces of gold today. Because an ounce of gold differs in value from an ounce of silver, 
it is incorrect to compare 400 ounces to 10 ounces and conclude that the larger quantity is 

better. Instead, to compare the costs and benefits, we first need to quantify their values in 
equivalent terms.
Consider the silver. What is its cash value today? Suppose silver can be bought and sold 
for a current market price of $15 per ounce. Then the 400 ounces of silver we give up has 
a cash value of1
(400 ounces of silver today) * ($15/ounce of silver today) = $6000 today
If the current market price for gold is $900 per ounce, then the 10 ounces of gold we 
receive has a cash value of
(10 ounces of gold today) * ($900/ounce of gold today) = $9000 today
Now that we have quantified the costs and benefits in terms of a common measure 
of value, cash today, we can compare them. The jeweler’s opportunity has a benefit of 
$9000 today and a cost of $6000 today, so the net value of the decision is $9000 -
$6000 = $3000 today. By accepting the trade, the jewelry firm will be richer by $3000.
Using Market Prices to Determine Cash Values
In evaluating the jeweler’s decision, we used the current market price to convert from 
ounces of silver or gold to dollars. We did not concern ourselves with whether the jeweler 
thought that the price was fair or whether the jeweler would use the silver or gold. Do such 
considerations matter? Suppose, for example, that the jeweler does not need the gold, or 
thinks the current price of gold is too high. Would he value the gold at less than $9000? 
The answer is no—he can always sell the gold at the current market price and receive 
$9000 right now. Similarly, he would not value the gold at more than $9000, because even 
if he really needs the gold or thinks the current price of gold is too low, he can always buy 
10 ounces of gold for $9000. Thus, independent of his own views or preferences, the value 
of the gold to the jeweler is $9000.
This example illustrates an important general principle: Whenever a good trades in a 
competitive market—by which we mean a market in which it can be bought and sold at 
the same price—that price determines the cash value of the good. As long as a competi-
tive market exists, the value of the good will not depend on the views or preferences of the 
decision maker.
1You might worry about commissions or other transactions costs that are incurred when buying or selling 
gold, in addition to the market price. For now, we will ignore transactions costs, and discuss their effect in 
the appendix to this chapter.

Competitive Market Prices Determine Value
Problem
You have just won a radio contest and are disappointed to find out that the prize is four tickets to 
the Def Leppard reunion tour (face value $40 each). Not being a fan of 1980s power rock, you 
have no intention of going to the show. However, there is a second choice: two tickets to your 
favorite band’s sold-out show (face value $45 each). You notice that on eBay, tickets to the Def 
Leppard show are being bought and sold for $30 apiece and tickets to your favorite band’s show 
are being bought and sold at $50 each. Which prize should you choose?

Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
Thus, by evaluating cost and benefits using competitive market prices, we can deter-
mine whether a decision will make the firm and its investors wealthier. This point is one 
of the central and most powerful ideas in finance, which we call the Valuation Principle:
The value of an asset to the firm or its investors is determined by its competitive market 
price. The benefits and costs of a decision should be evaluated using these market prices, and 
when the value of the benefits exceeds the value of the costs, the decision will increase the 
market value of the firm.
The Valuation Principle provides the basis for decision making throughout this text. In 
the remainder of this chapter, we first apply it to decisions whose costs and benefits occur 
at different points in time and develop the main tool of project evaluation, the Net Present 
Value Rule. We then consider its consequences for the prices of assets in the market and 
develop the concept of the Law of One Price.
Solution
Competitive market prices, not your personal preferences (nor the face value of the tickets), are 
relevant here:
Four Def Leppard tickets at $30 apiece = $120 market value
Two of your favorite band’s tickets at $50 apiece = $100 market value
Instead of taking the tickets to your favorite band, you should accept the Def Leppard tickets, 
sell them on eBay, and use the proceeds to buy two tickets to your favorite band’s show. You’ll 
even have $20 left over to buy a T-shirt.
Example 3.2
Applying the Valuation Principle
Problem
You are the operations manager at your firm. Due to a pre-existing contract, you have the oppor-
tunity to acquire 200 barrels of oil and 3000 pounds of copper for a total of $12,000. The cur-
rent competitive market price of oil is $50 per barrel and for copper is $2 per pound. You are not 
sure you need all of the oil and copper, and are concerned that the value of both commodities 
may fall in the future. Should you take this opportunity?
Solution
To answer this question, you need to convert the costs and benefits to their cash values using 
market prices:
(200 barrels of oil) * ($50/barrel of oil today) = $10,000 today
(3000 pounds of copper) * ($2/pound of copper today) = $6000 today
The net value of the opportunity is $10,000 + $6000 - $12,000 = $4000 today. Because the 
net value is positive, you should take it. This value depends only on the current market prices for 
oil and copper. Even if you do not need all the oil or copper, or expect their values to fall, you can 
sell them at current market prices and obtain their value of $16,000. Thus, the opportunity is a 
good one for the firm, and will increase its value by $4000.

	
3.2	 Interest Rates and the Time Value of Money
For most financial decisions, unlike in the examples presented so far, costs and benefits 
occur at different points in time. For example, typical investment projects incur costs 
upfront and provide benefits in the future. In this section, we show how to account for this 
time difference when evaluating a project.
The Time Value of Money
Consider an investment opportunity with the following certain cash flows:
Cost:   $100,000 today
Benefit: $105,000 in one year
Because both are expressed in dollar terms, it might appear that the cost and benefit are 
directly comparable so that the project’s net value is $105,000 - $100,000 = $5000. But 
this calculation ignores the timing of the costs and benefits, and it treats money today as 
equivalent to money in one year.
In general, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in one year. If you have $1 today, 
you can invest it. For example, if you deposit it in a bank account paying 7% interest, you 
will have $1.07 at the end of one year. We call the difference in value between money today 
and money in the future the time value of money.
The Interest Rate: An Exchange Rate Across Time
By depositing money into a savings account, we can convert money today into money in 
the future with no risk. Similarly, by borrowing money from the bank, we can exchange 
money in the future for money today. The rate at which we can exchange money today 
for money in the future is determined by the current interest rate. In the same way that

Competitive market prices allow us to calculate the value 
of a decision without worrying about the tastes or opinions 
of the decision maker. When competitive prices are not 
available, we can no longer do this. Prices at retail stores, 
for example, are one sided: You can buy at the posted price, 
but you cannot sell the good to the store at that same price. 
We cannot use these one-sided prices to determine an exact 
cash value. They determine the maximum value of the good 
(since it can always be purchased at that price), but an indi-
vidual may value it for much less depending on his or her 
preferences for the good.
Let’s consider an example. It has long been common for 
banks to entice new depositors by offering free gifts for open-
ing a new account. In 2014, RBC offered a free iPad mini 
for individuals opening a new account. At the time, the 
retail price of that model iPad was $399. But because there 
is no competitive market to trade iPads, the value of the iPad 
depends on whether you were going to buy one or not.
If you planned to buy the iPad anyway, then the value to 
you is $399, the price you would otherwise pay for it. But 
if you did not want or need the iPad, the value of the offer 
would depend on the price you could get for the iPad. For 
example, if you could sell the iPad for $300 to your friend, 
then RBC’s offer is worth $300 to you. Thus, depending on 
your preferences, RBC’s offer is worth somewhere between 
$300 (you don’t want an iPad) and $399 (you definitely 
want one).

3.2  Interest Rates and the Time Value of Money

Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
an exchange rate allows us to convert money from one currency to another, the interest 
rate allows us to convert money from one point in time to another. In essence, an inter-
est rate is like an exchange rate across time. It tells us the market price today of money 
in the future.
Suppose the current annual interest rate is 7%. By investing or borrowing at this rate, we 
can exchange $1.07 in one year for each $1 today. More generally, we define the risk-free 
interest rate, rf, for a given period as the interest rate at which money can be borrowed or 
lent without risk over that period. We can exchange (1 + rf ) dollars in the future per dollar 
today, and vice versa, without risk. We refer to (1 + rf ) as the interest rate factor for risk-
free cash flows; it defines the exchange rate across time, and has units of “$ in one year/$ 
today.”
As with other market prices, the risk-free interest rate depends on supply and demand. 
In particular, at the risk-free interest rate the supply of savings equals the demand for bor-
rowing. After we know the risk-free interest rate, we can use it to evaluate other decisions in 
which costs and benefits are separated in time without knowing the investor’s preferences.
Value of Investment in One Year.  Let’s reevaluate the investment we considered earlier, 
this time taking into account the time value of money. If the interest rate is 7%, then we 
can express our costs as
 Cost = ($100,000 today) * (1.07 $ in one year/$ today)
 = $107,000 in one year
Think of this amount as the opportunity cost of spending $100,000 today: We give up the 
$107,000 we would have had in one year if we had left the money in the bank. Alterna-
tively, if we were to borrow the $100,000, we would owe $107,000 in one year.
Both costs and benefits are now in terms of “dollars in one year,” so we can compare 
them and compute the investment’s net value:
$105,000 - $107,000 = -$2000 in one year
In other words, we could earn $2000 more in one year by putting our $100,000 in the 
bank rather than making this investment. We should reject the investment: If we took it, 
we would be $2000 poorer in one year than if we didn’t.
Value of Investment Today.  The previous calculation expressed the value of the costs and 
benefits in terms of dollars in one year. Alternatively, we can use the interest rate factor to 
convert to dollars today. Consider the benefit of $105,000 in one year. What is the equiva-
lent amount in terms of dollars today? That is, how much would we need to have in the 
bank today so that we would end up with $105,000 in the bank in one year? We find this 
amount by dividing by the interest rate factor:
 Benefit = ($105,000 in one year) , (1.07 $ in one year/$ today)
 = $105,000 *
1
1.07 today
 = $98,130.84 today
This is also the amount the bank would lend to us today if we promised to repay 
$105,000 in one year.2 Thus, it is the competitive market price at which we can “buy” or 
“sell” $105,000 in one year.
2We are assuming the bank will both borrow and lend at the risk-free interest rate. We discuss the case 
when these rates differ in “Arbitrage with Transactions Costs” in the appendix to this chapter.

Now we are ready to compute the net value of the investment:
$98,130.84 - $100,000 = -$1869.16 today
Once again, the negative result indicates that we should reject the investment. Taking the 
investment would make us $1869.16 poorer today because we have given up $100,000 for 
something worth only $98,130.84.
Present Versus Future Value.  This calculation demonstrates that our decision is the same 
whether we express the value of the investment in terms of dollars in one year or dollars 
today: We should reject the investment. Indeed, if we convert from dollars today to dollars 
in one year,
(-$1869.16 today) * (1.07 $ in one year/$ today) = -$2000 in one year
we see that the two results are equivalent, but expressed as values at different points in 
time. When we express the value in terms of dollars today, we call it the present value 
(PV) of the investment. If we express it in terms of dollars in the future, we call it the 
future value (FV) of the investment.
Discount Factors and Rates.  When computing a present value as in the preceding calcu-
lation, we can interpret the term
1
1 + r =
1
1.07 = 0.93458 $ today/$ in one year
as the price today of $1 in one year. Note that the value is less than $1—money in the 
future is worth less today, and so its price reflects a discount. Because it provides the dis-
count at which we can purchase money in the future, the amount 
1
1 + r is called the one-
year discount factor. The risk-free interest rate is also referred to as the discount rate for 
a risk-free investment.
Example 3.3
Comparing Costs at Different Points in Time
Problem
The cost of rebuilding the San Francisco Bay Bridge to make it earthquake-safe was approxi-
mately $3 billion in 2004. At the time, engineers estimated that if the project were delayed to 
2005, the cost would rise by 10%. If the interest rate were 2%, what would be the cost of a delay 
in terms of dollars in 2004?
Solution
If the project were delayed, it would cost $3 billion * 1.10 = $3.3 billion in 2005. To ­compare 
this amount to the cost of $3 billion in 2004, we must convert it using the interest rate of 2%:
$3.3 billion in 2005 , ($1.02 in 2005/$ in 2004) = $3.235 billion in 2004
Therefore, the cost of a delay of one year was
$3.235 billion - $3 billion = $235 million in 2004
That is, delaying the project for one year was equivalent to giving up $235 million in cash.

3.3	 Present Value and the NPV Decision Rule
In Section 3.2, we converted between cash today and cash in the future using the risk-free 
interest rate. As long as we convert costs and benefits to the same point in time, we can 
compare them to make a decision. In practice, however, most corporations prefer to mea-
sure values in terms of their present value—that is, in terms of cash today. In this section 
we apply the Valuation Principle to derive the concept of the net present value, or NPV, and 
define the “golden rule” of financial decision making, the NPV Rule.
Net Present Value
When we compute the value of a cost or benefit in terms of cash today, we refer to it as 
the present value (PV). Similarly, we define the net present value (NPV) of a project or 
investment as the difference between the present value of its benefits and the present value 
of its costs:
Net Present Value
	
NPV = PV(Benefits) - PV(Costs)
(3.1)
If we use positive cash flows to represent benefits and negative cash flows to represent 
costs, and calculate the present value of multiple cash flows as the sum of present values for 
individual cash flows, we can also write this definition as
	
NPV = PV(All project cash flows)
(3.2)
That is, the NPV is the total of the present values of all project cash flows.

Concept Check	
1.	 How do you compare costs at different points in time?
	
2.	 If interest rates rise, what happens to the value today of a promise of money in one year?
We can use the risk-free interest rate to determine values in the same way we used 
competitive market prices. Figure 3.1 illustrates how we use competitive market prices, 
exchange rates, and interest rates to convert between dollars today and other goods, curren-
cies, or dollars in the future.

Let’s consider a simple example. Suppose your firm is offered the following investment 
opportunity: In exchange for $500 today, you will receive $550 in one year with certainty. 
If the risk-free interest rate is 8% per year then
 PV (Benefit) = ($550 in one year) , (1.08 $ in one year/$ today)
 = $509.26 today
This PV is the amount we would need to put in the bank today to generate $550 in one 
year ($509.26 * 1.08 = $550). In other words, the present value is the cash cost today of 
“doing it yourself ”—it is the amount you need to invest at the current interest rate to recreate 
the cash flow.
Once the costs and benefits are in present value terms, we can compute the investment’s 
NPV:
NPV = $509.26 - $500 = $9.26 today
But what if your firm doesn’t have the $500 needed to cover the initial cost of the 
project? Does the project still have the same value? Because we computed the value using 
competitive market prices, it should not depend on your tastes or the amount of cash 
your firm has in the bank. If your firm doesn’t have the $500, it could borrow $509.26 
from the bank at the 8% interest rate and then take the project. What are your cash flows 
in this case?
Today:              $509.26 (loan) - $500 (invested in the project) = $9.26
In one year: $550 (from project) - $509.26 * 1.08 (loan balance) = $0
This transaction leaves you with exactly $9.26 extra cash today and no future net obliga-
tions. So taking the project is like having an extra $9.26 in cash up front. Thus, the NPV 
expresses the value of an investment decision as an amount of cash received today. As long 
as the NPV is positive, the decision increases the value of the firm and is a good decision regard-
less of your current cash needs or preferences regarding when to spend the money.
The NPV Decision Rule
Because NPV is expressed in terms of cash today, it simplifies decision making. As long 
as we have correctly captured all of the costs and benefits of the project, decisions with a 
positive NPV will increase the wealth of the firm and its investors. We capture this logic in 
the NPV Decision Rule:
When making an investment decision, take the alternative with the highest NPV. 
­Choosing this alternative is equivalent to receiving its NPV in cash today.
Accepting or Rejecting a Project.  A common financial decision is whether to accept or 
reject a project. Because rejecting the project generally has NPV = 0 (there are no new 
costs or benefits from not doing the project), the NPV decision rule implies that we should
n	 Accept those projects with positive NPV because accepting them is equivalent to receiv-
ing their NPV in cash today, and
n	 Reject those projects with negative NPV; accepting them would reduce the wealth of 
investors, whereas not doing them has no cost (NPV = 0).
If the NPV is exactly zero, you will neither gain nor lose by accepting the project rather 
than rejecting it. It is not a bad project because it does not reduce firm value, but it does 
not increase value either.

Example 3.4 
The NPV Is Equivalent to Cash Today
Problem
Your firm needs to buy a new $9500 copier. As part of a promotion, the manufacturer has offered 
to let you pay $10,000 in one year, rather than pay cash today. Suppose the risk-free interest rate 
is 7% per year. Is this offer a good deal? Show that its NPV represents cash in your pocket.
Solution
If you take the offer, the benefit is that you won’t have to pay $9500 today, which is already in 
PV terms. The cost, however, is $10,000 in one year. We therefore convert the cost to a present 
value at the risk-free interest rate:
PV(Cost) = ($10,000 in one year) , (1.07 $ in one year/$ today) = $9345.79 today
The NPV of the promotional offer is the difference between the benefits and the costs:
NPV = $9500 - $9345.79 = $154.21 today
The NPV is positive, so the investment is a good deal. It is equivalent to getting a cash 
discount today of $154.21, and only paying $9345.79 today for the copier. To confirm our 
calculation, suppose you take the offer and invest $9345.79 in a bank paying 7% interest. With 
interest, this amount will grow to $9345.79 * 1.07 = $10,000 in one year, which you can use 
to pay for the copier.
Example 3.5
Choosing among Alternative Plans
Problem
Suppose you started a Web site hosting business and then decided to return to school. Now that 
you are back in school, you are considering selling the business within the next year. An investor 
has offered to buy the business for $200,000 whenever you are ready. If the interest rate is 10%, 
which of the following three alternatives is the best choice?
	
1.	 Sell the business now.
	
2.	 Scale back the business and continue running it while you are in school for one more year, 
and then sell the business (requiring you to spend $30,000 on expenses now, but generat-
ing $50,000 in profit at the end of the year).
	
3.	 Hire someone to manage the business while you are in school for one more year, and 
then sell the business (requiring you to spend $50,000 on expenses now, but generating 
$100,000 in profit at the end of the year).
Solution
The cash flows and NPVs for each alternative are calculated in Table 3.1. Faced with these three 
alternatives, the best choice is the one with highest NPV: Hire a manager and sell in one year. 
Choosing this alternative is equivalent to receiving $222,727 today.
Choosing among Alternatives.  We can also use the NPV decision rule to choose among 
projects. To do so, we must compute the NPV of each alternative, and then select the one 
with the highest NPV. This alternative is the one that will lead to the largest increase in the 
value of the firm.

NPV and Cash Needs
When we compare projects with different patterns of present and future cash flows, we 
may have preferences regarding when to receive the cash. Some may need cash today; 
­others may prefer to save for the future. In the Web site hosting business example, hiring 
a manager and selling in one year has the highest NPV. However, this option requires an 
initial outlay of $50,000, as opposed to selling the business and receiving $200,000 imme-
diately. Suppose you also need $60,000 in cash now to pay for school and other expenses. 
Would selling the business be a better choice in that case?
As was true for the jeweler considering trading silver for gold in Section 3.1, the answer is 
again no. As long as you can borrow and lend at the 10% interest rate, hiring a manager is the 
best choice whatever your preferences regarding the timing of the cash flows. To see why, 
­suppose you borrow $110,000 at the rate of 10% and hire the manager. Then you will owe 
$110,000 * 1.10 = $121,000 in one year, for total cash flows shown in Table 3.2. ­Compare 
these cash flows with those from selling now, and investing the excess $140,000 (which, at the 
rate of 10%, will grow to $140,000 * 1.10 = $154,000 in one year). Both strategies provide 
$60,000 in cash today, but the combination of hiring a manager and ­borrowing generates an 
additional $179,000 - $154,000 = $25,000 in one year.3 Thus, even if you need $60,000 
now, hiring the manager and selling in one year is still the best option.
3Note also that the present value of this additional cash flow, $25,000 , 1.10 = $22,727, is exactly the 
difference in NPVs between the two alternatives.

3.4	 Arbitrage and the Law of One Price
So far, we have emphasized the importance of using competitive market prices to compute 
the NPV. But is there always only one such price? What if the same good trades for dif­
ferent prices in different markets? Consider gold. Gold trades in many different markets, 
with the largest markets in New York and London. To value an ounce of gold we could 
look up the competitive price in either of these markets. But suppose gold is trading for 
$850 per ounce in New York and $900 per ounce in London. Which price should we use?
Fortunately, such situations do not arise, and it is easy to see why. Recall that these are 
competitive market prices at which you can both buy and sell. Thus, you can make money 
in this situation simply by buying gold for $850 per ounce in New York and then imme-
diately selling it for $900 per ounce in London.4 You will make $900 - $850 = $50 per 
ounce for each ounce you buy and sell. Trading 1 million ounces at these prices, you 
would make $50 million with no risk or investment! This is a case where that old adage, 
“Buy low, sell high,” can be followed perfectly.
Of course, you will not be the only one making these trades. Everyone who sees these 
prices will want to trade as many ounces as possible. Within seconds, the market in 
New York would be flooded with buy orders, and the market in London would be flooded 
with sell orders. Although a few ounces (traded by the lucky individuals who spotted this 
opportunity first) might be exchanged at these prices, the price of gold in New York would 
quickly rise in response to all the orders, and the price in London would rapidly fall.5 Prices 
would continue to change until they were equalized somewhere in the middle, such as 
$875 per ounce.
Arbitrage
The practice of buying and selling equivalent goods in different markets to take ­advantage 
of a price difference is known as arbitrage. More generally, we refer to any situation in 
which it is possible to make a profit without taking any risk or making any investment as 
an arbitrage opportunity. Because an arbitrage opportunity has a positive NPV, whenever 
an arbitrage opportunity appears in financial markets, investors will race to take ­advantage 
4There is no need to transport the gold from New York to London because investors in these markets trade 
ownership rights to gold that is stored securely elsewhere. For now, we ignore any further transactions 
costs, but discuss their effect in the appendix to this chapter.
5As economists would say, supply would not equal demand in these markets. In New York, demand would 
be infinite because everyone would want to buy. For equilibrium to be restored so that supply equals 
demand, the price in New York would have to rise. Similarly, in London there would be infinite supply 
until the price there fell.

of it. Those investors who spot the opportunity first and who can trade quickly will have 
the ability to exploit it. Once they place their trades, prices will respond, causing the arbi-
trage opportunity to evaporate.
Arbitrage opportunities are like money lying in the street; once spotted, they will quickly 
disappear. Thus the normal state of affairs in markets should be that no arbitrage opportu-
nities exist. We call a competitive market in which there are no arbitrage opportunities a 
normal market.6
Law of One Price
In a normal market, the price of gold at any point in time will be the same in London 
and New York. The same logic applies more generally whenever equivalent investment 
opportunities trade in two different competitive markets. If the prices in the two markets 
differ, investors will profit immediately by buying in the market where it is cheap and 
selling in the market where it is expensive. In doing so, they will equalize the prices. As a 
result, prices will not differ (at least not for long). This important property is the Law of 
One Price:
If equivalent investment opportunities trade simultaneously in different competitive 
­markets, then they must trade for the same price in all markets.
One useful consequence of the Law of One Price is that when evaluating costs and ben-
efits to compute a net present value, we can use any competitive price to determine a cash 
value, without checking the price in all possible markets.
6The term efficient market is also sometimes used to describe a market that, along with other properties, 
is without arbitrage opportunities. We avoid that term here because it is stronger than we require, as it 
also restricts the information held by market participants. We discuss notions of market efficiency in 
Chapter 9.

3.5  No-Arbitrage and Security Prices	
105
	
3.5	 No-Arbitrage and Security Prices
An investment opportunity that trades in a financial market is known as a financial 
­security (or, more simply, a security). The notions of arbitrage and the Law of One Price 
have important implications for security prices. We begin exploring its implications for 
the prices of individual securities as well as market interest rates. We then broaden our 
perspective to value a package of securities. Along the way, we will develop some important 
insights about firm decision making and firm value that will underpin our study through-
out this textbook.
Valuing a Security with the Law of One Price
The Law of One Price tells us that the prices of equivalent investment opportunities should 
be the same. We can use this idea to value a security if we can find another equivalent 
investment whose price is already known. Consider a simple security that promises a one-
time payment to its owner of $1000 in one year’s time. Suppose there is no risk that the 

106	
Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
payment will not be made. One example of this type of security is a bond, a security sold 
by governments and corporations to raise money from investors today in exchange for the 
promised future payment. If the risk-free interest rate is 5%, what can we conclude about 
the price of this bond in a normal market?
To answer this question, consider an alternative investment that would generate the 
same cash flow as this bond. Suppose we invest money at the bank at the risk-free interest 
rate. How much do we need to invest today to receive $1000 in one year? As we saw in 
Section 3.3, the cost today of recreating a future cash flow on our own is its present value:
 PV ($1000 in one year) = ($1000 in one year) , (1.05 $ in one year/$ today)
 = $952.38 today
If we invest $952.38 today at the 5% risk-free interest rate, we will have $1000 in one 
year’s time with no risk.
We now have two ways to receive the same cash flow: (1) buy the bond or (2) invest 
$952.38 at the 5% risk-free interest rate. Because these transactions produce equivalent 
cash flows, the Law of One Price implies that, in a normal market, they must have the same 
price (or cost). Therefore,
Price (Bond) = $952.38
Identifying Arbitrage Opportunities with Securities.  Recall that the Law of One Price 
is based on the possibility of arbitrage: If the bond had a different price, there would be 
an arbitrage opportunity. For example, suppose the bond traded for a price of $940. How 
could we profit in this situation?
In this case, we can buy the bond for $940 and at the same time borrow $952.38 from 
the bank. Given the 5% interest rate, we will owe the bank $952.38 * 1.05 = $1000 in 
one year. Our overall cash flows from this pair of transactions are as shown in Table 3.3. 
Using this strategy we can earn $12.38 in cash today for each bond that we buy, without 
taking any risk or paying any of our own money in the future. Of course, as we—and 
others who see the opportunity—start buying the bond, its price will quickly rise until it 
reaches $952.38 and the arbitrage opportunity disappears.
A similar arbitrage opportunity arises if the bond price is higher than $952.38. For 
example, suppose the bond is trading for $960. In that case, we should sell the bond and 
invest $952.38 at the bank. As shown in Table 3.4, we then earn $7.62 in cash today, yet 
keep our future cash flows unchanged by replacing the $1000 we would have received from 
the bond with the $1000 we will receive from the bank. Once again, as people begin sell-
ing the bond to exploit this opportunity, the price will fall until it reaches $952.38 and the 
arbitrage opportunity disappears.

Net Cash Flows from Buying the Bond

When the bond is overpriced, the arbitrage strategy involves selling the bond and invest-
ing some of the proceeds. But if the strategy involves selling the bond, does this mean that 
only the current owners of the bond can exploit it? The answer is no; in financial markets 
it is possible to sell a security you do not own by doing a short sale. In a short sale, the 
person who intends to sell the security first borrows it from someone who already owns it. 
Later, that person must either return the security by buying it back or pay the owner the 
cash flows he or she would have received. For example, we could short sell the bond in the 
example effectively promising to repay the current owner $1000 in one year. By executing 
a short sale, it is possible to exploit the arbitrage opportunity when the bond is overpriced 
even if you do not own it.

Example 3.6 
Computing the No-Arbitrage Price
Problem
Consider a security that pays its owner $100 today and $100 in one year, without any risk. Sup-
pose the risk-free interest rate is 10%. What is the no-arbitrage price of the security today (before 
the first $100 is paid)? If the security is trading for $195, what arbitrage opportunity is available?
Solution
We need to compute the present value of the security’s cash flows. In this case there are two cash 
flows: $100 today, which is already in present value terms, and $100 in one year. The present 
value of the second cash flow is
$100 in one year , (1.10 $ in one year/$ today) = $90.91 today
Therefore, the total present value of the cash flows is $100 + $90.91 = $190.91 today, which is 
the no-arbitrage price of the security.
If the security is trading for $195, we can exploit its overpricing by selling it for $195. We can 
then use $100 of the sale proceeds to replace the $100 we would have received from the security 
today and invest $90.91 of the sale proceeds at 10% to replace the $100 we would have received 
in one year. The remaining $195 - $100 - $90.91 = $4.09 is an arbitrage profit.
Determining the No-Arbitrage Price.  We have shown that at any price other than 
$952.38, an arbitrage opportunity exists for our bond. Thus, in a normal market, the price 
of this bond must be $952.38. We call this price the no-arbitrage price for the bond.

108	
Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
By applying the reasoning for pricing the simple bond, we can outline a general process 
for pricing other securities:
	
1.	 Identify the cash flows that will be paid by the security.
	
2.	 Determine the “do-it-yourself ” cost of replicating those cash flows on our own; 
that is, the present value of the security’s cash flows.
Unless the price of the security equals this present value, there is an arbitrage opportunity. 
Thus, the general formula is
No-Arbitrage Price of a Security
	
Price(Security) = PV(All cash flows paid by the security)
(3.3)
Determining the Interest Rate from Bond Prices.  Given the risk-free interest rate, the 
no-arbitrage price of a risk-free bond is determined by Eq. 3.3. The reverse is also true: If 
we know the price of a risk-free bond, we can use Eq. 3.3 to determine what the risk-free 
interest rate must be if there are no arbitrage opportunities.
For example, suppose a risk-free bond that pays $1000 in one year is currently trading 
with a competitive market price of $929.80 today. From Eq. 3.3, we know that the bond’s 
price equals the present value of the $1000 cash flow it will pay:
$929.80 today = ($1000 in one year) , (1 + rf )
We can rearrange this equation to determine the risk-free interest rate:
1 + rf = $1000 in one year
$929.80 today
= 1.0755 $ in one year/$ today
That is, if there are no arbitrage opportunities, the risk-free interest rate must be 7.55%.
Interest rates are calculated by this method in practice. Financial news services report 
current interest rates by deriving these rates based on the current prices of risk-free govern-
ment bonds trading in the market.
Note that the risk-free interest rate equals the percentage gain that you earn from invest-
ing in the bond, which is called the bond’s return:
	
 Return = Gain at End of Year
Initial Cost
	
 = 1000 - 929.80
929.80
= 1000
929.80 - 1 = 7.55%
(3.4)
Thus, if there is no arbitrage, the risk-free interest rate is equal to the return from invest-
ing in a risk-free bond. If the bond offered a higher return than the risk-free interest rate, 
then investors would earn a profit by borrowing at the risk-free interest rate and invest-
ing in the bond. If the bond had a lower return than the risk-free interest rate, investors 
would sell the bond and invest the proceeds at the risk-free interest rate. No arbitrage is 
therefore equivalent to the idea that all risk-free investments should offer investors the same 
return.

The NPV of Trading Securities and Firm Decision Making
We have established that positive-NPV decisions increase the wealth of the firm and its 
investors. Think of buying a security as an investment decision. The cost of the decision is 
the price we pay for the security, and the benefit is the cash flows that we will receive from 
owning the security. When securities trade at no-arbitrage prices, what can we conclude 
about the value of trading them? From Eq. 3.3, the cost and benefit are equal in a normal 
market and so the NPV of buying a security is zero:
 NPV (Buy security) = PV (All cash flows paid by the security) - Price (Security)
 = 0
Similarly, if we sell a security, the price we receive is the benefit and the cost is the cash 
flows we give up. Again the NPV is zero:
 NPV (Sell security) = Price (Security) - PV (All cash flows paid by the security)
 = 0
Thus, the NPV of trading a security in a normal market is zero. This result is not sur-
prising. If the NPV of buying a security were positive, then buying the security would 
be equivalent to receiving cash today—that is, it would present an arbitrage opportunity. 
Because arbitrage opportunities do not exist in normal markets, the NPV of all security 
trades must be zero.
Another way to understand this result is to remember that every trade has both a buyer 
and a seller. In a competitive market, if a trade offers a positive NPV to one party, it must 
give a negative NPV to the other party. But then one of the two parties would not agree to 
the trade. Because all trades are voluntary, they must occur at prices at which neither party 
is losing value, and therefore for which the trade is zero NPV.
The insight that security trading in a normal market is a zero-NPV transaction is a critical 
building block in our study of corporate finance. Trading securities in a normal market neither 
creates nor destroys value: Instead, value is created by the real investment projects in which the 
firm engages, such as developing new products, opening new stores, or creating more efficient 
production methods. Financial transactions are not sources of value but instead serve to adjust 
the timing and risk of the cash flows to best suit the needs of the firm or its investors.

An Old Joke
There is an old joke that many finance professors enjoy 
­telling their students. It goes like this:
A finance professor and a student are walking down a street. 
The student notices a $100 bill lying on the pavement and 
leans down to pick it up. The finance professor immediately 
intervenes and says, “Don’t bother; there is no free lunch. 
If that were a real $100 bill lying there, somebody would 
already have picked it up!”
This joke invariably generates much laughter because it 
makes fun of the principle of no arbitrage in competitive 
markets. But once the laughter dies down, the professor 
then asks whether anyone has ever actually found a real $100 
bill lying on the pavement. The ensuing silence is the real 
lesson behind the joke.
This joke sums up the point of focusing on markets in 
which no arbitrage opportunities exist. Free $100 bills lying on 
the pavement, like arbitrage opportunities, are extremely rare for 
two reasons: (1) Because $100 is a large amount of money, peo-
ple are especially careful not to lose it, and (2) in the rare event 
when someone does inadvertently drop $100, the likelihood of 
your finding it before someone else does is extremely small.

110	
Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
An important consequence of this result is the idea that we can evaluate a decision by 
focusing on its real components, rather than its financial ones. That is, we can separate 
the firm’s investment decision from its financing choice. We refer to this concept as the 
Separation Principle:
Security transactions in a normal market neither create nor destroy value on their own. 
Therefore, we can evaluate the NPV of an investment decision separately from the 
­decision the firm makes regarding how to finance the investment or any other security 
transactions the firm is considering.
Example 3.7 
Separating Investment and Financing
Problem
Your firm is considering a project that will require an upfront investment of $10 million today 
and will produce $12 million in cash flow for the firm in one year without risk. Rather than 
pay for the $10 million investment entirely using its own cash, the firm is considering raising 
additional funds by issuing a security that will pay investors $5.5 million in one year. Suppose 
the risk-free interest rate is 10%. Is pursuing this project a good decision without issuing the new 
security? Is it a good decision with the new security?
Solution
Without the new security, the cost of the project is $10 million today and the benefit is $12 mil-
lion in one year. Converting the benefit to a present value
$12 million in one year , (1.10 $ in one year/$ today) = $10.91 million today
we see that the project has an NPV of $10.91 million - $10 million = $0.91 million today.
Now suppose the firm issues the new security. In a normal market, the price of this security 
will be the present value of its future cash flow:
Price(Security) = $5.5 million , 1.10 = $5 million today
Thus, after it raises $5 million by issuing the new security, the firm will only need to invest an 
additional $5 million to take the project.
To compute the project’s NPV in this case, note that in one year the firm will receive the $12 
million payout of the project, but owe $5.5 million to the investors in the new security, leaving 
$6.5 million for the firm. This amount has a present value of
$6.5 million in one year , (1.10 $ in one year/$ today) = $5.91 million today
Thus, the project has an NPV of $5.91 million - $5 million = $0.91 million today, as before.
In either case, we get the same result for the NPV. The separation principle indicates that we 
will get the same result for any choice of financing for the firm that occurs in a normal market. 
We can therefore evaluate the project without explicitly considering the different financing pos-
sibilities the firm might choose.
Valuing a Portfolio
So far, we have discussed the no-arbitrage price for individual securities. The Law of One 
Price also has implications for packages of securities. Consider two securities, A and B. 
Suppose a third security, C, has the same cash flows as A and B combined. In this case, 
security C is equivalent to a combination of the securities A and B. We use the term 
portfolio to describe a collection of securities. What can we conclude about the price of 
security C as compared to the prices of A and B?

value these securities. In addition, given that the value of the 
banks holding these securities was based on the sum of all 
projects and investments within them, investors could not 
value the banks either. Investors reacted to this uncertainty 
by selling both the mortgage-backed securities and securities 
of banks that held mortgage-backed securities. These actions 
further compounded the problem by driving down prices to 
seemingly unrealistically low levels and thereby threatening 
the solvency of the entire financial system.
The loss of information precipitated by the loss of liquid-
ity played a key role in the breakdown of credit markets. As 
both investors and government regulators found it increas-
ingly difficult to assess the solvency of the banks, banks 
found it difficult to raise new funds on their own and also 
shied away from lending to other banks because of their 
concerns about the financial viability of their competitors. 
The result was a breakdown in lending. Ultimately, the gov-
ernment was forced to step in and spend hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in order to (1) provide new capital to support 
the banks and (2) provide liquidity by creating a market for 
the now “toxic” mortgage-backed securities.
In the first half of 2008, as the extent and severity of the 
decline in the housing market became apparent, investors 
became increasingly worried about the value of securities 
that were backed by residential home mortgages. As a result, 
the volume of trade in the multi-trillion dollar market for 
mortgage-backed securities plummeted over 80% by August 
2008. Over the next two months, trading in many of these 
securities ceased altogether, making the markets for these 
securities increasingly illiquid.
Competitive markets depend upon liquidity—there 
must be sufficient buyers and sellers of a security so that it 
is possible to trade at any time at the current market price. 
When markets become illiquid it may not be possible to 
trade at the posted price. As a consequence, we can no lon-
ger rely on market prices as a measure of value.
The collapse of the mortgage-backed securities market 
created two problems. First was the loss of trading oppor-
tunities, making it difficult for holders of these securities 
to sell them. But a potentially more significant problem 
was the loss of information. Without a liquid, competitive 
market for these securities, it became impossible to reliably 
Global Financial Crisis
Liquidity and the Informational Role of Prices
Value Additivity.  Because security C is equivalent to the portfolio of A and B, by the Law 
of One Price, they must have the same price. This idea leads to the relationship known as 
value additivity; that is, the price of C must equal the price of the portfolio, which is the 
combined price of A and B:
Value Additivity
	
Price(C) = Price(A + B) = Price(A) + Price(B)
(3.5)
Because security C has cash flows equal to the sum of A and B, its value or price must be 
the sum of the values of A and B. Otherwise, an obvious arbitrage opportunity would exist. 
For example, if the total price of A and B were lower than the price of C, then we could 
make a profit buying A and B and selling C. This arbitrage activity would quickly push 
prices until the price of security C equals the total price of A and B.
Example 3.8 
Valuing an Asset in a Portfolio
Problem
Holbrook Holdings is a publicly traded company with only two assets: It owns 60% of Harry’s 
Hotcakes restaurant chain and an ice hockey team. Suppose the market value of Holbrook Hold-
ings is $160 million, and the market value of the entire Harry’s Hotcakes chain (which is also 
publicly traded) is $120 million. What is the market value of the hockey team?
Solution
We can think of Holbrook as a portfolio consisting of a 60% stake in Harry’s Hotcakes and the 
hockey team. By value additivity, the sum of the value of the stake in Harry’s Hotcakes and the 
hockey team must equal the $160 million market value of Holbrook. Because the 60% stake in 
Harry’s Hotcakes is worth 60% * $120 million = $72 million, the hockey team has a value of 
$160 million - $72 million = $88 million.

Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
Arbitrage in Markets
Value additively is the principle behind a type of trading 
activity known as stock index arbitrage. Common stock 
indices (such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the 
Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P 500)) represent portfolios of 
individual stocks. It is possible to trade the individual stocks 
that comprise an index on the New York Stock Exchange 
and NASDAQ. It is also possible to trade the entire index 
(as a single security) on the futures exchanges in Chicago, 
or as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the NYSE. When 
the price of the index security is below the total price of the 
individual stocks, traders buy the index and sell the stocks 
to capture the price difference. Similarly, when the price of 
the index security is above the total price of the individual 
stocks, traders sell the index and buy the individual stocks. 
It is not uncommon for 20% to 30% of the daily volume of 
trade on the NYSE to be due to index arbitrage activity via 
program trading.*
The traders that engage in stock index arbitrage automate 
the process by tracking prices and submitting (or cancelling) 
orders electronically. Over the years the competition to take 
advantage of these opportunities has caused traders to go to 
extraordinary lengths to reduce order execution time. One 
limiting factor is the time it takes to send an order from one 
exchange to another. For example, in 2010 Spread Networks 
paid $300 million for a new fiber optic line that reduced 
the communication time between New York and Chicago 
from 16 milliseconds to 13 milliseconds. Three millisec-
onds might not sound like a lot (it takes 400 milliseconds 
to blink), but it meant that Spread would be able to exploit 
mispricings that occurred between the NYSE and the Chi-
cago futures exchange before any of its competitors, at least 
until one of its competitors constructed a faster line.
The evolution of how traders took advantage of these 
short-lived arbitrage opportunities provides a nice illustration 
of how competitive market forces act to remove profit-making 
opportunities. In a recent study, Professors Eric Budish, Peter 
Crampton, and John Shim** focused on the evolution of 
one particular arbitrage opportunity that resulted from dif-
ferences in the price of the S&P 500 Futures Contract on 
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the price of the SPDR 
S&P 500 ETF traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
The left figure shows how the duration of arbitrage 
opportunities changed between 2005 and 2011. Each line 
shows, for the indicated year, the fraction of arbitrage oppor-
tunities that lasted longer than the amount of time indicated 
on the horizontal axis. So, for example, in 2005 about half 
of the arbitrage opportunities that existed lasted more than 
100 milliseconds. By 2008, this number had dropped to 20 
milliseconds, and by 2011, the number was under 10 mil-
liseconds. Note also that in 2005 almost all opportunities 
lasted at least 20 milliseconds, but by 2011 the number of 
opportunities that lasted this long was less than 10% and 
hardly any persisted for more than 100 milliseconds.
What happened to the profits from exploiting these 
mispricings? You might have expected that the effect of this 
competition would be to decrease profits, but as the right 
figure shows, profits per opportunity remained relatively 
constant. Furthermore, the number of opportunities did 
not systematically decline over this period, implying that the 
aggregate profits from exploiting arbitrage opportunities did 
not diminish. In that sense, the competition between arbi-
trageurs has not reduced the magnitude or frequency of price 
deviations across these markets, but instead has reduced the 
amount of time that these deviations can persist.

Concept Check	
1.	 If a firm makes an investment that has a positive NPV, how does the value of the firm change?
	
2.	 What is the separation principle?
	
3.	 In addition to trading opportunities, what else do liquid markets provide?
More generally, value additivity implies that the value of a portfolio is equal to the sum 
of the values of its parts. That is, the “à la carte” price and the package price must 
coincide.7
Value Additivity and Firm Value.  Value additivity has an important consequence for the 
value of an entire firm. The cash flows of the firm are equal to the total cash flows of all 
projects and investments within the firm. Therefore, by value additivity, the price or value 
of the entire firm is equal to the sum of the values of all projects and investments within it. 
In other words, our NPV decision rule coincides with maximizing the value of the entire 
firm:
To maximize the value of the entire firm, managers should make decisions that maximize 
NPV. The NPV of the decision represents its contribution to the overall value of the firm.
Where Do We Go from Here?
The key concepts we have developed in this chapter—the Valuation Principle, Net Present 
Value, and the Law of One Price—provide the foundation for financial decision mak-
ing. The Law of One Price allows us to determine the value of stocks, bonds, and other 
­securities, based on their cash flows, and validates the optimality of the NPV decision rule 
in identifying projects and investments that create value. In the remainder of the text, we 
will build on this foundation and explore the details of applying these principles in practice.
For simplicity, we have focused in this chapter on projects that were not risky, and thus 
had known costs and benefits. The same fundamental tools of the Valuation Principle and 
the Law of One Price can be applied to analyze risky investments as well, and we will look 
in detail at methods to assess and value risk in Part 4 of the text. Those seeking some early 
insights and key foundations for this topic, however, are strongly encouraged to read the 
appendix to this chapter. There we introduce the idea that investors are risk averse, and 
then use the principle of no-arbitrage developed in this chapter to demonstrate two funda-
mental insights regarding the impact of risk on valuation:
	
1.	 When cash flows are risky, we must discount them at a rate equal to the risk-free 
interest rate plus an appropriate risk premium; and,
	
2.	 The appropriate risk premium will be higher the more the project’s returns tend to 
vary with the overall risk in the economy.
Finally, the chapter appendix also addresses the important practical issue of transactions 
costs. There we show that when purchase and sale prices, or borrowing and lending rates 
differ, the Law of One Price will continue to hold, but only up to the level of transactions 
costs.
7This feature of financial markets does not hold in many other noncompetitive markets. For example, a 
round-trip airline ticket often costs much less than two separate one-way tickets. Of course, airline tickets 
are not sold in a competitive market—you cannot buy and sell the tickets at the listed prices. Only airlines 
can sell tickets, and they have strict rules against reselling tickets. Otherwise, you could make money buy-
ing round-trip tickets and selling them to people who need one-way tickets.

Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
3.1  Valuing Decisions
	
n	 To evaluate a decision, we must value the incremental costs and benefits associated with that 
decision. A good decision is one for which the value of the benefits exceeds the value of the 
costs.
	
n	 To compare costs and benefits that occur at different points in time, in different currencies, or 
with different risks, we must put all costs and benefits in common terms. Typically, we convert 
costs and benefits into cash today.
	
n	 A competitive market is one in which a good can be bought and sold at the same price. We use 
prices from competitive markets to determine the cash value of a good.
3.2  Interest Rates and the Time Value of Money
	
n	 The time value of money is the difference in value between money today and money in the 
future. The rate at which we can exchange money today for money in the future by borrowing 
or investing is the current market interest rate. The risk-free interest rate, rf , is the rate at which 
money can be borrowed or lent without risk.
3.3  Present Value and the NPV Decision Rule
	
n	 The present value (PV) of a cash flow is its value in terms of cash today.
	
n	 The net present value (NPV) of a project is
	
PV(Benefits) - PV(Costs)
(3.1)
	
n	 A good project is one with a positive net present value. The NPV Decision Rule states that 
when choosing from among a set of alternatives, choose the one with the highest NPV. The 
NPV of a project is equivalent to the cash value today of the project.
	
n	 Regardless of our preferences for cash today versus cash in the future, we should always first 
maximize NPV. We can then borrow or lend to shift cash flows through time and to find our 
most preferred pattern of cash flows.
3.4  Arbitrage and the Law of One Price
	
n	 Arbitrage is the process of trading to take advantage of equivalent goods that have different 
prices in different competitive markets.
	
n	 A normal market is a competitive market with no arbitrage opportunities.
	
n	 The Law of One Price states that if equivalent goods or securities trade simultaneously in differ-
ent competitive markets, they will trade for the same price in each market. This law is equiva-
lent to saying that no arbitrage opportunities should exist.
3.5  No-Arbitrage and Security Prices
	
n	 The No-Arbitrage Price of a Security is
	
	
PV (All cash flows paid by the security)
(3.3)
	
n	 No-arbitrage implies that all risk-free investments should offer the same return.
	
n	 The Separation Principle states that security transactions in a normal market neither create nor 
destroy value on their own. As a consequence, we can evaluate the NPV of an investment deci-
sion separately from the security transactions the firm is considering.
	
n	 To maximize the value of the entire firm, managers should make decisions that maximize the 
NPV. The NPV of the decision represents its contribution to the overall value of the firm.
	
n	 Value additivity implies that the value of a portfolio is equal to the sum of the values of its parts.

Thus far we have considered only cash flows that have no risk. But in many settings, cash flows 
are risky. In this section, we examine how to determine the present value of a risky cash flow.
Risky Versus Risk-Free Cash Flows
Suppose the risk-free interest rate is 4% and that over the next year the economy is equally 
likely to strengthen or weaken. Consider an investment in a risk-free bond, and one in the 
stock market index (a portfolio of all the stocks in the market). The risk-free bond has no 
risk and will pay $1100 whatever the state of the economy. The cash flow from an invest-
ment in the market index, however, depends on the strength of the economy. Let’s assume 
that the market index will be worth $1400 if the economy is strong but only $800 if the 
economy is weak. Table 3A.1 summarizes these payoffs.
In Section 3.5, we saw that the no-arbitrage price of a security is equal to the present 
value of its cash flows. For example, the price of the risk-free bond corresponds to the 4% 
risk-free interest rate:
 Price (Risk@free Bond) = PV (Cash Flows)
 = ($1100 in one year) , (1.04 $ in one year/$ today)
 = $1058 today
Now consider the market index. An investor who buys it today can sell it in one year for a 
cash flow of either $800 or $1400, with an average payoff of 1
2 ($800) + 1
2 ($1400) = $1100. 
Although this average payoff is the same as the risk-free bond, the market index has a lower 
price today. It pays $1100 on average, but its actual cash flow is risky, so investors are only 
willing to pay $1000 for it today rather than $1058. What accounts for this lower price?
Risk Aversion and the Risk Premium
Intuitively, investors pay less to receive $1100 on average than to receive $1100 with cer-
tainty because they don’t like risk. In particular, it seems likely that for most individuals, 
the personal cost of losing a dollar in bad times is greater than the benefit of an extra dollar in 
good times. Thus, the benefit from receiving an extra $300 ($1400 versus $1100) when 
the economy is strong is less important than the loss of $300 ($800 versus $1100) when the 
economy is weak. As a result, investors prefer to receive $1100 with certainty.
The notion that investors prefer to have a safe income rather than a risky one of the 
same average amount is called risk aversion. It is an aspect of an investor’s preferences, 
and different investors may have different degrees of risk aversion. The more risk averse

Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
investors are, the lower the current price of the market index will be compared to a risk-free 
bond with the same average payoff.
Because investors care about risk, we cannot use the risk-free interest rate to compute 
the present value of a risky future cash flow. When investing in a risky project, investors 
will expect a return that appropriately compensates them for the risk. For example, inves-
tors who buy the market index for its current price of $1000 receive $1100 on average 
at the end of the year, which is an average gain of $100, or a 10% return on their initial 
investment. When we compute the return of a security based on the payoff we expect to 
receive on average, we call it the expected return:
	
Expected return of a risky investment =
Expected gain at end of year
Initial cost

(3A.1)
Of course, although the expected return of the market index is 10%, its actual return 
will be higher or lower. If the economy is strong, the market index will rise to 1400, which 
represents a return of
Market return if economy is strong = (1400 - 1000)/1000 = 40%
If the economy is weak, the index will drop to 800, for a return of
Market return if economy is weak = (800 - 1000)/1000 = -20%
We can also calculate the 10% expected return by computing the average of these actual 
returns:
1
2 (40%) + 1
2 (-20%) = 10%
Thus, investors in the market index earn an expected return of 10% rather than the risk-
free interest rate of 4% on their investment. The difference of 6% between these returns 
is called the market index’s risk premium. The risk premium of a security represents the 
additional return that investors expect to earn to compensate them for the security’s risk. 
Because investors are risk averse, the price of a risky security cannot be calculated by simply 
discounting its expected cash flow at the risk-free interest rate. Rather,
When a cash flow is risky, to compute its present value we must discount the cash flow we 
expect on average at a rate that equals the risk-free interest rate plus an appropriate risk 
premium.
The No-Arbitrage Price of a Risky Security
The risk premium of the market index is determined by investors’ preferences toward risk. 
And in the same way we used the risk-free interest rate to determine the no-arbitrage price 
of other risk-free securities, we can use the risk premium of the market index to value other 
risky securities. For example, suppose some security “A” will pay investors $600 if the 
economy is strong and nothing if it is weak. Let’s see how we can determine the market 
price of security A using the Law of One Price.
As shown in Table 3A.2, if we combine security A with a risk-free bond that pays $800 
in one year, the cash flows of the portfolio in one year are identical to the cash flows of the 
market index. By the Law of One Price, the total market value of the bond and security A 
must equal $1000, the value of the market index. Given a risk-free interest rate of 4%, the 
market price of the bond is
($800 in one year) , (1.04 $ in one year/$ today) = $769 today

Therefore, the initial market price of security A is $1000 - $769 = $231. If the price of 
security A were higher or lower than $231, then the value of the portfolio of the bond and 
security A would differ from the value of the market index, violating the Law of One Price 
and creating an arbitrage opportunity.
Risk Premiums Depend on Risk
Given an initial price of $231 and an expected payoff of 1
2 (0) + 1
2 (600) = 300, security A 
has an expected return of
Expected return of security A = 300 - 231
231
= 30%
Note that this expected return exceeds the 10% expected return of the market portfolio. 
Investors in security A earn a risk premium of 30% - 4% = 26% over the risk-free interest 
rate, compared to a 6% risk premium for the market portfolio. Why are the risk premiums 
so different?
The reason for the difference becomes clear if we compare the actual returns for the two 
securities. When the economy is weak, investors in security A lose everything, for a return of 
-100%, and when the economy is strong, they earn a return of (600 - 231)/231 = 160%. 
In contrast, the market index loses 20% in a weak economy and gains 40% in a strong econ-
omy. Given its much more variable returns, it is not surprising that security A must pay inves-
tors a higher risk premium.
Risk Is Relative to the Overall Market
The example of security A suggests that the risk premium of a security will depend on how 
variable its returns are. But before drawing any conclusions, it is worth considering one 
further example.

Suppose security B pays $600 if the economy is weak and $0 if the economy is strong. What are

Solution
If we combine the market index and security B together in a portfolio, we earn the same payoff as 
a risk-free bond that pays $1400, as shown in the following table (cash flows in $).
	
Chapter 3  Appendix:  The Price of Risk

Chapter 3  Financial Decision Making and the Law of One Price
The results for security B are quite striking. Looking at securities A and B in isolation, 
they seem very similar—both are equally likely to pay $600 or $0. Yet security A has a 
much lower market price than security B ($231 versus $346). In terms of returns, security 
A pays investors an expected return of 30%; security B pays -13.3%. Why are their prices 
and expected returns so different? And why would risk-averse investors be willing to buy a 
risky security with an expected return below the risk-free interest rate?
To understand this result, note that security A pays $600 when the economy is strong, 
and B pays $600 when the economy is weak. Recall that our definition of risk aversion is 
that investors value an extra dollar of income more in bad times than in good times. Thus, 
because security B pays $600 when the economy is weak and the market index performs 
poorly, it pays off when investors’ wealth is low and they value money the most. In fact, 
security B is not really “risky” from an investor’s point of view; rather, security B is an 
insurance policy against an economic decline. By holding security B together with the 
market index, we can eliminate our risk from market fluctuations. Risk-averse investors 
are willing to pay for this insurance by accepting a return below the risk-free interest rate.
This result illustrates an extremely important principle. The risk of a security cannot be 
evaluated in isolation. Even when a security’s returns are quite variable, if the returns vary 
in a way that offsets other risks investors are holding, the security will reduce rather than 
increase investors’ risk. As a result, risk can only be assessed relative to the other risks that 
investors face; that is,
The risk of a security must be evaluated in relation to the fluctuations of other investments 
in the economy. A security’s risk premium will be higher the more its returns tend to vary 
with the overall economy and the market index. If the security’s returns vary in the opposite 
direction of the market index, it offers insurance and will have a negative risk premium.
Table 3A.3 compares the risk and risk premiums for the different securities we have 
considered thus far. For each security we compute the sensitivity of its return to the state 
of the economy by calculating the difference in its return when the economy is strong 
versus weak. Note that the risk premium for each security is proportional to this 
Because the market price of the risk-free bond is $1400 , 1.04 = $1346 today, we can con-
clude from the Law of One Price that security B must have a market price of $1346 - 1000 = 
$346 today.
If the economy is weak, security B pays a return of (600 - 346)/346 = 73.4%. If the ­economy 
is strong, security B pays nothing, for a return of -100%. The expected return of security B is 
therefore 1
2 (73.4%) + 1
2 (-100%) = -13.3%. Its risk premium is -13.3% - 4% = -17.3%; 
that is, security B pays investors 17.3% less on average than the risk-free interest rate.

sensitivity, and the risk premium is negative when the returns vary in the opposite direc-
tion of the market.8
Risk, Return, and Market Prices
We have shown that when cash flows are risky, we can use the Law of One Price to com-
pute present values by constructing a portfolio that produces cash flows with identical risk. 
As shown in Figure 3A.1, computing prices in this way is equivalent to converting between 
cash flows today and the expected cash flows received in the future using a discount rate rs 
that includes a risk premium appropriate for the investment’s risk:
	
rs = rf + (risk premium for investment s)
(3A.2)
For the simple setting considered here with only a single source of risk (the strength of the 
economy), we have seen that the risk premium of an investment depends on how its returns 
vary with the overall economy. In Part 4 of the text, we show that this result holds for more 
general settings with many sources of risk and more than two possible states of the economy.
8You might notice that each security would have an expected return equal to the risk-free rate of 4% if the 
probability of the strong economy were 40% instead of 50%. The fact that risk aversion is equivalent to 
using a more pessimistic probability distribution is an important insight that we will revisit in Chapter 21.

Example 3A.2
Using the Risk Premium to Compute a Price
Problem
Consider a risky bond with a cash flow of $1100 when the economy is strong and $1000 when 
the economy is weak. Suppose a 1% risk premium is appropriate for this bond. If the risk-free 
interest rate is 4%, what is the price of the bond today?
Solution
From Eq. 3A.2, the appropriate discount rate for the bond is
rb = rf + (Risk Premium for the Bond) = 4% + 1% = 5%
The expected cash flow of the bond is 1
2 ($1100) + 1
2 ($1000) = $1050 in one year. Thus, the 
price of the bond today is
 Bond Price = (Average cash flow in one year) , (1 + rb $ in one year/$ today)
 = ($1050 in one year) , (1.05 $ in one year/$ today)
 = $1000 today
Given this price, the bond’s return is 10% when the economy is strong, and 0% when the 
economy is weak. (Note that the difference in the returns is 10%, which is 1/6 as variable as 
the market index; see Table 3A.3. Correspondingly, the risk premium of the bond is 1/6 that of 
the market index as well.)

2.	 Explain why the risk of a security should not be evaluated in isolation.
Arbitrage with Transactions Costs
In our examples up to this point, we have ignored the costs of buying and selling goods 
or securities. In most markets, you must pay transactions costs to trade securities. As 
discussed in Chapter  1, when you trade securities in markets such as the NYSE and 
­NASDAQ, you must pay two types of transactions costs. First, you must pay your broker 
a commission on the trade. Second, because you will generally pay a slightly higher price 
when you buy a security (the ask price) than you receive when you sell (the bid price), you 
will also pay the bid-ask spread. For example, a share of Intel Corporation stock (ticker 
symbol INTC) might be quoted as follows:
Bid:
$28.50
Ask:
$28.70
We can interpret these quotes as if the competitive price for INTC is $28.60, but there is 
a transaction cost of $0.10 per share when buying or selling.9
What consequence do these transactions costs have for no-arbitrage prices and the Law 
of One Price? Earlier we stated that the price of gold in New York and London must be 
­identical in competitive markets. Suppose, however, that total transactions costs of $5 per 
9Any price in between the bid price and the ask price could be the competitive price, with differing trans-
action costs for buying and selling.

ounce are associated with buying gold in one market and selling it in the other. Then if the 
price of gold is $1150 per ounce in New York and $1152 per ounce in London, the “Buy 
low, sell high” strategy no longer works:
Example 3A.3
The No-Arbitrage Price Range
Problem
Consider a bond that pays $1000 at the end of the year. Suppose the market interest rate for 
deposits is 6%, but the market interest rate for borrowing is 6.5%. What is the no-arbitrage price 
range for the bond? That is, what is the highest and lowest price the bond could trade for without 
creating an arbitrage opportunity?
Solution
The no-arbitrage price for the bond equals the present value of the cash flows. In this case, 
however, the interest rate we should use depends on whether we are borrowing or lending. For 
example, the amount we would need to put in the bank today to receive $1000 in one year is
($1000 in one year) , (1.06 $ in one year/$ today) = $943.40 today
where we have used the 6% interest rate that we will earn on our deposit. The amount that we 
can borrow today if we plan to repay $1000 in one year is
($1000 in one year) , (1.065 $ in one year/$ today) = $938.97 today
where we have used the higher 6.5% rate that we will have to pay if we borrow.
Suppose the bond price P exceeded $943.40. Then you could profit by selling the bond at its 
current price and investing $943.40 of the proceeds at the 6% interest rate. You would still receive 
$1000 at the end of the year, but you would get to keep the difference $(P - 943.40) today. This 
arbitrage opportunity will keep the price of the bond from going higher than $943.40.
Alternatively, suppose the bond price P were less than $938.97. Then you could borrow 
$938.97 at 6.5% and use P of it to buy the bond. This would leave you with $(938.97 - P)
Cost:
$1150 per ounce (buy gold in New York) + $5 (transactions costs)
Benefit:
$1152 per ounce (sell gold in London)
NPV:
$1152 - $1150 - $5 = -$3 per ounce
Indeed, there is no arbitrage opportunity in this case until the prices diverge by more than 
$5, the amount of the transactions costs.
In general, we need to modify our previous conclusions about no-arbitrage prices by 
appending the phrase “up to transactions costs.” In this example, there is only one competi-
tive price for gold—up to a discrepancy of the $5 transactions cost. The other conclusions 
of this chapter have the same qualifier. The package price should equal the à la carte price, 
up to the transactions costs associated with packaging and unpackaging. The price of a 
security should equal the present value of its cash flows, up to the transactions costs of trad-
ing the security and the cash flows.
Fortunately, for most financial markets, these costs are small. For example, in 2015, 
typical bid-ask spreads for large NYSE stocks were between 2 and 5 cents per share. As a 
first approximation we can ignore these spreads in our analysis. Only in situations in which 
the NPV is small (relative to the transactions costs) will any discrepancy matter. In that 
case, we will need to carefully account for all transactions costs to decide whether the NPV 
is positive or negative.

To summarize, when there are transactions costs, arbitrage keeps prices of equivalent 
goods and securities close to each other. Prices can deviate, but not by more than the trans-
actions costs of the arbitrage.
today, and no obligation in the future because you can use the $1000 bond payoff to repay the 
loan. This arbitrage opportunity will keep the price of the bond from falling below $938.97.
If the bond price P is between $938.97 and $943.40, then both of the preceding strategies 
will lose money, and there is no arbitrage opportunity. Thus no arbitrage implies a narrow range 
of possible prices for the bond ($938.97 to $943.40), rather than an exact price.

n	 When cash flows are risky, we cannot use the risk-free interest rate to compute present values. 
Instead, we can determine the present value by constructing a portfolio that produces cash

the market index, it offers insurance and will have a negative risk premium.

The LAW Of One Price cOnnectiOn.  For a financial manager, evaluat-
ing financial decisions involves computing the value of future cash flows. In Chapter 4, 
we use the Law of One Price to derive a central concept in financial economics—the 
time value of money. We explain how to value a stream of future cash flows and derive 
a few useful shortcuts for computing the net present value of various types of cash 
flow patterns. Chapter 5 considers how to use market interest rates to determine the 
appropriate discount rate for a set of cash flows. We apply the Law of One Price to dem-
onstrate that the discount rate will depend on the rate of return of investments with 
maturity and risk similar to the cash flows being valued. This observation leads to the 
important concept of the cost of capital of an investment decision.
Firms raise the capital they need for investment by issuing securities. The simplest secu-
rity they can issue is a bond. In Chapter 6 use the tools we developed thus far to 
explain how to value bonds. We will see that the Law of One Price allows us to link bond 
prices and their yields to the term structure of market interest rates.

AS DISCUSSED IN CHAPTER 3,  TO EVALUATE A PROJECT, A financial 
manager must compare its costs and benefits. In most cases, these costs and ben-
efits are spread across time. For example, in September 2008, General Motors (GM) 
unveiled its plans to produce, starting in the 2011 model year, the Chevy Volt, an 
extended-range electric vehicle. GM’s project involved significant upfront research and 
development costs, with revenues and expenses that will occur many years or even 
decades into the future. How can financial managers compare cost and benefits that 
occur over many years?
In order to evaluate a long-term project such as the Chevy Volt, we need tools that 
allow us to compare cash flows that occur at different points in time. We develop these 
tools in this chapter. The first tool is a visual method for representing a stream of cash 
flows: the timeline. After constructing a timeline, we establish three important rules for 
moving cash flows to different points in time. Using these rules, we show how to com-
pute the present and future values of the costs and benefits of a general stream of cash 
flows. By converting all cash flows to a common point in time, these tools allow us to 
compare the costs and benefits of a long-term project, and thus assess its net present 
value, or NPV.  The NPV expresses the net benefit of the project in terms of cash today.
While the general techniques developed in this chapter can be used to value any 
type of asset, certain types of assets have cash flows that follow a regular pattern. We 
develop shortcuts for valuing annuities, perpetuities, and other special cases of assets 
with cash flows that follow regular patterns.

4.1	 The Timeline
We begin our look at valuing cash flows lasting several periods with some basic vocabu-
lary and tools. We refer to a series of cash flows lasting several periods as a stream of cash 
flows. We can represent a stream of cash flows on a timeline, a linear representation of the 
timing of the expected cash flows. Timelines are an important first step in organizing and 
then solving a financial problem. We use them throughout this text.
To illustrate how to construct a timeline, assume that a friend owes you money. He has 
agreed to repay the loan by making two payments of $10,000 at the end of each of the next 
two years. We represent this information on a timeline as follows:
Date
Cash Flow
0
1
2
$0
$10,000
$10,000
Today
End Year 1
Begin Year 2
Year 1
Year 2
Date 0 represents the present. Date 1 is one year later and represents the end of the first year. 
The $10,000 cash flow below date 1 is the payment you will receive at the end of the first 
year. Date 2 is two years from now; it represents the end of the second year. The $10,000 
cash flow below date 2 is the payment you will receive at the end of the second year.
To track cash flows on the timeline, interpret each point on the timeline as a specific 
date. The space between date 0 and date 1 then represents the time period between these 
dates—in this case, the first year of the loan. Date 0 is the beginning of the first year, and 
date 1 is the end of the first year. Similarly, date 1 is the beginning of the second year, and 
date 2 is the end of the second year. By denoting time in this way, date 1 signifies both the 
end of year 1 and the beginning of year 2, which makes sense since those dates are effec-
tively the same point in time.1
In this example, both cash flows are inflows. In many cases, however, a financial deci-
sion will involve both inflows and outflows. To differentiate between the two types of cash 
flows, we assign a different sign to each: Inflows are positive cash flows, whereas outflows 
are negative cash flows.
To illustrate, suppose you’re still feeling generous and have agreed to lend your brother 
$10,000 today. Your brother has agreed to repay this loan in two installments of $6000 at 
the end of each of the next two years. The timeline is as follows:
1That is, there is no real time difference between a cash flow paid at 11:59 p.m. on December 31 and one 
paid at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, although there may be some other differences such as taxation that we 
overlook for now.
Date

$10,000

Year 2
Notice that the first cash flow at date 0 (today) is represented as -$10,000 because it is an 
outflow. The subsequent cash flows of $6000 are positive because they are inflows.
	
4.1  The Timeline

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
So far, we have used timelines to show the cash flows that occur at the end of each year. 
Actually, timelines can represent cash flows that take place at the end of any time period. For 
example, if you pay rent each month, you could use a timeline like the one in our first exam-
ple to represent two rental payments, but you would replace the “year” label with “month.”
Many of the timelines included in this chapter are very simple. Consequently, you may 
feel that it is not worth the time or trouble to construct them. As you progress to more 
difficult problems, however, you will find that timelines identify events in a transaction or 
investment that are easy to overlook. If you fail to recognize these cash flows, you will make 
flawed financial decisions. Therefore, we recommend that you approach every problem by 
drawing the timeline as we do in this chapter.
Example 4.1
Constructing a Timeline
Problem
Suppose you must pay tuition of $10,000 per year for the next two years. Your tuition payments 
must be made in equal installments at the start of each semester. What is the timeline of your 
tuition payments?
Solution
Assuming today is the start of the first semester, your first payment occurs at date 0 (today). The 
remaining payments occur at semester intervals. Using one semester as the period length, we can 
construct a timeline as follows:

4.2	 The Three Rules of Time Travel
Financial decisions often require comparing or combining cash flows that occur at differ-
ent points in time. In this section, we introduce three important rules central to financial 
decision making that allow us to compare or combine values.
Rule 1: Comparing and Combining Values
Our first rule is that it is only possible to compare or combine values at the same point in time. 
This rule restates a conclusion introduced in Chapter 3: Only cash flows in the same units 
can be compared or combined. A dollar today and a dollar in one year are not equivalent. 
Having money now is more valuable than having money in the future; if you have the 
money today you can earn interest on it.
To compare or combine cash flows that occur at different points in time, you first need 
to convert the cash flows into the same units or move them to the same point in time. The 
next two rules show how to move the cash flows on the timeline.

Rule 2: Moving Cash Flows Forward in Time
Suppose we have $1000 today, and we wish to determine the equivalent amount in one 
year’s time. If the current market interest rate is 10%, we can use that rate as an exchange 
rate to move the cash flow forward in time. That is,
($1000 today) * (1.10 $ in one year/$ today) = $1100 in one year
In general, if the market interest rate for the year is r, then we multiply by the interest 
rate factor, (1 + r), to move the cash flow from the beginning to the end of the year. This 
process of moving a value or cash flow forward in time is known as compounding. Our 
second rule stipulates that to move a cash flow forward in time, you must compound it.
We can apply this rule repeatedly. Suppose we want to know how much the $1000 is 
worth in two years’ time. If the interest rate for year 2 is also 10%, then we convert as we 
just did:
($1100 in one year) * (1.10 $ in two years/$ in one year) = $1210 in two years
Let’s represent this calculation on a timeline as follows:
0
$1000
$1100
$1210
1
2
 1.10
 1.10
Given a 10% interest rate, all of the cash flows—$1000 at date 0, $1100 at date 1, and 
$1210 at date 2—are equivalent. They have the same value but are expressed in different 
units (different points in time). An arrow that points to the right indicates that the value is 
being moved forward in time—that is, compounded.
The value of a cash flow that is moved forward in time is known as its future value. In 
the preceding example, $1210 is the future value of $1000 two years from today. Note 
that the value grows as we move the cash flow further in the future. The difference in value 
between money today and money in the future represents the time value of money, and it 
reflects the fact that by having money sooner, you can invest it and have more money later 
as a result. Note also that the equivalent value grows by $100 the first year, but by $110 
the second year. In the second year we earn interest on our original $1000, plus we earn 
interest on the $100 interest we received in the first year. This effect of earning “interest on 
interest” is known as compound interest.
How does the future value change if we move the cash flow three years? Continuing 
with the same approach, we compound the cash flow a third time. Assuming the competi-
tive market interest rate is fixed at 10%, we get
$1000 * (1.10) * (1.10) * (1.10) = $1000 * (1.10)3 = $1331
In general, to take a cash flow C forward n periods into the future, we must compound 
it by the n intervening interest rate factors. If the interest rate r is constant, then

FVn = C * (1 + r) * (1 + r) * g*(1 + r) = C * (1 + r)n

The Power of Compounding
Problem
Suppose you invest $1000 in an account paying 10% interest per year. How much will you have 
in the account in 7 years? in 20 years? in 75 years?
Solution
You can apply Eq. 4.1 to calculate the future value in each case:
7 years:	
$1000 * (1.10)7 = $1948.72
20 years:	
$1000 * (1.10)20 = $6727.50
75 years:	
$1000 * (1.10)75 = $1,271,895.37
Note that at 10% interest, your money will nearly double in 7 years. After 20 years, it will 
increase almost 7-fold. And if you invest for 75 years, you will be a millionaire!

The Composition of 
­Interest over Time
This graph shows the account 
balance and the composition 
of interest over time when an 
­investor starts with an initial 
deposit of $1000, shown at 
bottom in red, in an account 
paying 10% annual interest. The 
green (middle) bars show the 
effect of simple interest, inter-
est earned only on the initial 
deposit. The blue (top) bars 
show the effect of compound 
interest, where ­interest is also 
earned on prior interest pay-
ments. Over time, the effect 
of compounding is more pro-
nounced, and by year 20, the 
total amount of simple interest 
earned is only $2000, whereas 
interest on interest is $3727.50
Figure 4.1 shows the importance of earning “interest on interest” in the growth of the 
account balance over time. The type of growth that results from compounding is called 
geometric or exponential growth. As Example 4.2 shows, over a long horizon, the effect of 
compounding can be quite dramatic.
Rule 3: Moving Cash Flows Back in Time
The third rule describes how to move cash flows backward in time. Suppose you would like 
to compute the value today of $1000 you anticipate receiving in one year. If the current 

market interest rate is 10%, you can compute this value by converting units as we did in 
Chapter 3:
($1000 in one year) , (1.10 $ in one year/$ today) = $909.09 today
That is, to move the cash flow backward in time, we divide it by the interest rate factor, 
(1 + r), where r is the interest rate. This process of moving a value or cash flow backward 
in time—finding the equivalent value today of a future cash flow—is known as discounting. 
Our third rule stipulates that to move a cash flow back in time, we must discount it.
To illustrate, suppose that you anticipate receiving the $1000 two years from today rather 
than in one year. If the interest rate for both years is 10%, we can prepare the following timeline:
Rule of 72
Another way to think about the effect of compounding and 
discounting is to consider how long it will take your money 
to double given different interest rates. Suppose we want to 
know how many years it will take for $1 to grow to a future 
value of $2. We want the number of years, N, to solve
FV = $1 * (1 + r)N = $2
If you solve this formula for different interest rates, you will 
find the following approximation:
Years to double  72 ,  (interest rate in percent)
This simple “Rule of 72” is fairly accurate (i.e., within 
one year of the exact doubling time) for interest rates higher 
than 2%. For example, if the interest rate is 9%, the 
­doubling time should be about 72 , 9 = 8 years. Indeed, 
1.098 = 1.99! So, given a 9% interest rate, your money will 
approximately double every eight years.2
2See the appendix to this chapter for an explanation of how to calculate the exact doubling time.

When the interest rate is 10%, all of the cash flows—$826.45 at date 0, $909.09 at date 
1, and $1000 at date 2—are equivalent. They represent the same value in different units 
(different points in time). The arrow points to the left to indicate that the value is being 
moved backward in time or discounted. Note that the value decreases as we move the cash 
flow further back.
The value of a future cash flow at an earlier point on the timeline is its present value at 
the earlier point in time. That is, $826.45 is the present value at date 0 of $1000 in two 
years. Recall from Chapter 3 that the present value is the “do-it-yourself” price to produce 
a future cash flow. Thus, if we invested $826.45 today for two years at 10% interest, we 
would have a future value of $1000, using the second rule of time travel:

intervening interest rate factors. If the interest rate r is constant, then

Problem
You are considering investing in a savings bond that will pay $15,000 in 10 years. If the competi-
tive market interest rate is fixed at 6% per year, what is the bond worth today?
Solution
The cash flows for this bond are represented by the following timeline:
Thus, the bond is worth $15,000 in 10 years. To determine the value today, we compute the 
present value:
PV = 15,000
1.0610 = $8375.92 today
The bond is worth much less today than its final payoff because of the time value of money.

Applying the Rules of Time Travel
The rules of time travel allow us to compare and combine cash flows that occur at different 
points in time. Suppose we plan to save $1000 today, and $1000 at the end of each of the 
next two years. If we earn a fixed 10% interest rate on our savings, how much will we have 
three years from today?
Again, we start with a timeline:
The timeline shows the three deposits we plan to make. We need to compute their value 
at the end of three years.
We can use the rules of time travel in a number of ways to solve this problem. First, we 
can take the deposit at date 0 and move it forward to date 1. Because it is then in the same 

time period as the date 1 deposit, we can combine the two amounts to find out the total in 
the bank on date 1:

?
$1000
$1000
$1100

Using the first two rules of time travel, we find that our total savings on date 1 will be 
$2100. Continuing in this fashion, we can solve the problem as follows:

$3641
The total amount we will have in the bank at the end of three years is $3641. This amount 
is the future value of our $1000 savings deposits.
Another approach to the problem is to compute the future value in year 3 of each cash 
flow separately. Once all three amounts are in year 3 dollars, we can then combine them.

same result. The order in which we apply the rules does not matter. The calculation we 
choose depends on which is more convenient for the problem at hand. Table 4.1 summa-
rizes the three rules of time travel and their associated formulas.

4.3	 Valuing a Stream of Cash Flows
Most investment opportunities have multiple cash flows that occur at different points in 
time. In Section 4.2, we applied the rules of time travel to value such cash flows. Now, we 
formalize this approach by deriving a general formula for valuing a stream of cash flows.
Consider a stream of cash flows: C0 at date 0, C1 at date 1, and so on, up to CN at date N. 
We represent this cash flow stream on a timeline as follows:

Computing the Future Value
Problem
Let’s revisit the savings plan we considered earlier: We plan to save $1000 today and at the end 
of each of the next two years. At a fixed 10% interest rate, how much will we have in the bank 
three years from today?
Solution
Let’s solve this problem in a different way than we did earlier. First, compute the present value of 
the cash flows. There are several ways to perform this calculation. Here we treat each cash flow 
separately and then combine the present values.
Saving $2735.54 today is equivalent to saving $1000 per year for three years. Now let’s compute 
its future value in year 3:
This answer of $3641 is precisely the same result we found earlier. As long as we apply the three 
rules of time travel, we will always get the correct answer.

Using the time travel techniques, we compute the present value of this cash flow stream in 
two steps. First, we compute the present value of each individual cash flow. Then, once the 
cash flows are in common units of dollars today, we can combine them.
For a given interest rate r, we represent this process on the timeline as follows:
This timeline provides the general formula for the present value of a cash flow stream:
	
PV = C0 +
C1
(1 + r) +
C2
(1 + r)2 + g +

(4.3)
We can also write this formula as a summation:

 PV (Cn) = a

(4.4)
The summation sign, , means “sum the individual elements for each date n from 0 to 
N.” Note that (1 + r)0 = 1, so this shorthand matches precisely Eq. 4.3. That is, the pres-
ent value of the cash flow stream is the sum of the present values of each cash flow. Recall 
from Chapter 3 how we defined the present value as the dollar amount you would need 
to invest today to produce the single cash flow in the future. The same idea holds in this 
context. The present value is the amount you need to invest today to generate the cash 
flow stream C0, C1, c , CN. That is, receiving those cash flows is equivalent to having 
their present value in the bank today.
Example 4.5
Present Value of a Stream of Cash Flows
Problem
You have just graduated and need money to buy a new car. Your rich Uncle Henry will lend you 
the money so long as you agree to pay him back within four years, and you offer to pay him the 
rate of interest that he would otherwise get by putting his money in a savings account. Based on 
your earnings and living expenses, you think you will be able to pay him $5000 in one year, and

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
then $8000 each year for the next three years. If Uncle Henry would otherwise earn 6% per year 
on his savings, how much can you borrow from him?
Solution
The cash flows you can promise Uncle Henry are as follows:
How much money should Uncle Henry be willing to give you today in return for your prom-
ise of these payments? He should be willing to give you an amount that is equivalent to these 
payments in present value terms. This is the amount of money that it would take him to produce 
these same cash flows, which we calculate as follows:
 PV = 5000
1.06 + 8000
1.062 + 8000
1.063 + 8000
1.064
 = 4716.98 + 7119.97 + 6716.95 + 6336.75
 = 24,890.65
Thus, Uncle Henry should be willing to lend you $24,890.65 in exchange for your promised 
­payments. This amount is less than the total you will pay him ($5000+$8000+$8000+$8000
= $29,000) due to the time value of money.
Let’s verify our answer. If your uncle kept his $24,890.65 in the bank today earning 6% inter-
est, in four years he would have
FV = $24,890.65 * (1.06)4 = $31,423.87 in four years
Now suppose that Uncle Henry gives you the money, and then deposits your payments to 
him in the bank each year. How much will he have four years from now?
We need to compute the future value of the annual deposits. One way to do so is to compute 
the bank balance each year:
We get the same answer both ways (within a penny, which is because of rounding).

The last section of Example 4.5 illustrates a general point. If you want to compute the 
future value of a stream of cash flows, you can do it directly (the second approach used in 
Example 4.5), or you can first compute the present value and then move it to the future 
(the first approach). Because we obey the laws of time travel in both cases, we get the same 

result. This principle can be applied more generally to write the following formula for the 
future value in year n in terms of the present value of a set of cash flows:

4.4	 Calculating the Net Present Value
Now that we have established the rules of time travel and determined how to compute 
present and future values, we are ready to address our central goal: comparing the costs 
and benefits of a project to evaluate a long-term investment decision. From our first rule 
of time travel, to compare cash flows we must value them at a common point in time. A 
convenient choice is to use present values. In particular, we define the net present value 
(NPV) of an investment decision as follows:
	
NPV = PV(benefits) - PV(costs)
(4.6)
In this context, the benefits are the cash inflows and the costs are the cash outflows. We can 
represent any investment decision on a timeline as a cash flow stream where the cash out-
flows (investments) are negative cash flows and the inflows are positive cash flows. Thus, 
the NPV of an investment opportunity is also the present value of the stream of cash flows 
of the opportunity:
NPV = PV(benefits) - PV(costs) = PV(benefits - costs)
Example 4.6
 Net Present Value of an Investment Opportunity
Problem
You have been offered the following investment opportunity: If you invest $1000 today, you will 
receive $500 at the end of each of the next three years. If you could otherwise earn 10% per year 
on your money, should you undertake the investment opportunity?
Solution
As always, we start with a timeline. We denote the upfront investment as a negative cash flow 
(because it is money we need to spend) and the money we receive as a positive cash flow.
To decide whether we should accept this opportunity, we compute the NPV by computing 
the present value of the stream:
NPV = -1000 + 500
1.10 + 500
1.102 + 500
1.103 = $243.43

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
In principle, we have explained how to answer the question we posed at the beginning 
of the chapter: How should financial managers evaluate the cash flows from undertaking 
a multi-year project like the Chevy Volt? We have shown how to compute the NPV of an 
investment opportunity such as the Chevy Volt that lasts more than one period. In prac-
tice, when the number of cash flows exceeds four or five (as it most likely will), the calcula-
tions can become tedious. Fortunately, a number of special cases do not require us to treat 
each cash flow separately. We derive these shortcuts in Section 4.5.
Because the NPV is positive, the benefits exceed the costs and we should make the investment. 
Indeed, the NPV tells us that taking this opportunity is like getting an extra $243.43 that you 
can spend today. To illustrate, suppose you borrow $1000 to invest in the opportunity and an 
extra $243.43 to spend today. How much would you owe on the $1243.43 loan in three years? 
At 10% interest, the amount you would owe would be
FV = ($1000 + $243.43) * (1.10)3 = $1655 in three years
At the same time, the investment opportunity generates cash flows. If you put these cash flows into a 
bank account, how much will you have saved three years from now? The future value of the savings is
FV = ($500 * 1.102) + ($500 * 1.10) + $500 = $1655 in three years
As you see, you can use your bank savings to repay the loan. Taking the opportunity therefore 
allows you to spend $243.43 today at no extra cost.
Calculating NPV
While present and future value calculations can be done with a calculator, it is often convenient 
to evaluate them using a spreadsheet program. For example, the following spreadsheet calculates 
the NPV in Example 4.6:
Rows 1–3 provide the key data of the problem, the discount rate, and the cash flow timeline 
(note we use a blue font to indicate input data, and black for cells that are fixed or calculated). 
Row 4 then calculates the discount factor, 1/(1 + r)n, the present value of a dollar received in year 
n. We multiply each cash flow by the discount factor to convert it to a present value, shown in 
row 5. Finally, row 6 shows the sum of the present values of all the cash flows, which is the NPV. 
The formulas in rows 4–6 are shown below:
Alternatively, we could have computed the entire NPV in one step, using a single (long) for-
mula. We recommend as a best practice that you avoid that temptation and calculate the NPV 
step by step. Doing so facilitates error checking and makes clear the contribution of each cash 
flow to the overall NPV.

4.5	 Perpetuities and Annuities
The formulas we have developed so far allow us to compute the present or future value of 
any cash flow stream. In this section, we consider two special types of cash flow streams, 
perpetuities and annuities, and we learn shortcuts for valuing them. These shortcuts are pos-
sible because the cash flows follow a regular pattern.
Perpetuities
A perpetuity is a stream of equal cash flows that occur at regular intervals and last forever. 
One example is the British government bond called a consol (or perpetual bond). Consol 
bonds promise the owner a fixed cash flow every year, forever.
Here is the timeline for a perpetuity:

Excel’s NPV Function
Excel also has a built-in NPV function. This function has the format NPV (rate, value1, value2, 
. . . ), where “rate” is the interest rate per period used to discount the cash flows, and “value1”, 
“value2”, and so on are the cash flows (or ranges of cash flows). Unfortunately, however, the NPV 
function computes the present value of the cash flows assuming the first cash flow occurs at date 1. 
Therefore, if a project’s first cash flow occurs at date 0, we must add it separately. For example, in 
the spreadsheet above, we would need the formula
= B3 + NPV(B1, C3:E3)
to calculate the NPV of the indicated cash flows.
Another pitfall with the NPV function is that cash flows that are left blank are treated differ-
ently from cash flows that are equal to zero. If the cash flow is left blank, both the cash flow and 
the period are ignored. For example, consider the example below in which the period 2 cash flow 
has been deleted:
Our original method provides the correct solution in row 6, whereas the NPV function used 
in row 7 treats the cash flow in period 3 as though it occurred at period 2, which is clearly not 
what is intended and is incorrect.

Historical Examples of Perpetuities
Companies sometimes issue bonds that they call perpetuit-
ies, but in fact are not really perpetuities. For example, in 
mid-2010, Europe’s largest bank, HSBC, sold $3.4 billion 
of “perpetual” bonds that promise investors a fixed amount 
each year with no maturity date. But while the bonds have 
no fixed maturity, they are not exactly true perpetuities as 
HSBC has the right to pay off the bonds after 5 1/2 years. 
Thus, the bond’s payments might not last forever.
Perpetual bonds were some of the first bonds ever 
issued. The oldest perpetuities that are still making inter-
est payments were issued in 1624 by the Hoogheemraadschap 
Lekdijk Bovendams, a seventeenth-century Dutch water 
board responsible for upkeep of the local dikes. To verify 
that these bonds continue to pay interest, two finance pro-
fessors at Yale University, William Goetzmann and Geert 
Rouwenhorst, purchased one of these bonds in July 2003, 
and collected 26 years of back interest. On its issue date in 
1648, this bond originally paid interest in Carolus guilders. 
Over the next 355 years, the currency of payment changed 
to Flemish pounds, Dutch guilders, and most recently euros. 
Currently, the bond pays interest of €11.34 annually.
Although the Dutch bonds are the oldest perpetuities 
still in existence, the first perpetuities date from much ear-
lier times. For example, cencus agreements and rentes, which 
were forms of perpetuities and annuities, were issued in the 
twelfth century in Italy, France, and Spain. They were ini-
tially designed to circumvent the usury laws of the Catho-
lic Church: Because they did not require the repayment of 
principal, in the eyes of the church they were not considered 
loans.
Note from the timeline that the first cash flow does not occur immediately; it arrives at the 
end of the first period. This timing is sometimes referred to as payment in arrears and is a 
standard convention that we adopt throughout this text.
Using the formula for the present value, the present value of a perpetuity with payment 
C and interest rate r is given by
PV =
C
(1 + r) +
C
(1 + r)2 +
C
(1 + r)3 + g = a

n=1
C
(1 + r)n
Notice that Cn = C in the present value formula because the cash flow for a perpetuity is 
constant. Also, because the first cash flow is in one period, C0 = 0.
To find the value of a perpetuity one cash flow at a time would take forever—literally! You 
might wonder how, even with a shortcut, the sum of an infinite number of positive terms 
could be finite. The answer is that the cash flows in the future are discounted for an ever-
increasing number of periods, so their contribution to the sum eventually becomes negligible.3
To derive the shortcut, we calculate the value of a perpetuity by creating our own per-
petuity. We can then calculate the present value of the perpetuity because, by the Law of 
One Price, the value of the perpetuity must be the same as the cost we would incur to 
create it ourselves. To illustrate, suppose you could invest $100 in a bank account paying 
5% interest per year forever. At the end of one year, you will have $105 in the bank—your 
original $100 plus $5 in interest. Suppose you withdraw the $5 interest and reinvest the 
$100 for a second year. Again you will have $105 after one year, and you can withdraw 
$5 and reinvest $100 for another year. By doing this year after year, you can withdraw $5 
every year in perpetuity:
3In mathematical terms, this is a geometric series, so it converges if r 7 0.

By investing $100 in the bank today, you can, in effect, create a perpetuity paying 
$5 per year. The Law of One Price tells us that the same good must have the same price 
in every market. Because the bank will “sell” us (allow us to create) the perpetuity for 
$100, the present value of the $5 per year in perpetuity is this “do-it-yourself ” cost of 
$100.
Now let’s generalize this argument. Suppose we invest an amount P in the bank. Every 
year we can withdraw the interest we have earned, C = r * P, leaving the principal, P, 
in the bank. The present value of receiving C in perpetuity is therefore the upfront cost 
P = C/r. Therefore,
Present Value of a Perpetuity
	
PV (C in perpetuity) = C
r 
(4.7)
In other words, by depositing the amount C/r today, we can withdraw interest of 
(C/r ) * r = C each period in perpetuity. Thus, the present value of the perpetuity is C/r.
Note the logic of our argument. To determine the present value of a cash flow stream, 
we computed the “do-it-yourself ” cost of creating those same cash flows at the bank. This 
is an extremely useful and powerful approach—and is much simpler and faster than sum-
ming those infinite terms!4
4Another mathematical derivation of this result exists (see online appendix at www.berkdemarzo.com), but it 
is less intuitive. This case is a good example of how the Law of One Price can be used to derive useful results.
Example 4.7 
Endowing a Perpetuity
Problem
You want to endow an annual MBA graduation party at your alma mater. You want the event to 
be a memorable one, so you budget $30,000 per year forever for the party. If the university earns 
8% per year on its investments, and if the first party is in one year’s time, how much will you 
need to donate to endow the party?
Solution
The timeline of the cash flows you want to provide is
This is a standard perpetuity of $30,000 per year. The funding you would need to give the uni-
versity in perpetuity is the present value of this cash flow stream. From the formula,
PV = C/r = $30,000/0.08 = $375,000 today
If you donate $375,000 today, and if the university invests it at 8% per year forever, then the 
MBAs will have $30,000 every year for their graduation party.

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
Annuities
An annuity is a stream of N equal cash flows paid at regular intervals. The difference 
between an annuity and a perpetuity is that an annuity ends after some fixed number of 
payments. Most car loans, mortgages, and some bonds are annuities. We represent the cash 
flows of an annuity on a timeline as follows.

Note that just as with the perpetuity, we adopt the convention that the first payment

Present Value of an Annuity.  To find a simpler formula, we use the same approach we 
followed with the perpetuity: find a way to create an annuity. To illustrate, suppose you 
invest $100 in a bank account paying 5% interest. At the end of one year, you will have 
$105 in the bank—your original $100 plus $5 in interest. Using the same strategy as for a 
perpetuity, suppose you withdraw the $5 interest and reinvest the $100 for a second year. 
Once again you will have $105 after one year, and you can repeat the process, withdraw-
ing $5 and reinvesting $100, every year. For a perpetuity, you left the principal in forever. 
Discounting One Too Many Times
The perpetuity formula assumes that the first payment 
occurs at the end of the first period (at date 1). Sometimes 
perpetuities have cash flows that start later in the future. In 
this case, we can adapt the perpetuity formula to compute 
the present value, but we need to do so carefully to avoid a 
common mistake.
To illustrate, consider the MBA graduation party 
described in Example  4.7. Rather than starting immedi-
ately, suppose that the first party will be held two years from 
today (for the current entering class). How would this delay 
change the amount of the donation required?
Now the timeline looks like this:
We need to determine the present value of these cash flows, 
as it tells us the amount of money in the bank needed today 
to finance the future parties. We cannot apply the perpetuity 
formula directly, however, because these cash flows are not 
exactly a perpetuity as we defined it. Specifically, the cash 
flow in the first period is “missing.” But consider the situ-
ation on date 1—at that point, the first party is one period 
away and then the cash flows are periodic. From the per-
spective of date 1, this is a perpetuity, and we can apply the 
formula. From the preceding calculation, we know we need 
$375,000 on date 1 to have enough to start the parties on 
date 2. We rewrite the timeline as follows:
Our goal can now be restated more simply: How much do 
we need to invest today to have $375,000 in one year? This 
is a simple present value calculation:
PV = $375,000/1.08 = $347,222 today
A common mistake is to discount the $375,000 twice 
because the first party is in two periods. Remember—the 
present value formula for the perpetuity already discounts the 
cash flows to one period prior to the first cash flow. Keep in 
mind that this common mistake may be made with perpetu-
ities, annuities, and all of the other special cases discussed in 
this section. All of these formulas discount the cash flows to 
one period prior to the first cash flow.

Alternatively, you might decide after 20 years to close the account and withdraw the prin-
cipal. In that case, your cash flows will look like this:

With your initial $100 investment, you have created a 20-year annuity of $5 per year, plus 
you will receive an extra $100 at the end of 20 years. By the Law of One Price, because 
it took an initial investment of $100 to create the cash flows on the timeline, the present 
value of these cash flows is $100, or
$100 = PV (20@year annuity of $5 per year) + PV ($100 in 20 years)
Rearranging terms gives
 PV (20@year annuity of $5 per year) = $100 - PV ($100 in 20 years)
 = 100 -
100
(1.05)20 = $62.31
So the present value of $5 for 20 years is $62.31. Intuitively, the value of the annuity is the 
initial investment in the bank account minus the present value of the principal that will be 
left in the account after 20 years.
We can use the same idea to derive the general formula. First, we invest P in the bank, 
and withdraw only the interest C = r * P each period. After N periods, we close the 
account. Thus, for an initial investment of P, we will receive an N-period annuity of C per 
period, plus we will get back our original P at the end. P is the total present value of the two 
sets of cash flows, or
P = PV (annuity of C for N periods) + PV (P in period N  )
By rearranging terms, we compute the present value of the annuity:
	
 PV (annuity of C for N periods) = P - PV (P in period N  )
	
 = P -

Recall that the periodic payment C is the interest earned every period; that is, C = r * P 
or, equivalently, solving for P provides the upfront cost in terms of C,
P = C/r
Making this substitution for P, in Eq. 4.8, provides the formula for the present value of an 
annuity of C for N periods.

as (a) 30 payments of $1 million per year (starting today), or (b) $15 million paid today. If the 
interest rate is 8%, which option should you take?
Solution
Option (a) provides $30 million of prize money but paid annually. In this case, the cash flows are 
an annuity in which the first payment begins immediately, sometimes called an annuity due.6
Because the first payment is paid today, the last payment will occur in 29 years (for a total of 
30 payments). We can compute the present value of the final 29 payments as a standard annuity 
of $1 million per year using the annuity formula:
 PV(29 yr annuity of $1 million/yr) = $1 million * 1
.08
 ¢1 -
1
1.0829 ≤
 = $11.16 million today
Adding the $1 million we receive upfront, this option has a present value of $12.16 million:
Therefore, the present value of option (a) is only $12.16 million, and so it is more valuable to 
take option (b) and receive $15 million upfront—even though we receive only half the total cash 
amount. The difference, of course, is due to the time value of money. To see that (b) really is better, if 
you have the $15 million today, you can use $1 million immediately and invest the remaining $14 
million at an 8% interest rate. This strategy will give you $14 million * 8% = $1.12 million per 
year in perpetuity! Alternatively, you can spend $15 million - $11.16 million = $3.84 million 
today, and invest the remaining $11.16 million, which will still allow you to withdraw $1 million 
each year for the next 29 years before your account is depleted.
6Throughout the text, we will always use the term “annuity” on its own to mean one that is paid in arrears, 
starting at the end of the first period.

Future Value of an Annuity.  Now that we have derived a simple formula for the present 
value of an annuity, it is easy to find a simple formula for the future value. If we want to 
know the value N years in the future, we move the present value N periods forward on the 
timeline; that is, we compound the present value for N periods at interest rate r:
Future Value of an Annuity
	
 FV (annuity) = PV * (1 + r)N

(1 + r)N≤* (1 + r)N

(4.10)
This formula is useful if we want to know how a savings account will grow over time. Let’s 
apply this result to evaluate a retirement savings plan.

Example 4.9
Retirement Savings Plan Annuity
Problem
Ellen is 35 years old, and she has decided it is time to plan seriously for her retirement. At the 
end of each year until she is 65, she will save $10,000 in a retirement account. If the account 
earns 10% per year, how much will Ellen have saved at age 65?
Solution
As always, we begin with a timeline. In this case, it is helpful to keep track of both the dates and 
Ellen’s age:
Ellen’s savings plan looks like an annuity of $10,000 per year for 30 years. (Hint: It is easy to 
become confused when you just look at age, rather than at both dates and age. A common error 
is to think there are only 65 - 36 = 29 payments. Writing down both dates and age avoids this 
problem.)
To determine the amount Ellen will have in the bank at age 65, we compute the future value 
of this annuity:
 FV = $10,000 *
1
0.10
 (1.1030 - 1)
 = $10,000 * 164.49
 = $1.645 million at age 65

Growing Cash Flows
So far, we have considered only cash flow streams that have the same cash flow every 
period. If, instead, the cash flows are expected to grow at a constant rate in each period, we 
can also derive a simple formula for the present value of the future stream.

Formula for an Annuity Due
Although it is straightforward to calculate the value of an 
annuity due as we did in Example 4.8 it is not uncommon 
for practitioners to use the following equivalent formula:
PV(annuity due of C for N periods) =
C * 1
r
 ¢
 1 -

(1 + r)N

To understand where this formula comes from, note that 
one can think of an annuity due as the future value of a 
regular annuity in one year. To illustrate, compute the pres-
ent value of the regular annuity in Example 4.8:
PV(30 yr annuity of $1 million/yr) =
$1 million * 1

Growing Perpetuity.  A growing perpetuity is a stream of cash flows that occur at regular 
intervals and grow at a constant rate forever. For example, a growing perpetuity with a first 
payment of $100 that grows at a rate of 3% has the following timeline:

. . .
In general, a growing perpetuity with a first payment C and a growth rate g will have the 
following series of cash flows:
As with perpetuities with equal cash flows, we adopt the convention that the first payment 
occurs at date 1. Note a second important convention: The first payment does not include 
growth. That is, the first payment is C, even though it is one period away. Similarly, the 
cash flow in period n undergoes only n - 1 periods of growth. Substituting the cash flows 
from the preceding timeline into the general formula for the present value of a cash flow 
stream gives
PV =
C
(1 + r) +
C(1 + g)
(1 + r)2 +
C(1 + g)2
(1 + r)3 + g = a

n=1
C(1 + g)n-1
(1 + r)n
Suppose g Ú r. Then the cash flows grow even faster than they are discounted; each term 
in the sum gets larger, rather than smaller. In this case, the sum is infinite! What does an 
infinite present value mean? Remember that the present value is the “do-it-yourself ⁜” cost of 
creating the cash flows. An infinite present value means that no matter how much money 
you start with, it is impossible to sustain a growth rate of g forever and reproduce those cash 
flows on your own. Growing perpetuities of this sort cannot exist in practice because no one 
would be willing to offer one at any finite price. A promise to pay an amount that forever 
grew faster than the interest rate is also unlikely to be kept (or believed by any savvy buyer).
The only viable growing perpetuities are those where the perpetual growth rate is less 
than the interest rate, so that each successive term in the sum is less than the previous term 
and the overall sum is finite. Consequently, we assume that g 6 r for a growing perpetuity.
To derive the formula for the present value of a growing perpetuity, we follow the same 
logic used for a regular perpetuity: Compute the amount you would need to deposit today 
to create the perpetuity yourself. In the case of a regular perpetuity, we created a constant 
payment forever by withdrawing the interest earned each year and reinvesting the princi-
pal. To increase the amount we can withdraw each year, the principal that we reinvest each 
year must grow. Therefore, we withdraw less than the full amount of interest earned each 
period, using the remaining interest to increase our principal.
Let’s consider a specific case. Suppose you want to create a perpetuity with cash flows 
that grow by 2% per year, and you invest $100 in a bank account that pays 5% inter-
est. At the end of one year, you will have $105 in the bank—your original $100 plus 
$5 in interest. If you withdraw only $3, you will have $102 to reinvest—2% more than 
the amount you had initially. This amount will then grow to $102 * 1.05 = $107.10 
in the following year, and you can withdraw $3 * 1.02 = $3.06, which will leave you 

with principal of $107.10 - $3.06 = $104.04. Note that $102 * 1.02 = $104.04. That 
is, both the amount you withdraw and the principal you reinvest grow by 2% each year. 
On a timeline, these cash flows look like this:
By following this strategy, you have created a growing perpetuity that starts at $3 and 
grows 2% per year. This growing perpetuity must have a present value equal to the cost 
of $100.
We can generalize this argument. In the case of an equal-payment perpetuity, we depos-
ited an amount P in the bank and withdrew the interest each year. Because we always left 
the principal P in the bank, we could maintain this pattern forever. If we want to increase 
the amount we withdraw from the bank each year by g, then the principal in the bank will 
have to grow by the same factor g. So, instead of withdrawing all of the interest rP, we leave 
gP in the bank in addition to our original principal P, and only withdraw C = (r - g)P. 
Solving this last equation for P, the initial amount deposited in the bank account, gives the 
present value of a growing perpetuity with initial cash flow C⁜渠屮:
Present Value of a Growing Perpetuity
	
PV (growing perpetuity) =
C
r - g 
(4.11)
To understand the formula for a growing perpetuity intuitively, start with the formula 
for a perpetuity. In the earlier case, you had to put enough money in the bank to ensure 
that the interest earned matched the cash flows of the regular perpetuity. In the case of a 
growing perpetuity, you need to put more than that amount in the bank because you have 
to finance the growth in the cash flows. How much more? If the bank pays interest at a rate 
of 5%, then all that is left to take out if you want to make sure the principal grows 2% per 
year is the difference: 5% - 2% = 3%. So instead of the present value of the perpetuity 
being the first cash flow divided by the interest rate, it is now the first cash flow divided by 
the difference between the interest rate and the growth rate.

Endowing a Growing Perpetuity
Problem
In Example 4.7, you planned to donate money to your alma mater to fund an annual $30,000 
MBA graduation party. Given an interest rate of 8% per year, the required donation was the 
present value of
PV = $30,000/0.08 = $375,000 today
Before accepting the money, however, the MBA student association has asked that you increase 
the donation to account for the effect of inflation on the cost of the party in future years. 
Although $30,000 is adequate for next year’s party, the students estimate that the party’s cost will 
rise by 4% per year thereafter. To satisfy their request, how much do you need to donate now?

Growing Annuity.  A growing annuity is a stream of N growing cash flows, paid at regular 
intervals. It is a growing perpetuity that eventually comes to an end. The following timeline 
shows a growing annuity with initial cash flow C, growing at rate g every period until period N:
The conventions used earlier still apply: (1) The first cash flow arrives at the end of the first 
period, and (2) the first cash flow does not grow. The last cash flow therefore reflects only 
N - 1 periods of growth.
The present value of an N-period growing annuity with initial cash flow C, growth rate 
g, and interest rate r is given by

Because the annuity has only a finite number of terms, Eq. 4.12 also works when g 7 r.7 The 
process of deriving this simple expression for the present value of a growing annuity is the 
same as for a regular annuity. Interested readers may consult the online appendix at www.
berkdemarzo.com for details.
7Eq. 4.12 does not work for g = r. But in that case, growth and discounting cancel out, and the present 
value is equivalent to receiving all the cash flows at date 1: PV = C * N/(1 + r)
Solution
The cost of the party next year is $30,000, and the cost then increases 4% per year forever. From 
the timeline, we recognize the form of a growing perpetuity. To finance the growing cost, you 
need to provide the present value today of
PV = $30,000/(0.08 - 0.04) = $750,000 today
You need to double the size of your gift!

Example 4.11
Retirement Savings with a Growing Annuity
Problem
In Example 4.9, Ellen considered saving $10,000 per year for her retirement. Although $10,000 
is the most she can save in the first year, she expects her salary to increase each year so that she 
will be able to increase her savings by 5% per year. With this plan, if she earns 10% per year on 
her savings, how much will Ellen have saved at age 65?
Solution
Her new savings plan is represented by the following timeline:

The formula for the growing annuity encompasses all of the other formulas in this 
section. To see how to derive the other formulas from this one, first consider a growing 
­perpetuity. It is a growing annuity with N =  . If g 6 r, then
1 + g
1 + r 6 1,
and so
¢
1 + g
1 + r ≤
N
S 0 as N S  .
The formula for a growing annuity when N =  therefore becomes
PV =
C
r - g ¢1 - a
1 + g
1 + r b
N

C
r - g (1 - 0) =
C
r - g ,
which is the formula for a growing perpetuity. The formulas for a regular annuity and per-
petuity also follow from the formula if we let the growth rate g = 0. So, if you remember 
the growing annuity formula, you’ve got them all!
This example involves a 30-year growing annuity, with a growth rate of 5%, and an initial cash 
flow of $10,000. The present value of this growing annuity is given by
 PV = $10,000 *

 ¢1 - a 1.05

30
≤
 = $10,000 * 15.0463
 = $150,463 today
Ellen’s proposed savings plan is equivalent to having $150,463 in the bank today. To determine 
the amount she will have at age 65, we need to move this amount forward 30 years:
 FV = $150,463 * 1.1030
 = $2.625 million in 30 years
Ellen will have saved $2.625 million at age 65 using the new savings plan. This sum is almost 
$1 million more than she had without the additional annual increases in savings.

4.6	 Using an Annuity Spreadsheet or Calculator
Spreadsheet programs such as Excel, as well as common financial calculators, have a set of 
functions that perform the calculations that finance professionals do most often. In Excel, 
the functions are called NPER, RATE, PV, PMT, and FV. The functions are all based on 
the timeline of an annuity:
0
PV
1
PMT
2
PMT
NPER
PMT  FV
. . .
The interest rate used to discount these cash flows is denoted by RATE. Thus, there are a 
total of five variables: NPER, RATE, PV, PMT, and FV. Each function takes four of these 
variables as inputs and returns the value of the fifth one that ensures that the NPV of the 
cash flows is zero. That is, the functions all solve the problem
	
NPV = PV + PMT *

RATE

(4.13)
In words, the present value of the annuity payments PMT, plus the present value of the 
final payment FV, plus the initial amount PV, has a net present value of zero. Let’s tackle 
a few examples.
Example 4.12
Computing the Future Value in Excel
Problem
Suppose you plan to invest $20,000 in an account paying 8% interest. How much will you have 
in the account in 15 years?
Solution
We represent this problem with the following timeline:
To compute the solution, we enter the four variables we know (NPER = 15, RATE = 8%,
PV = -20,000, PMT = 0) and solve for the one we want to determine (FV ) using the Excel 
function FV(RATE, NPER, PMT, PV ). The spreadsheet here calculates a future value of $63,443.
Note that we entered PV as a negative number (the amount we are putting into the bank), 
and FV is shown as a positive number (the amount we can take out of the bank). It is important 
to use signs correctly to indicate the direction in which the money is flowing when using the 
spreadsheet functions.
To check the result, we can solve this problem directly:

The Excel spreadsheet in Example  4.12, which is available from 
 or 
from www.berkdemarzo.com, is set up to allow you to compute any one of the five 
variables. We refer to this spreadsheet as the annuity spreadsheet. You simply enter the 
four input variables on the top line and leave the variable you want to compute blank. 
The spreadsheet computes the fifth variable and displays the answer on the bottom 
line. The spreadsheet also displays the Excel function that is used to get the answers. 
Let’s work through a more complicated example that illustrates the convenience of the 
annuity spreadsheet.
Example 4.13
Using the Annuity Spreadsheet
Problem
Suppose that you invest $20,000 in an account paying 8% interest. You plan to withdraw 
$2000 at the end of each year for 15 years. How much money will be left in the account after 
15 years?
Solution
Again, we start with the timeline showing our initial deposit and subsequent withdrawals:
Note that PV is negative (money into the bank), while PMT is positive (money out of the bank). 
We solve for the final balance in the account, FV, using the annuity spreadsheet:
We will have $9139 left in the bank after 15 years.
We can also compute this solution directly. One approach is to think of the deposit and the 
withdrawals as being separate accounts. In the account with the $20,000 deposit, our savings 
will grow to $63,443 in 15 years, as we computed in Example 4.12. Using the formula for the 
future value of an annuity, if we borrow $2000 per year for 15 years at 8%, at the end our debt 
will have grown to
$2000 *
1
0.08
 (1.0815 - 1) = $54,304
After paying off our debt, we will have $63,443 - $54,304 = $9139 remaining after 15 years.

4.7	 Non-Annual Cash Flows
Until now, we have only considered cash flow streams that occur at annual intervals. Do 
the same tools apply if the cash flows occur at another interval, say monthly? The answer 
is yes: Everything we have learned about annual cash flow streams applies to monthly cash 
flow streams so long as:
	
1.	 The interest rate is specified as a monthly rate.
	
2.	 The number of periods is expressed in months.
For example, suppose you have a credit card that charges 2% interest per month. If you 
have a $1000 balance on the card today, and make no payments for six months, your 
future balance after six months will be
FV = C * (1 + r)n = $1000 * (1.02)6 = $1126.16
We apply the future value formula exactly as before, but with r equal to the monthly interest 
rate and n equal to the number of months.
The same logic applies to annuities, as in the following example.
Example 4.14
Evaluating an Annuity with Monthly Cash Flows
Problem
You are about to purchase a new car and have two options to pay for it. You can pay $20,000 in 
cash immediately, or you can get a loan that requires you to pay $500 each month for the next 
48 months (four years). If the monthly interest rate you earn on your cash is 0.5%, which option 
should you take?
Solution
Let’s start by writing down the timeline of the loan payments:
The timeline shows that the loan is a 48-period annuity. Using the annuity formula the present 
value is

Thus, taking the loan is equivalent to paying $21,290 today, which is costlier than paying cash. 
You should pay cash for the car.

4.8	 Solving for the Cash Payments
So far, we have calculated the present value or future value of a stream of cash flows. 
Sometimes, however, we know the present value or future value, but do not know the 
cash flows. The best example is a loan—you know how much you want to borrow (the 
present value) and you know the interest rate, but you do not know how much you need 
to repay each year. Suppose you are opening a business that requires an initial investment 
of $100,000. Your bank manager has agreed to lend you this money. The terms of the 
loan state that you will make equal annual payments for the next 10 years and will pay an 
interest rate of 8% with the first payment due one year from today. What is your annual 
payment?

The bank will give you $100,000 today in exchange for 10 equal payments over the next 
decade. You need to determine the size of the payment C that the bank will require. For 
the bank to be willing to lend you $100,000, the loan cash flows must have a present value 
of $100,000 when evaluated at the bank’s interest rate of 8%. That is,
100,000 = PV (10@year annuity of C per year, evaluated at the loan rate)

You will be required to make 10 annual payments of $14,903 in exchange for $100,000 
today.
We can also solve this problem with the annuity spreadsheet:
In general, when solving for a loan payment, think of the amount borrowed (the loan 
principal) as the present value of the payments when evaluated at the loan rate. If the pay-
ments of the loan are an annuity, we can solve for the payment of the loan by inverting the 
annuity formula. Writing this procedure formally, we begin with the timeline (from the

payment of the equivalent value perpetuity, which makes sense because the annuity will

Computing a Loan Payment
Problem
Your biotech firm plans to buy a new DNA sequencer for $500,000. The seller requires that you 
pay 20% of the purchase price as a down payment, but is willing to finance the remainder by 
offering a 48-month loan with equal monthly payments and an interest rate of 0.5% per month. 
What is the monthly loan payment?
Solution
Given a down payment of 20% * $500,000 = $100,000, your loan amount is $400,000. We 
start with the timeline (from the seller’s perspective), where each period represents one month:
Using Eq. 4.14, we can solve for the loan payment, C, as follows:

We can use this same idea to solve for the cash flows when we know the future value 
rather than the present value. As an example, suppose you have just had a child. You decide 
to be prudent and start saving this year for her college education. You would like to have 
$60,000 saved by the time your daughter is 18 years old. If you can earn 7% per year on 
your savings, how much do you need to save each year to meet your goal?
The timeline for this example is
That is, you plan to save some amount C per year, and then withdraw $60,000 from 
the bank in 18 years. Therefore, we need to find the annuity payment that has a future 
value of $60,000 in 18 years. Using the formula for the future value of an annuity from 
Eq. 4.10,
60,000 = FV(annuity) = C *
1
0.07
 (1.0718 - 1) = C * 34
Therefore, C = 60,000
34
= $1765. So you need to save $1765 per year. If you do, then at a 
7% interest rate, your savings will grow to $60,000 by the time your child is 18 years old.
Now let’s solve this problem with the annuity spreadsheet:
Once again, we find that we need to save $1765 for 18 years to accumulate $60,000.

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
	
4.9	 The Internal Rate of Return
In some situations, you know the present value and cash flows of an investment opportu-
nity but you do not know the interest rate that equates them. This interest rate is called the 
internal rate of return (IRR), defined as the interest rate that sets the net present value of 
the cash flows equal to zero.
For example, suppose that you have an investment opportunity that requires a $1000 
investment today and will have a $2000 payoff in six years. On a timeline,
Example 4.16
Computing the IRR for a Perpetuity
Problem
Jessica has just graduated with her MBA. Rather than take the job she was offered at a ­prestigious 
investment bank—Baker, Bellingham, and Botts—she has decided to go into business for ­herself. 
She believes that her business will require an initial investment of $1 million. After that, it will 
generate a cash flow of $100,000 at the end of one year, and this amount will grow by 4% per 
year thereafter. What is the IRR of this investment opportunity?
One way to analyze this investment is to ask the question: What interest rate, r, would you 
need so that the NPV of this investment is zero?
NPV = -1000 +
2000
(1 + r)6 = 0
Rearranging gives
1000 * (1 + r)6 = 2000
That is, r is the interest rate you would need to earn on your $1000 to have a future value 
of $2000 in six years. We can solve for r as follows:
1 + r = ¢2000
1000 ≤
1/6
= 1.1225
or r = 12.25%. This rate is the IRR of this investment opportunity. Making this invest-
ment is like earning 12.25% per year on your money for six years.
When there are just two cash flows, as in the preceding example, it is easy to compute 
the IRR. Consider the general case in which you invest an amount P today, and receive FV 
in N years. Then the IRR satisfies the equation P * (1 + IRR)N = FV, which implies
	
IRR with two cash flows = (FV/P)1/N - 1
(4.15)
Note in the formula that we take the total return of the investment over N years, FV/P, 
and convert it to an equivalent one-year return by raising it to the power 1/N. Because we 
are just comparing two cashflows, the IRR calculation in Equation 4.15 is equivalent to 
computing the compound annual growth rate (or CAGR) of the cash flow.
Another case for which the IRR is easy to calculate is a perpetuity, as we demonstrate in 
the next example.

The timeline is
The timeline shows that the future cash flows are a growing perpetuity with a growth rate of 4%. 
Recall from Eq. 4.11 that the PV of a growing perpetuity is C/(r - g). Thus, the NPV of this 
investment would equal zero if
1,000,000 = 100,000
r - 0.04
We can solve this equation for r
r = 100,000
1,000,000 + 0.04 = 0.14
So, the IRR on this investment is 14%.

More generally, if we invest P and receive a perpetuity with initial cash flow C and 
growth rate g, we can use the growing perpetuity formula to determine
	
IRR of growing perpetuity = (C/P ) + g
(4.16)
Now let’s consider a more sophisticated example. Suppose your firm needs to purchase 
a new forklift. The dealer gives you two options: (1) a price for the forklift if you pay cash 
and (2) the annual payments if you take out a loan from the dealer. To evaluate the loan 
that the dealer is offering you, you will want to compare the rate on the loan with the rate 
that your bank is willing to offer you. Given the loan payment that the dealer quotes, how 
do you compute the interest rate charged by the dealer?
In this case, we need to compute the IRR of the dealer’s loan. Suppose the cash price 
of the forklift is $40,000, and the dealer offers financing with no down payment and four 
annual payments of $15,000. This loan has the following timeline:
From the timeline it is clear that the loan is a four-year annuity with a payment of $15,000 
per year and a present value of $40,000. Setting the NPV of the cash flows equal to zero 
requires that the present value of the payments equals the purchase price:
40,000 = 15,000 * 1

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
The value of r that solves this equation, the IRR, is the interest rate charged on the loan. 
Unfortunately, in this case, there is no simple way to solve for the interest rate r.8 The only 
way to solve this equation is to guess values of r until you find the right one.
Start by guessing r = 10%. In this case, the value of the annuity is
15,000 *
1
0.10
 ¢1 -
1
(1.10)4≤= 47,548
The present value of the payments is too large. To lower it, we need to use a higher interest 
rate. We guess 20% this time:
15,000 *
1
0.20
 ¢1 -
1
(1.20)4≤= 38,831
Now the present value of the payments is too low, so we must pick a rate between 10% and 
20%. We continue to guess until we find the right rate. Let us try 18.45%:
15,000 *
1
0.1845
 ¢1 -
1
(1.1845)4≤= 40,000
The interest rate charged by the dealer is 18.45%.
An easier solution than guessing the IRR and manually calculating values is to use a 
spreadsheet or calculator to automate the guessing process. When the cash flows are an 
annuity, as in this example, we can use the annuity spreadsheet in Excel to compute the 
IRR. Recall that the annuity spreadsheet solves Eq. 4.13. It ensures that the NPV of invest-
ing in the annuity is zero. When the unknown variable is the interest rate, it will solve for 
the interest rate that sets the NPV equal to zero—that is, the IRR. For this case,
8With five or more periods and general cash flows, there is no general formula to solve for r ; trial and error 
(by hand or computer) is the only way to compute the IRR.

In this chapter, we developed the tools a financial manager needs to apply the NPV rule 
when cash flows occur at different points in time. As we have seen, the interest rate we use 
to discount or compound the cash flows is a critical input to any of our present or future 
value calculations. Throughout the chapter, we have taken the interest rate as given. What 
determines the interest rate that we should use when discounting cash flows? The Law of 
One Price implies that we must rely on market information to assess the value of cash flows 
across time. In Chapter 5, we learn the drivers of market interest rates as well as how they 
are quoted. Understanding interest rate quoting conventions will also allow us to extend 
the tools we developed in this chapter to situations where the cash flows are paid, and inter-
est is compounded, more than once per year.

USING EXCEL 
Excel also has a built-in function, IRR, that will calculate the IRR of a stream of cash flows. 
Excel’s IRR function has the format, IRR (values, guess), where “values” is the range containing 
the cash flows, and “guess” is an optional starting guess where Excel begins its search for an IRR. 
See the example below:
There are three things to note about the IRR function. First, the values given to the IRR func-
tion should include all of the cash flows of the project, including the one at date 0. In this 
sense, the IRR and NPV functions in Excel are inconsistent. Second, like the NPV function, the 
IRR ignores the period associated with any blank cells. Finally, as we will discuss in Chapter 7, 
in some settings the IRR function may fail to find a solution, or may give a different answer, 
depending on the initial guess.

The earliest known published work that introduces the ideas in this chapter was in 1202 by the 
famous Italian mathematician Fibonacci (or Leonardo of Pisa) in Liber Abaci (recently translated 
into English by Laurence Sigler, Fibonacci’s Liber Abaci, A Translation into Modern English of Leon-
ardo Pisano’s Book of Calculation, Springer-Verlag, 2002). In this book, Fibonacci provides examples 
demonstrating the rules of time travel for cash flows.

*21.	 When you purchased your house, you took out a 30-year annual-payment mortgage with an 
interest rate of 9% per year. The annual payment on the mortgage is $9422. You have just 
made a payment and have now decided to pay the mortgage off by repaying the outstanding 
balance. What is the payoff amount if
a.	 You have lived in the house for 13 years (so there are 17 years left on the mortgage)?
b.	 You have lived in the house for 25 years (so there are 5 years left on the mortgage)?
c.	 You have lived in the house for 13 years (so there are 17 years left on the mortgage) and you 
decide to pay off the mortgage immediately before the thirteenth payment is due?
	
22.	 You are 23 years old and decide to start saving for your retirement. You plan to save $5500 
at the end of each year (so the first deposit will be one year from now), and will make the last 
deposit when you retire at age 65. Suppose you earn 10% per year on your retirement savings.
a.	 How much will you have saved for retirement?
b.	 How much will you have saved if you wait until age 39 to start saving (again, with your first 
deposit at the end of the year)?
	
23.	 Your grandmother has been putting $2000 into a savings account on every birthday since your 
first (that is, when you turned one). The account pays an interest rate of 4%. How much money 
will be in the account on your eighteenth birthday immediately after your grandmother makes 
the deposit on that birthday?
	
24.	 A rich relative has bequeathed you a growing perpetuity. The first payment will occur in one 
year and will be $2000. Each year after that, on the anniversary of the last payment you will 
receive a payment that is 8% larger than the last payment. This pattern of payments will go on 
forever. If the interest rate is 15% per year,
a.	 What is today’s value of the bequest?
b.	 What is the value of the bequest immediately after the first payment is made?
	
*25.	 You are thinking of building a new machine that will save you $4000 in the first year. The 
machine will then begin to wear out so that the savings decline at a rate of 4% per year forever. 
What is the present value of the savings if the interest rate is 10% per year?

26.	 You work for a pharmaceutical company that has developed a new drug. The patent on the drug 
will last 17 years. You expect that the drug’s profits will be $4 million in its first year and that this 
amount will grow at a rate of 6% per year for the next 17 years. Once the patent expires, other 
pharmaceutical companies will be able to produce the same drug and competition will likely drive 
profits to zero. What is the present value of the new drug if the interest rate is 8% per year?
	
27.	 Your oldest daughter is about to start kindergarten at a private school. Tuition is $30,000 per 
year, payable at the beginning of the school year. You expect to keep your daughter in private 
school through high school. You expect tuition to increase at a rate of 3% per year over the 
13 years of her schooling. What is the present value of the tuition payments if the interest rate is 
3% per year? How much would you need to have in the bank now to fund all 13 years of tuition?
	
28.	 A rich aunt has promised you $2000 one year from today. In addition, each year after that, 
she has promised you a payment (on the anniversary of the last payment) that is 7% larger 
than the last payment. She will continue to show this generosity for 20 years, giving a total of 
20 payments. If the interest rate is 7%, what is her promise worth today?
	
29.	 You are running a hot Internet company. Analysts predict that its earnings will grow at 40% 
per year for the next five years. After that, as competition increases, earnings growth is expected 
to slow to 3% per year and continue at that level forever. Your company has just announced 
earnings of $5 million. What is the present value of all future earnings if the interest rate is 7%? 
(Assume all cash flows occur at the end of the year.)
	
*30.	 Ten years ago Diana Torres wrote what has become the leading Tort textbook. She has been 
receiving royalties based on revenues reported by the publisher. These revenues started 
at $1 million in the first year, and grew steadily by 5% per year. Her royalty rate is 15% of 
revenue. Recently, she hired an auditor who discovered that the publisher had been underre-
porting ­revenues. The book had actually earned 10% more in revenues than had been reported 
on her royalty statements.
a.	 Assuming the publisher pays an interest rate of 4% on missed payments, how much money 
does the publisher owe Diana?
b.	 The publisher is short of cash, so instead of paying Diana what is owed, the publisher is 
offering to increase her royalty rate on future book sales. Assume the book will generate rev-
enues for an additional 20 years and that the current revenue growth will continue. If Diana 
would otherwise put the money into a bank account paying interest of 3%, what royalty 
rate would make her indifferent between accepting an increase in the future royalty rate and 
receiving the cash owed today.
	
*31.	 Your brother has offered to give you $100, starting next year, and after that growing at 3% for 
the next 20 years. You would like to calculate the value of this offer by calculating how much 
money you would need to deposit in the local bank so that the account will generate the same 
cash flows as he is offering you. Your local bank will guarantee a 6% annual interest rate so long 
as you have money in the account.
a.	 How much money will you need to deposit into the account today?
b.	 Using an Excel spreadsheet, show explicitly that you can deposit this amount of money into 
the account, and every year withdraw what your brother has promised, leaving the account 
with nothing after the last withdrawal.
Non-Annual Cash Flows
	
32.	 Suppose you currently have $4800 in your savings account, and your bank pays interest at a 
rate of 0.5% per month. If you make no further deposits or withdrawals, how much will you 
have in the account in four years?
	
33.	 Your firm spends $4,700 every month on printing and mailing costs, sending statements to 
customers. If the interest rate is 0.48% per month, what is the present value of eliminating this 
cost by sending the statements electronically?

	
34.	 You have just entered an MBA program and have decided to pay for your living expenses using 
a credit card that has no minimum monthly payment. You intend to charge $1090 per month 
on the card for the next 21 months. The card carries a monthly interest rate of 1.09%. How 
much money will you owe on the card 22 months from now, when you receive your first state-
ment post-graduation?
	
*35.	 Your credit card charges an interest rate of 1.98% per month. You have a current balance of 
$1120, and want to pay it off. Suppose you can afford to pay $85 per month. What will your 
balance be at the end of one year?
Solving for the Cash Payments
	
36.	 You have decided to buy a perpetuity. The bond makes one payment at the end of every year 
forever and has an interest rate of 4%. If you initially put $5000 into the bond, what is the 
­payment every year?
	
37.	 You are thinking of purchasing a house. The house costs $250,000. You have $36,000 in cash 
that you can use as a down payment on the house, but you need to borrow the rest of the 
purchase price. The bank is offering a 30-year mortgage that requires annual payments and 
has an interest rate of 5% per year. What will your annual payment be if you sign up for this 
mortgage?
	
*38.	 You would like to buy the house and take the mortgage described in Problem 37. You can 
afford to pay only $23,500 per year. The bank agrees to allow you to pay this amount each year, 
yet still borrow $300,000. At the end of the mortgage (in 30 years), you must make a balloon 
payment; that is, you must repay the remaining balance on the mortgage. How much will this 
balloon payment be?
	
39.	 You have just made an offer on a new home and are seeking a mortgage. You need to borrow 
$600,000.
a.	 The bank offers a 30-year mortgage with fixed monthly payments and an interest rate of 
0.5% per month. What is the amount of your monthly payment if you take this loan?
b.	 Alternatively, you can get a 15-year mortgage with fixed monthly payments and an interest 
rate of 0.4% per month. How much would your monthly payments be if you take this loan 
instead?
	
40.	 Suppose you take the 30-year mortgage described in Problem 39, part (a). How much will you 
still owe on the mortgage after 15 years?
	
*41.	 You are thinking about buying a piece of art that costs $30,000. The art dealer is proposing the 
following deal: He will lend you the money, and you will repay the loan by making the same 
payment every two years for the next 30 years (i.e., a total of 15 payments). If the interest rate 
is 9% per year, how much will you have to pay every two years?
	
42.	 You are saving for retirement. To live comfortably, you decide you will need to save $1 million 
by the time you are 65. Today is your 23rd birthday, and you decide, starting today and con-
tinuing on every birthday up to and including your 65th birthday, that you will put the same 
amount into a savings account. If the interest rate is 5%, how much must you set aside each 
year to make sure that you will have $1 million in the account on your 65th birthday?
	
*43.	 You realize that the plan in Problem 42 has a flaw. Because your income will increase over your 
lifetime, it would be more realistic to save less now and more later. Instead of putting the same 
amount aside each year, you decide to let the amount that you set aside grow by 3% per year. 
Under this plan, how much will you put into the account today? (Recall that you are planning 
to make the first contribution to the account today.)
	
*44.	 You are 39 years old, and decide to save $7500 each year (with the first deposit one year from 
now), in an account paying 9% interest per year. You will make your last deposit 26 years 
from now when you retire at age 65. During retirement, you plan to withdraw funds from the

171
account at the end of each year (so your first withdrawal is at age 66). What constant amount 
will you be able to withdraw each year if you want the funds to last until you are 85?
	
*45.	 You have just turned 30 years old, have just received your MBA, and have accepted your first 
job. Now you must decide how much money to put into your retirement plan. The plan works 
as follows: Every dollar in the plan earns 7% per year. You cannot make withdrawals until you 
retire on your 70th birthday. After that point, you can make withdrawals as you see fit. You 
decide that you will plan to live to 100 and work until you turn 70. You estimate that to live 
comfortably in retirement, you will need $90,000 per year starting at the end of the first year 
of retirement and ending on your 100th birthday. You will contribute the same amount to the 
plan at the end of every year that you work. How much do you need to contribute each year to 
fund your retirement?
	
*46.	 Problem 45 is not very realistic because most retirement plans do not allow you to specify a 
fixed amount to contribute every year. Instead, you are required to specify a fixed percentage 
of your salary that you want to contribute. Assume that your starting salary is $75,000 per year 
and it will grow 2% per year until you retire. Assuming everything else stays the same as in 
Problem 45, what percentage of your income do you need to contribute to the plan every year 
to fund the same retirement income
The Internal Rate of Return
	
47.	 You have an investment opportunity that requires an initial investment of $9500 today and will 
pay $10,500 in one year. What is the IRR of this opportunity?
	
48.	 Suppose you invest $3500 today and receive $9500 in five years.
a.	 What is the IRR of this opportunity?
b.	 Suppose another investment opportunity also requires $3500 upfront, but pays an equal 
amount at the end of each year for the next five years. If this investment has the same IRR 
as the first one, what is the mount you will receive each year?
	
49.	 You are shopping for a car and read the following advertisement in the newspaper: “Own a new 
Spitfire! No money down. Four annual payments of just $18,000.” You have shopped around 
and know that you can buy a Spitfire for cash for $61,200. What is the interest rate the dealer is 
advertising (what is the IRR of the loan in the advertisement)? Assume that you must make the 
annual payments at the end of each year.
	
50.	 A local bank is running the following advertisement in the newspaper: “For just $4000 we will 
pay you $280 forever!” The fine print in the ad says that for a $4000 deposit, the bank will pay 
$280 every year in perpetuity, starting one year after the deposit is made. What interest rate is 
the bank advertising (what is the IRR of this investment)?
	
51.	 You are considering purchasing a warehouse. The cost to purchase the warehouse is $492,000. 
Renting the equivalent space costs $19,700 per year. If the annual interest rate is 5.6%, 
at what rate must rental cost increase each year to make the cost of renting comparable to 
purchasing?
	
*52.	 The Tillamook County Creamery Association manufactures Tillamook Cheddar Cheese. It 
markets this cheese in four varieties: aged 2 months, 9 months, 15 months, and 2 years. At 
the shop in the dairy, it sells 2 pounds of each variety for the following prices: $7.50, $9.50, 
$11.50, and $12.50, respectively. Consider the cheese maker’s decision whether to continue to 
age a particular 2-pound block of cheese. At 2 months, he can either sell the cheese immediately 
or let it age further. If he sells it now, he will receive $7.50 immediately. If he ages the cheese, 
he must give up the $7.50 today to receive a higher amount in the future. What is the IRR 
(expressed in percent per month) of the investment of giving up $75.00 today by choosing to 
store 20 pounds of cheese that is currently 2 months old and instead selling 10 pounds of this 
cheese when it has aged 9 months, 6 pounds when it has aged 15 months, and the remaining  
4 pounds when it has aged 2 years?

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
Assume today is March 16, 2016. Natasha Kingery is 30 years old and has a Bachelor of Science 
degree in computer science. She is currently employed as a Tier 2 field service representative for a tele-
phony corporation located in Seattle, Washington, and earns $38,000 a year that she anticipates will 
grow at 3% per year. Natasha hopes to retire at age 65 and has just begun to think about the future.
Natasha has $75,000 that she recently inherited from her aunt. She invested this money in 
30-year Treasury Bonds. She is considering whether she should further her education and would use 
her inheritance to pay for it.9
She has investigated a couple of options and is asking for your help as a financial planning intern 
to determine the financial consequences associated with each option. Natasha has already been 
accepted to both of these programs, and could start either one soon.
One alternative that Natasha is considering is attaining a certification in network design. This 
certification would automatically promote her to a Tier 3 field service representative in her com-
pany. The base salary for a Tier 3 representative is $10,000 more than what she currently earns 
and she anticipates that this salary differential will grow at a rate of 3% a year as long as she keeps 
working. The certification program requires the completion of 20 Web-based courses and a score of 
80% or better on an exam at the end of the course work. She has learned that the average amount of 
time necessary to finish the program is one year. The total cost of the program is $5000, due when 
she enrolls in the program. Because she will do all the work for the certification on her own time, 
­Natasha does not expect to lose any income during the certification.
Another option is going back to school for an MBA degree. With an MBA degree, Natasha 
expects to be promoted to a managerial position in her current firm. The managerial position pays 
$20,000 a year more than her current position. She expects that this salary differential will also grow 
at a rate of 3% per year for as long as she keeps working. The evening program, which will take three 
years to complete, costs $25,000 per year, due at the beginning of each of her three years in school. 
Because she will attend classes in the evening, Natasha doesn’t expect to lose any income while she is 
earning her MBA if she chooses to undertake the MBA.
	
1.	 Determine the interest rate she is currently earning on her inheritance by going to Yahoo! Finance 
(finance.yahoo.com) and typing the word “Treasury” in the search field and picking the 30 year yield 
(ticker: ^TYX) off the dynamic menu that appears. Then go to “Historical Prices” (located in the left 
column) and enter the appropriate date, March 16, 2016 to obtain the closing yield or interest rate 
that she is earning. Use this interest rate as the discount rate for the remainder of this problem.
	
2.	 Create a timeline in Excel for her current situation, as well as the certification program and MBA 
degree options, using the following assumptions:
	
n    Salaries for the year are paid only once, at the end of the year.
	
n    The salary increase becomes effective immediately upon graduating from the MBA program 
or being certified. That is, because the increases become effective immediately but salaries are 
paid at the end of the year, the first salary increase will be paid exactly one year after gradua-
tion or certification.
	
3.	 Calculate the present value of the salary differential for completing the certification program. 
Subtract the cost of the program to get the NPV of undertaking the certification program.
	
4.	 Calculate the present value of the salary differential for completing the MBA degree. Calculate 
the present value of the cost of the MBA program. Based on your calculations, determine the 
NPV of undertaking the MBA.
	
5.	 Based on your answers to Questions 3 and 4, what advice would you give to Natasha? What if the 
two programs are mutually exclusive? That is, if Natasha undertakes one of the programs there is 
no further benefit to undertaking the other program. Would your advice be different?
	
Note: Updates to this data case may be found at www.berkdemarzo.com.
9If Natasha lacked the cash to pay for her tuition up front, she could borrow the money. More intrigu-
ingly, she could sell a fraction of her future earnings, an idea that has received attention from researchers 
and entrepreneurs; see M. Palacios, Investing in Human Capital: A Capital Markets Approach to Student 
Funding, Cambridge University Press, 2004.
Data Case

We want to determine N.
In terms of our formulas, we need to find N so that the future value of our investment 
equals $20,000:
	
FV = $10,000 * 1.10N = $20,000
(4A.1)
One approach is to use trial and error to find N, as with the IRR. For example, with 
N = 7 years, FV = $19,487, so it will take longer than seven years. With N = 8 years, 
FV = $21,436, so it will take between seven and eight years. Alternatively, this problem 
can be solved on the annuity spreadsheet. In this case, we solve for N:
In addition to solving for cash flows or the interest rate, we can solve for the amount of 
time it will take a sum of money to grow to a known value. In this case, the interest rate, 
present value, and future value are all known. We need to compute how long it will take 
for the present value to grow to the future value.
Suppose we invest $10,000 in an account paying 10% interest, and we want to know 
how long it will take for the amount to grow to $20,000.

It will take about 7.3 years for our savings to grow to $20,000.
Finally, this problem can be solved mathematically. Dividing both sides of Eq. 4A.1 by 
$10,000, we have
1.10N = 20,000/10,000 = 2
To solve for an exponent, we take the logarithm of both sides, and use the fact that 
ln (xy) = y ln(x):

Problem
You are saving for a down payment on a house. You have $10,050 saved already, and you can 
afford to save an additional $5000 per year at the end of each year. If you earn 7.25% per year on 
your savings, how long will it take you to save $60,000?

Chapter 4  The Time Value of Money 
Solution
The timeline for this problem is
We need to find N so that the future value of our current savings plus the future value of our 
planned additional savings (which is an annuity) equals our desired amount:
10,050 * 1.0725N + 5000 *
1
0.0725
 (1.0725N - 1) = 60,000
To solve mathematically, rearrange the equation to
1.0725N = 60,000 * 0.0725 + 5000
10,050 * 0.0725 + 5000 = 1.632
We can then solve for N:
N = ln(1.632)
ln(1.0725) = 7.0 years
It will take seven years to save the down payment. We can also solve this problem using the annu-

*A.1.	Your grandmother bought an annuity from Rock Solid Life Insurance Company for $200,000 
when she retired. In exchange for the $200,000, Rock Solid will pay her $25,000 per year until 
she dies. The interest rate is 5%. How long must she live after the day she retired to come out 
ahead (that is, to get more in value than what she paid in)?
	
*A.2.	You are thinking of making an investment in a new plant. The plant will generate revenues 
of $1 million per year for as long as you maintain it. You expect that the maintenance cost 
will start at $50,000 per year and will increase 5% per year thereafter. Assume that all revenue 
and maintenance costs occur at the end of the year. You intend to run the plant as long as it 
continues to make a positive cash flow (as long as the cash generated by the plant exceeds the 
maintenance costs). The plant can be built and become operational immediately. If the plant 
costs $10 million to build, and the interest rate is 6% per year, should you invest in the plant?
Problems

Interest rates
in chApter 4, We eXpLOreD the MechAnics Of ­cOMputinG 
present values and future values given a market interest rate. But how do we deter-
mine that interest rate? In practice, interest is paid and interest rates are quoted in 
different ways. For example, in mid-2012, ­Metropolitan National Bank offered sav-
ings accounts with an interest rate of 1.65% paid at the end of each year, while 
AIG Bank offered an annual interest rate of only 1.60%, but paid on a daily basis. 
Interest rates can also differ depending on the investment horizon. In July 2015, 
investors earned around 0.25% on one-year risk-free U.S. Treasury Bills, but could 
earn more than 2.9% on twenty-year Treasuries. Interest rates can also vary due  
to risk or tax consequences: The U.S. government is able to borrow at a lower interest 
rate than Johnson & Johnson, which in turn can borrow at a lower rate than American 
Airlines.
In this chapter, we consider the factors that affect interest rates and discuss how 
to determine the appropriate discount rate for a set of cash flows. We begin by looking 
at the way interest is paid and interest rates are quoted, and we show how to calculate 
the effective interest paid in one year given different quoting conventions. We then 
consider some of the main determinants of interest rates—namely, inflation and gov-
ernment policy. Because interest rates tend to change over time, investors will demand 
different interest rates for different investment horizons based on their expectations. 
Finally, we examine the role of risk in determining interest rates and show how to adjust 
interest rates to determine the effective amount received (or paid) after accounting for 
taxes.

Chapter 5  Interest Rates
	
5.1	 Interest Rate Quotes and Adjustments
Interest rates are quoted in a variety of ways. While generally stated as an annual rate, the 
interest payments themselves may occur at different intervals, such as monthly or semian-
nually. When evaluating cash flows, however, we must use a discount rate that matches the 
time period of our cash flows; this discount rate should reflect the actual return we could 
earn over that time period. In this section, we explore the mechanics of interpreting and 
adjusting the interest rate to determine the correct discount rate.
The Effective Annual Rate
Interest rates are often stated as an effective annual rate (EAR), which indicates the actual 
amount of interest that will be earned at the end of one year.1 This method of quoting the 
interest rate is the one we have used thus far in this textbook: in Chapter 4, we used the 
EAR as the discount rate r in our time value of money calculations. For example, with an 
EAR of 5%, a $100,000 investment grows to
$100,000 * (1 + r) = $100,000 * (1.05) = $105,000
in one year. After two years it will grow to
$100,000 * (1 + r)2 = $100,000 * (1.05)2 = $110,250
Adjusting the Discount Rate to Different Time Periods.  The preceding example shows 
that earning an effective annual rate of 5% for two years is equivalent to earning 10.25% 
in total interest over the entire period:
$100,000 * (1.05)2 = $100,000 * 1.1025 = $110,250
In general, by raising the interest rate factor (1 + r) to the appropriate power, we can com-
pute an equivalent interest rate for a longer time period.
We can use the same method to find the equivalent interest rate for periods shorter than 
one year. In this case, we raise the interest rate factor (1 + r) to the appropriate fractional 
power. For example, earning 5% interest in one year is equivalent to receiving
(1 + r)1/2 = (1.05)1/2 = $1.0247
for each $1 invested every half year, or equivalently, every six months. That is, a 5% effec-
tive annual rate is equivalent to an interest rate of approximately 2.47% earned every six 
months. We can verify this result by computing the interest we would earn in one year by 
investing for two six-month periods at this rate:

General Equation for Discount Rate Period Conversion.  In general, we can convert a 
discount rate of r for one period to an equivalent discount rate for n periods using the fol-
lowing formula:
	
Equivalent n@Period Discount Rate = (1 + r)n - 1
(5.1)
In this formula, n can be larger than 1 (to compute a rate over more than one period) 
or smaller than 1 (to compute a rate over a fraction of a period). When computing present 
1The effective annual rate is often referred to as the effective annual yield (EAY) or the annual percentage 
yield (APY).

or future values, it is convenient to adjust the discount rate to match the time period of 
the cash flows. This adjustment is necessary to apply the perpetuity or annuity formulas, as 
shown in Example 5.1.
Example 5.1
Valuing Monthly Cash Flows
Problem
Suppose your bank account pays interest monthly with the interest rate quoted as an effective 
annual rate (EAR) of 6%. What amount of interest will you earn each month? If you have no 
money in the bank today, how much will you need to save at the end of each month to accumu-
late $100,000 in 10 years?
Solution
From Eq. 5.1, a 6% EAR is equivalent to earning (1.06)1/12 - 1 = 0.4868% per month. We can 
write the timeline for our savings plan using monthly periods as follows:
That is, we can view the savings plan as a monthly annuity with 10 * 12 = 120 monthly pay-
ments. We can calculate the total amount saved as the future value of this annuity, using Eq. 4.10:
FV (annuity) = C * 1
r [(1 + r)n - 1]
We can solve for the monthly payment C using the equivalent monthly interest rate r = 0.4868%, 
and n = 120 months:
C =
FV (annuity)
1
r [(1 + r)n - 1] =
$100,000
1
0.004868 [(1.004868)120 - 1] = $615.47 per month
We can also compute this result using the annuity spreadsheet:
Thus, if we save $615.47 per month and we earn interest monthly at an effective annual rate of 
6%, we will have $100,000 in 10 years.

Using the Wrong Discount Rate in the Annuity Formula
The discount rate period must match the periodicity of the 
cash flows in the annuity formula. In Example 5.1, because 
the cash flows were monthly, we first must convert the EAR 
into a monthly discount rate. A common mistake in this 
case is to treat the annuity as a 10-year annual annuity with 
a discount rate equal to the EAR of 6%. Doing so, we get
C =
$100,000
1
0.06 [(1.06)10 - 1] = $7586.80
which is the amount you would need to invest per 
year, not per month. Note also that if we try to convert 
this to a monthly amount by dividing by 12, we get 
7586.80/12 = 632.23, a higher amount than we need 
according to Example 5.1. The reason we can save less 
is that by depositing the cash monthly rather than at the 
end of each year, we will earn interest on our deposits 
throughout the year.

Chapter 5  Interest Rates
Annual Percentage Rates
Banks also quote interest rates in terms of an annual percentage rate (APR), which indi-
cates the amount of simple interest earned in one year, that is, the amount of interest 
earned without the effect of compounding. Because it does not include the effect of com-
pounding, the APR quote is typically less than the actual amount of interest that you will 
earn. To compute the actual amount that you will earn in one year, we must first convert 
the APR to an effective annual rate.
For example, suppose Granite Bank advertises savings accounts with an interest rate of 
“6% APR with monthly compounding.” In this case, you will earn 6%/12 = 0.5% every 
month. So an APR with monthly compounding is actually a way of quoting a monthly 
interest rate, rather than an annual interest rate. Because the interest compounds each 
month, you will earn
$1 * (1.005)12 = $1.061678
at the end of one year, for an effective annual rate of 6.1678%. The 6.1678% that you earn 
on your deposit is higher than the quoted 6% APR due to compounding: In later months, 
you earn interest on the interest paid in earlier months.
It is important to remember that because the APR does not reflect the true amount you 
will earn over one year, we cannot use the APR itself as a discount rate. Instead, the APR with 
k compounding periods is a way of quoting the actual interest earned each compounding 
period:
Interest Rate per Compounding Period =
APR
k periods/year
(5.2)
Once we have computed the interest earned per compounding period from Eq. 5.2, we 
can compute the effective annual rate by compounding using Eq. 5.1. Thus the effective 
annual rate corresponding to an APR with k compounding periods per year is given by the 
following conversion formula:
Converting an APR to an EAR
1 + EAR = ¢1 + APR
k ≤
k

(5.3)
Table 5.1 shows the effective annual rates that correspond to an APR of 6% with differ-
ent compounding intervals. The EAR increases with the frequency of compounding because 
of the ability to earn interest on interest sooner. Investments can compound even more 
frequently than daily. In principle, the compounding interval could be hourly or every sec-
ond. In the limit we approach the idea of continuous compounding, in which we

compound the interest every instant.2 As a practical matter, compounding more ­frequently 
than daily has a negligible impact on the effective annual rate and is rarely observed.
Remember, when working with APRs we must
	
1.	 Divide the APR by the number of compounding periods per year to determine the 
actual interest rate per compounding period (Eq. 5.2).
Then, if the cash flows occur at a different interval than the compounding period,
	
2.	 Compute the appropriate discount rate by compounding (Eq. 5.1).
Once you have completed these steps, you can then use the discount rate to evaluate the 
present or future value of a set of cash flows.
2A 6% APR with continuous compounding results in an EAR of approximately 6.1837%, which is almost 
the same as daily compounding. See the appendix for further discussion of continuous compounding.
Example 5.2
Converting the APR to a Discount Rate
Problem
Your firm is purchasing a new telephone system, which will last for four years. You can purchase 
the system for an upfront cost of $150,000, or you can lease the system from the manufacturer for 
$4000 paid at the end of each month.3 Your firm can borrow at an interest rate of 5% APR with 
semiannual compounding. Should you purchase the system outright or pay $4000 per month?
Solution
The cost of leasing the system is a 48-month annuity of $4000 per month:
We can compute the present value of the lease cash flows using the annuity formula, but first 
we need to compute the discount rate that corresponds to a period length of one month. To do 
so, we convert the borrowing cost of 5% APR with semiannual compounding to a monthly dis-
count rate. Using Eq. 5.2, the APR corresponds to a six-month discount rate of 5%/2 = 2.5%. 
To convert a six-month discount rate into a one-month discount rate, we compound the six-
month rate by 1/6 using Eq. 5.1:
(1.025)1/6 - 1 = 0.4124% per month
(Alternatively, we could first use Eq. 5.3 to convert the APR to an EAR: 1 + EAR = (1 + 0.05/2)2 
= 1.050625. Then we can convert the EAR to a monthly rate using Eq. 5.1: (1.050625)1/12 - 1 
= 0.4124% per month.)
Given this discount rate, we can use the annuity formula (Eq. 4.9) to compute the present 
value of the 48 monthly payments:
PV = 4000 *

0.004124

purchase with a lease. We ignore these complications in this example, but will consider leases in detail 
in Chapter 25.

5.2	 Application: Discount Rates and Loans
Now that we have explained how to compute the discount rate from an interest rate quote, 
let’s apply the concept to solve two common financial problems: calculating a loan pay-
ment and calculating the remaining balance on a loan.
Computing Loan Payments.  To calculate a loan payment, we equate the outstanding 
loan balance with the present value of the loan payments using the discount rate from the 
quoted interest rate of the loan, and then solve for the loan payment.
Many loans, such as mortgages and car loans, are amortizing loans, which means that 
each month you pay interest on the loan plus some part of the loan balance. Usually, each 
monthly payment is the same, and the loan is fully repaid with the final payment. Typical 
terms for a new car loan might be “6.75% APR for 60 months.” When the compounding 
interval for the APR is not stated explicitly, it is equal to the interval between the pay-
ments, or one month in this case. Thus, this quote means that the loan will be repaid with 
60 equal monthly payments, computed using a 6.75% APR with monthly compounding. 
Consider the timeline for a $30,000 car loan with these terms:
Thus, paying $4000 per month for 48 months is equivalent to paying a present value of 
$173,867 today. This cost is $173,867 - $150,000 = $23,867 higher than the cost of ­purchasing 
the system, so it is better to pay $150,000 for the system rather than lease it. We can interpret 
this result as meaning that at a 5% APR with semiannual compounding, by promising to repay 
$4000 per month, your firm can borrow $173,867 today. With this loan it could ­purchase the 
phone system and have an additional $23,867 to use for other purposes.

The payment, C, is set so that the present value of the cash flows, evaluated using

6.75%/12 = 0.5625%. So, using the annuity formula to compute the present value of the 
loan payments, the payment C must satisfy

Computing the Outstanding Loan Balance
Problem
Two years ago your firm took out a 30-year amortizing loan to purchase a small office building. 
The loan has a 4.80% APR with monthly payments of $2623.33. How much do you owe on the 
loan today? How much interest did the firm pay on the loan in the past year?
Solution
After 2 years, the loan has 28 years, or 336 months, remaining:
The remaining balance on the loan is the present value of these remaining payments, using 
the loan rate of 4.8%/12 = 0.4% per month:
Balance after 2 years = $2623.33 *

During the past year, your firm made total payments of $2623.33 * 12 = $31,480 on the 
loan. To determine the amount that was interest, it is easiest to first determine the amount that 
was used to repay the principal. Your loan balance one year ago, with 29 years (348 months) 
remaining, was
Balance after 1 year = $2623.33 *

Therefore, the balance declined by $492,354 - $484,332 = $8022 in the past year. Of 
the total payments made, $8022 was used to repay the principal and the remaining $31,480 -
$8022 = $23,458 was used to pay interest.

5.3	 The Determinants of Interest Rates
How are interest rates determined? Fundamentally, interest rates are determined in the 
market based on individuals’ willingness to borrow and lend. In this section, we look at 
some of the factors that may influence interest rates, such as inflation, government policy, 
and expectations of future growth.

Chapter 5  Interest Rates
Teaser Rates and Subprime Loans
While the loan might have been affordable at the initial 
teaser rate, many subprime borrowers could not afford 
the higher payments that were required after the loan rate 
adjusted. Prior to 2007, while interest rates remained low 
and home prices were high (and increasing), such bor-
rowers were able to avoid default simply by refinancing 
their loans into new loans that also featured low initial 
teaser rates. In this way, they were able to keep their pay-
ments low. But as mortgage rates increased and housing 
prices began to decline in 2007, this strategy for keeping 
their loan payments low was no longer possible. In many 
cases the outstanding loan balance exceeded the market 
value of the home, making lenders unwilling to refinance 
the loans. Stuck with a loan at a now unaffordable inter-
est rate, many homeowners defaulted, and the rate of 
foreclosure on subprime loans skyrocketed.
To prevent future lenders from using teaser rates to get 
borrowers into loans they might not ultimately be able to 
afford, the Dodd-Frank Act requires lenders to verify that 
borrowers have sufficient income to repay their loans even 
after the teaser rate expires.
Some loans, such as adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), 
have interest rates that are not constant over the life of the 
loan. When the interest rate on such a loan changes, the 
loan payments are recalculated based on the loan’s current 
outstanding balance, the new interest rate, and the remain-
ing life of the loan.
Adjustable rate mortgages were the most common type of 
so-called “subprime” loans made to homebuyers with poor 
credit histories. These loans often featured low initial rates, 
aptly named teaser rates. After a short period (often 2 to 5 years) 
the interest rate would jump to a higher rate, implying that 
the monthly payment would also jump. For example, suppose 
the rate on the 30-year loan in ­Example 5.3 was a teaser rate, 
and that after 2 years the rate increased from 4.8% to 7.2%. 
Given the remaining balance after two years of $484,332, with 
the higher interest rate of 7.2%/12 = 0.6% per month, the 
monthly payment will increase from $2623.33 to

Global Financial Crisis
Inflation and Real Versus Nominal Rates
The interest rates that are quoted by banks and other financial institutions, and that we 
have used for discounting cash flows, are nominal interest rates, which indicate the rate 
at which your money will grow if invested for a certain period. Of course, if prices in the 
economy are also growing due to inflation, the nominal interest rate does not represent the 
increase in purchasing power that will result from investing. The rate of growth of your 
purchasing power, after adjusting for inflation, is determined by the real interest rate, 
which we denote by rr. If r is the nominal interest rate and i is the rate of inflation, we can 
calculate the rate of growth of purchasing power as follows:
Growth in Purchasing Power = 1 + rr = 1 + r
1 + i = Growth of Money
Growth of Prices 
(5.4)
We can rearrange Eq. 5.4 to find the following formula for the real interest rate, together 
with a convenient approximation for the real interest rate when inflation rates are low:
The Real Interest Rate
	
rr = r - i
1 + i  r - i
(5.5)
That is, the real interest rate is approximately equal to the nominal interest rate less the rate 
of inflation.4
4The real interest rate should not be used as a discount rate for future cash flows. It can only be used if the 
cash flows have been adjusted to remove the effect of inflation (in that case, we say the cash flows are in 
real terms). This approach is error prone, however, so throughout this book we will always forecast actual 
cash flows including any growth due to inflation, and discount using nominal interest rates.

Figure 5.1 shows the history of U.S. nominal interest rates and inflation rates since 
1960. Note that the nominal interest rate tends to move with inflation. Intuitively, indi-
viduals’ willingness to save will depend on the growth in purchasing power they can expect 
(given by the real interest rate). Thus, when the inflation rate is high, a higher nominal 
interest rate is generally needed to induce individuals to save. Note, however, that by his-
torical standards, the last few years have been somewhat exceptional: nominal interest rates 
have been extremely low, leading to negative real interest rates.
Investment and Interest Rate Policy
Interest rates also affect firms’ incentive to raise capital and invest. Consider a risk-free 
investment opportunity that requires an upfront investment of $10 million and generates

Example 5.4
Calculating the Real Interest Rate
Problem
At the start of 2011, one-year U.S. government bond rates were about 0.3%, while the rate of 
inflation that year was 3.0%. In May of 2014, one-year interest rates were about 0.1%, and 
inflation over the following year was around -0.05% (deflation). What was the real interest rate 
in 2011 and in May 2014?
Solution
Using Eq. 5.5, the real interest rate in 2011 was (0.3% - 3.0%)/(1.03) = -2.62%. In May 2014, 
the real interest rate was (0.1% + 0.05%)/(0.9995) = 0.15%. Note that the real interest rate was 
negative in 2011, indicating that interest rates were insufficient to keep up with inflation: Investors 
in U.S. government bonds were able to buy less at the end of the year than they could have pur-
chased at the start of the year. On the other hand, prices actually decreased (deflation) in the year 
following May 2014, and so the real interest rate earned slighly above the nominal interest rate.

and the investment is no longer profitable. The reason, of course, is that we are discount-
ing the positive cash flows at a higher rate, which reduces their present value. The cost of 
$10 million occurs today, however, so its present value is independent of the discount rate.
More generally, when the costs of an investment precede the benefits, an increase in 
the interest rate will decrease the investment’s NPV. All else equal, higher interest rates 
will therefore tend to shrink the set of positive-NPV investments available to firms. The 
Federal Reserve in the United States and central banks in other countries use this relation-
ship between interest rates and investment to try to guide the economy. They can raise 
interest rates to reduce investment if the economy is “overheating” and inflation is on the 
rise, and they can lower interest rates to stimulate investment if the economy is slowing or 
in recession.
Monetary Policy, Deflation, and the 2008 Financial Crisis.  When the 2008 financial 
crisis struck the economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve responded quickly to mitigate its 
impact on the broader economy by cutting its short-term interest rate target to 0% by 
year’s end. But while this use of monetary policy is generally quite effective, because con-
sumer prices were falling in late 2008, the inflation rate was negative, and so even with a 
0% nominal interest rate the real interest rate remained positive initially. The consequence 
of this deflation, and the risk that it might continue, meant that the Federal Reserve was 
“out of ammunition” with regard to its usual weapon against an economic slowdown—it 
could not lower rates further.5 This problem was one of the reasons the U.S. and other 
governments began to consider other measures, such as increased government spending 
and investment, to stimulate their economies. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin 
Warsh further discusses monetary policy responses to the economic crisis in both the U.S. 
and Europe in the interview box on page 188.
The Yield Curve and Discount Rates
You may have noticed that the interest rates that banks offer on investments or charge on 
loans depend on the horizon, or term, of the investment or loan. The relationship between 
the investment term and the interest rate is called the term structure of interest rates. We 
can plot this relationship on a graph called the yield curve. Figure 5.2 shows the term struc-
ture and corresponding yield curve of risk-free U.S. interest rates in November 2006, 2007, 
and 2008. In each case, note that the interest rate depends on the horizon, and that the dif-
ference between short-term and long-term interest rates was especially pronounced in 2008.
5Why couldn’t the Federal Reserve go further and make nominal interest rates negative? Since individuals 
can always hold cash (or put their money in a savings account) and earn at least a zero return, the nominal 
interest rate can never be significantly negative. But because storing cash is costly, and because investors 
viewed many banks as unsafe, short-term U.S. Treasury interest rates were actually slightly negative (down 
to -0.05%) at several points throughout this period! (See Chapter 6 for further discussion.)

We can use the term structure to compute the present and future values of a risk-free 
cash flow over different investment horizons. For example, $100 invested for one year at 
the one-year interest rate in November 2008 would grow to a future value of
$100 * 1.0091 = $100.91
at the end of one year, and $100 invested for ten years at the ten-year interest rate in 
November 2008 would grow to6
$100 * (1.0341)10 = $139.84
We can apply the same logic when computing the present value of cash flows with dif-
ferent maturities. A risk-free cash flow received in two years should be discounted at the 
two-year interest rate, and a cash flow received in ten years should be discounted at the ten-
year interest rate. In general, a risk-free cash flow of Cn received in n years has present value
	
PV =
Cn
(1 + rn)n
(5.6)
where rn is the risk-free interest rate (expressed as an EAR) for an n-year term. In other 
words, when computing a present value we must match the term of the cash flow and term 
of the discount rate.
Combining Eq. 5.6 for cash flows in different years leads to the general formula for the 
present value of a cash flow stream:

6We could also invest for 10 years by investing at the one-year interest rate for 10 years in a row. However, 
because we do not know what future interest rates will be, our ultimate payoff would not be risk free.

Chapter 5  Interest Rates
Note the difference between Eq. 5.7 and Eq. 4.4. Here, we use a different discount rate for 
each cash flow, based on the rate from the yield curve with the same term. When the yield 
curve is relatively flat, as it was in November 2006, this distinction is relatively minor and is 
often ignored by discounting using a single “average” interest rate r. But when short-term and 
long-term interest rates vary widely, as they did in November 2008, Eq. 5.7 should be used.
Warning : All of our shortcuts for computing present values (annuity and perpetuity for-
mulas, the annuity spreadsheet) are based on discounting all of the cash flows at the same rate. 
They cannot be used in situations in which cash flows need to be discounted at different rates.
Example 5.5
Using the Term Structure to Compute Present Values
Problem
Compute the present value in November 2008 of a risk-free five-year annuity of $1000 per year, 
given the yield curve for November 2008 in Figure 5.2.
Solution
To compute the present value, we discount each cash flow by the corresponding interest rate:
PV = 1000
1.0091 +
1000
1.00982 +
1000
1.01263 +
1000
1.01694 +
1000
1.02015 = $4775.25
Note that we cannot use the annuity formula here because the discount rates differ for each cash flow.
Using the Annuity Formula When Discount Rates Vary by Maturity
When computing the present value of an annuity, a com-
mon mistake is to use the annuity formula with a single 
interest rate even though interest rates vary with the invest-
ment horizon. For example, we cannot compute the present 
value of the five-year annuity in Example 5.5 using the five-
year interest rate from November 2008:
PV  $1000 *
1
0.0201
 ¢1 -
1
1.02015 ≤= $4712.09
To find the single interest rate that we could use to value 
the annuity, we must first compute the present value of 
the annuity using Eq. 5.7 and then solve for its IRR. 
For the annuity in Example  5.5, we use the annuity 
­spreadsheet below to find its IRR of 1.55%. The IRR 
of the annuity is always between the highest and lowest 
discount rates used to calculate its present value, as is the 
case in the example below.

The Yield Curve and the Economy
Figure 5.3 shows the gap between short-term and long-term interest rate historically. Note 
how sometimes, short-term rates are close to long-term rates, and at other times they may 
be very different. What accounts for the changing shape of the yield curve?
Interest Rate Determination.  The Federal Reserve determines very short-term interest 
rates through its influence on the federal funds rate, which is the rate at which banks can 
borrow cash reserves on an overnight basis. All other interest rates on the yield curve are 
set in the market and are adjusted until the supply of lending matches the demand for bor-
rowing at each loan term. As we will see, expectations of future interest rate changes have a 
major effect on investors’ willingness to lend or borrow for longer terms and, therefore, on 
the shape of the yield curve.

One-year and ten-year U.S. Treasury rates are plotted, with the spread between them shaded in blue if the shape of the yield 
curve is increasing (the one-year rate is below the ten-year rate) and in red if the yield curve is inverted (the one-year rate 
exceeds the ten-year rate). Gray bars show the dates of U.S. recessions as ­determined by the National Bureau of Economic 
Research. Note that inverted yield curves tend to precede ­recessions by 12–18 months. In recessions, interest rates tend to 
fall, with short-term rates dropping further. As a result, the yield curve tends to be steep coming out of a recession.

Interest Rate Expectations.  Suppose short-term interest rates are equal to long-term 
interest rates. If investors expect interest rates to rise in the future, they would not want to 
make long-term investments. Instead, they could do better by investing on a short-term 
basis and then reinvesting after interest rates rose. Thus, if interest rates are expected to rise, 
long-term interest rates will tend to be higher than short-term rates to attract investors.
Similarly, if interest rates are expected to fall in the future, then borrowers would not wish to 
borrow at long-term rates that are equal to short-term rates. They would do better by borrow-
ing on a short-term basis, and then taking out a new loan after rates fall. So, if interest rates are 
expected to fall, long-term rates will tend to be lower than short-term rates to attract borrowers.
These arguments imply that the shape of the yield curve will be strongly influenced by 
interest rate expectations. A sharply increasing (steep) yield curve, with long-term rates much 
higher than short-term rates, generally indicates that interest rates are expected to rise in the 
future (see the yield curve for November 2008 shown in Figure 5.2). A decreasing (inverted⁜渠屮 ) 
yield curve, with long-term rates lower than short-term rates, generally ­signals an expected 
decline in future interest rates (see the yield curve for November 2006 shown in Figure 5.2). 
Because interest rates tend to drop in response to a slowdown in the economy, an inverted 
yield curve is often interpreted as a negative forecast for economic growth. Indeed, as 
­Figure 5.3 illustrates, each of the last seven recessions in the United States was preceded by a

Chapter 5  Interest Rates
QUESTION: What are the main policy 
instruments used by central banks to control 
the economy?
ANSWER: The Federal Reserve (Fed) 
deploys several policy tools to achieve its 
goals of price stability, maximum sustain-
able employment, and financial stability. 
Lowering the federal funds short-term 
interest rate, the primary policy instrument, 
stimulates the economy. Raising the federal funds rate gener-
ally slows the economy. Buying and selling short-term U.S. 
Treasury securities through open market operations is standard 
practice. Prior to the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the Fed’s 
balance sheet ranged from $700–$900 billion. But when 
the Fed was unable to lower interest rates further because 
rates were so close to zero already, it resorted to large-scale, 
longer-term open market operations to increase liquidity in 
the financial system in the hopes of stimulating the economy 
further, thus growing its balance sheet significantly. With 
open mouth operations, the Fed’s announcements of its intent 
to buy or sell assets indicates its desired degree of future 
policy accommodation, often prompting markets to react 
by adjusting interest rates immediately. The Fed’s Lender-of-
Last-Resort authority allows it to lend money against good 
collateral to troubled institutions under certain conditions.
QUESTION: What factors limit the effectiveness of Fed policy?
ANSWER: Monetary policy does not act in isolation. Fiscal 
(taxing and spending), trade, and regulatory policies have 
huge consequence on the state of economic and financial 
conditions. In the short term, monetary policy can help 
buy time for an economy to improve, but it cannot cure 
structural failings of an economy in isolation or compen-
sate for the country’s growing indebtedness.
QUESTION: What tools did the Fed create to address the 
2007–2009 financial crisis?
ANSWER: During the darkest days of the crisis, markets 
did not operate effectively, prices for securities did not 
clear, and banks and other financial institutions lacked 
clarity and confidence in the financial 
wherewithal of each other. One effective, 
innovative tool, the Term Auction Facility 
(TAF), stimulated the economy by pro-
viding cheap and readily available term 
funding to banks, large and small, on the 
front lines of the economy, thus encour-
aging them to extend credit to businesses 
and consumers. After reducing the 
policy rate to near zero to help revive the 
economy, the Fed instituted two Quan-
titative Easing (QE) programs––special 
purchases of government and agency 
securities––to increase money supply, 
promote lending, and according to some 
proponents, increase prices of riskier 
assets.
The Fed also addressed the global 
financial crisis by establishing temporary central bank 
liquidity swap lines with the European Central Bank and 
other major central banks. Using this facility, a foreign 
central bank is able to obtain dollar funding for its custom-
ers by swapping Euros for dollars or another currency and 
agreeing to reverse the swap at a later date. The Fed does 
not take exchange rate risk, but it is subject to the credit 
risk of its central bank counterparty.
QUESTION: What tools is the European Central Bank 
(ECB) using to address the sovereign debt crisis? How does its 
approach compare to the Fed’s approach to the 2007–2009 
financial crisis?
ANSWER: As a novel economic federation, the ECB 
finds itself in a more difficult position than the Fed. The 
underlying economies and competitiveness are mark-
edly different across the Eurozone—in Germany versus 
Greece, for example. From 2007 until mid-2010, many 
European financiers and policymakers believed that global 
financial crisis was largely American-made, with some 
strains exported to the continent. By mid-2010, however, 
they recognized that it was indeed a global crisis. The 
ECB is formally charged with a single mandate of ensur-
ing price stability, rather than the broader mandate of the 
Fed. Still, its actions ultimately mirrored many of those 
undertaken by the Fed: lowering the effective policy rate 
to record lows, providing direct liquidity to the Eurozone’s 
financial institutions to avoid a potential run on the bank-
ing system, and instituting the Security Market Purchase 
program (buying sovereign credit of some of its distressed 
countries).

period in which the yield curve was inverted. Conversely, the yield curve tends to be steep as 
the economy comes out of a recession and interest rates are expected to rise.7
Clearly, the yield curve provides extremely important information for a business 
­manager. In addition to specifying the discount rates for risk-free cash flows that occur at 
different horizons, it is also a potential leading indicator of future economic growth.
7Other factors besides interest rate expectations—most notably risk—can have an impact on the shape of 
the yield curve. See Chapter 6 for further discussion.

Example 5.6
Comparing Short- and Long-Term Interest Rates
Problem
Suppose the current one-year interest rate is 1%. If it is known with certainty that the one-year 
interest rate will be 2% next year and 4% the following year, what will the interest rates r1, r2, 
and r3 of the yield curve be today? Is the yield curve flat, increasing, or inverted?
Solution
We are told already that the one-year rate r1 = 1%. To find the two-year rate, note that if we 
invest $1 for one year at the current one-year rate and then reinvest next year at the new one-year 
rate, after two years we will earn
$1 * (1.01) * (1.02) = $1.0302
We should earn the same payoff if we invest for two years at the current two-year rate r2:
$1 * (1 + r2)2 = $1.0302
Otherwise, there would be an arbitrage opportunity: If investing at the two-year rate led to a 
higher payoff, investors could invest for two years and borrow each year at the one-year rate. If 
investing at the two-year rate led to a lower payoff, investors could invest each year at the one-
year rate and borrow at the two-year rate.
Solving for r2, we find that
r2 = (1.0302)1/2 - 1 = 1.499%
Similarly, investing for three years at the one-year rates should have the same payoff as 
­investing at the current three-year rate:
(1.01) * (1.02) * (1.04) = 1.0714 = (1 + r3)3
We can solve for r3=(1.0714)1/3-1=2.326%. Therefore, the current yield curve has r1=1%,  
r2 = 1.499%, and r3 = 2.326%. The yield curve is increasing as a result of the anticipated 
higher interest rates in the future.

In this section, we discuss two other factors that are important when evaluating interest 
rates: risk and taxes.

Chapter 5  Interest Rates
Risk and Interest Rates
We have already seen that interest rates vary with the investment horizon. Interest rates 
also vary based on the identity of the borrower. For example, Figure 5.4 shows the inter-
est rates required by investors for five-year loans to a number of different borrowers in 
mid-2015.
Why do these interest rates vary so widely? The lowest interest rate is the rate paid on 
U.S. Treasury notes. U.S. Treasury securities are widely regarded to be risk free because 
there is virtually no chance the government will fail to pay the interest and default on 
these loans. Thus, when we refer to the “risk-free interest rate,” we mean the rate on U.S. 
Treasuries.
All other borrowers have some risk of default. For these loans, the stated interest rate 
is the maximum amount that investors will receive. Investors may receive less if the com-
pany has financial difficulties and is unable to fully repay the loan. To compensate for the 
risk that they will receive less if the firm defaults, investors demand a higher interest rate 
than the rate on U.S. Treasuries. The difference between the interest rate of the loan and 
the Treasury rate will depend on investors’ assessment of the likelihood that the firm will 
default.
Later, we will develop tools to evaluate the risk of different investments and determine 
the interest rate or discount rate that appropriately compensates investors for the level of 
risk they are taking. For now, remember that when discounting future cash flows, it is 
important to use a discount rate that matches both the horizon and the risk of the cash 
flows. Specifically, the right discount rate for a cash flow is the rate of return available in the 
market on other investments of comparable risk and term.

After-Tax Interest Rates
If the cash flows from an investment are taxed, the investor’s actual cash flow will be 
reduced by the amount of the tax payments. We will discuss the taxation of corporate 
investments in detail in later chapters. Here, we consider the effect of taxes on the interest 
earned on savings (or paid on borrowing). Taxes reduce the amount of interest the investor 
can keep, and we refer to this reduced amount as the after-tax interest rate.
Consider an investment that pays 8% interest (EAR) for one year. If you invest $100 at 
the start of the year, you will earn 8% * $100 = $8 in interest at year-end. This interest 
may be taxable as income.8 If you are in a 40% tax bracket, you will owe
(40% income tax rate) * ($8 interest) = $3.20 tax liability
Thus, you will receive only $8 - $3.20 = $4.80 after paying taxes. This amount is equiva-
lent to earning 4.80% interest and not paying any taxes, so the after-tax interest rate is 
4.80%.
In general, if the interest rate is r and the tax rate is t, then for each $1 invested you 
will earn interest equal to r and owe tax of t * r on the interest. The equivalent after-tax 
interest rate is therefore
After-Tax Interest Rate
	
r - (t * r) = r(1 - t)
(5.8)
Applying this formula to our previous example of an 8% interest rate and a 40% tax rate, 
we find the interest rate is 8% * (1 - 0.40) = 4.80% after taxes.
8In the United States, interest income for individuals is taxable as income unless the investment is held 
in a tax-sheltered retirement account or the investment is from tax-exempt securities (such as municipal 
bonds). Interest from U.S. Treasury securities is exempt from state and local taxes. Interest income earned 
by a corporation is also taxed at the corporate tax rate.
Example 5.7
Discounting Risky Cash Flows
Problem
Suppose the U.S. government owes your firm $1000, to be paid in five years. Based on the 
­interest rates in Figure 5.4, what is the present value of this cash flow? Suppose instead Gap Inc. 
owes your firm $1000. Estimate the present value in this case.
Solution
Assuming we can regard the government’s obligation as risk free (there is no chance you won’t be 
paid), then we discount the cash flow using the risk-free Treasury interest rate of 1.7%:
PV = $1000 , (1.017)5 = $919.17
The obligation from Gap is not risk-free. There is no guarantee that Gap will not have financial 
difficulties and fail to pay the $1000. Because the risk of this obligation is likely to be compa-
rable to the five-year bond quoted in Figure 5.4, the 4.9% interest rate of the loan is a more 
appropriate discount rate to use to compute the present value in this case:
PV = $1000 , (1.049)5 = $787.27
Note the substantially lower present value of Gap’s debt compared to the government debt due 
to Gap’s higher risk of default.

Chapter 5  Interest Rates
We can apply the same calculation to loans. In some cases, the interest on loans is tax 
deductible.9 In that case, the cost of paying interest on the loan is offset by the benefit of 
the tax deduction. The net effect is that when interest on a loan is tax deductible, the effec-
tive after-tax interest rate is r(1 - t). In other words, the ability to deduct the interest 
expense lowers the effective after-tax interest rate paid on the loan.
9In the United States, interest is tax deductible for individuals only for home mortgages or home equity 
loans (up to certain limits), some student loans, and loans made to purchase securities. Interest on other 
forms of consumer debt is not tax deductible. Interest on debt is tax deductible for corporations.
Example 5.8
Comparing After-Tax Interest Rates
Problem
Suppose you have a credit card with a 14% APR with monthly compounding, a bank savings 
account paying 5% EAR, and a home equity loan with a 7% APR with monthly compounding. 
Your income tax rate is 40%. The interest on the savings account is taxable, and the interest on 
the home equity loan is tax deductible. What is the effective after-tax interest rate of each instru-
ment, expressed as an EAR? Suppose you are purchasing a new car and are offered a car loan with 
a 4.8% APR and monthly compounding (which is not tax deductible). Should you take the car 
loan?
Solution
Because taxes are typically paid annually, we first convert each interest rate to an EAR to deter-
mine the actual amount of interest earned or paid during the year. The savings account has a 5% 
EAR. Using Eq. 5.3, the EAR of the credit card is (1 + 0.14/12)12 - 1 = 14.93%, and the EAR 
of the home equity loan is (1 + 0.07/12)12 - 1 = 7.23%.
Next, we compute the after-tax interest rate for each. Because the credit card interest is not tax 
deductible, its after-tax interest rate is the same as its pre-tax interest rate, 14.93%. The after-tax 
interest rate on the home equity loan, which is tax deductible, is 7.23% * (1 - 0.40) = 4.34%. 
The after-tax interest rate that we will earn on the savings account is 5% * (1 - 0.40) = 3%.
Now consider the car loan. Its EAR is (1 + 0.048/12)12 - 1 = 4.91%. It is not tax deduct-
ible, so this rate is also its after-tax interest rate. Therefore, the car loan is not our cheapest source 
of funds. It would be best to use savings, which has an opportunity cost of foregone after-tax 
interest of 3%. If we don’t have sufficient savings, we should use the home equity loan, which has 
an after-tax cost of 4.34%. And we should certainly not borrow using the credit card!

5.5	 The Opportunity Cost of Capital
As we have seen in this chapter, the interest rates we observe in the market will vary based 
on quoting conventions, the term of the investment, and risk. The actual return kept by an 
investor will also depend on how the interest is taxed. In this chapter, we have developed 

the tools to account for these differences and gained some insights into how interest rates 
are determined.
In Chapter 3, we argued that the “market interest rate” provides the exchange rate that 
we need to compute present values and evaluate an investment opportunity. But with so 
many interest rates to choose from, the term “market interest rate” is inherently ­ambiguous. 
Therefore, going forward, we will base the discount rate that we use to evaluate cash flows 
on the investor’s opportunity cost of capital (or more simply, the cost of capital), which 
is the best available expected return offered in the market on an investment of comparable risk 
and term to the cash flow being discounted.
The cost of capital is clearly relevant for a firm seeking to raise capital from outside 
investors. In order to attract funds, the firm must offer an expected return comparable to 
what investors could earn elsewhere with the same risk and horizon. The same logic applies 
when a firm considers a project it can fund internally. Because any funds invested in a new 
project could be returned to shareholders to invest elsewhere, the new project should be 
taken only if it offers a better return than shareholders’ other opportunities.
Thus, the opportunity cost of capital provides the benchmark against which the cash 
flows of the new investment should be evaluated. For a risk-free project, it will typically 
correspond to the interest rate on U.S. Treasury securities with a similar term. The cost of 
capital for risky projects will often exceed this amount, depending on the nature and mag-
nitude of the risk. We will develop tools for estimating the cost of capital for risky projects 
in Part IV.

States Dig a $3 Trillion Hole by Discounting at the Wrong Rate
Almost all states in the United States offer their employees 
a defined benefit pension plan guaranteeing a retirement 
income based on the duration of their employment with the 
state and their final salary. These promised payments are the 
plan’s liabilities—and because the payouts are guaranteed, 
they are comparable to a risk-free bond. To meet these lia-
bilities, states put aside funds and invest them in risky assets 
like stocks and corporate bonds.
Unfortunately, states make a critical, but common, mis-
take when determining their funding requirements: They 
compute the present value of the liabilities using an arbitrary 
discount rate (typically 8%) that is unrelated to the riskiness 
of the plan’s liabilities.
Because of their guaranteed nature, the risk-free rate, 
which is currently well below 8%, is the correct discount rate 
for plan liabilities.10 This error has led states to grossly under-
estimate the value of their liabilities—and underfunded 
­pension plans impose a potential future obligation on tax-
payers. How large is this obligation? Professors Robert 
­Novy-Marx and Joshua Rauh11 found that total state pen-
sion underfunding in 2008 amounted to at least $3 trillion. 
They also estimated that there is less than a 5% probability 
that, over the next 15 years, states will be able to meet their 
­pension obligations without turning to taxpayers. Worse still, 
states are most likely to need the money in market down-
turns, precisely when taxpayers are least able to pay.
10States often justify the 8% rate as the return they expect to earn on their investments. But the risks of 
their investments and of their liabilities are not comparable (for example, the return on stocks is not guar-
anteed), so this argument is fundamentally flawed.

Reserve raises interest rates to moderate investment and combat inflation and lowers interest 
rates to stimulate investment and economic growth.
	
n	 Interest rates differ with the investment horizon according to the term structure of interest 
rates. The graph plotting interest rates as a function of the horizon is called the yield curve.
	
n	 Cash flows should be discounted using the discount rate that is appropriate for their horizon.

n	 Annuity and perpetuity formulas cannot be applied when discount rates vary with the horizon.
	
n	 The shape of the yield curve tends to vary with investors’ expectations of future economic growth 
and interest rates. It tends to be inverted prior to recessions and to be steep coming out of a recession.
5.4  Risk and Taxes
	
n	 U.S. government Treasury rates are regarded as risk-free interest rates. Because other borrowers 
may default, they will pay higher interest rates on their loans.

16.	 You have just purchased a home and taken out a $460,000 mortgage. The mortgage has a 
30-year term with monthly payments and an APR of 6.08%.
a.	 How much will you pay in interest, and how much will you pay in principal, during the first 
year?
b.	 How much will you pay in interest, and how much will you pay in principal, during the 
20th year (i.e., between 19 and 20 years from now)?
	
17.	 Your mortgage has 26 years left, and has an APR of 7.449% with monthly payments of $1449.
a.	 What is the outstanding balance?
b.	 Suppose you cannot make the mortgage payment and you are in danger of losing your 
house to foreclosure. The bank has offered to renegotiate your loan. The bank expects to get 
$149,638 for the house if it forecloses. They will lower your payment as long as they will 
receive at least this amount (in present value terms). If current 26-year mortgage interest 
rates have dropped to 4.842% (APR), what is the lowest monthly payment you could make 
for the remaining life of your loan that would be attractive to the bank?
	
*18.	 You have an outstanding student loan with required payments of $600 per month for the next 
four years. The interest rate on the loan is 10% APR (monthly). You are considering making 
an extra payment of $175 today (that is, you will pay an extra $175 that you are not required 
to pay). If you are required to continue to make payments of $600 per month until the loan is 
paid off, what is the amount of your final payment? What effective rate of return (expressed as 
an APR with monthly compounding) have you earned on the $175?
	
*19.	 Consider again the setting of Problem 18. Now that you realize your best investment is to pre-
pay your student loan, you decide to prepay as much as you can each month. Looking at your 
budget, you can afford to pay an extra $250 per month in addition to your required monthly 
payments of $600, or $850 in total each month. How long will it take you to pay off the loan?
	
*20.	 Oppenheimer Bank is offering a 30-year mortgage with an APR of 5.25% based on monthly 
compounding. With this mortgage your monthly payments would be $2,000 per month. In 
addition, Oppenheimer Bank offers you the following deal: Instead of making the monthly 
payment of $2,000 every month, you can make half the payment every two weeks (so that you 
will make 52/2 = 26 payments per year). With this plan, how long will it take to pay off the 
mortgage if the EAR of the loan is unchanged?
	
*21.	 Your friend tells you he has a very simple trick for shortening the time it takes to repay your 
mortgage by one-third: Use your holiday bonus to make an extra payment on January 1 of each

an original term of 30 years and an APR of 12%.
a.	 If you take out your mortgage on January 1 (so that your first payment is due on Febru-
ary 1), and you make your first extra payment at the end of the first year, in what year will 
you ­finish repaying your mortgage?
b.	 If you take out your mortgage on July 1 (so the first payment is on August 1), and you make 
the extra payment each January, in how many months will you pay off your mortgage?

finance the rest with a 0% APR loan over 30 months. But having just quit your job and started 
an MBA program, you are in debt and you expect to be in debt for at least the next 21⁄2 years. 
You plan to use credit cards to pay your expenses; luckily you have one with a low (fixed) rate of 
14.51% APR. Which payment option is best for you?
	
23.	 The mortgage on your house is five years old. It required monthly payments of $1390, had 
an original term of 30 years, and had an interest rate of 10% (APR). In the intervening five 
years, interest rates have fallen and so you have decided to refinance—that is, you will roll over 

the outstanding balance into a new mortgage. The new mortgage has a 30-year term, requires 
monthly payments, and has an interest rate of 5.625% (APR).
a.	 What monthly repayments will be required with the new loan?
b.	 If you still want to pay off the mortgage in 25 years, what monthly payment should you 
make after you refinance?
c.	 Suppose you are willing to continue making monthly payments of $1390. How long will it 
take you to pay off the mortgage after refinancing?
d.	Suppose you are willing to continue making monthly payments of $1390, and want to pay 
off the mortgage in 25 years. How much additional cash can you borrow today as part of the 
refinancing?
	
24.	 You have credit card debt of $30,000 that has an APR (monthly compounding) of 16%. Each 
month you pay the minimum monthly payment only. You are required to pay only the out-
standing interest. You have received an offer in the mail for an otherwise identical credit card 
with an APR of 10%. After considering all your alternatives, you decide to switch cards, roll 
over the outstanding balance on the old card into the new card, and borrow additional money 
as well. How much can you borrow today on the new card without changing the minimum 
monthly payment you will be required to pay?

The Opportunity Cost of Capital
	
39.	 In the summer of 2008, at Heathrow airport in London, Bestofthebest (BB), a private com-
pany, offered a lottery to win a Ferrari or 100,000 British pounds, equivalent at the time to 
about $200,000. Both the Ferrari and the money, in 100-pound notes, were on display. If the 
U.K. interest rate was 6% per year, and the dollar interest rate was 3% per year (EARs), how 
much did it cost the company in dollars each month to keep the cash on display? That is, what 
was the opportunity cost of keeping it on display rather than in a bank account? (Ignore taxes.)
	
40.	 Your firm is considering the purchase of a new office phone system. You can either pay $32,500

pounding). Which payment plan is more attractive?
b.	 Suppose your firm currently borrows at a rate of 17% per year (APR with monthly com-
pounding). Which payment plan would be more attractive in this case?
	
41.	 After reading the Novy-Marz and Rauh article (see the Common Mistake Box on page 193), 
you decide to compute the total obligation of the state that you live in. After some research you 
determine that your state’s promised pension payments amount to $9.8 billion annually, and 
you expect this obligation to grow at 2.2% per year. You determine that the riskiness of this 
obligation is the same as the riskiness of the state’s debt. Based on the pricing of that debt you 
determine that the correct discount rate for the fund’s liabilities is 2.7% per annum. Currently, 
based on actuarial calculations using 7.5% as the discount rate, the plan is neither over- nor 
underfunded—the value of the liabilities exactly matches the value of the assets. What is the 
extent of the true unfunded liability?
Data Case
Florida’s Pension Plan Liability
You have been hired as a consultant by CARE (Conservatives Are REsponsible), a political action 
committee focusing on fiscal responsibility. The Florida chapter has become increasingly worried 
about the state’s indebtedness. In an effort to assess the extent of the problem, you have been hired 
to estimate by how much the state pension plan is underfunded. Luckily for you, Florida publishes 
an annual financial report on the status of the state’s pension plan.
	
1.	 Download the latest financial report by going to the Florida State Auditor General’s Web site: 
www.myflorida.com/audgen/ and clicking on the Auditor General Released Reports: by Fiscal 
Year (located on the far left).
	
2.	 Choose the latest year the report is available. (In 2015 it was called “Florida Retirement System 
Pension Plan and Other State-Administered Systems—Financial Audit” and was listed as report 
number 2016-097 in the 2015–2016 fiscal year.)
	
3.	 Search for the place in the report listing the fund’s future liabilities—its promised payments to 
existing empoyees. (In 2015 this information was listed on p. 102 in graphical format only. The 
Internet site WebPlotDigitizer—arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/—provides a convenient way to 
digitize information that is provided in graphical format. Alternatively, you can just eyeball the 
data.)
	
4.	 Because these pension payments are a legal obligation for the state, you assess their risk to be 
similar to other state debt, and therefore the cost of capital should be similar to Florida’s current 
borrowing rate. Begin by first searching for the State of Florida’s bond rating. Once you know 
the rating, go to FMSBonds Inc. (www.fmsbonds.com/market-yields/) to find out what Florida 
bonds at different maturities with this rating are currently yielding.
	
5.	 Using these yields to approximate the cost of capital, estimate the present value of Florida’s 
­pension liabilities. 

	
Data Case

6.	 Calculate the level of underfunding by finding the value of the pension fund’s assets (in 2015, 
this information was on p. 19 of the report) and subtracting the present value of the liabilities. 
Express the underfunding as the value of the assets as a percentage of the present value of the pen-
sion liabilities.
	
7.	 Compare your estimate of the actual level of underfunding to what the report calculates using 
GAAP accounting. (In 2015, this information was on p. 61 of the report.) Explain the difference 
between your result and theirs.
	
8.	 Find the current level of the State of Florida indebtedness by going to the following Web site: 
www.usgovernmentspending.com/compare_state_spending_2015bH0d
	
9.	 In percentage terms, how much would the stated level of the indebtedness of the State of ­Florida 
increase if the level of underfunding in the state’s pension plan is included in overall state 
indebtedness?

In this appendix, we consider how to discount cash flows when interest is paid, or cash 
flows are received, on a continuous basis.
Discount Rates for a Continuously 
Compounded APR
Some investments compound more frequently than daily. As we move from daily to hourly 
(k = 24 * 365) to compounding every second (k = 60 * 60 * 24 * 365), we approach 
the limit of continuous compounding, in which we compound every instant (k = ). 
Eq. 5.3 cannot be used to compute the discount rate from an APR quote based on con-
tinuous compounding. In this case, the discount rate for a period length of one year—that 
is, the EAR—is given by Eq. 5A.1:
The EAR for a Continuously Compounded APR
	
(1 + EAR) = e APR
(5A.1)
where the mathematical constant12 e = 2.71828 c . Once you know the EAR, you can 
compute the discount rate for any compounding period length using Eq. 5.1.
Alternatively, if we know the EAR and want to find the corresponding continuously 
­compounded APR, we can invert Eq. 5A.1 by taking the natural logarithm (ln) of both 
sides:13
The Continuously Compounded APR for an EAR
	
APR = ln(1 + EAR)
(5A.2)
Continuously compounded rates are not often used in practice. Sometimes, banks offer 
them as a marketing gimmick, but there is little actual difference between daily and con-
tinuous compounding. For example, with a 6% APR, daily compounding provides an 
EAR of (1 + 0.06/365)365 - 1 = 6.18313%, whereas with continuous compounding the 
EAR is e0.06 - 1 = 6.18365%.
Continuously Arriving Cash Flows
How can we compute the present value of an investment whose cash flows arrive continu-
ously? For example, consider the cash flows of an online book retailer. Suppose the firm 
forecasts cash flows of $10 million per year. The $10 million will be received throughout 
each year, not at year-end; that is, the $10 million is paid continuously throughout the year.
We can compute the present value of cash flows that arrive continuously using a version 
of the growing perpetuity formula. If cash flows arrive, starting immediately, at an initial 
12The constant e raised to a power is also written as the function exp. That is, e APR = exp(APR). This func-
tion is built into most spreadsheets and calculators.
13Recall that ln(ex) = x

	
Chapter 5  Appendix:  Continuous Rates and Cash Flows

rate of $C per year, and if the cash flows grow at rate g per year, then given a discount rate 
(expressed as an EAR) of r per year, the present value of the cash flows is
Present Value of a Continuously Growing Perpetuity14
	
PV =
C
rcc - gcc
(5A.3)
where rcc = ln(1 + r) and gcc = ln(1 + g) are the discount and growth rates expressed as 
continuously compounded APRs, respectively.
There is another, approximate method for dealing with continuously arriving cash 
flows. Let C1 be the total cash flows that arrive during the first year. Because the cash flows 
arrive throughout the year, we can think of them arriving “on average” in the middle of the 
year. In that case, we should discount the cash flows by  1⁄2 year less:
	
C
rcc - gcc 
C1
r - g * (1 + r)1/2
(5A.4)
In practice, the approximation in Eq. 5A.4 works quite well. More generally, it implies that 
when cash flows arrive continuously, we can compute present values reasonably accurately 
by following a “mid-year convention” in which we pretend that all of the cash flows for 
the year arrive in the middle of the year.
14Given the perpetuity formula, we can value an annuity as the difference between two perpetuities.

Your firm is considering buying an oil rig. The rig will initially produce oil at a rate of 30 mil-
lion barrels per year. You have a long-term contract that allows you to sell the oil at a profit of 
$1.25 per barrel. If the rate of oil production from the rig declines by 3% over the year and the 
discount rate is 10% per year (EAR), how much would you be willing to pay for the rig?
Solution
According to the estimates, the rig will generate profits at an initial rate of (30 million barrels 
 per year) * ($1.25/barrel) = $37.5 million per year. The 10% discount rate is equivalent to a 
continuously compounded APR of rcc = ln(1 + 0.10) = 9.531%; similarly, the growth rate has 
an APR of gcc = ln(1 - 0.03) = -3.046%. From Eq. 5A.3, the present value of the ­profits from 
the rig is
PV(profits) = 37.5/(rcc - gcc) = 37.5/(0.09531 + 0.03046) = $298.16 million
Alternatively, we can closely approximate the present value as follows. The initial profit rate of 
the rig is $37.5 million per year. By the end of the year, the profit rate will have declined by 3% to 
37.5 * (1 - 0.03) = $36.375 million per year. Therefore, the average profit rate during the year 
is approximately (37.5 + 36.375)/2 = $36.938 million. Valuing the cash flows as though they 
occur at the middle of each year, we have
 PV(profits) = [36.938/(r - g)] * (1 + r)1/2
 = [36.938/(0.10 + 0.03)] * (1.10)1/2 = $298.01 million
Note that both methods produce very similar results.

Valuing Bonds
aFter a FOUr-Year hIatUS, the U.S. GOVerNMeNt BeGaN issuing 
30-year Treasury bonds again in August 2005. While the move was due in part to the 
government’s need to borrow to fund record budget deficits, the decision to issue 
30-year bonds was also a response to investor demand for long-term, risk-free securi-
ties backed by the U.S. government. These 30-year Treasury bonds are part of a much 
larger market for publicly traded bonds. As of January 2015, the value of traded U.S. 
Treasury debt was approximately $12.5 trillion, $4.5 trillion more than the value of all 
publicly traded U.S. corporate bonds. If we include bonds issued by municipalities, gov-
ernment agencies, and other issuers, investors had over $39 trillion invested in U.S. 
bond markets, compared with just over $26 trillion in U.S. equity markets.1
In this chapter, we look at the basic types of bonds and consider their valuation. 
Understanding bonds and their pricing is useful for several reasons. First, the prices of 
risk-free government bonds can be used to determine the risk-free interest rates that 
produce the yield curve discussed in Chapter 5. As we saw there, the yield curve pro-
vides important information for valuing risk-free cash flows and assessing expectations 
of inflation and economic growth. Second, firms often issue bonds to fund their own 
investments, and the returns investors receive on those bonds is one factor determining 
a firm’s cost of capital. Finally, bonds provide an opportunity to begin our study of how 
securities are priced in a competitive market. The ideas we develop in this chapter will 
be helpful when we turn to the topic of valuing stocks in Chapter 9.
We begin the chapter by evaluating the promised cash flows for dif­ferent types of 
bonds. Given a bond’s cash flows, we can use the Law of One Price to directly relate the 
bond’s return, or yield, and its price. We also describe how bond prices change dynami-
cally over time and examine the relationship between the prices and yields of different 
bonds. Finally, we consider bonds for which there is a risk of default, so that their cash 
flows are not known with certainty. As an important application, we look at the behavior 
of corporate and sovereign bonds during the recent economic crisis.

6.1	 Bond Cash Flows, Prices, and Yields
In this section, we look at how bonds are defined and then study the basic relationship 
between bond prices and their yield to maturity.
Bond Terminology
Recall from Chapter 3 that a bond is a security sold by governments and corporations to 
raise money from investors today in exchange for promised future payments. The terms of 
the bond are described as part of the bond certificate, which indicates the amounts and 
dates of all payments to be made. These payments are made until a final repayment date, 
called the maturity date of the bond. The time remaining until the repayment date is 
known as the term of the bond.
Bonds typically make two types of payments to their holders. The promised interest pay-
ments of a bond are called coupons. The bond certificate typically specifies that the coupons 
will be paid periodically (e.g., semiannually) until the maturity date of the bond. The principal 
or face value of a bond is the notional amount we use to compute the interest payments. Usu-
ally, the face value is repaid at maturity. It is generally denominated in standard increments such 
as $1000. A bond with a $1000 face value, for example, is often referred to as a “$1000 bond.”
The amount of each coupon payment is determined by the coupon rate of the bond. 
This coupon rate is set by the issuer and stated on the bond certificate. By convention, the 
coupon rate is expressed as an APR, so the amount of each coupon payment, CPN, is
Coupon Payment
	
CPN =
Coupon Rate * Face Value
Number of Coupon Payments per Year
(6.1)
For example, a “$1000 bond with a 10% coupon rate and semiannual payments” will pay 
coupon payments of $1000 * 10%/2 = $50 every six months.
Zero-Coupon Bonds
The simplest type of bond is a zero-coupon bond, which does not make coupon ­payments. 
The only cash payment the investor receives is the face value of the bond on the maturity 
date. Treasury bills, which are U.S. government bonds with a maturity of up to one year, 
are zero-coupon bonds. Recall from Chapter 4 that the present value of a future cash flow 
is less than the cash flow itself. As a result, prior to its maturity date, the price of a zero-
coupon bond is less than its face value. That is, zero-coupon bonds trade at a discount 
(a price lower than the face value), so they are also called pure discount bonds.
Suppose that a one-year, risk-free, zero-coupon bond with a $100,000 face value has an 
initial price of $96,618.36. If you purchased this bond and held it to maturity, you would 
have the following cash flows:
0
$96,618.36
$100,000
1
Although the bond pays no “interest” directly, as an investor you are compensated for 
the time value of your money by purchasing the bond at a discount to its face value.
Yield to Maturity.  Recall that the IRR of an investment opportunity is the discount rate 
at which the NPV of the cash flows of the investment opportunity is equal to zero. So, the 
IRR of an investment in a zero-coupon bond is the rate of return that investors will earn on 

their money if they buy the bond at its current price and hold it to maturity. The IRR of an 
investment in a bond is given a special name, the yield to maturity (YTM) or just the yield:
The yield to maturity of a bond is the discount rate that sets the present value of the promised 
bond payments equal to the current market price of the bond.
Intuitively, the yield to maturity for a zero-coupon bond is the return you will earn as an 
investor from holding the bond to maturity and receiving the promised face value payment.
Let’s determine the yield to maturity of the one-year zero-coupon bond discussed ear-
lier. According to the definition, the yield to maturity of the one-year bond solves the fol-
lowing equation:
96,618.36 = 100,000
1 + YTM1
In this case,
1 + YTM1 = 100,000
96,618.36 = 1.035
That is, the yield to maturity for this bond is 3.5%. Because the bond is risk free, ­investing 
in this bond and holding it to maturity is like earning 3.5% interest on your initial 
­investment. Thus, by the Law of One Price, the competitive market risk-free interest rate 
is 3.5%, meaning all one-year risk-free investments must earn 3.5%.
Similarly, the yield to maturity for a zero-coupon bond with n periods to maturity, cur-
rent price P, and face value FV solves2
	
P =
FV
(1 + YTMn)n
(6.2)
Rearranging this expression, we get
Yield to Maturity of an n-Year Zero-Coupon Bond
	
YTMn = ¢FV
P ≤
1/n
- 1
(6.3)
The yield to maturity (YTMn) in Eq. 6.3 is the per-period rate of return for holding the 
bond from today until maturity on date n.
Risk-Free Interest Rates.  In earlier chapters, we discussed the competitive market inter-
est rate rn available from today until date n for risk-free cash flows; we used this interest 
rate as the cost of capital for a risk-free cash flow that occurs on date n. Because a default-
free zero-coupon bond that matures on date n provides a risk-free return over the same 
period, the Law of One Price guarantees that the risk-free interest rate equals the yield to 
maturity on such a bond.
Risk-Free Interest Rate with Maturity n
	
rn = YTMn
(6.4)
Consequently, we will often refer to the yield to maturity of the appropriate maturity, 
zero-coupon risk-free bond as the risk-free interest rate. Some financial professionals also 
use the term spot interest rates to refer to these default-free, zero-coupon yields.
2In Chapter 4, we used the notation FVn for the future value on date n of a cash flow. Conveniently, for a 
zero-coupon bond, the future value is also its face value, so the abbreviation FV continues to apply.

Yields for Different Maturities
Problem
Suppose the following zero-coupon bonds are trading at the prices shown below per $100 face 
value. Determine the corresponding spot interest rates that determine the zero coupon yield curve.
Solution
Using Eq. 6.3, we have
r1 = YTM1 = (100/96.62) - 1
= 3.50%
r2 = YTM2 = (100/92.45)1/2 - 1 = 4.00%
r3 = YTM3 = (100/87.63)1/3 - 1 = 4.50%
r4 = YTM4 = (100/83.06)1/4 - 1 = 4.75%

In Chapter  5, we introduced the yield curve, which plots the risk-free interest rate 
for different maturities. These risk-free interest rates correspond to the yields of risk-free 
­zero-coupon bonds. Thus, the yield curve we introduced in Chapter 5 is also referred to as 
the zero-coupon yield curve.
Negative Bond Yields
theft!). Thus, we can view the $25.56 as the price investors were 
willing to pay to have the U.S. Treasury hold their money safely 
for them at a time when no other investments seemed truly safe.
This phenomenon repeated itself in Europe starting in 
mid-2012. In this case, negative yields emerged due to a 
concern about both the safety of European banks as well as 
the stability of the euro as a currency. As investors in Greece 
or other countries began to worry their economies might 
depart from the euro, they were willing to hold German and 
Swiss government bonds even at negative yields as a way 
to protect themselves against the Eurozone unraveling. By 
mid-2015, almost 25% of European government bonds had 
negative yields, with some Swiss bonds having yields close 
to -1%!
The persistence of such large negative yields are chal-
lenging to explain. Most of the holders of these bonds are 
institutions and pension funds who are restricted to hold 
very safe assets. And while they could hold currency instead, 
obtaining, storing, and securing large quantities of cash 
would also be very costly. (Indeed, Swiss banks have report-
edly refused large currency withdrawals by hedge funds 
attempting to exploit the arbitrage opportunity.) Bonds are 
also much easier to trade, and use as collateral, than giant 
vaults of cash. Together, the safety and convenience of these 
bonds must be worth the nearly 1% per year these investors 
are willing to sacrifice.
On December 9, 2008, in the midst of one of the worst finan-
cial crises in history, the unthinkable happened: For the first 
time since the Great Depression, U.S. Treasury Bills traded at 
a negative yield. That is, these risk-free pure discount bonds 
traded at premium. As Bloomberg.com reported: “If you 
invested $1 million in three-month bills at today’s negative 
discount rate of 0.01%, for a price of 100.002556, at matu-
rity you would receive the par value for a loss of $25.56.”
A negative yield on a Treasury bill implies that investors 
have an arbitrage opportunity: By selling the bill, and hold-
ing the proceeds in cash, they would have a risk-free profit of 
$25.56. Why did investors not rush to take advantage of the 
arbitrage opportunity and thereby eliminate it?
Well, first, the negative yields did not last very long, sug-
gesting that, in fact, investors did rush to take advantage of this 
opportunity. But second, after closer consideration, the oppor-
tunity might not have been a sure risk-free arbitrage. When sell-
ing a Treasury security, the investor must choose where to invest, 
or at least hold, the proceeds. In normal times investors would 
be happy to deposit the proceeds with a bank, and consider this 
deposit to be risk free. But these were not normal times—many 
investors had great concerns about the financial stability of 
banks and other financial intermediaries. Perhaps investors shied 
away from this “arbitrage” opportunity because they were wor-
ried that the cash they would receive could not be held safely 
anywhere (even putting it “under the mattress” has a risk of 
Global Financial Crisis

Example 6.2
The Cash Flows of a Coupon Bond
Problem
The U.S. Treasury has just issued a five-year, $1000 bond with a 5% coupon rate and semian-
nual coupons. What cash flows will you receive if you hold this bond until maturity?
Solution
The face value of this bond is $1000. Because this bond pays coupons semiannually, from 
Eq. 6.1, you will receive a coupon payment every six months of CPN = $1000 * 5%/2 = $25. 
Here is the timeline, based on a six-month period:
Note that the last payment occurs five years (10 six-month periods) from now and is ­composed 
of both a coupon payment of $25 and the face value payment of $1000.

Coupon Bonds
Like zero-coupon bonds, coupon bonds pay investors their face value at maturity. In addi-
tion, these bonds make regular coupon interest payments. Two types of U.S. Treasury 
coupon securities are currently traded in financial markets: Treasury notes, which have 
original maturities from one to 10 years, and Treasury bonds, which have original maturi-
ties of more than 10 years.
We can also compute the yield to maturity of a coupon bond. Recall that the yield to 
maturity for a bond is the IRR of investing in the bond and holding it to maturity; it is the 
single discount rate that equates the present value of the bond’s remaining cash flows to its 
current price, shown in the following timeline:
Because the coupon payments represent an annuity, the yield to maturity is the interest 
rate y that solves the following equation:3
Yield to Maturity of a Coupon Bond
	
P = CPN * 1
y ¢1 -

(1 + y)N≤+
FV
(1 + y)N
(6.5)
Unfortunately, unlike in the case of zero-coupon bonds, there is no simple formula to 
solve for the yield to maturity directly. Instead, we need to use either trial-and-error or the 
annuity spreadsheet we introduced in Chapter 4 (or Excel’s IRR function).
3In Eq. 6.5, we have assumed that the first cash coupon will be paid one period from now. If the first coupon 
is less than one period away, the cash price of the bond can be found by adjusting the price in Eq. 6.5 by 
­multiplying by (1 + y)f, where f is the fraction of the coupon interval that has already elapsed. (Also, bond prices 
are often quoted in terms of the clean price, which is calculated by deducting from the cash price P an amount, 
called accrued interest, equal to f * CPN. See the box on “Clean and Dirty” bond prices on page 215.)

Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
When we calculate a bond’s yield to maturity by solving Eq. 6.5, the yield we compute 
will be a rate per coupon interval. This yield is typically stated as an annual rate by multiply-
ing it by the number of coupons per year, thereby converting it to an APR with the same 
compounding interval as the coupon rate.
Example 6.3
Computing the Yield to Maturity of a Coupon Bond
Problem
Consider the five-year, $1000 bond with a 5% coupon rate and semiannual coupons described 
in Example 6.2. If this bond is currently trading for a price of $957.35, what is the bond’s yield 
to maturity?
Solution
Because the bond has 10 remaining coupon payments, we compute its yield y by solving:
957.35 = 25 * 1

(1 + y)10 ≤+

We can solve it by trial-and-error or by using the annuity spreadsheet:
Therefore, y = 3%. Because the bond pays coupons semiannually, this yield is for a ­six-month 
period. We convert it to an APR by multiplying by the number of coupon ­payments per year. 
Thus the bond has a yield to maturity equal to a 6% APR with semiannual compounding.

Problem
Consider again the five-year, $1000 bond with a 5% coupon rate and semiannual coupons pre-
sented in Example 6.3. Suppose you are told that its yield to maturity has increased to 6.30% 
(expressed as an APR with semiannual compounding). What price is the bond trading for now?
Solution
Given the yield, we can compute the price using Eq. 6.5. First, note that a 6.30% APR is equiva-
lent to a semiannual rate of 3.15%. Therefore, the bond price is
P = 25 *

We can also use Eq. 6.5 to compute a bond’s price based on its yield to maturity. We 
simply discount the cash flows using the yield, as shown in Example 6.4.

Because we can convert any price into a yield, and vice versa, prices and yields are 
often used interchangeably. For example, the bond in Example 6.4 could be quoted as 
having a yield of 6.30% or a price of $944.98 per $1000 face value. Indeed, bond traders 
generally quote bond yields rather than bond prices. One advantage of quoting the yield 
to maturity rather than the price is that the yield is independent of the face value of the 
bond. When prices are quoted in the bond market, they are conventionally quoted as a 
percentage of their face value. Thus, the bond in Example 6.4 would be quoted as having 
a price of 94.498, which would imply an actual price of $944.98 given the $1000 face 
value of the bond.

2.	 The risk-free interest rate for a maturity of n-years can be determined from the yield of what type 
of bond?
	
6.2	 Dynamic Behavior of Bond Prices
As we mentioned earlier, zero-coupon bonds trade at a discount—that is, prior to matu-
rity, their price is less than their face value. Coupon bonds may trade at a discount, at a 
premium (a price greater than their face value), or at par (a price equal to their face value). 
In this section, we identify when a bond will trade at a discount or premium as well as how 
the bond’s price will change due to the passage of time and fluctuations in interest rates.
Discounts and Premiums
If the bond trades at a discount, an investor who buys the bond will earn a return both 
from receiving the coupons and from receiving a face value that exceeds the price paid for 
the bond. As a result, if a bond trades at a discount, its yield to maturity will exceed its 
coupon rate. Given the relationship between bond prices and yields, the reverse is clearly 
also true: If a coupon bond’s yield to maturity exceeds its coupon rate, the present value 
of its cash flows at the yield to maturity will be less than its face value, and the bond will 
trade at a discount.
A bond that pays a coupon can also trade at a premium to its face value. In this case, 
an investor’s return from the coupons is diminished by receiving a face value less than the 
price paid for the bond. Thus, a bond trades at a premium whenever its yield to maturity 
is less than its coupon rate.
When a bond trades at a price equal to its face value, it is said to trade at par. A bond 
trades at par when its coupon rate is equal to its yield to maturity. A bond that trades at a 
discount is also said to trade below par, and a bond that trades at a premium is said to trade 
above par.
Table 6.1 summarizes these properties of coupon bond prices.

Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
Most issuers of coupon bonds choose a coupon rate so that the bonds will initially trade at, 
or very close to, par (i.e., at face value). For example, the U.S. Treasury sets the coupon rates 
on its notes and bonds in this way. After the issue date, the market price of a bond generally 
changes over time for two reasons. First, as time passes, the bond gets closer to its maturity 
date. Holding fixed the bond’s yield to maturity, the present value of the bond’s remaining 
cash flows changes as the time to maturity decreases. Second, at any point in time, changes in 
market interest rates affect the bond’s yield to maturity and its price (the present value of the 
remaining cash flows). We explore these two effects in the remainder of this section.
Time and Bond Prices
Let’s consider the effect of time on the price of a bond. Suppose you purchase a 30-year, 
zero-coupon bond with a yield to maturity of 5%. For a face value of $100, the bond will 
initially trade for
P(30 years to maturity) = 100
1.0530 = $23.14
Now let’s consider the price of this bond five years later, when it has 25 years remaining until 
maturity. If the bond’s yield to maturity remains at 5%, the bond price in five years will be
P(25 years to maturity) = 100
1.0525 = $29.53
Note that the bond price is higher, and hence the discount from its face value is smaller, 
when there is less time to maturity. The discount shrinks because the yield has not changed, 
but there is less time until the face value will be received. If you purchased the bond for 
$23.14 and then sold it after five years for $29.53, the IRR of your investment would be

Example 6.5
Determining the Discount or Premium of a Coupon Bond
Problem
Consider three 30-year bonds with annual coupon payments. One bond has a 10% coupon rate, 
one has a 5% coupon rate, and one has a 3% coupon rate. If the yield to maturity of each bond is 
5%, what is the price of each bond per $100 face value? Which bond trades at a premium, which 
trades at a discount, and which trades at par?
Solution
We can compute the price of each bond using Eq. 6.5. Therefore, the bond prices are
P(10% coupon) = 10 *
1
0.05
 ¢1 -

1.0530 ≤+ 100

1
0.05
 ¢1 -
1
1.0530≤+ 100
1.0530 = $69.26
(trades at a discount)

That is, your return is the same as the yield to maturity of the bond. This example ­illustrates 
a more general property for bonds: If a bond’s yield to maturity has not changed, then the IRR 
of an investment in the bond equals its yield to maturity even if you sell the bond early.
These results also hold for coupon bonds. The pattern of price changes over time is a 
bit more complicated for coupon bonds, however, because as time passes, most of the cash 
flows get closer but some of the cash flows disappear as the coupons get paid. Example 6.6 
illustrates these effects.
Example 6.6
The Effect of Time on the Price of a Coupon Bond
Problem
Consider a 30-year bond with a 10% coupon rate (annual payments) and a $100 face value. 
What is the initial price of this bond if it has a 5% yield to maturity? If the yield to maturity is 
unchanged, what will the price be immediately before and after the first coupon is paid?
Solution
We computed the price of this bond with 30 years to maturity in Example 6.5:
P = 10 *
1
0.05
 ¢1 -
1
1.0530 ≤+ 100
1.0530 = $176.86
Now consider the cash flows of this bond in one year, immediately before the first coupon is 
paid. The bond now has 29 years until it matures, and the timeline is as follows:
Again, we compute the price by discounting the cash flows by the yield to maturity. Note that 
there is a cash flow of $10 at date zero, the coupon that is about to be paid. In this case, we can 
treat the first coupon separately and value the remaining cash flows as in Eq. 6.5:
P (just before first coupon) = 10 + 10 *
1
0.05
 ¢1 -
1
1.0529 ≤+ 100
1.0529 = $185.71
Note that the bond price is higher than it was initially. It will make the same total number of 
coupon payments, but an investor does not need to wait as long to receive the first one. We could 
also compute the price by noting that because the yield to maturity remains at 5% for the bond, 
investors in the bond should earn a return of 5% over the year: $176.86 * 1.05 = $185.71.
What happens to the price of the bond just after the first coupon is paid? The timeline is the 
same as that given earlier, except the new owner of the bond will not receive the coupon at date zero. 
Thus, just after the coupon is paid, the price of the bond (given the same yield to maturity) will be
P (just after first coupon) = 10 *

The price of the bond will drop by the amount of the coupon ($10) immediately after the cou-
pon is paid, reflecting the fact that the owner will no longer receive the coupon. In this case, 
the price is lower than the initial price of the bond. Because there are fewer coupon payments 
remaining, the premium investors will pay for the bond declines. Still, an investor who buys the 
bond initially, receives the first coupon, and then sells it earns a 5% return if the bond’s yield 
does not change: (10 + 175.71)/176.86 = 1.05.

Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
Figure 6.1 illustrates the effect of time on bond prices, assuming the yield to maturity 
remains constant. Between coupon payments, the prices of all bonds rise at a rate equal to the 
yield to maturity as the remaining cash flows of the bond become closer. But as each coupon 
is paid, the price of a bond drops by the amount of the coupon. When the bond is trading at a 
premium, the price drop when a coupon is paid will be larger than the price increase between 
coupons, so the bond’s premium will tend to decline as time passes. If the bond is trading at a 
discount, the price increase between coupons will exceed the drop when a coupon is paid, so 
the bond’s price will rise and its discount will decline as time passes. Ultimately, the prices of 
all bonds approach the bonds’ face value when the bonds mature and their last coupon is paid.
For each of the bonds illustrated in Figure 6.1, if the yield to maturity remains at 5%, 
investors will earn a 5% return on their investment. For the zero-coupon bond, this return 
is earned solely due to the price appreciation of the bond. For the 10% coupon bond, this 
return comes from the combination of coupon payments and price depreciation over time.
Interest Rate Changes and Bond Prices
As interest rates in the economy fluctuate, the yields that investors demand to invest in 
bonds will also change. Let’s evaluate the effect of fluctuations in a bond’s yield to maturity 
on its price.
Consider again a 30-year, zero-coupon bond with a yield to maturity of 5%. For a face 
value of $100, the bond will initially trade for
P(5% yield to maturity) = 100
1.0530 = $23.14
But suppose interest rates suddenly rise so that investors now demand a 6% yield to maturity 
before they will invest in this bond. This change in yield implies that the bond price will fall to
P(6% yield to maturity) = 100
1.0630 = $17.41
Figure 6.1 
The Effect of Time on  
Bond Prices
The graph illustrates the effects 
of the passage of time on bond 
prices when the yield remains 
constant. The price of a zero-
coupon bond rises smoothly. 
The price of a coupon bond also 
rises between coupon payments, 
but tumbles on the coupon date, 
reflecting the amount of the cou-
pon payment. For each coupon 
bond, the gray line shows the 
trend of the bond price just after 
each coupon is paid.

Relative to the initial price, the bond price changes by (17.41 - 23.14)/23.14 = -24.8%, 
a substantial price drop.
This example illustrates a general phenomenon. A higher yield to maturity implies a higher 
discount rate for a bond’s remaining cash flows, reducing their present value and hence the 
bond’s price. Therefore, as interest rates and bond yields rise, bond prices will fall, and vice versa.
The sensitivity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates depends on the timing of its 
cash flows. Because it is discounted over a shorter period, the present value of a cash flow 
that will be received in the near future is less dramatically affected by interest rates than a 
cash flow in the distant future. Thus, shorter-maturity zero-coupon bonds are less sensitive 
to changes in interest rates than are longer-term zero-coupon bonds. Similarly, bonds with 
higher coupon rates—because they pay higher cash flows upfront—are less sensitive to 
interest rate changes than otherwise identical bonds with lower coupon rates. The sensitiv-
ity of a bond’s price to changes in interest rates is measured by the bond’s duration.4 Bonds 
with high durations are highly sensitive to interest rate changes.
4We define duration formally and discuss this concept more thoroughly in Chapter 30.

Problem
Consider a 15-year zero-coupon bond and a 30-year coupon bond with 10% annual coupons. 
By what percentage will the price of each bond change if its yield to maturity increases from 5% 
to 6%?
	
6.2  Dynamic Behavior of Bond Prices	
215
As Figure  6.1 illustrates, coupon bond prices fluctuate 
around the time of each coupon payment in a sawtooth pat-
tern: The value of the coupon bond rises as the next coupon 
payment gets closer and then drops after it has been paid. 
This fluctuation occurs even if there is no change in the 
bond’s yield to maturity.
Because bond traders are more concerned about changes 
in the bond’s price that arise due to changes in the bond’s 
yield, rather than these predictable patterns around coupon 
payments, they often do not quote the price of a bond in 
terms of its actual cash price, which is also called the dirty 
price or invoice price of the bond. Instead, bonds are often 
quoted in terms of a clean price, which is the bond’s cash 
price less an adjustment for accrued interest, the amount of 
the next coupon payment that has already accrued:
Clean price = Cash (dirty) price - Accrued interest
Accrued interest = Coupon amount *
¢
Days since last coupon payment
Days in current coupon period ≤
Note that immediately before a coupon payment is made, 
the accrued interest will equal the full amount of the cou-
pon, whereas immediately after the coupon payment is 
made, the accrued interest will be zero. Thus, accrued inter-
est will rise and fall in a sawtooth pattern as each coupon 
payment passes:
As Figure 6.1 demonstrates, the bonds cash price also has 
a sawtooth pattern. So if we subtract accrued interest from 
the bond’s cash price and compute the clean price, the saw-
tooth pattern of the cash price is eliminated. Thus, absent 
changes in the bond’s yield to maturity, its clean price con-
verges smoothly over time to the bond’s face value, as shown 
in the gray lines in Figure 6.1.

Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
Solution
First, we compute the price of each bond for each yield to maturity:
The price of the 15-year zero-coupon bond changes by (41.73 - 48.10)/48.10 = -13.2% if its 
yield to maturity increases from 5% to 6%. For the 30-year bond with 10% annual coupons, 
the price change is (155.06 - 176.86)/176.86 = -12.3%. Even though the 30-year bond has 
a longer maturity, because of its high coupon rate, its sensitivity to a change in yield is actually 
less than that of the 15-year zero coupon bond.

In actuality, bond prices are subject to the effects of both the passage of time and changes in 
interest rates. Bond prices converge to the bond’s face value due to the time effect, but simulta-
neously move up and down due to unpredictable changes in bond yields. Figure 6.2 illustrates 

this behavior by demonstrating how the price of the 30-year, zero-coupon bond might change 
over its life. Note that the bond price tends to converge to the face value as the bond approaches 
the maturity date, but also moves higher when its yield falls and lower when its yield rises.
As Figure 6.2 demonstrates, prior to maturity the bond is exposed to interest rate risk. If 
an investor chooses to sell and the bond’s yield to maturity has decreased, then the investor 
will receive a high price and earn a high return. If the yield to maturity has increased, the 
bond price is low at the time of sale and the investor will earn a low return. In the appendix 
to this chapter, we discuss one way corporations manage this type of risk.

6.3	 The Yield Curve and Bond Arbitrage
Thus far, we have focused on the relationship between the price of an individual bond and 
its yield to maturity. In this section, we explore the relationship between the prices and 
yields of different bonds. Using the Law of One Price, we show that given the spot interest 
rates, which are the yields of default-free zero-coupon bonds, we can determine the price 
and yield of any other default-free bond. As a result, the yield curve provides sufficient 
information to evaluate all such bonds.
Replicating a Coupon Bond
Because it is possible to replicate the cash flows of a coupon bond using zero-coupon 
bonds, we can use the Law of One Price to compute the price of a coupon bond from the 
prices of zero-coupon bonds. For example, we can replicate a three-year, $1000 bond that 
pays 10% annual coupons using three zero-coupon bonds as follows:

We match each coupon payment to a zero-coupon bond with a face value equal to the 
coupon payment and a term equal to the time remaining to the coupon date. Similarly, we 
match the final bond payment (final coupon plus return of face value) in three years to a 
three-year, zero-coupon bond with a corresponding face value of $1100. Because the cou-
pon bond cash flows are identical to the cash flows of the portfolio of zero-coupon bonds, 
the Law of One Price states that the price of the portfolio of zero-coupon bonds must be 
the same as the price of the coupon bond.

218	
Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
To illustrate, assume that current zero-coupon bond yields and prices are as shown in 
Table 6.2 (they are the same as in Example 6.1). We can calculate the cost of the zero-
coupon bond portfolio that replicates the three-year coupon bond as follows:

By the Law of One Price, the three-year coupon bond must trade for a price of $1153. If 
the price of the coupon bond were higher, you could earn an arbitrage profit by selling the 
coupon bond and buying the zero-coupon bond portfolio. If the price of the coupon bond 
were lower, you could earn an arbitrage profit by buying the coupon bond and short selling 
the zero-coupon bonds.
Valuing a Coupon Bond Using Zero-Coupon Yields
To this point, we have used the zero-coupon bond prices to derive the price of the coupon 
bond. Alternatively, we can use the zero-coupon bond yields. Recall that the yield to matu-
rity of a zero-coupon bond is the competitive market interest rate for a risk-free investment 
with a term equal to the term of the zero-coupon bond. Therefore, the price of a coupon 
bond must equal the present value of its coupon payments and face value discounted at the 
competitive market interest rates (see Eq. 5.7 in Chapter 5):
Price of a Coupon Bond
P = PV(Bond Cash Flows)
	
=
CPN
1 + YTM1
+
CPN
(1 + YTM2)2 + g + CPN + FV
(1 + YTMn)n
(6.6)
where CPN is the bond coupon payment, YTMn is the yield to maturity of a zero-coupon 
bond that matures at the same time as the nth coupon payment, and FV is the face value of 
the bond. For the three-year, $1000 bond with 10% annual coupons considered earlier, we 
can use Eq. 6.6 to calculate its price using the zero-coupon yields in Table 6.2:
P = 100
1.035 + 100
1.042 + 100 + 1000
1.0453
= $1153
This price is identical to the price we computed earlier by replicating the bond. Thus, we 
can determine the no-arbitrage price of a coupon bond by discounting its cash flows using 
the zero-coupon yields. In other words, the information in the zero-coupon yield curve is 
sufficient to price all other risk-free bonds.

Coupon Bond Yields
Given the yields for zero-coupon bonds, we can use Eq. 6.6 to price a coupon bond. In 
Section 6.1, we saw how to compute the yield to maturity of a coupon bond from its price. 
Combining these results, we can determine the relationship between the yields of zero-
coupon bonds and coupon-paying bonds.
Consider again the three-year, $1000 bond with 10% annual coupons. Given the zero-
coupon yields in Table 6.2, we calculate a price for this bond of $1153. From Eq. 6.5, the 
yield to maturity of this bond is the rate y that satisfies
P = 1153 =
100
(1 + y) +
100
(1 + y)2 + 100 + 1000
(1 + y)3
We can solve for the yield by using the annuity spreadsheet:
Therefore, the yield to maturity of the bond is 4.44%. We can check this result directly as 
follows:
P =
100
1.0444 +
100
1.04442 + 100 + 1000
1.04443
= $1153
Because the coupon bond provides cash flows at different points in time, the yield to 
maturity of a coupon bond is a weighted average of the yields of the zero-coupon bonds of 
equal and shorter maturities. The weights depend (in a complex way) on the magnitude 
of the cash flows each period. In this example, the zero-coupon bonds’ yields were 3.5%, 
4.0%, and 4.5%. For this coupon bond, most of the value in the present value calculation 
comes from the present value of the third cash flow because it includes the principal, so the 
yield is closest to the three-year, zero-coupon yield of 4.5%.

Given the following zero-coupon yields, compare the yield to maturity for a three-year, zero-

bond with 10% annual coupons. All of these bonds are default free.
Solution
From the information provided, the yield to maturity of the three-year, zero-coupon bond is 
4.50%. Also, because the yields match those in Table 6.2, we already calculated the yield to 
maturity for the 10% coupon bond as 4.44%. To compute the yield for the 4% coupon bond, 
we first need to calculate its price. Using Eq. 6.6, we have

Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
Example 6.8 shows that coupon bonds with the same maturity can have different yields 
depending on their coupon rates. As the coupon increases, earlier cash flows become rela-
tively more important than later cash flows in the calculation of the present value. If the 
yield curve is upward sloping (as it is for the yields in Example 6.8), the resulting yield to 
maturity decreases with the coupon rate of the bond. Alternatively, when the zero-coupon 
yield curve is downward sloping, the yield to maturity will increase with the coupon rate. 
When the yield curve is flat, all zero-coupon and coupon-paying bonds will have the same 
yield, independent of their maturities and coupon rates.
Treasury Yield Curves
As we have shown in this section, we can use the zero-coupon yield curve to determine 
the price and yield to maturity of other risk-free bonds. The plot of the yields of coupon 
bonds of different maturities is called the coupon-paying yield curve. When U.S. bond 
traders refer to “the yield curve,” they are often referring to the coupon-paying Treasury 
yield curve. As we showed in Example 6.8, two coupon-paying bonds with the same matu-
rity may have different yields. By convention, practitioners always plot the yield of the 
most recently issued bonds, termed the on-the-run bonds. Using similar methods to those 
employed in this section, we can apply the Law of One Price to determine the zero-coupon 
bond yields using the coupon-paying yield curve (see Problem 25). Thus, either type of 
yield curve provides enough information to value all other risk-free bonds.

So far in this chapter, we have focused on default-free bonds such as U.S. Treasury securi-
ties, for which the cash flows are known with certainty. For other bonds such as corporate 
bonds (bonds issued by corporations), the issuer may default—that is, it might not pay back 
The price of the bond with a 4% coupon is $986.98. From Eq. 6.5, its yield to maturity solves

the full amount promised in the bond prospectus. This risk of default, which is known as 
the credit risk of the bond, means that the bond’s cash flows are not known with certainty.
Corporate Bond Yields
How does credit risk affect bond prices and yields? Because the cash flows promised by the bond 
are the most that bondholders can hope to receive, the cash flows that a purchaser of a bond 
with credit risk expects to receive may be less than that amount. As a result, investors pay less for 
bonds with credit risk than they would for an otherwise identical default-free bond. Because the 
yield to maturity for a bond is calculated using the promised cash flows, the yield of bonds with 
credit risk will be higher than that of otherwise identical default-free bonds. Let’s illustrate the 
effect of credit risk on bond yields and investor returns by comparing different cases.
No Default.  Suppose that the one-year, zero-coupon Treasury bill has a yield to maturity 
of 4%. What are the price and yield of a one-year, $1000, zero-coupon bond issued by 
Avant Corporation? First, suppose that all investors agree that there is no possibility that 
Avant will default within the next year. In that case, investors will receive $1000 in one 
year for certain, as promised by the bond. Because this bond is risk free, the Law of One 
Price guarantees that it must have the same yield as the one-year, zero-coupon Treasury 
bill. The price of the bond will therefore be
P =
1000
1 + YTM1
= 1000
1.04 = $961.54
Certain Default.  Now suppose that investors believe that Avant will default with ­certainty 
at the end of one year and will be able to pay only 90% of its outstanding ­obligations. Then, 
even though the bond promises $1000 at year-end, bondholders know they will receive only 
$900. Investors can predict this shortfall perfectly, so the $900 payment is risk free, and the 
bond is still a one-year risk-free investment. Therefore, we compute the price of the bond by 
discounting this cash flow using the risk-free interest rate as the cost of capital:
P =
900
1 + YTM1
= 900
1.04 = $865.38
The prospect of default lowers the cash flow investors expect to receive and hence the price 
they are willing to pay.

221
Are Treasuries Really Default-Free Securities?
Most investors treat U.S. Treasury securities as risk free, mean-
ing that they believe there is no chance of default (a conven-
tion we follow in this book). But are Treasuries really risk free? 
The answer depends on what you mean by “risk free.”
No one can be certain that the U.S. government will 
never default on its bonds—but most people believe the 
probability of such an event is very small. More importantly, 
the default probability is smaller than for any other bond. 
So saying that the yield on a U.S. Treasury security is risk 
free really means that the Treasury security is the lowest-risk 
investment denominated in U.S. dollars in the world.
That said, there have been occasions in the past where 
Treasury holders did not receive exactly what they were 
promised: In 1790, Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton 
lowered the interest rate on outstanding debt and in 1933 
President Franklin Roosevelt suspended bondholders’ right 
to be paid in gold rather than currency.
A new risk emerged in mid-2011 when a series of large 
budget deficits brought the United States up against the debt 
ceiling, a constraint imposed by Congress limiting the overall 
amount of debt the government can incur. An act of Con-
gress was required by August 2011 for the Treasury to meet 
its obligations and avoid a default. In response to the political 
uncertainty about whether Congress would raise the ceiling 
in time, Standard & Poor’s downgraded its rating of U.S. 
Government bonds. Congress ultimately raised the debt ceil-
ing and no default occurred. Given persistent budget deficits, 
however, similar debt ceiling debates recurred in 2013 and 
2015. These incidents serve as a reminder that perhaps no 
investment is truly “risk free.”

222	
Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
Given the bond’s price, we can compute the bond’s yield to maturity. When computing 
this yield, we use the promised rather than the actual cash flows. Thus,
YTM = FV
P - 1 = 1000
865.38 - 1 = 15.56%
The 15.56% yield to maturity of Avant’s bond is much higher than the yield to maturity 
of the default-free Treasury bill. But this result does not mean that investors who buy the 
bond will earn a 15.56% return. Because Avant will default, the expected return of the 
bond equals its 4% cost of capital:
900
865.38 = 1.04
Note that the yield to maturity of a defaultable bond exceeds the expected return of investing 
in the bond. Because we calculate the yield to maturity using the promised cash flows rather 
than the expected cash flows, the yield will always be higher than the expected return of 
investing in the bond.
Risk of Default.  The two Avant examples were extreme cases, of course. In the first case, 
we assumed the probability of default was zero; in the second case, we assumed Avant 
would definitely default. In reality, the chance that Avant will default lies somewhere in 
between these two extremes (and for most firms, is probably much closer to zero).
To illustrate, again consider the one-year, $1000, zero-coupon bond issued by Avant. 
This time, assume that the bond payoffs are uncertain. In particular, there is a 50% chance 
that the bond will repay its face value in full and a 50% chance that the bond will default 
and you will receive $900. Thus, on average, you will receive $950.
To determine the price of this bond, we must discount this expected cash flow using a 
cost of capital equal to the expected return of other securities with equivalent risk. If, like 
most firms, Avant is more likely to default if the economy is weak than if the economy is 
strong, then—as we demonstrated in Chapter 3—investors will demand a risk premium 
to invest in this bond. That is, Avant’s debt cost of capital, which is the expected return 
Avant’s debt holders will require to compensate them for the risk of the bond’s cash flows, 
will be higher than the 4% risk-free interest rate.
Let’s suppose investors demand a risk premium of 1.1% for this bond, so that the appro-
priate cost of capital is 5.1%.5 Then the present value of the bond’s cash flow is
P = 950
1.051 = $903.90
Consequently, in this case the bond’s yield to maturity is 10.63%:
YTM = FV
P - 1 = 1000
903.90 - 1 = 10.63%
Of course, the 10.63% promised yield is the most investors will receive. If Avant defaults, 
they will receive only $900, for a return of 900/903.90 - 1 = -0.43%. The average 
return is 0.50(10.63%) + 0.50(-0.43%) = 5.1%, the bond’s cost of capital.
Table 6.3 summarizes the prices, expected return, and yield to maturity of the Avant 
bond under the various default assumptions. Note that the bond’s price decreases, and 
its yield to maturity increases, with a greater likelihood of default. Conversely, the bond’s 
expected return, which is equal to the firm’s debt cost of capital, is less than the yield to maturity

if there is a risk of default. Moreover, a higher yield to maturity does not necessarily imply that 
a bond’s expected return is higher.
Bond Ratings
It would be both difficult and inefficient for every investor to privately investigate the default 
risk of every bond. Consequently, several companies rate the creditworthiness of bonds and 
make this information available to investors. The two best-known bond-rating companies 
are Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Table 6.4 summarizes the rating classes each company 
uses. Bonds with the highest rating are judged to be least likely to default. By consulting

Bond Ratings
Rating*
Description (Moody’s)
Investment Grade Debt
Aaa/AAA
Judged to be of the best quality. They carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as “gilt 
edged.” Interest payments are protected by a large or an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the 
various protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the  
fundamentally strong position of such issues.
Aa/AA
Judged to be of high quality by all standards. Together with the Aaa group, they constitute what are generally known as 
high-grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of ­protection may not be as large as in Aaa 
securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present that 
make the long-term risk appear somewhat larger than the Aaa securities.
A/A
Possess many favorable investment attributes and are considered as upper-medium-grade obligations. ­Factors giving  
security to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present that suggest a susceptibility to 
impairment some time in the future.
Baa/BBB
Are considered as medium-grade obligations (i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured). Interest payments 
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be character-
istically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds lack ­outstanding investment characteristics and, in fact, have 
speculative characteristics as well.
Speculative Bonds
Ba/BB
Judged to have speculative elements; their future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the ­protection of interest 
and principal payments may be very moderate, and thereby not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the 
future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class.
B/B
Generally lack characteristics of the desirable investment. Assurance of interest and principal payments of maintenance of 
other terms of the contract over any long period of time may be small.
Caa/CCC
Are of poor standing. Such issues may be in default or there may be present elements of danger with respect to principal 
or interest.
Ca/CC
Are speculative in a high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other marked shortcomings.
C/C, D
Lowest-rated class of bonds, and issues so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever attaining any 
real investment standing.

these ratings, investors can assess the creditworthiness of a particular bond issue. The ratings 
therefore encourage widespread investor participation and relatively liquid markets.
Bonds in the top four categories are often referred to as investment-grade bonds because 
of their low default risk. Bonds in the bottom five categories are often called ­speculative 
bonds, junk bonds, or high-yield bonds because their likelihood of default is high. The 
rating depends on the risk of bankruptcy as well as the bondholders’ ability to lay claim to 
the firm’s assets in the event of such a bankruptcy. Thus, debt issues with a low-priority claim 
in bankruptcy will have a lower rating than issues from the same company that have a high- 
priority claim in bankruptcy or that are backed by a specific asset such as a building or a plant.
Corporate Yield Curves
Just as we can construct a yield curve from risk-free Treasury securities, we can plot a simi-
lar yield curve for corporate bonds. Figure 6.3 shows the average yields of U.S. corporate 
coupon bonds rated AAA or A, as well as the U.S. (coupon-paying) Treasury yield curve. 
We refer to the difference between the yields of the corporate bonds and the ­Treasury yields 
as the default spread or credit spread. Credit spreads fluctuate as perceptions regarding 
the probability of default change. Note that the credit spread is high for bonds with low 
ratings and therefore a greater likelihood of default.

6.5	 Sovereign Bonds
Sovereign bonds are bonds issued by national governments. We have, of course, already 
encountered an example of a sovereign bond—U.S. Treasury securities. But while U.S. 
Treasuries are generally considered to be default free, the same cannot be said for bonds 
issued by many other countries. Until recently, sovereign bond default was considered

that spreads of even the highest-rated Aaa bonds increased 
­dramatically, from a typical level of 0.5% to over 2% by 
the fall of 2008. Panel B shows a similar pattern for the 
rate banks had to pay on short-term loans compared to 
the yields of short-term Treasury bills. This increase in 
borrowing costs made it more costly for firms to raise 
the capital needed for new investment, slowing economic 
growth. The decline in these spreads in early 2009 was 
viewed by many as an important first step in mitigating 
the ongoing impact of the financial crisis on the rest of 
the economy. Note, however, the 2012 increase in spreads 
in the wake of the European debt crisis and consequent 
economic uncertainty.
The financial crisis that engulfed the world’s economies 
in 2008 originated as a credit crisis that first emerged in 
August 2007. At that time, problems in the mortgage 
market had led to the bankruptcy of several large mort-
gage lenders. The default of these firms, and the down-
grading of many of the bonds backed by mortgages these 
firms had originated, caused investors to reassess the risk 
of other bonds in their portfolios. As perceptions of risk 
increased and investors attempted to move into safer U.S. 
Treasury securities, the prices of corporate bonds fell 
and so their credit spreads rose relative to Treasuries, as 
shown in ­Figure 6.4. Panel A of the figure shows the yield 
spreads for long-term corporate bonds, where we can see

an emerging market phenomenon. The experience with Greek government bonds served 
as a wake-up call to investors that governments in the developed world can also default. In 
2012, Greece defaulted and wrote off over $100 billion, or about 50%, of its outstanding 
debt, in the largest sovereign debt restructuring in world history (analyzed in the data case 
at the end of this chapter). Unfortunately, the restructuring did not solve the problem. 
Three years later, in 2015, Greece became the first developed country to default on an 
IMF loan when it failed to make a $1.7 billion payment. Later that year, Greece nar-
rowly averted another default (this time to the European Central Bank) when its Eurozone 
partners put together an €86 billion bailout package that provided the funds to make the 
required bond payments. And Greece is far from unique—as Figure 6.5 shows, there have 
been periods when more than one-third of all debtor nations were either in default or 
restructuring their debt.
Because most sovereign debt is risky, the prices and yields of sovereign debt behave 
much like corporate debt: The bonds issued by countries with high probabilities of default 
have high yields and low prices. That said, there is a key difference between sovereign 
default and corporate default.
Unlike a corporation, a country facing difficulty meeting its financial obligations typi-
cally has the option to print additional currency to pay its debts. Of course, doing so is 
likely to lead to high inflation and a sharp devaluation of the currency. Consequently, debt 
holders carefully consider inflation expectations when determining the yield they are will-
ing to accept because they understand that they may be repaid in money that is worth less 
than it was when the bonds were issued.
For most countries, the option to “inflate away” the debt is politically preferable to 
an outright default. That said, defaults do occur, either because the necessary inflation/

European Sovereign Debt  Yields: A Puzzle
countries would be fiscally responsible and manage their 
debt obligations to avoid default at all costs. But as illus-
trated by Figure 6.6, once the 2008 financial crisis revealed 
the folly of this assumption, debt yields once again diverged 
as investors acknowledged the likelihood that some coun-
tries (particularly Portugal and Ireland) might be unable to 
repay their debt and would be forced to default.
In retrospect, rather than bringing fiscal responsibility, 
the monetary union allowed the weaker member countries 
to borrow at dramatically lower rates. In response, these 
countries reacted by increasing their borrowing––and at 
least in Greece’s case, borrowed to the point that default 
became inevitable.
Before the EMU created the euro as a single European cur-
rency, the yields of sovereign debt issued by European coun-
tries varied widely. These variations primarily reflected 
differences in inflation expectations and currency risk (see 
­Figure 6.6). However, after the monetary union was put in 
place at the end of 1998, the yields all essentially converged to 
the yield on German government bonds. Investors seemed to 
conclude that there was little distinction between the debt of 
the European countries in the union––they seemed to feel that 
all countries in the union were essentially exposed to the same 
default, inflation and currency risk and thus equally “safe.”
Presumably, investors believed that an outright default 
was unthinkable: They apparently believed that member

(for example, Russian Tsarist debt became worthless paper after the 1917 revolution).
European sovereign debt is an interesting special case. Member states of the European Eco-
nomic and Monetary Union (EMU) all share a common currency, the euro, and so have ceded 
control of their money supply to the European Central Bank (ECB). As a result, no individual

­Zombanakis Professor of the International 
Financial System at the John F. Kennedy 
School of Government, Harvard University. 
She is co-author of the award- winning 
book This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of 
Financial Folly, which documents the strik-
ing similarities of the recurring booms and 
busts characterizing financial history.
QUESTION: Is Europe’s sovereign debt crisis 
an anomaly in the developed world?
ANSWER: There is a long history of sov-
ereign debt crises in the developed world. 
Each time prior to the crisis people justi-
fied their actions with “this time is dif-
ferent.” Two years ago no one thought 
Greece could default because it was in Europe. In fact, 
Greece has been in default 48% of the time since 1830. 
Before World War II, defaults, restructurings, and forced 
conversions among advanced economies were not rare. 
Post-World War II, sovereign debt defaults and restructur-
ings have been largely confined to emerging markets such 
as Chile, Argentina, Peru, Nigeria, and Indonesia, lead-
ing people to the false assumption that debt crises were a  
developing market phenomena.
QUESTION: Prior to the 2008/9 financial crisis, the yield 
spreads on sovereign debt issued by Eurozone countries were 
very narrow, seeming to indicate that investors believed that 
the debt was equally safe. Why would investors come to this 
conclusion?
ANSWER: Economic and financial indicators in both 
advanced economies and emerging markets indicate that 
interest rate spreads are not good predictors of future 
debt rates. My earlier work with Graciela Kaminsky of 
early warnings supported this conclusion. Often public 
and private debt builds up but the spreads do not reflect 
the added risk. During the boom period, Eurozone coun-
tries had very low spreads and very strong credit ratings. 
Yet the underlying domestic fundamentals did not sup-
port these signals of financial health. People convinced 
themselves that the world was different.
Also, looking exclusively at rising sovereign debt 
levels can be deceptive. History has shown that private 
debts before a crisis become public afterwards. In the 
early 1980s, Chile had a fiscal surplus and still it had 
a massive debt crisis. In Ireland and 
Spain in the late 2000s, public debt was 
under control, but private sector debt, 
which carried an implicit guarantee, was 
skyrocketing.
QUESTION: Since the financial crisis these 
yields have diverged. What has changed and 
why?
ANSWER: People found out that the 
world was not different; that is, the coun-
tries in Europe were not equally risky. 
Financial crises adversely affect public 
finances—what starts as a financial cri-
sis morphs into banking and sovereign 
debt crises. Financial crises related to 
­recessions are deeper and more protracted 
than normal recessions, creating enor-
mous problems because, even after fiscal stimulus, rev-
enues collapse. In addition, governments take on private 
debt to circumvent a financial meltdown. In the U.S., 
FNMA and Freddie Mac moved from the private sector 
balance sheet before the crisis to the public sector balance 
sheet afterwards. In Ireland and Spain, public debt became 
bloated as the governments took on the debts of banks. 
In the aftermath of the 2007–2008 crisis, the slew of 
simultaneous crises in advanced economies limited oppor-
tunities to grow out of crisis (for example, by increasing 
exports).
QUESTION: What’s next for Europe? Could the same thing 
happen in the United States?
ANSWER: I think Europe’s prospects will remain fairly 
­dismal for a while. Europe has been moving very slowly, 
if at all, to address the implications of its huge debt—­
deleveraging takes a very long time and is painful.
The United States has many of the same issues. While 
a U.S. Treasury default is unlikely, I do not believe that the 
currently low Treasury debt yields imply that the U.S. fun-
damentals are good. Treasury debt yields are low because 
of massive official intervention—the Fed and other central 
banks are buying Treasuries to prevent their currencies 
from appreciating and to keep their borrowing rates low. 
This kind of government intervention following a crisis 
is ­common. It is why recovery takes so long. Historically, 
lackluster GDP growth lasts 23 years on average follow-
ing a financial crisis, and is a dark cloud over U.S. growth 
prospects.

Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
6.1  Bond Cash Flows, Prices, and Yields
	
n	 Bonds pay both coupon and principal or face value payments to investors. By convention, 
the coupon rate of a bond is expressed as an APR, so the amount of each coupon payment, 
CPN, is
	
CPN =
Coupon Rate * Face Value
Number of Coupon Payments per Year	
(6.1)
	
n	 Zero-coupon bonds make no coupon payments, so investors receive only the bond’s face value.
	
n	 The internal rate of return of a bond is called its yield to maturity (or yield). The yield to matu-
rity of a bond is the discount rate that sets the present value of the promised bond payments 
equal to the current market price of the bond.
	
n	 The yield to maturity for a zero-coupon bond is given by
	
YTMn = ¢ FV
P ≤
1/n
- 1
(6.3)
	
n	 The risk-free interest rate for an investment until date n equals the yield to maturity of a risk-
free zero-coupon bond that matures on date n. A plot of these rates against maturity is called 
the zero-coupon yield curve.
	
n	 The yield to maturity for a coupon bond is the discount rate, y, that equates the present value 
of the bond’s future cash flows with its price:
	
P = CPN * 1
y
 ¢1 -
1
(1 + y)N≤+
FV
(1 + y)N 	
(6.5)
6.2  Dynamic Behavior of Bond Prices
	
n	 A bond will trade at a premium if its coupon rate exceeds its yield to maturity. It will trade at 
a discount if its coupon rate is less than its yield to maturity. If a bond’s coupon rate equals its 
yield to maturity, it trades at par.
	
n	 As a bond approaches maturity, the price of the bond approaches its face value.
	
n	 If the bond’s yield to maturity has not changed, then the IRR of an investment in a bond equals 
its yield to maturity even if you sell the bond early.
country can simply print money to make debt payments. Furthermore, when the ECB does 
print money to help pay one country’s debt, the subsequent inflation affects all citizens in the 
union, effectively forcing citizens in one country to shoulder the debt burden of another coun-
try. Because individual countries do not have discretion to inflate away their debt, default is 
a real possibility within the EMU. This risk became tangible in 2012 and again in 2015 with 
Greece’s multiple defaults.
Concept Check	
1.	 Why do sovereign debt yields differ across countries?
	
2.	 What options does a country have if it decides it cannot meet its debt obligations?

	
n	 Bond prices change as interest rates change. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and vice 
versa.
n	 Long-term zero-coupon bonds are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than are short-
term zero-coupon bonds.
n	 Bonds with low coupon rates are more sensitive to changes in interest rates than similar 
maturity bonds with high coupon rates.
n	 The duration of a bond measures the sensitivity of its price to changes in interest rates.
6.3  The Yield Curve and Bond Arbitrage
	
n	 Because we can replicate a coupon-paying bond using a portfolio of zero-coupon bonds, the 
price of a coupon-paying bond can be determined based on the zero-coupon yield curve using 
the Law of One Price:
P = PV(Bond Cash Flows)
	
=
CPN
1 + YTM1
+
CPN
(1 + YTM2)2 + g + CPN + FV
(1 + YTMn)n
(6.6)
	
n	 When the yield curve is not flat, bonds with the same maturity but different coupon rates will 
have different yields to maturity.
6.4  Corporate Bonds
	
n	 When a bond issuer does not make a bond payment in full, the issuer has defaulted.
n	 The risk that default can occur is called default or credit risk.
n	 U.S. Treasury securities are generally considered free of default risk.
	
n	 The expected return of a corporate bond, which is the firm’s debt cost of capital, equals the 
risk-free rate of interest plus a risk premium. The expected return is less than the bond’s yield 
to maturity because the yield to maturity of a bond is calculated using the promised cash flows, 
not the expected cash flows.
	
n	 Bond ratings summarize the creditworthiness of bonds for investors.
	
n	 The difference between yields on Treasury securities and yields on corporate bonds is called 
the credit spread or default spread. The credit spread compensates investors for the difference 
between promised and expected cash flows and for the risk of default.
6.5  Sovereign Bonds
	
n	 Sovereign bonds are issued by national governments.
	
n	 Sovereign bond yields reflect investor expectations of inflation, currency, and default risk.
	
n	 Countries may repay their debt by printing additional currency, which generally leads to a rise 
in inflation and a sharp currency devaluation.
	
n	 When “inflating away” the debt is infeasible or politically unattractive, countries may choose to 
default on their debt.

J. Zettelmeyer, C. Trebesch, and M. Gulati, Economic Policy (July 2013) 513–563. For pedagogical 
reasons, some details of the bond issues were changed marginally to simplify the calculations.
	
1.	 Begin by finding the current U.S. Treasury yield curve. At the Treasury Web site (www.treas.gov), 
search using the term “yield curve” and select “Historic Yield Data.” Click on “View Text Version of 
Treasury Yield Curve.” The correct link is likely to be the first link on the page. Download that table 
into Excel by right clicking with the cursor in the table and selecting “Export to Microsoft Excel.”
	
2.	 Find the current yield spreads for the various bond ratings. Unfortunately, the current spreads are 
available only for a fee, so you will use old ones. Go to BondsOnline (www.bondsonline.com) 
and click “Today’s Market.” Next, click “Corporate Bond Spreads.” Download this table to Excel 
and copy and paste it to the same file as the Treasury yields.
	
3.	 Find the current bond rating for Sirius. Go to Standard & Poor’s Web site (www.standardandpoors
.com). Select “Find a Rating” from the list at the left of the page, then select “Credit Ratings 
Search.” At this point, you will have to register (it’s free) or enter the username and password pro-
vided by your instructor. Next, you will be able to search by Organization Name—enter Sirius and 
select Sirius XM Radio. Use the credit rating for the organization, not the specific issue ratings.
	
4.	 Return to Excel and create a timeline with the cash flows and discount rates you will need to 
value the new bond issue.
a.	 To create the required spot rates for Sirius’ issue, add the appropriate spread to the Treasury 
yield of the same maturity.
b.	 The yield curve and spread rates you have found do not cover every year that you will need for 
the new bonds. Fill these in by linearly interpolating the given yields and spreads. For example, 
the four-year spot rate and spread will be the average of the three- and five-year rates.
c.	 To compute the spot rates for Sirius’ current debt rating, add the yield spread to the ­Treasury 
rate for each maturity. However, note that the spread is in basis points, which are 1/100th of 
a percentage point.
d.	Compute the cash flows that would be paid to bondholders each year and add them to the 
timeline.
	
5.	 Use the spot rates to calculate the present value of each cash flow paid to the bondholders.
	
6.	 Compute the issue price of the bond and its initial yield to maturity.
	
7.	 Repeat Steps 4–6 based on the assumption that Sirius is able to raise its bond rating by one level. 
Compute the new yield based on the higher rating and the new bond price that would result.
	
8.	 Compute the additional cash proceeds that could be raised from the issue if the rating were 
improved.

Case Study
The 2012 Greek Default and Subsequent Debt Restructuring6
In March and April 2012 Greece defaulted on its debt by swapping its outstanding obligations for 
new obligations of much lesser face value. For each euro of face value outstanding, a holder of Greek 
debt was given the following securities with an issue date of 12 March 2012.
	
n	 Two European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF) notes. Each note had a face value of 7.5¢. The 
first note paid an annual coupon (on the anniversary of the issue date) of 0.4% and matured 
on 12 March 2013. The second note paid an annual coupon of 1% and matured on 12 March 
2014.
	
n	 A series of bonds issued by the Greek government with a combined face value of 31.5¢. 
The simplest way to characterize these bonds is as a single bond paying an annual coupon 

	
Case Study	
237
(on December 12 of each year) of 2% for years 2012–2015, 3% for years 2016–2020, 3.65% 
for 2021, and 4.3% thereafter. Principal is repaid in 20 equal installments (that is, 5% of face 
value) in December in the years 2023–2042.
	
n	 Other securities that were worth little.
An important feature of this swap is that the same deal was offered to all investors, regardless of 
which bonds they were holding. That meant that the loss to different investors was not the same. 
To understand why, begin by calculating the present value of what every investor received. For sim-
plicity, assume that the coupons on the EFSF notes were issued at market rates so they traded at 
par. Next, put all the promised payments of the bond series on a timeline. Figure 6.7 shows the 
imputed yields on Greek debt that prevailed after the debt swap was announced. Assume the yields 
in ­Figure 6.7 are yields on zero coupon bonds maturing in the 23 years following the debt swap, and 
use them to calculate the present value of all promised payments on March 12, 2012.
Next, consider 2 different bonds that were outstanding before the default (there were a total of 117 
different securities).
	
n	 A Greek government bond maturing on March 12, 2012
	
n	 A Greek government 4.7% annual coupon bond maturing on March 12, 2024.
Using the yields in Figure 6.7, calculate the value of each existing bond as a fraction of face value. 
Bondholders of both existing bonds received the same package of new bonds in exchange for their 
existing bonds. In each case calculate the haircut, that is, the amount of the loss (as a fraction of the 
original bonds’ face value) that was sustained when the existing bonds were replaced with the new 
bonds. Which investors took a larger haircut, long-term or short-term bondholders?
Assume that participation in the swap was voluntary (as was claimed at the time), so that on the 
announcement the price of the existing bonds equaled the value of the new bonds. Using this equiv-
alence, calculate the yield to maturity of the existing bond that matured in 2024. What might 
explain the difference between this yield and the yields in Figure 6.7?

Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
Forward Interest Rates
chapter 6 
appendix
Given the risk associated with interest rate changes, corporate managers require tools to 
help manage this risk. One of the most important is the interest rate forward contract, 
which is a type of swap contract. An interest rate forward contract (also called a forward 
rate agreement) is a contract today that fixes the interest rate for a loan or investment in 
the future. In this appendix, we explain how to derive forward interest rates from zero-
coupon yields.
Computing Forward Rates
A forward interest rate (or forward rate) is an interest rate that we can guarantee today 
for a loan or investment that will occur in the future. Throughout this section, we will 
consider interest rate forward contracts for one-year investments; thus, when we refer to 
the forward rate for year 5, we mean the rate available today on a one-year investment that 
begins four years from today and is repaid five years from today.
We can use the Law of One Price to calculate the forward rate from the zero-coupon 
yield curve. The forward rate for year 1 is the rate on an investment that starts today and 
is repaid in one year; it is equivalent to an investment in a one-year, zero-coupon bond. 
Therefore, by the Law of One Price, these rates must coincide:
	
f1 = YTM1	
(6A.1)
Now consider the two-year forward rate. Suppose the one-year, zero-coupon yield is 
5.5% and the two-year, zero-coupon yield is 7%. There are two ways to invest money risk 
free for two years. First, we can invest in the two-year, zero-coupon bond at rate of 7% 
and earn $(1.07)2 after two years per dollar invested. Second, we can invest in the one-
year bond at a rate of 5.5%, which will pay $1.055 at the end of one year, and simultane-
ously guarantee the interest rate we will earn by reinvesting the $1.055 for the second year 
by entering into an interest rate forward contract for year 2 at rate f2. In that case, we will 
earn $(1.055)(1 + f2) at the end of two years. Because both strategies are risk free, by the 
Law of One Price, they must have the same return:
(1.07)2 = (1.055)(1 + f2)
Rearranging, we have
(1 + f2) = 1.072
1.055 = 1.0852
Therefore, in this case the forward rate for year 2 is f2 = 8.52%.
In general, we can compute the forward rate for year n by comparing an investment 
in an n-year, zero-coupon bond to an investment in an (n - 1) year, zero-coupon 
bond, with the interest rate earned in the nth year being guaranteed through an inter-
est rate forward contract. Because both strategies are risk free, they must have the same 
payoff or else an arbitrage opportunity would be available. Comparing the payoffs of 
these strategies, we have
(1 + YTMn)n = (1 + YTMn-1)n-1(1 + fn)
NOTATION
fn  one-year 
forward rate  
for year n

	
Chapter 6  Appendix:  Forward Interest Rates	
239
We can rearrange this equation to find the general formula for the forward interest rate:
fn =
(1 + YTMn)n
(1 + YTMn-1)n-1 - 1
(6A.2)
Example 6A.1 
Computing Forward Rates
Problem
Calculate the forward rates for years 1 through 5 from the following zero-coupon yields:
Solution
Using Eqs. 6A.1 and 6A.2:
f1 = YTM1 = 5.00%
f2 = (1 + YTM2)2
(1 + YTM1) - 1 = 1.062
1.05 - 1 = 7.01%
f3 =
(1 + YTM3)3
(1 + YTM2)2 - 1 = 1.063
1.062 - 1 = 6.00%
f4 = (1 + YTM4)4
(1 + YTM3)3 - 1 = 1.05754
1.063
- 1 = 5.00%
Maturity

4
YTM
5.00%
6.00%
6.00%
5.75%
Note that when the yield curve is increasing in year n (that is, when YTMn 7 YTMn-1), 
the forward rate is higher than the zero-coupon yield, fn 7 YTMn. Similarly, when the 
yield curve is decreasing, the forward rate is less than the zero-coupon yield. When the 
yield curve is flat, the forward rate equals the zero-coupon yield.
Computing Bond Yields from Forward Rates
Eq. 6A.2 computes the forward interest rate using the zero-coupon yields. It is also pos-
sible to compute the zero-coupon yields from the forward interest rates. To see this, note 
that if we use interest rate forward contracts to lock in an interest rate for an investment 
in year 1, year 2, and so on through year n, we can create an n-year, risk-free investment. 
The return from this strategy must match the return from an n-year, zero-coupon bond. 
Therefore,
	
(1 + f1) * (1 + f2) * c * (1 + fn) = (1 + YTMn)n
(6A.3)
For example, using the forward rates from Example 6A.1, we can compute the four-year 
zero-coupon yield:
1 + YTM4 = [(1 + f1)(1 + f2)(1 + f3)(1 + f4)]1/4
= [(1.05)(1.0701)(1.06)(1.05)]1/4
= 1.0575

Chapter 6  Valuing Bonds
Forward Rates and Future Interest Rates
A forward rate is the rate that you contract for today for an investment in the future. 
How does this rate compare to the interest rate that will actually prevail in the future? It 
is tempting to believe that the forward interest rate should be a good predictor of future 
interest rates. In reality, this will generally not be the case. Instead, it is a good predictor 
only when investors do not care about risk.
Example 6A.2 
Forward Rates and Future Spot Rates
Problem
JoAnne Wilford is corporate treasurer for Wafer Thin Semiconductor. She must invest some 
of the cash on hand for two years in risk-free bonds. The current one-year, zero-coupon yield 
is 5%. The one-year forward rate is 6%. She is trying to decide between three possible strategies: 
(1) buy a two-year bond, (2) buy a one-year bond and enter into an interest rate forward contract 
to guarantee the rate in the second year, or (3) buy a one-year bond and forgo the forward con-
tract, reinvesting at whatever rate prevails next year. Under what scenarios would she be better 
off following the risky strategy?
Solution
From Eq. 6A.3, both strategies (1) and (2) lead to the same risk-free return of (1 + YTM2)2 =  
(1 + YTM1)(1 + f2) = (1.05)(1.06). The third strategy returns (1.05)(1 + r), where r is the 
­one-year interest rate next year. If the future interest rate turns out to be 6%, then the two 
­strategies will offer the same return. Otherwise Wafer Thin Semiconductor is better off with 
strategy (3) if the interest rate next year is greater than the forward rate—6%—and worse off if 
the interest rate is lower than 6%.
As Example 6A.2 makes clear, we can think of the forward rate as a break-even rate. 
If this rate actually prevails in the future, investors will be indifferent between invest-
ing in a two-year bond and investing in a one-year bond and rolling over the money in 
one year. If investors did not care about risk, then they would be indifferent between 
the two strategies whenever the expected one-year spot rate equals the current forward 
rate. However, investors do generally care about risk. If the expected returns of both 
strategies were the same, investors would prefer one strategy or the other depending on 
whether they want to be exposed to future interest rate risk fluctuations. In general, the 
expected future spot interest rate will reflect investors’ preferences toward the risk of 
future interest rate fluctuations. Thus,
	
Expected Future Spot Interest Rate = Forward Interest Rate + Risk Premium (6A.4) 
This risk premium can be either positive or negative depending on investors’ preferences.7 
As a result, forward rates tend not to be ideal predictors of future spot rates.
7Empirical research suggests that the risk premium tends to be negative when the yield curve is upward 
sloping, and positive when it is downward sloping. See E. Fama and R. Bliss, “The Information in Long-
Maturity Forward Rates,” American Economic Review 77(4) (1987): 680–692; and J. Campbell and R. 
Shiller, “Yield Spreads and Interest Rate Movements: A Bird’s Eye View,” Review of Economic Studies 58(3)

THE LAW OF ONE PRICE CONNECTION. Now that the basic tools for 
financial decision making are in place, we can begin to apply them. One of the most 
important decisions facing a financial manager is the choice of which investments the 
corporation should make. In Chapter 7, we compare the net present value rule to other 
investment rules that firms sometimes use and explain why the net present value rule is 
superior. The process of allocating the firm’s capital for investment is known as capital 
budgeting, and in Chapter 8, we outline the discounted cash flow method for making 
such decisions. Both chapters provide a practical demonstration of the power of the 
tools that were introduced in Part 2.
Many firms raise the capital they need to make investments by issuing stock to investors. 
How do investors determine the price they are willing to pay for this stock? And how do 
managers’ investment decisions affect this value? In Chapter 9, Valuing Stocks, we show 
how the Law of One Price leads to several alternative methods for valuing a firm’s equity 
by considering its future dividends, its free cash flows, or how it compares to similar, 
publicly traded companies.

IN 2000, TOSHIBA AND SONY BEGAN EXPERIMENTING WITH 
new DVD technology, leading to Sony’s development of Blu-ray High Definition DVD 
players and Toshiba’s introduction of the HD-DVD player. So began an eight-year 
format war that ended in February 2008 when Toshiba decided to stop producing HD-
DVD players and abandon the format. How did  Toshiba and Sony managers arrive at 
the decision to invest in new DVD formats? And how did  Toshiba managers conclude 
that the best decision was to stop producing HD-DVD? In both cases, the managers 
made decisions they believed would maximize the value of their firms.
As we will see in this chapter, the NPV investment rule is the decision rule that 
managers should use to maximize firm value. Nevertheless, some firms use other tech-
niques to evaluate investments and decide which projects to pursue. In this chapter, we 
explain several commonly used techniques—namely, the payback rule and the internal 
rate of return rule. We then compare decisions based on these rules to decisions based 
on the NPV rule and illustrate the circumstances in which the alternative rules are likely 
to lead to bad investment decisions. After establishing these rules in the context of 
a single, stand-alone project, we broaden our perspective to include deciding among 
alternative investment opportunities. We conclude with a look at project selection when 
the firm faces capital or other resource constraints.
Investment 
Decision Rules
Chapter

	
7.1	 NPV and Stand-Alone Projects
We begin our discussion of investment decision rules by considering a take-it-or-leave-it 
decision involving a single, stand-alone project. By undertaking this project, the firm does 
not constrain its ability to take other projects. To analyze such a decision, recall the NPV rule:
NPV Investment Rule: When making an investment decision, take the alternative with the 
highest NPV. Choosing this alternative is equivalent to receiving its NPV in cash today.
In the case of a stand-alone project, we must choose between accepting or rejecting the 
project. The NPV rule then says we should compare the project’s NPV to zero (the NPV 
of doing nothing) and accept the project if its NPV is positive.
Applying the NPV Rule
Researchers at Fredrick’s Feed and Farm have made a breakthrough. They believe that they 
can produce a new, environmentally friendly fertilizer at a substantial cost savings over the 
company’s existing line of fertilizer. The fertilizer will require a new plant that can be built 
immediately at a cost of $250 million. Financial managers estimate that the benefits of the 
new fertilizer will be $35 million per year, starting at the end of the first year and lasting 
forever, as shown by the following timeline:

7.1  NPV and Stand-Alone Projects	
245
As we explained in Chapter 4, the NPV of this perpetual cash flow stream, given a dis-
count rate r, is
	
NPV = -250 + 35
r 
(7.1)
The financial managers responsible for this project estimate a cost of capital of 10% per 
year. Using this cost of capital in Eq. 7.1, the NPV is $100 million, which is positive. The 
NPV investment rule indicates that by making the investment, the value of the firm will 
increase by $100 million today, so Fredrick’s should undertake this project.
The NPV Profile and IRR
The NPV of the project depends on the appropriate cost of capital. Often, there may 
be some uncertainty regarding the project’s cost of capital. In that case, it is helpful to 
compute an NPV profile: a graph of the project’s NPV over a range of discount rates. 
­Figure 7.1 plots the NPV of the fertilizer project as a function of the discount rate, r.
Notice that the NPV is positive only for discount rates that are less than 14%. When 
r = 14%, the NPV is zero. Recall from Chapter 4 that the internal rate of return (IRR) 
of an investment is the discount rate that sets the NPV of the project’s cash flows equal to 
zero. Thus, the fertilizer project has an IRR of 14%.
The IRR of a project provides useful information regarding the sensitivity of the proj-
ect’s NPV to errors in the estimate of its cost of capital. For the fertilizer project, if the 
cost of capital estimate is more than the 14% IRR, the NPV will be negative, as shown in 

246	
Chapter 7  Investment Decision Rules
Figure 7.1. Therefore, the decision to accept the project is correct as long as our estimate 
of 10% is within 4% of the true cost of capital. In general, the difference between the cost of 
capital and the IRR is the maximum estimation error in the cost of capital that can exist with-
out altering the original decision.
Alternative Rules Versus the NPV Rule
Although the NPV rule is the most accurate and reliable decision rule, in practice a wide 
variety of tools are applied, often in tandem with the NPV rule. In a 2001 study, 75% of 
the firms John Graham and Campbell Harvey1 surveyed used the NPV rule for making 
investment decisions. This result is substantially different from that found in a similar 
study in 1977 by L. J. Gitman and J. R. Forrester,2 who found that only 10% of firms 
used the NPV rule. MBA students in recent years must have been listening to their finance 
professors! Even so, Graham and Harvey’s study indicates that one-fourth of U.S. corpora-
tions do not use the NPV rule. Exactly why other capital budgeting techniques are used in 
practice is not always clear. However, because you may encounter these techniques in the 
business world, you should know what they are, how they are used, and how they compare 
to NPV.
As we evaluate alternative rules for project selection in subsequent sections, keep in 
mind that sometimes other investment rules may give the same answer as the NPV rule, 
but at other times they may disagree. When the rules conflict, following the alternative 
rule means that we are either taking a negative NPV investment or turning down a posi-
tive NPV investment. In these cases, the alternative rules lead to bad decisions that reduce 
wealth.

1.	 Explain the NPV rule for stand-alone projects.
	
2.	 What does the difference between the cost of capital and the IRR indicate?
ANSWER: QUALCOMM encourages 
its financial planners to utilize hurdle 
(or discount) rates that vary according 
to the risk of the particular project. We 
expect a rate of return commensurate 
with the project’s risk. Our finance staff 
considers a wide range of discount rates 
and chooses one that fits the project’s 
expected risk profile and time horizon. 
The range can be from 6% to 8% for 
relatively safe investments in the domes-
tic market to 50% or more for equity 
investments in foreign markets that 
may be illiquid and difficult to predict. 
We re-evaluate our hurdle rates at least 
every year.
We analyze key factors including: (1) 
market adoption risk (whether or not cus-
tomers will buy the new product or ser-
vice at the price and volume we expect), 
(2) technology development risk (whether or not we can 
develop and patent the new product or service as expected), 
(3) execution risk (whether we can launch the new product 
or service cost effectively and on time), and (4) dedicated 
asset risk (the amount of resources that must be consumed 
to complete the work).
QUESTION: How are projects categorized and how are the 
hurdle rates for new projects determined? What would happen 
if QUALCOMM simply evaluated all new projects against the 
same hurdle rate?
ANSWER: We primarily categorize projects by risk level, but 
we also categorize projects by the expected time horizon. 
We consider short-term and long-term projects to bal-
ance our needs and achieve our objectives. For example, 
immediate projects and opportunities may demand a great 
amount of attention, but we also stay focused on long-term 
projects because they often create greater long-term value 
for stockholders.
If we were to evaluate all new projects against the 
same hurdle rate, then our business planners would, by 
default, consistently choose to invest in the highest risk 
projects because those projects would appear to have the 
greatest expected returns in DCF models or IRR analy-
ses. That approach would probably not work well for 
very long.

Dick Grannis is Senior Vice President and 
Treasurer of QUALCOMM Incorporated, a 
world leader in digital wireless communi-
cations technology and semiconductors, 
headquartered in San Diego. He joined 
the company in 1991 and oversees the 
company’s $10 billion cash investment 
portfolio. He works primarily on invest-
ment banking, capital structure, and inter-
national finance.
QUESTION: QUALCOMM has a wide 
variety of products in different business 
lines. How does your capital budgeting pro-
cess for new products work?
ANSWER: QUALCOMM evaluates 
new projects (such as new products, 
equipment, technologies, research and 
development, acquisitions, and strategic 
investments) by using traditional financial measurements 
including discounted cash flow/NPV models, IRR levels, 
peak funding requirements, the time needed to reach 
cumulative positive cash flows, and the short-term impact 
of the investment on our reported net earnings. For strate-
gic investments, we consider the possible value of financial, 
competitive, technology and/or market value enhancements 
to our core businesses—even if those benefits cannot be 
quantified. Overall, we make capital budgeting decisions 
based on a combination of objective analyses and our own 
business judgment.
We do not engage in capital budgeting and analysis if 
the project represents an immediate and necessary require-
ment for our business operations. One example is new soft-
ware or production equipment to start a project that has 
already received approval.
We are also mindful of the opportunity costs of allocat-
ing our internal engineering resources on one project vs. 
another project. We view this as a constantly challenging 
but worthwhile exercise, because we have many attractive 
opportunities but limited resources to pursue them.
QUESTION: How often does QUALCOMM evaluate its 
hurdle rates and what factors does it consider in setting them? 
How do you allocate capital across areas and regions and assess 
the risk of non-U.S. investments?

7.2	 The Internal Rate of Return Rule
One interpretation of the internal rate of return is the average return earned by taking on 
the investment opportunity. The internal rate of return (IRR) investment rule is based 
on this idea: If the average return on the investment opportunity (i.e., the IRR) is greater 
than the return on other alternatives in the market with equivalent risk and maturity (i.e., 
the project’s cost of capital), you should undertake the investment opportunity. We state 
the rule formally as follows:
IRR Investment Rule: Take any investment opportunity where the IRR exceeds the opportu-
nity cost of capital. Turn down any opportunity whose IRR is less than the opportunity cost of 
capital.
Applying the IRR Rule
Like the NPV rule, the internal rate of return investment rule is applied to single, stand-
alone projects within the firm. The IRR investment rule will give the correct answer (that 
is, the same answer as the NPV rule) in many—but not all—situations. For instance, it 
gives the correct answer for Fredrick’s fertilizer opportunity. Looking again at Figure 7.1, 
whenever the cost of capital is below the IRR (14%), the project has a positive NPV and 
you should undertake the investment.
In the Fredrick fertilizer example, the NPV rule and the IRR rule coincide, so the IRR 
rule gives the correct answer. This need not always be the case, however. In fact, the IRR 
rule is only guaranteed to work for a stand-alone project if all of the project’s negative cash flows 
precede its positive cash flows. If this is not the case, the IRR rule can lead to incorrect deci-
sions. Let’s examine several situations in which the IRR fails.
Pitfall #1: Delayed Investments
John Star, the founder of SuperTech, the most successful company in the last 20 years, 
has just retired as CEO. A major publisher has offered to pay Star $1 million upfront if 
he agrees to write a book about his experiences. He estimates that it will take him three 
years to write the book. The time that he spends writing will cause him to forgo alternative 
sources of income amounting to $500,000 per year. Considering the risk of his alternative 
income sources and available investment opportunities, Star estimates his opportunity cost 
of capital to be 10%. The timeline of Star’s investment opportunity is

The NPV of Star’s investment opportunity is
NPV = 1,000,000 -  500,000
1 + r
- 500,000
(1 + r)2 - 500,000
(1 + r)3
By setting the NPV equal to zero and solving for r, we find the IRR. Using the annuity 
spreadsheet:

The 23.38% IRR is larger than the 10% opportunity cost of capital. According to the IRR 
rule, Star should sign the deal. But what does the NPV rule say?
NPV = 1,000,000 - 500,000
1.1
- 500,000
1.12
- 500,000
1.13
= -$243,426
At a 10% discount rate, the NPV is negative, so signing the deal would reduce Star’s 
wealth. He should not sign the book deal.
To understand why the IRR rule fails, Figure 7.2 shows the NPV profile of the book 
deal. No matter what the cost of capital is, the IRR rule and the NPV rule will give exactly 
opposite recommendations. That is, the NPV is positive only when the opportunity cost 
of capital is above 23.38% (the IRR). In fact, Star should accept the investment only when 
the opportunity cost of capital is greater than the IRR, the opposite of what the IRR rule 
recommends.
Figure 7.2 also illustrates the problem with using the IRR rule in this case. For most 
investment opportunities, expenses occur initially and cash is received later. In this case, 
Star gets cash upfront and incurs the costs of producing the book later. It is as if Star 
­borrowed money—receiving cash today in exchange for a future liability—and when you 
borrow money you prefer as low a rate as possible. In this case the IRR is best interpreted as 
the rate Star is paying rather than earning, and so Star’s optimal rule is to borrow money so 
long as this rate is less than his cost of capital.
Even though the IRR rule fails to give the correct answer in this case, the IRR itself still 
provides useful information in conjunction with the NPV rule. As mentioned earlier, IRR 
indicates how sensitive the investment decision is to uncertainty in the cost of capital esti-
mate. In this case, the difference between the cost of capital and the IRR is large—13.38%. 
Star would have to have underestimated the cost of capital by 13.38% to make the NPV 
positive.
Pitfall #2: Multiple IRRs
Star has informed the publisher that it needs to sweeten the deal before he will accept it. 
In response, the publisher offers to give him a royalty payment when the book is ­published 
in exchange for taking a smaller upfront payment. Specifically, Star will receive $1 ­million 
when the book is published and sold four years from now, together with an upfront 
­payment of $550,000. Should he accept or reject the new offer?

Chapter 7  Investment Decision Rules
We begin with the new timeline:
The NPV of Star’s new offer is
NPV = 550,000 - 500,000
1 + r
- 500,000
(1 + r)2 - 500,000
(1 + r)3 + 1,000,000
(1 + r)4
By setting the NPV equal to zero and solving for r, we find the IRR. In this case, there are 
two IRRs—that is, there are two values of r that set the NPV equal to zero. You can verify 
this fact by substituting IRRs of 7.164% and 33.673% into the equation. Because there is 
more than one IRR, we cannot apply the IRR rule.
For guidance, let’s turn to the NPV rule. Figure 7.3 shows the NPV profile of the new 
offer. If the cost of capital is either below 7.164% or above 33.673%, Star should undertake 
the opportunity. Otherwise, he should turn it down. Notice that even though the IRR rule 
fails in this case, the two IRRs are still useful as bounds on the cost of capital. If the cost of 
capital estimate is wrong, and it is actually smaller than 7.164% or larger than 33.673%, 
the decision not to pursue the project will change. Even if Star is uncertain whether his 
actual cost of capital is 10%, as long as he believes it is within these bounds, he can have a 
high degree of confidence in his decision to reject the deal.
There is no easy fix for the IRR rule when there are multiple IRRs. Although the NPV 
is negative between the IRRs in this example, the reverse is also possible. Furthermore, 
there are situations in which more than two IRRs exist.3 When multiple IRRs exist, our 
only choice is to rely on the NPV rule.
3In general, there can be as many IRRs as the number of times the project’s cash flows change sign 
over time.

Pitfall #3: Nonexistent IRR
After protracted negotiations, Star is able to get the publisher to increase his initial payment to 
$750,000, in addition to his $1 million royalty payment when the book is published in four 
years. With these cash flows, no IRR exists; that is, there is no discount rate that makes the 
NPV equal to zero. Thus, the IRR rule provides no guidance whatsoever. To evaluate this final 
offer, let’s again look at the NPV profile, shown in Figure 7.4. There we can see that the NPV 
is positive for any discount rate, and so the offer is attractive. But don’t be fooled into thinking 
the NPV is always positive when the IRR does not exist—it can just as well be negative.

IRR Versus the IRR Rule
The examples in this section illustrate the potential short-
comings of the IRR rule when choosing to accept or reject 
a stand-alone project. As we said at the outset, we can only 
avoid these problems if all of the negative cash flows of the 
project precede the positive cash flows. Otherwise, we can-
not rely on the IRR rule. However, even in that case, the 
IRR itself remains a very useful tool. The IRR ­measures the 
average return over the life of an ­investment and ­indicates 
the sensitivity of the NPV to estimation error in the cost 
of capital. Thus, knowing the IRR can be very useful, but 
relying on it alone to make investment decisions can be 
hazardous.
Common Mistake

252	
Chapter 7  Investment Decision Rules
As the previous examples demonstrate, if a project has positive cash flows that precede 
negative ones, it is important to look at the project’s NPV profile in order to interpret the 
IRR. See the appendix to this chapter for a simple approach to calculating the NPV profile 
in Excel.

1.	 Under what conditions do the IRR rule and the NPV rule coincide for a stand-alone project?
	
2.	 If the IRR rule and the NPV rule lead to different decisions for a stand-alone project, which should 
you follow? Why?
	
7.3	 The Payback Rule
In this section, we examine the payback rule as an alternative decision rule for single, stand-
alone projects within the firm. The payback investment rule states that you should only 
accept a project if its cash flows pay back its initial investment within a prespecified period. 
To apply the payback rule, you first calculate the amount of time it takes to pay back the 
initial investment, called the payback period. Then you accept the project if the payback 
period is less than a prespecified length of time—usually a few years. Otherwise, you reject 
the project. For example, a firm might adopt any project with a payback period of less than 
two years.
Applying the Payback Rule
To illustrate the payback rule, we return to the Fredrick’s Feed and Farm example.
Solution
We plot the NPV profile for each project below. From the NPV profiles, we can see that projects 
A, B, and C each have an IRR of approximately 20%, while project D has no IRR. Note also that 
project B has another IRR of 5%.
The IRR rule is valid only if the project has a positive NPV for every discount rate below the 
IRR. Thus, the IRR rule is only valid for project A. This project is the only one for which all the 
negative cash flows precede the positive ones.

Relying on the payback rule analysis in Example 7.2, Fredrick’s will reject the project. 
However, as we saw earlier, with a cost of capital of 10%, the NPV is $100 million. Follow-
ing the payback rule would be a mistake because Fredrick’s would pass up a project worth 
$100 million.
Payback Rule Pitfalls in Practice
The payback rule is not as reliable as the NPV rule because it (1) ignores the project’s 
cost of capital and the time value of money, (2) ignores cash flows after the payback 
period, and (3) relies on an ad hoc decision criterion (what is the right number of years 
to require for the payback period?).4 Despite these failings, about 57% of the firms 
­Graham and Harvey surveyed reported using the payback rule as part of the decision-
making process.
Why do some companies consider the payback rule? The answer probably relates to its 
simplicity. This rule is typically used for small investment decisions—for example, whether 
to purchase a new copy machine or to service the old one. In such cases, the cost of making 
an incorrect decision might not be large enough to justify the time required to calculate 
the NPV. The payback rule also provides budgeting information regarding the length of 
time capital will be committed to a project. Some firms are unwilling to commit capital 
to long-term investments without greater scrutiny. Also, if the required payback period is 
short (one or two years), then most projects that satisfy the payback rule will have a positive 
NPV. So firms might save effort by first applying the payback rule, and only if it fails take 
the time to compute NPV.
4Some companies address the first failing by computing the payback period using discounted cash flows 
(called discounted payback).
Example 7.2 
The Payback Rule
Problem
Assume Fredrick’s requires all projects to have a payback period of five years or less. Would the 
firm undertake the fertilizer project under this rule?
Solution
Recall that the project requires an initial investment of $250 million, and will generate $35 mil-
lion per year. The sum of the cash flows from year 1 to year 5 is $35 * 5 = $175 million, which 
will not cover the initial investment of $250 million. In fact, it will not be until year 8 that the 
initial investment will be paid back ($35 * 8 = $280 million). Because the payback period for 
this project exceeds five years, Fredrick’s will reject the project.

7.4	 Choosing Between Projects
Thus far, we have considered only decisions where the choice is either to accept or to reject 
a single, stand-alone project. Sometimes, however, a firm must choose just one project from 
among several possible projects, that is, the choices are mutually exclusive. For ­example, a 
manager may be evaluating alternative package designs for a new product. When choosing any 
one project excludes us from taking the others, we are facing mutually exclusive investments.
NPV Rule and Mutually Exclusive Investments
When projects are mutually exclusive, we need to determine which projects have a positive 
NPV and then rank the projects to identify the best one. In this situation, the NPV rule 
provides a straightforward answer: Pick the project with the highest NPV. Because the NPV 
expresses the value of the project in terms of cash today, picking the project with the high-
est NPV leads to the greatest increase in wealth.
Example 7.3 
NPV and Mutually Exclusive Projects

student-oriented business would be very successful there. You have researched several possibili-
ties and come up with the following cash flow estimates (including the cost of purchasing the

Why Do Rules Other Than the NPV Rule Persist?
Professors Graham and Harvey found that a sizable minor-
ity of firms (25%) in their study do not use the NPV rule at 
all. In addition, more than half of firms surveyed used the 
payback rule. Furthermore, it appears that most firms use 
both the NPV rule and the IRR rule. Why do firms use rules 
other than NPV if they can lead to ­erroneous decisions?
One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that 
Graham and Harvey’s survey results might be misleading. 
Managers may use the payback rule for budgeting purposes 
or as a shortcut to get a quick sense of the project before 
calculating NPV. Similarly, CFOs who were using the IRR 
as a sensitivity measure in conjunction with the NPV rule 
might have checked both the IRR box and the NPV box on 
the survey. Nevertheless, a significant minority of managers 
surveyed replied that they used only the IRR rule, so this 
explanation cannot be the whole story.
Managers may use the IRR rule exclusively because you 
do not need to know the opportunity cost of capital to cal-
culate the IRR. But this benefit is superficial: While you 
may not need to know the cost of capital to calculate the 
IRR, you certainly need to know the cost of capital when 
you apply the IRR rule. Consequently, the opportunity 
cost of capital is as important to the IRR rule as it is to the  
NPV rule.
Nonetheless, part of the appeal of the IRR rule is that 
the IRR seems to sum up the attractiveness of an invest-
ment without requiring an assumption about the cost of 
capital. However, a more useful summary is the project’s 
NPV profile, showing the NPV as a function of the dis-
count rate. The NPV profile also does not require know-
ing the cost of capital, but it has the distinct advantage of 
being much more informative and reliable.

IRR Rule and Mutually Exclusive Investments
Because the IRR is a measure of the expected return of investing in the project, you might 
be tempted to extend the IRR investment rule to the case of mutually exclusive projects by 
picking the project with the highest IRR. Unfortunately, picking one project over another 
simply because it has a larger IRR can lead to mistakes. In particular, when projects differ in 
their scale of investment, the timing of their cash flows, or their riskiness, then their IRRs cannot 
be meaningfully compared.
Differences in Scale.  Would you prefer a 500% return on $1, or a 20% return on $1 mil-
lion? While a 500% return certainly sounds impressive, at the end of the day you will only 
make $5. The latter return sounds much more mundane, but you will make $200,000. This 
comparison illustrates an important shortcoming of IRR: Because it is a return, you cannot 
tell how much value will actually be created without knowing the scale of the investment.
If a project has a positive NPV, then if we can double its size, its NPV will double: By 
the Law of One Price, doubling the cash flows of an investment opportunity must make it 
worth twice as much. However, the IRR rule does not have this property—it is unaffected 
by the scale of the investment opportunity because the IRR measures the average return 
of the investment. Hence, we cannot use the IRR rule to compare projects of different 
scales.
As an illustration of this situation, consider the investment in the book store versus the 
coffee shop in Example 7.3. We can compute the IRR of each as follows:
 Book Store: -300,000 +
63,000
IRR - 3% = 0 1 IRR = 24%
 Coffee Shop: -400,000 +
80,000
IRR - 3% = 0 1 IRR = 23%
Both projects have IRRs that exceed their cost of capital of 8%. But although the ­coffee 
shop has a lower IRR, because it is on a larger scale of investment ($400,000 versus 
$300,000), it generates a higher NPV ($1.2 million versus $960,000) and thus is more 
valuable.
Solution
Assuming each business lasts indefinitely, we can compute the present value of the cash flows 
from each as a constant growth perpetuity. The NPV of each project is
 NPV (Book Store) = - 300,000 +
63,000
8% - 3% = $960,000
 NPV (Coffee Shop) = -400,000 +
80,000
8% - 3% = $1,200,000
 NPV (Music Store) = - 400,000 + 104,000
8%
= $900,000
 NPV (Electronics Store) = -400,000 +
100,000
11% - 3% = $850,000
Thus, all of the alternatives have a positive NPV. But, because we can only choose one, the coffee 
shop is the best alternative.

Chapter 7  Investment Decision Rules
Differences in Timing.  Even when projects have the same scale, the IRR may lead you 
to rank them incorrectly due to differences in the timing of the cash flows. The IRR is 
expressed as a return, but the dollar value of earning a given return—and therefore its 
NPV—depends on how long the return is earned. Earning a very high annual return is 
much more valuable if you earn it for several years than if you earn it for only a few days.
As an example, consider the following short-term and long-term projects:
Both projects have an IRR of 50%, but one lasts for one year, while the other has a five-
year horizon. If the cost of capital for both projects is 10%, the short-term project has an  
NPV of -100 + 150/1.10 = $36.36, whereas the long-term project has an NPV of -100 
+ 759.375/1.105 = $371.51. Notice that despite having the same IRR, the long-term 
project is more than 10 times as valuable as the short-term project.
Even when projects have the same horizon, the pattern of cash flows over time will 
often differ. Consider again the coffee shop and music store investment alternatives in 
Example 7.3. Both of these investments have the same initial scale, and the same horizon 
(infinite). The IRR of the music store investment is
Music Store: -400,000 + 104,000
IRR
= 0 1 IRR = 26%
But although the music store has a higher IRR than the coffee shop (26% versus 23%), it 
has a lower NPV ($900,000 versus $1.2 million). The reason the coffee shop has a higher 
NPV despite having a lower IRR is its higher growth rate. The coffee shop has lower initial 
cash flows but higher long-run cash flows than the music store. The fact that its cash flows 
are relatively delayed makes the coffee shop effectively a longer-term investment.
Differences in Risk.  To know whether the IRR of a project is attractive, we must compare 
it to the project’s cost of capital, which is determined by the project’s risk. Thus, an IRR 
that is attractive for a safe project need not be attractive for a risky project. As a simple 
example, while you might be quite pleased to earn a 10% return on a risk-free investment 
opportunity, you might be much less satisfied to earn a 10% expected return on an invest-
ment in a risky start-up company. Ranking projects by their IRRs ignores risk differences.
Looking again at Example 7.3, consider the investment in the electronics store. The 
IRR of the electronics store is
Electronics Store: -400,000 + 100,000
IRR - 3% = 0 1 IRR = 28%
This IRR is higher than those of all the other investment opportunities. Yet the electronics 
store has the lowest NPV. In this case, the investment in the electronics store is riskier, as 
evidenced by its higher cost of capital. Despite having a higher IRR, it is not sufficiently 
profitable to be as attractive as the safer alternatives.
The Incremental IRR
When choosing between two projects, an alternative to comparing their IRRs is to ­compute 
the incremental IRR, which is the IRR of the incremental cash flows that would result 
from replacing one project with the other. The incremental IRR tells us the discount rate

at which it becomes profitable to switch from one project to the other. Then, rather than 
compare the projects directly, we can evaluate the decision to switch from one to the other 
using the IRR rule, as in the following example.
Example 7.4
Using the Incremental IRR to Compare Alternatives
Problem
Your firm is considering overhauling its production plant. The engineering team has come up 
with two proposals, one for a minor overhaul and one for a major overhaul. The two options 
have the following cash flows (in millions of dollars):
What is the IRR of each proposal? What is the incremental IRR? If the cost of capital for both of 
these projects is 12%, what should your firm do?
Solution
We can compute the IRR of each proposal using the annuity calculator. For the minor overhaul, 
the IRR is 36.3%:
For the major overhaul, the IRR is 23.4%:
Which project is best? Because the projects have different scales, we cannot compare their IRRs 
directly. To compute the incremental IRR of switching from the minor overhaul to the major 
overhaul, we first compute the incremental cash flows:

When Can Returns Be Compared?
In this chapter, we have highlighted the many pitfalls that 
arise when attempting to compare the IRRs of different 
projects. But there are many situations in which it is quite 
reasonable to compare returns. For example, if we were 
thinking of saving money in a savings account for the next 
year, we would likely compare the effective annual rates asso-
ciated with different accounts and choose the highest option.
When is it reasonable to compare returns in this way? 
Remember, we can only compare returns if the investments 
(1) have the same scale, (2) have the same timing, and (3) have the 
same risk. While one or more of these conditions are typically 
violated when we compare two investment projects, they are 
much more likely to be met when one of the investments is an 
investment in publicly traded securities or with a bank. When 
we invest with a bank or in traded securities, we can usually 
choose the scale of our investment, as well as our investment 
horizon, so that the opportunities match. In this case, as long 
as we are comparing opportunities with the same risk, com-
paring returns is meaningful. (Indeed, this condition was the 
basis for our definition of the cost of capital in Chapter 5.)

Comparison of Minor 
and Major Overhauls
Comparing the NPV profiles of the 
minor and major overhauls in Exam-
ple 7.4, we can see that despite its 
lower IRR, the major overhaul has a 
higher NPV at the cost of capital of 
12%. Note also that the incremental 
IRR of 20% determines the cross-
over point or discount rate at which 
the optimal decision changes.
As we saw in Example 7.4, the incremental IRR identifies the discount rate at which the 
optimal decision changes. However, when using the incremental IRR to choose between 
projects, we encounter all of the same problems that arose with the IRR rule:
n	 Even if the negative cash flows precede the positive ones for the individual projects, it 
need not be true for the incremental cash flows. If not, the incremental IRR is difficult 
to interpret, and may not exist or may not be unique.
n	 The incremental IRR can indicate whether it is profitable to switch from one project 
to another, but it does not indicate whether either project has a positive NPV on  
its own.
n	 When the individual projects have different costs of capital, it is not obvious what cost 
of capital the incremental IRR should be compared to. In this case only the NPV rule, 
which allows each project to be discounted at its own cost of capital, will give a reliable 
answer.
These cash flows have an IRR of 20.0%:
Because the incremental IRR exceeds the 12% cost of capital, switching to the major overhaul 
looks attractive (i.e., its larger scale is sufficient to make up for its lower IRR). We can check 
this result using Figure 7.5, which shows the NPV profiles for each project. At the 12% cost of 
capital, the NPV of the major overhaul does indeed exceed that of the minor overhaul, despite 
its lower IRR. Note also that the incremental IRR determines the crossover point of the NPV 
profiles, the discount rate for which the best project choice switches from the major overhaul to 
the minor one.

In summary, although the incremental IRR provides useful information by telling us 
the discount rate at which our optimal project choice would change, using it as a decision 
rule is difficult and error prone. It is much simpler to use the NPV rule.

larger IRR can lead to mistakes.
	
2.	 What is the incremental IRR and what are its shortcomings as a decision rule?
IRR and Project Financing
Because the IRR is not itself a measure of value, it is easy to 
manipulate by restructuring the project’s cash flows. In par-
ticular, it is easy to increase the IRR of a project by financing 
a portion of the initial investment. A common mistake in 
practice is to regard this higher IRR as an indication that the 
financing is attractive. For example, consider an investment 
in new equipment that will have the following cash flows:
This investment has an IRR of 30%. Now suppose that 
seller of the equipment offers to lend us $80, so that we only 
need to pay $20 initially. In exchange, we must pay $100 in 
one year. By financing the project in this way, the cash flows 
become
The project’s IRR is now (30/20) - 1 = 50%. Does this 
higher IRR mean that the project is now more attractive? In 
other words, is the financing a good deal?
The answer is no. Remember, we cannot compare IRRs, 
so a 50% IRR is not necessarily better than a 30% IRR. In 
this case, the project with financing is a much smaller scale 
investment than without financing. In addition, borrow-
ing money is likely to increase the risk to shareholders from 
undertaking the project. (We’ll see explicitly the effect of 
leverage on risk and shareholders’ required return in Parts 4 
and 5 of the book.)
In this particular example, note that we borrowed $80 
initially in exchange for paying $100 in one year. The IRR 
of this loan is (100/80) - 1 = 25% (this is also the incre-
mental IRR of rejecting the financing). This rate is probably 
much higher than our firm’s borrowing cost if it borrowed 
through other means. If so, including this financing with 
the project would be a mistake, despite the higher IRR.

7.5	 Project Selection with Resource Constraints
In principle, the firm should take on all positive-NPV investments it can identify. In 
practice, there are often limitations on the number of projects the firm can undertake. 
For example, when projects are mutually exclusive, the firm can only take on one of the 
projects even if many of them are attractive. Often this limitation is due to resource con-
straints—for example, there is only one property available in which to open either a coffee 
shop, or book store, and so on. Thus far, we have assumed that the different projects the 
firm is considering have the same resource requirements (in Example 7.3, each project 
would use 100% of the property). In this section, we develop an approach for situations 
where the choices have differing resource needs.
Evaluating Projects with Different Resource Requirements
In some situations, different projects will demand different amounts of a particular scarce 
resource. For example, different products may consume different proportions of a firm’s 
production capacity, or might demand different amounts of managerial time and ­attention. 
	
7.5  Project Selection with Resource Constraints	
259

260	
Chapter 7  Investment Decision Rules
If there is a fixed supply of the resource so that you cannot undertake all possible opportu-
nities, then the firm must choose the best set of investments it can make given the resources 
it has available.
Often, individual managers work within a budget constraint that limits the amount 
of capital they may invest in a given period. In this case, the manager’s goal is to choose 
the projects that maximize the total NPV while staying within her budget. Suppose you 
are considering the three projects shown in Table 7.1. Absent any budget constraint, you 
would invest in all of these positive-NPV projects. Suppose, however, that you have a bud-
get of at most $100 million to invest. While Project I has the highest NPV, it uses up the 
entire budget. Projects II and III can both be undertaken (together they also take up the 
entire budget), and their combined NPV exceeds the NPV of Project I. Thus, with a bud-
get of $100 million, the best choice is to take Projects II and III for a combined NPV of 
$130 million, compared to just $110 million for Project I alone.
Profitability Index
Note that in the last column of Table 7.1 we included the ratio of the project’s NPV to its 
initial investment. This ratio tells us that for every dollar invested in Project I, we will gen-
erate $1.10 in value (over and above the dollar invested).5 Both Projects II and III generate 
higher NPVs per dollar invested than Project I, which indicates that they will use the avail-
able budget more efficiently.
In this simple example, identifying the optimal combination of projects to undertake is 
straightforward. In actual situations replete with many projects and resources, finding the 
optimal combination can be difficult. Practitioners often use the profitability index to 
identify the optimal combination of projects to undertake in such situations:
Profitability Index
	
Profitability Index =
Value Created
Resource Consumed =
NPV
Resource Consumed
(7.2)
The profitability index measures the “bang for your buck”—that is, the value created 
in terms of NPV per unit of resource consumed. After computing the profitability index, 
we can rank projects based on it. Starting with the project with the highest index, we move 
down the ranking, taking all projects until the resource is consumed. In Table 7.1, the 
ratio we computed in the last column is the profitability index when investment dollars 
5Practitioners sometimes add 1 to this ratio to include the dollar invested (i.e., Project I generates a total 
of $2.10 per dollar invested, generating $1.10 in new value). Leaving out the 1 and just considering 
the net present value allows the ratio to be applied to other resources besides cash budgets, as shown in 
Example 7.5.

are the scarce resource. Note how the “profitability index rule” would correctly select 
­Projects II and III. We can also apply this rule when other resources are scarce, as shown 
in Example 7.5.
Example 7.5
Profitability Index with a Human Resource Constraint
Problem
Your division at NetIt, a large networking company, has put together a project proposal to 
develop a new home networking router. The expected NPV of the project is $17.7 million, and 
the project will require 50 software engineers. NetIt has a total of 190 engineers available, and 
the router project must compete with the following other projects for these engineers:
How should NetIt prioritize these projects?
Solution
The goal is to maximize the total NPV we can create with 190 engineers (at most). We compute 
the profitability index for each project, using Engineering Headcount in the denominator, and 
then sort projects based on the index:
We now assign the resource to the projects in descending order according to the profitability 
index. The final column shows the cumulative use of the resource as each project is taken on until the 
resource is used up. To maximize NPV within the constraint of 190 engineers, NetIt should choose 
the first four projects on the list. There is no other combination of projects that will create more value 
without using more engineers than we have. Note, however, that the resource constraint forces NetIt 
to forgo three otherwise valuable projects (C, D, and B) with a total NPV of $33.6 million.

Note that in the above examples, the firm’s resource constraints cause it to pass up 
positive-NPV projects. The highest profitability index available from these remaining 
projects provides useful information regarding the value of that resource to the firm. In 
Example 7.5, for example, Project C would generate $350,000 in NPV per engineer. If the 
firm could recruit and train new engineers at a cost of less than $350,000 per engineer, it 
would be worthwhile to do so in order to undertake Project C. Alternatively, if engineering

261

Chapter 7  Investment Decision Rules
headcount has been allocated to another division of the firm for projects with a profit-
ability index of less than $350,000 per engineer, it would be worthwhile to reallocate that 
headcount to this division to undertake Project C.
Shortcomings of the Profitability Index
Although the profitability index is simple to compute and use, for it to be completely reli-
able, two conditions must be satisfied:
	
1.	 The set of projects taken following the profitability index ranking completely 
exhausts the available resource.
	
2.	 There is only a single relevant resource constraint.
To see why the first condition is needed, suppose in Example 7.5 that NetIt has an addi-
tional small project with an NPV of only $120,000 that requires three engineers. The prof-
itability index in this case is 0.12/3 = 0.04, so this project would appear at the bottom of 
the ranking. However, notice that three of the 190 employees are not being used after the 
first four projects are selected. As a result, it would make sense to take on this project even 
though it would be ranked last. This shortcoming can also affect highly ranked projects. 
For example, in Table 7.1, suppose Project III had an NPV of only $25 million, making 
it significantly worse than the other projects. Then the best choice would be Project I even 
though Project II has a higher profitability index.
In many cases, the firm may face multiple resource constraints. For instance, there may 
be a budget limit as well as a headcount constraint. If more than one resource constraint 
is binding, then there is no simple index that can be used to rank projects. Instead, linear 
and integer programming techniques have been developed specifically to tackle this kind of 
problem. Even if the set of alternatives is large, by using these techniques on a computer we 
can readily calculate the set of projects that will maximize the total NPV while satisfying 
multiple constraints (see Further Reading for references).
Concept Check	
1.	 Explain why ranking projects according to their NPV might not be optimal when you evaluate 
projects with different resource requirements.
	
2.	 How can the profitability index be used to identify attractive projects when there are resource 
constraints?
7.1  NPV and Stand-Alone Projects
	
n	 If your objective is to maximize wealth, the NPV rule always gives the correct answer.
	
n	 The difference between the cost of capital and the IRR is the maximum amount of estimation 
error that can exist in the cost of capital estimate without altering the original decision.
7.2  The Internal Rate of Return Rule
	
n	 IRR investment rule: Take any investment opportunity whose IRR exceeds the opportunity 
cost of capital. Turn down any opportunity whose IRR is less than the opportunity cost of 
capital.
	
n	 Unless all of the negative cash flows of the project precede the positive ones, the IRR rule may 
give the wrong answer and should not be used. Furthermore, there may be multiple IRRs or the 
IRR may not exist.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.

7.3  The Payback Rule
	
n	 Payback investment rule: Calculate the amount of time it takes to pay back the initial invest-
ment (the payback period). If the payback period is less than a prespecified length of time, 
accept the project. Otherwise, turn it down.
	
n	 The payback rule is simple, and favors short-term investments. But it is often incorrect.
7.4  Choosing Between Projects
	
n	 When choosing among mutually exclusive investment opportunities, pick the opportunity with 
the highest NPV.
	
n	 We cannot use the IRR to compare investment opportunities unless the investments have the 
same scale, timing, and risk.
	
n	 Incremental IRR: When comparing two mutually exclusive opportunities, the incremental IRR 
is the IRR of the difference between the cash flows of the two alternatives. The incremental IRR 
indicates the discount rate at which the optimal project choice changes.
7.5  Project Selection with Resource Constraints
	
n	 When choosing among projects competing for the same resource, rank the projects by their 
profitability indices and pick the set of projects with the highest profitability indices that can 
still be undertaken given the limited resource.
	
Profitability Index =
Value Created
Resource Consumed =
NPV
Resource Consumed
(7.2)
	
n	 The profitability index is only completely reliable if the set of projects taken following the 
profitability index ranking completely exhausts the available resource and there is only a single 
relevant resource constraint.

Data Case
Your success in business thus far has put you in a position to purchase a home for $500,000 located 
close to the university you attend. You plan to pay a 20% down payment of $100,000 and borrow the 
remaining $400,000. You need to decide on a mortgage, and realize you can apply the skills you have 
acquired in the last several chapters to evaluate your choices. To find the available options, go to www
.bankrate.com. Select “Mortgages,” then “Mortgage Rates.” For location, choose the nearest large 
city; for mortgage type, choose purchase (not refinance). Consider 30-year fixed rate mortgages with 
20% down, and assume your credit score is the highest possible.
Consider all the options by selecting loans with “All points.” Update rates and sort by “Rate” 
to find the loan with the lowest rate (not APR). Record the rate, points, fees, “APR,” and monthly 
payment for this loan.
Next consider only loans with “0 points” and find the loan with the lowest fees. Again, record the 
rate, points, fees, “APR,” and monthly payment for this loan.
First, use the annuity formula or PMT function in Excel to verify the monthly payment for each 
loan. (Note that to convert the “Rate” to a monthly interest rate you must divide by 12. Your result 
may differ slightly due to rounding.)
Next, calculate the actual amount you will receive from each loan after both fees and points. 
(Note that fees are a fixed dollar amount; points are also paid up front and are calculated as a % of 
the loan amount.) Using this net amount as the amount you will receive (rather than $400,000), 
show that the quoted “APR” of the loan is the effective IRR of the loan once all fees are included 
(you may use the Rate function in Excel, or calculate the NPV at the quoted “APR”). 
Compare the loans, assuming you will keep them for 30 years, as follows:
	
1.	 Compute the incremental cash flows of the lower rate loan; that is, determine how much more 
you will pay in fees, and how much you will save on your monthly payment.
	
2.	 What is the payback period of the lower rate loan? That is, how many years of lower monthly 
payments will it take to save an amount equal to the higher fees?
	
3.	 What is the IRR associated with paying the higher fees for the lower rate loan? (Again, the RATE 
function can be used.)
	
4.	 Plot the NPV profile of the decision to pay points for the lower rate loan. Do the NPV rule and 
the IRR rule coincide?
	
	 Next, compare the loans assuming you expect to keep them for only 5 years:
	
5.	 Compute the final payment you will need to make to pay off each loan at the end of 5 years 
(Hint: the FV function in Excel can be used). Which loan will be more expensive to repay?
	
6.	 Including the incremental cost to repay the loan after 5 years, what is the IRR and NPV profile 
associated with paying points now?
Create a data table showing the NPV of paying points for different horizons (1 to 30 years) and 
­different discount rates (0% to the IRR in (3) above). What can you conclude about whether it is a good 
idea to pay points?
Suppose the bank gives you the option to increase either loan amount so that for either loan, you will 
receive $400,000 today after all fees and points are paid. How would this affect your decision to pay points?
Note: Updates to this data case may be found at www.berkdemarzo.com.

Computing the NPV Profile Using 
Excel’s Data Table Function
chapter 7 
appendix
As the examples in this chapter demonstrate, interpreting the IRR can be difficult without see-
ing an investment’s full NPV profile. Calculating the NPV for each discount rate can be tedious, 
however. Here we show an easy method to do so using Excel’s Data Table functionality.
Consider the NPV and IRR calculations associated with Figure 7.3. As shown in cell 
B6, the investment has a positive NPV of 11.08 at a 5% discount rate. The project also 
has two IRRs, shown in cells B8:B9, which we can find by using Excel’s IRR function with 
different initial guesses.
The NPV profile of the project—which shows the NPV for a range of discount rates from 
0% to 50%—is shown in cells H2:I13, and corresponds to the data plotted in Figure 7.3. We 
could construct the NPV profile by plugging each discount rate into cell B1 and recording the 
resultant NPV from cell B6. Fortunately, Excel automates this “what-if ” analysis using a data 
table. To build the data table, we first enter a column (or row) of data with the discount rates we 
would like to try, as shown in cells H3:H13. The top of the next column, in cell I2, is a formula 
whose output we would like to record. In this case the formula in I2 is simply “= B6”, the NPV 
we calculated. To build the data table, we then select cells H2:I13 as shown below, and bring up 
the Data Table window (from the Data 7 What-If Analysis menu, or keyboard shortcut Alt-
D-T). There we enter B1 as the “column input cell” to indicate that each entry in the column 
of discount rates should be substituted into cell B1. Upon clicking “OK,” Excel will try each 
discount rate and record the resulting NPV in the table, generating the NPV profile. Moreover, 
the data table will automatically update should we change any of the project cash flows.

IN earLY 2008, MCDOnald’S COrp., the WOrLD’S ­LeaDING 
fast food restaurant, announced that it would add cappuccinos, lattes, and mochas to 
its menu of nearly 14,000 U.S. locations over the next two years. John Betts, vice presi-
dent of national beverage strategy, described the introduction as “the biggest endeavor 
for McDonald’s since our introduction of breakfast 35 years ago.” Betts added that 
McDonald’s menu enhancements could add up to $1 billion in sales. The decision by 
McDonald’s to introduce “high-end” coffee options to its menu represents a classic 
capital budgeting decision. To make such decisions, McDonald’s relies primarily on the 
NPV rule. But how can managers quantify the cost and benefits of a project like this 
one to compute its NPV?
An important responsibility of corporate financial managers is determining which 
projects or investments a firm should undertake. Capital budgeting, the focus of this 
chapter, is the process of analyzing investment opportunities and deciding which ones 
to accept. As we learned in Chapter 7, the NPV rule is the most accurate and reliable 
method for allocating the firm’s resources so as to maximize its value. To implement the 
NPV rule, we must compute the NPV of our projects and only accept those for which 
the NPV is positive. The first step in this process is to forecast the project’s revenues 
and costs, and from them estimate the project’s expected future cash flows. In this 
chapter, we will consider in detail the process of estimating a project’s expected cash 
flows, which are crucial inputs in the investment decision process. Using these cash 
flows, we can then compute the project’s NPV—its contribution to shareholder value. 
Finally, because the cash flow forecasts almost always contain uncertainty, we demon-
strate how to compute the sensitivity of the NPV to the uncertainty in the forecasts.

8.1	 Forecasting Earnings
A capital budget lists the projects and investments that a company plans to undertake 
­during the coming year. To determine this list, firms analyze alternative projects and decide 
which ones to accept through a process called capital budgeting. This process begins with 
forecasts of the project’s future consequences for the firm. Some of these consequences will 
affect the firm’s revenues; others will affect its costs. Our ultimate goal is to determine the 
effect of the decision on the firm’s cash flows, and evaluate the NPV of these cash flows to 
assess the consequences of the decision for the firm’s value.
As we emphasized in Chapter 2, earnings are not actual cash flows. However, as a practi-
cal matter, to derive the forecasted cash flows of a project, financial managers often begin 
by forecasting earnings. Thus, we begin by determining the incremental earnings of a 
project—that is, the amount by which the firm’s earnings are expected to change as a result 
of the investment decision. Then, in Section 8.2, we demonstrate how to use the incremen-
tal earnings to forecast the cash flows of the project.
Let’s consider a hypothetical capital budgeting decision faced by managers of the router 
division of Cisco Systems, a maker of networking hardware. Cisco is considering the develop-
ment of a wireless home networking appliance, called HomeNet, that will provide both the 
hardware and the software necessary to run an entire home from any Internet ­connection. In 
addition to connecting computers and smartphones, HomeNet will control Internet-based 
telepresence and phone systems, home entertainment systems, heating and air-conditioning 
units, major appliances, security systems, office equipment, and so on. Cisco has already 
conducted an intensive, $300,000 feasibility study to assess the attractiveness of the new 
product.
Revenue and Cost Estimates
We begin by reviewing the revenue and cost estimates for HomeNet. HomeNet’s target 
market is upscale residential “smart” homes and home offices. Based on extensive market-
ing surveys, the sales forecast for HomeNet is 100,000 units per year. Given the pace of 
technological change, Cisco expects the product will have a four-year life. It will be sold 
through high-end electronics stores for a retail price of $375, with an expected wholesale 
price of $260.
Developing the new hardware will be relatively inexpensive, as existing technologies 
can be simply repackaged in a newly designed, home-friendly box. Industrial design 
teams will make the box and its packaging aesthetically pleasing to the residential mar-
ket. Cisco expects total engineering and design costs to amount to $5 million. Once the 
design is finalized, actual production will be outsourced at a cost (including packaging) 
of $110 per unit.
In addition to the hardware requirements, Cisco must build a new software application 
to allow virtual control of the home from the Web. This software development project 
requires coordination with each of the Web appliance manufacturers and is expected to 
take a dedicated team of 50 software engineers a full year to complete. The cost of a soft-
ware engineer (including benefits and related costs) is $200,000 per year. To verify the 
compatibility of new consumer Internet-ready appliances with the HomeNet system as 
they become available, Cisco must also install new equipment that will require an upfront 
investment of $7.5 million.
The software and hardware design will be completed, and the new equipment will be 
operational, at the end of one year. At that time, HomeNet will be ready to ship. Cisco 
expects to spend $2.8 million per year on marketing and support for this product.

Incremental Earnings Forecast
Given the revenue and cost estimates, we can forecast HomeNet’s incremental earnings, as 
shown in the spreadsheet in Table 8.1. After the product is developed in year 0, it will gen-
erate sales of 100,000 units * $260/unit = $26 million each year for the next four years. 
The cost of producing these units is 100,000 units * $110/unit = $11 million per year. 
Thus, HomeNet will produce a gross profit of $26 million - $11 million = $15 million 
per year, as shown in line 3 of Table 8.1. Note that while revenues and costs occur through-
out the year, we adopt the standard convention of listing revenues and costs at the end of 
the year in which they occur.1
The project’s operating expenses include $2.8 million per year in marketing and support 
costs, which are listed as selling, general, and administrative expenses. In year 0, Cisco will 
spend $5 million on design and engineering, together with 50 * $200,000 = $10 million 
on software, for a total of $15 million in research and development expenditures.
Capital Expenditures and Depreciation.  HomeNet also requires $7.5 million in equip-
ment that will be required to allow third-party manufacturers to upload the specifica-
tions and verify the compatibility of any new Internet-ready appliances that they might 
produce. To encourage the development of compatible products and provide service for 
existing customers, Cisco expects to continue to operate this equipment even after they 
phase out the current version of the product. Recall from Chapter 2 that while invest-
ments in plant, property, and equipment are a cash expense, they are not directly listed 
as expenses when calculating earnings. Instead, the firm deducts a fraction of the cost 
of these items each year as depreciation. Several different methods are used to compute 
depreciation. The simplest method is straight-line depreciation, in which the asset’s cost 
(less any expected salvage value) is divided equally over its estimated useful life (we discuss 
other methods in Section 8.4). If we assume the equipment is purchased at the end of 
year 0, and then use straight-line depreciation over a five-year life for the new equipment, 
HomeNet’s depreciation expense is $1.5 million per year in years 1 through 5.2 Deducting 
1As a result, cash flows that occur at the end of one year will be listed in a different column than those 
that occur at the start of the next year, even though they may occur only weeks apart. When additional 
­precision is required, cash flows are often estimated on a quarterly or monthly basis. (See also the ­appendix 
to Chapter 5 for a method of converting continuously arriving cash flows to annual ones.)
2Recall that although new product sales have ceased, the equipment will remain in use in year 5. Note also 
that as in Chapter 2, we list depreciation expenses separately rather than include them with other expenses 
(i.e., COGS, SG&A, and R&D are “clean” and do not include non-cash expenses. Using clean expenses 
is preferred in financial models.)

Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
these depreciation expenses leads to the forecast for HomeNet’s earnings before interest 
and taxes (EBIT) shown in line 7 of Table 8.1. This treatment of capital expenditures is 
one of the key reasons why earnings are not an accurate representation of cash flows.
Interest Expenses.  In Chapter 2, we saw that to compute a firm’s net income, we must 
first deduct interest expenses from EBIT. When evaluating a capital budgeting decision 
like the HomeNet project, however, we generally do not include interest expenses. Any incre-
mental interest expenses will be related to the firm’s decision regarding how to finance the 
project. Here we wish to evaluate the project on its own, separate from the financing 
­decision.3 Thus, we evaluate the HomeNet project as if Cisco will not use any debt to 
finance it (whether or not that is actually the case), and we postpone the consideration of 
alternative financing choices until Part 5 of the book. For this reason, we refer to the net 
income we compute in the spreadsheet in Table 8.1 as the unlevered net income of the 
project, to indicate that it does not include any interest expenses associated with debt.
Taxes.  The final expense we must account for is corporate taxes. The correct tax rate 
to use is the firm’s marginal corporate tax rate, which is the tax rate it will pay on an 
incremental dollar of pre-tax income. In Table 8.1, we assume the marginal corporate tax 
rate for the HomeNet project is 40% each year. The incremental income tax expense is 
calculated in line 8 as
	
Income Tax = EBIT * tc	
(8.1)
where tc is the firm’s marginal corporate tax rate.
In year 1, HomeNet will contribute an additional $10.7 million to Cisco’s EBIT, which 
will result in an additional $10.7 million * 40% = $4.28 million in corporate tax that 
Cisco will owe. We deduct this amount to determine HomeNet’s after-tax contribution to 
net income.
In year 0, however, HomeNet’s EBIT is negative. Are taxes relevant in this case? Yes. 
HomeNet will reduce Cisco’s taxable income in year 0 by $15 million. As long as Cisco 
earns taxable income elsewhere in year 0 against which it can offset HomeNet’s losses, 
Cisco will owe $15 million * 40% = $6 million less in taxes in year 0. The firm should 
credit this tax savings to the HomeNet project. A similar credit applies in year 5, when the 
firm claims its final depreciation expense for the equipment.
3This approach is motivated by the Separation Principle (see Chapter 3): When securities are fairly priced, 
the net present value of a fixed set of cash flows is independent of how those cash flows are financed. Later 
in the text, we will consider cases in which financing may influence the project’s value, and we will extend 
our capital budgeting techniques accordingly in Chapter 18.
Example 8.1
Taxing Losses for Projects in Profitable Companies
Problem
Kellogg Company plans to launch a new line of high-fiber, gluten-free breakfast pastries. The 
heavy advertising expenses associated with the new product launch will generate operating losses 
of $15 million next year for the product. Kellogg expects to earn pretax income of $460 ­million 
from operations other than the new pastries next year. If Kellogg pays a 40% tax rate on its 
­pretax income, what will it owe in taxes next year without the new pastry product? What will it 
owe with the new pastries?

Unlevered Net Income Calculation.  We can express the calculation in the Table  8.1 
spreadsheet as the following shorthand formula for unlevered net income:
 Unlevered Net Income = EBIT * (1 - tc)
 = (Revenues - Costs - Depreciation) * (1 - tc)
(8.2)
That is, a project’s unlevered net income is equal to its incremental revenues less costs and 
depreciation, evaluated on an after-tax basis.4
Indirect Effects on Incremental Earnings
When computing the incremental earnings of an investment decision, we should include 
all changes between the firm’s earnings with the project versus without the project. Thus 
far, we have analyzed only the direct effects of the HomeNet project. But HomeNet may 
have indirect consequences for other operations within Cisco. Because these indirect effects 
will also affect Cisco’s earnings, we must include them in our analysis.
Opportunity Costs.  Many projects use a resource that the company already owns. Because 
the firm does not need to pay cash to acquire this resource for a new project, it is tempting 
to assume that the resource is available for free. However, in many cases the resource could 
provide value for the firm in another opportunity or project. The opportunity cost of using 
a resource is the value it could have provided in its best alternative use.5 Because this value is 
lost when the resource is used by another project, we should include the opportunity cost as 
an incremental cost of the project. In the case of the HomeNet project, suppose the project 
will require space for a new lab. Even though the lab will be housed in an existing facility, we 
must include the opportunity cost of not using the space in an alternative way.
4Unlevered net income is sometimes also referred to as net operating profit after tax (NOPAT).
5In Chapter 5, we defined the opportunity cost of capital as the rate you could earn on an alternative 
investment with equivalent risk. We similarly define the opportunity cost of using an existing asset in a 
project as the cash flow generated by the next-best alternative use for the asset.
	
8.1  Forecasting Earnings	
275
Solution
Without the new pastries, Kellogg will owe $460 million * 40% =$184 million in corporate 
taxes next year. With the new pastries, Kellogg’s pretax income next year will be only 
$460  mil­lion -$15 million =$445 million,  and it will owe $445 million * 40% = $178 mil­
lion in tax. Thus, launching the new product reduces Kellogg’s taxes next year by $184 million 
-$178  mil­lion = $6 million.
Example 8.2 
The Opportunity Cost of HomeNet’s Lab Space
Problem
Suppose HomeNet’s new lab will be housed in warehouse space that the company would have 
otherwise rented out for $200,000 per year during years 1–4. How does this opportunity cost 
affect HomeNet’s incremental earnings?
Solution
In this case, the opportunity cost of the warehouse space is the forgone rent. This cost would reduce 
HomeNet’s incremental earnings during years 1–4 by $200,000 * (1 - 40%) = $120,000, the 
after-tax benefit of renting out the warehouse space.

276	
Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
Project Externalities.  Project externalities are indirect effects of the project that may 
increase or decrease the profits of other business activities of the firm. For instance, in the 
McDonald’s example in the chapter introduction, some cappuccino purchasers would oth-
erwise have bought an alternative beverage, like a soft drink. When sales of a new product 
displace sales of an existing product, the situation is often referred to as cannibalization. 
Suppose that approximately 25% of HomeNet’s sales come from customers who would 
have purchased an existing Cisco wireless router if HomeNet were not available. If this 
reduction in sales of the existing wireless router is a consequence of the decision to develop 
HomeNet, then we must include it when calculating HomeNet’s incremental earnings.
The spreadsheet in Table  8.2 recalculates HomeNet’s incremental earnings forecast 
including the opportunity cost of the lab space and the expected cannibalization of the 
existing product. The opportunity cost of the lab space in Example 8.2 increases selling, 
general, and administrative expenses from $2.8 million to $3.0 million. For the cannibal-
ization, suppose that the existing router wholesales for $100 so the expected loss in sales is
	
$25% * 100,000 units * $100/unit = $2.5 million
Compared to Table 8.1, the sales forecast falls from $26 million to $23.5 million. In addi-
tion, suppose the cost of the existing router is $60 per unit. Then, because Cisco will no 
longer need to produce as many of its existing wireless routers, the incremental cost of 
goods sold for the HomeNet project is reduced by
25% * 100,000 units * ($60 cost per unit) = $1.5 million
from $11 million to $9.5 million. HomeNet’s incremental gross profit therefore declines 
by $2.5 million - $1.5 million = $1 million once we account for this externality.
Thus, comparing the spreadsheets in Table 8.1 and Table 8.2, our forecast for HomeNet’s 
unlevered net income in years 1–4 declines from $6.42 million to $5.7 million due to the 
lost rent of the lab space and the lost sales of the existing router.
The Opportunity Cost of an Idle Asset
A common mistake is to conclude that if an asset is cur-
rently idle, its opportunity cost is zero. For example, the firm 
might have a warehouse that is currently empty or a machine 
that is not being used. Often, the asset may have been idled 
in anticipation of taking on the new project, and would have 
otherwise been put to use by the firm. Even if the firm has 
no alternative use for the asset, the firm could choose to sell 
or rent the asset. The value obtained from the asset’s alterna-
tive use, sale, or rental represents an opportunity cost that 
must be included as part of the incremental cash flows.

Sunk Costs and Incremental Earnings
A sunk cost is any unrecoverable cost for which the firm is already liable. Sunk costs 
have been or will be paid regardless of the decision about whether or not to proceed with 
the project. Therefore, they are not incremental with respect to the current decision and 
should not be included in its analysis. For this reason, we did not include in our analysis 
the $300,000 already expended on the marketing and feasibility studies for HomeNet. 
Because this $300,000 has already been spent, it is a sunk cost. A good rule to remember 
is that if our decision does not affect the cash flow, then the cash flow should not affect our deci-
sion. Below are some common examples of sunk costs you may encounter.
Fixed Overhead Expenses.  Overhead expenses are associated with activities that are not 
directly attributable to a single business activity but instead affect many different areas of 
the corporation. These expenses are often allocated to the different business activities for 
accounting purposes. To the extent that these overhead costs are fixed and will be incurred 
in any case, they are not incremental to the project and should not be included. Only 
include as incremental expenses the additional overhead expenses that arise because of the 
decision to take on the project.
Past Research and Development Expenditures.  When a firm has already devoted sig-
nificant resources to develop a new product, there may be a tendency to continue invest-
ing in the product even if market conditions have changed and the product is unlikely to 
be viable. The rationale sometimes given is that if the product is abandoned, the money 
that has already been invested will be “wasted.” In other cases, a decision is made to 
abandon a project because it cannot possibly be successful enough to recoup the invest-
ment that has already been made. In fact, neither argument is correct: Any money that 
has already been spent is a sunk cost and therefore irrelevant. The decision to continue or 
abandon should be based only on the incremental costs and benefits of the product going 
forward.
Unavoidable Competitive Effects.  When developing a new product, firms often worry 
about the cannibalization of their existing products. But if sales are likely to decline in any 
case as a result of new products introduced by competitors, then these lost sales are a sunk 
cost and we should not include them in our projections.
	
8.1  Forecasting Earnings	
277
The Sunk Cost Fallacy
Sunk cost fallacy is a term used to describe the tendency of 
people to be influenced by sunk costs and to “throw good 
money after bad.” That is, people sometimes continue to 
invest in a project that has a negative NPV because they 
have already invested a large amount in the project and 
feel that by not continuing it, the prior investment will 
be wasted. The sunk cost fallacy is also sometimes called 
the “Concorde effect,” a term that refers to the British and 
French governments’ decision to continue funding the 
joint development of the Concorde aircraft even after it 
was clear that sales of the plane would fall far short of what 
was necessary to justify the cost of continuing its devel-
opment. Although the project was viewed by the British 
government as a commercial and financial disaster, the 
political implications of halting the project—and thereby 
publicly admitting that all past expenses on the project 
would result in nothing—ultimately prevented either gov-
ernment from abandoning the project.
It is important to note that sunk costs need not always 
be in the past. Any cash flows, even future ones, that will 
not be affected by the decision at hand are effectively sunk, 
and should not be included in our incremental forecast. 
For example, if Cisco believes it will lose some sales on its 
other products whether or not it launches HomeNet, these 
lost sales are a sunk cost that should not be included as 
part of the cannibalization adjustments in Table 8.2.

Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
Real-World Complexities
We have simplified the HomeNet example in an effort to focus on the types of effects 
that financial managers consider when estimating a project’s incremental earnings. For a 
real project, however, the estimates of these revenues and costs are likely to be much more 
complicated. For instance, our assumption that the same number of HomeNet units will 
be sold each year is probably unrealistic. A new product typically has lower sales initially, as 
customers gradually become aware of the product. Sales will then accelerate, plateau, and 
ultimately decline as the product nears obsolescence or faces increased competition.
Similarly, the average selling price of a product and its cost of production will gener-
ally change over time. Prices and costs tend to rise with the general level of inflation in 
the economy. The prices of technology products, however, often fall over time as newer, 
superior technologies emerge and production costs decline. For most industries, competi-
tion tends to reduce profit margins over time. These factors should be considered when 
­estimating a project’s revenues and costs.
Example 8.3
Product Adoption and Price Changes
Problem
Suppose sales of HomeNet were expected to be 100,000 units in year 1, 125,000 units in years 2 
and 3, and 50,000 units in year 4. Suppose also that HomeNet’s sale price and manufacturing cost 
are expected to decline by 10% per year, as with other networking products. By contrast, selling, 
general, and administrative expenses are expected to rise with inflation by 4% per year. Update the 
incremental earnings forecast in the spreadsheet in Table 8.2 to account for these effects.
Solution
HomeNet’s incremental earnings with these new assumptions are shown in the spreadsheet 
below:
For example, sale prices in year 2 will be $260 * 0.90 = $234 per unit for HomeNet, and 
$100 * 0.90 = $90 per unit for the cannibalized product. Thus, incremental sales in year 2 
are equal to 125,000 units * ($234 per unit) - 31,250 cannibalized units * ($90 per unit) 
= $26.438 million.

8.2	 Determining Free Cash Flow and NPV
As discussed in Chapter 2, earnings are an accounting measure of the firm’s performance. 
They do not represent real profits: The firm cannot use its earnings to buy goods, pay 
employees, fund new investments, or pay dividends to shareholders. To do those things, 
a firm needs cash. Thus, to evaluate a capital budgeting decision, we must determine its 
consequences for the firm’s available cash. The incremental effect of a project on the firm’s 
available cash, separate from any financing decisions, is the project’s free cash flow.
In this section, we forecast the free cash flow of the HomeNet project using the earnings 
forecasts we developed in Section 8.1. We then use this forecast to calculate the NPV of 
the project.
Calculating Free Cash Flow from Earnings
As discussed in Chapter 2, there are important differences between earnings and cash flow. 
Earnings include non-cash charges, such as depreciation, but do not include the cost of 
capital investment. To determine HomeNet’s free cash flow from its incremental earnings, 
we must adjust for these differences.
Capital Expenditures and Depreciation.  Depreciation is not a cash expense that is paid 
by the firm. Rather, it is a method used for accounting and tax purposes to allocate the 
original purchase cost of the asset over its life. Because depreciation is not a cash flow, we 
do not include it in the cash flow forecast. Instead, we include the actual cash cost of the 
asset when it is purchased.
To compute HomeNet’s free cash flow, we must add back to earnings the depreciation 
expense for the new equipment (a non-cash charge) and subtract the actual capital expen-
diture of $7.5 million that will be paid for the equipment in year 0. We show these adjust-
ments in lines 10 and 11 of the spreadsheet in Table 8.3 (which is based on the incremental 
earnings forecast of Table 8.2).

Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
Net Working Capital (NWC).  In Chapter  2, we defined net working capital as the 
­difference between current assets and current liabilities. The main components of net 
working capital are cash, inventory, receivables, and payables:
	
 Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
	
 = Cash + Inventory + Receivables - Payables	
(8.3)
Most projects will require the firm to invest in net working capital. Firms may need to 
maintain a minimum cash balance6 to meet unexpected expenditures, and inventories of 
raw materials and finished product to accommodate production uncertainties and demand 
fluctuations. Also, customers may not pay for the goods they purchase immediately. While 
sales are immediately counted as part of earnings, the firm does not receive any cash until 
the customers actually pay. In the interim, the firm includes the amount that customers 
owe in its receivables. Thus, the firm’s receivables measure the total credit that the firm has 
extended to its customers. In the same way, payables measure the credit the firm has 
received from its suppliers. The difference between receivables and payables is the net 
amount of the firm’s capital that is consumed as a result of these credit transactions, known 
as trade credit.
Suppose that HomeNet will have no incremental cash or inventory requirements (prod-
ucts will be shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to customers). However, 
receivables related to HomeNet are expected to account for 15% of annual sales, and pay-
ables are expected to be 15% of the annual cost of goods sold (COGS).7 HomeNet’s net 
working capital requirements are shown in the spreadsheet in Table 8.4.
Table 8.4 shows that the HomeNet project will require no net working capital in year 
0, $2.1 million in net working capital in years 1–4, and no net working capital in year 5. 
How does this requirement affect the project’s free cash flow? Any increases in net working 
capital represent an investment that reduces the cash available to the firm and so reduces 
free cash flow. We define the increase in net working capital in year t as
	
NWCt = NWCt - NWCt - 1	
(8.4)
6The cash included in net working capital is cash that is not invested to earn a market rate of return. It 
includes non-invested cash held in the firm’s checking account, in a company safe or cash box, in cash 
registers (for retail stores), and other sites, which is needed to run the business.
7If customers take N days to pay, then accounts receivable will consist of those sales that occurred in the last 
N days. If sales are evenly distributed throughout the year, receivables will equal (N/365) times annual sales. 
Thus, receivables equal to 15% of sales corresponds to an average payment period of N = 15% * 365 = 55 
accounts receivable days. The same is true for payables. (See also Eq. 2.11 in Chapter 2.)

We can use our forecast of HomeNet’s net working capital requirements to complete 
our estimate of HomeNet’s free cash flow in Table 8.3. In year 1, net working capital 
increases by $2.1 million. This increase represents a cost to the firm as shown in line 12 of 
Table 8.3. This reduction of free cash flow corresponds to the fact that $3.525 million of 
the firm’s sales in year 1 and $1.425 million of its costs have not yet been paid.
In years 2–4, net working capital does not change, so no further contributions are 
needed. In year 5, after the project is shut down, net working capital falls by $2.1 million 
as the payments of the last customers are received and the final bills are paid. We add this 
$2.1 million to free cash flow in year 5, as shown in line 12 of Table 8.3.
Now that we have adjusted HomeNet’s unlevered net income for depreciation, capital 
expenditures, and increases to net working capital, we compute HomeNet’s free cash flow as 
shown in line 13 of the spreadsheet in Table 8.3. Note that in the first two years, free cash 
flow is lower than unlevered net income, reflecting the upfront investment in equipment 
and net working capital required by the project. In later years, free cash flow exceeds unle-
vered net income because depreciation is not a cash expense. In the last year, the firm ulti-
mately recovers the investment in net working capital, further boosting the free cash flow.
Example 8.4
 Net Working Capital with Changing Sales
Problem
Forecast the required investment in net working capital for HomeNet under the scenario in 
Example 8.3.
Solution
Required investments in net working capital are shown below:
In this case, working capital changes each year. A large initial investment in working capital is 
required in year 1, followed by a small investment in year 2 as sales continue to grow. Working 
capital is recovered in years 3–5 as sales decline.
	
8.2  Determining Free Cash Flow and NPV	
281
Calculating Free Cash Flow Directly
As we noted at the outset of this chapter, because practitioners usually begin the capital budget-
ing process by first forecasting earnings, we have chosen to do the same. However, we could have 
calculated the HomeNet’s free cash flow directly by using the following shorthand formula:
Free Cash Flow
	
Unlevered Net Income
	
Free Cash Flow = (Revenues - Costs - Depreciation) * (1 - tc)
+ Depreciation - CapEx - NWC
(8.5)
Note that we first deduct depreciation when computing the project’s incremental earnings, 
and then add it back (because it is a non-cash expense) when computing free cash flow.

Thus, the only effect of depreciation is to reduce the firm’s taxable income. Indeed, we can 
rewrite Eq. 8.5 as
	
Free Cash Flow = (Revenues - Costs) * (1 - tc) - CapEx - NWC
	
+ tc * Depreciation
(8.6)
The last term in Eq. 8.6, tc * Depreciation, is called the depreciation tax shield. It is the 
tax savings that results from the ability to deduct depreciation. As a consequence, deprecia-
tion expenses have a positive impact on free cash flow. Firms often report a different depre-
ciation expense for accounting and for tax purposes. Because only the tax consequences of 
depreciation are relevant for free cash flow, we should use the depreciation expense that the 
firm will use for tax purposes in our forecast.
Calculating the NPV
To compute HomeNet’s NPV, we must discount its free cash flow at the appropriate cost of 
capital.8 As discussed in Chapter 5, the cost of capital for a project is the expected return that 
investors could earn on their best alternative investment with similar risk and maturity. We will 
develop the techniques needed to estimate the cost of capital in Part 4. For now, we assume that 
Cisco’s managers believe that the HomeNet project will have similar risk to other projects within 
Cisco’s router division, and that the appropriate cost of capital for these projects is 12%.
Given this cost of capital, we compute the present value of each free cash flow in the 
future. As explained in Chapter 4, if the cost of capital r = 12%, the present value of the 
free cash flow in year t (or FCFt) is
	
PV(FCFt) =
FCFt
(1 + r)t = FCFt *
1
(1 + r)t
	
(8.7)
We compute the NPV of the HomeNet project in the spreadsheet in Table 8.5. Line 3 
calculates the discount factor, and line 4 multiplies the free cash flow by the discount factor 
to get the present value. The NPV of the project is the sum of the present values of each 
free cash flow, reported on line 5:9
NPV = -16,500 + 4554 + 5740 + 5125 + 4576 + 1532 = 5027
8Rather than draw a separate timeline for these cash flows, we can interpret the final line of the ­spreadsheet 
in Table 8.3 as the timeline.
9We can also compute the NPV using the Excel NPV function to calculate the present value of the cash 
flows in year 1 through 5, and then add the cash flow in year 0 (i.e., “ =NPV (r, FCF1:FCF5)+FCF0<).

Using Excel
Capital Budgeting 
Using a Spreadsheet 
Program
Capital budgeting forecasts and analysis are most easily performed in a spreadsheet program. 
Here we highlight a few best practices when developing your own capital budgets.
Create a Project Dashboard
All capital budgeting analyses begin with a set of assumptions regarding future revenues and 
costs associated with the investment. Centralize these assumptions within your spreadsheet in 
a project dashboard so they are easy to locate, review, and potentially modify. Here we show an 
example for the HomeNet project.
Color Code for Clarity
In spreadsheet models, use a blue font color to distinguish numerical assumptions from 
­formulas. For example, HomeNet’s revenue and cost estimates are set to a numerical value in 
year 1, whereas estimates in later years are set to equal to the year 1 estimates. It is therefore clear 
which cells contain the main assumptions, should we wish to change them at a later date.
Maintain Flexibility
In the HomeNet dashboard, note that we state all assumptions on an annual basis even if we 
expect them to remain constant. For example, we specify HomeNet’s unit volume and ­average 
sale price for each year. We can then calculate HomeNet revenues each year based on the 
corresponding annual assumptions. Doing so provides flexibility if we later determine that 
HomeNet’s adoption rate might vary over time or if we expect prices to follow a trend, as in 
Example 8.3.
Never Hardcode
So that your assumptions are clear and easy to modify, reference any numerical values you need 
to develop your projections in the project dashboard. Never “hardcode,” or enter numerical val-
ues directly into formulas. For example, in the computation of taxes in cell E34 below, we use the 
formula “ = -E21*E33< rather than “= -0.40*E33<. While the latter formula would compute 
the same answer, because the tax rate is hardcoded it would be difficult to update the model if 
the forecast for the tax rate were to change.

284	
Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
Based on our estimates, HomeNet’s NPV is $5.027 million. While HomeNet’s upfront 
cost is $16.5 million, the present value of the additional free cash flow that Cisco will 
receive from the project is $21.5 million. Thus, taking the HomeNet project is equivalent 
to Cisco having an extra $5 million in the bank today.
Concept Check	
1.	 What adjustments must you make to a project’s unlevered net income to determine its free cash 
flows?
	
2.	 What is the depreciation tax shield?
	
8.3	 Choosing Among Alternatives
Thus far, we have considered the capital budgeting decision to launch the HomeNet prod-
uct line. To analyze the decision, we computed the project’s free cash flow and calculated 
the NPV. Because not launching HomeNet produces an additional NPV of zero for the 
firm, launching HomeNet is the best decision for the firm if its NPV is positive. In many 
situations, however, we must compare mutually exclusive alternatives, each of which has 
consequences for the firm’s cash flows. As we explained in Chapter 7, in such cases we can 
make the best decision by first computing the free cash flow associated with each alterna-
tive and then choosing the alternative with the highest NPV.
Evaluating Manufacturing Alternatives
Suppose Cisco is considering an alternative manufacturing plan for the HomeNet product. 
The current plan is to fully outsource production at a cost of $110 per unit. Alternatively, 
Cisco could assemble the product in-house at a cost of $95 per unit. However, the latter 
option will require $5 million in upfront operating expenses to reorganize the assembly 
facility, and starting in year 1 Cisco will need to maintain inventory equal to one month’s 
production.
To choose between these two alternatives, we compute the free cash flow associated 
with each choice and compare their NPVs to see which is most advantageous for the 
firm. When comparing alternatives, we need to compare only those cash flows that differ 
between them. We can ignore any cash flows that are the same under either scenario (e.g., 
HomeNet’s revenues).
The spreadsheet in Table 8.6 compares the two assembly options, ­computing the NPV of 
the cash costs for each. The difference in EBIT results from the upfront cost of setting up the 
­in-house facility in year 0, and the differing assembly costs: $110/unit * 100,000 units/yr = 
$11 million/yr outsourced, versus $95/unit *100,000 units/yr =  $9.5 million/yr in-house. 
Adjusting for taxes, we see the consequences for unlevered net income on lines 3 and 9.
Because the options do not differ in terms of capital expenditures (there are none associ-
ated with assembly), to compare the free cash flow for each, we only need to adjust for their 
different net working capital requirements. If assembly is outsourced, payables account 
for 15% of the cost of goods, or 15% * $11 million = $1.65 million. This amount is the 
credit Cisco will receive from its supplier in year 1 and will maintain until year 5. Because 
Cisco will borrow this amount from its supplier, net working capital falls by $1.65 mil-
lion in year 1, adding to Cisco’s free cash flow. In year 5, Cisco’s net working capital will 
increase as Cisco pays its suppliers, and free cash flow will fall by an equal amount.

If assembly is done in-house, payables are 15% * $9.5 million = $1.425 million. 
However, Cisco will need to maintain inventory equal to one month’s production, which 
has cost of $9.5 million , 12 = $0.792 million. Thus, Cisco’s net working capital will 
decrease by $1.425 million - $0.792 million = $0.633 million in year 1 and will increase 
by the same amount in year 5.
Comparing Free Cash Flows for Cisco’s Alternatives
Adjusting for increases to net working capital, we compare the free cash flow of each alter-
native on lines 5 and 11 and compute their NPVs using the project’s 12% cost of capital.10 
In each case, the NPV is negative, as we are evaluating only the costs of production. Out-
sourcing, however, is somewhat cheaper, with a present value cost of $19.5 million versus 
$20.1 million if the units are produced in-house.11
Concept Check	
1.	 How do you choose between mutually exclusive capital budgeting decisions?
	
2.	 When choosing between alternatives, what cash flows can be ignored?
10While we assume it is not the case here, in some settings the risks of these options might differ from the 
risk of the project overall or from each other, requiring a different cost of capital for each case.
11It is also possible to compare these two cases in a single spreadsheet in which we compute the difference 
in the free cash flows directly, rather than compute the free cash flows separately for each option. We ­prefer 
to do them separately, as it is clearer and generalizes to the case when there are more than two options.

8.4	 Further Adjustments to Free Cash Flow
In this section, we consider a number of complications that can arise when estimating a 
project’s free cash flow, such as non-cash charges, alternative depreciation methods, liqui-
dation or continuation values, and tax loss carryforwards.
Other Non-Cash Items.  In general, other non-cash items that appear as part of incremental 
earnings should not be included in the project’s free cash flow. The firm should include only 
actual cash revenues or expenses. For example, the firm adds back any amortization of intan-
gible assets (such as patents) to unlevered net income when calculating free cash flow.
Timing of Cash Flows.  For simplicity, we have treated the cash flows for HomeNet as if 
they occur at the end of each year. In reality, cash flows will be spread throughout the year. 
We can forecast free cash flow on a quarterly, monthly, or even continuous basis when 
greater accuracy is required.
Accelerated Depreciation.  Because depreciation contributes positively to the firm’s cash 
flow through the depreciation tax shield, it is in the firm’s best interest to use the most 
accelerated method of depreciation that is allowable for tax purposes. By doing so, the 
firm will accelerate its tax savings and increase their present value. In the United States, the 
most accelerated depreciation method allowed by the IRS is MACRS (Modified Acceler-
ated Cost Recovery System) depreciation. With MACRS depreciation, the firm first cat-
egorizes assets according to their recovery period. Based on the recovery period, MACRS 
depreciation tables assign a fraction of the purchase price that the firm can recover each 
year. We provide MACRS tables and recovery periods for common assets in the appendix.
Example 8.5
Computing Accelerated Depreciation
Problem
What depreciation deduction would be allowed for HomeNet’s equipment using the MACRS 
method, assuming the equipment is put into use by the end of year 0 and designated to have a 
five-year recovery period?
Solution
Table 8A.1 in the appendix provides the percentage of the cost that can be depreciated each year. 
Based on the table, the allowable depreciation expense for the lab equipment is shown below (in 
thousands of dollars):
As long as the equipment is put into use by the end of year 0, the tax code allows us to take our 
first depreciation expense in the same year. Compared with straight-line depreciation, the MACRS 
method allows for larger depreciation deductions earlier in the asset’s life, which increases the pres-
ent value of the depreciation tax shield and so will raise the project’s NPV. In the case of HomeNet, 
MACRS depreciation increases NPV by over $300,000 to $5.34 million.

Liquidation or Salvage Value.  Assets that are no longer needed often have a resale value, or 
some salvage value if the parts are sold for scrap. Some assets may have a negative liquidation 
value. For example, it may cost money to remove and dispose of the used equipment.

In the calculation of free cash flow, we include the liquidation value of any assets that are no 
longer needed and may be disposed of. When an asset is liquidated, any gain on sale is taxed. We 
calculate the gain on sale as the difference between the sale price and the book value of the asset:
	
Gain on Sale = Sale Price - Book Value	
(8.8)
The book value is equal to the asset’s original cost less the amount it has already been 
depreciated for tax purposes:
	
Book Value = Purchase Price - Accumulated Depreciation	
(8.9)
We must adjust the project’s free cash flow to account for the after-tax cash flow that 
would result from an asset sale:12
	
After@Tax Cash Flow from Asset Sale = Sale Price - (tc * Gain on Sale)	
(8.10)
12When the sale price is less than the original purchase price of the asset, the gain on sale is treated as 
a recapture of depreciation and taxed as ordinary income. If the sale price exceeds the original purchase 
price, then this portion of the gain on sale is considered a capital gain, and in some cases may be taxed at 
a lower capital gains tax rate.
Example 8.6
Adding Salvage Value to Free Cash Flow
Problem
Suppose that in addition to the $7.5 million in new equipment required for HomeNet, some 
equipment will be transferred to the lab from another Cisco facility. This equipment has a resale 
value of $2 million and a book value of $1 million. If the equipment is kept rather than sold, 
its remaining book value can be depreciated next year. When the lab is shut down in year 5, 
the equipment will have a salvage value of $800,000. What adjustments must we make to 
HomeNet’s free cash flow in this case?
Solution
The existing equipment could have been sold for $2 million. The after-tax proceeds from this 
sale are an opportunity cost of using the equipment in the HomeNet lab. Thus, we must reduce 
HomeNet’s free cash flow in year 0 by the sale price less any taxes that would have been owed had 
the sale occurred: $2 million - 40% * ($2 million - $1 million) = $1.6 million.
In year 1, the remaining $1 million book value of the equipment can be depreciated, creat-
ing a depreciation tax shield of 40% * $1 million = $400,000. In year 5, the firm will sell the 
equipment for a salvage value of $800,000. Because the equipment will be fully depreciated at 
that time, the entire amount will be taxable as a capital gain, so the after-tax cash flow from the 
sale is $800,000 * (1 - 40%) = $480,000.
The spreadsheet below shows these adjustments to the free cash flow from the spreadsheet in 
Table 8.3 and recalculates HomeNet’s free cash flow and NPV in this case.

Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
Terminal or Continuation Value.  Sometimes the firm explicitly forecasts free cash flow 
over a shorter horizon than the full horizon of the project or investment. This is nec-
essarily true for investments with an indefinite life, such as an expansion of the firm. 
In this case, we estimate the value of the remaining free cash flow beyond the forecast 
horizon by including an additional, one-time cash flow at the end of the forecast horizon 
called the terminal or continuation value of the project. This amount represents the 
market value (as of the last forecast period) of the free cash flow from the project at all 
future dates.
Depending on the setting, we use different methods for estimating the continuation 
value of an investment. For example, when analyzing investments with long lives, it is com-
mon to explicitly calculate free cash flow over a short horizon, and then assume that cash 
flows grow at some constant rate beyond the forecast horizon.
Example 8.7
Continuation Value with Perpetual Growth
Problem
Base Hardware is considering opening a set of new retail stores. The free cash flow projections for 
the new stores are shown below (in millions of dollars):
After year 4, Base Hardware expects free cash flow from the stores to increase at a rate of 5% per 
year. If the appropriate cost of capital for this investment is 10%, what continuation value in year 4 
captures the value of future free cash flows in year 5 and beyond? What is the NPV of the new stores?
Solution
Because the future free cash flow beyond year 4 is expected to grow at 5% per year, the continu-
ation value in year 4 of the free cash flow in year 5 and beyond can be calculated as a constant 
growth perpetuity:
 Continuation Value in Year 4 = PV (FCF in Year 5 and Beyond)
 =
FCF4 * (1 + g )
r - g
= $1.30 million *
1.05
0.10 - 0.05
 = $1.30 million * 21 = $27.3 million
Notice that under the assumption of constant growth, we can compute the continuation value as 
a multiple of the project’s final free cash flow.
We can restate the free cash flows of the investment as follows (in thousands of dollars):
The NPV of the investment in the new stores is
NPV = -10,500 - 5500
1.10 + 800
1.102 + 1200
1.103 + 28,600
1.104 = $5597
or $5.597 million.

Tax Carryforwards.  A firm generally identifies its marginal tax rate by determining the 
tax bracket that it falls into based on its overall level of pretax income. Two additional fea-
tures of the tax code, called tax loss carryforwards and carrybacks, allow corporations to 
take losses during a current year and offset them against gains in nearby years. Since 1997, 
companies can “carry back” losses for two years and “carry forward” losses for 20 years. 
This tax rule means that the firm can offset losses during one year against income for 
the last two years, or save the losses to be offset against income during the next 20 years. 
When a firm can carry back losses, it receives a refund for back taxes in the current year. 
Otherwise, the firm must carry forward the loss and use it to offset future taxable income. 
When a firm has tax loss carryforwards well in excess of its current pretax income, then 
additional income it earns today will not increase the taxes it owes until after it exhausts its 
­carryforwards. This delay reduces the present value of the tax liability.
Example 8.8
Tax Loss Carryforwards
Problem
Verian Industries has outstanding tax loss carryforwards of $100 million from losses over the 
past six years. If Verian earns $30 million per year in pretax income from now on, when will it 
first pay taxes? If Verian earns an extra $5 million this coming year, in which year will its taxes 
increase?
Solution
With pretax income of $30 million per year, Verian will be able to use its tax loss carryforwards 
to avoid paying taxes until year 4 (in millions of dollars):
If  Verian earns an additional $5 million the first year, it will owe taxes on an extra $5 million 
in year 4:
Thus, when a firm has tax loss carryforwards, the tax impact of current earnings will be 
delayed until the carryforwards are exhausted. This delay reduces the present value of the tax 
impact, and firms sometimes approximate the effect of tax loss carryforwards by using a lower 
marginal tax rate.

8.5	 Analyzing the Project
When evaluating a capital budgeting project, financial managers should make the decision 
that maximizes NPV. As we have discussed, to compute the NPV for a project, you need 
to estimate the incremental cash flows and choose a discount rate. Given these inputs, the 
NPV calculation is relatively straightforward. The most difficult part of capital budgeting 
is deciding how to estimate the cash flows and cost of capital. These estimates are often 
subject to significant uncertainty. In this section, we look at methods that assess the impor-
tance of this uncertainty and identify the drivers of value in the project.
Break-Even Analysis
When we are uncertain regarding the input to a capital budgeting decision, it is often useful 
to determine the break-even level of that input, which is the level for which the investment 
has an NPV of zero. One example of a break-even level that we have already considered is 
the calculation of the internal rate of return (IRR). Recall from Chapter 7 that the IRR of a 
project tells you the maximal error in the cost of capital before the optimal investment deci-
sion would change. Using the Excel function IRR, the spreadsheet in Table 8.7 calculates 
an IRR of 24.1% for the free cash flow of the HomeNet project.13 Hence, the true cost of 
capital can be as high as 24.1% and the project will still have a positive NPV.
13The format in Excel is = IRR(FCF0:FCF5).
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
businesses to immediately deduct the full purchase price 
of capital equipment rather than depreciate it over time. 
­Congress doubled the limit for this deduction to a maximum 
of $250,000 in 2008, and this higher limit was extended by 
the Act through 2009. Again, being able to receive the tax 
deductions for such expenses immediately increases their 
present value and makes investment more attractive.
Extended Loss Carrybacks for Small Businesses. Under 
the Act, small businesses could carry back losses incurred 
in 2008 for up to five years, rather than two years. While 
this extension did not directly affect the NPV of new invest-
ments, it meant struggling businesses were more likely to 
receive refunds of taxes already paid, providing much-
needed cash in the midst of the financial crisis.
On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed into law 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Act, 
like the earlier Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, included 
a number of tax changes designed to help businesses and 
stimulate investment:
Bonus Depreciation. The Act extended a temporary rule 
(first passed as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008) 
allowing additional first-year depreciation of 50% of the 
cost of the asset. By further accelerating the depreciation 
allowance, this measure increases the present value of the 
depreciation tax shields associated with new capital expendi-
tures, raising the NPV of such investment.
Increased Section 179 Expensing of Capital Expenditures.

NPV ($000s) and IRR

There is no reason to limit our attention to the uncertainty in the cost of capital estimate. 
In a break-even analysis, for each parameter, we calculate the value at which the NPV of 
the project is zero.14 Table 8.8 shows the break-even level for several key parameters. For 
example, based on the initial assumptions, the HomeNet project will break even with a 
sales level of just under 80,000 units per year. Alternatively, at a sales level of 100,000 units 
per year, the project will break even with a sales price of $232 per unit.
We have examined the break-even levels in terms of the project’s NPV, which is the 
most useful perspective for decision making. Other accounting notions of break-even are 
sometimes considered, however. For example, we could compute the EBIT break-even 
for sales, which is the level of sales for which the project’s EBIT is zero. While HomeNet’s 
EBIT break-even level of sales is only about 32,000 units per year, given the large upfront 
investment required in HomeNet, its NPV is -$11.8 million at that sales level.
Sensitivity Analysis
Another important capital budgeting tool is sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis breaks 
the NPV calculation into its component assumptions and shows how the NPV varies as 
the underlying assumptions change. In this way, sensitivity analysis allows us to explore the 
effects of errors in our NPV estimates for the project. By conducting a sensitivity analysis, 
we learn which assumptions are the most important; we can then invest further resources 
and effort to refine these assumptions. Such an analysis also reveals which aspects of the 
project are most critical when we are actually managing the project.
To illustrate, consider the assumptions underlying the calculation of HomeNet’s NPV. 
There is likely to be significant uncertainty surrounding each revenue and cost assumption. 
Table 8.9 shows the base-case assumptions, together with the best and worst cases, for sev-
eral key aspects of the project.
14These break-even levels can be calculated by simple trial and error within Excel, or using the Excel goal 
seek or solver tools.

Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
To determine the importance of this uncertainty, we recalculate the NPV of the 
HomeNet project under the best- and worst-case assumptions for each parameter. For 
example, if the number of units sold is only 70,000 per year, the NPV of the project falls 
to -$2.4 million. We repeat this calculation for each parameter. The result is shown in 
Figure 8.1, which reveals that the most important parameter assumptions are the number 
of units sold and the sale price per unit. These assumptions deserve the greatest scrutiny 
during the estimation process. In addition, as the most important drivers of the project’s 
value, these factors deserve close attention when managing the project.
Example 8.9
Sensitivity to Marketing and Support Costs
Problem
The current forecast for HomeNet’s marketing and support costs is $3 million per year during 
years 1–4. Suppose the marketing and support costs may be as high as $4 million per year. What 
is HomeNet’s NPV in this case?
Solution
We can answer this question by changing the selling, general, and administrative expense to $4 
million in the spreadsheet in Table 8.3 and computing the NPV of the resulting free cash flow. 
We can also calculate the impact of this change as follows: A $1 million increase in marketing 
and support costs will reduce EBIT by $1 million and will, therefore, decrease HomeNet’s free 
cash flow by an after-tax amount of $1 million * (1 - 40%) = $0.6 million per year. The present 
value of this decrease is
PV = -0.6
1.12 + -0.6
1.122 + -0.6
1.123 + -0.6
1.124 = -$1.8 million
HomeNet’s NPV would fall to $5.0 million - $1.8 million = $3.2 million.

QUESTION: When developing a model to 
analyze a new investment, how do you deal 
with the uncertainty surrounding estimates, 
especially for new technologies?
ANSWER: Cisco relies on strong financial 
modeling for the thousands of invest-
ment decisions we make every year. Our 
2500 finance people worldwide work 
with the internal client—the business 
lead—to understand the assumptions 
in the model and to check the model’s 
result against alternative assumptions. 
Evaluating the cash flows for technology 
projects, especially new technology, is 
difficult. When you buy an oil refinery, you can see the 
throughput and the cash flows. Identifying the relevant 
savings from a component technology for a larger router 
or switch product or a strategic move into a new area is 
more complex and intangible. Scenario and sensitivity 
analyses and game theory help us control risk by adjust-
ing our strategy. We also look at the qualitative aspects, 
such as how the strategy fits into the customer sector 
and the directions customers are moving with their tech 
platforms.
QUESTION: How does Cisco adjust for risk?
ANSWER: To stay competitive in the technology space, we 
must be prepared to take some level of risk, even in down 
markets. We apply the same discount rate to all projects 
in a category, based on their market risk (i.e., sensitivity 
to market conditions). We do not adjust the discount rate 
to account for project-specific risks, because our required 
return has not changed and that would distort the true 
value of the company. To assess a project’s unique risks, we 
model the upside or downside of cash flows with scenario 
and sensitivity analysis. We might analyze the sensitivity 
of a project’s NPV to a 1% change in both revenue growth 
and operating costs. Then we run the model with other 
assumptions, developing base, optimistic, and bearish cases. 
We discuss these models with the business lead and rerun 
the models based on their input. This process improves our 
potential outcome and project profitability.
David Holland, Senior Vice President and 
Treasurer of Cisco, is responsible for man-
aging all funding, risk, and capital market 
activities related to the firm’s $50 billion 
balance sheet.
QUESTION: What is the importance of con-
sidering free cash flow, as opposed to just the 
earnings implications of a financial decision?
ANSWER: There is an adage saying, “Cash 
flow is a fact and earnings are an opinion.” 
Earnings use an accounting framework 
and are governed by many rules, making it 
hard to know what earnings tell the inves-
tor. The economics of cash flow are clear: 
We can’t dispute whether cash has come in 
or gone out. Cisco’s investment decisions 
are based primarily on cash flow models 
because they take project risk into account and show the 
impact on value creation for owners of the business.
QUESTION: What key financial metrics does Cisco use to 
make investment decisions?
ANSWER: Cisco focuses primarily on net present value 
(NPV) for investment decisions. Robust NPV analysis 
goes beyond simply accepting projects with positive NPVs 
and rejecting those with negative NPVs. It identifies the 
key drivers that affect project success and demonstrates the 
interplay between factors that affect cash flow. For example, 
running a model using a lower margin approach shows us 
the impact on revenue growth and on operating cost struc-
tures. We can compare that to a higher margin (premium 
pricing) approach. The business unit manager learns how 
to control aspects of the business model to alleviate risk or 
accelerate the upside potential.
We prefer NPV to internal rate of return (IRR), which 
may return multiple answers or give false signals as to an 
investment’s profitability, depending on the organization 
of cash flows. An attraction of IRR analysis is the ease 
of comparing percentage returns. However, this method 
hides the scope of a project. A project with a 25% return 
may generate $1 million in shareholder value, while 
another with a 13% IRR might produce $1 billion. NPV 
captures the size of the return in dollar terms and shows 
a project’s impact on share price. NPV also creates an 
ownership framework for employees whose compensation

Scenario Analysis
In the analysis thus far, we have considered the consequences of varying only one param-
eter at a time. In reality, certain factors may affect more than one parameter. Scenario 
analysis considers the effect on the NPV of changing multiple project parameters. For 
example, lowering HomeNet’s price may increase the number of units sold. We can use 
scenario analysis to evaluate alternative pricing strategies for the HomeNet product in 
Table 8.10. In this case, the current strategy is optimal. Figure 8.2 shows the combinations 
of price and volume that lead to the same NPV of $5 million for HomeNet as the current 
strategy. Only strategies with price and volume combinations above the line will lead to a 
higher NPV.

Using Excel
Project Analysis 
Using Excel
Here we describe several useful Excel tools that assist with project analysis.
Goal Seek for Break-Even Analysis
Excel’s goal seek function determines the break-even point for key assumptions in our model. 
For example, to determine the break-even level of units for annual sales, use the Goal Seek win-
dow (see the Data  7 What-If Analysis menu, or keyboard shortcut Alt-A-W-G). The set cell is 
the cell in which we calculated NPV (cell D51). To set its value to 0 (break-even), we change the 
average sale price (cell E8). Excel will then use trial and error to find the sale price at which the 
project’s NPV is zero––in this case $231.66.
Data Tables for Sensitivity Analysis
Data tables, which we introduced in the appendix of Chapter 7 to construct the NPV profile, 
allow us to compute the sensitivity of NPV to any other input variable in our financial model. 
Excel can also compute a two-dimensional data table showing the sensitivity of NPV to two 
inputs simultaneously. For example, the data table below shows NPVs for different combina-
tions of the Hardware R&D budget and HomeNet’s manufacturing costs.
To construct this data table, put the values of each input along the sides of the table (shown 
in blue), and a formula for the value we want to compute in the upper left corner (cell D56, 
which in this case is just a link to the cell in which we computed the NPV). Select the entire 
table (D56:H67), bring up the Data Table window (see the Data 7 What-If Analysis menu or 
keyboard shortcut Alt-D-T), and input the locations in our project dashboard (see page 283) of 
the cost assumption (row input cell E9) and hardware budget (column input cell D16). The data 
table shows, for example, that NPV increases if we lower our manufacturing cost to $100 per 
unit by increasing the hardware budget to $7.5 million.
Scenarios in the Project Dashboard
The project dashboard on page 283 only shows our base-case assumptions. We can build multi-
ple scenarios into our project dashboard by adding additional rows with alternative assumptions,

Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting
8.1  Forecasting Earnings
	
n	 Capital budgeting is the process of analyzing investment opportunities and deciding which 
ones to accept. A capital budget is a list of all projects that a company plans to undertake during 
the next period.
	
n	 We use the NPV rule to evaluate capital budgeting decisions, making decisions that maximize 
NPV. When deciding to accept or reject a project, we accept projects with a positive NPV.
	
n	 The incremental earnings of a project comprise the amount by which the project is expected to 
change the firm’s earnings.
	
n	 Incremental earnings should include all incremental revenues and costs associated with the 
project, including project externalities and opportunity costs, but excluding sunk costs and 
interest expenses.
n	 Project externalities are cash flows that occur when a project affects other areas of the com-
pany’s business.
n	 An opportunity cost is the cost of using an existing asset, measured by the value the asset 
would have provided in its best alternative use.
n	 A sunk cost is an unrecoverable cost that has already been incurred.
n	 Interest and other financing-related expenses are excluded to determine the project’s unle-
vered net income.
	
n	 We estimate taxes using the marginal tax rate, based on the net income generated by the rest of 
the firm’s operations, as well as any tax loss carrybacks or carryforwards.
and then using Excel’s index function to select the scenario we would like to use in our analysis. 
For example, rows 5–7 below show alternative annual sales assumptions for HomeNet. We then 
select the scenario to analyze by entering the appropriate number (in this case 1, 2 or 3) in the 
highlighted cell (C4), and use the index function to pull the appropriate data into row 4.
We can then analyze the consequences for each scenario using the one-dimensional data table in 
C70:D73 below, with column input cell C4.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.

	
n	 When evaluating a capital budgeting decision, we first consider the project on its own, separate 
from the decision regarding how to finance the project. Thus, we ignore interest expenses and 
compute the unlevered net income contribution of the project:
	
 Unlevered Net Income = EBIT * (1 - tc)
	
 = (Revenues - Costs - Depreciation) * (1 - tc)	
(8.2)
8.2  Determining Free Cash Flow and NPV
	
n	 We compute free cash flow from incremental earnings by eliminating all non-cash expenses and 
including all capital investment.
n	 Depreciation is not a cash expense, so it is added back.
n	 Actual capital expenditures are deducted.
n	 Increases in net working capital are deducted. Net working capital is defined as
	
Cash + Inventory + Receivables - Payables	
(8.3)
	
n	 The basic calculation for free cash flow is
	
Unlevered Net Income
Free Cash Flow = (Revenues - Costs - Depreciation) * (1 - tc)
	
+ Depreciation - CapEx - NWC	
(8.5)
	
n	 The discount rate for a project is its cost of capital: The expected return of securities with com-
parable risk and horizon.
8.3  Choosing Among Alternatives
	
n	 When choosing between mutual exclusive investment opportunities, pick the opportunity with 
the highest NPV.
	
n	 When choosing between alternatives, we only need to include those components of free cash 
flow that differ among the alternatives.
8.4  Further Adjustments to Free Cash Flow
	
n	 Depreciation expenses affect free cash flow only through the depreciation tax shield. The 
firm should generally use the most accelerated depreciation schedule that is allowable for tax 
purposes.
	
n	 Free cash flow should also include the (after-tax) liquidation or salvage value of any assets that 
are disposed of. It may also include a terminal (continuation) value if the project continues 
beyond the forecast horizon.
	
n	 When an asset is sold, tax is due on the difference between the sale price and the asset’s book 
value net of depreciation.
	
n	 Terminal or continuation values should reflect the present value of the project’s future cash 
flows beyond the forecast horizon.
8.5  Analyzing the Project
	
n	 Break-even analysis computes the level of a parameter that makes the project’s NPV equal zero.
	
n	 Sensitivity analysis breaks the NPV calculation down into its component assumptions, showing 
how the NPV varies as the values of the underlying assumptions change.
	
n	 Scenario analysis considers the effect of changing multiple parameters simultaneously.

Key Terms
For an excellent overview of the history of the concept of present value and its use in capital budget-
ing, see M. Rubinstein, “Great Moments in Financial Economics: I. Present Value,” Journal of Invest-
ment Management (First Quarter 2003).
Irving Fisher was one of the first to apply the Law of One Price to propose that any capital project 
should be evaluated in terms of its present value; see I. Fisher, The Rate of Interest: Its Nature, Deter-
mination and Relation to Economic Phenomena (Macmillan, 1907). I. Fisher, The Theory of Interest: As 
Determined by Impatience to Spend Income and Opportunity to Invest It (Macmillan, 1930); reprinted 
(Augustus M. Kelley, 1955).
The use of this approach for capital budgeting was later popularized in the following book: J. Dean, 
Capital Budgeting (Columbia University Press, 1951).
We will revisit the topics of this chapter in Part 6. Additional readings for more advanced topics will 
be provided there.

Forecasting Earnings
	
1.	 Pisa Pizza, a seller of frozen pizza, is considering introducing a healthier version of its pizza that 
will be low in cholesterol and contain no trans fats. The firm expects that sales of the new pizza 
will be $19 million per year. While many of these sales will be to new customers, Pisa Pizza 
estimates that 30% will come from customers who switch to the new, healthier pizza instead of 
buying the original version.
a.	 Assume customers will spend the same amount on either version. What level of incremental 
sales is associated with introducing the new pizza?
b.	 Suppose that 52% of the customers who will switch from Pisa Pizza’s original pizza to its 
healthier pizza will switch to another brand if Pisa Pizza does not introduce a healthier pizza. 
What level of incremental sales is associated with introducing the new pizza in this case?
	
2.	 Kokomochi is considering the launch of an advertising campaign for its latest dessert product, the 
Mini Mochi Munch. Kokomochi plans to spend $3.76 million on TV, radio, and print advertis-
ing this year for the campaign. The ads are expected to boost sales of the Mini Mochi Munch by 
$9.14 million this year and by $7.14 million next year. In addition, the company expects that 
new consumers who try the Mini Mochi Munch will be more likely to try Kokomochi’s other 
products. As a result, sales of other products are expected to rise by $3.55 million each year.
	
	 Kokomochi’s gross profit margin for the Mini Mochi Munch is 36%, and its gross profit mar-
gin averages 24% for all other products. The company’s marginal corporate tax rate is 38% 
both this year and next year. What are the incremental earnings associated with the advertising 
campaign?

3.	 Home Builder Supply, a retailer in the home improvement industry, currently operates seven 
retail outlets in Georgia and South Carolina. Management is contemplating building an eighth 
retail store across town from its most successful retail outlet. The company already owns the 
land for this store, which currently has an abandoned warehouse located on it. Last month, the 
marketing department spent $12,000 on market research to determine the extent of customer 
demand for the new store. Now Home Builder Supply must decide whether to build and open 
the new store.
	
	 Which of the following should be included as part of the incremental earnings for the proposed 
new retail store?
a.	 The cost of the land where the store will be located.
b.	 The cost of demolishing the abandoned warehouse and clearing the lot.
c.	 The loss of sales in the existing retail outlet, if customers who previously drove across town 
to shop at the existing outlet become customers of the new store instead.
d.	The $12,000 in market research spent to evaluate customer demand.
e.	 Construction costs for the new store.
f.	 The value of the land if sold.
g.	 Interest expense on the debt borrowed to pay the construction costs.
	
4.	 Hyperion, Inc. currently sells its latest high-speed color printer, the Hyper 500, for $349. It 
plans to lower the price to $300 next year. Its cost of goods sold for the Hyper 500 is $192 per 
unit, and this year’s sales are expected to be 26,100 units.
a.	 Suppose that if Hyperion drops the price to $300 immediately, it can increase this year’s 
sales by 30% to 33,930 units. What would be the incremental impact on this year’s EBIT of 
such a price drop?
b.	 Suppose that for each printer sold, Hyperion expects additional sales of $89 per year on ink 
cartridges for the three-year life of the printer, and Hyperion has a gross profit margin of 
65% on ink cartridges. What is the incremental impact on EBIT for the next three years of 
a price drop this year?
	
5.	 After looking at the projections of the HomeNet project, you decide that they are not realistic. 
It is unlikely that sales will be constant over the four-year life of the project. Furthermore, other 
companies am likely to offer competing products, so the assumption that the sales price will 
remain constant is also likely to be optimistic. Finally, as production ramps up, you anticipate 
lower per unit production costs resulting from economies of scale. You therefore decide to redo 
the projections under the following assumptions: Sales of 50,000 units in year 1 increasing by 
51,000 units per year over the life of the project, a year 1 sales price of $260/unit, decreasing by 
11% annually and a year 1 cost of $120/unit decreasing by 21% annually. In addition, new tax 
laws allow you to depreciate the equipment, over three rather than five years using straight-line 
depreciation.
a.	 Keeping the underlying assumptions in Table 8.1 the same, recalculate unlevered net income 
(that is, reproduce Table 8.1 under the new assumptions, and note that we are ignoring can-
nibalization and lost rent).
b.	 Recalculate unlevered net income assuming, in addition, that each year 20% of sales comes 
from customers who would have purchased an existing Cisco router for $100/unit and that 
this router costs $60/unit to manufacture.

of this investment.
	
8.	 Mersey Chemicals manufactures polypropylene that it ships to its customers via tank car. Cur-
rently, it plans to add two additional tank cars to its fleet four years from now. However, a pro-
posed plant expansion will require Mersey’s transport division to add these two additional tank 
cars in two years’ time rather than in four years. The current cost of a tank car is $2.1 ­million, 
and this cost is expected to remain constant. Also, while tank cars will last indefinitely, they 
will be depreciated straight-line over a five-year life for tax purposes. Suppose Mersey’s tax rate 
is 36%. When evaluating the proposed expansion, what incremental free cash flows should be 
included to account for the need to accelerate the purchase of the tank cars?

a.	 What are the incremental earnings for this project for years 1 and 2?
b.	 What are the free cash flows for this project for the first two years?
	
10.	 You are a manager at Percolated Fiber, which is considering expanding its operations in syn-
thetic fiber manufacturing. Your boss comes into your office, drops a consultant’s report on 
your desk, and complains, “We owe these consultants $1.7 million for this report, and I am not 
sure their analysis makes sense. Before we spend the $16 million on new equipment needed for 
this project, look it over and give me your opinion.” You open the report and find the following 
estimates (in millions of dollars):

All of the estimates in the report seem correct. You note that the consultants used straight-
line depreciation for the new equipment that will be purchased today (year 0), which is what 
the accounting department recommended. The report concludes that because the project 
will increase earnings by $3.484 million per year for 10 years, the project is worth $34.84 
million. You think back to your halcyon days in finance class and realize there is more work 
to be done!
First, you note that the consultants have not factored in the fact that the project will require 
$14 million in working capital upfront (year 0), which will be fully recovered in year 10. Next, 
you see they have attributed $2.24 million of general, sales, and administrative expenses to the 
project, but you know that $0.64 million of this amount is overhead that will be incurred even 
if the project is not accepted. Finally, you know that accounting earnings are not the right thing 
to focus on!
a.	 Given the available information, what are the free cash flows in years 0 through 10 that 
should be used to evaluate the proposed project?
b.	 If the cost of capital for this project is 12%, what is your estimate of the value of the new 
project?
	
11.	 Using the assumptions in part (a) of Problem 5 (assuming there is no cannibalization),
a.	 Calculate HomeNet’s net working capital requirements (that is, reproduce Table 8.4 under 
the assumptions in Problem 5(a)).
b.	 Calculate HomeNet’s FCF (that is, reproduce Table 8.3 under the same assumptions as 
in (a)).
Choosing Among Alternatives
	
12.	 A bicycle manufacturer currently produces 298,000 units a year and expects output levels to 
remain steady in the future. It buys chains from an outside supplier at a price of $1.90 a chain. 
The plant manager believes that it would be cheaper to make these chains rather than buy 
them. Direct in-house production costs are estimated to be only $1.50 per chain. The necessary 
machinery would cost $292,000 and would be obsolete after 10 years. This investment could 
be depreciated to zero for tax purposes using a 10-year straight-line depreciation schedule. The 
plant manager estimates that the operation would require $31,000 of inventory and other 
working capital upfront (year 0), but argues that this sum can be ignored since it is recoverable 
at the end of the 10 years. Expected proceeds from scrapping the machinery after 10 years are 
$21,900.
	
	 If the company pays tax at a rate of 35% and the opportunity cost of capital is 15%, what is 
the net present value of the decision to produce the chains in-house instead of purchasing them 
from the supplier?
	
13.	 Consider again the choice between outsourcing and in-house assembly of HomeNet discussed 
in Section 8.3 and analyzed in Table 8.6. Suppose, however, that the upfront cost to set up for 
in-house production is $6 million rather than $5 million, and the cost per unit for in-house 
production is expected to be $92 rather than $95.
a.	 Suppose the outside supplier decides to raise its price above $110/unit. At what cost per 
unit for the outsourced units would Cisco be indifferent between outsourcing and in-house 
assembly?
b.	 Alternatively, suppose the cost for outsourcing remains $110/unit, but expected demand 
increases above 100,000 units per year. At what level of annual sales, in terms of units sold, 
would Cisco be indifferent between these two options?
	
14.	 One year ago, your company purchased a machine used in manufacturing for $90,000. You 
have learned that a new machine is available that offers many advantages; you can purchase 
it for $150,000 today. It will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over 10 years, after which 
it has no salvage value. You expect that the new machine will contribute EBITDA (earn-
ings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of $50,000 per year for the next 
10 years. The current machine is expected to produce EBITDA of $21,000 per year. The 
	
Problems	
301

current machine is being depreciated on a straight-line basis over a useful life of 11 years, 
after which it will have no salvage value, so depreciation expense for the current machine 
is $8,182 per year. All other expenses of the two machines are identical. The market value 
today of the current machine is $50,000. Your company’s tax rate is 38%, and the opportu-
nity cost of capital for this type of equipment is 12%. Is it profitable to replace the year-old 
machine?
	
15.	 Beryl’s Iced Tea currently rents a bottling machine for $55,000 per year, including all mainte-
nance expenses. It is considering purchasing a machine instead, and is comparing two options:
a.	 Purchase the machine it is currently renting for $165,000. This machine will require 
$22,000 per year in ongoing maintenance expenses.
b.	 Purchase a new, more advanced machine for $265,000. This machine will require $17,000 
per year in ongoing maintenance expenses and will lower bottling costs by $14,000 per year. 
Also, $40,000 will be spent upfront in training the new operators of the machine.
	
	 Suppose the appropriate discount rate is 7% per year and the machine is purchased today. 
Maintenance and bottling costs are paid at the end of each year, as is the rental of the machine. 
Assume also that the machines will be depreciated via the straight-line method over seven years 
and that they have a 10-year life with a negligible salvage value. The marginal corporate tax rate 
is 38%. Should Beryl’s Iced Tea continue to rent, purchase its current machine, or purchase the 
advanced machine?
Further Adjustments to Free Cash Flow
	
16.	 Markov Manufacturing recently spent $19 million to purchase some equipment used in the man-
ufacture of disk drives. The firm expects that this equipment will have a useful life of five years, 
and its marginal corporate tax rate is 38%. The company plans to use straight-line depreciation.
a.	 What is the annual depreciation expense associated with this equipment?
b.	 What is the annual depreciation tax shield?
c.	 Rather than straight-line depreciation, suppose Markov will use the MACRS depreciation 
method for five-year property. Calculate the depreciation tax shield each year for this equip-
ment under this accelerated depreciation schedule.
d.	If Markov has a choice between straight-line and MACRS depreciation schedules, and its 
marginal corporate tax rate is expected to remain constant, which should it choose? Why?
e.	 How might your answer to part (d) change if Markov anticipates that its marginal corporate 
tax rate will increase substantially over the next five years?
	
17.	 Your firm is considering a project that would require purchasing $7.2 million worth of new 
equipment. Determine the present value of the depreciation tax shield associated with this 
equipment if the firm’s tax rate is 31%, the appropriate cost of capital is 9%, and the equip-
ment can be depreciated
a.	 Straight-line over a 10-year period, with the first deduction starting in one year.
b.	 Straight-line over a five-year period, with the first deduction starting in one year.
c.	 Using MACRS depreciation with a five-year recovery period and starting immediately.
d.	Fully as an immediate deduction.
	
18.	 Arnold Inc. is considering a proposal to manufacture high-end protein bars used as food supple-
ments by body builders. The project requires use of an existing warehouse, which the firm 
acquired three years ago for $1 million and which it currently rents out for $138,000. Rental 
rates are not expected to change going forward. In addition to using the warehouse, the project 
requires an upfront investment into machines and other equipment of $1.5 million. This invest-
ment can be fully depreciated straight-line over the next 10 years for tax purposes. However, 
Arnold Inc. expects to terminate the project at the end of eight years and to sell the machines 
and equipment for $491,000. Finally, the project requires an initial investment into net working 
capital equal to 10% of predicted first-year sales. Subsequently, net working capital is 10% of

$81 billion in tax loss carryforwards. If Fargo Bank is expected to generate taxable income 
of $9 billion per year in the future, and its tax rate is 30%, what is the present value of these

24.	 Bauer Industries is an automobile manufacturer. Management is currently evaluating a proposal 
to build a plant that will manufacture lightweight trucks. Bauer plans to use a cost of capital of 
12.2% to evaluate this project. Based on extensive research, it has prepared the following incre-
mental free cash flow projections (in millions of dollars):
a.	 For this base-case scenario, what is the NPV of the plant to manufacture lightweight trucks?
b.	 Based on input from the marketing department, Bauer is uncertain about its revenue fore-
cast. In particular, management would like to examine the sensitivity of the NPV to the rev-
enue assumptions. What is the NPV of this project if revenues are 8% higher than forecast? 
What is the NPV if revenues are 8% lower than forecast?
c.	 Rather than assuming that cash flows for this project are constant, management would 
like to explore the sensitivity of its analysis to possible growth in revenues and operating 
expenses. Specifically, management would like to assume that revenues, manufacturing 
expenses, and marketing expenses are as given in the table for year 1 and grow by 3% per 
year every year starting in year 2. Management also plans to assume that the initial capital 
expenditures (and therefore depreciation), additions to working capital, and continuation 
value remain as initially specified in the table. What is the NPV of this project under these 
alternative assumptions? How does the NPV change if the revenues and operating expenses 
grow by 6% per year rather than by 3%?

n	 Operations : The disruption caused by the installation will decrease sales by $5.04 million this 
year. Once the machine is operating next year, the cost of goods for the products produced by 
the XC-750 is expected to be 68% of their sale price. The increased production will require 
additional inventory on hand of $1.05 million to be added in year 0 and depleted in year 10.
n	 Human Resources : The expansion will require additional sales and administrative personnel 
at a cost of $2.05 million per year.
n	 Accounting : The XC-750 will be depreciated via the straight-line method over the 10-year life 
of the machine. The firm expects receivables from the new sales to be 14% of revenues and 
payables to be 9% of the cost of goods sold. Billingham’s marginal corporate tax rate is 35%.
a.	 Determine the incremental earnings from the purchase of the XC-750.
b.	 Determine the free cash flow from the purchase of the XC-750.
c.	 If the appropriate cost of capital for the expansion is 9.7%, compute the NPV of the 
purchase.
d.	 While the expected new sales will be $10 million per year from the expansion, estimates 
range from $8.05 million to $11.95 million. What is the NPV in the worst case? In the 
best case?
e.	 What is the break-even level of new sales from the expansion? What is the break-even 
level for the cost of goods sold? 
f.	 Billingham could instead purchase the XC-900, which offers even greater capacity. The 
cost of the XC-900 is $4.03 million. The extra capacity would not be useful in the first 
two years of operation, but would allow for additional sales in years 3–10. What level of 
additional sales (above the $10 million expected for the XC-750) per year in those years 
would justify purchasing the larger machine?
	
Data Case

Data Case
You have just been hired by Internal Business Machines Corporation (IBM) in their capital budgeting 
division. Your first ­assignment is to determine the free cash flows and NPV of a proposed new type of 
tablet computer similar in size to an iPad but with the operating power of a high-end desktop system.
Development of the new system will initially require an initial capital expenditure equal to 10% 
of IBM’s Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) at the end of fiscal year 2014. The project will 
then require an additional investment equal to 10% of the initial investment after the first year of 
the project, a 5% increase after the second year, and a 1% increase after the third, fourth, and fifth 
years. The product is expected to have a life of five years. First-year revenues for the new product 
are expected to be 3% of IBM’s total revenue for the fiscal year 2014. The new product’s revenues 
are expected to grow at 15% for the second year then 10% for the third and 5% annually for the 
final two years of the expected life of the project. Your job is to determine the rest of the cash flows 
associated with this project. Your boss has indicated that the operating costs and net working capital 
requirements are similar to the rest of the company and that depreciation is straight-line for capital 
budgeting purposes. Since your boss hasn’t been much help (welcome to the “real world”!), here are 
some tips to guide your analysis:
	
1.	 Obtain IBM’s financial statements. (If you really worked for IBM you would already have this 
data, but at least you won’t get fired if your analysis is off target.) Download the annual income 
statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements for the last four fiscal years from Yahoo! 
Finance (finance.yahoo.com). Enter IBM’s ticker symbol and then go to “financials.”
	
2.	 You are now ready to estimate the Free Cash Flow for the new product. Compute the Free Cash 
Flow for each year using Eq. 8.5:
	
	
Unlevered Net Income
Free Cash Flow = (Revenues - Costs - Depreciation) * (1 - tc)
	
+ Depreciation - CapEx - NWC
¸˚˚˚˚˚˚˝˚˚˚˚˚˚˛

Set up the timeline and computation of free cash flow in separate, contiguous columns for each 
year of the project life. Be sure to make outflows negative and inflows positive.
a.	 Assume that the project’s profitability will be similar to IBM’s existing projects in 2014 
and estimate (revenues - costs) each year by using the 2014 EBITDA/Sales profit margin. 
­Calculate EBITDA as EBIT + Depreciation expense from the cash flow statement.
b.	 Determine the annual depreciation by assuming IBM depreciates these assets by the straight-
line method over a 5-year life.
c.	 Determine IBM’s tax rate by using the income tax rate in 2014.
d.	Calculate the net working capital required each year by assuming that the level of NWC 
will be a constant percentage of the project’s sales. Use IBM’s 2014 NWC/Sales to estimate 
the required percentage. (Use only accounts receivable, accounts payable, and inventory to 
­measure working capital. Other components of current assets and liabilities are harder to 
interpret and not necessarily reflective of the project’s required NWC—for example, IBM’s 
cash holdings.)
e.	 To determine the free cash flow, deduct the additional capital investment and the change in 
net working capital each year.
	
3.	 Use Excel to determine the NPV of the project with a 12% cost of capital. Also calculate the IRR 
of the project using Excel’s IRR function.
	
4.	 Perform a sensitivity analysis by varying the project forecasts as follows:
a.	 Suppose first year sales will equal 2%–4% of IBM’s revenues.
b.	 Suppose the cost of capital is 10%–15%.
c.	 Suppose revenue growth is constant after the first year at a rate of 0%–10%.

Chapter 8  Fundamentals of Capital Budgeting

­chapter 8  
appendix
The U.S. tax code allows for accelerated depreciation of most assets. The depreciation 
method that you use for any particular asset is determined by the tax rules in effect at the 
time you place the asset into service. (Congress has changed the depreciation rules many 
times over the years, so many firms that have held property for a long time may have to use 
several depreciation methods simultaneously.)
For most business property placed in service after 1986, the IRS allows firms to depre-
ciate the asset using the MACRS (Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System) method. 
Under this method, you categorize each business asset into a recovery class that determines 
the time period over which you can write off the cost of the asset. The most commonly 
used items are classified as shown below:
n	 3-year property : Tractor units, racehorses over 2 years old, and horses over 12 years old.
n	 5-year property : Automobiles, buses, trucks, computers and peripheral equipment, 
office machinery, and any property used in research and experimentation. Also includes 
breeding and dairy cattle.
n	 7-year property : Office furniture and fixtures, and any property that has not been desig-
nated as belonging to another class.
n	 10-year property : Water transportation equipment, single-purpose agricultural or horti-
cultural structures, and trees or vines bearing fruit or nuts.
n	 15-year property : Depreciable improvements to land such as fences, roads, and bridges.
n	 20-year property : Farm buildings that are not agricultural or horticultural structures.
n	 27.5-year property : Residential rental property.
n	 39-year property : Nonresidential real estate, including home offices. (Note that the 
value of land may not be depreciated.)
Generally speaking, residential and nonresidential real estate is depreciated via the 
straight-line method, but other classes can be depreciated more rapidly in early years. 
Table 8A.1 shows the standard depreciation rates for assets in the other recovery classes; 
refinements of this table can be applied depending on the month that the asset was placed 
into service (consult IRS guidelines). The table indicates the percentage of the asset’s cost 
that may be depreciated each year, with year 1 indicating the year the asset was first put 
into use.
The lower amount in year 1 reflects a “half-year convention” in which the asset is pre-
sumed to be in use (and this depreciated) for half of the first year, no matter when it was 
actually put into use. After year 1, it is assumed that the asset depreciates more rapidly in 
earlier years.

Valuing Stocks
ON JaNUarY 16, 2006, FOOtWear aND appareL MaKer ­Kenneth 
Cole Productions, Inc., announced that its president, Paul Blum, had resigned to pursue 
“other opportunities.” The price of the company’s stock had already dropped more than 
16% over the prior two years, and the firm was in the midst of a major undertaking to 
restructure its brand. News that its president, who had been with the company for more 
than 15 years, was now resigning was taken as a bad sign by many investors. The next day, 
Kenneth Cole’s stock price dropped by more than 6% on the New York Stock Exchange to 
$26.75, with over 300,000 shares traded, more than twice its average daily volume. How 
might an investor decide whether to buy or sell a stock such as Kenneth Cole at this price? 
Why would the stock suddenly be worth 6% less on the announcement of this news? 
What actions can Kenneth Cole’s managers take to increase the stock price?
To answer these questions, we turn to the Law of One Price, which implies that 
the price of a security should equal the present value of the expected cash flows an 
investor will receive from owning it. In this chapter, we apply this idea to stocks. Thus, 
to value a stock, we need to know the expected cash flows an investor will receive and 
the appropriate cost of capital with which to discount those cash flows. Both of these 
quantities can be challenging to estimate, and many of the details needed to do so will 
be developed throughout the remainder of the text. In this chapter, we will begin our 
study of stock valuation by identifying the relevant cash flows and developing the main 
tools that practitioners use to evaluate them.
Our analysis begins with a consideration of the dividends and capital gains 
received by investors who hold the stock for different periods, from which we develop 
the dividend-discount model of stock valuation. Next, we apply Chapter 8’s tools to value 
stocks based on the free cash flows generated by the firm. Having developed these 
stock valuation methods based on discounted cash flows, we then relate them to the

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
	
9.1	 The Dividend-Discount Model
The Law of One Price implies that to value any security, we must determine the expected 
cash flows an investor will receive from owning it. Thus, we begin our analysis of stock 
valuation by considering the cash flows for an investor with a one-year investment horizon. 
We then consider the perspective of investors with longer investment horizons. We show 
that if investors have the same beliefs, their valuation of the stock will not depend on their 
investment horizon. Using this result, we then derive the first method to value a stock: the 
dividend-discount model.
A One-Year Investor
There are two potential sources of cash flows from owning a stock. First, the firm might 
pay out cash to its shareholders in the form of a dividend. Second, the investor might 
generate cash by choosing to sell the shares at some future date. The total amount received 
in dividends and from selling the stock will depend on the investor’s investment horizon. 
Let’s begin by considering the perspective of a one-year investor.
When an investor buys a stock, she will pay the current market price for a share, P0. 
While she continues to hold the stock, she will be entitled to any dividends the stock pays. 
Let Div1 be the total dividends paid per share of the stock during the year. At the end of 
the year, the investor will sell her share at the new market price, P1. Assuming for simplic-
ity that all dividends are paid at the end of the year, we have the following timeline for this 
investment:
Of course, the future dividend payment and stock price in the timeline above are not 
known with certainty; rather, these values are based on the investor’s expectations at the 
time the stock is purchased. Given these expectations, the investor will be willing to buy 
the stock at today’s price as long as the NPV of the transaction is not negative—that is, as 
long as the current price does not exceed the present value of the expected future dividend 
and sale price. Because these cash flows are risky, we cannot compute their present value 
using the risk-free interest rate. Instead, we must discount them based on the equity cost 
of capital, rE, for the stock, which is the expected return of other investments available in 
the market with equivalent risk to the firm’s shares. Doing so leads to the following condi-
tion under which an investor would be willing to buy the stock:
P0 … Div1 + P1
1 + rE
Similarly, for an investor to be willing to sell the stock, she must receive at least as much 
today as the present value she would receive if she waited to sell next year:
P0 Ú Div1 + P1
1 + rE
0

practice of using valuation multiples based on comparable firms. We conclude the chapter by discuss-
ing the role of competition in determining the information contained in stock prices, as well as its 
implications for investors and corporate managers.

Example 9.1
Stock Prices and Returns
Problem
Suppose you expect Walgreen Company (a drugstore chain) to pay dividends of $1.40 per 
share and trade for $80 per share at the end of the year. If investments with equivalent risk to 
­Walgreen’s stock have an expected return of 8.5%, what is the most you would pay today for 
Walgreen’s stock? What dividend yield and capital gain rate would you expect at this price?
Solution
Using Eq. 9.1, we have
P0 = Div1 + P1
1 + rE
= 1.40 + 80.00
1.085
= $75.02
At this price, Walgreen’s dividend yield is Div1/P0 = 1.40/75.02 = 1.87%. The expected capi-
tal gain is $80.00 - $75.02 = $4.98 per share, for a capital gain rate of 4.98/75.02 = 6.63%. 
Therefore, at this price, Walgreen’s expected total return is 1.87% + 6.63% = 8.5%, which is 
equal to its equity cost of capital.
	
9.1  The Dividend-Discount Model	
311
But because for every buyer of the stock there must be a seller, both equations must hold, 
and therefore the stock price should satisfy
	
P0 = Div1 + P1
1 + rE

(9.1)
In other words, as we discovered in Chapter 3, in a competitive market, buying or selling a 
share of stock must be a zero-NPV investment opportunity.
Dividend Yields, Capital Gains, and Total Returns
We can reinterpret Eq. 9.1 if we multiply by (1 + rE), divide by P0, and subtract 1 from 
both sides:
Total Return
	
rE =  Div1 + P1
P0
 - 1 =
Div1
P0
     +    P1 - P0
P0

(9.2)
The first term on the right side of Eq. 9.2 is the stock’s dividend yield, which is the 
expected annual dividend of the stock divided by its current price. The dividend yield is 
the percentage return the investor expects to earn from the dividend paid by the stock. The 
second term on the right side of Eq. 9.2 reflects the capital gain the investor will earn on 
the stock, which is the difference between the expected sale price and purchase price for the 
stock, P1 - P0. We divide the capital gain by the current stock price to express the capital 
gain as a percentage return, called the capital gain rate.
The sum of the dividend yield and the capital gain rate is called the total return of 
the stock. The total return is the expected return that the investor will earn for a one-year 
investment in the stock. Thus, Eq. 9.2 states that the stock’s total return should equal the 
equity cost of capital. In other words, the expected total return of the stock should equal the 
expected return of other investments available in the market with equivalent risk.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
The Mechanics of a Short Sale
If a stock’s expected total return is below that of other invest-
ments with comparable risk, investors who own the stock 
will choose to sell it and invest elsewhere. But what if you 
don’t own the stock—can you profit in this situation?
The answer is yes, by short selling the stock. To short sell 
a stock, you must contact your broker, who will try to borrow 
the stock from someone who currently owns it.* Suppose John 
Doe holds the stock in a brokerage account. Your broker can 
lend you shares from his account so that you can sell them in 
the market at the current stock price. Of course, at some point 
you must close the short sale by buying the shares in the mar-
ket and returning them to Doe’s account. In the meantime, so 
that John Doe is not made worse off by lending his shares to 
you, you must pay him any dividends the stock pays.**
The following table compares the cash flows from buy-
ing with those from short-selling a stock:
*Selling a stock without first locating a share to borrow is known as a naked short sale, and is prohibited by the SEC.
**In practice, John Doe need not know you borrowed his shares. He continues to receive dividends, and if he needs the shares, the broker will replace 
them either by (1) borrowing shares from someone else or (2) forcing the short-seller to close his position and buy the shares in the market.
When you short sell a stock, first you receive the ­current 
share price. Then, while your short position remains open, 
you must pay any dividends made. Finally, you must pay the 
future stock price to close your position. These cash flows 
are exactly the reverse of those from buying a stock.
Because the cash flows are reversed, if you short sell 
a stock, rather than receiving its return, you must pay its 
return to the person you borrowed the stock from. But if 
this return is less than you expect to earn by investing your 
money in an alternative investment with equivalent risk, 
the strategy has a positive NPV and is attractive.† (We will 
discuss such strategies further in Chapter 11.)
In practice, short sales typically reflect a desire of some 
investors to bet against the stock. For example, in July 
2008, Washington Mutual stood on the verge of bank-
ruptcy as a result of its exposure to subprime mortgages. 
Even though its stock price had fallen by more than 90% in 
the prior year, many investors apparently felt the stock was 
still not attractive—the short interest (number of shares 
sold short) in Washington Mutual exceeded 500 million, 
representing more than 50% of Washington Mutual’s out-
standing shares.
†Typically, the broker will charge a fee for finding the shares to borrow, and require the short-seller to deposit collateral guaranteeing the short-seller’s 
ability to buy the stock later. These costs of shorting tend to be small except in unusual circumstances.

The result in Eq. 9.2 is what we should expect: The firm must pay its shareholders a 
return commensurate with the return they can earn elsewhere while taking the same risk. If 
the stock offered a higher return than other securities with the same risk, investors would 
sell those other investments and buy the stock instead. This activity would drive up the 
stock’s current price, lowering its dividend yield and capital gain rate until Eq. 9.2 holds 
true. If the stock offered a lower expected return, investors would sell the stock and drive 
down its current price until Eq. 9.2 was again satisfied.
A Multiyear Investor
Eq. 9.1 depends upon the expected stock price in one year, P1. But suppose we planned to 
hold the stock for two years. Then we would receive dividends in both year 1 and year 2 
before selling the stock, as shown in the following timeline:

(9.3)
Eqs. 9.1 and 9.3 are different: As a two-year investor we care about the dividend and 
stock price in year 2, but these terms do not appear in Eq. 9.1. Does this difference imply 
that a two-year investor will value the stock differently than a one-year investor?
The answer to this question is no. While a one-year investor does not care about the 
dividend and stock price in year 2 directly, she will care about them indirectly because they 
will affect the price for which she can sell the stock at the end of year 1. For example, sup-
pose the investor sells the stock to another one-year investor with the same beliefs. The new 
investor will expect to receive the dividend and stock price at the end of year 2, so he will 
be willing to pay
P1 = Div2 + P2
1 + rE
for the stock. Substituting this expression for P1 into Eq. 9.1, we get the same result as 
shown in Eq. 9.3:

1By using the same equity cost of capital for both periods, we are assuming that the equity cost of capital 
does not depend on the term of the cash flows. Otherwise, we would need to adjust for the term structure 
of the equity cost of capital (as we did with the yield curve for risk-free cash flows in Chapter 5). This step 
would complicate the analysis but would not change the results.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
Thus, the formula for the stock price for a two-year investor is the same as the one for a 
sequence of two one-year investors.
The Dividend-Discount Model Equation
We can continue this process for any number of years by replacing the final stock price 
with the value that the next holder of the stock would be willing to pay. Doing so leads to 
the general dividend-discount model for the stock price, where the horizon N is arbitrary:
Dividend-Discount Model
	
P0 = Div1
1 + rE
+
Div2
(1 + rE)2 + g +
DivN
(1 + rE )N +
PN
(1 + rE )N	
(9.4)
Eq. 9.4 applies to a single N-year investor, who will collect dividends for N years and 
then sell the stock, or to a series of investors who hold the stock for shorter periods and 
then resell it. Note that Eq. 9.4 holds for any horizon N. Thus, all investors (with the same 
beliefs) will attach the same value to the stock, independent of their investment horizons. 
How long they intend to hold the stock and whether they collect their return in the form 
of dividends or capital gains is irrelevant. For the special case in which the firm eventually 
pays dividends and is never acquired, it is possible to hold the shares forever. Consequently, 
we can let N go to infinity in Eq. 9.4 and write it as follows:
	
P0 = Div1
1 + rE
+
Div2
(1 + rE )2 +
Div3
(1 + rE )3 + g = a

That is, the price of the stock is equal to the present value of the expected future dividends it 
will pay.

9.2	 Applying the Dividend-Discount Model
Eq. 9.5 expresses the value of the stock in terms of the expected future dividends the firm 
will pay. Of course, estimating these dividends—especially for the distant future—is dif-
ficult. A common approximation is to assume that in the long run, dividends will grow at a 
constant rate. In this section, we will consider the implications of this assumption for stock 
prices and explore the trade-off between dividends and growth.
Constant Dividend Growth
The simplest forecast for the firm’s future dividends states that they will grow at a constant 
rate, g, forever. That case yields the following timeline for the cash flows for an investor 
who buys the stock today and holds it:
0

Div1(1  g)

Div1(1  g) 2

. . .

Because the expected dividends are a constant growth perpetuity, we can use Eq. 4.11 to 
calculate their present value. We then obtain the following simple formula for the stock 
price:2
Constant Dividend Growth Model
	
P0 = Div1
rE - g 	
(9.6)
According to the constant dividend growth model, the value of the firm depends on the 
dividend level for the coming year, divided by the equity cost of capital adjusted by the 
expected growth rate of dividends.
2As we discussed in Chapter 4, this formula requires that g 6 rE. Otherwise, the present value of the grow-
ing perpetuity is infinite. The implication here is that it is impossible for a stock’s dividends to grow at 
a rate g 7rE forever. If the growth rate exceeds rE, it must be temporary, and the constant growth model 
does not apply.

Example 9.2
Valuing a Firm with Constant Dividend Growth
Problem
Consolidated Edison, Inc. (Con Edison), is a regulated utility company that services the New 
York City area. Suppose Con Edison plans to pay $2.60 per share in dividends in the coming 
year. If its equity cost of capital is 6% and dividends are expected to grow by 2% per year in the 
future, estimate the value of Con Edison’s stock.
Solution
If dividends are expected to grow perpetually at a rate of 1.5% per year, we can use Eq. 9.6 to 
calculate the price of a share of Con Edison stock:
P0 = Div1
rE - g =
$2.60
0.06 - 0.02 = $65
For another interpretation of Eq. 9.6, note that we can rearrange it as follows:
	
rE = Div1
P0
+ g	
(9.7)
Comparing Eq. 9.7 with Eq. 9.2, we see that g equals the expected capital gain rate. 
In other words, with constant expected dividend growth, the expected growth rate of the 
share price matches the growth rate of dividends.
Dividends Versus Investment and Growth
In Eq. 9.6, the firm’s share price increases with the current dividend level, Div1, and the 
expected growth rate, g. To maximize its share price, a firm would like to increase both 
these quantities. Often, however, the firm faces a trade-off: Increasing growth may require 
investment, and money spent on investment cannot be used to pay dividends. We can use 
the constant dividend growth model to gain insight into this trade-off.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
A Simple Model of Growth.  What determines the rate of growth of a firm’s dividends? 
If we define a firm’s dividend payout rate as the fraction of its earnings that the firm 
pays as dividends each year, then we can write the firm’s dividend per share at date t as 
follows:
	
Divt =
Earningst
Shares Outstandingt
* Dividend Payout Ratet

(9.8)
That is, the dividend each year is the firm’s earnings per share (EPS) multiplied by its divi-
dend payout rate. Thus the firm can increase its dividend in three ways:
	
1.	 It can increase its earnings (net income).
	
2.	 It can increase its dividend payout rate.
	
3.	 It can decrease its shares outstanding.
Let’s suppose for now that the firm does not issue new shares (or buy back its existing 
shares), so that the number of shares outstanding is fixed, and explore the potential trade-
off between options 1 and 2.
A firm can do one of two things with its earnings: It can pay them out to investors, 
or it can retain and reinvest them. By investing more today, a firm can increase its future 
earnings and dividends. For simplicity, let’s assume that if no investment is made, the 
firm does not grow, so the current level of earnings generated by the firm remains con-
stant. If all increases in future earnings result exclusively from new investment made with 
retained earnings, then
	
Change in Earnings = New Investment * Return on New Investment
(9.9)
New investment equals earnings multiplied by the firm’s retention rate, the fraction of 
current earnings that the firm retains:
	
New Investment = Earnings * Retention Rate
(9.10)
Substituting Eq. 9.10 into Eq. 9.9 and dividing by earnings gives an expression for the 
growth rate of earnings:
John Burr Williams’ Theory of Investment Value
The first formal derivation of the dividend-discount model 
appeared in the Theory of Investment Value, written by John 
Burr Williams in 1938. The book was an important land-
mark in the history of corporate finance, because Williams 
demonstrated for the first time that corporate finance relied 
on certain principles that could be derived using formal ana-
lytical methods. As Williams wrote in the preface:
The truth is that the mathematical method is a new tool of 
great power whose use promises to lead to notable advances 
in Investment Analysis. Always it has been the rule in the 
history of science that the invention of new tools is the key 
to new discoveries, and we may expect the same rule to hold 
true in this branch of Economics as well.
Williams’s book was not widely appreciated in its day—
indeed, legend has it there was a lively debate at Harvard 
over whether it was acceptable as his Ph.D. dissertation. But 
Williams went on to become a very successful investor, and 
by the time he died in 1989, the importance of the math-
ematical method in corporate finance was indisputable, and 
the discoveries that resulted from this “new” tool had funda-
mentally changed its practice. Today, Williams is regarded 
as the founder of fundamental analysis, and his book pio-
neered the use of pro forma modeling of financial statements 
and cash flows for valuation purposes, as well as many other 
ideas now central to modern finance (see Chapter 14 for 
further contributions).

Earnings Growth Rate =
Change in Earnings
Earnings
= Retention Rate * Return on New Investment
(9.11)
If the firm chooses to keep its dividend payout rate constant, then the growth in dividends 
will equal growth of earnings:
	
g = Retention Rate * Return on New Investment	
(9.12)
This growth rate is sometimes referred to as the firm’s sustainable growth rate, the rate at 
which it can grow using only retained earnings.
Profitable Growth.  Eq. 9.12 shows that a firm can increase its growth rate by retaining 
more of its earnings. However, if the firm retains more earnings, it will be able to pay out 
less of those earnings and, according to Eq. 9.8, will have to reduce its dividend. If a firm 
wants to increase its share price, should it cut its dividend and invest more, or should it 
cut investment and increase its dividend? Not surprisingly, the answer will depend on the 
profitability of the firm’s investments. Let’s consider an example.
	
9.2  Applying the Dividend-Discount Model

Example 9.3
Cutting Dividends for Profitable Growth
Problem
Crane Sporting Goods expects to have earnings per share of $6 in the coming year. Rather than 
reinvest these earnings and grow, the firm plans to pay out all of its earnings as a dividend. With 
these expectations of no growth, Crane’s current share price is $60.
Suppose Crane could cut its dividend payout rate to 75% for the foreseeable future and use 
the retained earnings to open new stores. The return on its investment in these stores is expected 
to be 12%. Assuming its equity cost of capital is unchanged, what effect would this new policy 
have on Crane’s stock price?
Solution
First, let’s estimate Crane’s equity cost of capital. Currently, Crane plans to pay a dividend equal to 
its earnings of $6 per share. Given a share price of $60, Crane’s dividend yield is $6/$60 = 10%. 
With no expected growth (g = 0), we can use Eq. 9.7 to estimate rE:
rE = Div1
P0
+ g = 10% + 0% = 10%
In other words, to justify Crane’s stock price under its current policy, the expected return of 
other stocks in the market with equivalent risk must be 10%.
Next, we consider the consequences of the new policy. If Crane reduces its divi-
dend payout rate to 75%, then from Eq. 9.8 its dividend this coming year will fall to 
Div1 = EPS1 * 75% = $6 * 75% = $4.50. At the same time, because the firm will now retain 
25% of its earnings to invest in new stores, from Eq. 9.12 its growth rate will increase to
g = Retention Rate * Return on New Investment = 25% * 12% = 3%
Assuming Crane can continue to grow at this rate, we can compute its share price under the 
new policy using the constant dividend growth model of Eq. 9.6:
P0 = Div1
rE - g =
$4.50
0.10 - 0.03 = $64.29
Thus, Crane’s share price should rise from $60 to $64.29 if it cuts its dividend to invest in projects 
that offer a return (12%) greater than their cost of capital (which we assume remains 10%). These 
projects are positive NPV, and so by taking them Crane has created value for its shareholders.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
In Example 9.3, cutting the firm’s dividend in favor of growth raised the firm’s stock 
price. But this is not always the case, as the next example demonstrates.
Example 9.4
Unprofitable Growth
Problem
Suppose Crane Sporting Goods decides to cut its dividend payout rate to 75% to invest in new 
stores, as in Example 9.3. But now suppose that the return on these new investments is 8%, 
rather than 12%. Given its expected earnings per share this year of $6 and its equity cost of capi-
tal of 10%, what will happen to Crane’s current share price in this case?
Solution
Just as in Example 9.3, Crane’s dividend will fall to $6 * 75% = $4.50. Its growth rate under 
the new policy, given the lower return on new investment, will now be g = 25% * 8% = 2%. 
The new share price is therefore
P0 = Div1
rE - g =
$4.50
0.10 - 0.02 = $56.25
Thus, even though Crane will grow under the new policy, the new investments have negative 
NPV. Crane’s share price will fall if it cuts its dividend to make new investments with a return of 
only 8% when its investors can earn 10% on other investments with comparable risk.
Comparing Example 9.3 with Example 9.4, we see that the effect of cutting the firm’s 
dividend to grow crucially depends on the return on new investment. In Example 9.3, the 
return on new investment of 12% exceeds the firm’s equity cost of capital of 10%, so the 
investment has a positive NPV. In Example 9.4, the return on new investment is only 8%, 
so the new investment has a negative NPV (even though it will lead to earnings growth). 
Thus, cutting the firm’s dividend to increase investment will raise the stock price if, and only if, 
the new investments have a positive NPV.
Changing Growth Rates
Successful young firms often have very high initial earnings growth rates. During this 
period of high growth, firms often retain 100% of their earnings to exploit profitable 
investment opportunities. As they mature, their growth slows to rates more typical of 
established companies. At that point, their earnings exceed their investment needs and they 
begin to pay dividends.
We cannot use the constant dividend growth model to value the stock of such a firm, 
for several reasons. First, these firms often pay no dividends when they are young. Second, 
their growth rate continues to change over time until they mature. However, we can use 
the general form of the dividend-discount model to value such a firm by applying the 
constant growth model to calculate the future share price of the stock PN once the firm 
matures and its expected growth rate stabilizes:

Specifically, if the firm is expected to grow at a long-term rate g after year N + 1, then from 
the constant dividend growth model:
	
PN = DivN+1
rE - g 	
(9.13)
We can then use this estimate of PN as a terminal (continuation) value in the dividend-
discount model. Combining Eq. 9.4 with Eq. 9.13, we have

Example 9.5
Valuing a Firm with Two Different Growth Rates
Problem
Small Fry, Inc., has just invented a potato chip that looks and tastes like a french fry. Given 
the phenomenal market response to this product, Small Fry is reinvesting all of its earnings to 
expand its operations. Earnings were $2 per share this past year and are expected to grow at a rate 
of 20% per year until the end of year 4. At that point, other companies are likely to bring out 
competing products. Analysts project that at the end of year 4, Small Fry will cut investment and 
begin paying 60% of its earnings as dividends and its growth will slow to a long-run rate of 4%. 
If Small Fry’s equity cost of capital is 8%, what is the value of a share today?
Solution
We can use Small Fry’s projected earnings growth rate and payout rate to forecast its future earn-
ings and dividends as shown in the following spreadsheet:
Starting from $2.00 in year 0, EPS grows by 20% per year until year 4, after which growth slows 
to 4%. Small Fry’s dividend payout rate is zero until year 4, when competition reduces its invest-
ment opportunities and its payout rate rises to 60%. Multiplying EPS by the dividend payout 
ratio, we project Small Fry’s future dividends in line 4.
From year 4 onward, Small Fry’s dividends will grow at the expected long-run rate of 4% per 
year. Thus, we can use the constant dividend growth model to project Small Fry’s share price at 
the end of year 3. Given its equity cost of capital of 8%,
P3 = Div4
rE - g =
$2.49
0.08 - 0.04 = $62.25
We then apply the dividend-discount model (Eq. 9.4) with this terminal value:
P0 = Div1
1 + rE

Div2
(1 + rE )2 +
Div3
(1 + rE )3 +
P3
(1 + rE )3 = $62.25
(1.08)3 = $49.42
As this example illustrates, the dividend-discount model is flexible enough to handle any fore-
casted pattern of dividends.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
Limitations of the Dividend-Discount Model
The dividend-discount model values the stock based on a forecast of the future dividends 
paid to shareholders. But unlike a Treasury bond, whose cash flows are known with virtual 
certainty, a tremendous amount of uncertainty is associated with any forecast of a firm’s 
future dividends.
Let’s consider the example of Kenneth Cole Productions (KCP), mentioned in the 
introduction to this chapter. In early 2006, KCP paid annual dividends of $0.72. With an 
equity cost of capital of 11% and expected dividend growth of 8%, the constant dividend 
growth model implies a share price for KCP of
P0 = Div1
rE - g =
$0.72
0.11 - 0.08 = $24
which is reasonably close to the $26.75 share price the stock had at the time. With a 10% 
dividend growth rate, however, this estimate would rise to $72 per share; with a 5% divi-
dend growth rate, the estimate falls to $12 per share. As we see, even small changes in the 
assumed dividend growth rate can lead to large changes in the estimated stock price.
Furthermore, it is difficult to know which estimate of the dividend growth rate is more 
reasonable. KCP more than doubled its dividend between 2003 and 2005, but earnings 
remained relatively flat during that time. Consequently, this rapid rate of dividend growth 
was not likely to be sustained. Forecasting dividends requires forecasting the firm’s earn-
ings, dividend payout rate, and future share count. But future earnings depend on interest 
expenses (which in turn depend on how much the firm borrows), and the firm’s share 
count and dividend payout rate depend on whether the firm uses a portion of its earnings 
to repurchase shares. Because borrowing and repurchase decisions are at management’s 
discretion, they can be difficult to forecast reliably.3 We look at two alternative methods 
that avoid some of these difficulties in the next section.

9.3	 Total Payout and Free Cash Flow Valuation 
Models
In this section, we outline two alternative approaches to valuing the firm’s shares that 
avoid some of the difficulties of the dividend-discount model. First, we consider the total 
payout model, which allows us to ignore the firm’s choice between dividends and share 
repurchases. Then, we consider the discounted free cash flow model, which focuses on the 
cash flows to all of the firm’s investors, both debt and equity holders, allowing us to avoid 
estimating the impact of the firm’s borrowing decisions on earnings.
Share Repurchases and the Total Payout Model
In our discussion of the dividend-discount model, we implicitly assumed that any cash 
paid out by the firm to shareholders takes the form of a dividend. However, in recent years, 
an increasing number of firms have replaced dividend payouts with share repurchases. In a 
3We discuss management’s decision to borrow funds or repurchase shares in Part 5.

share repurchase, the firm uses excess cash to buy back its own stock. Share repurchases 
have two consequences for the dividend-discount model. First, the more cash the firm uses 
to repurchase shares, the less it has available to pay dividends. Second, by repurchasing 
shares, the firm decreases its share count, which increases its earnings and dividends on a 
per-share basis.
In the dividend-discount model, we valued a share from the perspective of a single 
shareholder, discounting the dividends the shareholder will receive:
	
P0 = PV(Future Dividends per Share)
(9.15)
An alternative method that may be more reliable when a firm repurchases shares is the 
total payout model, which values all of the firm’s equity, rather than a single share. To do 
so, we discount the total payouts that the firm makes to shareholders, which is the total 
amount spent on both dividends and share repurchases.4 Then, we divide by the current 
number of shares outstanding to determine the share price.
Total Payout Model
	
P0 = PV(Future Total Dividends and Repurchases)
Shares Outstanding0

(9.16)
We can apply the same simplifications that we obtained by assuming constant growth in 
Section 9.2 to the total payout method. The only change is that we discount total dividends 
and share repurchases and use the growth rate of total earnings (rather than earnings per share) 
when forecasting the growth of the firm’s total payouts. This method can be more reliable and 
easier to apply when the firm uses share repurchases.
4Think of the total payouts as the amount you would receive if you owned 100% of the firm’s shares: 
You would receive all of the dividends, plus the proceeds from selling shares back to the firm in the share 
repurchase.
	
9.3  Total Payout and Free Cash Flow Valuation Models	
321
Example 9.6
Valuation with Share Repurchases
Problem
Titan Industries has 217 million shares outstanding and expects earnings at the end of this year 
of $860 million. Titan plans to pay out 50% of its earnings in total, paying 30% as a dividend 
and using 20% to repurchase shares. If Titan’s earnings are expected to grow by 7.5% per year 
and these payout rates remain constant, determine Titan’s share price assuming an equity cost of 
capital of 10%.
Solution
Titan will have total payouts this year of 50% * $860 million = $430 million. Based on the 
equity cost of capital of 10% and an expected earnings growth rate of 7.5%, the present value of 
Titan’s future payouts can be computed as a constant growth perpetuity:
PV (Future Total Dividends and Repurchases) = $430 million
0.10 - 0.075 = $17.2 billion
This present value represents the total value of Titan’s equity (i.e., its market capitalization). To 
compute the share price, we divide by the current number of shares outstanding:
P0 =
$17.2 billion
217 million shares = $79.26 per share

322	
Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
Using the total payout method, we did not need to know the firm’s split between dividends 
and share repurchases. To compare this method with the dividend-discount model, note that 
Titan will pay a dividend of 30% * $860 million/(217 million shares) = $1.19 per share, for 
a dividend yield of 1.19/79.26 = 1.50%. From Eq. 9.7, Titan’s expected EPS, dividend, and 
share price growth rate is g = rE - Div1/P0 = 8.50%. These “per share” growth rates exceed the 
7.5% growth rate of total earnings because Titan’s share count will decline over time due to share 
repurchases.5
5The difference in the per share and total earnings growth rate results from Titan’s “repurchase yield” of 
(20% * $860 million/217 million shares)/($79.26/share) = 1%. Indeed, given an expected share price 
of $79.26 * 1.085 = $86.00 next year, Titan will repurchase 20% * $860 million , ($86 per share) = 
2 million shares next year. With the decline in the number of shares from 217 million to 215 million, EPS grows by a 
factor of 1.075 * (217/215) = 1.085 or 8.5%.
The Discounted Free Cash Flow Model
In the total payout model, we first value the firm’s equity, rather than just a single share. 
The discounted free cash flow model goes one step further and begins by determining 
the total value of the firm to all investors—both equity and debt holders. That is, we begin 
by estimating the firm’s enterprise value, which we defined in Chapter 2 as6
	
Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash
(9.17)
The enterprise value is the value of the firm’s underlying business, unencumbered by 
debt and separate from any cash or marketable securities. We can interpret the enterprise 
value as the net cost of acquiring the firm’s equity, taking its cash, paying off all debt, and 
thus owning the unlevered business. The advantage of the discounted free cash flow model 
is that it allows us to value a firm without explicitly forecasting its dividends, share repur-
chases, or its use of debt.
Valuing the Enterprise.  How can we estimate a firm’s enterprise value? To estimate the 
value of the firm’s equity, we computed the present value of the firm’s total payouts to 
equity holders. Likewise, to estimate a firm’s enterprise value, we compute the present 
value of the free cash flow (FCF) that the firm has available to pay all investors, both debt 
and equity holders. We saw how to compute the free cash flow for a project in Chapter 8; 
we now perform the same calculation for the entire firm:
 
Free Cash Flow = EBIT * (1 - tc) + Depreciation
- Capital Expenditures - Increases in Net Working Capital (9.18)
When we are looking at the entire firm, it is natural to define the firm’s net investment as 
its capital expenditures in excess of depreciation:
	
Net Investment = Capital Expenditures - Depreciation
(9.19)
We can loosely interpret net investment as investment intended to support the firm’s 
growth, above and beyond the level needed to maintain the firm’s existing capital. With 
that definition, we can also write the free cash flow formula as
6To be precise, by cash we are referring to the firm’s cash in excess of its working capital needs, which is the 
amount of cash it has invested at a competitive market interest rate.
¸˚˝˚˛
Unlevered Net Income

	
Free Cash Flow = EBIT * (1 - tc) - Net Investment
	
- Increases in Net Working Capital	
(9.20)
Free cash flow measures the cash generated by the firm before any payments to debt or 
equity holders are considered.
Thus, just as we determine the value of a project by calculating the NPV of the project’s 
free cash flow, we estimate a firm’s current enterprise value V0 by computing the present 
value of the firm’s free cash flow:
Discounted Free Cash Flow Model
	
V0 = PV (Future Free Cash Flow of Firm)
(9.21)
Given the enterprise value, we can estimate the share price by using Eq. 9.17 to solve for 
the value of equity and then divide by the total number of shares outstanding:
	
P0 = V0 + Cash0 - Debt0
Shares Outstanding0

(9.22)
Intuitively, the difference between the discounted free cash flow model and the 
­dividend-discount model is that in the dividend-discount model, the firm’s cash and debt 
are included indirectly through the effect of interest income and expenses on earnings. In 
the discounted free cash flow model, we ignore interest income and expenses (free cash 
flow is based on EBIT), but then adjust for cash and debt directly in Eq. 9.22.
Implementing the Model.  A key difference between the discounted free cash flow model 
and the earlier models we have considered is the discount rate. In previous calculations 
we used the firm’s equity cost of capital, rE, because we were discounting the cash flows 
to equity holders. Here we are discounting the free cash flow that will be paid to both 
debt and equity holders. Thus, we should use the firm’s weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC), denoted by rwacc, which is the average cost of capital the firm must pay to all 
of its investors, both debt and equity holders. If the firm has no debt, then rwacc = rE. But 
when a firm has debt, rwacc is an average of the firm’s debt and equity cost of capital. In 
that case, because debt is generally less risky than equity, rwacc is generally less than rE. We 
can also interpret the WACC as reflecting the average risk of all of the firm’s investments. 
We’ll develop methods to calculate the WACC explicitly in Parts 4 and 5.
Given the firm’s weighted average cost of capital, we implement the discounted free cash 
flow model in much the same way as we did the dividend-discount model. That is, we fore-
cast the firm’s free cash flow up to some horizon, together with a terminal (continuation) 
value of the enterprise:
	
V0 =
FCF1
1 + rwacc
+
FCF2
(1 + rwacc)2 + g + FCFN + VN
(1 + rwacc)N
(9.23)
Often, the terminal value is estimated by assuming a constant long-run growth rate 
gFCF for free cash flows beyond year N, so that
	
VN =
FCFN+1
rwacc - gFCF = ¢
1 + gFCF
rwacc - gFCF≤* FCFN
(9.24)
The long-run growth rate gFCF is typically based on the expected long-run growth rate of 
the firm’s revenues.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
Connection to Capital Budgeting.  There is an important connection between the dis-
counted free cash flow model and the NPV rule for capital budgeting that we developed 
in Chapter 8. Because the firm’s free cash flow is equal to the sum of the free cash flows 
from the firm’s current and future investments, we can interpret the firm’s enterprise value 
as the total NPV that the firm will earn from continuing its existing projects and initiat-
ing new ones. Hence, the NPV of any individual project represents its contribution to the 
firm’s enterprise value. To maximize the firm’s share price, we should accept projects that 
have a positive NPV.
Recall also from Chapter 8 that many forecasts and estimates were necessary to estimate the 
free cash flows of a project. The same is true for the firm: We must forecast future sales, oper-
ating expenses, taxes, capital requirements, and other factors. On the one hand, ­estimating 
Example 9.7
Valuing Kenneth Cole Using Free Cash Flow
Problem
Kenneth Cole (KCP) had sales of $518 million in 2005. Suppose you expect its sales to grow at 
a 9% rate in 2006, but that this growth rate will slow by 1% per year to a long-run growth rate 
for the apparel industry of 4% by 2011. Based on KCP’s past profitability and investment needs, 
you expect EBIT to be 9% of sales, increases in net working capital requirements to be 10% of 
any increase in sales, and net investment (capital expenditures in excess of depreciation) to be 8% 
of any increase in sales. If KCP has $100 million in cash, $3 million in debt, 21 million shares 
outstanding, a tax rate of 37%, and a weighted average cost of capital of 11%, what is your esti-
mate of the value of KCP’s stock in early 2006?
Solution
Using Eq. 9.20, we can estimate KCP’s future free cash flow based on the estimates above as 
follows:
Because we expect KCP’s free cash flow to grow at a constant rate after 2011, we can use Eq. 9.24 
to compute a terminal enterprise value:
V2011 = ¢
1 + gFCF
rwacc - gFCF
≤* FCF2011 = ¢
1.04
0.11 - 0.04≤* 37.6 = $558.6 million
From Eq. 9.23, KCP’s current enterprise value is the present value of its free cash flows plus the 
terminal enterprise value:
V0 = 23.6
1.11 + 26.4
1.112 + 29.3
1.113 + 32.2
1.114 + 35.0
1.115 + 37.6 + 558.6
1.116
= $424.8 million
We can now estimate the value of a share of KCP’s stock using Eq. 9.22:
P0 = 424.8 + 100 - 3

= $24.85

free cash flow in this way gives us flexibility to incorporate many specific details about the 
future prospects of the firm. On the other hand, some uncertainty inevitably surrounds each 
assumption. It is therefore important to conduct a sensitivity analysis, as we described in 
Chapter 8, to translate this uncertainty into a range of potential values for the stock.
Example 9.8
Sensitivity Analysis for Stock Valuation
Problem
In Example 9.7, KCP’s revenue growth rate was assumed to be 9% in 2006, slowing to a long-
term growth rate of 4%. How would your estimate of the stock’s value change if you expected 
revenue growth of 4% from 2006 on? How would it change if in addition you expected EBIT to 
be 7% of sales, rather than 9%?
Solution
With 4% revenue growth and a 9% EBIT margin, KCP will have 2006 revenues of 518 * 1.04 
= $538.7 million, and EBIT of 9%(538.7) = $48.5 million. Given the increase in sales of 
538.7 - 518.0 = $20.7 million, we expect net investment of 8%(20.7) = $1.7 million and 
additional net working capital of 10%(20.7) = $2.1 million. Thus, KCP’s expected FCF in 
2006 is
FCF06 = 48.5 (1 - .37) - 1.7 - 2.1 = $26.8 million
Because growth is expected to remain constant at 4%, we can estimate KCP’s enterprise value as 
a growing perpetuity:
V0 = $26.8/(0.11 - 0.04) = $383 million
for an initial share value of P0 = (383 + 100 - 3)/21 = $22.86. Thus, comparing this result 
with that of Example 9.7, we see that a higher initial revenue growth of 9% versus 4% contrib-
utes about $2 to the value of KCP’s stock.
If, in addition, we expect KCP’s EBIT margin to be only 7%, our FCF estimate would decline to
FCF06 = (.07 * 538.7)(1 - .37) - 1.7 - 2.1 = $20.0 million
for an enterprise value of V0 = $20/(0.11 - 0.04) = $286 million and a share value of 
P0 = (286 + 100 - 3)/21 = $18.24. Thus, we can see that maintaining an EBIT margin of 9% 
versus 7% contributes more than $4.50 to KCP’s stock value in this scenario.
Figure 9.1 summarizes the different valuation methods we have discussed thus far. The 
value of the stock is determined by the present value of its future dividends. We can esti-
mate the total market capitalization of the firm’s equity from the present value of the firm’s 
total payouts, which includes dividends and share repurchases. Finally, the present value

9.4	 Valuation Based on Comparable Firms
Thus far, we have valued a firm or its stock by considering the expected future cash flows 
it will provide to its owner. The Law of One Price then tells us that its value is the present 
value of its future cash flows, because the present value is the amount we would need to 
invest elsewhere in the market to replicate the cash flows with the same risk.
Another application of the Law of One Price is the method of comparables. In the 
method of comparables (or “comps”), rather than value the firm’s cash flows directly, we 
estimate the value of the firm based on the value of other, comparable firms or investments 
that we expect will generate very similar cash flows in the future. For example, consider the 
case of a new firm that is identical to an existing publicly traded company. If these firms 
will generate identical cash flows, the Law of One Price implies that we can use the value of 
the existing company to determine the value of the new firm.
Of course, identical companies do not exist. Although they may be similar in many 
respects, even two firms in the same industry selling the same types of products are likely to 
be of a different size or scale. In this section, we consider ways to adjust for scale differences 
to use comparables to value firms with similar business, and then discuss the strengths and 
weaknesses of this approach.
Valuation Multiples
We can adjust for differences in scale between firms by expressing their value in terms of 
a valuation multiple, which is a ratio of the value to some measure of the firm’s scale. As 
an analogy, consider valuing an office building. A natural measure to consider would be 
the price per square foot for other buildings recently sold in the area. Multiplying the size 
of the office building under consideration by the average price per square foot would typi-
cally provide a reasonable estimate of the building’s value. We can apply this same idea to 
stocks, replacing square footage with some more appropriate measure of the firm’s scale.
The Price-Earnings Ratio.  The most common valuation multiple is the price-earnings 
(P/E) ratio, which we introduced in Chapter 2. A firm’s P/E ratio is equal to the share price 
divided by its earnings per share. The intuition behind its use is that when you buy a stock, 
you are in a sense buying the rights to the firm’s future earnings. Because differences in the 
scale of firms’ earnings are likely to persist, you should be willing to pay proportionally more 
for a stock with higher current earnings. Thus, we can estimate the value of a firm’s share 
by multiplying its current earnings per share by the average P/E ratio of comparable firms.
To interpret the P/E multiple, consider the stock price formula we derived in Eq. 9.6 
for the case of constant dividend growth: P0 = Div1/(rE - g). If we divide both sides of this 
equation by EPS1, we have the following formula:
	
Forward P/E =
P0
EPS1
= Div1/EPS1
rE - g
= Dividend Payout Rate
rE - g
	
(9.25)

Eq. 9.25 provides a formula for the firm’s forward P/E, which is the P/E multiple com-
puted based on its forward earnings (expected earnings over the next twelve months). We 
can also compute a firm’s trailing P/E ratio using trailing earnings (earnings over the 
prior 12 months).7 For valuation purposes, the forward P/E is generally preferred, as we are 
most concerned about future earnings.8
Eq. 9.25 implies that if two stocks have the same payout and EPS growth rates, as well 
as equivalent risk (and therefore the same equity cost of capital), then they should have the 
same P/E. It also shows that firms and industries with high growth rates, and that generate 
cash well in excess of their investment needs so that they can maintain high payout rates, 
should have high P/E multiples.
7Assuming EPS grows at rate g0 between date 0 and 1,
Trailing P/E = P0/EPS0 = (1 + g0) P0/EPS1 = (1 + g0) (Forward P/E)
so trailing multiples tend to be higher for growing firms. Thus, when comparing multiples, be sure to be 
consistent in the use of either trailing or forward multiples across firms.
8Because we are interested in the persistent components of the firm’s earnings, it is also common prac-
tice to exclude extraordinary items that will not be repeated when calculating a P/E ratio for valuation 
purposes.
	
9.4  Valuation Based on Comparable Firms	
327
Example 9.9
Valuation Using the Price-Earnings Ratio
Problem
Suppose furniture manufacturer Herman Miller, Inc., has earnings per share of $1.38. If the 
average P/E of comparable furniture stocks is 21.3, estimate a value for Herman Miller using the 
P/E as a valuation multiple. What are the assumptions underlying this estimate?
Solution
We estimate a share price for Herman Miller by multiplying its EPS by the P/E of comparable 
firms. Thus, P0 = $1.38 * 21.3 = $29.39. This estimate assumes that Herman Miller will have 
similar future risk, payout rates, and growth rates to comparable firms in the industry.
Enterprise Value Multiples.  It is also common practice to use valuation multiples based 
on the firm’s enterprise value. As we discussed in Section 9.3, because it represents the total 
value of the firm’s underlying business rather than just the value of equity, using the enter-
prise value is advantageous if we want to compare firms with different amounts of leverage.
Because the enterprise value represents the entire value of the firm before the firm pays 
its debt, to form an appropriate multiple, we divide it by a measure of earnings or cash flows 
before interest payments are made. Common multiples to consider are enterprise value to 
EBIT, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), and free 
cash flow. However, because capital expenditures can vary substantially from period to 
period (e.g., a firm may need to add capacity and build a new plant one year, but then 
not need to expand further for many years), most practitioners rely on enterprise value 
to EBITDA multiples. From Eq. 9.24, if expected free cash flow growth is constant, then
	
V0
EBITDA1
= FCF1>EBITDA1
rwacc - gFCF
	
(9.26)
As with the P/E multiple, this multiple is higher for firms with high growth rates and low 
capital requirements (so that free cash flow is high in proportion to EBITDA).

328	
Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
Other Multiples.  Many other valuation multiples are possible. Looking at enterprise value 
as a multiple of sales can be useful if it is reasonable to assume that the firms will maintain 
similar margins in the future. For firms with substantial tangible assets, the ratio of price 
to book value of equity per share is sometimes used. Some multiples are specific to an 
industry. In the cable TV industry, for example, it is natural to consider enterprise value 
per subscriber.
Limitations of Multiples
If comparable firms were identical, their multiples would match precisely. Of course, firms 
are not identical. Thus, the usefulness of a valuation multiple will depend on the nature of 
the differences between firms and the sensitivity of the multiples to these differences.
Table 9.1 lists several valuation multiples for Kenneth Cole as well as for other firms 
in the footwear industry as of January 2006. Also shown is the average for each multiple, 
together with the range around the average (in percentage terms). Comparing Kenneth 
Cole with the industry averages, KCP looks somewhat overvalued according to its P/E (i.e., 
it trades at a higher P/E multiple), and somewhat undervalued according to the other mul-
tiples shown. For all of the multiples, however, a significant amount of dispersion across 
the industry is apparent. While the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple shows the small-
est variation, even with it we cannot expect to obtain a precise estimate of value.
The differences in these multiples are most likely due to differences in their expected 
future growth rates, profitability, risk (and therefore costs of capital), and, in the case of 
Puma, differences in accounting conventions between the United States and Germany. 
Investors in the market understand that these differences exist, so the stocks are priced 
accordingly. But when valuing a firm using multiples, there is no clear guidance about how 
to adjust for these differences other than by narrowing the set of comparables used.
Thus, a key shortcoming of the comparables approach is that it does not take into 
account the important differences among firms. One firm might have an exceptional 
management team, another might have developed an efficient manufacturing process, or 
secured a patent on a new technology. Such differences are ignored when we apply a valu-
ation multiple.
Example 9.10 
Valuation Using an Enterprise Value Multiple
Problem
Suppose Rocky Shoes and Boots (RCKY) has earnings per share of $2.30 and EBITDA of $30.7 
million. RCKY also has 5.4 million shares outstanding and debt of $125 million (net of cash). 
You believe Deckers Outdoor Corporation is comparable to RCKY in terms of its underlying 
business, but Deckers has little debt. If Deckers has a P/E of 13.3 and an enterprise value to 
EBITDA multiple of 7.4, estimate the value of RCKY’s shares using both multiples. Which 
estimate is likely to be more accurate?
Solution
Using Decker’s P/E, we would estimate a share price for RCKY of P0 = $2.30 * 13.3 = $30.59. 
Using the enterprise value to EBITDA multiple, we would estimate RCKY’s enterprise value to 
be V0 = $30.7 million * 7.4 = $227.2 million. We then subtract debt and divide by the num-
ber of shares to estimate RCKY’s share price: P0 = (227.2 - 125)/5.4 = $18.93. Because of the 
large difference in leverage between the firms, we would expect the second estimate, which is 
based on enterprise value, to be more reliable.

Another limitation of comparables is that they only provide information regarding the 
value of the firm relative to the other firms in the comparison set. Using multiples will 
not help us determine if an entire industry is overvalued, for example. This issue became 
especially important during the Internet boom of the late 1990s. Because many of these 
firms did not have positive cash flows or earnings, new multiples were created to value 
them (e.g., price to “page views”). While these multiples could justify the value of these 
firms in relation to one another, it was much more difficult to justify the stock prices of 
many of these firms using a realistic estimate of cash flows and the discounted free cash 
flow approach.
Comparison with Discounted Cash Flow Methods
Using a valuation multiple based on comparables is best viewed as a “shortcut” to the 
discounted cash flow methods of valuation. Rather than separately estimate the firm’s cost 
of capital and future earnings or free cash flows, we rely on the market’s assessment of the 
value of other firms with similar future prospects. In addition to its simplicity, the mul-
tiples approach has the advantage of being based on actual prices of real firms, rather than 
what may be unrealistic forecasts of future cash flows.
On the other hand, discounted cash flow (DCF) methods have the advantage that they 
allow us to incorporate specific information about the firm’s profitability, cost of capital, or 
future growth potential, as well as perform sensitivity analysis. Because the true driver of 
value for any firm is its ability to generate cash flows for its investors, the discounted cash 
flow methods have the potential to be more accurate and insightful than the use of a valu-
ation multiple. In particular, DCF methods make explicit the future performance the firm 
must achieve in order to justify its current value.

Stock Valuation Techniques: The Final Word
In the end, no single technique provides a final answer regarding a stock’s true value. All 
approaches require assumptions or forecasts that are too uncertain to provide a definitive 
assessment of the firm’s value. Most real-world practitioners use a combination of these 
approaches and gain confidence if the results are consistent across a variety of methods.
Figure 9.2 compares the ranges of values for Kenneth Cole Productions using the differ-
ent valuation methods that we have discussed in this chapter.9 Kenneth Cole’s stock price 
of $26.75 in January 2006 is within the range estimated by all of these methods. Hence, 
based on this evidence alone we would not conclude that the stock is obviously under- or 
overpriced.
9A chart such as this one, showing the range of values produced by each valuation method, is often 
referred to as a valuation “football field chart” by practitioners.

Concept Check	
1.	 What are some common valuation multiples?
	
2.	 What implicit assumptions are made when valuing a firm using multiples based on comparable 
firms?

ANSWER: We use 5-year DCFs, 
because it takes that long to get to a 
steady state and predicting beyond 
that is difficult. The hardest part 
is determining the income state-
ment inputs. The fifth-year numbers 
dominate value. Getting to that point 
depends on how fast you grow the 
business and how profitable it is. 
Assumptions are the key. We take 
a conservative approach, leveraging 
available information. Overly aggres-
sive sponsor assumptions lead to 
extreme valuations, creating an acquir-
er’s biggest problems.
The hurdle rate for a project var-
ies. We might use cost of equity or the 
WACC. Then we ask, “What is right 
risk/return profile for this transac-
tion?” and adjust the rate accordingly—for example, pos-
sibly requiring a higher return for a smaller, more volatile 
company.
Oracle’s 80 completed transactions give us actual experi-
ence on which to base more realistic assumptions. We look 
at variables and attributes—was it a product line, a specific 
feature, a stand-alone acquisition?—and assess how well we 
did based on our models, to improve our cash flow analysis 
for future acquisitions. Then we benchmark using common 
valuation multiples based on comparable publicly traded 
companies and similar M&A transactions.
QUESTION: How does your analysis differ for private versus 
public companies?
ANSWER: The basic DCF analysis is no different: We per-
form the same due diligence for private and public compa-
nies and receive the same types of information. Typically, 
the larger the public company’s revenues, the more stable 
it is and the more professional its orientation and systems. 
We feel more confident in our risk attributes and the 
information we receive. In acquiring a public company, we 
prepare a pro forma statement for the combined entity to 
determine whether it will increase or decrease our earnings 
per share.
Of greater concern to us is the target’s size. A $2 billion 
company, whether public or private, has multiple product 
lines and larger installed bases, reducing its risk profile. A 
$100 million company may have only one product line 
and thus, higher risk and volatility. On the other hand, the 
small company may grow faster than a large one.
Since 2005, Douglas Kehring has 
been Senior Vice President of Oracle 
Corporation’s Corporate Development 
and Strategic Planning group, provid-
ing planning, advisory, execution, and 
integration management services to 
Oracle on mergers and acquisitions and 
related transactions.
QUESTION: How does Oracle target 
companies to acquire?
ANSWER: Oracle uses an ongoing 
strategic planning process to identify 
potential acquisition targets. Top-
down, the corporate development 
group works with the CEO’s office 
looking for large, game-changing 
acquisitions. We also work bottom-up 
with engineering executives who sponsor potential acquisi-
tions to fill customer needs and product gaps. Together 
we identify prospects, engage with targets, perform due 
diligence, develop business plans, and proceed with feasible 
transactions. Our group also provides the CEO’s office with 
objective opinions of sponsor proposals, based on Oracle’s 
overall needs and priorities. The CEO’s office approves all 
transactions.
We see about 300 to 400 opportunities a year and show 
all to the appropriate product group executives, including 
those from venture capital firms and investment bankers. 
Typically, they express an interest in about 20 to 40, and we 
sign confidentiality agreements to proceed with a thorough 
analysis. About 12 of those reach the letter of intent stage, 
where we issue a term sheet and an exclusivity period to 
complete the transaction.
QUESTION: Once you decide to try to acquire a company, how 
do you determine how much to pay for it?
ANSWER: The pricing occurs after due diligence but before 
the letter of intent. From a practical standpoint, we nego-
tiate the price point with the seller—that’s where the art 
comes into play. Our DCF analysis is the most important 
part in justifying the value. We take into account what we 
believe we can do with the business from an income state-
ment perspective, to determine the breakeven valuation at

9.5	 Information, Competition, and Stock Prices
As shown in Figure 9.3, the models described in this chapter link the firm’s expected future 
cash flows, its cost of capital (determined by its risk), and the value of its shares. But what 
conclusions should we draw if the actual market price of a stock doesn’t appear to be con-
sistent with our estimate of its value? Is it more likely that the stock is mispriced or that 
we made a mistake in our risk and future cash flow estimates? We close this chapter with a 
consideration of this question and the implications for corporate managers.
Information in Stock Prices
Consider the following situation. You are a new junior analyst assigned to research ­Kenneth 
Cole Productions’ stock and assess its value. You scrutinize the company’s recent financial 
statements, look at the trends in the industry, and forecast the firm’s future earnings, divi-
dends, and free cash flows. You carefully run the numbers and estimate the stock’s value at 
$30 per share. On your way to present your analysis to your boss, you run into a slightly 
more experienced colleague in the elevator. It turns out your colleague has been research-
ing the same stock and has different beliefs. According to her analysis, the value of the 
stock is only $20 per share. What would you do?
Most of us in this situation would reconsider our own analysis. The fact that someone 
else who has carefully studied the stock has come to a very different conclusion is power-
ful evidence that we might have missed something. In the face of this information from 
our colleague, we would probably reconsider our analysis and adjust our assessment of 
the stock’s value downward. Of course, our colleague might also revise her opinion based 
on our assessment. After sharing our analyses, we would likely end up with a consensus 
estimate somewhere between $20 and $30 per share. That is, at the end of this process our 
beliefs would be similar.
This type of encounter happens millions of times every day in the stock market. When 
a buyer seeks to buy a stock, the willingness of other parties to sell the same stock suggests 
that they value the stock differently, as the NPV of buying and selling the stock cannot both 
be positive. Thus, the information that others are willing to trade should lead buyers and 
sellers to revise their valuations. Ultimately, investors trade until they reach a consensus 
regarding the value of the stock. In this way, stock markets aggregate the information and 
views of many different investors.
Figure 9.3 
Valuation models determine the relationship among the firm’s future cash flows, its cost of capi-
tal, and the value of its shares. The stock’s expected cash flows and cost of capital can be used 
to assess its market price. Conversely, the market price can be used to assess the firm’s future 
cash flows or cost of capital.
The Valuation Triad
Share
Value
Future
Cash Flows

Cost of Capital

Thus, if your valuation model suggests a stock is worth $30 per share when it is trading 
for $20 per share in the market, the discrepancy is equivalent to knowing that thousands of 
investors—many of them professionals who have access to the best information—disagree 
with your assessment. This knowledge should make you reconsider your original analysis. 
You would need a very compelling reason to trust your own estimate in the face of such 
contrary opinions.
What conclusion can we draw from this discussion? Recall Figure 9.3, in which a valua-
tion model links the firm’s future cash flows, its cost of capital, and its share price. In other 
words, given accurate information about any two of these variables, a valuation model 
allows us to make inferences about the third variable. Thus, the way we use a valuation 
model will depend on the quality of our information: The model will tell us the most about 
the variable for which our prior information is the least reliable.
For a publicly traded firm, its market price should already provide very accurate informa-
tion, aggregated from a multitude of investors, regarding the true value of its shares. There-
fore, in most situations, a valuation model is best applied to tell us something about the firm’s 
future cash flows or cost of capital, based on its current stock price. Only in the relatively 
rare case in which we have some superior information that other investors lack regarding the 
firm’s cash flows and cost of capital would it make sense to second-guess the stock price.

Example 9.11 
Using the Information in Market Prices
Problem
Suppose Tecnor Industries will pay a dividend this year of $5 per share. Its equity cost of capital 
is 10%, and you expect its dividends to grow at a rate of about 4% per year, though you are 
somewhat unsure of the precise growth rate. If Tecnor’s stock is currently trading for $76.92 per 
share, how would you update your beliefs about its dividend growth rate?
Solution
If we apply the constant dividend growth model based on a 4% growth rate, we would ­estimate 
a stock price of P0 = 5/(0.10 - 0.04) = $83.33 per share. The market price of $76.92, ­however, 
implies that most investors expect dividends to grow at a somewhat slower rate. If we continue 
to assume a constant growth rate, we can solve for the growth rate consistent with the current 
market price using Eq. 9.7:
g = rE - Div1/P0 = 10% - 5/76.92 = 3.5%
Thus, given this market price for the stock, we should lower our expectations for the dividend 
growth rate unless we have very strong reasons to trust our own estimate.
Competition and Efficient Markets
The idea that markets aggregate the information of many investors, and that this infor-
mation is reflected in security prices, is a natural consequence of investor competition. If 
information were available that indicated that buying a stock had a positive NPV, investors 
with that information would choose to buy the stock; their attempts to purchase it would 
then drive up the stock’s price. By a similar logic, investors with information that selling a 
stock had a positive NPV would sell it and the stock’s price would fall.
The idea that competition among investors works to eliminate all positive-NPV trading 
opportunities is referred to as the efficient markets hypothesis. It implies that securities 
will be fairly priced, based on their future cash flows, given all information that is available 
to investors.

334	
Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
The underlying rationale for the efficient markets hypothesis is the presence of 
­competition. What if new information becomes available that affects the firm’s value? 
The degree of competition, and therefore the accuracy of the efficient markets hypothesis, 
will depend on the number of investors who possess this information. Let’s consider two 
important cases.
Public, Easily Interpretable Information.  Information that is available to all investors 
includes information in news reports, financial statements, corporate press releases, or in 
other public data sources. If the impact of this information on the firm’s future cash flows 
can be readily ascertained, then all investors can determine the effect of this information 
on the firm’s value.
In this situation, we expect competition between investors to be fierce and the stock 
price to react nearly instantaneously to such news. A few lucky investors might be able to 
trade a small quantity of shares before the price fully adjusts. But most investors would find 
that the stock price already reflected the new information before they were able to trade on 
it. In other words, we expect the efficient markets hypothesis to hold very well with respect 
to this type of information.
Example 9.12
Stock Price Reactions to Public Information
Problem
Myox Labs announces that due to potential side effects, it is pulling one of its leading drugs from 
the market. As a result, its future expected free cash flow will decline by $85 million per year for 
the next 10 years. Myox has 50 million shares outstanding, no debt, and an equity cost of capital 
of 8%. If this news came as a complete surprise to investors, what should happen to Myox’s stock 
price upon the announcement?
Solution
In this case, we can use the discounted free cash flow method. With no debt, rwacc = rE = 8%. 
Using the annuity formula, the decline in expected free cash flow will reduce Myox’s enterprise 
value by
$85 million *
1
0.08
 ¢1 -
1
1.0810 ≤= $570 million
Thus, the share price should fall by $570/50 = $11.40 per share. Because this news is public and 
its effect on the firm’s expected free cash flow is clear, we would expect the stock price to drop by 
this amount nearly instantaneously.
Private or Difficult-to-Interpret Information.  Some information is not publicly avail­
able. For example, an analyst might spend time and effort gathering information from a 
firm’s employees, competitors, suppliers, or customers that is relevant to the firm’s future 
cash flows. This information is not available to other investors who have not devoted a sim­
ilar effort to gathering it.
Even when information is publicly available, it may be difficult to interpret. Non-
experts in the field may find it difficult to evaluate research reports on new technolo-
gies, for example. It may take a great deal of legal and accounting expertise and effort to 
understand the full consequences of a highly complicated business transaction. Certain 
consulting experts may have greater insight into consumer tastes and the likelihood of a 
product’s acceptance. In these cases, while the fundamental information may be public, 

the interpretation of how that information will affect the firm’s future cash flows is itself 
private information.
When private information is relegated to the hands of a relatively small number of 
investors, these investors may be able to profit by trading on their information.10 In this 
case, the efficient markets hypothesis will not hold in the strict sense. However, as these 
informed traders begin to trade, they will tend to move prices, so over time prices will 
begin to reflect their information as well.
If the profit opportunities from having this type of information are large, other indi-
viduals will attempt to gain the expertise and devote the resources needed to acquire it. As 
more individuals become better informed, competition to exploit this information will 
increase. Thus, in the long run, we should expect that the degree of “inefficiency” in the 
market will be limited by the costs of obtaining the information.
10Even with private information, informed investors may find it difficult to profit from that information, 
because they must find others who are willing to trade with them; that is, the market for the stock must 
be sufficiently liquid. A liquid market requires that other investors in the market have alternative motives 
to trade (e.g., selling shares of a stock to purchase a house) and so be willing to trade even when facing the 
risk that other traders may be better informed. See Chapter 13 for more details.

Example 9.13 
Stock Price Reactions to Private Information
Problem
Phenyx Pharmaceuticals has just announced the development of a new drug for which the com-
pany is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If approved, the 
future profits from the new drug will increase Phenyx’s market value by $750 million, or $15 per 
share given its 50 million shares outstanding. If the development of this drug was a surprise to 
investors, and if the average likelihood of FDA approval is 10%, what do you expect will hap-
pen to Phenyx’s stock price when this news is announced? What may happen to the stock price 
over time?
Solution
Because many investors are likely to know that the chance of FDA approval is 10%, competition 
should lead to an immediate jump in the stock price of 10% * $15 = $1.50 per share. Over 
time, however, analysts and experts in the field are likely to do their own assessments of the 
probable efficacy of the drug. If they conclude that the drug looks more promising than average, 
they will begin to trade on their private information and buy the stock, and the price will tend 
to drift higher over time. If the experts conclude that the drug looks less promising than average, 
they will tend to sell the stock, and its price will drift lower over time. Examples of possible price 
paths are shown in Figure 9.4. While these experts may be able to trade on their superior infor-
mation and earn a profit, for uninformed investors who do not know which outcome will occur, 
the stock may rise or fall and so appears fairly priced at the announcement.
Lessons for Investors and Corporate Managers
The effect of competition based on information about stock prices has important conse-
quences for both investors and corporate managers.
Consequences for Investors.  As in other markets, investors should be able to identify 
positive-NPV trading opportunities in securities markets only if some barrier or restriction 
to free competition exists. An investor’s competitive advantage may take several forms. 

336	
Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
The investor may have expertise or access to information that is known to only a few 
­people. Alternatively, the investor may have lower trading costs than other market partici-
pants and so can exploit opportunities that others would find unprofitable. In all cases, 
however, the source of the positive-NPV trading opportunity must be something that is 
hard to replicate; otherwise, any gains would be competed away.
While the fact that positive-NPV trading opportunities are hard to come by may be 
disappointing, there is some good news as well. If stocks are fairly priced according to our 
valuation models, then investors who buy stocks can expect to receive future cash flows 
that fairly compensate them for the risk of their investment. Thus, in such cases the average 
investor can invest with confidence, even if he is not fully informed.
Implications for Corporate Managers.  If stocks are fairly valued according to the 
models we have described, then the value of the firm is determined by the cash flows 
that it can pay to its investors. This result has several key implications for corporate 
managers:
n	 Focus on NPV and free cash flow.  A manager seeking to boost the price of her firm’s stock 
should make investments that increase the present value of the firm’s free cash flow. 
Thus, the capital budgeting methods outlined in Chapter 8 are fully consistent with the 
objective of maximizing the firm’s share price.
n	 Avoid accounting illusions.  Many managers make the mistake of focusing on accounting 
earnings as opposed to free cash flows. With efficient markets, the accounting conse-
quences of a decision do not directly affect the value of the firm and should not drive 
decision making.
n	 Use financial transactions to support investment.  With efficient markets, the firm can sell 
its shares at a fair price to new investors. Thus, the firm should not be constrained from 
raising capital to fund positive NPV investment opportunities.

Possible Stock Price Paths

Phenyx’s stock price jumps

approval. The stock price then 
drifts up (green path) or down 
(gold path) as informed ­traders 
trade on their more ­accurate 
assessment of the drug’s likeli-
hood of approval. Because an 
uninformed investor does not 
know which outcome will occur, 
the stock is fairly priced at the 
announcement, even though 
it will appear ­under- or over-
priced ex post.

Kenneth Cole Productions—What Happened?
The biggest challenge in valuing a stock is forecasting the 
future. Events will often arise that cause the company’s per-
formance to exceed or fall short of analysts’ expectations. 
Often these events are specific to the company itself. But 
other times the events are beyond the company’s control. 
For example, no one could have predicted the severity of the 
economic collapse that would ensue in 2008–2009, and the 
impact it would have on retailers worldwide. Consider what 
actually happened to Kenneth Cole Productions.
Unanticipated problems within the company meant that 
the remainder of 2006 was challenging for KCP. Despite 
strong revenue growth in its wholesale division, its retail 
stores suffered an unexpected large same-store sales decline 
of 13%. Overall, KCP revenues grew only 3.6% in 2006, 
well below analysts’ forecasts. Losses in the retail division 
caused KCP’s EBIT margin to drop below 7%.
After the departure of its president, KCP also struggled to 
find new leadership. As both Chairman and CEO, founder 
Kenneth Cole was able to spend less time on the creative 
aspects of the brand, and its image suffered. Sales declined 
4.8% in 2007, and its EBIT margin fell to 1%. However there 
was some cause for optimism—in Spring 2008, KCP hired Jill 
Granoff, a former Liz Claiborne executive, as its new CEO.
The optimism was short-lived. Like many other retailers, 
in Fall 2008, KCP was hit hard by the effects of the finan-
cial crisis. It found itself saddled with large ­inventories, and 
had to aggressively cut prices. By year end, sales had fallen 
by 3.6%. Worse, KCP reported operating losses, with an 
EBIT margin of -2%. Analysts forecast that 2009 would be 
KCP’s most difficult year yet, with sales declines exceeding 
8% and EBIT margins falling below -4%.
Reflecting its poor performance, KCP cut its dividend in 
half at the start of 2008 and suspended dividend payments 
altogether at the start of 2009. The chart below shows KCP’s 
stock price performance—clearly, investors in KCP did not 
do well over this period, with the stock losing more than 
70% of its value by early 2009, with more than half of that 
loss occurring in the wake of the financial crisis.
As the economy recovered in 2010, KCP returned to 
profitability, and sales experienced double digit growth. In 
early 2012, the company’s founder, Kenneth Cole, offered 
to buy the firm from its shareholders. The deal closed on 
September 25, 2012 for a price $15.25/share, still well 
under its early 2006 value.
It is important to recognize, however, that while we know 
now that KCP was overpriced in 2006, that does not mean 
that the market for KCP stock was “inefficient” at that time. 
Indeed, as we saw earlier, KCP may have been appropriately 
priced based on reasonable expectations for its future growth 
that investors had at the time. Unfortunately, due to prob-
lems both within KCP and with the broader economy, those 
expectations were not realized.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
The Efficient Markets Hypothesis Versus No Arbitrage
We can draw an important distinction between the efficient markets hypothesis and the 
notion of a normal market that we introduced in Chapter 3, which is based on the idea 
of arbitrage. An arbitrage opportunity is a situation in which two securities (or portfolios) 
with identical cash flows have different prices. Because anyone can earn a sure profit in this 
situation by buying the low-priced security and selling the high-priced one, we expect that 
investors will immediately exploit and eliminate these opportunities. Thus, in a normal 
market, arbitrage opportunities will not be found.
The efficient markets hypothesis, that the NPV of investing is zero, is best expressed in 
terms of returns, as in Eq. 9.2. When the NPV of investing is zero, the price of every secu-
rity equals the present value of its expected cash flows when discounted at a cost of capital 
that reflects its risk. So the efficient markets hypothesis implies that securities with equiva-
lent risk should have the same expected return. The efficient markets hypothesis is therefore 
incomplete without a definition of “equivalent risk.” Furthermore, because investors must 
forecast the riskiness of securities, and may do so differently, there is no reason to expect the 
efficient markets hypothesis to hold perfectly; it is best viewed as an idealized approxima-
tion for highly competitive markets.
To test the validity of the efficient markets hypothesis and, more importantly, to imple-
ment the discounted cash flow methods of stock valuation introduced in this chapter, we 
need a theory of how investors can estimate the risk of investing in a security and how this 
risk determines the security’s expected return. Developing such a theory is the topic of 
Part 4, which we turn to next.

2.	 What are the implications of the efficient market hypothesis for corporate ­managers?
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
9.1  The Dividend-Discount Model
	
n	 The Law of One Price states that the value of a stock is equal to the present value of the 
dividends and future sale price the investor will receive. Because these cash flows are risky, they 
must be discounted at the equity cost of capital, which is the expected return of other securities 
available in the market with equivalent risk to the firm’s equity.
	
n	 The total return of a stock is equal to the dividend yield plus the capital gain rate. The expected 
total return of a stock should equal its equity cost of capital:
	
rE = Div1 + P1
P0
- 1 = Div1
P0
     +      P1 - P0
P0
	
(9.2)
	
n	 When investors have the same beliefs, the dividend-discount model states that, for any horizon 
N, the stock price satisfies the following equation:
	
P0 = Div1
1 + rE
+
Div2
(1 + rE )2 + g +
DivN
(1 + rE )N +
PN
(1 + rE )N 	
(9.4)
¯˘˙
Dividend Yield
¯˘˙
Capital Gain Rate

	
n	 If the stock eventually pays dividends and is never acquired, the dividend-discount model 
implies that the stock price equals the present value of all future dividends.
9.2  Applying the Dividend-Discount Model
	
n	 The constant dividend growth model assumes that dividends grow at a constant expected rate 
g. In that case, g is also the expected capital gain rate, and 
	
P0 = Div1
rE - g	
(9.6)
	
n	 Future dividends depend on earnings, shares outstanding, and the dividend payout rate:
	
Divt =
Earningst
Shares Outstandingt
* Dividend Payout Ratet
	
(9.8)
	
n	 If the dividend payout rate and the number of shares outstanding is constant, and if earnings 
change only as a result of new investment from retained earnings, then the growth rate of the 
firm’s earnings, dividends, and share price is calculated as follows:
	
g = Retention Rate * Return on New Investment	
(9.12)
	
n	 Cutting the firm’s dividend to increase investment will raise the stock price if, and only if, the 
new investments have a positive NPV.
	
n	 If the firm has a long-term growth rate of g after the period N + 1, then we can apply the 
dividend-discount model and use the constant dividend growth formula to estimate the termi-
nal stock value PN.
	
n	 The dividend-discount model is sensitive to the dividend growth rate, which is difficult to esti-
mate accurately.
9.3  Total Payout and Free Cash Flow Valuation Models
	
n	 If the firm undertakes share repurchases, it is more reliable to use the total payout model to 
value the firm. In this model, the value of equity equals the present value of future total divi-
dends and repurchases. To determine the stock price, we divide the equity value by the initial 
number of shares outstanding of the firm:
	
P0 =
PV (Future Total Dividends and Repurchases)
Shares Outstanding0
	
(9.16)
	
n	 The growth rate of the firm’s total payout is governed by the growth rate of earnings, not earn-
ings per share.
	
n	 When a firm has leverage, it is more reliable to use the discounted free cash flow model. In this 
model,
n	 We can estimate the firm’s future free cash flow as
Free Cash Flow = EBIT * (1 - tc) - Net Investment
	
- Increases in Net Working Capital	
(9.20)
where Net Investment equals the firm’s capital expenditures in excess of depreciation.
n	 The firm’s enterprise value (the market value of equity plus debt, less excess cash) equals the 
present value of the firm’s future free cash flow:
	
V0 = PV (Future Free Cash Flow of Firm)	
(9.21)
n	 We discount cash flows using the weighted average cost of capital, which is the expected 
return the firm must pay to investors to compensate them for the risk of holding the firm’s 
debt and equity together.
n	 We can estimate a terminal enterprise value by assuming free cash flow grows at a constant 
rate (typically equal to the rate of long-run revenue growth).

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks
n	 We determine the stock price by subtracting debt and adding cash to the enterprise value, 
and then dividing by the initial number of shares outstanding of the firm:
	
P0 = V0 + Cash0 - Debt0
Shares Outstanding0
	
(9.22)
9.4  Valuation Based on Comparable Firms
	
n	 We can also value stocks by using valuation multiples based on comparable firms. Multiples 
commonly used for this purpose include the P/E ratio and the ratio of enterprise value to 
EBITDA. Using multiples assumes that comparable firms have the same risk and future growth 
as the firm being valued.
	
n	 No valuation model provides a definitive value for the stock. It is best to use several methods to 
identify a reasonable range for the value.
9.5  Information, Competition, and Stock Prices
	
n	 Stock prices aggregate the information of many investors. Therefore, if our valuation disagrees 
with the stock’s market price, it is most likely an indication that our assumptions about the 
firm’s cash flows are wrong.
	
n	 Competition between investors tends to eliminate positive-NPV trading opportunities. Com-
petition will be strongest when information is public and easy to interpret. Privately informed 
traders may be able to profit from their information, which is reflected in prices only gradually.
	
n	 The efficient markets hypothesis states that competition eliminates all positive-NPV trades, 
which is equivalent to stating that securities with equivalent risk have the same expected returns.
	
n	 In an efficient market, investors will not find positive-NPV trading opportunities without some 
source of competitive advantage. By contrast, the average investor will earn a fair return on his 
or her investment.
	
n	 In an efficient market, to raise the stock price corporate managers should focus on maximiz-
ing the present value of the free cash flow from the firm’s investments, rather than accounting 
consequences or financial policy.

9.	 In 2006 and 2007, Kenneth Cole Productions (KCP) paid annual dividends of $0.72. In 2008, 
KCP paid an annual dividend of $0.36, and then paid no further dividends through 2012. 
KCP was acquired at the end of 2012 for $15.25 per share.

projects with an expected return of 15.1% per year. Suppose DFB will maintain the same 
dividend payout rate, retention rate, and return on new investments in the future and will not 
change its number of outstanding shares.
a.	 What growth rate of earnings would you forecast for DFB?
b.	 If DFB’s equity cost of capital is 12.8%, what price would you estimate for DFB stock today?
c.	 Suppose DFB instead paid a dividend of $3.09 per share this year and retained only $0.92

price would you estimate now? Should DFB raise its dividend?
	
11.	 Cooperton Mining just announced it will cut its dividend from $4.07 to $2.47 per share and 
use the extra funds to expand. Prior to the announcement, Cooperton’s dividends were expected 
to grow at a 2.8% rate, and its share price was $50.31. With the new expansion, Cooperton’s

announcement? (Assume Cooperton’s risk is unchanged by the new expansion.) Is the expan-
sion a positive NPV investment?
	
12.	 Procter and Gamble (PG) paid an annual dividend of $1.72 in 2009. You expect PG to increase 
its dividends by 8% per year for the next five years (through 2014), and thereafter by 3% per 
year. If the appropriate equity cost of capital for Procter and Gamble is 8% per year, use the 
dividend-discount model to estimate its value per share at the end of 2009.

at rate g1 and after that at rate g2 forever, when the equity cost of capital is r ?
	
15.	 Halliford Corporation expects to have earnings this coming year of $2.77 per share. Halliford 
plans to retain all of its earnings for the next two years. For the subsequent two years, the firm will 
retain 48% of its earnings. It will then retain 19% of its earnings from that point onward. Each 
year, retained earnings will be invested in new projects with an expected return of 27.21% per 
year. Any earnings that are not retained will be paid out as dividends. Assume Halliford’s share 
count remains constant and all earnings growth comes from the investment of retained earnings. 
If Halliford’s equity cost of capital is 9.5%, what price would you estimate for Halliford stock?

16.	 Suppose Amazon.com Inc. pays no dividends but spent $1.88 billion on share repurchases 
last year. If Amazon’s equity cost of capital is 8.1 %, and if the amount spent on repurchases is 
expected to grow by 6.4% per year, estimate Amazon’s market capitalization. If Amazon has 432 
million shares outstanding, what stock price does this correspond to?
	
17.	 Maynard Steel plans to pay a dividend of $3.03 this year. The company has an expected earn-
ings growth rate of 3.9% per year and an equity cost of capital of 10.9%.
a.	 Assuming Maynard’s dividend payout rate and expected growth rate remains constant, and 
Maynard does not issue or repurchase shares, estimate Maynard’s share price.
b.	 Suppose Maynard decides to pay a dividend of $1.03 this year and use the remaining 
$2 per share to repurchase shares. If Maynard’s total payout rate remains constant, estimate 
­Maynard’s share price.
c.	 If Maynard maintains the dividend and total payout rate given in part (b), at what rate are 
Maynard’s dividends and earnings per share expected to grow?
	
18.	 Benchmark Metrics, Inc. (BMI), an all-equity financed firm, just reported EPS of $4.43 in 2008. 
Despite the economic downturn, BMI is confident regarding its current investment opportuni-
ties. But due to the financial crisis, BMI does not wish to fund these investments externally. The 
Board has therefore decided to suspend its stock repurchase plan and cut its dividend to $1.44 per 
share (vs. almost $2 per share in 2007), and retain these funds instead. The firm has just paid the 
2008 dividend, and BMI plans to keep its dividend at $1.44 per share in 2009 as well. In subse-
quent years, it expects its growth opportunities to slow, and it will still be able to fund its growth 
internally with a target 45% dividend payout ratio, and reinitiating its stock repurchase plan for a 
total payout rate of 58%. (All dividends and repurchases occur at the end of each year.)
Suppose BMI’s existing operations will continue to generate the current level of earnings per 
share in the future. Assume further that the return on new investment is 15%, and that rein-
vestments will account for all future earnings growth (if any). Finally, assume BMI’s equity cost 
of capital is 10%.
a.	 Estimate BMI’s EPS in 2009 and 2010 (before any share repurchases).
b.	 What is the value of a share of BMI at the start of 2009?

years:
After then, the free cash flows are expected to grow at the industry average of 4.3% per year. 
Using the discounted free cash flow model and a weighted average cost of capital of 14.4%:
a.	 Estimate the enterprise value of Heavy Metal.
b.	 If Heavy Metal has no excess cash, debt of $280 million, and 35 million shares outstanding, 
estimate its share price.
	
20.	 IDX Technologies is a privately held developer of advanced security systems based in Chicago. 
As part of your business development strategy, in late 2008 you initiate discussions with IDX’s 
founder about the possibility of acquiring the business at the end of 2008. Estimate the value of 
IDX per share using a discounted FCF approach and the following data:
n	 Debt: $38 million
n	 Excess cash: $118 million
n	 Shares outstanding: 50 million
n	 Expected FCF in 2009: $46 million
n	 Expected FCF in 2010: $57 million
n	 Future FCF growth rate beyond 2010: 4%
n	 Weighted-average cost of capital: 9.4%

21.	 Sora Industries has 61 million outstanding shares, $121 million in debt, $49 million in cash, 
and the following projected free cash flow for the next four years:
a.	 Suppose Sora’s revenue and free cash flow are expected to grow at a 5.7% rate beyond year 4. 
If Sora’s weighted average cost of capital is 11%, what is the value of Sora’s stock based on 
this information?
b.	 Sora’s cost of goods sold was assumed to be 67% of sales. If its cost of goods sold is actually 
70% of sales, how would the estimate of the stock’s value change?
c.	 Let’s return to the assumptions of part (a) and suppose Sora can maintain its cost of goods 
sold at 67% of sales. However, now suppose Sora reduces its selling, general, and administra-
tive expenses from 20% of sales to 16% of sales. What stock price would you estimate now? 
(Assume no other expenses, except taxes, are affected.)
*d.	 Sora’s net working capital needs were estimated to be 18% of sales (which is their current 
level in year 0). If Sora can reduce this requirement to 12% of sales starting in year 1, but all 
other assumptions remain as in part (a), what stock price do you estimate for Sora? (Hint: 
This change will have the largest impact on Sora’s free cash flow in year 1.)
	
22.	 Consider the valuation of Kenneth Cole Productions in Example 9.7.
a.	 Suppose you believe KCP’s initial revenue growth rate will be between 4% and 11% (with 
growth slowing in equal steps to 4% by year 2011). What range of share prices for KCP is 
consistent with these forecasts?
b.	 Suppose you believe KCP’s EBIT margin will be between 7% and 10% of sales. What range 
of share prices for KCP is consistent with these forecasts (keeping KCP’s initial revenue 
growth at 9%)?
c.	 Suppose you believe KCP’s weighted average cost of capital is between 10% and 12%. What 
range of share prices for KCP is consistent with these forecasts (keeping KCP’s initial rev-
enue growth and EBIT margin at 9%)?
d.	What range of share prices is consistent if you vary the estimates as in parts (a), (b), and (c) 
simultaneously?
	
23.	 Kenneth Cole Productions (KCP) was acquired in 2012 for a purchase price of $15.25 per 
share. KCP has 18.5 million shares outstanding, $45 million in cash, and no debt at the time of 
the acquisition.
a.	 Given a weighted average cost of capital of 11%, and assuming no future growth, what level 
of annual free cash flow would justify this acquisition price?
b.	 If KCP’s current annual sales are $480 million, assuming no net capital expenditures or 
increases in net working capital, and a tax rate of 35%, what EBIT margin does your answer 
in part (a) require?

Data Case
As a new analyst for a large brokerage firm, you are anxious to demonstrate the skills you learned 
in your MBA program and prove that you are worth your attractive salary. Your first assignment 
is to analyze the stock of the General Electric Corporation. Your boss recommends determining 
prices based on both the dividend-discount model and discounted free cash flow valuation meth-
ods. GE uses a cost of equity of 10.5% and an after-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5%. 
The expected return on new investments is 12%. However, you are a little concerned because your 
finance professor has told you that these two methods can result in widely differing estimates when 
applied to real data. You are really hoping that the two methods will reach similar prices. Good luck 
with that!
	
1.	 Go to Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) and enter the symbol for General Electric (GE). 
From the main page for GE, gather the following information and enter it onto a spreadsheet:
a.	 The current stock price (last trade) at the top of the page.
b.	 The current dividend amount, found at the bottom right of the stock quote table.

Chapter 9  Valuing Stocks

	
2.	 Next, click “Key Statistics” from the left side of the page. From the Key Statistics page, find the 
total number of shares outstanding.
	
3.	 Next, click “Analyst Estimates” from the left side of the page. From the Analyst Estimates page, 
find the expected growth rate for the next five years and enter it onto your spreadsheet. It will be 
near the very bottom of the page.
	
4.	 Next, click “Income Statement” near the bottom of the menu on the left. Copy and paste the 
entire three years of income statements into a new worksheet in your existing Excel file. (Note : if 
you are using IE as your browser, you can place the cursor in the middle of the statement, right-
click, and select “Export to Microsoft Excel” to download an Excel version.) Repeat this process 
for both the balance sheet and cash flow statement for General Electric. Keep all the different 
statements in the same Excel worksheet.
	
5.	 Finally, go to Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) and enter the symbol for General Electric 
(GE). From the main page, click on the “Key Ratios” tab and calculate the average payout ratio 
from the prior five fiscal years.
	
6.	 To determine the stock value based on the dividend-discount model:
a.	 Create a timeline in Excel for five years.
b.	 Use the dividend obtained from Yahoo! Finance as the current dividend to forecast the next 
five annual dividends based on the five-year growth rate.
c.	 Determine the long-term growth rate based on GE’s payout ratio (which is one minus the 
retention ratio) using Eq. 9.12.
d.	Use the long-term growth rate to determine the stock price for year five using Eq. 9.13.
e.	 Determine the current stock price using Eq. 9.14.
	
7.	 To determine the stock value based on the discounted free cash flow method:
a.	 Forecast the free cash flows using the historic data from the financial statements downloaded 
from Yahoo! to compute the three-year average of the following ratios:
	i.  EBIT/Sales
	ii.  Tax Rate (Income Tax Expense/Income Before Tax)
	iii.  Property Plant and Equipment/Sales
	iv.  Depreciation/Property Plant and Equipment
	v.  Net Working Capital/Sales
b.	 Create a timeline for the next seven years.
c.	 Forecast future sales based on the most recent year’s total revenue growing at the five-year 
growth rate from Yahoo! for the first five years and the long-term growth rate for years 6 and 7.
d.	Use the average ratios computed in part (a) to forecast EBIT, property, plant and equipment, 
depreciation, and net working capital for the next seven years.
e.	 Forecast the free cash flow for the next seven years using Eq. 9.18.
f.	 Determine the horizon enterprise value for year 5 using Eq. 9.24.
g.	 Determine the enterprise value of the firm as the present value of the free cash flows.
h.	Determine the stock price using Eq. 9.22.
	
8.	 Compare the stock prices from the two methods to the actual stock price. What recommen-
dations can you make as to whether clients should buy or sell GE stock based on your price 
estimates?
	
9.	 Explain to your boss why the estimates from the two valuation methods differ. Specifically, 
address the assumptions implicit in the models themselves as well as those you made in preparing 
your analysis. Why do these estimates differ from the actual stock price of GE?

THE LAW OF ONE PRICE CONNECTION.  To apply the Law of One Price 
correctly requires comparing investment opportunities of equivalent risk. In this part 
of the book, we explain how to measure and compare risks across investment oppor-
tunities. Chapter 10 introduces the key insight that investors only demand a risk pre-
mium for risk they cannot costlessly eliminate by diversifying their portfolios. Hence, 
only non-diversifiable market risk will matter when comparing investment opportuni-
ties. Intuitively, this insight suggests that an investment’s risk premium will depend 
on its sensitivity to market risk. In Chapter 11, we quantify these ideas and derive 
investors’ optimal investment portfolio choices. We then consider the implications 
of assuming all investors choose their portfolio of risky investments optimally. This 
assumption leads to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the central model in finan-
cial economics that quantifies the notion of “equivalent risk” and thereby provides the 
relation between risk and return. In Chapter 12, we apply these ideas and consider the 
practicalities of estimating the cost of capital for a firm and for an individual invest-
ment project. Chapter 13 takes a closer look at the behavior of individual, as well as 
professional, investors. Doing so reveals some strengths and weaknesses of the CAPM, 
as well as ways we can combine the CAPM with the principle of no arbitrage for a more 
general model of risk and return.

OVER THE TEN-YEAR PERIOD 2006 THROUGH 2015, investors in 
household product maker Procter & Gamble earned an average return of 7% per year. 
Within this period, there was some variation, with the annual return ranging from -14% 
in 2008 to 24% in 2013. Over the same period, investors in auctioneer Sotheby’s 
earned an average return of 27% per year. These investors, however, lost over 75% in 
2008 and gained nearly 160% in 2009. Finally, investors in three-month U.S. Treasury 
bills earned an average annual return of 1.1% during the period, with a high of 4.7% in 
2006 and a low of 0.02% in 2014. Clearly, these three investments offered returns that 
were very different in terms of their average level and their variability. What accounts 
for these differences?
In this chapter, we will consider why these differences exist. Our goal is to develop 
a theory that explains the relationship between average returns and the variability of 
returns and thereby derive the risk premium that investors require to hold different 
securities and investments. We then use this theory to explain how to determine the 
cost of capital for an investment opportunity.
We begin our investigation of the relationship between risk and return by examin-
ing historical data for publicly traded securities. We will see, for example, that while 
stocks are riskier investments than bonds, they have also earned higher average returns. 
We can interpret the higher average return on stocks as compensation to investors for 
the greater risk they are taking.
But we will also find that not all risk needs to be compensated. By holding a port-
folio containing many different investments, investors can eliminate risks that are spe-
cific to individual securities. Only those risks that cannot be eliminated by holding a 
large portfolio determine the risk premium required by investors. These observations 
will allow us to refine our definition of what risk is, how we can measure it, and thus, how 
to determine the cost of capital.

10.1	 Risk and Return: Insights from 89 Years 
	
	 of Investor History
We begin our look at risk and return by illustrating how risk affects investor decisions and 
returns. Suppose your great-grandparents invested $100 on your behalf at the end of 1925. 
They instructed their broker to reinvest any dividends or interest earned in the account 
until the beginning of 2015. How would that $100 have grown if it were placed in one of 
the following investments?
	
1.	 Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500): A portfolio, constructed by Standard and 
Poor’s, comprising 90 U.S. stocks up to 1957 and 500 U.S. stocks after that. The 
firms represented are leaders in their respective industries and are among the largest 
firms, in terms of market value, traded on U.S. markets.
	
2.	 Small Stocks: A portfolio, updated quarterly, of U.S. stocks traded on the NYSE 
with market capitalizations in the bottom 20%.
	
3.	 World Portfolio: A portfolio of international stocks from all of the world’s major 
stock markets in North America, Europe, and Asia.1
	
4.	 Corporate Bonds: A portfolio of long-term, AAA-rated U.S. corporate bonds with 
maturities of approximately 20 years.2
	
5.	 Treasury Bills: An investment in one-month U.S. Treasury bills.
Figure 10.1 shows the result, through the start of 2015, of investing $100 at the end of 
1925 in each of these five investment portfolios, ignoring transactions costs. During this 
89-year period in the United States, small stocks experienced the highest long-term return, 
followed by the large stocks in the S&P 500, the international stocks in the world port-
folio, corporate bonds, and finally Treasury bills. All of the investments grew faster than 
inflation, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI).
At first glance the graph is striking—had your great-grandparents invested $100 in the 
small stock portfolio, the investment would be worth more than $4.6 million at the beginning 
of 2015! By contrast, if they had invested in Treasury bills, the investment would be worth 
only about $2,000. Given this wide difference, why invest in anything other than small stocks?
But first impressions can be misleading. While over the full horizon stocks (especially 
small stocks) did outperform the other investments, they also endured periods of signifi-
cant losses. Had your great-grandparents put the $100 in a small stock portfolio during the 
Depression era of the 1930s, it would have grown to $181 in 1928, but then fallen to only 
$15 by 1932. Indeed, it would take until World War II for stock investments to outper-
form corporate bonds.
Even more importantly, your great-grandparents would have sustained losses at a time 
when they likely needed their savings the most––in the depths of the Great Depression. A 
similar story held during the 2008 financial crisis: All of the stock portfolios declined by 
more than 50%, with the small stock portfolio declining by almost 70% (over $1.5 million!) 
from its peak in 2007 to its lowest point in 2009. Again, many investors faced a double 
whammy: an increased risk of being unemployed (as firms started laying off employees)

precisely when the value of their savings eroded. Thus, while the stock portfolios had the 
best performance over this 89-year period, that performance came at a cost––the risk of large 
losses in a downturn. On the other hand, Treasury bills enjoyed steady––albeit ­modest––
gains each year.
Few people ever make an investment for 89 years, as depicted in Figure 10.1. To gain 
additional perspective on the risk and return of these investments, Figure 10.2 shows the 
results for more realistic investment horizons and different initial investment dates. Panel 
(a), for example, shows the value of each investment after one year and illustrates that if 
we rank the investments by the volatility of their annual increases and decreases in value, 
we obtain the same ranking we observed with regard to performance: Small stocks had the 
most variable returns, followed by the S&P 500, the world portfolio, corporate bonds, and 
finally Treasury bills.
Panels (b), (c), and (d) of Figure 10.2 show the results for 5-, 10-, and 20-year invest-
ment horizons, respectively. Note that as the horizon lengthens, the relative performance 
of the stock portfolios improves. That said, even with a 10-year horizon there were periods 
during which stocks underperformed Treasuries. And while investors in small stocks most 
often came out ahead, this was not assured even with a 20-year horizon: For investors in

the early 1980s, small stocks did worse than both the S&P 500 and corporate bonds over 
the subsequent 20 years. Finally, stock investors with long potential horizons might find 
themselves in need of cash in intervening years, and be forced to liquidate at a loss relative 
to safer alternatives.
In Chapter 3, we explained why investors are averse to fluctuations in the value of their 
investments, and that investments that are more likely to suffer losses in downturns must 
compensate investors for this risk with higher expected returns. Figures 10.1 and 10.2 
provide compelling historical evidence of this relationship between risk and return, just as 
we should expect in an efficient market. But while it is clear that investors do not like risk 
and thus demand a risk premium to bear it, our goal in this chapter is to quantify this rela-
tionship. We want to explain how much investors demand (in terms of a higher expected 
return) to bear a given level of risk. To do so, we must first develop tools that will allow us 
to measure risk and return—the objective of the next section.

plotted as a function of the initial investment date. Dividends and ­interest are reinvested and transaction costs are excluded. 
Note that small stocks show the greatest variation in performance at the one-year horizon, followed by large stocks and 
then corporate bonds. For longer horizons, the relative performance of stocks improved, but they remained riskier.

10.2	 Common Measures of Risk and Return
When a manager makes an investment decision or an investor purchases a security, they 
have some view as to the risk involved and the likely return the investment will earn. Thus, 
we begin our discussion by reviewing the standard ways to define and measure risks.
Probability Distributions
Different securities have different initial prices, pay different cash flows, and sell for dif-
ferent future amounts. To make them comparable, we express their performance in terms 
of their returns. The return indicates the percentage increase in the value of an investment 
per dollar initially invested in the security. When an investment is risky, there are different 
returns it may earn. Each possible return has some likelihood of occurring. We summarize 
this information with a probability distribution, which assigns a probability, pR, that 
each possible return, R, will occur.
Let’s consider a simple example. Suppose BFI stock currently trades for $100 per share. 
You believe that in one year there is a 25% chance the share price will be $140, a 50% 
chance it will be $110, and a 25% chance it will be $80. BFI pays no dividends, so these 
payoffs correspond to returns of 40%, 10%, and -20%, respectively. Table 10.1 summa-
rizes the probability distribution for BFI’s returns.
We can also represent the probability distribution with a histogram, as shown in 
Figure 10.3.
Expected Return
Given the probability distribution of returns, we can compute the expected return. We 
calculate the expected (or mean) return as a weighted average of the possible returns, 
where the weights correspond to the probabilities.3
Expected (Mean) Return
	
Expected Return = E[R] = a R pR * R
(10.1)
3The notation R means that we calculate the sum of the expression (in this case, pR * R) over all possible 
returns R.

Probability Distribution of Returns for BFI

The expected return is the return we would earn on average if we could repeat the 
investment many times, drawing the return from the same distribution each time. In terms 
of the histogram, the expected return is the “balancing point” of the distribution, if we 
think of the probabilities as weights. The expected return for BFI is
E[RBFI] = 25%(-0.20) + 50%(0.10) + 25%(0.40) = 10%
This expected return corresponds to the balancing point in Figure 10.3.
Variance and Standard Deviation
Two common measures of the risk of a probability distribution are its variance and 
standard deviation. The variance is the expected squared deviation from the mean, and the 
standard deviation is the square root of the variance.
Variance and Standard Deviation of the Return Distribution
	
Var(R) = E[(R - E[R])2] = a R  pR * (R - E[R])2
	
SD(R) = 2Var(R)
(10.2)
If the return is risk-free and never deviates from its mean, the variance is zero. Other-
wise, the variance increases with the magnitude of the deviations from the mean. There-
fore, the variance is a measure of how “spread out” the distribution of the return is. The 
variance of BFI’s return is
 Var(RBFI) = 25% *  (-0.20- 0.10)2 +  50% *  (0.10-0.10)2 +  25% * (0.40 - 0.10)2
 = 0.045
The standard deviation of the return is the square root of the variance, so for BFI,
	
SD(R) = 2Var(R) = 20.045 = 21.2%
(10.3)

10.2  Common Measures of Risk and Return	
355

356	
Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
In finance, we refer to the standard deviation of a return as its volatility. While the vari-
ance and the standard deviation both measure the variability of the returns, the standard 
deviation is easier to interpret because it is in the same units as the returns themselves.4
4While variance and standard deviation are the most common measures of risk, they do not differenti-
ate upside and downside risk. Alternative measures that focus on downside risk include the semivariance 
(variance of the losses only) and the expected tail loss (the expected loss in the worst x% of outcomes). 
Because they often produce the same ranking (as in Example 10.1, or if returns are normally distributed) 
but are more complicated to apply, these alternative measures tend to be used only in special applications.
Example 10.1
Calculating the Expected Return and Volatility
Problem
Suppose AMC stock is equally likely to have a 45% return or a -25% return. What are its 
expected return and volatility?
Solution
First, we calculate the expected return by taking the probability-weighted average of the possible 
returns:
E[R ] = a R pR * R = 50% * 0.45 + 50% * (-0.25) = 10.0%
To compute the volatility, we first determine the variance:
Var(R ) = a R  pR * (R - E[R ])2 = 50% * (0.45 - 0.10)2 + 50% * (-0.25 - 0.10)2
= 0.1225
Then, the volatility or standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
SD(R ) = 2Var (R ) = 20.1225 = 35%
Note that both AMC and BFI have the same expected return, 10%. However, the 
returns for AMC are more spread out than those for BFI—the high returns are higher and 
the low returns are lower, as shown by the histogram in Figure 10.4. As a result, AMC has 
a higher variance and volatility than BFI.
Figure 10.4 
Probability Distribution  
for BFI and AMC Returns
While both stocks have the 
same expected return, AMC’s 
return has a higher variance 
and standard deviation.

If we could observe the probability distributions that investors anticipate for different 
securities, we could compute their expected returns and volatilities and explore the rela-
tionship between them. Of course, in most situations we do not know the explicit prob-
ability distribution, as we did for BFI. Without that information, how can we estimate and 
compare risk and return? A popular approach is to extrapolate from historical data, which 
is a sensible strategy if we are in a stable environment and believe that the distribution 
of future returns should mirror that of past returns. Let’s look at the historical returns of 
stocks and bonds, to see what they reveal about the relationship between risk and return.
Concept Check	
1.	 How do we calculate the expected return of a stock?
	
2.	 What are the two most common measures of risk, and how are they related to each other?
	
10.3	 Historical Returns of Stocks and Bonds
In this section, we explain how to compute average returns and volatilities using historical 
stock market data. The distribution of past returns can be helpful when we seek to estimate 
the distribution of returns investors may expect in the future. We begin by first explaining 
how to compute historical returns.
Computing Historical Returns
Of all the possible returns, the realized return is the return that actually occurs over a par-
ticular time period. How do we measure the realized return for a stock? Suppose you invest 
in a stock on date t for price Pt. If the stock pays a dividend, Divt +1, on date t + 1, and you 
sell the stock at that time for price Pt +1, then the realized return from your investment in 
the stock from t to t + 1 is
	
Rt +1 = Divt +1 + Pt +1
Pt
- 1 = Divi +1
Pt
+ Pt +1 - Pt
Pt
	
= Dividend Yield + Capital Gain Rate
(10.4)
That is, as we discussed in Chapter 9, the realized return, Rt +1, is the total return we earn 
from dividends and capital gains, expressed as a percentage of the initial stock price.5
Calculating Realized Annual Returns.  If you hold the stock beyond the date of the first 
dividend, then to compute your return you must specify how you invest any dividends you 
receive in the interim. To focus on the returns of a single security, let’s assume that you 
reinvest all dividends immediately and use them to purchase additional shares of the same stock 
or security. In this case, we can use Eq. 10.4 to compute the stock’s return between divi-
dend payments, and then compound the returns from each dividend interval to compute 
the return over a longer horizon. For example, if a stock pays dividends at the end of each 
quarter, with realized returns RQ1, c , RQ4 each quarter, then its annual realized return, 
Rannual, is
	
1 + Rannual = (1 + RQ1)(1 + RQ2)(1 + RQ3)(1 + RQ4)
(10.5)
5We can compute the realized return for any security in the same way, by replacing the dividend payments 
with any cash flows paid by the security (e.g., with a bond, coupon payments would replace dividends).
	
10.3  Historical Returns of Stocks and Bonds

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
Example 10.2 illustrates two features of the returns from holding a stock like Microsoft. 
First, both dividends and capital gains contribute to the total realized return—ignoring 
either one would give a very misleading impression of Microsoft’s performance. Second, 
the returns are risky. In years like 2004 the returns are positive, but in other years like 2008 
they are negative, meaning Microsoft’s shareholders lost money over the year.
We can compute realized returns in this same way for any investment. We can also com-
pute the realized returns for an entire portfolio, by keeping track of the interest and divi-
dend payments paid by the portfolio during the year, as well as the change in the market 
value of the portfolio. For example, the realized returns for the S&P 500 index are shown 
in Table 10.2, which for comparison purposes also lists the returns for Microsoft and for 
three-month Treasury bills.
Example 10.2
Realized Returns for Microsoft Stock
Problem
What were the realized annual returns for Microsoft stock in 2004 and 2008?
Solution
When we compute Microsoft’s annual return, we assume that the proceeds from the dividend 
payment were immediately reinvested in Microsoft stock. That way, the return corresponds to 
remaining fully invested in Microsoft over the entire period. To do that we look up Microsoft 
stock price data at the start and end of the year, as well as at any dividend dates (Yahoo!Finance  
is a good source for such data; see also 
 or www.berkdemarzo.com for addi-
tional sources). From these data, we can construct the following table (prices and dividends 
in $/share):
The return from December 31, 2003, until August 23, 2004, is equal to
0.08 + 27.24
27.37
- 1 = -0.18%
The rest of the returns in the table are computed similarly. We then calculate the annual returns 
using Eq. 10.5:
R2004 = (0.9982)(1.1186)(0.9755) - 1 = 8.92%
R2008 = (0.7944)(1.0611)(0.9211)(0.7229)(0.9908) - 1 = -44.39%
6The large dividend in November 2004 included a $3 special dividend which Microsoft used to reduce 
its accumulating cash balance and disburse $32 billion in cash to its investors, in the largest aggregate 
dividend payment in history.

Comparing Realized Annual Returns.  Once we have calculated the realized annual returns, we 
can compare them to see which investments performed better in a given year. From Table 10.2, 
we can see that Microsoft stock outperformed the S&P 500 and Treasuries in 2007, 2009, 
2013, and 2014. On the other hand, in 2002 and 2008, Treasury bills performed better than 
both Microsoft stock and the S&P 500. Note also the overall tendency for Microsoft’s return 
to move in the same direction as the S&P 500, which it did in ten out of the thirteen years.
Over any particular period we observe only one draw from the probability distribution 
of returns. However, if the probability distribution remains the same, we can observe mul-
tiple draws by observing the realized return over multiple periods. By counting the number 
of times the realized return falls within a particular range, we can estimate the underlying 
probability distribution. Let’s illustrate this process with the data in Figure 10.1.
Figure 10.5 plots the annual returns for each U.S. investment in Figure 10.1 in a histo-
gram. The height of each bar represents the number of years that the annual returns were 
in each range indicated on the x-axis. When we plot the probability distribution in this way 
using historical data, we refer to it as the empirical distribution of the returns.
Average Annual Returns
The average annual return of an investment during some historical period is simply the 
average of the realized returns for each year. That is, if Rt is the realized return of a security 
in year t, then the average annual return for years 1 through T is

Notice that the average annual return is the balancing point of the empirical ­distribution—
in this case, the probability of a return occurring in a particular range is measured by 
the number of times the realized return falls in that range. Therefore, if the probability

The Variance and Volatility of Returns
Looking at Figure 10.5, we can see that the variability of the returns is very different for 
each investment. The distribution of small stocks’ returns shows the widest spread. The 
large stocks of the S&P 500 have returns that vary less than those of small stocks, but much 
more than the returns of corporate bonds or Treasury bills.
To quantify this difference in variability, we can estimate the standard deviation of the 
probability distribution. As before, we will use the empirical distribution to derive this 
estimate. Using the same logic as we did with the mean, we estimate the variance by com-
puting the average squared deviation from the mean. We do not actually know the mean, 
so instead we use the best estimate of the mean—the average realized return.7
Variance Estimate Using Realized Returns
	
Var(R) =
1
T - 1 a
T
t =1
(Rt - R)2
(10.7)
We estimate the standard deviation or volatility as the square root of the variance.8
7Why do we divide by T - 1 rather than by T here? It is because we do not know the true expected return, 
and so must compute deviations from the estimated average return R. But in calculating the average 
return from the data, we lose a degree of freedom (in essence, we “use up” one of the data points), so that 
effectively we only have T - 1 remaining data points to estimate the variance.
8If the returns used in Eq. 10.7 are not annual returns, the variance is typically converted to annual terms 
by multiplying the number of periods per year. For example, when using monthly returns, we multiply the 
variance by 12 and, equivalently, the standard deviation by 212.
Example 10.3
Computing a Historical Volatility
Problem
Using the data from Table 10.2, what are the variance and volatility of the S&P 500’s returns for 
the years 2002–2014?
Solution
Earlier, we calculated the average annual return of the S&P 500 during this period to be 8.7%. 
Therefore,
Var (R ) =
1
T - 1 a t (Rt - R )2
=
1
13 - 1
 [(-0.221 - 0.087)2 + (0.287 - 0.087)2 + g + (0.137 - 0.087)2]
= 0.038
The volatility or standard deviation is therefore SD(R ) = 2Var (R ) = 20.038 = 19.5%
We can compute the standard deviation of the returns to quantify the differences in the 
variability of the distributions that we observed in Figure 10.5. These results are shown in 
Table 10.4.
Comparing the volatilities in Table 10.4 we see that, as expected, small stocks have 
had the most variable historical returns, followed by large stocks. The returns of corporate 
bonds and Treasury bills are much less variable than stocks, with Treasury bills being the 
least volatile investment category.

Estimation Error: Using Past Returns to Predict the Future
To estimate the cost of capital for an investment, we need to determine the expected return 
that investors will require to compensate them for that investment’s risk. If the distribu-
tion of past returns and the distribution of future returns are the same, we could look at 
the return investors expected to earn in the past on the same or similar investments, and 
assume they will require the same return in the future. However, there are two difficulties 
with this approach. First,
We do not know what investors expected in the past; we can only observe the actual returns 
that were realized.
In 2008, for example, investors lost 37% investing in the S&P 500, which is surely not 
what they expected at the beginning of the year (or they would have invested in Treasury 
Bills instead!).
If we believe that investors are neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic on average, then 
over time, the average realized return should match investors’ expected return. Armed with 
this assumption, we can use a security’s historical average return to infer its expected return. 
But now we encounter the second difficulty:
The average return is just an estimate of the true expected return, and is subject to estima-
tion error.
Given the volatility of stock returns, this estimation error can be large even with many 
years of data, as we will see next.
Standard Error.  We measure the estimation error of a statistical estimate by its standard 
error. The standard error is the standard deviation of the estimated value of the mean of 
the actual distribution around its true value; that is, it is the standard deviation of the aver-
age return. The standard error provides an indication of how far the sample average might 
deviate from the expected return. If the distribution of a stock’s return is identical each 
year, and each year’s return is independent of prior years’ returns,9 then we calculate the 
standard error of the estimate of the expected return as follows:
Standard Error of the Estimate of the Expected Return
	
SD (Average of Independent, Identical Risks) =
SD (Individual Risk)
2Number of Observations

(10.8)
9Saying that returns are independent and identically distributed (IID) means that the likelihood that the 
return has a given outcome is the same each year and does not depend on past returns (in the same way 
that the odds of a coin coming up heads do not depend on past flips). It turns out to be a reasonable first 
approximation for stock returns.

Corporate Bonds, and Treasury Bills, 1926–2014

Because the average return will be within two standard errors of the true expected return 
approximately 95% of the time,10 we can use the standard error to determine a reasonable 
range for the true expected value. The 95% confidence interval for the expected return is
	
Historical Average Return { (2 * Standard Error)
(10.9)
For example, from 1926 to 2014 the average return of the S&P 500 was 12.0% with 
a volatility of 20.1%. Assuming its returns are drawn from an independent and identical 
distribution (IID) each year, the 95% confidence interval for the expected return of the 
S&P 500 during this period is
12.0% { 2 ¢20.1%
289
≤= 12.0% { 4.3%
or a range from 7.7% to 16.3%. Thus, even with 89 years of data, we cannot estimate the 
expected return of the S&P 500 very accurately. If we believe the distribution may have 
changed over time and we can use only more recent data to estimate the expected return, 
then the estimate will be even less accurate.
Limitations of Expected Return Estimates.  Individual stocks tend to be even more vola-
tile than large portfolios, and many have been in existence for only a few years, providing 
little data with which to estimate returns. Because of the relatively large estimation error 
in such cases, the average return investors earned in the past is not a reliable estimate of a 
security’s expected return. Instead, we need to derive a different method to estimate the 
expected return that relies on more reliable statistical estimates. In the remainder of this 
chapter, we will pursue the following alternative strategy: First we will consider how to 
measure a security’s risk, and then we will use the relationship between risk and return—
which we must still determine—to estimate its expected return.
10If returns are independent and from a normal distribution, then the estimated mean will be within two 
standard errors of the true mean 95.44% of the time. Even if returns are not normally distributed, this 
formula is approximately correct with a sufficient number of independent observations.
Example 10.4
 The Accuracy of Expected Return Estimates
Problem
Using the returns for the S&P 500 from 2002–2014 only (see Table 10.2), what is the 95% 
confidence interval you would estimate for the S&P 500’s expected return?
Solution
Earlier, we calculated the average return for the S&P 500 during this period to be 8.7%, with 
a volatility of 19.5% (see Example 10.3). The standard error of our estimate of the expected 
return is 19.5% , 213 = 5.4%, and the 95% confidence interval is 8.7% { (2 * 5.4%), or 
from -2.1% to 19.5%. As this example shows, with only a few years of data, we cannot reliably 
estimate expected returns for stocks—or even whether they are positive or negative!

Arithmetic Average Returns Versus Compound Annual Returns
We compute average annual returns by calculating an 
­arithmetic average. An alternative is the compound annual 
return (also called the compound annual growth rate, or 
CAGR), which is computed as the geometric average of the 
annual returns R1, c , RT:
Compound Annual Return =
[(1 + R1) * (1 + R2) * c * (1 + RT)]1/T - 1
It is equivalent to the IRR of the investment over the period:
(Final Value/Initial Investment)1/T - 1
For example, using the data in Figure  10.1, the com-
pound annual return of the S&P 500 from 1926–2014 was
(480,560/100)1/89 - 1 = 9.99%
That is, investing in the S&P 500 from 1926 to 2015 was 
equivalent to earning 9.99% per year over that time period. 
Similarly, the compound annual return for small stocks was 
12.8%, for corporate bonds was 6.3%, and for Treasury bills 
was 3.4%.
In each case, the compound annual return is below the 
average annual return shown in Table 10.3. This difference 
reflects the fact that returns are volatile. To see the effect 
of volatility, suppose an investment has annual returns of 
+20% one year and -20% the next year. The average 
annual return is 1
2 (20% - 20%) = 0%, but the value of $1 
invested after two years is
$1 * (1.20) * (0.80) = $0.96
That is, an investor would have lost money. Why? 
Because the 20% gain happens on a $1 investment, whereas 
the 20% loss happens on a larger investment of $1.20. In 
this case, the compound annual return is
(0.96)1/2 - 1 = -2.02%
This logic implies that the compound annual return will 
always be below the average return, and the difference grows 
with the volatility of the annual returns. (Typically, the dif-
ference is about half of the variance of the returns.)
Which is a better description of an investment’s return? 
The compound annual return is a better description of 
the long-run historical performance of an investment. 
It describes the equivalent risk-free return that would be 
required to duplicate the investment’s performance over 
the same time period. The ranking of the long-run perfor-
mance of different investments coincides with the ranking 
of their compound annual returns. Thus, the compound 
annual return is the return that is most often used for com-
parison purposes. For example, mutual funds generally 
report their compound annual returns over the last five or 
ten years.
Conversely, we should use the arithmetic average return 
when we are trying to estimate an investment’s expected 
return over a future horizon based on its past performance. 
If we view past returns as independent draws from the same 
distribution, then the arithmetic average return provides an 
unbiased estimate of the true expected return.*
For example, if the investment mentioned above is 
equally likely to have annual returns of +20% and -20% 
in the future, then if we observe many two-year periods, a 
$1 investment will be equally likely to grow to
 (1.20)(1.20) = $1.44,
 (1.20)(0.80) = $0.96,
 (0.80)(1.20) = $0.96,
or  (0.80)(0.80) = $0.64.
Thus, the average value in two years will be (1.44 + 0.96
+ 0.96 + 0.64)/4 = $1, so that the expected annual and 
two-year returns will both be 0%.
*For this result to hold we must compute the historical returns using the same time interval as the expected return we are estimating; that is, we use 
the average of past monthly returns to estimate the future monthly return, or the average of past annual returns to estimate the future annual return. 
Because of estimation error the estimate for different time intervals will generally differ from the result one would get by simply compounding the 
average annual return. With enough data, however, the results will converge.
	
10.4	 The Historical Trade-Off Between Risk and Return
In Chapter 3, we discussed the idea that investors are risk averse: The benefit they receive 
from an increase in income is smaller than the personal cost of an equivalent decrease in 
income. This idea suggests that investors would not choose to hold a portfolio that is more 
volatile unless they expected to earn a higher return. In this section, we quantify the his-
torical relationship between volatility and average returns.

The Returns of Large Portfolios
In Tables 10.3 and 10.4, we computed the historical average returns and volatilities for 
several different types of investments. We combine those data in Table 10.5, which lists 
the volatility and excess return for each investment. The excess return is the difference 
between the average return for the investment and the average return for Treasury bills, a 
risk-free investment, and measures the average risk premium investors earned for bearing 
the risk of the investment.
In Figure 10.6, we plot the average return versus the volatility of different investments. 
In addition to the ones we have already considered, we also include data for a large port-
folio of mid-cap stocks, or stocks of median size in the U.S. market. Note the positive 
relationship: The investments with higher volatility have rewarded investors with higher 
average returns. Both Table 10.5 and Figure 10.6 are consistent with our view that inves-
tors are risk averse. Riskier investments must offer investors higher average returns to com-
pensate them for the extra risk they are taking on.

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
The Returns of Individual Stocks
Figure  10.6 suggests the following simple model of the risk premium: Investments 
with higher volatility should have a higher risk premium and therefore higher returns. 
Indeed, looking at Figure 10.6 it is tempting to draw a line through the portfolios and 
conclude that all investments should lie on or near this line—that is, expected return 
should rise proportionately with volatility. This conclusion appears to be approximately 
true for the large portfolios we have looked at so far. Is it correct? Does it apply to indi-
vidual stocks?
Unfortunately, the answer to both questions is no. Figure 10.7 shows that, if we look at 
the volatility and return of individual stocks, we do not see any clear relationship between 
them. Each point represents the volatility and average return from investing in the Nth 
largest stock traded in the United States (updated quarterly) for N = 1 to 500.
We can make several important observations from these data. First, there is a relation-
ship between size and risk: Larger stocks have lower volatility overall. Second, even the 
largest stocks are typically more volatile than a portfolio of large stocks, the S&P 500. 
Finally, there is no clear relationship between volatility and return. While the small-
est stocks have a slightly higher average return, many stocks have higher volatility and 
lower average returns than other stocks. And all stocks seem to have higher risk and lower 
returns than we would have predicted from a simple extrapolation of our data from large 
portfolios.
Thus, while volatility is perhaps a reasonable measure of risk when evaluating a large 
portfolio, it is not adequate to explain the returns of individual securities. Why wouldn’t 
investors demand a higher return from stocks with a higher volatility? And how is it that 
the S&P 500—a portfolio of the 500 largest stocks—is so much less risky than all of the 
500 stocks individually? To answer these questions, we need to think more carefully about 
how to measure risk for an investor.

10.5	 Common Versus Independent Risk
In this section, we explain why the risk of an individual security differs from the risk of a port-
folio composed of similar securities. We begin with an example from the insurance industry.
Theft  Versus Earthquake Insurance: An Example
Consider two types of home insurance: theft insurance and earthquake insurance. Let us 
assume, for the purpose of illustration, that the risk of each of these two hazards is similar 
for a given home in the San Francisco area. Each year there is about a 1% chance that the 
home will be robbed and a 1% chance that the home will be damaged by an earthquake. 
So, the chance the insurance company will pay a claim for a single home is the same for 
both types of insurance policies. Suppose an insurance company writes 100,000 policies 
of each type for homeowners in San Francisco. We know that the risks of the individual 
policies are similar, but are the risks of the portfolios of policies similar?
First, consider theft insurance. Because the chance of a theft in any given home is 1%, 
we would expect about 1% of the 100,000 homes to experience a robbery. Thus, the num-
ber of theft claims will be about 1000 per year. The actual number of claims may be a bit 
higher or lower each year, but not by much. We can estimate the likelihood that the insur-
ance company will receive different numbers of claims, assuming that instances of theft are 
independent of one another (that is, the fact that one house is robbed does not change the 
odds of other houses being robbed). The number of claims will almost always be between 
875 and 1125 (0.875% and 1.125% of the number of policies written). In this case, if the 
insurance company holds reserves sufficient to cover 1200 claims, it will almost certainly 
have enough to meet its obligations on its theft insurance policies.
Now consider earthquake insurance. Most years, an earthquake will not occur. But 
because the homes are in the same city, if an earthquake does occur, all homes are likely to 
be affected and the insurance company can expect as many as 100,000 claims. As a result, 
the insurance company will have to hold reserves sufficient to cover claims on all 100,000 
policies it wrote to meet its obligations if an earthquake occurs.
Thus, although the expected numbers of claims may be the same, earthquake and theft 
insurance lead to portfolios with very different risk characteristics. For earthquake insur-
ance, the number of claims is very risky. It will most likely be zero, but there is a 1% chance 
that the insurance company will have to pay claims on all the policies it wrote. In this case, 
the risk of the portfolio of insurance policies is no different from the risk of any single pol-
icy—it is still all or nothing. Conversely, for theft insurance, the number of claims in a given 
year is quite predictable. Year in and year out, it will be very close to 1% of the total number 
of policies, or 1000 claims. The portfolio of theft insurance policies has almost no risk!11
11In the case of insurance, this difference in risk—and therefore in required reserves—can lead to a signifi-
cant difference in the cost of the insurance. Indeed, earthquake insurance is generally thought to be much 
more expensive to purchase, even though the risk to an individual household may be similar to other risks, 
such as theft or fire.

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
Types of Risk.  Why are the portfolios of insurance policies so different when the indi-
vidual policies themselves are quite similar? Intuitively, the key difference between them 
is that an earthquake affects all houses simultaneously, so the risk is perfectly correlated 
across homes. We call risk that is perfectly correlated common risk. In contrast, because 
thefts in different houses are not related to each other, the risk of theft is uncorrelated 
and independent across homes. We call risks that share no correlation independent risks. 
When risks are independent, some individual homeowners are unlucky and others are 
lucky, but overall the number of claims is quite predictable. The averaging out of indepen-
dent risks in a large portfolio is called diversification.
The Role of Diversification
We can quantify this difference in terms of the standard deviation of the percentage of 
claims. First, consider the standard deviation for an individual homeowner. At the begin-
ning of the year, the homeowner expects a 1% chance of placing a claim for either type of 
insurance. But at the end of the year, the homeowner will have filed a claim (100%) or not 
(0%). Using Eq. 10.2, the standard deviation is
SD (Claim) = 2Var(Claim)
= 20.99 * (0 - 0.01)2 + 0.01 * (1 - 0.01)2 = 9.95%
For the homeowner, this standard deviation is the same for a loss from earthquake or 
theft.
Now consider the standard deviation of the percentage of claims for the insurance com-
pany. In the case of earthquake insurance, because the risk is common, the percentage of 
claims is either 100% or 0%, just as it was for the homeowner. Thus, the percentage of 
claims received by the earthquake insurer is also 1% on average, with a 9.95% standard 
deviation.
While the theft insurer also receives 1% of claims on average, because the risk of theft 
is independent across households, the portfolio is much less risky. To quantify this differ-
ence, let’s calculate the standard deviation of the average claim using Eq. 10.8. Recall that 
when risks are independent and identical, the standard deviation of the average is known 
as the standard error, which declines with the square root of the number of observations. 
Therefore,
SD (Percentage Theft Claims) =
SD (Individual Claim)
2Number of Observations
=
9.95%
2100,000
= 0.03%
Thus, there is almost no risk for the theft insurer.
The principle of diversification is used routinely in the insurance industry. In addition 
to theft insurance, many other forms of insurance (e.g., life, health, auto) rely on the fact 
that the number of claims is relatively predictable in a large portfolio. Even in the case 
of earthquake insurance, insurers can achieve some diversification by selling policies in 
different geographical regions or by combining different types of policies. Diversification 
reduces risk in many other settings. For example, farmers often diversify the types of crops 
they plant to reduce the risk from the failure of any individual crop. Similarly, firms may 
diversify their supply chains or product lines to reduce the risk from supply disruptions or 
demand shocks.

	
10.6	 Diversification in Stock Portfolios
As the insurance example indicates, the risk of a portfolio of insurance contracts depends 
on whether the individual risks within it are common or independent. Independent risks 
are diversified in a large portfolio, whereas common risks are not. Let’s consider the impli-
cation of this distinction for the risk of stock portfolios.12
12Harry Markowitz was the first to formalize the role of diversification in forming an optimal stock mar-
ket portfolio. See H. Markowitz, “Portfolio Selection,” Journal of Finance 7 (1952): 77–91.

Example 10.5
Diversification and Gambling
Problem
Roulette wheels are typically marked with the numbers 1 through 36 plus 0 and 00. Each of 
these outcomes is equally likely every time the wheel is spun. If you place a bet on any one 
number and are correct, the payoff is 35:1; that is, if you bet $1, you will receive $36 if you win 
($35 plus your original $1) and nothing if you lose. Suppose you place a $1 bet on your favorite 
number. What is the casino’s expected profit? What is the standard deviation of this profit for a 
single bet? Suppose 9 million similar bets are placed throughout the casino in a typical month. 
What is the standard deviation of the casino’s average revenues per dollar bet each month?
Solution
Because there are 38 numbers on the wheel, the odds of winning are 1/38. The casino loses $35 
if you win, and makes $1 if you lose. Therefore, using Eq. 10.1, the casino’s expected profit is
E [Payoff ] = (1/38) * (-$35) + (37/38) * ($1) = $0.0526
That is, for each dollar bet, the casino earns 5.26 cents on average. For a single bet, we calculate 
the standard deviation of this profit using Eq. 10.2 as
SD (Payoff ) = 2(1/38) * (-35 - 0.0526)2 + (37/38) * (1 - 0.0526)2 = $5.76
This standard deviation is quite large relative to the magnitude of the profits. But if many 
such bets are placed, the risk will be diversified. Using Eq. 10.8, the standard deviation of the 
casino’s average revenues per dollar bet (i.e., the standard error of their payoff ⁜) is only
SD (Average Payoff ) =
$5.76
29,000,000
= $0.0019
In other words, by the same logic as Eq. 10.9, there is roughly 95% chance the casino’s profit 
per dollar bet will be in the interval $0.0526 { (2 * 0.0019) = $0.0488 to $0.0564. Given 
$9 million in bets placed, the casino’s monthly profits will almost always be between $439,000 
and $508,000, which is very little risk. The key assumption, of course, is that each bet is sepa-
rate so that their outcomes are independent of each other. If the $9 million were placed in a 
single bet, the casino’s risk would be large—losing 35 * $9 million = $315 million if the bet 
wins. For this reason, casinos often impose limits on the amount of any individual bet.

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
Firm-Specific Versus Systematic Risk
Over any given time period, the risk of holding a stock is that the dividends plus the final 
stock price will be higher or lower than expected, which makes the realized return risky. 
What causes dividends or stock prices, and therefore returns, to be higher or lower than we 
expect? Usually, stock prices and dividends fluctuate due to two types of news:
	
1.	 Firm-specific news is good or bad news about the company itself. For example, a 
firm might announce that it has been successful in gaining market share within its 
industry.
	
2.	 Market-wide news is news about the economy as a whole and therefore affects all 
stocks. For instance, the Federal Reserve might announce that it will lower interest 
rates to boost the economy.
Fluctuations of a stock’s return that are due to firm-specific news are independent risks. 
Like theft across homes, these risks are unrelated across stocks. This type of risk is also 
referred to as firm-specific, idiosyncratic, unique, or diversifiable risk.
Fluctuations of a stock’s return that are due to market-wide news represent common 
risk. As with earthquakes, all stocks are affected simultaneously by the news. This type of 
risk is also called systematic, undiversifiable, or market risk.
When we combine many stocks in a large portfolio, the firm-specific risks for each stock 
will average out and be diversified. Good news will affect some stocks, and bad news will 
affect others, but the amount of good or bad news overall will be relatively constant. The 
systematic risk, however, will affect all firms—and therefore the entire portfolio—and will 
not be diversified.
Let’s consider an example. Suppose type S firms are affected only by the strength of the 
economy, which has a 50–50 chance of being either strong or weak. If the economy is 
strong, type S stocks will earn a return of 40%; if the economy is weak, their return will be 
-20%. Because these firms face systematic risk (the strength of the economy), holding a 
large portfolio of type S firms will not diversify the risk. When the economy is strong, the 
portfolio will have the same return of 40% as each type S firm; when the economy is weak, 
the portfolio will also have a return of -20%.
Now consider type I firms, which are affected only by idiosyncratic, firm-specific risks. 
Their returns are equally likely to be 35% or -25%, based on factors specific to each firm’s 
local market. Because these risks are firm specific, if we hold a portfolio of the stocks of 
many type I firms, the risk is diversified. About half of the firms will have returns of 35%, 
and half will have returns of -25%, so that the return of the portfolio will be close to the 
average return of 0.5 (35%) + 0.5 (-25%) = 5%.
Figure 10.8 illustrates how volatility declines with the size of the portfolio for type S and 
I firms. Type S firms have only systematic risk. As with earthquake insurance, the volatility 
of the portfolio does not change as the number of firms increases. Type I firms have only 
idiosyncratic risk. As with theft insurance, the risk is diversified as the number of firms 
increases, and volatility declines. As is evident from Figure 10.8, with a large number of 
firms, the risk is essentially eliminated.
Of course, actual firms are not like type S or I firms. Firms are affected by both system-
atic, market-wide risks and firm-specific risks. Figure 10.8 also shows how the volatility 
changes with the size of a portfolio containing the stocks of typical firms. When firms carry 
both types of risk, only the firm-specific risk will be diversified when we combine many 
firms’ stocks into a portfolio. The volatility will therefore decline until only the systematic 
risk, which affects all firms, remains.

This example explains one of the puzzles shown in Figure 10.7. There we saw that the 
S&P 500 had much lower volatility than any of the individual stocks. Now we can see why: 
The individual stocks each contain firm-specific risk, which is eliminated when we com­-
bine them into a large portfolio. Thus, the portfolio as a whole can have lower volatility 
than each of the stocks within it.

Portfolio Volatility
Problem
What is the volatility of the average return of ten type S firms? What is the volatility of the 
­average return of ten type I firms?
Solution
Type S firms have equally likely returns of 40% or -20%. Their expected return is 
1
2 (40%) + 1
2 (-20%) = 10%, so
SD (RS) = 21
2 (0.40 - 0.10)2 + 1
2 (-0.20 - 0.10)2 = 30%
Because all type S firms have high or low returns at the same time, the average return of 
ten type S firms is also 40% or -20%. Thus, it has the same volatility of 30%, as shown in 
Figure 10.8.
Type I firms have equally likely returns of 35% or -25%. Their expected return is 
1
2 (35%) + 1
2 (-25%) = 5%, so
SD (RI) = 21
2 (0.35 - 0.05)2 + 1
2 (-0.25 - 0.05)2 = 30%
Because the returns of type I firms are independent, using Eq. 10.8, the average return of 10 type 
I firms has volatility of 30% , 210 = 9.5%, as shown in Figure 10.8.
No Arbitrage and the Risk Premium
Consider again type I firms, which are affected only by firm-specific risk. Because each 
individual type I firm is risky, should investors expect to earn a risk premium when invest-
ing in type I firms?

372	
Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
In a competitive market, the answer is no. To see why, suppose the expected return of 
type I firms exceeds the risk-free interest rate. Then, by holding a large portfolio of many 
type I firms, investors could diversify the firm-specific risk of these firms and earn a return 
above the risk-free interest rate without taking on any significant risk.
The situation just described is very close to an arbitrage opportunity, which investors 
would find very attractive. They would borrow money at the risk-free interest rate and 
invest it in a large portfolio of type I firms, which offers a higher return with only a tiny 
amount of risk.13 As more investors take advantage of this situation and purchase shares 
of type I firms, the current share prices for type I firms would rise, lowering their expected 
return—recall that the current share price Pt is the denominator when computing the 
stock’s return as in Eq. 10.4. This trading would stop only after the return of type I firms 
equaled the risk-free interest rate. Competition between investors drives the return of type 
I firms down to the risk-free return.
The preceding argument is essentially an application of the Law of One Price: Because 
a large portfolio of type I firms has no risk, it must earn the risk-free interest rate. This no-
arbitrage argument suggests the following more general principle:
The risk premium for diversifiable risk is zero, so investors are not compensated for holding 
firm-specific risk.
We can apply this principle to all stocks and securities. It implies that the risk premium of 
a stock is not affected by its diversifiable, firm-specific risk. If the diversifiable risk of stocks 
were compensated with an additional risk premium, then investors could buy the stocks, 
earn the additional premium, and simultaneously diversify and eliminate the risk. By doing 
so, investors could earn an additional premium without taking on additional risk. This 
opportunity to earn something for nothing would quickly be exploited and eliminated.14
Because investors can eliminate firm-specific risk “for free” by diversifying their portfo-
lios, they will not require a reward or risk premium for holding it. However, diversification 
does not reduce systematic risk: Even holding a large portfolio, an investor will be exposed 
to risks that affect the entire economy and therefore affect all securities. Because investors 
are risk averse, they will demand a risk premium to hold systematic risk; otherwise they 
would be better off selling their stocks and investing in risk-free bonds. Because investors 
can eliminate firm-specific risk for free by diversifying, whereas systematic risk can be elim-
inated only by sacrificing expected returns, it is a security’s systematic risk that determines 
the risk premium investors require to hold it. This fact leads to a second key principle:
The risk premium of a security is determined by its systematic risk and does not depend on 
its diversifiable risk.
This principle implies that a stock’s volatility, which is a measure of total risk (that is, 
systematic risk plus diversifiable risk), is not especially useful in determining the risk pre-
mium that investors will earn. For example, consider again type S and I firms. As calculated 
in Example 10.6, the volatility of a single type S or I firm is 30%. Although both types of 
firms have the same volatility, type S firms have an expected return of 10% and type I firms 
have an expected return of 5%. The difference in expected returns derives from the differ-
ence in the kind of risk each firm bears. Type I firms have only firm-specific risk, which 
does not require a risk premium, so the expected return of 5% for type I firms equals the 
13If investors could actually hold a large enough portfolio and completely diversify all the risk, then this 
would be a true arbitrage opportunity.
14The main thrust of this argument can be found in S. Ross, “The Arbitrage Theory of Capital Asset 
­Pricing,” Journal of Economic Theory 13 (December 1976): 341–360.

risk-free interest rate. Type S firms have only systematic risk. Because investors will require 
compensation for taking on this risk, the expected return of 10% for type S firms provides 
investors with a 5% risk premium above the risk-free interest rate.
We now have an explanation for the second puzzle of Figure  10.7. While volatility 
might be a reasonable measure of risk for a well-diversified portfolio, it is not an appropri-
ate metric for an individual security. Thus, there should be no clear relationship between 
volatility and average returns for individual securities. Consequently, to estimate a secu-
rity’s expected return, we need to find a measure of a security’s systematic risk.
In Chapter 3, we argued that an investment’s risk premium depends on how its returns 
move in relation to the overall economy. In particular, risk-averse investors will demand a pre­- 
mium to invest in securities that will do poorly in bad times (recall, for example, the perfor-
mance of small stocks in Figure 10.1 during the Great Depression). This idea coincides with 
the notion of systematic risk we have defined in this chapter. Economy-wide risk—that is, 
the risk of recessions and booms—is systematic risk that cannot be diversified. Therefore an 
asset that moves with the economy contains systematic risk and so requires a risk premium.

Diversification Benefits During Market Crashes
(i.e., the pink area is about 50% of the total). But as the ­figure 
demonstrates, during the 1987 stock market crash, the 2008 
financial crisis, and the recent Eurozone debt crisis, this frac-
tion fell dramatically, so that only about 20% of the volatility 
of individual stocks could be diversified. The combined effect 
of increased volatility and reduced diversification during the 
2008 financial crisis was so severe that the risk that investors 
care about—market risk—increased seven-fold, from 10% to 
70%, between 2006 and the last quarter of 2008.
Although you are always better off diversifying, it is 
important to keep in mind that the benefits of diversifica-
tion depend on economic conditions. In times of extreme 
crisis, the benefits may go down, making downturns in the 
market particularly painful for investors.
The figure below illustrates the benefits of diversification 
over the last 40 years. The blue graph shows the historical 
volatility of the S&P 500 portfolio (annualized based on 
daily returns each quarter). The pink graph is the average 
volatility of the individual stocks in the portfolio (weighted 
according to the size of each stock). Thus, the pink shaded 
area is idiosyncratic risk—risk that has been diversified away 
by holding the portfolio. The blue area is market risk which 
cannot be diversified.
Market volatility clearly varies, increasing dramatically 
during times of crisis. But notice also that the fraction of risk 
that can be diversified away also varies, and seems to decline 
during times of crisis. For example, since 1970, on average 
about 50% of the volatility of individual stocks is diversifiable

Diversifiable Versus Systematic Risk
Problem
Which of the following risks of a stock are likely to be firm-specific, diversifiable risks, and 
which are likely to be systematic risks? Which risks will affect the risk premium that investors 
will demand?
	
a.	 The risk that the founder and CEO retires
	
b.	 The risk that oil prices rise, increasing production costs
	
c.	 The risk that a product design is faulty and the product must be recalled
	
d.	 The risk that the economy slows, reducing demand for the firm’s products
Solution
Because oil prices and the health of the economy affect all stocks, risks (b) and (d) are system-
atic risks. These risks are not diversified in a large portfolio, and so will affect the risk premium 
that investors require to invest in a stock. Risks (a) and (c) are firm-specific risks, and so are 
­diversifiable. While these risks should be considered when estimating a firm’s future cash flows, 
they will not affect the risk premium that investors will require and, therefore, will not affect a 
firm’s cost of capital.
A Fallacy of Long-Run Diversification
We have seen that investors can greatly reduce their risk by 
dividing their investment dollars over many different invest-
ments, eliminating the diversifiable risk in their portfolios. 
Does the same logic apply over time? That is, by investing 
for many years, can we also diversify the risk we face during 
any particular year? In the long run, does risk still matter?
Eq. 10.8 tells us that if returns each year are indepen-
dent, the volatility of the average annual return declines with 
the number of years that we invest. Of course, as long-term 
investors, we don’t care about the volatility of our average 
return; instead, we care about the volatility of our cumula-
tive return over the period. This volatility grows with the 
investment horizon, as illustrated in the following example.
In 1925, large U.S. stocks increased in value by about 
30%. In fact, a $77 investment at the start of 1925 would have 
grown to $77 * 1.30 = $100 by the end of the year. Notice 
from Figure 10.1 that a $100 investment in the S&P 500 
from 1926 onward would have grown to about $480,560 by 
the start of 2015. But suppose instead stocks had dropped by 
35% in 1925. Then, the initial $77 invested would be worth 
only $77 * (1 - 35%) = $50 at the beginning of 1926. If 
returns from then on were unchanged, the investment would 
be worth half as much in 2015, or $240,280. Thus, despite 
the long horizon, the difference in the first year’s return still 
has a significant effect on the final payoff.
The financial crisis in 2008 brought home the reality of 
this fallacy to many investors. Consider for example, a long-
term investor who invested $100 in small stocks in 1925. 
If her investment horizon was 81 years (end of 2006), she 
would have a little over $2 million. If instead her investment 
horizon was 83 years (end of 2008) her portfolio would have 
dropped by over 50% to just $1 million. Again, having a 
longer horizon did not reduce risk!
More generally, if returns are independent over time so 
that future returns are not affected by past returns, then any 
change in the value of our portfolio today will translate into 
the same percentage change in the value of our portfolio in 
the future, and there is no diversification over time. The 
only way the length of the time horizon can reduce risk is if 
a below-average return today implies that returns are more 
likely to be above average in the future (and vice versa), a 
phenomenon sometimes referred to as mean reversion. Mean 
reversion implies that past low returns can be used to predict 
future high returns in the stock market.
For short horizons of a few years, there is no evidence 
of mean reversion in the stock market. For longer horizons, 
there is some evidence of mean reversion historically, but it is 
not clear how reliable this evidence is (there are not enough 
decades of accurate stock market data available) or whether 
the pattern will continue. Even if there is long-run mean 
reversion in stock returns, a buy-and-hold diversification 
strategy is still not optimal: Because mean reversion implies 
that past returns can be used to predict future returns, you 
should invest more in stocks when returns are predicted to 
be high, and invest less when they are predicted to be low. 
This strategy is very different from the diversification we 
achieve by holding many stocks, where we cannot predict 
which stocks will have good or bad firm-specific shocks.
Common Mistake

	
10.7	 Measuring Systematic Risk
As we have discussed, investors can eliminate the firm-specific risk in their investments by 
diversifying their portfolio. Thus, when evaluating the risk of an investment, an investor 
will care about its systematic risk, which cannot be eliminated through diversification. In 
exchange for bearing systematic risk, investors want to be compensated by earning a higher 
return. So, to determine the additional return, or risk premium, investors will require to 
undertake an investment, we first need to measure the investment’s systematic risk.
Identifying Systematic Risk: The Market Portfolio
To measure the systematic risk of a stock, we must determine how much of the variability 
of its return is due to systematic, market-wide risks versus diversifiable, firm-specific risks. 
That is, we would like to know how sensitive the stock is to systematic shocks that affect 
the economy as a whole.
To determine how sensitive a stock’s return is to interest rate changes, for example, 
we would look at how much the return tends to change on average for each 1% change 
in interest rates. Similarly, to determine how sensitive a stock’s return is to oil prices, we 
would examine the average change in the return for each 1% change in oil prices. In the 
same way, to determine how sensitive a stock is to systematic risk, we can look at the aver-
age change in its return for each 1% change in the return of a portfolio that fluctuates solely 
due to systematic risk.
Thus, the first step to measuring systematic risk is finding a portfolio that contains only 
systematic risk. Changes in the price of this portfolio will correspond to systematic shocks 
to the economy. We call such a portfolio an efficient portfolio. An efficient portfolio 
cannot be diversified further—that is, there is no way to reduce the risk of the portfolio 
without lowering its expected return. How can we identify such a portfolio?
As we will see over the next few chapters, the best way to identify an efficient portfo-
lio is one of the key questions in modern finance. Because diversification improves with 
the number of stocks held in a portfolio, an efficient portfolio should be a large portfolio 
containing many different stocks. Thus, a natural candidate for an efficient portfolio is 
the market portfolio, which is a portfolio of all stocks and securities traded in the capital 
markets. Because it is difficult to find data for the returns of many bonds and small stocks, 
it is common in practice to use the S&P 500 portfolio as an approximation for the market 
portfolio, under the assumption that the S&P 500 is large enough to be essentially fully 
diversified.
Sensitivity to Systematic Risk: Beta
If we assume that the market portfolio (or the S&P 500) is efficient, then changes in the 
value of the market portfolio represent systematic shocks to the economy. We can then 
measure the systematic risk of a security by calculating the sensitivity of the security’s return 
to the return of the market portfolio, known as the beta  (b) of the security. More precisely,
The beta of a security is the expected % change in its return given a 1% change in the 
return of the market portfolio.

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
Real-Firm Betas.  We will look at statistical techniques for estimating beta from historical 
stock returns in Chapter 12. There we will see that we can estimate beta reasonably accu-
rately using just a few years of data (which was not the case for expected returns, as we saw 
in Example 10.4). Using the S&P 500 to represent the market’s return, Table 10.6 shows 
the betas of several stocks during 2010–2015. As shown in the table, each 1% change 
in the return of the market during this period led, on average, to a 1.21% change in the 
return for Yahoo! but only a 0.52% change in the return for Coca-Cola.
Interpreting Betas.  Beta measures the sensitivity of a security to market-wide risk ­factors. 
For a stock, this value is related to how sensitive its underlying revenues and cash flows 
are to general economic conditions. The average beta of a stock in the market is about 1; 
that is, the average stock price tends to move about 1% for each 1% move in the overall 
market. Stocks in cyclical industries, in which revenues and profits vary greatly over the 
business cycle, are likely to be more sensitive to systematic risk and have betas that exceed 
1, whereas stocks of non-cyclical firms tend to have betas that are less than 1.
For example, notice the relatively low betas of PG&E (a utility company), Johnson & 
Johnson (pharmaceuticals), General Mills and Hershey (food processing), and Amgen (bio-
technology). Utilities tend to be stable and highly regulated, and thus are insensitive to fluctu-
ations in the overall market. Drug and food companies are also very insensitive—the demand 
for their products appears to be unrelated to the booms and busts of the economy as a whole.
At the other extreme, technology stocks tend to have higher betas; consider Oracle, 
Hewlett-Packard, Netgear, Autodesk, and Advanced Micro Devices. Shocks in the econ-
omy have an amplified impact on these stocks: When the market as a whole is up, Advanced 
Micro Devices’ (AMD)’s stock tends to rise more than twice as much; but when the market 
stumbles, it tends to fall more than twice as far. Note also the high beta of luxury retail-
ers Coach and Tiffany & Co., compared with the much lower beta of Walmart; presum-
ably their sales respond very differently to economic booms and busts. Finally, we see that 
highly levered firms in cyclical industries, such as General Motors and U.S. Steel, tend to 
have high betas reflecting their sensitivity to economic conditions.
Example 10.8
Estimating Beta
Problem
Suppose the market portfolio tends to increase by 47% when the economy is strong and decline 
by 25% when the economy is weak. What is the beta of a type S firm whose return is 40% on 
average when the economy is strong and -20% when the economy is weak? What is the beta of 
a type I firm that bears only idiosyncratic, firm-specific risk?
Solution
The systematic risk of the strength of the economy produces a 47% - (-25%) = 72% change 
in the return of the market portfolio. The type S firm’s return changes by 40% - (-20%) = 60% 
on average. Thus the firm’s beta is bS = 60%/72% = 0.833. That is, each 1% change in the 
return of the market portfolio leads to a 0.833% change in the type S firm’s return on average.
The return of a type I firm has only firm-specific risk, however, and so is not affected by the 
strength of the economy. Its return is affected only by factors specific to the firm. Because it will 
have the same expected return, whether the economy is strong or weak, bI = 0%/72% = 0.

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
	
10.8	 Beta and the Cost of Capital
Throughout this text, we have emphasized that financial managers should evaluate an 
investment opportunity based on its cost of capital, which is the expected return avail-
able on alternative investments in the market with comparable risk and term. For risky 
investments, this cost of capital corresponds to the risk-free interest rate, plus an appro-
priate risk premium. Now that we can measure the systematic risk of an investment 
according to its beta, we are in a position to estimate the risk premium investors will 
require.
Estimating the Risk Premium
Before we can estimate the risk premium of an individual stock, we need a way to assess 
investors’ appetite for risk. The size of the risk premium investors will require to make a 
risky investment depends upon their risk aversion. Rather than attempt to measure this 
risk aversion directly, we can measure it indirectly by looking at the risk premium inves-
tors’ demand for investing in systematic, or market, risk.
The Market Risk Premium.  We can calibrate investors’ appetite for market risk from the 
market portfolio. The risk premium investors earn by holding market risk is the difference 
between the market portfolio’s expected return and the risk-free interest rate:
	
Market Risk Premium = E[RMkt] - rf 
(10.10)
For example, if the risk-free rate is 5% and the expected return of the market portfolio 
is 11%, the market risk premium is 6%. In the same way that the market interest rate 
reflects investors’ patience and determines the time value of money, the market risk pre-
mium reflects investors’ risk tolerance and determines the market price of risk in the 
economy.
Adjusting for Beta.  The market risk premium is the reward investors expect to earn for 
holding a portfolio with a beta of 1—the market portfolio itself. Consider an investment 
opportunity with a beta of 2. This investment carries twice as much systematic risk as an 
investment in the market portfolio. That is, for each dollar we invest in the opportunity, 
we could invest twice that amount in the market portfolio and be exposed to exactly the 
same amount of systematic risk. Because it has twice as much systematic risk, investors will 
require twice the risk premium to invest in an opportunity with a beta of 2.
Beta Versus Volatility
Recall that beta differs from volatility. Volatility measures 
total risk—that is, both market and firm-specific risks—
so that there is no necessary relationship between volatility 
and beta. For example, from 2010 to 2015, the stocks of 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals and networking equipment maker 
Netgear had similar volatility (about 12% per month). 
­Vertex, however, had a much lower beta (0.6 versus about 
2 for Netgear). While drug companies face a great deal 
of risk related to the development and approval of new 
drugs, this risk is unrelated to the rest of the economy. And 
though health care expenditures do vary a little with the 
state of the economy, they vary much less than expendi-
tures on ­technology. Thus, while their volatilities are simi-
lar, much more of the risk of Vertex’s stock is diversifiable 
risk, whereas Netgear’s stock has a much greater proportion 
of systematic risk.
Common Mistake

To summarize, we can use the beta of the investment to determine the scale of the 
investment in the market portfolio that has equivalent systematic risk. Thus, to compen-
sate investors for the time value of their money as well as the systematic risk they are 
bearing, the cost of capital rI for an investment with beta bI should satisfy the following 
formula:
Estimating the Cost of Capital of an Investment from Its Beta
	
rI = Risk@Free Interest Rate + bI * Market Risk Premium
	
= rf + bI * (E[RMkt] - rf)
(10.11)
As an example, let’s consider Sotheby’s (BID) and Procter & Gamble (PG) stocks, using 
the beta estimates in Table 10.6. According to Eq. 10.11, if the market risk premium is 6% 
and the risk-free interest rate is 5%, the equity cost of capital for each of these firms is
rBID = 5% + 2.48 * 6% = 19.9%
rPG = 5% + 0.52 * 6% = 8.1%
Thus, the difference in the average returns of these two stocks that we reported in the 
introduction of this chapter is not so surprising. Investors in Sotheby’s require a much 
higher return on average to compensate them for Sotheby’s much higher systematic risk.
	
10.8  Beta and the Cost of Capital	
379
Example 10.9
Expected Returns and Beta
Problem
Suppose the risk-free rate is 5% and the economy is equally likely to be strong or weak. Use 
Eq. 10.11 to determine the cost of capital for the type S firms considered in Example 10.8. How 
does this cost of capital compare with the expected return for these firms?
Solution
If the economy is equally likely to be strong or weak, the expected return of the market is  
E[RMkt] =  1
2 (0.47) +  1
2 (-0.25) =  11%, and the market risk premium is E[RMkt] -  rf =  
11% - 5% =  6%. Given the beta of 0.833 for type S firms that we calculated in Example 10.8, 
the estimate of the cost of capital for type S firms from Eq. 10.11 is
rs = rf + bs * (E[RMkt] - rf ) = 5% + 0.833 * (11% - 5%) = 10%
This matches their expected return: 1
2 (40%) + 1
2 (-20%) = 10%. Thus, investors who hold 
these stocks can expect a return that appropriately compensates them for the systematic risk they 
are bearing by holding them (as we should expect in a competitive market).
What happens if a stock has a negative beta? According to Eq. 10.11, such a stock would 
have a negative risk premium—it would have an expected return below the risk-free rate. 
While this might seem unreasonable at first, note that stock with a negative beta will tend 
to do well when times are bad, so owning it will provide insurance against the systematic 
risk of other stocks in the portfolio. (For an example of such a security, see Example 3A.1 in 
Chapter 3.) Risk-averse investors are willing to pay for this insurance by accepting a return 
below the risk-free interest rate.

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
The Capital Asset Pricing Model
Equation 10.11, for estimating the cost of capital, is often referred to as the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model (CAPM),15 the most important method for estimating the cost of capital 
that is used in practice. In this chapter, we have provided an intuitive justification of the 
CAPM, and its use of the market portfolio as the benchmark for systematic risk. We pro-
vide a more complete development of the model and its assumptions in Chapter 11, where 
we also detail the portfolio optimization process used by professional fund managers. 
Then, in Chapter 12, we look at the practicalities of implementing the CAPM, and develop 
statistical tools for estimating the betas of individual stocks, together with methods for 
estimating the beta and cost of capital of projects within these firms. Finally, in Chapter 13 
we look at the empirical evidence for (and against) the CAPM, both as a model of investor 
behavior and as forecast of expected returns, and introduce some proposed extensions to 
the CAPM.
15The CAPM was first developed independently by William Sharpe, Jack Treynor, John Lintner, and 
Jan Mossin. See J. Lintner “The Valuation of Risk Assets and the Selection of Risky Investments in Stock 
Portfolios and Capital Budgets,” Review of Economics and Statistics 47 (1965): 13–37; W. Sharpe, “Capital 
Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium Under Conditions of Risk,” Journal of Finance 19 (1964): 
425–442; J. Treynor, “Toward a Theory of the Market Value of Risky Assets” (1961); and J. Mossin 
“Equilibrium in a Capital Asset Market,” Econometrica, 34 (1966): 768–783.

10.1  Risk and Return: Insights from 89 Years of Investor History
	
n	 Historically, over long horizons, investments in stocks have outperformed investments in bonds.
	
n	 Investing in stocks has also been much riskier than investing in bonds historically. Even over 
a horizon of 5 years, there have been many occasions in the past that stocks have substantially 
underperformed bonds.
10.2  Common Measures of Risk and Return
	
n	 A probability distribution summarizes information about possible different returns and their 
likelihood of occurring.
n	 The expected, or mean, return is the return we expect to earn on average:
	
Expected Return = E [R ] = aR pR * R
(10.1)
n	 The variance or standard deviation measures the variability of the returns:
	
Var (R ) = E[(R - E[R ])2] = aR pR * (R - E[R ])2
	
SD(R ) = 2Var (R )
(10.2)
n	 The standard deviation of a return is also called its volatility.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.

10.3  Historical Returns of Stocks and Bonds
	
n	 The realized or total return for an investment is the total of the dividend yield and the capital 
gain rate.
n	 Using the empirical distribution of realized returns, we can estimate the expected return and 
variance of the distribution of returns by calculating the average annual return and variance 
of realized returns:
	
R = 1
T
 (R1 + R2 + g + RT ) = 1
T a
T
t =1
Rt
(10.6)
	
Var (R ) =
1
T - 1 a
T
t =1
(Rt - R )2
(10.7)
n	 The square root of the estimated variance is an estimate of the volatility of returns.
n	 Because a security’s historical average return is only an estimate of its true expected return, 
we use the standard error of the estimate to gauge the amount of estimation error:
	
SD (Average of Independent, Identical Risks) =
SD (Individual Risk)
2Number of Observations

(10.8)
10.4  The Historical Trade-Off Between Risk and Return
	
n	 Comparing historical data for large portfolios, small stocks have had higher volatility and higher 
average returns than large stocks, which have had higher volatility and higher average returns 
than bonds.
	
n	 There is no clear relationship between the volatility and return of individual stocks.
n	 Larger stocks tend to have lower overall volatility, but even the largest stocks are typically 
more risky than a portfolio of large stocks.
n	 All stocks seem to have higher risk and lower returns than would be predicted based on 
extrapolation of data for large portfolios.
10.5  Common Versus Independent Risk
	
n	 The total risk of a security represents both idiosyncratic risk and systematic risk.
n	 Variation in a stock’s return due to firm-specific news is called idiosyncratic risk. This type of 
risk is also called firm-specific, unique, or diversifiable risk. It is risk that is independent of 
other shocks in the economy.
n	 Systematic risk, also called market or undiversifiable risk, is risk due to market-wide news 
that affects all stocks simultaneously. It is risk that is common to all stocks.
10.6  Diversification in Stock Portfolios
	
n	 Diversification eliminates idiosyncratic risk but does not eliminate systematic risk.
n	 Because investors can eliminate idiosyncratic risk, they do not require a risk premium for 
taking it on.
n	 Because investors cannot eliminate systematic risk, they must be compensated for holding it. 
As a consequence, the risk premium for a stock depends on the amount of its systematic risk 
rather than its total risk.
10.7  Measuring Systematic Risk
	
n	 An efficient portfolio contains only systematic risk and cannot be diversified further—that is, 
there is no way to reduce the risk of the portfolio without lowering its expected return.
	
n	 The market portfolio contains all shares of all stocks and securities in the market. The market 
portfolio is often assumed to be efficient.
	
n	 If the market portfolio is efficient, we can measure the systematic risk of a security by its beta (b). 
The beta of a security is the sensitivity of the security’s return to the return of the overall market.

Chapter 10  Capital Markets and the Pricing of Risk
10.8  Beta and the Cost of Capital
	
n	 The market risk premium is the expected excess return of the market portfolio:
	
Market Risk Premium = E [RMkt] - rf 	
(10.10)
	
	 It reflects investors’ overall risk tolerance and represents the market price of risk in the economy.
	
n	 The cost of capital for a risky investment equals the risk-free rate plus a risk premium. The 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) states that the risk premium equals the investment’s beta 
times the market risk premium:
	
rI = rf + bI * (E[RMkt] - rf )

Diversification in Stock Portfolios
	
22.	 Consider the following two, completely separate, economies. The expected return and volatility 
of all stocks in both economies is the same. In the first economy, all stocks move together—in 
good times all prices rise together and in bad times they all fall together. In the second economy, 
stock returns are independent—one stock increasing in price has no effect on the prices of other 
stocks. Assuming you are risk-averse and you could choose one of the two economies in which 
to invest, which one would you choose? Explain.
	
23.	 Consider an economy with two types of firms, S and I. S firms all move together. I firms move 
independently. For both types of firms, there is a 70% probability that the firms will have a 7% 
return and a 30% probability that the firms will have a -18% return. What is the volatility 
(standard deviation) of a portfolio that consists of an equal investment in 35 firms of (a) type S 
and (b) type I?
	
*24.	 Using the data in Problem 23, plot the volatility as a function of the number of firms in the two

Data Case

Data Case
Today is April 30, 2015, and you have just started your new job with a financial planning firm. In 
addition to studying for all your license exams, you have been asked to review a portion of a client’s 
stock portfolio to determine the risk/return profiles of 12 stocks in the portfolio. Unfortunately, 
your small firm cannot afford the expensive databases that would provide all this information with a 
few simple keystrokes, but that’s why they hired you. Specifically, you have been asked to determine 
the monthly average returns and standard deviations for the 12 stocks for the past five years. In the 
following chapters, you will be asked to do more extensive analyses on these same stocks.
The stocks (with their symbols in parentheses) are:
Archer Daniels Midland (ADM)
Boeing (BA)
Caterpillar (CAT)
Deere & Co. (DE)
General Mills, Inc. (GIS)
eBay (EBAY)
Hershey (HSY)
International Business Machines 
­Corporation (IBM)
JPMorgan Chase & Co. (⁜渠屮JPM)
Microsoft (MSFT)
Procter and Gamble (PG)
Walmart (WMT)
	
1.	 Collect price information for each stock from Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) as follows:
a.	 Enter the stock symbol. On the page for that stock, click “Historical Prices” on the left side of 
the page.
b.	 Enter the “start date” as April 30, 2010 and the “end date” as April 30, 2015 to cover the five-
year period. Make sure you click “monthly” next to the date; the closing prices reported by 
Yahoo! will then be for the last day of each month.
c.	 After hitting “Get Prices,” scroll to the bottom of the first page and click “Download to 
Spreadsheet.” If you are asked if you want to open or save the file, click open.
d.	Copy the entire spreadsheet, open Excel, and paste the Web data into a spreadsheet. Delete all 
the columns except the date and the adjusted close (the first and last columns).
e.	 Keep the Excel file open and go back to the Yahoo! Finance Web page and hit the back 
­button. If you are asked if you want to save the data, click no.
f.	 When you return to the prices page, enter the next stock symbol and hit “Get Prices” again. 
Do not change the dates or frequency, but make sure you have the same dates for all the stocks 
you will download. Again, click “Download to Spreadsheet” and then open the file. Copy 
the last column, “Adj. Close,” paste it into the Excel file and change “Adj. Close” to the stock 
symbol. Make sure that the first and last prices are in the same rows as the first stock.
g.	 Repeat these steps for the remaining 10 stocks, pasting each closing price right next to the other 
stocks, again making sure that the correct prices on the correct dates all appear on the same rows.
	
2.	 Convert these prices to monthly returns as the percentage change in the monthly prices. (Hint : Cre-
ate a separate worksheet within the Excel file.) Note that to compute a return for each month, you 
need a beginning and ending price, so you will not be able to compute the return for the first month.
	
3.	 Compute the mean monthly returns and standard deviations for the monthly returns of each of 
the stocks.16 Convert the monthly statistics to annual statistics for easier interpretation (multiply 
the mean monthly return by 12, and multiply the monthly standard deviation by 212).
16In Eq. 10.4, we showed how to compute returns with stock price and dividend data. The “adjusted 
close” series from Yahoo! Finance is already adjusted for dividends and splits, so we may compute returns 
based on the percentage change in monthly adjusted prices.

	
4.	 Add a column in your Excel worksheet with the average return across stocks for each month. This 
is the monthly return to an equally weighted portfolio of these 12 stocks. Compute the mean 
and standard deviation of monthly returns for the equally weighted portfolio. Double check that 
the average return on this equally weighted portfolio is equal to the average return of all of the 
individual stocks. Convert these monthly statistics to annual statistics (as described in Step 3) for 
interpretation.
	
5.	 Using the annual statistics, create an Excel plot with standard deviation (volatility) on the x-axis 
and average return on the y-axis as follows:
a.	 Create three columns on your spreadsheet with the statistics you created in Questions 3 and 
4 for each of the individual stocks and the equally weighted portfolio. The first column will 
have the ticker, the second will have annual standard deviation, and the third will have the 
annual mean return.
b.	 Highlight the data in the last two columns (standard deviation and mean), choose 
Insert 7 Chart 7XY Scatter Plot. Complete the chart wizard to finish the plot.
	
6.	 What do you notice about the average of the volatilities of the individual stocks, compared to the 
volatility of the equally weighted portfolio?

Optimal Portfolio Choice 
and the Capital Asset 
Pricing Model
IN thIS Chapter, We BUILD ON the IDeaS We INtrODUCeD IN 
Chapter 10 to explain how an investor can choose an efficient portfolio. In particular, 
we will demonstrate how to find the optimal portfolio for an investor who wants to earn 
the highest possible return given the level of volatility he or she is willing to accept 
by developing the statistical techniques of mean-variance portfolio optimization. Both 
elegant and practical, these techniques are used routinely by professional investors, 
money managers, and financial institutions. We then introduce the assumptions of the 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), the most important model of the relationship 
between risk and return. Under these assumptions, the efficient portfolio is the market 
portfolio of all stocks and securities. As a result, the expected return of any security 
depends upon its beta with the market portfolio.
In Chapter 10, we explained how to calculate the expected return and volatility of 
a single stock. To find the efficient portfolio, we must understand how to do the same 
thing for a portfolio of stocks. We begin this chapter by explaining how to calculate 
the expected return and volatility of a portfolio. With these statistical tools in hand, 
we then describe how an investor can create an efficient portfolio out of individual 
stocks, and consider the implications, if all investors attempt to do so, for an invest-
ment’s expected return and cost of capital.
In our exploration of these concepts, we take the perspective of a stock market 
investor. These concepts, however, are also important for a corporate financial manager. 
After all, financial managers are also investors, investing money on behalf of their share-
holders. When a company makes a new investment, financial managers must ensure that 
the investment has a positive NPV. Doing so requires knowing the cost of capital of the 
investment opportunity and, as we shall see in the next chapter, the CAPM is the main 
method used by most major corporations to calculate the cost of capital.

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
	
11.1	 The Expected Return of a Portfolio
To find an optimal portfolio, we need a method to define a portfolio and analyze its return. 
We can describe a portfolio by its portfolio weights, the fraction of the total investment in 
the portfolio held in each individual investment in the portfolio:
	
xi = Value of investment i
Total value of portfolio	
(11.1)
These portfolio weights add up to 1 (that is, ixi = 1), so that they represent the way we 
have divided our money between the different individual investments in the portfolio.
As an example, consider a portfolio with 200 shares of Dolby Laboratories worth 
$30 per share and 100 shares of Coca-Cola worth $40 per share. The total value of the 
portfolio is 200 * $30 + 100 * $40 = $10,000, and the corresponding portfolio weights 
xD and xC are
xD = 200 * $30
$10,000 = 60%,  xC = 100 * $40
$10,000 = 40%
Given the portfolio weights, we can calculate the return on the portfolio. Suppose 
x1, c , xn are the portfolio weights of the n investments in a portfolio, and these invest-
ments have returns R1, c , Rn. Then the return on the portfolio, RP, is the weighted 
average of the returns on the investments in the portfolio, where the weights correspond to 
portfolio weights:
	
RP = x1R1 + x2R2 + g + xnRn = ai xi Ri	
(11.2)
The return of a portfolio is straightforward to compute if we know the returns of the 
individual stocks and the portfolio weights.
Example 11.1
Calculating Portfolio Returns
Problem
Suppose you buy 200 shares of Dolby Laboratories at $30 per share and 100 shares of Coca-Cola 
stock at $40 per share. If Dolby’s share price goes up to $36 and Coca-Cola’s falls to $38, what is 
the new value of the portfolio, and what return did it earn? Show that Eq. 11.2 holds. After the 
price change, what are the new portfolio weights?
Solution
The new value of the portfolio is 200 * $36 + 100 * $38 = $11,000, for a gain of $1000 or 
a 10% return on your $10,000 investment. Dolby’s return was 36/30 - 1 = 20%, and Coca-
Cola’s was 38/40 - 1 = -5%. Given the initial portfolio weights of 60% Dolby’s and 40% 
Coca-Cola, we can also compute the portfolio’s return from Eq. 11.2:
RP = xDRD + xC RC = 0.6 * (20%) + 0.4 * (-5%) = 10%
After the price change, the new portfolio weights are
xD = 200 * $36
$11,000 = 65.45%,  xC = 100 * $38
$11,000 = 34.55%
Without trading, the weights increase for those stocks whose returns exceed the portfolio’s 
return.

Equation 11.2 also allows us to compute the expected return of a portfolio. Using the 
facts that the expectation of a sum is just the sum of the expectations and that the expecta-
tion of a known multiple is just the multiple of its expectation, we arrive at the following 
formula for a portfolio’s expected return:
	
E[RP] = E 3ai xiRi4 = ai E[xiRi] = ai xiE[Ri]	
(11.3)
That is, the expected return of a portfolio is simply the weighted average of the expected 
returns of the investments within it, using the portfolio weights.
	
11.2	 The Volatility of a Two-Stock Portfolio
As we explained in Chapter 10, combining stocks in a portfolio eliminates some of their risk 
through diversification. The amount of risk that will remain depends on the degree to which 
the stocks are exposed to common risks. In this section, we describe the statistical tools that we 
can use to quantify the risk stocks have in common and determine the volatility of a portfolio.
Combining Risks
Let’s begin with a simple example of how risk changes when stocks are combined in a 
portfolio. Table 11.1 shows returns for three hypothetical stocks, along with their ­average 
returns and volatilities. While the three stocks have the same volatility and average return,

Problem
Suppose you invest $10,000 in Ford stock, and $30,000 in Tyco International stock. You expect 
a return of 10% for Ford and 16% for Tyco. What is your portfolio’s expected return?
Solution
You invested $40,000 in total, so your portfolio weights are 10,000/40,000 = 0.25 in Ford and 
30,000/40,000 = 0.75 in Tyco. Therefore, your portfolio’s expected return is
E [RP] = xFE [RF ] + xTE [RT ] = 0.25 * 10% + 0.75 * 16% = 14.5%

the pattern of their returns differs. When the airline stocks performed well, the oil stock 
tended to do poorly (see 2010–2011), and when the airlines did poorly, the oil stock 
tended to do well (2013–2014).
Table 11.1 also shows the returns for two portfolios of the stocks. The first portfolio 
consists of equal investments in the two airlines, North Air and West Air. The second 
portfolio includes equal investments in West Air and Tex Oil. The average return of both 
portfolios is equal to the average return of the stocks, consistent with Eq. 11.3. However, 
their volatilities—12.1% and 5.1%—are very different from the individual stocks and 
from each other.
This example demonstrates two important phenomena. First, by combining stocks into 
a portfolio, we reduce risk through diversification. Because the prices of the stocks do not 
move identically, some of the risk is averaged out in a portfolio. As a result, both portfolios 
have lower risk than the individual stocks. Second, the amount of risk that is eliminated in 
a portfolio depends on the degree to which the stocks face common risks and their prices 
move together. Because the two airline stocks tend to perform well or poorly at the same 
time, the portfolio of airline stocks has a volatility that is only slightly lower than that of 
the individual stocks. The airline and oil stocks, by contrast, do not move together; indeed, 
they tend to move in opposite directions. As a result, additional risk is canceled out, mak-
ing that portfolio much less risky. This benefit of diversification is obtained costlessly—
without any reduction in the average return.
Determining Covariance and Correlation
To find the risk of a portfolio, we need to know more than the risk and return of the 
­component stocks: We need to know the degree to which the stocks face common risks 
and their returns move together. In this section, we introduce two statistical measures, 
covariance and correlation, that allow us to measure the co-movement of returns.
Covariance.  Covariance is the expected product of the deviations of two returns from 
their means. The covariance between returns Ri and Rj is:
Covariance between Returns Ri and Rj
	
Cov(Ri, Rj) = E[(Ri - E[Ri])(Rj - E[Rj])]
(11.4)
When estimating the covariance from historical data, we use the formula1
Estimate of the Covariance from Historical Data
	
Cov(Ri, Rj) =
1
T - 1 a t(Ri, t - Ri)(Rj, t - Rj)
(11.5)
Intuitively, if two stocks move together, their returns will tend to be above or below 
average at the same time, and the covariance will be positive. If the stocks move in oppo-
site directions, one will tend to be above average when the other is below average, and the 
covariance will be negative.
Correlation.  While the sign of the covariance is easy to interpret, its magnitude is not. 
It will be larger if the stocks are more volatile (and so have larger deviations from their 
expected returns), and it will be larger the more closely the stocks move in relation to each 
1As with Eq. 10.7 for historical volatility, we divide by T - 1 rather than by T to make up for the fact that 
we have used the data to compute the average returns R, eliminating a degree of freedom.

other. In order to control for the volatility of each stock and quantify the strength of the 
relationship between them, we can calculate the correlation between two stock returns, 
defined as the covariance of the returns divided by the standard deviation of each return:
	
Corr(Ri, Rj) =
Cov(Ri, Rj )
SD(Ri ) SD(Rj )
(11.6)
The correlation between two stocks has the same sign as their covariance, so it has a 
­similar interpretation. Dividing by the volatilities ensures that correlation is always between 
-1 and +1, which allows us to gauge the strength of the relationship between the stocks. 
As Figure 11.1 shows, correlation is a barometer of the degree to which the returns share 
common risk and tend to move together. The closer the correlation is to +1, the more 
the returns tend to move together as a result of common risk. When the correlation (and 
thus the covariance) equals 0, the returns are uncorrelated; that is, they have no tendency to 
move either together or in opposition to one another. Independent risks are uncorrelated. 
Finally, the closer the correlation is to -1, the more the returns tend to move in opposite 
directions.
Example 11.3
The Covariance and Correlation of a Stock with Itself
Problem
What are the covariance and the correlation of a stock’s return with itself?
Solution
Let Rs be the stock’s return. From the definition of the covariance,
 Cov(Rs, Rs) = E [(Rs - E [Rs])(Rs - E[Rs])] = E[(Rs - E[Rs])2]
 = Var (Rs)
where the last equation follows from the definition of the variance. That is, the covariance of a 
stock with itself is simply its variance. Then,
Corr (R s, Rs ) =
Cov (Rs,Rs)
SD(Rs ) SD(Rs) = Var (Rs)
SD(Rs )2 = 1
where the last equation follows from the definition of the standard deviation. That is, a stock’s 
return is perfectly positively correlated with itself, as it always moves together with itself in 
­perfect synchrony.

Correlation measures how returns

It is between +1 (returns always

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
Example 11.4
Computing the Covariance and Correlation
Problem
Using the data in Table 11.1, what are the covariance and the correlation between North Air and 
West Air? Between West Air and Tex Oil?
Solution
Given the returns in Table 11.1, we deduct the mean return (10%) from each and compute 
the product of these deviations between the pairs of stocks. We then sum them and divide by 
T - 1 = 5 to compute the covariance, as in Table 11.2.
From the table, we see that North Air and West Air have a positive covariance, indicating a 
tendency to move together, whereas West Air and Tex Oil have a negative covariance, indicating a 
tendency to move oppositely. We can assess the strength of these tendencies from the correlation, 
obtained by dividing the covariance by the standard deviation of each stock (13.4%). The corre-
lation for North Air and West Air is 62.4%; the correlation for West Air and Tex Oil is -71.3%.
Computing Variance, Covariance, and Correlation in Excel
The computer spreadsheet program Excel does not ­compute 
the standard deviation, variance, covariance, and ­correlation 
consistently. The Excel functions STDEV and VAR ­correctly 
use Eq. 10.7 to estimate the standard deviation and vari-
ance from historical data. But the Excel function COVAR 
does not use Eq. 11.5; instead, Excel divides by T instead of 
T - 1. Therefore, to estimate the covariance from a sample 
of historical returns using COVAR, you must correct the 
inconsistency by multiplying by the number of data points 
and dividing by the number of data points minus one; i.e., 
COVAR*T/(T - 1). Alternatively, you can use the ­function 
CORREL to compute the correlation, and then estimate the 
covariance by multiplying the correlation by the standard 
deviation of each return. Finally, Excel 2010 introduced a 
new function, COVARIANCE.S, that correctly estimates 
the covariance from a historical sample.

When will stock returns be highly correlated with each other? Stock returns will tend 
to move together if they are affected similarly by economic events. Thus, stocks in the 
same industry tend to have more highly correlated returns than stocks in different indus-
tries. This tendency is illustrated in Table 11.3, which shows the volatility of individual 
stock returns and the correlation between them for several common stocks. Consider, for 
example, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. The returns of these two technology stocks have 
a higher correlation with each other (39%) than with any of the non-technology stocks 
(35% or lower). The same pattern holds for the airline and food-processing stocks—their 
returns are most highly correlated with the other firm in their industry, and much less 
correlated with those outside their industry. General Mills and Kellogg have the lowest cor-
relation with each of the other stocks; indeed, Kellogg and Microsoft have a correlation of 
only 5%, suggesting that these two firms are subject to essentially uncorrelated risks. Note, 
however, that all of the correlations are positive, illustrating the general tendency of stocks 
to move together.

Example 11.5
Computing the Covariance from the Correlation
Problem
Using the data from Table 11.3, what is the covariance between Microsoft and HP?
Solution
We can rewrite Eq. 11.6 to solve for the covariance:
Cov (RM, RHP) = Corr (RM, RHP)SD(RM)SD(RHP)
= (0.39)(0.33)(0.37) = 0.0476
Computing a Portfolio’s Variance and Volatility
We now have the tools to compute the variance of a portfolio. For a two-stock portfolio 
with RP = x1R1 + x2R2,
Var(RP) = Cov(RP, RP)
= Cov(x1R1 + x2R2, x1R1 + x2R2)
= x1x1Cov(R1,R1) + x1x2Cov(R1,R2) + x2x1Cov(R2,R1) + x2x2Cov(R2,R2)	 (11.7)

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
In the last line of Eq. 11.7, we use the fact that, as with expectations, we can change the order 
of the covariance with sums and multiples.2 By combining terms and recognizing, from 
Example 11.4, that Cov(Ri, Ri) = Var(Ri), we arrive at our main result of this section:
The Variance of a Two-Stock Portfolio
	
Var(RP) = x2
1Var(R1) + x2
2Var(R2) + 2x1x2Cov(R1,R2)
(11.8)
As always, the volatility is the square root of the variance, SD(RP) = 2Var(RP).
Let’s check this formula for the airline and oil stocks in Table 11.1. Consider the port-
folio containing shares of West Air and Tex Oil. The variance of each stock is equal to the 
square of its volatility, 0.1342 = 0.018. From Example 11.3, the covariance between the 
stocks is -0.0128. Therefore, the variance of a portfolio with 50% invested in each stock is
Var11
2 RW + 1
2 RT2 = x 2
WVar(RW) + x 2
TVar(RT) + 2x WxTCov(RW, RT)

22
2 (0.018) + 211
2211
22(-0.0128)
= 0.0026
The volatility of the portfolio is 20.0026 = 5.1%, which corresponds to the calculation 
in Table 11.1. For the North Air and West Air portfolio, the calculation is the same except 
for the stocks’ higher covariance of 0.0112, resulting in a higher volatility of 12.1%.
Equation 11.8 shows that the variance of the portfolio depends on the variance of the 
individual stocks and on the covariance between them. We can also rewrite Eq. 11.8 by 
calculating the covariance from the correlation (as in Example 11.5):
	
Var(RP) = x2
1SD(R1)2 + x2
2SD(R2)2 + 2x1x2Corr(R1,R2)SD(R1)SD(R2)
(11.9)
Equations 11.8 and 11.9 demonstrate that with a positive amount invested in each 
stock, the more the stocks move together and the higher their covariance or correlation, 
the more variable the portfolio will be. The portfolio will have the greatest variance if the 
stocks have a perfect positive correlation of +1.
2That is, Cov (A + B, C ) = Cov (A, C ) + Cov (B, C ) and Cov (mA, B) = m Cov (A, B).
Example 11.6

Problem
Using the data from Table 11.3, what is the volatility of a portfolio with equal amounts invested 
in Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard stock? What is the volatility of a portfolio with equal amounts 
invested in Microsoft and Alaska Air stock?
Solution
With portfolio weights of 50% each in Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard stock, from Eq. 11.9, the 
portfolio’s variance is
Var (RP) = x2
MSD(RM)2 + x2
HPSD(RHP)2 + 2xMxHPCorr (RM,RHP)SD(RM)SD(RHP)
= (0.50)2(0.33)2 + (0.50)2(0.37)2 + 2(0.50)(0.50)(0.39)(0.33)(0.37)
= 0.0853

11.3	 The Volatility of a Large Portfolio
We can gain additional benefits of diversification by holding more than two stocks in our 
portfolio. While these calculations are best done on a computer, by understanding them 
we can obtain important intuition regarding the amount of diversification that is possible 
if we hold many stocks.
Large Portfolio Variance
Recall that the return on a portfolio of n stocks is simply the weighted average of the 
returns of the stocks in the portfolio:
RP = x1R1 + x2R2 + g + xnRn = ai xiRi
Using the properties of the covariance, we can write the variance of a portfolio as follows:
	
Var(RP) = Cov(RP, RP) = Cov(i xiRi, RP) = ai xi Cov(Ri, RP)	
(11.10)
This equation indicates that the variance of a portfolio is equal to the weighted average cova-
riance of each stock with the portfolio. This expression reveals that the risk of a portfolio 
depends on how each stock’s return moves in relation to it.
We can reduce the formula even further by replacing the second RP with a weighted 
average and simplifying:
	
 Var(RP) = ai xi Cov(Ri,RP) = ai xi Cov(Ri,j xjRj)
 = ai a j xixj Cov(Ri,Rj)	
(11.11)
This formula says that the variance of a portfolio is equal to the sum of the covariances 
of the returns of all pairs of stocks in the portfolio multiplied by each of their portfolio 
weights.3 That is, the overall variability of the portfolio depends on the total co-movement 
of the stocks within it.
3Looking back, we can see that Eq. 11.11 generalizes the case of two stocks in Eq. 11.7.
	
11.3  The Volatility of a Large Portfolio	
397
The volatility is therefore SD(R ) = 2Var (R ) = 20.0853 = 29.2%.
For the portfolio of Microsoft and Alaska Air stock,
Var (RP) = x 2
MSD (RM)2 + x 2
A SD (RA)2 + 2xMxACorr (RM,RA)SD(RM )SD (RA)
= (0.50)2(0.33)2 + (0.50)2(0.37)2 + 2(0.50)(0.50)(0.21)(0.33)(0.37)
= 0.0743
The volatility in this case is SD(R ) = 2Var (R ) = 20.0743 = 27.3%.
Note that the portfolio of Microsoft and Alaska Air stock is less volatile than either of the 
individual stocks. It is also less volatile than the portfolio of Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard 
stock. Even though Alaska Air’s stock returns are as volatile as Hewlett-Packard’s, its lower 
­correlation with Microsoft’s returns leads to greater diversification in the portfolio.

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
Diversification with an Equally Weighted Portfolio
We can use Eq. 11.11 to calculate the variance of an equally weighted portfolio, a 
­portfolio in which the same amount is invested in each stock. An equally weighted port­
folio consisting of n stocks has portfolio weights xi = 1/n. In this case, we have the follow-
ing formula:4
Variance of an Equally Weighted Portfolio of n Stocks
Var(RP) = 1
n (Average Variance of the Individual Stocks)
+¢1 - 1
n ≤(Average Covariance between the Stocks)	
(11.12)
Equation 11.12 demonstrates that as the number of stocks, n, grows large, the variance of 
the portfolio is determined primarily by the average covariance among the stocks. As an 
example, consider a portfolio of stocks selected randomly from the stock market. The his-
torical volatility of the return of a typical large firm in the stock market is about 40%, and 
the typical correlation between the returns of large firms is about 25%. Using Eq. 11.12, 
and calculating the covariance from the correlation as in Example 11.5, the volatility of an 
equally weighted portfolio varies with the number of stocks, n, as follows:
SD(RP) = A
1
n (0.402) + a1 - 1
nb(0.25 * 0.40 * 0.40)
We graph the volatility for different numbers of stocks in Figure 11.2. Note that the ­volatility 
declines as the number of stocks in the portfolio grows. In fact, nearly half of the volatility 
4For an n-stock portfolio, there are n variance terms (any time i = j in Eq. 11.11) with weight xi
2 = 1/n2 
on each, which implies a weight of n/n2 = 1/n on the average variance. There are n2 - n covariance terms 
(all the n * n pairs minus the n variance terms) with weight xi xj = 1/n2 on each, which implies a weight 
of (n2 - n)/n2 = 1 - 1/n on the average covariance.

of the individual stocks is eliminated in a large portfolio as the result of ­diversification. 
The benefit of diversification is most dramatic initially: The decrease in volatility when 
going from one to two stocks is much larger than the decrease when going from 100 to 
101 stocks—indeed, almost all of the benefit of diversification can be achieved with about 
30 stocks. Even for a very large portfolio, however, we cannot eliminate all of the risk. The 
variance of the portfolio converges to the average covariance, so the volatility declines to 
20.25 * 0.4 * 0.4 = 20%.5
5You might wonder what happens if the average covariance is negative. It turns out that while the covari-
ance between a pair of stocks can be negative, as the portfolio grows large, the average covariance cannot 
be negative because the returns of all stocks cannot move in opposite directions simultaneously.
Example 11.7
Diversification Using Different Types of Stocks
Problem
Stocks within a single industry tend to have a higher correlation than stocks in different indus-
tries. Likewise, stocks in different countries have lower correlation on average than stocks within 
the United States. What is the volatility of a very large portfolio of stocks within an industry in 
which the stocks have a volatility of 40% and a correlation of 60%? What is the volatility of a 
very large portfolio of international stocks with a volatility of 40% and a correlation of 10%?
Solution
From Eq. 11.12, the volatility of the industry portfolio as n S   is given by
2Average Covariance = 20.60 * 0.40 * 0.40 = 31.0%
This volatility is higher than when using stocks from different industries as in Figure 11.2. 
­Combining stocks from the same industry that are more highly correlated therefore provides less 
diversification. We can achieve superior diversification using international stocks. In this case,
2Average Covariance = 20.10 * 0.40 * 0.40 = 12.6%
	
11.3  The Volatility of a Large Portfolio

We can also use Eq. 11.12 to derive one of the key results that we discussed in ­Chapter 10: 
When risks are independent, we can diversify all of the risk by holding a large portfolio.
Example 11.8
Volatility When Risks Are Independent
Problem
What is the volatility of an equally weighted average of n independent, identical risks?
Solution
If risks are independent, they are uncorrelated and their covariance is zero. Using Eq. 11.12, the 
volatility of an equally weighted portfolio of the risks is
SD(RP) = 2Var (RP) = A
1
nVar (Individual Risk) = SD(Individual Risk)
1n
This result coincides with Eq. 10.8, which we used earlier to evaluate independent risks. Note 
that as n S , the volatility goes to 0—that is, a very large portfolio will have no risk. In this 
case, we can eliminate all risk because there is no common risk.

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
QUESTION: Describe how you manage 
Stanford’s $16.5 billion endowment.
ANSWER: Our objective is to grow the 
endowment’s value after meeting our 5% 
annual payout obligation to Stanford 
University. We begin with the return we 
think will exceed 5%, account for infla-
tion, and grow modestly, creating a port-
folio that combines liquid and private 
(illiquid) strategies. We run a modified 
mean-variance optimization model using forward-looking 
assumptions of return and volatility of our asset classes, 
to find that place on the efficient frontier that meets our 
long-term objectives. Once we have our asset allocation 
strategy, we outsource money to a select group of third-
party managers, to capture their expertise, gain access to 
the higher returns from illiquid assets, and increase diver-
sification. We retain a relatively small portion in market 
replication instruments, including ETFs, so that we can 
modify our asset allocation quickly in response to pricing 
dislocations we perceive in the market.
QUESTION: You hold assets with very different expected 
returns. If your goal is to maximize the value of Stanford’s 
endowment, why not just hold those with the highest expected 
returns?
ANSWER: Illiquid assets provide us the highest returns. If 
they dominated our portfolio, we would expose the uni-
versity to their greater volatility and risk. As an operating 
business, Stanford requires some predictability of payout 
now and for future planning. Without diversification and 
a balanced portfolio, we’d create extreme risks of both 
spikes and crashes in portfolio value.
We also consider consequences across multiple time 
periods and in correlation to other assets. Increasing diver-
sification may yield better portfolio performance with 
lower risk levels. For example, real assets—commodities 
and real estate—typically have very low 
correlation with equity markets. However, 
during the 2008–2009 financial crisis, 
these assets became highly correlated to 
credits and equities—they all behaved the 
same way under pressure, creating a “cor-
relation storm.” Ultimately, that led to a 
reshaping of the portfolio.
QUESTION: Historically, university endow-
ments have performed extremely well com-
pared to public markets. Why do you think 
this is?
ANSWER: Endowment managers recog-
nized early the power of diversification. 
Their willingness to invest in alternative 
assets such as private equity funds yielded 
extraordinary returns. In addition, the 
declining interest rate environment over 
the past 25 years rewarded strategies that 
explicitly or implicitly employ leverage. Our ability to 
access premier money managers, acquire private assets, 
and use leveraged strategies like buyouts boosted our 
returns. From 2001–2011, Stanford’s annualized return 
was 9.3%, compared to 2.7% for the S&P 500 and 5.7% 
for the U.S. bond market.
QUESTION: During the financial crisis, did the portfolio 
achieve the benefits of diversification that you had expected? 
Has your strategy changed since the financial crisis?
ANSWER: Because of the above-mentioned “correlation 
storm,” we did not get the expected benefit of diversifica-
tion. We were nervous about the pricing of investment-
grade bonds, which were several standard deviations away 
from previous levels, and so we substantially reduced our 
exposure to corporate debt. This created cash and liquid-
ity for us to redeploy funds into attractively priced assets.
Going forward, we expect ongoing episodes of height-
ened market volatility. Our strategy is to increase the 
diversification of our portfolio as much as possible. We 
are working with money managers who buy value-based 
assets, looking for long-term price appreciation, and 
increasing exposure to more arbitrage-oriented strategies 
(less based on fundamentals of equity and corporate credit 
markets). When markets are under pressure, our goal is to 
be positioned to be able to acquire stressed assets priced at 
significant discounts.
John F. Powers was president and 
chief executive officer of the Stanford 
­Management Company from 2006–2015, 
responsible for managing Stanford

director and the director of research 
at Offit Hall Capital Management, an 
­investment advisory firm.

John Powers

Diversification with General Portfolios
The results in the last section depend on the portfolio being equally weighted. For a port-
folio with arbitrary weights, we can rewrite Eq. 11.10 in terms of the correlation as follows:
Var(RP) = ai xiCov(Ri, RP) = ai xiSD(Ri)SD(RP)Corr(Ri, RP)
Dividing both sides of this equation by the standard deviation of the portfolio yields the 
following important decomposition of the volatility of a portfolio:
Volatility of a Portfolio with Arbitrary Weights
	
 Security i ’s contribution to the
volatility of the portfolio
	
 
SD(RP) = a i xi * SD(Ri)
* Corr(Ri, RP) 
	

(11.13)
Equation 11.13 states that each security contributes to the volatility of the portfolio 
according to its volatility, or total risk, scaled by its correlation with the portfolio, which 
adjusts for the fraction of the total risk that is common to the portfolio. Therefore, when 
combining stocks into a portfolio that puts positive weight on each stock, unless all of 
the stocks have a perfect positive correlation of +1 with the portfolio (and thus with one 
another), the risk of the portfolio will be lower than the weighted average volatility of the 
individual stocks:
	
SD(RP) = ai xiSD(Ri ) Corr(Ri, RP) 6 ai xiSD(Ri)	
(11.14)
Contrast Eq. 11.14 with Eq. 11.3 for the expected return. The expected return of a 
portfolio is equal to the weighted average expected return, but the volatility of a port-
folio is less than the weighted average volatility: We can eliminate some volatility by 
diversifying.

Portfolio
Now that we understand how to calculate the expected return and volatility of a portfolio, 
we can return to the main goal of the chapter: Determine how an investor can create an 
efficient portfolio.6 Let’s start with the simplest case—an investor who can choose between 
only two stocks.
6The techniques of portfolio optimization were developed in a 1952 paper by Harry Markowitz, as well as 
in related work by Andrew Roy (1952) and Bruno de Finetti (1940) (see Further Reading).

Efficient Portfolios with Two Stocks
Consider a portfolio of Intel and Coca-Cola stock. Suppose an investor believes these 
stocks are uncorrelated and will perform as follows:
How should the investor choose a portfolio of these two stocks? Are some portfolios prefer-
able to others?
Let’s compute the expected return and volatility for different combinations of the 
stocks. Consider a portfolio with 40% invested in Intel stock and 60% invested in Coca-
Cola stock. We can compute the expected return from Eq. 11.3 as
E[R40-60] = xIE[RI] + xCE[RC] = 0.40(26%) + 0.60(6%) = 14%
We can compute the variance using Eq. 11.9,
Var(R40-60) = x 2
I SD(RI)2 + x 2
CSD(RC)2 + 2xIxCCorr(RI, RC)SD(RI)SD(RC)
= 0.402(0.50)2 + 0.602(0.25)2 + 2(0.40)(0.60)(0)(0.50)(0.25) = 0.0625
so that the volatility is SD(R40-60) = 20.0625 = 25%. Table 11.4 shows the results for 
different portfolio weights.
Due to diversification, it is possible to find a portfolio with even lower volatility than 
either stock: Investing 20% in Intel stock and 80% in Coca-Cola stock, for example, has 
a volatility of only 22.3%. But knowing that investors care about volatility and expected 
return, we must consider both simultaneously. To do so, we plot the volatility and expected 
return of each portfolio in Figure 11.3. We labeled the portfolios from Table 11.4 with the 
portfolio weights. The curve (a hyperbola) represents the set of portfolios that we can cre-
ate using arbitrary weights.
Faced with the choices in Figure 11.3, which ones make sense for an investor who is con-
cerned with both the expected return and the volatility of her portfolio? Suppose the investor 
considers investing 100% in Coca-Cola stock. As we can see from Figure 11.3, other portfo-
lios—such as the portfolio with 20% in Intel stock and 80% in Coca-Cola stock—make the 
investor better off in both ways: (1) They have a higher expected return, and (2) they have 
lower volatility. As a result, investing solely in Coca-Cola stock is not a good idea.

11.4  Risk Versus Return: Choosing an Efficient Portfolio	
403
Identifying Inefficient Portfolios.  More generally, we say a portfolio is an inefficient 
portfolio whenever it is possible to find another portfolio that is better in terms of both 
expected return and volatility. Looking at Figure 11.3, a portfolio is inefficient if there are 
other portfolios above and to the left—that is, to the northwest—of it. Investing solely in 
Coca-Cola stock is inefficient, and the same is true of all portfolios with more than 80% in 
Coca-Cola stock (the blue part of the curve). Inefficient portfolios are not optimal for an 
investor seeking high returns and low volatility.
Identifying Efficient Portfolios.  By contrast, portfolios with at least 20% in Intel stock are 
efficient (the red part of the curve): There is no other portfolio of the two stocks that offers 
a higher expected return with lower volatility. But while we can rule out ­inefficient portfo-
lios as inferior investment choices, we cannot easily rank the efficient ones—­investors will 
choose among them based on their own preferences for return versus risk. For example, 
an extremely conservative investor who cares only about minimizing risk would choose 
the lowest-volatility portfolio (20% Intel, 80% Coca-Cola). An aggressive investor might 
choose to invest 100% in Intel stock—even though that approach is riskier, the investor 
may be willing to take that chance to earn a higher expected return.

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
The Effect of Correlation
In Figure 11.3, we assumed that the returns of Intel and Coca-Cola stocks are ­uncorrelated. 
Let’s consider how the risk and return combinations would change if the correlations were 
different.
Correlation has no effect on the expected return of a portfolio. For example, a 40–60 
portfolio will still have an expected return of 14%. However, the volatility of the portfolio 
will differ depending on the correlation, as we saw in Section 11.2. In particular, the lower 
the correlation, the lower the volatility we can obtain. In terms of Figure 11.3, as we lower 
the correlation and therefore the volatility of the portfolios, the curve showing the portfo-
lios will bend to the left to a greater degree, as illustrated in Figure 11.4.
When the stocks are perfectly positively correlated, we can identify the set of portfolios 
by the straight line between them. In this extreme case (the red line in Figure 11.4), the 
volatility of the portfolio is equal to the weighted average volatility of the two stocks—
there is no diversification. When the correlation is less than 1, however, the volatility of the 
portfolios is reduced due to diversification, and the curve bends to the left. The reduction 
in risk (and the bending of the curve) becomes greater as the correlation decreases. At the 
other extreme of perfect negative correlation (blue line), the line again becomes straight, 
Solution
In Figure 11.3, we can see that Sally can invest up to 40% in Intel stock without increasing her 
volatility. Because Intel stock has a higher expected return than Coca-Cola stock, she will earn 
higher expected returns by putting more money in Intel stock. Therefore, you should recommend 
that Sally put 40% of her money in Intel stock, leaving 60% in Coca-Cola stock. This portfolio 
has the same volatility of 25%, but an expected return of 14% rather than the 6% she has now.

this time reflecting off the vertical axis. In particular, when the two stocks are perfectly 
negatively correlated, it becomes possible to hold a portfolio that bears absolutely no risk.
Short Sales
Thus far, we have considered only portfolios in which we invest a positive amount in each 
stock. We refer to a positive investment in a security as a long position in the security. But 
it is also possible to invest a negative amount in a stock, called a short position, by engag-
ing in a short sale, a transaction in which you sell a stock today that you do not own, with 
the obligation to buy it back in the future. (For the mechanics of a short sale, see the box 
on page 312 in Chapter 9). As the next example demonstrates, we can include a short posi-
tion as part of a portfolio by assigning that stock a negative portfolio weight.
Example 11.10
Expected Return and Volatility with a Short Sale
Problem
Suppose you have $20,000 in cash to invest. You decide to short sell $10,000 worth of Coca-
Cola stock and invest the proceeds from your short sale, plus your $20,000, in Intel. What is the 
expected return and volatility of your portfolio?
Solution
We can think of our short sale as a negative investment of -$10,000 in Coca-Cola stock. In addi-
tion, we invested +$30,000 in Intel stock, for a total net investment of $30,000 - $10,000 =  
$20,000 cash. The corresponding portfolio weights are
 xI = Value of investment in Intel
Total value of portfolio
= 30,000
20,000 = 150%
 xC = Value of investment in Coca@Cola
Total value of portfolio
= -10,000
20,000 = -50%
Note that the portfolio weights still add up to 100%. Using these portfolio weights, we can cal-
culate the expected return and volatility of the portfolio using Eq. 11.3 and Eq. 11.8 as before:
 E [RP] = xIE [RI] + xCE [RC] = 1.50 * 26% + (-0.50) * 6% = 36%
 SD(RP) = 2Var(RP) = 2x2
1Var (RI) + x2
CVar (RC) + 2xI xCCov (RI, RC)
 = 21.52 * 0.502 + (-0.5)2 * 0.252 + 2(1.5)(-0.5)(0) = 76.0%
Note that in this case, short selling increases the expected return of your portfolio, but also its 
volatility, above those of the individual stocks.
Short selling is profitable if you expect a stock’s price to decline in the future. Recall 
that when you borrow a stock to short sell it, you are obligated to buy and return it in the 
future. So when the stock price declines, you receive more upfront for the shares than the 
cost to replace them in the future. But as the preceding example shows, short selling can be 
advantageous even if you expect the stock’s price to rise, as long as you invest the proceeds 
in another stock with an even higher expected return. That said, and as the example also 
shows, short selling can greatly increase the risk of the portfolio.

406	
Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
In Figure 11.5, we show the effect on the investor’s choice set when we allow for short 
sales. Short selling Intel to invest in Coca-Cola is not efficient (blue dashed curve)—other 
­portfolios exist that have a higher expected return and a lower volatility. However, because Intel 
is expected to outperform Coca-Cola, short selling Coca-Cola to invest in Intel is ­efficient in 
this case. While such a strategy leads to a higher volatility, it also provides the investor with a 
higher expected return. This strategy could be attractive to an aggressive investor.
Efficient Portfolios with Many Stocks
Recall from Section 11.3 that adding more stocks to a portfolio reduces risk through diver-
sification. Let’s consider the effect of adding to our portfolio a third stock, Bore Industries, 
which is uncorrelated with Intel and Coca-Cola but is expected to have a very low return of 
2%, and the same volatility as Coca-Cola (25%). Figure 11.6 illustrates the portfolios that 
we can construct using these three stocks.
Because Bore stock is inferior to Coca-Cola stock—it has the same volatility but a lower 
return—you might guess that no investor would want to hold a long position in Bore. 
However, that conclusion ignores the diversification opportunities that Bore provides. 
­Figure 11.6 shows the results of combining Bore with Coca-Cola or with Intel (light blue 
curves), or combining Bore with a 50–50 portfolio of Coca-Cola and Intel (dark blue 
curve).7 Notice that some of the portfolios we obtained by combining only Intel and Coca-
Cola (black curve) are inferior to these new possibilities.
7When a portfolio includes another portfolio, we can compute the weight of each stock by multiplying the 
portfolio weights. For example, a portfolio with 30% in Bore stock and 70% in the portfolio of (50% Intel, 
50% Coca-Cola) has 30% in Bore stock, 70% * 50% = 35% in Intel stock, and 70% * 50% = 35% in 
Coca-Cola stock.

NOBEL PRIZES
The techniques of mean-variance portfolio optimization, 
which allow an investor to find the portfolio with the high-
est expected return for any level of variance (or volatility), 
were developed in an article, “Portfolio Selection,” pub-
lished in the Journal of Finance in 1952 by Harry Marko­
witz. Markowitz’s approach has evolved into one of the main 
methods of portfolio optimization used on Wall Street. In 
recognition for his contribution to the field, Markowitz was 
awarded the Nobel Prize for economics in 1990.
Markowitz’s work made clear that it is a security’s 
covariance with an investor’s portfolio that determines its 
incremental risk, and thus an investment’s risk cannot be 
evaluated in isolation. He also demonstrated that diversifica-
tion provided a “free lunch”—the opportunity to reduce risk 
without sacrificing expected return. In later work Marko­
witz went on to develop numerical algorithms to compute 
the efficient frontier for a set of securities.
Many of these same ideas were developed concurrently 
by Andrew Roy in “Safety First and the Holding of Assets” 
published in Econometrica in the same year. After winning 
the Nobel Prize, Markowitz graciously wrote “I am often 
called the father of modern portfolio theory, but Roy can 
claim an equal share of this honor.”* Interestingly, Mark 
Rubinstein discovered many of these ideas in an earlier 1940 
article by Bruno de Finetti in the Italian journal Giornale 
dell’Instituto Italiano degli Attuari, but the work remained in 
obscurity until its recent translation in 2004.**
While Markowitz assumed that investors might choose 
any portfolio on the efficient frontier of risky investments, 
James Tobin furthered this theory by considering the impli-
cations of allowing investors to combine risky securities with 
a risk-free investment. As we will show in Section 11.5, in 
that case we can identify a unique optimal portfolio of risky 
securities that does not depend on an investor’s tolerance for 
risk. In his article “Liquidity Preference as Behavior Toward 
Risk” published in the Review of Economic Studies in 1958, 
Tobin proved a “Separation Theorem,” which applied Mar-
kowitz’s techniques to find this optimal risky portfolio. The 
Separation Theorem showed that investors could choose 
their ideal exposure to risk by varying their investments in 
the optimal portfolio and the risk-free investment. Tobin 
was awarded the Nobel Prize for economics in 1981 for his 
contributions to finance and economics.

When we combine Bore stock with every portfolio of Intel and Coca-Cola, and allow 
for short sales as well, we get an entire region of risk and return possibilities rather than just 
a single curve. This region is shown in the shaded area in Figure 11.7. But note that most 
of these portfolios are inefficient. The efficient portfolios—those offering the highest pos-
sible expected return for a given level of volatility—are those on the northwest edge of the 
shaded region, which we call the efficient frontier for these three stocks. In this case none 
of the stocks, on its own, is on the efficient frontier, so it would not be efficient to put all 
our money in a single stock.
When the set of investment opportunities increases from two to three stocks, the effi-
cient frontier improves. Visually, the old frontier with any two stocks is located inside the 
new frontier. In general, adding new investment opportunities allows for greater diversi-
fication and improves the efficient frontier. Figure 11.8 uses historical data to show the 
effect of increasing the set from three stocks (Amazon, GE, and McDonald’s) to ten stocks. 
Even though the added stocks appear to offer inferior risk–return combinations on their 
own, because they allow for additional diversification, the efficient frontier improves with 
their inclusion. Thus, to arrive at the best possible set of risk and return opportunities, we 
should keep adding stocks until all investment opportunities are represented. Ultimately, 
based on our estimates of returns, volatilities, and correlations, we can construct the effi-
cient frontier for all available risky investments showing the best possible risk and return 
combinations that we can obtain by optimal diversification.

11.5	 Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing
Thus far, we have considered the risk and return possibilities that result from combining 
risky investments into portfolios. By including all risky investments in the construction of 
the efficient frontier, we achieve maximum diversification.
There is another way besides diversification to reduce risk that we have not yet consid-
ered: We can keep some of our money in a safe, no-risk investment like Treasury bills. Of 
course, doing so will reduce our expected return. Conversely, if we are an aggressive inves-
tor who is seeking high expected returns, we might decide to borrow money to invest even 
more in the stock market. In this section we will see that the ability to choose the amount 
to invest in risky versus risk-free securities allows us to determine the optimal portfolio of 
risky securities for an investor.
Investing in Risk-Free Securities
Consider an arbitrary risky portfolio with returns RP. Let’s look at the effect on risk and 
return of putting a fraction x of our money in the portfolio, while leaving the remaining 
fraction (1 - x) in risk-free Treasury bills with a yield of rf .
Using Eq. 11.3 and Eq. 11.8, we calculate the expected return and variance of this port-
folio, whose return we will denote by RxP. First, the expected return is
	
E[RxP] = (1 - x)rf + xE[RP]
	
= rf + x(E[RP] - rf )	
(11.15)
The first equation simply states that the expected return is the weighted average of the 
expected returns of Treasury bills and the portfolio. (Because we know up front the 
­current interest rate paid on Treasury bills, we do not need to compute an expected return

for them.) The second equation rearranges the first to give a useful interpretation: Our 
expected return is equal to the risk-free rate plus a fraction of the portfolio’s risk premium, 
E[RP] - rf , based on the fraction x that we invest in it.
Next, let’s compute the volatility. Because the risk-free rate rf  is fixed and does not move 
with (or against) our portfolio, its volatility and covariance with the portfolio are both zero. 
Thus,
	
 SD(RxP) = 2(1 - x)2Var(rf) + x2Var(RP) + 2(1 - x)xCov(rf , RP)
	
 = 2x2Var(RP)
	
 = xSD(RP)
(11.16)
That is, the volatility is only a fraction of the volatility of the portfolio, based on the 
amount we invest in it.
The blue line in Figure 11.9 illustrates combinations of volatility and expected return 
for different choices of x. Looking at Eq. 11.15 and Eq. 11.16, as we increase the fraction 
x invested in P, we increase both our risk and our risk premium proportionally. Hence the 
line is straight from the risk-free investment through P.
Borrowing and Buying Stocks on Margin
As we increase the fraction x invested in the portfolio P from 0 to 100%, we move along 
the line in Figure 11.9 from the risk-free investment to P. If we increase x beyond 100%, 
we get points beyond P in the graph. In this case, we are short selling the risk-free invest-
ment, so we must pay the risk-free return; in other words, we are borrowing money at the 
risk-free interest rate.
Borrowing money to invest in stocks is referred to as buying stocks on margin or using 
leverage. A portfolio that consists of a short position in the risk-free investment is known

as a levered portfolio. As you might expect, margin investing is a risky investment strategy. 
Note that the region of the blue line in Figure 11.9 with x 7 100% has higher risk than the 
portfolio P itself. At the same time, margin investing can provide higher expected returns 
than investing in P using only the funds we have available.
Example 11.11
Margin Investing
Problem
Suppose you have $10,000 in cash, and you decide to borrow another $10,000 at a 5% interest 
rate in order to invest $20,000 in portfolio Q, which has a 10% expected return and a 20% vola-
tility. What is the expected return and volatility of your investment? What is your realized return 
if Q goes up 30% over the year? What if Q falls by 10%?
Solution
You have doubled your investment in Q using margin, so x = 200%. From Eq. 11.15 and Eq. 
11.16, we see that you have increased both your expected return and your risk relative to the 
portfolio Q:
E (RxQ) = rf + x (E [RQ] - rf ) = 5% + 2 * (10% - 5%) = 15%
SD (RxQ) = xSD(RQ) = 2 * (20%) = 40%
If Q goes up 30%, your investment will be worth $26,000, but you will owe $10,000 * 1.05 
= $10,500 on your loan, for a net payoff of $15,500 or a 55% return on your $10,000 initial 
investment. If Q drops by 10%, you are left with $18,000 - $10,500 = $7500, and your return 
is -25%. Thus the use of margin doubled the range of your returns (55% - (-25%) = 80% 
versus 30% - (-10%) = 40%), corresponding to the doubling of the volatility of the portfolio.
Identifying the Tangent Portfolio
Looking back at Figure 11.9, we can see that portfolio P is not the best portfolio to com-
bine with the risk-free investment. By combining the risk-free asset with a portfolio some-
what higher on the efficient frontier than portfolio P, we will get a line that is steeper than 
the line through P. If the line is steeper, then for any level of volatility, we will earn a higher 
expected return.
To earn the highest possible expected return for any level of volatility we must find the 
portfolio that generates the steepest possible line when combined with the risk-free invest-
ment. The slope of the line through a given portfolio P is often referred to as the Sharpe 
ratio of the portfolio:
	
Sharpe Ratio = Portfolio Excess Return
Portfolio Volatility
=
E[RP] - rf
SD(RP) 
(11.17)
The Sharpe ratio measures the ratio of reward-to-volatility provided by a portfolio.8 The 
optimal portfolio to combine with the risk-free asset will be the one with the highest Sharpe 
ratio, where the line with the risk-free investment just touches, and so is tangent to, the 
efficient frontier of risky investments, as shown in Figure  11.10. The portfolio that

mutual funds. See W. Sharpe, “Mutual Fund Performance,” Journal of Business 39 (1966): 119–138.

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
generates this tangent line is known as the tangent portfolio. All other portfolios of risky 
assets lie below this line. Because the tangent portfolio has the highest Sharpe ratio of any 
portfolio in the economy, the tangent portfolio provides the biggest reward per unit of vol-
atility of any portfolio available.9
As is evident from Figure 11.10, combinations of the risk-free asset and the tangent 
portfolio provide the best risk and return trade-off available to an investor. This observa-
tion has a striking consequence: The tangent portfolio is efficient and, once we include the 
risk-free investment, all efficient portfolios are combinations of the risk-free investment 
and the tangent portfolio. Therefore, the optimal portfolio of risky investments no longer 
depends on how conservative or aggressive the investor is; every investor should invest in 
the tangent portfolio independent of his or her taste for risk. The investor’s preferences will 
determine only how much to invest in the tangent portfolio versus the risk-free investment. 
Conservative investors will invest a small amount, choosing a portfolio on the line near the 
risk-free investment. Aggressive investors will invest more, choosing a portfolio that is near 
the tangent portfolio or even beyond it by buying stocks on margin. But both types of 
investors will choose to hold the same portfolio of risky assets, the tangent portfolio.
We have achieved one of the primary goals of this chapter and explained how to identify 
the efficient portfolio of risky assets. The efficient portfolio is the tangent portfolio, the 
portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio in the economy. By combining it with the risk-free 
investment, an investor will earn the highest possible expected return for any level of vola-
tility he or she is willing to bear.
9The Sharpe ratio can also be interpreted as the number of standard deviations the portfolio’s return must 
fall to underperform the risk-free investment. Thus, if returns are normally distributed, the tangent port-
folio is the portfolio with the greatest chance of earning a return above the risk-free rate.

11.6	 The Efficient Portfolio and Required Returns
Thus far, we have evaluated the optimal portfolio choice for an investor, and concluded 
that the tangent or efficient portfolio in Figure 11.10 offers the highest Sharpe ratio and 
therefore the best risk-return trade-off available. We now turn to the implications of this 
result for a firm’s cost of capital. After all, if a firm wants to raise new capital, investors 
must find it attractive to increase their investment in it. In this section we derive a condi-
tion to determine whether we can improve a portfolio by adding more of a given security, 
and use it to calculate an investor’s required return for holding an investment.
Portfolio Improvement: Beta and the Required Return
Take an arbitrary portfolio P, and let’s consider whether we could raise its Sharpe ratio by 
selling some of our risk-free assets (or borrowing money) and investing the proceeds in an 
investment i. If we do so, there are two consequences:
	
1.	 Expected return: Because we are giving up the risk-free return and replacing it with 
i’s return, our expected return will increase by i’s excess return, E[Ri] - rf .
Example 11.12
Optimal Portfolio Choice
Problem
Your uncle asks for investment advice. Currently, he has $100,000 invested in portfolio P in 
­Figure 11.10, which has an expected return of 10.5% and a volatility of 8%. Suppose the risk-
free rate is 5%, and the tangent portfolio has an expected return of 18.5% and a volatility of 
13%. To maximize his expected return without increasing his volatility, which portfolio would 
you recommend? If your uncle prefers to keep his expected return the same but minimize his 
risk, which portfolio would you recommend?
Solution
In either case the best portfolios are combinations of the risk-free investment and the tangent 
portfolio. If we invest an amount x in the tangent portfolio T, using Eq. 11.15 and Eq. 11.16, 
the expected return and volatility are
E [RxT] = rf + x(E [RT ] - rf ) = 5% + x(18.5% - 5%)
SD (RxT ) = x SD(RT) = x (13%)
So, to maintain the volatility at 8%, x = 8%/13% = 61.5%. In this case, your uncle should 
invest $61,500 in the tangent portfolio, and the remaining $38,500 in the risk-free investment. 
His expected return will then be 5% + (61.5%)(13.5%) = 13.3%, the highest possible given his 
level of risk.
Alternatively, to keep the expected return equal to the current value of 10.5%, x must 
­satisfy 5% + x(13.5%) = 10.5%, so x = 40.7%. Now your uncle should invest $40,700 in 
the tangent portfolio and $59,300 in the risk-free investment, lowering his volatility level to 
(40.7%)(13%) = 5.29%, the lowest possible given his expected return.

2.	 Volatility: We will add the risk that i has in common with our portfolio (the rest 
of i ’s risk will be diversified). From Eq. 11.13, incremental risk is measured by i ’s 
volatility multiplied by its correlation with P: SD(Ri) * Corr(Ri, RP).
Is the gain in return from investing in i adequate to make up for the increase in risk? 
Another way we could have increased our risk would have been to invest more in portfolio 
P itself. In that case, P’s Sharpe ratio,

SD(RP) ,
tells us how much the return would increase for a given increase in risk. Because the invest-
ment in i increases risk by SD(Ri) * Corr(Ri, RP), it offers a larger increase in return than 
we could have gotten from P alone if 10

To provide a further interpretation for this condition, let’s combine the volatility and

bP

SD(RP)
	
(11.19)
bP
i  measures the sensitivity of the investment i to the fluctuations of the portfolio P. That 
is, for each 1% change in the portfolio’s return, investment i ’s return is expected to change 
by bP
i % due to risks that i has in common with P. With this definition, we can restate 
Eq. 11.18 as follows:
E[Ri] 7 rf + bP
i * (E[RP] - rf )
That is, increasing the amount invested in i will increase the Sharpe ratio of portfolio P if its 
expected return E[Ri] exceeds its required return given portfolio P, defined as
	
ri K rf + bP
i * (E[RP] - rf )	
(11.20)
The required return is the expected return that is necessary to compensate for the risk 
investment i will contribute to the portfolio. The required return for an investment i is 
equal to the risk-free interest rate plus the risk premium of the current portfolio, P, scaled 
by i’s sensitivity to P, bi
P. If i’s expected return exceeds this required return, then adding 
more of it will improve the performance of the portfolio.
10We can also write Eq. 11.18 as a comparison of the Sharpe ratio of investment i with the Sharpe ratio of 
the portfolio scaled by their correlation (the fraction of the risk they have in common):

Expected Returns and the Efficient Portfolio
If a security’s expected return exceeds its required return, then we can improve the perfor-
mance of portfolio P by adding more of the security. But how much more should we add? 
As we buy shares of security i, its correlation (and therefore its beta) with our portfolio will 
increase, ultimately raising its required return until E[Ri] = ri. At this point, our holdings 
of security i are optimal. Similarly, if security i ’s expected return is less than the required 
return ri, we should reduce our holdings of i. As we do so the correlation and the required 
return ri will fall until E[Ri] = ri.
Thus, if we have no restrictions on our ability to buy or sell securities that are traded in 
the market, we will continue to trade until the expected return of each security equals its 
required return—that is, until E[Ri] = ri holds for all i. At this point, no trade can possi-
bly improve the risk–reward ratio of the portfolio, so our portfolio is the optimal, efficient 
portfolio. That is, a portfolio is efficient if and only if the expected return of every available 
security equals its required return.
From Eq. 11.20, this result implies the following relationship between the expected 
return of any security and its beta with the efficient portfolio:

E[Ri] = ri K rf + beff

where Reff  is the return of the efficient portfolio, the portfolio with the highest Sharpe 
ratio of any portfolio in the economy.
Example 11.13
The Required Return of a New Investment
Problem
You are currently invested in the Omega Fund, a broad-based fund with an expected return of 
15% and a volatility of 20%, as well as in risk-free Treasuries paying 3%. Your broker suggests 
that you add a real estate fund to your portfolio. The real estate fund has an expected return of 
9%, a volatility of 35%, and a correlation of 0.10 with the Omega Fund. Will adding the real 
estate fund improve your portfolio?
Solution
Let Rre be the return of the real estate fund and RO be the return of the Omega Fund. From 
Eq. 11.19, the beta of the real estate fund with the Omega Fund is
bO
re = SD (Rre )Corr (Rre, RO)
SD (RO)
= 35% * 0.10
20%
= 0.175
We can then use Eq. 11.20 to determine the required return that makes the real estate fund an 
attractive addition to our portfolio:
rre = rf + bO
re(E [RO] - rf ) = 3% + 0.175 * (15% - 3%) = 5.1%
Because its expected return of 9% exceeds the required return of 5.1%, investing some amount 
in the real estate fund will improve our portfolio’s Sharpe ratio.

Before we move on, note the significance of Eq. 11.21. This equation establishes the relation 
between an investment’s risk and its expected return. It states that we can determine the appro-
priate risk premium for an investment from its beta with the efficient portfolio. The efficient or 
Example 11.14
Identifying the Efficient Portfolio
Problem
Consider the Omega Fund and real estate fund of Example 11.13. Suppose you have $100 mil-
lion invested in the Omega Fund. In addition to this position, how much should you invest in 
the real estate fund to form an efficient portfolio of these two funds?
Solution
Suppose that for each $1 invested in the Omega Fund, we borrow xre dollars (or sell xre 
worth of Treasury bills) to invest in the real estate fund. Then our portfolio has a return of 
RP = RO + xre (Rre - rf ), where RO is the return of the Omega Fund and Rre is the return of the 
real estate fund. Table 11.5 shows the change to the expected return and volatility of our port­
folio as we increase the investment xre in the real estate fund, using the formulas
E [RP ] = E [RO] + xre(E [Rre ] - rf )
Var (RP ) = Var [RO + xre(Rre - rf )] = Var (RO) + x2
reVar (Rre) + 2xreCov (Rre , RO)
Adding the real estate fund initially improves the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, as defined by 
Eq. 11.17. As we add more of the real estate fund, however, its correlation with our portfolio 
rises, computed as
Corr (Rre , RP) =
Cov (Rre , RP)
SD(Rre )SD(RP) =
Cov (Rre , RO + xre (Rre - rf ))
SD(Rre)SD(RP)
= xreVar (Rre ) + Cov (Rre , RO)
SD(Rre )SD(RP )
The beta of the real estate fund—computed from Eq. 11.19—also rises, increasing the required 
return. The required return equals the 9% expected return of the real estate fund at about 
xre = 11%, which is the same level of investment that maximizes the Sharpe ratio. Thus, the 
efficient portfolio of these two funds includes $0.11 in the real estate fund per $1 invested in the 
Omega Fund.

tangent portfolio, which has the highest possible Sharpe ratio of any portfolio in the market, 
provides the benchmark that identifies the systematic risk present in the economy.
In Chapter 10, we  argued that the market portfolio of all risky securities should be well 
diversified, and therefore could be used as a benchmark to measure systematic risk. To 
understand the connection between the market portfolio and the efficient portfolio, we 
must consider the implications of the collective investment decisions of all investors, which 
we turn to next.

11.7	 The Capital Asset Pricing Model
As shown in Section 11.6, once we can identify the efficient portfolio, we can compute the 
expected return of any security based on its beta with the efficient portfolio according to 
Eq. 11.21. But to implement this approach, we face an important practical problem: To 
identify the efficient portfolio we must know the expected returns, volatilities, and correla-
tions between investments. These quantities are difficult to forecast. Under these circum-
stances, how do we put the theory into practice?
To answer this question, we revisit the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which we 
introduced in Chapter 10. This model allows us to identify the efficient portfolio of risky 
assets without having any knowledge of the expected return of each security. Instead, the 
CAPM uses the optimal choices investors make to identify the efficient portfolio as the 
market portfolio, the portfolio of all stocks and securities in the market. To obtain this 
remarkable result, we make three assumptions regarding the behavior of investors.11
The CAPM Assumptions
Three main assumptions underlie the CAPM. The first is a familiar one that we have 
adopted since Chapter 3:
	
1.	 Investors can buy and sell all securities at competitive market prices (without incurring 
taxes or transactions costs) and can borrow and lend at the risk-free interest rate.
The second assumption is that all investors behave as we have described thus far in this 
chapter, and choose a portfolio of traded securities that offers the highest possible expected 
return given the level of volatility they are willing to accept:
	
2.	 Investors hold only efficient portfolios of traded securities—portfolios that yield the max-
imum expected return for a given level of volatility.
Of course, there are many investors in the world, and each may have his or her own 
estimates of the volatilities, correlations, and expected returns of the available securities. 
But investors don’t come up with these estimates arbitrarily; they base them on historical 
patterns and other information (including market prices) that is widely available to the 
public. If all investors use publicly available information sources, then their estimates are 
likely to be similar. Consequently, it is not unreasonable to consider a special case in which 
all investors have the same estimates concerning future investments and returns, called 
11The CAPM was proposed as a model of risk and return by William Sharpe in a 1964 paper, as well as in 
related papers by Jack Treynor (1962), John Lintner (1965), and Jan Mossin (1966).
	
11.7  The Capital Asset Pricing Model

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
homogeneous expectations. Although investors’ expectations are not completely identical 
in reality, assuming homogeneous expectations should be a reasonable approximation in 
many markets, and represents the third simplifying assumption of the CAPM:
	
3.	 Investors have homogeneous expectations regarding the volatilities, correlations, and 
expected returns of securities.
Supply, Demand, and the Efficiency of the Market Portfolio
If investors have homogeneous expectations, then each investor will identify the same port-
folio as having the highest Sharpe ratio in the economy. Thus, all investors will demand the 
same efficient portfolio of risky securities—the tangent portfolio in ­Figure 11.10—­adjusting 
only their investment in risk-free securities to suit their particular appetite for risk.
But if every investor is holding the tangent portfolio, then the combined portfolio of 
risky securities of all investors must also equal the tangent portfolio. Furthermore, because 
every security is owned by someone, the sum of all investors’ portfolios must equal the 
portfolio of all risky securities available in the market, which we defined in Chapter 10 as 
the market portfolio. Therefore, the efficient, tangent portfolio of risky securities (the portfolio 
that all investors hold) must equal the market portfolio.
The insight that the market portfolio is efficient is really just the statement that demand 
must equal supply. All investors demand the efficient portfolio, and the supply of securities 
is the market portfolio; hence the two must coincide. If a security were not part of the effi-
cient portfolio, then no investor would want to own it, and demand for this security would 
not equal its supply. This security’s price would fall, causing its expected return to rise until 
it became an attractive investment. In this way, prices in the market will adjust so that the 
efficient portfolio and the market portfolio coincide, and demand equals supply.
Example 11.15
Portfolio Weights and the Market Portfolio
Problem
Suppose that after much research, you have identified the efficient portfolio. As part of your 
holdings, you have decided to invest $10,000 in Microsoft, and $5000 in Pfizer stock. Suppose 
your friend, who is a wealthier but more conservative investor, has $2000 invested in Pfizer. If 
your friend’s portfolio is also efficient, how much has she invested in Microsoft? If all investors 
are holding efficient portfolios, what can you conclude about Microsoft’s market capitalization, 
compared to Pfizer’s?
Solution
Because all efficient portfolios are combination of the risk-free investment and the tangent port-
folio, they share the same proportions of risky stocks. Thus, since you have invested twice as 
much in Microsoft as in Pfizer, the same must be true for your friend; therefore, she has invested 
$4000 in Microsoft stock. If all investors hold efficient portfolios, the same must be true of 
each of their portfolios. Because, collectively, all investors own all shares of Microsoft and Pfizer, 
Microsoft’s market capitalization must therefore be twice that of Pfizer’s.
Optimal Investing: The Capital Market Line
When the CAPM assumptions hold, the market portfolio is efficient, so the tangent port­folio 
in Figure 11.10 is actually the market portfolio. We illustrate this result in ­Figure 11.11. 
Recall that the tangent line graphs the highest possible expected return we can achieve for 

any level of volatility. When the tangent line goes through the market portfolio, it is called 
the capital market line (CML). According to the CAPM, all investors should choose a 
portfolio on the capital market line, by holding some combination of the risk-free security 
and the market portfolio.

When investors have 
homogeneous ­expectations, 
the ­market portfolio and 
the ­efficient portfolio 
­coincide. Therefore, the 
capital market line (CML),

the risk-free ­investment 
through the market 
­portfolio, represents the

available for any level 
of volatility. (Data from

11.8	 Determining the Risk Premium
Under the CAPM assumptions, we can identify the efficient portfolio: It is equal to the 
market portfolio. Thus, if we don’t know the expected return of a security or the cost of 
capital of an investment, we can use the CAPM to find it by using the market portfolio as a 
benchmark.
Market Risk and Beta
In Eq. 11.21, we showed that the expected return of an investment is given by its beta with 
the efficient portfolio. But if the market portfolio is efficient, we can rewrite Eq. 11.21 as
The CAPM Equation for the Expected Return
	
E[Ri] = ri = rf + bi * (E[RMkt] - rf )

where bi is the beta of the security with respect to the market portfolio, defined as (using 
Eq. 11.19 and Eq. 11.6)
	
bi = SD(Ri) * Corr(Ri, RMkt)
SD(RMkt)
= Cov(Ri, RMkt)
Var(RMkt)
	
(11.23)
The beta of a security measures its volatility due to market risk relative to the market as a 
whole, and thus captures the security’s sensitivity to market risk.
Equation 11.22 is the same result that we derived intuitively at the conclusion of 
­Chapter 10. It states that to determine the appropriate risk premium for any investment, 
we must rescale the market risk premium (the amount by which the market’s expected 
return exceeds the risk-free rate) by the amount of market risk present in the security’s 
returns, measured by its beta with the market.
We can interpret the CAPM equation as follows. Following the Law of One Price, in a 
competitive market, investments with similar risk should have the same expected return. 
Because investors can eliminate firm-specific risk by diversifying their portfolios, the right 
measure of risk is the investment’s beta with the market portfolio, bi. As the next example 
demonstrates, the CAPM Eq. 11.22 states that the investment’s expected return should 
therefore match the expected return of the capital market line portfolio with the same level 
of market risk.
Example 11.16
Computing the Expected Return for a Stock
Problem
Suppose the risk-free return is 4% and the market portfolio has an expected return of 10% and a 
volatility of 16%. 3M stock has a 22% volatility and a correlation with the market of 0.50. What 
is 3M’s beta with the market? What capital market line portfolio has equivalent market risk, and 
what is its expected return?
Solution
We can compute beta using Eq. 11.23:
bMMM = SD(RMMM)Corr (RMMM , RMkt)
SD(RMkt )
= 22% * 0.50
16%
= 0.69
That is, for each 1% move of the market portfolio, 3M stock tends to move 0.69%. We could 
obtain the same sensitivity to market risk by investing 69% in the market portfolio, and 31% 
in the risk-free security. Because it has the same market risk, 3M’s stock should have the same 
expected return as this portfolio, which is (using Eq. 11.15 with x = 0.69),
 E [RMMM] = rf + x (E [RMkt] - rf ) = 4% + 0.69(10% - 4%)
 = 8.1%
Because x = bMMM, this calculation is precisely the CAPM Eq. 11.22. Thus, investors will 
require an expected return of 8.1% to compensate for the risk associated with 3M stock.

Example 11.17
A Negative-Beta Stock
Problem
Suppose the stock of Bankruptcy Auction Services, Inc. (BAS), has a negative beta of -0.30. 
How does its expected return compare to the risk-free rate, according to the CAPM? Does this 
result make sense?
Solution
Because the expected return of the market is higher than the risk-free rate, Eq. 11.22 implies that 
the expected return of BAS will be below the risk-free rate. For example, if the risk-free rate is 4% 
and the expected return on the market is 10%,
E [RBAS] = 4% - 0.30(10% - 4%) = 2.2%
This result seems odd: Why would investors be willing to accept a 2.2% expected return on this 
stock when they can invest in a safe investment and earn 4%? A savvy investor will not hold BAS 
alone; instead, she will hold it in combination with other securities as part of a well-diversified 
portfolio. Because BAS will tend to rise when the market and most other securities fall, BAS 
provides “recession insurance” for the portfolio. That is, when times are bad and most stocks are 
down, BAS will do well and offset some of this negative return. Investors are willing to pay for 
this insurance by accepting an expected return below the risk-free rate.
NOBEL PRIZE
William Sharpe received the Nobel Prize in 1990 for his 
development of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Here are 
his comments on the CAPM from a 1998 interview with 
Jonathan Burton:*
Portfolio theory focused on the actions of a single inves-
tor with an optimal portfolio. I said, What if everyone was 
optimizing? They’ve all got their copies of Markowitz and 
they’re doing what he says. Then some people decide they 
want to hold more IBM, but there aren’t enough shares to 
satisfy demand. So they put price pressure on IBM and up 
it goes, at which point they have to change their estimates 
of risk and return, because now they’re paying more for the 
stock. That process of upward and downward pressure on 
prices continues until prices reach an equilibrium and every-
one collectively wants to hold what’s available. At that point, 
what can you say about the relationship between risk and 
return? The answer is that expected return is proportionate 
to beta relative to the market portfolio.
The CAPM was and is a theory of equilibrium. Why 
should anyone expect to earn more by investing in one secu-
rity as opposed to another? You need to be compensated for 
doing badly when times are bad. The security that is going 
to do badly just when you need money when times are bad 
is a security you have to hate, and there had better be some

Jones Asset Manager (May/June 1998): 20–28.
redeeming virtue or else who will hold it? That redeeming 
virtue has to be that in normal times you expect to do better. 
The key insight of the Capital Asset Pricing Model is that 
higher expected returns go with the greater risk of doing 
badly in bad times. Beta is a measure of that. Securities or 
asset classes with high betas tend to do worse in bad times 
than those with low betas.
The CAPM was a very simple, very strong set of assump-
tions that got a nice, clean, pretty result. And then almost 
immediately, we all said: Let’s bring more complexity into 
it to try to get closer to the real world. People went on—
myself and others—to what I call “extended” Capital Asset 
Pricing Models, in which expected return is a function of 
beta, taxes, liquidity, dividend yield, and other things people 
might care about.
Did the CAPM evolve? Of course. But the fundamental 
idea remains that there’s no reason to expect reward just for 
bearing risk. Otherwise, you’d make a lot of money in Las 
Vegas. If there’s reward for risk, it’s got to be special. There’s got 
to be some economics behind it or else the world is a very crazy 
place. I don’t think differently about those basic ideas at all.

The Security Market Line
Equation 11.22 implies that there is a linear relationship between a stock’s beta and its 
expected return. Panel (b) of Figure 11.12 graphs this line through the risk-free invest-
ment (with a beta of 0) and the market (with a beta of 1); it is called the security market line 
(SML). Under the CAPM assumptions, the security market line (SML) is the line along 
which all individual securities should lie when plotted according to their expected return 
and beta, as shown in panel (b).
Contrast this result with the capital market line shown in panel (a) of ­Figure 11.12, 
where there is no clear relationship between an individual stock’s volatility and its expected 
return. As we illustrate for McDonald’s (MCD), a stock’s expected return is due only to the 
fraction of its volatility that is common with the market—Corr(RMCD, RMkt) * SD(RMCD); 
the distance of each stock to the right of the capital market line is due to its diversifiable 
risk. The relationship between risk and return for individual securities becomes evident 
only when we measure market risk rather than total risk.
Beta of a Portfolio
Because the security market line applies to all tradable investment opportunities, we can 
apply it to portfolios as well. Consequently, the expected return of a portfolio is given by 
Eq. 11.22 and therefore depends on the portfolio’s beta. Using Eq. 11.23, we calculate the 
beta of a portfolio Rp = ai xiRi as follows:

In other words, the beta of a portfolio is the weighted average beta of the securities in the 
portfolio.
Example 11.18
The Expected Return of a Portfolio
Problem
Suppose Kraft Foods’ stock has a beta of 0.50, whereas Boeing’s beta is 1.25. If the risk-free rate 
is 4%, and the expected return of the market portfolio is 10%, what is the expected return of an 
equally weighted portfolio of Kraft Foods and Boeing stocks, according to the CAPM?
Solution
We can compute the expected return of the portfolio in two ways. First, we can use the SML to 
compute the expected return of Kraft Foods (KFT) and Boeing (BA) separately:
E [RKFT] = rf + bKFT (E [RMkt] - rf ) = 4% + 0.50(10% - 4%) = 7.0%
E [RBA] = rf + bBA(E [RMkt] - rf ) = 4% + 1.25(10% - 4%) = 11.5%
Then, the expected return of the equally weighted portfolio P is
E [RP] = 1
2 E [RKFT ] + 1
2 E [RBA] = 1
2 (7.0%) + 1
2 (11.5%) = 9.25%

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
Summary of the Capital Asset Pricing Model
In these last two sections, we have explored the consequences of the CAPM assumptions 
that markets are competitive, investors choose efficient portfolios, and investors have 
homogeneous expectations. The CAPM leads to two major conclusions:
▪n	 The market portfolio is the efficient portfolio. Therefore, the highest expected return 
for any given level of volatility is obtained by a portfolio on the capital market line, 
which combines the market portfolio with risk-free saving or borrowing.
▪n	 The risk premium for any investment is proportional to its beta with the market. There-
fore, the relationship between risk and the required return is given by the security mar-
ket line described by Eq. 11.22 and Eq. 11.23.
The CAPM model is based on strong assumptions. Because some of these assumptions 
do not fully describe investors’ behavior, some of the model’s conclusions are not com-
pletely accurate—it is certainly not the case that every investor holds the market portfolio, 
for instance. We will examine individual investor behavior in more detail in Chapter 13, 
where we also consider proposed extensions to the CAPM. Nevertheless, financial econo-
mists find the qualitative intuition underlying the CAPM compelling, so it is still the most 
common and important model of risk and return. While not perfect, it is widely regarded 
as a very useful approximation and is used by firms and practitioners as a practical means 
to estimate a security’s expected return and an investment’s cost of capital. In Chapter 12, 
we will explain in more detail how to implement the model, looking more closely at the 
construction of the market portfolio and developing a means to estimate the betas of firms’ 
securities as well as their underlying investments.
Concept Check	
1.	 What is the security market line (SML)?
	
2.	 According to the CAPM, how can we determine a stock’s expected return?
Alternatively, we can compute the beta of the portfolio using Eq. 11.24:
bP = 1
2 bKFT + 1
2 bBA = 1
2 (0.50) + 1
2 (1.25) = 0.875
We can then find the portfolio’s expected return from the SML:
E [RP] = rf + bP (E [RMkt] - rf ) = 4% + 0.875(10% - 4%) = 9.25%
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
11.1  The Expected Return of a Portfolio
	
n	 The portfolio weight is the initial fraction xi of an investor’s money invested in each asset. Port-
folio weights add up to 1.
	
xi = Value of investment i
Total value of portfolio
(11.1)

	
n	 The expected return of a portfolio is the weighted average of the expected returns of the invest-
ments within it, using the portfolio weights.
	
E [Rp] = ai xiE[Ri]
(11.3)
11.2  The Volatility of a Two-Stock Portfolio
	
n	 To find the risk of a portfolio, we need to know the degree to which stock returns move together. 
Covariance and correlation measure the co-movement of returns.
n	 The covariance between returns Ri and Rj is defined by
	
Cov (Ri, Rj) = E [(Ri - E [Ri])(Rj - E [Rj])]
(11.4)
	
	 and is estimated from historical data using
	
Cov (Ri,Rj) =
1
T - 1 a t(Ri ,t - Ri)(Rj ,t - Rj)
(11.5)
n	 The correlation is defined as the covariance of the returns divided by the standard ­deviation 
of each return. The correlation is always between -1 and +1. It represents the fraction of 
the volatility due to risk that is common to the securities.
	
Corr(Ri, Rj) =
Cov (Ri, Rj)
SD(Ri) SD(Rj)
(11.6)
	
n	 The variance of a portfolio depends on the covariance of the stocks within it.
n	 For a portfolio with two stocks, the portfolio variance is
 Var(RP) = x2
1Var(R1) + x2
2Var(R2) + 2x1x2Cov (R1, R2)
= x2
1SD(R1)2 + x2
2SD(R2)2 + 2x1x2Corr(R1, R2)SD(R1)SD(R2) (11.8 and 11.9)
n	 If the portfolio weights are positive, as we lower the covariance or correlation between the 
two stocks in a portfolio, we lower the portfolio variance.
11.3  The Volatility of a Large Portfolio
	
n	 The variance of an equally weighted portfolio is
	
Var (RP) = 1
n
 (Average Variance of the Individual Stocks)
	
+ ¢1 - 1
n≤(Average Covariance between the Stocks)
(11.12)
	
n	 Diversification eliminates independent risks. The volatility of a large portfolio results from the 
common risk between the stocks in the portfolio.
	
n	 Each security contributes to the volatility of the portfolio according to its total risk scaled by its 
correlation with the portfolio, which adjusts for the fraction of the total risk that is common to 
the portfolio.
	
SD(RP) = a i xi * SD(Ri) * Corr (Ri, RP )
(11.13)
11.4  Risk Versus Return: Choosing an Efficient Portfolio
	
n	 Efficient portfolios offer investors the highest possible expected return for a given level of risk. 
The set of efficient portfolios is called the efficient frontier. As investors add stocks to a portfo-
lio, the efficient portfolio improves.
n	 An investor seeking high expected returns and low volatility should invest only in efficient 
portfolios.
n	 Investors will choose from the set of efficient portfolios based on their risk tolerance.

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
	
n	 Investors may use short sales in their portfolios. A portfolio is short those stocks with negative 
portfolio weights. Short selling extends the set of possible portfolios.
11.5  Risk-Free Saving and Borrowing
	
n	 Portfolios can be formed by combining the risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets.
n	 The expected return and volatility for this type of portfolio is
	
 E[RxP] = rf + x(E[Rp] - rf)
(11.15)
 SD(RxP) = x SD(RP)
(11.16)
n	 The risk–return combinations of the risk-free investment and a risky portfolio lie on a 
straight line connecting the two investments.
	
n	 The goal of an investor who is seeking to earn the highest possible expected return for any level 
of volatility is to find the portfolio that generates the steepest possible line when ­combined with 
the risk-free investment. The slope of this line is called the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio.
	
Sharpe Ratio = Portfolio Excess Return
Portfolio Volatility
=
E [RP] - rf
SD(RP) 
(11.17)
	
n	 The risky portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio is called the efficient portfolio. The efficient 
portfolio is the optimal combination of risky investments independent of the investor’s appetite 
for risk. An investor can select a desired degree of risk by choosing the amount to invest in the 
efficient portfolio relative to the risk-free investment.
11.6  The Efficient Portfolio and Required Returns
	
n	 Beta indicates the sensitivity of the investment’s return to fluctuations in the portfolio’s return.
	
	 The beta of an investment with a portfolio is
	
bP
i K SD(Ri ) * Corr (Ri , RP)
SD(RP)

(11.19)
	
n	 Buying shares of security i improves the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio if its expected return exceeds 
the required return:
	
ri K rf + bP
i * (E [RP] - rf )
(11.20)
	
n	 A portfolio is efficient when E [Ri] = ri for all securities. The following relationship therefore 
holds between beta and expected returns for traded securities:
	
E [Ri] = ri K rf + beff
i
* (E [Re ff ] - rf )
(11.21)
11.7  The Capital Asset Pricing Model
	
n	 Three main assumptions underlie the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):
n	 Investors trade securities at competitive market prices (without incurring taxes or transac-
tion costs) and can borrow and lend at the risk-free rate.
n	 Investors choose efficient portfolios.
n	 Investors have homogeneous expectations regarding the volatilities, correlations, and 
expected returns of securities.
	
n	 Because the supply of securities must equal the demand for securities, the CAPM implies that 
the market portfolio of all risky securities is the efficient portfolio.
	
n	 Under the CAPM assumptions, the capital market line (CML), which is the set of portfolios 
obtained by combining the risk-free security and the market portfolio, is the set of portfolios 
with the highest possible expected return for any level of volatility.

	
n	 The CAPM equation states that the risk premium of any security is equal to the market risk 
premium multiplied by the beta of the security. This relationship is called the security market 
line (SML), and it determines the required return for an investment:
	
E [Ri] = ri = rf + bi * (E [RMkt ] - rf )
(11.22)
	
n	 The beta of a security measures the amount of the security’s risk that is common to the market 
portfolio or market risk. Beta is defined as follows:
	
bi = SD(Ri ) * Corr (Ri , RMkt)
SD (RMkt)
= Cov (Ri, RMkt)
Var (RMkt)

(11.23)
	
n	 The beta of a portfolio is the weighted-average beta of the securities in the portfolio.

The following text presents in more depth optimal portfolio choice: W. Sharpe, G. Alexander, and 
J. Bailey, Investments (Prentice Hall, 1999).
Two seminal papers on optimal portfolio choice are: H. Markowitz, “Portfolio Selection,” Journal 
of Finance 7 (March 1952): 77–91; and J. Tobin, “Liquidity Preference as Behavior Toward Risk,” 
Review of Economic Studies 25 (February 1958): 65–86. While Markowitz’s paper had the greatest 
influence, the application of mean-variance optimization to portfolio theory was developed concur-
rently by Andrew Roy (“Safety First and the Holding of Assets,” Econometrica 20 (1952): 431–449). 
For an analysis of earlier related work by Bruno de Finetti, see M. Rubinstein, “Bruno de Finetti and 
Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection,” Journal of Investment Management 4 (2006): 3–4; the issue also 
contains a translation of de Finetti’s work and comments by Harry Markowitz.
For a historical account of how researchers recognized the impact that short-sales constraints may 
have in the expected returns of assets, see M. Rubinstein, “Great Moments in Financial ­Economics: 
III. Short-Sales and Stock Prices,” Journal of Investment Management 2(1) (First Quarter 2004): 
16–31.
The insight that the expected return of a security is given by its beta with an efficient portfolio was 
first derived in the following paper: R. Roll, “A Critique of the Asset Pricing Theory’s Tests,” Journal 
of Financial Economics 4 (1977): 129–176.
The following classic papers developed the CAPM: J. Lintner, “The Valuation of Risk Assets and the 
Selection of Risky Investments in Stock Portfolios and Capital Budgets,” Review of Economics and 
Statistics 47 (February 1965): 13–37; J. Mossin, “Equilibrium in a Capital Asset Market,” Economet-
rica 34 (1966): 768–783; W. Sharpe, “Capital Asset Prices: A Theory of Market Equilibrium under 
Conditions of Risk,” Journal of Finance 19 (September 1964): 425–442; and J. Treynor, “Toward a 
Theory of the Market Value of Risky Assets,” unpublished manuscript (1961).

The Efficient Portfolio and Required Returns
	
38.	 In addition to risk-free securities, you are currently invested in the Tanglewood Fund, a broad-

a.	 What is Optima’s Sharpe Ratio?
b.	 If eBay’s stock has a volatility of 37.8% and an expected return of 9.3%, what must be its 
correlation with the Optima Fund?
c.	 If the SubOptima Fund has a correlation of 85% with the Optima Fund, what is the Sharpe

41.	 You are currently only invested in the Natasha Fund (aside from risk-free securities). It has an 
expected return of 15% with a volatility of 19%. Currently, the risk-free rate of interest is 3.2%. 
Your broker suggests that you add Hannah Corporation to your portfolio. Hannah Corporation 
has an expected return of 20%, a volatility of 60%, and a correlation of 0 with the Natasha Fund.
a.	 Is your broker right?
b.	 You follow your broker’s advice and make a substantial investment in Hannah stock so that, 
considering only your risky investments, 65% is in the Natasha Fund and 35% is in Hannah 
stock. When you tell your finance professor about your investment, he says that you made a 
mistake and should reduce your investment in Hannah. Is your finance professor right?
c.	 You decide to follow your finance professor’s advice and reduce your exposure to Hannah. 
Now Hannah represents 12.493% of your risky portfolio, with the rest in the Natasha fund. 
Is this the correct amount of Hannah stock to hold?

You proudly reply that so do you. Since you have been friends for some time, you know that 
he holds the market, as do you, and so you both are invested in this stock. Both of you care 
only about expected return and volatility. The risk-free rate is 2%, quoted as an APR based on 
a 365-day year. DRig made up 1.67% of the market portfolio before the news announcement.
a.	 On the announcement your overall wealth went up by 1.3% (assume all other price changes 
canceled out so that without DRIg, the market return would have been zero). How is your 
wealth invested?

Data Case
Your manager was so impressed with your work analyzing the return and standard deviations of the 
12 stocks from Chapter 10 that he would like you to continue your analysis.
Specifically, he wants you to update the stock portfolio by:
n	 Rebalancing the portfolio with the optimum weights that will provide the best risk and return 
combinations for the new 12-stock portfolio.
n	 Determining the improvement in the return and risk that would result from these optimum 
weights compared to the current method of equally weighting the stocks in the portfolio.
Use the Solver function in Excel to perform this analysis (the time-consuming alternative is to 
find the optimum weights by trial-and-error).
	
1.	 Begin with the equally weighted portfolio analyzed in Chapter 10. Establish the portfolio returns 
for the stocks in the portfolio using a formula that depends on the portfolio weights. Initially, 
these weights will all equal 1/12. You would like to allow the portfolio weights to vary, so you will 
need to list the weights for each stock in separate cells and establish another cell that sums the 
weights of the stocks. The portfolio returns for each month must reference these weights for Excel 
Solver to be useful.
	
2.	 Compute the values for the monthly mean return and standard deviation of the portfolio. Con-
vert these values to annual numbers (as you did in Chapter 10) for easier interpretation.
	
3.	 Compute the efficient frontier when short sales are not allowed. Use the Solver tool in Excel (on 
the Data tab in the analysis section).*  To set the Solver parameters:
a.	 Set the target cell as the cell of interest, making it the cell that computes the (annual) portfolio 
standard deviation. Minimize this value.
b.	 Establish the “By Changing Cells” by holding the Control key and clicking in each of the 12 
cells containing the weights of each stock.
c.	 Add constraints by clicking the Add button next to the “Subject to the Constraints” box. One 
set of constraints will be the weight of each stock that is greater than or equal to zero. Calcu-
late the constraints individually. A second constraint is that the weights will sum to one.
d.	Compute the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation. If the parameters are set correctly, 
you should get a solution when you click “Solve.” If there is an error, you will need to double-
check the parameters, especially the constraints.
*If the Solver tool is not available, you must load it into Excel as follows:
	 1.	 On the File Tab, click Excel Options.
	 2.	 Click Add-Ins, and then, in the Manage box, select Excel Add-ins.
	 3.	 Click Go.
	 4.	 In the Add-Ins available box, select the Solver Add-in check box, and then click OK.
	
	 Tip : If Solver Add-in is not listed in the Add-Ins available box, click Browse to locate the add-in. If 
you are prompted that the Solver Add-in is not currently installed on your computer, click Yes to 
install it.
	 5.	 After you load the Solver Add-in, the Solver command is available in the Analysis group on the Data 
tab.

	
4.	 Next, compute portfolios that have the lowest standard deviation for a target level of the expected 
return.
a.	 Start by finding the portfolio with an expected return 2% higher than that of the minimum 
variance portfolio. To do this, add a constraint that the (annual) portfolio return equals this 
target level. Click “Solve” and record the standard deviation and mean return of the solution 
(and be sure the mean return equals target—if not, check your constraint).
b.	 Repeat Step (a) raising the target return in 2% increments, recording the result for each step. 
Continue to increase the target return and record the result until Solver can no longer find a 
solution.
c.	 At what level does Solver fail to find a solution? Why?
	
5.	 Plot the efficient frontier with the constraint of no short sales. To do this, create an XY Scatter 
Plot (similar to what you did in Chapter 10), with portfolio standard deviation on the x-axis and 
the return on the y-axis, using the data for the minimum variance portfolio and the portfolios you 
computed in Step 4. How do these portfolios compare to the mean and standard deviation for 
the equally weighted portfolio analyzed in Chapter 10?
	
6.	 Redo your analysis to allow for short sales by removing the constraint that each portfolio weight 
is greater than or equal to zero. Use Solver to calculate the (annual) portfolio standard deviation 
for the minimum variance portfolio, and when the annual portfolio returns are set to 0.05, 0.1, 
0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. Plot the unconstrained efficient frontier on an XY Scatter Plot. How does 
allowing short sales affect the frontier?
	
7.	 Redo your analysis adding a new risk-free security that has a return of 0.5% (0.005) each month. 
Include a weight for this security when calculating the monthly portfolio returns. That is, there 
will now be 13 weights, one for each of the 12 stocks and one for the risk-free security. Again, 
these weights must sum to 1. Allow for short sales, and use Solver to calculate the (annual) port-
folio standard deviation when the annual portfolio returns are set to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. 
Plot the results on the same XY Scatter Plot, and in addition keep track of the portfolio weights 
of the optimal portfolio. What do you notice about the relative weights of the different stocks in 
the portfolio as you change the target return? Can you identify the tangent portfolio?

Chapter 11  Optimal Portfolio Choice and the Capital Asset Pricing Model
The CAPM with Differing  
Interest Rates
In this chapter, we assumed that investors faced the same risk-free interest rate whether 
they were saving or borrowing. In practice, investors receive a lower rate when they save 
than they must pay when they borrow. For example, short-term margin loans from a bro-
ker are often 1–2% higher than the rates paid on short-term Treasury securities. Banks, 
pension funds, and other investors with large amounts of collateral can borrow at rates that 
are generally within 1% of the rate on risk-free securities, but there is still a difference. Do 
these differences in interest rates affect the conclusions of the CAPM?
The Efficient Frontier with Differing Saving  
and Borrowing Rates
Figure 11A.1 plots the risk and return possibilities when the saving and borrowing rates dif-
fer. In this graph, rS = 3% is the rate earned on risk-free savings or lending, and rB = 6% 
is the rate paid on borrowing. Each rate is associated with a different tangent portfolio, 
labeled TS and TB, respectively. A conservative investor who desires a low-risk portfolio can 
combine the portfolio TS with saving at rate rS to achieve risk and return combinations 
along the lower green line. An aggressive investor who desires high expected returns can 
invest in the portfolio TB, using some amount of borrowed funds at rate rB. By adjusting the 
amount of borrowing, the investor can achieve risk and return combinations on the upper 
green line. The combinations on the upper line are not as desirable as the combinations that 
would result if the investor could borrow at rate rS, but the investor is unable to borrow at 
the lower rate. Finally, investors with intermediate preferences may choose portfolios on the 
portion of the red curve betweenTS and TB, which do not involve borrowing or lending.
Thus, if borrowing and lending rates differ, investors with different preferences will 
choose different portfolios of risky securities. Any portfolio on the curve from TS to TB 
might be chosen. So, the first conclusion of the CAPM—that the market portfolio is the 
unique efficient portfolio of risky investments—is no longer valid.
The Security Market Line with Differing  
Interest Rates
The more important conclusion of the CAPM for corporate finance is the security market 
line, which relates the risk of an investment to its required return. It turns out that the SML 
is still valid when interest rates differ. To see why, we make use of the following result:
A combination of portfolios on the efficient frontier of risky investments is also on the efficient 
frontier of risky investments.12
Because all investors hold portfolios on the efficient frontier between TS and TB, and 
because all investors collectively hold the market portfolio, the market portfolio must lie 
12To understand this result intuitively, note that portfolios on the efficient frontier contain no diversifiable 
risk (otherwise we could reduce risk further without lowering the expected return). But a combination of 
portfolios that contain no diversifiable risk also contains no diversifiable risk, so it is also efficient.
chapter 11 
appendix

on the frontier between TS and TB. As a result, the market portfolio will be tangent for 
some risk-free interest rate r* between rS and rB, as illustrated by the dotted line in Figure 
11A.1. Because our determination of the security market line depends only on the market 
portfolio being tangent for some interest rate, the SML still holds in the following form:
	
E[Ri] = r* + bi * (E[RMkt] - r*)	
(11A.1)
That is, the SML holds with some rate r* between rS and rB in place of rf . The rate r* 
depends on the proportion of savers and borrowers in the economy. But even without 
knowing those proportions, because saving and borrowing rates tend to be close to each 
other, r* must be in a narrow range and we can use Eq. 11A.1 to provide reasonable esti-
mates of expected returns.13
We can make a similar argument regarding the choice of which risk-free rate to use. As 
discussed in Chapter 6, the risk-free rate varies with the investment horizon according to 
the yield curve. When an investor chooses her optimal portfolio, she will do so by find-
ing the tangent line using the risk-free rate that corresponds to her investment horizon. If 
all investors have the same horizon, then the risk-free rate corresponding to that horizon 
will determine the SML. If investors have different horizons (but still have homogeneous 
expectations), then Eq. 11A.1 will hold for some r* on the current yield curve, with the 
rate depending on the proportion of investors with each investment horizon.14
13This result was shown by M. Brennan, “Capital Market Equilibrium with Divergent Borrowing and 
Lending Rates,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 6 (1971): 1197–1205.
14We can generalize the arguments in this section further to settings in which there is no risk-free asset; 
see Fischer Black, “Capital Market Equilibrium with Restricted Borrowing,” Journal of Business 45 (1972): 
444–455, and Mark Rubinstein, “The Fundamental Theorem of Parameter-Preference ­Security 
­Valuation,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 1 (1973): 61–69.

will invest in portfolio TS, and

TS and TB. Because all ­investors 
choose portfolios on the efficient 
frontier from TS to TB, the market 
portfolio is on the efficient fron-
tier between them. The dotted

rate r* that can be used in the

estimating the Cost 
of Capital
eVaLUatING INVeStMeNt OppOrtUNItIeS reQUIreS ­FinanCial 
managers to estimate the cost of capital. For example, when executives at Intel 
­Corporation evaluate a capital investment project, they must estimate the appropri-
ate cost of capital for the project in order to determine its NPV. The cost of capital 
should include a risk premium that compensates Intel’s investors for taking on the risk 
of the new project. How can Intel estimate this risk premium and, therefore, the cost 
of capital?
In the last two chapters, we have developed a method to answer this question—
the Capital Asset Pricing Model. In this chapter, we will apply this knowledge to compute 
the cost of capital for an investment opportunity. We begin the chapter by focusing on 
an investment in the firm’s stock. We show how to estimate the firm’s equity cost of 
capital, ­including the practical details of identifying the market portfolio and estimat-
ing equity betas. Next, we develop methods to estimate the firm’s debt cost of ­capital, 
based either on its yield or on its beta. We then consider ­investing in a new project, and 
show how to estimate a project’s cost of capital based on the unlevered cost of capital 
of comparable firms. Finally, we introduce the concept of the weighted-average cost of 
capital as a tool for evaluating levered projects and investments.

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
	
12.1	 The Equity Cost of Capital
Recall that the cost of capital is the best expected return available in the market on invest-
ments with similar risk. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) provides a practical way 
to identify an investment with similar risk. Under the CAPM, the market portfolio is a 
well-diversified, efficient portfolio representing the non-diversifiable risk in the economy. 
Therefore, investments have similar risk if they have the same sensitivity to market risk, as 
measured by their beta with the market portfolio.
So, the cost of capital of any investment opportunity equals the expected return of avail-
able investments with the same beta. This estimate is provided by the Security ­Market Line 
equation of the CAPM, which states that, given the beta, bi, of the investment ­opportunity, 
its cost of capital is:
The CAPM Equation for the Cost of Capital (Security Market Line)
	
ri = rf + bi * (E[RMkt] - rf )

(12.1)
In other words, investors will require a risk premium comparable to what they would earn 
taking the same market risk through an investment in the market portfolio.
As our first application of the CAPM, consider an investment in the firm’s stock. As we 
demonstrated in Chapter 9, to value a share of stock, we need to calculate the equity cost of 
capital. We can do so using Eq. 12.1 if we know the beta of the firm’s stock.
Example 12.1
Computing the Equity Cost of Capital
Problem
Suppose you estimate that Disney’s stock (DIS) has a volatility of 20% and a beta of 1.25. A 
similar ­process for Chipotle (CMG) yields a volatility of 30% and a beta of 0.55. Which stock 
carries more total risk? Which has more market risk? If the risk-free interest rate is 3% and you 
estimate the market’s expected return to be 8%, calculate the equity cost of capital for Disney 
and Chipotle. Which company has a higher cost of equity capital?
Solution
Total risk is measured by volatility; therefore, Chipotle stock has more total risk than Disney. 
­Systematic risk is measured by beta. Disney has a higher beta, so it has more market risk than Chipotle.
Given Disney’s estimated beta of 1.25, we expect the price for Disney’s stock to move by 
1.25% for every 1% move of the market. Therefore, Disney’s risk premium will be 1.25 times 
the risk premium of the market, and Disney’s equity cost of capital (from Eq. 12.1) is
rDIS = 3% + 1.25 * (8% - 3%) = 3% + 6.25% = 9.25%
Chipotle has a lower beta of 0.55. The equity cost of capital for Chipotle is
rCMG = 3% + 0.55 * (8% - 3%) = 3% + 2.75% = 5.75%
Because market risk cannot be diversified, it is market risk that determines the cost of capital; 
thus Disney has a higher cost of equity capital than Chipotle, even though it is less volatile.

Risk premium for security i
While the calculations in Example 12.1 are straightforward, to implement them we need a 
number of key inputs. In particular, we must do the following:
n	 Construct the market portfolio, and determine its expected excess return over the risk-
free interest rate
n	 Estimate the stock’s beta, or sensitivity to the market portfolio

	
12.2  The Market Portfolio	
441
We explain how to estimate these inputs in more detail in the next two sections.
Concept Check	
1.	 According to the CAPM, we can determine the cost of capital of an investment by comparing it to 
what portfolio?
	
2.	 What inputs do we need to estimate a firm’s equity cost of capital using the CAPM?
	
12.2	 The Market Portfolio
To apply the CAPM, we must identify the market portfolio. In this section we examine 
how the market portfolio is constructed, common proxies that are used to represent the 
market portfolio, and how we can estimate the market risk premium.
Constructing the Market Portfolio
Because the market portfolio is the total supply of securities, the proportions of each secu-
rity should correspond to the proportion of the total market that each security represents. 
Thus, the market portfolio contains more of the largest stocks and less of the smallest 
stocks. Specifically, the investment in each security i is proportional to its market capital-
ization, which is the total market value of its outstanding shares:
	
MVi = (Number of Shares of i Outstanding) * (Price of i per Share)
(12.2)
We then calculate the portfolio weights of each security as follows:
	
xi =
Market Value of i
Total Market Value of All Securities in the Portfolio =
MVi
aj MVj

(12.3)
A portfolio like the market portfolio, in which each security is held in proportion to its 
market capitalization, is called a value-weighted portfolio. A value-weighted portfolio 
is also an equal-ownership portfolio: We hold an equal fraction of the total number of 
shares outstanding of each security in the portfolio. This last observation implies that even 
when market prices change, to maintain a value-weighted portfolio, we do not need to 
trade unless the number of shares outstanding of some security changes. Because very little 
trading is required to maintain it, a value-weighted portfolio is also a passive portfolio.
Market Indexes
If we focus our attention on U.S. stocks, then rather than construct the market portfolio 
ourselves, we can make use of several popular market indexes that try to represent the per-
formance of the U.S. stock market.
Examples of Market Indexes.  A market index reports the value of a particular portfolio 
of securities. The S&P 500 is an index that represents a value-weighted portfolio of 500 of 
the largest U.S. stocks.1 The S&P 500 was the first widely publicized value-weighted index 
and is the standard portfolio used to represent “the market portfolio” when using the 
1Standard and Poor’s periodically replaces stocks in the index (on average about 20–25 per year). While 
size is one criterion, S&P tries to maintain appropriate representation of different sectors of the economy 
and chooses firms that are leaders in their industries. Also, starting in 2005, the value weights in the index 
are based on the number of shares actually available for public trading, referred to as its free float.

442	
Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
CAPM in practice. Even though the S&P 500 includes only 500 of the roughly 5000 
­publicly traded stocks in the U.S., because the S&P 500 includes the largest stocks, it 
­represents almost 80% of the U.S. stock market in terms of market capitalization.
More recently created indexes, such as the Wilshire 5000, provide a value-weighted 
index of all U.S. stocks listed on the major stock exchanges.2 While more complete than 
the S&P 500, and therefore more representative of the overall market, its returns are very 
similar; between 1990 and 2015, the correlation between their weekly returns was nearly 
99%. Given this similarity, many investors view the S&P 500 as an adequate measure of 
overall U.S. stock market performance.
The most widely quoted U.S. stock index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), 
which consists of a portfolio of 30 large industrial stocks. While somewhat representative, 
the DJIA clearly does not represent the entire market. Also, the DJIA is a price-weighted 
2The Wilshire 5000 began with approximately 5000 stocks when it was first published in 1974 but since 
then the number of stocks in the index has changed over time with U.S. equity markets. Similar indices 
are the Dow Jones U.S. Total Market Index and the S&P Total Market Index.
Value-Weighted Portfolios and Rebalancing
Because they are passive, value-weighted portfolios are very efficient from a transaction cost perspective because there is no 
need to rebalance the portfolio weights in the face of price changes. To see why, consider the following example. Suppose we 
invest $50,000 in a value-weighted portfolio of General Electric, Home Depot, and Cisco, as shown below:
Note that our investment in each stock is proportional to each stock’s market capitalization. In addition, the number of shares 
purchased is proportional to each stock’s outstanding shares.
Now suppose that the price of GE’s stock increases to $30 per share and Home Depot’s stock price drops to $80 per share. 
Let’s compute the new value weights as well as the effect on our portfolio:
Note that although the value weights have changed, the value of our investment in each stock has also changed and remains 
proportional to each stock’s market cap. For example, our weight in GE’s stock is $30,000/$52,000 = 57.7%, matching 
its market weight. Thus, there is no need to trade in response to price changes to maintain a value-weighted portfolio. 
­Rebalancing is only required if firms issue or retire shares, or if the set of firms represented by the portfolio changes.

12.2  The Market Portfolio

(rather than value-weighted) portfolio. A price-weighted portfolio holds an equal number 
of shares of each stock, independent of their size. Despite being nonrepresentative of the 
entire market, the DJIA remains widely cited because it is one of the oldest stock market 
indexes (first published in 1884).
Investing in a Market Index.  In addition to capturing the performance of the U.S. mar-
ket, the S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 are both easy to invest in. Many mutual fund 
companies offer funds, called index funds, that invest in these portfolios. In ­addition, 
exchange-traded funds represent these portfolios. An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a 
security that trades directly on an exchange, like a stock, but represents ownership in a 
portfolio of stocks. For example, Standard and Poor’s Depository Receipts (SPDR, nick-
named “spiders”) trade on the American Stock Exchange (symbol SPY) and represent own-
ership in the S&P 500. Vanguard’s Total Stock Market ETF (symbol VTI, nicknamed 
“viper”) is based on the Wilshire 5000 index. By investing in an index or an exchange-
traded fund, an individual investor with only a small amount to invest can easily achieve 
the benefits of broad diversification.
Although practitioners commonly use the S&P 500 as the market portfolio in the 
CAPM, no one does so because of a belief that this index is actually the market portfolio. 
Instead they view the index as a market proxy—a portfolio whose return they believe 
closely tracks the true market portfolio. Of course, how well the model works will depend 
on how closely the market proxy actually tracks the true market portfolio. We will return 
to this issue in Chapter 13.
The Market Risk Premium
Recall that a key ingredient to the CAPM is the market risk premium, which is the expected 
excess return of the market portfolio: E [RMkt] - rf . The market risk premium provides 
the benchmark by which we assess investors’ willingness to hold market risk. Before we 
can estimate it, we must first discuss the choice of the risk-free interest rate to use in the 
CAPM.
Determining the Risk-Free Rate.  The risk-free interest rate in the CAPM model cor-
responds to the risk-free rate at which investors can both borrow and save. We gener-
ally determine the risk-free saving rate using the yields on U.S. Treasury securities. Most 
investors, however, must pay a substantially higher rate to borrow funds. In mid-2015, 
for example, even the highest credit quality borrowers had to pay almost 0.35% over U.S. 
Treasury rates on short-term loans. Even if a loan is essentially risk-free, this premium 
compensates lenders for the difference in liquidity compared with an investment in Trea-
suries. As a result, practitioners sometimes use rates from the highest quality corporate 
bonds in place of Treasury rates in Eq. 12.1.
While U.S. Treasuries are free from default risk, they are subject to interest rate risk 
unless we select a maturity equal to our investment horizon. Which horizon should we 
choose when selecting an interest rate from the yield curve? Again, we can extend the 
CAPM to allow for different investment horizons, and the risk-free rate we choose should 
correspond to the yield for an “average” horizon.3 When surveyed, the vast majority of 
3As explained in the Chapter 11 appendix, the precise rate to use depends on investors’ horizons and their 
propensity to borrow or save. As there is no easy way to know these characteristics, judgment is required. 
Throughout this chapter, we’ll try to make clear these gray areas and highlight common practices.

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
large firms and financial analysts report using the yields of long-term (10- to 30-year) 
bonds to determine the risk-free interest rate.4
The Historical Risk Premium.  One approach to estimating the market risk premium, 
E[RMkt] - rf , is to use the historical average excess return of the market over the risk-free 
interest rate.5 With this approach, it is important to measure historical stock returns over 
the same time horizon as that used for the risk-free interest rate.
Because we are interested in the future market risk premium, we face a trade-off in 
selecting the amount of data we use. As we noted in Chapter 10, it takes many years of data 
to produce even moderately accurate estimates of expected returns. Yet very old data may 
have little relevance for investors’ expectations of the market risk premium today.
Table 12.1 reports excess returns of the S&P 500 versus one-year and ten-year Treasury 
rates, based on data since 1926, as well as just the last 50 years. For each time period, note 
the lower risk premium when we compare the S&P 500 to longer-term Treasuries. This 
difference primarily arises because, historically, the yield curve has tended to be upward 
sloping, with long-term interest rates higher than short-term rates.
Table 12.1 also suggests that the market risk premium has declined over time, with the 
S&P 500 showing a significantly lower excess return over the past 50 years than over the 
full sample. There are several potential explanations for this decline. First, more investors 
participate in the stock market today, so that the risk can be shared more broadly. Second, 
financial innovations such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have greatly reduced 
the costs of diversifying. Third, except for the recent increase in the wake of the 2008 
financial crisis, the overall volatility of the market has declined over time. All of these rea-
sons may have reduced the risk of holding stocks, and so diminished the premium inves-
tors require. Most researchers and analysts believe that future expected returns for the 
market are likely to be closer to these more recent historical numbers, in a range of about 
4–6% over Treasury bills (and 3–5% over longer term bonds).6

­Financial Practice and Education 8 (1998): 13–28.

12.3  Beta Estimation	
445
A Fundamental Approach.  Using historical data to estimate the market risk premium 
suffers from two drawbacks. First, despite using 50 years (or more) of data, the standard 
errors of the estimates are large (e.g., even using data from 1926, the 95% confidence 
interval for the excess return is { 4.3%). Second, because they are backward looking, we 
cannot be sure they are representative of current expectations.
As an alternative, we can take a fundamental approach toward estimating the market risk 
premium. Given an assessment of firms’ future cash flows, we can estimate the expected 
return of the market by solving for the discount rate that is consistent with the current 
level of the index. For example, if we use the constant expected growth model presented in 
Chapter 9, the expected market return is equal to
	
rMkt = Div1
P0
+ g = Dividend Yield + Expected Dividend Growth Rate
(12.4)
While this model is highly inaccurate for an individual firm, the assumption of constant 
expected growth is more reasonable when considering the overall market. If, for instance, 
the S&P 500 has a current dividend yield of 2%, and we assume that both earnings and 
dividends are expected to grow 6% per year, this model would estimate the expected return 
of the S&P 500 as 8%. Following such methods, researchers generally report estimates in 
the 3–5% range for the future equity risk premium.7

12.3	 Beta Estimation
Having identified a market proxy, the next step in implementing the CAPM is to deter-
mine the security’s beta, which measures the sensitivity of the security’s returns to those of 
the market. Because beta captures the market risk of a security, as opposed to its diversifi-
able risk, it is the appropriate measure of risk for a well-diversified investor.
Using Historical Returns
Ideally, we would like to know a stock’s beta in the future; that is, how sensitive will its 
future returns be to market risk. In practice, we estimate beta based on the stock’s historical 
sensitivity. This approach makes sense if a stock’s beta remains relatively stable over time, 
which appears to be the case for most firms.
Many data sources provide estimates of beta based on historical data. Typically, these 
data sources estimate correlations and volatilities from two to five years of weekly or 
monthly returns and use the S&P 500 as the market portfolio. Table 10.6 on page 377 
shows estimated betas for a number of large firms in different industries.
7See e.g., E. Fama and K. French, “The Equity Premium,” Journal of Finance 57 (2002): 637–659; and 
J. Siegel, “The Long-Run Equity Risk Premium,” CFA Institute Conference Proceedings Points of Inflec-
tion: New Directions for Portfolio Management (2004). Similarly, L. Pástor, M. Sinha, and B. Swaminathan 
report a 2–4% implied risk premium over 10-year Treasuries [“Estimating the Intertemporal Risk-Return 
Tradeoff Using the Implied Cost of Capital,” Journal of Finance 63 (2008): 2859–2897].

446	
Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
As we discussed in Chapter 10, the differences in betas reflect the sensitivity of each 
firm’s profits to the general health of the economy. For example, Apple, Autodesk, and 
other technology stocks have high betas (well over 1) because demand for their products 
usually varies with the business cycle: Companies and consumers tend to invest in tech-
nology when times are good, but they cut back on these expenditures when the economy 
slows. In contrast, the demand for personal and household products has very little relation 
to the state of the economy. Firms producing these goods, such as Procter & Gamble, tend 
to have very low betas (near 0.5).
Let’s look at Cisco Systems stock as an example. Figure 12.1 shows the monthly returns 
for Cisco and the monthly returns for the S&P 500 from the beginning of 2000 to 2015. 
Note the overall tendency for Cisco to have a high return when the market is up and a 
low return when the market is down. Indeed, Cisco tends to move in the same direction 
as the market, but with greater amplitude. The pattern suggests that Cisco’s beta is larger 
than 1.
Rather than plot the returns over time, we can see Cisco’s sensitivity to the market even 
more clearly by plotting Cisco’s excess return as a function of the S&P 500 excess return, as 
shown in Figure 12.2. Each point in this figure represents the excess return of Cisco and 
the S&P 500 from one of the months in Figure 12.1. For example, in November 2002, 
Cisco was up 33.4% and the S&P 500 was up 6.1% (while risk-free Treasuries returned 
only 0.12%). Once we have plotted each month in this way, we can then plot the best-­
fitting line drawn through these points.8
8By “best fitting,” we mean the line that minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from the line. In 
Excel, it can be found by adding a linear trendline to the chart.

12.3  Beta Estimation	
447
Identifying the Best-Fitting Line
As the scatterplot makes clear, Cisco’s returns have a positive covariance with the mar-
ket: Cisco tends to be up when the market is up, and vice versa. Moreover, from the 
best-fitting line, we can see visually that a 10% change in the market’s return corre-
sponds to around a 15% change in Cisco’s return. That is, Cisco’s return moves near 
one and a half times that of the overall market, and Cisco’s estimated beta is about 1.5. 
More generally,
Beta corresponds to the slope of the best-fitting line in the plot of the security’s excess returns ­versus 
the market excess return.9
To understand this result fully, recall that beta measures the market risk of a security—
the percentage change in the return of a security for a 1% change in the return of the mar-
ket portfolio. The best-fitting line in Figure 12.2 captures the components of a security’s 
return that we can explain based on market risk, so its slope is the security’s beta. Note 
though, that in any individual month, the security’s returns will be higher or lower than 
the best-fitting line. Such deviations from the best-fitting line result from risk that is not 
related to the market as a whole. These deviations are zero on average in the graph, as the 
points above the line balance out the points below the line. They represent firm-specific 
risk that is diversifiable and that averages out in a large portfolio.
9The slope can be calculated using Excel’s SLOPE() function, or by displaying the equation for the trendline 
on the chart (R2 is the square of the correlation between the returns). See appendix for further details.

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Using Linear Regression
The statistical technique that identifies the best-fitting line through a set of points is called 
linear regression. In Figure 12.2, linear regression corresponds to writing the excess return 
of a security as the sum of three components:10
	
(Ri - rf ) = ai + bi (RMkt - rf ) + ei
(12.5)
The first term, ai, is the constant or intercept term of the regression. The second term, 
bi(RMkt - rf ), represents the sensitivity of the stock to market risk. For example, if the 
market’s return is 1% higher, there is a bi% increase in the security’s return. We refer 
to the last term, ei, as the error (or residual) term: It represents the deviation from the 
best-fitting line and is zero on average (or else we could improve the fit). This error term 
corresponds to the diversifiable risk of the stock, which is the risk that is unrelated to the 
market.
If we take expectations of both sides of Eq. 12.5 and rearrange the result, because the 
average error is zero (that is, E[ei] = 0), we get
	
E[Ri] =
rf + bi(E [RMkt] - rf )
+
ai
(12.6)
The constant ai, referred to as the stock’s alpha, measures the historical performance of 
the security relative to the expected return predicted by the security market line—it is the 
distance the stock’s average return is above or below the SML. Thus, we can interpret ai as 
a risk-adjusted measure of the stock’s historical performance.11 According to the CAPM, 
ai should not be significantly different from zero.
Using Excel’s regression data analysis tool for the monthly returns from 2000–2015, 
Cisco’s estimated beta is 1.57, with a 95% confidence interval from 1.3 to 1.8. Assuming 
Cisco’s sensitivity to market risk will remain stable over time, we would expect Cisco’s beta 
to be in this range in the near future. With this estimate in hand, we are ready to estimate 
Cisco’s equity cost of capital.
10In the language of regression, the stock’s excess return is the dependent (or y) variable, and the market’s 
excess return is the independent (or x) variable.
11When used in this way, ai is often referred to as Jensen’s alpha. It can be calculated using the 
­INTERCEPT() function in Excel (see appendix). Using this regression as a test of the CAPM was intro-
duced by F. Black, M. Jensen, and M. Scholes in “The Capital Asset Pricing Model: Some Empirical 
Tests.” In M. Jensen, ed., Studies in the Theory of Capital Markets (Praeger, 1972).
Example 12.2
Using Regression Estimates to Estimate the Equity Cost of Capital
Problem
Suppose the risk-free interest rate is 3%, and the market risk premium is 5%. What range for 
Cisco’s equity cost of capital is consistent with the 95% confidence interval for its beta?
Solution
Using the data from 2000 to 2015, and applying the CAPM equation, the estimated beta of 1.53 
implies an equity cost of capital of 3% + 1.57 * 5% = 10.85% for Cisco. But our estimate is 
uncertain, and the 95% confidence interval for Cisco’s beta of 1.3 to 1.8 gives a range for Cisco’s 
equity cost of capital from 3% + 1.3 * 5% = 9.5% to 3% + 1.8 * 5% = 12%.

12.4  The Debt Cost of Capital	
449
The estimate of Cisco’s alpha from the regression is -0.33%. In other words, given its 
beta, Cisco’s average monthly return was 0.33% lower than required by the security market 
line. The standard error of the alpha estimate is about 0.6%, however, so that statistically the 
estimate is not significantly different from zero. Alphas, like expected returns, are difficult to 
estimate with much accuracy without a very long data series. Moreover, the alphas for indi-
vidual stocks have very little persistence.12 Thus, although Cisco’s return underperformed its 
required return over this time period, it may not necessarily continue to do so.
In this section we have provided an overview of the main methodology for estimating a 
security’s market risk. In the appendix to this chapter, we discuss some additional practical 
considerations and common techniques for forecasting beta.

1.	 How can you estimate a stock’s beta from historical returns?
	
2.	 How do we define a stock’s alpha, and what is its interpretation?
	
12.4	 The Debt Cost of Capital
In the preceding sections, we have shown how to use the CAPM to estimate the cost of capi-
tal of a firm’s equity. What about a firm’s debt—what expected return is required by a firm’s 
creditors? In this section, we’ll consider some of the main methods for estimating a firm’s 
debt cost of capital, the cost of capital that a firm must pay on its debt. In addition to being 
useful information for the firm and its investors, we will see in the next section that knowing 
the debt cost of capital will be helpful when estimating the cost of capital of a project.
Debt Yields Versus Returns
Recall from Chapter 6 that the yield to maturity of a bond is the IRR an investor will 
earn from holding the bond to maturity and receiving its promised payments. Therefore, 
if there is little risk the firm will default, we can use the bond’s yield to maturity as an 
estimate of investors’ expected return. If there is a significant risk that the firm will default 
on its obligation, however, the yield to maturity of the firm’s debt, which is its promised 
return, will overstate investors’ expected return.
12Indeed, over the period 1996–2000, Cisco’s return had an alpha of 3% per month, significantly 
­outperforming its required return, but as we have seen this positive alpha did not forecast superior future 
returns.
Why Not Estimate Expected Returns Directly?
If the CAPM requires us to use historical data to estimate beta 
and determine a security’s expected return (or an investment’s 
cost of capital), why not just use the security’s historical aver-
age return as an estimate for its expected return instead? This 
method would certainly be simpler and more direct.
As we saw in Chapter 10, however, it is extremely difficult 
to infer the average return of individual stocks from histori-
cal data. For example, consider Cisco’s stock, which had an 
average annualized return of 3.3%, and a volatility of 37%, 
based on monthly data from 2000–2015. Given 15 years of 
data, the standard error of our estimate of the expected return 
is 37%> 215 = 9.6%, leading to a 95% confidence interval 
of 3.3% { 19%! Even with 100 years of data, the confidence 
bounds would be { 7.4%. Of course, Cisco has not existed 
for 100 years, and even if it had, the firm today would bear 
little resemblance today to what it was like 100 years ago.
At the same time, using the methods described in this 
section, we can infer beta from historical data reasonably 
accurately even with as little as two years of data. In theory 
at least, the CAPM can provide much more accurate esti-
mates of expected returns for stocks than we could obtain 
from their historical average return.

450	
Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
To understand the relationship between a debt’s yield and its expected return, consider 
a one-year bond with a yield to maturity of y. Thus, for each $1 invested in the bond today, 
the bond promises to pay $(1 + y) in one year. Suppose, however, the bond will default 
with probability p, in which case bond holders will receive only $(1 + y - L), where L 
represents the expected loss per $1 of debt in the event of default. Then the expected return 
of the bond is13
	
rd = (1 - p)y + p( y - L) = y - pL
	
= Yield to Maturity - Prob(default) * Expected Loss Rate
(12.7)
The importance of these adjustments will naturally depend on the riskiness of the bond, 
with lower-rated (and higher-yielding) bonds having a greater risk of default. Table 12.2 
shows average annual default rates by debt rating, as well as the peak default rates experi-
enced during recessionary periods. To get a sense of the impact on the expected return to 
debt holders, note that the average loss rate for unsecured debt is about 60%. Thus, for a 
B-rated bond, during average times the expected return to debt holders would be approxi-
mately 0.055 * 0.60 = 3.3% below the bond’s quoted yield. On the other hand, outside 
of recessionary periods, given its negligible default rate the yield on an AA-rated bond 
provides a reasonable estimate of its expected return.
13While we derived this equation for a one-year bond, the same formula holds for a multi-year bond 
assuming a constant yield to maturity, default rate, and loss rate. We can also express the loss in default 
according to the bond’s recovery rate R: (1 + y -L) = (1 + y)R, or L = (1 + y)(1-R).
Using the Debt Yield as Its Cost of Capital
While firms often use the yield on their debt to estimate 
their debt cost of capital, this approximation is reasonable 
only if the debt is very safe. Otherwise, as we explained in 
Chapter 6, the debt’s yield—which is based on its prom-
ised payments—will overstate the true expected return from 
holding the bond once default risk is taken into account.
Consider, for example, that in mid-2009 long-term 
bonds issued by AMR Corp. (parent ­company of ­American 
­Airlines) had a yield to maturity exceeding 20%. Because 
these bonds were very risky, with a CCC rating, their yield 
greatly overstated their expected return given AMR’s sig-
nificant default risk. Indeed, with risk-free rates of 3% and 
a market risk premium of 5%, an expected return of 20% 
would imply a debt beta greater than 3 for AMR, which is 
unreasonably high, and higher even than the equity betas of 
many firms in the industry.
Again, the problem is the yield is computed using the 
promised debt payments, which in this case were quite dif-
ferent from the actual payments investors were expecting: 
When AMR filed for bankruptcy in 2011, bondholders 
lost close to 80% of what they were owed. The methods 
described in this section can ­provide a much better estimate 
of a firm’s debt cost of ­capital in cases like AMR’s when the 
likelihood of default is significant.

12.4  The Debt Cost of Capital	
451
Debt Betas
Alternatively, we can estimate the debt cost of capital using the CAPM. In principle it 
would be possible to estimate debt betas using their historical returns in the same way 
that we estimated equity betas. However, because bank loans and many corporate bonds 
are traded infrequently if at all, as a practical matter we can rarely obtain reliable data for 
the returns of individual debt securities. Thus, we need another means of estimating debt 
betas. We will develop a method for estimating debt betas for an individual firm using 
stock price data in Chapter 21. We can also approximate beta using estimates of betas of 
bond indices by rating category, as shown in Table 12.3. As the table indicates, debt betas 
tend to be low, though they can be significantly higher for risky debt with a low credit rat-
ing and a long maturity.
Example 12.3
Estimating the Debt Cost of Capital
Problem
In mid-2015, homebuilder KB Home had outstanding 6-year bonds with a yield to maturity of 
6% and a B rating. If corresponding risk-free rates were 1%, and the market risk premium is 5%, 
estimate the expected return of KB Home’s debt.
Solution
Given the low rating of debt, we know the yield to maturity of KB Home’s debt is likely to 
significantly overstate its expected return. Using the average estimates in Table  12.2 and an 
expected loss rate of 60%, from Eq. 12.7 we have
rd = 6% - 5.5%(0.60) = 2.7%
Alternatively, we can estimate the bond’s expected return using the CAPM and an estimated 
beta of 0.26 from Table 12.3. In that case,
rd = 1% + 0.26(5%) = 2.3%
While both estimates are rough approximations, they both confirm that the expected return 
of KB Home’s debt is well below its promised yield.

*Note that these are average debt betas across industries. We would expect debt betas to be lower (higher) for 
industries that are less (more) exposed to market risk. One simple way to approximate this difference is to scale 
the debt betas in Table 12.3 by the relative asset beta for the industry (see Figure 12.4 on page 457).

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Note that both of the methods discussed in this section are approximations; more 
­specific information about the firm and its default risk could obviously improve them. 
Also, we have focused on the debt cost of capital from the perspective of an outside inves-
tor. The effective cost of debt to the firm can be lower once the tax deductibility of interest 
payments is considered. We will return to this issue in Section 12.6.
Concept Check	
1.	 Why does the yield to maturity of a firm’s debt generally overestimate its debt cost of capital?
	
2.	 Describe two methods that can be used to estimate a firm’s debt cost of capital.
	
12.5	 A Project’s Cost of Capital
In Chapter 8, we explained how to decide whether or not to undertake a project. Although 
the project’s cost of capital is required to make this decision, we indicated then that we 
would explain later how to estimate it. We are now ready to fulfill this promise. As we did 
in Chapter 8, we will assume the project will be evaluated on its own, separate from any 
financing decisions. Thus, we will assume that the project will be purely equity financed 
(there will be no debt used to finance it) and consider project financing in Section 12.6.
In the case of a firm’s equity or debt, we estimate the cost of capital based on the histori-
cal risks of these securities. Because a new project is not itself a publicly traded security, this 
approach is not possible. Instead, the most common method for estimating a project’s beta 
is to identify comparable firms in the same line of business as the project we are considering 
undertaking. Indeed, the firm undertaking the project will often be one such comparable 
firm (and sometimes the only one). Then, if we can estimate the cost of capital of the assets 
of comparable firms, we can use that estimate as a proxy for the project’s cost of capital.
All-Equity Comparables
The simplest setting is one in which we can find an all-equity financed firm (i.e., a firm 
with no debt) in a single line of business that is comparable to the project. Because the firm 
is all equity, holding the firm’s stock is equivalent to owning the portfolio of its underlying 
assets. Thus, if the firm’s average investment has similar market risk to our project, then we 
can use the comparable firm’s equity beta and cost of capital as estimates for beta and the 
cost of capital of the project.
Example 12.4
Estimating the Beta of a Project from a Single-Product Firm
Problem
You have just graduated with an MBA, and decide to pursue your dream of starting a line of 
women’s designer clothes and accessories. You are working on your business plan, and have 
decided that Michael Kors is the kind of company you would like to build. To develop your 
financial plan, estimate the cost of capital of this opportunity assuming a risk-free rate of 3% and 
a market risk premium of 5%.
Solution
Checking Google: Finance, we find that Michael Kors Holdings Limited (KORS) has almost no 
debt, and an estimated beta of 1.13. Using KORS’s beta as the estimate of the project beta, we 
can apply Eq. 12.1 to estimate the cost of capital of this investment opportunity as
rproject = rf + bKORS (E [RMkt] - r) = 3% + 1.13 * 5% = 8.65%

	
12.5  A Project’s Cost of Capital	
453
Levered Firms as Comparables
The situation is a bit more complicated if the comparable firm has debt. In that case, the 
cash flows generated by the firm’s assets are used to pay both debt and equity holders. As a 
result, the returns of the firm’s equity alone are not representative of the underlying assets; 
in fact, because of the firm’s leverage, the equity will often be much riskier. Thus, the beta 
of a levered firm’s equity will not be a good estimate of the beta of its assets and of our 
project.
How can we estimate the beta of the comparable firm’s assets in this case? As shown in 
Figure 12.3 we can recreate a claim on the firm’s assets by holding both its debt and equity 
simultaneously. Because the firm’s cash flows will either be used to pay debt or equity hold-
ers, by holding both securities we are entitled to all of the cash flows generated by the firm’s 
assets. The return of the firm’s assets is therefore the same as the return of a portfolio of 
the firm’s debt and equity combined. For the same reason, the beta of the firm’s assets will 
match the beta of this portfolio.
The Unlevered Cost of Capital
As we saw in Chapter 11, the expected return of a portfolio is equal to the weighted aver-
age of the expected returns of the securities in the portfolio, where the weights correspond 
to the relative market values of the different securities held. Thus, a firm’s asset cost of 
capital or unlevered cost of capital, which is the expected return required by the firm’s 
investors to hold the firm’s underlying assets, is the weighted average of the firm’s equity 
and debt costs of capital:
Asset or Unlevered
Cost of Capital
= ¢Fraction of Firm Value
Financed by Equity ≤¢Equity Cost
of Capital ≤+¢Fraction of Firm Value
Financed by Debt
≤¢Debt Cost
of Capital ≤
Thus, assuming your business has a similar sensitivity to market risk as KORS, you can esti-
mate the appropriate cost of capital as 8.65%. In other words, rather than investing in the new 
business, you could invest in the fashion industry simply by buying KORS stock. Given this 
alternative, to be attractive, the new investment must have an expected return at least equal to 
that of KORS, which from the CAPM is 8.65%.

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Writing this out, if we let E and D be the total market value of equity and debt of the com-
parable firm, with equity and debt costs of capital rE and rD, then we can estimate a firm’s 
asset or unlevered cost of capital rU as follows:14

rU =
E
E + D
 rE +

(12.8)
Unlevered Beta.  Because the beta of a portfolio is the weighted-average of the betas of the 
securities in the portfolio, we have a similar expression for the firm’s asset or unlevered 
beta, which we can use to estimate the beta of our project:
Asset or Unlevered Beta
	
bU =
E
E + D
 bE +
D
E + D
 bD
(12.9)
Let’s apply these formulas in an example.
14For simplicity, we assume here that the firm in question maintains a constant debt-equity ratio, so that 
the weights E/(E + D) and D/(E + D) are fixed. As a result, Eq. 12.8 and Eq. 12.9 hold even in the pres-
ence of taxes. See Chapter 18 for details and an analysis of settings with a changing leverage ratio.
Example 12.5
Unlevering the Cost of Capital
Problem
Your firm is considering expanding its household products division. You identify Procter & 
Gamble (PG) as a firm with comparable investments. Suppose PG’s equity has a market capital-
ization of $144 billion and a beta of 0.57. PG also has $37 billion of AA-rated debt outstanding, 
with an average yield of 3.1%. Estimate the cost of capital of your firm’s investment given a risk-
free rate of 3% and a market risk-premium of 5%.
Solution
Because investing in this division is like investing in PG’s assets by holding its debt and equity, 
we can estimate our cost of capital based on PG’s unlevered cost of capital. First, we estimate 
PG’s equity cost of capital using the CAPM as rE = 3% + 0.57(5%) = 5.85%. Because PG’s 
debt is highly rated, we approximate its debt cost of capital using the debt yield of 3.1%. Thus, 
PG’s unlevered cost of capital is
rU =
144
144 + 37
 5.85% +
37
144 + 37
 3.1% = 5.29%
Alternatively, we can estimate PG’s unlevered beta. Given its high rating, if we assume PG’s 
debt beta is zero we have
bU =
144
144 + 37
 0.57 +
37
144 + 37
 0 = 0.453
Taking this result as an estimate of the beta of our project, we can compute our project’s cost of 
capital from the CAPM as rU = 3% + 0.453(5%) = 5.27%.
The slight difference in rU using the two methods arises because in the first case, we assumed 
the expected return of PG’s debt is equal to its promised yield of 3.1%, while in the second case, 
we assumed the debt has a beta of zero, which implies an expected return equal to the risk-free 
rate of 3% according to the CAPM. The truth is somewhere between the two results, as PG’s 
debt is not completely risk-free.

	
12.5  A Project’s Cost of Capital	
455
Cash and Net Debt.  Sometimes firms maintain large cash balances in excess of their oper-
ating needs. This cash represents a risk-free asset on the firm’s balance sheet, and reduces 
the average risk of the firm’s assets. Often, we are interested in the risk of the firm’s under-
lying business operations, separate from its cash holdings. That is, we are interested in the 
risk of the firm’s enterprise value, which we defined in Chapter 2 as the combined market 
value of the firm’s equity and debt, less any excess cash. In that case, we can measure the 
leverage of the firm in terms of its net debt:
	
Net Debt = Debt - Excess Cash and Short@Term Investments
(12.10)
The intuition for using net debt is that if the firm holds $1 in cash and $1 in risk-free debt, 
then the interest earned on the cash will equal the interest paid on the debt. The cash flows 
from each source cancel each other, just as if the firm held no cash and no debt.15
Note that if the firm has more cash than debt, its net debt will be negative. In this case, 
its unlevered beta and cost of capital will exceed its equity beta and cost of capital, as the 
risk of the firm’s equity is mitigated by its cash holdings.
15We can also think of the firm’s enterprise value V in terms of a portfolio of equity and debt less cash: 
V = E + D - C, where C is excess cash. In that case, the natural extension of Eq. 12.9 is
bU =
E
E + D - C
 bE +
D
E + D - C
 bD -
C
E + D - C
 bC
(and similarly for Eq. 12.8). The shortcut of using net debt is equivalent if the firm’s cash investments 
and debt have similar market risk, or if the debt beta reflects the combined risk of the firm’s debt and cash 
positions.
Example 12.6
Cash and Beta
Problem
In mid-2015, Microsoft Corporation had a market capitalization of $340 billion, $35 billion in 
debt, and $96 billion in cash. If its estimated equity beta was 0.87, estimate the beta of Micro-
soft’s underlying business enterprise.
Solution
Microsoft has net debt = (35 - 96) = -$61 billion. Therefore, Microsoft’s enterprise value is 
(340 - 61) = $279 billion, which is the total value of its underlying business on a debt-free 
basis and excluding cash. Assuming Microsoft’s debt and cash investments are both risk-free, we 
can estimate the beta of this enterprise value as
bU =
E
E + D
 bE +
D
E + D
 bD =
340
340 - 61
 0.87 +
-61
340 - 61
 0 = 1.06
Note that in this case, Microsoft’s equity is less risky than its underlying business activities due 
to its cash holdings.
Industry Asset Betas
Now that we can adjust for the leverage of different firms to determine their asset betas, 
it is possible to combine estimates of asset betas for multiple firms in the same industry or 
line of business. Doing so is extremely useful, as it will enable us to reduce our estimation 
error and improve the accuracy of the estimated beta for our project.

456	
Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Figure 12.4 shows estimates of industry asset betas for U.S. firms. Note that businesses 
that are less sensitive to market and economic conditions, such as utilities and household 
product firms, tend to have lower asset betas than more cyclical industries, such as autos 
and high technology.
Concept Check	
1.	 What data can we use to estimate the beta of a project?
	
2.	 Why does the equity beta of a levered firm differ from the beta of its assets?
Example 12.7
Estimating an Industry Asset Beta
Problem
Consider the following data for U.S. department stores in mid-2009, showing the equity beta, 
ratio of net debt to enterprise value (D/V), and debt rating for each firm. Estimate the average 
and median asset beta for the industry.
Solution
Note that D/V provides the fraction of debt financing, and (1 - D/V ) the fraction of equity 
financing, for each firm. Using the data for debt betas from Table 12.3, we can apply Eq. 12.9 
for each firm. For example, for Dillard’s:
bU =
E
E + D
 bE +
D
E + D
 bD = (1 - 0.59)2.38 + (0.59)0.26 = 1.13
Doing this calculation for each firm, we obtain the following estimates:
The large differences in the firms’ equity betas are mainly due to differences in leverage. The 
firms’ asset betas are much more similar, suggesting that the underlying businesses in this 
­industry have similar market risk. By combining estimates from several closely related firms in 
this way, we can get a more accurate estimate of the beta for investments in this industry.

12.6	 Project Risk Characteristics and Financing
Thus far, we have evaluated a project’s cost of capital by comparing it with the unlevered 
assets of firms in the same line of business. We have also assumed the project itself is 
­unlevered—specifically, it is to be financed solely with equity. In this section we con-
sider why and how we may need to adjust our analysis to account for differences between 
­projects, both in terms of their risk and their mode of financing.
Differences in Project Risk
Firm asset betas reflect the market risk of the average project in a firm. But individual 
projects may be more or less sensitive to market risk. A financial manager evaluating a new 
investment should try to assess how this project might compare with the average project.
As an example, conglomerate 3M has both a health care division and a computer dis-
play and graphics division. These divisions are likely to have very different market risks 
(note the difference in asset betas between healthcare supplies and computer peripherals 
in ­Figure 12.4). 3M’s own asset beta will represent an average of the risk of these and 3M’s 
other divisions, and would not be an appropriate measure of risk for projects in either divi-
sion. Instead, financial managers should evaluate projects based on asset betas of firms that 
concentrate in a similar line of business. Thus, for multi-divisional firms, identifying a set

The plot shows the median, as well as upper and lower quartiles, for estimated asset betas of S&P 1500 firms in selected 
industries. Note the low asset betas for less cyclical industries such as utilities and household products, versus the 
much higher asset betas of technology firms, asset management, and capital-intensive cyclical industries (like autos and 
construction).

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
of “pure play” comparables for each division is helpful in estimating appropriate divisional 
costs of capital.
Even within a firm with a single line of business, some projects obviously have dif-
ferent market risk characteristics from the firm’s other activities. For example, if Cisco 
Systems were considering whether to buy or lease an office building to expand its 
headquarters, the cash flows associated with this decision have very different market 
risk from the cash flows associated with its typical project of developing networking 
­software and hardware, and it should use a different cost of capital. (Indeed, we will 
discuss the risk and appropriate cost of capital associated with leasing in more detail in 
Chapter 25.)
Another factor that can affect the market risk of a project is its degree of operating 
leverage, which is the relative proportion of fixed versus variable costs. Holding fixed the 
cyclicality of the project’s revenues, a higher proportion of fixed costs will increase the sen-
sitivity of the project’s cash flows to market risk and raise the project’s beta. To account for 
this effect, we should assign projects with an above-average proportion of fixed costs, and 
thus greater-than-average operating leverage, a higher cost of capital.
Example 12.8
Operating Leverage and Beta
Problem
Consider a project with expected annual revenues of $120 and costs of $50 in perpetuity. The 
costs are completely variable, so that the profit margin of the project will remain constant. 
Suppose the project has a beta of 1.0, the risk-free rate is 5%, and the expected return of the 
market is 10%. What is the value of this project? What would its value and beta be if the 
revenues continued to vary with a beta of 1.0, but the costs were instead completely fixed at 
$50 per year?
Solution
The expected cash flow of the project is $120 - $50 = $70 per year. Given a beta of 1.0, the 
appropriate cost of capital is r = 5% + 1.0(10% - 5%) = 10%. Thus, the value of the project if 
the costs are completely variable is $70/10% = $700.
If instead the costs are fixed, then we can compute the value of the project by discounting the 
revenues and costs separately. The revenues still have a beta of 1.0, and thus a cost of capital of 
10%, for a present value of $120/10% = $1200. Because the costs are fixed, we should discount 
them at the risk-free rate of 5%, so their present value is $50/5% = $1000. Thus, with fixed 
costs the project has a value of only $1200 - $1000 = $200.
What is the beta of the project now? We can think of the project as a portfolio that is long 
the revenues and short the costs. The project’s beta is the weighted average of the revenue and 
cost betas, or
bP =
R
R - C
 bR -
C
R - C
 bC =
1200
1200 - 1000
 1.0 -
1000
1200 - 1000
 0 = 6.0
Given a beta of  6.0, the project’s cost of capital with fixed costs is r = 5% + 6.0(10% -5%) = 35%. 
To verify this result, note that the present value of the expected profits is then $70/35% = 200. 
As this example shows, increasing the proportion of fixed versus variable costs can significantly 
increase a project’s beta (and reduce its value).

	
12.6  Project Risk Characteristics and Financing	
459
Financing and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
In Section 12.5, we presumed the project we are evaluating is all-equity financed; that 
is, the firm does not plan any additional borrowing as a result of the project. What is 
the importance of this financing assumption, and how might the project’s cost of capital 
change if the firm does use leverage to finance the project?
The complete answer to this question will be the topic of Part 5, where we consider the 
many implications of the firm’s choice of financing policy. We provide a quick preview here 
of some key results.
Perfect Capital Markets.  Let’s begin by recalling our discussion in Chapter 3 where we 
argued that with perfect capital markets—by which we mean no taxes, transactions costs, 
or other frictions—the choice of financing does not affect the cost of capital or NPV of a 
project. Rather, a project’s cost of capital and NPV are solely determined by its free cash 
flows. In this setting then, our assumption regarding the project’s financing is innocuous. 
Its cost of capital would be the same whether, and to what extent, it is financed in part 
with debt. The intuition for this result, which we gave in Chapter 3, is that in a competi-
tive and perfect market, all financing transactions are zero-NPV transactions that do not 
affect value.
Taxes—A Big Imperfection.  When market frictions do exist, the firm’s decision regard-
ing how to finance the project may have consequences that affect the project’s value. Per-
haps the most important example comes from the corporate tax code, which allows the 
firm to deduct interest payments on debt from its taxable income. As we saw in Chapter 5, 
if the firm pays interest rate r on its debt, then once the tax deduction is accounted for, the 
net cost to the firm is given by
	
Effective after@tax interest rate = r(1 - tC)
(12.11)
where tC is the firm’s corporate tax rate.
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital.  As we will see in Chapter 15, when the firm 
finances its own project using debt, it will benefit from the interest tax deduction. One way 
Adjusting for Execution Risk
When a company launches a new product or makes some 
other type of new investment, it is often subject to a greater 
degree of execution risk, which is the risk that—due to 
missteps in the firm’s execution—the project may fail to 
generate the forecasted cash flows. For example, there may 
be a greater chance of manufacturing delays or marketing 
mistakes.
Firms sometimes try to adjust for this risk by assigning a 
higher cost of capital to new projects. Such adjustments are 
generally incorrect, as this execution risk is typically firm-
specific risk, which is diversifiable. (Intuitively, as a share-
holder investing in many firms, you can diversify the risk 
that some firms may suffer execution failures while others 
do not.) The cost of capital for the project should only 
depend on its sensitivity to market-wide risks.
Of course, this does not mean that we should ignore 
execution risk. We should capture this risk in the expected 
cash flows generated by the project. For example, if a ­pro­ject 
is expected to generate a free cash flow of $100 next year, 
but there is a 20% chance it might fail and ­generate noth-
ing, then our expected free cash flow is only $80. Thus, 
while the cost of capital remains the same, the expected 
free cash flow that we discount will be lower the greater the 
degree of execution risk.
Common Mistake

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Shelagh M. Glaser is vice president of 
Finance and Group Controller of the ­Client 
Computing Group at Intel Corporation. 
Her ­responsibilities include profit and loss 
­forecasting, reporting and controls.
QUESTION: Does Intel set the discount 
rate at the corporate or project level?
ANSWER: We typically set the discount 
rate at the corporate level. As a company, 
Intel makes a broad set of products that 
sell into similar markets so one hurdle 
rate makes sense for our core business. 
To justify an investment, every project 
has to earn or exceed that level of return 
for our shareholders.
We may use a different discount rate for mergers and 
acquisitions. For example, recently we’ve done more soft-
ware acquisitions. That industry is very different from 
semi-conductors and has different risk factors, so we take 
those considerations into account to set the hurdle rate.
QUESTION: How does Intel compute the cost of capital for 
new investment opportunities?
ANSWER: We reexamine our weighted average cost of capi-
tal (WACC) each year to see that we have the right inputs 
and if any have changed: What is the current market risk 
premium? Are we using the right risk-free rate? How should 
we weight historical data? We use the CAPM to determine 
beta but consider whether to continue using the 5-year 
weekly beta or to change to a daily or monthly beta in the 
calculation. We also look at the latest studies from aca-
demia on what the inputs should be.
Once we have estimated the WACC, we think about 
the appropriate hurdle rate for our circumstances. We have 
not changed the hurdle rate in recent years—even though 
the WACC may have changed—and continue to use a 
­hurdle rate that is above the WACC. This higher hurdle 
rate reflects our ability to time our investments and helps us 
choose projects that maximize our expected returns. Intel 
has more projects with returns above our hurdle than we 
can invest in, so assessing opportunity cost is a significant 
aspect of decision making. We may invest in some projects 
with NPVs below the hurdle rate if they are of strategic 
importance.
QUESTION: How do project-specific 
considerations affect Intel’s cost of capital 
calculation?
ANSWER: When deciding whether to 
invest billions in wafer fabrication plants, 
Intel considers both the physical plant 
and the product line. We calculate the 
margin we would need from the product 
and develop a comprehensive set of met-
rics to justify the large capital investment. 
Typically we use our standard hurdle rate 
and also look at risk factors and the tim-
ing of the product launch. Intel’s business 
is driven by the economics of Moore’s 
Law, allowing us to double transistors 
every 2 years. Each generation of new 
technology creates cost reductions that 
enable new fabrication plants to clear the hurdle rate. These 
plants produce our leading-edge product, which earn our 
highest margins. To get a premium price, our customers 
require a product that takes advantage of the performance 
and power efficiency of the latest technology.
QUESTION: Has the 2008 financial crisis affected how you 
evaluate investment opportunities?
ANSWER: In 2008, the market was very depressed. We 
continued making R&D investments and reduced spend-
ing in other areas, such as marketing and short-term 
promotion. Cutting R&D would have left us with a gap 
in our product line in several years, because product devel-
opment cycles typically run 4 years. In this industry, not 
keeping the R&D machine flowing, to boost short-term 
earnings, will harm the company’s long-term viability. 
R&D is critical to our fundamental business model, which 
may require long-term decisions that negatively impact 
short-term results.
Intel has a long history of investing to maintain perfor-
mance leadership during downturns. Intel carries almost no 
debt. Our capital policy is to maintain sufficient cash for fab-
rication plants and multiple years of R&D expenses, to avoid 
depending on capital markets to finance ongoing operations. 
A painful experience in the 1980s, when Intel’s access to cap-
ital markets was curtailed, highlighted how this conservative 
capital policy pays off. Going into this crisis with no debt 
and an extremely strong cash position has served us well.

of including this benefit when calculating the NPV is by using the firm’s effective after-tax 
cost of capital, which we call the weighted-average cost of capital or WACC:16
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
	
rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD(1 - tC )
(12.12)
Comparing the weighted average cost of capital, rwacc, with the unlevered cost of capital, 
rU, defined in Eq. 12.8, note that the WACC is based on the effective after-tax cost of 
debt, whereas the unlevered cost of capital is based on the firm’s pretax cost of debt. The 
unlevered cost of capital is therefore also referred to as the pretax WACC. Let’s review the 
key distinctions between them:
	
1.	 The unlevered cost of capital (or pretax WACC) is the expected return investors 
will earn holding the firm’s assets. In a world with taxes, it can be used to evaluate 
an all-equity financed project with the same risk as the firm.
	
2.	 The weighted average cost of capital (or WACC) is the effective after-tax cost of 
capital to the firm. Because interest expense is tax deductible, the WACC is less than 
the expected return of the firm’s assets. In a world with taxes, the WACC can be 
used to evaluate a project with the same risk and the same financing as the firm itself.
Comparing Eq. 12.8 with Eq. 12.12, given a target leverage ratio we can also calculate the 
WACC as follows:
	
rwacc = rU -
D
E + D
 tC rD
(12.13)
That is, the WACC is equal to the unlevered cost of capital less the tax savings associated 
with debt. This version of the WACC formula allows us to take advantage of the 
*“The WACC Fallacy: The Real Effects of Using a Unique Discount 
Rate,” Journal of Finance 70 (2015): 1253–1285.
16The Chapter 18 appendix contains a formal derivation of this formula. Eq. 12.12 assumes the inter-
est on debt equals its expected return rD, a reasonable approximation if the debt has low risk and trades 
near par. If not, we can estimate the after-tax debt cost of capital more precisely as (rD - tc rD), where 
rD = (current interest expense)/(market value of debt), the current yield of the debt.
Using a Single Cost of Capital in Multi-Divisional Firms
Many firms combine business units with widely different 
market risk. Yet some of them use a single cost of capital 
to evaluate projects throughout the organization. Using the 
same cost of capital for projects that have different riskiness, 
is, of course, a mistake, and will result in the firm taking 
on too many risky projects and too few safer projects. That 
is, when the same cost of capital is used for all investment 
opportunities, regardless of their riskiness, riskier projects 
will be discounted at too low a cost of capital, making nega-
tive NPV investments appear to be positive NPV and be 
accepted. Similarly, less risky projects will be discounted at 
too high a cost of capital, and so may be erroneously rejected.
Because survey evidence suggests that this mistake is quite 
common, Professors Philipp Krüger, Augustin Landier and 
David Thesmar* looked at the behavior of conglomerates and 
found evidence that they were making this mistake. For each 
conglomerate, they identified the most important division, 
what they termed the core-division. They then demonstrated 
that, on average, conglomerates invest relatively less in divi-
sions that are less risky than the core-division, and relatively 
more in divisions that are more risky than the core-division.

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Example 12.9
Estimating the WACC
Problem
Dunlap Corp. has a market capitalization of $100 million, and $25 million in outstanding debt. 
Dunlap’s equity cost of capital is 10%, and its debt cost of capital is 6%. What is Dunlap’s unlevered 
cost of capital? If its corporate tax rate is 40%, what is Dunlap’s weighted average cost of capital?
Solution
Dunlap’s unlevered cost of capital, or pretax WACC, is given by
rU =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD = 100
125
 10% + 25
125
 6% = 9.2%
Thus, we would use a cost of capital of 9.2% to evaluate all-equity financed projects with the 
same risk as Dunlap’s assets.
Dunlap’s weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, can be calculated using either Eq. 12.12 
or 12.13:
 rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD (1 - tC ) = 100
125
 10% + 25
125
 6%(1 - 40%) = 8.72%
 = rU -
D
E + D
 tC rD = 9.2% - 25
125
 (40%)6% = 8.72%
We can use the WACC of 8.72% to evaluate projects with the same risk and the same mix of 
debt and equity financing as Dunlap’s assets. It is a lower rate than the unlevered cost of capital 
to reflect the tax deductibility of interest expenses.
industry asset betas we estimated in Section 12.5 when determining the WACC.17 We’ll 
return to consider the WACC in additional detail, as well other implications of the 
firm’s financing decisions, in Part 5.
17Eq. 12.13 has an additional advantage: Because we are just using it to estimate the tax shield, we can use 
the current yield of the debt (rD) in place of rD when debt is risky (see footnote 17).
Concept Check	
1.	 Why might projects within the same firm have different costs of capital?
	
2.	 Under what conditions can we evaluate a project using the firm’s weighted ­average cost of 
capital?
	
12.7	 Final Thoughts on Using the CAPM
In this chapter, we have developed an approach to estimating a firm’s or project’s cost of 
capital using the CAPM. Along the way, we have had to make a number of practical choices, 
approximations, and estimations. And these decisions were on top of the assumptions of the 
CAPM itself, which are not completely realistic. At this point, you might be wondering: 
How reliable, and thus worthwhile, are the results that we obtain following this approach?
While there is no definitive answer to this question, we offer several thoughts. First, the 
types of approximations that we used to estimate the cost of capital are no different from 

	
MyFinanceLab	
463
our other approximations throughout the capital budgeting process. In particular, the rev-
enue and other cash flow projections we must make when valuing a stock or an investment 
in a new product are likely to be far more speculative than any we have made in estimating 
the cost of capital. Thus, the imperfections of the CAPM may not be critical in the context 
of capital budgeting and corporate finance, where errors in estimating project cash flows 
are likely to have a far greater impact than small discrepancies in the cost of capital.
Second, in addition to being very practical and straightforward to implement, the 
CAPM-based approach is very robust. While perhaps not perfectly accurate, when the 
CAPM does generate errors, they tend to be small. Other methods, such as relying on aver-
age historical returns, can lead to much larger errors.
Third, the CAPM imposes a disciplined process on managers to identify the cost of 
capital. There are few parameters available to manipulate in order to achieve a desired 
result, and the assumptions made are straightforward to document. As a result, the CAPM 
may make the capital budgeting process less subject to managerial manipulation than if 
managers could set project costs of capital without clear justification.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, even if the CAPM model is not perfectly accu-
rate, it gets managers to think about risk in the correct way. Managers of widely held corpora-
tions should not worry about diversifiable risk, which shareholders can easily eliminate in 
their own portfolios. They should focus on, and be prepared to compensate investors for, 
the market risk in the decisions that they make.
Thus, despite its potential flaws, there are very good reasons to use the CAPM as a 
basis for calculating the cost of capital. In our view, the CAPM is viable, especially when 
measured relative to the effort required to implement a more sophisticated model (such as 
the one we will develop in Chapter 13). Consequently, it is no surprise that the CAPM 
remains the predominant model used in practice to determine the cost of capital.
While the CAPM is likely to be an adequate and practical approach for capital budget-
ing, you may still wonder how reliable its conclusions are for investors. For example, is 
holding the market index really the best strategy for investors, or can they do better by 
trading on news, or hiring a professional fund manager? We consider these questions in 
Chapter 13.
Concept Check	
1.	 Which errors in the capital budgeting process are likely to be more important than discrepancies 
in the cost of capital estimate?
	
2.	 Even if the CAPM is not perfect, why might we continue to use it in corporate finance?
12.1  The Equity Cost of Capital
	
n	 Given a security’s beta, we can estimate its cost of capital using the CAPM equation for the 
security market line:
	
ri = rf + bi * (E [RMkt] - rf )
(12.1)

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
12.2  The Market Portfolio
	
n	 To implement the CAPM, we must (a) construct the market portfolio, and determine its 
expected excess return over the risk-free interest rate, and (b) estimate the stock’s beta, or sensi-
tivity to the market portfolio.
	
n	 The market portfolio is a value-weighted portfolio of all securities traded in the market. Accord-
ing to the CAPM, the market portfolio is efficient.
	
n	 In a value-weighted portfolio, the amount invested in each security is proportional to its ­market 
capitalization.
	
n	 A value-weighted portfolio is also an equal-ownership portfolio. Thus, it is a passive portfolio, 
meaning no rebalancing is necessary due to daily price changes.
	
n	 Because the true market portfolio is difficult if not impossible to construct, in practice we use a 
proxy for the market portfolio, such as the S&P 500 or Wilshire 5000 indices.
	
n	 The risk-free rate in the security market line should reflect an average of the risk-free ­borrowing 
and lending rates. Practitioners generally choose the risk-free rate from the yield curve based on 
the investment horizon.
	
n	 While the historical return of the S&P 500 has been about 7.7% more than one-year ­Treasuries 
since 1926, research suggests that future excess returns are likely to be lower. Since 1965, the 
average excess return of the S&P 500 has been 5% over one-year Treasuries, and 3.9% over ten-
year Treasuries.
12.3  Beta Estimation
	
n	 Beta measures a security’s sensitivity to market risk. Specifically, beta is the expected change 
(in %) in the return of a security given a 1% change in the return of the market portfolio.
	
n	 To estimate beta, we often use historical returns. Beta corresponds to the slope of the ­best-fitting 
line in the plot of a security’s excess returns versus the market’s excess returns.
	
n	 If we regress a stock’s excess returns against the market’s excess returns, the intercept is the 
stock’s alpha. It measures how the stock has performed historically relative to the security mar-
ket line.
	
n	 Unlike estimating an average return, reliable beta estimates can be obtained with just a few years 
of data.
	
n	 Betas tend to remain stable over time, whereas alphas do not seem to be persistent.
12.4  The Debt Cost of Capital
	
n	 Because of default risk, the debt cost of capital, which is its expected return to investors, is less 
than its yield to maturity, which is its promised return.
	
n	 Given annual default and expected loss rates, the debt cost of capital can be estimated as
	
rd = Yield to Maturity - Prob(default) * Expected Loss Rate
(12.7)
	
n	 We can also estimate the expected return for debt based on its beta using the CAPM. ­However, 
beta estimates for individual debt securities are hard to obtain. In practice, estimates based on 
the debt’s rating may be used.
12.5  A Project’s Cost of Capital
	
n	 We can estimate a project’s cost of capital based on the asset or unlevered cost of capital of 
comparable firms in the same line of business. Given a target leverage ratio based on the market 
value of the firm’s equity and debt, the firm’s unlevered cost of capital is:
	
rU =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD
(12.8)
	
n	 We can also estimate the beta of a project as the unlevered beta of a comparable firm:
	
bU =
E
E + D
 bE +
D
E + D
 bD
(12.9)

	
n	 Because cash holdings will reduce a firm’s equity beta, when unlevering betas we can use the 
firm’s net debt, which is debt less excess cash.
	
n	 We can reduce estimation error by averaging unlevered betas for several firms in the same 
industry to determine an industry asset beta.
12.6  Project Risk Characteristics and Financing
	
n	 Firm or industry asset betas reflect the market risk of the average project in that firm or ­industry. 
Individual projects may be more or less sensitive to the overall market. Operating leverage is 
one factor that can increase a project’s market risk.
	
n	 We should not adjust the cost of capital for project-specific risks (such as execution risk). These 
risks should be reflected in the project’s cash flow estimates.
	
n	 An unlevered cost of capital can be used to evaluate an equity-financed project. If the proj-
ect will be financed in part with debt, the firm’s effective after-tax cost of debt is less than its 
expected return to investors. In that case, the weighted average cost of capital can be used:
	
rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD (1 - tC)
(12.12)
	
n	 The WACC can also be estimated using industry asset betas as follows:
	
rwacc = rU -
D
E + D
 tC rD
(12.13)
12.7  Final Thoughts on Using the CAPM
	
n	 While the CAPM is not perfect, it is straightforward to use, relatively robust, hard to manipu-
late, and correctly emphasizes the importance of market risk. As a result, it is the most popular 
and best available method to use for capital budgeting.

Suppose the risk-free rate is 2% and the market risk premium is 4%.
a.	 Estimate the value of each division.
b.	 Estimate Weston’s current equity beta and cost of capital. Is this cost of capital useful for 
valuing Weston’s projects? How is Weston’s equity beta likely to change over time?
	
*24.	 Harrison Holdings, Inc. (HHI) is publicly traded, with a current share price of $38 per share. 
HHI has 21 million shares outstanding, as well as $68 million in debt. The founder of HHI, 
Harry Harrison, made his fortune in the fast food business. He sold off part of his fast food 
empire and purchased a professional hockey team. HHI’s only assets are the hockey team, 
together with 50% of the outstanding shares of Harry’s Hotdogs restaurant chain. Harry’s 
Hotdogs (HDG) has a market capitalization of $813 million and an enterprise value of 
$1.08 billion. After a little research, you find that the average asset beta of other fast food 
restaurant chains is 0.74. You also find that the debt of HHI and HDG is highly rated, and 
so you decide to estimate the beta of both firms’ debt as zero. Finally, you do a regression 
analysis on HHI’s historical stock returns in comparison to the S&P 500 and estimate an 
equity beta of 1.37. Given this information, estimate the beta of HHI’s investment in the 
hockey team.
	
25.	 Your company operates a steel plant. On average, revenues from the plant are $41 million per 
year. All of the plants costs are variable costs and are consistently 78% of revenues, including 
energy costs associated with powering the plant, which represent one quarter of the plant’s 
costs, or an average of $8 million per year. Suppose the plant has an asset beta of 1.13, the risk-
free rate is 4%, and the market risk premium is 4%. The tax rate is 33%, and there are no other 
costs.
a.	 Estimate the value of the plant today assuming no growth.
b.	 Suppose you enter a long-term contract which will supply all of the plant’s energy needs for 
a fixed cost of $3 million per year (before tax). What is the value of the plant if you take this 
contract?
c.	 How would taking the contract in (b) change the plant’s cost of capital? Explain.

of capital is 8%, and the corporate tax rate is 35%.
a.	 What is Unida’s unlevered cost of capital?
b.	 What is Unida’s after-tax debt cost of capital?
c.	 What is Unida’s weighted average cost of capital?
	
27.	 You would like to estimate the weighted average cost of capital for a new airline business. 
Based on its industry asset beta, you have already estimated an unlevered cost of capital for

its debt cost of capital will be 6%. If its corporate tax rate is 33%, what is your estimate of its 
WACC?

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Data Case
You work in Walt Disney Company’s corporate finance and treasury department and have just been 
assigned to the team estimating Disney’s WACC. You must estimate this WACC in preparation for 
a team meeting later today. You quickly realize that the information you need is readily available 
online.
	
1.	 Go to finance.yahoo.com. Under the “Investing Tab” and then “Market Overview,” you will 
find the yield to maturity for ten-year Treasury bonds listed as “10 Yr Bond(%).” Collect this 
number as your risk-free rate.
	
2.	 In the box next to the “Get Quotes” button, type Walt Disney’s ticker symbol (DIS) and press 
enter. Once you see the basic information for Disney, find and click “Key Statistics” on the left 
side of the screen. From the key statistics, collect Disney’s market capitalization (its market value 
of equity), enterprise value (market-value equity + net debt), cash, and beta.
	
3.	 To get Disney’s cost of debt and the market value of its long-term debt, you will need the price 
and yield to maturity on the firm’s existing long-term bonds. Go to finra-markets.­morningstar​
.com. Under “Market Data,” select “Bonds.” Under “Search,” click “Corporate,” and type ­Disney’s 
ticker symbol. A list of Disney’s outstanding bond issues will appear. Assume that Disney’s policy 
is to use the expected return on noncallable ten-year obligations as its cost of debt. Find the  
noncallable bond issue that is at least 10 years from maturity. (Hint : You will see a column titled 
“Callable”; make sure the issue you choose has “No” in this column. Bonds may appear on mul-
tiple pages.) Find the credit rating and yield to maturity for your chosen bond issue (it is in the 
column titled “Yield”). Hold the mouse over the table of Disney’s bonds and right-click. Select 
“Export to Microsoft Excel.” (Note that this option is available in IE, but may not be in other 
browsers.) An Excel spreadsheet with all of the data in the table will appear.
	
4.	 You now have the price for each bond issue, but you need to know the size of the issue. Return-
ing to the Web page, click “Walt Disney Company” in the first row. This brings up a Web page 
with all of the information about the bond issue. Scroll down until you find “Amount Outstand-
ing” on the right side. Noting that this amount is quoted in thousands of dollars (e.g., $60,000 
means $60 million = $60,000,000), record the issue amount in the appropriate row of your 
spreadsheet. Repeat this step for all of the bond issues.
	
5.	 The price for each bond issue in your spreadsheet is reported as a percentage of the bond’s par 
value. For example, 104.50 means that the bond issue is trading at 104.5% of its par value. You 
can calculate the market value of each bond issue by multiplying the amount outstanding by 
(Price , 100). Do so for each issue and then calculate the total of all the bond issues. This is the 
market value of Disney’s debt.
	
6.	 Compute the weights for Disney’s equity and debt based on the market value of equity and 
­Disney’s market value of debt, computed in Step 5.
	
7.	 Calculate Disney’s cost of equity capital using the CAPM, the risk-free rate you collected in step 
1, and a market risk premium of 5%.
	
8.	 Assuming that Disney has a tax rate of 35%, calculate its after-tax debt cost of capital.
	
9.	 Calculate Disney’s WACC.
	
10.	 Calculate Disney’s net debt by subtracting its cash (collected in Step 2) from its debt. ­Recalculate 
the weights for the WACC using the market value of equity, net debt, and enterprise value. 
­Recalculate Disney’s WACC using the weights based on the net debt. How much does it change?
	
11.	 How confident are you of your estimate? Which implicit assumptions did you make during your 
data collection efforts?

	
Chapter 12  Appendix:  Practical Considerations When Forecasting Beta	
471
As discussed in Section 12.3, we can estimate stock betas in practice by regressing past 
stock returns on returns of the market portfolio. Several practical considerations arise when 
doing so. Important choices in estimating beta include (1) the time horizon used, (2) the 
index used as the market portfolio, (3) the method used to extrapolate from past betas to 
future betas, and (4) the treatment of outliers in the data.
Time Horizon
When estimating beta by using past returns, there is a trade-off regarding which time hori-
zon to use to measure returns. If we use too short a time horizon, our estimate of beta will 
be unreliable. If we use very old data, they may be unrepresentative of the current market 
risk of the security. For stocks, common practice is to use at least two years of weekly 
return data or five years of monthly return data.18
The Market Proxy
The CAPM predicts that a security’s expected return depends on its beta with regard to 
the market portfolio of all risky investments available to investors. As mentioned earlier, in 
practice the S&P 500 is used as the market proxy. Other proxies, such as the NYSE Com-
posite Index (a value-weighted index of all NYSE stocks), the Wilshire 5000 index of all 
U.S. stocks, or an even broader market index that includes both equities and fixed-income 
securities, are sometimes used as well. When evaluating international stocks, it is common 
practice to use a country or international market index. It is important to remember, how-
ever, that the market risk premium used in Eq. 12.1 must reflect the choice of the market 
proxy. For example, a lower risk premium should be used if the market proxy includes 
fixed-income securities.
Beta Variation and Extrapolation
The estimated beta for a firm will tend to vary over time. For example, Figure 12A.1 shows 
variation in an estimate of Cisco’s beta from 1999–2015. Much of this variation is likely 
due to estimation error. Thus, we should be suspicious of estimates that are extreme relative 
to historical or industry norms; in fact, many practitioners prefer to use average industry 
asset betas rather than individual stock betas (see Figure 12.4) in order to reduce estimation 
error. In addition, evidence suggests that betas tend to regress toward the average beta of 
1.0 over time.19 For both of these reasons, many practitioners use adjusted  betas, 
18While daily returns would provide even more sample points, we often do not use them due to the 
­concern—especially for smaller, less liquid stocks—that short-term factors might influence daily returns 
that are not representative of the longer-term risks affecting the security. Ideally, we should use a return 
interval equal to our investment horizon. The need for sufficient data, however, makes monthly returns 
the longest practical choice.

The estimation methodologies of five data providers appear in Table  12A.1. Each 
employs a unique methodology, which leads to differences in the reported betas.
Outliers
The beta estimates we obtain from linear regression can be very sensitive to outliers, which 
are returns of unusually large magnitude.20 As an example, Figure 12A.2 shows a scatterplot 
of Genentech’s monthly returns versus the S&P 500 for 2002–2004. Based on these returns, 
we estimate a beta of 1.21 for Genentech. Looking closely at the monthly returns, however, 
we find two data points with unusually large returns: In April 2002, Genentech’s stock price 
fell by almost 30%, and in May 2003, Genentech’s stock price rose by almost 65%. In each 
case the extreme moves were a reaction to Genentech’s ­announcement of news related to

Changing the Index to Improve the Fit
Because we can use regression analysis to estimate beta, it is 
often incorrectly assumed that a higher goodness of fit will lead 
to more accurate results. This goodness of fit is measured by 
the R-squared of the regression, which is equal to the square of 
the correlation between the stock’s and market’s excess returns.
For example, our regression of Cisco’s returns would 
show a much higher R-squared if we used the NASDAQ 
100 index, which has a much heavier concentration of 
­technology stocks, in place of the S&P 500. But ­remember, 
the goal of the regression analysis is to determine Cisco’s 
­sensitivity to market risk. Because the NASDAQ 100 index 
itself is not well-diversified, it does not capture market risk. 
Thus, Cisco’s beta with respect to the NASDAQ 100 is not 
a meaningful assessment of its market risk.
Common Mistake
new drug development. In April 2002, Genentech reported a setback in the development of 
psoriasis drug Raptiva. In May 2003, the company reported the ­successful clinical trial of its 
anticancer drug Avastin. These two returns more likely represent firm-specific rather than 
market-wide risk. But because these large returns happened to occur during months when 
the market also moved in the same direction, they bias the estimate of beta that results from 
a standard regression. If we redo the regression replacing Genentech’s returns during these 
two months with the average return of similar biotechnology firms during the same months, 
we obtain a much lower estimate of 0.60 for ­Genentech’s beta, as shown in Figure 12A.2. 
This latter estimate is probably a much more accurate assessment of Genentech’s true mar-
ket risk during this period.
There may be other reasons to exclude certain historical data as anomalous when esti-
mating beta. For example, some practitioners advocate ignoring data from 1998–2001 to 
avoid distortions related to the technology, media, and telecommunications speculative 
bubble.21 A similar concern could be raised with regard to the performance of financial 
21For example, see A. Annema and M. H. Goedhart, “Better Betas,” McKinsey on Finance (Winter 2003):

Chapter 12  Estimating the Cost of Capital
Given data on past stock returns and interest rates, it is relatively easy to estimate beta using 
Excel. We begin by computing the excess returns for both the stock and the market for the 
desired historical period. Here we illustrate the calculation used for Figure 12.2. Columns C and 
D show monthly adjusted closing prices downloaded from finance.yahoo.com for SPY (ticker 
symbol for the SPDR S&P500 exchange traded fund, which we use as a proxy for the market 
portfolio) and CSCO (ticker symbol for Cisco). We also downloaded short-term (13-week) Trea-
sury Bill rates using ticker ^IRX. Because adjusted closing prices are adjusted for both splits and 
dividends, we can compute total returns directly from them, and then the subtract one month’s 
interest to calculate the excess return (see columns G and H, with the formula for H5 shown).
Once we have calculated the excess returns by month, we can estimate beta using Excel’s 
SLOPE function. The first argument is the “y” or dependent variable, in this case Cisco’s excess 
returns in column H, and the second argument is the “x” or independent variable, where we use 
the market’s excess return in column G. We can similarly estimate the alpha of the regression 
using the ­INTERCEPT function with the same arguments. (See K7 and K8.)
A second approach is to plot the excess returns in scatterplot; see the Charts menu on Excel’s 
insert tab. Once the series has been added (again, using market excess returns for “x” and Cisco’s 
excess returns for “y”), select the plotted data, right click, and choose “Add Trendline.” Format the 
trendline and choose “Linear,” leave “Set Intercept” unchecked, and check “Display Equation on 
Chart” to see the estimated regression equation in the chart.

22The Eurodollar deposit rate is the average rate paid on dollar deposits in the London interbank market. 
It is widely regarded as a close proxy for the risk-free rate because it is a measure of the average borrowing/
lending rate between financial institutions (see the Chapter 11 appendix).

stocks during the financial crisis in 2008–2009. On the other hand, including data from 
recessionary periods may be helpful in evaluating the stock’s likely sensitivity to future 
downturns.
Other Considerations
When using historical returns to forecast future betas, we must be mindful of changes in 
the environment that might cause the future to differ from the past. For example, if a firm 
were to change industries, using its historical beta would be inferior to using the beta of 
other firms in the new industry. Also bear in mind that many practitioners analyze other 
information in addition to past returns, such as industry characteristics, firm size, and 
other financial characteristics of a firm, when they forecast betas. In the end, forecasting 
betas, like most types of forecasting, is as much art as science, and the best estimates require 
a thorough knowledge of the particulars of a firm and its industry.
Finally, to estimate the confidence interval for alpha or beta, we calculate their standard 
errors using Excel’s LINEST function. LINEST is an array formula which returns beta, alpha, 
and their standard errors as a 2x2 matrix. To input this function, first select all four cells 
L11:M12 as shown above, and type the LINEST formula as shown (without braces). Finally, 
type “Ctrl-Shift-Enter” to tell Excel this is an array formula which will have output in all four 
cells (braces will appear). Once we have the estimates and their standard errors, we can com-
pute the 95% confidence interval using Eq. 10.9. For example, the confidence interval for 
Cisco’s beta during this period is 1.57 { (2 * 0.14) = 1.29 to 1.85.

Investor behavior  
and Capital  
Market efficiency
aS FUND MaNaGer OF LeGG MaSON VaLUe trUSt, WIllIam h. MIller 
had built a reputation as one of the world’s savviest investors. Miller’s fund outperformed 
the overall market every year from 1991–2005, a winning streak no other fund manager 
came close to matching. But in 2007–2008, Legg Mason Value Trust fell by nearly 65%, 
almost twice as much as the broader market. While Legg Mason Value Trust outperformed 
the market in 2009, it lagged again from 2010 until Miller ultimately stepped down as 
manager and chief investment officer in 2012. As a result of this performance, investors in 
the fund since 1991 effectively gave back all of the gains they had earned relative to the 
market in the intervening years and Miller’s reputation lay in tatters.1 Was Miller’s perfor-
mance prior to 2007 merely luck or was his performance in post-2007 the aberration?
According to the CAPM, the market portfolio is efficient, so it should be impos-
sible to consistently do better than the market without taking on additional risk. In this 
chapter, we will take a close look at this prediction of the CAPM, and assess to what 
extent the market portfolio is or is not efficient. We will begin by looking at the role 
of competition in driving the CAPM results, noting that for some investors to beat the 
market, other investors must be willing to hold portfolios that underperform the mar-
ket. We then look at the behavior of individual investors, who tend to make a number of 
mistakes that reduce their returns. But while some professional fund managers are able 
to exploit these mistakes and profit from them, it does not appear that much, if any, of 
these profits make it into the hands of the investors who hold their funds.
We will also consider evidence that certain investment “styles,” namely holding 
small stocks, value stocks, and stocks with high recent returns, perform better than 
predicted by the CAPM, indicating that the market portfolio may not be efficient. We 
explore this evidence, and then consider how to calculate the cost of capital if indeed 
the market portfolio is not efficient by deriving an alternative model of risk—the 
multifactor asset pricing model.

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
	
13.1	 Competition and Capital Markets
To understand the role of competition in the market, it is useful to consider how the 
CAPM equilibrium we derived in Chapter 11 might arise based on the behavior of indi-
vidual investors. In this section, we explain how investors who care only about expected 
return and variance react to new information and how their actions lead to the CAPM 
equilibrium.
Identifying a Stock’s Alpha
Consider the equilibrium, as we depicted in Figure 11.12 on pages 422–423, where the 
CAPM holds and the market portfolio is efficient. Now suppose new information arrives 
such that, if market prices remain unchanged, this news would raise the expected return of 
Walmart and Nike stocks by 2% and lower the expected return of McDonald’s and Tiffany 
stocks by 2%, leaving the expected return of the market unchanged.2 Figure 13.1 illustrates 
the effect of this change on the efficient frontier. With the new information, the market 
portfolio is no longer efficient. Alternative portfolios offer a higher expected return and a 
lower volatility than we can obtain by holding the market portfolio. Investors who are 
aware of this fact will alter their investments in order to make their portfolios efficient.
To improve the performance of their portfolios, investors who are holding the market 
portfolio will compare the expected return of each security s with its required return from 
the CAPM (Eq. 12.1):
	
rs = rf + bs * (E[RMkt] - rf )	
(13.1)
2In general, news about individual stocks will affect the market’s expected return because these stocks are 
part of the market portfolio. To keep things simple, we assume the individual stock effects cancel out so 
that the market’s expected return remains unchanged.
An Inefficient Market 
Portfolio
If the market ­portfolio is 
not equal to the ­efficient 
portfolio, then the market 
is not in the CAPM equilib-
rium. The figure illustrates 
this possibility if news is 
announced that raises 
the expected return of 
Walmart and Nike stocks 
and lowers the expected 
return of McDonald’s and 
­Tiffany stocks compared to 
the situation depicted in 
Figure 11.12.

13.1  Competition and Capital Markets	
479
Figure 13.2 shows this comparison. Note that the stocks whose returns have changed are 
no longer on the security market line. The difference between a stock’s expected return and 
its required return according to the security market line is the stock’s alpha:
	
as = E[Rs] - rs	
(13.2)
When the market portfolio is efficient, all stocks are on the security market line and 
have an alpha of zero. When a stock’s alpha is not zero, investors can improve upon the 
­performance of the market portfolio. As we saw in Chapter 11, the Sharpe ratio of a port-
folio will increase if we buy stocks whose expected return exceeds their required return—
that is, if we buy stocks with positive alphas. Similarly, we can improve the performance of 
our portfolio by selling stocks with negative alphas.
Profiting from Non-Zero Alpha Stocks
Faced with the situation in Figure 13.2, savvy investors who are holding the market port-
folio will want to buy stock in Walmart and Nike, and sell stock in McDonald’s and 
Tiffany. The surge of buy orders for Walmart and Nike will cause their stock prices 
to rise, and the surge of sell orders for McDonald’s and Tiffany will cause their stock 
prices to fall. As stock prices change, so do expected returns. Recall that a stock’s total 
return is equal to its dividend yield plus the capital gain rate. All else equal, an increase 
in the current stock price will lower the stock’s dividend yield and future capital gain rate, 
thereby lowering its expected return. Thus, as savvy investors attempt to trade to improve 
their portfolios, they raise the price and lower the expected return of the positive-alpha 
stocks, and they depress the price and raise the expected return of the negative-alpha 
stocks, until the stocks are once again on the security market line and the market port­

Deviations from the

If the market portfolio is 
not efficient, then stocks 
will not all lie on the 
security market line. The 
distance of a stock above or 
below the security market 
line is the stock’s alpha. 
We can improve upon the 
market portfolio by buying 
stocks with positive alphas 
and selling stocks with 
negative alphas, but as we 
do so, prices will change 
and their alphas will shrink 
toward zero.

among savvy investors who try to “beat the market” and earn a positive alpha should keep 
the market portfolio close to efficient much of the time. In that sense, we can view the 
CAPM as an approximate description of a competitive market.
Second, there may exist trading strategies that take advantage of non-zero alpha stocks, 
and by doing so actually can beat the market. In the remainder of this chapter we will 
explore both of these consequences, looking at evidence of the approximate efficiency of 
the market, as well as identifying trading strategies that may actually do better than the 
market.
Concept Check	
1.	 If investors attempt to buy a stock with a positive alpha, what is likely to happen to its price and 
expected return? How will this affect its alpha?
	
2.	 What is the consequence of investors exploiting non-zero alpha stocks for the efficiency of the 
market portfolio?
	
13.2	 Information and Rational Expectations
Under what circumstances could an investor profit from trading a non-zero alpha stock? 
Consider the situation in Figure 13.2 after the news announcement. Because Exxon Mobil 
has a positive alpha before prices adjust, investors will anticipate that the price will rise and 
will likely put in buy orders at the current prices. If the information that altered Exxon 
Mobil’s expected return is publically announced, there are likely to be a large number of 
investors who receive this news and act on it. Similarly, anybody who hears the news will 
not want to sell at the old prices. That is, there will be a large order imbalance. The only 
way to remove this imbalance is for the price to rise so that the alpha is zero. Note that in 
this case it is quite possible for the new prices to come about without trade. That is, the 
competition between investors may be so intense that prices move before any investor can 
actually trade at the old prices, so no investor can profit from the news.3
Informed Versus Uninformed Investors
As the above discussion makes clear, in order to profit by buying a positive-alpha stock, there 
must be someone willing to sell it. Under the CAPM assumption of homogeneous expecta-
tions, which states that all investors have the same information, it would seem that all inves-
tors would be aware that the stock had a positive alpha and none would be willing to sell.
Of course, the assumption of homogeneous expectations is not necessarily a good 
description of the real world. In reality, investors have different information and spend 
varying amounts of effort researching stocks. Consequently, we might expect that sophisti-
cated investors would learn that Exxon Mobil has a positive alpha, and that they would be 
able to purchase shares from more naïve investors.
However, even differences in the quality of investors’ information will not necessarily 
be enough to generate trade in this situation. An important conclusion of the CAPM is 
that investors should hold the market portfolio (combined with risk-free investments), and 
this investment advice does not depend on the quality of an investor’s information or trading 
skill. Even naïve investors with no information can follow this investment advice, and as 
3The idea that prices will adjust to information without trade is sometimes referred to as the no-trade 
theorem. (P. Milgrom and N. Stokey, “Information, Trade and Common Knowledge,” Journal of Economic 
Theory 26 (1982): 17–27.)

	
13.2  Information and Rational Expectations	
481
Rational Expectations
Example 13.1 is very powerful. It implies that every investor, regardless of how little infor-
mation he has access to, can guarantee himself the average return and earn an alpha of zero 
simply by holding the market portfolio. Thus, no investor should choose a portfolio with a 
negative alpha. However, because the average portfolio of all investors is the market port-
folio, the average alpha of all investors is zero. If no investor earns a negative alpha, then no 
investor can earn a positive alpha, implying that the market portfolio must be efficient. As 
a result, the CAPM does not depend on the assumption of homogeneous expectations. 
Rather it requires only that investors have rational expectations, which means that all 
investors correctly interpret and use their own information, as well as information that can 
be inferred from market prices or the trades of others.4
For an investor to earn a positive alpha and beat the market, some investors must hold 
portfolios with negative alphas. Because these investors could have earned a zero alpha by 
holding the market portfolio, we reach the following important conclusion:
The market portfolio can be inefficient (so it is possible to beat the market) only if a significant 
number of investors either
	
1.	 Do not have rational expectations so that they misinterpret information and believe they 
are earning a positive alpha when they are actually earning a negative alpha, or
	
2.	 Care about aspects of their portfolios other than expected return and volatility, and so are 
willing to hold inefficient portfolios of securities.

the following example shows, by doing so they can avoid being taken advantage of by more 
sophisticated investors.
Example 13.1
How to Avoid Being Outsmarted in Financial Markets
Problem
Suppose you are an investor without access to any information regarding stocks. You know that 
other investors in the market possess a great deal of information and are actively using that 
information to select an efficient portfolio. You are concerned that because you are less informed 
than the average investor, your portfolio will underperform the portfolio of the average investor. 
How can you prevent that outcome and guarantee that your portfolio will do as well as that of 
the average investor?
Solution
Even though you are not as well informed, you can guarantee yourself the same return as the 
average investor simply by holding the market portfolio. Because the aggregate of all investors’ 
portfolios must equal the market portfolio (i.e., demand must equal supply), if you hold the 
market portfolio then you must make the same return as the average investor.
On the other hand, suppose you don’t hold the market portfolio, but instead hold less of 
some stock, such as Google, than its market weight. This must mean that in aggregate all other 
investors have over-weighted Google relative to the market. But because other investors are more 
informed than you are, they must realize Google is a good deal, and so are happy to profit at 
your expense.

How do investors actually behave? Do uninformed investors follow the CAPM advice 
and hold the market portfolio? To shed light on these questions, in the next section we 
review the evidence on individual investor behavior.

13.3	 The Behavior of Individual Investors
In this section, we examine whether small, individual investors heed the advice of the 
CAPM and hold the market portfolio. As we will see, many investors do not appear to hold 
an efficient portfolio, but instead fail to diversify and trade too much. We then consider 
whether these departures from the market create an opportunity for more sophisticated 
investors to profit at individual investors’ expense.
Underdiversification and Portfolio Biases
One of the most important implications of our discussion of risk and return is the benefit 
of diversification. By appropriately diversifying their portfolios, investors can reduce risk 
without reducing their expected return. In that sense, diversification is a “free lunch” that 
all investors should take advantage of.
Despite this benefit, there is much evidence that individual investors fail to diversify 
their portfolios adequately. Evidence from the U.S. Survey of Consumer Finances shows 
that, for households that held stocks, the median number of stocks held by investors in 
2001 was four, and 90% of investors held fewer than ten different stocks.5 Moreover, these 
investments are often concentrated in stocks of companies that are in the same industry or 
are geographically close, further limiting the degree of diversification attained. A related 
finding comes from studying how individuals allocate their retirement savings accounts 
(401K plans). A study of large plans found that employees invested close to a third of their 
assets in their employer’s own stock.6 These underdiversification results are not unique to 
U.S. investors: A comprehensive study of Swedish investors documents that approximately 
one-half of the volatility in investors’ portfolios is due to firm-specific risk.7
There are a number of potential explanations for this behavior. One is that investors 
suffer from a familiarity bias, so that they favor investments in companies they are familiar 
with.8 Another is that investors have relative wealth concerns and care most about the 
performance of their portfolio relative to that of their peers. This desire to “keep up with 
the Joneses” can lead investors to choose undiversified portfolios that match those of their 
colleagues or neighbors.9 In any case, this underdiversification is one important piece of 
evidence that individual investors may choose sub-optimal portfolios.

13.3  The Behavior of Individual Investors	
483
Excessive Trading and Overconfidence
According to the CAPM, investors should hold risk-free assets in combination with the 
market portfolio of all risky securities. In Chapter 12, we demonstrated that because the 
market portfolio is a value-weighted portfolio, it is also a passive portfolio in the sense that 
an investor does not need to trade in response to daily price changes in order to maintain 
it. Thus, if all investors held the market, we would see relatively little trading volume in 
financial markets.
In reality, a tremendous amount of trading occurs each day. At its peak in 2008, for 
example, annual turnover on the NYSE was nearly 140%, implying that each share of each 
stock was traded 1.4 times on average. While average turnover has declined dramatically in 
the wake of the financial crisis, as shown in Figure 13.3, it is still at levels far in excess of that 
predicted by the CAPM. Moreover, in a study of trading in individual accounts at a dis-
count brokerage, Professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean found that individual inves-
tors tend to trade very actively, with average turnover almost one and a half times the 
overall rates reported in Figure 13.3 during the time period of their study.10
What might explain this trading behavior? Psychologists have known since the 1960s 
that uninformed individuals tend to overestimate the precision of their knowledge. For 
example, many sports fans sitting in the stands confidently second guess the coaching 
decisions on the field, truly believing that they can do a better job. In finance we call 
this presumptuousness the overconfidence bias. Barber and Odean hypothesized that this 
kind of behavior also characterizes individual investment decision making: Like sports fans, 
individual investors believe they can pick winners and losers when, in fact, they cannot; 
this overconfidence leads them to trade too much.
An implication of this overconfidence bias is that, assuming they have no true ability, 
investors who trade more will not earn higher returns. Instead, their performance will be

worse once we take into account the costs of trading (due to both commissions and bid-ask 
spreads). Figure 13.4 documents precisely this result, showing that much investor trading 
appears not to be based on rational assessments of performance.
As additional evidence, Barber and Odean contrasted the behavior and performance of 
men versus women.11 Psychological studies have shown that, in areas such as finance, men 
tend to be more overconfident than women. Consistent with the overconfidence hypoth-
esis, they documented that men tend to trade more than women, and that their portfolios 
have lower returns as a result. These differences are even more pronounced for single men 
and women.
Researchers have obtained similar results in an international context. Using an extraordi­
narily detailed database on Finnish investors, Professors Mark Grinblatt and Matti Keloharju 
find that trading activity increases with psychological measures of ­overconfidence. 
­Interestingly, they also find that trading activity increases with the number of speeding tickets 
an individual receives, which they interpret as a measure of sensation seeking, or the 
­individual’s desire for novel and intense risk-taking experiences. In both cases, the increased 
trading does not appear to be profitable for investors.12

485
Individual Behavior and Market Prices
Thus, in reality, individual investors are underdiversified and trade too much, violating a 
key prediction of the CAPM. But does this observation imply that the remaining conclu-
sions of the CAPM are invalid?
The answer is not necessarily. If individuals depart from the CAPM in random, idio-
syncratic ways, then despite the fact that each individual doesn’t hold the market, when 
we combine their portfolios together these departures will tend to cancel out just like any 
other idiosyncratic risk. In that case, individuals will hold the market portfolio in aggregate, 
and there will be no effect on market prices or returns. These uninformed investors may 
simply be trading with themselves—generating trading commissions for their brokers, but 
without impacting the efficiency of the market.
So, in order for the behavior of uninformed investors to have an impact on the market, 
there must be patterns to their behavior that lead them to depart from the CAPM in 
systematic ways, thus imparting systematic uncertainty into prices. For investors’ trades 
to be correlated in this way, they must share a common motivation. Consequently, in 
Section 13.4, we investigate what might motivate investors to depart from the market port-
folio, and show that investors appear to suffer from some common, and predictable, biases.

13.4	 Systematic Trading Biases
For the behavior of individual investors to impact market prices, and thus create a profit-
able opportunity for more sophisticated investors, there must be predictable, systematic 
patterns in the types of errors individual investors make. In this section we review some of 
the evidence researchers have found of such systematic trading biases.
Hanging on to Losers and the Disposition Effect
Investors tend to hold on to stocks that have lost value and sell stocks that have risen in 
value since the time of purchase. We call this tendency to hang on to losers and sell winners 
the disposition effect. Professors Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman, building on the work 
of psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, posited that this effect arises due to 
investors’ increased willingness to take on risk in the face of possible losses.13 It may also 
reflect a reluctance to “admit a mistake” by taking the loss.
Researchers have verified the disposition effect in many studies. For example, in a study 
of all trades in the Taiwanese stock market from 1995–1999, investors in aggregate were 
twice as likely to realize gains as they were to realize losses. Also, nearly 85% of individual 
investors were subject to this bias.14 On the other hand, mutual funds and foreign investors

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
did not exhibit the same tendency, and other studies have shown that more sophisticated 
investors appear to be less susceptible to the disposition effect.15
This behavioral tendency to sell winners and hang on to losers is costly from a tax per-
spective. Because capital gains are taxed only when the asset is sold, it is optimal for tax 
purposes to postpone taxable gains by continuing to hold profitable investments, delaying 
the tax payment and reducing its present value. On the other hand, investors should 
capture tax losses by selling their losing investments, especially near the year’s end, in order 
to accelerate the tax write-off.
Of course, hanging on to losers and selling winners might make sense if investors 
forecast that the losing stocks would ultimately “bounce back” and outperform the winners 
going forward. While investors may in fact have this belief, it does not appear to be 
­justified—if anything, the losing stocks that small investors continue to hold tend to 
underperform the winners that they sell. According to one study, losers underperformed 
winners by 3.4% over the year after the winners were sold.16
Investor Attention, Mood, and Experience
Individual investors generally are not full-time traders. As a result, they have limited time 
and attention to spend on their investment decisions, and so may be influenced by 
­attention-grabbing news stories or other events. Studies show that individuals are more 
likely to buy stocks that have recently been in the news, engaged in advertising, experienced 
exceptionally high trading volume, or have had extreme (positive or negative) returns.17
Investment behavior also seems to be affected by investors’ moods. For example, sun-
shine generally has a positive effect on mood, and studies have found that stock returns 
tend to be higher when it is a sunny day at the location of the stock exchange. In New York 
City, the annualized market return on perfectly sunny days is approximately 24.8% per 
year versus 8.7% per year on perfectly cloudy days.18 Further evidence of the link between 
investor mood and stock returns comes from the effect of major sports events on returns.

NOBEL PRIZE 
In 2002, the Nobel Prize for Economics was awarded to 
Daniel Kahneman for his development of Prospect Theory 
with fellow psychologist Amos Tversky (who would have 
surely shared the prize if not for his death in 1996). Prospect 
Theory provides a descriptive model of the way individu-
als make decisions under uncertainty, predicting the choices 
people do make rather than the ones they should make. It 
posits that people evaluate outcomes relative to the status 
quo or similar reference point (the framing effect ), will take 
on risk to avoid realizing losses, and put too much weight 
on unlikely events. The disposition effect follows from Pros-
pect Theory by assuming investors frame their decisions by 
comparing the sale price with the purchase price for each 
stock. In a similar way, Prospect Theory provides an impor-
tant foundation for much research in behavioral economics 
and finance.
Kahneman and Tversky’s Prospect Theory

	
13.4  Systematic Trading Biases	
487
One study estimates that a loss in the World Cup elimination stage lowers the next day’s 
stock returns in the losing country by about 0.50%, presumably due to investors’ poor 
mood.19
Finally, investors appear to put too much weight on their own experience rather than 
considering all the historical evidence. As a result, people who grew up and lived during a 
time of high stock returns are more likely to invest in stocks than people who experienced 
times when stocks performed poorly.20
Herd Behavior
Thus far, we have considered common factors that might lead to correlated trading behav-
ior by investors. An alternative reason why investors make similar trading errors is that they 
are actively trying to follow each other’s behavior. This phenomenon, in which individuals 
imitate each other’s actions, is referred to as herd behavior.
There are several reasons why traders might herd in their portfolio choices. First, they 
might believe others have superior information that they can take advantage of by copying 
their trades. This behavior can lead to an informational cascade effect in which traders 
ignore their own information hoping to profit from the information of others.21 A second 
possibility is that, due to relative wealth concerns, individuals choose to herd in order to 
avoid the risk of underperforming their peers.22 Third, professional fund managers may 
face reputational risk if they stray too far from the actions of their peers.23
Implications of Behavioral Biases
The insight that investors make mistakes is not news. What is surprising, however, is that 
these mistakes persist even though they may be economically costly and there is a relatively 
easy way to avoid them—buying and holding the market portfolio.
Regardless of why individual investors choose not to protect themselves by holding the 
market portfolio, the fact that they don’t has potential implications for the CAPM. If indi-
vidual investors are engaging in strategies that earn negative alphas, it may be possible for 
more sophisticated investors to take advantage of this behavior and earn positive alphas. 
Is there evidence that such savvy investors exist? In Section 13.5, we examine evidence 
regarding this possibility.

13.5	 The Efficiency of the Market Portfolio
When individual investors make mistakes, can sophisticated investors easily profit at 
their expense? In order for sophisticated investors to profit from investor mistakes, two 
conditions must hold. First, the mistakes must be sufficiently pervasive and persistent 
to affect stock prices. That is, investor behavior must push prices so that non-zero alpha 
trading opportunities become apparent, as in Figure 13.2. Second, there must be limited 
competition to exploit these non-zero alpha opportunities. If competition is too intense, 
these opportunities will be quickly eliminated before any trader can take advantage of 
them in a significant way. In this section, we examine whether there is any evidence 
that individual or professional investors can outperform the market without taking on 
additional risk.
Trading on News or Recommendations
A natural place to look for profitable trading opportunities is in reaction to big news 
announcements or analysts’ recommendations. If enough other investors are not paying 
attention, perhaps one can profit from these public sources of information.
Takeover Offers.  One of the biggest news announcements for a firm, in terms of stock 
price impact, is when it is the target of a takeover offer. Typically, the offer is for a signifi-
cant premium to the target’s current stock price, and while the target’s stock price typically 
jumps on the announcement, it often does not jump completely to the offer price. While 
it might seem that this difference creates a profitable trading opportunity, in most cases 
there is usually remaining uncertainty regarding whether the deal will occur at the ini-
tially offered price, at a higher price, or fail to occur at all. Figure 13.5 shows the average 
Returns to Holding Target Stocks Subsequent to Takeover Announcements

After the initial jump in the 
stock price at the time of 
the announcement, target 
stocks do not appear to 
earn abnormal subsequent 
returns on average. However, 
stocks that are ultimately 
acquired tend to appreciate 
and have positive alphas, 
while those that are not 
acquired have negative 
alphas. Thus, an investor 
could profit from correctly 
predicting the outcome.

response to many such takeover announcements, showing the target stock’s cumulative

beta, at the time of the event. Figure 13.5 reveals that the initial jump in the stock price is 
high enough so that the stock’s future returns do not outperform the market, on average. 
However, if we could predict whether the firm would ultimately be acquired, we could earn 
profits trading on that information.
Stock Recommendations.  We could also consider stock recommendations. For exam-
ple, popular commentator Jim Cramer makes numerous stock recommendations on his 
evening television show, Mad Money. Do investors profit from following these recom-
mendations? Figure 13.6 shows the results of a recent study that analyzed the average stock 
price reaction to these recommendations, based on whether the recommendation coin-
cided with a news story about the company. In the case where there is news, it appears that 
the stock price correctly reflects this information the next day, and stays flat (relative to the 
market) subsequently. On the other hand, for the stocks without news, there appears to be 
a significant jump in the stock price the next day, but the stock price then tends to fall rel-
ative to the market, generating a negative alpha, over the next several weeks. The authors 
of the study found that the stocks without news tended to be smaller, less liquid stocks; it 
appears that the individual investors who buy these stocks based on the recommendation 
push the price too high. They appear to be subject to an overconfidence bias, trusting too 
much in Cramer’s recommendation and not adequately taking into account the behavior 
of their fellow investors. The more interesting question is why don’t smart investors short 
these stocks and prevent the overreaction? In fact they do (the amount of short interest 
rises for these stocks), but because these small stocks are difficult to locate and borrow and 
therefore costly to short, the price does not correct immediately.
When recommendations 
coincide with news, the initial 
stock price reaction appears 
correct and future alphas 
are not significantly different 
from zero. Without news, the 
stock price appears to over-
react. While sophisticated 
investors gain by shorting 
these stocks, costs of short-
ing limit their ability to do so.

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
The Performance of Fund Managers
The previous results suggest that though it may not be easy to profit simply by trading on 
news, sophisticated investors might be able to do so (for example, by being better able to 
predict takeover outcomes, or short small stocks). Presumably, professional fund managers, 
such as those who manage mutual funds, should be in the best position to take advantage of 
such opportunities. Are they able to find profit-making opportunities in financial markets?
Fund Manager Value-Added.  The answer is yes. The value a fund manager adds by 
engaging in profit-making trades is equal to the fund’s alpha before fees (gross alpha) 
multiplied by the fund’s assets under management (AUM). The evidence shows that the 
average mutual fund manager is able to identify profitable trading opportunities worth 
approximately $3 million per year, and for fund managers with at least five years experi-
ence, the number rises to almost $9 million per year (see Figure 13.7).24
Of course, the fact that the average mutual fund manager is able to find profitable 
trading opportunities does not imply that all managers can do so. In fact, most cannot. 
The median mutual fund actually destroys value; that is, most fund managers appear to 
behave much like individual investors by trading so much that their trading costs exceed 
the profits from any trading opportunities they may find. But because skilled managers 
manage more money, the mutual fund industry as a whole has positive value added.
Returns to Investors.  Do investors benefit by identifying the profit-making funds and invest-
ing in them? This time the answer is no. As shown in Figure 13.7, the average fund’s alpha 
after fees (net alpha), which is the alpha earned by investors, is -0.34%. On average actively 
managed mutual funds don’t appear to provide superior returns for their investors compared

NOBEL PRIZE 
When the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded 
to three financial economists, most people were surprised. 
The surprise was not that Eugene Fama, Robert Shiller, 
and Lars Peter Hansen had won the prize—most econo-
mists would agree they certainly deserved the prize for their 
­contributions—rather it was that they won it together. After 
all, Fama is most well-known for what he termed the effi-
cient market hypothesis, the assertion that markets are so 
competitive it is impossible to make money by trying to 
predict stock price movements. On the other hand, Robert 
Shiller argued the opposite, that the excess volatility in mar-
kets results from irrational behavior that can be exploited. 
Lars Peter Hansen is credited with developing statistical 
tools that can help distinguish these opposing views. Here 
is how the Nobel Prize committee justified its decision:
“Beginning in the 1960s, Eugene Fama and several col-
laborators demonstrated that stock prices are extremely 
difficult to predict in the short run, and that new informa-
tion is very quickly incorporated into prices. . . . If prices 
are nearly impossible to predict over days or weeks, then 
shouldn’t they be even harder to predict over several years? 
The answer is no, as Robert Shiller discovered in the early 
1980s. He found that stock prices fluctuate much more than 
corporate dividends, and that the ratio of prices to dividends 
tends to fall when it is high, and to increase when it is low. 
This pattern holds not only for stocks, but also for bonds 
and other assets. Lars Peter Hansen developed a statistical 
method that is particularly well suited to testing rational 
theories of asset pricing. Using this method, ­Hansen and 
other researchers have found that modifications of these 
theories go a long way toward explaining asset prices.”

to investing in passive index funds.25 The reason fund managers can add value but investors do 
not benefit is that on average the value added is offset by the fees the funds charge.
While the average mutual fund does not provide a positive alpha to its investors, it is pos-
sible that some funds might. Can investors identify funds that consistently deliver positive 
alphas to their investors? Morningstar ranks fund managers each year based on their histori-
cal performance. For example, Morningstar named Legg Mason’s William Miller, whose 
performance we highlighted in the introduction to this chapter, as manager of the year in 
1998 and manager of the decade the following year. As we have already noted, investors who 
were motivated to invest based on these awards saw poor performance over the next 10 
years. Miller’s experience is not exceptional. At the end of each year Forbes publishes an 
Honor Roll of top mutual funds based on an analysis of the past performance and riskiness 
of the fund. In a famous 1994 study, Vanguard CEO John Bogle compared the returns from 
investing in the market index with the returns from investing each year in the newly 
announced Honor Roll funds. Over a 19-year period, the Honor Roll portfolio had an 
annual return of 11.2%, whereas the market index fund had an annual return of 13.1%.26 
25Many studies report negative average alphas for investments in U.S equity mutual funds; see e.g., R. Kosowski, 
A. Timmermann, R. Wermers, and H. White, “Can Mutual Fund ‘Stars’ Really Pick Stocks? New Evidence 
from a Bootstrap Analysis,” Journal of Finance 61 (2006): 2551–2596 and E. Fama, and K. French, “Luck 
versus Skill in the Cross Section of Mutual Fund Alpha Estimates,” Journal of Finance 65 (2010) 1915–1947. 
Using an expanded time period, and considering funds that hold international as well as domestic stocks, 
J. Berk and J. van Binsbergen, find that alphas are not significantly ­different from zero (“Measuring Managerial 
Skill in the Mutual Fund Industry,” Journal of Financial Economics 118 (2015): 1–20).

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
Thus, the superior past performance of these funds was not a good predictor of their future 
ability to outperform the market. Other studies have confirmed this result, and found little 
predictability in fund performance.27
While these results regarding mutual fund performance might seem surprising, they are 
consistent with a competitive capital market. If investors could predict that a skilled man-
ager would generate a positive alpha in the future, they would rush to invest with this 
manager, who would then be flooded with capital. During Legg Mason manager William 
Miller’s meteoric rise, his capital under management grew from about $700 million in 
1992 to $28 billion in 2007. But the more capital the manager has to invest, the harder it 
is to find profitable trading opportunities. Once these opportunities are exhausted, the 
manager can no longer produce better-than-average performance.28 Ultimately, as new 
capital arrives the fund’s returns should fall. The inflow of capital will cease when the 
fund’s alpha is no longer positive.29 Indeed, alphas could be somewhat negative to reflect 
other benefits these funds provide, or could result from overconfidence. Investors put too 
much confidence in their ability to select fund managers and thus commit too much 
­capital to them.
The argument above suggests that because skilled managers attract more capital, they 
will manage the largest funds. Consequently, fund size is a strong predictor of the future 
value added by fund managers.30 But while investors appear to be good at picking manag-
ers, in the end they derive little benefit, because this superior performance is captured by 
the manager in the form of fees—mutual funds charge approximately the same percentage 
fee, so the larger funds collect higher aggregate fees. This result is exactly as we should 
expect: In a competitive labor market, the fund manager should capture the economic 
rents associated with his or her unique skill. In summary, while the profits of mutual fund 
managers imply it is possible to find profitable trading opportunities in markets, being able 
to do so consistently is a rare talent possessed by only the most skilled fund managers, and 
these managers earn fees commensurate with their talent.
Researchers have obtained similar results when evaluating institutional fund managers 
responsible for managing retirement plans, pension funds, and endowment assets. A study 
investigating the hiring decisions of plan sponsors found that sponsors picked managers 
that had significantly outperformed their benchmarks historically (see Figure 13.8). Once 
27See M. Carhart, “On Persistence in Mutual Fund Performance,” Journal of Finance 52 (1997): 57–82. 
One possible exception is fund fees—ironically, small funds that charge a higher percentage fee seem to 
generate predictably lower returns for their investors.
29This mechanism was proposed by J. Berk and R. Green, “Mutual Fund Flows in Rational Markets,” 
Journal of Political Economy 112 (2004): 1269–1295. The following studies all find that new capital flows 
into funds that do well and out of funds that do poorly: M. Gruber, “Another Puzzle: The Growth in 
Actively Managed Mutual Funds,” Journal of Finance 51 (1996): 783–810; E. Sirri and P. Tufano, “Costly 
Search and Mutual Fund Flows,” Journal of Finance 53 (1998): 1589–1622; J. Chevalier and G. Ellison, 
“Risk Taking by Mutual Funds as a Response to Incentives,” Journal of Political Economy 105 (1997): 
1167–1200.
28In Miller’s case most investors paid dearly for their confidence in him—although his losses post-2007 
equaled his gains from 1992, most investors were not invested in 1992, and so they experienced overall 
performance that lagged the S&P 500. Not surprisingly, after 2007 he experienced large capital outflows, 
so by the end of 2008 he had only about $1.2 billion under management.

Financial Economics 118 (2015): 1–20.

hired, however, the performance of these new managers looked very similar to the average 
fund, with returns exceeding their benchmarks by an amount roughly equal to their man-
agement fees.
The Winners and Losers
The evidence in this section suggests that while it may be possible to improve on the 
market portfolio, it isn’t easy. This result is perhaps not so surprising, for as we noted in 
Section 13.2, the average investor (on a value-weighted basis) earns an alpha of zero, before 
including trading costs. So beating the market should require special skills, such as better 
analysis of information, or lower trading costs.
Because individual investors are likely to be at a disadvantage on both counts, as well as 
subject to behavioral biases, the CAPM wisdom that investors should “hold the market” is 
probably the best advice for most people. Indeed, a comprehensive study of the Taiwan 
stock market found that individual investors there lose an average of 3.8% per year by trad-
ing, with roughly 1/3 of the losses due to poor trades and the remaining 2/3 due to transac-
tions costs.31
31Taiwan provides a unique opportunity to study how profits are distributed, because unlike the U.S., the 
identity of buyers and sellers is tracked for all trades. See B. Barber, Y. Lee, Y. Liu, and T. Odean, “Just 
How Much Do Individual Investors Lose by Trading?” Review of Financial Studies 22 (2009): 609–632.

The same study reported that institutions earn 1.5% per year on average from their 
trades. But while professional fund managers may profit due to their talent, information, 
and superior trading infrastructure, the results in this section suggest that little of those 
profits go to the investors who invest with them.
Concept Check	
1.	 Should uninformed investors expect to make money by trading based on news announcements?
	
2.	 If fund managers are talented, why do the returns of their funds to investors not have positive 
alphas?
	
13.6	 Style-Based Techniques and the Market 
Efficiency Debate
In Section 13.5, we looked for evidence that professional investors could profit at small 
investors’ expense and outperform the market. In this section, we will take a different 
tack. Rather than looking at managers’ profits, we will look at possible trading strate-
gies. In particular, many fund managers distinguish their trading strategies based on the 
types of stocks they tend to hold; specifically, small versus large stocks, and value versus 
growth stocks. In this section, we will consider these alternative investment styles, and 
see whether some strategies have generated higher returns historically than the CAPM 
predicts.
Size Effects
As we reported in Chapter 10, small stocks (those with smaller market capitalizations) have 
historically earned higher average returns than the market portfolio. Moreover, while small 
stocks do tend to have high market risk, their returns appear high even accounting for their 
higher beta, an empirical result we call the size effect.
Excess Return and Market Capitalizations.  To compare the performance of portfolios 
formed based on size, Professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French32 divided stocks each 
year into ten portfolios by ranking them based on their market capitalizations, and collect-
ing the smallest 10% of stocks into the first portfolio, the next 10% into the second port-
folio, up to the biggest 10% into the tenth portfolio. They then recorded the monthly 
excess returns of each decile portfolio over the following year. After repeating this process 
for each year, they calculated the average excess return of each portfolio and the beta of the 
portfolio; Figure 13.9 shows the result. As you can see, although the portfolios with higher 
betas yield higher returns, most portfolios plot above the security market line (SML)—all 
except one portfolio had a positive alpha. The smallest deciles exhibit the most extreme 
effect.
Of course, this result could be due to estimation error; as the figure shows, the standard 
errors are large and none of the alpha estimates is significantly different from zero. How-
ever, nine of the ten portfolios plot above the SML. If the positive alphas were due purely 
to statistical error, we would expect as many portfolios to appear above the line as below it. 
Consequently, a test of whether the alphas of all ten portfolios are jointly all equal to zero 
can be statistically rejected.
32See E. Fama and K. French, “The Cross-Section of Stock Returns,” Journal of Finance 47 (1992): 
427–465.

	
13.6  Style-Based Techniques and the Market Efficiency Debate 	
495
Excess Return and Book-to-Market Ratio.  Researchers have found similar results using 
the book-to-market ratio, the ratio of the book value of equity to the market value of 
equity, to form stocks into portfolios. Recall from Chapter 2 that practitioners refer to 
stocks with high book-to-market ratios as value stocks, and those with low book-to-market 
ratios as growth stocks. Figure 13.10 demonstrates that value stocks tend to have positive 
alphas, and growth stocks tend to have low or negative alphas. Once again, a joint test of 
whether all 10 portfolios have an alpha of zero is rejected.
Size Effects and Empirical Evidence.  The size effect—the observation that small stocks 
(or stocks with a high book-to-market ratio) have positive alphas—was first discovered 
in  1981 by Rolf Banz.33 At the time, researchers did not find the evidence to be con-
vincing because financial economists had been searching the data, looking for stocks with 
positive alphas. Because of estimation error, it is always possible to find stocks with esti-
mated positive alphas; indeed, if we look hard enough, it is also always possible to find 
33See R. Banz, “The Relationship between Return and Market Values of Common Stock,” Journal of 
Financial Economics 9 (1981): 3–18. A similar relation between stock price (rather than size) and future 
returns was found by M. Blume and F. Husic, “Price, Beta and Exchange Listing,” Journal of Finance 28 
(1973): 283–299.

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
QUESTION: You have written for 
years on personal finance. How has 
academic theory influenced investor 
behavior?
ANSWER: When I started writing 
about mutual funds in the 1980s, 
investors would ask, “What are the 
best funds?” Today, they are more 
likely to say, “I’m looking to add a 
foreign-stock fund to my portfolio. 
Which funds in that category do you 
like? Or should I index instead?”
We have gotten away from the 
blind pursuit of market-beating 
returns, and there is more focus on portfolio construc-
tion and a growing willingness to consider indexing. That 
reflects the impact of academic research.
What has really influenced investors has been the aca-
demic “grunt work” of the past four decades, which has 
given us a decent grasp of what historical market returns 
look like. Thanks to that research, many ordinary inves-
tors have a better understanding of how stocks have per-
formed relative to bonds. They realize that most actively 
managed stock mutual funds don’t beat the market, and 
thus, there is a case for indexing. They appreciate that dif-
ferent market sectors perform well at different times, so 
there is a real value in diversifying.
QUESTION: Some have critiqued the idea of holding a well-
diversified portfolio, arguing that diversification hasn’t worked 
in the 2008–2009 financial crisis. Is diversification still the 
best strategy?
ANSWER: Yes, when markets collapse, pretty much every 
sector gets bludgeoned. But just because investments rise 
and fall in sync with one another doesn’t mean they rise 
and fall by the same amount. You might have a portfolio 
where one sector falls 40 percent and another loses 20 
percent. Sure, losing 20 percent stings. Still, holding that 
sector is reducing your portfolio’s overall loss, so you are 
indeed benefiting from diversification.
QUESTION: Academics talk about efficient frontiers and opti-
mal portfolios. How does that translate into advice for someone 
looking to build a portfolio?
ANSWER: While academic research 
has influenced ordinary investors, 
we shouldn’t overstate the case. 
To some extent, the research has 
merely codified what investors 
already knew intuitively. For 
instance, investors have always 
thought about risk as well as return, 
and they have always been inclined 
to diversify. The academic research 
may have made investors a little 
more rigorous in their thinking, 
but it didn’t radically change their 
behavior.
Moreover, to the extent that the 
research doesn’t fit with investors’ 
intuition, they have clearly rejected 
it. Investors still behave in ways 
that academics would consider 
sub-optimal. They don’t build well-
diversified portfolios and then focus 
on the risk and return of the overall portfolio. Instead, they 
build moderately diversified ­portfolios—and then pay a lot 
of attention to the risk and reward of each investment they 
own.
QUESTION: How does risk tolerance affect the type of portfolio 
a person should build?
ANSWER: In theory, investors should hold the globally 
diversified all-asset “market portfolio” and then, depend-
ing on their risk tolerance, either add risk-free assets to 
reduce volatility or use leverage to boost returns. But almost 
nobody invests that way. In fact, I once tried to find out 
what the market portfolio looks like—and discovered 
nobody knows for sure.
Among the vast majority of ordinary investors, the idea 
of using leverage to buy investments is an anathema. In 
practice, many are doing just that. They hold a portfolio 
of assets, including stocks, bonds, and real estate, and they 
have a heap of debt, including their mortgage, auto loans, 
and credit card balances. But the implication—that they 
effectively have a leveraged stock market bet—would hor-
rify most investors.
While nobody seems to know what the market port-
folio looks like, investors have become willing to consider 
a broader array of assets, including foreign stocks, real 
estate investment trusts, and commodities. I think the 
trend will continue, as people come to realize that they 
can lower a portfolio’s risk level by adding apparently risky 
investments.

something these stocks have in common. As a consequence, many researchers were inclined 
to attribute Banz’s findings to a data snooping bias, which is the idea that given enough 
characteristics, it will always be possible to find some characteristic that by pure chance 
happens to be correlated with the estimation error of average returns.34
After the publication of Banz’s study, however, a theoretical reason emerged that 
explained the relationship between market capitalization and expected returns. Financial 
economists realized that as long as beta is not a perfect measure of risk—either due to esti-
mation error, or because the market portfolio is not efficient—we should expect to observe 
the size effect.35 To understand why, consider a stock with a positive alpha. All else equal, 
a positive alpha implies that the stock also has a relatively high expected return. A higher 
expected return implies a lower price—the only way to offer a higher expected return is for 
investors to buy the stock’s dividend stream at a lower price. A lower price means a lower 
market capitalization (and similarly a higher book-to-market ratio—market capitalization 
is in the denominator of the book-to-market ratio). Thus, when a financial economist forms 
a portfolio of stocks with low market capitalizations (or high book-to-market ratios), that 
collection contains stocks that will likely have higher expected returns and, if the market 
portfolio is not efficient, positive alphas. Similarly, a stock that plots below the security 
market line will have a lower expected return and, all else equal, a higher price, implying 
that it has a higher market capitalization and lower book-to-market ratio. Hence a portfo-
lio of stocks with high market capitalizations or low book-to-market ratios will have nega-
tive alphas if the market portfolio is not efficient. Let’s illustrate with a simple example.
34David Leinweber, in his book Nerds on Wall Street (Wiley Financial, 2008), illustrates this point by 
searching the data for a patently absurd characteristic that is correlated with returns. He found that over 
a 13-year period annual butter production in Bangladesh can “explain” annual variation in S&P 500 
returns!

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
Example 13.2
Risk and the Market Value of Equity
Problem
Consider two firms, SM Industries and BiG Corporation, which are expected to pay dividends 
of $1 million per year in perpetuity. SM’s dividend stream is riskier than BiG’s, so its cost of 
capital is 14% per year. BiG’s cost of capital is 10%. Which firm has the higher market value? 
Which firm has the higher expected return? Now assume both stocks have the same estimated 
beta, either because of estimation error, or because the market portfolio is not efficient. Based on 
this beta, the CAPM would assign an expected return of 12% to both stocks. How do the market 
values of the firms relate to their alphas?
Solution
The timeline of dividends is the same for both firms:
To calculate the market value of SM, we calculate the present value of its future expected 
dividends using the perpetuity formula and a cost of capital of 14%:
Market Value of SM =
1
0.14 = $7.143 million
Similarly, the market value of BiG is
Market Value of BiG =
1
0.10 = $10 million
SM has the lower market value, and a higher expected return (14% vs. 10%). It also has the 
higher alpha:
 aSM = 0.14 - 0.12 = 2%
 aBiG = 0.10 - 0.12 = -2%
Consequently, the firm with the lower market value has the higher alpha.

When the market portfolio is not efficient, theory predicts that stocks with low ­market 
capitalizations or high book-to-market ratios will have positive alphas. In light of this 
observation, the size effect is, indeed, potential evidence against the efficiency of the ­market 
portfolio.
Momentum
Researchers have also used past stock returns to form portfolios with positive alphas. For 
example, for the years 1965 to 1989, Narishiman Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman36 
ranked stocks each month by their realized returns over the prior 6–12 months. They 
found that the best-performing stocks had positive alphas over the next 3–12 months. 
36See N. Jegadeesh and S. Titman, “Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers: Implications for 
­Market Efficiency,” Journal of Finance 48 (1993): 65–91.

	
13.6  Style-Based Techniques and the Market Efficiency Debate 	
499
This evidence goes against the CAPM: When the market portfolio is efficient, past returns 
should not predict alphas.
Investors can exploit this result by buying stocks that have had past high returns and 
(short) selling stocks that have had past low returns, which is called a momentum strategy. 
Jegadeesh and Titman showed that over the period 1965–1989, this strategy would have 
produced an alpha of over 12% per year.
Implications of Positive-Alpha Trading Strategies
Over the years since the discovery of the CAPM, it has become increasingly clear to 
researchers and practitioners alike that by forming portfolios based on market capitaliza-
tion, book-to-market ratios, and past returns, investors can construct trading strategies that 
have a positive alpha. Given these results, we are left to draw one of two conclusions:
	
1.	 Investors are systematically ignoring positive-NPV investment opportunities. 
That is, the CAPM correctly computes required risk premiums, but investors are 
­ignoring opportunities to earn extra returns without bearing any extra risk, either 
because they are unaware of them or because the costs to implement the strategies 
are larger than the NPV of undertaking them.
	
2.	 The positive-alpha trading strategies contain risk that investors are unwilling to bear 
but the CAPM does not capture. That is, a stock’s beta with the market ­portfolio 
Market Efficiency and the Efficiency of the Market Portfolio
In Chapter 9 we introduced the efficient markets ­hypothesis, 
which states that competition should eliminate positive-
NPV trading opportunities or, equivalently, that securities 
with equivalent risk should have the same expected return. 
But because “equivalent risk” is not well defined, we cannot 
test the efficient markets hypothesis directly. The risk mea-
sure is well defined under the CAPM assumptions, however, 
and thus we can test the idea that no positive-NPV trad-
ing opportunities exist in the CAPM by testing whether the 
market portfolio is efficient and all trading strategies have 
zero alpha.
Some researchers further categorize such tests as tests of 
weak form, semi-strong form, and strong form efficiency. Weak 
form efficiency states that it should not be possible to profit 
by trading on information in past prices by, for example, sell-
ing winners and hanging on to losers or, conversely, by trad-
ing on momentum. Semi-strong form efficiency states that 
it should not be possible to consistently profit by trading 
on any public information, such as news announcements or 
analysts’ recommendations. Finally strong form efficiency 
states that it should not be possible to consistently profit 
even by trading on private information.
Note that the efficient markets hypothesis does not 
state that market prices are always correct given future 
­information. For example, the 2008 financial crisis made 
clear that the share prices of many banks and other firms 
were overvalued in 2007. Given this information, selling 
bank stocks in 2007 would have been a positive-NPV trad-
ing opportunity. But this fact on its own does not con-
tradict market efficiency. We would need to demonstrate 
that the financial crisis was easily predictable in 2007, and 
that many investors profited by trading on that knowledge. 
The scarcity of “winners” in the wake of the financial crisis 
makes clear that this prediction was by no means obvious 
at the time. Indeed, the trader most famous for anticipat-
ing the banking crisis by shorting mortgage-backed secu-
rities, John Paulson, has had mediocre performance since 
then, with his Advantage Plus fund recording a 60% loss 
from August 2010 to August 2015, suggesting, perhaps, 
that his earlier bet might have had to do more with luck, 
and a healthy appetite for risk, rather than skill.
As the evidence in this chapter makes clear, when we use 
the CAPM to measure risk, the evidence for market effi-
ciency is mixed: individual investors don’t seem to “beat the 
market” on average, yet at the same time certain trading 
strategies do appear to be profitable. The key question fac-
ing finance researchers is how to correctly measure risk. Do 
these “profitable” strategies entail systematic risks not identi-
fied by the CAPM––making them fairly priced according 
to some more general model of risk than the CAPM? Or 
do they represent a true opportunity to earn higher returns 
without increasing risk?

500	
Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
does not adequately measure a stock’s systematic risk, and so the CAPM does not 
correctly compute the risk premium.
The only way a positive-NPV opportunity can persist in a market is if some barrier to 
entry restricts competition. In this case, it is very difficult to identify what these barriers 
might be. The existence of these trading strategies has been widely known for more than 
15 years. Not only is the information required to form the portfolios readily available, but 
many mutual funds follow momentum-based and market capitalization/book-to-market–
based strategies. Hence, the first conclusion does not seem likely.
That leaves the second possibility: The market portfolio is not efficient, and therefore 
a stock’s beta with the market is not an adequate measure of its systematic risk. Stated 
another way, the profits (positive alphas) from the trading strategy are really returns 
for bearing risk that investors are averse to and the CAPM does not capture. There are 
several reasons why the market portfolio might not be efficient. Let’s examine each pos-
sibility in turn.
Proxy Error.  The true market portfolio may be efficient, but the proxy we have used for it 
may be inaccurate. The true market portfolio consists of all traded investment wealth in 
the economy, including bonds, real estate, art, precious metals, and so on. We cannot 
include most of these investments in the market proxy because competitive price data is 
not available. Consequently, standard proxies like the S&P 500 may be inefficient com-
pared with the true market, and stocks will have nonzero alphas.37 In this case, the alphas 
merely indicate that the wrong proxy is being used; they do not indicate foregone 
­positive-NPV investment opportunities.38
Behavioral Biases.  As we discussed in Section 13.4, some investors may be subject to 
systematic behavioral biases. For example, they may be attracted to large growth stocks 
that receive greater news coverage. Or they may sell winners and hang on to losers, 
following a contrarian strategy. By falling prey to these biases, these investors are hold-
ing inefficient portfolios. More sophisticated investors hold an efficient portfolio, but 
because supply must equal demand, this efficient portfolio must include more small, 
value, and momentum stocks to offset the trades of biased investors. While alphas 
are zero with respect to this efficient portfolio, they are positive when compared with 
the market portfolio (which is the combined holdings of the biased and sophisticated 
investors).
Alternative Risk Preferences and Non-Tradable Wealth.  Investors may also choose 
inefficient portfolios because they care about risk characteristics other than the volatil-
ity of their traded portfolio. For example, they may be attracted to investments with 
37When the true market portfolio is efficient, even a small difference between the proxy and true market 
portfolio can lead to an insignificant relation between beta and returns. See R. Roll and S. Ross, “On the 
Cross-Sectional Relation between Expected Returns and Beta,” Journal of Finance 49(1) (1994): 101–121.
38Because we cannot actually construct the true market portfolio of all risky investments, the CAPM 
theory is in some sense untestable (see R. Roll, “A Critique of the Asset Pricing Theory’s Tests,” Journal of 
Financial Economics 4 (1977): 129–176). Of course, from a corporate manager’s perspective, whether the 
CAPM is testable is irrelevant—as long as an efficient portfolio can be identified, he or she can use it to 
compute the cost of capital.

	
13.7  Multifactor Models of Risk

skewed distributions that have a small probability of an extremely high payoff. As a 
result, they might be willing to hold some diversifiable risk in order to obtain such a 
payoff. In addition, investors are exposed to other significant risks outside their port-
folio that are not tradable, the most important of which is due to their human ­capital.39 
For example, a banker at Goldman Sachs is exposed to financial sector risk, while a 
software engineer is exposed to risk in the high-tech sector. When choosing a portfo-
lio, investors may deviate from the market portfolio to offset these inherent 
exposures.40
It is important to appreciate that just because the market portfolio is not efficient, this 
does not rule out the possibility of another portfolio being efficient. In fact, as we pointed 
out in Chapter 11, the CAPM pricing relationship holds with any efficient portfolio. Con-
sequently, in light of the evidence against the efficiency of the market portfolio, researchers 
have developed alternative models of risk and return that do not rely on the efficiency of 
the market portfolio in particular. We develop such a model in Section 13.7.

2.	 If investors have a significant amount of non-tradable (but risky) wealth, why might the market

13.7	 Multifactor Models of Risk
In Chapter 11, we presented the expected return of any marketable security as a function 
of the expected return of the efficient portfolio:
	
E [Rs] = rf + beff
s
* (E [Reff ] - rf )	
(13.3)
When the market portfolio is not efficient, to use Eq.13.3 we need to find an alternative 
method to identify an efficient portfolio.
As a practical matter, it is extremely difficult to identify portfolios that are efficient 
because we cannot measure the expected return and the standard deviation of a port-
folio with great accuracy. Yet, although we might not be able to identify the efficient 
portfolio itself, we do know some characteristics of the efficient portfolio. First, any 
efficient portfolio will be well diversified. Second, we can construct an efficient port-
folio from other well-diversified portfolios. This latter observation may seem trivial, 
but it is actually quite useful: It implies that it is not actually necessary to identify the 
efficient portfolio itself. As long as we can identify a collection of well-diversified port-
folios from which an efficient portfolio can be constructed, we can use the collection 
itself to measure risk.
39Although rare, there are innovative new markets that allow people to trade their human capital to finance 
their education; see M. Palacios, Investing in Human Capital: A Capital Markets Approach to ­Student Fund-
ing, Cambridge University Press, 2004.
40Indeed, human capital risk can explain some of the inefficiency of common market proxies. See

Journal of Finance 51 (1996): 3–53; and I. Palacios-Huerta, “The Robustness of the Conditional CAPM 
with Human Capital,” Journal of Financial Econometrics 1 (2003): 272–289.

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
Using Factor Portfolios
Assume that we have identified portfolios that we can combine to form an efficient 
portfolio; we call these portfolios factor portfolios. Then, as we show in the appendix, 
if we use N factor portfolios with returns RF1, c , RFN, the expected return of asset s 
is given by
Multifactor Model of Risk
	
 E[R s] = rf + bF1
s (E[RF1] - rf ) + bF 2
s (E[RF 2] - rf ) + g + bFN
s
(E[RFN] - rf )
	
 = rf + a
N
n=1
bF n
s (E[RFn] - rf )
(13.4)
Here bF1
s , c , bFN
s  are the factor betas, one for each risk factor, and have the same inter-
pretation as the beta in the CAPM. Each factor beta is the expected % change in the excess 
return of a security for a 1% change in the excess return of the factor portfolio (holding the 
other factors constant).
Equation 13.4 says that we can write the risk premium of any marketable security as the 
sum of the risk premium of each factor multiplied by the sensitivity of the stock with that 
factor—the factor betas. There is nothing inconsistent between Eq.13.4, which gives the 
expected return in terms of multiple factors, and Eq.13.3, which gives the expected return 
in terms of just the efficient portfolio. Both equations hold; the difference between them is 
simply the portfolios that we use. When we use an efficient portfolio, it alone will capture 
all systematic risk. Consequently, we often refer to this model as a single-factor model. If 
we use multiple portfolios as factors, then together these factors will capture all systematic 
risk, but note that each factor in Eq.13.4 captures different components of the systematic 
risk. When we use more than one portfolio to capture risk, the model is known as a 
­multifactor model. Each portfolio can be interpreted as either a risk factor itself or a port-
folio of stocks ­correlated with an unobservable risk factor.41 The model is also referred to as 
the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT).
We can simplify Eq.13.4 a bit further. Think of the expected excess return of each fac-
tor, E[RFn] - rf , as the expected return of a portfolio in which we borrow the funds at 
rate rf  to invest in the factor portfolio. Because this portfolio costs nothing to construct 
(we are borrowing the funds to invest), it is called a self-financing portfolio. We can also 
construct a self-financing portfolio by going long some stocks, and going short other stocks 
with equal market value. In general, a self-financing portfolio is any portfolio with portfo-
lio weights that sum to zero rather than one. If we require that all factor portfolios are self-
financing (either by borrowing funds or shorting stocks), then we can rewrite Eq.13.4 as
Multifactor Model of Risk with Self-Financing Portfolios

41This form of the multifactor model was originally developed by Stephen Ross, although Robert Merton 
had developed an alternative multifactor model earlier. See S. Ross, “The Arbitrage Theory of Capital 
Asset Pricing,” Journal of Economic Theory 13 (1976): 341–360; and R. Merton, “An Intertemporal Capi-
tal Asset Pricing Model,” Econometrica 41 (1973): 867–887.

	
13.7  Multifactor Models of Risk	
503
To recap, it is possible to calculate the cost of capital without actually identifying the 
efficient portfolio using a multifactor risk model. Rather than relying on the efficiency of a 
single portfolio (such as the market), multifactor models rely on the weaker condition that 
we can construct an efficient portfolio from a collection of well-diversified portfolios or 
factors. We next explain how to select the factors.
Selecting the Portfolios
The most obvious portfolio to use when identifying a collection of portfolios that contain 
the efficient portfolio is the market portfolio itself. Historically, the market portfolio has 
commanded a large premium over short-term risk-free investments, such as Treasury bills. 
Even if the market portfolio is not efficient, it still captures many components of system-
atic risk. As Figures 13.9 and 13.10 demonstrate, even when the model fails, portfolios 
with higher average returns do tend to have higher betas. Thus, the first portfolio in the 
collection is a self-financing portfolio that consists of a long position in the market portfo-
lio that is financed by a short position in the risk-free security.
How do we go about picking the other portfolios? As we pointed out earlier, trading 
strategies based on market capitalization, book-to-market ratios, and momentum appear to 
have positive alphas, meaning that the portfolios that implement the trading strategy capture 
risk that is not captured by the market portfolio. Hence, these portfolios are good candidates 
for the other portfolios in a multifactor model. We will construct three additional portfolios 
out of these trading strategies: The first trading strategy selects stocks based on their market 
capitalization, the second uses the book-to-market ratio, and the third uses past returns.
Market Capitalization Strategy.  Each year, we place firms into one of two portfolios 
based on their market value of equity: Firms with market values below the median of 
NYSE firms form an equally weighted portfolio, S, and firms above the median ­market 
value form an equally weighted portfolio, B. A trading strategy that each year buys portfo-
lio S (small stocks) and finances this position by short selling portfolio B (big stocks) has 
produced positive risk-adjusted returns historically. This self-financing portfolio is widely 
known as the small-minus-big (SMB) portfolio.
Book-to-Market Ratio Strategy.  A second trading strategy that has produced positive 
risk-adjusted returns historically uses the book-to-market ratio to select stocks. Each year 
firms with book-to-market ratios less than the 30th percentile of NYSE firms form an 
equally weighted portfolio called the low portfolio, L. Firms with book-to-market ratios 
greater than the 70th percentile of NYSE firms form an equally weighted portfolio called 
the high portfolio, H. A trading strategy that each year takes a long position in portfolio H, 
which it finances with a short position in portfolio L, has produced positive risk-adjusted 
returns. We add this self-financing portfolio (high minus low book-to-market stocks) to 
our collection and call it the high-minus-low (HML) portfolio (we can also think of this 
portfolio as long value stocks, and short growth stocks).
Past Returns Strategy.  The third trading strategy is a momentum strategy. Each year we 
rank stocks by their return over the last one year,42 and construct a portfolio that goes 
long the top 30% of stocks and short the bottom 30%. This trading strategy requires 
holding this portfolio for a year; we then form a new self-financing portfolio and hold it 
42Because of short-term trading effects, the most recent month’s return is often dropped, so we actually 
use an 11-month return.

for another year. We repeat this process annually. The resulting self-financing portfolio is 
known as the prior one-year momentum (PR1YR) portfolio.
Fama-French-Carhart Factor Specification.  The collection of these four portfolios—the 
excess return of the market (Mkt - rf ), SMB, HML, and PR1YR—is currently the most 
popular choice for the multifactor model. Using this collection, the expected return of 
security s is given by:
Fama-French-Carhart Factor Specification
	
 E[Rs] = rf + bMkt
s
(E[RMkt] - rf ) + bSMB

E[RSMB]

where bMkt

 are the factor betas of stock s and measure the sensi-
tivity of the stock to each portfolio. Because the four portfolios in Eq. 13.6 were identified 
by Eugene Fama, Kenneth French, and Mark Carhart, we will refer to this collection of 
portfolios as the Fama-French-Carhart (FFC) factor specification.
The Cost of Capital with Fama-French-Carhart Factor 
Specification
Multifactor models have a distinct advantage over single-factor models in that it is much 
easier to identify a collection of portfolios that captures systematic risk than just a single 
portfolio. They also have an important disadvantage, however: We must estimate the 
expected return of each portfolio. Because expected returns are not easy to estimate, each 
portfolio we add to the collection increases the difficulty of implementing the model. This 
task is especially complex because it is unclear which economic risk the portfolios capture, 
so we cannot hope to come up with a reasonable estimate of what the return should be 
(as we did with the CAPM) based on an economic argument. To implement the model, we 
have little choice other than to use historical average returns on the portfolios.43
Because the returns on the FFC portfolios are so volatile, we use over 80 years of data 
to estimate the expected return. Table 13.1 shows the monthly average return as well as 
the 95% confidence bands of the FFC portfolios (we use a value-weighted portfolio of all 
NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks as the proxy for the market portfolio). Even with 80 
years of data, however, all of the estimates of the expected returns are imprecise.
43There is a second, more subtle disadvantage to most factor models. Because factor models are designed 
to price traded securities, there is no guarantee that they will accurately price risks that are not currently 
traded (e.g., the risk associated with a new technology). In practice, it is assumed that any non-traded risk 
is idiosyncratic, and therefore does not command a risk premium.

Example 13.3
Using the FFC Factor Specification to Calculate the Cost of Capital
Problem
You are considering making an investment in a project in the fast food industry. You determine 
that the project has the same level of non-diversifiable risk as investing in McDonald’s stock. 
Determine the cost of capital by using the FFC factor specification.
Solution
You decide to use data over the past ten years to estimate the factor betas of McDonald’s stock 
(ticker: MCD). Therefore, you regress the monthly excess return (the realized return in each 
month minus the risk-free rate) of McDonald’s stock on the return of each portfolio. The coef-
ficient estimates are the factor betas. Here are the estimates of the four factor betas and their 95% 
confidence interval based on data from 2005–2015:
Using these estimates and a risk-free monthly rate of 1.2%/12 = 0.10%, you can calculate the 
monthly expected return for investing in McDonald’s stock:
 E[RMCD] = rf +bMkt
MCD(E[RMkt] - rf)+bSMB
MCD E [RSMB]+bHML
MCDE [RHML]+bPR 1YR
MCD E[RPR 1YR]
 = 0.10% + 0.62 * 0.65% - 0.47 * 0.23% - 0.10 * 0.39% + 0.12 * 0.68%
 = 0.44%
Expressed as an APR, the expected return is 0.44% * 12 = 5.28%. Thus, the annual cost of 
capital of the investment opportunity is about 5.3%. (Note, however the substantial uncertainty 
both in the factor betas and their expected returns.)
As a comparison, a standard CAPM regression over the same time period leads to an esti-
mated market beta of 0.46 for McDonald’s—the market beta differs from the estimate of 0.62 
above because we are using only a single factor in the CAPM regression. Using the historical 
excess return on the market implies an expected return of 0.10% + 0.46 * 0.65% = 0.40% per 
month, or about 4.8% per year.

The FFC factor specification was identified a little more than 20 years ago. Although it 
is widely used in academic literature to measure risk, much debate persists about whether it 
really is a significant improvement over the CAPM.44 The one area where researchers have 
found that the FFC factor specification does appear to do better than the CAPM is mea-
suring the risk of actively managed mutual funds. Researchers have found that funds with 
high returns in the past have positive alphas under the CAPM.45 When Mark Carhart

13.8	 Methods Used in Practice
Given the evidence for and against the efficiency of the market portfolio, what method 
do people actually use in practice? There are two reasons why people are interested in 
computing the expected returns of marketable securities. First, it provides a reliable way 
for financial managers to estimate the cost of capital for investment decisions. Second, it 
allows investors to assess the riskiness of investing in these securities. Let’s examine which 
methods people use to make both of these decisions.
Financial Managers
How do financial managers actually calculate the cost of capital? A survey of 392 CFOs 
conducted by Professors John Graham and Campbell Harvey47 found that 73.5% of the 
firms that they questioned use the CAPM to calculate the cost of capital, as indicated in 
Figure 13.11. They also found that larger firms were more likely to use the CAPM than 
were smaller firms. What about the other methods? Among the firms Graham and Harvey 
surveyed, only about one-third reported using a multifactor model to calculate the cost of 
capital. Two other methods that some firms in the survey reported using are historical aver-
age returns (40%) and the dividend discount model (16%). By dividend discount model, 
practitioners mean Eq. 9.7 in Chapter 9: They estimate the firm’s expected future growth 
rate and add the current dividend yield to determine the stock’s expected total return.

Finance 15 (2002): 8–23.

	
13.8  Methods Used in Practice	
507
Investors
How do investors measure risk? In this case we can do better than simply asking them. We 
can look at what investors actually do. Recall, from the discussion in Section 13.1, that 
when a positive alpha investment opportunity presents itself in a market, investors should 
rush to invest and thereby eliminate the opportunity. To calculate the alpha of an invest-
ment opportunity, investors must first adjust for risk, which requires a risk model. Thus, 
by observing which investments investors rush into, it is possible to infer the risk model 
they are using.
In a recent study, Professors Jonathan Berk and Jules van Binsbergen use this insight to 
infer the risk model investors use when they invest in mutual funds.48 Figure  13.12 
reports their results: Of the different risk models they examined, investor behavior is most 
consistent with the CAPM. (That said, it also shows that a large percentage of mutual 
fund investment decisions are not consistent with any model.)
In short, the evidence from both sources is similar. Although most firms, and most 
investors, appear to use the CAPM, other methods are used as well. The choice of meth-
odology depends on the organization and the sector. It is not difficult to see why different 
organizations choose to use different techniques. All the techniques we covered are 
imprecise. Financial economics has not yet reached the point where it can provide a theory 
of expected returns that gives a precise estimate of the cost of capital. Consider, too, that 
all techniques are not equally simple to implement. Because the trade-off between sim-
plicity and precision varies across sectors, practitioners apply the techniques that best suit 
their particular circumstances.

Figure 13.12 
Which Risk Model Determines Mutual Fund Inflows
This figure reports the frequency that the sign of fund inflows match the sign of last quarter’s risk-adjusted return based on 
alternative risk models. If fund inflows and outflows were random, the frequency would be 50%. We can see that fund flows 
are more likely to be positive if the fund has a positive return, even more likely if the fund outperforms the market, and most 
likely if the fund outperforms the return predicted by the CAPM, implying that investors do not ignore risk when ­making 
their investment decisions. The CAPM even outperforms the FFC factor model of Section 13.7, suggesting that the added 
­factors do not help predict investor behavior.

Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
13.1  Competition and Capital Markets
	
n	 The difference between a stock’s expected return and its required return according to the secu-
rity market line is the stock’s alpha:
	
as = E[Rs] - rs	
(13.2)
	
n	 While the CAPM conclusion that the market is always efficient may not literally be true, 
­competition among savvy investors who try to “beat the market” and earn a positive alpha 
should keep the market portfolio close to efficient much of the time.
13.2  Information and Rational Expectations
	
n	 If all investors have homogeneous expectations, which states that all investors have the same 
information, all investors would be aware that the stock had a positive alpha and none would 
be willing to sell. The only way to restore the equilibrium in this case is for the price to rise 
immediately so that the alpha is zero.
	
n	 An important conclusion of the CAPM is that investors should hold the market portfolio (com-
bined with risk-free investments), and this investment advice does not depend on the quality of 
an investor’s information or trading skill. By doing so they can avoid being taken advantage of by 
more sophisticated investors.
	
n	 The CAPM requires only that investors have rational expectations, which means that all inves-
tors correctly interpret and use their own information, as well as information that can be 
inferred from market prices or the trades of others.
	
n	 The market portfolio can be inefficient only if a significant number of investors either do not 
have rational expectations or care about aspects of their portfolios other than expected return 
and volatility.
13.3  The Behavior of Individual Investors
	
n	 There is evidence that individual investors fail to diversify their portfolios adequately (underdi-
versification bias) and favor investments in companies they are familiar with (familiarity bias).
	
n	 Investors appear to trade too much. This behavior stems, at least in part, from investor overconfi-
dence: the tendency of uninformed individuals to overestimate the precision of their knowledge.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
When making a capital budgeting decision, the cost of capital is just one of several 
imprecise estimates that go into the NPV calculation. Indeed, in many cases, the impreci-
sion in the cost of capital estimate is less important than the imprecision in the estimate 
of future cash flows. Often the least complicated models to implement are used. In this 
regard, the CAPM has the virtues of being simple to implement, theoretically justifiable, 
and reasonably consistent with investor behavior. 
Concept Check	
1.	 Which is the most popular method used by corporations to calculate the cost of capital?
	
2.	 What other techniques do corporations use to calculate the cost of capital?
	
3.	 What risk model is most consistent with investors’ choices in their mutual fund investments?

13.4  Systematic Trading Biases
	
n	 In order for the behavior of uninformed investors to have an impact on the market, there must 
be patterns to their behavior that lead them to depart from the CAPM in systematic ways, thus 
imparting systematic uncertainty into prices.
	
n	 Examples of behavior that could be systematic across investors include the disposition effect 
(the tendency to hang on to losers and sell winners), investor mood swings that result from 
common events like weather, and putting too much weight on their own experience. Investors 
could also herd—actively trying to follow each other’s behavior. Stock prices appear to have 
more volatility than one would expect based on the volatility of dividends.
13.5  The Efficiency of the Market Portfolio
	
n	 It is not easy to profit simply by trading on news, but professional investors might be able to 
do so by, for example, being better able to predict takeover outcomes. However, in equilibrium, 
individual investors should not expect to share any of the benefit of this skill by investing with 
such professional investors. The empirical evidence supports this—on average, investors earn 
zero alphas when they invest in managed mutual funds.
	
n	 Because beating the market requires enough trading skill to overcome transaction costs as well 
as behavioral biases, CAPM wisdom that investors should “hold the market” is probably the 
best advice for most people.
13.6  Style-Based Techniques and the Market Efficiency Debate
	
n	 The size effect refers to the observation that historically stocks with low market capitalizations 
have had positive alphas compared to the predictions of the CAPM. The size effect is evidence 
that the market portfolio is not efficient, which suggests that the CAPM does not accurately 
model expected returns. Researchers find similar results using the book-to-market ratio instead 
of firm size.
	
n	 A momentum trading strategy that goes long stocks with high past risk-adjusted returns and 
short stocks with low past returns also generates positive CAPM alphas, providing further evi-
dence that the market portfolio is not efficient and that the CAPM does not accurately model 
expected returns.
	
n	 Securities may have non-zero alphas if the market portfolio that is used is not a good proxy for 
the true market portfolio.
	
n	 The market portfolio will be inefficient if some investors’ portfolio holdings are subject to sys-
tematic behavioral biases.
	
n	 The market portfolio will be inefficient if either investors care about risk characteristics other 
than the volatility of their traded portfolio or if investors are exposed to other significant risks 
outside their portfolio that are not tradable, the most important of which is due to their human 
capital.
13.7  Multifactor Models of Risk
	
n	 When more than one portfolio is used to capture risk, the model is known as a multifactor 
model. This model is also sometimes called the Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT). Using a collec-
tion of N well-diversified portfolios, the expected return of stock s is
	
 E [Rs] = rf + bF1
s (E [RF1] - rf ) + bF2
s (E[RF2] - rf ) + g + bFN
s (E[RF N] - rf )
	
 = rf + a
N
n =1
bFn
s (E [RFn] - rf )	
(13.4)
	
n	 A simpler way to write multifactor models is to express risk premiums as the expected return 
on a self-financing portfolio. A self-financing portfolio is a portfolio that costs nothing to 

510	
Chapter 13  Investor Behavior and Capital Market Efficiency  
construct. By using the expected returns of self-financing portfolios, the expected return of a 
stock can be expressed as
	
 E [Rs] = rf + bF1
s E[RF1] + bF 2
s E [RF 2] + g + bFN
s
E[RFN]
	
 = rf + a
N
n=1
bFn
s E[RFn]	
(13.5)
	
n	 The portfolios that are most commonly used in a multifactor model are the market portfolio 
(Mkt), small-minus-big (SMB) portfolio, high-minus-low (HML) portfolio, and prior one-
year momentum (PR1YR) portfolio. This model is known as the Fama-French-Carhart factor 
specification:
	
 E [Rs] = rf + bMkt
s
(E [RMkt] - rf ) + bSMB

E [RSMB]
	
 + bHML

E[RHML] + bPR1 YR

E [RPR1 YR]	
(13.6)
13.8  Methods Used in Practice
	
n	 The CAPM is the most commonly used method in practice to estimate the cost of capital. It 
has the virtues of being simple to implement, theoretically justifiable, and reasonably consistent 
with investor behavior.

Competition and Capital Markets
	
1.	 Assume that all investors have the same information and care only about expected return and 
volatility. If new information arrives about one stock, can this information affect the price and 
return of other stocks? If so, explain why?
Problems

	
2.	 Assume that the CAPM is a good description of stock price returns. The market expected 
return is 8% with 8% volatility and the risk-free rate is 4%. New news arrives that does not 
change any of these numbers but it does change the expected return of the following stocks:
a.	 At current market prices, which stocks represent buying opportunities?
b.	 On which stocks should you put a sell order in?
	
3.	 Suppose the CAPM equilibrium holds perfectly. Then the risk-free interest rate increases, and 
nothing else changes.
a.	 Is the market portfolio still efficient?
b.	 If your answer to part a is yes, explain why. If not, describe which stocks would be buying 
opportunities and which stocks would be selling opportunities.
Information and Rational Expectations
	
4.	 You know that there are informed traders in the stock market, but you are uninformed. Describe 
an investment strategy that guarantees you will not lose money to the informed traders and 
explain why it works.
	
5.	 What are the only conditions under which the market portfolio might not be an efficient 
portfolio?
	
6.	 Explain what the following sentence means: The market portfolio is a fence that protects the 
sheep from the wolves, but nothing can protect the sheep from themselves.
	
7.	 You are trading in a market in which you know there are a few highly skilled traders who are 
better informed than you are. There are no transaction costs. Each day you randomly choose 
five stocks to buy and five stocks to sell (by, perhaps, throwing darts at a dartboard).
a.	 Over the long run will your strategy outperform, underperform, or have the same return as 
a buy and hold strategy of investing in the market portfolio?
b.	 Would your answer to part a change if all traders in the market were equally well informed 
and were equally skilled?
The Behavior of Individual Investors
	
8.	 Why does the CAPM imply that investors should trade very rarely?
	
9.	 Your brother Joe is a surgeon who suffers badly from the overconfidence bias. He loves to 
trade stocks and believes his predictions with 100% confidence. In fact, he is uninformed like 
most investors. Rumors are that Vital Signs (a startup that makes warning labels in the medical 
industry) will receive a takeover offer at $19.21 per share. Absent the takeover offer, the stock 
will trade at $15.98 per share. The uncertainty will be resolved in the next few hours. Your 
brother believes that the takeover will occur with certainty and has instructed his broker to buy 
the stock at any price less than $19.21. In fact, the true probability of a takeover is 50%, but 
a few people are informed and know whether the takeover will actually occur. They also have 
submitted orders. Nobody else is trading in the stock.
a.	 Describe what will happen to the market price once these orders are submitted if in fact the 
takeover will occur in a few hours. What will your brother’s profits be: positive, negative, 
or zero?

b.	 What range of possible prices could result once these orders are submitted if the takeover 
will not occur? What will your brother’s profits be: positive, negative, or zero?
c.	 What are your brother’s expected profits?
	
10.	 To put the turnover of Figure 13.3 into perspective, let’s do a back of the envelope calculation 
of what an investor’s average turnover per stock would be were he to follow a policy of invest-
ing in the S&P 500 portfolio. Because the portfolio is value weighted, the trading would be 
required when Standard and Poor’s changes the constituent stocks. (Let’s ignore additional, 
but less important reasons like new share issuances and repurchases.) Assuming they change 23 
stocks a year (the historical average since 1962) what would you estimate the investor’s per stock 
share turnover to be? Assume that the average total number of shares outstanding for the stocks 
that are added or deleted from the index is the same as the average number of shares outstand-
ing for S&P 500 stocks.
Systematic Trading Biases
	
11.	 How does the disposition effect impact investors’ tax obligations?
	
12.	 Consider the price paths of the following two stocks over six time periods:
	
	 Neither stock pays dividends. Assume you are an investor with the disposition effect, you 
bought at time 1, and now it is time 3. Assume throughout this question that you do no trading 
(other than what is specified) in these stocks.
a.	 Which stock(s) would you be inclined to sell? Which would you be inclined to hold on to?
b.	 How would your answer change if right now is time 6?
c.	 What if you bought at time 3 instead of 1 and today is time 6?
d.	What if you bought at time 3 instead of 1 and today is time 5?
	
13.	 Suppose that all investors have the disposition effect. A new stock has just been issued at a price 
of $60, so all investors in this stock purchased the stock today. A year from now the stock will 
be taken over, for a price of $72 or $48 depending on the news that comes out over the year. 
The stock will pay no dividends. Investors will sell the stock whenever the price goes up by 
more than 10%.
a.	 Suppose good news comes out in 6 months (implying the takeover offer will be $72). What 
equilibrium price will the stock trade for after the news comes out, that is, the price that 
equates supply and demand?
b.	 Assume that you are the only investor who does not suffer from the disposition effect and 
your trades are small enough to not affect prices. Without knowing what will actually tran-
spire, what trading strategy would you instruct your broker to follow?
The Efficiency of the Market Portfolio
	
14.	 Davita Spencer is a manager at Half Dome Asset Management. She can generate an alpha of 
1.55% per year on up to $93 million. After that her skills are spread too thin, so she cannot add 
value and her alpha is zero. Half Dome charges a fee of 1.14% per year on the total amount of 
money under management (at the beginning of each year). Assume that there are always inves-
tors looking for positive alpha and no investor would invest in a fund with a negative alpha. In 
equilibrium, that is, when no investor either takes out money or wishes to invest new money,
a.	 What alpha do investors in Davita’s fund expect to receive?
b.	 How much money will Davita have under management?
c.	 How much money will Half Dome generate in fee income?

15.	 Allison and Bill are both mutual fund managers, although Allison is more skilled than Bill. 
Both have $100 million in assets under management and charge a fee of 1%/year. Allison is able 
to generate a 2% alpha before fees and Bill is able to generate a 1% alpha before fees.
a.	 What is the net alpha investors earn in each fund (that is, the alpha after fees are taken out)?
b.	 Which fund will experience an inflow of funds?
c.	 Assume that both managers have exhausted the supply of good investment opportunities 
and so they will choose to invest any new funds received in the market portfolio and so those 
new funds will earn a zero alpha. How much new capital will flow into each fund?
d.	Once the new capital has stopped flowing in, what is the alpha before and after fees of each 
fund? Which fund will be larger?
e.	 Calculate each manager’s compensation once the capital has stopped flowing. Which man-
ager has higher compensation?
	
16.	 Assume the economy consisted of three types of people. 56% are fad followers, 41% are passive 
investors (they have read this book and so hold the market portfolio), and 3% are informed 
traders. The portfolio consisting of all the informed traders has a beta of 1.55 and an expected 
return of 15%. The market expected return is 11%. The risk-free rate is 6%.
a.	 What alpha do the informed traders make?

Style-Based Techniques and the Market Efficiency Debate
	
17.	 Explain what the size effect is.
	
*18.	 Assume all firms have the same expected dividends. If they have different expected returns, how 
will their market values and expected returns be related? What about the relation between their 
dividend yields and expected returns?
	
19.	 Each of the six firms in the table below is expected to pay the listed dividend payment every 
year in perpetuity.
a.	 Using the cost of capital in the table, calculate the market value of each firm.
b.	 Rank the three S firms by their market values and look at how their cost of capital is ordered. 
What would be the expected return for a self-financing portfolio that went long on the 
firm with the largest market value and shorted the firm with the lowest market value? (The 
expected return of a self-financing portfolio is the weighted average return of the constituent 
securities.) Repeat using the B firms.
c.	 Rank all six firms by their market values. How does this ranking order the cost of capital? 
What would be the expected return for a self-financing portfolio that went long on the firm

20.	 Consider the following stocks, all of which will pay a liquidating dividend in a year and nothing 
in the interim:
a.	 Calculate the expected return of each stock.
b.	 What is the sign of correlation between the expected return and market capitalization of the 
stocks?
	
21.	 In Problem 20, assume the risk-free rate is 3% and the market risk premium is 7%.
a.	 What does the CAPM predict the expected return for each stock should be?
b.	 Clearly, the CAPM predictions are not equal to the actual expected returns, so the 
CAPM does not hold. You decide to investigate this further. To see what kind of mistakes 
the CAPM is making, you decide to regress the actual expected return onto the expected 
return predicted by the CAPM.49 What is the intercept and slope coefficient of this 
regression?
c.	 What are the residuals of the regression in (b)? That is, for each stock compute the differ-
ence between the actual expected return and the best fitting line given by the intercept and 
slope coefficient in (b).
d.	What is the sign of the correlation between the residuals you calculated in (b) and market 
capitalization?
e.	 What can you conclude from your answers to part b of the previous problem and part d of 
this problem about the relation between firm size (market capitalization) and returns? (The 
results do not depend on the particular numbers in this problem. You are welcome to verify 
this for yourself by redoing the problems with another value for the market risk premium, 
and by picking the stock betas and market capitalizations randomly.50)
	
22.	 Explain how to construct a positive-alpha trading strategy if stocks that have had relatively high 
returns in the past tend to have positive alphas and stocks that have had relatively low returns in 
the past tend to have negative alphas.
	
*23.	 If you can use past returns to construct a trading strategy that makes money (has a positive 
alpha), it is evidence that market portfolio is not efficient. Explain why.
	
24.	 Explain why you might expect stocks to have nonzero alphas if the market proxy portfolio 
is not highly correlated with the true market portfolio, even if the true market portfolio is 
efficient.
	
25.	 Explain why if some investors are subject to systematic behavioral biases, while others pick 
efficient portfolios, the market portfolio will not be efficient.

to develop a new software product. The risk of the investment is the same as the risk of the 
company.
a.	 Using the data in Table 13.1 and in the table above, calculate the cost of capital using the 
FFC factor specification if the current risk-free rate is 3% per year.

Building a Multifactor Model
In this appendix, we show that if an efficient portfolio can be constructed out of a collec-
tion of well-diversified portfolios, the collection of portfolios will correctly price assets. To 
keep things simple, assume that we have identified two portfolios that we can combine 
to form an efficient portfolio; we call these portfolios factor portfolios and denote their 
returns by RF1 and RF2. The efficient portfolio consists of some (unknown) combination of 
these two factor portfolios, represented by portfolio weights x1 and x2:
	
Reff = x1RF1 + x 2RF 2	
(13A.1)
To see that we can use these factor portfolios to measure risk, consider regressing the excess 
returns of some stock s on the excess returns of both factors:
	
Rs - rf = as + bF1
s (RF1 - rf ) + bF 2
s (RF 2 - rf ) + es	
(13A.2)
This statistical technique is known as a multiple regression—it is exactly the same as the 
linear regression technique we described in Chapter 12, except now we have two regressors, 
RF1 - rf  and RF2 - rf , whereas in Chapter 12 we only had one regressor, the excess return 
of the market portfolio. Otherwise the interpretation is the same. We write the excess return 
of stock s as the sum of a constant, as, plus the variation in the stock that is related to each 
factor, and an error term es that has an expectation of zero and is uncorrelated with either 
factor. The error term represents the risk of the stock that is unrelated to either factor.
If we can use the two factor portfolios to construct the efficient portfolio, as in 
Eq. 13A.1, then the constant term as in Eq. 13A.2 is zero (up to estimation error). To see 
why, consider a portfolio in which we buy stock s, then sell a fraction bF1
s  of the first factor 
portfolio and bF2
s  of the second factor portfolio, and invest the proceeds from these sales in 
the risk-free investment. This portfolio, which we call P, has return
	
 RP = R s - bF 1
s RF1 - b F 2
s
RF 2 + (bF1
s
+ bF 2
s )rf
	
 = Rs - bF1
s (RF1 - rf ) - bF 2
s (RF 2 - rf)
	
(13A.3)
Using Eq. 13A.2 to replace Rs and simplifying, the return of this portfolio is
	
RP = rf + as + es	
(13A.4)
That is, portfolio P has a risk premium of as and risk given by es. Now, because es is 
uncorrelated with each factor, it must be uncorrelated with the efficient portfolio; that is,
	
 Cov(Reff, es) = Cov(x1 RF1 + x2 RF2, es)
	
 = x1 Cov(RF1, es) + x2 Cov(RF 2, es) = 0	
(13A.5)
But recall from Chapter 11 that risk that is uncorrelated with the efficient portfolio is firm-
specific risk that does not command a risk premium. Therefore, the expected return of portfo-
lio P is rf , which means as must be zero.51
Setting as equal to zero and taking expectations of both sides of Eq. 13A.2, we get the 
following two-factor model of expected returns:
	
E[Rs] = rf + bF1
s (E[RF1] - rf ) + bF 2
s (E[RF 2] - rf )	
(13A.6)
51That is, Eq. 13A.5 implies b P
eff =
Cov (Reff, es)
Var (Reff )
= 0. Substituting this result into Eq. 13.3 gives E[Rp] = rf . 
But from Eq. 13A.4, E[Rp] = rf + as, and hence as = 0.

THE LAW OF ONE PRICE CONNECTION. One of the fundamental ­questions 
in corporate finance is how a firm should choose the set of securities it will issue to 
raise capital from investors. This decision determines the firm’s capital structure, which 
is the total amount of debt, equity, and other securi­ties that a firm has outstanding. 
Does the choice of capital structure affect the value of the firm? In Chapter 14, we 
consider this question in a perfect capital market. There we apply the Law of One Price 
to show that as long as the cash flows generated by the firm’s assets are unchanged,  
then the value of the firm—which is the total value of its outstanding ­securities—does 
not depend on its capital structure. Therefore, if capital structure has a role in deter-
mining the firm’s value, it must come from changes to the firm’s cash flows that result 
from market imperfections. We explore important market imperfections in subsequent 
chapters. In Chapter 15, we analyze the role of debt in reducing the taxes a firm or 
its investors will pay, while in Chapter 16, we consider the costs of financial distress 
and changes to managerial incentives that result from leverage. Finally, in Chapter 17, 
we consider the firm’s choice of payout policy and ask: Which is the best method for 
the firm to return capital to its investors? The Law of One Price implies that the firm’s 
choice to pay dividends or repurchase its stock will not affect its value in a ­perfect 
­capital market. We then examine how market imperfections affect this important insight 
and shape the firm’s optimal payout policy.

WHEN A FIRM NEEDS TO RAISE NEW FUNDS TO ­UNDERTAKE its 
investments, it must decide which type of security it will sell to investors. Even absent 
a need for new funds, firms can issue new securities and use the funds to repay debt or 
repurchase shares. What considerations should guide these decisions?
Consider the case of Dan Harris, Chief Financial Officer of Electronic Business 
Services (EBS), who has been reviewing plans for a major expansion of the firm. To 
pursue the expansion, EBS plans to raise $50 million from outside investors. One pos-
sibility is to raise the funds by selling shares of EBS stock. Due to the firm’s risk, Dan 
estimates that equity investors will require a 10% risk premium over the 5% risk-free 
interest rate. That is, the company’s equity cost of capital is 15%.
Some senior executives at EBS, however, have argued that the firm should con-
sider borrowing the $50 million instead. EBS has not borrowed previously and, given its 
strong balance sheet, it should be able to borrow at a 6% interest rate. Does the low 
interest rate of debt make borrowing a better choice of financing for EBS? If EBS does 
borrow, will this choice affect the NPV of the expansion, and therefore change the value 
of the firm and its share price?
We explore these questions in this chapter in a setting of perfect capital markets, 
in which all securities are fairly priced, there are no taxes or transaction costs, and the 
total cash flows of the firm’s projects are not affected by how the firm finances them. 
Although in reality capital markets are not perfect, this setting provides an important 
benchmark. Perhaps surprisingly, with perfect capital markets, the Law of One Price 
implies that the choice of debt or equity financing will not affect the total value of a 
firm, its share price, or its cost of capital. Thus, in a perfect world, EBS will be indifferent 
regarding the choice of financing for its expansion.

14.1  Equity Versus Debt Financing

14.1	 Equity Versus Debt Financing
The relative proportions of debt, equity, and other securities that a firm has outstanding 
constitute its capital structure. When corporations raise funds from outside investors, 
they must choose which type of security to issue. The most common choices are financing 
through equity alone and financing through a combination of debt and equity. We begin 
our discussion by considering both of these options.
Financing a Firm with Equity
Consider an entrepreneur with the following investment opportunity. For an initial invest-
ment of $800 this year, a project will generate cash flows of either $1400 or $900 next 
year. The cash flows depend on whether the economy is strong or weak, respectively. Both 
scenarios are equally likely, and are shown in Table 14.1.
Table 14.1	
The Project Cash Flows
Date 0
Date 1
Strong Economy
Weak Economy
-$800
$1400
$900
Because the project cash flows depend on the overall economy, they contain market risk. 
As a result, investors demand a risk premium. The current risk-free interest rate is 5%, and 
suppose that given the market risk of the investment the appropriate risk premium is 10%.
What is the NPV of this investment opportunity? Given a risk-free interest rate of 5% 
and a risk premium of 10%, the cost of capital for this project is 15%. Because the expected 
cash flow in one year is  1
2 ($1400) + 1
2 ($900) = $1150, we get
 NPV = -$800 + $1150
1.15 = -$800 + $1000
 = $200
Thus, the investment has a positive NPV.
If this project is financed using equity alone, how much would investors be willing to 
pay for the firm’s shares? Recall from Chapter 3 that, in the absence of arbitrage, the price 
of a security equals the present value of its cash flows. Because the firm has no other lia-
bilities, equity holders will receive all of the cash flows generated by the project on date 1. 
Hence, the market value of the firm’s equity today will be
PV(equity cash flows) = $1150
1.15 = $1000
So, the entrepreneur can raise $1000 by selling the equity in the firm. After paying the 
investment cost of $800, the entrepreneur can keep the remaining $200—the project’s 
NPV—as a profit. In other words, the project’s NPV represents the value to the initial 
owners of the firm (in this case, the entrepreneur) created by the project.

522	
Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 
Equity in a firm with no debt is called unlevered equity. Because there is no debt, 
the date 1 cash flows of the unlevered equity are equal to those of the project. Given 
equity’s initial value of $1000, shareholders’ returns are either 40% or -10%, as shown in 
Table 14.2.
The strong and weak economy outcomes are equally likely, so the expected return on 
the unlevered equity is 1
2 (40%) + 1
2 (-10%) = 15%. Because the risk of unlevered equity 
equals the risk of the project, shareholders are earning an appropriate return for the risk 
they are taking.
Financing a Firm with Debt and Equity
Financing the firm exclusively with equity is not the entrepreneur’s only option. She can 
also raise part of the initial capital using debt. Suppose she decides to borrow $500 ini-
tially, in addition to selling equity. Because the project’s cash flow will always be enough to 
repay the debt, the debt is risk free. Thus, the firm can borrow at the risk-free interest rate 
of 5%, and it will owe the debt holders 500 * 1.05 = $525 in one year.
Equity in a firm that also has debt outstanding is called levered equity. Promised 
payments to debt holders must be made before any payments to equity holders are dis-
tributed. Given the firm’s $525 debt obligation, the shareholders will receive only 
$1400 - $525 = $875 if the economy is strong and $900 - $525 = $375 if the economy 
is weak. Table 14.3 shows the cash flows of the debt, the levered equity, and the total cash 
flows of the firm.
What price E should the levered equity sell for, and which is the best capital structure 
choice for the entrepreneur? In an important paper, Professors Franco Modigliani and 
Merton Miller proposed an answer to this question that surprised researchers and practi­
tioners at the time.1 They argued that with perfect capital markets, the total value of a 
firm should not depend on its capital structure. Their reasoning: The firm’s total cash flows

still equal the cash flows of the project, and therefore have the same present value of $1000 
calculated earlier (see the last line in Table 14.3). Because the cash flows of the debt and 
equity sum to the cash flows of the project, by the Law of One Price the combined values 
of debt and equity must be $1000. Therefore, if the value of the debt is $500, the value of 
the levered equity must be E = $1000 - $500 = $500.
Because the cash flows of levered equity are smaller than those of unlevered equity, 
levered equity will sell for a lower price ($500 versus $1000). However, the fact that the 
equity is less valuable with leverage does not mean that the entrepreneur is worse off. She 
will still raise a total of $1000 by issuing both debt and levered equity, just as she did with 
unlevered equity alone. As a consequence, she will be indifferent between these two choices 
for the firm’s capital structure.
The Effect of Leverage on Risk and Return
Modigliani and Miller’s conclusion went against the common view, which stated that 
even with perfect capital markets, leverage would affect a firm’s value. In particular, it was 
thought that the value of the levered equity would exceed $500, because the present value 
of its expected cash flow at 15% is
   ($875) +    ($375)
1.15
= $543

The reason this logic is not correct is that leverage increases the risk of the equity of a 
firm. Therefore, it is inappropriate to discount the cash flows of levered equity at the same 
discount rate of 15% that we used for unlevered equity. Investors in levered equity require 
a higher expected return to compensate for its increased risk.
Table 14.4 compares the equity returns if the entrepreneur chooses unlevered equity 
financing with the case in which she borrows $500 and raises an additional $500 using 
levered equity. Note that the returns to equity holders are very different with and without 
leverage. Unlevered equity has a return of either 40% or -10%, for an expected return of 
15%. But levered equity has higher risk, with a return of either 75% or -25%. To com-
pensate for this risk, levered equity holders receive a higher expected return of 25%.
We can evaluate the relationship between risk and return more formally by computing 
the sensitivity of each security’s return to the systematic risk of the economy. (In our ­simple 
two-state example, this sensitivity determines the security’s beta; see also the discussion of

risk in the appendix to Chapter 3.) Table 14.5 shows the return sensitivity and the risk pre-
mium for each security. Because the debt’s return bears no systematic risk, its risk premium 
is zero. In this particular case, however, levered equity has twice the systematic risk of unle-
vered equity. As a result, levered equity holders receive twice the risk premium.
To summarize, in the case of perfect capital markets, if the firm is 100% equity 
financed, the equity holders will require a 15% expected return. If the firm is financed 
50% with debt and 50% with equity, the debt holders will receive a lower return of 5%, 
while the levered equity holders will require a higher expected return of 25% because of 
their increased risk. As this example shows, leverage increases the risk of equity even when 
there is no risk that the firm will default. Thus, while debt may be cheaper when ­considered 
on its own, it raises the cost of capital for equity. Considering both sources of capital 
together, the firm’s average cost of capital with leverage is 1
2 (5%) + 1
2 (25%) = 15%, the 
same as for the unlevered firm.

1.	 Why are the value and cash flows of levered equity less than if the firm had issued unlevered 
equity?

Which is the superior capital structure choice in a perfect capital market?
Example 14.1
Leverage and the Equity Cost of Capital
Problem
Suppose the entrepreneur borrows only $200 when financing the project. According to 
­Modigliani and Miller, what should the value of the equity be? What is the expected return?
Solution
Because the value of the firm’s total cash flows is still $1000, if the firm borrows $200, its equity 
will be worth $800. The firm will owe $200 * 1.05 = $210 in one year. Thus, if the economy 
is strong, equity holders will receive $1400 - $210 = $1190, for a return of $1190/$800 - 1 
= ⁜48.75%. If the economy is weak, equity holders will receive $900 - $210 = $690, for a 
return of $690/$800 - 1 = -13.75%. The equity has an expected return of
1
2 (48.75%) + 1
2 (-13.75%) = 17.5%.
Note that the equity has a return sensitivity of 48.75% - (-13.75%) = 62.5%, which is 
62.5%/50% = 125% of the sensitivity of unlevered equity. Its risk premium is 17.5% - 5% 
= ⁜12.5%, which is also 125% of the risk premium of the unlevered equity, so it is appropriate 
com­pensation for the risk. With 20% debt financing, the firm’s weighted average cost of capital 
remains 80%(17.5%) + 20%(5%) = 15%.

14.2	 Modigliani-Miller I: Leverage, Arbitrage, 
and Firm Value
In the previous section, we used the Law of One Price to argue that leverage would not 
affect the total value of the firm (the amount of money the entrepreneur can raise). Instead, 
it merely changes the allocation of cash flows between debt and equity, without altering the 
total cash flows of the firm. Modigliani and Miller (or simply MM) showed that this result 
holds more generally under a set of conditions referred to as perfect capital markets:
	
1.	 Investors and firms can trade the same set of securities at competitive market prices 
equal to the present value of their future cash flows.
	
2.	 There are no taxes, transaction costs, or issuance costs associated with security 
trading.
	
3.	 A firm’s financing decisions do not change the cash flows generated by its invest-
ments, nor do they reveal new information about them.
Under these conditions, MM demonstrated the following result regarding the role of capi-
tal structure in determining firm value:2
MM Proposition I: In a perfect capital market, the total value of a firm’s securities is equal to 
the ­market value of the total cash flows generated by its assets and is not affected by its choice of 
capital structure.
MM and the Law of One Price
MM established their result with the following simple argument. In the absence of taxes 
or other transaction costs, the total cash flow paid out to all of a firm’s security holders is 
equal to the total cash flow generated by the firm’s assets. Therefore, by the Law of One 
Price, the firm’s securities and its assets must have the same total market value. Thus, 
as long as the firm’s choice of securities does not change the cash flows generated by its 
assets, this decision will not change the total value of the firm or the amount of capital it 
can raise.
We can also view MM’s result in terms of the Separation Principle introduced in 
­Chapter 3: If securities are fairly priced, then buying or selling securities has an NPV of 
zero and, therefore, should not change the value of a firm. The future repayments that the 
firm must make on its debt are equal in value to the amount of the loan it receives upfront. 
Thus, there is no net gain or loss from using leverage, and the value of the firm is deter-
mined by the present value of the cash flows from its current and future investments.
Homemade Leverage
MM showed that the firm’s value is not affected by its choice of capital structure. But sup-
pose investors would prefer an alternative capital structure to the one the firm has chosen. 
MM demonstrated that in this case, investors can borrow or lend on their own and achieve 
the same result. For example, an investor who would like more leverage than the firm has 
chosen can borrow and add leverage to his or her own portfolio. When investors use 
2Although it was not widely appreciated at the time, the idea that a firm’s value does not depend on its 
capital structure was argued even earlier by John Burr Williams in his pathbreaking book, The Theory of 
Investment Value (North Holland Publishing, 1938; reprinted by Fraser Publishing, 1997).

526	
Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 
leverage in their own portfolios to adjust the leverage choice made by the firm, we say that 
they are using homemade leverage. As long as investors can borrow or lend at the same 
interest rate as the firm,3 homemade leverage is a perfect substitute for the use of leverage 
by the firm.
To illustrate, suppose the entrepreneur uses no leverage and creates an all-equity firm. 
An investor who would prefer to hold levered equity can do so by using leverage in his own 
portfolio—that is, he can buy the stock on margin, as illustrated in Table 14.6.
3This assumption is implied by perfect capital markets because the interest rate on a loan should depend 
only on its risk.
Students often question why Modigliani and Miller’s results 
are important if, after all, capital markets are not perfect in the 
real world. While it is true that capital markets are not perfect, 
all scientific theories begin with a set of idealized assumptions 
from which conclusions can be drawn. When we apply the the-
ory, we must then evaluate how closely the assumptions hold, 
and consider the consequences of any important deviations.
As a useful analogy, consider Galileo’s law of falling bod-
ies. Galileo overturned the conventional wisdom by show-
ing that, without friction, free-falling bodies will fall at the 
same rate independent of their mass. If you test this law, 
you will likely find it does not hold exactly. The reason, of 
course, is that unless we are in a vacuum, air friction tends to 
slow some objects more than others.
MM’s results are similar. In practice, we will find that 
capital structure can have an effect on firm value. But just 
as Galileo’s law of falling bodies reveals that we must look to 
air friction, rather than any underlying property of gravity, 
to explain differences in the speeds of falling objects, MM’s 
proposition reveals that any effects of capital structure must 
similarly be due to frictions that exist in capital markets. 
After exploring the full meaning of MM’s results in this 
chapter, we look at the important sources of these frictions, 
and their consequences, in subsequent chapters.

If the cash flows of the unlevered equity serve as collateral for the margin loan, then the 
loan is risk-free and the investor should be able to borrow at the 5% rate. Although the 
firm is unlevered, by using homemade leverage, the investor has replicated the payoffs to 
the levered equity illustrated in Table 14.3, for a cost of $500. Again, by the Law of One 
Price, the value of levered equity must also be $500.
Now suppose the entrepreneur uses debt, but the investor would prefer to hold unle-
vered equity. The investor can replicate the payoffs of unlevered equity by buying both the 
debt and the equity of the firm. Combining the cash flows of the two securities produces 
cash flows identical to unlevered equity, for a total cost of $1000, as we see in Table 14.7.
In each case, the entrepreneur’s choice of capital structure does not affect the opportu-
nities available to investors. Investors can alter the leverage choice of the firm to suit their

personal tastes either by borrowing and adding more leverage or by holding bonds and 
reducing leverage. With perfect capital markets, because different choices of capital struc-
ture offer no benefit to investors, they do not affect the value of the firm.

Homemade Leverage and Arbitrage
Problem
Suppose there are two firms, each with date 1 cash flows of $1400 or $900 (as shown in 
Table 14.1). The firms are identical except for their capital structure. One firm is ­unlevered, and 
its equity has a market value of $990. The other firm has borrowed $500, and its equity has a 
­market value of $510. Does MM Proposition I hold? What arbitrage opportunity is available 
using homemade leverage?
Solution
MM Proposition I states that the total value of each firm should equal the value of its assets. 
Because these firms hold identical assets, their total values should be the same. ­However, the 
problem assumes the unlevered firm has a total market value of $990, whereas the levered firm 
has a total market value of $510 (equity) + $500 (debt) = $1010. Therefore, these prices violate 
MM Proposition I.
Because these two identical firms are trading for different total prices, the Law of One Price 
is violated and an arbitrage opportunity exists. To exploit it, we can borrow $500 and buy the 
equity of the unlevered firm for $990, re-creating the equity of the levered firm by using home-
made leverage for a cost of only $990 - 500 = $490. We can then sell the equity of the levered 
firm for $510 and enjoy an arbitrage profit of $20.
Note that the actions of arbitrageurs buying the unlevered firm and selling the levered firm 
will cause the price of the unlevered firm’s stock to rise and the price of the levered firm’s stock to 
fall until the firms’ values are equal and MM Proposition I holds.

The Market Value Balance Sheet
In Section 14.1, we considered just two choices for a firm’s capital structure. MM Proposi-
tion I, however, applies much more broadly to any choice of debt and equity. In fact, it 

528	
Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 
applies even if the firm issues other types of securities, such as convertible debt or warrants, 
a type of stock option that we discuss later in the text. The logic is the same: Because 
­investors can buy or sell securities on their own, no value is created when the firm buys or 
sells securities for them.
One application of MM Proposition I is the useful device known as the market value 
balance sheet of the firm. A market value balance sheet is similar to an accounting bal-
ance sheet, with two important distinctions. First, all assets and liabilities of the firm are 
included—even intangible assets such as reputation, brand name, or human capital that are 
missing from a standard accounting balance sheet. Second, all values are current market val­
ues rather than historical costs. On the market value balance sheet, shown in Table 14.8, the 
total value of all securities issued by the firm must equal the total value of the firm’s assets.
The market value balance sheet captures the idea that value is created by a firm’s choice 
of assets and investments. By choosing positive-NPV projects that are worth more than 
their initial investment, the firm can enhance its value. Holding fixed the cash flows gen­
erated by the firm’s assets, however, the choice of capital structure does not change the 
value of the firm. Instead, it merely divides the value of the firm into different securities. 
Using the market value balance sheet, we can compute the value of equity as follows:
Market Value of Equity =
	
Market Value of Assets - Market Value of Debt and Other Liabilities
(14.1)
Example 14.3
Valuing Equity When There Are Multiple Securities
Problem
Suppose our entrepreneur decides to sell the firm by splitting it into three securities: equity, $500 
of debt, and a third security called a warrant that pays $210 when the firm’s cash flows are high 
and nothing when the cash flows are low. Suppose that this third security is fairly priced at $60. 
What will the value of the equity be in a perfect capital market?
Solution
According to MM Proposition I, the total value of all securities issued should equal the value of 
the assets of the firm, which is $1000. Because the debt is worth $500 and the new security is 
worth $60, the value of the equity must be $440. (You can check this result by verifying that at 
these prices, the firm’s equity and warrants both have risk premia commensurate with their risk 
in comparison with the securities in Table 14.5.)
Application: A Leveraged Recapitalization
So far, we have looked at capital structure from the perspective of an entrepreneur who is 
considering financing an investment opportunity. In fact, MM Proposition I applies to 
capital structure decisions made at any time during the life of the firm.
Let’s consider an example. Harrison Industries is currently an all-equity firm operat-
ing in a perfect capital market, with 50 million shares outstanding that are trading for $4 
per share. Harrison plans to increase its leverage by borrowing $80 million and using the 
funds to repurchase 20 million of its outstanding shares. When a firm repurchases a signifi-
cant percentage of its outstanding shares in this way, the transaction is called a leveraged 
recapitalization.
We can view this transaction in two stages. First, Harrison sells debt to raise $80 million 
in cash. Second, Harrison uses the cash to repurchase shares. Table 14.9 shows the market 
value balance sheet after each of these stages.

	
14.2  Modigliani-Miller I: Leverage, Arbitrage, and Firm Value 	
529
Initially, Harrison is an all-equity firm. That is, the market value of Harrison’s equity, 
which is 50 million shares * $4 per share = $200 million, equals the market value of its 
existing assets. After borrowing, Harrison’s liabilities grow by $80 million, which is also 
equal to the amount of cash the firm has raised. Because both assets and liabilities increase 
by the same amount, the market value of the equity remains unchanged.
To conduct the share repurchase, Harrison spends the $80 million in borrowed cash 
to repurchase $80 million , $4 per share = 20 million shares. Because the firm’s assets 
decrease by $80 million and its debt remains unchanged, the market value of the equity 
must also fall by $80 million, from $200 million to $120 million, for assets and liabilities to 
remain balanced. The share price, however, is unchanged—with 30 million shares remain-
ing, the shares are worth $120 million , 30 million shares = $4 per share, just as before.
The fact that the share price did not change should not come as a surprise. Because 
the firm has sold $80 million worth of new debt and purchased $80 million worth of

14.3	 Modigliani-Miller II: Leverage, Risk, 
and the Cost of Capital
Modigliani and Miller showed that a firm’s financing choice does not affect its value. But 
how can we reconcile this conclusion with the fact that the cost of capital differs for dif-
ferent securities? Consider again our entrepreneur from Section 14.1. When the project is 
financed solely through equity, the equity holders require a 15% expected return. As an 
alternative, the firm can borrow at the risk-free rate of 5%. In this situation, isn’t debt a 
cheaper and better source of capital than equity?
Although debt does have a lower cost of capital than equity, we cannot consider this cost 
in isolation. As we saw in Section 14.1, while debt itself may be cheap, it increases the risk 
and therefore the cost of capital of the firm’s equity. In this section, we calculate the impact 
of leverage on the expected return of a firm’s stock, or the equity cost of capital. We then 
consider how to estimate the cost of capital of the firm’s assets, and show that it is unaf-
fected by leverage. In the end, the savings from the low expected return on debt, the debt 
cost of capital, are exactly offset by a higher equity cost of capital, and there are no net sav-
ings for the firm.
Leverage and the Equity Cost of Capital
We can use Modigliani and Miller’s first proposition to derive an explicit relationship 
between leverage and the equity cost of capital. Let E and D denote the market value of 
equity and debt if the firm is levered, respectively; let U be the market value of equity if the 
firm is unlevered; and let A be the market value of the firm’s assets. Then MM Proposition 
I states that
	
E + D = U = A
(14.2)
That is, the total market value of the firm’s securities is equal to the market value of its 
assets, whether the firm is unlevered or levered.
We can interpret the first equality in Eq. 14.2 in terms of homemade leverage: By hold-
ing a portfolio of the firm’s equity and debt, we can replicate the cash flows from holding 
unlevered equity. Because the return of a portfolio is equal to the weighted average of the 
returns of the securities in it, this equality implies the following relationship between the 
returns of levered equity (RE), debt (RD), and unlevered equity (RU):
	
E
E + D
 RE +
D
E + D
 RD = RU
(14.3)
If we solve Eq. 14.3 for RE, we obtain the following expression for the return of levered 
equity:

	
14.3  Modigliani-Miller II: Leverage, Risk, and the Cost of Capital 	
531
	
RE = RU
+
D
E
 (RU - RD)

(14.4)
This equation reveals the effect of leverage on the return of the levered equity. The levered 
equity return equals the unlevered return, plus an extra “kick” due to leverage. This 
extra effect pushes the returns of levered equity even higher when the firm performs well 
(RU 7 RD), but makes them drop even lower when the firm does poorly (RU 6 RD). The 
amount of additional risk depends on the amount of leverage, measured by the firm’s 
market value debt-equity ratio, D/E. Because Eq. 14.4 holds for the realized returns, it 
holds for the expected returns as well (denoted by r in place of R). This observation leads to 
Modigliani and Miller’s second proposition:
MM Proposition II: The cost of capital of levered equity increases with the firm’s market value 
debt-equity ratio,
Cost of Capital of Levered Equity
	
rE = rU + D
E
 (rU - rD)
(14.5)
We can illustrate MM Proposition II for the entrepreneur’s project in Section 14.1. 
Recall that if the firm is all-equity financed, the expected return on unlevered equity is 
15% (see Table 14.4). If the firm is financed with $500 of debt, the expected return of the 
debt is the risk-free interest rate of 5%. Therefore, according to MM Proposition II, the 
expected return on equity for the levered firm is
rE = 15% + 500
500
 (15% - 5%) = 25%
This result matches the expected return calculated in Table 14.4.
Example 14.4 
Computing the Equity Cost of Capital
Problem
Suppose the entrepreneur of Section  14.1 borrows only $200 when financing the project. 
According to MM Proposition II, what will be the firm’s equity cost of capital?
Solution
Because the firm’s assets have a market value of $1000, by MM Proposition I the equity will have 
a market value of $800. Then, using Eq. 14.5,
rE = 15% + 200
800
 (15% - 5%) = 17.5%
This result matches the expected return calculated in Example 14.1.

Capital Budgeting and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
We can use the insight of Modigliani and Miller to understand the effect of leverage on 
the firm’s cost of capital for new investments. If a firm is financed with both equity and 
debt, then the risk of its underlying assets will match the risk of a portfolio of its equity and 

532

debt. Thus, the appropriate cost of capital for the firm’s assets is the cost of capital of this 
portfolio, which is simply the weighted average of the firm’s equity and debt cost of capital:

(14.6)
In Chapter 12 we called this cost of capital the firm’s unlevered cost of capital, or pretax 
WACC. There we also introduced the firm’s effective after-tax weighted average cost of 
capital, or WACC, which we compute using the firm’s after-tax cost of debt. Because we are 
in a setting of perfect capital markets, there are no taxes, so the firm’s WACC and unlevered 
cost of capital coincide:
	
rwacc = rU = rA	
(14.7)
That is, with perfect capital markets, a firm’s WACC is independent of its capital structure and 
is equal to its equity cost of capital if it is unlevered, which matches the cost of capital of its assets.

As the fraction of the firm 
financed with debt increases, 
both the equity and the 
debt become riskier and 
their cost of capital rises. 
Yet, because more weight is

the weighted average cost of 
capital remains constant.

*This level of leverage corresponds to a face value of 1050 and thus a promised yield of 16.67%. Because the firm defaults and debt earns a zero return with 
50% probability, the expected return of the debt, rD, is only 8.33%, representing a risk premium of 3.33%. This risk premium is 1/3 that of unlevered 
equity, which is justified since it has 1/3 the return sensitivity (16.67% versus 50%, see Table 14.5). More generally, we can use No-Arbitrage Pricing to 
price the securities in this example (see e.g. Problem 14.20 and the Chapter 3 appendix).

	
14.3  Modigliani-Miller II: Leverage, Risk, and the Cost of Capital 	
533
Figure 14.1 illustrates the effect of increasing the amount of leverage in a firm’s capital 
structure on its equity cost of capital, its debt cost of capital, and its WACC. In the figure, 
we measure the firm’s leverage in terms of its debt-to-value ratio, D/(E + D), which is 
the fraction of the firm’s total value that corresponds to debt. With no debt, the WACC is 
equal to the unlevered equity cost of capital. As the firm borrows at the low cost of capital 
for debt, its equity cost of capital rises according to Eq. 14.5. The net effect is that the 
firm’s WACC is unchanged. Of course, as the amount of debt increases, the debt becomes 
more risky because there is a chance the firm will default; as a result, the debt cost of capital 
rD also rises. With 100% debt, the debt would be as risky as the assets themselves (similar 
to unlevered equity). But even though the debt and equity costs of capital both rise when 
leverage is high, because more weight is put on the lower-cost debt, the WACC remains 
constant.
Recall from Chapter 9 that we can calculate the enterprise value of the firm by dis-
counting its future free cash flow using the WACC. Thus, Eq. 14.7 provides the following 
intuitive interpretation of MM Proposition I: Although debt has a lower cost of capital 
than equity, leverage does not lower a firm’s WACC. As a result, the value of the firm’s free 
cash flow evaluated using the WACC does not change, and so the enterprise value of the 
firm does not depend on its financing choices. This observation allows us to answer the 
questions posed for the CFO of EBS at the beginning of this chapter: With perfect capital 
markets, the firm’s weighted average cost of capital, and therefore the NPV of the expan-
sion, is unaffected by how EBS chooses to finance the new investment.
Example 14.5
Reducing Leverage and the Cost of Capital
Problem
NRG Energy, Inc. (NRG) is an energy company with a market debt-equity ratio of 3. Suppose 
its current debt cost of capital is 6%, and its equity cost of capital is 14%. Suppose also that if 
NRG issues equity and uses the proceeds to repay its debt and reduce its debt-equity ratio to 2, 
it will lower its debt cost of capital to 5.5%. With perfect capital markets, what effect will this 
transaction have on NRG’s equity cost of capital and WACC? What would happen if NRG 
issues even more equity and pays off its debt completely? How would these alternative capital 
structures affect NRG’s enterprise value?
Solution
We can calculate NRG’s initial WACC and unlevered cost of capital using Eqs. 14.6 and 14.7:
rwacc = rU =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD =
1
1 + 3
 (14%) +
3
1 + 3
 (6%) = 8%
Given NRG’s unlevered cost of capital of 8%, we can use Eq. 14.5 to calculate NRG’s equity cost 
of capital after the reduction in leverage:
rE = rU + D
E
 (rU - rD ) = 8% + 2
1
 (8% - 5.5%) = 13%
The reduction in leverage will cause NRG’s equity cost of capital to fall to 13%. Note, though, that 
with perfect capital markets, NRG’s WACC remains unchanged at 8% = 1
3 (13%) + 2
3 (5.5%), 
and there is no net gain from this transaction.
If NRG pays off its debt completely, it will be unlevered. Thus, its equity cost of capital will 
equal its WACC and unlevered cost of capital of 8%.
In either scenario, NRG’s WACC and free cash flows remain unchanged. Thus, with perfect 
capital markets, its enterprise value will not be affected by these different capital structure choices.

Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 
Computing the WACC with Multiple Securities
We calculated the firm’s unlevered cost of capital and WACC in Eqs. 14.6 and 14.7 assum-
ing that the firm has issued only two types of securities (equity and debt). If the firm’s capi-
tal structure is more complex, however, then rU and rwacc are calculated by computing the 
weighted average cost of capital of all of the firm’s securities.
Is Debt Better Than Equity?
It is not uncommon to hear people say that because debt 
has a lower cost of capital than equity, a firm can reduce its 
overall WACC by increasing the amount of debt financing. 
If this strategy works, shouldn’t a firm take on as much debt 
as possible, at least as long as the debt is not risky?
This argument ignores the fact that even if the debt 
is risk free and the firm will not default, adding leverage 
increases the risk of the equity. Given the increase in risk, 
equity holders will demand a higher risk premium and, 
therefore, a higher expected return. The increase in the cost 
of equity exactly offsets the benefit of a greater reliance on 
the cheaper debt capital, so that the firm’s overall cost of 
capital remains unchanged.
Common Mistake
Example 14.6
WACC with Multiple Securities
Problem
Compute the WACC for the entrepreneur’s project with the capital structure described in 
­Example 14.3.
Solution
Because the firm has three securities in its capital structure (debt, equity, and the warrant), its 
weighted average cost of capital is the average return it must pay these three groups of investors:
rwacc = rU =
E
E + D + W
 rE +
D
E + D + W
 rD +
W
E + D + W
 rW
From Example 14.3, we know E = 440, D = 500, and W = 60. What are the expected returns 
for each security? Given the cash flows of the firm, the debt is risk free and has an expected return 
of rD = 5%. The warrant has an expected payoff of 1
2 ($210) + 1
2 ($0) = $105, so its expected 
return is rw = $105/$60 - 1 = 75%. Equity has a payoff of ($1400 - $525 - $210) = $665 
when cash flows are high and ($900 - $525) = $375 when cash flows are low; thus, its 
expected payoff is 1
2 ($665) + 1
2 ($375) = $520. The expected return for equity is then 
rE = $520/$440 - 1 = 18.18%. We can now compute the WACC:
rwacc = $440
$1000
 (18.18%) + $500
$1000
 (5%) +
$60
$1000
 (75%) = 15%
Once again, the firm’s WACC and unlevered cost of capital is 15%, the same as if it were all-
equity financed.
Levered and Unlevered Betas
Note that Eqs. 14.6 and 14.7 for the weighted-average cost of capital match our calcula-
tion in Chapter 12 of a firm’s unlevered cost of capital. There, we showed that a firm’s 
unlevered or asset beta is the weighted average of its equity and debt beta:
	
bU =
E
E + D
 bE +
D
E + D
 bD
(14.8)

	
14.3  Modigliani-Miller II: Leverage, Risk, and the Cost of Capital 	
535
Recall that the unlevered beta measures the market risk of the firm’s underlying assets, 
and thus can be used to assess the cost of capital for comparable investments. When a firm 
changes its capital structure without changing its investments, its unlevered beta will 
remain unaltered. However, its equity beta will change to reflect the effect of the capital 
structure change on its risk.4 Let’s rearrange Eq. 14.8 to solve for bE:
	
bE = bU + D
E
 (bU - bD)
(14.9)
Eq. 14.9 is analogous to Eq. 14.5, with beta replacing the expected returns. It shows that 
the firm’s equity beta also increases with leverage.
4The relationship between leverage and equity betas was developed by R. Hamada in “The Effect of the 
Firm’s Capital Structure on the Systematic Risk of Common Stocks,” Journal of Finance 27(2) (1972): 
435–452; and by M. Rubinstein in “A Mean-Variance Synthesis of Corporate Financial Theory,” Journal 
of Finance 28(1) (1973): 167–181.
Example 14.7
Betas and Leverage
Problem
Suppose drug retailer CVS has an equity beta of 0.8 and a debt-equity ratio of 0.1. Estimate 
its asset beta assuming its debt beta is zero. Suppose CVS were to increase its leverage so that 
its debt-equity ratio was 0.5. Assuming its debt beta were still zero, what would you expect its 
equity beta to be after the increase in leverage?
Solution
We can estimate the unlevered or asset beta for CVS using Eq. 14.8:
bU =
E
E + D
 bE +
D
E + D
 bD =
1
1 + D/E
 bE =
1
1 + 0.1
* 0.8 = 0.73
With the increase in leverage, CVS’s equity beta will increase according to Eq. 14.9:
bE = bU + D
E
 (bU - bD) = 0.73 + 0.5(0.73 - 0) = 1.09
Thus, CVS’s equity beta (and equity cost of capital) will increase with leverage. Note that 
if CVS’s debt beta also increased, the impact of leverage on its equity beta would be somewhat 
lower—if debt holders share some of the firm’s market risk, the equity holders will need to bear 
less of it.
The assets on a firm’s balance sheet include any holdings of cash or risk-free securities. 
Because these holdings are risk-free, they reduce the risk—and therefore the required risk 
premium—of the firm’s assets. For this reason, holding excess cash has the opposite effect 
of leverage on risk and return. From this standpoint, we can view cash as negative debt. 
Thus, as we stated in Chapter 12, when we are trying to assess a firm’s enterprise value—
its business assets separate from any cash holdings—it is natural to measure leverage in 
terms of the firm’s net debt, which is its debt less its holdings of excess cash or short-term 
investments.

Cash and the Cost of Capital
Problem
In August 2015, Cisco Systems had a market capitalization of $140 billion. It had debt of 
$25.4 billion as well as cash and short-term investments of $60.4 billion. Its equity beta was 1.09 
and its debt beta was approximately zero. What was Cisco’s enterprise value at the time? Given a 
risk-free rate of 2% and a market risk premium of 5%, estimate the unlevered cost of capital of 
Cisco’s business.
Solution
Because Cisco had $25.4 billion in debt and $60.4 billion in cash, Cisco’s net debt = $25.4 
- $60.4 billion = -$35.0 billion. Its enterprise value was therefore $140 billion - $35 billion 
= $105 billion.
Given a zero beta for its net debt, Cisco’s unlevered beta was

E + D

 (1.09) + -$35

and we can estimate its unlevered cost of capital as rU = 2% + 1.45 * 5% = 9.25%. Note that 
because of its cash holdings, Cisco’s equity is less risky than its underlying business.

ani won the Nobel Prize in 1985 for his work on personal 
savings and for his capital structure theorems with Miller. 
Miller earned his prize in 1990 for his analysis of portfolio 
theory and capital structure.
Miller once described the MM propositions in an inter-
view this way:
People often ask: Can you summarize your theory 
quickly? Well, I say, you understand the M&M theorem 
if you know why this is a joke: The pizza delivery man 
comes to Yogi Berra after the game and says, “Yogi, how 
do you want this pizza cut, into quarters or eighths?” 
And Yogi says, “Cut it in eight pieces. I’m feeling hungry 
tonight.”
Everyone recognizes that’s a joke because obviously the 
number and shape of the pieces don’t affect the size of 
the pizza. And similarly, the stocks, bonds, warrants, et 
cetera, issued don’t affect the aggregate value of the firm. 
They just slice up the underlying earnings in different 
ways.*
Modigliani and Miller each won the Nobel Prize in 
large part for their observation that the value of a firm 
should be unaffected by its capital structure in per-
fect capital markets. While the intuition underlying the 
MM propositions may be as simple as slicing pizza, their 
implications for corporate finance are far-reaching. The 
propositions imply that the true role of a firm’s financial 
policy is to deal with (and potentially exploit) financial 
market imperfections such as taxes and transactions costs. 
­Modigliani and Miller’s work began a long line of research 
into these market imperfections, which we look at over the 
next several chapters.

14.4	 Capital Structure Fallacies
MM Propositions I and II state that with perfect capital markets, leverage has no effect on 
firm value or the firm’s overall cost of capital. Here we take a critical look at two incorrect 
arguments that are sometimes cited in favor of leverage.
Leverage and Earnings per Share
Leverage can increase a firm’s expected earnings per share. An argument sometimes made 
is that by doing so, leverage should also increase the firm’s stock price.
Consider the following example. Levitron Industries (LVI) is currently an all-equity 
firm. It expects to generate earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $10 million over 
the next year. Currently, LVI has 10 million shares outstanding, and its stock is trading for 
a price of $7.50 per share. LVI is considering changing its capital structure by borrowing 
$15 million at an interest rate of 8% and using the proceeds to repurchase 2 million shares 
at $7.50 per share.
Let’s consider the consequences of this transaction in a setting of perfect capital markets. 
Suppose LVI has no debt. Because LVI pays no interest, and because in perfect capital mar-
kets there are no taxes, LVI’s earnings would equal its EBIT. Therefore, without debt, LVI 
would expect earnings per share of
EPS =
Earnings
Number of Shares = $10 million
10 million = $1
The new debt will obligate LVI to make interest payments each year of
$15 million * 8% interest/year = $1.2 million/year
As a result, LVI will have expected earnings after interest of
Earnings = EBIT - Interest = $10 million - $1.2 million = $8.8 million
The interest payments on the debt will cause LVI’s total earnings to fall. But because the 
number of outstanding shares will also have fallen to 10 million - 2 million = 8 million 
shares after the share repurchase, LVI’s expected earnings per share is
EPS = $8.8 million
8 million
= $1.10
As we can see, LVI’s expected earnings per share increases with leverage.5 This increase 
might appear to make shareholders better off and could potentially lead to an increase in 
the stock price. Yet we know from MM Proposition I that as long as the securities are fairly 
priced, these financial transactions have an NPV of zero and offer no benefit to ­shareholders. 
How can we reconcile these seemingly contradictory results?
The answer is that the risk of earnings has changed. Thus far, we have considered only 
expected earnings per share. We have not considered the consequences of this transaction 
on the risk of the earnings. To do so, we must determine the effect of the increase in lever-
age on earnings per share in a variety of scenarios.
Suppose earnings before interest payments are only $4 million. Without the increase in 
leverage, EPS would be $4 million , 10 million shares = $0.40. With the new debt, how-
ever, earnings after interest payments would be $4 million - $1.2 million = $2.8 million, 
leading to earnings per share of $2.8 million , 8 million shares = $0.35. So, when 
5More generally, leverage will increase expected EPS whenever the firm’s after-tax borrowing cost is less 
than the ratio of expected earnings to the share price (i.e., the reciprocal of its forward P/E multiple, also 
called the earnings yield ⁜渠屮). For LVI, with no taxes, 8% 6 EPS/P = 1/7.50 = 13.33%.

Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 
earnings are low, leverage will cause EPS to fall even further than it otherwise would have. 
Figure 14.2 presents a range of scenarios.
As Figure  14.2 shows, if earnings before interest exceed $6 million, then EPS is 
higher with leverage. When earnings fall below $6 million, however, EPS is lower with 
leverage than without it. In fact, if earnings before interest fall below $1.2 million 
(the level of the interest expense), then after interest LVI will have negative EPS. So, 
although LVI’s expected EPS rises with leverage, the risk of its EPS also increases. The 
increased risk can be seen because the line showing EPS with leverage in Figure 14.2 is 
steeper than the line without leverage, implying that the same fluctuation in EBIT will 
lead to greater fluctuations in EPS once leverage is introduced. Taken together, these 
observations are consistent with MM Proposition I. While EPS increases on average, 
this increase is necessary to compensate shareholders for the additional risk they are tak-
ing, so LVI’s share price does not increase as a result of the transaction. Let’s check this 
result in an example.
Example 14.9
The MM Propositions and Earnings per Share
Problem
Assume that LVI’s EBIT is not expected to grow in the future and that all earnings are paid as 
dividends. Use MM Propositions I and II to show that the increase in expected EPS for LVI will 
not lead to an increase in the share price.
Solution
Without leverage, expected earnings per share and therefore dividends are $1 each year, and the 
share price is $7.50. Let rU be LVI’s cost of capital without leverage. Then we can value LVI as 
a perpetuity:
P = 7.50 = Div
rU
= EPS
rU
= 1.00
rU
Therefore, LVI’s current share price implies rU = 1/7.50 = 13.33%.
The market value of LVI stock without leverage is $7.50 per share *10 million shares = $75  
 million. If LVI uses debt to repurchase $15 million worth of the firm’s equity (that is, 2 
­million shares), then the remaining equity will be worth $75 million - $15 million = $60 
Figure 14.2 
LVI Earnings per Share 
with and without 
Leverage
The sensitivity of EPS to EBIT 
is higher for a levered firm 
than for an unlevered firm. 
Thus, given assets with the 
same risk, the EPS of a levered 
firm is more volatile.

539
Because the firm’s earnings per share and price-earnings ratio are affected by leverage, 
we cannot reliably compare these measures across firms with different capital structures. 
The same is true for accounting-based performance measures such as return on equity 
(ROE). Therefore, most analysts prefer to use performance measures and valuation mul-
tiples that are based on the firm’s earnings before interest has been deducted. For example, 
the ratio of enterprise value to EBIT (or EBITDA) is more useful when analyzing firms 
with very different capital structures than is comparing their P/E ratios.
million according to MM Proposition I. After the transaction, LVI’s debt-equity ratio is 
$15 million , $60 million = 1
4. Using MM Proposition II, LVI’s equity cost of capital with 
leverage will be
rE = rU + D
E
 (rU - rD ) = 13.33% + 1
4
 (13.33% - 8%) = 14.66%
Given that expected EPS is now $1.10 per share, the new value of the shares equals
P = $1.10
rE
= $1.10
14.66% = $7.50 per share
Thus, even though EPS is higher, due to the additional risk, shareholders will demand a higher 
return. These effects cancel out, so the price per share is unchanged.
Bank Capital Regulation and the ROE Fallacy
average, though it will raise the ROE in bad times. But this 
decrease in average ROE is compensated for by a reduction 
in the riskiness of equity and therefore the required risk pre-
mium. Thus, from an investor’s perspective, the reduction  
in ROE that results solely from a decrease in leverage does 
not make investing in the firm any less attractive. Franco 
Modigliani and Merton Miller were awarded the Nobel 
Prize for pointing out that in a perfect market the bank’s 
capital structure cannot affect its competitiveness.
The only way a change in leverage can affect the “attrac-
tiveness” of equity (and the competitiveness of banks) is if 
there is a market imperfection. In the next two chapters  
we will discuss these imperfections and explain why they 
do give banks a strong incentive to maximize their lever- 
age. Unfortunately, the most important imperfections derive 
from government subsidies, so the banks’ gains from lever-
age come largely at taxpayer expense.
*Prior to the financial crisis, global regulatory standards allowed banks 
to have as little as 2% equity funding. In 2013 the new Basel III Accord 
raised this equity requirement to 3% of total assets (and 4.5% of risk-
weighted assets). Many countries impose even stricter requirements for 
systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs); for example the 
U.S. requires at least 6% for its largest banks.
**J. Ackermann, “The new architecture of financial regulation: Will it 
prevent another crisis?” Special Paper 194, FMG Deutsche Bank Con-
ference, London School of Economics, October 2010.
In banking jargon, a “capital requirement” obligates a bank 
to finance itself with a certain minimum amount of equity 
to ensure that its debt-to-equity ratio will stay below a set 
level. The permitted level of leverage is very high—interna-
tional standards allow common equity to represent as little 
as 3% of a bank’s total funding.* To put this number in per-
spective, the equity of a typical non-financial firm exceeds 
50% of firm value. Such extreme leverage makes bank 
equity very risky.
These extreme levels of bank leverage were an important 
contributing factor to the financial meltdown in 2008 and 
the subsequent recession: With such a small equity cushion, 
even a minor drop in asset values can lead to insolvency. 
While stricter international rules post crisis have required 
banks to reduce leverage, many policymakers believe capital 
requirements should be increased even further to reduce the 
risk of the financial sector and the consequent spillovers to 
the broader economy.
Bankers counter that decreased leverage will lower their 
return on equity, limiting their ability to compete effectively. 
According to Josef Ackermann, then CEO of Deutsche 
Bank, new capital requirements would “depress ROE to 
levels that make investment into the banking sector unat-
tractive relative to other business sectors.”** The return on 
equity is indeed a function of the firm’s leverage. As with 
EPS, lower leverage will tend to decrease the firm’s ROE on

Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 
Equity Issuances and Dilution
Another often-heard fallacy is that issuing equity will dilute existing shareholders’ owner-
ship, so debt financing should be used instead. By dilution, the proponents of this fallacy 
mean that if the firm issues new shares, the cash flows generated by the firm must be 
divided among a larger number of shares, thereby reducing the value of each individual 
share. The problem with this line of reasoning is that it ignores the fact that the cash raised 
by issuing new shares will increase the firm’s assets. Let’s consider an example.
Suppose Jet Sky Airlines (JSA) is a highly successful discount airline serving the south-
eastern United States. It currently has no debt and 500 million shares of stock outstanding. 
These shares are currently trading at $16. Last month the firm announced that it would 
expand its operations to the Northeast. The expansion will require the purchase of $1 bil-
lion of new planes, which will be financed by issuing new equity. How will the share price 
change when the new equity is issued today?
Based on the current share price of the firm (prior to the issue), the equity and therefore 
the assets of the firm have a market value of 500 million shares * $16 per share = $8 billion. 
Because the expansion decision has already been made and announced, in perfect capital 
markets this value incorporates the NPV associated with the expansion.
Suppose JSA sells 62.5 million new shares at the current price of $16 per share to raise 
the additional $1 billion needed to purchase the planes.

Two things happen when JSA issues equity. First, the market value of its assets grows 
because of the additional $1 billion in cash the firm has raised. Second, the number of 
shares increases. Although the number of shares has grown to 562.5 million, the value per 
share is unchanged: $9 billion , 562.5 million shares = $16 per share.
In general, as long as the firm sells the new shares of equity at a fair price, there will be no gain 
or loss to shareholders associated with the equity issue itself. The money taken in by the firm as a 
result of the share issue exactly offsets the dilution of the shares. Any gain or loss associated with the 
transaction will result from the NPV of the investments the firm makes with the funds raised.6
Concept Check	
1.	 If a change in leverage raises a firm’s earnings per share, should this cause its share price to rise in 
a perfect market?
	
2.	 True or False: When a firm issues equity, it increases the supply of its shares in the market, which 
should cause its share price to fall.
6If JSA had outstanding debt, issuing new equity might reduce its risk, benefiting debt holders at share-
holders expense. We will discuss this debt overhang effect in Chapter 16.

14.5	 MM: Beyond the Propositions
Since the publication of their original paper, Modigliani and Miller’s ideas have greatly 
influenced finance research and practice. Perhaps more important than the specific 
­propositions themselves is the approach that MM took to derive them. Proposition I was 
one of the first arguments to show that the Law of One Price could have strong implica-
tions for security prices and firm values in a competitive market; it marks the beginning of 
the modern theory of corporate finance.
Modigliani and Miller’s work formalized a new way of thinking about financial markets 
that was first put forth by John Burr Williams in his 1938 book, The Theory of Investment 
Value. In it Williams argues:
If the investment value of an enterprise as a whole is by definition the present worth of 
all its future distributions to security holders, whether on interest or dividend account, 
then this value in no wise depends on what the company’s capitalization is. Clearly, 
if a single individual or a single institutional investor owned all of the bonds, stocks 
and warrants issued by the corporation, it would not matter to this investor what the 
company’s capitalization was (except for details concerning the income tax). Any earn-
ings collected as interest could not be collected as dividends. To such an individual it 
would be perfectly obvious that total interest- and dividend-paying power was in no 
wise dependent on the kind of securities issued to the company’s owner. Furthermore 
no change in the investment value of the enterprise as a whole would result from a 
change in its capitalization. Bonds could be retired with stock issues, or two classes of 
junior securities could be combined into one, without changing the investment value of 
the company as a whole. Such constancy of investment value is analogous to the inde-
structibility of matter or energy: it leads us to speak of the Law of the Conservation of 
Investment Value, just as physicists speak of the Law of the Conservation of Matter, or 
the Law of the Conservation of Energy.
Thus, the results in this chapter can be interpreted more broadly as the conservation of 
value principle for financial markets: With perfect capital markets, financial transactions 
neither add nor destroy value, but instead represent a repackaging of risk (and therefore return).
The conservation of value principle extends far beyond questions of debt versus 
equity or even capital structure. It implies that any financial transaction that appears 
to be a good deal in terms of adding value either is too good to be true or is exploit-
ing some type of market imperfection. To make sure the value is not illusory, it is 
important to identify the market imperfection that is the source of value. In the next 
several chapters we will ­examine different types of market imperfections and the poten-
tial sources of value that they introduce for the firm’s capital structure choice and other 
financial transactions.
Concept Check

answers would you give based on the Modigliani-Miller Propositions? What considerations should 
the capital structure decision be based on?
	
2.	 State the conservation of value principle for financial markets.

14.1  Equity Versus Debt Financing
	
n	 The collection of securities a firm issues to raise capital from investors is called the firm’s capital 
structure. Equity and debt are the securities most commonly used by firms. When equity is 
used without debt, the firm is said to be unlevered. Otherwise, the amount of debt determines 
the firm’s leverage.
	
n	 The owner of a firm should choose the capital structure that maximizes the total value of the 
securities issued.
14.2  Modigliani-Miller I: Leverage, Arbitrage, and Firm Value
	
n	 Capital markets are said to be perfect if they satisfy three conditions:
n	 Investors and firms can trade the same set of securities at competitive market prices equal to 
the present value of their future cash flows.
n	 There are no taxes, transaction costs, or issuance costs associated with security trading.
n	 A firm’s financing decisions do not change the cash flows generated by its investments, nor 
do they reveal new information about them.
	
n	 According to MM Proposition I, with perfect capital markets the value of a firm is independent 
of its capital structure.
n	 With perfect capital markets, homemade leverage is a perfect substitute for firm leverage.
n	 If otherwise identical firms with different capital structures have different values, the Law of 
One Price would be violated and an arbitrage opportunity would exist.
	
n	 The market value balance sheet shows that the total market value of a firm’s assets equals the 
total market value of the firm’s liabilities, including all securities issued to investors. Changing 
the capital structure therefore alters how the value of the assets is divided across securities, but 
not the firm’s total value.
	
n	 A firm can change its capital structure at any time by issuing new securities and using the 
funds to pay its existing investors. An example is a leveraged recapitalization in which the firm 
borrows money (issues debt) and repurchases shares (or pays a dividend). MM Proposition I 
implies that such transactions will not change the share price.
14.3  Modigliani-Miller II: Leverage, Risk, and the Cost of Capital
	
n	 According to MM Proposition II, the cost of capital for levered equity is
	
rE = rU + D
E
 (rU - rD)
(14.5)
	
n	 Debt is less risky than equity, so it has a lower cost of capital. Leverage increases the risk of 
equity, however, raising the equity cost of capital. The benefit of debt’s lower cost of capital 
is offset by the higher equity cost of capital, leaving a firm’s weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC) unchanged with perfect capital markets:
	
rwacc = rA = rU =
E
E + D
 rE +

Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 

	
n	 Leverage increases the beta of a firm’s equity:
	
bE = bU + D
E
 ( bU - bD )
(14.9)
	
n	 A firm’s net debt is equal to its debt less its holdings of cash and other risk-free securities. We 
can compute the cost of capital and the beta of the firm’s business assets, excluding cash, by 
using its net debt when calculating its WACC or unlevered beta.
14.4  Capital Structure Fallacies
	
n	 Leverage can raise a firm’s expected earnings per share and its return on equity, but it also 
increases the volatility of earnings per share and the riskiness of its equity. As a result, in a 
perfect market shareholders are not better off and the value of equity is unchanged.
	
n	 As long as shares are sold to investors at a fair price, there is no cost of dilution associated with 
issuing equity. While the number of shares increases when equity is issued, the firm’s assets also 
increase because of the cash raised, and the per-share value of equity remains unchanged.
14.5  MM: Beyond the Propositions
	
n	 With perfect capital markets, financial transactions are a zero-NPV activity that neither add nor 
destroy value on their own, but rather repackage the firm’s risk and return. Capital structure—
and financial transactions more generally—affect a firm’s value only because of its impact on 
some type of market imperfection.

Modigliani-Miller II: Leverage, Risk, and the Cost of Capital
	
10.	 Explain what is wrong with the following argument: “If a firm issues debt that is risk free, 
because there is no possibility of default, the risk of the firm’s equity does not change. There-
fore, risk-free debt allows the firm to get the benefit of a low cost of capital of debt without 
raising its cost of capital of equity.”
	
11.	 Consider the entrepreneur described in Section 14.1 (and referenced in Tables 14.1–14.3). 
Suppose she funds the project by borrowing $750 rather than $500.
a.	 According to MM Proposition I, what is the value of the equity? What are its cash flows if 
the economy is strong? What are its cash flows if the economy is weak?
b.	 What is the return of the equity in each case? What is its expected return?
c.	 What is the risk premium of equity in each case? What is the sensitivity of the levered equity 
return to systematic risk? How does its sensitivity compare to that of unlevered equity? How 
does its risk premium compare to that of unlevered equity?
d.	What is the debt-equity ratio of the firm in this case?
e.	 What is the firm’s WACC in this case?
	
12.	 Hardmon Enterprises is currently an all-equity firm with an expected return of 12%. It is 
­considering a leveraged recapitalization in which it would borrow and repurchase existing 
shares.
a.	 Suppose Hardmon borrows to the point that its debt-equity ratio is 0.50. With this amount 
of debt, the debt cost of capital is 5%. What will the expected return of equity be after this 
transaction?
b.	 Suppose instead Hardmon borrows to the point that its debt-equity ratio is 1.50. With this 
amount of debt, Hardmon’s debt will be much riskier. As a result, the debt cost of capital 
will be 7%. What will the expected return of equity be in this case?
c.	 A senior manager argues that it is in the best interest of the shareholders to choose the capital 
structure that leads to the highest expected return for the stock. How would you respond to 
this argument?
	
13.	 Suppose Visa Inc. (V) has no debt and an equity cost of capital of 9.2%. The average debt-to-
value ratio for the credit services industry is 13%. What would its cost of equity be if it took 
on the average amount of debt for its industry at a cost of debt of 6%?
	
14.	 Global Pistons (GP) has common stock with a market value of $470 million and debt with a

Data Case
You work in the corporate finance division of The Home Depot and your boss has asked you to 
review the firm’s capital structure. Specifically, your boss is considering changing the firm’s debt level. 
Your boss remembers something from his MBA program about capital structure being irrelevant, but 
isn’t quite sure what that means. You know that capital structure is irrelevant under the conditions 
of perfect markets and will demonstrate this point for your boss by showing that the weighted aver-
age cost of capital remains constant under various levels of debt. So, for now, suppose that capital 
markets are perfect as you prepare responses for your boss.

Chapter 14  Capital Structure in a Perfect Market 

You would like to analyze relatively modest changes to Home Depot’s capital structure. You 
would like to consider two scenarios: the firm issues $1 billion in new debt to repurchase stock, and 
the firm issues $1 billion in new stock to repurchase debt. Use Excel to answer the following ques-
tions using Eqs. 14.5 and 14.6, and assuming a cost of unlevered equity (rU) of 12%.
	
1.	 Obtain the financial information you need for Home Depot.
a.	 Go to www.nasdaq.com, and click “Quotes.” Enter Home Depot’s stock symbol (HD) and 
click “Summary Quotes.” From the Stock Quote & Summary Data page, get the current stock 
price. Click “Stock Report” in the left column and find the number of shares outstanding.
b.	 Click “Income Statement” and the annual income statement should appear. Put the cursor in 
the middle of the statement, right-click your mouse, and select “Export to Microsoft Excel.” 
(You will not need the income statement until Chapter 15, but collect all of the background data 
in one step.) On the Web page, click the Balance Sheet tab. Export the balance sheet to Excel as 
well and then cut and paste the balance sheet to the same worksheet as the income statement.
c.	 To get the cost of debt for Home Depot, go to NASD BondInfo (finra-markets.morningstar
.com). Under “Market Data,” select “Bonds,” then select the “Search” option, enter Home 
Depot’s symbol, select the “Corporate” Bond Type and click “Show Results.” The next page 
will contain information for all of Home Depot’s outstanding and recently matured bonds. 
Select the latest yield on an outstanding bond with the shortest remaining maturity (the 
maturity date is on the line describing each issue; sometimes the list also contains recently 
retired bonds, so make sure not to use one of those). For simplicity, since you are just trying 
to illustrate the main concepts for your boss, you may use the existing yield on the outstand-
ing bond as rD.
	
2.	 Compute the market D/E ratio for Home Depot. Approximate the market value of debt by the 
book value of net debt; include both Long-Term Debt and Short-Term Debt/Current Portion of 
Long-Term Debt from the balance sheet and subtract any cash holdings. Use the stock price and 
number of shares outstanding to calculate the market value of equity.
	
3.	 Compute the cost of levered equity (rE ) for Home Depot using their current market debt-to-
equity ratio and Eq. 14.5.
	
4.	 Compute the current weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for Home Depot using Eq. 14.6 
given their current debt-to-equity ratio.
	
5.	 Repeat Steps 3 and 4 for the two scenarios you would like to analyze, issuing $1 billion in debt 
to repurchase stock, and issuing $1 billion in stock to repurchase debt. (Although you realize that 
the cost of debt capital rD may change with changes in leverage, for these modestly small changes 
you decide to assume that rD remains constant. We will explore the relation between changing 
leverage and changing rD more fully in Chapter 24.) What is the market D/E ratio in each of 
these cases?
	
6.	 Prepare a written explanation for your boss explaining the relationship between capital structure 
and the cost of capital in this exercise.
	
7.	 What implicit assumptions in this exercise generate the results found in Question 5? How might 
your results differ in the “real world”?

Debt and Taxes
IN a perFeCt CapItaL MarKet, the LaW OF ONe prICe implieS that 
all financial transactions have an NPV of zero and ­neither ­create nor destroy value. 
­Consequently, in Chapter 14, we found that the choice of debt versus equity financing 
does not affect the value of a firm: The funds raised from issuing debt equal the present 
value of the future ­interest and principal payments the firm will make. While leverage 
increases the risk and cost of capital of the firm’s equity, the firm’s weighted average cost 
of capital (WACC), total value, and share price are unaltered by a change in leverage. 
That is, in a perfect capital market, a firm’s choice of capital ­structure is unimportant.
This statement is at odds, however, with the observation that firms invest significant 
resources, both in terms of managerial time and effort and investment banking fees, in manag-
ing their capital structures. In many instances, the choice of leverage is of critical importance 
to a firm’s value and future success. As we will show, there are large and systematic variations 
in the typical capital structures for different industries. For example, in August 2015, Amgen, 
a biotechnology and drug company, had debt of $32 billion, cash of $30 billion, and equity 
worth more than $126 billion, giving the firm a market debt-equity ratio of 0.25, with very 
little net debt. In contrast, Navistar International, an auto and truck manufacturer, had a debt-
equity ratio of 3.7. Truck manufacturers in general have higher debt ratios than biotechnology 
and drug companies. If capital structure is unimportant, why do we see such consistent differ-
ences in capital structures across firms and industries? Why do managers dedicate so much 
time, effort, and expense to the capital structure choice?
As Modigliani and Miller made clear in their original work, capital structure does 
not matter in perfect capital markets. Recall from ­Chapter  14 that a perfect capital 
­market exists under the following assumptions:
	
1.	 Investors and firms can trade the same set of securities at competitive market 
prices equal to the present value of their future cash flows.

Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
	
15.1	 The Interest Tax Deduction
Corporations must pay taxes on the income that they earn. Because they pay taxes on 
their profits after interest payments are deducted, interest expenses reduce the amount of 
corporate tax firms must pay. This feature of the tax code creates an incentive to use debt.
Let’s consider the impact of interest expenses on the taxes paid by Macy’s, Inc., a retail 
department store. Macy’s had earnings before interest and taxes of approximately 
$2.8 billion in 2014, and interest expenses of about $400 million. Given Macy’s marginal 
corporate tax rate of 35%,1 the effect of leverage on Macy’s earnings is shown in Table 15.1.
1Macy’s paid an average tax rate of approximately 36.2 % in 2014, after accounting for other credits and 
deferrals. Because we are interested in the impact of a change in leverage, Macy’s marginal tax rate—the 
tax rate that would apply to additional taxable income—is relevant to our discussion.
	
	
2.  There are no taxes, transaction costs, or issuance costs associated with security trading.
	
	
3.  A firm’s financing decisions do not change the cash flows generated by its investments, nor do 
they reveal new information about them.
Thus, if capital structure does matter, then it must stem from a market imperfection. In this chapter, 
we focus on one such imperfection—taxes. Corporations and investors must pay taxes on the income 
they earn from their investments. As we will see, a firm can enhance its value by using leverage to mini-
mize the taxes it, and its investors, pay.

With leverage, Macy’s was able to pay out $1960 million in total to its investors, versus 
only $1820 million without leverage, representing an increase of $140 million.
As we can see from Table 15.1, Macy’s net income in 2014 was lower with leverage than 
it would have been without leverage. Thus, Macy’s debt obligations reduced the income 
available to equity holders. But more importantly, the total amount available to all inves-
tors was higher with leverage:

	
15.1  The Interest Tax Deduction	
553
It might seem odd that a firm can be better off with leverage even though its earnings 
are lower. But recall from Chapter 14 that the value of a firm is the total amount it can 
raise from all investors, not just equity holders. Because leverage allows the firm to pay out 
more in total to its investors—including interest payments to debt holders—it will be able 
to raise more total capital initially.
Where does the additional $140 million come from? Looking at Table 15.1, we can see 
that this gain is equal to the reduction in taxes with leverage: $980 million - $840 million 
= $140 million. Because Macy’s does not owe taxes on the $400 million of earnings it used 
to make interest payments, this $400 million is shielded from the corporate tax, providing 
the tax savings of 35% * $400 million = $140 million.
In general, the gain to investors from the tax deductibility of interest payments is 
referred to as the interest tax shield. The interest tax shield is the additional amount that 
a firm would have paid in taxes if it did not have leverage. We can calculate the amount of 
the interest tax shield each year as follows:
	
Interest Tax Shield = Corporate Tax Rate * Interest Payments
(15.1)
Example 15.1
Computing the Interest Tax Shield
Problem
Suppose that shown below is the income statement for D.F. Builders (DFB). Given its marginal 
corporate tax rate of 35%, what is the amount of the interest tax shield for DFB in years 2012 
through 2015?
Solution
From Eq. 15.1, the interest tax shield is the tax rate of 35% multiplied by the interest payments 
in each year:
Thus, the interest tax shield enabled DFB to pay an additional $115.5 million to its investors 
over this period.

Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
Concept Check	
1.	 With corporate income taxes, explain why a firm’s value can be higher with ­leverage even though 
its earnings are lower.
	
2.	 What is the interest tax shield?
	
15.2	 Valuing the Interest Tax Shield
When a firm uses debt, the interest tax shield provides a corporate tax benefit each year. To 
determine the benefit of leverage for the value of the firm, we must compute the present 
value of the stream of future interest tax shields the firm will receive.
The Interest Tax Shield and Firm Value
Each year a firm makes interest payments, the cash flows it pays to investors will be higher 
than they would be without leverage by the amount of the interest tax shield:
¢Cash Flows to Investors
with Leverage
≤= ¢Cash Flows to Investors
without Leverage
≤+ (Interest Tax Shield)
Figure 15.1 illustrates this relationship. Here you can see how each dollar of pretax cash 
flows is divided. The firm uses some fraction to pay taxes, and it pays the rest to investors. 
By increasing the amount paid to debt holders through interest payments, the amount of 
the pretax cash flows that must be paid as taxes decreases. The gain in total cash flows to 
investors is the interest tax shield.
Because the cash flows of the levered firm are equal to the sum of the cash flows from 
the unlevered firm plus the interest tax shield, by the Law of One Price the same must be 
true for the present values of these cash flows. Thus, letting V L and V U represent the value 
of the firm with and without leverage, respectively, we have the following change to MM 
Proposition I in the presence of taxes:
The total value of the levered firm exceeds the value of the firm without leverage due to the 
present value of the tax savings from debt:
	
V L = V U + PV(Interest Tax Shield)
(15.2)
Figure 15.1 
The Cash Flows of the Unlevered and Levered Firm
By increasing the cash 
flows paid to debt ­holders 
through ­interest payments, 
a firm reduces the amount 
paid in taxes. Cash flows 
paid to investors are shown 
in blue. The increase in 
total cash flows paid to 
investors is the ­interest tax 
shield. (The ­figure assumes

Clearly, there is an important tax advantage to the use of debt financing. But how large 
is this tax benefit? To compute the increase in the firm’s total value associated with the 
interest tax shield, we need to forecast how a firm’s debt—and therefore its interest pay-
ments—will vary over time. Given a forecast of future interest payments, we can determine 
the interest tax shield and compute its present value by discounting it at a rate that cor-
responds to its risk.
Example 15.2
Valuing the Interest Tax Shield without Risk
Problem
Suppose DFB plans to pay $100 million in interest each year for the next 10 years, and then to 
repay the principal of $2 billion in year 10. These payments are risk free, and DFB’s marginal tax 
rate will remain 35% throughout this period. If the risk-free interest rate is 5%, by how much 
does the interest tax shield increase the value of DFB?
Solution
In this case, the interest tax shield is 35% * $100 million = $35 million each year for the next 
10 years. Therefore, we can value it as a 10-year annuity. Because the tax savings are known and 
not risky, we can discount them at the 5% risk-free rate:
 PV(Interest Tax Shield) = $35 million *
1
0.05
 ¢1 -
1
1.0510 ≤
 = $270 million
The final repayment of principal in year 10 is not deductible, so it does not contribute to the 
tax shield.
Pizza and Taxes
In Chapter 14, we mentioned the pizza analogy that ­Merton 
Miller once used to describe the MM Propositions with 
­perfect capital markets: No matter how you slice it, you still 
have the same amount of pizza.
We can extend this analogy to the setting with taxes, but 
the story is a bit different. In this case, every time equity hold-
ers get a slice of pizza, Uncle Sam gets a slice as a tax payment. 
But when debt holders get a slice, there is no tax. Thus, by 
allocating more slices to debt holders rather than to equity 
holders, more pizza will be available to investors. While the 
total amount of pizza does not change, there is more pizza left 
over for investors to consume because less pizza is consumed 
by Uncle Sam in taxes.
The Interest Tax Shield with Permanent Debt
In Example 15.2, we know with certainty the firm’s future interest payments and associ-
ated tax savings. In practice, this case is rare. Typically, the level of future interest payments 
varies due to changes the firm makes in the amount of debt outstanding, changes in the 
interest rate on that debt, and the risk that the firm may default and fail to make an interest 
payment. In addition, the firm’s marginal tax rate may fluctuate due to changes in the tax 
code and changes in the firm’s income bracket.
Rather than attempting to account for all possibilities here, let’s consider the special case 
in which the firm issues debt and plans to keep the dollar amount of debt constant forever.2 
2We discuss how to value the interest tax shield with more complicated leverage policies in Chapter 18.

556	
Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
For example, the firm might issue a perpetual consol bond, making only interest payments 
but never repaying the principal. More realistically, suppose the firm issues short-term debt, 
such as a five-year coupon bond. When the principal is due, the firm raises the money 
needed to pay it by issuing new debt. In this way, the firm never pays off the principal but 
simply refinances it whenever it comes due. In this situation, the debt is effectively 
permanent.
Many large firms have a policy of maintaining a certain amount of debt on their balance 
sheets. As old bonds and loans mature, new borrowing takes place. The key assumption 
here is that the firm maintains a fixed dollar amount of outstanding debt, rather than an 
amount that changes with the size of the firm.
Suppose a firm borrows debt D and keeps the debt permanently. If the firm’s marginal 
tax rate is tc, and if the debt is riskless with a risk-free interest rate rf , then the interest tax 
shield each year is tc * rf * D, and we can value the tax shield as a perpetuity:
 PV (Interest Tax Shield) = tc * Interest
rf
=
tc * (rf * D)
rf
 = tc * D
The above calculation assumes the debt is risk free and the risk-free interest rate is ­constant. 
These assumptions are not necessary, however. As long as the debt is fairly priced, no arbi-
trage implies that its market value must equal the present value of the future interest 
payments:3
	
Market Value of Debt = D = PV(Future Interest Payments)
(15.3)
If the firm’s marginal tax rate is constant,4 then we have the following general formula:
Value of the Interest Tax Shield of Permanent Debt
	
 PV(Interest Tax Shield) = PV(tc * Future Interest Payments)
	
 = tc * PV(Future Interest Payments)
	
 = tc * D
(15.4)
This formula shows the magnitude of the interest tax shield. Given a 35% corporate tax 
rate, it implies that for every $1 in new permanent debt that the firm issues, the value of 
the firm increases by $0.35.
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital with Taxes
The tax benefit of leverage can also be expressed in terms of the weighted average cost of 
capital. When a firm uses debt financing, the cost of the interest it must pay is offset to 
some extent by the tax savings from the interest tax shield. For example, suppose a firm 
3Equation 15.3 holds even if interest rates fluctuate and the debt is risky. It requires only that the firm 
never repay the principal on the debt (it either refinances or defaults on the principal). The result follows 
by the same argument used in Chapter 9 to show that the price of equity should equal the present value 
of all future dividends.
4The tax rate may not be constant if the firm’s taxable income fluctuates sufficiently to change the firm’s 
tax bracket (we discuss this possibility further in Section 15.5).

The Repatriation Tax: Why Some Cash-Rich Firms Borrow
In April 2013, Apple Inc. borrowed $17 billion in what was 
then the largest U.S. corporate bond issuance of all time. 
But why would a firm with over $100 billion in cash on 
hand need to borrow money? The answer is that while Apple 
indeed had plenty of cash, the vast majority of that cash was 
overseas, and bringing it back to the U.S. would trigger a 
tax liability in excess of 20%, which Apple wanted to avoid.
Apple’s situation is not uncommon. When U.S. firms 
earn profits overseas, those profits are subject to the foreign 
corporate tax of the country in which they are earned. But 
if the profits are then “repatriated” by bringing them back 
to the U.S. rather than investing them abroad, the firm will 
owe the difference between the foreign tax paid and the 
U.S. corporate tax rate. Because foreign corporate tax rates 
are often very low—for example, 12.5% in Ireland versus 
35% in the U.S.—this so-called repatriation tax can be 
a significant cost. Rather than bear this cost, many firms 
choose to hold the funds abroad in the form of bonds or 
other marketable securities, and raise the cash they need 
in the U.S. by issuing bonds domestically. In Apple’s case, 
the $17 billion it borrowed was then used to conduct share 
repurchases.
So, by holding cash overseas and borrowing at home, 
firms can avoid or at least delay paying additional taxes on 
their foreign earnings. Many firms have adopted this strat-
egy in recent years: Shown below are the growth in aggregate 
cash held overseas by all U.S. corporations, as well as the cash 
holdings and debt outstanding of several large firms in 2015. 
To encourage firms to invest more at home, Congress 
enacted a one-time “tax holiday” in 2004, allowing firms to 
repatriate funds at a reduced cost though the policy failed 
to have much effect. Recent calls by both Democrats and 
Republicans for a more permanent change to the tax code 
to reduce or eliminate this repatriation tax have so far been 
unsuccessful, but in the meantime firms continue to borrow 
and delay paying the tax in hopes of such change.

with a 35% tax rate borrows $100,000 at 10% interest per year. Then its net cost at the 
end of the year is
The effective cost of the debt is only $6,500/$100,000 = 6.50% of the loan amount, 
rather than the full 10% interest. Thus, the tax deductibility of interest lowers the effective 
cost of debt financing for the firm. More generally,5
With tax-deductible interest, the effective after-tax borrowing rate is r(1 - tc).
In Chapter 14, we showed that without taxes, the firm’s WACC was equal to its ­unlevered 
cost of capital, which is the average return that the firm must pay to its investors (equity hold-
ers and debt holders). The tax-deductibility of interest payments, however, lowers the effective 
after-tax cost of debt to the firm. As we discussed in Chapter 12, we can account for the benefit 
of the interest tax shield by calculating the WACC using the effective after-tax cost of debt:
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (After Tax)6
	
rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD(1 - tc)
(15.5)
The WACC represents the effective cost of capital to the firm, after including the ben-
efits of the interest tax shield. It is therefore lower than the pretax WACC, which is the 
average return paid to the firm’s investors. From Eq. 15.5, we have the following relation-
ship between the WACC and the firm’s pretax WACC:
	
rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD -
D
E + D


(15.6)
As we will show in Chapter 18, even in the presence of taxes, a firm’s target leverage ratio 
does not affect the firm’s pretax WACC, which equals its unlevered cost of capital and 
depends only on the risk of the firm’s assets.7 Thus, the higher the firm’s leverage, the 
more the firm exploits the tax advantage of debt, and the lower its WACC is. Figure 15.2 
illustrates this decline in the WACC with the firm’s leverage ratio.
The Interest Tax Shield with a Target Debt-Equity Ratio
Earlier we calculated the value of the tax shield assuming the firm maintains a constant 
level of debt. In many cases this assumption is unrealistic—rather than maintain a constant 
5We derived this same result in Chapter 5 when considering the implications of tax-deductible interest for 
individuals (e.g., with a home mortgage).
6We will derive this formula in Chapter 18. See Chapter 12 for methods of estimating the cost of debt 
(and Eqs. 12.12 and 12.13 on page 461 in the context of the WACC.)
7Specifically, if the firm adjusts its leverage to maintain a target debt-equity ratio or interest coverage ratio, 
then its pretax WACC remains constant and equal to its unlevered cost of capital. See Chapter 18 for a full 
discussion of the relationship between the firm’s levered and unlevered costs of capital.

level of debt, many firms target a specific debt-equity ratio instead. When a firm does so, 
the level of its debt will grow (or shrink) with the size of the firm.
As we will show formally in Chapter 18, when a firm adjusts its debt over time so that 
its debt-equity ratio is expected to remain constant, we can compute its value with leverage, 
V L, by discounting its free cash flow using the WACC. The value of the interest tax shield 
can be found by comparing V L to the unlevered value, V U, of the free cash flow discounted 
at the firm’s unlevered cost of capital, the pretax WACC.

The WACC with and without Corporate Taxes
We compute the WACC as a function of the firm’s target debt-to-value ratio using Eq. 15.5. 
As shown in Figure 14.1, the firm’s unlevered cost of capital or pretax WACC is constant, reflect-
ing the required return of the firm’s investors based on the risk of the firm’s assets. However, the 
(effective after-tax) WACC, which represents the after-tax cost to the firm, declines with lever-
age as the interest tax shield grows. The figure assumes a marginal corporate income tax rate of 
tc = 35%.
Example 15.3
Valuing the Interest Tax Shield with a Target Debt-Equity Ratio
Problem
Western Lumber Company expects to have free cash flow in the coming year of $4.25 million, 
and its free cash flow is expected to grow at a rate of 4% per year thereafter. Western Lumber 
has an equity cost of capital of 10% and a debt cost of capital of 6%, and it pays a corporate tax 
rate of 35%. If Western Lumber maintains a debt-equity ratio of 0.50, what is the value of its 
interest tax shield?
Solution
We can estimate the value of Western Lumber’s interest tax shield by comparing its value with 
and without leverage. We compute its unlevered value by discounting its free cash flow at its 
pretax WACC:

15.3	 Recapitalizing to Capture the Tax Shield
When a firm makes a significant change to its capital structure, the transaction is called 
a recapitalization (or simply a “recap”). In Chapter 14, we introduced a leveraged recap-
italization in which a firm issues a large amount of debt and uses the proceeds to pay a 
special dividend or to repurchase shares. Leveraged recaps were especially popular in the 
mid- to late-1980s, when many firms found that these transactions could reduce their tax 
payments.
Let’s see how such a transaction might benefit current shareholders. Midco Industries 
has 20 million shares outstanding with a market price of $15 per share and no debt. Midco 
has had consistently stable earnings, and pays a 35% tax rate. Management plans to borrow 
$100 million on a permanent basis through a leveraged recap in which they would use the 
borrowed funds to repurchase outstanding shares. Their expectation is that the tax savings 
from this transaction will boost Midco’s stock price and benefit shareholders. Let’s see if 
this expectation is realistic.
The Tax Benefit
First, we examine the tax consequences of Midco’s leveraged recap. Without leverage, 
Midco’s total market value is the value of its unlevered equity. Assuming the current stock 
price is the fair price for the shares without leverage:
V U = (20 million shares) * ($15/share) = $300 million
Pretax WACC =

Because Western Lumber’s free cash flow is expected to grow at a constant rate, we can value it as 
a constant growth perpetuity:
V U =
4.25
8.67% - 4% = $91 million
To compute Western Lumber’s levered value, we calculate its WACC:
 WACC =

 6%(1 - 0.35) = 7.97%
Thus, Western Lumber’s value including the interest tax shield is
V L =
4.25
7.97% - 4% = $107 million
The value of the interest tax shield is therefore
PV ( Interest Tax Shield ) = V L - V U = 107 - 91 = $16 million

	
15.3  Recapitalizing to Capture the Tax Shield	
561
With leverage, Midco will reduce its annual tax payments. If Midco borrows $100 million 
using permanent debt, the present value of the firm’s future tax savings is
PV(Interest Tax Shield) = tcD = 35% * $100 million = $35 million
Thus, the total value of the levered firm will be
V L = V U + tcD = $300 million + $35 million = $335 million
This total value represents the combined value of the debt and the equity after the recapi-
talization. Because the value of the debt is $100 million, the value of the equity is
E = V L - D = $335 million - $100 million = $235 million
While total firm value has increased, the value of equity dropped after the recap. How do 
shareholders benefit from this transaction?
Even though the value of the shares outstanding drops to $235 million, don’t forget that 
shareholders will also receive the $100 million that Midco will pay out through the share 
repurchase. In total, they will receive the full $335 million, a gain of $35 million over the 
value of their shares without leverage. Let’s trace the details of the share repurchase and see 
how it leads to an increase in the stock price.
The Share Repurchase
Suppose Midco repurchases its shares at their current price of $15 per share. The firm will 
repurchase $100 million , $15 per share = 6.667 million shares, and it will then have 
20 - 6.667 = 13.333 million shares outstanding. Because the total value of equity is $235 
million, the new share price is
$235 million
13.333 million shares = $17.625
The shareholders who keep their shares earn a capital gain of $17.625 - $15 = $2.625 
per share, for a total gain of
$2.625/share * 13.333 million shares = $35 million
In this case, the shareholders who remain after the recap receive the benefit of the tax 
shield. However, you may have noticed something odd in the previous calculations. We 
assumed that Midco was able to repurchase the shares at the initial price of $15 per share, 
and then demonstrated that the shares would be worth $17.625 after the transaction. Why 
would a shareholder agree to sell the shares for $15 when they are worth $17.625?
No Arbitrage Pricing
The previous scenario represents an arbitrage opportunity. Investors could buy shares for 
$15 immediately before the repurchase, and they could sell these shares immediately after-
ward at a higher price. But this activity would raise the share price above $15 even before 
the repurchase: Once investors know the recap will occur, the share price will rise immedi-
ately to a level that reflects the $35 million value of the interest tax shield that the firm will 
receive. That is, the value of the Midco’s equity will rise immediately from $300 million to 
$335 million. With 20 million shares outstanding, the share price will rise to
$335 million , 20 million shares = $16.75 per share
Midco must offer at least this price to repurchase the shares.

562	
Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
With a repurchase price of $16.75, the shareholders who tender their shares and the share-
holders who hold their shares both gain $16.75 - $15 = $1.75 per share as a result of the 
transaction. The benefit of the interest tax shield goes to all 20 million of the original shares out-
standing for a total benefit of $1.75/share * 20 million shares = $35 million. In other words,
When securities are fairly priced, the original shareholders of a firm capture the full benefit 
of the interest tax shield from an increase in leverage.
Analyzing the Recap: The Market Value Balance Sheet
We can analyze the recapitalization using the market value balance sheet, a tool we devel-
oped in Chapter 14. It states that the total market value of a firm’s securities must equal 
the total market value of the firm’s assets. In the presence of corporate taxes, we must 
include the interest tax shield as one of the firm’s assets.
We analyze the leveraged recap by breaking this transaction into steps, as shown in 
Table 15.2. First, the recap is announced. At this point, investors anticipate the future 
interest tax shield, raising the value of Midco’s assets by $35 million. Next, Midco issues 
$100 million in new debt, increasing both Midco’s cash and liabilities by that amount. 
Finally, Midco uses the cash to repurchase shares at their market price of $16.75. In this 
step, Midco’s cash declines, as does the number of shares outstanding.
Example 15.4
Alternative Repurchase Prices
Problem
Suppose Midco announces a price at which it will repurchase $100 million worth of its shares. 
Show that $16.75 is the lowest price it could offer and expect shareholders to tender their shares. 
How will the benefits be divided if Midco offers more than $16.75 per share?
Solution
For each repurchase price, we can compute the number of shares Midco will repurchase, as well 
as the number of shares that will remain after the share repurchase. Dividing the $235 million 
total value of equity by the number of remaining shares gives Midco’s new share price after the 
transaction. No shareholders will be willing to sell their shares unless the repurchase price is at 
least as high as the share price after the transaction; otherwise, they would be better off waiting to 
sell their shares. As the table shows, the repurchase price must be at least $16.75 for shareholders 
to be willing to sell rather than waiting to receive a higher price.
If Midco offers a price above $16.75, then all existing shareholders will be eager to sell their shares, 
because the shares will have a lower value after the transaction is completed. In this case, Midco’s offer 
to repurchase shares will be oversubscribed and Midco will need to use a lottery or some other ration-
ing mechanism to choose from whom it will repurchase shares. In that case, more of the benefits of 
the recap will go to the shareholders who are lucky enough to be selected for the repurchase.

Note that the share price rises at the announcement of the recap. This increase in the 
share price is due solely to the present value of the (anticipated) interest tax shield. Thus, 
even though leverage reduces the total market capitalization of the firm’s equity, sharehold-
ers capture the benefits of the interest tax shield upfront.8
Concept Check	
1.	 How can shareholders benefit from a leveraged recap when it reduces the total value of equity?
	
2.	 How does the interest tax shield enter into the market value balance sheet?
	
15.4	 Personal Taxes
So far, we have looked at the benefits of leverage with regard to the taxes a corporation 
must pay. By reducing a firm’s corporate tax liability, debt allows the firm to pay more of 
its cash flows to investors.
Unfortunately for investors, after they receive the cash flows, they are generally taxed 
again. For individuals, interest payments received from debt are taxed as income. Equity 
investors also must pay taxes on dividends and capital gains. What are the consequences to 
firm value of these additional taxes?
Including Personal Taxes in the Interest Tax Shield
The value of a firm is equal to the amount of money the firm can raise by issuing securities. 
The amount of money an investor will pay for a security ultimately depends on the benefits 
the investor will receive—namely, the cash flows the investor will receive after all taxes have 
been paid. Thus, just like corporate taxes, personal taxes reduce the cash flows to investors 
and diminish firm value. As a result, the actual interest tax shield depends on the reduction 
in the total taxes (both corporate and personal) that are paid.9
8We are ignoring other potential side effects of leverage, such as costs of future financial distress. We dis-
cuss such costs in Chapter 16.
9This point was made most forcefully in yet another pathbreaking article by Merton Miller, “Debt and 
Taxes,” Journal of Finance 32 (1977): 261–275. See also M. Miller and M. Scholes, “Dividends and 
Taxes,” Journal of Financial Economics 6 (1978): 333–364.

Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
Personal taxes have the potential to offset some of the corporate tax benefits of lever-
age that we have described. In particular, in the United States and many other countries, 
interest income has historically been taxed more heavily than capital gains from equity. 
Table 15.3 shows recent top federal tax rates in the United States. The average rate on 
equity income listed in the table is an average of the top capital gains and dividend tax rates.
To determine the true tax benefit of leverage, we need to evaluate the combined effect 
of both corporate and personal taxes. Consider a firm with $1 of earnings before interest 
and taxes. The firm can either pay this $1 to debt holders as interest, or it can use the $1 
to pay equity holders directly, with a dividend, or indirectly, by retaining earnings so that 
shareholders receive a capital gain. Figure 15.3 shows the tax consequences of each option.
Using 2015 tax rates, debt offers a clear tax advantage with respect to corporate taxes: 
For every $1 in pretax cash flows that debt holders receive, equity holders receive tc = 35% 
less under current tax rates. But at the personal level, the highest income tax rate on interest 
income is ti = 39.6%, whereas the tax rate on equity income is only te = 20%. Combining 
corporate and personal rates leads to the following comparison:
While a tax advantage to debt remains, it is not as large as we calculated based on corporate 
taxes alone. To express the comparison in relative terms, note that equity holders receive
t* = 0.604 - 0.52
0.604
= 13.9%
less after taxes than debt holders. In this case, personal taxes reduce the tax advantage of 
debt from 35% to 13.9%.

We can interpret t* as the effective tax advantage of debt: if the corporation paid 
(1 - t*) in interest, debt holders would receive the same amount after taxes as equity hold-
ers would receive if the firm paid $1 in profits to equity holders. That is,
(1 - t*)(1 - ti ) = (1 - tc)(1 - te)
Solving this equation for t* gives
Effective Tax Advantage of Debt
	
t* = 1 - (1 - tc)(1 - te)
(1 - ti)

(15.7)
Said another way, every $1 received after taxes by debt holders from interest payments 
costs equity holders $(1 - t*) on an after-tax basis.
When there are no personal taxes, or when the personal tax rates on debt and equity 
income are the same (ti = te), this formula reduces to t* = tc. But when equity income is 
taxed less heavily (ti 7 te), then t* is less than tc.

*Interest income is taxed as ordinary income. Until 2003, dividends were also taxed as ordinary income. The average tax rate on equity income 
is an average of dividend and capital gain tax rates (consistent with a 50% dividend payout ratio and annual realization of ­capital gains), where 
the capital gain tax rate is the long-term rate applicable to assets held more than one year.
†The corporate rate shown is for C corporations with the highest level of income. Marginal rates can be higher for lower brackets. (For example, since 
2000, the 35% tax rate applies to income levels above $18.3 million, while the tax rate for income levels between $100,000 and $335,000 is 39%.)
Example 15.5
Calculating the Effective Tax Advantage of Debt
Problem
What was the effective tax advantage of debt in 1980? In 1990?
Solution
Using Eq. 15.7 and the tax rates in Table 15.3, we can calculate
 t*1980 = 1 - (1 - 0.46)(1 - 0.49)
(1 - 0.70)
= 8.2%  and   t*1990 = 1 - (1 - 0.34)(1 - 0.28)
(1 - 0.28)
= 34%
Given the tax rates at the time, the effective tax advantage of debt was much lower in 1980 than 
in 1990.

Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
Figure 15.4 shows the effective tax advantage of debt since 1971 in the United States. It 
has varied widely over time with changes in the tax code.
Valuing the Interest Tax Shield with Personal Taxes
How does the foregoing analysis of personal taxes affect our valuation of the debt tax 
shield? We postpone a detailed answer to this question until Chapter 18, and limit our 
discussion here to a few important observations. First, as long as t* 7 0, then despite any 
tax disadvantage of debt at the personal level, a net tax advantage for leverage remains. In 
the case of permanent debt, the value of the firm with leverage becomes
	
V L = V U + t*D
(15.8)
Because the personal tax disadvantage of debt generally implies t* 6 tc , comparing 
Eq. 15.8 with Eq. 15.4 we see that the benefit of leverage is reduced.
Personal taxes have a similar, but indirect, effect on the firm’s weighted average cost of 
capital. While we still compute the WACC using the corporate tax rate tc as in Eq. 15.5, 
with personal taxes the firm’s equity and debt costs of capital will adjust to compensate 
investors for their respective tax burdens. The net result is that a personal tax disadvantage 
for debt causes the WACC to decline more slowly with leverage than it otherwise would.
Example 15.6
Estimating the Interest Tax Shield with Personal Taxes
Problem
Estimate the value of Midco after its $100 million leveraged recap, accounting for personal taxes 
in 2015.
Solution
Given t* = 13.9% in 2015, and given Midco’s current value V U = $300 million, we estimate 
V L = V U + t*D = $300 million + 13.9%($100 million) = $313.9 million. With 20 million 
origi­nal shares outstanding, the stock price would increase by $13.9 million , 20 million shares 
= $0.695 share.

Determining the Actual Tax Advantage of Debt
In estimating the effective tax advantage of debt after taking personal taxes into account, 
we made several assumptions that may need adjustment when determining the actual tax 
benefit for a particular firm or investor.
First, with regard to the capital gains tax rate, we assumed that investors paid capital 
gains taxes every year. But unlike taxes on interest income or dividends, which are paid 
annually, capital gains taxes are paid only at the time the investor sells the stock and 
realizes the gain. Deferring the payment of capital gains taxes lowers the present value 
of the taxes, which can be interpreted as a lower effective capital gains tax rate. For 
example, given a capital gains tax rate of 20% and an interest rate of 6%, holding the 
asset for 10 more years lowers the effective tax rate this year to (20%)/1.0610 = 11.2%. 
Also, investors with accrued losses that they can use to offset gains face a zero effec-
tive capital gains tax rate. As a consequence, investors with longer holding periods or 
with accrued losses face a lower tax rate on equity income, decreasing the effective tax 
advantage of debt.
A second key assumption in our analysis is the computation of the tax rate on equity 
income te. Currently in the United States the dividend and capital gains tax rates are the 
same. But in other countries they can differ, and so computing the tax rate on equity 
income requires computing a weighted average of the two rates. In computing the 
weights, it is important that they reflect a firm’s actual payout policy. For example, for 
firms that do not pay dividends, the capital gains tax rate should be used as the tax rate 
on equity income.
Finally, we assumed the top marginal federal income tax rates for the investor. In reality, 
rates vary for individual investors, and many investors face lower rates. (We have also 
ignored state taxes, which vary widely by state and have an additional impact.) At lower 
rates, the effects of personal taxes are less substantial. Moreover, many investors face no per-
sonal taxes. Consider investments held in retirement savings accounts or pension funds that 
Cutting the Dividend Tax Rate
In January 2003, President George W. Bush unveiled a pro-
posal to boost the U.S. economy with a $674 billion tax cut 
plan, half of which would come from eliminating taxes on 
dividends. From the moment it was announced, this tax cut 
generated tremendous controversy.
Proponents argued that easing the tax bite on investors’ 
dividend income would boost the stock market and stimu-
late the sluggish economy. Critics quickly denounced it as 
a tax cut for the rich. But one of the underlying motives 
of the plan, authored in large part by economist R. Glenn 
Hubbard, was to end the current distortion in tax laws that 
encourage companies to accumulate debt because interest is 
deductible but dividend payments are not.
Levying taxes both on corporate earnings and on the 
dividends or capital gains paid to investors is known as 
double taxation. The lower rates on capital gains have pro-
vided some relief from double taxation. In 2002, how-
ever, dividends were still taxed at the same rate as ordinary 
income, leading to a combined tax rate in excess of 60% on 
dividends—one of the highest tax rates on dividends of any 
industrialized nation. As we have seen, this double taxation 
results in a tax advantage to debt financing.
Ultimately, policymakers agreed to a compromise that 
reduced the tax rate for individuals on both dividends (for 
stocks held for more than 60 days) and capital gains (for 
assets held for more than one year) to 15%. This compro-
mise still gives a tax advantage to debt, but at a decreased 
level from prior years (see Figure 15.4).
The “Bush tax cuts” (which also lowered income and 
capital gains tax rates) were originally set to expire at the 
end of 2010. Fearing their expiration would slow the 
nascent economic recovery, in December 2010 Congress 
extended the tax cuts through 2012. In 2013, the tax cuts 
were made permanent in a compromise that raised the top 
tax rates to 39.6% on income and 20% on dividends and 
capital gains.

are not subject to taxes.10 For these investors, the effective tax advantage of debt is t* = tc, 
the full corporate tax rate. This full tax advantage would also apply to securities dealers for 
whom interest, dividends, and capital gains are all taxed equivalently as income.
What is the bottom line? Calculating the effective tax advantage of debt accurately is 
extremely difficult, and this advantage will vary across firms (and from investor to investor). A 
firm must consider the tax bracket of its typical debt holders to estimate ti, and the tax bracket 
and holding period of its typical equity holders to determine te. If, for instance, a firm’s inves-
tors hold shares primarily through their retirement accounts, t*  tc. While t* is likely to be 
somewhat below tc for the typical firm, exactly how much lower is open to debate. Our calcu-
lation of t* in Figure 15.4 should be interpreted as a very rough guide at best.11

15.5	 Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes
In Modigliani and Miller’s setting of perfect capital markets, firms could use any com-
bination of debt and equity to finance their investments without changing the value of 
the firm. In effect, any capital structure was optimal. In this chapter we have seen that 
taxes change that conclusion because interest payments create a valuable tax shield. Even 
after adjusting for personal taxes, the value of a firm with leverage exceeds the value of an 
­unlevered firm, and there is a tax advantage to using debt financing.
Do Firms Prefer Debt?
Do firms show a preference for debt in practice? Figure 15.5 illustrates the net new 
issues of equity and debt by U.S. corporations. For equity, the figure shows the total 
10Evidence from the mid-1990s suggests that the growth in pension funds has lowered the average mar-
ginal tax rate for investors to about half the rates shown in Table 15.3. See J. Poterba, “The Rate of Return 
to Corporate Capital and Factor Shares: New Estimates Using Revised National Income Accounts and 
Capital Stock Data,” NBER working paper no. 6263 (1997).
11For a discussion of methods of estimating t* and the need to include personal taxes, see J. Graham, “Do 
Personal Taxes Affect Corporate Financing Decisions?” Journal of Public Economics 73 (1999): 147–185.

amount of new equity issued, less the amount retired through share repurchases and 
acquisitions. For debt, it shows the total amount of new borrowing less the amount of 
loans repaid.
Figure  15.5 makes clear that when firms raise new capital from investors, they do 
so primarily by issuing debt. In fact, in most years, aggregate equity issues are negative, 
meaning that firms are reducing the amount of equity outstanding by buying shares. 
(This observation does not mean that all firms raised funds using debt. Many firms may 
have sold equity to raise funds. However, at the same time, other firms were buying or 
repurchasing an equal or greater amount.) The data show a clear preference for debt as a 
source of external financing for the total population of U.S. firms. Indeed, in aggregate, 
firms appear to be borrowing in excess of the funds they need for internal use in order to 
repurchase equity.
While firms seem to prefer debt when raising external funds, not all investment is exter-
nally funded. As Figure 15.5 also shows, capital expenditures greatly exceed firms’ external 
financing, implying that most investment and growth is supported by internally gener-
ated funds, such as retained earnings. Thus, even though firms have not issued new equity, 
the market value of equity has risen over time as firms have grown. In fact, as shown in 
­Figure 15.6, debt as a fraction of firm value has varied in a range from 30–50% for the 
average firm. The average debt-to-value ratio fell during the 1990s bull market, with the 
trend reversing post-2000 due to declines in the stock market as well as a dramatic increase 
in debt issuance in response to falling interest rates.
The aggregate data in Figure 15.6 masks two important tendencies. First, the use of 
leverage varies greatly by industry. Second, many firms retain large cash balances to reduce 
their effective leverage. These patterns are revealed in Figure 15.7, which shows both total 
and net debt as a fraction of firm enterprise value for a number of industries and the overall 
market. Note that net debt is negative if a firm’s cash holdings exceed its outstanding debt. 
Clearly, there are large differences in net leverage across industries. Firms in growth indus-
tries like biotechnology or high technology carry very little debt and maintain large cash 
reserves, whereas wireless telecomms, real estate firms, trucking and automotive firms, and 
utilities have high leverage ratios. Thus, the differences in the leverage ratios of Amgen and 
­Navistar International noted in the introduction to this chapter are not unique to these 
firms, but rather are typical of their respective industries.

These data raise important questions. If debt provides a tax advantage that lowers a 
firm’s weighted average cost of capital and increases firm value, why does debt make up less 
than half of the capital structure of most firms? And why does the leverage choice vary so 
much across industries, with some firms having no net leverage? To begin to answer these 
questions, let’s consider a bit more carefully what the optimal capital structure is from a tax 
perspective.

have no debt but hold a great deal

debt. Oil & Gas Drilling firms have 
much less cash and over 75% total 
debt.  While the median level of 
debt for all U.S. stocks was about 
23% of firm value, note the large 
­differences by industry.

Limits to the Tax Benefit of Debt
To receive the full tax benefits of leverage, a firm need not use 100% debt financing. A 
firm receives a tax benefit only if it is paying taxes in the first place. That is, the firm must 
have taxable earnings. This constraint may limit the amount of debt needed as a tax shield.
To determine the optimal level of leverage, compare the three leverage choices shown in 
Table 15.4 for a firm with earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) equal to $1000 and a 
corporate tax rate of tc = 35%. With no leverage, the firm owes tax of $350 on the full 
$1000 of EBIT. If the firm has high leverage with interest payments equal to $1000, then it 
can shield its earnings from taxes, thereby saving the $350 in taxes. Now consider a third 
case, in which the firm has excess leverage so that interest payments exceed EBIT. In this 
case, the firm has a net operating loss, but there is no increase in the tax savings. Because the 
firm is paying no taxes already, there is no immediate tax shield from the excess leverage.12
Thus, no corporate tax benefit arises from incurring interest payments that regularly 
exceed EBIT. And, because interest payments constitute a tax disadvantage at the investor 
level as discussed in Section 15.4, investors will pay higher personal taxes with excess lever-
age, making them worse off.13 We can quantify the tax disadvantage for excess interest 
payments by setting tc = 0 (assuming there is no reduction in the corporate tax for excess 
interest payments) in Eq. 15.7 for t*:
	
t*ex = 1 - (1 - te)
(1 - ti ) = te - ti
(1 - ti ) 6 0
(15.9)
Note that t*ex is negative because equity is taxed less heavily than interest for investors 
(te 7 ti). At 2012 tax rates, this disadvantage is
t*ex = 15% - 35%
(1 - 35%) = -30.8%
12If the firm paid taxes during the prior two years, it could “carry back” the current year’s net operating 
loss to apply for a refund of some of those taxes. Alternatively, the firm could “carry forward” the net oper-
ating loss up to 20 years to shield future income from taxes (although waiting to receive the credit reduces 
its present value). Thus, there can be a tax benefit from interest in excess of EBIT if it does not occur on a 
regular basis. For simplicity, we ignore carrybacks and carryforwards in this discussion.
13Of course, another problem can arise from having excess leverage: The firm may not be able to afford 
the excess interest and could be forced to default on the loan. We discuss financial distress (and its poten-
tial costs) in Chapter 16.

Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
Andrew Balson was a Managing ­Director of 
Bain Capital, a leading private investment firm 
with nearly $57 billion in assets under manage-
ment. Bain Capital specializes in private equity 
(PE) and leveraged buyout (LBO) transactions, 
in which a firm is purchased and recapitalized 
with debt-to-value ratios often exceeding 70%. 
Bain Capital has invested in many well-known 
companies including Burger King, Domino’s 
Pizza, Dunkin’ Brands, HCA, Michael’s Stores, 
Sealy Mattress Company, and Toys ’R Us.
QUESTION: What is the role of private 
investment firms such as Bain Capital, 
and what types of firms make the best 
LBO candidates?
ANSWER: Our business serves as an alter-
nate capital market for companies that 
don’t really belong as public companies, 
either during a transition period or per-
manently, and don’t have a logical fit within another larger 
corporation. In that context, we’ve done buyouts for companies 
across many different industries and types. There really isn’t 
one particular type that is best. We look for companies that are 
well positioned in their industries, have advantages relative to 
their competitors, and provide real value to their customers. 
Some may be underperforming but change can enable them 
to turn around. Others may be performing well but could do 
even better. Perhaps the management team has not been given 
appropriate incentives, or the company has not been optimized 
or managed aggressively enough. Occasionally, we find a com-
pany we can buy at a low price compared to its inherent value. 
That was a big part of our business 10 years ago but is less so 
today. We pay relatively full valuations compared to the com-
pany’s current earnings. This approach works because of our 
ability to improve current earnings or cash flow.
QUESTION: How does leverage affect risk and return for 
investors?
ANSWER: Based on my experience, if we’ve found interest-
ing companies where we can change the profit trajectory, 
leverage will ultimately serve to magnify both the impact of 
the investments we make and the returns for our investors. 
Over the past 20 years, the Bain Capital portfolio has far 
outperformed any equity benchmarks. That performance 
comes from improved operating profits that are magnified 
by leverage. Growth is an important driver of our success, 
so we strive to create efficient capital 
structures that complement our strat-
egy and enable us to invest in business 
opportunities. The line between too 
much and not enough is not distinct, 
however. We try to use as much debt as 
we can without changing how our man-
agement teams run our businesses.
QUESTION: How will the 2008 financial 
crisis affect capital structure and financing 
policies in the future?
ANSWER: From 2006 to 2008, debt 
became more available, and the amount 
of leverage per $1 of earnings went up 
dramatically. Companies that typically 
borrowed four to six times earnings 
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and 
amortization (EBITDA) were now bor-
rowing seven to eight times EBITDA. 
The cost of borrowing went down, spreads tightened, 
and borrowing terms became more lenient, resulting in 
“covenant-lite” loans. The market opened its wallet and 
threw money at PE firms, ultimately driving returns down.
The PE markets began to crack in late spring 2008. 
Banks had to shore up their balance sheets, leaving no 
money for buyouts. The PE markets are now reverting to 
pre-2006 leverage—five times EBITDA—rates, and terms.
QUESTION: What challenges and opportunities does the 
financial crisis present for PE firms?
ANSWER: The fundamental benefits of PE for many compa-
nies will persist. PE remains an attractive asset class—at the 
right leverage and price. The economic uncertainty creates 
less incentive for sellers of companies, who are more likely 
to wait out these difficult capital markets. It’s a great time to 
be a PE investor with capital, however. We were able to take 
substantial minority stakes in companies that interest us, at 
attractive terms. PE financing is now more expensive, and 
I think it will remain that way for some time. Companies 
that need financing now, to grow or make a strategic move, 
will tap higher-cost capital sources such as PE.
It’s also a challenging time for our portfolio companies. 
Sales in most companies have declined precipitously. We 
are working with our companies to cut costs and generate 
liquidity to get them “across the icy river”; and we expect 
the vast majority to make it.
Interview With
Andrew Balson

	
15.5  Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes	
573
Therefore, the optimal level of leverage from a tax saving perspective is the level such that 
interest equals EBIT. The firm shields all of its taxable income, and it does not have any 
tax-­disadvantaged excess interest. Figure 15.8 shows the tax savings at different levels of 
interest payments when EBIT equals $1000 with certainty. In this case, an interest pay-
ment of $1000 maximizes the tax savings.
Of course, it is unlikely that a firm can predict its future EBIT precisely. If there is 
uncertainty regarding EBIT, then with a higher interest expense there is a greater risk that 
interest will exceed EBIT. As a result, the tax savings for high levels of interest falls, possibly 
reducing the optimal level of the interest payment, as shown in Figure 15.8.14 In general, as 
a firm’s interest expense approaches its expected taxable earnings, the marginal tax advan-
tage of debt declines, limiting the amount of debt the firm should use.
Growth and Debt
In a tax-optimal capital structure, the level of interest payments depends on the level of EBIT. 
What does this conclusion tell us about the optimal fraction of debt in a firm’s capital structure?
If we examine young technology or biotechnology firms, we often find that these firms 
do not have any taxable income. Their value comes mainly from the prospect that they 
will produce high future profits. A biotech firm might be developing drugs with tremen-
dous potential, but it has yet to receive any revenue from these drugs. Such a firm will not 
have taxable earnings. In that case, a tax-optimal capital structure does not include debt. 
We would expect such a firm to finance its investments with equity alone. Only later, when 
the firm matures and becomes profitable, will it have taxable cash flows. At that time it 
should add debt to its capital structure.
Even for a firm with positive earnings, growth will affect the optimal leverage ratio. To 
avoid excess interest, this type of firm should have debt with interest payments that are 
below its expected taxable earnings:
Interest = rD * Debt … EBIT or Debt … EBIT/rD
14Details of how to compute the optimal level of debt when earnings are risky can be found in a paper by 
J. Graham, “How Big Are the Tax Benefits of Debt?” Journal of Finance 55(5) (2000): 1901–1941.

Interest
When EBIT is known with 
certainty, the tax savings 
is maximized if the interest 
expense is equal to EBIT. 
When EBIT is uncertain, the 
tax savings declines for high 
levels of interest because 
of the risk that the interest 
payment will be in excess 
of EBIT.

That is, from a tax perspective, the firm’s optimal level of debt is proportional to its cur-
rent earnings. However, the value of the firm’s equity will depend on the growth rate of 
earnings: The higher the growth rate, the higher the value of equity is (and equivalently, 
the higher the firm’s price-earnings multiple is). As a result, the optimal proportion of debt 
in the firm’s capital structure [D/(E + D)] will be lower, the higher the firm’s growth rate.15
Other Tax Shields
Up to this point, we have assumed that interest is the only means by which firms can shield 
earnings from corporate taxes. But there are numerous other provisions in the tax laws for 
deductions and tax credits, such as depreciation, investment tax credits, carryforwards of 
past operating losses, and the like. For example, many high-tech firms pay little or no taxes 
because of tax deductions related to employee stock options (see box on page 576). To the 
extent that a firm has other tax shields, its taxable earnings will be reduced and it will rely 
less heavily on the interest tax shield.16
The Low Leverage Puzzle
Do firms choose capital structures that fully exploit the tax advantages of debt? The results 
of this section imply that to evaluate this question, we should compare the level of firms’ 
interest payments to their taxable income, rather than simply consider the fraction of debt 
in their capital structures. Figure 15.9 compares interest expenses and EBIT for firms in 
the S&P 500. It reveals two important patterns. First, firms have used debt to shield less 
than one third of their income from taxes on average, and only about 50% in downturns 
15This explanation for the low leverage of high growth firms is developed in a paper by J. Berens and 
C. Cuny, “The Capital Structure Puzzle Revisited,” Review of Financial Studies 8 (1995): 1185–1208.
16See H. DeAngelo and R. Masulis, “Optimal Capital Structure Under Corporate and Personal Taxation,” 
Journal of Financial Economics 8 (1980): 3–27. For a discussion of methods to estimate a firm’s marginal 
tax rate to account for these effects, see J. Graham, “Proxies for the Corporate Marginal Tax Rate,” Journal 
of Financial Economics 42 (1996): 187–221.

(when earnings tend to fall). Second, only about 10% of the time do firms have negative 
taxable income, and thus would not benefit from an increased interest tax shield. Overall, 
firms have far less leverage than our analysis of the interest tax shield would predict.17
This low level of leverage is not unique to U.S. firms. Table 15.5 shows international 
leverage levels from a 1995 study by Professors Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales using 
1990 data. Note that firms worldwide have similar low proportions of debt financing, with 
firms in the United Kingdom exhibiting especially low leverage. Also, with the exception of 
Italy and Canada, firms shield less than half of their taxable income using interest payments. 
The corporate tax codes are similar across all countries in terms of the tax advantage of debt. 
Personal tax rates vary more significantly, however, leading to greater variation in t*.18
Why are firms under-leveraged? Either firms are content to pay more taxes than neces-
sary rather than maximize shareholder value, or there is more to the capital structure story 
than we have uncovered so far. While some firms may deliberately choose a suboptimal 
capital structure, it is hard to accept that most firms are acting suboptimally. The consen-
sus of so many managers in choosing low levels of leverage suggests that debt financing has 
other costs that prevent firms from using the interest tax shield fully.
Talk to financial managers and they will quickly point out a key cost of debt ­missing 
from our analysis: Increasing the level of debt increases the probability of bankruptcy. 
Aside from taxes, another important difference between debt and equity financing is that 
debt payments must be made to avoid bankruptcy, whereas firms have no similar obliga-
tion to pay dividends or realize capital gains. If bankruptcy is costly, these costs might off-
set the tax advantages of debt financing. We explore the role of financial bankruptcy costs 
and other market imperfections in Chapter 16.
17Additional evidence is provided by J. Graham in “How Big Are the Tax Benefits of Debt?” Journal of 
Finance 55 (2000): 1901–1941, where he estimates that the typical firm exploits less than half of the 
potential tax benefits of debt.

Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
Concept Check	
1.	 How does the growth rate of a firm affect the optimal fraction of debt in the capital structure?
	
2.	 Do firms choose capital structures that fully exploit the tax advantages of debt?
15.1  The Interest Tax Deduction
	
n	 Because interest expense is tax deductible, leverage increases the total amount of income avail-
able to all investors.
	
n	 The gain to investors from the tax deductibility of interest payments is called the interest tax 
shield.
	
Interest Tax Shield = Corporate Tax Rate * Interest Payments
(15.1)
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
15.2  Valuing the Interest Tax Shield
	
n	 When we consider corporate taxes, the total value of a levered firm equals the value of an unle-
vered firm plus the present value of the interest tax shield.
	
V L = V U + PV(Interest Tax Shield)
(15.2)
Employee Stock Options
Employee stock options can serve as an important tax shield 
for some firms. The typical employee stock option allows 
employees of a firm to buy the firm’s stock at a discounted 
price (often, the price of the stock when they started employ-
ment). When an employee exercises a stock option, the firm 
is essentially selling shares to the employee at a discount. If 
the discount is large, the employee can exercise the option 
and earn a large profit.
The amount of the discount is a cost for the firm’s equity 
holders because selling shares at a price below their market 
value dilutes the value of the firm’s shares. To reflect this 
cost, the IRS allows firms to deduct the amount of the dis-
count from their earnings for tax purposes. (The IRS taxes 
employees on the gain, so the tax burden does not go away, 
but moves from the firm to the employees.) Unlike the 
interest tax shield, the tax deduction from employee stock 
options does not add to the value of the firm. If the same 
amounts were paid to employees through salary rather than 
options, the firm would be able to deduct the extra salary 
from its taxable income as well. Until recently, however, 
employee stock options did not affect EBIT, so that EBIT 
overstated the taxable income of firms with option expenses.
During the stock market boom of the late 1990s, many 
technology firms and other firms that issued a large number 
of employee stock options were able to claim these deductions 
and lower their taxes relative to what one would naively have 
imputed from EBIT. In 2000, some of the most profitable 
companies in the United States (based on net income), such 
as Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Dell, and Qualcomm, had no 
taxable income—using the stock option deduction, they were 
able to report a loss for tax purposes.* A study by Professors 
J. ­Graham, M. Lang, and D. Shackelford reported that in 2000, 
stock option deductions for the entire NASDAQ 100 exceeded 
aggregate pretax earnings.† For these firms, there would have 
been no tax advantage associated with debt—which may help 
explain why they used little to no debt financing.
Since 2006, firms have been required to expense 
employee stock options. However, the rules for expensing 
the options are not the same as the tax deduction. As a con-
sequence, even after this rule change, stock options may 
continue to result in a significant difference between firms’ 
accounting income and their income for tax purposes. For 
example, Mark Zuckerberg’s founding options in Facebook 
led to an accounting expense of under $10 million, yet pro-
vided Facebook with a tax deduction exceeding $2 billion.

rate Taxes,” Tax Notes (March 18, 2002): 1396–1401.

of Finance 59 (2004): 1585–1618.

n	 When a firm’s marginal tax rate is constant, and there are no personal taxes, the present 
value of the interest tax shield from permanent debt equals the tax rate times the value of 
the debt, tc D.
	
n	 The firm’s pretax WACC measures the required return to the firm’s investors. Its effective after-
tax WACC, or simply the WACC, measures the cost to the firm after including the benefit of 
the interest tax shield. The two notions are related as follows:
	
rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +

E + D
 rD(1 - tc )

=

E + D
 rE +

 rD -


(15.6)
	
	 Absent other market imperfections, the WACC declines with a firm’s leverage.
	
n	 When the firm maintains a target leverage ratio, we compute its levered value V L as the present 
value of its free cash flows using the WACC, whereas its unlevered value V U is the present value 
of its free cash flows using its unlevered cost of capital or pretax WACC.
15.3  Recapitalizing to Capture the Tax Shield
	
n	 When securities are fairly priced, the original shareholders of a firm capture the full benefit of 
the interest tax shield from an increase in leverage.
15.4  Personal Taxes
	
n	 Personal taxes offset some of the corporate tax benefits of leverage. Every $1 received after taxes by 
debt holders from interest payments costs equity holders $(1 - t*) on an after-tax basis, where
	
t* = 1 - (1 - tc)(1 - te)
(1 - ti)

(15.7)
15.5  Optimal Capital Structure with Taxes
	
n	 The optimal level of leverage from a tax-saving perspective is the level such that interest equals 
EBIT. In this case, the firm takes full advantage of the corporate tax deduction of interest, but 
avoids the tax disadvantage of excess leverage at the personal level.
	
n	 The optimal fraction of debt, as a proportion of a firm’s capital structure, declines with the 
growth rate of the firm.
	
n	 The interest expense of the average firm is well below its taxable income, implying that firms do 
not fully exploit the tax advantages of debt.

Chapter 15  Debt and Taxes
Data Case
Your boss was impressed with your presentation regarding the irrelevance of capital structure from 
Chapter 14 but, as expected, has realized that market imperfections like taxes must be accounted for. 
You have now been asked to include taxes in your analysis. Your boss knows that interest is deduct-
ible and has decided that the stock price of Home Depot should increase if the firm increases its use 
of debt. Thus, your boss wants to propose a share repurchase program using the proceeds from a new 
debt issue and wants to present this plan to the CEO and perhaps to the Board of Directors.
Your boss would like you to examine the impact of two different scenarios, adding a modest level 
of debt and adding a higher level of debt. In particular, your boss would like to consider issuing $1 
billion in new debt or $5 billion in new debt. In either case, Home Depot would use the proceeds 
to repurchase stock.
	
1.	 Using the financial statements for Home Depot that you downloaded in Chapter 14, determine 
the average corporate tax rate for Home Depot over the last four years by dividing Income Tax by 
Earnings before Tax for each of the last four years.
	
2.	 Begin by analyzing the scenario with $1 billion in new debt. Assuming the firm plans to keep 
this new debt outstanding forever, determine the present value of the tax shield of the new debt. 
What additional assumptions did you need to make for this calculation?
	
3.	 Determine the new stock price if the $1 billion in debt is used to repurchase stock.
a.	 Use the current market value of Home Depot’s equity that you calculated in Chapter 14.
b.	 Determine the new market value of the equity if the repurchase occurs.
c.	 Determine the new number of shares and the stock price after the repurchase is announced.
	
4.	 What will Home Depot’s D/E ratio based on book values be after it issues new debt and repur-
chases stock? What will its market value D/E ratio be?
	
5.	 Repeat Steps 2–4 for the scenario in which Home Depot issues $5 billion in debt and repurchases 
stock.
	
6.	 Based on the stock price, do the debt increase and stock repurchase appear to be a good idea? 
Why or why not? What issues might the executives of Home Depot raise that aren’t considered in 
your analysis?
	
Note: Updates to this data case may be found at www.berkdemarzo.com.
	
*27.	 PMF, Inc. is equally likely to have EBIT this coming year of $7 million, $13 million, or $19 mil-
lion. Its corporate tax rate is 35%, and investors pay a 15% tax rate on income from equity and a 
40% tax rate on interest income.
a.	 What is the effective tax advantage of debt if PMF has interest expenses of $6 million this 
coming year?
b.	 What is the effective tax advantage of debt for interest expenses in excess of $19 million? 
(Ignore carryforwards.)
c.	 What is the effective tax advantage of debt for interest expenses between $7 million and 
$13 million? (Ignore carryforwards.)
d.	What level of interest expense provides PMF with the greatest tax benefit?

does not matter in a perfect capital market. In ­Chapter 15, we found a tax benefit of 
leverage, at least up to the point that a firm’s EBIT exceeds the interest payments on 
the debt. Yet we saw that the average U.S. firm shields less than half of its earnings in 
this way. Why don’t firms use more debt?
We can gain some insight by looking at United Airlines (UAL Corporation). For the 
five-year period 1996 through 2000, UAL paid interest expenses of $1.7 billion, rela-
tive to EBIT of more than $6 billion. During this period, it reported a total provision for 
taxes on its income statement exceeding $2.2 billion. The company appeared to have a 
level of debt that did not fully exploit its tax shield. Even so, as a result of high fuel and 
labor costs, a decline in travel following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 
and increased competition from discount carriers, UAL filed for bankruptcy court pro-
tection in December 2002. United ultimately emerged from bankruptcy in 2006; after 
a profitable 2007, it suffered losses and renewed creditor concerns in the wake of the 
financial crisis in 2008. The airline returned to profitability in 2010 when it announced 
plans to acquire Continental Airlines. A similar fate soon befell American Airlines, whose 
parent company declared bankruptcy in 2011 with over $29 billion in debt, emerging 
from bankruptcy 2 years later as part of a merger with US Airways. As these examples 
illustrate, firms such as airlines whose future cash flows are unstable and highly sensi-
tive to shocks in the economy run the risk of bankruptcy if they use too much leverage.
When a firm has trouble meeting its debt obligations we say the firm is in financial 
distress. In this chapter, we consider how a firm’s choice of capital structure can, due to mar-
ket imperfections, affect its costs of financial distress, alter managers’ incentives, and sig-
nal information to ­investors. Each of these consequences of the capital structure decision

can be significant, and each may offset the tax benefits of leverage when leverage is high. Thus, these 
imperfections may help to explain the levels of debt that we generally observe. In addition, because 
their effects are likely to vary widely across different types of firms, they may help to explain the large 
discrepancies in leverage choices that exist across industries, as documented in Figure 15.7 in the 
previous chapter.
	
16.1	 Default and Bankruptcy in a Perfect Market
Debt financing puts an obligation on a firm. A firm that fails to make the required inter-
est or principal payments on the debt is in default. After the firm defaults, debt holders 
are given certain rights to the assets of the firm. In the extreme case, the debt holders take 
legal ownership of the firm’s assets through a process called bankruptcy. Recall that equity 
financing does not carry this risk. While equity holders hope to receive dividends, the firm 
is not legally obligated to pay them.
Thus, it seems that an important consequence of leverage is the risk of bankruptcy. Does this 
risk represent a disadvantage to using debt? Not necessarily. As we pointed out in ­Chapter 14, 
Modigliani and Miller’s results continue to hold in a perfect market even when debt is risky 
and the firm may default. Let’s review that result by considering a hypothetical example.
Armin Industries: Leverage and the Risk of Default
Armin Industries faces an uncertain future in a challenging business environment. Due to 
increased competition from foreign imports, its revenues have fallen dramatically in the 
past year. Armin’s managers hope that a new product in the company’s pipeline will restore 
its fortunes. While the new product represents a significant advance over Armin’s competi-
tors’ products, whether that product will be a hit with consumers remains uncertain. If it is 
a hit, revenues and profits will grow, and Armin will be worth $150 million at the end of 
the year. If it fails, Armin will be worth only $80 million.
Armin Industries may employ one of two alternative capital structures: (1) It can use 
all-equity financing or (2) it can use debt that matures at the end of the year with a total 
of $100 million due. Let’s look at the consequences of these capital structure choices when 
the new product succeeds, and when it fails, in a setting of perfect capital markets.
Scenario 1: New Product Succeeds.  If the new product is successful, Armin is worth 
$150 million. Without leverage, equity holders own the full amount. With leverage, 
Armin must make the $100 million debt payment, and Armin’s equity holders will own 
the remaining $50 million.
But what if Armin does not have $100 million in cash available at the end of the year? 
Although its assets will be worth $150 million, much of that value may come from antici-
pated future profits from the new product, rather than cash in the bank. In that case, if 
Armin has debt, will it be forced to default?
With perfect capital markets, the answer is no. As long as the value of the firm’s assets 
exceeds its liabilities, Armin will be able to repay the loan. Even if it does not have the cash 
immediately available, it can raise the cash by obtaining a new loan or by issuing new shares.
For example, suppose Armin currently has 10 million shares outstanding. Because the 
value of its equity is $50 million, these shares are worth $5 per share. At this price, Armin 
can raise $100 million by issuing 20 million new shares and use the proceeds to pay off the 
debt. After the debt is repaid, the firm’s equity is worth $150 million. Because there is now 
a total of 30 million shares, the share price remains $5 per share.

	
16.1  Default and Bankruptcy in a Perfect Market	
585
This scenario shows that if a firm has access to capital markets and can issue new securities at 
a fair price, then it need not default as long as the market value of its assets exceeds its liabilities. That 
is, whether default occurs depends on the relative values of the firm’s assets and liabilities, not on 
its cash flows. Many firms experience years of negative cash flows yet remain solvent.
Scenario 2: New Product Fails.  If the new product fails, Armin is worth only $80 million. 
If the company has all-equity financing, equity holders will be unhappy but there is no 
immediate legal consequence for the firm. In contrast, if Armin has $100 million in debt 
due, it will experience financial distress. The firm will be unable to make its $100 million 
debt payment and will have no choice except to default. In bankruptcy, debt holders will 
receive legal ownership of the firm’s assets, leaving Armin’s shareholders with nothing. 
Because the assets the debt holders receive have a value of $80 million, they will suffer a 
loss of $20 million relative to the $100 million they were owed. Equity holders in a corpo-
ration have limited liability, so the debt holders cannot sue Armin’s shareholders for this 
$20 million—they must accept the loss.
Comparing the Two Scenarios.  Table 16.1 compares the outcome of each scenario with-
out leverage and with leverage. Both debt and equity holders are worse off if the product 
fails rather than succeeds. Without leverage, if the product fails equity holders lose 
$150 million - $80 million = $70 million. With leverage, equity holders lose $50 mil-
lion, and debt holders lose $20 million, but the total loss is the same—$70 million. Overall, 
if the new product fails, Armin’s investors are equally unhappy whether the firm is levered and 
declares bankruptcy or whether it is unlevered and the share price declines.1
1There is a temptation to look only at shareholders and to say they are worse off when Armin has leverage 
because their shares are worthless. In fact, shareholders lose $50 million relative to success when the firm 
is levered, versus $70 million without leverage. What really matters is the total value to all investors, which 
will determine the total amount of capital the firm can raise initially.

Value of Debt and Equity with and without Leverage 
(in $ million)
This point is important. When a firm declares bankruptcy, the news often makes 
headlines. Much attention is paid to the firm’s poor results and the loss to investors. But 
the decline in value is not caused by bankruptcy: The decline is the same whether or not 
the firm has leverage. That is, if the new product fails, Armin will experience economic 
­distress, which is a significant decline in the value of a firm’s assets, whether or not it expe-
riences financial distress due to leverage.
Bankruptcy and Capital Structure
With perfect capital markets, Modigliani-Miller (MM) Proposition I applies: The total 
value to all investors does not depend on the firm’s capital structure. Investors as a group 
are not worse off because a firm has leverage. While it is true that bankruptcy results from 

586	
Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
a firm having leverage, bankruptcy alone does not lead to a greater reduction in the total 
value to investors. Thus, there is no disadvantage to debt financing, and a firm will have 
the same total value and will be able to raise the same amount initially from investors with 
either choice of capital structure.
Example 16.1
Bankruptcy Risk and Firm Value
Problem
Suppose the risk-free rate is 5%, and Armin’s new product is equally likely to succeed or to fail. 
For simplicity, suppose that Armin’s cash flows are unrelated to the state of the economy (i.e., the 
risk is diversifiable), so that the project has a beta of 0 and the cost of capital is the risk-free rate. 
Compute the value of Armin’s securities at the beginning of the year with and without leverage, 
and show that MM Proposition I holds.
Solution
Without leverage, the equity is worth either $150 million or $80 million at year-end. Because 
the risk is diversifiable, no risk premium is necessary and we can discount the expected value of 
the firm at the risk-free rate to determine its value without leverage at the start of the year:2
Equity (unlevered) = V U =
1
2 (150) + 1
2 (80)
1.05
= $109.52 million
With leverage, equity holders receive $50 million or nothing, and debt holders receive $100 
million or $80 million. Thus,
Equity (levered) =
1
2 (50) + 1
2 (0)
1.05
= $23.81 million
Debt =
1
2 (100) + 1
2 (80)
1.05
= $85.71 million
Therefore, the value of the levered firm is V L = E + D = 23.81 + 85.71 = $109.52 million. 
With or without leverage, the total value of the securities is the same, verifying MM Proposition I.  
The firm is able to raise the same amount from investors using either capital structure.
2If the risk were not diversifiable and a risk premium were needed, the calculations here would become 
more complicated but the conclusion would not change.
Concept Check	
1.	 With perfect capital markets, does the possibility of bankruptcy put debt financing at a 
disadvantage?
	
2.	 Does the risk of default reduce the value of the firm?
	
16.2	 The Costs of Bankruptcy and Financial Distress
With perfect capital markets, the risk of bankruptcy is not a disadvantage of debt—­
bankruptcy simply shifts the ownership of the firm from equity holders to debt holders 
without changing the total value available to all investors.
Is this description of bankruptcy realistic? No. Bankruptcy is rarely simple and straight-
forward—equity holders don’t just “hand the keys” to debt holders the moment the firm 
defaults on a debt payment. Rather, bankruptcy is a long and complicated process that 
imposes both direct and indirect costs on the firm and its investors, costs that the assump-
tion of perfect capital markets ignores.

	
16.2  The Costs of Bankruptcy and Financial Distress	
587
The Bankruptcy Code
When a firm fails to make a required payment to debt holders, it is in default. Debt holders 
can then take legal action against the firm to collect payment by seizing the firm’s assets. 
Because most firms have multiple creditors, without coordination it is difficult to guaran-
tee that each creditor will be treated fairly. Moreover, because the assets of the firm might 
be more valuable if kept together, creditors seizing assets in a piecemeal fashion might 
destroy much of the remaining value of the firm.
The U.S. bankruptcy code was created to organize this process so that creditors are 
treated fairly and the value of the assets is not needlessly destroyed. According to the provi-
sions of the 1978 Bankruptcy Reform Act, U.S. firms can file for two forms of bankruptcy 
protection: Chapter 7 or Chapter 11.
In Chapter 7 liquidation, a trustee is appointed to oversee the liquidation of the firm’s 
assets through an auction. The proceeds from the liquidation are used to pay the firm’s 
creditors, and the firm ceases to exist.
In the more common form of bankruptcy for large corporations, Chapter 11 reorgani-
zation, all pending collection attempts are automatically suspended, and the firm’s existing 
management is given the opportunity to propose a reorganization plan. While developing 
the plan, management continues to operate the business. The reorganization plan speci-
fies the treatment of each creditor of the firm. In addition to cash payment, creditors may 
receive new debt or equity securities of the firm. The value of cash and securities is gener-
ally less than the amount each creditor is owed, but more than the creditors would receive 
if the firm were shut down immediately and liquidated. The creditors must vote to accept 
the plan, and it must be approved by the bankruptcy court.3 If an acceptable plan is not 
put forth, the court may ultimately force a Chapter 7 liquidation of the firm.
Direct Costs of Bankruptcy
The bankruptcy code is designed to provide an orderly process for settling a firm’s debts. 
However, the process is still complex, time-consuming, and costly. When a corporation 
becomes financially distressed, outside professionals, such as legal and accounting experts, 
consultants, appraisers, auctioneers, and others with experience selling distressed assets, are 
generally hired. Investment bankers may also assist with a potential financial restructuring.
These outside experts are costly. Between 2003 and 2005, United Airlines paid a team 
of over 30 advisory firms an average of $8.6 million per month for legal and professional 
services related to its Chapter 11 reorganization. Enron spent a then-record $30 million 
per month on legal and accounting fees in bankruptcy, with the total cost exceeding $750 
million. WorldCom paid its advisors $620 million as part of its reorganization to become 
MCI, and the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, the largest in history, has reportedly entailed 
fees of $2.2 billion.4
3Specifically, management holds the exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan for the first 120 days, 
and this period may be extended indefinitely by the bankruptcy court. Thereafter, any interested party 
may propose a plan. Creditors who will receive full payment or have their claims fully reinstated under 
the plan are deemed unimpaired, and do not vote on the reorganization plan. All impaired creditors are 
grouped according to the nature of their claims. If the plan is approved by creditors holding two-thirds 
of the claim amount in each group and a majority in the number of the claims in each group, the court 
will confirm the plan. Even if all groups do not approve the plan, the court may still impose the plan (in 
a process commonly known as a “cram down”) if it deems the plan fair and equitable with respect to each 
group that objected.

588	
Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
In addition to the money spent by the firm, the creditors may incur costs during the 
bankruptcy process. In the case of Chapter 11 reorganization, creditors must often wait sev-
eral years for a reorganization plan to be approved and to receive payment. To ensure that 
their rights and interests are respected, and to assist in valuing their claims in a proposed 
reorganization, creditors may seek separate legal representation and professional advice.
Whether paid by the firm or its creditors, these direct costs of bankruptcy reduce the 
value of the assets that the firm’s investors will ultimately receive. In some cases, such as 
Enron, reorganization costs may approach 10% of the value of the assets. Studies typically 
report that the average direct costs of bankruptcy are approximately 3% to 4% of the pre-
bankruptcy market value of total assets.5 The costs are likely to be higher for firms with 
more complicated business operations and for firms with larger numbers of creditors, 
because it may be more difficult to reach agreement among many creditors regarding the 
final disposition of the firm’s assets. Because many aspects of the bankruptcy process are 
independent of the size of the firm, the costs are typically higher, in percentage terms, for 
smaller firms. A study of Chapter 7 liquidations of small businesses found that the average 
direct costs of bankruptcy were 12% of the value of the firm’s assets.6
Given the substantial legal and other direct costs of bankruptcy, firms in financial dis-
tress can avoid filing for bankruptcy by first negotiating directly with creditors. When a 
financially distressed firm is successful at reorganizing outside of bankruptcy, it is called 
a workout. Consequently, the direct costs of bankruptcy should not substantially exceed 
the cost of a workout. Another approach is a prepackaged bankruptcy (or “prepack”), 
in which a firm will first develop a reorganization plan with the agreement of its main 
creditors, and then file Chapter 11 to implement the plan (and pressure any creditors who 
attempt to hold out for better terms). With a prepack, the firm emerges from bankruptcy 
quickly and with minimal direct costs.7
Indirect Costs of Financial Distress
Aside from the direct legal and administrative costs of bankruptcy, many other indirect 
costs are associated with financial distress (whether or not the firm has formally filed for 
bankruptcy). While these costs are difficult to measure accurately, they are often much 
larger than the direct costs of bankruptcy.
Loss of Customers.  Because bankruptcy may enable or encourage firms to walk away 
from commitments to their customers, customers may be unwilling to purchase

estimate that due to speedier resolution, the direct costs of bankruptcy fell by more than 50% during the 
1990s to approximately 1.5% of firm value (“The Determinants of Professional Fees in Large Bankruptcy

­products whose value depends on future support or service from the firm. For example, 
customers will be reluctant to buy plane tickets in advance from a distressed airline that 
may cease operations, or to purchase autos from a distressed manufacturer that may fail 
to honor its warranties or provide replacement parts. Similarly, many technology firms’ 
customers may hesitate to commit to a hardware or software platform that may not be 
supported or upgraded in the future. In contrast, the loss of customers is likely to be 
small for producers of raw materials (such as sugar or aluminum), as the value of these 
goods, once delivered, does not depend on the seller’s continued success.8
Loss of Suppliers.  Customers are not the only ones who retreat from a firm in financial 
distress. Suppliers may also be unwilling to provide a firm with inventory if they fear 
they will not be paid. For example, Kmart Corporation filed for bankruptcy protection 
in January 2002 in part because the decline in its stock price scared suppliers, which 
then refused to ship goods. Similarly, Swiss Air was forced to shut down because its 
suppliers refused to fuel its planes. This type of disruption is an important financial 
distress cost for firms that rely heavily on trade credit. In many cases, the bankruptcy fil-
ing itself can alleviate these problems through debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing. 
DIP financing is new debt issued by a bankrupt firm. Because this kind of debt is senior 
to all existing creditors, it allows a firm that has filed for bankruptcy renewed access to 
financing to keep operating.
Loss of Employees.  Because firms in distress cannot offer job security with long-term 
employment contracts, they may have difficulty hiring new employees, and existing 
employees may quit or be hired away. Retaining key employees may be costly: Pacific 
Gas and Electric Corporation implemented a retention program costing over $80 mil-
lion to retain 17 key employees while in bankruptcy.9 This type of financial distress cost 
is likely to be high for firms whose value is derived largely from their human resources.
Loss of Receivables.  Firms in financial distress tend to have difficulty collecting money 
that is owed to them. According to one of Enron’s bankruptcy lawyers, “Many cus-
tomers who owe smaller amounts are trying to hide from us. They must believe that 
Enron will never bother with them because the amounts are not particularly large in any 
individual case.”10 Knowing that the firm might go out of business or at least experi-
ence significant management turnover reduces the incentive of customers to maintain a 
reputation for timely payment.
Fire Sales of Assets.  In an effort to avoid bankruptcy and its associated costs, companies in 
distress may attempt to sell assets quickly to raise cash. To do so, the firm may accept a 
lower price than would be optimal if it were financially healthy. Indeed, a study of airlines 
by Todd Pulvino shows that companies in bankruptcy or financial distress sell their air-
craft at prices that are 15% to 40% below the prices received by healthier rivals.11 
8See S. Titman, “The Effect of Capital Structure on a Firm’s Liquidation Decision,” Journal of Financial 
Economics 13 (1984): 137–151. T. Opler and S. Titman report 17.7% lower sales growth for highly lever-
aged firms compared to their less leveraged competitors in R&D-intensive industries during downturns 
(“Financial Distress and Corporate Performance,” Journal of Finance 49 (1994): 1015–1040).

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
Discounts are also observed when distressed firms attempt to sell subsidiaries. The costs 
of selling assets below their value are greatest for firms with assets that lack competitive, 
liquid markets.
Inefficient Liquidation.  Bankruptcy protection can be used by management to delay the 
liquidation of a firm that should be shut down. A study by Lawrence Weiss and Karen 
Wruck estimates that Eastern Airlines lost more than 50% of its value while in bank-
ruptcy because management was allowed to continue making negative-NPV invest-
ments.12 On the other hand, companies in bankruptcy may be forced to liquidate assets 
that would be more valuable if held. For example, as a result of its default, Lehman 
Brothers was forced to terminate 80% of its derivatives contracts with counterparties, in 
many cases at purportedly unattractive terms.13
Costs to Creditors.  Aside from the direct legal costs that creditors may incur when a firm 
defaults, there may be other indirect costs to creditors. If the loan to the firm was a sig-
nificant asset for the creditor, default of the firm may lead to costly financial distress for 
the creditor.14 For example, in the 2008 financial crisis, the Lehman Brothers’ bank-
ruptcy in turn helped push many of Lehman’s creditors into financial distress as well.
Because bankruptcy is a choice the firm’s investors and creditors make, there is a limit to 
the direct and indirect costs on them that result from the firm’s decision to go through the 
bankruptcy process. If these costs were too large, they could be largely avoided by negotiat-
ing a workout or doing a prepackaged bankruptcy. Thus, these costs should not exceed the 
cost of renegotiating with the firm’s creditors.15
On the other hand, there is no such limit on the indirect costs of financial distress that 
arise from the firm’s customers, suppliers, or employees. Many of these costs are incurred 
even prior to bankruptcy, in anticipation of the fact that the firm may use bankruptcy as an 
opportunity to renegotiate its contracts and commitments. For example, the firm may use 
bankruptcy as a way to renege on promises of future employment or retirement benefits for 
employees, to stop honoring warranties on its products, or to back out of unfavorable deliv-
ery contracts with its suppliers. Because of this fear that the firm will not honor its long-
term commitments in bankruptcy, highly levered firms may need to pay higher wages to 
their employees, charge less for their products, and pay more to their suppliers than similar 
firms with less leverage. Because these costs are not limited by the cost of renegotiating to 
avoid bankruptcy, they may be substantially greater than other kinds of bankruptcy costs.16

14While these costs are borne by the creditor and not by the firm, the creditor will consider these potential 
costs when setting the rate of the loan.

Their Significance to the Theory of Optimal Capital Structure,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative 
Analysis 23 (1988): 27–38.
16There is evidence that firms can use bankruptcy to improve efficiency (A. Kalay, R. Singhal, and 
E. Tashjian, “Is Chapter 11 costly?” Journal of Financial Economics, 84 (2007): 772–796) but that these 
gains may come at the expense of workers (L. Jacobson, R. LaLonde, and D. Sullivan, “Earnings Losses of 
Displaced Workers,” American Economic Review 83 (1993): 685–709). J. Berk, R. Stanton, and J. Zech-
ner, “Human Capital, Bankruptcy and Capital Structure,” Journal of Finance 65 (2009): 891–925, argue 
that firms may choose not to issue debt in order to increase their ability to commit to long-term labor 
contracts.

	
16.2  The Costs of Bankruptcy and Financial Distress	
591
Overall Impact of Indirect Costs.  In total, the indirect costs of financial distress can be 
substantial. When estimating them, however, we must remember two important points. 
First, we need to identify losses to total firm value (and not solely losses to equity hold-
ers or debt holders, or transfers between them). Second, we need to identify the incre-
mental losses that are associated with financial distress, above and beyond any losses that 
would occur due to the firm’s economic distress. A study of highly levered firms by Gregor 
Andrade and Steven Kaplan estimated a potential loss due to financial distress of 10% to 
20% of firm value.17 Next, we consider the consequences of these potential costs of lever-
age for firm value.

tress, whereas the loss of customers who fear the firm will stop honoring warranties is?

process following the prepack agreement. Yet, getting the 
debt holders to agree required additional government capi-
tal commitments and unprecedented political pressure. In 
many cases, the senior debt holders were banks that were 
already receiving TARP aid. Perhaps as a cost of receiving 
this aid, they accepted a deal that put the claims of unse-
cured creditors such as the United Auto Workers ahead of 
their more senior claims.** So, while some creditors may 
have been harmed, there is no doubt that the unprec-
edented cooperation among investors, and more impor-
tantly, government intervention, avoided a long and costly 
bankruptcy.
*The Chrysler employee pension plan owned 55% of Chrysler, Fiat 
20%, the U.S. Treasury 8%, and the Canadian government 2%. The 
rest of the equity was split amongst the remaining debt claimants.
**Not all creditors bowed willingly to the government pressure. A group 
of pension funds opposed the prepack. In the end the Supreme Court 
sided with the company and refused to hear their appeal. Perhaps not 
surprisingly, as a result of this intervention, other unionized firms with 
large pensions saw their borrowing costs increase as creditors anticipated 
the possibility of similar resolutions. (See B. Blaylock, A. Edwards, and 
J. Stanfield, “The Role of Government in the Labor-Creditor Relation-
ship: Evidence from the Chrysler Bankruptcy,” Journal of Financial and 
Quantitative Analysis 50 (2015): 325–348.
In November 2008, Chrysler CEO Robert Nardelli flew by 
private jet to Washington with a simple message: Without a 
government bailout, a Chrysler bankruptcy was inevitable. 
Congress was not convinced—it felt that bankruptcy was 
inevitable with or without a bailout and that the automaker 
needed to provide a more convincing plan to justify govern-
ment funding. A return trip in December (this time by auto-
mobile) yielded a similar result. Bypassing Congress, outgoing 
President Bush decided to bail out Chrysler with funds from 
the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). In the end the gov-
ernment provided Chrysler with $8 billion in debt financing.
As a durable goods manufacturer, a lengthy bankruptcy 
would have entailed significant bankruptcy costs. Indeed, 
sales were already suffering in part due to customer concerns 
about Chrysler’s future. In response, President Obama took 
the unprecedented step of guaranteeing warranties on all 
new Chrysler cars in March 2009.
Despite all this assistance, on April 30, 2009, Chrysler 
declared bankruptcy as part of a government-orchestrated 
prepack. Just 41 days later, Chrysler emerged from bank-
ruptcy as a Fiat-run, employee-owned,* and government-
financed corporation.
Many potential bankruptcy costs were avoided because 
of the speed with which Chrysler transited the bankruptcy

16.3	 Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value
The costs of financial distress described in the previous section represent an important 
departure from Modigliani and Miller’s assumption of perfect capital markets. MM 
assumed that the cash flows of a firm’s assets do not depend on its choice of capital struc-
ture. As we have discussed, however, levered firms risk incurring financial distress costs that 
reduce the cash flows available to investors.
Armin Industries: The Impact of Financial Distress Costs
To illustrate how these financial distress costs affect firm value, consider again the example 
of Armin Industries. With all-equity financing, Armin’s assets will be worth $150 million 
if its new product succeeds and $80 million if the new product fails. In contrast, with debt 
of $100 million, Armin will be forced into bankruptcy if the new product fails. In this case, 
some of the value of Armin’s assets will be lost to bankruptcy and financial distress costs. 
As a result, debt holders will receive less than $80 million. We show the impact of these 
costs in Table 16.2, where we assume debt holders receive only $60 million after account-
ing for the costs of financial distress.
As Table 16.2 shows, the total value to all investors is now less with leverage than it is 
­without leverage when the new product fails. The difference of $80 million - $60 million
= $20 million is due to financial distress costs. These costs will lower the total value of the 
firm with leverage, and MM’s Proposition I will no longer hold, as illustrated in Example 16.2.
Example 16.2
Firm Value When Financial Distress Is Costly
Problem
Compare the current value of Armin Industries with and without leverage, given the data in 
Table 16.2. Assume that the risk-free rate is 5%, the new product is equally likely to succeed or 
fail, and the risk is diversifiable.
Solution
With and without leverage, the payments to equity holders are the same as in Example 16.1. 
There we computed the value of unlevered equity as $109.52 million and the value of levered 
equity as $23.81 million. But due to bankruptcy costs, the value of the debt is now
Debt =
1
2 (100) + 1
2 (60)
1.05
= $76.19 million
The value of the levered firm is V L = E + D = 23.81 + 76.19 = $100 million, which is less 
than the value of the unlevered firm, V U = $109.52 million. Thus, due to bankruptcy costs, the 
value of the levered firm is $9.52 million less than its value without leverage. This loss equals the 
present value of the $20 million in financial distress costs the firm will pay if the product fails:
PV (Financial Distress Costs) =
1
2 (0) + 1
2 (20)
1.05
= $9.52 million
Who Pays for Financial Distress Costs?
The financial distress costs in Table 16.2 reduce the payments to the debt holders when the 
new product has failed. In that case, the equity holders have already lost their investment 
and have no further interest in the firm. It might seem as though these costs are irrelevant 

	
16.3  Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value	
593
from the shareholders’ perspective. Why should equity holders care about costs borne by 
debt holders?
It is true that after a firm is in bankruptcy, equity holders care little about bankruptcy 
costs. But debt holders are not foolish—they recognize that when the firm defaults, they 
will not be able to get the full value of the assets. As a result, they will pay less for the debt 
initially. How much less? Precisely the amount they will ultimately give up—the present 
value of the bankruptcy costs.
But if the debt holders pay less for the debt, there is less money available for the firm to 
pay dividends, repurchase shares, and make investments. That is, this difference is money 
out of the equity holders’ pockets. This logic leads to the following general result:
When securities are fairly priced, the original shareholders of a firm pay the present value of 
the costs associated with bankruptcy and financial distress.
Example 16.3
Financial Distress Costs and the Stock Price
Problem
Suppose that at the beginning of the year, Armin Industries has 10 million shares outstanding 
and no debt. Armin then announces plans to issue one-year debt with a face value of $100 mil-
lion and to use the proceeds to repurchase shares. Given the data in Table 16.2, what will the 
new share price be? As in the previous examples, assume the risk-free rate is 5%, the new product 
is equally likely to succeed or fail, and this risk is diversifiable.
Solution
From Example 16.1, the value of the firm without leverage is $109.52 million. With 10 mil-
lion shares outstanding, this value corresponds to an initial share price of $10.952 per share. In 
­Example 16.2, we saw that with leverage, the total value of the firm is only $100 million. In antic-
ipation of this decline in value, the price of the stock should fall to $100 million , 10 million  
 shares = $10.00 per share on announcement of the recapitalization.
Let’s check this result. From Example 16.2, due to bankruptcy costs, the new debt is worth 
$76.19 million. Thus, at a price of $10 per share, Armin will repurchase 7.619 million shares, 
leaving 2.381 million shares outstanding. In Example 16.1, we computed the value of levered 
equity as $23.81 million. Dividing by the number of shares gives a share price after the transac-
tion of
$23.81 million , 2.381 million shares = $10.00 per share
Thus, the recapitalization will cost shareholders $0.952 per share or $9.52 million in total. 
This cost matches the present value of financial distress costs computed in Example 16.2. Thus, 
although debt holders bear these costs in the end, shareholders pay the present value of the costs 
of financial distress upfront.

1.	 Armin incurred financial distress costs only in the event that the new product failed. Why might 
Armin incur financial distress costs even before the success or failure of the new product is 
known?
	
2.	 True or False: If bankruptcy costs are only incurred once the firm is in bankruptcy and its equity is 
worthless, then these costs will not affect the initial value of the firm.
	
16.4	 Optimal Capital Structure: The Trade-Off 
Theory
We can now combine our knowledge of the benefits of leverage from the interest tax shield 
(discussed in Chapter 15) with the costs of financial distress to determine the amount of 
debt that a firm should issue to maximize its value. The analysis presented in this section is 
called the trade-off theory because it weighs the benefits of debt that result from shielding 
cash flows from taxes against the costs of financial distress associated with leverage.
According to this theory, the total value of a levered firm equals the value of the firm with-
out leverage plus the present value of the tax savings from debt, less the present value of financial 
distress costs:
	
V L = V U + PV(Interest Tax Shield) - PV(Financial Distress Costs)
(16.1)
Equation 16.1 shows that leverage has costs as well as benefits. Firms have an incentive to 
increase leverage to exploit the tax benefits of debt. But with too much debt, they are more 
likely to risk default and incur financial distress costs.
The Present Value of Financial Distress Costs
Aside from simple examples, calculating the precise present value of financial distress costs 
is quite complicated. Three key factors determine the present value of financial distress 
costs: (1) the probability of financial distress, (2) the magnitude of the costs if the firm is in 
distress, and (3) the appropriate discount rate for the distress costs. In Example 16.2, when 
Armin is levered, the present value of its financial distress costs depends on the probability 
that the new product will fail (50%), the magnitude of the costs if it does fail ($20 mil-
lion), and the discount rate (5%).
What determines each of these factors? The probability of financial distress depends 
on the likelihood that a firm will be unable to meet its debt commitments and therefore 
default. This probability increases with the amount of a firm’s liabilities (relative to its 
assets). It also increases with the volatility of a firm’s cash flows and asset values. Thus, firms 
with steady, reliable cash flows, such as utility companies, are able to use high levels of debt 
and still have a very low probability of default. Firms whose value and cash flows are very 
volatile (for example, semiconductor firms) must have much lower levels of debt to avoid 
a significant risk of default.
The magnitude of the financial distress costs will depend on the relative importance 
of the costs discussed in Section 16.2, and is also likely to vary by industry. For example, 
firms, such as technology firms, whose value comes largely from human capital, are likely 
to incur high costs when they risk financial distress, due to the potential for loss of custom-
ers and the need to hire and retain key personnel, as well as a lack of tangible assets that can 
be easily liquidated. In contrast, firms whose main assets are physical capital, such as real 
estate firms, are likely to have lower costs of financial distress, because a greater portion of 
their value derives from assets that can be sold relatively easily.

	
16.4  Optimal Capital Structure: The Trade-Off Theory	
595
Finally, the discount rate for the distress costs will depend on the firm’s market risk. 
Note that because distress costs are high when the firm does poorly, the beta of distress 
costs will have an opposite sign to that of the firm.18 Also, the higher the firm’s beta, the 
more likely it will be in distress in an economic downturn, and thus the more negative the 
beta of its distress costs will be. Because a more negative beta leads to a lower cost of capital 
(below the risk-free rate), other things equal the present value of distress costs will be higher 
for high beta firms.
Optimal Leverage
Figure 16.1 shows how the value of a levered firm, V L, varies with the level of permanent 
debt, D, according to Eq. 16.1. With no debt, the value of the firm is V U. For low levels 
of debt, the risk of default remains low and the main effect of an increase in leverage is an 
increase in the interest tax shield, which has present value t*D, where t* is the effective 
tax advantage of debt calculated in Chapter 15. If there were no costs of financial distress, 
the value would continue to increase at this rate until the interest on the debt exceeds the 
firm’s earnings before interest and taxes and the tax shield is exhausted.
The costs of financial distress reduce the value of the levered firm, V L. The amount of the 
reduction increases with the probability of default, which in turn increases with the level of 
the debt D. The trade-off theory states that firms should increase their leverage until it reaches 
the level D* for which V L is maximized. At this point, the tax savings that result from increas-
ing leverage are just offset by the increased probability of incurring the costs of financial distress.
18For intuition, consider a law firm specializing in bankruptcy. Because profits will be higher in down-
turns, the law firm will have negative beta. Formally, the beta of distress costs is similar to the beta of a 
put option on the firm, which we calculate in Chapter 21 (see Figure 21.8). See also H. Almeida and 
T. ­Philippon, “The Risk-Adjusted Cost of Financial Distress,” Journal of Finance 62 (2007): 2557–2586.

As the level of debt, D, 
increases, the tax ­benefits 
of debt increase by t*D 
until the ­interest expense 
exceeds the firm’s EBIT (see 
­Figure 15.8). The ­probability 
of default, and hence the 
present value of financial 
distress costs, also increase 
with D. The optimal level of 
debt, D*, occurs when these 
effects balance out and V L 
is maximized. D* will be lower 
for firms with higher costs of 
financial distress.

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
Figure 16.1 also illustrates the optimal debt choices for two types of firms. The optimal 
debt choice for a firm with low costs of financial distress is indicated by D*low, and the 
optimal debt choice for a firm with high costs of financial distress is indicated by D*high. 
Not surprisingly, with higher costs of financial distress, it is optimal for the firm to choose 
lower leverage.
The trade-off theory helps to resolve two puzzles regarding leverage that arose in Chap-
ter 15. First, the presence of financial distress costs can explain why firms choose debt 
levels that are too low to fully exploit the interest tax shield. Second, differences in the 
magnitude of financial distress costs and the volatility of cash flows can explain the differ-
ences in the use of leverage across industries. That said, bankruptcy costs alone may not be 
sufficient to explain all of the variation observed. Fortunately, the trade-off theory can be 
easily extended to include other effects of leverage—which may be even more important 
than financial distress costs—that we discuss next.
Example 16.4
Choosing an Optimal Debt Level
Problem
Greenleaf Industries is considering adding leverage to its capital structure. Greenleaf’s managers 
believe they can add as much as $35 million in debt and exploit the benefits of the tax shield (for 
which they estimate t* = 15%). However, they also recognize that higher debt increases the risk 
of financial distress. Based on simulations of the firm’s future cash flows, the CFO has made the 
following estimates (in millions of dollars):19
What is the optimal debt choice for Greenleaf?
Solution
From Eq. 16.1, the net benefit of debt is determined by subtracting PV (Financial distress costs) 
from PV (Interest tax shield). The net benefit for each level of debt is
The level of debt that leads to the highest net benefit is $20 million. Greenleaf will gain $3 mil-
lion due to tax shields, and lose $0.38 million due to the present value of distress costs, for a net 
gain of $2.62 million.
19The PV of the interest tax shield is computed as t*D. The PV of financial distress costs is generally 
­difficult to estimate and requires option valuation techniques we introduce in Part 7.

16.5  Exploiting Debt Holders: The Agency Costs of Leverage 	
597
	
16.5	 Exploiting Debt Holders: 
The Agency Costs of Leverage
In this section, we consider another way that capital structure can affect a firm’s cash flows: 
It can alter managers’ incentives and change their investment decisions. If these changes 
have a negative NPV, they will be costly for the firm.
The type of costs we describe in this section are examples of agency costs—costs that 
arise when there are conflicts of interest between stakeholders. Because top managers often 
hold shares in the firm and are hired and retained with the approval of the board of direc-
tors, which itself is elected by shareholders, managers will generally make decisions that 
increase the value of the firm’s equity. When a firm has leverage, a conflict of interest exists 
if investment decisions have different consequences for the value of equity and the value 
of debt. Such a conflict is most likely to occur when the risk of financial distress is high. 
In some circumstances, managers may take actions that benefit shareholders but harm the 
firm’s creditors and lower the total value of the firm.
We illustrate this possibility by considering Baxter Inc., a firm that is facing financial dis-
tress. Baxter has a loan of $1 million due at the end of the year. Without a change in its strat-
egy, the market value of its assets will be only $900,000 at that time, and Baxter will default 
on its debt. In this situation, let’s consider several types of agency costs that might arise.
Excessive Risk-Taking and Asset Substitution
Baxter executives are considering a new strategy that seemed promising initially but appears 
risky after closer analysis. The new strategy requires no upfront investment, but it has only 
a 50% chance of success. If it succeeds, it will increase the value of the firm’s assets to 
$1.3 million. If it fails, the value of the firm’s assets will fall to $300,000. Therefore, the 
expected value of the firm’s assets under the new strategy is 50% * $1.3 million + 50% * 
$300,000 = $800,000, a decline of $100,000 from their value of $900,000 under the old 
strategy. Despite the negative expected payoff, some within the firm have suggested that 
Baxter should go ahead with the new strategy, in the interest of better serving its share­
holders. How can shareholders benefit from this decision?
As Table 16.3 shows, if Baxter does nothing, it will ultimately default and equity holders 
will get nothing with certainty. Thus, equity holders have nothing to lose if Baxter tries the 
risky strategy. If the strategy succeeds, equity holders will receive $300,000 after paying off 
the debt. Given a 50% chance of success, the equity holders’ expected payoff is $150,000.
Clearly, equity holders gain from this strategy, even though it has a negative expected 
payoff. Who loses? The debt holders: If the strategy fails, they bear the loss. As shown in 
Table 16.3, if the project succeeds, debt holders are fully repaid and receive $1 million. If 
the project fails, they receive only $300,000. Overall, the debt holders’ expected payoff is

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
$650,000, a loss of $250,000 relative to the $900,000 they would have received under the 
old strategy. This loss corresponds to the $100,000 expected loss of the risky strategy and 
the $150,000 gain of the equity holders. Effectively, the equity holders are gambling with 
the debt holders’ money.
This example illustrates a general point: When a firm faces financial distress, shareholders can 
gain from decisions that increase the risk of the firm sufficiently, even if they have a negative NPV. 
Because leverage gives shareholders an incentive to replace low-risk assets with riskier ones, this 
result is often referred to as the asset substitution problem.20 It can also lead to over-investment, 
as shareholders may gain if the firm undertakes negative-NPV, but sufficiently risky, projects.
In either case, if the firm increases risk through a negative-NPV decision or investment, 
the total value of the firm will be reduced. Anticipating this bad behavior, security holders 
will pay less for the firm initially. This cost is likely to be highest for firms that can easily 
increase the risk of their investments.
Debt Overhang and Under-Investment
Suppose Baxter does not pursue the risky strategy. Instead, the firm’s managers consider an 
attractive investment opportunity that requires an initial investment of $100,000 and will gen-
erate a risk-free return of 50%. That is, it has the following cash flows (in thousands of dollars):
If the current risk-free rate is 5%, this investment clearly has a positive NPV. The only 
problem is that Baxter does not have the cash on hand to make the investment.
Could Baxter raise the $100,000 by issuing new equity? Unfortunately, it cannot. Sup-
pose equity holders were to contribute the $100,000 in new capital required. Their payoff 
at the end of the year is shown in Table 16.4.
Thus, if equity holders contribute $100,000 to fund the project, they get back only 
$50,000. The other $100,000 from the project goes to the debt holders, whose payoff 
increases from $900,000 to $1 million. Because the debt holders receive most of the ben-
efit, this project is a negative-NPV investment opportunity for equity holders, even though 
it offers a positive NPV for the firm.
This example illustrates another general point: When a firm faces financial distress, it may 
choose not to finance new, positive-NPV projects. In this case, when shareholders prefer not to

invest in a positive-NPV project, we say there is a debt overhang or under-investment 
problem.21 This failure to invest is costly for debt holders and for the overall value of the 
firm, because it is giving up the NPV of the missed opportunities. The cost is highest for 
firms that are likely to have profitable future growth opportunities requiring large 
investments.
Cashing Out.  When a firm faces financial distress, shareholders have an incentive to with-
draw cash from the firm if possible. As an example, suppose Baxter has equipment it can 
sell for $25,000 at the beginning of the year. It will need this equipment to ­continue nor-
mal operations during the year; without it, Baxter will have to shut down some ­operations 
and the firm will be worth only $800,000 at year-end. Although selling the equipment 
reduces the value of the firm by $100,000, if it is likely that Baxter will default at year-
end, this cost would be borne by the debt holders. So, equity holders gain if Baxter sells 
the equipment and uses the $25,000 to pay an immediate cash dividend. This incentive to 
liquidate assets at prices below their actual value to the firm is an extreme form of under-
investment resulting from the debt overhang.
Estimating the Debt Overhang.  How much leverage must a firm have for there to be a 
significant debt overhang problem? While difficult to estimate precisely, we can use a use-
ful approximation. Suppose equity holders invest an amount I in a new investment project 
with similar risk to the rest of the firm. Let D and E be the market value of the firm’s debt 
and equity, and let bD and bE be their respective betas. Then the following approximate 
rule applies: equity holders will benefit from the new investment only if 22

(16.2)
21This agency cost of debt was formalized by S. Myers, “Determinants of Corporate Borrowing,” Journal 
of Financial Economics 5 (1977): 147–175.
22To understand this result, let dE and dD be the change in the value of equity and debt resulting from 
an investment with total value dE + dD = I + NPV. Equity holders benefit if they gain more than they 
invest, I 6 dE, which is equivalent to debt holders capturing less than the investment’s NPV, NPV 7 dD. 
Dividing the second inequality by the first, we have NPV/I 7 dD/dE. Eq. 16.2 follows from the approxi-
mation dD/dE  bD D/bE E; that is, the relative sensitivity of debt and equity to changes in asset values 
are similar whether those changes arise from investment decisions or market conditions. We derive this 
approximation in Chapter 21.

creditworthy and so lending to them was a negative NPV 
investment. But many, including the banks themselves, 
pointed to another culprit: banks were subject to debt over-
hang that made it extremely difficult to raise the capital 
needed to make positive-NPV loans. Thus, a primary ratio-
nale for governmental bailouts during the crisis was to provide 
banks with capital directly, alleviating their debt overhang and 
increasing the availability of credit to the rest of the economy.
Firms and financial institutions in or near financial distress 
in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis experienced many 
of the costs associated with financial distress that we have 
described, creating further negative consequences for the 
real economy.
Of particular concern was the seeming unwillingness 
of banks to make loans to borrowers at reasonable terms. 
One possible explanation was that the borrowers were not

That is, the project’s profitability index (NPV>I ) must exceed a cutoff equal to the rela-
tive riskiness of the firm’s debt (bD>bE ) times its debt-equity ratio (D>E ). Note that if the 
firm has no debt (D = 0) or its debt is risk free (bD = 0), then Eq. 16.2 is equivalent to 
NPV 7 0. But if the firm’s debt is risky, the required cutoff is positive and increases with 
the firm’s leverage. Equity holders will reject positive-NPV projects with profitability indi-
ces below the cutoff, leading to under-investment and reduction in firm value.
Agency Costs and the Value of Leverage
These examples illustrate how leverage can encourage managers and shareholders to act in 
ways that reduce firm value. In each case, the equity holders benefit at the expense of the 
debt holders. But, as with financial distress costs, it is the shareholders of the firm who 
ultimately bear these agency costs. Although equity holders may benefit at debt holders’ 
expense from these negative-NPV decisions in times of distress, debt holders recognize this 
possibility and pay less for the debt when it is first issued, reducing the amount the firm 
can distribute to shareholders. The net effect is a reduction in the initial share price of the 
firm corresponding to the negative NPV of the decisions.
These agency costs of debt can arise only if there is some chance the firm will default and 
impose losses on its debt holders. The magnitude of the agency costs increases with the risk, 
and therefore the amount, of the firm’s debt. Agency costs, therefore, represent another cost 
of increasing the firm’s leverage that will affect the firm’s optimal capital structure choice.
Example 16.5
Estimating the Debt Overhang
Problem
In Example 12.7, we estimated that Sears had an equity beta of 1.36, a debt beta of 0.17, and 
a debt-equity ratio of 0.30, while Saks had an equity beta of 1.85, a debt beta of 0.31, and a 
debt-equity ratio of 1.0. For both firms, estimate the minimum NPV such that a new $100,000 
investment (which does not change the volatility of the firm) will benefit shareholders. Which 
firm has the more severe debt overhang?
Solution
We can use Eq. 16.2 to estimate the cutoff level of the profitability index for Sears as 
(0.17/1.36) * 0.30 = 0.0375. Thus, the NPV would need to equal at least $3750 for the invest-
ment to benefit shareholders. For Saks, the cutoff is (0.31/1.85) * 1.0 = 0.1675. Thus, the min-
imum NPV for Saks is $16,750. Saks has the more severe debt overhang, as its shareholders will 
reject projects with positive NPVs up to this higher cutoff. Similarly, Saks shareholders would 
benefit if the firm “cashed out” by liquidating up to $116,750 worth of assets to pay out an 
additional $100,000 in dividends.
Example 16.6
Agency Costs and the Amount of Leverage
Problem
Would the agency costs described previously arise if Baxter had less leverage and owed $400,000 
rather than $1 million?
Solution
If Baxter makes no new investments or changes to its strategy, the firm will be worth $900,000. 
Thus, the firm will remain solvent and its equity will be worth $900,000 - $400,000 = $500,000.

	
16.5  Exploiting Debt Holders: The Agency Costs of Leverage 	
601
Consider first the decision to increase risk. If Baxter takes the risky strategy, its assets will be 
worth either $1.3 million or $300,000, so equity holders will receive $900,000 or $0. In this case, 
the equity holders’ expected payoff with the risky project is only $900,000 * 0.5 = $450,000. 
Thus equity holders will reject the risky strategy.
What about under-investment? If Baxter raises $100,000 from equity holders to fund a new 
investment that increases the value of assets by $150,000, the equity will be worth
$900,000 + $150,000 - $400,000 = $650,000
This is a gain of $150,000 over the $500,000 equity holders would receive without the invest-
ment. Because their payoff has gone up by $150,000 for a $100,000 investment, they will be 
willing to invest in the new project.
Similarly, Baxter has no incentive to cash out and sell equipment to pay a dividend. If the 
firm pays the dividend, equity holders receive $25,000 today. But their future payoff declines to 
$800,000 - $400,000 = $400,000. Thus, they give up $100,000 in one year for a $25,000 gain 
today. For any reasonable discount rate, this is a bad deal and stockholders will reject the dividend.
The Leverage Ratchet Effect
As we have seen, when an unlevered firm issues new debt, equity holders will bear any 
anticipated agency or bankruptcy costs via a discount in the price they receive for that new 
debt. This discount deters the firm from taking on high leverage initially if doing so would 
reduce the value of the firm.
But once a firm has debt already in place, some of the agency or bankruptcy costs that 
result from taking on additional leverage will fall on existing debt holders. Because that debt 
has already been sold, the negative consequences for these debt holders will not be borne 
by shareholders. As a result, shareholders may benefit from taking on higher leverage even 
though it might reduce the total value of the firm. (This result is another manifestation of 
the “cashing out” effect of debt overhang—levered firms may have an incentive to borrow 
further and disburse the proceeds to shareholders.)
In addition, debt overhang will inhibit firms from reducing leverage once it is in place. 
For if the firm tries to buy back debt, existing debt holders will gain (and debt holders who 
sell will demand a premium) due to the reduction in risk, agency costs, and bankruptcy 
costs associated with lower leverage. Thus, debt buybacks benefit the firm’s creditors at 
shareholders’ expense.
The leverage ratchet effect captures these observations: Once existing debt is in place, 
(1) shareholders may have an incentive to increase leverage even if it decreases the value of 
the firm,23 and (2) shareholders will not have an incentive to decrease leverage by buying 
back debt, even if it will increase the value of the firm.24 The leverage ratchet effect is an 
important additional agency cost of leverage which affects the firm’s future financing deci-
sions (rather than its investment decisions). While it will induce firms to borrow less ini-
tially in order to avoid these costs, over time it may lead to excessive leverage as shareholders 
prefer to increase, but not decrease, the firm’s debt.
23For an analysis of this effect and its consequence on loan markets, see D. Bizer and P. DeMarzo, 
“Sequential Banking,” Journal of Political Economy 100 (1992): 41–61.
24This result holds quite generally as long as the debt must be repurchased at its ex-post fair 
value; see A. Admati, P. DeMarzo, M. Hellwig, and P. Pfleiderer, “The Leverage Ratchet Effect,”  
papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2304969.

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
The reason equity holders do not gain by reducing debt in Example 16.7 is that in order 
to buy back the debt, the company must pay its post-transaction market value, which 
includes the value of the anticipated investment. A similar outcome would apply to the 
case of excessive risk-taking. By reducing debt, equity holders lose their incentive to take on 
a risky negative NPV investment. While this effect increases the value of the firm, equity 
holders would not gain as they would be forced to pay a price for the debt that reflects the 
value of eliminating the incentives for excessive risk-taking.
Debt Maturity and Covenants
Firms can do several things to mitigate the agency costs of debt. First, note that the mag-
nitude of agency costs likely depends on the maturity of debt. With long-term debt, equity 
holders have more opportunities to profit at the debt holders’ expense before the debt 
Example 16.7
Debt Overhang and the Leverage Ratchet Effect
Problem
Show that Baxter’s shareholders would not gain by reducing leverage from $1 million to 
$400,000, even though firm value would increase by eliminating the cost of underinvestment.
Solution
Recall that with $1 million in debt, Baxter would choose to forego an investment in a positive 
NPV risk-free project (see Table 16.4). Thus, its equity would be worth zero, and its debt would 
be worth $900,000. Also, as shown in Example 16.6, if the debt level were $400,000 instead of 
$1 million, the problem would not exist–equity holders would choose to take the positive NPV 
investment and firm value would increase by the NPV of the project.
Even so, equity holders will not choose to reduce debt. Because the debt will be default-
free after the buyback, and given the risk-free rate of 5%, each debt holder must be repaid at 
least $1/1.05 = $0.952 per dollar of principal, or would otherwise prefer to hold onto their 
debt while others sell. Therefore, to reduce its debt to $400,000, Baxter would need to raise 
$600,000/1.05 = $571,429 from equity holders. Baxter could then raise another $100,000 
from equity holders to invest in the new project. In the end, the value of the firm would be $1.05 
million, and after paying $400,000 in debt, equity holders would receive $650,000. But this 
amount is less than the total of $671,429 equity holders would need to invest upfront.
Why Do Firms Go Bankrupt?
If the costs of excessive leverage are substantial, one might 
wonder why firms ever default. After all, firms could choose 
high leverage when they are very profitable and will ben-
efit from the interest tax shield, and then avoid bankruptcy 
when profits fall by issuing equity to reduce leverage. By 
doing so firms would avoid the agency, distress and default 
costs we have described in this chapter—thus preserving the 
benefits of debt while avoiding its potential costs.
In reality it is rare to see firms behave in this way. Instead, 
when profits fall, leverage usually increases, often substan-
tially (mainly due to the decrease in the value of equity). 
Why don’t firm’s issue new equity to offset this?
The leverage ratchet effect helps to explain this behav-
ior. Lowering leverage by issuing new equity and using the 
proceeds to retire debt in distressed states would raise the 
value of the firm because it lowers the probability of incur-
ring bankruptcy costs. But equity holders do not get this 
value—the bankruptcy cost savings accrue to bondholders, 
not equity holders. So, if the firm pays off existing debt using 
cash raised by issuing new equity, or by reducing dividends 
or share repurchases, its share price will actually decline 
because equity holders must pay the cost of the leverage 
reduction while bondholders reap the benefits. Equity hold-
ers will therefore not choose such a strategy.

matures. Thus, agency costs are smallest for short-term debt.25 For example, if Baxter’s 
debt were due today, the firm would be forced to default or renegotiate with debt holders 
before it could increase risk, fail to invest, or cash out. However, by relying on short-term 
debt the firm will be obligated to repay or refinance its debt more frequently. Short-term 
debt may also increase the firm’s risk of financial distress and its associated costs.
Second, as a condition of making a loan, creditors often place restrictions on the actions 
that the firm can take. Such restrictions are referred to as debt covenants. ­Covenants may 
limit the firm’s ability to pay large dividends or restrict the types of investments that the 
firm can make. They also typically limit the amount of new debt the firm can take on. 
By preventing management from exploiting debt holders, these covenants may help to 
reduce agency costs. Conversely, because covenants hinder management flexibility, they 
have the potential to get in the way of positive NPV opportunities and so can have costs 
of their own.26

1.	 Why do firms have an incentive to both take excessive risk and under-invest when they are in 
financial distress?

might shareholders also benefit from this restriction?
	
16.6	 Motivating Managers: The Agency Benefits 
of Leverage
In Section 16.5, we took the view that managers act in the interests of the firm’s equity 
holders, and we considered the potential conflicts of interest between debt holders and 
equity holders when a firm has leverage. Of course, managers also have their own personal 
interests, which may differ from those of both equity holders and debt holders. Although 
managers often do own shares of the firm, in most large corporations they own only a very 
small fraction of the outstanding shares. And while the shareholders, through the board of 
directors, have the power to fire managers, they rarely do so unless the firm’s performance 
is exceptionally poor.27
This separation of ownership and control creates the possibility of management 
entrenchment: facing little threat of being fired and replaced, managers are free to run 
the firm in their own best interests. As a result, managers may make decisions that benefit 
themselves at investors’ expense. In this section, we consider how leverage can provide 
incentives for managers to run the firm more efficiently and effectively. The benefits we 
describe in this section, in addition to the tax benefits of leverage, give the firm an incen-
tive to use debt rather than equity financing.

ment turnover may be more sensitive to poor performance than previously measured (see D. Jenter and 
K. Lewellen, “Performance-induced CEO Turnover,” working paper, 2012).

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
Concentration of Ownership
One advantage of using leverage is that it allows the original owners of the firm to maintain 
their equity stake. As major shareholders, they will have a strong interest in doing what is 
best for the firm. Consider the following simple example:
Ross Jackson is the owner of a successful furniture store. He plans to expand by ­opening 
several new stores. Ross can either borrow the funds needed for expansion or raise the 
money by selling shares in the firm. If he issues equity, he will need to sell 40% of the firm 
to raise the necessary funds.
If Ross uses debt, he retains ownership of 100% of the firm’s equity. As long as the 
firm does not default, any decision Ross makes that increases the value of the firm by $1 
increases the value of his own stake by $1. But if Ross issues equity, he retains only 60% of 
the equity. Thus, Ross gains only $0.60 for every $1 increase in firm value.
The difference in Ross’ ownership stake changes his incentives in running the firm. ­Suppose 
the value of the firm depends largely on Ross’ personal effort. Ross is then likely to work 
harder, and the firm will be worth more, if he receives 100% of the gains rather than only 60%.
Another effect of issuing equity is Ross’ temptation to enjoy corporate perks, such as 
a large office with fancy artwork, a corporate limo and driver, a corporate jet, or a large 
expense account. With leverage, Ross is the sole owner and will bear the full cost of these 
perks. But with equity, Ross bears only 60% of the cost; the other 40% will be paid for 
by the new equity holders. Thus, with equity financing, it is more likely that Ross will 
­overspend on these luxuries.
The costs of reduced effort and excessive spending on perks are another form of agency 
cost. These agency costs arise in this case due to the dilution of ownership that occurs when 
equity financing is used. Who pays these agency costs? As always, if securities are fairly 
priced, the original owners of the firm pay the cost. In our example, Ross will find that if 
he chooses to issue equity, the new investors will discount the price they will pay to reflect 
Ross’ lower effort and increased spending on perks. In this case, using leverage can benefit 
the firm by preserving ownership concentration and avoiding these agency costs.28
Reduction of Wasteful Investment
While ownership is often concentrated for small, young firms, ownership typically becomes 
diluted over time as a firm grows. First, the original owners of the firm may retire, and the 
new managers likely will not hold a large ownership stake. Second, firms often need to raise 
more capital for investment than can be sustained using debt alone (recall the discussion of 
growth and leverage in Chapter 15). Third, owners will often choose to sell off their stakes 
and invest in a well-diversified portfolio to reduce risk.29 As a result, for large U.S. firms, 
most CEOs own less than 1% of their firms’ shares.
With such low ownership stakes, the potential for conflict of interest between manag-
ers and equity holders is high. Appropriate monitoring and standards of accountability 
28This potential benefit of leverage is discussed by M. Jensen and W. Meckling, “Theory of the Firm: 
Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure,” Journal of Financial Economics 3 (1976): 
305–360. However, because managers who own a large block of shares are more difficult to replace, 
increasing ownership concentration at lower levels (e.g., in the 5%–25% range) may increase entrench-
ment and reduce incentives; see R. Morck, A. Shleifer, and R. Vishny, “Management Ownership and 
Market Valuation,” Journal of Financial Economics 20 (1988): 293–315.
29According to one study, original owners tend to reduce their stake by more than 50% within nine years 
after the firm becomes a public company (B. Uroševic´, “Essays in Optimal Dynamic Risk Sharing in 
Equity and Debt Markets,” 2002, University of California, Berkeley).

are required to prevent abuse. While most successful firms have implemented appropriate 
mechanisms to protect shareholders, each year scandals are revealed in which managers 
have acted against shareholders’ interests.
While overspending on personal perks may be a problem for large firms, these costs are 
likely to be small relative to the overall value of the firm. A more serious concern for large 
corporations is that managers may make large, unprofitable investments: Bad investment 
decisions have destroyed many otherwise successful firms. But what would motivate man-
agers to make negative-NPV investments?
Some financial economists explain a manager’s willingness to engage in negative-NPV 
investments as empire building. According to this view, managers prefer to run large firms 
rather than small ones, so they will take on investments that increase the size—rather than 
the profitability—of the firm. One potential reason for this preference is that managers of 
large firms tend to earn higher salaries, and they may also have more prestige and garner 
greater publicity than managers of small firms. As a result, managers may expand (or fail 
to shut down) unprofitable divisions, pay too much for acquisitions, make unnecessary 
capital expenditures, or hire unnecessary employees.
Another reason that managers may over-invest is that they are overconfident. Even 
when managers attempt to act in shareholders’ interests, they may make mistakes. Manag-
ers tend to be bullish on the firm’s prospects and so may believe that new opportunities are 
better than they actually are. They may also become committed to investments the firm 
has already made and continue to invest in projects that should be canceled.30
For managers to engage in wasteful investment, they must have the cash to invest. This 
observation is the basis of the free cash flow hypothesis, the view that wasteful spending 
is more likely to occur when firms have high levels of cash flow in excess of what is needed 
30For evidence of the relationship between CEO overconfidence and investment distortions, see 
U. ­Malmendier and G. Tate, “CEO Overconfidence and Corporate Investment,” Journal of Finance 60 (2005):

33–45; and R. Roll, “The Hubris Hypothesis of Corporate Takeovers,” Journal of Business 59 (1986): 197–216.
Excessive Perks and Corporate Scandals
While most CEOs and managers exercise proper restraint 
when spending shareholders’ money, there have been some 
highly publicized exceptions that have come to light as cor-
porate scandals.
Former Enron CFO Andrew Fastow reportedly used 
complicated financial transactions to enrich himself with 
at least $30 million of shareholder money. Tyco Corpora-
tion’s ex-CEO Dennis Kozlowski will be remembered for 
his $6000 shower curtain, $6300 sewing basket, and $17 
million Fifth Avenue condo, all paid for with Tyco funds. 
In total, he and former CFO Mark Swartz were convicted 
of pilfering $600 million from company coffers.* Former 
WorldCom CEO Bernie Ebbers, who was convicted for his 
role in the firm’s $11 billion accounting scandal, borrowed 
more than $400 million from the company at favorable 
terms from late 2000 to early 2002. Among other things, 
he used the money from these loans to give gifts to friends 
and family, as well as build a house.† John Rigas and his son 
Timothy, former CEO and CFO of Adelphia Communica-
tions, were convicted of stealing $100 million from the firm 
as well as hiding $2 billion in corporate debt.
But these are exceptional cases. And they were not, in 
and of themselves, the cause of the firms’ downfalls, but 
rather a symptom of a broader problem of a lack of over-
sight and accountability within these firms, together with an 
opportunistic attitude of the managers involved.

Moral Hazard, Government Bailouts, and the Appeal of Leverage
whether those covenants are being satisfied.* Without this 
monitoring the likelihood of future abuses by equity holders 
and managers has likely been increased, as has the govern-
ment’s liability.
Moral hazard might also help to explain why bankers are 
opposed to higher capital requirements. As we pointed out 
in Chapter 14, in a perfect market, capital requirements can-
not affect the competitiveness of banks. However, because 
both deposit insurance and government bailouts subsidize 
bank debt, banks’ borrowing costs do not reflect either their 
risk or the costs associated with default. Thus, higher lever-
age both reduces banks’ tax obligations and increases the 
benefit they receive in bankruptcy from these subsidies, 
greatly favoring debt in the trade-off between tax subsidies 
and bankruptcy costs. Because taxpayers ultimately pay for 
these subsidies, the benefits of leverage to bank shareholders 
come largely at taxpayer expense.**
*As an example, a number of large banks continued to pay dividends 
during the crisis even after receiving bailout funds. Had the funds been 
raised from outside investors without any government guarantee, it is 
very likely the new investors would have restricted such payouts.
**See A. Admati, P. DeMarzo, M. Hellwig, and P. Pfleiderer, ­“Fallacies, 
Irrelevant Facts, and Myths in the Discussion of Capital Regulation: 
Why Bank Equity Is Not Socially Expensive,” papers.ssrn.com/sol3/
papers.cfm?abstract_id=2349739.
The term moral hazard refers to the idea that individuals will 
change their behavior if they are not fully exposed to its conse-
quences. Discussion of moral hazard’s role in the 2008 financial 
crisis has centered on mortgage brokers, investment bankers, 
and corporate managers who earned large bonuses when their 
businesses did well, but did not need to repay these bonuses 
later when things turned sour. The agency costs described in 
this chapter represent another form of moral hazard, as equity 
holders may take excessive risk or pay excessive dividends if the 
negative consequences will be borne by bondholders.
How are such abuses by equity holders normally held in 
check? Bondholders will either charge equity holders for the 
risk of this abuse by increasing the cost of debt, or, more 
likely, equity holders will credibly commit not to take on 
excessive risk by, for example, agreeing to very strong bond 
covenants and other monitoring.
Ironically, despite the potential immediate benefits of 
the federal bailouts in response to the 2008 financial crisis, 
by protecting the bondholders of many large corporations, 
the government may have simultaneously weakened this 
disciplining mechanism and thereby increased the likeli-
hood of future crises. With this precedent in place, all lend-
ers to corporations deemed “too big to fail” may presume 
they have an implicit government guarantee, thus lowering 
their incentives to insist on strong covenants and to monitor 
Global Financial Crisis
to make all positive-NPV investments and payments to debt holders.31 Only when cash is 
tight will managers be motivated to run the firm as efficiently as possible. According to this 
hypothesis, leverage increases firm value because it commits the firm to making future 
interest payments, thereby reducing excess cash flows and wasteful investment by 
managers.32
A related idea is that leverage can reduce the degree of managerial entrenchment because 
managers are more likely to be fired when a firm faces financial distress. Managers who are 
less entrenched may be more concerned about their performance and less likely to engage 
in wasteful investment. In addition, when the firm is highly levered, creditors themselves 
will closely monitor the actions of managers, providing an additional layer of management 
oversight.33
31The hypothesis that excess cash flow induces empire building was put forth by M. Jensen, “Agency Costs 
of Free Cash Flow, Corporate Finance, and Takeovers,” American Economic Review 76 (1986): 323–329.
32Of course, managers could also raise new capital for wasteful investment. But investors would be reluc-
tant to contribute to such an endeavor and would offer unfavorable terms. In addition, raising external 
funds would attract greater scrutiny and public criticism regarding the investment.
33See, for example, M. Harris and A. Raviv, “Capital Structure and the Informational Role of Debt,” 
Journal of Finance 45(2) (1990): 321–349.

	
16.7  Agency Costs and the Trade-Off Theory	
607
Leverage and Commitment
Leverage may also tie managers’ hands and commit them to pursue strategies with 
greater vigor than they would without the threat of financial distress. For example, 
when American Airlines was in labor negotiations with its unions in April 2003, the 
firm was able to win wage concessions by explaining that higher costs would push it 
into bankruptcy. (A similar situation enabled Delta Airlines to persuade its pilots to 
accept a 33% wage cut in November 2004.) Without the threat of financial distress, 
American’s managers might not have reached agreement with the union as quickly or 
achieved the same wage concessions.34
A firm with greater leverage may also become a fiercer competitor and act more aggres-
sively in protecting its markets because it cannot risk the possibility of bankruptcy. This 
commitment to aggressive behavior can scare off potential rivals. (This argument could 
work in reverse: A firm weakened by too much leverage might become so financially fragile 
that it crumbles in the face of competition, allowing other firms to erode its markets.)35

16.7	 Agency Costs and the Trade-Off Theory
We can now adjust Eq. 16.1 for the value of the firm to include the costs and benefits of 
the incentives that arise when the firm has leverage. This more complete equation follows:
	
V L = V U + PV(Interest Tax Shield) - PV(Financial Distress Costs)
	
-PV(Agency Costs of Debt) + PV(Agency Benefits of Debt)
(16.3)
The net effect of the costs and benefits of leverage on the value of a firm is illustrated in 
Figure 16.2. With no debt, the value of the firm is V U. As the debt level increases, the firm 
benefits from the interest tax shield (which has present value t*D). The firm also benefits 
from improved incentives for management, which reduce wasteful investment and perks. 
If the debt level is too large, however, firm value is reduced due to the loss of tax benefits 
(when interest exceeds EBIT), financial distress costs, and the agency costs of leverage. The 
optimal level of debt, D*, balances the costs and benefits of leverage.

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
The Optimal Debt Level
It is important to note that the relative magnitudes of the different costs and benefits of 
debt vary with the characteristics of the firm. Likewise, the optimal level of debt varies. As 
an example, let’s contrast the optimal capital structure choice for two types of firms.36
R&D-Intensive Firms.  Firms with high R&D costs and future growth opportunities typi-
cally maintain low debt levels. These firms tend to have low current free cash flows, so they 
need little debt to provide a tax shield or to control managerial spending. In addition, they 
tend to have high human capital, so there will be large costs as a result of financial distress. 
Also, these firms may find it easy to increase the risk of their business strategy (by pursu-
ing a riskier technology) and often need to raise additional capital to fund new investment 
opportunities. Thus, their agency costs of debt are also high. Biotechnology and technol-
ogy firms often maintain less than 10% leverage.
Low-Growth, Mature Firms.  Mature, low-growth firms with stable cash flows and tan-
gible assets often fall into the high-debt category. These firms tend to have high free cash 
flows with few good investment opportunities. Thus, the tax shield and incentive benefits 
of leverage are likely to be high. With tangible assets, the financial distress costs of leverage 
are likely to be low, as the assets can be liquidated for close to their full value. Examples of 
low-growth industries in which firms typically maintain greater than 20% leverage include 
real estate, utilities, and supermarket chains.

Debt Levels in Practice
The trade-off theory explains how firms should choose their capital structures to maximize 
value to current shareholders. Evaluating whether they actually do so is not so straightfor-
ward, however, as many of the costs of leverage are hard to measure.
Why might firms not choose an optimal capital structure? First, recall from the leverage 
ratchet effect discussed earlier that if the firm—perhaps due to negative shocks—has debt 
that exceeds D*, shareholders will find it costly to reduce leverage because the benefits will 
accrue to the firm’s creditors. 
On the other hand, capital structure decisions, like investment decisions, are made by 
managers who have their own incentives. ­Proponents of the management entrenchment 
theory of capital structure believe that managers choose a capital structure primarily to 
avoid the discipline of debt and maintain their own entrenchment. Thus, managers seek 
to minimize leverage to prevent the job loss that would accompany financial distress. Of 
course, if managers sacrifice too much firm value, disgruntled shareholders may try to 
replace them or sell the firm to an acquirer. Under this hypothesis, firms will have leverage 
that is less than the optimal level D* in ­Figure 16.2, and increase it toward D* only in 
response to a takeover threat or the threat of shareholder activism.37

16.8	 Asymmetric Information and Capital Structure
Throughout this chapter, we have assumed that managers, stockholders, and creditors have 
the same information. We have also assumed that securities are fairly priced: The firm’s 
shares and debt are priced according to their true underlying value. These assumptions may 
not always be accurate in practice. Managers’ information about the firm and its future cash 
flows is likely to be superior to that of outside investors—there is asymmetric information 
between managers and investors. In this section, we consider how asymmetric information 
may motivate managers to alter a firm’s capital structure.
Leverage as a Credible Signal
Consider the plight of Kim Smith, CEO of Beltran International, who believes her com-
pany’s stock is undervalued. Market analysts and investors are concerned that several of 
Beltran’s key patents will expire soon, and that new competition will force Beltran to cut 
prices or lose customers. Smith believes that new product innovations and soon-to-be-
introduced manufacturing improvements will keep Beltran ahead of its competitors and 
enable it to sustain its current profitability well into the future. She seeks to convince inves-
tors of Beltran’s promising future and to increase Beltran’s current stock price.
37See J. Zwiebel, “Dynamic Capital Structure Under Managerial Entrenchment,” American Economic Review 
86 (1996): 1197–1215; L. Zingales and W. Novaes, “Capital Structure Choice When Managers Are in 
Control: Entrenchment versus Efficiency,” Journal of Business 76 (2002): 49–82; and E. Morellec, “Can 
Managerial Discretion Explain Observed Leverage Ratios?” Review of Financial Studies 17 (2004): 257–294.

610	
Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
One potential strategy is to launch an investor relations campaign. Smith can issue press 
releases, describing the merits of the new innovations and the manufacturing improve-
ments. But Smith knows that investors may be skeptical of these press releases if their 
claims cannot be verified. After all, managers, much like politicians, have an incentive to 
sound optimistic and confident about what they can achieve.
Because investors expect her to be biased, to convince the market Smith must take 
actions that give credible signals of her knowledge of the firm. That is, she must take 
actions that the market understands she would be unwilling to do unless her statements 
were true. This idea is more general than manager–investor communication; it is at the 
heart of much human interaction. We call it the credibility principle:
Claims in one’s self-interest are credible only if they are supported by actions that would be too 
costly to take if the claims were untrue.
This principle is the essence behind the adage, “Actions speak louder than words.”
One way a firm can credibly convey its strength to investors is by making statements 
about its future prospects that investors and analysts can ultimately verify. Because the 
penalties for intentionally deceiving investors are large,38 investors will generally believe 
such statements.
For example, suppose Smith announces that pending long-term contracts from the 
U.S., British, and Japanese governments will increase revenues for Beltran by 30% next 
year. Because this statement can be verified after the fact, it would be costly to make it if 
untrue. For deliberate misrepresentation, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) would likely fine the firm and file charges against Smith. The firm could also be 
sued by its investors. These large costs would likely outweigh any potential benefits to 
Smith and Beltran for temporarily misleading investors and boosting the share price. Thus, 
investors will likely view the announcement as credible.
But what if Beltran cannot yet reveal specific details regarding its future prospects? 
­Perhaps the contracts for the government orders have not yet been signed or cannot be dis-
closed for other reasons. How can Smith credibly communicate her positive information 
regarding the firm?
One strategy is to commit the firm to large future debt payments. If Smith is right, then 
Beltran will have no trouble making the debt payments. But if Smith is making false claims 
and the firm does not grow, Beltran will have trouble paying its creditors and will experi-
ence financial distress. This distress will be costly for the firm and also for Smith, who will 
likely lose her job. Thus, Smith can use leverage as a way to convince investors that she does 
have information that the firm will grow, even if she cannot provide verifiable details about 
the sources of growth. Investors know that Beltran would be at risk of defaulting without 
growth opportunities, so they will interpret the additional leverage as a credible signal of 
the CEO’s confidence. The use of leverage as a way to signal good information to investors 
is known as the signaling theory of debt.39
38The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 increased the penalties for securities fraud to include up to 10 years of 
imprisonment.

nal of Economics 8 (1977): 23–40.

Example 16.8
Debt Signals Strength
Problem
Suppose that Beltran currently uses all-equity financing, and that Beltran’s market value in one 
year’s time will be either $100 million or $50 million depending on the success of the new 
strategy. Currently, investors view the outcomes as equally likely, but Smith has information that 
success is virtually certain. Will leverage of $25 million make Smith’s claims credible? How about 
leverage of $55 million?
Solution
If leverage is substantially less than $50 million, Beltran will have no risk of financial distress regard-
less of the outcome. As a result, there is no cost of leverage even if Smith does not have positive 
information. Thus, leverage of $25 million would not be a credible signal of strength to investors.
However, leverage of $55 million is likely to be a credible signal. If Smith has no positive 
information, there is a significant chance that Beltran will face bankruptcy under this burden 
of debt. Thus Smith would be unlikely to agree to this amount of leverage unless she is certain 
about the firm’s prospects.
Issuing Equity and Adverse Selection
Suppose a used-car dealer tells you he is willing to sell you a nice looking sports car for 
$5000 less than its typical price. Rather than feel lucky, perhaps your first reaction should 
be one of skepticism: If the dealer is willing to sell it for such a low price, there must be 
something wrong with the car—it is probably a “lemon.”
The idea that buyers will be skeptical of a seller’s motivation for selling was formalized by 
George Akerlof.40 Akerlof showed that if the seller has private information about the quality of 
the car, then his desire to sell reveals the car is probably of low quality. Buyers are therefore reluctant 
to buy except at heavily discounted prices. Owners of high-quality cars are reluctant to sell because 
they know buyers will think they are selling a lemon and offer only a low price. Consequently, 
the quality and prices of cars sold in the used-car market are both low. This result is referred to as 
adverse selection: The selection of cars sold in the used-car market is worse than average.
Adverse selection extends beyond the used-car market. In fact, it applies in any setting 
in which the seller has more information than the buyer. Adverse selection leads to the 
lemons principle:
When a seller has private information about the value of a good, buyers will discount the price 
they are willing to pay due to adverse selection.
We can apply this principle to the market for equity.41 Suppose the owner of a start-up 
company tells you that his firm is a wonderful investment opportunity—and then offers ­ 
to sell you 70% of his stake in the firm. He states that he is selling only because he wants to 
diversify. Although you appreciate this desire, you also suspect the owner may be eager to

­Economics 84 (1970): 488–500.

­Intermediation,” Journal of Finance 32 (1977): 371–387.

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
sell such a large stake because he has negative information about the firm’s future pros-
pects. That is, he may be trying to cash out before the bad news becomes known.42
As with the used-car dealer, a firm owner’s desire to sell equity may lead you to ques-
tion how good an investment opportunity it really is. Based on the lemons principle, you 
therefore reduce the price you are willing to pay. This discount of the price due to adverse 
selection is a potential cost of issuing equity, and it may make owners with good informa-
tion refrain from issuing equity.
42Again, if the owner of the firm (or the car, in the earlier example) has very specific information that can 
be verified ex-post, there are potential legal consequences for not revealing that information to a buyer. 
Generally, however, there is a great deal of subtle information the seller might have that would be impos-
sible to verify.
Example 16.9
Adverse Selection in Equity Markets
Problem
Zycor stock is worth either $100 per share, $80 per share, or $60 per share. Investors believe each 
case is equally likely, and the current share price is equal to the average value of $80.
Suppose the CEO of Zycor announces he will sell most of his holdings of the stock to diver-
sify. Diversifying is worth 10% of the share price—that is, the CEO would be willing to receive 
10% less than the shares are worth to achieve the benefits of diversification. If investors believe 
the CEO knows the true value, how will the share price change if he tries to sell? Will the CEO 
sell at the new share price?
Solution
If the true value of the shares were $100, the CEO would not be willing to sell at the market 
price of $80 per share, which would be 20% below their true value. So, if the CEO tries to sell, 
shareholders can conclude the shares are worth either $80 or $60. In that case, share price should 
fall to the average value of $70. But again, if the true value were $80, the CEO would be ­willing 
to sell for $72, but not $70 per share. So, if he still tries to sell, investors will know the true 
value is $60 per share. Thus, the CEO will sell only if the true value is the lowest possible price, 
$60 per share, and that is the price he will receive. If the CEO knows the firm’s stock is worth 
$100 or $80 per share, he will not sell even though he would prefer to diversify.
In explaining adverse selection, we considered an owner of a firm selling his or her own 
shares. What if a manager of the firm decides to sell securities on the firm’s behalf ? If the 
securities are sold at a price below their true value, the buyer’s windfall represents a cost for 
the firm’s current shareholders. Acting on behalf of the current shareholders, the manager 
may be unwilling to sell.43
Let’s consider a simple example. Gentec is a biotech firm with no debt, and its 20 mil-
lion shares are currently trading at $10 per share, for a total market value of $200 million. 
Based on the prospects for one of Gentec’s new drugs, management believes the true value 
of the company is $300 million, or $15 per share. Management believes the share price will 
reflect this higher value after the clinical trials for the drug are concluded next year.
Gentec has already announced plans to raise $60 million from investors to build a new 
research lab. It can raise the funds today by issuing 6 million new shares at the current 
price of $10 per share. In that case, after the good news comes out, the value of the firm’s 
assets will be $300 million (from the existing assets) plus $60 million (new lab), for a total 
43S. Myers and N. Majluf demonstrated this result, and a number of its implications for capital structure, 
in an influential paper, “Corporate Financing and Investment Decisions When Firms Have Information 
that Investors Do Not Have,” Journal of Financial Economics 13 (1984): 187–221.

value of $360 million. With 26 million shares outstanding, the new share price will be 
$360 million , 26 million shares = $13.85 per share.
But suppose Gentec waits for the good news to come out and the share price to rise to 
$15 before issuing the new shares. At that time, the firm will be able to raise the $60 million 
by selling 4 million shares. The firm’s assets will again be worth a total of $360 million, 
but Gentec will have only 24 million shares outstanding, which is consistent with the share 
price of $360 million , 24 million shares = $15 per share.
Thus, issuing new shares when management knows they are underpriced is costly for the 
original shareholders. Their shares will be worth only $13.85 rather than $15. As a result, 
if Gentec’s managers care primarily about the firm’s current shareholders, they will be reluc-
tant to sell securities at a price that is below their true value. If they believe the shares are 
underpriced, managers will prefer to wait until after the share price rises to issue equity.
This preference not to issue equity that is underpriced leads us to the same lemons 
problem we had before: Managers who know securities have a high value will not sell, and 
those who know they have a low value will sell. Due to this adverse selection, investors will 
be willing to pay only a low price for the securities. The lemons problem creates a cost for 
firms that need to raise capital from investors to fund new investments. If they try to issue 
equity, investors will discount the price they are willing to pay to reflect the possibility that 
managers are privy to bad news.
Implications for Equity Issuance
Adverse selection has a number of important implications for equity issuance. First and 
foremost, the lemons principle directly implies that
	
1.	 The stock price declines on the announcement of an equity issue.  When a 
firm issues equity, it signals to investors that its equity may be overpriced. As a 
result, investors are not willing to pay the pre-announcement price for the equity 
and so the stock price declines. Numerous studies have confirmed this result, find-
ing that the stock price falls about 3% on average on the announcement of an 
equity issue by a publicly traded U.S. firm.44
44See, e.g., P. Asquith and D. Mullins, “Equity Issues and Offering Dilution,” Journal of Financial Eco-
nomics 15 (1986): 61–89; R. Masulis and A. Korwar, “Seasoned Equity Offerings: An Empirical Investiga-
tion,” Journal of Financial Economics 15 (1986): 91–118; and W. Mikkelson and M. Partch, “Valuation 
Effects of Security Offerings and the Issuance Process,” Journal of Financial Economics 15 (1986): 31–60.
In 2001, George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph 
Stiglitz jointly received the Nobel Prize in economics for 
their analyses of markets with asymmetric information and 
adverse selection. In this chapter, we discuss the implications 
of their theory for firm capital structure. This theory, how-
ever, has much broader applications. As described on the 
Nobel Prize Web site (www.nobelprize.org):
Many markets are characterized by asymmetric informa-
tion: Actors on one side of the market have much better 
information than those on the other. Borrowers know more 
than lenders about their repayment prospects, managers 
and boards know more than shareholders about the firm’s 
profitability, and prospective clients know more than 
insurance companies about their accident risk. ­During 
the 1970s, this year’s Laureates laid the foundation for 
a general theory of markets with asymmetric informa-
tion. Applications have been abundant, ranging from 
­traditional agricultural markets to modern financial 
­markets. The Laureates’ contributions form the core of 
modern information economics.

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
As was true for Gentec, managers issuing equity have an incentive to delay the issue 
until any news that might positively affect the stock price becomes public. In contrast, 
there is no incentive to delay the issue if managers expect negative news to come out. These 
incentives lead to the following pattern:
	
2.	 The stock price tends to rise prior to the announcement of an equity 
issue.  This result is also supported empirically, as illustrated in Figure 16.3 using 
data from a study by Professors Deborah Lucas and Robert McDonald. They found 
that stocks with equity issues outperformed the market by almost 50% in the year 
and a half prior to the announcement of the issue.
Managers may also try to avoid the price decline associated with adverse selection by 
issuing equity at times when they have the smallest informational advantage over inves-
tors. For example, because a great deal of information is released to investors at the time 
of earnings announcements, equity issues are often timed to occur immediately after these 
announcements. That is,
	
3.	 Firms tend to issue equity when information asymmetries are minimized, such 
as immediately after earnings announcements.  Studies have confirmed this 
timing and reported that the negative stock price reaction is smallest immediately 
after earnings announcements.45
Implications for Capital Structure
Because managers find it costly to issue equity that is underpriced, they may seek alterna-
tive forms of financing. While debt issues may also suffer from adverse selection, because 
the value of low-risk debt is not very sensitive to managers’ private information about

the firm (but is instead determined mainly by interest rates), the degree of underpricing 
will tend to be smaller for debt than for equity. Of course, a firm can avoid underpricing 
altogether by financing investment using its cash (retained earnings) when possible. Thus,
Managers who perceive the firm’s equity is underpriced will have a preference to fund 
investment using retained earnings, or debt, rather than equity.
The converse to this statement is also true: Managers who perceive the firm’s equity 
to be overpriced will prefer to issue equity, as opposed to issuing debt or using retained 
earnings, to fund investment. However, due to the negative stock price reaction when 
issuing equity, it is less likely that equity will be overpriced. In fact, absent other motives 
to issue equity, if both managers and investors behave rationally, the price drop upon 
announcement may be sufficient to deter managers from issuing equity except as a last 
resort.
The idea that managers will prefer to use retained earnings first, and will issue new 
equity only as a last resort, is often referred to as the pecking order hypothesis, put 
forth by Stewart Myers.46 While difficult to test directly, this hypothesis is consistent 
with the aggregate data on corporate financing in Figure 16.4, which shows that firms 
tend to be net repurchasers (rather than issuers) of equity, whereas they are issuers of 
debt. Moreover, the vast majority of investment is funded by retained earnings, with net 
external financing amounting to less than 25% of capital expenditures in most years, 
and about 10% on average. These observations can also be consistent with the trade-
off theory of capital structure, however, and there is substantial evidence that firms do 
not follow a strict pecking order, as firms often issue equity even when borrowing is 
possible.47

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
Aside from a general preference for using retained earnings or debt as a source of fund-
ing rather than equity, adverse selection costs do not lead to a clear prediction regarding 
a firm’s overall capital structure. Instead, these costs imply that the managers’ choice of 
financing will depend, in addition to the other costs and benefits discussed in this chapter, 
on whether they believe the firm is currently underpriced or overpriced by investors. This 
dependence is sometimes referred to as the market timing view of capital structure: The 
firm’s overall capital structure depends in part on the market conditions that existed when 
it sought funding in the past. As a result, similar firms in the same industry might end up 
with very different, but nonetheless optimal, capital structures.48
Indeed, even the pecking order hypothesis does not provide a clear prediction regarding 
capital structure on its own. While it argues that firms should prefer to use retained earn-
ings, then debt, and then equity as funding sources, retained earnings are merely another 
form of equity financing (they increase the value of equity while the value of debt remains 
unchanged). Therefore, firms might have low leverage either because they are unable to 
issue additional debt and are forced to rely on equity financing or because they are suf-
ficiently profitable to finance all investment using retained earnings.
Moreover, if firms anticipate that they may suffer adverse selection or other financing 
costs if they attempt to raise capital in the future, they may choose low leverage today to 
preserve their financial flexibility and ability to fund investment from retained earnings or 
low-risk debt.49

Example 16.10
 The Pecking Order of Financing Alternatives
Problem
Axon Industries needs to raise $10 million for a new investment project. If the firm issues one-
year debt, it may have to pay an interest rate of 7%, although Axon’s managers believe that 6% 
would be a fair rate given the level of risk. However, if the firm issues equity, they believe the 
equity may be underpriced by 5%. What is the cost to current shareholders of financing the 
project out of retained earnings, debt, and equity?
Solution
If the firm spends $10 million out of retained earnings, rather than paying that money out to 
shareholders as a dividend, the cost to shareholders is $10 million. Using debt costs the firm 
$10 * (1.07) = $10.7 million in one year, which has a present value based on management’s 
view of the firm’s risk of $10.7 , (1.06) = $10.094 million. Finally, if equity is underpriced by 
5%, then to raise $10 million the firm will need to issue $10.5 million in new equity. Thus, the 
cost to existing shareholders will be $10.5 million. Comparing the three, retained earnings are 
the cheapest source of funds, followed by debt, and finally by equity.

16.9	 Capital Structure: The Bottom Line
Over the past three chapters, we have examined a number of factors that might influence a 
firm’s choice of capital structure. What is the bottom line for a financial manager?
The most important insight regarding capital structure goes back to Modigliani and 
Miller: With perfect capital markets, a firm’s security choice alters the risk of the firm’s 
equity, but it does not change its value or the amount it can raise from outside investors. 
Thus, the optimal capital structure depends on market imperfections, such as taxes, finan-
cial distress costs, agency costs, and asymmetric information.
Of all the different possible imperfections that drive capital structure, the most clear-
cut, and possibly the most significant, is taxes. The interest tax shield allows firms to repay 
investors and avoid the corporate tax. Each dollar of permanent debt financing provides 
the firm with a tax shield worth t* dollars, where t* is the effective tax advantage of debt. 
For firms with consistent taxable income, this benefit of leverage is important to consider.
While firms should use leverage to shield their income from taxes, how much of their 
income should they shield? If leverage is too high, there is an increased risk that a firm may 
not be able to meet its debt obligations and will be forced to default. While the risk of 
default is not itself a problem, financial distress may lead to other consequences that reduce 
the value of the firm. Firms must, therefore, balance the tax benefits of debt against the 
costs of financial distress.
Agency costs and benefits of leverage are also important determinants of capital struc-
ture. Too much debt can motivate managers and equity holders to take excessive risks or 
under-invest in a firm. When free cash flows are high, too little leverage may encourage 
wasteful spending. This effect may be especially important for firms in countries lacking 
strong protections for investors against self-interested managers.50 When agency costs are 
significant, short-term debt may be the most attractive form of external financing.
A firm must also consider the potential signaling and adverse selection consequences 
of its financing choice. Because bankruptcy is costly for managers, increasing leverage can 
signal managers’ confidence in the firm’s ability to meet its debt obligations. When man-
agers have different views regarding the value of securities, managers can benefit current 
shareholders by issuing the most overpriced securities. However, new investors will respond 
to this incentive by lowering the price they are willing to pay for securities that the firm 
issues, leading to negative price reaction when a new issue is announced. This effect is most 
pronounced for equity issues, because the value of equity is most sensitive to the manager’s 
private information. To avoid this “lemons cost,” firms should rely first on retained earn-
ings, then debt, and finally equity. This pecking order of financing alternatives will be most 
important when managers are likely to have a great deal of private information regarding 
the value of the firm.
Finally, it is important to recognize that because actively changing a firm’s capital struc-
ture (for example, by selling or repurchasing shares or bonds) entails transactions costs, 
firms may be unlikely to change their capital structures unless they depart significantly 
from the optimal level. As a result, most changes to a firm’s debt-equity ratio are likely 
to occur passively, as the market value of the firm’s equity fluctuates with changes in the 
firm’s stock price.51

Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
Concept Check	
1.	 Consider the differences in leverage across industries shown in Figure 15.7. To what extent can 
you account for these differences?
	
2.	 What are some reasons firms might depart from their optimal capital structure, at least in the 
short run?
16.1  Default and Bankruptcy in a Perfect Market
	
n	 In the Modigliani-Miller setting, leverage may result in bankruptcy, but bankruptcy alone 
does not reduce the value of the firm. With perfect capital markets, bankruptcy shifts owner-
ship from the equity holders to debt holders without changing the total value available to all 
investors.
16.2  The Costs of Bankruptcy and Financial Distress
	
n	 U.S. firms can file for bankruptcy protection under the provisions of the 1978 Bankruptcy 
Reform Act.
n	 In a Chapter 7 liquidation, a trustee oversees the liquidation of the firm’s assets.
n	 In a Chapter 11 reorganization, management attempts to develop a reorganization plan that 
will improve operations and maximize value to investors. If the firm cannot successfully 
reorganize, it may be liquidated under Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
	
n	 Bankruptcy is a costly process that imposes both direct and indirect costs on a firm and its 
investors.
n	 Direct costs include the costs of experts and advisors such as lawyers, accountants, apprais-
ers, and investment bankers hired by the firm or its creditors during the bankruptcy 
process.
n	 Indirect costs include the loss of customers, suppliers, employees, or receivables during 
bankruptcy. Firms also incur indirect costs when they need to sell assets at distressed prices.
16.3  Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value
	
n	 When securities are fairly priced, the original shareholders of a firm pay the present value of the 
costs associated with bankruptcy and financial distress.
16.4  Optimal Capital Structure: The Trade-Off Theory
	
n	 According to the trade-off theory, the total value of a levered firm equals the value of the firm 
without leverage plus the present value of the tax savings from debt minus the present value of 
financial distress costs:
	
V L = V U + PV(Interest Tax Shield) - PV(Financial Distress Costs)
(16.1)
	
	 Optimal leverage is the level of debt that maximizes V L.
16.5  Exploiting Debt Holders: The Agency Costs of Leverage
	
n	 Agency costs arise when there are conflicts of interest between stakeholders. A highly levered 
firm with risky debt faces the following agency costs:
n	 Asset substitution: Shareholders can gain by making negative-NPV investments or decisions 
that sufficiently increase the firm’s risk.
n	 Debt overhang: Shareholders may be unwilling to finance new, positive-NPV projects.
n	 Cashing out: Shareholders have an incentive to liquidate assets at prices below their market 
values and distribute the proceeds as a dividend.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter.

n	 With debt overhang, equity holders will benefit from new investment only if
	
NPV
I
7 bDD
bEE 
(16.2)
	
n	 When a firm has existing debt, debt overhang leads to a leverage ratchet effect:
n	 Shareholders may have an incentive to increase leverage even if it decreases the value of the 
firm.
n	 Shareholders will not have an incentive to decrease leverage by buying back debt, even if it 
will increase the value of the firm.
16.6  Motivating Managers:  The Agency Benefits of Leverage
	
n	 Leverage has agency benefits and can improve incentives for managers to run a firm more 
­efficiently and effectively due to
n	 Increased ownership concentration: Managers with higher ownership concentration are 
more likely to work hard and less likely to consume corporate perks.
n	 Reduced free cash flow: Firms with less free cash flow are less likely to pursue wasteful 
investments.
n	 Reduced managerial entrenchment and increased commitment: The threat of financial dis-
tress and being fired may commit managers more fully to pursue strategies that improve 
operations.
16.7  Agency Costs and the Trade-Off  Theory
	
n	 We can extend the trade-off theory to include agency costs. The value of a firm, including 
agency costs and benefits, is:
	
V L = V U + PV(Interest Tax Shield) - PV(Financial Distress Costs)
	
-PV(Agency Costs of Debt) + PV(Agency Benefits of Debt)
(16.3)
	
	 Optimal leverage is the level of debt that maximizes V L.
16.8  Asymmetric Information and Capital Structure
	
n	 When managers have better information than investors, there is asymmetric information. 
Given asymmetric information, managers may use leverage as a credible signal to investors of 
the firm’s ability to generate future free cash flow.
	
n	 According to the lemons principle, when managers have private information about the value 
of a firm, investors will discount the price they are willing to pay for a new equity issue due to 
adverse selection.
	
n	 Managers are more likely to sell equity when they know a firm is overvalued. As a result,
n	 The stock price declines when a firm announces an equity issue.
n	 The stock price tends to rise prior to the announcement of an equity issue because managers 
tend to delay equity issues until after good news becomes public.
n	 Firms tend to issue equity when information asymmetries are minimized.
n	 Managers who perceive that the firm’s equity is underpriced will have a preference to fund 
investment using retained earnings, or debt, rather than equity. This result is called the peck­- 
ing order hypothesis.
16.9  Capital Structure: The Bottom Line
	
n	 There are numerous frictions that drive the firm’s optimal capital structure. However, if 
there are substantial transactions costs to changing the firm’s capital structure, most changes 
in the firm’s leverage are likely to occur passively, based on fluctuations in the firm’s stock 
price.

Default and Bankruptcy in a Perfect Market
	
1.	 Gladstone Corporation is about to launch a new product. Depending on the success of the 
new product, Gladstone may have one of four values next year: $147 million, $136 million, 
$91 million, or $82 million. These outcomes are all equally likely, and this risk is diversifiable. 

	
Problems	
621
Gladstone will not make any payouts to investors during the year. Suppose the risk-free interest 
rate is 5% and assume perfect capital markets.
a.	 What is the initial value of Gladstone’s equity without leverage?
Now suppose Gladstone has zero-coupon debt with a $100 million face value due next year.
b.	 What is the initial value of Gladstone’s debt?
c.	 What is the yield-to-maturity of the debt? What is its expected return?
d.	What is the initial value of Gladstone’s equity? What is Gladstone’s total value with leverage?
	
2.	 Baruk Industries has no cash and a debt obligation of $31 million that is now due. The market 
value of Baruk’s assets is $77 million, and the firm has no other liabilities. Assume perfect 
capital markets.
a.	 Suppose Baruk has 11 million shares outstanding. What is Baruk’s current share price?
b.	 How many new shares must Baruk issue to raise the capital needed to pay its debt obligation?
c.	 After repaying the debt, what will Baruk’s share price be?
The Costs of Bankruptcy and Financial Distress
	
3.	 When a firm defaults on its debt, debt holders often receive less than 50% of the amount they 
are owed. Is the difference between the amount debt holders are owed and the amount they 
receive a cost of bankruptcy?
	
4.	 Which type of firm is more likely to experience a loss of customers in the event of financial 
distress:
a.	 Campbell Soup Company or Intuit, Inc. (a maker of accounting software)?
b.	 Allstate Corporation (an insurance company) or Adidas AG (maker of athletic footwear, 
apparel, and sports equipment)?
	
5.	 Which type of asset is more likely to be liquidated for close to its full market value in the event 
of financial distress:
a.	 An office building or a brand name?
b.	 Product inventory or raw materials?
c.	 Patent rights or engineering “know-how”?
	
6.	 Suppose Tefco Corp. has a value of $179 million if it continues to operate, but has outstanding 
debt of $181 million that is now due. If the firm declares bankruptcy, bankruptcy costs will 
equal $11 million, and the remaining $168 million will go to creditors. Instead of declaring 
bankruptcy, management proposes to exchange the firm’s debt for a fraction of its equity in a 
workout. What is the minimum fraction of the firm’s equity that management would need to 
offer to creditors for the workout to be successful?
	
7.	 You have received two job offers. Firm A offers to pay you $79,000 per year for two years. 
Firm B offers to pay you $83,000 for two years. Both jobs are equivalent. Suppose that firm A’s 
contract is certain, but that firm B has a 50% chance of going bankrupt at the end of the year. 
In that event, it will cancel your contract and pay you the lowest amount possible for you not 
to quit. If you did quit, you expect you could find a new job paying $79,000 per year, but you 
would be unemployed for three months while you search for it.
a.	 Say you took the job at firm B. What is the least Firm B can pay you next year in order to 
match what you would earn if you quit?
b.	 Given your answer to part (a), and assuming your cost of capital is 5%, which offer pays you 
a higher present value of your expected wage?
c.	 Based on this example, discuss one reason why firms with a higher risk of bankruptcy may 
need to offer higher wages to attract employees.
Financial Distress Costs and Firm Value
	
8.	 As in Problem 1, Gladstone Corporation is about to launch a new product. Depending on the 
success of the new product, Gladstone may have one of four values next year: $147 million, 

622	
Chapter 16  Financial Distress, Managerial Incentives, and Information
$136 million, $91 million, or $82 million. These outcomes are all equally likely, and this risk is 
diversifiable. Suppose the risk-free interest rate is 5% and that, in the event of default, 26% of 
the value of Gladstone’s assets will be lost to bankruptcy costs. (Ignore all other market imper-
fections, such as taxes.)
a.	 What is the initial value of Gladstone’s equity without leverage?
Now suppose Gladstone has zero-coupon debt with a $100 million face value due next year.
b.	 What is the initial value of Gladstone’s debt?
c.	 What is the yield-to-maturity of the debt? What is its expected return?
d.	What is the initial value of Gladstone’s equity? What is Gladstone’s total value with leverage?
Suppose Gladstone has 10 million shares outstanding and no debt at the start of the year.
e.	 If Gladstone does not issue debt, what is its share price?
f.	 If Gladstone issues debt of $100 million due next year and uses the proceeds to repurchase 
shares, what will its share price be? Why does your answer differ from that in part (e)?
	
9.	 Kohwe Corporation plans to issue equity to raise $40 million to finance a new investment. 
After making the investment, Kohwe expects to earn free cash flows of $9 million each year. 
Kohwe currently has five million shares outstanding and has no other assets or opportunities. 
Suppose the appropriate discount rate for Kohwe’s future free cash flows is 9%, and the only 
capital market imperfections are corporate taxes and financial distress costs.
a.	 What is the NPV of Kohwe’s investment?
b.	 Given these plans, what is Kohwe’s value per share today?
Suppose Kohwe borrows the $40 million instead. The firm will pay interest only on this loan each 
year, and it will maintain an outstanding balance of $40 million on the loan. Suppose that Kohwe’s 
corporate tax rate is 30%, and expected free cash flows are still $9 million each year.
c.	 What is Kohwe’s share price today if the investment is financed with debt?
Now suppose that with leverage, Kohwe’s expected free cash flows will decline to $8 million per year 
due to reduced sales and other financial distress costs. Assume that the appropriate discount rate for 
Kohwe’s future free cash flows is still 9%.
d.	What is Kohwe’s share price today given the financial distress costs of leverage?
	
10.	 You work for a large car manufacturer that is currently financially healthy. Your manager feels that 
the firm should take on more debt because it can thereby reduce the expense of car warranties. 
To quote your manager, “If we go bankrupt, we don’t have to service the warranties. We therefore 
have lower bankruptcy costs than most corporations, so we should use more debt.” Is he right?
Optimal Capital Structure: The Trade-Off Theory
	
11.	 Facebook, Inc. has no debt. As Problem 21 in Chapter 15 makes clear, by issuing debt Facebook 
can generate a very large tax shield potentially worth nearly $2 billion. Given Facebook’s suc-
cess, one would be hard pressed to argue that Facebook’s management are naïve and unaware of 
this huge potential to create value. A more likely explanation is that issuing debt would entail 
other costs. What might these costs be?
	
12.	 Hawar International is a shipping firm with a current share price of $6 and 15 million shares 
outstanding. Suppose Hawar announces plans to lower its corporate taxes by borrowing 
$10 million and repurchasing shares.
a.	 With perfect capital markets, what will the share price be after this announcement?
Suppose that Hawar pays a corporate tax rate of 40%, and that shareholders expect the change 
in debt to be permanent.
b.	 If the only imperfection is corporate taxes, what will the share price be after this 
announcement?
c.	 Suppose the only imperfections are corporate taxes and financial distress costs. If the share 
price rises to $6.25 after this announcement, what is the PV of financial distress costs Hawar 
will incur as the result of this new debt?

623
	
13.	 Your firm is considering issuing one-year debt, and has come up with the following estimates of 
the value of the interest tax shield and the probability of distress for different levels of debt:
	
	 Suppose the firm has a beta of zero, so that the appropriate discount rate for financial distress 
costs is the risk-free rate of 5%. Which level of debt above is optimal if, in the event of distress, 
the firm will have distress costs equal to
a.	 $1 million?
b.	 $5 million?
c.	 $27 million?
	
14.	 Marpor Industries has no debt and expects to generate free cash flows of $17 million each 
year. Marpor believes that if it permanently increases its level of debt to $45 million, the risk 
of financial distress may cause it to lose some customers and receive less favorable terms from 
its suppliers. As a result, Marpor’s expected free cash flows with debt will be only $16 million 
per year. Suppose Marpor’s tax rate is 40%, the risk-free rate is 3%, the expected return of the 
market is 13%, and the beta of Marpor’s free cash flows is 1.3 (with or without leverage).
a.	 Estimate Marpor’s value without leverage.
b.	 Estimate Marpor’s value with the new leverage.
	
15.	 Real estate purchases are often financed with at least 80% debt. Most corporations, however, 
have less than 50% debt financing. Provide an explanation for this difference using the trade-off 
theory.
Exploiting Debt Holders: The Agency Costs of Leverage
	
16.	 On May 14, 2008, General Motors paid a dividend of $0.25 per share. During the same quarter 
GM lost a staggering $15.5 billion or $27.33 per share. Seven months later the company asked for 
billions of dollars of government aid and ultimately declared bankruptcy just over a year later, on 
June 1, 2009. At that point a share of GM was worth only a little more than a dollar.
a.	 If you ignore the possibility of a government bailout, the decision to pay a dividend given 
how close the company was to financial distress is an example of what kind of cost?
*b.	 What would your answer be if GM executives anticipated that there was a possibility of a 
government bailout should the firm be forced to declare bankruptcy?
	
17.	 Dynron Corporation’s primary business is natural gas transportation using its vast gas pipeline 
network. Dynron’s assets currently have a market value of $150 million. The firm is explor-
ing the possibility of raising $50 million by selling part of its pipeline network and investing 
the $50 million in a fiber-optic network to generate revenues by selling high-speed network 
bandwidth. While this new investment is expected to increase profits, it will also substantially 
increase Dynron’s risk. If Dynron is levered, would this investment be more or less attractive to 
equity holders than if Dynron had no debt?
	
18.	 Consider a firm whose only asset is a plot of vacant land, and whose only liability is debt of 
$15 million due in one year. If left vacant, the land will be worth $10.1 million in one year. 
Alternatively, the firm can develop the land at an upfront cost of $19.6 million. The developed 
land will be worth $34.3 million in one year. Suppose the risk-free interest rate is 9.9%, assume 
all cash flows are risk-free, and assume there are no taxes.
a.	 If the firm chooses not to develop the land, what is the value of the firm’s equity today? 
What is the value of the debt today?
b.	 What is the NPV of developing the land?

19.	 Sarvon Systems has a debt-equity ratio of 1.5, an equity beta of 1.9, and a debt beta of 0.23. It 
currently is evaluating the following projects, none of which would change the firm’s volatility 
(amounts in $ million):

below. The risk of each project is diversifiable.
a.	 Which project has the highest expected payoff?
b.	 Suppose Zymase has debt of $35 million due at the time of the project’s payoff. Which

c.	 Suppose Zymase has debt of $130 million due at the time of the project’s payoff. Which 
project has the highest expected payoff for equity holders?
d.	If management chooses the strategy that maximizes the payoff to equity holders, what is the 
expected agency cost to the firm from having $35 million in debt due? What is the expected 
agency cost to the firm from having $130 million in debt due?

mizes the value of its equity? What is the total expected value of the firm?
b.	 Suppose Petron issues equity and buys back its debt, reducing the debt’s face value to $4 
million. If it does so, what strategy will it choose after the transaction? Will the total value of 
the firm increase?
c.	 Suppose you are a debt holder, deciding whether to sell your debt back to the firm. If you expect 
the firm to reduce its debt to $4 million, what price would you demand to sell your debt?
d.	Based on your answer to (c), how much will Petron need to raise from equity holders in

a.	 Which strategy will Petron choose with no debt? Which will it choose with a face value of 
$10 million, $32 million, or $54 million in debt? (Assume management maximizes the 
value of equity, and in the case of ties, will choose the safer strategy.)
b.	 Given your answer to (a), show that the total combined value of Petron’s equity and debt is 
maximized with a face value of $32 million in debt.
c.	 Show that if Petron has $32 million in debt outstanding, shareholders can gain by increasing 
the face value of debt to $54 million, even though this will reduce the total value of the firm.

back debt to reduce the face value of debt to $32 million, even though that will increase the 
total value of the firm.
Motivating Managers: The Agency Benefits of Leverage
	
24.	 You own your own firm, and you want to raise $30 million to fund an expansion. Currently, 
you own 100% of the firm’s equity, and the firm has no debt. To raise the $30 million solely 
through equity, you will need to sell two-thirds of the firm. However, you would prefer to 
maintain at least a 50% equity stake in the firm to retain control.
a.	 If you borrow $20 million, what fraction of the equity will you need to sell to raise the 
remaining $10 million? (Assume perfect capital markets.)
b.	 What is the smallest amount you can borrow to raise the $30 million without giving up 
control? (Assume perfect capital markets.)

30.	 According to the managerial entrenchment theory, managers choose capital structure so as to 
preserve their control of the firm. On the one hand, debt is costly for managers because they 
risk losing control in the event of default. On the other hand, if they do not take advantage of 
the tax shield provided by debt, they risk losing control through a hostile takeover.
Suppose a firm expects to generate free cash flows of $90 million per year, and the discount 
rate for these cash flows is 10%. The firm pays a tax rate of 40%. A raider is poised to take over 
the firm and finance it with $750 million in permanent debt. The raider will generate the same 
free cash flows, and the takeover attempt will be successful if the raider can offer a premium of 
20% over the current value of the firm. According to the managerial entrenchment hypothesis, 
what level of permanent debt will the firm choose?

other applications. IST has no debt and 50 million shares outstanding. The correct price for 
these shares is either $9 or $7 per share. Investors view both possibilities as equally likely, so the 
shares currently trade for $8.
IST must mise $450 million to build a new production facility. Because the firm would 
suffer a large loss of both customers and engineering talent in the event of financial distress, 
managers believe that if IST borrows the $450 million, the present value of financial distress 
costs will exceed any tax benefits by $30 million. At the same time, because investors believe 
that managers know the correct share price, IST faces a lemons problem if it attempts to raise 
the $450 million by issuing equity.
a.	 Suppose that if IST issues equity, the share price will remain $8. To maximize the long-term 
share price of the firm once its true value is known, would managers choose to issue equity 
or borrow the $450 million if

After the initial investment, future capital expenditures are expected to equal depreciation, and 
no further additions to net working capital are anticipated.

WRT’s existing capital structure is composed of $600 million in equity and $250 million in

is 10%, and WR T’s debt is risk free with an interest rate of 4%. The corporate tax rate is 40%, 
and there are no personal taxes.

cash to investors primarily by repurchasing its own stock. During the five fiscal years 
ending June 2004, for example, Microsoft spent an average of $5.4 billion per year 
on share repurchases. Microsoft began paying dividends to investors in 2003, with 
what CFO John Connors called “a starter dividend” of $0.08 per share. Then, on July 
20, 2004, Microsoft stunned financial markets by announcing plans to pay the largest 
single cash dividend payment in history, a one-time dividend of $32 billion, or $3 per 
share, to all shareholders of record on November 17, 2004. Since then Microsoft has 
repurchased over $120 billion in shares, and raised its quarterly dividend 10 times, so 
that by late 2015 its dividend was $0.36 per share, representing a 3% annual dividend 
yield.
When a firm’s investments generate free cash flow, the firm must decide how to 
use that cash. If the firm has new positive-NPV investment opportunities, it can reinvest 
the cash and increase the value of the firm. Many young, rapidly growing firms reinvest 
100% of their cash flows in this way. But mature, profitable firms such as Microsoft 
often find that they generate more cash than they need to fund all of their attractive 
investment opportunities. When a firm has excess cash, it can hold those funds as part 
of its cash reserves or pay the cash out to shareholders. If the firm decides to follow 
the latter approach, it has two choices: It can pay a dividend or it can repurchase shares 
from current owners. These decisions represent the firm’s payout policy.
In this chapter, we show that, as with capital structure, a firm’s pay-
out policy is shaped by market imperfections, such as taxes, agency costs, 
transaction costs, and asymmetric information between managers and inves-
tors. We look at why some firms prefer to pay dividends, whereas others  
rely exclusively on share repurchases. In addition, we explore why some firms build up 
large cash reserves, while others pay out their excess cash.

17.1	 Distributions to Shareholders
Figure 17.1 illustrates the alternative uses of free cash flow.1 The way a firm chooses between 
these alternatives is referred to as its payout policy. We begin our discussion of a firm’s 
payout policy by considering the choice between paying dividends and repurchasing shares. 
In this section, we examine the details of these methods of paying cash to shareholders.
Dividends
A public company’s board of directors determines the amount of the firm’s dividend. The 
board sets the amount per share that will be paid and decides when the payment will occur. 
The date on which the board authorizes the dividend is the declaration date. After the 
board declares the dividend, the firm is legally obligated to make the payment.
The firm will pay the dividend to all shareholders of record on a specific date, set by the 
board, called the record date. Because it takes three business days for shares to be registered, 
only shareholders who purchase the stock at least three days prior to the record date receive 
the dividend. As a result, the date two business days prior to the record date is known as the 
ex-dividend date; anyone who purchases the stock on or after the ex-dividend date will not 
receive the dividend. Finally, on the payable date (or distribution date), which is generally 
about a month after the record date, the firm mails dividend checks to the registered share-
holders. Figure 17.2 shows these dates for Microsoft’s $3.00 dividend.
Most companies that pay dividends pay them at regular, quarterly intervals. Companies 
typically adjust the amount of their dividends gradually, with little variation in the amount 
of the dividend from quarter to quarter. Occasionally, a firm may pay a one-time, special 
dividend that is usually much larger than a regular dividend, as was Microsoft’s $3.00 
dividend in 2004. Figure 17.3 shows the dividends paid by GM from 1983 to 2008. In 
addition to regular dividends, GM paid special dividends in December 1997 and again 
in May 1999 (associated with spin-offs of subsidiaries, discussed further in Section 17.7).
1Strictly speaking, Figure 17.1 is for an all-equity firm. For a levered firm, free cash flow would also be 
used to support interest and principal payments to debt holders.

Uses of Free Cash Flow
A firm can retain its free 
cash flow, either ­investing or 
accumulating it, or pay out 
its free cash flow through 
a dividend or share repur-
chase. The choice between 
holding cash, repurchasing 
shares, or paying ­dividends 
is determined by the firm’s 
payout policy.

	
17.1  Distributions to Shareholders	
631
Notice that GM split its stock in March 1989 so that each owner of one share received 
a second share. This kind of transaction is called a 2-for-1 stock split. More generally, in 
a stock split or stock dividend, the company issues additional shares rather than cash to 
its shareholders. In the case of GM’s stock split, the number of shares doubled, but the 
dividend per share was cut in half (from $1.50 per share to $0.75 per share), so that the 
total amount GM paid out as a dividend was the same just before and just after the split. 
(We discuss stock splits and stock dividends further in Section 17.7.) While GM raised its 
dividends throughout the 1980s, it cut its dividend during the recession in the early 1990s. 
GM raised its dividends again in the late 1990s, but was forced to cut its dividend again 
in early 2006 and suspend them altogether in July 2008 in response to financial difficul-
ties. One year later GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and its existing shareholders were

Until suspending its 
dividends in July 2008, 
GM had paid a regular 
dividend each quarter 
since 1983. GM paid addi-
tional special dividends in 
December 1997 and May 
1999, and had a 2-for-1 
stock split in March 1989. 
GM ­ultimately filed for 
bankruptcy in June of 
2009 wiping out all exist-
ing equity holders. GM

did not reintroduce a dividend payment until 2014.
Dividends are a cash outflow for the firm. From an accounting perspective, dividends 
generally reduce the firm’s current (or accumulated) retained earnings. In some cases, divi-
dends are attributed to other accounting sources, such as paid-in capital or the liquidation 
of assets. In this case, the dividend is known as a return of capital or a liquidating 
­dividend. While the source of the funds makes little difference to a firm or to investors 
directly, there is a difference in tax treatment: A return of capital is taxed as a capital gain 
rather than as a dividend for the investor.2
Share Repurchases
An alternative way to pay cash to investors is through a share repurchase or buyback. In this 
kind of transaction, the firm uses cash to buy shares of its own outstanding stock. These shares 
are generally held in the corporate treasury, and they can be resold if the company needs to raise 
money in the future. We now examine three possible transaction types for a share repurchase.
Open Market Repurchase.  An open market repurchase is the most common way that 
firms repurchase shares. A firm announces its intention to buy its own shares in the open 
market, and then proceeds to do so over time like any other investor. The firm may take 
a year or more to buy the shares, and it is not obligated to repurchase the full amount it 
originally stated. Also, the firm must not buy its shares in a way that might appear to 
manipulate the price. For example, SEC guidelines recommend that the firm not pur-
chase more than 25% of the average daily trading volume in its shares on a single day, nor 
make purchases at the market open or within 30 minutes of the close of trade.3
While open market share repurchases represent about 95% of all repurchase transac-
tions,4 other methods are available to a firm that wants to buy back its stock. These meth-
ods are used when a firm wishes to repurchase a substantial portion of its shares, often as 
part of a recapitalization.
Tender Offer.  A firm can repurchase shares through a tender offer in which it offers to buy 
shares at a prespecified price during a short time period—generally within 20 days. The price 
is usually set at a substantial premium (10%–20% is typical) to the current market price. The 
offer often depends on shareholders tendering a sufficient number of shares. If shareholders 
do not tender enough shares, the firm may cancel the offer and no buyback occurs.
A related method is the Dutch auction share repurchase, in which the firm lists differ-
ent prices at which it is prepared to buy shares, and shareholders in turn indicate how many 
shares they are willing to sell at each price. The firm then pays the lowest price at which it 
can buy back its desired number of shares.
Targeted Repurchase.  A firm may also purchase shares directly from a major shareholder 
in a targeted repurchase. In this case the purchase price is negotiated directly with the 
seller. A targeted repurchase may occur if a major shareholder desires to sell a large num-
ber of shares but the market for the shares is not sufficiently liquid to sustain such a large 
2There is also a difference in the accounting treatment. A cash dividend reduces the cash and retained 
earnings shown on the balance sheet, whereas a return of capital reduces paid-in capital. This accounting 
difference has no direct economic consequence, however.
3SEC Rule 10b-18, introduced in 1983, defines guidelines for open market share repurchases.

sale without severely affecting the price. Under these circumstances, the shareholder may 
be willing to sell shares back to the firm at a discount to the current market price. Alterna-
tively, if a major shareholder is threatening to take over the firm and remove its manage-
ment, the firm may decide to eliminate the threat by buying out the shareholder—often at 
a large premium over the current market price. This type of transaction is called greenmail.

17.2	 Comparison of Dividends and Share Repurchases
If a corporation decides to pay cash to shareholders, it can do so through either dividend 
payments or share repurchases. How do firms choose between these alternatives? In this 
section, we show that in the perfect capital markets setting of Modigliani and Miller, the 
method of payment does not matter.
Consider the case of Genron Corporation, a hypothetical firm. Genron has $20 million 
in excess cash and no debt. The firm expects to generate additional free cash flows of $48 
million per year in subsequent years. If Genron’s unlevered cost of capital is 12%, then the 
enterprise value of its ongoing operations is
Enterprise Value = PV(Future FCF) = $48 million
12%
= $400 million
Including the cash, Genron’s total market value is $420 million.
Genron’s board is meeting to decide how to pay out its $20 million in excess cash to 
shareholders. Some board members have advocated using the $20 million to pay a $2 cash 
dividend for each of Genron’s 10 million outstanding shares. Others have suggested repur-
chasing shares instead of paying a dividend. Still others have proposed that Genron raise 
additional cash and pay an even larger dividend today, in anticipation of the high future 
free cash flows it expects to receive. Will the amount of the current dividend affect Gen-
ron’s share price? Which policy would shareholders prefer?
Let’s analyze the consequences of each of these three alternative policies and compare 
them in a setting of perfect capital markets.
Alternative Policy 1: Pay Dividend with Excess Cash
Suppose the board opts for the first alternative and uses all excess cash to pay a dividend. 
With 10 million shares outstanding, Genron will be able to pay a $2 dividend immedi-
ately. Because the firm expects to generate future free cash flows of $48 million per year, it 
anticipates paying a dividend of $4.80 per share each year thereafter. The board declares the 
dividend and sets the record date as December 14, so that the ex-dividend date is December 
12. Let’s compute Genron’s share price just before and after the stock goes ex-dividend.
The fair price for the shares is the present value of the expected dividends given Gen-
ron’s equity cost of capital. Because Genron has no debt, its equity cost of capital equals its 
unlevered cost of capital of 12%. Just before the ex-dividend date, the stock is said to trade 
cum-dividend (“with the dividend”) because anyone who buys the stock will be entitled to 
the dividend. In this case,
Pcum = Current Dividend + PV(Future Dividends) = 2 + 4.80
0.12 = 2 + 40 = $42

634	
Chapter 17  Payout Policy
After the stock goes ex-dividend, new buyers will not receive the current dividend. At 
this point the share price will reflect only the dividends in subsequent years:
Pex = PV (Future Dividends) = 4.80
0.12 = $40
The share price will drop on the ex-dividend date, December 12. The amount of the price 
drop is equal to the amount of the current dividend, $2. We can also determine this change 
in the share price using a simple market value balance sheet (values in millions of dollars):

As the market value balance sheet shows, the share price falls when a dividend is paid 
because the reduction in cash decreases the market value of the firm’s assets. Although the 
stock price falls, holders of Genron stock do not incur a loss overall. Before the dividend, 
their stock was worth $42. After the dividend, their stock is worth $40 and they hold $2 in 
cash from the dividend, for a total value of $42.5
The fact that the stock price falls by the amount of the dividend also follows from the 
assumption that no opportunity for arbitrage exists. If it fell by less than the dividend, an 
investor could earn a profit by buying the stock just before it goes ex-dividend and selling it 
just after, as the dividend would more than cover the capital loss on the stock. Similarly, if 
the stock price fell by more than the dividend, an investor could profit by selling the stock 
just before it goes ex-dividend and buying it just after. Therefore, no arbitrage implies
In a perfect capital market, when a dividend is paid, the share price drops by the amount 
of the dividend when the stock begins to trade ex-dividend.
Alternative Policy 2: Share Repurchase (No Dividend)
Suppose that Genron does not pay a dividend this year, but instead uses the $20 million to 
repurchase its shares on the open market. How will the repurchase affect the share price?
With an initial share price of $42, Genron will repurchase $20 million , $42 per share
=0.476 million shares, leaving only 10 - 0.476 = 9.524 million shares outstanding. 
Once again, we can use Genron’s market value balance sheet to analyze this transaction:
5For simplicity, we have ignored the short delay between the ex-dividend date and the payable date of the 
dividend. In reality, the shareholders do not receive the dividend immediately, but rather the promise to 
receive it within several weeks. The stock price adjusts by the present value of this promise, which is effec-
tively equal to the amount of the dividend unless interest rates are extremely high.

635
In this case, the market value of Genron’s assets falls when the company pays out cash, 
but the number of shares outstanding also falls. The two changes offset each other, so the 
share price remains the same.
Genron’s Future Dividends.  We can also see why the share price does not fall after the 
share repurchase by considering the effect on Genron’s future dividends. In future years, 
Genron expects to have $48 million in free cash flow, which can be used to pay a dividend 
of $48 million , 9.524 million shares = $5.04 per share each year. Thus, with a share 
repurchase, Genron’s share price today is
Prep = 5.04
0.12 = $42
In other words, by not paying a dividend today and repurchasing shares instead, Genron is 
able to raise its dividends per share in the future. The increase in future dividends compen-
sates shareholders for the dividend they give up today. This example illustrates the follow-
ing general conclusion about share repurchases:
In perfect capital markets, an open market share repurchase has no effect on the stock price, 
and the stock price is the same as the cum-dividend price if a dividend were paid instead.
Investor Preferences.  Would an investor prefer that Genron issue a dividend or repur-
chase its stock? Both policies lead to the same initial share price of $42. But is there a 
difference in shareholder value after the transaction? Consider an investor who currently 
holds 2000 shares of Genron stock. Assuming the investor does not trade the stock, the 
investor’s holdings after a dividend or share repurchase are as follows:
Dividend
Repurchase
$40 * 2000 = $80,000 stock
$42 * 2000 = $84,000 stock
$ 2 * 2000 = $ 4,000 cash
In either case, the value of the investor’s portfolio is $84,000 immediately after the trans-
action. The only difference is the distribution between cash and stock holdings. Thus, it 
might seem the investor would prefer one approach or the other based on whether she 
needs the cash.
But if Genron repurchases shares and the investor wants cash, she can raise cash by 
selling shares. For example, she can sell $4000 , $42 per share = 95 shares to raise about 
$4000 in cash. She will then hold 1905 shares, or 1905 * $42  $80,000 in stock. Thus, 
in the case of a share repurchase, by selling shares an investor can create a homemade 
dividend.
Similarly, if Genron pays a dividend and the investor does not want the cash, she can use 
the $4000 proceeds of the dividend to purchase 100 additional shares at the ex-dividend 
share price of $40 per share. As a result she will hold 2100 shares, worth 2100 * $40 =
$84,000.6 We summarize these two cases below:
6In fact, many firms allow investors to register for a dividend reinvestment program, or DRIP, which 
automatically reinvests any dividends into new shares of the stock.
Dividend + Buy 100 shares
Repurchase + Sell 95 shares
$40 * 2100 = $84,000 stock
$42 * 1905  $80,000 stock
$42 * 95  $ 4,000 cash

Chapter 17  Payout Policy
Example 17.1
Homemade Dividends
Problem
Suppose Genron does not adopt the third alternative policy, and instead pays a $2 dividend per 
share today. Show how an investor holding 2000 shares could create a homemade dividend of 
$4.50 per share * 2000 shares = $9000 per year on her own.
By selling shares or reinvesting dividends, the investor can create any combination of 
cash and stock desired. As a result, the investor is indifferent between the various payout 
methods the firm might employ:
In perfect capital markets, investors are indifferent between the firm distributing funds 
via dividends or share repurchases. By reinvesting dividends or selling shares, they can 
replicate either payout method on their own.
Alternative Policy 3: High Dividend (Equity Issue)
Let’s look at a third possibility for Genron. Suppose the board wishes to pay an even larger 
dividend than $2 per share right now. Is that possible and, if so, will the higher dividend 
make shareholders better off?
Genron plans to pay $48 million in dividends starting next year. Suppose the firm wants 
to start paying that amount today. Because it has only $20 million in cash today, Genron 
needs an additional $28 million to pay the larger dividend now. It could raise cash by scal-
ing back its investments. But if the investments have positive NPV, reducing them would 
lower firm value. An alternative way to raise more cash is to borrow money or sell new 
shares. Let’s consider an equity issue. Given a current share price of $42, Genron could 
raise $28 million by selling $28 million , $42 per share = 0.67 million shares. Because 
this equity issue will increase Genron’s total number of shares outstanding to 10.67 mil-
lion, the amount of the dividend per share each year will be
$48 million
10.67 million shares = $4.50 per share
Under this new policy, Genron’s cum-dividend share price is
Pcum = 4.50 + 4.50
0.12 = 4.50 + 37.50 = $42
As in the previous examples, the initial share value is unchanged by this policy, and increas-
ing the dividend has no benefit to shareholders.
Repurchases and the Supply of Shares
There is a misconception that when a firm repurchases its 
own shares, the price rises due to the decrease in the supply 
of shares outstanding. This intuition follows naturally from 
the standard supply and demand analysis taught in micro-
economics. Why does that analysis not apply here?
When a firm repurchases its own shares, two things 
happen. First, the supply of shares is reduced. At the same 
time, however, the value of the firm’s assets declines when 
it spends its cash to buy the shares. If the firm repurchases 
its shares at their market price, these two effects offset each 
other, leaving the share price unchanged.
This result is similar to the dilution fallacy discussed in 
Chapter 14: When a firm issues shares at their market price, 
the share price does not fall due to the increase in supply. The 
increase in supply is offset by the increase in the firm’s assets 
that results from the cash it receives from the issuance.

Modigliani-Miller and Dividend Policy Irrelevance
In our analysis we considered three possible dividend policies for the firm this year: (1) pay 
out all cash as a dividend, (2) pay no dividend and use the cash instead to repurchase shares, 
or (3) issue equity to finance a larger dividend. These policies are illustrated in Table 17.1.
Table 17.1 shows an important trade-off: If Genron pays a higher current dividend per 
share, it will pay lower future dividends per share. For example, if the firm raises the current 
dividend by issuing equity, it will have more shares and therefore smaller free cash flows 
per share to pay dividends in the future. If the firm lowers the current dividend and repur-
chases its shares, it will have fewer shares in the future, so it will be able to pay a higher 
dividend per share. The net effect of this trade-off is to leave the total present value of all 
future dividends, and hence the current share price, unchanged.
The logic of this section matches that in our discussion of capital structure in Chap-
ter 14. There we explained that in perfect capital markets, buying and selling equity and 
debt are zero-NPV transactions that do not affect firm value. Moreover, any choice of 
leverage by a firm could be replicated by investors using homemade leverage. As a result, 
the firm’s choice of capital structure is irrelevant.
Here we have established the same principle for a firm’s choice of a dividend. Regard-
less of the amount of cash the firm has on hand, it can pay a smaller dividend (and use the 
remaining cash to repurchase shares) or a larger dividend (by selling equity to raise cash). 
Because buying or selling shares is a zero-NPV transaction, such transactions have no effect 
on the initial share price. Furthermore, shareholders can create a homemade dividend of 
any size by buying or selling shares themselves.
Modigliani and Miller developed this idea in another influential paper published in 
1961.7 As with their result on capital structure, it went against the conventional wisdom 
7See M. Modigliani and M. Miller, “Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares,” Journal of Business 
34 (1961): 411–433. See also J. B. Williams, The Theory of Investment Value (Harvard University Press, 1938).
Solution
If Genron pays a $2 dividend, the investor receives $4000 in cash and holds the rest in stock. 
To receive $9000 in total today, she can raise an additional $5000 by selling 125 shares at $40 
per share just after the dividend is paid. In future years, Genron will pay a dividend of $4.80 per 
share. Because she will own 2000 - 125 = 1875 shares,  the investor will receive dividends of 
1875 * $4.80 = $9000 per year from then on.

that dividend policy could change a firm’s value and make its shareholders better off even 
absent market imperfections. We state here their important proposition:
MM Dividend Irrelevance: In perfect capital markets, holding fixed the investment policy 
of a firm, the firm’s choice of dividend policy is irrelevant and does not affect the initial share  
price.
Dividend Policy with Perfect Capital Markets
The examples in this section illustrate the idea that by using share repurchases or equity 
issues a firm can easily alter its dividend payments. Because these transactions do not alter 
the value of the firm, neither does dividend policy.
This result may at first seem to contradict the idea that the price of a share should equal 
the present value of its future dividends. As our examples have shown, however, a firm’s 
choice of dividend today affects the dividends it can afford to pay in the future in an offset-
ting fashion. Thus, while dividends do determine share prices, a firm’s choice of dividend 
policy does not.
As Modigliani and Miller make clear, the value of a firm ultimately derives from its 
underlying free cash flow. A firm’s free cash flow determines the level of payouts that it can 
make to its investors. In a perfect capital market, whether these payouts are made through 
dividends or share repurchases does not matter. Of course, in reality capital markets are 
not perfect. As with capital structure, it is the imperfections in capital markets that should 
determine the firm’s dividend and payout policy.

The Bird in the Hand Fallacy
“A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.”
The bird in the hand hypothesis states that firms choos-
ing to pay higher current dividends will enjoy higher stock 
prices because shareholders prefer current dividends to future 
ones (with the same present value). According to this view, 
alternative policy 3 would lead to the highest share price for 
Genron.
Modigliani and Miller’s response to this view is that 
with perfect capital markets, shareholders can generate an 
equiv­alent homemade dividend at any time by selling 
shares. Thus, the dividend choice of the firm should not 
matter.*
*The bird in the hand hypothesis is proposed in early studies of divi-
dend policy. See M. Gordon, “Optimal Investment and Financing 
Policy,” Journal of Finance 18 (1963): 264–272; and J. Lintner, “Divi-
dends, Earnings, Leverage, Stock Prices and the Supply of Capital to 
Corporations,” Review of Economics and Statistics 44 (1962): 243–269.

17.3  The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends	
639
Taxes on Dividends and Capital Gains
Shareholders typically must pay taxes on the dividends they receive. They must also pay 
capital gains taxes when they sell their shares. Table 17.2 shows the history of U.S. tax 
rates applied to dividends and long-term capital gains for investors in the highest tax 
bracket.
Do taxes affect investors’ preferences for dividends versus share repurchases? When a 
firm pays a dividend, shareholders are taxed according to the dividend tax rate. If the firm 
repurchases shares instead, and shareholders sell shares to create a homemade dividend, the 
homemade dividend will be taxed according to the capital gains tax rate. If dividends are 
taxed at a higher rate than capital gains, which was true prior to 2003, shareholders will 
prefer share repurchases to dividends.8 And although recent tax code changes equalized the 
tax rates on dividends and capital gains, because capital gains taxes are deferred until the 
asset is sold, there is still a tax advantage for share repurchases over dividends for long-term 
investors.
A higher tax rate on dividends also makes it undesirable for a firm to raise funds to pay a 
dividend. Absent taxes and issuance costs, if a firm raises money by issuing shares and then 
gives that money back to shareholders as a dividend, shareholders are no better or worse 
off—they get back the money they put in. When dividends are taxed at a higher rate than 
capital gains, however, this transaction hurts shareholders because they will receive less 
than their initial investment.
8Some countries tax dividends at a lower rate than capital gains. The same holds currently in the U.S. for 
stocks held between 61 days and one year.

dividends if the assets are held for less than 61 days. Because the capital gains tax is not paid until the asset is 
sold, for assets held for longer than one year the effective capital gains tax rate is equal to the present value of 
the rate shown, when discounted by the after-tax risk-free interest rate for the ­additional number of years the

Chapter 17  Payout Policy
Optimal Dividend Policy with Taxes
When the tax rate on dividends exceeds the tax rate on capital gains, shareholders will pay 
lower taxes if a firm uses share repurchases for all payouts rather than dividends. This tax 
savings will increase the value of a firm that uses share repurchases rather than dividends. 
We can also express the tax savings in terms of a firm’s equity cost of capital. Firms that use 
dividends will have to pay a higher pre-tax return to offer their investors the same after-tax 
return as firms that use share repurchases.9 As a result, the optimal dividend policy when 
the dividend tax rate exceeds the capital gain tax rate is to pay no dividends at all.
While firms do still pay dividends, substantial evidence shows that many firms have rec-
ognized their tax disadvantage. For example, prior to 1980, a majority of firms used divi-
dends exclusively to distribute cash to shareholders (see Figure 17.4 ). But the fraction of 
dividend-paying firms declined dramatically from 1978–2002, falling by more than half. 
9For an extension of the CAPM that includes investor taxes, see M. Brennan, “Taxes, Market Valuation 
and Corporation Financial Policy,” National Tax Journal 23 (1970): 417–427.
Example 17.2
Issuing Equity to Pay a Dividend
Problem
Suppose a firm raises $10 million from shareholders and uses this cash to pay them $10 million 
in dividends. If the dividend is taxed at a 40% rate, and if capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate, 
how much will shareholders receive after taxes?
Solution
Shareholders will owe 40% of $10 million, or $4 million in dividend taxes. Because the value 
of the firm will fall when the dividend is paid, shareholders’ capital gain on the stock will be 
$10 million less when they sell, lowering their capital gains taxes by 15% of $10 million or $1.5 
million. Thus, in total, shareholders will pay $4 million - $1.5 million = $2.5 million in taxes, 
and they will receive back only $7.5 million of their $10 million investment.

The Changing Composition of Shareholder Payouts
This figure shows the

as a percentage of total

By the late 1990s share repur-

of corporate payouts for U.S. 
industrial firms. Note, ­however, 
the declines in repurchases 
during ­economic downturns.
Source: Compustat data for U.S. firms, 
excluding financial firms and utilities.
The trend away from dividends has noticeably reversed, however, since the 2003 reduction 
in the dividend tax rate.10
Figure 17.4 does not tell the full story of the shift in corporate payout policy, however. 
We see a more dramatic trend if we compare the dollar amounts of both forms of corporate 
payouts. Figure 17.5 shows the relative importance of share repurchases as a proportion of 
total payouts to shareholders. While dividends accounted for more than 80% of corporate 
payouts until the early 1980s, the importance of share repurchases grew dramatically in the 
mid-1980s after the SEC gave guidelines that provided firms a “safe harbor” from accusa-
tions of stock-price manipulation.11 Repurchase activity slowed during the 1990–1991 
recession, but by the end of the 1990s repurchases exceeded the value of dividend pay-
ments for U.S. industrial firms.12
While this evidence is indicative of the growing importance of share repurchases as a part 
of firms’ payout policies, it also shows that dividends still remain a key form of payouts to 
shareholders. The fact that firms continue to issue dividends despite their tax disadvantage 
is often referred to as the dividend puzzle.13 In the next section, we consider some factors 
that may mitigate this tax disadvantage. In Section 17.6, we examine alternative motivations 
for using dividends based on asymmetric information.

17.4	 Dividend Capture and Tax Clienteles
While many investors have a tax preference for share repurchases rather than divi-
dends, the strength of that preference depends on the difference between the dividend 
tax rate and the capital gains tax rate that they face. Tax rates vary by income, juris-
diction, investment horizon, and whether the stock is held in a retirement account. 
Because of these differences, firms may attract different groups of investors depending 
on their dividend policy. In this section, we look in detail at the tax consequences of 
dividends as well as investor strategies that may reduce the impact of dividend taxes on  
firm value.
The Effective Dividend Tax Rate
To compare investor preferences, we must quantify the combined effects of dividend and 
capital gains taxes to determine an effective dividend tax rate for an investor. For simplic-
ity, consider an investor who buys a stock today just before it goes ex-dividend, and sells 
the stock just after.14 By doing so, the investor will qualify for, and capture, the dividend. 
If the stock pays a dividend of amount Div, and the investor’s dividend tax rate is td, then 
her after-tax cash flow from the dividend is Div(1 - td).
In addition, because the price just before the stock goes ex-dividend, Pcum, exceeds the 
price just after, Pex, the investor will expect to incur a capital loss on her trade. If her tax 
rate on capital gains is tg, her after-tax loss is (Pcum - Pex)(1 - tg).
Therefore, the investor earns a profit by trading to capture the dividend if the after-
tax dividend exceeds the after-tax capital loss. Conversely, if the after-tax capital loss 
exceeds the after-tax dividend, the investor benefits by selling the stock just before 
it goes ex-dividend and buying it afterward, thereby avoiding the dividend. In other 
words, there is an arbitrage opportunity unless the price drop and dividend are equal 
after taxes:
	
(Pcum - Pex)(1 - t g) = Div(1 - t d)
(17.1)
We can write Eq. 17.1 in terms of the share price drop as
	
Pcum - Pex = Div * ¢1 - t d
1 - t g
≤= Div * ¢1 -
t d - t g
1 - t g
≤= Div * (1 - t* d ) (17.2)
where we define t*d to be the effective dividend tax rate:
	
t*d = ¢
t d - tg
1 - tg
≤
(17.3)
14We could equally well consider a long-term investor deciding between selling the stock just before or 
just after the ex-dividend date. The analysis would be identical (although the applicable tax rates will 
depend on the holding period).

	
17.4  Dividend Capture and Tax Clienteles	
643
The effective dividend tax rate t*d  measures the additional tax paid by the investor per dol-
lar of after-tax capital gains income that is instead received as a dividend.15
15For identification and empirical support for Eq. 17.2 and 17.3, see E. Elton and M. Gruber, “Marginal 
Stockholder Tax Rates and the Clientele Effect,” Review of Economics and Statistics 52 (1970): 68–74. For 
investor reaction to major tax code changes see J. Koski, “A Microstructure Analysis of Ex-Dividend Stock 
Price Behavior Before and After the 1984 and 1986 Tax Reform Acts,” Journal of Business 69 (1996): 
313–338.
Example 17.3
Changes in the Effective Dividend Tax Rate
Problem
Consider an individual investor in the highest U.S. tax bracket who plans to hold a stock for 
more than one year. What was the effective dividend tax rate for this investor in 2002? How did 
the effective dividend tax rate change in 2003? (Ignore state taxes.)
Solution
From Table 17.2 , in 2002 we have td = 39% and tg = 20%. Thus,
t*d = 0.39 - 0.20
1 - 0.20
= 23.75%
This indicates a significant tax disadvantage of dividends; each $1 of dividends is worth only 
$0.7625 in capital gains. However, after the 2003 tax cut, td = 15%, tg = 15%, and
t*d = 0.15 - 0.15
1 - 0.15
= 0%
Therefore, the 2003 tax cut eliminated the tax disadvantage of dividends for a one-year investor.
Tax Differences Across Investors
The effective dividend tax rate t*d for an investor depends on the tax rates the investor faces 
on dividends and capital gains. These rates differ across investors for a variety of reasons.
Income Level.  Investors with different levels of income fall into different tax brackets 
and face different tax rates.
Investment Horizon.  Capital gains on stocks held one year or less, and dividends on 
stocks held for less than 61 days, are taxed at higher ordinary income tax rates. Long-
term investors can defer the payment of capital gains taxes (lowering their effective capi-
tal gains tax rate even further). Investors who plan to bequeath stocks to their heirs may 
avoid the capital gains tax altogether.
Tax Jurisdiction.  U.S. investors are subject to state taxes that differ by state. For exam-
ple, New Hampshire imposes a 5% tax on income from interest and dividends, but no 
tax on capital gains. Foreign investors in U.S. stocks are subject to 30% withholding for 
dividends they receive (unless that rate is reduced by a tax treaty with their home coun-
try). There is no similar withholding for capital gains.
Type of Investor or Investment Account.  Stocks held by individual investors in a retire-
ment account are not subject to taxes on dividends or capital gains.16 Similarly, 
stocks held through pension funds or nonprofit endowment funds are not subject to 
16While taxes (or penalties) may be owed when the money is withdrawn from the retirement account, 
these taxes do not depend on whether the money came from dividends or capital gains.

644	
Chapter 17  Payout Policy
dividend or capital gains taxes. Corporations that hold stocks are able to exclude 
70% of dividends they receive from corporate taxes, but are unable to exclude capital 
gains.17
To illustrate, consider four different investors: (1) a “buy and hold” investor who holds 
the stock in a taxable account and plans to transfer the stock to her heirs, (2) an investor 
who holds the stock in a taxable account but plans to sell it after one year, (3) a pension 
fund, and (4) a corporation. Under the current maximum U.S. federal tax rates, the effec-
tive dividend tax rate for each would be as follows:
	
1.	 Buy and hold individual investor: td = 20%, tg = 0, and t*d = 20%
	
2.	 One-year individual investor: td = 20%, tg = 20%, and t*d = 0
	
3.	 Pension fund: td = 0, tg = 0, and t*d = 0
	
4.	 Corporation: Given a corporate tax rate of 35%, td = (1 - 70%) * 35% = 10.5%,
 tg = 35%, and t*d = -38%
As a result of their different tax rates, these investors have varying preferences regard-
ing dividends. Long-term investors are more heavily taxed on dividends, so they would 
prefer share repurchases to dividend payments. One-year investors, pension funds, and 
other non-taxed investors have no tax preference for share repurchases over dividends; they 
would prefer a payout policy that most closely matches their cash needs. For example, a 
non-taxed investor who desires current income would prefer high dividends so as to avoid 
the brokerage fees and other transaction costs of selling the stock.
Finally, the negative effective dividend tax rate for corporations implies that corpora-
tions enjoy a tax advantage associated with dividends. For this reason, a corporation that 
chooses to invest its cash will prefer to hold stocks with high dividend yields. Table 17.3 
summarizes the different preferences of investor groups.
Clientele Effects
Differences in tax preferences across investor groups create clientele effects, in which the div-
idend policy of a firm is optimized for the tax preference of its investor clientele. Individuals 
in the highest tax brackets have a preference for stocks that pay no or low dividends, whereas 
tax-free investors and corporations have a preference for stocks with high dividends. In this 
case, a firm’s dividend policy is optimized for the tax preference of its investor clientele.
17Corporations can exclude 80% if they own more than 20% of the shares of the firm paying the 
dividend.

John Connors was Senior Vice Presi-
dent and Chief Financial Officer of 
Microsoft. He retired in 2005 and is 
now a partner at Ignition Partners, a 
Seattle venture capital firm.
QUESTION: Microsoft declared a dividend 
for the first time in 2003. What goes into 
the decision of a company to initiate a 
dividend?
ANSWER: Microsoft was in a unique 
position. The company had never paid 
a dividend and was facing shareholder 
pressure to do something with its $60 
billion cash buildup. The company 
considered five key questions in devel-
oping its distribution strategy:
	
1.	 Can the company sustain payment of a cash divi-
dend in perpetuity and increase the dividend over 
time? Microsoft was confident it could meet that 
commitment and raise the dividend in the future.
	
2.	 Is a cash dividend a better return to stockholders 
than a stock buyback program? These are capital 
structure decisions: Do we want to reduce our 
shares outstanding? Is our stock attractively priced 
for a buyback, or do we want to distribute the cash 
as a dividend? Microsoft had plenty of capacity to 
issue a dividend and continue a buyback program.
	
3.	 What is the tax effect of a cash dividend versus 
a buyback to the corporation and to sharehold-
ers? From a tax perspective to shareholders, it was 
largely a neutral decision in Microsoft’s case.
	
4.	 What is the psychological impact on investors, and 
how does it fit the story of the stock for investors? 
This is a more qualitative factor. A regular ongoing 
dividend put Microsoft on a path to becoming an 
attractive investment for income investors.
	
5.	 What are the public relations implications of a div-
idend program? Investors don’t look to Microsoft 
to hold cash but to be a leader in software develop-
ment and provide equity growth. So they viewed 
the dividend program favorably.
QUESTION: How does a company decide whether to increase 
its dividend, have a special dividend, or repurchase its stock to 
return capital to investors?
ANSWER: The decision to increase the 
dividend is a function of cash flow 
projections. Are you confident that you 
have adequate cash flow to sustain this 
and future increases? Once you increase 
the dividend, investors expect future 
increases as well. Some companies 
establish explicit criteria for dividend 
increases. In my experience as a CFO, 
the analytic framework involves a set 
of relative comparables. What are the 
dividend payouts and dividend yields 
of the market in general and of your 
peer group, and where are we relative to 
them? We talk to significant investors 
and consider what is best for increasing 
shareholder value long-term.
A special dividend is a very efficient 
form of cash distribution that generally involves a nonre-
curring situation, such as the sale of a business division or a 
cash award from a legal situation. Also, companies without 
a comprehensive distribution strategy use special dividends 
to reduce large cash accumulations. For Microsoft, the 
2004 special dividend and announcement of the stock divi-
dend and stock buyback program resolved the issue of what 
to do with all the cash and clarified our direction going 
forward.
QUESTION: What other factors go into dividend decisions?
ANSWER: Powerful finance and accounting tools help 
us to make better and broader business decisions. But 
these decisions involve as much psychology and market 
thinking as math. You have to consider non-quantifiable 
factors such as the psychology of investors. Not long ago, 
everyone wanted growth stocks; no one wanted dividend-
paying stocks. Now dividend stocks are in vogue. You 
must also take into account your industry and what the 
competition is doing. In many tech companies, employee 
ownership in the form of options programs represents a 
fairly significant percentage of fully diluted shares. Divi-
dend distributions reduce the price of the stock and hence 
the value of options.
At the end of the day, you want to be sure that your 
cash distribution strategy helps your overall story with 
investors.

John Connors

Chapter 17  Payout Policy
Evidence supports the existence of tax clienteles. For example, Professors Franklin Allen 
and Roni Michaely18 report that in 1996 individual investors held 54% of all stocks by 
market value, yet received only 35% of all dividends paid, indicating that individuals tend 
to hold stocks with low dividend yields. Of course, the fact that high-tax investors receive 
any dividends at all implies that the clienteles are not perfect—dividend taxes are not the 
only determinants of investors’ portfolios.
Another clientele strategy is a dynamic clientele effect, also called the dividend-capture 
theory.19 This theory states that absent transaction costs, investors can trade shares at the 
time of the dividend so that non-taxed investors receive the dividend. That is, non-taxed 
investors need not hold the high-dividend-paying stocks all the time; it is necessary only 
that they hold them when the dividend is actually paid.
An implication of this theory is that we should see large volumes of trade in a stock 
around the ex-dividend day, as high-tax investors sell and low-tax investors buy the stock 
in anticipation of the dividend, and then reverse those trades just after the ex-dividend 
date. Consider Figure 17.6, which illustrates the price and volume for the stock of Value 
Line, Inc., during 2004. On April 23, Value Line announced it would use its accumulated 
cash to pay a special dividend of $17.50 per share, with an ex-dividend date of May 20. 
Note the substantial increase in the volume of trade around the time of the special divi-
dend. The volume of trade in the month following the special dividend announcement 
was more than 25 times the volume in the month prior to the announcement. In the 
three months following the announcement of the special dividend, the cumulative volume 
exceeded 65% of the total shares available for trade.
While this evidence supports the dividend-capture theory, it is also true that many 
high-tax investors continue to hold stocks even when dividends are paid. For a small 
­ordinary dividend, the transaction costs and risks of trading the stock probably offset the 
benefits associated with dividend capture.20 Only large special dividends, such as in the 
case of Value Line, tend to generate significant increases in volume. Thus, while clientele 
effects and dividend-capture strategies reduce the relative tax disadvantage of dividends, 
they do not eliminate it.21

book of the Economics of Finance: Corporate Finance Volume 1A (Elsevier, 2003).
19This idea is developed by A. Kalay, “The Ex-Dividend Day Behavior of Stock Prices: A Reexamination 
of the Clientele Effect,” Journal of Finance 37 (1982): 1059–1070. See also J. Boyd and R. ­Jagannathan, 
“Ex-Dividend Price Behavior of Common Stocks,” Review of Financial Studies 7 (1994): 711–741, who 
discuss the complications that arise with multiple tax clienteles.
20Dividend-capture strategies are risky because the stock price may fluctuate for unrelated reasons 
before the transaction can be completed. J. Koski and R. Michaely, “Prices, Liquidity, and the Informa-
tion Content of Trades,” Review of Financial Studies 13 (2000): 659–696, show that this risk can be 
eliminated by negotiating a purchase and sale simultaneously, but with settlement dates before and after 
the ex-dividend date. When such transactions are possible, the amount of dividend-related volume is 
greatly increased.
21Dividend capture strategies are one reason it is difficult to find evidence that dividend yields affect the 
equity cost of capital. While evidence was found by R. Litzenberger and K. Ramaswamy [“The Effects of 
Personal Taxes and Dividends on Capital Asset Prices: Theory and Empirical Evidence,” Journal of Finan-
cial Economics 7 (1979): 163–195], this evidence is contradicted by F. Black and M. Scholes [“The Effects 
of Dividend Yield and Dividend Policy on Common Stock Prices and Returns,” Journal of Financial 
Economics 1 (1974): 1–22]. A. Kalay and R. Michaely provide an explanation for these differing results, 
and do not find a significant impact of dividend yields on expected returns [“Dividends and Taxes: A 
Reexamination,” Financial Management 29 (2000): 55–75].

17.5	 Payout Versus Retention of Cash
Looking back at Figure 17.1, we have thus far considered only one aspect of a firm’s pay-
out policy: the choice between paying dividends and repurchasing shares. But how should 
a firm decide the amount it should pay out to shareholders and the amount it should 
retain?
To answer this question, first, we must consider what the firm will do with cash that it 
retains. It can invest the cash in new projects or in financial instruments. We will demon-
strate that in the context of perfect capital markets, once a firm has taken all positive-NPV 
investments, it is indifferent between saving excess cash and paying it out. But once we 
consider market imperfections, there is a trade-off: Retaining cash can reduce the costs of 
raising capital in the future, but it can also increase taxes and agency costs.

Volume and Share Price Effects of Value Line’s  
Special Dividend
On announcement of the special dividend of $17.50 per share, Value Line’s share price rose, 
as did the volume of trade. The share price dropped by $17.91 on the ­ex-dividend date, and 
the volume gradually declined over the following weeks. This pattern of volume is consistent 
with non-taxed investors buying the stock before the ex-dividend date and selling it after-
ward. (We consider reasons for the jump in the stock price on the announcement of the divi-
dend in Sections 17.5 and 17.6.)

Chapter 17  Payout Policy
Retaining Cash with Perfect Capital Markets
If a firm retains cash, it can use those funds to invest in new projects. If new positive-
NPV projects are available, this decision is clearly the correct one. Making positive-NPV 
investments will create value for the firm’s investors, whereas saving the cash or paying 
it out will not. However, once the firm has already taken all positive-NPV projects, any 
additional projects it takes on are zero or negative-NPV investments. Taking on negative-
NPV investments will reduce shareholder value, as the benefits of such investments do not 
exceed their costs.
Of course, rather than waste excess cash on negative-NPV projects, a firm can hold the 
cash in the bank or use it to purchase financial assets. The firm can then pay the money 
to shareholders at a future time or invest it when positive-NPV investment opportunities 
become available.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of retaining cash and investing in financial 
securities? In perfect capital markets, buying and selling securities is a zero-NPV transac-
tion, so it should not affect firm value. Shareholders can make any investment a firm 
makes on their own if the firm pays out the cash. Thus, it should not be surprising that 
with perfect capital markets, the retention versus payout decision—just like the dividend 
versus share repurchase decision—is irrelevant to total firm value.
Example 17.4
Delaying Dividends with Perfect Markets
Problem
Barston Mining has $100,000 in excess cash. Barston is considering investing the cash in one-
year Treasury bills paying 6% interest, and then using the cash to pay a dividend next year. Alter-
natively, the firm can pay a dividend immediately and shareholders can invest the cash on their 
own. In a perfect capital market, which option will shareholders prefer?
Solution
If Barston pays an immediate dividend, the shareholders receive $100,000 today. If Barston 
retains the cash, at the end of one year the company will be able to pay a dividend of
$100,000 * (1.06) = $106,000
This payoff is the same as if shareholders had invested the $100,000 in Treasury bills themselves. In 
other words, the present value of this future dividend is exactly $106,000 , (1.06) = $100,000. 
Thus, shareholders are indifferent about whether the firm pays the dividend immediately or 
retains the cash.
As Example 17.4 illustrates, there is no difference for shareholders if the firm pays the 
cash immediately or retains the cash and pays it out at a future date. This example provides 
yet another illustration of Modigliani and Miller’s fundamental insight regarding financial 
policy irrelevance in perfect capital markets:
MM Payout Irrelevance: In perfect capital markets, if a firm invests excess cash flows in 
financial securities, the firm’s choice of payout versus retention is irrelevant and does not affect 
the initial value of the firm.
Thus, the decision of whether to retain cash depends on market imperfections, which we 
turn to next.

	
17.5  Payout Versus Retention of Cash	
649
Taxes and Cash Retention
Example 17.4 assumed perfect capital markets, and so ignored the effect of taxes. How 
would our result change with taxes?
Example 17.5
Retaining Cash with Corporate Taxes
Problem
Suppose Barston must pay corporate taxes at a 35% rate on the interest it will earn from the 
one-year Treasury bill paying 6% interest. Would pension fund investors (who do not pay taxes 
on their investment income) prefer that Barston use its excess cash to pay the $100,000 dividend 
immediately or retain the cash for one year?
Solution
If Barston pays an immediate dividend, shareholders receive $100,000 today. If Barston retains 
the cash for one year, it will earn an after-tax return on the Treasury bills of
6% * (1 - 0.35) = 3.90%
Thus, at the end of the year, Barston will pay a dividend of $100,000 * (1.039) = $103,900.
This amount is less than the $106,000 the investors would have earned if they had invested 
the $100,000 in Treasury bills themselves. Because Barston must pay corporate taxes on the 
interest it earns, there is a tax disadvantage to retaining cash. Pension fund investors will there-
fore prefer that Barston pays the dividend now.
Example 17.6
Microsoft’s Special Dividend
Problem
In the introduction to this chapter, we described Microsoft’s special dividend of $3 per share, 
or $32 billion, during late 2004. If Microsoft had instead retained that cash permanently, what 
would the present value of the additional taxes be?
Solution
If Microsoft retained the cash, the interest earned on it would be subject to a 35% corporate tax 
rate. Because the interest payments are risk free, we can discount the tax payments at the risk-
free interest rate (assuming Microsoft’s marginal corporate tax rate will remain constant or that 
changes to it have a beta of zero). Thus, the present value of the tax payments on Microsoft’s 
additional interest income would be
$32 billion * rf * 35%
rf
= $32 billion * 35% = $11.2 billion
Equivalently, on a per share basis, Microsoft’s tax savings from paying out the cash rather than 
retaining it is $3 * 35% = $1.05 per share.
As Example 17.5 shows, corporate taxes make it costly for a firm to retain excess cash. 
This effect is the very same effect we identified in Chapter 15 with regard to leverage: 
When a firm pays interest, it receives a tax deduction for that interest, whereas when a 
firm receives interest, it owes taxes on the interest. As we discussed in Chapter 14, cash is 
equivalent to negative leverage, so the tax advantage of leverage implies a tax disadvantage 
to holding cash.

650	
Chapter 17  Payout Policy
There is one situation when holding cash can lower taxes. Corporations only pay 
U.S. taxes on their international earnings when they repatriate those earnings. So in 
some cases corporations can lower their U.S. tax burden by not repatriating earnings and 
instead holding the cash abroad. If the cash is ultimately spent on future international 
investments, the corporation can avoid paying U.S. taxes on these earnings. Alterna-
tively, the firm can hold the cash and simultaneously borrow in the U.S. to leave its net 
debt unchanged. (See “The Repatriation Tax: Why Some Cash-Rich Firms Borrow” in 
­Chapter 15, page 557.)
Adjusting for Investor Taxes
The decision to pay out versus retain cash may also affect the taxes paid by shareholders. 
While pension and retirement fund investors are tax exempt, most individual investors 
must pay taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains. How do investor taxes affect the 
tax disadvantage of retaining cash?
We illustrate the tax impact with a simple example. Consider a firm whose only asset 
is $100 in cash, and suppose all investors face identical tax rates. Let’s compare the option 
of paying out this cash as an immediate dividend of $100 with the option of retaining the 
$100 permanently and using the interest earned to pay dividends.
Suppose the firm pays out its cash immediately as a dividend and shuts down. Because 
the ex-dividend price of the firm is zero (it has shut down), using Eq. 17.2 we find that 
before the dividend is paid the firm has a share price of
	
Pcum = Pex + Div0 * ¢ 1 - td
1 - tg
≤= 0 + 100 * ¢1 - td
1 - tg
≤
(17.4)
This price reflects the fact that the investor will pay tax on the dividend at rate td, but will 
receive a tax credit (at capital gains tax rate tg) for the capital loss when the firm shuts down.
Alternatively, the firm can retain the cash and invest it in Treasury bills, earning interest 
at rate rf  each year. After paying corporate taxes on this interest at rate tc, the firm can pay 
a perpetual dividend of
Div = 100 * rf * (1 - tc)
each year and retain the $100 in cash permanently. What price will an investor pay for the 
firm in this case? The investor’s cost of capital is the after-tax return that she could earn by 
investing in Treasury bills on her own: rf * (1 - ti), where ti is the investor’s tax rate on 
interest income. Because the investor must pay taxes on the dividends as well, the value of 
the firm if it retains the $100 is22
	
 Pretain = Div * (1 - td)
rf * (1 - ti) =
100 * rf * (1 - tc) * (1 - td)
rf * (1 - ti)
	
 = 100 * (1 - tc)(1 - td)
(1 - ti)

(17.5)
22There is no capital gains tax consequence in this case because the share price will remain the same each year.

	
17.5  Payout Versus Retention of Cash	
651
Comparing Eq. 17.4 and Eq. 17.5,
	
Pretain = Pcum *
(1 - tc)(1 - tg )
(1 - ti)
= Pcum * (1 - t*retain)	
(17.6)
where t*retain measures the effective tax disadvantage of retaining cash:
	
t*retain = ¢1 -
(1 - tc)(1 - tg)
(1 - ti)
≤	
(17.7)
Because the dividend tax will be paid whether the firm pays the cash immediately or retains 
the cash and pays the interest over time, the dividend tax rate does not affect the cost of 
retaining cash in Eq. 17.7.23 The intuition for Eq. 17.7 is that when a firm retains cash, it 
must pay corporate tax on the interest it earns. In addition, the investor will owe capital 
gains tax on the increased value of the firm. In essence, the interest on retained cash is 
taxed twice. If the firm paid the cash to its shareholders instead, they could invest it and be 
taxed only once on the interest that they earn. The cost of retaining cash therefore depends 
on the combined effect of the corporate and capital gains taxes, compared to the single tax 
on interest income. Using 2015 tax rates (see Table 15.3), tc = 35%, ti = 39.6%, and 
tg = 20%, we get an effective tax disadvantage of retained cash of t*retain = 13.9%. Thus, 
after adjusting for investor taxes, there remains a substantial tax disadvantage for the firm to 
retaining excess cash.
Issuance and Distress Costs
If there is a tax disadvantage to retaining cash, why do some firms accumulate large cash 
balances? Generally, they retain cash balances to cover potential future cash shortfalls. 
For example, if there is a reasonable likelihood that future earnings will be insufficient to 
fund future positive-NPV investment opportunities, a firm may start accumulating cash 
to make up the difference. This motivation is especially relevant for firms that may need to 
fund large-scale research and development projects or large acquisitions.
The advantage of holding cash to cover future potential cash needs is that this strategy 
allows a firm to avoid the transaction costs of raising new capital (through new debt or 
equity issues). The direct costs of issuance range from 1% to 3% for debt issues and from 
3.5% to 7% for equity issues. There can also be substantial indirect costs of raising capital 
due to the agency and adverse selection (lemons) costs discussed in Chapter 16. Therefore, 
a firm must balance the tax costs of holding cash with the potential benefits of not having 
to raise external funds in the future. Firms with very volatile earnings may also build up 
23Equation 17.7 also holds if the firm uses any (constant) mix of dividends and share repurchases. How-
ever, if the firm initially retains cash by cutting back only on share repurchases, and then later uses the 
cash to pay a mix of dividends and repurchases, then we would replace tg in Eq. 17.7 with the average tax 
rate on dividends and capital gains, te = atd + (1 - a)tg , where a is the proportion of dividends versus 
repurchases. In that case, tretain
*
 equals the effective tax disadvantage of debt t* we derived in Eq. 15.7, 
where we implicitly assumed that debt was used to fund a share repurchase (or avoid an equity issue), 
and that the future interest payments displaced a mix of dividends and share repurchases. Using tg here is 
sometimes referred to as the “new view” or “trapped-equity” view of retained earnings; see, for example, 
A. Auerbach, “Tax Integration and the ‘New View’ of the Corporate Tax: A 1980s Perspective,” Proceed-
ings of the National Tax Association–Tax Institute of America (1981): 21–27. Using te corresponds to the 
“traditional view”; see, for example, J. Poterba and L. Summers, “Dividend Taxes, Corporate Investment, 
and ‘Q’,” Journal of Public Economics 22 (1983): 135–167.

652	
Chapter 17  Payout Policy
cash reserves to enable them to weather temporary periods of operating losses. By holding 
sufficient cash, these firms can avoid financial distress and its associated costs.
Agency Costs of Retaining Cash
There is no benefit to shareholders when a firm holds cash above and beyond its future 
investment or liquidity needs, however. In fact, in addition to the tax cost, there are likely 
to be agency costs associated with having too much cash in the firm. As discussed in 
­Chapter 16, when firms have excessive cash, managers may use the funds inefficiently by 
continuing money-losing pet projects, paying excessive executive perks, or over-paying for 
acquisitions. In addition, unions, the government, or other entities may take advantage of 
the firm’s “deep pockets.”24 Leverage is one way to reduce a firm’s excess cash and avoid 
these costs; dividends and share repurchases perform a similar role by taking cash out of the 
firm.
For highly levered firms, equity holders have an additional incentive to pay out cash. 
Due to the debt overhang problem discussed in Chapter 16, some of the value of the 
retained cash will benefit debt holders. As a result, equity holders may prefer to “cash out” 
and increase the firm’s payouts. Anticipating this, debt holders will charge a higher cost 
of debt, or include covenants restricting the firm’s payout policy (see the discussion in 
Section 16.5).
Thus, paying out excess cash through dividends or share repurchases can boost the 
stock price by reducing waste or the transfer of the firm’s resources to other stakeholders. 
This potential savings, together with tax benefits, likely explains the roughly $10 increase 
in Value Line’s stock price on the announcement of its special dividend, shown in 
Figure 17.6.
24For example, while Ford’s larger cash balances helped it weather the 2008 financial crisis, it also did not 
receive the same government subsidies or labor concessions as its more troubled competitors.
Example 17.7
Cutting Negative-NPV Growth
Problem
Rexton Oil is an all-equity firm with 100 million shares outstanding. Rexton has $150 million 
in cash and expects future free cash flows of $65 million per year. Management plans to use the 
cash to expand the firm’s operations, which will in turn increase future free cash flows by 12%. 
If the cost of capital of Rexton’s investments is 10%, how would a decision to use the cash for a 
share repurchase rather than the expansion change the share price?
Solution
If Rexton uses the cash to expand, its future free cash flows will increase by 12% to $65 million 
* 1.12 = $72.8 million per year. Using the perpetuity formula, its market value will be $72.8  
 million , 10% = $728 million, or $7.28 per share.
If Rexton does not expand, the value of its future free cash flows will be $65 million , 10%
= $650 million. Adding the cash, Rexton’s market value is $800 million, or $8.00 per share. If 
Rexton repurchases shares, there will be no change to the share price: It will repurchase 
$150 million , $8.00/share = 18.75 million shares, so it will have assets worth $650 million 
with 81.25 million shares outstanding, for a share price of $650 million , 81.25 million shares
= $8.00/share.

	
17.5  Payout Versus Retention of Cash	
653
Ultimately, firms should choose to retain cash for the same reasons they would use low 
leverage25—to preserve financial slack for future growth opportunities and to avoid finan-
cial distress costs. These needs must be balanced against the tax disadvantage of holding 
cash and the agency cost of wasteful investment. It is not surprising, then, that large global 
high-tech and biotechnology firms, which typically choose to use little debt, also tend to 
retain and accumulate large amounts of cash. See Table 17.4 for a list of some U.S. firms 
with large cash balances.
As with capital structure decisions, however, payout policies are generally set by man-
agers whose incentives may differ from those of shareholders. Managers may prefer to 
retain and maintain control over the firm’s cash rather than pay it out. The retained cash 
can be used to fund investments that are costly for shareholders but have benefits for 
managers (for instance, pet projects and excessive salaries), or it can simply be held as a 
means to reduce leverage and the risk of financial distress that could threaten managers’ 
job security. According to the managerial entrenchment theory of payout policy, man­
agers pay out cash only when pressured to do so by the firm’s investors.26
Concept Check	
1.	 Is there an advantage for a firm to retain its cash instead of paying it out to shareholders in perfect 
capital markets?
	
2.	 How do corporate taxes affect the decision of a firm to retain excess cash?
25As discussed in Chapter 14, we can interpret excess cash as negative debt. As a consequence, the trade-
offs from holding excess cash are very similar to those involved in the capital structure decision.
26Recall from Section 16.7 that the managerial entrenchment theory of capital structure argued that manag-
ers choose low leverage to avoid the discipline of debt and preserve their job security. Applied to payout pol-
icy, the same theory implies that managers will reduce leverage further by choosing to hold too much cash.
In this case, cutting investment and growth to fund a share repurchase increases the share 
price by $0.72 per share. The reason is the expansion has a negative NPV: It costs $150 million, 
but increases future free cash flows by only $7.8 million, for an NPV of
-$150 million + $7.8 million/10% = -$72 million, or -$0.72 per share

One market imperfection that we have not yet considered is asymmetric information. 
When managers have better information than investors regarding the future prospects of 
the firm, their payout decisions may signal this information. In this section, we look at 
managers’ motivations when setting a firm’s payout policy, and we evaluate what these 
decisions may communicate to investors.
Dividend Smoothing
Firms can change dividends at any time, but in practice they vary the sizes of their divi-
dends relatively infrequently. For example, General Motors (GM) changed the amount of 
its regular dividend only eight times over a 20-year period. Yet during that same period, 
GM’s earnings varied widely, as shown in Figure 17.7.
The pattern seen with GM is typical of most firms that pay dividends. Firms adjust 
dividends relatively infrequently, and dividends are much less volatile than earnings. 
This practice of maintaining relatively constant dividends is called dividend smoothing. 
Firms also increase dividends much more frequently than they cut them. For example, 
from 1971 to 2001, only 5.4% of dividend changes by U.S. firms were decreases.27 In a 
classic survey of corporate executives, John Lintner28 suggested that these observations 
resulted from (1) management’s belief that investors prefer stable dividends with sus-
tained growth, and (2) management’s desire to maintain a long-term target level of divi-
dends as a fraction of earnings. Thus firms raise their dividends only when they perceive

a long-term sustainable increase in the expected level of future earnings, and cut them 
only as a last resort.29
How can firms keep dividends smooth as earnings vary? As we have already discussed, 
firms can maintain almost any level of dividend in the short run by adjusting the number 
of shares they repurchase or issue and the amount of cash they retain. However, due to the 
tax and transaction costs of funding a dividend with new equity issues, managers do not 
wish to commit to a dividend that the firm cannot afford to pay out of regular earnings. 
For this reason, firms generally set dividends at a level they expect to be able to maintain 
based on the firm’s earnings prospects.
Dividend Signaling
If firms smooth dividends, the firm’s dividend choice will contain information regarding 
management’s expectations of future earnings. When a firm increases its dividend, it sends 
a positive signal to investors that management expects to be able to afford the higher divi-
dend for the foreseeable future. Conversely, when managers cut the dividend, it may signal 
that they have given up hope that earnings will rebound in the near term and so need to 
reduce the dividend to save cash. The idea that dividend changes reflect managers’ views 
about a firm’s future earnings prospects is called the dividend signaling hypothesis.
Studies of the market’s reaction to dividend changes are consistent with this hypothesis. 
For example, during the period 1967–1993, firms that raised their dividend by 10% or 
more saw their stock prices rise by 1.34% after the announcement, while those that cut 
their dividend by 10% or more experienced a price decline of -3.71%.30 The average size 
of the stock price reaction increases with the magnitude of the dividend change, and is 
larger for dividend cuts.31
Dividend signaling is similar to the use of leverage as a signal that we discussed in Chap-
ter 16. Increasing debt signals that management believes the firm can afford the future 
interest payments, in the same way that raising the dividend signals the firm can afford to 
maintain the dividends in the future. However, while cutting the dividend is costly for 
managers in terms of their reputation and the reaction of investors, it is by no means as 
costly as failing to make debt payments. As a consequence, we would expect dividend 
changes to be a somewhat weaker signal than leverage changes. Indeed, empirical studies 
have found average stock price increases of more than 10% when firms replace equity with 
debt, and decreases of 4% to 10% when firms replace debt with equity.32
29While perhaps a good description of how firms do set their dividends, as we have shown in this chapter 
there is no clear reason why firms should smooth their dividends, nor convincing evidence that investors 
prefer this practice.
30See G. Grullon, R. Michaely, and B. Swaminathan, “Are Dividend Changes a Sign of Firm Maturity?” 
Journal of Business 75 (2002): 387–424. The effects are even larger for dividend initiations (+3.4%) and 
omissions (-7%), according to studies by R. Michaely, R. Thaler, and K. Womack, “Price Reactions to 
Dividend Initiations and Omissions: Overreaction or Drift?” Journal of Finance 50 (1995): 573–608, and 
similar results by P. Healy and K. Palepu, “Earnings Information Conveyed by Dividend Initiations and 
Omissions,” Journal of Financial Economics 21 (1988): 149–176.
31Not all of the evidence is consistent with dividend signaling, however. For example, it has been dif-
ficult to document a relationship between dividend changes and realized future earnings [S. Benartzi, R. 
Michaely, and R. Thaler, “Do Changes in Dividends Signal the Future or the Past?” Journal of Finance 52 
(1997): 1007–1034].

Chapter 17  Payout Policy
While an increase of a firm’s dividend may signal management’s optimism regarding its 
future cash flows, it might also signal a lack of investment opportunities. For example, 
Microsoft’s move to initiate dividends in 2003 was largely seen as a result of its declining 
growth prospects as opposed to a signal about its increased future profitability.33 ­Conversely, 
a firm might cut its dividend to exploit new positive-NPV investment opportunities. In 
this case, the dividend decrease might lead to a positive—rather than negative—stock price 
reaction (see the box on Royal and SunAlliance’s dividend cut). In general, we must inter-
pret dividends as a signal in the context of the type of new information managers are likely 
to have.
Signaling and Share Repurchases
Share repurchases, like dividends, may also signal managers’ information to the market. 
However, several important differences distinguish share repurchases and dividends. 
First, managers are much less committed to share repurchases than to dividend pay-
ments. As we noted earlier, when firms announce authorization for an open market share 
repurchase, they generally announce the maximum amount they plan to spend on repur-
chases. The actual amount spent, however, may be far less. Also, it may take several years 
to complete the share repurchase.34 Second, unlike with dividends, firms do not smooth 
their repurchase activity from year to year. As a result, announcing a share repurchase 
today does not necessarily represent a long-term commitment to repurchase shares. In 
this regard, share repurchases may be less of a signal than dividends about future earnings 
of a firm.
A third key difference between dividends and share repurchases is that the cost of a share 
repurchase depends on the market price of the stock. If managers believe the stock is cur-
rently overvalued, a share repurchase will be costly to the shareholders who choose to hold 
on to their shares because buying the stock at its current (overvalued) price is a negative-
NPV investment. By contrast, repurchasing shares when managers perceive the stock to

34C. Stephens and M. Weisbach, “Actual Share Reacquisitions in Open-Market Repurchase Programs,” 
Journal of Finance 53 (1998): 313–333, consider how firms’ actual repurchases compare to their 
announced plans. For details on share repurchase programs’ implementation, see D. Cook, L. Krigman, 
and J. Leach, “On the Timing and Execution of Open Market Repurchases,” Review of Financial Studies 
17 (2004): 463–498.
In some quarters, Julian Hance must have seemed like a her-
etic. On November 8, 2001, the finance director of Royal 
& SunAlliance, a U.K.-based insurance group with £12.6 
billion (€20.2 billion) in annual revenue, did the unthink-
able—he announced that he would cut the firm’s dividend.
Many observers gasped at the decision. Surely, they 
argued, cutting the dividend was a sign of weakness. Didn’t 
companies only cut their dividend when profits were falling?
Quite the contrary, countered Hance. With insurance 
premiums rising around the world, particularly follow-
ing the World Trade Center tragedy, Royal & SunAlliance 
believed that its industry offered excellent growth opportu-
nities. “The outlook for business in 2002 and beyond makes 
a compelling case for reinvesting capital in the business 
rather than returning it to shareholders,” explained Hance.
The stock market agreed with him, sending Royal & 
SunAlliance’s shares up 5% following its dividend news. 
“Cutting the dividend is a positive move,” observes Mat-
thew Wright, an insurance analyst at Credit Lyonnais. “It 
shows the company expects future profitability to be good.”

be undervalued is a positive-NPV investment for these shareholders. Thus, if managers 
are acting in the interest of long-term shareholders and attempting to maximize the firm’s 
future share price, they will be more likely to repurchase shares if they believe the stock to 
be undervalued. (If, on the other hand, managers act in the interest of all shareholders—
including those who sell—then there is no such incentive: Any gain to those who remain is 
a cost to those who sell at the low price.)
In a 2004 survey, 87% of CFOs agreed that firms should repurchase shares when their 
stock price is a good value relative to its true value,35 implicitly indicating that most CFOs 
believe that they should act in the interests of the long-term shareholders. Share repur-
chases are therefore a credible signal that management believes its shares are underpriced. 
Thus, if investors believe that managers have better information regarding the firm’s pros-
pects than they do, then investors should react favorably to share repurchase announce-
ments. Indeed they do: The average market price reaction to the announcement of an open 
market share repurchase program is about 3% (with the size of the reaction increasing in 
the portion of shares outstanding sought).36 The reaction is much larger for fixed-price 
tender offers (12%) and Dutch auction share repurchases (8%).37 Recall that these meth-
ods of repurchase are generally used for very large repurchases conducted in a very short 
timeframe and are often part of an overall recapitalization. Also, the shares are repurchased 
at a premium to the current market price. Thus, tender offers and Dutch auction repur-
chases are even stronger signals than open market repurchases that management views the 
current share price as undervalued.

Problem
Clark Industries has 200 million shares outstanding, a current share price of $30, and no debt. 
Clark’s management believes that the shares are underpriced, and that the true value is $35 per 
share. Clark plans to pay $600 million in cash to its shareholders by repurchasing shares at the 
current market price. Suppose that soon after the transaction is completed, new information 
comes out that causes investors to revise their opinion of the firm and agree with management’s 
assessment of Clark’s value. What is Clark’s share price after the new information comes out? 
How would the share price differ if Clark waited until after the new information came out to 
repurchase the shares?
Solution
Clark’s initial market cap is $30/share * 200  million shares = $6  billion, of which $600 mil-
lion is cash and $5.4 billion corresponds to other assets. At the current share price, Clark will

17.7	 Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs
In this chapter, we have focused on a firm’s decision to pay cash to its shareholders. But a 
firm can pay another type of dividend that does not involve cash: a stock dividend. In this 
case, each shareholder who owns the stock before it goes ex-dividend receives additional 
shares of stock of the firm itself (a stock split) or of a subsidiary (a spin-off). Here we briefly 
review these two types of transactions.
Stock Dividends and Splits
If a company declares a 10% stock dividend, each shareholder will receive one new share 
of stock for every 10 shares already owned. Stock dividends of 50% or higher are gener-
ally referred to as stock splits. For example, with a 50% stock dividend, each shareholder 
will receive one new share for every two shares owned. Because a holder of two shares will 
end up holding three new shares, this transaction is also called a 3:2 (“3-for-2”) stock split. 
Similarly, a 100% stock dividend is equivalent to a 2:1 stock split.
repurchase $600 million , $30/share = 20 million shares. The market value balance sheet 
before and after the transaction is shown below (in millions of dollars):
According to management, Clark’s initial market capitalization should be $35/share * 200 
million shares = $7 billion, of which $6.4 billion would correspond to other assets. As the mar-
ket value balance sheet shows, after the new information comes out, Clark’s share price will rise 
to $35.556.
If Clark waited for the new information to come out before repurchasing the shares, it would 
buy shares at a market price of $35 per share. Thus, it would repurchase only 17.1 million shares. 
The share price after the repurchase would be $6.4 billion , 182.9 shares = $35.
By repurchasing shares while the stock is underpriced, the ultimate share price is $0.556 
higher, representing a gain of $0.556 * 180 million shares = $100 million for long-term share-
holders. This gain equals the loss to the selling shareholders from selling 20 million shares at a 
price that is $5 below their true value.
As this example shows, the gain from buying shares when the stock is underpriced leads to an 
increase in the firm’s long-run share price. Similarly, buying shares when the stock is overpriced 
will reduce the long-run share price. The firm may therefore try to time its repurchases appro-
priately. Anticipating this strategy, shareholders may interpret a share repurchase as a signal that 
the firm is undervalued.

With a stock dividend, a firm does not pay out any cash to shareholders. As a result, the 
total market value of the firm’s assets and liabilities, and therefore of its equity, is unchanged. 
The only thing that is different is the number of shares outstanding. The stock price will 
therefore fall because the same total equity value is now divided over a larger number of shares.
Let’s illustrate a stock dividend for Genron. Suppose Genron paid a 50% stock dividend 
(a 3:2 stock split) rather than a cash dividend. Table 17.5 shows the market value balance 
sheet and the resulting share price before and after the stock dividend.

A shareholder who owns 100 shares before the dividend has a portfolio worth 
$42 * 100 = $4200. After the dividend, the shareholder owns 150 shares worth $28, giv-
ing a portfolio value of $28 * 150 = $4200. (Note the important difference between a 
stock split and a share issuance: When the company issues shares, the number of shares 
increases, but the firm also raises cash to add to its existing assets. If the shares are sold at a 
fair price, the stock price should not change.)
Unlike cash dividends, stock dividends are not taxed. Thus, from both the firm’s and 
shareholders’ perspectives, there is no real consequence to a stock dividend. The number of 
shares is proportionally increased and the price per share is proportionally reduced so that 
there is no change in value.
Why, then, do companies pay stock dividends or split their stock? The typical motiva-
tion for a stock split is to keep the share price in a range thought to be attractive to small 
investors. Stocks generally trade in lots of 100 shares, and in any case do not trade in units 
less than one share. As a result, if the share price rises significantly, it might be difficult for 
small investors to afford one share, let alone 100. Making the stock more attractive to small 
investors can increase the demand for and the liquidity of the stock, which may in turn 
boost the stock price. On average, announcements of stock splits are associated with a 2% 
increase in the stock price.38
Most firms use splits to keep their share prices from exceeding $100. From 1990 to 
2000, Cisco Systems split its stock nine times, so that one share purchased at the IPO split 
into 288 shares. Had it not split, Cisco’s share price at the time of its last split in March 
2000 would have been 288 * $72.19, or $20,790.72.

stock splits attract individual investors, see R. Dhar, W. Goetzmann, and N. Zhu, “The Impact of Clientele 
Changes: Evidence from Stock Splits,” Yale ICF Working Paper No. 03-14 (2004). While splits seem to increase 
the number of shareholders, evidence of their impact on liquidity is mixed; see, for example, T. Copeland, 
“Liquidity Changes Following Stock Splits,” Journal of Finance 34 (1979): 115–141; and J. Lakonishok and 
B. Lev, “Stock Splits and Stock Dividends: Why, Who and When,” Journal of Finance 42 (1987): 913–932.

Chapter 17  Payout Policy
Firms also do not want their stock prices to fall too low. First, a stock price that is very 
low raises transaction costs for investors. For example, the spread between the bid and 
ask price for a stock has a minimum size of one tick ($0.01 for the NYSE and NASDAQ 
exchanges) independent of the stock price. In percentage terms, the tick size is larger for 
stocks with a low price than for stocks with a high price. Also, exchanges require stocks to 
maintain a minimum price to remain listed on an exchange (for example, the NYSE and 
NASDAQ require listed firms to maintain a price of at least $1 per share).
If the price of the stock falls too low, a company can engage in a reverse split and reduce 
the number of shares outstanding. For example, in a 1:10 reverse split, every 10 shares of 
stock are replaced with a single share. As a result, the share price increases tenfold. Reverse 
splits became necessary for many dot-coms after the Internet bust in 2000, and similarly 
for some financial firms in the wake of the financial crisis. Citigroup, for instance, split its 
stock 7 times between 1990 and 2000, for a cumulative increase of 12:1. But in May 2011 
it implemented a 1:10 reverse split to increase its stock price from $4.50 to $45 per share.
Through a combination of splits and reverse splits, firms can keep their share prices in 
any range they desire. As Figure 17.8 shows, almost all firms have share prices below $100 
per share, with 90% of firms’ share prices between $2.50 and $65 per share.
Spin-Offs
Rather than pay a dividend using cash or shares of its own stock, a firm can also dis-
tribute shares of a subsidiary in a transaction referred to as a spin-off. Non-cash special 
dividends are commonly used to spin off assets or a subsidiary as a separate company. 
For example, after selling 15% of Monsanto Corporation in an IPO in October 2000, 
Pharmacia Corporation announced in July 2002 that it would spin off its remaining 85% 
holding of Monsanto Corporation. The spin-off was accomplished through a special divi-
dend in which each Pharmacia shareholder received 0.170593 share of Monsanto per share 
of Pharmacia owned. After receiving the Monsanto shares, Pharmacia shareholders could 
trade them separately from the shares of the parent firm.

On the distribution date of August 13, 2002, Monsanto shares traded for an average 
price of $16.21. Thus, the value of the special dividend was
0.170593 Monsanto shares * $16.21 per share = $2.77 per share
A shareholder who initially owned 100 shares of Pharmacia stock would receive 17 shares 
of Monsanto stock, plus cash of 0.0593 * $16.21 = $0.96 in place of the fractional shares.
Alternatively, Pharmacia could have sold the shares of Monsanto and distributed the 
cash to shareholders as a cash dividend. The transaction Pharmacia chose offers two advan-
tages over a cash distribution: (1) It avoids the transaction costs associated with such a sale, 
and (2) the special dividend is not taxed as a cash distribution. Instead, Pharmacia share-
holders who received Monsanto shares are liable for capital gains tax only at the time they 
sell the Monsanto shares.39
Here we have considered only the methods of distributing the shares of the firm that has 
been spun off, either by paying a stock dividend or by selling the shares directly and then dis-
tributing (or retaining) the cash. The decision of whether to do the spin-off in the first place 
raises a new question: When is it better for two firms to operate as separate entities, rather 
than as a single combined firm? The issues that arise in addressing this question are the same 
as those that arise in the decision to merge two firms, which we discuss further in Chapter 28.

39The capital gain is computed by allocating a fraction of the cost basis of the Pharmacia shares to the 
Monsanto shares received. Because Pharmacia was trading at an ex-dividend price of $42.54 on the dis-
tribution date, the special dividend amounted to 6.1% = 2.77/(2.77 + 42.54) of total value. Thus, the 
original cost basis of the Pharmacia stock was divided by allocating 6.1% to the Monsanto shares and 
the remaining 93.9% to the Pharmacia shares.
Many managers split their stock to keep the price affordable 
for small investors, making it easier for them to buy and sell 
the stock. Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of 
Berkshire Hathaway, disagrees. As he commented in Berk-
shire’s 1983 annual report: “We are often asked why Berk-
shire does not split its stock . . . we want [shareholders] who 
think of themselves as business owners with the intention 
of staying a long time. And, we want those who keep their 
eyes focused on business results, not market prices.” In its 
40-year history, Berkshire Hathaway has never split its stock.
As a result of Berkshire Hathaway’s strong performance 
and the lack of stock splits, the stock price climbed. By 1996, 
it exceeded $30,000 per share. Because this price was much 
too expensive for some small investors, several financial inter-
mediaries created unit investment trusts whose only invest-
ment was Berkshire shares. (Unit investment trusts are similar 
to mutual funds, but their investment portfolio is fixed.) 
Investors could buy smaller interests in these trusts, effectively 
owning Berkshire stock with a much lower initial investment.
In response, in February 1996, Buffett announced the 
creation of a second class of Berkshire Hathaway stock, the 
Class B shares. Each owner of the original shares (now called 
Class A shares) was offered the opportunity to convert each 
A share into 30 B shares. “We’re giving shareholders a do-it-
yourself split, if they care to do it,” Buffett said. Through the 
B shares, investors could own Berkshire stock with a smaller 
investment, and they would not have to pay the extra trans-
action costs required to buy stock through the unit trusts.
Meanwhile, the value of the A shares has continued to 
rise. After reaching a peak of almost $230,000 in December

early 2016.*
*Buffet’s logic for not splitting the stock is a bit puzzling. If an extremely 
high stock price were advantageous, Buffet could have obtained it much 
sooner through a reverse split of the stock.

Chapter 17  Payout Policy
17.1  Distributions to Shareholders
	
n	 When a firm wants to distribute cash to its shareholders, it can pay a cash dividend or it can 
repurchase shares.
n	 Most companies pay regular, quarterly dividends. Sometimes firms announce one-time, spe-
cial dividends.
n	 Firms repurchase shares using an open market repurchase, a tender offer, a Dutch auction 
repurchase, or a targeted repurchase.
	
n	 On the declaration date, firms announce that they will pay dividends to all shareholders of 
record on the record date. The ex-dividend date is the first day on which the stock trades with-
out the right to an upcoming dividend; it is usually two trading days prior to the record date. 
Dividend checks are mailed on the payment date.
	
n	 In a stock split or a stock dividend, a company distributes additional shares rather than cash to 
shareholders.
17.2  Comparison of Dividends and Share Repurchases
	
n	 In perfect capital markets, the stock price falls by the amount of the dividend when a dividend 
is paid. An open market share repurchase has no effect on the stock price, and the stock price is 
the same as the cum-dividend price if a dividend were paid instead.
	
n	 The Modigliani-Miller dividend irrelevance proposition states that in perfect capital markets, 
holding fixed the investment policy of a firm, the firm’s choice of dividend policy is irrelevant 
and does not affect the initial share price.
17.3  The Tax Disadvantage of Dividends
	
n	 In reality, capital markets are not perfect, and market imperfections affect firm dividend 
policy.
	
n	 If taxes are the only important market imperfection, when the tax rate on dividends exceeds the 
tax rate on capital gains, the optimal dividend policy is for firms to pay no dividends. Firms 
should use share repurchases for all payouts.
17.4  Dividend Capture and Tax Clienteles
	
n	 The effective dividend tax rate, t*d , measures the net tax cost to the investor per dollar of divi-
dend income received:
	
t* d = ¢
t d - t g
1 - t g
≤
(17.3)
	
n	 The effective dividend tax rate varies across investors for several reasons, including income level, 
investment horizon, tax jurisdiction, and type of investment account.
	
n	 Different investor taxes create clientele effects, in which the dividend policy of a firm suits the 
tax preference of its investor clientele.
17.5  Payout Versus Retention of Cash
	
n	 Modigliani-Miller payout policy irrelevance says that, in perfect capital markets, if a firm invests 
excess cash flows in financial securities, the firm’s choice of payout versus retention is irrelevant 
and does not affect the value of the firm.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.

	
Key Terms

n	 Corporate taxes make it costly for a firm to retain excess cash. Even after adjusting for investor 
taxes, retaining excess cash brings a substantial tax disadvantage for a firm. The effective tax 
disadvantage of retaining cash is given by
	
t*retain = ¢1 -
(1 - tc )(1 - tg)
(1 - ti )
≤
(17.7)
	
n	 Even though there is a tax disadvantage to retaining cash, some firms accumulate cash balances. 
Cash balances help firms minimize the transaction costs of raising new capital when they have 
future potential cash needs. However, there is no benefit to shareholders from firms holding 
cash in excess of future investment needs.
	
n	 In addition to the tax disadvantage of holding cash, agency costs may arise, as managers may 
be tempted to spend excess cash on inefficient investments and perks. Without pressure from 
shareholders, managers may choose to horde cash to spend in this way or as a means of reducing 
a firm’s leverage and increasing their job security.
	
n	 Dividends and share repurchases help minimize the agency problem of wasteful spending when a 
firm has excess cash. They also reduce the transfer of value to debt holders or other stakeholders.
	
n	 Firms typically maintain relatively constant dividends. This practice is called dividend 
smoothing.
17.6  Signaling with Payout Policy
	
n	 The idea that dividend changes reflect managers’ views about firms’ future earnings prospects is 
called the dividend signaling hypothesis.
n	 Managers usually increase dividends only when they are confident the firm will be able to 
afford higher dividends for the foreseeable future.
n	 When managers cut the dividend, it may signal that they have lost hope that earnings will 
improve.
	
n	 Share repurchases may be used to signal positive information, as repurchases are more attractive 
if management believes the stock is undervalued at its current price.
17.7  Stock Dividends, Splits, and Spin-Offs
	
n	 With a stock dividend, shareholders receive either additional shares of stock of the firm itself 
(a stock split) or shares of a subsidiary (a spin-off⁜渠屮⁜渠屮⁜渠屮). The stock price generally falls proportion-
ally with the size of the split.
	
n	 A reverse split decreases the number of shares outstanding, and therefore results in a higher 
share price.

Dividend Capture and Tax Clienteles
	
13.	 What was the effective dividend tax rate for a U.S. investor in the highest tax bracket who 
planned to hold a stock for one year in 1981? How did the effective dividend tax rate change in 
1982 when the Reagan tax cuts took effect? (Ignore state taxes.)
	
14.	 The dividend tax cut passed in 2003 lowered the effective dividend tax rate for a U.S. investor 
in the highest tax bracket to a historic low. During which other periods in the last 35 years was 
the effective dividend tax rate as low?
	
15.	 Suppose that all capital gains are taxed at a 24% rate, and that the dividend tax rate is 38%. 
Arbuckle Corp. is currently trading for $32 and is about to pay a $4 special dividend.
a.	 Absent any other trading frictions or news, what will its share price be just after the dividend 
is paid?
Suppose Arbuckle made a surprise announcement that it would do a share repurchase rather 
than pay a special dividend.
b.	 What net tax savings per share for an investor would result from this decision?
c.	 What would happen to Arbuckle’s stock price upon the announcement of this change?
	
16.	 You purchased CSH stock for $34 one year ago and it is now selling for $46. The company has 
announced that it plans a $12 special dividend. You are considering whether to sell the stock 
now or wait to receive the dividend and then sell.
a.	 Assuming 2008 tax rates, what ex-dividend price of CSH will make you indifferent between 
selling now and waiting?
b.	 Suppose the capital gains tax rate is 20% and the dividend tax rate is 38%, what ex-dividend 
price would make you indifferent now?
	
17.	 On Monday, November 15, 2004, TheStreet.com reported: “An experiment in the efficiency of 
financial markets will play out Monday following the expiration of a $3.08 dividend privilege 
for holders of Microsoft.” The story went on: “The stock is currently trading ex-­dividend both 
the special $3 payout and Microsoft’s regular $0.08 quarterly dividend, meaning a buyer doesn’t 
receive the money if he acquires the shares now.” Microsoft stock ultimately opened for trade at 
$27.34 on the ex-dividend date (November 15), down $2.63 from its previous close.
a.	 Assuming that this price drop resulted only from the dividend payment (no other informa-
tion affected the stock price that day), what does this decline in price imply about the effec-
tive dividend tax rate for Microsoft?
b.	 Based on this information, which of the following investors are most likely to be the marginal 
investors (the ones who determine the price) in Microsoft stock:  i.  long-term individual 
investors,   ii.  one-year individual investors,   iii.  pension funds,  iv.  corporations
	
18.	 At current tax rates, which of the following investors are most likely to hold a stock that has a high 
­dividend yield:
a.  individual investors,    b.  pension funds,    c.  mutual funds,    d.  corporations
	
19.	 Que Corporation pays a regular dividend of $1 per share. Typically, the stock price drops by 
$0.84 per share when the stock goes ex-dividend. Suppose the capital gains tax rate is 18%, 
but investors pay different tax rates on dividends. Absent transactions costs, what is the highest 
dividend tax rate of an investor who could gain from trading to capture the dividend?

	
20.	 A stock that you know is held by long-term individual investors paid a large one-time dividend. 
You notice that the price drop on the ex-dividend date is about the size of the dividend pay-
ment. You find this relationship puzzling given the tax disadvantage of dividends. Explain how 
the dividend-capture theory might account for this behavior.
Payout Versus Retention of Cash
	
21.	 Clovix Corporation has $43 million in cash, 11 million shares outstanding, and a current share 
price of $25. Clovix is deciding whether to use the $43 million to pay an immediate special 
dividend of $3.91 per share, or to retain and invest it at the risk-free rate of 10% and use the 
$4.30 million in interest earned to increase its regular annual dividend of $0.39 per share. 
Assume perfect capital markets.
a.	 Suppose Clovix pays the special dividend. How can a shareholder who would prefer an 
increase in the regular dividend create it on her own?
b.	 Suppose Clovix increases its regular dividend. How can a shareholder who would prefer the 
special dividend create it on her own?
	
22.	 Assume capital markets are perfect. Kay Industries currently has $100 million invested in short-
term Treasury securities paying 7%, and it pays out the interest payments on these securities 
each year as a dividend. The board is considering selling the Treasury securities and paying out 
the proceeds as a one-time dividend payment.
a.	 If the board went ahead with this plan, what would happen to the value of Kay stock upon 
the announcement of a change in policy?
b.	 What would happen to the value of Kay stock on the ex-dividend date of the one-time 
dividend?
c.	 Given these price reactions, will this decision benefit investors?
	
23.	 Redo Problem 22, but assume that Kay must pay a corporate tax rate of 35%, and investors pay 
no taxes.
	
24.	 Harris Corporation has $243 million in cash and 147 million shares outstanding. Suppose 
the corporate tax rate is 35% and investors pay no taxes on dividends, capital gains, or interest 
income. Investors had expected Harris to pay out the $243 million through a share repurchase. 
Suppose instead that Harris announces it will permanently retain the cash and use the interest 
on the cash to pay a regular dividend. If there are no other benefits of retaining the cash, how 
will Harris’ stock price change upon this announcement?
	
25.	 Redo Problem 22, but assume the following:
a.	 Investors pay a 15% tax on dividends but no capital gains taxes or taxes on interest income, 
and Kay does not pay corporate taxes.
b.	 Investors pay a 15% tax on dividends and capital gains, and a 35% tax on interest income, 
while Kay pays a 35% corporate tax rate.
	
26.	 Raviv Industries has $97 million in cash that it can use for a share repurchase. Suppose instead 
Raviv invests the funds in an account paying 8% interest for one year.
a.	 If the corporate tax rate is 38%, how much additional cash will Raviv have at the end of the 
year net of corporate taxes?
b.	 If investors pay a 18% tax rate on capital gains, by how much will the value of their shares 
have increased, net of capital gains taxes?
c.	 If investors pay a 28% tax rate on interest income, how much would they have had if they 
invested the $97 million on their own?
d.	Suppose Raviv retained the cash so that it would not need to raise new funds from outside 
investors for an expansion it has planned for next year. If it did raise new funds, it would 
have to pay issuance fees. How much does Raviv need to save in issuance fees to make 
retaining the cash beneficial for its investors? (Assume fees can be expensed for corporate tax 
purposes.)

29.	 Why is an announcement of a share repurchase considered a positive signal?
	
*30.	 AMC Corporation currently has an enterprise value of $400 million and $100 million in excess 
cash. The firm has 10 million shares outstanding and no debt. Suppose AMC uses its excess 
cash to repurchase shares. After the share repurchase, news will come out that will change 
AMC’s enterprise value to either $600 million or $200 million.
a.	 What is AMC’s share price prior to the share repurchase?
b.	 What is AMC’s share price after the repurchase if its enterprise value goes up? What is 
AMC’s share price after the repurchase if its enterprise value declines?

price after the repurchase if its enterprise value declines?
d.	Suppose AMC management expects good news to come out. Based on your answers to 
parts (b) and (c), if management desires to maximize AMC’s ultimate share price, will they 
undertake the repurchase before or after the news comes out? When would management 
undertake the repurchase if they expect bad news to come out?

35.	 After the market close on May 11, 2001, Adaptec, Inc., distributed a dividend of shares of the 
stock of its software division, Roxio, Inc. Each Adaptec shareholder received 0.1646 share of 
Roxio stock per share of Adaptec stock owned. At the time, Adaptec stock was trading at a price 
of $10.55 per share (cum-dividend), and Roxio’s share price was $14.23 per share. In a perfect 
market, what would Adaptec’s ex-dividend share price be after this transaction?
Data Case
In your role as a consultant at a wealth management firm, you have been assigned a very powerful 
client who holds one million shares of Cisco Systems, Inc. purchased on February 28, 2003. In 
researching Cisco, you discovered that they are holding a large amount of cash. Additionally, your 
client is upset that the Cisco stock price has been somewhat stagnant as of late. The client is consid-
ering approaching the Board of Directors with a plan for half of the cash the firm has accumulated, 

	
Data Case

but can’t decide whether a share repurchase or a special dividend would be best. You have been asked 
to determine which initiative would generate the greatest amount of money after taxes, assuming 
that with a share repurchase your client would keep the same proportion of ownership. Because both 
dividends and capital gains are taxed at the same rate (20%), your client has assumed that there is 
no difference between the repurchase and the dividend. To confirm, you need to “run the numbers” 
for each scenario.
	
1.	 Go to finance.yahoo.com, enter the symbol for Cisco (CSCO), and click “Key Statistics.”
a.	 Record the current price and the number of shares outstanding.
b.	 Click on “Balance Sheet” under “Financials.” Copy and paste the balance sheet data into Excel.
	
2.	 Using one-half of the most recent cash and cash equivalents reported on the balance sheet (in 
thousands of dollars), compute the following:
a.	 The number of shares that would be repurchased given the current market price.
b.	 The dividend per share that could be paid given the total number of shares outstanding.
	
3.	 Go to finance.yahoo.com to obtain the price at which your client purchased the stock on Febru-
ary 28, 2003.
a.	 Enter the symbol for Cisco and click “Get Quotes.”
b.	 Click “Historical Prices,” enter the date your client purchased the stock as the start date and 
the end date, and hit “Enter.” Record the adjusted closing price.
	
4.	 Compute the total cash that would be received by your client under the repurchase and the divi-
dend both before taxes and after taxes.
	
5.	 The calculation in Step 4 reflects your client’s immediate cash flow and tax liability, but it does not 
consider the final payoff for the client after any shares not sold in a repurchase are liquidated. To 
incorporate this feature, you first decide to see what happens if the client sells all remaining shares of 
stock immediately after the dividend or the repurchase. Assume that the stock price will fall by the 
amount of the dividend if a dividend is paid. What are the client’s total after-tax cash flows (consid-
ering both the payout and the capital gain) under the repurchase of the dividend in this case?
	
6.	 Under which program would your client be better off before taxes? Which program is better after 
taxes, assuming the remaining shares are sold immediately after the dividend is paid?
	
7.	 Because your client is unlikely to sell all 1 million shares today, at the time of dividend/repur-
chase, you decide to consider two longer holding periods: Assume that under both plans the 
client sells all remaining shares of stock 5 years later, or the client sells 10 years later. Assume 
that the stock will return 10% per year going forward. Also assume that Cisco will pay no other 
dividends over the next 10 years.
a.	 What would the stock price be after 5 years or 10 years if a dividend is paid now?
b.	 What would the stock price be after 5 years or 10 years if Amazon repurchases shares now?
c.	 Calculate the total after-tax cash flows at both points in time (when the dividend payment or the 
share repurchase takes place, and when the rest of the shares are sold) for your client if the remain-
ing shares are sold in 5 years under both initiatives. Compute the difference between the cash 
flows under both initiatives at each point in time. Repeat assuming the shares are sold in 10 years.
	
8.	 Repeat Question 7 assuming the stock will return 20% per year going forward. What do you notice 
about the difference in the cash flows under the two initiatives when the return is 20% and 10%?
	
9.	 Calculate the NPV of the difference in the cash flows under both holding period assumptions for a 
range of discount rates. Based on your answer to Question 8, what is the correct discount rate to use?

Study
THE LAW OF ONE PRICE CONNECTION. In this part of the text, we return to 
the topic of valuation and integrate our understanding of risk, return, and the firm’s 
choice of capital structure. Chapter 18 combines the knowledge of the first five parts 
of the text and develops the three main methods for capital budgeting with leverage 
and market imperfections: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) method, the 
adjusted present value (APV) method, and the flow-to-equity (FTE) method. While the 
Law of One Price guarantees that all three methods ultimately lead to the same assess-
ment of value, we will identify conditions that can make one method easiest to apply. 
Chapter 19 applies Chapter 18’s methods of valuation to value a corporation in the 
context of a leveraged acquisition. Chapter 19 thus serves as a capstone case that 
illustrates how all the concepts developed thus far in the text are used to make complex 
real-world financial decisions.

IN FALL 2015, GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY HAD A MARKET 
capitalization of approximately $255 billion. With net debt of over $224 billion, GE’s 
total enterprise value was $479 billion, making it the second most valuable business in 
the world (just behind Apple, and ahead of Alphabet and Exxon Mobil). GE’s businesses 
include power generation and air transportation equipment, health care and medical 
equipment, consumer appliances, and consumer and commercial financing and insur-
ance. With a debt-to-value ratio exceeding 50%, leverage is clearly part of GE’s busi-
ness strategy. How should a firm that uses leverage, like GE, incorporate the costs and 
benefits associated with leverage into its capital budgeting decisions? And how should 
a firm adjust for the differences in risk, and debt capacity, associated with its different 
business activities?
We introduced capital budgeting in Chapter 7. There, we outlined the following 
basic procedure: First, we estimate the incremental free cash flow generated by the proj-
ect; then we discount the free cash flow based on the project’s cost of capital to deter-
mine the NPV. Thus far, we have focused on all-equity financed projects. In this chapter, 
we integrate the lessons from Parts 4 and 5 into our capital budgeting framework and 
consider alternative financing arrangements. In particular, we address how the financing 
decision of the firm can affect both the cost of capital and the set of cash flows that we 
ultimately discount.
We begin by introducing the three main methods for capital budgeting with lever-
age and market imperfections: the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) method, 
the adjusted present value (APV) method, and the flow-to-equity (FTE) method. While 
their details differ, when appropriately applied each method produces the same estimate 
of an investment’s (or firm’s) value. As we shall see, the choice of method is thus guided 
by which is the simplest to use in a given setting. Ultimately, we will develop recom-
mendations regarding the best method to use depending on the firm’s financing policy.

18.1  Overview of Key Concepts	
673
Throughout this chapter, we focus on the intuition and implementation of the main capital bud-
geting methods. The appendix to this chapter provides additional details about the justification for 
and assumptions behind some of the results we use in the chapter. It also introduces advanced compu-
tational techniques that can be used in Excel to solve for leverage and value simultaneously.
	
18.1	 Overview of Key Concepts
We introduce the three main methods of capital budgeting in Sections 18.2 through 18.4. 
Before we turn to the specifics, we will revisit some important ideas we encountered earlier 
in the text that underpin the valuation methods.
Chapter 15 demonstrated that because interest payments are deductible as an expense 
for the corporation, debt financing creates a valuable interest tax shield for the firm. We 
can include the value of this tax shield in the capital budgeting decision in several ways. 
First, we can use the WACC method, explained in Section 18.2, in which we discount 
the unlevered free cash flows using the weighted-average cost of capital, or WACC. 
Because we calculate the WACC using the effective after-tax interest rate as the cost 
of debt, this method incorporates the tax benefit of debt implicitly through the cost of 
capital.
Alternatively, we can first value a project’s free cash flows without leverage by discount-
ing them using the unlevered cost of capital. We can then separately estimate and add the 
present value of the interest tax shields from debt. This method, in which we explicitly add 
the value of the interest tax shields to the project’s unlevered value, is called the adjusted 
present value (APV) method, which we explain in Section 18.3.
Our third method makes use of the observation in Chapter 9 that rather than value the 
firm based on its free cash flows, we can also value its equity based on the total payouts 
to shareholders. The flow-to-equity (FTE) method, introduced in Section 18.4, applies this 
idea to value the incremental payouts to equity associated with a project.
To illustrate these methods most clearly, we begin the chapter by applying each method 
to a single example in which we have made a number of simplifying assumptions:
	
1.	 The project has average risk. We assume initially that the market risk of the project 
is equivalent to the average market risk of the firm’s investments. In that case, the 
project’s cost of capital can be assessed based on the risk of the firm.
	
2.	 The firm’s debt-equity ratio is constant. Initially, we consider a firm that adjusts its 
leverage to maintain a constant debt-equity ratio in terms of market values. This 
policy determines the amount of debt the firm will take on when it accepts a new 
project. It also implies that the risk of the firm’s equity and debt, and therefore its 
weighted average cost of capital, will not fluctuate due to leverage changes.
	
3.	 Corporate taxes are the only imperfection. We assume initially that the main effect of 
leverage on valuation is due to the corporate tax shield. We ignore personal taxes 
and issuance costs, and we assume that other imperfections (such as financial dis-
tress or agency costs) are not significant at the level of debt chosen.
While these assumptions are restrictive, they are also a reasonable approximation for 
many projects and firms. The first assumption is likely to fit typical projects of firms with 
investments concentrated in a single industry. The second assumption, while unlikely to 
hold exactly, reflects the fact that firms tend to increase their levels of debt as they grow 
larger; some may even have an explicit target for their debt-equity ratio. Finally, for firms 

674	
Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
without very high levels of debt, the interest tax shield is likely to be the most important 
market imperfection affecting the capital budgeting decision. Hence, the third assumption 
is a reasonable starting point to begin our analysis.
Of course, while these three assumptions are reasonable in many situations, there are 
certainly projects and firms for which they do not apply. The remainder of the chapter 
therefore relaxes these assumptions and shows how to generalize the methods to more com-
plicated settings. In Section 18.5, we adjust these methods for projects whose risk or debt 
capacity is substantially different from the rest of the firm. These adjustments are especially 
important for multidivisional firms, such as GE. In Section 18.6, we consider alternative 
leverage policies for the firm (rather than maintaining a constant debt-equity ratio) and 
adapt the APV method to handle such cases. We consider the consequence of other market 
imperfections, such as issuance, distress, and agency costs, on valuation in Section 18.7. 
Finally, in Section 18.8, we investigate a number of advanced topics, including periodically 
adjusted leverage policies and the effect of investor taxes.
Concept Check	
1.	 What are the three methods we can use to include the value of the tax shield in the capital budget-
ing decision?
	
2.	 In what situation is the risk of a project likely to match that of the overall firm?
	
18.2	 The Weighted Average Cost of Capital Method
The WACC method takes the interest tax shield into account by using the after-tax cost 
of capital as the discount rate. When the market risk of the project is similar to the average 
market risk of the firm’s investments, then its cost of capital is equal to the firm’s weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC). As we showed in Chapter 15, the WACC incorporates the 
benefit of the interest tax shield by using the firm’s after-tax cost of capital for debt:
	
rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD(1 - tc)	
(18.1)
In this formula,
 E = market value of equity	
 rE = equity cost of capital
 D = market value of debt (net of cash)	
 rD = debt cost of capital
 tc = marginal corporate tax rate
For now, we assume that the firm maintains a constant debt-equity ratio and that the 
WACC calculated in Eq. 18.1 remains constant over time. Because the WACC incorpo-
rates the tax savings from debt, we can compute the levered value of an investment, which 
is its value including the benefit of interest tax shields given the firm’s leverage policy, by 
discounting its future free cash flow using the WACC. Specifically, if FCFt is the expected 
free cash flow of an investment at the end of year t, then the investment’s initial levered 
value, V L

became CFO, and then as CFO of 
United ­Continental Holdings, Inc.
QUESTION:  When developing a model 
to analyze a new investment, how do 
you deal with the uncertainty around 
future cash flows? Does it differ with new 
technologies?
ANSWER: Dealing with uncertainty is an art as well as a 
science. Companies must take on risk to grow, and that 
requires a solid investment strategy. The model should 
support the strategy, not drive it. You can fixate on the 
model and whether the WACC is 2 points too high or too 
low, however what’s more important is having a team that 
understands the business proposition and key drivers, such 
as top-line growth and the expected business environment. 
By choosing the right inputs for the model, they develop 
appropriate scenarios to help make the decision.
In the case of an airline’s fleet acquisition, you could be 
fine-tuning a well-defined model with more certain inputs. 
If you acquire another company—in any industry—you 
focus on the business rationale for the investment. This 
involves much greater uncertainty.
QUESTION:  How does the capital budgeting process differ at 
VMware versus United Continental?
ANSWER: A mature, capital-intensive, lower margin com-
pany such as an airline may emphasize more traditional 
measures such as NPV, IRR, and WACC. It has more his-
tory and lower volatility on the inputs for assumptions—
and thus less variability. Airline expenditures can be very 
large, for example, the decision to purchase or lease new 
aircraft. The WACC and the timing of cash flows often 
drive the analysis.
With technology, it’s sometimes more difficult to quan-
tify the expected impact of a new product or acquisition. 
We adapt our model to include more variability and place 
greater focus on revenue growth and margin assumptions 
than on certain more detailed factors such as components 
of WACC. These tend to be more important drivers of the 
investment’s overall value than the 
precise cost of capital.
QUESTION:  What key financial metrics 
do you use to make investment decisions? 
How does it differ between these firms?  
ANSWER: Regardless of the type of 
company—public or private, technol-
ogy or capital-intensive—both the 
fundamentals and metrics are impor-
tant. Capital budgeting models are 
only as good as their inputs. The most 
important element is engaging with all 
business units affected by the invest-
ment to ensure the right variables are 
in the model. 
At the airline we looked at traditional metrics such 
as NPV and IRR, driven by the right WACC, as well as 
market multiples. A tech company will use some of those 
variables, too, but weight them differently. Top-line 
assumptions such as revenue and margins may carry a larger 
weight on the ultimate decision. Also, every capital budget-
ing decision must take into account the competitive and 
economic environments, the company’s growth rate, and 
geographic risk.
QUESTION:  What is the importance of considering Free Cash 
Flows as opposed to just the earnings implications of a finan-
cial decision?
ANSWER: Free cash flow (FCF) is important regardless 
of type of company or industry. Both FCF and earnings 
affect a financial decision. The airline business can be more 
sensitive to FCF than earnings, depending on the stage 
of the business cycle. We went through challenging peri-
ods—9/11, oil shocks, financial crisis—where FCF was 
the decision driver because of our highly levered balance 
sheet. We may choose a project that is FCF positive but 
has a minimal or potentially negative short-term impact 
on earnings.
In technology, FCF carries a fair amount of weight, 
too. That said, we communicate a number of variables and 
financial drivers to our analyst and investor base. When 
earnings and FCF don’t perfectly align, we convey the 
purpose of our decision in greater detail. In an industry 
or company with a higher growth profile, you have more 
flexibility to continue to make investments that help drive 
future growth, placing less emphasis on the details of the 
capital budgeting model itself.

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
Using the WACC to Value a Project
Let’s apply the WACC method to value a project. Avco, Inc., is a manufacturer of custom 
packaging products. Avco is considering introducing a new line of packaging, the RFX 
series, that will include an embedded radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, which is 
a miniature radio antenna and transponder that allows a package to be tracked much more 
efficiently and with fewer errors than standard bar codes.
Avco engineers expect the technology used in these products to become obsolete 
after four years. During the next four years, however, the marketing group expects 
annual sales of $60 million per year for this product line. Manufacturing costs and 
operating expenses are expected to be $25 million and $9 million, respectively, per 
year. Developing the product will require upfront R&D and marketing expenses of 
$6.67 million, together with a $24 million investment in equipment. The equipment 
will be obsolete in four years and will be depreciated via the straight-line method over 
that period. Avco bills the majority of its customers in advance, and it expects no net 
working capital requirements for the project. Avco pays a corporate tax rate of 40%. 
Given this information, the spreadsheet in Table 18.1 forecasts the project’s expected 
free cash flow.2
The market risk of the RFX project is expected to be similar to that for the company’s 
other lines of business. Thus, we can use Avco’s equity and debt to determine the weighted 
average cost of capital for the new project. Table 18.2 shows Avco’s current market value 
balance sheet and equity and debt costs of capital. Avco has built up $20 million in cash for 
investment needs, so that its net debt is D = 320 - 20 = $300 million. Avco’s enterprise 
value, which is the market value of its non-cash assets, is E + D = $600 million. Avco 
intends to maintain a similar (net) debt-equity ratio for the foreseeable future, including 
any financing related to the RFX project.

18.2  The Weighted Average Cost of Capital Method	
677
With this capital structure, Avco’s weighted average cost of capital is
 rwacc =

E + D
 rD(1 - tc) = 300
600
 (10.0%) + 300
600
 (6.0%)(1 - 0.40)
 = 6.8%
We can determine the value of the project, including the tax shield from debt, by 
­calculating the present value of its future free cash flows, V L
0, using the WACC:
V L
0 =

1.068 +
18
1.0682 +
18
1.0683 +
18
1.0684 = $61.25 million
Because the upfront cost of launching the product line is only $28 million, this project is a good 
idea—taking the project results in an NPV of 61.25 - 28 = $33.25 million for the firm.
Summary of the WACC Method
To summarize, the key steps in the WACC valuation method are as follows:
	
1.	 Determine the free cash flow of the investment.
	
2.	 Compute the weighted average cost of capital using Eq. 18.1.
	
3.	 Compute the value of the investment, including the tax benefit of leverage, by dis-
counting the free cash flow of the investment using the WACC.
In many firms, the corporate treasurer performs the second step, calculating the firm’s 
WACC. This rate can then be used throughout the firm as the companywide cost of ­capital 
for new investments that are of comparable risk to the rest of the firm and that will not alter 
the firm’s debt-equity ratio. Employing the WACC method in this way is very simple and 
straightforward. As a result, it is the method that is most commonly used in practice for 
capital budgeting purposes.
Example 18.1
Valuing an Acquisition Using the WACC Method
Problem
Suppose Avco is considering the acquisition of another firm in its industry that specializes in cus-
tom packaging. The acquisition is expected to increase Avco’s free cash flow by $3.8 million the 
first year, and this contribution is expected to grow at a rate of 3% per year from then on. Avco 
has negotiated a purchase price of $80 million. After the transaction, Avco will adjust its capital

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
Implementing a Constant Debt-Equity Ratio
Thus far, we have simply assumed the firm adopted a policy of keeping its debt-equity 
ratio constant. In fact, an important advantage of the WACC method is that you do not 
need to know how this leverage policy is implemented in order to make the capital budget-
ing decision. Nevertheless, keeping the debt-equity ratio constant has implications for how 
the firm’s total debt will change with new investment. For example, Avco currently has a 
debt-equity ratio of 300/300 = 1 or, equivalently, a debt-to-value ratio [D/(E + D)] of 
50%. To maintain this ratio, the firm’s new investments must be financed with debt equal 
to 50% of their market value.
By undertaking the RFX project, Avco adds new assets to the firm with initial market 
value V L
0 = $61.25 million. Therefore, to maintain its debt-to-value ratio, Avco must add 
50% * 61.25 = $30.625 million in new net debt.3 Avco can add this net debt either by 
reducing cash or by borrowing and increasing debt. Suppose Avco decides to spend its $20 
million in cash and borrow an additional $10.625 million. Because only $28 million is 
required to fund the project, Avco will pay the remaining 30.625 - 28 = $2.625 million 
to shareholders through a dividend (or share repurchase). Table 18.3 shows Avco’s market 
value balance sheet with the RFX project in this case.
3We can also evaluate the project’s debt as follows: Of the $28 million upfront cost of the project, 50% 
($14 million) will be financed with debt. In addition, the project generates an NPV of $33.25 million, 
which will increase the market value of the firm. To maintain a debt-equity ratio of 1, Avco must add debt 
of 50% * 33.25 = $16.625 million at the time when the NPV of the project is anticipated (which could 
occur before the new investment is made). Thus, the total new debt is 14 + 16.625 = $30.625 million.
structure to maintain its current debt-equity ratio. If the acquisition has similar risk to the rest of 
Avco, what is the value of this deal?
Solution
The free cash flows of the acquisition can be valued as a growing perpetuity. Because its risk 
matches the risk for the rest of Avco, and because Avco will maintain the same debt-equity ratio 
going forward, we can discount these cash flows using the WACC of 6.8%. Thus, the value of 
the acquisition is
V L =
3.8
6.8% - 3% = $100 million
Given the purchase price of $80 million, the acquisition has an NPV of $20 million.

Example 18.2
Debt Capacity for an Acquisition
Problem
Suppose Avco proceeds with the acquisition described in Example 18.1. How much debt must 
Avco use to finance the acquisition and still maintain its debt-to-value ratio? How much of the 
acquisition cost must be financed with equity?
Solution
From the solution to Example 18.2, the market value of the assets acquired in the acquisition, V L, is 
$100 million. Thus, to maintain a 50% debt-to-value ratio, Avco must increase its debt by $50 million. 
The remaining $30 million of the $80 million acquisition cost will be financed with new equity. In 
addition to the $30 million in new equity, the value of Avco’s existing shares will increase by the $20 
million NPV of the acquisition, so in total the market value of Avco’s equity will rise by $50 million.

This financing plan maintains Avco’s 50% debt-to-value ratio. The market value of 
Avco’s equity increases by 330.625 - 300 = $30.625 million. Adding the dividend of 
$2.625 million, the shareholders’ total gain is 30.625 + 2.625 = $33.25 million, which is 
exactly the NPV we calculated for the RFX project.
What happens over the life of the project? First, we define an investment’s debt ­capacity, 
Dt , as the amount of debt at date t that is required to maintain the firm’s target debt-to-
value ratio, d. If V L
t , is the project’s levered continuation value on date t—that is, the 
levered value of its free cash flow after date t—then
	
Dt = d * V L
t 	
(18.3)
We compute the debt capacity for the RFX project in the spreadsheet in Table 18.4. 
Starting with the project’s free cash flow, we compute its levered continuation value at 
each date (line 2) by discounting the future free cash flow at the WACC as in Eq. 18.2. 
Because the continuation value at each date includes the value of all subsequent cash flows, 
it is even simpler to compute the value at each date by working backward from period 4, 
discounting next period’s free cash flow and continuation value:

FCFt +1  
+ V L

(18.4)
Once we have computed the project’s value V L
t  at each date, we apply Eq. 18.3 to com-
pute the project’s debt capacity at each date (line 3). As the spreadsheet shows, the project’s 
debt capacity declines each year, and falls to zero by the end of year 4.

18.3	 The Adjusted Present Value Method
The adjusted present value (APV ⁜渠屮) method is an alternative valuation method in which 
we determine the levered value V L of an investment by first calculating its unlevered value 
V U, which is its value without any leverage, and then adding the value of the interest tax 
shield. That is, as we showed in Chapter 15:4
The APV Formula
	
V L = APV = V U + PV (Interest Tax Shield)	
(18.5)
As we did with the WACC method, we focus solely on the corporate tax benefits of debt 
for now and defer the discussion of other consequences of leverage to Section 18.7. As 
Eq. 18.5 shows, the APV method incorporates the value of the interest tax shield directly, 
rather than by adjusting the discount rate as in the WACC method. Let’s demonstrate the 
APV method by returning to Avco’s RFX project.
The Unlevered Value of the Project
From the free cash flow estimates in Table 18.1, the RFX project has an upfront cost of 
$28 million, and it generates $18 million per year in free cash flow for the next four years. 
The first step in the APV method is to calculate the value of these free cash flows using the 
project’s cost of capital if it were financed without leverage.
What is the project’s unlevered cost of capital? Because the RFX project has similar risk 
to Avco’s other investments, its unlevered cost of capital is the same as for the firm as a 
whole. Thus, as we did in Chapter 12, we can calculate the unlevered cost of capital using 
Avco’s pretax WACC, the average return the firm’s investors expect to earn:
Unlevered Cost of Capital with a Target Leverage Ratio
	
rU =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD = Pretax WACC	
(18.6)
To understand why the firm’s unlevered cost of capital equals its pretax WACC, note 
that the pretax WACC represents investors’ required return for holding the entire firm 
(equity and debt). Thus, it will depend only on the firm’s overall risk. So long as the firm’s 
leverage choice does not change the overall risk of the firm, the pretax WACC must be the 
same whether the firm is levered or unlevered—recall Figure 15.2 on page 559.
Of course, this argument relies on the assumption that the overall risk of the firm is 
independent of the choice of leverage. As we showed in Chapter 14, this assumption always 
holds in a perfect market. It will also hold in a world with taxes whenever the risk of the 
tax shield is the same as the risk of the firm (so the size of the tax shield will not change the 
overall riskiness of the firm). In this chapter’s appendix, we show that the tax shield will have 
the same risk as the firm if the firm maintains a target leverage ratio. A target leverage ratio

Financing and Investment Decisions—Implications for Capital Budgeting,” Journal of Finance 29 (1974): 
1–25.

	
18.3  The Adjusted Present Value Method

means that the firm adjusts its debt proportionally to the project’s value, or its cash flows, 
so that a constant debt-equity ratio is a special case.
Applying Eq. 18.6 to Avco, we find its unlevered cost of capital to be
rU = 0.50 * 10.0% + 0.50 * 6.0% = 8.0%
Avco’s unlevered cost of capital is less than its equity cost of capital of 10.0% (which 
includes the financial risk of leverage), but is more than its WACC of 6.8% (which incor-
porates the tax benefit of leverage).
Given our estimate of the unlevered cost of capital rU and the project’s free cash flows, 
we calculate the project’s value without leverage:
V U = 18

Valuing the Interest Tax Shield
The value of the unlevered project, V U, calculated above does not include the value of 
the tax shield provided by the interest payments on debt—it is the value of the project 
were it purely equity financed. Given the project’s debt capacity from Table 18.4, we can 
estimate the expected interest payments and the tax shield as shown in the spreadsheet in 
Table 18.5. The interest paid in year t is estimated based on the amount of debt outstand-
ing at the end of the prior year:
	
Interest paid in year t = rD * Dt - 1	
(18.7)
The interest tax shield is equal to the interest paid multiplied by the corporate tax rate tc .

To compute the present value of the interest tax shield, we need to determine the appropri-
ate cost of capital. The interest tax shields shown in Table 18.5 are expected values, and the 
true amount of the interest tax shield each year will vary with the cash flows of the project. 
Because Avco maintains a fixed debt-equity ratio, if the project does well, its value will be 
higher, it will support more debt, and the interest tax shield will be higher. If the project goes 
poorly, its value will fall, Avco will reduce its debt level, and the interest tax shield will be lower. 
Thus, the tax shield will fluctuate with, and therefore share the risk of, the project itself:5
When the firm maintains a target leverage ratio, its future interest tax shields have similar 
risk to the project’s cash flows, so they should be discounted at the project’s unlevered cost of 
capital.
5In Section 18.6, we consider the case in which the debt levels are fixed in advance, and so do not fluctuate 
with the project cash flows. As we will see, in that case the tax shield has lower risk, and thus a lower cost 
of capital, than the project.

682	
Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
For Avco’s RFX project, we have
PV(interest tax shield) = 0.73
1.08 + 0.57
1.082 + 0.39
1.083 + 0.20
1.084 = $1.63 million
To determine the value of the project with leverage, we add the value of the interest tax 
shield to the unlevered value of the project:6
V L = V U + PV (interest tax shield) = 59.62 + 1.63 = $61.25 million
Again, given the $28 million initial investment required, the RFX project has an NPV with 
leverage of 61.25 - 28 = $33.25 million, which matches precisely the value we computed 
in Section 18.2 using the WACC approach.
Summary of the APV Method
To determine the value of a levered investment using the APV method, we proceed as 
follows:
	
1.	 Determine the investment’s value without leverage, V U, by discounting its free 
cash flows at the unlevered cost of capital, rU. With a constant debt-equity ratio, rU 
may be estimated using Eq. 18.6.
	
2.	 Determine the present value of the interest tax shield.
a.	 Determine the expected interest tax shield: Given expected debt Dt on date t, 
the interest tax shield on date t + 1 is tc rD Dt .7
b.	 Discount the interest tax shield. If a constant debt-equity ratio is maintained, 
using rU is appropriate.
6Because we are using the same discount rate for the free cash flow and the tax shield, the cash flows of 
the project and the tax shield can be combined first and then discounted at the rate rU. These combined 
cash flows are also referred to as the capital cash flows (CCF): CCF = FCF + Interest Tax Shield. This 
method is known as the CCF or “compressed APV” method [see S. Kaplan and R. Ruback, “The Valu-
ation of Cash Flow Forecasts: An Empirical Analysis,” Journal of Finance 50 (1995): 1059–1093; and 
R. Ruback, “Capital Cash Flows: A Simple Approach to Valuing Risky Cash Flows,” Financial Manage-
ment 31 (2002): 85–103].
7The return on the debt need not come solely from interest payments, so this value is an approximation. 
The same approximation is implicit in the definition of the WACC (for additional precision, see footnote 
27 in this chapter’s appendix).
Example 18.3
Risk of Tax Shields with a Constant Debt-Equity Ratio
Problem
Suppose ABC Corporation maintains a constant debt-equity ratio of 1, the current total value 
of the firm is $100 million, and its existing debt is riskless. Over the next month news will come 
out that will either raise or lower ABC’s value by 20%. How will ABC adjust its debt level in 
response? What can you conclude about the risk of its interest tax shields?
Solution
Originally ABC has $50 million in equity and $50 million in debt. Once the news comes out, 
ABC’s value will rise to $120 million or fall to $80 million. Thus, to maintain a debt equity ratio 
of 1, ABC will either increase its debt level to $60 million or decrease it to $40 million. Because 
the firm’s interest payments and tax shield will fall proportionally, they have the same risk as the 
overall firm.

	
18.3  The Adjusted Present Value Method	
683
	
3.	 Add the unlevered value, V U, to the present value of the interest tax shield to deter-
mine the value of the investment with leverage, V L.
In this case, the APV method is more complicated than the WACC method because we 
must compute two separate valuations: the unlevered project and the interest tax shield. 
Furthermore, in this example, to determine the project’s debt capacity for the interest tax 
shield calculation, we relied on the calculation in Table 18.4, which depended on the value 
of the project. Thus, we need to know the debt level to compute the APV, but with a con-
stant debt-equity ratio we need to know the project’s value to compute the debt level. As a 
result, implementing the APV approach with a constant debt-equity ratio requires solving 
for the project’s debt and value simultaneously. (See this chapter’s appendix for an example 
of this calculation.)
Despite its complexity, the APV method has some advantages. As we shall see in Sec-
tion 18.6, it can be easier to apply than the WACC method when the firm does not main-
tain a constant debt-equity ratio. It also provides managers with an explicit valuation of the 
tax shield itself. In the case of Avco’s RFX project, the benefit of the interest tax shield is 
relatively small. Even if tax rates were to change, or if Avco decided for other reasons not 
to increase its debt, the profitability of the project would not be jeopardized. However, 
this need not always be the case. Consider again the acquisition in Example 18.1, where 
the APV method makes clear that the gain from the acquisition crucially depends on the 
interest tax shield.
Example 18.4
Using the APV Method to Value an Acquisition
Problem
Consider again Avco’s acquisition from Examples 18.1 and 18.2. The acquisition will contribute 
$3.8 million in free cash flows the first year, which will grow by 3% per year thereafter. The 
acquisition cost of $80 million will be financed with $50 million in new debt initially. Compute 
the value of the acquisition using the APV method, assuming Avco will maintain a constant 
debt-equity ratio for the acquisition.
Solution
First, we compute the value without leverage. Given Avco’s unlevered cost of capital of rU = 8%, 
we get
V U = 3.8/(8% - 3%) = $76 million
Avco will add new debt of $50 million initially to fund the acquisition. At a 6% interest rate, 
the interest expense the first year is 6% * 50 = $3 million, which provides an interest tax shield 
of 40% * 3 = $1.2 million. Because the value of the acquisition is expected to grow by 3% per 
year, the amount of debt the acquisition supports—and, therefore, the interest tax shield—is 
expected to grow at the same rate. The present value of the interest tax shield is
PV (interest tax shield) = 1.2/(8% - 3%) = $24 million
The value of the acquisition with leverage is given by the APV:
V L = V U +  PV (interest tax shield) = 76 + 24 = $100 million
This value is identical to the value computed in Example 18.1 and implies an NPV of 
100 - 80 = $20 million for the acquisition. Without the benefit of the interest tax shield, the 
NPV would be 76 - 80 = -$4 million.

We can easily extend the APV approach to include other market imperfections such 
as financial distress, agency, and issuance costs. We discuss these complexities further in 
Section 18.7.

1.	 Describe the adjusted present value (APV) method.
	
2.	 At what rate should we discount the interest tax shield when a firm maintains a target leverage ratio?
	
18.4	 The Flow-to-Equity Method
In the WACC and APV methods, we value a project based on its free cash flow, which is 
computed ignoring interest and debt payments. Some students find these methods confus-
ing because, if the goal is to determine the benefit of the project to shareholders, it seems to 
them that we should focus on the cash flows that shareholders will receive.
In the flow-to-equity (FTE) valuation method, we explicitly calculate the free cash flow 
available to equity holders after taking into account all payments to and from debt holders. 
The cash flows to equity holders are then discounted using the equity cost of capital.8 
Despite this difference in implementation, the FTE method produces the same assessment 
of the project’s value as the WACC or APV methods.
Calculating the Free Cash Flow to Equity
The first step in the FTE method is to determine the project’s free cash flow to equity 
(FCFE). The FCFE is the free cash flow that remains after adjusting for interest payments, 
debt issuance, and debt repayment. The spreadsheet shown in Table 18.6 calculates the 
FCFE for Avco’s RFX project.
8The FTE approach generalizes the total payout method for valuing the firm described in Chapter 9. In 
that method, we value the total dividends and repurchases that the firm pays to shareholders. It is also 
equivalent to the residual income valuation method used in accounting (see appendix).

Free Cash Flow to Equity
2.62 
  9.98 
9.76 
9.52 
9.27 
As an alternative to Table 18.6, we can compute a project’s FCFE directly from its free 
cash flow. Because interest payments are deducted before taxes in line 7, we adjust the 
firm’s FCF by their after-tax cost. We then add net borrowing to determine FCFE:
Free Cash Flow to Equity
	
FCFE = FCF - (1 - tc) * (Interest Payments) + (Net Borrowing)
(18.9)
We illustrate this alternative calculation for Avco’s RFX project in Table 18.7. Note that 
the project’s FCFE is lower than its FCF in years 1 through 4 due to the interest and princi-
pal payments on the debt. In year 0, however, the proceeds from the loan more than offset 
the negative free cash flow, so FCFE is positive (and equal to the dividend we calculated in 
Section 18.2).
Valuing Equity Cash Flows
The project’s free cash flow to equity shows the expected amount of additional cash the 
firm will have available to pay dividends (or conduct share repurchases) each year. Because 
these cash flows represent payments to equity holders, they should be discounted at the 
project’s equity cost of capital. Given that the risk and leverage of the RFX project are the 
same as for Avco overall, we can use Avco’s equity cost of capital of rE = 10.0% to dis-
count the project’s FCFE:
NPV(FCFE ) = 2.62 + 9.98
1.10 + 9.76
1.102 + 9.52
1.103 + 9.27
1.104 = $33.25 million
¸˚˚˚˚˝˚˚˚˚˛
After-tax interest expense
Comparing the FCFE estimates in Table  18.6 with the free cash flow estimates in 
Table 18.1, we notice two changes. First, we deduct interest expenses (from Table 18.5) on 
line 7, before taxes. As a consequence, we compute the incremental net income of the project 
on line 10, rather than its unlevered net income as we do when computing free cash flows. 
The second change is line 14, where we add the proceeds from the firm’s net borrowing activ-
ity. These proceeds are positive when the firm increases its net debt; they are negative when 
the firm reduces its net debt by repaying principal (or retaining cash). For the RFX project, 
Avco issues $30.62 million in debt initially. At date 1, however, the debt capacity of the proj-
ect falls to $23.71 million (see Table 18.4), so that Avco must repay 30.62 - 23.71 = $6.91 
million of the debt.9 In general, given the project’s debt capacity Dt ,
	
Net Borrowing at Date t = Dt - Dt -1	
(18.8)
9The $0.01 million difference in the spreadsheet is due to rounding.

686	
Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
The value of the project’s FCFE represents the gain to shareholders from the project. It is 
identical to the NPV we computed using the WACC and APV methods.
Why isn’t the project’s NPV lower now that we have deducted interest and debt payments 
from the cash flows? Recall that these costs of debt are offset by cash received when the debt is 
issued. Looking back at Table 18.6, the cash flows from debt in lines 7 and 14 have an NPV 
of zero assuming the debt is fairly priced.10 In the end, the only effect on value comes from a 
reduction in the tax payments, leaving the same result as with the other methods.
Summary of the Flow-to-Equity Method
The key steps in the flow-to-equity method for valuing a levered investment are as follows:
	
1.	 Determine the free cash flow to equity of the investment using Eq. 18.9.
	
2.	 Determine the equity cost of capital, rE.
	
3.	 Compute the contribution to equity value, E, by discounting the free cash flow to 
equity using the equity cost of capital.
Applying the FTE method was simplified in our example because the project’s risk and 
leverage matched the firm’s, and the firm’s equity cost of capital was expected to remain 
constant. Just as with the WACC, however, this assumption is reasonable only if the firm 
maintains a constant debt-equity ratio. If the debt-equity ratio changes over time, the risk 
of equity—and, therefore, its cost of capital—will change as well.

Because these cash flows have the same risk as the debt, we discount them at the debt cost of capital of 6% 
to compute their NPV:
30.62 + -8.76
1.06 + -8.81
1.06 2 + -8.87
1.06 3 + -8.93

What Counts as “Debt”?
Firms often have many types of debt as well as other liabili-
ties, such as leases. Practitioners use different guidelines to 
determine which to include as debt when computing the 
WACC. Some use only long-term debt. Others use both 
long-term and short-term debt, plus lease obligations. Stu-
dents are often confused by these different approaches and 
are left wondering: Which liabilities should be included as 
debt?
In fact, any choice will work if done correctly. We can 
view the WACC and FTE methods as special cases of a more 
general approach in which we value the after-tax cash flows 
from a set of the firm’s assets and liabilities by discounting them 
at the after-tax weighted average cost of capital of the firm’s 
remaining assets and liabilities. In the WACC method, the 
FCF does not include the interest and principal payments on 
debt, so debt is included in the calculation of the weighted 
average cost of capital. In the FTE method, the FCFE incor-
porates the after-tax cash flows to and from debt holders, so 
debt is excluded from the weighted average cost of capital 
(which is simply the equity cost of capital).
Other combinations are also possible. For example, long-
term debt can be included in the weighted average cost of 
capital, and short-term debt can be included as part of the 
cash flows. Similarly, other assets (such as cash) or liabili-
ties (such as leases) can be included either in the weighted 
average cost of capital or as part of the cash flow. All such 
methods, if applied consistently, will lead to an equivalent 
valuation. Typically, the most convenient choice is the one 
for which the assumption of a constant debt-to-value ratio is 
a reasonable approximation.

18.5	 Project-Based Costs of Capital
Up to this point, we have assumed that both the risk and the leverage of the project under 
consideration matched those characteristics for the firm as a whole. This assumption 
allowed us, in turn, to assume that the cost of capital for a project matched the cost of 
capital of the firm.
Example 18.5
Using the FTE Method to Value an Acquisition
Problem
Consider again Avco’s acquisition from Examples 18.1, 18.2, and 18.4. The acquisition will 
contribute $3.8 million in free cash flows the first year, growing by 3% per year thereafter. The 
acquisition cost of $80 million will be financed with $50 million in new debt initially. What is 
the value of this acquisition using the FTE method?
Solution
Because the acquisition is being financed with $50 million in new debt, the remaining $30 mil-
lion of the acquisition cost must come from equity:
FCFE0 = -80 + 50 = -$30 million
In one year, the interest on the debt will be 6% * 50 = $3 million. Because Avco main-
tains a constant debt-equity ratio, the debt associated with the acquisition is also expected 
to grow at a 3% rate: 50 * 1.03 = $51.5 million. Therefore, Avco will borrow an additional 
51.5 - 50 = $1.5 million in one year.
FCFE1 = +3.8 - (1 - 0.40) * 3 + 1.5 = $3.5 million
After year 1, FCFE will also grow at a 3% rate. Using the cost of equity rE = 10%, we compute 
the NPV:
NPV (FCFE ) = -30 + 3.5/(10% - 3%) = $20 million
This NPV matches the result we obtained with the WACC and APV methods.
In this setting, the FTE approach has the same disadvantage associated with the APV 
approach: We need to compute the project’s debt capacity to determine interest and net 
borrowing before we can make the capital budgeting decision. For this reason, in most 
settings the WACC is easier to apply. The FTE method can offer an advantage when cal-
culating the value of equity for the entire firm, if the firm’s capital structure is complex and 
the market values of other securities in the firm’s capital structure are not known. In that 
case, the FTE method allows us to compute the value of equity directly. In contrast, the 
WACC and APV methods compute the firm’s enterprise value, so that a separate valuation 
of the other components of the firm’s capital structure is needed to determine the value of 
equity. Finally, by emphasizing a project’s implication for equity, the FTE method may be 
viewed as a more transparent method for discussing a project’s benefit to shareholders—a 
managerial concern.

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
In the real world, specific projects often differ from the average investment made by the 
firm. Consider General Electric Company, discussed in the introduction to this chapter. 
Projects in its health care division are likely to have different market risk than projects in 
air transportation equipment or at NBC Universal. Projects may also vary in the amount 
of leverage they will support—for example, acquisitions of real estate or capital equipment 
are often highly levered, whereas investments in intellectual property are not. In this sec-
tion, we show how to calculate the cost of capital for the project’s cash flows when a proj-
ect’s risk and leverage differ from those for the firm overall.
Estimating the Unlevered Cost of Capital
We begin by reviewing the method introduced in Chapter 12 to calculate the unlevered 
cost of capital of a project with market risk that is very different from the rest of the firm. 
Suppose Avco launches a new plastics manufacturing division that faces different market 
risks than its main packaging business. What unlevered cost of capital would be appropri-
ate for this division?
We can estimate rU for the plastics division by looking at other single-division plastics 
firms that have similar business risks. For example, suppose two firms are comparable to 
the plastics division and have the following characteristics:
Firm
Equity Cost of Capital
Debt Cost of Capital
Debt-to-Value Ratio, 
D/(E D)
Comparable #1
12.0%
6.0%
40%
Comparable #2
10.7%
5.5%
25%
Assuming that both firms maintain a target leverage ratio, we can estimate the unlevered 
cost of capital for each competitor by using the pretax WACC from Eq. 18.6:
 Competitor 1:  rU = 0.60 * 12.0% + 0.40 * 6.0% = 9.6%
 Competitor 2:  rU = 0.75 * 10.7% + 0.25 * 5.5% = 9.4%
Based on these comparable firms, we estimate an unlevered cost of capital for the plastics 
division of about 9.5%.11 With this rate in hand, we can use the APV approach to calculate 
the value of Avco’s investment in plastic manufacturing. To use either the WACC or FTE 
method, however, we need to estimate the project’s equity cost of capital, which will 
depend on the incremental debt the firm will take on as a result of the project.
Project Leverage and the Equity Cost of Capital
Suppose the firm will fund the project according to a target leverage ratio. This leverage 
ratio may differ from the firm’s overall leverage ratio, as different divisions or types of 
investments may have different optimal debt capacities. We can rearrange terms in Eq. 
18.6 to get the following expression for the equity cost of capital:12
	
rE = rU + D
E
 (rU - rD)	
(18.10)
11If we are using the CAPM to estimate expected returns, this procedure is equivalent to unlevering the 
betas of comparable firms using Eq. 12.9:
bU = [E/(E + D)] bE + [D/(D + E )] bD .
12We derived this same expression with perfect capital markets in Eq. 14.5.

	
18.5  Project-Based Costs of Capital	
689
Equation 18.10 shows that the project’s equity cost of capital depends on its unlevered 
cost of capital, rU, and the debt-equity ratio of the incremental financing that will be put 
in place to support the project. For example, suppose that Avco plans to maintain an equal 
mix of debt and equity financing as it expands into plastics manufacturing, and it expects 
its borrowing cost to remain at 6%. Given its 9.5% unlevered cost of capital, the plastics 
division’s equity cost of capital is
rE = 9.5% + 0.50
0.50
 (9.5% - 6%) = 13.0%
Once we have the equity cost of capital, we can use Eq. 18.1 to determine the division’s 
WACC:
rwacc = 0.50 * 13.0% + 0.50 * 6.0% * (1 - 0.40) = 8.3%
Based on these estimates, Avco should use a WACC of 8.3% for the plastics division, com-
pared to the WACC of 6.8% for the packaging division that we calculated in Section 18.2.
In fact, we can combine Eq. 18.1 and Eq. 18.10 to obtain a direct formula for the 
WACC when the firm maintains a target leverage ratio for the project. If d is the project’s 
debt-to-value ratio, [D/(E + D)], then13
Project-Based WACC Formula
	
rwacc = rU - dtc rD	
(18.11)
For example, in the case of Avco’s plastics division:
rwacc = 9.5% - 0.50 * 0.40 * 6% = 8.3%
13We derive Eq. 18.11 (which is equivalent to Eq. 12.13) by comparing the WACC and pretax WACC in 
Eq. 18.1 and Eq. 18.6. This formula was proposed by R. Harris and J. Pringle, “Risk Adjusted Discount 
Rates: Transition from the Average Risk Case,” Journal of Financial Research 8 (1985): 237–244.
Example 18.6
Computing Divisional Costs of Capital
Problem
Hasco Corporation is a multinational provider of lumber and milling equipment. Currently, 
Hasco’s equity cost of capital is 12.7%, and its borrowing cost is 6%. Hasco has traditionally 
maintained a 40% debt-to-value ratio. Hasco engineers have developed a GPS-based inventory 
control tracking system, which the company is considering developing commercially as a sepa-
rate division. Management views the risk of this investment as similar to that of other technology 
companies’ investments, with comparable firms typically having an unlevered cost of capital of 
15%. Suppose Hasco plans to finance the new division using 10% debt financing (a constant 
debt-to-value ratio of 10%) with a borrowing rate of 6%, and its corporate tax rate is 35%. Esti-
mate the unlevered, equity, and weighted average costs of capital for each division.
Solution
For the lumber and milling division, we can use the firm’s current equity cost of capital 
rE = 12.7% and debt-to-value ratio of 40%. Then
 rwacc = 0.60 * 12.7% + 0.40 * 6% * (1 - 0.35) = 9.2%
 rU = 0.60 * 12.7% + 0.40 * 6% = 10.0%

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
Determining the Incremental Leverage of a Project
To determine the equity or weighted average cost of capital for a project, we need to 
know the amount of debt to associate with the project. For capital budgeting purposes, the 
­project’s financing is the incremental financing that results if the firm takes on the project. 
That is, it is the change in the firm’s total debt (net of cash) with the project versus without 
the project.
The incremental financing of a project need not correspond to the financing that is 
directly tied to the project. As an example, suppose a project involves buying a new ware-
house, and the purchase of the warehouse is financed with a mortgage for 90% of its value. 
However, if the firm has an overall policy to maintain a 40% debt-to-value ratio, it will 
reduce debt elsewhere in the firm once the warehouse is purchased in an effort to maintain 
that ratio. In that case, the appropriate debt-to-value ratio to use when evaluating the ware-
house project is 40%, not 90%.
Here are some important concepts to remember when determining the project’s incre-
mental financing.
Re-Levering the WACC
When computing the WACC using its definition in Eq. 
18.1, always remember that the equity and debt costs of 
capital, rE and rD, will change for different choices of the 
firm’s leverage ratio. For example, consider a firm with a 
debt-to-value ratio of 25%, a debt cost of capital of 6.67%, 
an equity cost of capital of 12%, and a tax rate of 40%. 
From Eq. 18.1, its current WACC is
 rwacc = 0.75(12%) + 0.25(6.67%)(1 - 0.40)
 = 10%
Suppose the firm increases its debt-to-value ratio to 
50%. It is tempting to conclude that its WACC will fall to
0.50(12%) + 0.50(6.67%)(1 - 0.40) = 8%
In fact, when the firm increases leverage, the risk of its 
equity and debt will increase, causing its equity and debt 
cost of capital to rise. To compute the new WACC cor-
rectly, we must first determine the firm’s unlevered cost of 
capital from Eq. 18.6:
rU = 0.75(12%) + 0.25(6.67%) = 10.67%
If the firm’s debt cost of capital rises to 7.34% with the 
increase in leverage, then from Eq. 18.10 its equity cost of 
capital will rise as well:
rE = 10.67% + 0.50
0.50
 (10.67% - 7.34%) = 14%
Using Eq. 18.1, with the new equity and debt cost of ­capital, 
we can correctly compute the new WACC:
 rwacc = 0.50(14%) + 0.50(7.34%)(1 - 0.40)
 = 9.2%
We can also calculate the new WACC using Eq. 18.11:
rwacc = 10.67% - 0.50(0.40)(7.34%) = 9.2%
Note that if we fail to incorporate the effect of an increase 
in leverage on the firm’s equity and debt costs of capital, we 
will overestimate the reduction in its WACC.
Common Mistake
For the technology division, we estimate its unlevered cost of capital using comparable firms: 
rU = 15%. Because Hasco’s technology division will support 10% debt financing,
 rE = 15% + 0.10
0.90
 (15% - 6%) = 16%
 rwacc = 15% - 0.10 * 0.35 * 6% = 14.8%
Note that the cost of capital is quite different across the two divisions.

	
18.5  Project-Based Costs of Capital	
691
Cash Is Negative Debt.  A firm’s leverage should be evaluated based on its debt net of any 
cash. Thus, if an investment will reduce the firm’s cash holdings, it is equivalent to the 
firm adding leverage. Similarly, if the positive free cash flow from a project will increase 
the firm’s cash holdings, then this growth in cash is equivalent to a reduction in the firm’s 
leverage.
A Fixed Equity Payout Policy Implies 100% Debt Financing.  Consider a firm whose 
dividend payouts and expenditures on share repurchases are set in advance and will 
not be affected by a project’s free cash flow. In this case, the only source of financing 
is debt—any cash requirement of the project will be funded using the firm’s cash or 
­borrowing, and any cash that the project produces will be used to repay debt or increase 
the firm’s cash. As a result, the incremental effect of the project on the firm’s financing 
is to change the level of debt, so this project is 100% debt financed (that is, its debt-
to-value ratio d = 1). If the firm’s payout policy is fixed for the life of a project, the 
appropriate WACC for the project is rU - tcrD. This case can be relevant for a highly 
levered firm that devotes its free cash flow to paying down its debt or for a firm that is 
hoarding cash.
Optimal Leverage Depends on Project and Firm Characteristics.  Projects with safer 
cash flows can support more debt before they increase the risk of financial distress for the 
firm. But, as we discussed in Part 5, the likelihood of financial distress that a firm can bear 
depends on the magnitude of the distress, agency, and asymmetric information costs that it 
may face. These costs are not specific to a project, but rather depend on the characteristics 
of the entire firm. As a consequence, the optimal leverage for a project will depend on the 
characteristics of both the project and the firm.
Safe Cash Flows Can Be 100% Debt Financed.  When an investment has risk-free 
cash flows, a firm can offset these cash flows 100% with debt and leave its overall risk 
unchanged. If it does so, the appropriate discount rate for safe cash flows is rD (1 - tc).
Example 18.7
Debt Financing at Chipotle
Problem
In mid-2015, Chipotle Mexican Grill held nearly 880 million in cash and securities and no debt. 
Consider a project with an unlevered cost of capital of rU = 12%. Suppose Chipotle’s payout 
policy is completely fixed during the life of this project, so that the free cash flow from the proj-
ect will affect only Chipotle’s cash balance. If Chipotle earns 4% interest on its cash holdings and 
pays a 35% corporate tax rate, what cost of capital should Chipotle use to evaluate the project?
Solution
Because the inflows and outflows of the project change Chipotle’s cash balance, the project is 
financed by 100% debt; that is, d = 1. The appropriate cost of capital for the project is
rwacc = rU - tcrD = 12% - 0.35 * 4% = 10.6%
Note that the project is effectively 100% debt financed, because even though Chipotle itself had 
no debt, if the cash had not been used to finance the project, Chipotle would have had to pay 
taxes on the interest the cash earned.

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
	
18.6	 APV with Other Leverage Policies
To this point, we have assumed that the incremental debt of a project is set to maintain a 
constant debt-equity (or, equivalently, debt-to-value) ratio. While a constant debt-equity 
ratio is a convenient assumption that simplifies the analysis, not all firms adopt this lever-
age policy. In this section, we consider two alternative leverage policies: constant interest 
coverage and predetermined debt levels.
When we relax the assumption of a constant debt-equity ratio, the equity cost of capi-
tal and WACC for a project will change over time as the debt-equity ratio changes. As a 
result, the WACC and FTE method are difficult to implement (see Section 18.8 for further 
details). The APV method, however, is relatively straightforward to use and is therefore the 
preferred method with alternative leverage policies.
Constant Interest Coverage Ratio
As discussed in Chapter 15, if a firm is using leverage to shield income from corporate 
taxes, then it will adjust its debt level so that its interest expenses grow with its earnings. 
In this case, it is natural to specify the firm’s incremental interest payments as a target frac-
tion, k, of the project’s free cash flow:14
	
Interest Paid in Year t = k * FCFt	
(18.12)
When the firm keeps its interest payments to a target fraction of its FCF, we say it has a 
constant interest coverage ratio.
To implement the APV approach, we must compute the present value of the tax shield 
under this policy. Because the tax shield is proportional to the project’s free cash flow, it 
has the same risk as the project’s cash flow and so should be discounted at the same rate—
that is, the unlevered cost of capital, rU. But the present value of the project’s free cash flow 
at rate rU is the unlevered value of the project. Thus,
 PV(Interest Tax Shield) = PV(tck * FCF ) = tck * PV(FCF )
	
 = tck * V U	
(18.13)
That is, with a constant interest coverage policy, the value of the interest tax shield is pro-
portional to the project’s unlevered value. Using the APV method, the value of the project 
with leverage is given by the following formula:
Levered Value with a Constant Interest Coverage Ratio
 V L = V U + PV(Interest Tax Shield) = V U + tc k * V U
	
 = (1 + tck)V U	
(18.14)
For example, we calculated the unlevered value of Avco’s RFX project as V U = $59.62 
million in Section 18.3. If Avco targets interest to be 20% of its free cash flow, the value 
with leverage is V L = [1 + 0.4 (20%)] 59.62 = $64.39 million. (This result differs from 
the value of $61.25 million for the project that we calculated in Section 18.3, where we 
assumed a different leverage policy of a 50% debt-to-value ratio.)
14It might be even better to specify interest as a fraction of taxable earnings. Typically, however, taxable 
earnings and free cash flows are roughly proportional, so the two specifications are very similar. Also, for 
Eq. 18.12 to hold exactly, the firm must adjust debt continuously throughout the year. We will relax this 
assumption in Section 18.8 to a setting in which the firm adjusts debt periodically based on its expected 
level of future free cash flow (see Example 18.11).

	
18.6  APV with Other Leverage Policies	
693
Predetermined Debt Levels
Rather than set debt according to a target debt-equity ratio or interest coverage level, a 
firm may adjust its debt according to a fixed schedule that is known in advance. Suppose, 
for example, that Avco plans to borrow $30.62 million and then will reduce the debt on 
a fixed schedule to $20 million after one year, to $10 million after two years, and to zero 
after three years. The RFX project will have no other consequences for Avco’s leverage, 
regardless of its success. How can we value an investment like this one when its future debt 
levels, rather than the debt-equity ratio, are known in advance?
When the debt levels are known in advance, it is straightforward to compute the interest 
payments and the corresponding tax shield the firm will obtain. The question is, at what 
rate should we discount this tax shield to determine the present value? In Section 18.3, we 
used the project’s unlevered cost of capital because the amount of debt—and, therefore, the 
tax shield—fluctuated with the value of the project itself and so had similar risk. However, 
with a fixed debt schedule, the amount of the debt will not fluctuate. In this case, the tax 
shield is less risky than the project, so it should be discounted at a lower rate. 
Example 18.8
Valuing an Acquisition with Target Interest Coverage
Problem
Consider again Avco’s acquisition from Examples 18.1 and 18.2. The acquisition will contribute 
$3.8 million in free cash flows the first year, growing by 3% per year thereafter. The acquisition 
cost of $80 million will be financed with $50 million in new debt initially. Compute the value of 
the acquisition using the APV method assuming Avco will maintain a constant interest coverage 
ratio for the acquisition.
Solution
Given Avco’s unlevered cost of capital of rU = 8%, the acquisition has an unlevered value of
V U = 3.8/(8% - 3%) = $76 million
With $50 million in new debt and a 6% interest rate, the interest expense the first year is 
6% * 50 = $3 million, or k = Interest/FCF = 3/3.8 = 78.95%. Because Avco will maintain 
this interest coverage, we can use Eq. 18.14 to compute the levered value:
V L = (1 + tc k)V U = [1 + 0.4 (78.95%)] 76 = $100 million
This value is identical to the value computed using the WACC method in Example 18.1, where 
we assumed a constant debt-equity ratio.
Equation 18.14 provides a simple rule to determine an investment’s levered value based 
on a leverage policy that may be appropriate for many firms.15 Note also that if the invest-
ment’s free cash flows are expected to grow at a constant rate, then the assumption of con-
stant interest coverage and a constant debt-equity ratio are equivalent, as in the following 
example.
15J. Graham and C. Harvey report that a majority of firms target a credit rating when issuing debt [“The 
Theory and Practice of Corporate Finance: Evidence from the Field,” Journal of Financial Economics 60 
(2001)]. The interest coverage ratios are important determinants of credit ratings. Firms and rating agen-
cies also consider the book debt-equity ratio, which often fluctuates more closely with a firm’s cash flows, 
rather than with its market value. (For example, book equity increases when the firm invests in physical 
capital to expand, which generally results in higher cash flows.)

694	
Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
Indeed, the risk of the tax shield is similar to the risk of the debt payments. Therefore, we 
advise the following general rule:16
When debt levels are set according to a fixed schedule, we can discount the predetermined 
interest tax shields using the debt cost of capital, rD.
Let’s apply this to our Avco example, given the debt schedule and interest tax shield 
shown in Table 18.8. Using the debt cost of capital, rD = 6%:
PV (Interest Tax Shield) = 0.73
1.06 + 0.48
1.062 + 0.24
1.063 = $1.32 million
We then combine the value of the tax shield with the unlevered value of the project (which 
we already computed in Section 18.3) to determine the APV:
V L = V U + PV (Interest Tax Shield) = 59.62 + 1.32 = $60.94 million
The value of the interest tax shield computed here, $1.32 million, differs from the value 
of $1.63 million we computed in Section 18.3 based on constant debt-equity ratio. Com-
paring the firm’s debt in the two cases, we see that it is paid off more rapidly in Table 18.8 
than in Table 18.4. Also, because the debt-equity ratio for the project changes over time 
in this example, the project’s WACC also changes, making it difficult to apply the WACC 
method to this case. We show how to do so, and verify that we get the same result, as part 
of the advanced topics in Section 18.8.
A particularly simple example of a predetermined debt level occurs when the firm has 
permanent fixed debt, maintaining the same level of debt forever. We discussed this debt 
policy in Section 15.2 and showed that if the firm maintains a fixed level of debt, D, the 
value of the tax shield is tc * D.17 Hence, the value of the levered project in this case is
Levered Value with Permanent Debt
	
V L = V U + tc * D 	
(18.15)
A Cautionary Note: When debt levels are predetermined, the firm will not adjust its debt 
based on fluctuations to its cash flows or value according to a target leverage ratio, and the 
risk of the interest tax shield differs from the risk of the cash flows. As a result, the firm’s 
pretax WACC no longer coincides with its unlevered cost of capital, so Eq. 18.6, Eq. 18.10, 
and Eq. 18.11 do not apply. (For example, if we compute the WACC using Eq. 18.11 and 
16The risk of the tax shield is not literally equivalent to that of the debt payments, because it is based on 
only the interest portion of the payments and is subject to the risk of fluctuations in the firm’s marginal tax 
rate. Nevertheless, this assumption is a reasonable approximation absent much more detailed information.
17Because the interest tax shield is tcrD D in perpetuity, using the discount rate rD we get 
PV(Interest Tax Shield) = tc rD D/rD = tc D.

apply it in the case of permanent debt, the value we estimate will not be consistent with 
Eq. 18.15.) For the correct relationship between the firm’s WACC, unlevered, and equity 
cost of capital, we need to use more general versions of these equations, which we provide 
in Eq. 18.20 and Eq. 18.21 in Section 18.8.
A Comparison of Methods
We have introduced three methods for valuing levered investments: WACC, APV, and 
FTE. How do we decide which method to use in which circumstances?
When used consistently, each method produces the same valuation for the invest-
ment. Thus, the choice of method is largely a matter of convenience. As a general rule, the 
WACC method is the easiest to use when the firm will maintain a fixed debt-to-value ratio 
over the life of the investment. For alternative leverage policies, the APV method is usually 
the most straightforward approach. The FTE method is typically used only in complicated 
settings for which the values of other securities in the firm’s capital structure or the interest 
tax shield are themselves difficult to determine.

18.7	 Other Effects of Financing
The WACC, APV, and FTE methods determine the value of an investment incorporat-
ing the tax shields associated with leverage. However, as we discussed in Chapter 16, some 
other potential imperfections are associated with leverage. In this section, we investigate 
ways to adjust our valuation to account for imperfections such as issuance costs, security 
mispricing, and financial distress and agency costs.
Issuance and Other Financing Costs
When a firm takes out a loan or raises capital by issuing securities, the banks that provide 
the loan or underwrite the sale of the securities charge fees. Table 18.9 lists the typical fees 
for common transactions. The fees associated with the financing of the project are a cost 
18Fees vary by transaction size; estimates here are based on typical legal, underwriting, and accounting fees 
for a $50 million transaction. For example, see I. Lee, S. Lochhead, J. Ritter, and Q. Zhao, “The Cost of 
Raising Capital,” Journal of Financial Research 19 (1996): 59–74.

that should be included as part of the project’s required investment, reducing the NPV of 
the project.
For example, suppose a project has a levered value of $20 million and requires an ini-
tial investment of $15 million. To finance the project, the firm will borrow $10 million 
and fund the remaining $5 million by reducing dividends. If the bank providing the loan 
charges fees (after any tax deductions) totaling $200,000, the project NPV is
NPV = V L - (Investment) - (After Tax Issuance Costs) = 20 - 15 - 0.2 = $4.8 million
This calculation presumes the cash flows generated by the project will be paid out. If 
instead they will be reinvested in a new project, and thereby save future issuance costs, the 
present value of these savings should also be incorporated and will offset the current issu-
ance costs.
Security Mispricing
With perfect capital markets, all securities are fairly priced and issuing securities is a zero-
NPV transaction. However, as discussed in Chapter  16, sometimes management may 
believe that the securities they are issuing are priced at less than (or more than) their true 
value. If so, the NPV of the transaction, which is the difference between the actual money 
raised and the true value of the securities sold, should be included when evaluating the 
decision. For example, if the financing of the project involves an equity issue, and if man-
agement believes that the equity will sell at a price that is less than its true value, this mis-
pricing is a cost of the project for the existing shareholders.19 It can be deducted from the 
project NPV in addition to other issuance costs.
When a firm borrows funds, a mispricing scenario arises if the interest rate charged dif-
fers from the rate that is appropriate given the actual risk of the loan. For example, a firm 
may pay an interest rate that is too high if news that would improve its credit rating has not 
yet become public. With the WACC method, the cost of the higher interest rate will result 
in a higher weighted average cost of capital and a lower value for the investment. With the 
APV method, we must add to the value of the project the NPV of the loan cash flows when 
evaluated at the “correct” rate that corresponds to their actual risk.20
19New shareholders, of course, benefit from receiving the shares at a low price.
20We must also use the correct rate for rD when levering or unlevering the cost of capital.
Example 18.9
Valuing a Loan
Problem
Gap, Inc., is considering borrowing $100 million to fund an expansion of its stores. Given 
investors’ uncertainty regarding its prospects, Gap will pay a 6% interest rate on this loan. The 
firm’s management knows, however, that the actual risk of the loan is extremely low and that the 
appropriate rate on the loan is 5%. Suppose the loan is for five years, with all principal being 
repaid in the fifth year. If Gap’s marginal corporate tax rate is 40%, what is the net effect of the 
loan on the value of the expansion?
Solution
The following table shows the cash flows (in $ million) and interest tax shields of a fair loan, 
which has a 5% interest rate, and of the above-market rate loan Gap will receive, which has a 6%

697
Financial Distress and Agency Costs
As discussed in Chapter 16, one consequence of debt financing is the possibility of finan-
cial distress and agency costs. Because these costs affect the future free cash flows that will 
be generated by the project, they can be incorporated directly into the estimates of the 
project’s expected free cash flows. When the debt level—and, therefore, the probability 
of financial distress—is high, the expected free cash flow will be reduced by the expected 
costs associated with financial distress and agency problems. (Conversely, as we also noted 
in Chapter 16, in some situations the threat of default can also prompt management to 
improve efficiency and thereby increase the firm’s free cash flow.)
Financial distress and agency costs also have consequences for the cost of capital. For 
example, financial distress is more likely to occur when economic times are bad. As a result, 
the costs of distress cause the value of the firm to fall further in a market downturn. Finan-
cial distress costs therefore tend to increase the sensitivity of the firm’s value to market risk, 
further raising the cost of capital for highly levered firms.21
How do we incorporate financial distress costs into the valuation methods described 
in this chapter? One approach is to adjust our free cash flow estimates to account for the 
costs, and increased risk, resulting from financial distress. An alternative method is to first 
value the project ignoring these costs, and then add the present value of the incremental 
cash flows associated with financial distress and agency problems separately. Because these 
costs tend to occur only when a firm is in (or near) default, valuing them is complicated 
and best done using the option valuation techniques introduced in Part 7. In some special 
21In other words, distress costs tend to have a negative beta (they are higher in bad times). Because they are 
a cost, including them in the firm’s free cash flows will raise the beta of the firm.
interest rate. For each loan, we compute both the NPV of the loan cash flows and the present 
value of the interest tax shields, using the correct rate rD = 5%.
For the fair loan, note that the NPV of the loan cash flows is zero. Thus, the benefit of the 
loan on the project’s value is the present value of the interest tax shield of $8.66 million. For the 
actual loan, the higher interest rate increases the value of the interest tax shield but implies a 
negative NPV for the loan cash flows. The combined effect of the loan on the project’s value is
NPV (Loan Cash Flows) + PV (Interest Tax Shield) = -4.33 + 10.39 = $6.06 million
While leverage is still valuable due to the tax shields, paying the higher interest rate reduces its 
benefit to the firm by 8.66 - 6.06 = $2.60 million.

cases, however, we can use the values of the firm’s existing securities to estimate the value of 
distress costs, as in the following example.
Example 18.10
Valuing Distress Costs
Problem
Your firm has zero coupon debt with a face value of $100 million due in 5 years time, and 
no other debt outstanding. The current risk-free rate is 5%, but due to default risk the yield 
to maturity of the debt is 12%. You believe that in the event of default, 10% of the losses are 
attributable to bankruptcy and distress costs. (For example, if the debt holders lose $60 million 
and recover $40 million, $6 million of the loss in value would not have occurred if the firm had 
been unlevered and thus avoided bankruptcy.) Estimate the present value of the distress costs.
Solution
With a 12% yield, the current market value of the firm’s debt is $100/1.125 = $56.74 million. 
If the firm’s debt were risk-free, its market value would be $100/1.055 = $78.35 million. The 
difference in these values, $78.35 - $56.74 = $21.61 million, is the present value of the debt 
holders’ expected losses in default. If 10% of these losses is due to bankruptcy and distress costs, 
then the present value of these costs is $21.61 * 0.10 = $2.16 million.
Government Loan Guarantees
distressed firms. Moreover, firms and banks viewed as “too 
big to fail” were thought to have implicit guarantees even if 
they did not have explicit ones.
These guarantees enabled firms to obtain loans at a lower 
interest rate than they otherwise would have received with-
out government assistance. If these loans were fairly priced 
at market rates, then the loans obtained with the help of 
the federal guarantee had a positive NPV for the borrowers, 
and were equivalent to a direct cash subsidy. If, on the other 
hand, market rates for these loans were too high—due per-
haps to asymmetric information or a lack of available lend-
ers—then these loans and guarantees may have improved 
terms for borrowers at a lower cost to taxpayers than a direct 
cash bailout.
In times of crisis, firms may appeal to the federal govern-
ment for financial assistance. Often, such aid comes in the 
form of subsidized loans or loan guarantees. For example, 
in the wake of the September 11, 2001 tragedy, the U.S. 
government made available $10 billion in loan guarantees to 
enable air carriers to obtain credit. U.S. Airways received the 
largest loan guarantee of $900 million, and America West 
Airlines received the second largest, for $429 million. Ulti-
mately, these loans were repaid without taxpayer expense.
Loan guarantees were also an important part of the gov-
ernment’s response to the 2008 financial crisis. The U.S. 
government has insured over $1 trillion in debt issued by 
financial institutions or assets held by the banks. The gov-
ernment also made over $500 billion in direct loans to

18.8	 Advanced Topics in Capital Budgeting
In the previous sections, we have highlighted the most important methods for capital bud-
geting with leverage and demonstrated their application in common settings. In this section, 
we consider several more complicated scenarios and show how our tools can be extended to 
these cases. First, we consider leverage policies in which firms keep debt fixed in the short 
run, but adjust to a target leverage ratio in the long run. Second, we look at the relationship 

	
18.8  Advanced Topics in Capital Budgeting	
699
between a firm’s equity and unlevered cost of capital for alternative leverage policies. Third, 
we implement the WACC and FTE methods when the firm’s debt-equity ratio changes 
over time. We then conclude the section by incorporating the effects of personal taxes.
Periodically Adjusted Debt
To this point, we have considered leverage policies in which debt is either adjusted con-
tinuously to a target leverage ratio22 or set according to a fixed plan that will never 
change. More realistically, most firms allow the debt-equity ratio of the firm to stray 
from the target and periodically adjust leverage to bring it back into line with the target. 
Suppose the firm adjusts its leverage every s periods, as shown in Figure 18.1. Then the 
firm’s interest tax shields up to date s are predetermined, so they should be discounted at 
rate rD. In contrast, interest tax shields that occur after date s depend on future adjustments 
the firm will make to its debt, so they are risky. If the firm will adjust the debt according 
to a target debt-equity ratio or interest coverage level, then the future interest tax shields 
should be discounted at rate rD for the periods that they are known, but at rate rU for all 
earlier periods when they are still risky.
An important special case is when the debt is adjusted annually. In that case, the 
expected interest expense on date t, Intt, is known as of date t - 1. Therefore, we discount 
the interest tax shield at rate rD for one period, from date t to t - 1 (because it will be 
known at that time), and then discount it from date t - 1 to 0 at rate rU:
	
PV (tc * Intt ) =
tc * Intt
(1 + rU)t -1(1 + rD) =
tc * Intt
(1 + rU)t * ¢
1 + rU
1 + rD
≤	
(18.16)
22While we have simplified our exposition earlier in the chapter by calculating debt and interest payments on 
an annual basis, the formulas we have used in the case of a target leverage ratio or interest coverage ratio are 
based on the assumption that the firm maintains the target leverage ratio or interest coverage during the year.
Figure 18.1 
Discounting the Tax Shield with Periodic Adjustments
If the debt is reset to a target leverage ratio every s periods, then interest tax shields within 
the first s periods are known and should be discounted at rate rD Interest tax shields that 
occur after date s are not yet known, so they should be ­discounted at rate rD for the periods 
when they will be known and at rate rU for earlier periods.

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
Equation 18.16 implies that we can value the tax shield by discounting it at rate rU as 
before, and then multiply the result by the factor (1 + rU)/(1 + rD) to account for the fact 
that the tax shield is known one year in advance.
This same adjustment can be applied to other valuation methods as well. For example, 
when the debt is adjusted annually rather than continuously to a target debt-to-value ratio 
d, the project-based WACC formula of Eq. 18.11 becomes23
	
rwacc = rU - d tc rD 
1 + rU
1 + rD
	
(18.17)
Similarly, when the firm sets debt annually based on its expected future free cash flow, 
the constant interest coverage model in Eq. 18.14 becomes

(18.18)
How do firm’s actually adjust their leverage? As Figure 18.2 shows, approximately 50% 
of surveyed firms attempt to keep their leverage ratio in tight range. When firm’s adjust 
their debt levels only periodically, the risk of the tax shield declines and its value increases 
as shown in Eqs. 18.17 and 18.18. Example 18.11 illustrates these methods in a ­constant 
growth setting.
23An equivalent WACC formula was proposed by J. Miles and J. Ezzell, “The Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital, Perfect Capital Markets and Project Life: A Clarification,” Journal of Financial and Quantitative 
Analysis 15 (1980): 719–730.
Of 392 CFOs surveyed by Professors J. Graham and C. Harvey, 81% reported having a tar-
get debt-equity ratio. However, only 10% of respondents viewed the target as set in stone. 
Most were willing to let the debt-equity ratio of the firm stray from the target and periodi-
cally adjust leverage to bring it back into line.

Leverage and the Cost of Capital
The relationship between leverage and the project’s costs of capital in Eq. 18.6, Eq. 18.10, 
and Eq.18.11 relies on the assumption that the firm maintains a target leverage ratio. That 
relationship holds because in that case the interest tax shields have the same risk as the 
firm’s cash flows. But when debt is set according to a fixed schedule for some period of 
time, the interest tax shields for the scheduled debt are known, relatively safe cash flows. 
These safe cash flows will reduce the effect of leverage on the risk of the firm’s equity. To 
account for this effect, we should deduct the value of these “safe” tax shields from the 
debt—in the same way that we deduct cash—when evaluating a firm’s leverage. That is, 
if T s is the present value of the interest tax shields from predetermined debt, the risk of a 
firm’s equity will depend on its debt net of the predetermined tax shields:
	
Ds = D - T s	
(18.19)
Example 18.11
Annual Debt Ratio Targeting
Problem
Celmax Corporation expects free cash flows this year of $7.36 million and a future growth 
rate of 4% per year. The firm currently has $30 million in debt outstanding. This leverage will 
remain fixed during the year, but at the end of each year Celmax will increase or decrease its debt 
to maintain a constant debt-equity ratio. Celmax pays 5% interest on its debt, pays a corporate 
tax rate of 40%, and has an unlevered cost of capital of 12%. Estimate Celmax’s value with this 
leverage policy.
Solution
Using the APV approach, the unlevered value is V U = 7.36/(12% - 4%) = $92.0 million. In the 
first year, Celmax will have an interest tax shield of tc rD D = 0.40 * 5% * $30 million = $0.6 
million. Because Celmax will adjust its debt after one year, the tax shields are expected to grow 
by 4% per year with the firm. The present value of the interest tax shield is therefore
PV (Interest Tax Shield) =
0.6
(12% - 4%)
*
¢ 1.12
1.05≤= $8.0 million
Therefore, V L = V U + PV (Interest Tax Shield) = 92.0 + 8.0 = $100.0 million.
We can also apply the WACC method. From Eq. 18.17, Celmax’s WACC is
 rwacc = rU - d tc rD 
1 + rU
1 + rD
= 12% - 30
100
 (0.40)(5%) 1.12
1.05
 = 11.36%
Therefore, V L = 7.36/(11.36% - 4%) = $100 million.
Finally, the constant interest coverage model can be applied (in this setting with constant 
growth, a constant debt-equity ratio implies a constant interest coverage ratio). Given interest of 
5% * $30 million = $1.50 million this year, from Eq. 18.18,
 V L = ¢1 + tc k

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
We show in this chapter’s appendix that Eq. 18.6 and Eq. 18.10 continue to apply with 
D replaced by Ds, so that the more general relationship between the unlevered and equity 
costs of capital are related as follows:
Leverage and the Cost of Capital with a Fixed Debt Schedule
	
rU =
E
E + Ds rE +
Ds
E + Ds rD or, equivalently, rE = rU + Ds
E
 (rU - rD)	
(18.20)
We can also combine Eq. 18.20 with the definition of the WACC in Eq. 18.1 and gen-
eralize the project-based WACC formula in Eq. 18.11:
Project WACC with a Fixed Debt Schedule
	
rwacc = rU - d tc [rD + f(rU - rD)]	
(18.21)
where d = D/(D + E ) is the debt-to-value ratio, and f = T s/(tc D) is a measure of the 
permanence of the debt level, D. Here are three cases commonly used in practice, which 
differ according to the frequency with which the debt is assumed to adjust to the growth of 
the investment:24
	
1.	 Continuously adjusted debt: T s = 0, D s = D, and f = 0
	
2.	 Annually adjusted debt: T s =
tc rDD
1 + rD
, D s = D ¢1 - tc 
rD

≤, and f =
rD
1 + rD
	
3.	 Permanent debt: T s = tcD, D s = D (1 - tc), and f = 1
Finally, note that unless d and f remain constant over time, the WACC and equity cost 
of capital must be computed period by period.
24Case 1 reduces to the Harris-Pringle formula (see footnote 14), case 2 is the Miles-Ezzell formula (see 
footnote 23), and case 3 is equivalent to the Modigliani-Miller-Hamada formula with permanent debt. 
See F. Modigliani and M. Miller, “Corporate Income Taxes and the Cost of Capital: A Correction,” Ameri-
can Economic Review 53 (1963): 433–443; and R. Hamada, “The Effect of a Firm’s Capital Structure on 
the Systematic Risks of Common Stocks,” Journal of Finance 27 (1972): 435–452.
Example 18.12
APV and WACC with Permanent Debt
Problem
International Paper Company is considering the acquisition of additional forestland in the 
southeastern United States. The wood harvested from the land will generate free cash flows of 
$4.5 million per year, with an unlevered cost of capital of 7%. As a result of this acquisition, 
International Paper will permanently increase its debt by $30 million. If International Paper’s tax 
rate is 35%, what is the value of this acquisition using the APV method? Verify this result using 
the WACC method.
Solution
Using the APV method, the unlevered value of the land is V U = FCF/rU = 4.5/0.07 = $64.29 
million. Because the debt is permanent, the value of the tax shield is tc D = 0.35(30) = 10.50. 
Therefore, V L = 64.29 + 10.50 = $74.79 million.
To use the WACC method, we apply Eq. 18.21 with f = T s/(tcD) = 1 and 
d = 30/74.79 = 40.1%. Therefore, the WACC for the investment is
rwacc = rU - d tcrU = 7% - 0.401 * 0.35 * 7% = 6.017%
and V L = 4.5/0.06017 = $74.79 million.

The WACC or FTE Method with Changing Leverage
When a firm does not maintain a constant debt-equity ratio for a project, the APV method 
is generally the most straightforward method to apply. The WACC and FTE methods 
become more difficult to use because when the proportion of debt financing changes, the 
project’s equity cost of capital and WACC will not remain constant over time. With a 
bit of care, however, these methods can still be used (and, of course, will lead to the same 
result as the APV method).
As an example, let’s see how we would apply the WACC or FTE methods to the RFX 
project when Avco has the fixed debt schedule we analyzed earlier using the APV method. 
The spreadsheet in Table 18.10 computes the equity cost of capital and WACC for the 
RFX project each year given the fixed debt schedule shown in line 3. The project’s value 
is computed using the APV method in line 7 as the total of the unlevered and tax shield 
values. With the project’s equity value and net debt Ds in hand, we can use Eq. 18.20 to 
calculate the project’s equity cost of capital each year (line 11). Note that the equity cost of 
capital declines over time as the project’s leverage ratio Ds/E declines. By year 3, the debt is 
fully repaid and the equity cost of capital equals the unlevered cost of capital of 8%.
Given the project’s equity cost of capital, we compute its WACC using Eq. 18.1 in line 
12. For example, at the beginning of the project,
 rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD(1 - tc)
 = 30.32
60.94
 9.93% + 30.62
60.94
 6%(1 - 0.40) = 6.75%
Note that as the leverage of the project falls, its WACC rises, until it eventually equals the 
unlevered cost of capital of 8% when the project debt is fully repaid at year 3.
Once we have computed the WACC or the equity cost of capital, we can value the 
project using the WACC or FTE method. Because the cost of capital changes over time,

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
we must use a different discount rate each year when applying these methods. For example, 
using the WACC method, the levered value each year is computed as
	
V L
t =
FCFt +1 + V L
t +1
1 + rwacc(t)
	
(18.22)
where rwacc(t) is the project’s WACC in year t. This calculation is shown in Table 18.11. 
Note that the levered value matches the result from the APV method (line 7 in Table 18.10). 
The same approach can be used when applying the FTE method.25
Personal Taxes
As we discussed in Chapter 15, leverage has tax consequences for both investors and cor-
porations. For individuals, interest income from debt is generally taxed more heavily than 
income from equity (capital gains and dividends). So how do personal taxes affect our 
valuation methods?
If investors are taxed on the income they receive from holding equity or debt, it will 
raise the return they require to hold those securities. That is, the equity and debt cost of 
capital in the market already reflects the effects of investor taxes. As a result, the WACC 
method does not change in the presence of investor taxes; we can continue to compute the 
WACC according to Eq. 18.1 and compute the levered value as in Section 18.2.
The APV approach, however, requires modification in the presence of investor taxes 
because it requires that we compute the unlevered cost of capital. This computation is 
affected by the presence of investor taxes. Let te be the tax rate investors pay on equity 
income (dividends) and ti be the tax rate investors pay on interest income. Then, given an 
expected return on debt rD, define r*D as the expected return on equity income that would 
give investors the same after-tax return: r*D(1 - te) = rD(1 - ti). So
	
r*D K rD 
(1 - ti)
(1 - te)	
(18.23)
Because the unlevered cost of capital is for a hypothetical firm that is all equity, inves-
tors’ tax rates on income for such a firm are the equity rates, so we must use the rate r*D 
when computing the unlevered cost of capital. Therefore, Eq. 18.20 becomes
Unlevered Cost of Capital with Personal Taxes
	
rU =
E
E + D s rE +
D s
E + D s r*D	
(18.24)
25You will notice, however, that we used the APV to compute the debt-equity ratio each period, which we 
needed to calculate rE and rwacc . If we had not already solved for the APV, we would need to determine 
the project’s value and WACC simultaneously, using the approach described in this chapter’s appendix.

Next, we must compute the interest tax shield using the effective tax advantage of 
debt, t*, in place of tc. The effective tax rate t* incorporates the investors’ tax rate 
on equity income, te, and on interest income, ti, and was defined in Chapter 15 as 
follows:
	
t* = 1 -
(1 - tc)(1 - te)
(1 - ti)
	
(18.25)
Then, we calculate the interest tax shield using tax rate t* and interest rate r*D:
	
Interest Tax Shield in Year t = t* * rD* * Dt -1	
(18.26)
Finally we discount the interest tax shields at rate rU if the firm maintains a target lever-
age ratio or at rate r*D if the debt is set according to a predetermined schedule.26
26If the debt is permanent, for example, the value of the tax shield is t* rD* D/rD* = t*D. as shown in 
Chapter 15.
Example 18.13
Using the APV Method with Personal Taxes
Problem
Apex Corporation has an equity cost of capital of 14.4% and a debt cost of capital of 6%, and the 
firm maintains a debt-equity ratio of 1. Apex is considering an expansion that will contribute $4 mil-
lion in free cash flows the first year, growing by 4% per year thereafter. The expansion will cost $60 
million and will be financed with $40 million in new debt initially with a constant debt-equity ratio 
maintained thereafter. Apex’s corporate tax rate is 40%; the tax rate on interest income is 40%; and 
the tax rate on equity income is 20%. Compute the value of the expansion using the APV method.
Solution
First, we compute the value without leverage. From Eq. 18.23, the debt cost of capital of 6% is 
equivalent to an equity rate of
r*D = rD 
1 - ti
1 - te
= 6% * 1 - 0.40
1 - 0.20 = 4.5%
Because Apex maintains a constant debt-equity ratio, D s = D and Apex’s unlevered cost of capi-
tal is, using Eq. 18.24,
rU =
E
E + D s rE +
D s
E + D s r*D = 0.50 * 14.4% + 0.50 * 4.5% = 9.45%
Therefore, V U = 4/(9.45% - 4%) = $73.39 million.
From Eq. 18.25, the effective tax advantage of debt is
t* = 1 -
(1 - tc )(1 - te )
(1 - ti )
= 1 - (1 - 0.40)(1 - 0.20)
(1 - 0.40)
= 20%
Apex will add new debt of $40 million initially, so from Eq. 18.26 the interest tax shield is 
20% * 4.5% * 40 = $0.36 million the first year (note that we use r*D here). With a growth rate 
of 4%, the present value of the interest tax shield is
PV (Interest Tax Shield) = 0.36/(9.45% - 4%) = $6.61 million

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
As Example 18.13 illustrates, the WACC method is much simpler to apply than the 
APV method in the case with investor taxes. More significantly, the WACC approach does 
not require knowledge of investors’ tax rates. This fact is important because in practice, 
estimating the marginal tax rate of the investor can be very difficult.
However, if the investment’s leverage or risk does not match the firm’s, then investor tax  
rates are required even with the WACC method, as we must unlever and/or re-lever the firm’s 
cost of capital using Eq. 18.24. When the investor’s tax rate on interest income exceeds that 
on equity income, an increase in leverage will lead to a smaller reduction in the WACC (see  
Problem 28).
Concept Check	
1.	 When a firm has pre-determined tax shields, how do we measure its net debt when calculating its 
unlevered cost of capital?
	
2.	 If the firm’s debt-equity ratio changes over time, can the WACC method still be applied?
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
18.1  Overview of Key Concepts
	
n	 The three main methods of capital budgeting are weighted average cost of capital (WACC), 
adjusted present value (APV), and flow-to-equity (FTE).
18.2  The Weighted Average Cost of Capital
	
n	 The key steps in the WACC valuation method are as follows:
n	 Determine the unlevered free cash flows of the investment.
n	 Compute the weighted average cost of capital:
	
rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD(1 - tc )	
(18.1)
n	 Compute the value with leverage, V L, by discounting the free cash flows of the investment 
using the WACC.
18.3  The Adjusted Present Value Method
	
n	 To determine the value of a levered investment using the APV method, proceed as follows:
n	 Determine the investment’s value without leverage, V U, by discounting its free cash flows at 
the unlevered cost of capital, rU .
Therefore, the value of the expansion with leverage is given by the APV:
V L = V U + PV (Interest Tax Shield) = 73.39 + 6.61 = $80 million
Given the cost of $60 million, the expansion has an NPV of $20 million.
Let’s check this result using the WACC method. Note that the expansion has the same debt-
to-value ratio of 40/80 = 50% as the firm overall. Thus, its WACC is equal to the firm’s WACC:
 rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD(1 - tc )
 = 0.50 * 14.4% + 0.50 * 6% * (1 - 0.40) = 9%
Therefore, V L = 4/(9% - 4%) = $80 million, as before.

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 

	
18.7  Other Effects of Financing	
707
n	 Determine the present value of the interest tax shield.
a.	 Given debt Dt on date t, the tax shield on date t + 1 is tc rD Dt .
b.	 If the debt level varies with the investment’s value or free cash flow, use discount rate 
rU . (If the debt is predetermined, discount the tax shield at rate rD . See Section 18.6.)
n	 Add the unlevered value V U to the present value of the interest tax shield to determine the 
value of the investment with leverage, V L.
18.4  The Flow-to-Equity Method
	
n	 The key steps in the flow-to-equity method for valuing a levered investment are as follows:
n	 Determine the free cash flow to equity of the investment:
	
FCFE = FCF - (1 - tc ) * (Interest Payments) + (Net Borrowing)
(18.9)
n	 Compute the contribution to equity value, E, by discounting the free cash flow to equity 
using the equity cost of capital.
18.5  Project-Based Costs of Capital
	
n	 If a project’s risk is different from that of the firm as a whole, we must estimate its cost of capital 
separately from the firm’s cost of capital. We estimate the project’s unlevered cost of capital by 
looking at the unlevered cost of capital for other firms with similar market risk as the project.
	
n	 With a target leverage ratio, the unlevered, equity, and weighted average costs of capital are 
related as follows:
	
rU =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD = Pretax WACC
(18.6)
	
rE = rU + D
E
 (rU - rD)
(18.10)
	
rwacc = rU - d tc rD ,
(18.11)
	
where d = D/(D + E) is the project’s debt-to-value ratio.
	
n	 When assessing the leverage associated with a project, we must consider its incremental impact 
on the debt, net of cash balances, of the firm overall and not just the specific financing used for 
that investment.
18.6  APV with Other Leverage Policies
	
n	 A firm has a constant interest coverage policy if it sets debt to maintain its interest expenses 
as a fraction, k, of free cash flow. The levered value of a project with such a leverage policy is 
V L = (1 + tc k)V U.
	
n	 When debt levels are set according to a fixed schedule:
n	 We can discount the predetermined interest tax shields using the debt cost of capital, rD.
n	 The unlevered cost of capital can no longer be computed as the pretax WACC (see Section 18.8).
	
n	 If a firm chooses to keep the level of debt at a constant level, D, permanently, then the levered 
value of a project with such a leverage policy is V L = V U + tc * D.
	
n	 In general, the WACC method is the easiest to use when a firm has a target debt-equity ratio 
that it plans to maintain over the life of the investment. For other leverage policies, the APV 
method is usually the most straightforward method.
18.7  Other Effects of Financing
	
n	 Issuance costs and any costs or gains from mispricing of issued securities should be included in 
the assessment of a project’s value.
	
n	 Financial distress costs are likely to (1) lower the expected free cash flow of a project and (2) 
raise the firm’s cost of capital. Taking these effects into account, together with other agency and 
asymmetric information costs, may limit a firm’s use of leverage.

708	
Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
18.8  Advanced Topics in Capital Budgeting
	
n	 If a firm adjusts its debt annually to a target leverage ratio, the value of the interest tax shield is 
enhanced by the factor (1 + rU)/(1 + rD).
	
n	 If the firm does not adjust leverage continuously, so that some of the tax shields are predeter-
mined, the unlevered, equity, and weighted average costs of capital are related as follows:
	
rU =
E
E + D s rE +
D s
E + D s rD or, equivalently, rE = rU + D s
E
 (rU - rD) (18.20)
	
rwacc = rU - d tc [rD + f(rU - rD)]
(18.21)
	
	 where d = D/(D + E ) is the debt-to-value ratio of the project, D s = D - T s, and T s is the 
value of predetermined interest tax shields, and f = T s/(tc D) reflects the permanence of the 
debt level.
	
n	 The WACC method does not need to be modified to account for investor taxes. For the APV 
method, we use the interest rate
	
r*D K rD 
(1 - ti)
(1 - te)
(18.23)
	
	 in place of rD and we replace tc with the effective tax rate:
	
t* = 1 -
(1 - tc )(1 - te)
(1 - ti)

(18.25)
	
n	 If the investment’s leverage or risk does not match the firm’s, then investor tax rates are 
required even with the WACC method, as we must unlever and/or re-lever the firm’s cost of 
capital using 
	
rU =
E
E + D s rE +
D s
E + D s r*D

7.	 Acort Industries has 10 million shares outstanding and a current share price of $36 per share. 
It also has long-term debt outstanding. This debt is risk free, is four years away from maturity, 
has annual coupons with a coupon rate of 10%, and has a $115 million face value. The first 
of the remaining coupon payments will be due in exactly one year. The riskless interest rates 
for all maturities are constant at 6%. Acort has EBIT of $101 million, which is expected to 
remain constant each year. New capital expenditures are expected to equal depreciation and 
equal $18 million per year, while no changes to net working capital are expected in the future. 
The corporate tax rate is 42%, and Acort is expected to keep its debt-equity ratio constant in

Project-Based Costs of Capital
	
13.	 Prokter and Gramble (PKGR) has historically maintained a debt-equity ratio of approximately 
0.16. Its current stock price is $48 per share, with 2.6 billion shares outstanding. The firm 
enjoys very stable demand for its products, and consequently it has a low equity beta of 0.4 and 
can borrow at 4.7%, just 20 basis points over the risk-free rate of 4.5%. The expected return of 
the market is 10.2%, and PKGR’s tax rate is 32%.
a.	 This year, PKGR is expected to have free cash flows of $5.8 billion. What constant expected 
growth rate of free cash flow is consistent with its current stock price?
b.	 PKGR believes it can increase debt without any serious risk of distress or other costs. With a 
higher debt-equity ratio of 0.4, it believes its borrowing costs will rise only slightly to 5%. If 
PKGR announces that it will raise its debt-equity ratio to 0.4 through a leveraged recap, deter-
mine the increase in the stock price that would result from the anticipated tax savings.
	
14.	 Amarindo, Inc. (AMR), is a newly public firm with 10.5 million shares outstanding. You are 
doing a valuation analysis of AMR. You estimate its free cash flow in the coming year to be 
$15.37 million, and you expect the firm’s free cash flows to grow by 4.4% per year in subse-
quent years. Because the firm has only been listed on the stock exchange for a short time, you 
do not have an accurate assessment of AMR’s equity beta. However, you do have beta data for 
UAL, another firm in the same industry:
	
	 AMR has a much lower debt-equity ratio of 0.36, which is expected to remain stable, and its 
debt is risk free. AMR’s corporate tax rate is 25%, the risk-free rate is 5.5%, and the expected 
return on the market portfolio is 11.3%.
a.	 Estimate AMR’s equity cost of capital.
b.	 Estimate AMR’s share price.
	
15.	 Remex (RMX) currently has no debt in its capital structure. The beta of its equity is 1.32. For 
each year into the indefinite future, Remex’s free cash flow is expected to equal $21 million. 
Remex is considering changing its capital structure by issuing debt and using the proceeds to 
buy back stock. It will do so in such a way that it will have a 28% debt-equity ratio after the 
change, and it will maintain this debt-equity ratio forever. Assume that Remex’s debt cost of 
capital will be 6.76%. Remex faces a corporate tax rate of 32%. Except for the corporate tax rate 
of 32%, there are no market imperfections. Assume that the CAPM holds, the risk-free rate of 
interest is 5.2%, and the expected return on the market is 11.44%.

APV with Other Leverage Policies
	
16.	 You are evaluating a project that requires an investment of $108 today and provides a single 
cash flow of $118 for sure one year from now. You decide to use 100% debt financing, that is, 
you will borrow $108. The risk-free rate is 4% and the tax rate is 33%. Assume that the invest-
ment is fully depreciated at the end of the year, so without leverage you would owe taxes on the 
difference between the project cash flow and the investment, that is, $10.
a.	 Calculate the NPV of this investment opportunity using the APV method.
b.	 Using your answer to part (a), calculate the WACC of the project.

17.	 Tybo Corporation adjusts its debt so that its interest expenses are 21% of its free cash flow. Tybo 
is considering an expansion that will generate free cash flows of $2.16 million this year and is 
expected to grow at a rate of 3.8% per year from then on. Suppose Tybo’s marginal corporate 
tax rate is 40%.

NPV at 11% Equity Cost of Capital
6.0

Looking over the spreadsheet, you realize that while all of the cash flow estimates are correct, 
your associate used the flow-to-equity valuation method and discounted the cash flows using 
the company’s equity cost of capital of 11%. While the project’s risk is similar to the firm’s, the 
project’s incremental leverage is very different from the company’s historical debt-equity ratio 
of 0.20: For this project, the company will instead borrow $80 million upfront and repay $20 
million in year 2, $20 million in year 3, and $40 million in year 4. Thus, the project’s equity 
cost of capital is likely to be higher than the firm’s, not constant over time—invalidating your 
associate’s calculation.
	
	 Clearly, the FTE approach is not the best way to analyze this project. Fortunately, you have your 
calculator with you, and with any luck you can use a better method before the meeting starts.
a.	 What is the present value of the interest tax shield associated with this project?

19.	 Your firm is considering building a $597 million plant to manufacture HDTV circuitry. You 
expect operating profits (EBITDA) of $141 million per year for the next 10 years. The plant 
will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over 10 years (assuming no salvage value for tax pur-
poses). After 10 years, the plant will have a salvage value of $297 million (which, since it will 
be fully depreciated, is then taxable). The project requires $50 million in working capital at the 
start, which will be recovered in year 10 when the project shuts down. The corporate tax rate is 
35%. All cash flows occur at the end of the year.
a.	 If the risk-free rate is 4.7%, the expected return of the market is 10.9%, and the asset beta 
for the consumer electronics industry is 1.72, what is the NPV of the project?
b.	 Suppose that you can finance $478 million of the cost of the plant using 10-year, 9.3% 
coupon bonds sold at par. This amount is incremental new debt associated specifically with 
this project and will not alter other aspects of the firm’s capital structure. What is the value 
of the project, including the tax shield of the debt?
Other Effects of Financing
	
20.	 Parnassus Corporation plans to invest $150 million in a new generator that will produce free 
cash flows of $20 million per year in perpetuity. The firm is all equity financed, with an equity 
cost of capital of 10%.
a.	 What is the NPV of the project ignoring any costs of raising funds?
b.	 Suppose the firm will issue new equity to raise the $150 million, and has after-tax issuance 
costs equal to 8% of the proceeds. What is the NPV of the project including these issuance 
costs, assuming all future free cash flows generated by it will be paid out?
c.	 Suppose that instead of paying out the project’s future free cash flows, a substantial portion 
of these free cash flows will be retained and invested in other projects, reducing Parnassus’ 
required fundraising in the future. Specifically, suppose the firm will reinvest all free cash 
flows for the next 10 years, and then pay out the cash flows after that. If its issuance costs 
remain constant at 8%, what is the NPV of the project including issuance costs in this case?
	
21.	 DFS Corporation is currently an all-equity firm, with assets with a market value of ­$155 ­mil­-
lion and 4 million shares outstanding. DFS is considering a leveraged recapitalization to boost 
its share price. The firm plans to raise a fixed amount of permanent debt (i.e., the outstanding 
principal will remain constant) and use the proceeds to repurchase shares. DFS pays a 25% 
corporate tax rate, so one motivation for taking on the debt is to reduce the firm’s tax liability. 
However, the upfront investment banking fees associated with the recapitalization will be 1% 
of the amount of debt raised. Adding leverage will also create the possibility of future financial 
distress or agency costs; shown below are DFS’s estimates for different levels of debt:

Data Case
Toyota Motor Company is expanding the production of their gas-electric hybrid drive systems and 
plans to shift production in the United States. To enable the expansion, they are contemplating 
investing $1.5 billion in a new plant with an expected 10-year life. The anticipated free cash flows 
from the new plant would be $220 million the first year of operation and grow by 10% for each of 
the next two years and then 5% per year for the remaining seven years. As a newly hired MBA in 
the capital budgeting division you have been asked to evaluate the new project using the WACC, 
Adjusted Present Value, and Flow-to-Equity methods. You will compute the appropriate costs of 
capital and the net present values with each method. Because this is your first major assignment 
with the firm, they want you to demonstrate that you are capable of handling the different valua-
tion methods. You must seek out the information necessary to value the free cash flows but will be 
provided some directions to follow. (This is an involved assignment, but at least you don’t have to

Chapter 18 Appendix:  Foundations and Further Details	
717
Foundations and Further Details
In this appendix, we look at the foundations for the WACC method, and for the relation-
ship between a firm’s levered and unlevered costs of capital. We also address how we can 
solve for a firm’s leverage policy and value simultaneously.
Deriving the WACC Method
The WACC can be used to value a levered investment, as in Eq. 18.2. Consider an invest-
ment that is financed by both debt and equity. Because equity holders require an expected 
return of rE on their investment and debt holders require a return of rD, the firm will have 
to pay investors a total of
	
E(1 + rE) + D(1 + rD)	
(18.A1)
next year. What is the value of the investment next year? The project generates free cash 
flows of FCF1 at the end of the year. In addition, the interest tax shield of the debt provides 
a tax savings of tc * (interest on debt)  tc rD D.27 Finally, if the investment will continue 
beyond next year, it will have a continuation value of V L
1. Thus, to satisfy investors, the 
project cash flows must be such that
	
E (1 + rE) + D (1 + rD) = FCF1 + tcrDD + V L
1	
(18A.2)
Because V L
0 = E + D, we can write the WACC definition in Eq. 18.1 as
	
rwacc = E
V L
0
 rE + D
V L
0
 rD(1 - tc )	
(18.A3)
If we move the interest tax shield to the left side of Eq. 18A.2, we can use the definition 
of the WACC to rewrite Eq. 18A.2 as follows:
	
E (1 + rE) + D[1 + rD(1 - tc)] = FCF1 + V L
1
 
	
V0
L(1+rwacc)
	
(18.A4)
27⁜The return on the debt rD need not come solely from interest payments. If Ct is the coupon paid and Dt 
is the market value of the debt in period t, then in period t, rD is defined as
rD =
E [Coupon Payment + Capital Gain]
Current Price
=
E [C t +1 + Dt +1 - Dt]
Dt
The return that determines the firm’s interest expense is
rD =
E [Ct +1 + Dt +1 - Dt]
Dt
where Dt is the value of the debt on date t according to a fixed schedule set by the tax code based on 
the difference between the bond’s initial price and its face value, which is called the bond’s original issue 
discount (OID). (If the bond is issued at par and the firm will not default on the next coupon, then 
Dt = Dt +1 and rD = Ct +1/Dt , which is the bond’s current yield.) Thus, the true after-tax cost of debt is 
(rD - tc rD). In practice, the distinction between rD and rD is often ignored, and the after-tax cost of debt 
is computed as rD(1 - tc ). Also, the debt’s yield to maturity is often used in place of rD. Because the yield 
ignores default risk, it overstates rD and thus the WACC. See Chapter 12 for alternative methods.

Dividing by (1 + rwacc), we can express the value of the investment today as the present 
value of next period’s free cash flows and continuation value:
	
V L
0 =
FCF1 + V L
1
1 + rwacc
	
(18.A5)
In the same way, we can write the value in one year, V L
1, as the discounted value of the 
free cash flows and continuation value of the project in year 2. If the WACC is the same 
next year, then
	
V L

(18.A7)
That is, the value of a levered investment is the present value of its future free cash flows using 
the weighted average cost of capital.
The Levered and Unlevered Cost of Capital
In this appendix, we derive the relationship between the levered and unlevered cost of capital 
for the firm. Suppose an investor holds a portfolio of all of the equity and debt of the firm. 
Then the investor will receive the free cash flows of the firm plus the tax savings from the 
interest tax shield. These are the same cash flows an investor would receive from a portfolio 
of the unlevered firm (which generates the free cash flows) and a separate “tax shield” security 
that paid the investor the amount of the tax shield each period. Because these two portfolios 
generate the same cash flows, by the Law of One Price they have the same market values:
	
V L = E + D = V U + T 	
(18.A8)
where T is the present value of the interest tax shield. Equation 18.A8 is the basis of the 
APV method. Because these portfolios have equal cash flows, they must also have identical 
expected returns, which implies
	
E rE + D rD = V UrU + Tr T	
(18.A9)
where rT is the expected return associated with the interest tax shields. The relationship 
between rE, rD , and rU will depend on the expected return rT, which is determined by the 
risk of the interest tax shield. Let’s consider the two cases discussed in the text.
Target Leverage Ratio
Suppose the firm adjusts its debt continuously to maintain a target debt-to-value ratio, or a 
target ratio of interest to free cash flow. Because the firm’s debt and interest payments will 
vary with the firm’s value and cash flows, it is reasonable to expect the risk of the interest 
28This expansion is the same approach we took in Chapter 9 to derive the discounted dividend formula 
for the stock price.

tax shield will equal that of the firm’s free cash flow, so rT = rU. Making this assumption, 
which we return to below, Eq. 18A.9 becomes
	
 E rE + D rD = V UrU + TrU = (V U + T )rU
	
 = (E + D)rU	
(18.A10)
Dividing by (E + D) leads to Eq. 18.6.
Predetermined Debt Schedule
Suppose some of the firm’s debt is set according to a predetermined schedule that is inde-
pendent of the growth of the firm. Suppose the value of the tax shield from the scheduled 
debt is T s, and the remaining value of the tax shield T - T s is from debt that will be 
adjusted according to a target leverage ratio. Because the risk of the interest tax shield from 
the scheduled debt is similar to the risk of the debt itself, Eq. 18A.9 becomes
	
E rE + D rD = V UrU + TrT = V UrU + (T - T s )rU + T srD	
(18.A11)
Subtracting T srD from both sides, and using Ds = D - T s,
	
 E rE + DsrD = (V U + T - T s )rU = (V L - T s)rU
	
 = (E + Ds )rU	
(18.A12)
Dividing by (E + Ds ) leads to Eq. 18.20.
Risk of the Tax Shield with a Target Leverage Ratio
Above, we assumed that with a target leverage ratio, it is reasonable to assume that rT = rU. 
Under what circumstances should this be the case?
We define a target leverage ratio as a setting in which the firm adjusts its debt at date t 
to be a proportion d(t) of the investment’s value, or a proportion k(t) of its free cash flow. 
(The target ratio for either policy need not be constant over time, but can vary according 
to a predetermined schedule.)
With either policy, the value at date t of the incremental tax shield from the project’s 
free cash flow at date s, FCFs , is proportional to the value of the cash flow V L
t (FCFs), so it 
should be discounted at the same rate as FCFs. Therefore, the assumption rT = rU follows 
as long as at each date the cost of capital associated with the value of each future free cash 
flow is the same (a standard assumption in capital budgeting).29
Solving for Leverage and Value Simultaneously
When we use the APV method, we need to know the debt level to compute the interest tax 
shield and determine the project’s value. But if a firm maintains a constant debt-to-value 
ratio, we need to know the project’s value to determine the debt level. How can we apply 
the APV method in this case?
When a firm maintains a constant leverage ratio, to use the APV method we must solve 
for the debt level and the project value simultaneously. While complicated to do by hand, 
it is (fortunately) easy to do in Excel. We begin with the spreadsheet shown in Table 18A.1, 
which illustrates the standard APV calculation outlined in Section 18.3 of the text. For 
now, we have just inserted arbitrary values for the project’s debt capacity in line 3.
29If the risk of the individual cash flows differs, then rT will be a weighted average of the unlevered costs of 
capital of the individual cash flows, with the weights depending on the schedule d or k. See P. DeMarzo, 
“Discounting Tax Shields and the Unlevered Cost of Capital,” 2005, ssrn.com/abstract=1488437.

Chapter 18  Capital Budgeting and Valuation with Leverage 
Note that the debt capacity specified in line 3 is not consistent with a 50% debt-to-
value ratio for the project. For example, given the value of $60.98 million in year 0, the 
initial debt capacity should be 50% * $60.98 million = $30.49 million in year 0. But if 
we change each debt capacity in line 3 to a numerical value that is 50% of the value in line 
7, the interest tax shield and the project’s value will change, and we will still not have a 
50% debt-to-value ratio.
The solution is to enter in line 3 a formula that sets the debt capacity to be 50% of the 
project’s value in line 7 in the same year. Now line 7 depends on line 3, and line 3 depends 
on line 7, creating a circular reference in the spreadsheet (and you will most likely receive 
an error message). By changing the calculation option in Excel to calculate the spreadsheet 
iteratively (File 7 Options 7 Formulas and check the Enable iterative calculation box), 
Excel will keep calculating until the values in line 3 and line 7 of the spreadsheet are con-
sistent, as shown in Table 18A.2.

Thus we calculate the same NPV = V L
0 - FCF0 = 61.25 - 28 = $33.25 million as in 
­Section 18.1.
The same method can be applied when using the WACC method with known debt 
levels. In that case, we need to know the project’s value to determine the debt-to-value ratio 
and compute the WACC, and we need to know the WACC to compute the project’s value. 
Again, we can use iteration within Excel to determine simultaneously the project’s value 
and debt-to-value ratio.

The Residual Income and Economic Value 
Added Valuation Methods
An alternative valuation method developed primarily in the accounting literature is the resid-
ual income method.30 A company’s residual income in year t is defined as its net income less 
a charge for the required return on stockholders’ equity (using the equity cost of capital rE):
	
Residual Incomet = Net Incomet - rE * Book Value of Equityt -1
	
= (ROEt - rE) * Book Value of Equityt -1	
(18.A13)
We can think of residual income as the firm’s profit in excess of the required return on 
its equity, and can be thought of as a measure of the equity value added to the firm. The 
residual income is positive if and only if the firms accounting return on equity, or ROE, 
exceeds its equity cost of capital.
The residual income valuation method states that the market value of the firm’s equity 
should equal its book value plus the present value of its future residual income. That is, 
if we write E0 for the market value and BE0 for the book value of equity at the end of the 
period, and RIt for the residual income in year t :
Residual Income Valuation Method
	
E0 = BE0 + PV (Residual Income) = BE0 + a

t =1
RIt
(1 + rE)t	
(18.A14)
The residual income method is equivalent to the Flow-to-Equity method described in 
Section 18.4. Recall that in the FTE method, we value equity as the present value of FCFE, 
the total cash flows paid out to shareholders. Because the book value of the firm’s shares 
increases each year by net income (NI) less any payouts to shareholders (FCFE), we have
	
BEt = BEt -1 + NIt - FCFEt	
(18.A15)
Then we can rewrite FCFE, using Eq. 18.A15 and Eq. 18.A13, as
FCFEt = NIt + BEt -1 -BEt = RIt+(1 + rE) BEt -1 -BEt
Taking present values, we see that all of the BE terms with t Ú 1 cancel, so that
E0 = PV (FCFE ) = PV (RI ) + BE0
Note that Eq. 18.A14 presumes the equity cost of capital is constant over time, which only 
holds if the firm has a target leverage ratio. Otherwise, we must compute rE period by 
period as in Table 18.10.
Note that we can also apply the Residual Income method to value a project. In that case, 
if we assume the initial and ending book value of equity for the project is zero, then 
	
NPV (Project) = PV (Incremental Residual Income)	
(18.A16)
Table 18A.3 applies this approach to value Avco’s RFX project assuming a target leverage 
ratio of d = 50%. Note that to compute the residual income from the project, we consider 
only its incremental contribution to the book value of equity from the balance sheet. In 
this example, because the incremental debt from the project exceeds the book value of the 
equipment, the incremental equity (and thus the equity charge) is negative.
30See e.g. J. A. Ohlson, “Earnings, Book Values, and Dividends in Equity Valuation,” Contemporary 
Accounting Research (1995): 661–687.

Unlevered Net Income
We can use a similar logic to develop an alternative equation for the WACC method. 
Here we begin with a measure of economic value added equal to the firm’s unlevered net 
income less a charge for the required return on the firm’s total invested capital (both equity 
and debt). We measure total invested capital as the firm’s book enterprise value:
	
Invested Capital = Book Value of Equity + Net Debt = Book Enterprise Value	(18.A17)
Then economic value added in year t is defined as
	
Economic Value Addedt = EBITt * (1- tc) - rwacc * Book Enterprise Valuet -1
	
= (ROICt - rwacc) * Book Enterprise Valuet -1	
(18.A18)
We can see that economic value added is only positive if the firm’s return on invested capi-
tal, or ROIC, exceeds its weighted-average cost of capital. Because 
	
BEVt = BEVt-1 + EBITt(1 - tc) - FCFt,	
(18.A19)
we can then show that the WACC method is equivalent to the firm’s current (market) 
enterprise value (V0) being equal to its book enterprise value (BEV0) plus the present value 
of future economic value added (EVA):
Economic Value Added Valuation Method
	
V0 = BEV0 + PV (Economic Value Added) = BEV0 + a

t =1
EVAt
(1 + rwacc)t	
(18.A20)
Again, we can apply this method to compute the NPV of a project. Assuming the starting 
and ending incremental book enterprise value from the project is zero, we have 
	
NPV (Project) = PV (Incremental EVA)

Valuation and Financial 
Modeling:  
A Case Study
the GOaL OF thIS Chapter IS tO appLY the FINaNCIaL tools 
we have developed thus far to demonstrate how they are used in practice to build a 
valuation model of a firm. In this chapter, we will value a hypothetical firm, Ideko Corpo-
ration. Ideko is a privately held designer and manufacturer of specialty sports eyewear 
based in Chicago. In mid-2005, its owner and founder, June Wong, has decided to sell 
the business, after having relinquished management control about four years ago. As a 
partner in KKP Investments, you are investigating purchasing the company. If a deal can 
be reached, the acquisition will take place at the end of the current fiscal year. In that 
event, KKP plans to implement operational and financial improvements at Ideko over 
the next five years, after which it intends to sell the business.
Ideko has total assets of $87 million and annual sales of $75 million. The firm is 
also quite profitable, with earnings this year of almost $7 million, for a net profit margin 
of 9.3%. You believe a deal could be struck to purchase Ideko’s equity at the end of 
this fiscal year for an acquisition price of $150 million, which is almost double Ideko’s 
current book value of equity. Is this price reasonable?
We begin the chapter by estimating Ideko’s value using data for comparable firms. 
We then review KKP’s operating strategies for running the business after the acquisi-
tion, to identify potential areas for improvements. We build a financial model to project 
cash flows that reflect these operating improvements. These cash flow forecasts enable 
us to value Ideko using the APV model introduced in Chapter 18 and estimate the 
return on KKP’s investment. Finally, we explore the sensitivity of the valuation estimates 
to our main assumptions.

Chapter 19  Valuation and Financial Modeling: A Case Study 
	
19.1	 Valuation Using Comparables
As a result of preliminary conversations with Ideko’s founder, you have estimates of Ideko’s 
income and balance sheet information for the current fiscal year shown in Table 19.1. 
Ideko currently has debt outstanding of $4.5 million, but it also has a substantial cash bal-
ance. To obtain your first estimate of Ideko’s value, you decide to value Ideko by examin-
ing comparable firms.
A quick way to gauge the reasonableness of the proposed price for Ideko is to compare 
it to that of other publicly traded firms using the method of comparable firms introduced 
in Chapter 9. For example, at a price of $150 million, Ideko’s price-earnings (P/E) ratio is 
150,000/6939 = 21.6, roughly equal to the market average P/E ratio in mid-2005.
It is even more informative to compare Ideko to firms in a similar line of business. 
Although no firm is exactly comparable to Ideko in terms of its overall product line, three 
firms with which it has similarities are Oakley, Inc.; Luxottica Group; and Nike, Inc. The 
closest competitor is Oakley, which also designs and manufactures sports eyewear. Luxot-
tica Group is an Italian eyewear maker, but much of its business is prescription eyewear; 
it also owns and operates a number of retail eyewear chains. Nike is a manufacturer of 
specialty sportswear products, but its primary focus is footwear. You also decide to compare 
Ideko to a portfolio of firms in the sporting goods industry.
A comparison of Ideko’s proposed valuation to this peer set, as well as to the average firm in 
the sporting goods industry, appears in Table 19.2. The table not only lists P/E ratios, but also 
shows each firm’s enterprise value (EV ) as a multiple of sales and EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization). Recall that enterprise value is the total value of 
equity plus net debt, where net debt is debt less cash and investments in marketable securities 
that are not required as part of normal operations. Ideko has $4.5 million in debt, and you 
estimate that it holds $6.5 million of cash in excess of its working capital needs. Thus, Ideko’s 
enterprise value at the proposed acquisition price is 150 + 4.5 - 6.5 = $148 million.
At the proposed price, Ideko’s P/E ratio is low relative to those of Oakley and Luxottica, 
although it is somewhat above the P/E ratios of Nike and the industry overall. The same

19.1  Valuation Using Comparables	
725
can be said for Ideko’s valuation as a multiple of sales. Thus, based on these two measures, 
Ideko looks “cheap” relative to Oakley and Luxottica, but is priced at a premium relative to 
Nike and the average sporting goods firm. The deal stands out, however, when you com-
pare Ideko’s enterprise value relative to EBITDA. The acquisition price of just over nine 
times EBITDA is below that of all of the comparable firms as well as the industry average. 
Note also Ideko’s high profit margins: At 16,250/75,000 = 21.7%, its EBITDA margin 
exceeds that of all of the comparables.
While Table 19.2 provides some reassurance that the acquisition price is reasonable com-
pared to other firms in the industry, it by no means establishes that the acquisition is a good 
investment opportunity. As with any such comparison, the multiples in Table 19.2 vary sub-
stantially. Furthermore, they ignore important differences such as the operating efficiency 
and growth prospects of the firms, and they do not reflect KKP’s plans to improve Ideko’s 
operations. To assess whether this investment is attractive requires a careful analysis both 
of the operational aspects of the firm and of the ultimate cash flows the deal is expected to 
generate and the return that should be required.
Example 19.1
Valuation by Comparables
Problem
What range of acquisition prices for Ideko is implied by the range of multiples for P/E, EV/Sales, 
and EV/EBITDA in Table 19.2?
Solution
For each multiple, we can find the highest and lowest values across all three firms and the industry 
portfolio. Applying each multiple to the data for Ideko in Table 19.1 yields the following results:
For example, Nike has the lowest P/E multiple of 18.2. Multiplying this P/E by Ideko’s earnings 
of $6.94 million gives a value of 18.2 * 6.94 = $126.3 million. The highest multiple of enterprise 
value to sales is 2.7 (Luxottica); at this multiple, Ideko’s enterprise value is 2.7 * 75 = $202.5 
million. Adding Ideko’s excess cash and subtracting its debt implies a purchase price of 
202.5 + 6.5 - 4.5 = $204.5 million. The table above demonstrates that while comparables 
provide a useful benchmark, they cannot be relied upon for a precise estimate of value.

1.	 What is the purpose of the valuation using comparables?
	
2.	 If the valuation using comparables indicates the acquisition price is reasonable compared to other 
firms in the industry, does it establish that the acquisition is a good investment opportunity?
	
19.2	 The Business Plan
While comparables provide a useful starting point, whether this acquisition is a successful 
investment for KKP depends on Ideko’s post-acquisition performance. Thus, it is neces-
sary to look in detail at Ideko’s operations, investments, and capital structure, and to assess 
its potential for improvements and future growth.
Operational Improvements
On the operational side, you are quite optimistic regarding the company’s prospects. The 
market is expected to grow by 5% per year, and Ideko produces a superior product. Ideko’s 
market share has not grown in recent years because current management has devoted insuf-
ficient resources to product development, sales, and marketing. Conversely, Ideko has 
overspent on administrative costs. Indeed, Table 19.1 reveals that Ideko’s current adminis-
trative expenses are 13,500/75,000 = 18% of sales, a rate that exceeds its expenditures on 
sales and marketing (15% of sales). This is in stark contrast to its rivals, which spend less 
on administrative overhead than they do on sales and marketing.
KKP plans to cut administrative costs immediately and redirect resources to new prod-
uct development, sales, and marketing. By doing so, you believe Ideko can increase its 
market share from 10% to 15% over the next five years. The increased sales demand can 
be met in the short run using the existing production lines by increasing overtime and 
running some weekend shifts. However, once the growth in volume exceeds 50%, Ideko 
will definitely need to undertake a major expansion to increase its manufacturing capacity.
The spreadsheet in Table 19.3 shows sales and operating cost assumptions for the next 
five years based on this plan. In the spreadsheet, numbers in blue represent data that has 
been entered, whereas numbers in black are calculated based on the data provided. For 
example, given the current market size of 10 million units and an expected growth rate of 
5% per year, the spreadsheet calculates the expected market size in years 1 through 5. Also 
shown is the expected growth in Ideko’s market share.

19.2  The Business Plan	
727
Note that Ideko’s average selling price is expected to increase because of a 2% inflation 
rate each year. Likewise, manufacturing costs are expected to rise. Raw materials are fore-
cast to increase at a 1% rate and, although you expect some productivity gains, labor costs 
will rise at a 4% rate due to additional overtime. The table also shows the reallocation of 
resources from administration to sales and marketing over the five-year period.
Example 19.2
Production Capacity Requirements
Problem
Based on the data in Table 19.3, what production capacity will Ideko require each year? When 
will an expansion be necessary?
Solution
Production volume each year can be estimated by multiplying the total market size and Ideko’s 
market share in Table 19.3:
Based on this forecast, production volume will exceed its current level by 50% by 2008, neces-
sitating an expansion then.

Capital Expenditures: A Needed Expansion
The spreadsheet in Table 19.4 shows the forecast for Ideko’s capital expenditures over 
the next five years. Based on the estimates for capital expenditures and depreciation, this 
spreadsheet tracks the book value of Ideko’s plant, property, and equipment starting from 
its level at the beginning of 2005. Note that investment is expected to remain at its current 
level over the next two years, which is roughly equal to the level of depreciation. Ideko will 
expand its production during this period by using its existing plant more efficiently. In 
2008, however, a major expansion of the plant will be necessary, leading to a large increase 
in capital expenditures in 2008 and 2009.
The depreciation entries in Table 19.4 are based on the appropriate depreciation sched-
ule for each type of property. Those calculations are quite specific to the nature of the 
property and are not detailed here. The depreciation shown will be used for tax purposes.1
1Firms often maintain separate books for accounting and tax purposes, and they may use different depre-
ciation assumptions for each. Remember that because depreciation affects cash flows through its tax con-
sequences, tax depreciation is more relevant for valuation.

Chapter 19  Valuation and Financial Modeling: A Case Study 
Working Capital Management
To compensate for its weak sales and marketing efforts, Ideko has sought to retain the loy-
alty of its retailers in part by maintaining a very lax credit policy. This policy affects Ideko’s 
working capital requirements: For every extra day that customers take to pay, another 
day’s sales revenue is added to accounts receivable (rather than received in cash). From 
Ideko’s current income statement and balance sheet (Table 19.1), we can estimate the 
number of days of receivables:
 Accounts Receivable Days = Accounts Receivable ($)
Sales Revenue ($/yr)
* 365 days/yr
	
 = 18,493
75,000
* 365 days = 90 days
(19.1)
The standard for the industry is 60 days, and you believe that Ideko can tighten its credit 
policy to achieve this goal without sacrificing many sales.
You also hope to improve Ideko’s inventory management. Ideko’s balance sheet in 
Table 19.1 lists inventory of $6.165 million. Of this amount, approximately $2 million 
corresponds to raw materials, while the rest is finished goods. Given raw material expendi-
tures of $16 million for the year, Ideko currently holds (2/16) * 365 = 45.6 days’ worth 
of raw material inventory. While maintaining a certain amount of inventory is necessary 
to avoid production stoppages, you believe that, with tighter controls of the production 
process, 30 days’ worth of inventory will be adequate.
Capital Structure Changes: Levering Up
With little debt, excess cash, and substantial earnings, Ideko appears to be significantly 
underleveraged. You plan to greatly increase the firm’s debt, and have obtained bank com-
mitments for loans of $100 million should an agreement be reached. These term loans will 
have an interest rate of 6.8%, and Ideko will pay interest only during the next five years. 
The firm will seek additional financing in 2008 and 2009 associated with the expansion of 
its manufacturing plant, as shown in the spreadsheet in Table 19.5. While Ideko’s credit 
quality should improve over time, the steep slope of the yield curve suggests interest rates 
may increase; therefore, on balance, you expect Ideko’s borrowing rate to remain at 6.8%.
Given Ideko’s outstanding debt, its interest expense each year is computed as2
	
Interest in Year t = Interest Rate * Ending Balance in Year (t - 1)
(19.2)
The interest on the debt will provide a valuable tax shield to offset Ideko’s taxable income.
2Equation 19.2 assumes that changes in debt occur at the end of the year. If debt changes throughout the 
year, it is more accurate to compute interest expenses based on the average level of debt during the year.

In addition to the tax benefit, the loan will allow KKP to limit its investment in Ideko 
and preserve its capital for other investments and acquisitions. The sources and uses of 
funds for the acquisition are shown in Table 19.6. In addition to the $150 million pur-
chase price for Ideko’s equity, $4.5 million will be used to repay Ideko’s existing debt. 
With $5 million in advisory and other fees associated with the transaction, the acquisi-
tion will require $159.5 million in total funds. KKP’s sources of funds include the new 
loan of $100 million as well as Ideko’s own excess cash (which KKP will have access to). 
Thus, KKP’s required equity contribution to the transaction is 159.5 - 100 - 6.5 = $53 
million.
Concept Check	
1.	 What are the different operational improvements KKP plans to make?
	
2.	 Why is it necessary to consider these improvements to assess whether the acquisition is attractive?
	
19.3	 Building the Financial Model
The value of any investment opportunity arises from the future cash flows it will generate. 
To estimate the cash flows resulting from the investment in Ideko, we begin by projecting 
Ideko’s future earnings. We then consider Ideko’s working capital and investment needs 
and estimate its free cash flow. With these data in hand, we can forecast Ideko’s balance 
sheet and statement of cash flows.
Forecasting Earnings
We can forecast Ideko’s income statement for the five years following the acquisition based 
on the operational and capital structure changes proposed. This income statement is often 
referred to as a pro forma income statement, because it is not based on actual data but 
rather depicts the firm’s financials under a given set of hypothetical assumptions. The pro 
forma income statement translates our expectations regarding the operational improve-
ments KKP can achieve at Ideko into consequences for the firm’s earnings.
To build the pro forma income statement, we begin with Ideko’s sales. Each year, sales 
can be calculated from the estimates in Table 19.3 as follows:
	
Sales = Market Size * Market Share * Average Sales Price	
(19.3)
For example, in 2006, Ideko has projected sales of 10.5 million * 11% * 76.5 = $88.358 
million. The spreadsheet in Table 19.7 shows Ideko’s current (2005) sales as well as projec-
tions for five years after the acquisition (2006–2010).

Chapter 19  Valuation and Financial Modeling: A Case Study 
has been a fertile investment area  
for CD&R. These divestiture buy-
outs tend to be complex and require 
experience and patience to execute. 
For example, we were in discussions 
with Ford management for three years 
prior to leading the Hertz division 
acquisition.
After running a series of projections 
based on information from manage-
ment, we develop a capital structure 
designed to insure the viability of the 
acquisition candidate. We are relatively 
unconcerned with EPS but are very 
return conscious, focusing on cash and 
creating long-term shareholder value. 
We must also believe that we can gener-
ate a return on equity that meets our 
standards and justifies our investors’ 
commitments to us.
We also acquire businesses con-
fronting strategic issues where our operating expertise 
can bring value, such as Kinko’s, a great brand franchise 
that we reorganized and expanded. We prefer service and 
distribution businesses to large manufacturers because 
of the wage differential between Asia and the United 
States and Europe. We also prefer businesses with a 
diversity of suppliers and customers and where there are 
multiple levers under our control to improve operating 
performance.
QUESTION: Post acquisition, what is the role of the private 
equity firm?
ANSWER: CD&R brings both a hands-on ownership style 
and capital. After closing a transaction, we assess current 
management’s capability to do the job our investment case 
calls for. If necessary, we build and strengthen the manage-
ment team. Then we work with them to determine the 
appropriate strategy to produce outstanding results. Finally, 
we aggressively pursue productivity, cost reduction, and 
growth initiatives to enhance operating and financial per-
formance. At Kinko’s, we restructured 129 separate  
S-corporations into one centralized corporation and 
installed a new management team. Our key strategic deci-
sion was transforming Kinko’s from a loose confederation 
of consumer and small business-oriented copy shops into 
a highly networked company serving major corporations. 
In the end, that is what made the company an attractive 
acquisition for FedEx in 2004.
Joseph L. Rice, III is a founding partner 
and the former chairman of Clayton, 
Dubilier & Rice (CD&R). The firm is 
among the most respected private 
equity firms in the world. Its investments 
span a number of industry segments 
with enterprise values ranging from $1 
billion to $15 billion.
QUESTION: How has private equity 
business changed since you began in the 
industry?
ANSWER: The term “private equity” is 
very broad and today can cover virtually 
every kind of investing, short of invest-
ing in the stock or bond markets. The 
buyout business represents a significant 
component of the private equity market. 
Since I started in 1966, I’ve seen many 
changes as the asset class has matured. In 
the 1960s and 1970s, the buyout business had relatively little 
following. Limited capital availability kept transactions small, 
and we relied on unconventional funding sources. The total 
purchase price of my first transaction was approximately 
$3 million, financed through a secured bank line and from 
individuals contributing amounts ranging from $25,000 to 
$50,000. In contrast, in 2005, we bought Hertz from Ford 
for approximately $15 billion.
As the industry has evolved, the attractive returns 
generated from buyout investments has attracted broader 
interest from both institutions and high net worth 
individuals. Buyout firms apply a variety of value cre-
ation models, including financial engineering, multiple 
arbitrage, and industry sector bets, such as technology 
or healthcare. Today there is more focus on generating 
returns from improving business performance—which has 
always been CD&R’s underlying investment approach. 
The character of the businesses that we buy has also 
changed. Traditionally, this was an asset-heavy business, 
with much of the financing coming from banks that lent 
against percentages of inventory and receivables and the 
liquidation value of hard assets. Now it’s become more of 
a cash flow business.
QUESTION: What makes a company a good buyout candidate?
ANSWER: We look to acquire good businesses at fair 
prices. Acquiring non-core, underperforming divisions 
of large companies and making them more effective

19.3  Building the Financial Model	
731
The next items in the income statement detail the cost of goods sold. The raw materials 
cost can be calculated from sales as
	
Raw Materials = Market Size * Market Share * Raw Materials per Unit (19.4)
In 2006, the cost of raw materials is 10.5 million * 11% * 16.16 = $18.665 million. The 
same method can be applied to determine the direct labor costs. Sales, marketing, and 
administrative costs can be computed directly as a percentage of sales. For example:
	
Sales and Marketing = Sales * (Sales and Marketing % of Sales)	
(19.5)
Therefore, sales and marketing costs are forecast to be $88.358 million * 16.5% = $14.579 
million in 2006.
Deducting these operating expenses from Ideko’s sales, we can project EBITDA over the 
next five years as shown in line 8 of Table 19.7. Subtracting the depreciation expenses we 
estimated in Table 19.4, we arrive at Ideko’s earnings before interest and taxes. Next, we 
deduct interest expenses according to the schedule given in Table 19.5.3 The final expense 
is the corporate income tax, which we computed using the tax rate in Table 19.3 as
	
Income Tax = Pretax Income * Tax Rate	
(19.6)
After income taxes, we are left with Ideko’s projected pro forma net income as the bot-
tom line in Table 19.7. Based on our projections, net income will rise by 52% from $6.939 
million to $10.545 million at the end of five years, although it will drop in the near term 
due to the large increase in interest expense from the new debt.
3This interest expense should be offset by any interest earned on investments. As we discuss later in this 
chapter, we assume that Ideko does not invest its excess cash balances, but instead pays them out to its 
owner, KKP. Thus, net interest expenses are solely due to Ideko’s outstanding debt.

Chapter 19  Valuation and Financial Modeling: A Case Study 
Working Capital Requirements
The spreadsheet in Table 19.8 lists Ideko’s current working capital requirements and fore-
casts the firm’s future working capital needs. (See Chapter 26 for a further discussion of 
working capital requirements and their determinants.) This forecast includes the plans to 
tighten Ideko’s credit policy, speed up customer payments, and reduce Ideko’s inventory 
of raw materials.
Based on these working capital requirements, the spreadsheet in Table 19.9 forecasts 
Ideko’s net working capital (NWC) over the next five years. Each line item in the spread-
sheet is found by computing the appropriate number of days’ worth of the corresponding 
revenue or expense from the income statement (Table 19.7). For example, accounts receiv-
able in 2006 is calculated as4
	
 Accounts Receivable = Days Required * Annual Sales
365 days/yr
	
 = 60 days * $88.358 million/yr
365 days/yr
= $14.525 million (19.7)
4If products are highly seasonal, large fluctuations in working capital may occur over the course of the 
year. When these effects are important, it is best to develop forecasts on a quarterly or monthly basis so 
that the seasonal effects can be tracked.
Example 19.3
Forecasting Income
Problem
By what percentage is Ideko’s EBITDA expected to grow over the five-year period? By how much 
would it grow if Ideko’s market share remained at 10%?
Solution
EBITDA will increase from $16.25 million to $32.09 million, or (32.09/16.25) - 1 = 97%, 
over the five years. With a 10% market share rather than a 15% market share, sales will be only 
(10%/15%) = 66.7% of the forecast in Table 19.7. Because Ideko’s operating expenses are pro-
portional to its unit sales, its expenses and EBITDA will also be 66.7% of the current estimates. 
Thus, EBITDA will grow to 66.7% * 32.09 = $21.40 million, which is an increase of only 
(21.40/16.25) - 1 = 32%.

Similarly, Ideko’s inventory of finished goods will be 45 * (18.665 + 21.622)/365 = $4.967 
million.
Table 19.9 also lists Ideko’s minimum cash balance each year. This balance represents 
the minimum level of cash needed to keep the business running smoothly, allowing for 
the daily variations in the timing of income and expenses. Firms generally earn little or no 
interest on these balances, which are held in cash or in a checking or short-term savings 
accounts. As a consequence, we account for this opportunity cost by including the minimal 
cash balance as part of the firm’s working capital.
We assume that Ideko will earn no interest on this minimal balance. (If it did, this interest 
would reduce the firm’s net interest expense in the income statement.) We also assume that 
Ideko will pay out as dividends all cash not needed as part of working capital. Therefore, Ideko 
will hold no excess cash balances or short-term investments above the minimal level reported 
in Table 19.9. If Ideko were to retain excess funds, these balances would be considered part of 
its financing strategy (reducing its net debt), and not as part of its working capital.5
Ideko’s net working capital for each year is computed in Table 19.9 as the difference 
between the forecasted current assets and current liabilities. Increases in net working capital 
represent a cost to the firm. Note that as a result of the improvements in accounts receiv-
able and inventory management, Ideko will reduce its net working capital by more than 
$3.4 million in 2006. After this initial savings, working capital needs will increase in con-
junction with the growth of the firm.
Forecasting Free Cash Flow
We now have the data needed to forecast Ideko’s free cash flows over the next five years. 
Ideko’s earnings are available from the income statement (Table 19.7), as are its deprecia-
tion and interest expenses. Capital expenditures are available from Table 19.4, and changes 
in net working capital can be found in Table 19.9. We combine these items to estimate the 
free cash flows in the spreadsheet in Table 19.10.
5Firms often hold excess cash in anticipation of future investment needs or possible cash shortfalls. Because 
Ideko can rely on KKP to provide needed capital, excess cash reserves are unnecessary.

Chapter 19  Valuation and Financial Modeling: A Case Study 
To compute Ideko’s free cash flow, which excludes cash flows associated with leverage, 
we first adjust net income by adding back the after-tax interest payments associated with 
the net debt in its capital structure:6
	
After@Tax Interest Expense =
	
(1 - Tax Rate) * (Interest on Debt - Interest on Excess Cash)

(19.8)
Because Ideko has no excess cash, its after-tax interest expense in 2006 is (1 - 35%) * 6.8
= $4.42 million, providing unlevered net income of 5.193 + 4.42 = $9.613 million. 
We could also compute the unlevered net income in Table 19.10 by starting with EBIT 
and deducting taxes. In 2006, for example, EBIT is forecasted as $14.788 million, which 
amounts to 14.788 * (1 - 35%) = $9.613 million after taxes.
To compute Ideko’s free cash flow from its unlevered net income, we add back depre-
ciation (which is not a cash expense), and deduct Ideko’s increases in net working capital 
and capital expenditures. The free cash flow on line 7 of Table 19.10 shows the cash the 
firm will generate for its investors, both debt and equity holders. While Ideko will generate 
substantial free cash flow over the next five years, the level of free cash flow varies substan-
tially from year to year. It is highest in 2006 (due mostly to the large reduction in working 
capital) and is forecasted to be negative in 2008 (when the plant expansion will begin).
To determine the free cash flow to equity, we first add Ideko’s net borrowing (that is, 
increases to net debt):
	
Net Borrowing in Year t = Net Debt in Year t - Net Debt in Year (t - 1)
(19.9)
Ideko will borrow in 2008 and 2009 as part of its expansion. We then deduct the after-tax 
interest payments that were added in line 2.
As shown in the last line of Table 19.10, during the next five years Ideko is expected to 
generate a positive free cash flow to equity, which will be used to pay dividends to KKP. 
The free cash flow to equity will be highest in 2006; by 2010, KKP will recoup a significant 
fraction of its initial investment.
6If Ideko had some interest income or expenses from working capital, we would not include that interest 
here. We adjust only for interest that is related to the firm’s financing—that is, interest associated with debt 
and excess cash (cash not included as part of working capital).

Example 19.4
Leverage and Free Cash Flow
Problem
Suppose Ideko does not add leverage in 2008 and 2009, but instead keeps its debt fixed at $100 
million until 2010. How would this change in its leverage policy affect its expected free cash 
flow? How would it affect the free cash flow to equity?
Solution
Because free cash flow is based on unlevered net income, it will not be affected by Ideko’s lever-
age policy. Free cash flow to equity will be affected, however. Net borrowing will be zero each 
year, and the firm’s after-tax interest expense will remain at the 2006 level of $4.42 million:
In this case, Ideko will have a negative free cash flow to equity in 2008 and 2009. That is, without 
additional borrowing, KKP will have to invest additional capital in the firm to fund the expansion.

Summarizing Model 
Outputs
After completing our earnings and cash flow forecasts, it is helpful to create a summary table 
with key outputs from the model. The spreadsheet below highlights Ideko’s revenue, earnings, 
and cash flow forecasts. In addition to the raw numbers, we provide further context by calculat-
ing annual growth rates, margins, cumulative cash flows, and leverage multiples:
The summary above quickly reveals insights not immediately apparent from the raw num-
bers. First, note that while revenue is growing by 16.1% per year on average (as indicated by the 
compound annual growth rate), we see that year-over-year growth is declining over the forecast 
period. Second, EBITDA is growing more slowly than revenue (14.6% versus 16.1%) due to 
falling margins, indicating that Ideko’s operating expenses are growing faster than revenues. EBIT 
growth is higher, however, at 17.8% per year, because the firm’s improved capital efficiency means 
depreciation grows more slowly than revenues. Finally, net income growth is only 8.7% because 
of Ideko’s increased interest payments, though net profits margins begin to improve after 2008.
Note the higher variability of Ideko’s cash flows compared to earnings due to its fluctuat-
ing investment needs. The cumulative cash flows show that equity holders hope to recoup over 
$23 million, or nearly half their investment, from the first five years of dividends alone. Finally, 
the leverage multiples show that while initial leverage is high, Ideko will quickly reduce leverage 
and improve its interest coverage ratio.

Pro Forma Statement of Cash Flows for Ideko, 2005–2010
The Balance Sheet and Statement of Cash Flows (Optional)
The information we have calculated so far can be used to project Ideko’s balance sheet and 
statement of cash flows through 2010. While these statements are not critical for our valu-
ation, they often prove helpful in providing a more complete picture of how a firm will 
grow during the forecast period. These statements for Ideko are shown in the spreadsheets 
in Table 19.11 and Table 19.12.
The statement of cash flows in Table 19.11 starts with net income. Cash from operat-
ing activities includes depreciation as well as changes to working capital items (other than 
cash) from Table 19.9. Note that increases in accounts receivable or inventory are a use 
of cash, whereas an increase in accounts payable is a source of cash. Cash from investing 
activities includes the capital expenditures in Table 19.4. Cash from finan­cing activities 
includes changes in outstanding debt from Table 19.5, and dividends or stock issuance 
determined by the free cash flow to equity in Table 19.10. (If free cash flow to equity were 
negative in any year, it would appear as stock issuance in line 13 in Table 19.11.) As a final 
check on the calculations, note that the change in cash and cash equivalents on line 15 in 
Table 19.11 equals the change in the minimum cash balance shown in Table 19.9.
For the balance sheet, we must begin by adjusting Ideko’s closing 2005 balance sheet 
from Table  19.1 to account for the transaction. The transaction will affect the firm’s 
goodwill, stockholders’ equity, and its cash and debt balances. We show these changes by 
constructing a new “pro forma” 2005 balance sheet that represents the firm just after the 
transaction closes (see Table 19.12). Let’s consider how each change is determined.
First, we calculate goodwill as the difference between the acquisition price and the value 
of the net assets acquired:
	
New Goodwill = Acquisition Price - Value of Net Assets Acquired	
(19.10)
In this case, the acquisition price is the $150 million purchase price for Ideko’s existing 
equity. For the net assets acquired, we use Ideko’s existing book value of equity, $77.668 

	
19.3  Building the Financial Model	
737
million, excluding any pre-existing goodwill ($0). Thus, new goodwill is 150 - (77.668 - 0) 
= $72.332 million.7
Next, consider stockholders’ equity, which we calculate as
	
New Stockholders’ Equity = Equity Contributions - Expensed Transaction Fees (19.11)
In this case, we deduct the $5 million in advisory fee expenses from KKP’s initial equity 
contribution of $53 million to calculate new shareholders’ equity of $48 million.8
Finally, we adjust Ideko’s cash and debt balances by deducting the excess cash of $6.5 mil­­
lion used to help fund the transaction, eliminating Ideko’s existing debt (which will be 
repaid), and adding the new debt incurred of $100 million. These steps complete the 
pro forma 2005 balance sheet as of the completion of the transaction and are shown in 
Table 19.12.
To construct the balance sheet going forward, adjust the cash balance to reflect the 
change in cash from line 15 of the statement of cash flows in Table 19.11. All other cur-
rent assets and liabilities come from the net working capital spreadsheet (Table 19.9). The 
inventory entry on the balance sheet includes both raw materials and finished goods. Prop-
erty, plant, and equipment information comes from the capital expenditure spreadsheet 
7We have simplified somewhat the balance sheet adjustments in the goodwill calculation. In particular, 
the book values of Ideko’s assets and liabilities may be “stepped up” to reflect current fair values, and a por-
tion of the excess purchase price may be allocated to intangible assets as opposed to goodwill.
8Under SFAS 141R, as of December 2008, acquisition-related advisory and legal fees should be expensed 
as incurred. To illustrate this method, we have applied it here. Financing fees related to debt issuance, on 
the other hand, are not deducted from shareholders’ equity, but are instead capitalized as a new asset and 
amortized over the loan’s term. For simplicity, we have ignored these fees and any related tax consequences.

Chapter 19  Valuation and Financial Modeling: A Case Study 
Using Excel
Auditing Your  
Financial Model
Building a three-statement financial model is complex, and even experienced financial modelers 
make mistakes. Audit your model to check for errors using the following best practices.
Do Not Use Stockholders’ Equity as a Plug
Because the balance sheet must balance, it is tempting to calculate stockholders’ equity in the 
spreadsheet as the difference between total assets and total liabilities. Doing so, however, nulli-
fies a key benefit of the balance sheet as an audit tool on the rest of the financial model. As a 
best practice, always calculate stockholders’ equity directly as shown here. Then, in a line below 
the balance sheet, include a “check” line that tests whether total assets equal total liabilities and 
equity each year—and if the difference is non-zero, display it in a bold red font so the errror is 
apparent.
If the model does have an error, the amount of the difference will provide a clue to its source: 
If the difference is a constant each year, it is likely to result from one of the adjustments in the 
initial pro forma balance sheet; if it varies over time, check each line of the balance sheet to be sure 
the trends make sense (e.g., that inventories grow with sales), and check the sign of each line item 
in the statement of cash flows to make sure all sources of cash are positive and all uses of cash are 
negative (especially working capital).
Check the Cash and Payout Policy
Check that the firm’s cash and payouts match its intended policy. In this case, we forecast that 
Ideko would pay out all excess cash going forward. Thus, its cash balances in the balance sheet 
should match the minimum balances specified in Table 19.9. If not, be sure to audit the free cash 
flow to equity calculation in Table 19.10. Note also that in this example, free cash flow to equity 
(i.e., dividends) was an output of the model. We could have alternatively assumed Ideko would 
retain its excess cash. In that case, free cash flow to equity would be zero (no dividends would be 
paid), and changes in cash (and thus the firm’s net borrowing) would be outputs.
(Table 19.4), and the debt comes from Table 19.5. From Eq. 2.7, stockholders’ equity 
increases each year through retained earnings (net income less dividends) and new capital 
contributions (stock issuances net of repurchases). Dividends after 2005 are equal to posi-
tive free cash flows to equity from Table 19.10, whereas negative free cash flows to equity 
represent a stock issuance. As a check on the calculations, note that the balance sheet does, 
indeed, balance: Total assets equal total liabilities and equity.9
Ideko’s book value of equity will decline in 2006, as Ideko reduces its work-
ing capital and pays out the savings as part of a large dividend. The firm’s book 
value will then rise as it expands. Ideko’s book debt-equity ratio will decline from 
100,000/48,000 = 2.1 to 120,000/62,149 = 1.9 during the five-year period.

1.	 What is a pro forma income statement?
	
2.	 How do we calculate the firm’s free cash flow, and the free cash flow to equity?
9In Table 19.12, goodwill is assumed to remain constant. If the transaction were structured as an acquisi-
tion of assets (as opposed to stock), the goodwill would be amortizable over 15 years for tax reporting as 
per section 197 of the Internal Revenue Code. For financial accounting purposes, goodwill is not amor-
tized but is subject to an impairment test at least once a year as specified in FASB 142 (though changes in 
goodwill due to impairment have no tax accounting consequence).

19.4	 Estimating the Cost of Capital
To value KKP’s investment in Ideko, we need to assess the risk associated with Ideko and 
estimate an appropriate cost of capital. Because Ideko is a private firm, we cannot use its 
own past returns to evaluate its risk, but must instead rely on comparable publicly traded 
firms. In this section, we use data from the comparable firms identified earlier to estimate 
a cost of capital for Ideko.
Our approach is as follows. First, we use the techniques developed in Part 4 to estimate 
the equity cost of capital for Oakley, Luxottica Group, and Nike. Then, we estimate the 
unlevered cost of capital for each firm based on its capital structure. We use the unlevered 
cost of capital of the comparable firms to estimate Ideko’s unlevered cost of capital. Once 
we have this estimate, we can use Ideko’s capital structure to determine its equity cost of 
capital or WACC, depending on the valuation method employed.
CAPM-Based Estimation
To determine an appropriate cost of capital, we must first determine the appropriate mea-
sure of risk. KKP’s investment in Ideko will represent a large fraction of its portfolio. As a 
consequence, KKP itself is not well diversified. But KKP’s investors are primarily pension 
funds and large institutional investors, which are themselves well diversified and which 
evaluate their performance relative to the market as a benchmark. Thus, you decide that 
estimating market risk using the CAPM approach is justified.
Using the CAPM, we can estimate the equity cost of capital for each comparable firm 
based on the beta of its equity. As outlined in Chapter 12, the standard approach to esti-
mating an equity beta is to determine the historical sensitivity of the stock’s returns to the 
market’s returns by using linear regression to estimate the slope coefficient in the equation:
	
Rs - rf = as + bs (Rmkt - rf ) + es	
(19.12)
As a proxy for the market portfolio, we will use a value-weighted portfolio of all 
NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks. With data from 2000 to 2004, we calculate the 
excess return—the realized return minus the yield on a one-month Treasury security—for 
each firm and for the market portfolio. We then estimate the equity beta for each firm 
by regressing its excess return onto the excess return of the market portfolio. We perform 
the regression for both monthly returns and 10-day returns. The estimated equity betas, 
together with their 95% confidence intervals, are shown in Table 19.13.

Capital Structure and Unlevered Beta Estimates 
for Comparable Firms
While we would like to assess risk and, therefore, estimate beta based on longer horizon 
returns (consistent with our investors’ investment horizon), the confidence intervals we 
obtain using monthly data are extremely wide. These confidence intervals narrow some-
what when we use 10-day returns. In any case, the results make clear that a fair amount of 
uncertainty persists when we estimate the beta for an individual firm.
Unlevering Beta
Given an estimate of each firm’s equity beta, we next “unlever” the beta based on the firm’s 
capital structure. Here we use Eq. 12.9 (which is equivalent, in terms of returns, to calcu-
lating the pretax WACC as in Eq. 18.6):
	
bU = ¢
Equity Value
Enterprise Value≤bE + ¢ Net Debt Value
Enterprise Value ≤bD	
(19.13)
Recall that we must use the net debt of the firm—that is, we must subtract any cash from 
the level of debt—so we use the enterprise value of the firm as the sum of debt and equity 
in the formula.10 Table 19.14 shows the capital structure for each comparable firm. Oakley 
has no debt, while Luxottica has about 17% debt in its capital structure. Nike holds cash 
that exceeds its debt, leading to a negative net debt in its capital structure.
Table 19.14 also estimates the unlevered beta of each firm. Here, we have used an equity 
beta for each firm within the range of the results from Table 19.13. Given the low or nega-
tive debt levels for each firm, assuming a beta for debt of zero is a reasonable approxima-
tion. Then, we compute an unlevered beta for each firm according to Eq. 19.13.
The range of the unlevered betas for these three firms is large. Both Luxottica and Nike 
have relatively low betas, presumably reflecting the relative noncyclicality of their core busi-
nesses (prescription eyewear for Luxottica and athletic shoes for Nike). Oakley has a much 
higher unlevered beta, perhaps because the high-end specialty sports eyewear it produces is 
a discretionary expense for most consumers.
Ideko’s Unlevered Cost of Capital
The data from the comparable firms provides guidance to us for estimating Ideko’s unle-
vered cost of capital. Ideko’s products are not as high end as Oakley’s eyewear, so their sales 
are unlikely to vary as much with the business cycle as Oakley’s sales do. However, Ideko 
does not have a prescription eyewear division, as Luxottica does. Ideko’s products are also 
fashion items rather than exercise items, so we expect Ideko’s cost of capital to be closer to 
10Recall from Chapter 18 that Eq. 19.13 assumes that the firm will maintain a target leverage ratio. If the 
debt is expected to remain fixed for some period, we should also deduct the value of the predetermined tax 
shields from the firm’s net debt.

Oakley’s than to Nike’s or Luxottica’s. Therefore, we use 1.20 as our preliminary estimate 
for Ideko’s unlevered beta, which is somewhat above the average of the comparables in 
Table 19.14.
We use the security market line of the CAPM to translate this beta into a cost of capital for 
Ideko. In mid-2005, one-year Treasury rates were approximately 4%; we use this rate for the 
risk-free interest rate. We also need an estimate of the market risk premium. Since 1960, the 
average annual return of the value-weighted market portfolio of U.S. stocks has exceeded that 
of one-year Treasuries by approximately 5%. However, this estimate is a backward-looking 
number. As we mentioned in Chapter 12, some researchers believe that future stock market 
excess returns are likely to be lower than this historical average. To be conservative in our 
valuation of Ideko, we will use 5% as the expected market risk premium.
Based on these choices, our estimate of Ideko’s unlevered cost of capital is
 rU = rf + bU (E[Rmkt] - rf ) = 4% + 1.20(5%)
 = 10%
Of course, as our discussion has made clear, this estimate contains a large amount of uncer-
tainty. Thus, we will include sensitivity analysis with regard to the unlevered cost of capital 
in our analysis.
Example 19.5
Estimating the Unlevered Cost of Capital
Problem
Using the monthly equity beta estimates for each firm in Table 19.13, what range of unlevered 
cost of capital estimates is possible?
Solution
Oakley has the highest equity beta of 1.99, which is also its unlevered beta (it has no debt). 
With this beta, the unlevered cost of capital would be rU = 4% + 1.99(5%) = 13.95%. At 
the other extreme, given its capital structure, Luxottica’s equity beta of 0.56 implies an unle-
vered beta of (0.56)(0.83) = 0.46. With this beta, the unlevered cost of capital would be 
rU = 4% + 0.46(5%) = 6.3%.
As with any analysis based on comparables, experience and judgment are necessary to come 
up with a reasonable estimate of the unlevered cost of capital. In this case, our choice would be 
guided by industry norms, an assessment of which comparable is closest in terms of market risk, 
and possibly knowledge of how cyclical Ideko’s revenues have been historically.

Thus far, we have forecasted the first five years of cash flows from KKP’s investment in 
Ideko, and we have estimated the investment’s unlevered cost of capital. In this section, we 
combine these inputs to estimate the value of the opportunity. The first step is to develop 
an estimate of Ideko’s value at the end of our five-year forecast horizon. To do so, we

Continuation Value Estimate for Ideko
consider both a multiples approach and a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation using the 
WACC method. Given Ideko’s free cash flow and continuation value, we then estimate 
its total enterprise value in 2005 using the APV method. Deducting the value of debt and 
KKP’s initial investment from our estimate of Ideko’s enterprise value gives the NPV of 
the investment opportunity. In addition to NPV, we look at some other common metrics, 
including IRR and cash multiples.
The Multiples Approach to Continuation Value
Practitioners generally estimate a firm’s continuation value (also called the terminal value) 
at the end of the forecast horizon using a valuation multiple. While forecasting cash flows 
explicitly is useful in capturing those specific aspects of a company that distinguish the 
firm from its competitors in the short run, in the long run firms in the same industry 
typically have similar expected growth rates, profitability, and risk. As a consequence, 
multiples are likely to be relatively homogeneous across firms. Thus, applying a multiple 
is potentially as reliable as estimating the value based on an explicit forecast of distant 
cash flows.
Of the different valuation multiples available, the EBITDA multiple is most often used 
in practice. In most settings, the EBITDA multiple is more reliable than sales or earn-
ings multiples because it accounts for the firm’s operating efficiency and is not affected by 
leverage differences between firms. We estimate the continuation value using an EBITDA 
multiple as follows:
	
Continuation Enterprise Value at Forecast Horizon =
	
EBITDA at Horizon * EBITDA Multiple at Horizon	
(19.14)
From the income statement in Table 19.7, Ideko’s EBITDA in 2010 is forecast to be 
$32.09 million. If we assume its EBITDA multiple in 2010 is unchanged from the value of 
9.1 that we calculated at the time of the original purchase, then Ideko’s continuation value 
in 2010 is 32.09 * 9.1 = $292.05 million. This calculation is shown in the spreadsheet in 
Table 19.15. Given Ideko’s outstanding debt of $120 million in 2010, this estimate cor-
responds to an equity value of $172.05 million.
Table 19.15 also shows Ideko’s sales and P/E multiples based on this continuation value. 
The continuation value is 1.8 times Ideko’s 2010 sales, and the equity value is 16.3 times 
Ideko’s 2010 earnings. Because the P/E multiple is affected by leverage, we also report 
Ideko’s unlevered P/E ratio, which is calculated as its continuing enterprise value divided 
by its unlevered net income in 2010 (listed in Table 19.10). Ideko would have this P/E 
ratio if it had no debt in 2010, so this information is useful when comparing Ideko to 
unlevered firms in the industry.

	
19.5  Valuing the Investment	
743
We can use the various multiples to assess the reasonableness of our estimated continu-
ation value. While the value-to-sales ratio is high compared to the overall sporting goods 
industry, these multiples are otherwise low relative to the comparables in Table 19.2. If we 
expect these industry multiples to remain stable, this estimate of Ideko’s continuation value 
seems reasonable (if not relatively conservative).
The Discounted Cash Flow Approach to Continuation Value
One difficulty with relying solely on comparables when forecasting a continuation value 
is that we are comparing future multiples of the firm with current multiples of its competi-
tors. In 2010, the multiples of Ideko and the comparables we have chosen may all be very 
different, especially if the industry is currently experiencing abnormal growth. To guard 
against such a bias, it is wise to check our estimate of the continuation value based on fun-
damentals using a discounted cash flow approach.
To estimate a continuation value in year T using discounted cash flows, we assume a 
constant expected growth rate, g, and a constant debt-equity ratio. As explained in Chap-
ter 18, when the debt-equity ratio is constant, the WACC valuation method is the simplest 
to apply:
	
Enterprise Value in Year T = V L
T = FCFT +1
rwacc - g 
(19.15)
To estimate free cash flow in year T + 1, recall that free cash flow is equal to unlevered net 
income plus depreciation, less capital expenditures and increases in net working capital (see 
Table 19.10):
	
 FCFT +1 = Unlevered Net IncomeT +1 + DepreciationT +1
	
 - Increases in NWCT +1 - Capital ExpendituresT + 1
(19.16)
Suppose the firm’s sales are expected to grow at a nominal rate g. If the firm’s operating 
expenses remain a fixed percentage of sales, then its unlevered net income will also grow at 
rate g. Similarly, the firm’s receivables, payables, and other elements of net working capital 
will grow at rate g.
What about capital expenditures? The firm will need new capital to offset depreciation; 
it will also need to add capacity as its production volume grows. Given a sales growth rate 
g, we may expect that the firm will need to expand its investment in fixed assets at about 
the same rate. In that case,11
Capital ExpendituresT+1 = DepreciationT+1 + g * Fixed AssetsT
Thus, given a growth rate of g for the firm, we can estimate its free cash flow as
	
 FCFT+1 = (1 + g ) * Unlevered Net IncomeT
	
 -g * Net Working CapitalT - g * Fixed AssetsT
(19.17)
Together, Eq. 19.15 and Eq. 19.17 allow us to estimate a firm’s continuation value based 
on its long-run growth rate.
11Here, fixed assets are measured according to their book value net of accumulated depreciation. This level 
of capital expenditures is required to maintain the firm’s ratio of sales to fixed assets (also called its fixed 
asset turnover ratio). An alternative approach—which is preferable if we anticipate a change in the turn-
over ratio—is to estimate increases in NWC and net investment (capital expenditures in excess of depreci-
ation) in Eq. 19.16 as a target percentage of the change in sales, as we did in Chapter 9 (see Example 9.7), 
where the target percentage is the expected long-run ratio of NWC and PP&E to sales.

A DCF Estimate of the Continuation Value
Problem
Estimate Ideko’s continuation value in 2010 assuming a future expected growth rate of 5%, a 
future debt-to-value ratio of 40%, and a debt cost of capital of 6.8%.
Solution
In 2010, Ideko’s unlevered net income is forecasted to be $15.849 million (Table  19.10), 
with working capital of $40.425 million (Table 19.9). It has fixed assets of $69.392 million 
(Table 19.4). From Eq. 19.17, we can estimate Ideko’s free cash flow in 2011:
FCF2011 = (1.05)(15.849) - (5%)(40.425) - (5%)(69.392) = $11.151 million
This estimate represents nearly an 8% increase over Ideko’s 2010 free cash flow of $10.328 mil-
lion. It exceeds the 5% growth rate of sales due to the decline in the required additions to Ideko’s 
net working capital as its growth rate slows.
With a debt-to-value ratio of 40%, Ideko’s WACC can be calculated from Eq. 18.11 or Eq. 
12.13:
rwacc = rU - d tc rD = 10% - 0.40(0.35) 6.8% = 9.05%
Given the estimate of Ideko’s free cash flow and WACC, we can estimate Ideko’s continuation 
value in 2010:
V L
2010 =
11.151
9.05% - 5% = $275.33 million
This continuation value represents a terminal EBITDA multiple of 275.33/32.09 = 8.6.
Both the multiples approach and the discounted cash flow approach are useful in deriv-
ing a realistic continuation value estimate. Our recommendation is to combine both 
approaches, as we do in Table 19.16. As shown in the spreadsheet, our projected EBITDA 
multiple of 9.1 can be justified by the discounted cash flow method with a nominal long-
term growth rate of about 5.3%.12 Given an expected future inflation rate of 2.5%, this

be found using Solver in Excel.

745
nominal rate represents a real growth rate of about 2.8%. This implied growth rate is 
another important reality check for our continuation value estimate. If it is much higher 
than our expectations of long-run growth for the industry as a whole, we should be more 
skeptical of the estimate being used.
APV Valuation of Ideko’s Equity
Our estimate of Ideko’s continuation value summarizes the value of the firm’s free cash 
flow beyond the forecast horizon. We can combine it with our forecast for free cash flow 
through 2010 (Table 19.10, line 7) to estimate Ideko’s value today. Recall from Chap-
ter 18 that because the debt is paid on a fixed schedule during the forecast period, the APV 
method is the easiest valuation method to apply.
The steps to estimate Ideko’s value using the APV method are shown in the spreadsheet 
in Table 19.17. First, we compute Ideko’s unlevered value V U, which is the firm’s value if 
we were to operate the company without leverage during the forecast period and sell it for 
its continuation value at the end of the forecast horizon. Thus, the final value in 2010 
would be the continuation value we estimated in Table 19.15. The value in earlier periods

Continuation Values and Long-Run Growth
The continuation value is one of the most important esti-
mates when valuing a firm. A common mistake is to use an 
overly optimistic continuation value, which will lead to an 
upward bias in the estimated current value of the firm. Be 
aware of the following pitfalls:
Using multiples based on current high growth rates.  
Continuation value estimates are often based on current 
valuation multiples of existing firms. But if these firms are 
currently experiencing high growth that will eventually slow 
down, their multiples can be expected to decline over time. 
In this scenario, if we estimate a continuation value based 
on today’s multiples without accounting for this decline as 
growth slows, the estimate will be biased upward.
Ignoring investment necessary for growth.  When us-
ing the discounted cash flow method, we cannot assume 
that FCFT+1 = FCFT (1 + g) if the firm’s growth rate has 
changed between T and T + 1. Whenever the growth rate 
changes, expenditures on working and fixed capital will be 
affected, and we must take this effect into account as we do in  
Eq. 19.17.
Using unsustainable long-term growth rates.  When 
­using the discounted cash flow method, we must choose 
a long-term growth rate for the firm. By choosing a 
high rate, we can make the continuation value estimate 
extremely high. In the long run, however, firms cannot 
continue to grow faster than the overall economy. Thus, 
we should be suspicious of long-term growth rates that 
exceed the ­expected rate of GDP growth, which has aver-
aged between 2.5% and 3.5% in real terms (that is, not 
including ­inflation) in the United States over the past sev-
eral decades.
Common Mistake

746	
Chapter 19  Valuation and Financial Modeling: A Case Study 
Missing Assets or Liabilities
When computing the enterprise value of a firm from its free 
cash flows, remember that we are valuing only those assets and 
liabilities whose cash flow consequences are included in our 
projections. Any “missing” assets or liabilities must be added 
to the APV estimate to determine the value of equity. In this 
case, we deduct the firm’s debt and add any excess cash or other 
marketable securities that have not been included (for Ideko, 
excess cash has already been paid out and will remain at zero, so 
no adjustment is needed). We also adjust for any other assets or 
liabilities that have not been explicitly considered. For example, 
if a firm owns vacant land, or if it has patents or other rights 
whose potential cash flows were not included in the projections, 
the value of these assets must be accounted for separately. The 
same is true for liabilities such as stock option grants, potential 
legal liabilities, leases (if the lease payments were not included 
in earnings), or underfunded pension liabilities.
Common Mistake
includes the free cash flows paid by the firm (from Table 19.10) discounted at the unle-
vered cost of capital rU that we estimated in Section 19.413:
	
V U
t -1 = FCFt + V U
t
1 + rU
	
(19.18)
Next, we incorporate Ideko’s interest tax shield during the forecast horizon. The interest 
tax shield equals the tax rate of 35% (Table 19.3) multiplied by Ideko’s scheduled inter-
est payments (see Table 19.5). Because the debt levels are predetermined, we compute 
the value T s of the tax shield by discounting the tax savings at the debt interest rate, 
rD = 6.80%:
	
T s
t -1 = Interest Tax Shieldt + T s
t
1 + rD
	
(19.19)
Combining the unlevered value and the tax shield value gives the APV, which is Ideko’s 
enterprise value given the planned leverage policy. By deducting debt, we obtain our esti-
mate for the value of Ideko’s equity during the forecast period.
Thus, our estimate for Ideko’s initial enterprise value is $213 million, with an 
equity value of $113 million. As KKP’s initial cost to acquire Ideko’s equity is $53 mil-
lion (see Table 19.6), based on these estimates the deal looks attractive, with an NPV of 
$113 million - $53 million = $60 million.
A Reality Check
At this point, it is wise to step back and assess whether our valuation results make sense. 
Does an initial enterprise value of $213 million for Ideko seem reasonable compared to the 
values of other firms in the industry?
Here again, multiples are helpful. Let’s compute the initial valuation multiples that 
would be implied by our estimated enterprise value of $213 million and compare them to 
Ideko’s closest competitors as we did in Table 19.2. Table 19.18 provides our results.
Naturally, the valuation multiples based on the estimated enterprise value of $213 mil-
lion, which would correspond to a purchase price of $215 million given Ideko’s existing 
debt and excess cash, are higher than those based on a purchase price of $150 million. 
They are now at the top end or somewhat above the range of the values of the other firms 
13Note that in 2010, we use the continuation value of $292 million as the final “unlevered” value, even 
though this value might include future tax shields (as in Example 19.6). This approach is correct as we 
are using the APV calculation only to value the additional tax shields earned during the forecast horizon. 
Combining discounting methodologies as we have done here is very useful in situations like this one in 
which the firm is likely to be recapitalized at the exit horizon.

that we used for comparison. While these multiples are not unreasonable given the opera-
tional improvements that KKP plans to implement, they indicate that our projections may 
be somewhat optimistic and depend critically on KKP’s ability to achieve the operational 
improvements it plans.
Our estimated initial EBITDA multiple of 13.1 also exceeds the multiple of 9.1 that we 
assumed for the continuation value. Thus, our estimate forecasts a decline in the EBITDA 
multiple, which is appropriate given our expectation that growth will be higher in the short 
run. If the multiple did not decline, we should question whether our continuation value is 
too optimistic.
IRR and Cash Multiples
While the NPV method is the most reliable method when evaluating a transaction like 
KKP’s acquisition of Ideko, real-world practitioners often use IRR and the cash multiple 
(or multiple of money) as alternative valuation metrics. We discuss both of these methods 
in this section.
To compute the IRR, we must compute KKP’s cash flows over the life of the transaction. 
KKP’s initial investment in Ideko, from Table 19.6, is $53 million. KKP will then receive 
cash dividends from Ideko based on the free cash flow to equity reported in Table 19.10. 
Finally, we assume that KKP will sell its equity share in Ideko at the end of five years, 
receiving the continuation equity value. We combine these data to determine KKP’s cash 
flows in the spreadsheet in Table 19.19. Given the cash flows, we compute the IRR of the 
transaction, which is 33.3%.
While an IRR of 33.3% might sound attractive, it is not straightforward to evaluate 
in this context. To do so, we must compare it to the appropriate cost of capital for KKP’s 
investment. Because KKP holds an equity position in Ideko, we should use Ideko’s equity

cost of capital. Of course, Ideko’s leverage ratio changes over the five-year period, which 
will change the risk of its equity. Thus, there is no single cost of capital to compare to the 
IRR.14
The spreadsheet in Table 19.19 also computes the cash multiple for the transaction. The 
cash multiple (also called the multiple of money or absolute return) is the ratio of the 
total cash received to the total cash invested. The cash multiple for KKP’s investment in 
Ideko is
	
 Cash Multiple = Total Cash Received
Total Cash Invested
	
 = 9055 + 2989 + 4735 + 1375 + 177,077
53,000
= 3.7
(19.20)
That is, KKP expects to receive a return that is 3.7 times its investment in Ideko. The cash 
multiple is a common metric used by investors in transactions such as this one. It has an 
obvious weakness: The cash multiple does not depend on the amount of time it takes to 
receive the cash, nor does it account for the risk of the investment. It is therefore useful 
only for comparing deals with similar time horizons and risk.

19.6	 Sensitivity Analysis
Any financial valuation is only as accurate as the estimates on which it is based. Before 
concluding our analysis, it is important to assess the uncertainty of our estimates and to 
determine their potential impact on the value of the deal.
Once we have developed the spreadsheet model for KKP’s investment in Ideko, it is straightfor-
ward to perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in different parameters 
on the deal’s value. For example, the spreadsheet in Table 19.20 shows the sensitivity of our esti-
mates of the value of KKP’s investment to changes in our assumptions regarding the exit EBITDA 
multiple that KKP obtains when Ideko is sold, as well as Ideko’s unlevered cost of capital.
In our initial analysis, we assumed an exit EBITDA multiple of 9.1. Table 19.20 shows 
that each 1.0 increase in the multiple represents about $20 million in initial value.15 KKP 
will break even on its $53 million investment in Ideko with an exit multiple of slightly 
more than 6.0. The table also shows, however, that an exit multiple of 6.0 is consistent 
with a future growth rate for Ideko of less than 2%, which is even less than the expected 
rate of inflation and perhaps unrealistically low.
Table  19.20 also illustrates the effect of a change to our assumption about Ideko’s 
unlevered cost of capital. A higher unlevered cost of capital reduces the value of KKP’s 
15In fact, we can calculate this directly as the present value of Ideko’s projected EBITDA in 2010: 
($32.094 million)/(1.105) = $19.928 million.

19.1  Valuation Using Comparables
	
n	 Valuation using comparables may be used as a preliminary way to estimate the value of a firm. 
Common multiples include the price-earnings ratio, and the ratio of enterprise value to sales or 
EBITDA.
19.2  The Business Plan
	
n	 When evaluating an acquisition it is necessary to look in detail at the company’s operations, invest-
ments, and capital structure, and to assess its potential for improvements and future growth.
19.3  Building the Financial Model
	
n	 The value of an investment ultimately depends on the firm’s future cash flows. To estimate cash 
flows, one must first develop forecasts for the target firm’s operations, investments, and capital 
structure.
	
n	 A financial model may be used to project the future cash flows from an investment.
n	 A pro forma income statement projects the firm’s earnings under a given set of hypothetical 
assumptions.
n	 The financial model should also consider future working capital needs and capital expendi-
tures to estimate future free cash flows.
n	 Based on these estimates, we can forecast the balance sheet and statement of cash flows.

investment; yet, even with a rate as high as 14%, the equity value exceeds KKP’s initial 
investment. However, if the unlevered cost of capital exceeds 12%, the implied long-term 
growth rate that justifies the assumed exit EBITDA multiple of 9.1 is probably unreal-
istically high. Thus, if we believe the unlevered cost of capital falls within this range, we 
should lower our forecast for the exit EBITDA multiple, which will further reduce the 
value of KKP’s equity. Conversely, if we are confident in our estimate of the exit multiple, 
this analysis lends further support to our choice for the unlevered cost of capital.
The exercises at the end of this chapter continue the sensitivity analysis by considering 
different levels of market share growth and changes to working capital management.

n	 When forecasting the balance sheet, we must first adjust the firm’s initial balance sheet to reflect 
the transaction, including: 
	
New Goodwill = Acquisition Price - Value of Net Assets Acquired	
(19.10)
	
New Stockholders’ Equity = Equity Contributions - Expensed Transaction Fees
(19.11)
	
n	 Checking whether the balance sheet balances is an important audit tool for the consistency of 
the financial model.
19.4  Estimating the Cost of Capital
	
n	 To value an investment, we need to assess its risk and estimate an appropriate cost of capital. 
One method for doing so is to use the CAPM.
n	 Use the CAPM to estimate the equity cost of capital for comparable firms, based on their 
equity betas.
n	 Given an estimate of each comparable firm’s equity beta, unlever the beta based on the firm’s 
capital structure.
n	 Use the CAPM and the estimates of unlevered betas for comparable firms to estimate the 
unlevered cost of capital for the investment.
19.5  Valuing the Investment
	
n	 In addition to forecasting cash flows for a few years, we need to estimate the firm’s continuation 
value at the end of the forecast horizon.
n	 One method is to use a valuation multiple based on comparable firms.
n	 To estimate a continuation value in year T using discounted cash flows, it is common prac-
tice to assume a constant expected growth rate g and a constant debt-equity ratio:
	
Enterprise Value in Year T = V L
T =
FCFT +1
rwacc - g
(19.15)
	
n	 Given the forecasted cash flows and an estimate of the cost of capital, the final step is to com-
bine these inputs to estimate the value of the opportunity. We may use the valuation methods 
described in Chapter 18 to calculate firm value.
	
n	 While the NPV method is the most reliable approach for evaluating an investment, practi­
tioners often use the IRR and cash multiple as alternative valuation metrics.
n	 We use the cash flows over the lifetime of the investment to calculate the IRR.
n	 The cash multiple for an investment is the ratio of the total cash received to the total cash 
invested:
	
Cash Multiple = Total Cash Received
Total Cash Invested 
(19.20)
19.6  Sensitivity Analysis
	
n	 Sensitivity analysis is useful for evaluating the uncertainty of estimates used for valuation, and 
the impact of this uncertainty on the value of the deal.

Valuation Using Comparables
	
1.	 You would like to compare Ideko’s profitability to its competitors’ profitability using the EBITDA/
sales multiple. Given Ideko’s current sales of $75.6 million, use the information in Table 19.2 to 
compute a range of EBITDA for Ideko assuming it is run as profitably as its competitors.
The Business Plan
	
2.	 Assume that Ideko’s market share will increase by 0.4% per year rather than the 1% used in 
the chapter. What production capacity will Ideko require each year? When will an expansion 
become necessary (when production volume will exceed the current level by 50%)?
	
3.	 Under the assumption that Ideko market share will increase by 0.5% per year, you determine 
that the plant will require an expansion in 2010. The cost of this expansion will be $15 
million. Assuming the financing of the expansion will be delayed accordingly, calculate the 
projected interest payments and the amount of the projected interest tax shields (assuming 
that the interest rates on the term loans remain the same as in the chapter) through 2010.

Chapter 19  Appendix:  Compensating Management	
753
Compensating Management
The success of KKP’s investment critically depends on its ability to execute the operational 
improvements laid out in its business plan. KKP has learned from experience that it is much 
more likely to achieve its goals if the management team responsible for implementing the 
changes is given a strong incentive to succeed. KKP therefore considers allocating 10% of 
Ideko’s equity to a management incentive plan. This equity stake would be vested over the 
next five years, and it would provide Ideko’s senior executives with a strong financial interest 
in the success of the venture. What is the cost to KKP of providing this equity stake to the 
management team? How will this incentive plan affect the NPV of the acquisition?
To determine the value of the acquisition to KKP, we must include the cost of the 10% 
equity stake granted to management. Because the grant vests after five years, management 
will not receive any of the dividends paid by Ideko during that time. Instead, management 
will receive the equity in five years time, at which point we have estimated the value of 
Ideko’s equity to be $172 million (see Table 19.15). Thus, the cost of management’s stake 
in 2010 is equal to 10% * $172 million = $17.2 million according to our estimate. We 
must determine the present value of this amount today.
Because the payment to the managers is an equity claim, to compute its present value 
we must use an equity cost of capital. We take an FTE valuation approach to estimate the 
cost of management’s share in Ideko, shown in the spreadsheet in Table 19A.1.
To compute Ideko’s equity cost of capital rE, we use Eq. 18.20, which applies when the 
debt levels of the firm follow a known schedule:
rE = rU + D - T s
E
 (rU - rD)
Using the debt, equity, and tax shield values from the spreadsheet in Table 19.17 to compute 
the effective leverage ratio (D - T s)/E, we compute rE each year as shown in the spreadsheet. 
We then compute the cost of management’s equity share by discounting at this rate:
	
Cost of Management’s Sharet =
Cost of Management’s Sharet +1
1 + rE (t)

(19A.1)
Once we have determined the cost of management’s equity share, we deduct it from 
the total value of Ideko’s equity (from Table 19.17) to determine the value of KKP’s share 
of Ideko’s equity, shown as the last line of the spreadsheet. Given the initial cost of the 
acquisition to KKP of $53 million, KKP’s NPV from the investment, including the cost of 
management’s compensation, is $103.58 million - $53 million = $50.58 million.

THE LAW OF ONE PRICE CONNECTION. Having developed the tools to 
make current investment decisions, we turn to settings in which the firm or an investor 
has the option to make a future investment decision. ­Chapter 20 introduces financial 
options, which give investors the right to buy or sell a security in the future. Financial 
options are an important tool for corporate financial managers seeking to manage or 
evaluate risk. Options are an example of a derivative security. In the last 30 years, there 
has been enormous growth in the derivative securities markets in general and options 
markets in particular. This growth can be traced directly to the discovery of methods 
for valuing options, which we derive in Chapter 21 using the Law of One Price. An 
important corporate application of option theory is in the area of real investment deci-
sion making. Future investment decisions within the firm are known as real options and 
Chapter 22 applies real option theory to corporate decision making.

IN THIS CHAPTER, WE INTRODUCE THE FINANCIAL OPTION, A 
financial contract between two parties. Since the introduction of publicly traded 
options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1973, financial options 
have become one of the most important and actively traded financial assets and impor-
tant tools for corporate financial managers. Many large corporations have operations 
in different parts of the world, so they face exposure to exchange rate risk and other 
types of business risk. To control this risk, they use options as part of their corporate 
risk management practices. In addition, we can think of the capitalization of the firm 
itself—that is, its mix of debt and equity—as options on the underlying assets of the 
firm. As we will see, viewing the firm’s capitalization in this way yields important insights 
into the firm’s capital structure as well as the conflicts of interests that arise between 
equity investors and debt investors.
Before we can discuss the corporate applications of options, we first need to 
understand what options are and what factors affect their value. In this chapter, we 
provide an overview of the basic types of financial options, introduce important termi-
nology, and describe the payoffs to various option-based strategies. We next discuss 
the factors that affect option prices. Finally, we model the equity and debt of the firm 
as options to gain insight into the conflicts of interest between equity and debt holders, 
as well as the pricing of risky debt.

20.1  Option Basics

20.1	 Option Basics
A financial option contract gives its owner the right (but not the obligation) to purchase 
or sell an asset at a fixed price at some future date. Two distinct kinds of option contracts 
exist: call options and put options. A call option gives the owner the right to buy the asset; 
a put option gives the owner the right to sell the asset. Because an option is a contract 
between two parties, for every owner of a financial option, there is also an option writer, 
the person who takes the other side of the contract.
The most commonly encountered option contracts are options on shares of stock. A 
stock option gives the holder the option to buy or sell a share of stock on or before a given 
date for a given price. For example, a call option on 3M Corporation stock might give the 
holder the right to purchase a share of 3M for $75 per share at any time up to, for example, 
January 18, 2019. Similarly, a put option on 3M stock might give the holder the right to 
sell a share of 3M stock for $50 per share at any time up to, say, January 19, 2018.
Understanding Option Contracts
Practitioners use specific words to describe the details of option contracts. When a holder 
of an option enforces the agreement and buys or sells a share of stock at the agreed-upon 
price, he is exercising the option. The price at which the holder buys or sells the share of 
stock when the option is exercised is called the strike price or exercise price.
There are two kinds of options. American options, the most common kind, allow 
their holders to exercise the option on any date up to and including a final date called the 
expiration date. European options allow their holders to exercise the option only on the 
expiration date—holders cannot exercise before the expiration date. The names American 
and European have nothing to do with the location where the options are traded: Both 
types are traded worldwide.
An option contract is a contract between two parties. The option buyer, also called the 
option holder, holds the right to exercise the option and has a long position in the contract. 
The option seller, also called the option writer, sells (or writes) the option and has a short 
position in the contract. Because the long side has the option to exercise, the short side 
has an obligation to fulfill the contract. For example, suppose you own a call option on 
Hewlett-Packard stock with an exercise price of $10. Hewlett-Packard stock is currently 
trading for $25, so you decide to exercise the option. The person holding the short position 
in the contract is obligated to sell you a share of Hewlett-Packard stock for $10. Your gain, 
the $15 difference between the price you pay for the share of stock and the price at which 
you can sell the share in the market, is the short position’s loss.
Investors exercise options only when they stand to gain something. Consequently, 
whenever an option is exercised, the person holding the short position funds the gain. 
That is, the obligation will be costly. Why, then, do people write options? The answer is 
that when you sell an option you get paid for it—options always have positive prices. The 
market price of the option is also called the option premium. This upfront payment com-
pensates the seller for the risk of loss in the event that the option holder chooses to exercise 
the option.
Interpreting Stock Option Quotations
Stock options are traded on organized exchanges. The oldest and largest is the Chicago 
Board Options Exchange (CBOE). By convention, all traded options expire on the 
­Saturday following the third Friday of the month.

Chapter 20  Financial Options
Table 20.1 shows near-term options on Amazon taken from the CBOE Web site (www
.cboe.com) on July 8, 2009. Call options are listed on the left and put options on the right. 
Each line corresponds to a particular option. The first two digits in the option name refer 
to the year of expiration. The option name also includes the month of expiration, the strike 
or exercise price, and the ticker symbol of the individual option (in parentheses). Looking 
at Table 20.1, the first line of the left column is a call option with an exercise price of $70 
that expires on the Saturday following the third Friday of July 2009 (July 18). The ­columns 
to the right of the name display market data for the option. The first of these columns 
shows the last sale price, followed by the net change from the previous day’s last reported 
sales price, the current bid and ask prices, and the daily volume.1 The final column is the 
open interest, the total number of outstanding contracts of that option.
Above the table, we find information about the stock itself. In this case, Amazon’s stock last 
traded at a price of $77.03 per share. We also see the current bid and ask prices for the stock, 
the size trade (in hundreds of shares) available at these prices, as well as the volume of trade.
When the exercise price of an option is equal to the current price of the stock, the 
option is said to be at-the-money. Notice that, especially for the near-term options, much 
of the trading occurs in options that are closest to being at-the-money—that is, calls and 
puts with exercise prices of either $75 or $80. Note how the July 80 calls have high volume. 
They last traded for $0.94, midway between the current bid price ($0.93) and the ask price 
($0.96), which indicates that the trade likely occurred recently. If it were not recent, the 
last sale price might be far from the current bid and ask.
Stock option contracts are always written on 100 shares of stock. If, for instance, you 
decided to purchase one July 75 call contract, you would be purchasing an option to buy 
100 shares at $75 per share. Option prices are quoted on a per-share basis, so the ask price 
of $3.30 implies that you would pay 100 * 3.30 = $330 for the contract. Similarly, if you 
decide to buy a July 70 put contract, you would pay 100 * 0.38 = $38 for the option to 
sell 100 shares of Amazon stock for $70 per share.
1If no trade has occurred that day, the last sale price is from the previous day, and “pc” appears in the net 
change column.

20.1  Option Basics	
759
Note from Table 20.1 that for each expiration date, call options with lower strike prices 
have higher market prices—the right to buy the stock at a lower price is more valuable 
than the right to buy it for a higher price. Conversely, because the put option gives the 
holder the right to sell the stock at the strike price, for the same expiration date, puts with 
higher strikes are more valuable. On the other hand, holding fixed the strike price, both 
calls and puts are more expensive for a longer time to expiration. Because these options are 
American-style options that can be exercised at any time, having the right to buy or sell for 
a longer period is more valuable.
If the payoff from exercising an option immediately is positive, the option is said to be 
in-the-money. Call options with strike prices below the current stock price are in-the-
money, as are put options with strike prices above the current stock price. Conversely, if the 
payoff from exercising the option immediately is negative, the option is out-of-the-money. 
Call options with strike prices above the current stock price are out-of-the-money, as are 
put options with strike prices below the current stock price. Of course, a holder would not 
exercise an out-of-the-money option. Options where the strike price and the stock price are 
very far apart are referred to as deep in-the-money or deep out-of-the-money.
Options on Other Financial Securities
Although the most commonly traded options are written on stocks, options on other finan-
cial assets do exist. Perhaps the most well-known are options on stock indexes such as the 
S&P 100 index, the S&P 500 index, the Dow Jones Industrial index, and the NYSE index. 
These options have become very popular because they allow investors to protect the value 
of their investments from adverse market changes. As we will see shortly, a stock index put 
option can be used to offset the losses on an investor’s portfolio in a market downturn. 
Using an option to reduce risk in this way is called hedging. Options also allow investors 
to speculate, or place a bet on the direction in which they believe the market is likely to 
move. Purchasing a call, for example, allows investors to bet on a market rise with a much 
smaller investment than investing in the market index itself.
Options are also traded on Treasury securities. These options allow investors to bet on 
or hedge interest rate risk. Similarly, options on currencies and commodities allow inves-
tors to hedge or speculate on risks in these markets.
Example 20.1
Purchasing Options
Problem
It is the afternoon of July 8, 2009, and you have decided to purchase 10 August call contracts on 
Amazon stock with an exercise price of $80. Because you are buying, you must pay the ask price. 
How much money will this purchase cost you? Is this option in-the-money or out-of-the-money?
Solution
From Table 20.1, the ask price of this option is $4.00. You are purchasing 10 contracts and each 
contract is on 100 shares, so the transaction will cost 4.00 * 10 * 100 = $4,000 (ignoring any 
brokerage fees). Because this is a call option and the exercise price is above the current stock price 
($77.03), the option is currently out-of-the-money.

2.	 Does the holder of an option have to exercise it?
	
3.	 Why does an investor who writes (shorts) an option have an obligation?
	
20.2	 Option Payoffs at Expiration
From the Law of One Price, the value of any security is determined by the future cash 
flows an investor receives from owning it. Therefore, before we can assess what an option is 
worth, we must determine an option’s payoff at the time of expiration.
Long Position in an Option Contract
Assume you own an option with a strike price of $20. If, on the expiration date, the stock 
price is greater than the strike price, say $30, you can make money by exercising the call 
(by paying $20, the strike price, for the stock) and immediately selling the stock in the 
open market for $30. The $10 difference is what the option is worth. Consequently, when 
the stock price on the expiration date exceeds the strike price, the value of the call is the 
difference between the stock price and the strike price. When the stock price is less than 
the strike price at expiration, the holder will not exercise the call, so the option is worth 
nothing. We plot these payoffs in Figure 20.1.2
Thus, if S is the stock price at expiration, K is the exercise price, and C is the value of the 
call option, the value of the call at expiration is
Call Value at Expiration
	
C = max(S - K, 0)	
(20.1)
2Payoff diagrams like the ones in this chapter seem to have been introduced by Louis Bachelier in 1900 in 
his book, Theorie de la Speculation (Villars, 1900). Reprinted in English in P. Cootner (ed.), The Random 
Character of Stock Market Prices (M.I.T. Press, 1964).
Payoff of a Call Option  
with a Strike Price of 
$20 at Expiration
If the stock price is greater 
than the strike price ($20), 
the call will  
be exercised, and the 
holder’s payoff is the dif-
ference between the stock 
price and the strike price. If 
the stock price is less than 
the strike price, the call will 
not be ­exercised, and so has 
no value.

where max is the maximum of the two quantities in the parentheses. The call’s value is the 
maximum of the difference between the stock price and the strike price, S - K, and zero.
The holder of a put option will exercise the option if the stock price S is below the strike 
price K. Because the holder receives K when the stock is worth S, the holder’s gain is equal 
to K - S. Thus, the value of a put at expiration is

P = max(K - S, 0)

You own a put option on Oracle Corporation stock with an exercise price of $20 that expires

Let S be the stock price and P be the value of the put option. The value of the option is
P = max(20 - S, 0)

Short Position in an Option Contract
An investor holding a short position in an option has an obligation: This investor takes the 
opposite side of the contract to the investor who is long. Thus, the short position’s cash 
flows are the negative of the long position’s cash flows. Because an investor who is long 
an option can only receive money at expiration—that is, the investor will not exercise an 
option that is out-of-the-money—a short investor can only pay money.
To demonstrate, assume you have a short position in a call option with an exercise price 
of $20. If the stock price is greater than the strike price of a call—for example, $25—the 
holder will exercise the option. You then have the obligation to sell the stock for the strike 
price of $20. Because you must purchase the stock at the market price of $25, you lose 
the difference between the two prices, or $5. However, if the stock price is less than the 
strike price at the expiration date, the holder will not exercise the option, so in this case you 
lose nothing; you have no obligation. We plot these payoffs in Figure 20.2.

Chapter 20  Financial Options
Short Position in a Call 
Option at Expiration
If the stock price is greater 
than the strike price, the 
call will be exercised, so a 
person on the short side of 
a call will lose the difference 
between the stock price and 
the strike price. If the stock 
price is less than the strike 
price, the call will not be 
exercised, and the seller will 
have no obligation.

Notice that because the stock price cannot fall below zero, the downside for a short posi-

Profits for Holding an Option to Expiration
Although payouts on a long position in an option contract are never negative, the profit 
from purchasing an option and holding it to expiration could well be negative because the 
payout at expiration might be less than the initial cost of the option.
To see how this works, let’s consider the potential profits from purchasing the 09 August 
80 call option on Amazon stock quoted in Table 20.1. The option costs $4.00 and expires 
in 45 days. Assume you choose to finance the purchase by borrowing $4.00 at an interest 
rate of 3% per year. If the stock price at expiration is S, then the profit is the call payoff 
minus the amount owed on the loan: max(S - 80, 0) - 4.00 * 1.0345/365, shown as the red 
curve in Figure 20.3. Once the cost of the position is taken into account, you make a posi-
tive profit only if the stock price exceeds $84.01. As we can see from Table 20.1, the further 
in-the-money the option is, the higher its initial price and so the larger your potential loss. 
An out-of-the-money option has a smaller initial cost and hence a smaller potential loss, 
but the probability of a gain is also smaller because the point where profits become positive 
is higher.
Because a short position in an option is the other side of a long position, the profits 
from a short position in an option are just the negative of the profits of a long position. For 
example, a short position in an out-of-the-money call like the 09 August 85 Amazon call in 
Figure 20.3 produces a small positive profit if Amazon’s stock is below $87.23, but leads to 
losses if the stock price is above $87.23.

The curves show the profit

Profit on Holding a Position in a Put Option until Expiration
Problem
Assume you decided to purchase each of the August put options quoted in Table 20.1 on July 8, 
2009, and you financed each position by shorting a two-month bond with a yield of 3%. Plot 
the profit of each position as a function of the stock price on expiration.

Chapter 20  Financial Options
Returns for Holding an Option to Expiration
We can also compare options based on their potential returns. Figure  20.4 shows the 
return from purchasing one of the August 2009 options in Table 20.1 on July 8, 2009, and 
holding it until the expiration date. Let’s begin by focusing on call options, shown in panel 
(a). In all cases, the maximum loss is 100%—the option may expire worthless. Notice how 
the curves change as a function of the strike price—the distribution of returns for out-of-
the-money call options are more extreme than those for in-the-money calls. That is, an 
out-of-the-money call option is more likely to have a -100% return, but if the stock goes 
up sufficiently it will also have a much higher return than an in-the-money call option. 
Similarly, all call options have more extreme returns than the stock itself (given Amazon’s 
initial price of $77.03, the range of stock prices shown in the plot represents returns 
of {30%). As a consequence, the risk of a call option is amplified relative to the risk of the 
stock, and the amplification is greater for deeper out-of-the-money calls. Thus, if a stock 
had a positive beta, call options written on the stock will have even higher betas and 
expected returns than the stock itself.3
Now consider the returns for put options. Look carefully at panel (b) in Figure 20.4. The 
put position has a higher return with low stock prices; that is, if the stock has a positive beta, 
the put has a negative beta. Hence, put options on positive beta stocks have lower expected 
returns than the underlying stock. The deeper out-of-the-money the put option is, the more 
negative its beta, and the lower its expected return. As a result, put options are generally not 
held as an investment, but rather as insurance to hedge other risk in a portfolio.
3In Chapter 21, we explain how to calculate the expected return and risk of an option. In doing so, we will 
derive these relations rigorously.
Solution
Suppose S is the stock price on expiration, K is the strike price, and P is the price of each put 
option on July 8. Then your cash flows on the expiration date will be
max(K - S, 0) - P * 1.03 45/365
The plot is shown below. Note the same trade-off between the maximum loss and the ­potential 
for profit as for the call options.

Chapter 20  Financial Options
By combining a call option (blue line) with a put option (red line), you will receive 
cash so long as the options do not expire at-the-money. The farther away from the money 
the options are, the more money you will make (solid line). However, to construct the 
combination requires purchasing both options, so the profits after deducting this cost are 
negative for stock prices close to the strike price and positive elsewhere (dashed line). This 
combination of options is known as a straddle. This strategy is sometimes used by inves-
tors who expect the stock to be very volatile and move up or down a large amount, but 
who do not necessarily have a view on which direction the stock will move. Conversely, 
investors who expect the stock to end up near the strike price may choose to sell a straddle.
Example 20.5
Strangle
Problem
You are long both a call option and a put option on Hewlett-Packard stock with the same expira-
tion date. The exercise price of the call option is $40; the exercise price of the put option is $30. 
Plot the payoff of the combination at expiration.
Solution
The red line represents the put’s payouts and the blue line represents the call’s payouts. In this 
case, you do not receive money if the stock price is between the two strike prices. This option 
combination is known as a strangle.

Butterfly Spread.  The combination of options in Figure 20.5 makes money when the 
stock and strike prices are far apart. It is also possible to construct a combination of options 
with the opposite exposure: one that pays off when the stock price is close to the strike price.
Suppose you are long two call options with the same expiration date on Intel stock: 
one with an exercise price of $20 and the other with an exercise price of $40. In addition, 
suppose you are short two call options on Intel stock, both with an exercise price of $30. 
Figure 20.6 plots the value of this combination at expiration.
The yellow line in Figure 20.6 represents the payoff at expiration from the long position 
in the $20 call. The red line represents the payoff from the long position in the $40 call. 
The blue line represents the payoff from the short position in the two $30 calls. The black 
line shows the payoff of the entire combination. For stock prices less than $20, all options 
are out-of-the-money, so the payoff is zero. For stock prices greater than $40, the losses 
from the short position in the $30 calls exactly offset the gain from $20 and $40 options,

Because the payoff of the butterfly spread is positive, it must have a positive initial cost. 
(Otherwise, it would be an arbitrage opportunity.) Therefore, the cost of the $20 and $40 
call options must exceed the proceeds from selling two $30 call options.
Portfolio Insurance.  Let’s see how we can use combinations of options to insure a stock 
against a loss. Assume you currently own Amazon stock and you would like to insure the 
stock against the possibility of a price decline. To do so, you could simply sell the stock, 
but you would also give up the possibility of making money if the stock price increases. 
How can you insure against a loss without relinquishing the upside? You can purchase a 
put option, sometimes known as a protective put.
For example, suppose you want to insure against the possibility that the price of Ama-
zon stock will drop below $45. You decide to purchase an August 45 European put option. 
If Amazon stock is above $45 in August, you keep the stock, but if it is below $45 you 
exercise your put and sell it for $45. Thus, you get the upside, but are insured against a 
drop in the price of Amazon’s stock. The orange line in Figure 20.7 (a) shows the value of 
the combined position on the expiration date of the option.
You can use the same strategy to insure against a loss on an entire portfolio of stocks by using 
put options on the portfolio of stocks as a whole rather than just a single stock. Consequently, 
holding stocks and put options in this combination is known as portfolio insurance.
Purchasing a put option is not the only way to buy portfolio insurance. You can achieve 
exactly the same effect by purchasing a bond and a call option. Let’s return to the insurance 
we purchased on Amazon stock. Amazon stock does not pay dividends, so there are no cash 
4To see this, note that (S - 20) + (S - 40) - 2(S - 30) = 0.

flows before the expiration of the option. Thus, instead of holding a share of Amazon stock 
and a put, you could get the same payoff by purchasing a risk-free zero-coupon bond with 
a face value of $45 and a European call option with a strike price of $45. In this case, if 
Amazon is below $45, you receive the payoff from the bond. If Amazon is above $45, you 
can exercise the call and use the payoff from the bond to buy the stock for the strike price 
of $45. The orange line in Figure 20.7(b) shows the value of the combined position on the 
expiration date of the option; it achieves exactly the same payoffs as owning the stock itself 
along with a put option.

20.3	 Put-Call Parity
Consider the two different ways to construct portfolio insurance illustrated in Figure 20.7: 
(1) purchase the stock and a put or (2) purchase a bond and a call. Because both positions 
provide exactly the same payoff, the Law of One Price requires that they must have the 
same price.
Let’s write this concept more formally. Let K be the strike price of the option (the price 
we want to ensure that the stock will not drop below), C be the call price, P be the put 
price, and S be the stock price. Then, if both positions have the same price,
S + P = PV(K ) + C

20.3  Put-Call Parity	
769
The left side of this equation is the cost of buying the stock and a put (with a strike price 
of K ); the right side is the cost of buying a zero-coupon bond with face value K and a call 
option (with a strike price of K ). Recall that the price of a zero-coupon bond is just the 
present value of its face value, which we have denoted by PV(K ). Rearranging terms gives 
an expression for the price of a European call option for a non-dividend-paying stock:
	
C = P + S - PV(K )	
(20.3)
This relationship between the value of the stock, the bond, and call and put options is 
known as put-call parity. It says that the price of a European call equals the price of the 
stock plus an otherwise identical put minus the price of a bond that matures on the exercise 
date of the option. In other words, you can think of a call as a combination of a levered posi-
tion in the stock, S - PV(K ), plus insurance against a drop in the stock price, the put P.
Example 20.6
Using Put-Call Parity
Problem
You are an options dealer who deals in non-publicly traded options. One of your clients wants to 
purchase a one-year European call option on HAL Computer Systems stock with a strike price 
of $20. Another dealer is willing to write a one-year European put option on HAL stock with 
a strike price of $20, and sell you the put option for a price of $3.50 per share. If HAL pays no 
dividends and is currently trading for $18 per share, and if the risk-free interest rate is 6%, what 
is the lowest price you can charge for the option and guarantee yourself a profit?
Solution
Using put-call parity, we can replicate the payoff of the one-year call option with a strike price of 
$20 by holding the following portfolio: Buy the one-year put option with a strike price of $20 
from the dealer, buy the stock, and sell a one-year risk-free zero-coupon bond with a face value 
of $20. With this combination, we have the following final payoff depending on the final price 
of HAL stock in one year, S1:
Note that the final payoff of the portfolio of the three securities matches the payoff of a call 
option. Therefore, we can sell the call option to our client and have future payoff of zero no mat-
ter what happens. Doing so is worthwhile as long as we can sell the call option for more than the 
cost of the portfolio, which is
P + S - PV(K ) = $3.50 + $18 - $20/1.06 = $2.632

What happens if the stock pays a dividend? In that case, the two different ways to 
construct portfolio insurance do not have the same payout because the stock will pay a 
dividend while the zero-coupon bond will not. Thus, the two strategies will cost the same

Chapter 20  Financial Options
to implement only if we add the present value of future dividends to the combination of 
the bond and the call:
S + P = PV(K ) + PV(Div) + C
The left side of this equation is the value of the stock and a put; the right side is the value 
of a zero-coupon bond, a call option, and the future dividends paid by the stock during 
the life of the options, denoted by Div. Rearranging terms gives the general put-call parity 
formula:
Put-Call Parity
	
C = P + S - PV(Div) - PV(K )	
(20.4)
In this case, the call is equivalent to having a levered position in the stock without divi-
dends plus insurance against a fall in the stock price.
Example 20.7
Using Options to Value Near-Term Dividends
Problem
It is February 2016 and you have been asked, in your position as a financial analyst, to compare 
the expected dividends of several popular stock indices over the next several years. Checking 
the markets, you find the following closing prices for each index, as well as for options expiring 
December 2018.
If the current risk-free interest rate is 0.90% for a December 2018 maturity, estimate the relative 
contribution of the near-term dividends to the value of each index.
Solution
Rearranging the Put-Call Parity relation gives:
PV (Div) = P - C + S - PV (K  )
Applying this to the DJIA, we find that the expected present value of its dividends over the next 
34 months is
PV (Div) = 22.73 - 19.78 + 164.85 -
160
1.00934/12 = 11.81
Therefore, expected dividends through December 2018 represent 11.81/164.85 = 7.2% of the 
current value of DJIA index. Doing a similar calculation for the other indices, we find that near-
term dividends account for 5.8% of the value of the S&P 500, 3.2% of the NASDAQ 100, and 
6.2% of the Russell 2000.

20.4  Factors Affecting Option Prices	
771
	
20.4	 Factors Affecting Option Prices
Put-call parity gives the price of a European call option in terms of the price of a European 
put, the underlying stock, and a zero-coupon bond. Therefore, to compute the price of a 
call using put-call parity, you have to know the price of the put. In Chapter 21, we explain 
how to calculate the price of a call without knowing the price of the put. Before we get 
there, let’s first investigate the factors that affect option prices.
Strike Price and Stock Price
As we noted earlier for the Amazon option quotes in Table 20.1, the value of an other-
wise identical call option is higher if the strike price the holder must pay to buy the stock 
is lower. Because a put is the right to sell the stock, puts with a lower strike price are less 
valuable.
For a given strike price, the value of a call option is higher if the current price of the stock 
is higher, as there is a greater likelihood the option will end up in-the-money. Conversely, 
put options increase in value as the stock price falls.
Arbitrage Bounds on Option Prices
We have already seen that an option’s price cannot be negative. Furthermore, because 
an American option carries all the same rights and privileges as an otherwise equivalent 
European option, it cannot be worth less than a European option. If it were, you could 
make arbitrage profits by selling a European call and using part of the proceeds to buy an 
otherwise equivalent American call option. Thus, an American option cannot be worth less 
than its European counterpart.
The maximum payoff for a put option occurs if the stock becomes worthless (if, say, 
the company files for bankruptcy). In that case, the put’s payoff is equal to the strike price. 
Because this payoff is the highest possible, a put option cannot be worth more than its strike 
price.
For a call option, the lower the strike price, the more valuable the call option. If the call 
option had a strike price of zero, the holder would always exercise the option and receive 
the stock at no cost. This observation gives us an upper bound on the call price: A call 
option cannot be worth more than the stock itself.
The intrinsic value of an option is the value it would have if it expired immediately. 
Therefore, the intrinsic value is the amount by which the option is currently in-the-money, 
or zero if the option is out-of-the-money. If an American option is worth less than its 
intrinsic value, you could make arbitrage profits by purchasing the option and immediately 
exercising it. Thus, an American option cannot be worth less than its intrinsic value.
The time value of an option is the difference between the current option price and its 
intrinsic value. Because an American option cannot be worth less than its intrinsic value, it 
cannot have a negative time value.
Option Prices and the Exercise Date
For American options, the longer the time to the exercise date, the more valuable the 
option. To see why, let’s consider two options: an option with one year until the exercise 
date and an option with six months until the exercise date. The holder of the one-year 
option can turn her option into a six-month option by simply exercising it early. That is, 
the one-year option has all the same rights and privileges as the six-month option, so by the 
Law of One Price, it cannot be worth less than the six-month option: An American option 

772	
Chapter 20  Financial Options
with a later exercise date cannot be worth less than an otherwise identical American option with 
an earlier exercise date. Usually the right to delay exercising the option is worth something, 
so the option with the later exercise date will be more valuable.
What about European options? The same argument will not work for European 
options, because a one-year European option cannot be exercised early at six months. As 
a consequence, a European option with a later exercise date may potentially trade for less 
than an otherwise identical option with an earlier exercise date. For example, think about 
a European call on a stock that pays a liquidating dividend in eight months (a liquidating 
dividend is paid when a corporation chooses to go out of business, sells off all of its assets, 
and pays out the proceeds as a dividend). A one-year European call option on this stock 
would be worthless, but a six-month call would be worth something.
Option Prices and Volatility
An important criterion that determines the price of an option is the volatility of the under-
lying stock. Consider the following simple example.
Example 20.8
Option Value and Volatility
Problem
Two European call options with a strike price of $50 are written on two different stocks. Suppose 
that tomorrow, the low-volatility stock will have a price of $50 for certain. The high-volatility 
stock will be worth either $60 or $40, with each price having equal probability. If the exercise 
date of both options is tomorrow, which option will be worth more today?
Solution
The expected value of both stocks tomorrow is $50—the low-volatility stock will be worth this 
amount for sure, and the high-volatility stock has an expected value of 1
2 ($40) + 1
2 ($60) = $50. 
However, the options have very different values. The option on the low-volatility stock is worth 
nothing because there is no chance it will expire in-the-money (the low-volatility stock will be 
worth $50 and the strike price is $50). The option on the high-volatility stock is worth a posi-
tive amount because there is a 50% chance that it will be worth $60 - $50 = $10, and a 50% 
chance that it will be worthless. The value today of a 50% chance of a positive payoff (with no 
chance of a loss) is positive.
Example 20.8 illustrates an important principle: The value of an option generally increases 
with the volatility of the stock. The intuition for this result is that an increase in volatility 
increases the likelihood of very high and very low returns for the stock. The holder of a call 
option benefits from a higher payoff when the stock goes up and the option is in-the-
money, but earns the same (zero) payoff no matter how far the stock drops once the option 
is out-of-the-money. Because of this asymmetry of the option’s payoff, an option holder 
gains from an increase in volatility.5
Recall that adding a put option to a portfolio is akin to buying insurance against a 
decline in value. Insurance is more valuable when there is higher volatility—hence put 
options on more volatile stocks are also worth more.
5This relation between the stock’s volatility and the value of an option holds for realistic distributions of 
stock prices assumed by practitioners (described in detail in Chapter 21), in which an increase in volatility 
implies a more “spread out” distribution for the entire range of future stock prices. That said, it need not 
hold, for example, if the volatility of the stock increases in some ranges but falls in others.

20.5	 Exercising Options Early
One might guess that the ability to exercise the American option early would make an 
American option more valuable than an equivalent European option. Surprisingly, this is 
not always the case—sometimes, they have equal value. Let’s see why.
Non-Dividend-Paying Stocks
Let’s consider first options on a stock that will not pay any dividends prior to the expira-
tion date of the options. In that case, the put-call parity formula for the value of the call 
option is (see Eq. 20.3):
C = P + S - PV(K )
We can write the price of the zero-coupon bond as PV(K ) = K - dis(K ), where dis(K ) 
is the amount of the discount from face value to account for interest. Substituting this 
expression into put-call parity gives
	
C = S - K
+
dis(K ) + P 	
(20.5)
In this case, both terms that make up the time value of the call option are positive 
before the expiration date: As long as interest rates remain positive, the discount on a zero-
coupon bond before the maturity date is positive, and the put price is also positive, so a 
European call always has a positive time value. Because an American option is worth at 
least as much as a European option, it must also have a positive time value before 
­expiration. Hence, the price of any call option on a non-dividend-paying stock always exceeds 
its intrinsic value.6
This result implies that it is never optimal to exercise a call option on a non-dividend-
paying stock early—you are always better off just selling the option. It is straightforward to 
see why. When you exercise an option, you get its intrinsic value. But as we have just seen, 
the price of a call option on a non-dividend-paying stock always exceeds its intrinsic value. 
Thus, if you want to liquidate your position in a call on a non-dividend-paying stock, you 
will get a higher price if you sell it rather than exercise it. Because it is never optimal to 
exercise an American call on a non-dividend-paying stock early, the right to exercise the call 
early is worthless. For this reason, an American call on a non-dividend-paying stock has the 
same price as its European counterpart.
To understand the economics underlying this result, note that there are two benefits to 
delaying the exercise of a call option. First, the holder delays paying the strike price, and 
second, by retaining the right not to exercise, the holder’s downside is limited. (These ben-
efits are represented by the discount and put values in Eq. 20.5.)
6This conclusion would not hold if the interest rate faced by traders is negative; in that case the results for 
calls and puts in this section would be reversed.

Example 20.9
Early Exercise of a Put Option on a Non-Dividend-Paying Stock
Problem
Table 20.2 lists the quotes from the CBOE on October 5, 2015, for options on Alphabet stock 
(Google’s holding company) expiring in November 2015. Alphabet will not pay a dividend dur-
ing this period. Identify any option for which exercising the option early is better than selling it.
Solution
Because Alphabet pays no dividends during the life of these options (October 2015 to November 
2015), it should not be optimal to exercise the call options early. In fact, we can check that the 
bid price for each call option exceeds that option’s intrinsic value, so it would be better to sell the 
call than to exercise it. For example, the payoff from exercising a call with a strike of 620 early is 
667.50 - 620 = $47.50, while the option can be sold for $59.10.
On the other hand, an Alphabet shareholder holding a put option with a strike price of $795 
or higher would be better off exercising—rather than selling—the option. For example, by exer-
cising the 805 put the shareholder would receive $805 for her stock, whereas by selling the stock 
and the option she would only receive $667.15 + 127.50 = $794.65. The same is not true of 
the puts with strikes below $795, however. For example, the holder of the 750 put option who 
exercises it early would receive $750 for her stock, but would net $667.15 + 86.50 = $753.65 
by selling the stock and the put instead. Thus, early exercise is only optimal for the deep in-the-
money put options.7
7Selling versus exercising may have different tax consequences or transaction costs for some investors, which could also 
affect this decision.
What about an American put option on a non-dividend-paying stock? Does it ever 
make sense to exercise it early? The answer is yes, under certain circumstances. To see why, 
note that we can rearrange the put-call parity relationship as expressed in Eq. 20.5 to get 
the price of a European put option:
	
P = K - S
+
C - dis(K )	
(20.6)
In this case, the time value of the option includes a negative term, the discount on a bond 
with face value K; this term represents the opportunity cost of waiting to receive the strike 
price K. When the strike price is high and the put option is sufficiently deep in-the-money, 
this discount will be large relative to the value of the call, and the time value of a European put 
option will be negative. In that case, the European put will sell for less than its intrinsic value. 
However, its American counterpart cannot sell for less than its intrinsic value (because other-
wise arbitrage profits would be possible by immediately exercising it), which implies that the 
American option can be worth more than an otherwise identical European option. Because the 
only difference between the two options is the right to exercise the option early, this right must 
be valuable—there must be states in which it is optimal to exercise the American put early.
Let’s examine an extreme case to illustrate when it is optimal to exercise an American 
put early: Suppose the firm goes bankrupt and the stock is worth nothing. In such a case, 
the value of the put equals its upper bound—the strike price—so its price cannot go any 
higher. Thus, no future appreciation is possible. However, if you exercise the put early, 
you can get the strike price today and earn interest on the proceeds in the interim. Hence 
it makes sense to exercise this option early. Although this example is extreme, it illustrates 
that it can be optimal to exercise deep in-the-money put options early.

20.5  Exercising Options Early	
775
If PV(Div) is large enough, the time value of a European call option can be negative, 
implying that its price could be less than its intrinsic value. Because an American option 
can never be worth less than its intrinsic value, the price of the American option can exceed 
the price of a European option.
To understand when it is optimal to exercise the American call option early, note that 
when a company pays a dividend, investors expect the price of the stock to drop to reflect 
the cash paid out. This price drop hurts the owner of a call option because the stock price 
falls, but unlike the owner of the stock, the option holder does not get the dividend as 
compensation. However, by exercising early, the owner of the call option can capture the 
value of the dividend. Thus, the decision to exercise early trades off the benefits of wait-
ing to exercise the call option versus the loss of the dividend. Because a call should only 
be exercised early to capture the dividend, it will only be optimal to do so just before the 
stock’s ex-dividend date.
Dividends have the opposite effect on the time value of a put option. Again, from the 
put-call parity relation, we can write the put value as:
	
P = K - S
+
C - dis(K ) + PV(Div)	
(20.8)
Intuitively, when a stock pays dividends, the holder of a put option will benefit by waiting 
for the stock price to drop after it goes ex-dividend before exercising. Thus, it is less likely 
that a put option on a dividend-paying stock will be exercised early.

Although most traded options are American, options on stock indices, such as the S&P 
500, are typically European. Table 20.4 shows quotes for European calls and puts on the 
S&P 500 index, together with their intrinsic values. At the time of these quotes, the aggre-
gate dividend yield was approximately 2.8% while interest rates were 1.6% for the matu-
rity of the options. Because these are European-style options, it is possible for the option’s 
Example 20.10
Early Exercise of Options on a Dividend-Paying Stock
Problem
General Electric (GE) stock went ex-dividend on December 22, 2005 (only equity holders on 
the previous day are entitled to the dividend). The dividend amount was $0.25. Table 20.3 lists 
the quotes for GE options on December 21, 2005. From the quotes, identify the options that 
should be exercised early rather than sold.
Solution
The holder of a call option on GE stock with a strike price of $32.50 or less is better off exercis-
ing—rather than selling—the option. For example, exercising the 06 January 10 call and imme-
diately selling the stock would net 35.52 - 10 = $25.52. The option itself can be sold for 
$25.40, so the holder is better off by $0.12 by exercising the call rather than selling it. To under-
stand why early exercise can be optimal in this case, note that interest rates were about 0.33% per 
month, so the value of delaying payment of the $10 strike price until January was worth only 
$0.033, and the put option was worth less than $0.05. Thus, from Eq. 20.7, the benefit of delay 
was much less than the $0.25 value of the dividend.8
On the other hand, all of the put options listed have a positive time value and thus should not 
be exercised early. In this case, waiting for the stock to go ex-dividend is more valuable than the 
cost of delaying the receipt of the strike price.
8Again, we have analyzed the early exercise decision ignoring taxes. Some investors may face higher taxes if they exercise 
the option early rather than sell or hold it.

price to be below its intrinsic value, so that its time value is negative. As the table shows, 
this occurs for calls with strikes of 400 or below and for puts with strikes of 1600 or above. 
For the deep in-the-money calls, the present value of the dividends is larger than the inter-
est earned on the low strike prices, making it costly to wait to exercise the option. For the 
deep in-the-money puts, the interest on the high strike prices exceeds the dividends earned, 
again making it costly to wait.

20.6	 Options and Corporate Finance
Although we will delay much of the discussion of how corporations use options until after 
we have explained how to value an option, one very important corporate application does 
not require understanding how to price options: interpreting the capital structure of the 
firm as options on the firm’s assets. We begin by explaining why we can think of equity as 
an option.
Equity as a Call Option
Think of a share of stock as a call option on the assets of the firm with a strike price equal 
to the value of debt outstanding.9 To illustrate, consider a single-period world in which at 
the end of the period the firm is liquidated. If the firm’s value does not exceed the value of 
debt outstanding at the end of the period, the firm must declare bankruptcy and the equity 
9Fischer Black and Myron Scholes discussed this insight in their path-breaking option valuation paper, 
“The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,” Journal of Political Economy 81 (1973): 637–654.

Chapter 20  Financial Options
holders receive nothing. Conversely, if the value exceeds the value of debt outstanding, the 
equity holders get whatever is left once the debt has been repaid. Figure 20.8 illustrates this 
payoff. Note how the payoff to equity looks exactly the same as the payoff of a call option.
Debt as an Option Portfolio
We can also represent debt using options. In this case, you can think of the debt holders as 
owning the firm and having sold a call option with a strike price equal to the required debt 
payment. If the value of the firm exceeds the required debt payment, the call will be exer-
cised; the debt holders will therefore receive the strike price (the required debt payment) 
and “give up” the firm. If the value of the firm does not exceed the required debt payment, 
the call will be worthless, the firm will declare bankruptcy, and the debt holders will be 
entitled to the firm’s assets. Figure 20.9 illustrates this payoff.
There is also another way to view corporate debt: as a portfolio of risk-free debt and a 
short position in a put option on the firm’s assets with a strike price equal to the required 
debt payment:
	
Risky debt = Risk@free debt - Put option on firm assets	
(20.9)
When the firm’s assets are worth less than the required debt payment, the put is in-the-
money; the owner of the put option will therefore exercise the option and receive the dif-
ference between the required debt payment and the firm’s asset value (see Figure 20.9). 
This leaves the portfolio holder (debt holder) with just the assets of the firm. If the firm’s 
value is greater than the required debt payment, the put is worthless, leaving the portfolio 
holder with the required debt payment.
Credit Default Swaps
By rearranging Equation 20.9, notice that we can eliminate a bond’s credit risk by buying 
the very same put option to protect or insure it:
Risk@free debt = Risky debt + Put option on firm assets

If the value of the firm’s

that remains after the debt 
is repaid; otherwise, the firm 
is bankrupt and its equity is 
worthless. Thus, the payoff 
to equity is equivalent to

assets with a strike price 
equal to the required debt

Credit Default Swaps
contracts, as well as provided for trading through a central 
clearing house that acts as a counterparty to all trades. To 
protect itself against counterparty default, the clearing house 
would impose strict margin requirements. In addition to 
improving transparency, this process allows contracts that 
offset each other to be cancelled rather than simply offset, 
which should help reduce the creation of new credit risk by 
the very market designed to help control it!
Ironically, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis the CDS 
market itself became a critical source of credit risk of concern 
to regulators. American International Group (AIG) required 
a federal bailout in excess of $100 billion due to (1) losses 
on CDS protection it had sold, and (2) concern that if it 
defaulted on paying this insurance, banks and other firms 
who had purchased this insurance to hedge their own expo-
sures would default as well. To reduce these systemic risks 
in the future, regulators have moved to standardize CDS 
Global Financial Crisis
We refer to this put option, which can insure a firm’s credit risk, as a credit default swap 
(or CDS). In a credit default swap, the buyer pays a premium to the seller (often in the 
form of periodic payments) and receives a payment from the seller to make up for the loss 
if the underlying bond defaults.
Investment banks developed and began trading CDSs in the late 1990s as a means to 
allow bond investors to insure the credit risk of the bonds in their portfolios. Many hedge 
funds and other investors soon began using these contracts as a means to speculate on the 
prospects of a firm and its likelihood of default even if they did not hold its bonds. By 
late 2007, credit default swaps on over $45 trillion worth of bonds were outstanding—an 
amount far larger than the total size of the corporate bond market (about $6 trillion).
While this market’s large size is impressive, it is also misleading: Because CDSs are 
contracts written between counterparties, a buyer of a contract who wants to unwind 
the position cannot simply sell the contract on an exchange like a standard stock option.

If the value of the firm’s 
assets exceeds the required

are fully repaid. Otherwise, 
the firm is bankrupt and the 
debt holders receive the

that the payoff to debt 
(orange line) can be viewed 
either as (1) the firm’s 
assets, less the equity call 
option, or (2) a risk-free 
bond, less a put option on 
the assets with a strike price 
equal to the required debt

Chapter 20  Financial Options
Instead, the buyer must enter a new offsetting CDS contract with a possibly new counter-
party (e.g., a buyer of insurance on GE could then sell insurance on GE to someone else, 
leaving no net exposure to GE). In this way, a new contract is created with each trade, even 
if investors’ net exposure is not increased. For example, when Lehman Brothers defaulted 
in September 2009, buyers of CDS protection against such a default were owed close to 
$400 billion. However, after netting all offsetting positions, only about $7 billion actually 
changed hands.
Pricing Risky Debt
Viewing debt as an option portfolio is useful, as it provides insight into how credit spreads 
for risky debt are determined. Let’s illustrate with an example.
Example 20.11
Calculating the Yield on New Corporate Debt
Problem
As of September 2012, Google (GOOG) had no debt. Suppose the firm’s managers consider 
recapitalizing the firm by issuing zero-coupon debt with a face value of $163.5 billion due in 
January of 2014, and using the proceeds to pay a special dividend. Suppose too that Google 
had 327 million shares outstanding, trading at $700.77 per share, implying a market value of 
$229.2 billion. The risk-free rate over this horizon is 0.25%. Using the call option quotes in 
Figure 20.10, estimate the credit spread Google would have to pay on the debt assuming perfect 
capital markets.
Solution
Assuming perfect capital markets, the total value of Google’s equity and debt should remain 
unchanged after the recapitalization. The $163.5 billion face value of the debt is equivalent 
to a claim of $163.5 billion/(327 million shares) = $500 per share on Google’s current assets. 
Because Google’s shareholders will only receive the value in excess of this debt claim, the value 
of Google’s equity after the recap is equivalent to the current value of a call option with a strike 
price of $500. From the quotes in Figure  20.10, such a call option has a value of approxi-
mately $222.05 per share (using the average of the bid and ask quotes). Multiplying by Google’s 
total number of shares, we can estimate the total value of Google’s equity after the recap as 
$222.05 * 327 million shares = $72.6 billion.
To estimate the value of the new debt, we can subtract the estimated equity value from 
Google’s total value of $229.2 billion; thus, the estimated debt value is 229.2 - 72.6 = $156.6 
billion. Because the debt matures 16 months from the date of the quotes, this value corresponds 
to a yield to maturity of
a 163.5
156.6b
12/16
- 1 = 3.29%
Thus, Google’s credit spread for the new debt issue would be about 3.29% - 0.25% = 3.04%.
Using the methodology in Example 20.11, Figure 20.10 plots this yield on Google debt 
as a function of the amount borrowed and illustrates the relation between the amount bor-
rowed and the yield. The analysis in this example demonstrates the use of option valuation 
methods to assess credit risk and value risky debt. While here we used data from option 
quotes, in the next chapter we will develop methods to value options as well as risky debt 
and other distress costs based on firm fundamentals.

Agency Conflicts
In addition to pricing, the option characterization of equity and debt securities provides 
a new interpretation of the agency conflicts between debt and equity holders that we dis-
cussed in Chapter 16. Recall that the price of an option generally increases with the volatil-
ity level of the underlying security. Because equity is like a call option on the firm’s assets, 
equity holders will benefit from investments that increase the risk of the firm. On the other 
hand, debt holders are short a put option on the firm’s assets. Thus, they will be hurt by an 
increase in the firm’s risk. This conflict of interest regarding risk-taking is the asset substi-
tution problem (see Section 16.5), and we can quantify it in terms of the sensitivity of the 
option values to the firm’s volatility.
Similarly, when the firm makes new investments that increase the value of the firm’s 
assets, the value of a put option on the firm will decline. Because debt holders are short 
a put option, the value of the firm’s debt will increase. Thus, some fraction of each dollar 
increase in the value of the firm’s assets will go to debt holders, rather than equity holders, 
reducing equity holders’ incentive to invest. This problem is the debt overhang problem we 
discussed in Section 16.5, and we can quantify it in terms of the sensitivity of the call and 
put values to the value of the firm’s underlying assets.
The usefulness of options to corporate managers is by no means limited to the appli-
cations we discuss in this section. However, to understand the other applications, and to 
quantify the results we have discussed here, we need deeper knowledge of what determines 
the option price. In Chapter 21, we develop these tools and explore how to calculate the 
price of an option.

Chapter 20  Financial Options
20.1  Option Basics
	
n	 A call option gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to purchase an asset at some 
future date. A put option gives the holder the right to sell an asset at some future date.
	
n	 When a holder of an option enforces the agreement and buys or sells the share of stock at the 
agreed-upon price, the holder is exercising the option.
	
n	 The price at which the holder agrees to buy or sell the share of stock when the option is exer-
cised is called the strike price or exercise price.
	
n	 The last date on which the holder has the right to exercise the option is known as the expiration 
date.
	
n	 An American option can be exercised on any date up to, and including, the exercise date. A 
European option can be exercised only on the expiration date.
	
n	 If the payoff from exercising the option immediately is positive, the option is in-the-money. 
If the stock price equals the strike price, the option is at-the-money. Finally, if you would lose 
money by exercising an option immediately, the option is out-of-the-money.
20.2  Option Payoffs at Expiration
	
n	 Given stock price S and strike price K, the value of a call option at expiration is
	
C = max (S - K, 0)
(20.1)
	
n	 The value of a put option at expiration is
	
P = max (K - S, 0)
(20.2)
	
n	 An investor holding a short position in an option has an obligation; he or she takes the opposite 
side of the contract to the investor who is long.
	
n	 The value an option would have if it expired today is its intrinsic value. The time value of an 
option is the difference between its current value and its intrinsic value.
20.3  Put-Call Parity
	
n	 Put-call parity relates the value of the European call to the value of the European put and the 
stock.
	
C = P + S - PV(K ) - PV(Div)
(20.4)
20.4  Factors Affecting Option Prices
	
n	 Call options with lower strike prices are more valuable than otherwise identical calls with higher 
strike prices. Conversely, put options are more valuable with higher strike prices.
	
n	 Call options increase in value, and put options decrease in value, when the stock price rises.
	
n	 Arbitrage bounds for option prices:
n	 An American option cannot be worth less than its European counterpart.
n	 A put option cannot be worth more than its exercise price.
n	 A call option cannot be worth more than the stock itself.
n	 An American option cannot be worth less than its intrinsic value.
n	 An American option with a later exercise date cannot be worth less than an otherwise identi-
cal American option with an earlier exercise date.
	
n	 The value of an option generally increases with the volatility of the stock.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.

20.5  Exercising Options Early
	
n	 It is never optimal to exercise an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock early. 
Thus, an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock has the same price as its Euro-
pean counterpart.
	
n	 It can be optimal to exercise a deep in-the-money American put option. It can be optimal to 
exercise an American call option just before the stock goes ex-dividend.
20.6  Options and Corporate Finance
	
n	 Equity can be viewed as a call option on the firm’s assets.
	
n	 The debt holders can be viewed as owning the firm’s assets and having sold a call option with a 
strike price equal to the required debt payment.
	
n	 Alternatively, corporate debt is a portfolio of riskless debt and a short position in a put option 
on the firm’s cash flow with a strike price equal to the required debt payment. This put option 
is also referred to as a credit default swap.
	
n	 Option valuations can be used to estimate the appropriate yield for risky debt, as well as to 
estimate the magnitude of agency cost problems within the firm.

Chapter 20  Financial Options
Data Case
Your uncle owns 10,000 shares of Walmart stock. He is concerned about the short-term outlook 
for Walmart’s stock due to an impending “major announcement.” This announcement has received 
much attention in the press so he expects the stock price will change significantly in the next month, 
but is unsure whether it will be a profit or a loss. He hopes the price will increase, but he also doesn’t 
want to suffer if the price were to fall in the short term.
His broker recommended he buy a “protective put” on the stock, but your uncle has never traded 
options before and is not much of a risk taker. He wants you to devise a plan for him to capitalize if 
the announcement is positive but to still be protected if the news causes the price to drop. You real-
ize that a protective put will protect him from the downside risk, but you think a straddle may offer 
similar downside protection, while increasing the upside potential. You decide to show him both 
strategies and the resulting profits and returns he could face from each.
	
1.	 Download option quotes on options that expire in approximately one month on Walmart from 
the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com) into an Excel spreadsheet (click the 
Quotes & Data tab at the top left portion of the screen and then select “Delayed Quotes”). If you 
choose to download “near term at-the-money” options you will get a range of options expiring in 
about a month. Note: You can only get active quotes while the exchange is open; bid or ask prices 
are not available when it is closed.
	
2.	 Determine your uncle’s profit and return using the protective put.
a.	 Identify the expiring put with an exercise price closest to, but not below, the current stock 
price. Determine the investment required to protect all 10,000 shares.
b.	 Determine the put price at expiration for each stock price at $5 increments within a range of 
$40 of Walmart’s current price using Eq. 20.2.
c.	 Compute the profit (or loss) on the put for each stock price used in part (b).
d.	Compute the profit on the stock from the current price for each stock price used in part (b).
e.	 Compute his overall profit (or loss) of the protective put, that is, combining the put and his 
stock for each price used in parts (c) and (d).
f.	 Compute the overall return of the protective put.
	
3.	 Determine your uncle’s profit and return using the straddle.
a.	 Compute the investment your uncle would have to make to purchase the call and put with the 
same exercise price and expiration as the put option in Question 2, to cover all 10,000 of his shares.
b.	 Determine the value at expiration of the call and the put options at each $5 increment of 
stock prices within a range of $40 of Walmart’s current price using Eqs. 20.1 and 20.2.
c.	 Determine the profit (or loss) on the options at each stock price used in part (b).
d.	 Determine the profit (or loss) on the stock from the current price for each stock price used in part (b).
e.	 Compute his overall profit (or loss) of the stock plus straddle, that is, combining the position 
in both options and his stock for each price used in parts (c) and (d).
f.	 Compute the overall return of this position.
	
4.	 Was the broker correct that the protective put would prevent your uncle from losing if the 
announcement caused a large decrease in the stock value? What is your uncle’s maximum possible 
loss using the protective put?
	
5.	 What is the maximum possible loss your uncle could experience using the straddle?
	
6.	 Which strategy, the protective put or the straddle, provides the maximum upside potential for 
your uncle? Why does this occur?

Option Valuation
rOBerT MerTON AND MYrON SChOLeS Were AWArDeD the 1997 
Nobel Prize in economics for their 1973 discovery, together with Fischer Black,1 of a 
formula to calculate the price of an option: the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. 
Although the formula itself represented an enormous contribution to economics, even 
more important were the techniques that Black, Scholes, and Merton developed to 
value options. These techniques changed the course of financial economics and gave 
birth to a new profession: financial engineering. Routinely, financial engineers use for-
mulas to price financial securities in much the same way as civil engineers use Newton’s 
laws to build bridges. The most important factor contributing to the huge growth in the 
types of financial securities available in the market are the techniques used to price 
them, which can all be traced to the Black-­Scholes formula. Today, most large corpora-
tions rely on these financial securities to manage risk. Without the Black-Scholes 
­formula, the job of corporate managers would be very different: Many ­corporations 
would be forced to bear much more risk than they presently do.
These formulas rely primarily on the Law of One Price. That is, they do not depend 
on knowing unobservable parameters such as investor tastes and beliefs. The great insight 
that Black, ­Scholes, and Merton brought to economics is that in the case of options it is not 
necessary to model preferences. As we will explain in this chapter, their work demonstrated 
how to apply the Law of One Price to value a vast new range of financial securities based on 
the current market prices of stocks and bonds.
Our objective in this chapter is to explain the most commonly used techniques (all 
of which derive from Black and Scholes’ insights) for calculating the price of an option: 
the Binomial Option Pricing Model, the Black-Scholes formula, and risk-neutral probabilities. 
We apply these techniques to show how to value stock options and quantify their risk 
and return. We then show how to use the Black-Scholes formula to estimate the beta of
1The Black-Scholes formula was derived by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes (“The Pricing of 
Options and Corporate Liabilities,” Journal of Political Economy 81, 1973), building on earlier 
work by Robert Merton. Unfortunately, Black died two years before the prize was awarded.

risky debt. With this foundation in place, in subsequent chapters we will be able to cover important 
applications of option pricing for corporate managers.
	
21.1	 The Binomial Option Pricing Model
We begin our study of option pricing with the Binomial Option Pricing Model.2 The 
model prices options by making the simplifying assumption that at the end of the next 
period, the stock price has only two possible values. Under this assumption, we demon-
strate the key insight of Black and Scholes—that option payoffs can be replicated exactly 
by constructing a portfolio out of a risk-free bond and the underlying stock. Furthermore, 
we will see that the model can be quite realistic if we consider stock price movements over 
very short time intervals.
A Two-State Single-Period Model
Let’s start by calculating the price of a single-period option in a very simple world. We will 
value the option by first constructing a replicating portfolio, a portfolio of other securi-
ties that has exactly the same value in one period as the option. Then, because they have 
the same payoffs, the Law of One Price implies that the current value of the call and the 
replicating portfolio must be equal.
Consider a European call option that expires in one period and has an exercise price 
of $50. Assume that the stock price today is equal to $50. Assume here and throughout 
the chapter that the stock pays no dividends (unless explicitly indicated). In one period, 
the stock price will either rise by $10 or fall by $10. The one-period risk-free rate is 6%. 
We can summarize this information on a binomial tree—a timeline with two branches at 
every date representing the possible events that could happen at those times:
The binomial tree contains all the information we currently know: the value of the 
stock, bond, and call options in each state in one period, as well as the price of the stock 
and bond today (for simplicity, we assume the bond price today is $1, so in one period it 
will be worth $1.06). We define the state in which the stock price goes up (to $60) as the 
up state and the state in which the stock price goes down (to $40) as the down state.
In order to determine the value of the option using the Law of One Price, we must show 
that we can replicate its payoffs using a portfolio of the stock and the bond. Let  be the

stock and bond must match the value of the option in every possible state. Thus, in the up 
state, the value of the portfolio must be $10 (the value of the call in that state):
	
60 + 1.06B = 10
(21.1)
In the down state, the value of the portfolio must be zero (the value of the call in that state):
	
40 + 1.06B = 0
(21.2)
Equations 21.1 and 21.2 are two simultaneous equations with two unknowns,  and B. 
We’ll write down the general formula to solve these equations shortly, but in this case, we 
can check that the solution is
	
  = 0.5
B = -18.8679
A portfolio that is long 0.5 share of stock and short approximately $18.87 worth of bonds 
(i.e., we have borrowed $18.87 at a 6% interest rate) will have a value in one period that 
matches the value of the call exactly. Let’s verify this explicitly:
 60 * 0.5 - 1.06 * 18.87 = 10
 40 * 0.5 - 1.06 * 18.87 = 0
Therefore, by the Law of One Price, the price of the call option today must equal the cur-
rent market value of the replicating portfolio. The value of the portfolio today is the value 
of 0.5 shares at the current share price of $50, less the amount borrowed:
	
50 + B = 50(0.5) - 18.87 = 6.13
(21.3)
Thus, the price of the call today is $6.13.3
Figure  21.1 illustrates how we can use the stock and the bond to replicate the 
­payoff of the call option in this case. As a function of the future stock price, the pay-
off of the replicating portfolio is a line with a slope of  = 0.5, and an intercept of 
FV(B) = 1.06(-18.87) = -20. This line is very different from the line showing the ­payoff 
3If the call’s price were different, say $6.50, there would be an arbitrage opportunity: we could earn a 
profit by buying the replicating portfolio for $6.13 and selling the call for $6.50. Because they have the 
same payoff, we have taken no risk, and earn an immediate profit of 6.50 - 6.13 = $0.37 per option.

of the call option, which is zero below the strike price of $50 and increases 1:1 with the 
stock price above $50. The secret of the binomial model is that while the option and the 
replicating portfolio do not have the same payoffs in general, they have the same payoffs 
given the only two outcomes we have assumed possible for the stock price: $40 and $60.
Note that by using the Law of One Price, we are able to solve for the price of the option 
without knowing the probabilities of the states in the binomial tree. That is, we did not need 
to specify the likelihood that the stock would go up versus down. This remarkable result 
was a very important discovery because the probabilities of future states are part of investor 
beliefs, so they are very difficult to estimate. The preceding argument shows that we do not 
need to know these probabilities to value options. It also means that we do not need to 
know the expected return of the stock, which will depend on these probabilities.
The Binomial Pricing Formula
Now that we have seen the basic idea, let’s consider a more general example. Suppose the 
current stock price is S, and the stock price will either go up to Su or down to Sd next 
period. The risk-free interest rate is rf . Let’s determine the price of an option that has a 
value of Cu if the stock goes up, and Cd if the stock goes down:
S
Su
Stock
1
0
Option
Sd
Cu
Cd
Note that in the depiction of the binomial tree above, for simplicity, we did not write 
down the bond payoff since it earns a return of rf  in either case.
What is the value of the option today? Again, we must determine the number of shares 
of stock, , and the position in the bond, B, such that the payoff of the replicating ­portfolio 
matches the payoff of the option if the stock goes up or down:
	
Su  + (1 + rf )B = Cu    and    Sd  + (1 + rf )B = Cd
(21.4)
Solving these two equations for the two unknowns  and B, we get the general formula 
for the replicating formula in the binomial model:
Replicating Portfolio in the Binomial Model
	
 = Cu - Cd
Su - Sd and B = Cd - Sd 
1 + rf

(21.5)
Note that the formula for  in Eq. 21.5 can be interpreted as the sensitivity of the option’s 
value to changes in the stock price. It is equal to the slope of the line showing the payoff of 
the replicating portfolio in Figure 21.1.
Once we know the replicating portfolio, we can calculate the value C of the option 
today as the cost of this portfolio:
Option Price in the Binomial Model
	
C = S + B
(21.6)

	
21.1  The Binomial Option Pricing Model	
793
Equations 21.5 and 21.6 summarize the binomial option pricing model. Although they are 
relatively simple, by applying them in different ways we will see that they are quite power-
ful. For one thing, they do not require that the option we are valuing is a call option—we 
can use them to value any security whose payoff depends on the stock price. For example, 
we can use them to price a put, as presented in Example 21.1.
You might be skeptical at this point. Showing that we can value call and put options in 
a simple two-state one-period example is one thing; pricing real-world options is another 
matter altogether. Yet, as we show in the next section, this simple two-state model is easily 
generalized.
A Multiperiod Model
The problem with the simple two-state example is that there are many more than two 
­possible outcomes for the stock price in the real world. To make the model more realistic, 
we must allow for the possibility of many states and periods.
Example 21.1
Valuing a Put Option
Problem
Suppose a stock is currently trading for $60, and in one period will either go up by 20% or fall 
by 10%. If the one-period risk-free rate is 3%, what is the price of a European put option that 
expires in one period and has an exercise price of $60?
Solution
We begin by constructing a binomial tree:
Thus, we can solve for the value of the put by using Eq. 21.5 and Eq. 21.6 with Cu = 0 (the 
value of the put when the stock goes up) and Cd = 6 (the value of the put when the stock goes 
down). Therefore,
 = Cu - Cd

0 - 6

1 + rf
= 6 - 54(-0.3333)
1.03
= 23.30
This portfolio is short 0.3333 shares of the stock, and has $23.30 invested in the risk-free bond. 
Let’s check that it replicates the put if the stock goes up or down:
72(-0.3333) + 1.03(23.30) = 0  and  54(-0.3333) + 1.03(23.30) = 6
Thus, the value of the put is the initial cost of this portfolio. Using Eq. 21.6:
 Put value = C = S + B
 = 60(-0.3333) + 23.30 = $3.30

The key property of the binomial model is that in each period, there are only two pos-
sible outcomes—the stock either goes up or down. But by adding an additional period, the 
number of possible stock prices at the end has increased. Let’s assume again that the risk-
free rate of interest is 6% per period and consider how to price a call option with a strike 
price of $50 that expires in two periods.
To calculate the value of an option in a multiperiod binomial tree, we start at the end 
of the tree and work backward. At time 2, the option expires, so its value is equal to its 
intrinsic value. In this case, the call will be worth $10 if the stock price goes up to $60, and 
will be worth zero otherwise.
Next, let’s determine the value of the option in each possible state at time 1. What is the 
value of the option if the stock price has gone up to $50 at time 1? In this case, because the 
option expires next period, the remaining part of the binomial tree is as follows:
This binomial tree is exactly the same tree that we considered in the one-period model at 
the start of this section. There, we computed the replicating portfolio as having  = 0.5 shares 
of stock and a bond position of B = -$18.87, for an initial call value of $6.13 (see Eq. 21.3).
What if the stock price has dropped to $30 at time 1? In that case, the binomial tree for 
the next period is

	
21.1  The Binomial Option Pricing Model	
795
The option is worthless in both states at time 2, so the value of the option in the down 
state at time 1 must also be zero (and the replicating portfolio is simply  = 0 and B = 0).
Given the value of the call option in either state at time 1, we can now work backward 
and determine the value of the call at time 0. In that case, we can write the binomial tree 
over the next period as follows:
In this case, the call values at the end of the tree (time 1) are not the final payoffs of the 
option, but are the values of the option one period prior to expiration. Nonetheless, 
we can use the same binomial formulas to calculate the replicating portfolio at time 
0, which is a portfolio whose value will match the value of the option at time 1. From 
Eq. 21.5:
  = Cu - Cd
Su - Sd
= 6.13 - 0
50 - 30 = 0.3065   and
 B = Cd - Sd 
1 + rf
= 0 - 30(0.3065)
1.06
= -8.67
From Eq. 21.6, the initial value of the call option is equal to the initial cost of this 
portfolio:
C = S + B = 40(0.3065) - 8.67 = $3.59
Therefore, the initial value of the call option at time 0 is $3.59.
For this two-period call option, while we can still construct the option out of the stock 
and the bond, we now need to adjust our replicating portfolio at the end of each period. 
That is, we start off long 0.3065 shares of stock and borrow $8.67 (for an initial cost 
of $3.59). If the stock price drops to $30, our shares are worth $30 * 0.3065 = $9.20, 
and our debt has grown to $8.67 * 1.06 = $9.20. Thus, the net value of the portfo-
lio is worthless (matching the option value), and we can liquidate the portfolio (at no 
cost). If the stock price rises to $50, the net value of the portfolio rises to $6.13. In 
that case, the new  of the replicating portfolio is 0.5. Therefore, to match the new 
, we buy 0.50 - 0.3065 = 0.1935 more shares of stock and pay for it by borrowing 
0.1935 * $50 = $9.67. This re-trading requires no new money; at the end our total debt 
will be $8.67 * 1.06 + $9.67 = $18.87, which matches the value for B we calculated ear-
lier. Finally, on the expiration date at time 2, the value of the portfolio is $10 if the stock 
goes up to $60, and is zero otherwise.
The idea that you can replicate the option payoff by dynamically trading in a portfolio 
of the underlying stock and a risk-free bond was one of the most important contribu­- 
tions of the original Black-Scholes paper. Today, this kind of replication strategy is called a 
dynamic trading strategy.

Example 21.2
Using the Binomial Option Pricing Model to Value a Put Option
Problem
Suppose the current price of Narver Network Systems stock is $50 per share. In each of the next 
two years, the stock price will either increase by 20% or decrease by 10%. The 3% one-year risk-
free rate of interest will remain constant. Calculate the price of a two-year European put option 
on Narver Network Systems stock with a strike price $60.
Solution
Here is the binomial tree for the stock price, together with the final payoffs of the put option:
If the stock goes up to $60 at time 1, we are in exactly the same situation as in Example 21.1. Using 
our result there, we see that if the stock is worth $60 at time 1, the value of the put option is $3.30.
If the stock goes down to $45 at time 1, then at time 2 the put option will be worth either $6 
if the stock goes up or $19.50 if the stock goes down. Using Eq. 21.5:
 = Cu - Cd
Su - Sd
= 6 - 19.5
54 - 40.5 = -1  and  B = Cd - Sd 
1 + rf
= 19.5 - 40.5(-1)
1.03
= 58.25
This portfolio is short one share of the stock, and has $58.25 invested in the risk-free bond. 
Because the value of the bond will grow to $58.25 * 1.03 = $60 at time 2, the value of the 
replicating portfolio will be $60 less the final price of the stock, matching the payoff of the put 
option. Thus, the value of the put is the cost of this portfolio. Using Eq. 21.6:
Put value = C = S + B = 45(-1) + 58.25 = $13.25
Now consider the value of the put option at time 0. In period 1, we have calculated that the put 
will be worth $3.30 if the stock goes up to $60 and $13.25 if the stock falls to $45. The binomial 
tree at time 0 is
Using Eq. 21.5 and Eq. 21.6, the replicating portfolio and put value at time 0 are
  = Cu - Cd
Su - Sd
= 3.30 - 13.25
60 - 45
= -0.6633,
 B = Cd - Sd 
1 + rf
= 13.25 - 45(-0.6633)
1.03
= 41.84,  and
Put value = C = S + B = 50(-0.6633) + 41.84 = $8.68
Thus, the value of a European put option at time 0 is $8.68.

21.1  The Binomial Option Pricing Model	
797
Making the Model Realistic
Using the methods of the previous section, we can value options given any number of peri-
ods in the binomial stock price tree. But of course, to price an option for an actual stock, 
the binomial tree must be a realistic model of the way the stock is likely to evolve in the 
future.
While binary up or down movements are not the way stock prices behave on an annual 
or even daily basis, they are a much more reasonable description of stock prices over very 
short time periods, such as the time between trades. By decreasing the length of each 
period, and increasing the number of periods in the stock price tree, we can construct a 
realistic model for the stock price. Figure 21.2 shows an example of a stock price path in 
which the stock price moves up or down by 1% in each of 900 periods over the year. With 
many short periods, these stock price paths look very similar to the price charts for real 
stocks. Practitioners routinely use this method to calculate the prices of options and other 
types of derivative securities. With a fast computer, prices can be computed very quickly 
even with thousands of periods.5
As mentioned earlier, the techniques of the binomial option pricing model are not spe-
cific to European call and put options. We can use it to price any security whose payoff 
depends on the stock price. But for the special case of European call and put options, there 
is an alternative approach. If we let the length of each period shrink to zero, and the number 
of periods per year grows to infinity, the results of the binomial option pricing model can be 
calculated using a single, simple formula: the Black-Scholes formula. We consider it next.
5There is a question of how to calibrate the up or down movements each period. A standard approach is 
to assume the stock’s return each period is {s/1n, where s is the stock’s volatility and n is the number 
of periods per year.

21.2	 The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model
Although Fischer Black and Myron Scholes did not originally derive it that way, the 
­Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model can be derived from the Binomial Option Pric-
ing Model by making the length of each period, and the movement of the stock price per 
period, shrink to zero and letting the number of periods grow infinitely large. Rather than 
derive the formula here, we will state it and focus on its applications.
The Black-Scholes Formula
Before stating the Black-Scholes formula for the price of an option, it is necessary to intro-
duce some terminology. Let S be the current price of the stock, T be the number of years 
left to expiration, K be the exercise price, and s be the annual volatility (standard devia-
tion) of the stock’s return. Then, the value, at time t, of a call option on a stock that does 
not pay dividends prior to the option’s expiration date is given by
Black-Scholes Price of a Call Option on a Non-Dividend-Paying Stock
	
C = S * N(d1) - PV(K ) * N(d2)
(21.7)
where PV(K) is the present value (price) of a risk-free zero-coupon bond that pays K on 
the expiration date of the option, N(d  ) is the cumulative normal distribution—that is, 
the probability, as shown in Figure 21.3, that a normally distributed variable is less than 
d—and

N(d⁜渠), the cumulative normal

than d. This probability is equal 
to the area under the normal 
­distribution (bell curve) to the 
left of the point d—the shaded 
area in the figure. Because it is a 
­probability, N(d⁜渠) has a ­minimum 
value of 0 and a ­maximum 
value of 1. It can be calculated 
in Excel by using the function

21.2  The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model	
799
Professor Myron S. Scholes is  
co-­inventor of the Black-Scholes options 
pricing model, for which he won the 
Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences in 
1997. He is the Frank E. Buck Professor 
of Finance, Emeritus, at Stanford  
Graduate School of Business.
QUESTION: At the time you derived the 
Black-Scholes formula, did you antici-
pate its influence in the financial world?
ANSWER: Fischer Black and I believed 
that the option-pricing ­technology 
would be used to value existing 
­contracts such as options on stock, war-
rants, corporate debt, and mortgage 
contracts. We did not anticipate that 
in the future our technology would be 
used to develop and price new instru-
ments, although we were not alone. For 
example, several journals rejected our 
paper. Only after Merton Miller explained to the editors of the 
Journal of Political Economy that our findings were not arcane 
but had general importance did it accept our paper. Fischer 
and I rewrote the paper to include a description of the impor-
tance of options in the economy, such as how to value the 
stock of a corporation with risky debt in its capital structure.
QUESTION: What is the most important contribution of the 
Black-Scholes formula?
ANSWER: The Black-Scholes option paper has two parts: 
a technology to value options and an illustration of that 
technology to the pricing of options under a stylized set of 
assumptions that was later called the Black-Scholes options 
pricing model. The Nobel Prize was awarded, in part, for 
developing the technology to value derivatives. We showed 
that if investors could hedge the systematic components of 
asset returns, then the remaining risks were unsystematic 
and the expected return of a portfolio of unsystematic 
risks will equal the risk-free rate. Moreover, as trading-time 
became continuous, the unsystematic risk would disappear.
When we developed the model we did not believe that 
the risk-free rate or the volatility of an asset remained con-
stant. We assumed that to be the case, however, to illustrate 
the application of the model. This 
­illustration became the Black-­Scholes 
model. The underlying technology 
does not assume the constancy of either 
parameter. What impressed and particu-
larly pleased me was the realization that 
investors could price an option without 
knowing the expected rate of return on 
the underlying asset or the expected ter-
minal value of the option at its maturity. 
I believe that the technology to value 
options and the underlying economics 
to support its development were the 
most important part of our paper.
QUESTION: How did you arrive at the 
insight that you could create a risk-free 
portfolio trading the stock and option?
ANSWER: We first needed to determine 
how much stock to short against a long 
position in the underlying option, such 
that small movements in the price of 
the underlying stock would be offset by opposite movements 
in the price of the option—a hedged position. As explained 
above, if the returns on this combined stock and option 
investment were uncorrelated with the market portfolio 
(assuming that CAPM held over short time periods—i.e., 
the returns were normally distributed) or riskless in continu-
ous time (if investors could trade continuously to adjust their 
stock position), to prevent arbitrage profits the return on the 
hedged position had to be equal to the risk-free rate.
QUESTION: What words of wisdom might you offer future 
practitioners on using the Black-Scholes formula in light of the 
2007–2009 financial crisis?
ANSWER: Some blamed models such as ours for the finan-
cial crisis. In part, the model can’t be correct other than for 
relatively short-dated options; it would not make economic 
sense to use the same calibration of the pricing technol-
ogy over long periods of time. Most of the difficulties in 
using models arise from the incorrect use of technology 
and assumptions of how to calibrate the models. The crisis 
highlighted once again that assumptions are important in 
building and calibrating models.
Interview with
Myron S. Scholes

800	
Chapter 21  Option Valuation
We need only five input parameters to price the call: the stock price, the strike price, the 
exercise date, the risk-free interest rate (to compute the present value of the strike price), 
and the volatility of the stock. What is equally notable is what we do not need. Just as we do 
not need to know the probabilities in the Binomial Option Pricing Model, we do not need 
to know the expected return on the stock to calculate the option price in the Black-Scholes 
Option Pricing Model. The expected return of the stock is difficult to measure with great 
accuracy as we learned in Part 4; if it were a required input, we could not expect the for-
mula to deliver the option price with much accuracy. Indeed, the only parameter in the 
Black-Scholes formula that we need to forecast is the stock’s volatility. Because a stock’s vol-
atility is much easier to measure (and forecast) than its expected return, the Black-­Scholes 
formula can be very precise.
You might wonder how it is possible to compute the value of a security like an option that 
appears to depend critically on the future stock price without knowing the expected return 
of the stock. In fact, the expected return of the stock is already reflected in the stock’s cur-
rent price (which is the discounted value of its future payoffs). The Black-Scholes formula 
depends on the stock’s current price, and so, in a sense, uses this information implicitly.
The Black-Scholes formula is derived assuming that the call is a European option. Recall 
from Chapter 20 that an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock always has 
the same price as its European counterpart. Thus, the Black-Scholes formula can be used to 
price American or European call options on non-dividend-paying stocks.
Example 21.3
Valuing a Call Option with the Black-Scholes Formula
Problem
JetBlue Airways does not pay dividends. Using the data in Table 21.1, compare the price on July 
24, 2009, for the December 2009 American call option on JetBlue with a strike price of $6 to 
the price predicted by the Black-Scholes formula. Assume that the volatility of JetBlue is 65% 
per year and that the risk-free rate of interest is 1% per year.
Solution
We use $5.03 (the closing price) for the per-share price of JetBlue stock. Because the 
­December contract expires on the Saturday following the third Friday of December (Decem-
ber 19), there are 148 days left until expiration. The present value of the strike price is 
PV(K ) = 6.00/(1.01)148/365 = $5.976. Calculating d1 and d2 from Eq. 21.8 gives
 d1 = ln[S/PV(K )]
s2T
+ s2T
2
 = ln(5.03/5.976)
0.652148
365
+

365
2
= -0.209
 d2 = d1 - s2T = -0.209 - 0.652148
365 = -0.623
Substituting d1 and d2 into the Black-Scholes formula given by Eq. 21.7 results in
 C = S * N(d1) - PV(K ) * N(d2)
 = 5.03 * 0.417 - 5.976 * 0.267
 = $0.50
In Table 21.1, the bid and ask prices for this option are $0.45 and $0.55.

Figure 21.4 plots the value of the call option in Example 21.3 as a function of JetBlue’s 
current stock price. Notice how the value of the option always lies above its intrinsic value.
European Put Options.  We can use the Black-Scholes formula to compute the price 
of a European put option on a non-dividend-paying stock by using the put-call parity 
formula we derived in Chapter 20 (see Eq. 20.3). The price of a European put from 
put-call parity is
P = C - S + PV(K )
Substituting for C using the Black-Scholes formula gives
Black-Scholes Price of a European Put Option on a Non-Dividend-Paying Stock
	
P = PV(K )[1 - N(d2)] - S[1 - N(d1)]

Chapter 21  Option Valuation
Figure 21.5 plots the Black-Scholes value of the European put option in Example 21.4 
as a function of JetBlue’s stock price. Recall from Chapter 20 that the time value of deep-
in-the-money European puts can be negative. While the put value does falls below its 
intrinsic value in Figure 21.5, the effect is slight in this case given low current interest rates 
and the relatively short time to expiration of the option.
Dividend-Paying Stocks.  The Black-Scholes formula applies to call options on non-
dividend-paying stocks. However, we can easily adjust the formula for European options 
on dividend-paying stocks.
The holder of a European call option does not receive the benefit of any dividends that 
will be paid prior to the expiration date of the option. Indeed, as we saw in Chapter 17, the 
stock price tends to drop by the amount of the dividend when the stock goes ex-dividend. 
Because the final stock price will be lower, dividends decrease the value of a call option.
Let PV(Div) be the present value of any dividends paid prior to the expiration date of 
the option. Then, a security that is identical to the stock, but that did not pay any of these 
dividends, would have a current market price of
	
Sx = S - PV(Div)
(21.10)
Example 21.4
Valuing a Put Option with the Black-Scholes Formula
Problem
Using the Black-Scholes formula and the data in Table 21.1, compute the price of a January 
2010 $5 put option and compare it to the price in the market. Is the Black-Scholes formula the 
correct way to price these options? (As before, assume that the volatility of JetBlue is 65% per 
year and that the risk-free rate of interest is 1% per year.)
Solution
The contract expires on January 16, 2010, or 176 days from the quote date. The present value of the 
strike price is PV(K ) = 5.00/(1.01)176/365 = $4.976. Calculating d1 and d2 from Eq. 21.8 gives
 d1 = ln[S/PV(K )]

0.652176
365
+
0.652176
365
2
= 0.250
 d2 = d1 - s2T = 0.250 - 0.652176
365 = -0.201
Substituting d1 and d2 into the Black-Scholes formula for a put option, using Eq. 21.9, gives
 P = PV(K )[1 - N(d2)] - S[1 - N(d1)]
 = 4.976 * (1 - 0.420) - 5.03 * (1 - 0.599)
 = $0.87
Given the bid and ask prices of $0.85 and $0.95, respectively, for the option, this estimate is 
within the bid-ask spread. But the Black-Scholes formula for puts is valid for European options, 
and the quotes are for American options. Hence, in this case, the Black-Scholes option price is 
a lower bound on the actual value of the put, as an American put might be exercised early to 
benefit from interest on the strike price. However, given that interest on the $5 strike price is less 
than $0.03, in this case the approximation is a close one.

	
21.2  The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model	
803
The value Sx is the current price of the stock excluding any dividends prior to ­expiration. 
Because a European call option is the right to buy the stock without these dividends, we can 
evaluate it using the Black-Scholes formula with Sx in place of S.
A useful special case is when the stock will pay a dividend that is proportional to its 
stock price at the time the dividend is paid. If q is the stock’s (compounded) dividend yield 
until the expiration date, then6
	
Sx = S/(1 + q)
(21.11)
6To see why, suppose that whenever the dividend is paid, we reinvest it. Then, if we buy 1/(1 + q) shares 
today, at expiration we will own [1/(1 + q)] * (1 + q) = 1 share. Thus, by the Law of One Price, the value 
today of receiving 1 share at expiration is S/(1 + q).

The red curve shows the 
Black-Scholes value of the

­JetBlue’s stock price. The 
circle shows the value at 
­JetBlue’s current price of 
$5.03. The black line is 
the intrinsic value of the 
put. For stock prices below 
$2.25, the European put’s 
value is slightly less than its 
intrinsic value.
Example 21.5
Valuing a Dividend-Paying European Call Option with the  
Black-Scholes Formula
Problem
World Wide Plants will pay an annual dividend yield of 5% on its stock. Plot the value of 
a ­one-year European call option with a strike price of $20 on World Wide Plants stock as a 
­function of the stock price. Assume that the volatility of World Wide Plants stock is 20% per 
year and that the one-year risk-free rate of interest is 4%.
Solution
The price of the call is given by the standard Black-Scholes formula, Eq. 21.7, but with the 
stock price replaced throughout with Sx = S/(1.05). For example, with a stock price of $30, 
Sx = 30/(1.05) = 28.57, PV(K ) = 20/1.04 = 19.23, and

Implied Volatility
Of the five required inputs in the Black-Scholes formula, four are directly observable: 
S, K, T, and the risk-free interest rate. Only one parameter, s, the volatility of the stock 
price, is not directly observable. Practitioners use two strategies to estimate the value of this 
variable. The first, most straightforward approach is to use historical data on daily stock 
returns to estimate the volatility of the stock over the past several months. Because volatil-
ity tends to be persistent, such estimates can provide a reasonable forecast for the stock’s 
volatility in the near future.
The second approach is to use the current market prices of traded options to “back 
out” the volatility that is consistent with these prices based on the Black-Scholes 
­formula. An estimate of a stock’s volatility that is implied by an option’s price is known 
as an implied volatility. The implied volatility from one option can be used to estimate 
the value of other options on the stock with the same expiration date (as well as those 
with different expiration dates if the stock’s volatility is not expected to change over 
time).

	
21.2  The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model	
805
Example 21.6
Computing the Implied Volatility from an Option Price
Problem
Use the price of the March 2010 call on JetBlue with a strike price of $5 in Table 21.1 to 
­calculate the implied volatility for JetBlue from July 2009 to March 2010. Assume the risk-free 
rate of interest is 1% per year.
Solution
The call expires on March 20, 2010, or 239 days after the quote date. The stock price is $5.03, 
and PV(K ) = 5.00/(1.01)239/365 = $4.968. Substituting these values into the Black-Scholes 
­formula, Eq. 21.7, gives
C = 5.03N(d1) - 4.968N(d2)
where
d1 = ln(5.03/4.968)
s2239
365
+
s2239
365
2  and d2 = d1 - s2239
365
We can compute the Black-Scholes option value C for different volatilities using this equation. 
The option value C increases with s, and equals $1.10 (average bid and ask price for the call) 
when s  67%. (You can find this value by trial and error or by using Excel’s Solver tool.) If 
we look at the bid price of $1.05, the implied volatility is about 64%, and at the ask price of 
$1.15, the implied volatility is about 70%. Thus, the 65% volatility we used in Example 21.3 
and Example 21.4 is within the bid-ask spread for the option.

crisis and heightened uncertainty. This effect is illustrated most 
dramatically during the U.S. financial crisis, with the VIX 
nearly quadrupling between September and October 2008, 
to a level almost twice its previous all-time high. The index 
remained at these historically high levels for several months, 
reflecting the unprecedented uncertainty that accompanied 
the financial crisis. As this uncertainty dissipated in mid-2009, 
the index began to drop, reflecting renewed investor confi-
dence. Since then, however, uncertainty in Europe and Asia 
has led to time periods when the VIX again topped 40%.
The use of the Black-Scholes option pricing formula to 
­compute implied volatility has become so ubiquitous that in 
January 1990 the Chicago Board Options Exchange introduced 
the VIX Index, which tracks the one-month implied volatility 
of options written on the S&P 500 index. Quoted in percent 
per annum, this index has since become one of the most-cited 
measures of market volatility. Because it characterizes the level 
of investor uncertainty, it is often referred to as the “fear index.”
As the figure below shows, while the average level of the 
VIX is about 20%, the index does indeed rise during times of

The Replicating Portfolio
Although we introduced the concept of the replicating portfolio in the discussion of the 
Binomial Option Pricing Model, it was actually Fischer Black and Myron Scholes who 
discovered this important insight while deriving their model. To see how the replicating 
portfolio is constructed in the Black-Scholes Model, recall from the Binomial Option Pric-
ing Model that the price of a call option is given by the price of the replicating portfolio, 
as shown in Eq. 21.6:
C = S + B
Comparing this expression to the Black-Scholes formula from Eq. 21.7 gives the shares of 
stock and amount in bonds in the Black-Scholes replicating portfolio:
Black-Scholes Replicating Portfolio of a Call Option
	
  = N(d1)
	
B = -PV(K )N(d2)
(21.12)
Recall that N(d⁜渠) is the cumulative normal distribution function; that is, it has a minimum 
value of 0 and a maximum value of 1. So,  is between 0 and 1, and B is between -K  
and 0. The option delta, , has a natural interpretation: It is the change in the price of 
the option given a $1 change in the price of the stock. Because  is always less than 1, the 
change in the call price is always less than the change in the stock price.
Example 21.7
Computing the Replicating Portfolio
Problem
PNA Systems pays no dividends and has a current stock price of $10 per share. If its returns have 
a volatility of 40% and the risk-free rate is 5%, what portfolio would you hold today to replicate 
a one-year at-the-money call option on the stock?
Solution
We can apply the Black-Scholes formula with S = 10, PV(K ) = 10/1.05 = 9.524, and
 d1 = ln[S/PV(K )]
s2T
+ s2T
2
= ln(10/9.524)
40%
+ 40%
2
= 0.322
 d2 = d1 - s2T = 0.322 - 0.40 = -0.078
From Eq. 21.12, the replicating portfolio for the option is
  = N(d1) = N(0.322) = 0.626
 B = -PV(K )N(d2) = -9.524 * N(-0.078) = -4.47
That is, we should buy 0.626 shares of the PNA stock, and borrow $4.47, for a total cost of 
$10(0.626) - 4.47 = $1.79, which is the Black-Scholes value of the call option.
Figure 21.6 illustrates the replicating portfolio (yellow line) and call option value (red 
curve), as a function of the stock price, for Example 21.7. Because the red curve and 
yellow line are tangent (with slope ) at the initial stock price, the value of the replicat-
ing portfolio will approximate the value of the call option for small changes to the stock 
price. But as the stock price changes, the replicating portfolio will need to be updated to 

	
21.2  The Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model	
807
maintain accuracy. For example, if the stock price increases, the replicating portfolio will 
correspond to a new, steeper tangent line higher on the red curve. Because a steeper line 
corresponds to a higher , to replicate the option it is necessary to buy shares as the stock 
price increases.
This dynamic trading strategy is analogous to the ones we derived earlier for the Bino-
mial Option Pricing Model. In the binomial model, we were able to replicate the payoff of 
an option because we only needed to match two of its payoffs at any time. The great insight 
of Black, Scholes, and Merton was that if we can update our portfolio continuously, we can 
replicate an option on the stock by constantly adjusting our portfolio to remain on a line 
that is tangent to the value of the option.
Notice that the replicating portfolio of a call option always consists of a long position 
in the stock and a short position in the bond; in other words, the replicating portfolio is 
a leveraged position in the stock. Because a leveraged position in a stock is riskier than  
the stock itself, this implies that call options on a positive beta stock are more risky than the 
underlying stock and therefore have higher returns and higher betas.
We can also derive the replicating portfolio for a put option. Comparing the 
­Black-Scholes price of a put from Eq. 21.9 with Eq. 21.6 gives
Black-Scholes Replicating Portfolio of a Put Option
	
  = -[1 - N(d1)]
	
 B = PV(K )[1 - N(d2)]
(21.13)
In this case,  is between -1 and 0, and B is between 0 and K. Thus, the replicating port-
folio of a put option always consists of a long position in the bond and a short position in 
the stock, implying that put options on a positive beta stock will have a negative beta.
Figure 21.6 
Replicating Portfolio 
for the Call Option  
in Example 21.7
The replicating portfolio has 
the same initial value as the 
call option, and the same 
initial sensitivity to the stock 
price (given by ). Because 
the red curve and the yellow 
line are tangent, the value of 
the replicating portfolio will 
approximate the value of the 
call option for small changes 
to the stock price. But to 
maintain accuracy, the rep-
licating portfolio must be 
updated as the stock price 
changes.

3.	 How does the delta of a call option change as the stock price increases?
	
21.3	 Risk-Neutral Probabilities
In both the Binomial and Black-Scholes Pricing Models, we do not need to know the 
probability of each possible future stock price to calculate the option price. But what if we 
did know these probabilities? In that case, we could calculate the price of the option as we 
have done for other financial assets: We could calculate the expected payoff of the option 
and discount it at the appropriate cost of capital. The drawback of this approach is that 
even if we know the probabilities, it is very difficult to estimate the cost of capital for a 
particular asset, and options are no exception. There is, however, one case in which the cost 
of capital can be precisely estimated. If all market participants were risk neutral, then all 
financial assets (including options) would have the same cost of capital—the risk-free rate 
of interest. Let’s consider that scenario and see its implications for option prices.
A Risk-Neutral Two-State Model
Imagine a world consisting of only risk-neutral investors, and consider the two-state exam-
ple in Section 21.1 in the risk-neutral world. Recall that the stock price today is equal to 
$50. In one period it will either go up by $10 or go down by $10, and the one-period risk-
free rate of interest is 6%. Let r be the probability that the stock price will increase, which 
means (1 - r) is the probability that it will go down. The value of the stock today must 
equal the present value of the expected price next period discounted at the risk-free rate:
	
50 = 60r + 40(1 - r)
1.06

(21.14)
This equation is solved with r = 65%. Because we now know the probability of each state, 
we can price the call by calculating the present value of its expected payoff next period. 
Recall that the call option had an exercise price of $50, so it will be worth either $10 or 
nothing at expiration. The present value of the expected payouts is
	
10(0.65) + 0(1 - 0.65)
1.06
= 6.13
(21.15)
This is precisely the value we calculated in Section 21.1 using the Binomial Option Pricing 
Model where we did not assume that investors were risk neutral. It is not a coincidence. 
Because no assumption on the risk preferences of investors is necessary to calculate the 
option price using either the Binomial Model or the Black-Scholes formula, the models 
must work for any set of preferences, including risk-neutral investors.
Implications of the Risk-Neutral World
Let’s take a step back and consider the importance of the conclusion that if we use the 
Binomial Model or Black-Scholes Model to price options, we do not need to make any 
assumption regarding investor risk preferences, the probability of each state, or the stock’s 
expected return. These models give the same option price no matter what the actual risk 

	
21.3  Risk-Neutral Probabilities	
809
preferences and expected stock returns are. To understand how these two settings can be 
­consistent with the same prices for securities, consider the following:
n	 In the real world, investors are risk averse. Thus, the expected return of a typical stock 
includes a positive risk premium to compensate investors for risk.
n	 In the hypothetical risk-neutral world, investors do not require compensation for risk. 
So for the stock price to be the same as in real world, investors must be more pessimistic. 
Thus, stocks that in reality have expected returns above the risk-free rate, when evalu-
ated using these more pessimistic probabilities, have expected returns that equal the 
risk-free rate.
In other words, the r in Eq. 21.14 and Eq. 21.15 is not the actual probability of the stock 
price increasing. Rather, it represents how the actual probability would have to be adjusted 
to keep the stock price the same in a risk-neutral world. For this reason, we refer to r and 
(1 - r) as risk-neutral probabilities. These risk-neutral probabilities are known by other 
names as well: state-contingent prices, state prices, or martingale prices.
To illustrate, suppose the stock considered above, with a current price of $50, will increase 
to $60 with a true probability of 75%, or fall to $40 with a true probability of 25%:
50
60
75%
25%
40
1
0
This stock’s true expected return is therefore
60 * 0.75 + 40 * 0.25
50
- 1 = 10%
Given the risk-free interest rate of 6%, this stock has a 4% risk premium. But as we cal-
culated earlier in Eq. 21.14, the risk-neutral probability that the stock will increase is 
r = 65%, which is less than the true probability. Thus, the expected return of the stock 
in the risk-neutral world is (60 * 0.65 + 40 * 0.35)/50 - 1 = 6% (equal to the risk-free 
rate). To ensure that all assets in the risk-neutral world have an expected return equal to 
the risk-free rate, relative to the true probabilities, the risk-neutral probabilities overweight 
the bad states and underweight the good states.
Risk-Neutral Probabilities and Option Pricing
We can exploit the insight that if the stock price dynamics are the same in the risk-neutral 
and risk-averse worlds, the option prices must be the same, to develop another technique 
for pricing options. Consider again the general binomial stock price tree:
S
Su
Stock
1
0
Option
Sd
Cu
Cd

Chapter 21  Option Valuation
First, we can compute the risk-neutral probability that makes the stock’s expected return 
equal to the risk-free interest rate:
rSu + (1 - r)Sd
S
- 1 = rf
Solving this equation for the risk-neutral probability r we get
	
r =
(1 + rf )S - Sd
Su - Sd

(21.16)
We can then compute the value of the option by computing its expected payoff using the 
risk-neutral probabilities, and discount the expected payoff at the risk-free interest rate.
Example 21.8
Option Pricing with Risk-Neutral Probabilities
Problem
Using Narver Network Systems stock from Example 21.2, imagine all investors are risk neutral 
and calculate the probability of every state in the next two years. Use these probabilities to calcu-
late the price of a two-year call option on Narver Network Systems stock with a strike price $60. 
Then, price a two-year European put option with the same strike price.
Solution
The binomial tree in the three-state example is
First, we use Eq. 21.16 to compute the risk-neutral probability that the stock price will increase. 
At time 0, we have
r =
(1 + rf )S - Sd
Su - Sd
= (1.03)50 - 45
60 - 45
= 0.433
Because the stock has the same returns (up 20% or down 10%) at each date, we can check that 
the risk-neutral probability is the same at each date as well.
Consider the call option with a strike price of $60. This call pays $12 if the stock goes 
up twice, and zero otherwise. The risk-neutral probability that the stock will go up twice is 
0.433 * 0.433, so the call option has an expected payoff of
0.433 * 0.433 * $12 = $2.25
We compute the current price of the call option by discounting this expected payoff at the 
­risk-free rate: C = $2.25/1.032 = $2.12.

21.4  Risk and Return of an Option	
811
As the calculation of the put price in Example 21.8 makes clear, by using the probabili-
ties in the risk-neutral world we can price any derivative security—that is, any security 
whose payoff depends solely on the prices of other marketed assets. After we have con-
structed the tree and calculated the probabilities in the risk-neutral world, we can use them 
to price the derivative by simply discounting its expected payoff (using the risk-neutral 
probabilities) at the risk-free rate.
The risk-neutral pricing method is the basis for a common technique for pricing deriva-
tive securities called Monte Carlo simulation. In this approach, the expected payoff of 
the derivative security is estimated by calculating its average payoff after simulating many 
random paths for the underlying stock price. In the randomization, the risk-neutral prob-
abilities are used, and so the average payoff can be discounted at the risk-free rate to esti-
mate the derivative security’s value.

21.4	 Risk and Return of an Option
To measure the risk of an option, we must compute the option beta. The simplest way to 
do so is to compute the beta of the replicating portfolio. Recall that the beta of a portfolio 
is just the weighted average beta of the constituent securities that make up the portfolio. In 
this case, the portfolio consists of S *  dollars invested in the stock and B dollars invested 
in the bond, so the beta of an option is
boption =
S
S + B
 bS +
B
S + B
 bB
where bS is the stock’s beta and bB is the bond’s beta. In this case the bond is riskless, so 
bB = 0. Thus, the option beta is
Option Beta
	
boption =
S
S + B
 bS
(21.17)
Recall that for a call option,  is greater than zero and B is less than zero. Thus, for a call 
written on a stock with positive beta, the beta of the call always exceeds the beta of the 
stock. For a put option,  is less than zero and B is greater than zero; thus the beta of a 
put option written on a positive beta stock is always negative. This result should not be 
­surprising. A put option is a hedge, so its price goes up when the stock price goes down.
Next, consider the European put option with a strike price of $60. The put ends up in the 
money if the stock goes down twice, if it goes up and then down, or if it goes down and then 
up. Because the risk-neutral probability of a drop in the stock price is 1 - 0.433 = 0.567, the 
expected payoff of the put option is
0.567 * 0.567 * $19.5 + 0.433 * 0.567 * $6 + 0.567 * 0.433 * $6 = $9.21
The value of the put today is therefore P = $9.21/1.032 = $8.68, which is the price we ­calculated 
in Example 21.2.

Solution
From Example 21.3, the December 2009 $6 call option has a value of C = $0.50 and a delta of 
N(d1) = 0.417. Thus, its beta is given by

in the replicating portfolio to the value of the replicating portfolio (or the option price); it 
is known as the option’s leverage ratio. Figure 21.7 shows how the leverage ratio changes 
for puts and calls. As the figure shows, the magnitude of the leverage ratio for options can

be very large, especially for inexpensive out-of-the-money options. Thus, calls and puts on 
a positive beta stock have very large positive and negative betas, respectively. Note also that 
as the stock price changes, the beta of an option will change, with its magnitude falling as 
the option goes in-the-money.
Recall that expected returns and beta are linearly related. Hence, out-of-the-money calls 
have the highest expected returns and out-of-the-money puts have the lowest expected 
returns. The expected returns of different options are plotted on the security market line

21.5	 Corporate Applications of Option Pricing
We close this chapter by developing two corporate applications of option pricing: (1) 
unlevering the beta of equity and calculating the beta of risky debt and (2) deriving the 
­approximation formula to value debt overhang that we introduced in Chapter 16.
Beta of Risky Debt
In Chapter 14, we explained how to calculate the beta of equity from the unlevered beta of 
equity. If we make the common approximation that the beta of debt is zero, then
	
bE = bU + D
E
 (bU - bD)  ¢1 + D
E ≤bU
(21.18)
where bE is the beta of equity and bU is the beta of unlevered equity (or the beta of the 
firm’s assets). However, for companies with high debt-to-equity ratios, the approximation 
that the beta of debt is zero is unrealistic; such corporations have a positive probability of 
bankruptcy, and this uncertainty usually has systematic components.
To derive an expression for the beta of equity when the beta of debt is not zero, recall 
from the discussion in Chapter 20 that equity can be viewed as a call option on the 
Security Market Line 
and Options
The figure shows how the 
expected return of ­different 
options are related.

firm’s assets.7 If we let A be the value of the firm’s assets, E be the value of equity, and D 
be the value of debt, then because equity is a call option on the assets of the firm, we can 
write the value of equity in terms of a replicating portfolio of the firm’s assets and a risk-
free bond,
E = A + B
where the value of the firm’s assets A = E + D is used in place of the stock price S to rep-
resent the underlying asset on which the option is written. Substituting these expressions 
into Eq. 21.17 gives an expression for the beta of equity that does not assume the beta of 
the firm’s debt is zero:
	
bE =
A
A + B
 bU = (E + D)
E
 bU = ¢1 + D
E ≤bU
(21.19)
Note that when the debt is risk free, the firm’s equity is always in-the-money; thus  = 1 
and Eq. 21.19 reduces to Eq. 21.18.
We can derive the beta of debt in a similar fashion. Debt, D, is equal to a portfolio 
consisting of a long position in the assets of the firm and a short position in its equity; i.e., 
D = A - E. The beta of debt is therefore the weighted-average beta of this portfolio:
bD = A
D
 bU - E
D
 bE
Using Eq. 21.19 and simplifying gives an expression for the beta of debt in terms of the 
beta of assets:
	
bD = (1 - ) A
D
 bU = (1 - )¢1 + E
D≤bU
(21.20)
Again, when the debt is riskless,  = 1 and bD = 0, the assumption we made in 
Eq. 21.18.
Figure 21.9 plots an example of the beta of debt and equity as a function of the firm’s 
leverage using Eq. 21.12. For low levels of debt, the approximation that the beta of debt is 
zero works reasonably well. As the debt-to-equity ratio becomes larger, however, the beta 
of debt begins to rise above zero and the beta of equity no longer increases proportionally 
with the debt-equity ratio.
In most applications, the beta of equity can be estimated. Using the beta of equity, we 
can calculate the beta of debt and the unlevered beta. For example, to unlever the beta, we 
can solve Eq. 21.19 for bU :
	
bU =

porate Debt: The Risk Structure of Interest Rates,” Journal of Finance 29 (1974): 449–470.

Computing the Beta of Debt
Problem
You would like to know the beta of debt for BB Industries. The value of BB’s outstanding equity 
is $40 million, and you have estimated its beta to be 1.2. However, you cannot find enough 
market data to estimate the beta of its debt, so you decide to use the Black-Scholes formula to 
find an approximate value for the debt beta. BB has four-year zero-coupon debt outstanding 
with a face value of $100 million that currently trades for $75 million. BB pays no dividends 
and reinvests all of its earnings. The four-year risk-free rate of interest is currently 5.13%. What 
is the beta of BB’s debt?
Solution
We can interpret BB’s equity as a four-year call option on the firm’s assets with a strike price of 
$100 million. The present value of the strike price is $100 million/(1.0513)4 = $81.86 million. 
The current market value of BB’s assets is $40 + 75 = $115 million. Therefore, the implied 
volatility of BB’s assets is equal to the implied volatility of a call option whose price is 40 when 
the stock price is 115 and the present value of the strike price is 81.86. Using trial and error, we 
find an implied volatility of about 25%. With this volatility, the delta of the call option is
 = N(d1) = N ¢ ln(115/81.86)

Chapter 21  Option Valuation
Valuing Employee Stock Options
In the last 20 years, it has become common practice to 
compensate executives by granting them executive stock 
options (ESOs)—call options on their company’s stock. 
Until 2005, U.S. accounting standards did not require 
firms to include stock option grants as part of their com-
pensation expense. Now, however, firms are required to 
expense these options when calculating their earnings. 
Regardless of the accounting requirement, both firms and 
employees would like to know the value of this compensa-
tion. While it is tempting to use the Black-Scholes formula 
to value an ESO, there are several important pitfalls to be 
aware of when doing so.
To understand the difficulties of using the Black-
Scholes formula to value ESOs, it is important to appre-
ciate how they are usually granted. ESOs are typically 
American-style options with exercise dates up to 10 
years in the future. However, there is usually a vesting 
period (often as long as four years) during which the 
employee does not actually own the option. Instead, he 
or she owns a right to the option at the end of the vest-
ing period. If the employee leaves the firm during this 
period, the individual forfeits this right and so does not 
get the option. Once the vesting period has passed, the 
employee owns the option but it is not tradable—the 
only way the employee can liquidate the option is by 
exercising it. Furthermore, most executives face restric-
tions in trading their own company stock, so they effec-
tively cannot construct a replicating portfolio. Because of 
these restrictions, ESOs are not worth the same amount 
to the employee and the firm.
One obvious difficulty with applying the Black-­Scholes 
formula to such options is that the formula requires an 
estimate of the volatility of the stock over the life of 
the option. Forecasting volatility up to 10 years in the 
future is extremely difficult. But even if the stock’s vola-
tility were known, the Black-Scholes formula does not 
account for the following important differences between 
ESOs and ordinary stock options:
	
1.	 ESOs are dilutive.  When exercised, they increase 
the number of shares outstanding of the firm.
	
2.	 ESOs may be forfeited.  If the employee leaves the 
firm, options that are not vested are immediately 
forfeited. Options already vested are forfeited if not 
exercised within three months of the employee’s 
departure.
	
3.	 ESOs may be exercised early.  Once vested, the 
employee can exercise the options at any time.
Unless the number of options is large relative to the 
total number of shares outstanding, the first difference is 
not that important. The second difference is important 
for employees and firms with high employee turnover.
The third difference is very important for employees 
and all firms. Employees are risk-averse, but are not per-
mitted to hedge the risk of the option by trading the rep-
licating portfolio. As a consequence, the employee’s 
preferences and beliefs matter in computing the ESO’s 
value: A more risk-averse or pessimistic employee will 
attach a lower value to the option than a less risk-averse 
or optimistic employee. Furthermore, the only way an 
employee can eliminate his or her risk from the option is 
to exercise it and sell the stock. Hence, most employees 
choose to exercise early.* In this case, employees are forfeit-
ing the (often substantial) remaining time value of their 
options in exchange for a reduction in their risk.
Thus, the Black-Scholes formula (which assumes 
no early exercise) overestimates the cost of the option 
to the firm and its benefit to the employee. Because the 
firm can hedge its option liabilities, risk is not an issue 
when evaluating the cost of the option to the firm. Thus, 
the Black-Scholes formula overstates the cost by not 
accounting for forfeitures and early exercise. Because the 
employee cannot sell or hedge the risk of the option, the 
Black-Scholes formula overstates the value of the option 
to the employee even further by not accounting for the 
personal cost of bearing risk.
How important are these differences? The answer 
appears to be very important. In a recent paper, Ashish 
Jain and Ajay Subramanian adjust for these differences 
and find that for reasonable parameter values, the Black-
Scholes formula can overestimate the cost to the firm of a 
vested five-year option by as much as 40%.† And once 
one considers the personal cost of being under-­diversified 
while holding the option, its value to the employee can 
be as low as one third of the cost of the option to the 
firm. To account for these discrepancies, researchers have 
developed methods based on the binomial model in Sec-
tion 21.1, that incorporate the probability and effect of 
forfeiture and early exercise directly into the binomial 
tree (see Further Readings).

Agency Costs of Debt
In Chapter 16 we noted that leverage can distort equity holders’ incentives to invest. These 
distortions can be readily understood when we view equity as a call option on the firm’s 
assets. First, leverage creates an asset substitution problem because the value of the equity 
call option increases with the firm’s volatility. Thus, equity holders may have an incentive 
to take excessive risk. Second, because  6 1 for a call option, equity holders gain less than 
$1 for each $1 increase in the value of the firm’s assets, reducing their incentive to invest 
and leading to a debt overhang or underinvestment problem. Example 21.11 illustrates 
how we can use the methods of this chapter to quantify both of these effects.
Example 21.11
Evaluating Potential Agency Costs
Problem
Consider BB Industries from Example 21.10. Suppose BB can embark on a risky strategy that 
would increase the volatility of BB’s assets from 25% to 35%. Show that shareholders benefit 
from this risky strategy even if it has an NPV of -$5 million. Alternatively, suppose BB tries to 
raise $100,000 from shareholders to invest in a new positive NPV project that does not change 
the firm’s risk. What minimum NPV is required for this investment to benefit shareholders?
Solution
Recall that we can interpret BB’s equity as a four-year call option on the firm’s assets with a strike 
price of $100 million. Given the current risk-free rate of 5.13%, asset value of $115 million, and 
asset volatility of 25%, the current value of the equity call option is $40 million, with  = 0.824.
If BB follows the risky strategy, the value of its assets will fall to $115 - 5 = $110 million, 
and the volatility of the assets will increase to 35%. Applying the Black-Scholes formula with 
these new parameters, we find the value of the equity call option would increase to $42.5 million, 
or a $2.5 million gain for equity holders. Thus, leverage may cause equity holders to support 
risky negative NPV decisions.
Second, suppose BB raises and invests I = $100,000 in a new project with NPV = V. Then 
the value of the firm’s assets will increase by $100,000 + V. Because  represents the sensitivity 
of a call option to the underlying asset value, the value of equity will increase by approximately 
 times this amount, and so equity holders gain more than they invest if

NOBEL PRIZE
In a modern market economy, it is essential that firms and 
households are able to select an appropriate level of risk in 
their transactions. Markets for options and other so-called 
derivatives are important in the sense that agents who antici-
pate future revenues or payments can ensure a profit above a 
certain level or insure themselves against a loss above a certain 
level. A prerequisite for efficient management of risk, however, 
is that such instruments are correctly valued, or priced. A new 
method to determine the value of derivatives stands out among 
the foremost contributions to economic sciences over the last 
25 years.
This year’s laureates, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, 
developed this method in close collaboration with Fischer 
Black, who died in his mid-fifties in 1995. Black, Merton, and  
Scholes thus laid the foundation for the rapid growth of  
markets for derivatives in the last ten years. Their method has 
more general applicability, however, and has created new areas 
of research—inside as well as outside of financial economics. A 
similar method may be used to value insurance contracts and 
guarantees, or the flexibility of physical investment projects.

Thus, option pricing methods can be used to assess potential investment distortions that 
might arise due to debt overhang, or the incentive for asset substitution and risk-taking. 
We can also use these methods to evaluate state-contingent costs, such as financial distress 
costs.
In the above cases, management’s and equity holders’ option to default imposes costs on 
the firm. But in many situations, having “options” when investing can be a good thing, and 
enhance the value of the firm. We explore these situations in the next chapter.

benefits shareholders only if its profitability index exceeds (0.14 * 75)/(1.2 * 40) = 0.21875, so 
that the project’s NPV must exceed $21,875. Because equity holders may reject projects with a 
positive NPV below this amount, the debt overhang induced by leverage may cause the firm to 
underinvest.

real Options
the MOSt IMpOrtaNt appLICatION OF OptIONS IN corporate 
finance is in the capital budgeting decision. Let’s use Amgen, a global biotechnology 
company, as an example. Amgen had 2014 revenues of $20 billion, and it spent over 
20% of its revenues on research and development. Even though only a very small num-
ber of early-stage drug development projects ultimately reach the market, the ones that 
do can be highly successful. How does Amgen manage its research and development 
expenses to maximize value?
For Amgen, investing in R&D is like purchasing a call option. When research results on 
early-stage drug development projects are favorable, Amgen commits additional resources to 
the next stage of product development. If research results are not promising, Amgen stops 
funding the project. Amgen, by selectively investing in those technologies that prove to be 
the most promising, exercises its option to develop a product: The additional investment 
is equivalent to paying the strike price and acquiring the underlying asset—in this case, 
the benefits of further product development. By choosing not to make further investments 
(thereby mothballing or abandoning the research and development project) Amgen chooses 
not to exercise its option.
While real investment options like Amgen’s can be very important in capital budget-
ing, the effect of such real options on the capital budgeting decision is generally appli-
cation specific, and no single methodology exists that applies across all settings. In light 
of this fact, in this chapter we show how the general principles we have already developed 
that govern capital budgeting and option pricing can be applied to evaluate real options 
in the capital budgeting decision. We apply these principles to examine the three most 
common options that occur in capital budgeting: the option to wait for the optimal time 
to invest, the option to grow in the future, and the option to abandon a poorly perform-
ing project. We then consider two important applications: deciding the order in which to 
complete a staged investment opportunity and deciding which of two mutually exclusive 
projects of different lengths is the wiser investment. Finally, we explain rules of thumb 
that managers often use to account for real options in the capital budgeting decision.

Chapter 22  Real Options
	
22.1	 Real Versus Financial Options
The financial options we have studied in the previous two chapters give their holders the 
right to buy, or sell, a traded asset such as a stock. Amgen’s option to invest in research 
and development for new products is an example of a different type of option, called a real 
option. A real option is the right to make a particular business decision, such as a capital 
investment, after new information may be learned. A key distinction between a real option 
and a financial option is that real options, and the underlying assets on which they are 
based, are often not traded in competitive markets; for example, there is no market for 
Amgen’s R&D in a particular drug.
Despite this distinction, many of the principles that we developed in the last two chapters for 
financial options also apply to real options. In particular, because real options allow a decision 
maker to choose the most attractive alternative after new information becomes available, the 
presence of real options adds value to an investment opportunity. This value can be substantial, 
especially in environments with a great deal of uncertainty. Thus, to make the most accurate 
investment decisions, the value of these options must be included in the decision-making process.
Our approach to capital budgeting thus far has focused on the initial investment deci-
sion without explicitly considering future decisions that may be required over the life of 
a project. Rather, we assumed that our forecast of the project’s expected future cash flows 
already incorporated the effect of any future decisions made. In this chapter, we take a 
closer look at how these cash flows, and therefore the NPV of a project, are determined 
when a firm must react to changing business conditions over the life of a project. To do so, 
we begin by introducing a new analytical tool called a decision tree.

22.2	 Decision Tree Analysis
Most investment projects allow for the possibility of reevaluating the decision to invest at a 
later point in time. Let’s illustrate this possibility with a natural example.
United Studios holds the movie rights for a national best-seller, and as part of these 
rights also has the option to produce a sequel based on the same book. The studio is now 
in the process of developing the production schedule. It believes that shooting both movies 
simultaneously would allow significant cost savings, and both movies could be produced 
for a total budget of $525 million. If instead the movies are produced sequentially, the 
total expected cost will rise to $575 million. On the other hand, by waiting to produce the 
second movie until after the first movie is released, the studio will have much better infor-
mation regarding the likely prospects for the sequel. Let’s see how we can use a decision tree 
to analyze this situation.
First consider the case in which the movies are produced simultaneously. Once pro-
duced, the studio forecasts it will earn a total of $650 million from both movies, for a net 
profit of $125 million.1 We illustrate this simple scenario in Figure 22.1 using a decision 
tree, a graphical representation that shows current and future decisions and their corre-
sponding risks and outcomes over time.
1For simplicity, we ignore discounting in this example by assuming a zero interest rate and only idiosyn-
cratic risk. (Alternatively, we can interpret all amounts as their equivalent present values.) In later examples 
we will incorporate discounting and systematic risk.

	
22.2  Decision Tree Analysis	
827
A decision tree differs from the binomial trees used in Chapter 21. In a binomial tree, 
the branches of the tree represent uncertainty that cannot be controlled. In a decision tree, 
we also include branches to represent different choices available to the decision maker.
The decision tree in Figure 22.1 is the decision tree for a standard investment problem 
without real options. We can either invest, and earn the project’s NPV, or not invest and 
earn 0. The square node indicates a decision point, where the decision maker must choose 
which branch to follow. We highlight the optimal decision in blue; in this case United 
­Studios would choose to invest and produce the movies since the expected payoff exceeds 
the upfront cost: $650 million - $525 million = $125 million.
Representing Uncertainty
While United’s expected earnings imply that the movies are worth producing, there is 
significant uncertainty regarding the actual outcome. In fact, the expected total revenue of 
$650 million for both movies reflects two alternative outcomes. Based on the popularity of 
the book, United believes there is a 50% chance the first movie will be a blockbuster suc-
cess, in which case the studio expects it will earn $500 million from it alone, and another 
$400 million for the sequel. If instead the first film is just a moderate hit, it will only bring 
in $300 million, and the sequel will only be expected to earn $100 million. We illustrate 
this uncertainty in Figure 22.2.
Notice that the decision tree now contains two kinds of nodes: square decision nodes 
(invest versus do nothing), and circular information nodes in which uncertainty is resolved 
that is out of the control of the decision maker (e.g., whether the film is a blockbuster or 
not). Figure 22.2 also indicates the point at which each cash flow is committed or realized. 
Because the production cost is paid in advance, that cash flow is incurred before United 
learns how successful the movies will be.

Chapter 22  Real Options
Real Options
The decision tree in Figure 22.2 is not a full description of United’s alternatives. Instead of 
producing the movies simultaneously, United can delay filming the sequel until after the 
first movie is released.
United’s budget for the first film is $300 million. If it is only a moderate hit, they expect 
to produce the sequel for $250 million. But if the first film is a blockbuster, the cost of the 
second film will increase to $300 million (it will be worth investing more, and the actors 
may demand higher wages). Overall, the expected total cost of producing the films sequen-
tially is $575 million, an increase of $50 million over the cost of filming them together.
We illustrate the decision tree for sequential production in Figure 22.3. The key difference 
between this figure and Figure 22.2 is that we now illustrate the fact that United can wait 
until it learns how successful the first movie is before deciding whether to produce the sequel. 
A decision node that occurs after an information node in a decision tree is a real option. The 
option to decide later is valuable because of the new information United will learn.
As Figure 22.3 reveals, it is not optimal for United to produce the sequel unless the first 
film is a blockbuster. Producing the sequel after a moderate success would cost $250 million 
and earn only $100 million. Producing the sequel at that point has a negative NPV of –$150 
million. Given United’s optimal strategy (shown in blue), its expected payoff is as follows:
-
  300 + 50% * (500 - 300 + 400) + 50% * (300) = $150 million
Comparing this payoff to the expected payoff of $125 million if the movies are produced 
simultaneously, the option to wait and decide later whether to produce the sequel is worth 
$25 million to United. The option is valuable because United will learn enough informa-
tion to affect its decision: it will cancel the sequel if the first film is not a blockbuster. The 
option value is equal to the benefit of avoiding a 50% chance of a loss of $150 million, or 
$75 million, which exceeds the $50 million increase in expected production costs.
Solving Decision Trees
Many corporate investment decisions contain real options like the one facing United Stu-
dios. While the exact nature of these options is investment specific, they can be analyzed by 
creating a decision tree that identifies
n	 Decision nodes showing the choices available at each stage
n	 Information nodes showing the payoff relevant information to be learned
n	 Investments made and payoffs earned over time

22.3  The Option to Delay: Investment as a Call Option	
829
Once the decision tree is created, we can value the investment opportunity by working 
backward from the end of the tree. At each
	
	(i)	 Decision node: determine the optimal choice by comparing the present value of 
the remaining payoffs along each branch; and at each
	
	(ii)	 Information node: compute the expected present value of the payoffs from the 
subsequent branches.
As always, in both Steps (i) and (ii), we compute present values according to the Law of 
One Price (using the methodologies developed in earlier chapters).
While our example here was highly simplified, with only two states and two choices, the 
decision tree methodology is quite general and is used in practice to analyze highly complex 
real world examples. We’ll consider a variety of real options in the remainder of this chapter.

22.3	 The Option to Delay: Investment as a Call Option
United Studios’ option to produce a movie sequel illustrates how choosing the optimal 
time to make an investment can add value. This option to delay is common in practice. 
Typically, there are costs from delaying the investment decision: interim profits from the 
project are lost, costs might rise, competitors may enter, etc. On the other hand, by delay-
ing you will gain additional information regarding the value of the investment. In general, 
one must trade off the costs from delay with the benefit from gaining information before 
making a decision. In this section we see how the quantitative methods developed to price 
financial options can be used to analyze the optimal timing decision.
An Investment Option
Consider the following investment opportunity. You have negotiated a deal with a major 
electric car manufacturer to open a dealership in your hometown. The terms of the con-
tract specify that you must open the dealership either immediately or in exactly one year. 
If you do neither, you lose the right to open the dealership at all. Figure 22.4 shows these 
choices on a decision tree.

Chapter 22  Real Options
You are wondering how much you should pay for this opportunity. It will cost you $5 
million to open the dealership, whether you open it now or in one year. If you open the 
dealership immediately, you expect it to generate $600,000 in free cash flow the first year. 
While future cash flows will vary with consumer tastes and the state of the economy, on 
average these cash flows are expected to grow at a rate of 2% per year. The appropriate cost 
of capital for this investment is 12%, so you estimate that the value of the dealership, if it 
were open today, would be
	
V = $600,000
12% - 2% = $6 million
(22.1)
You also double-check this value using comparables. A publicly traded firm operating deal-
erships elsewhere in the state exists, and this firm provides an essentially perfect compa-
rable for your investment. This firm has an enterprise value equal to 10 times its free cash 
flow, leading to an equivalent valuation.
Thus, the NPV of opening the dealership immediately is $1 million, implying that the 
contract is worth at least $1 million. But given the flexibility you have to delay opening for 
one year, should you be willing to pay more? And when should you open the dealership?
To answer these questions, we start at the end of the tree and evaluate the NPV of opening 
the dealership in one year. If we wait, then one year from now we will have the choice to invest 
$5 million to open the dealership, or lose our right to open it and receive nothing. Thus, at 
that time, the decision is easy—we will open the dealership if its value at that time, based on 
any new information about the economy and consumer tastes and trends, is above $5 million. 
But because trends in this industry can change quickly, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to 
what the expected cash flows and the value of the dealership will be at that time.
Next, to compute the present value at the information node, we can use the Law of One 
Price. Our payoff if we delay is equivalent to the payoff of a one-year European call option 
on the dealership with a strike price of $5 million. Because the final payoff in one year is 
equivalent to a call option, we can use the techniques from Chapter 21 to value it. Sup-
pose that the risk-free interest rate is 5%. We can estimate the volatility of the value of the 
dealership by looking at the return volatility of the publicly traded comparable firm; sup-
pose this volatility is 40%. Finally, if we wait to open the dealership we will lose out on the 
$600,000 in free cash flow we would have earned in the first year. In terms of a financial 
option, this free cash flow is equivalent to a dividend paid by a stock—the holder of a call 
option does not receive the dividend until the option is exercised. Let’s assume for now this 
cost is the only cost of delay—there are no additional costs in terms of lost growth of the 
dealership’s cash flows, for example.
Table 22.1 shows how we can reinterpret the parameters for the Black-Scholes formula 
for financial options to evaluate this real option to invest in the dealership. To apply the 
Black-Scholes formula, recall from Eq. 21.10 that we must compute the current value of 
the asset without the dividends that will be missed:
S x = S - PV(Div) = $6 million - $0.6 million
1.12
= $5.46 million
Note that we compute the present value of the lost cash flow using the project’s cost of 
capital of 12%. Next, we need to compute the present value of the cost to open the dealer-
ship in one year. Because this cash flow is certain, we discount it at the risk-free rate:
PV(K ) = $5 million
1.05
= $4.76 million

	
22.3  The Option to Delay: Investment as a Call Option	
831
Now we can compute the value of the call option to open the dealership using Eq. 21.7 
and Eq. 21.8:
 d1 = ln[Sx/PV(K )]
s2T
+ s2T
2
= ln(5.46/4.76)
0.40
+ 0.20 = 0.543
 d2 = d1 - s2T = 0.543 - 0.40 = 0.143
and therefore,
 C = SxN(d1) - PV(K )N(d2)
	
 = ($5.46 million) * (0.706) - ($4.76 million) * (0.557)
	
 = $1.20 million

(22.2)
The result in Eq. 22.2 states that the value today from waiting to invest in the dealer-
ship next year, and only opening it if it is profitable to do so, is $1.20 million. This value 
exceeds the NPV of $1 million from opening the dealership today. Thus, we are better off 
waiting to invest, and the value of the contract is $1.20 million.
What is the advantage of waiting in this case? If we wait, we will learn more about 
the likely success of the business by observing the performance of the comparable firm. 
Because our investment in the dealership is not yet committed, we can cancel our plans if 
the popularity of electric cars should decline. By opening the dealership today, we give up 
this option to “walk away.”2
Of course, there is a trade-off—if we wait to invest we give up the profits the dealer-
ship will generate the first year. Whether it is optimal to invest today will depend on the 
magnitude of these lost profits, compared to the benefit of preserving our right to change 
our decision. To see this trade-off, suppose instead that the first-year free cash flow of 
the dealership is projected to be $700,000, so that the current value of the dealership is 
$7 ­million (using the 10x multiple of the comparable, or a similar calculation to Eq. 22.1). 
In this case, the same analysis shows that the value of the call option would be $1.91 mil-
lion. Because the value of opening the dealership today is $7 million - 5 million = $2 
million, in this case it would not be optimal to wait, and we would open the dealership 
immediately.
2A second benefit from waiting is that the cost of opening the dealership is assumed to stay the same 
($5 million), so the present value of this cost declines if we wait. This benefit is specific to the example. 
Depending on the scenario, the cost of investing may rise or fall over time.

Figure 22.5 plots the NPV of investing today and the value of waiting as we vary the 
expected first-year free cash flow of the dealership, and thus its current operating value. 
As the figure makes clear, you should invest today (and give up the option to wait) only 
if the current value of the dealership exceeds $6.66 million. Thus, your optimal invest-
ment strategy is to invest today only if the NPV of the investment opportunity exceeds 
$6.66 million - 5 million = $1.66 million.

Why Are There Empty Lots in Built-Up Areas of Big Cities?
Have you ever wondered why there are empty lots (for 
example, a parking lot) right next to multi-story buildings in 
a city? After all, if it was optimal for the next-door neighbor 
to build a multi-story building, why would someone choose 
to leave the lot empty? In many cases, the property taxes 
exceed the revenue generated by the empty lot, so by putting 
a revenue-producing building on the lot, the owner could 
turn a negative cash flow into a positive cash flow. However, 
by building on the lot, the owner gives up the option to 
construct a different building in the future. If there is a large 
amount of uncertainty about the kind of building to put on 
the lot, and if this uncertainty might be resolved in the 
future, it might make sense to wait for additional informa-
tion before breaking ground on a building. The value of 
waiting might exceed the net present value of building 
today.*
Notice a similar effect in the price of agricultural land 
that is close to big cities. Even though the land might pro-
duce the same agricultural revenue as similar land 100 miles 
away, the price of the land closer to the city is higher because 
the price reflects the possibility that the city might grow 
to the point that it becomes economical to put the land to 
non-agricultural use—that is, subdivide it and build single-
family housing. The option to one day use the land in this 
way is reflected in the current price of the land.
*S. Titman, “Urban Land Prices Under Uncertainty,” American Eco-
nomic Review 75 (1985): 505–514, develops this idea.

	
22.3  The Option to Delay: Investment as a Call Option

Example 22.1
Evaluating the Decision to Wait
Problem
Suppose your current estimate of the electric car dealership’s value is $6 million. What would 
be the value of the dealership contract if the volatility of the dealership’s value were 25% rather 
than 40%? Alternatively, suppose the volatility is 40%, but waiting would lead competitors to 
expand and reduce the future free cash flows of the dealership by 10%. What is the value of the 
contract in this case?
Factors Affecting the Timing of Investment
This example illustrates how the real option to wait affects the capital budgeting decision. 
Without the option of when to invest, it is optimal to invest as long as NPV 7 0. But when 
you have the option of deciding when to invest, it is usually optimal to invest only when the 
NPV is substantially greater than zero.
To understand this result, think of the timing decision as a choice between two ­mutually 
exclusive projects: (1) invest today or (2) wait. Faced with mutually exclusive choices, we 
should choose the project with the higher NPV. That is, we should invest today only if the 
NPV of investing today exceeds the value of the option of waiting. If we can always walk 
away from the project, the option of waiting will be positive, so the NPV of investing today 
must be even higher for us to choose not to wait.
An interesting aspect of the dealership investment opportunity is the value of the deal 
when the ongoing value of a dealership is less than $5 million. In this case, the NPV of 
opening a dealership is negative, so without the option to wait the investment opportunity 
is worthless. But from Figure 22.5 we see that, with the option to wait, the investment 
opportunity is clearly not worthless. Even if the current value of an electric car dealership 
is $4 million (which means the NPV of investing today is -$1 million), the value of the 
opportunity is still worth about $248,000. That is, you would still be willing to pay up to 
$248,000 to sign the deal. Thus, given the option to wait, an investment that currently has a 
negative NPV can have a positive value.
Aside from the current NPV of the investment, what other factors affect the value of an 
investment and the decision to wait? From Figure 22.5 we can see that factors that increase 
the value of the call option will increase the benefit of waiting. Recall from our study of 
financial options in Chapters 20 and 21 that both the volatility and the dividends of the 
stock affect the value of a call option and the optimal time to exercise the call. These factors 
have their counterparts for real options:
n	 Volatility⁜:  By delaying an investment, we can base our decision on additional infor-
mation. The option to wait is most valuable when there is a great deal of uncertainty 
regarding what the value of the investment will be in the future. If there is little uncer-
tainty, the benefit of waiting is diminished.
n	 Dividends⁜:  Recall that absent dividends, it is not optimal to exercise a call option early. 
In the real option context, the dividends correspond to any value from the investment 
that we give up by waiting. It is always better to wait unless there is a cost to doing so. 
The greater the cost, the less attractive the option to delay becomes.

Chapter 22  Real Options
Investment Options and Firm Risk
Imagine that you formed a corporation and, acting on behalf of this corporation, you 
signed the electric car dealership contract. If the corporation has no other assets, what is the 
value of the corporation and how risky is it?
We have already calculated the value of the contract as a real option. Indeed, when the 
value of an operating dealership is $6 million, the contract—and thus your firm—is worth 
$1.2 million. To assess risk, you note that electric car dealerships are very sensitive to the 
economy and have a beta of about 2. Your firm, however, will not begin operating the 
Solution
With a lower volatility of 25%, we have
 d1 = ln[Sx/PV(K )]
s2T
+ s2T
2
= ln(5.46/4.76)
0.25
+ 0.125 = 0.674
 d2 = d1 - s2T = 0.674 - 0.25 = 0.424
The value of the call option is
 C = SxN(d1) - PV(K )N(d2)
 = ($5.46 million) * (0.750) - ($4.76 million) * (0.664)
 = $0.93 million
Therefore, it is better to invest immediately and get an NPV of $1 million, rather than wait. 
With the lower volatility, not enough information will be learned over the next year to justify the 
cost of waiting.
Now let’s suppose the volatility is 40%, but waiting leads to increased competition. In this 
case, we should deduct the loss from increased competition as an additional “dividend” that we 
forego by waiting. Thus,
 Sx = S - PV(First@Year FCF) - PV(Lost FCF from Competition)
 = ¢$6 million - $0.6 million
1.12
≤* (1 - 0.10) = $4.92 million
Now,
 d1 = ln[Sx/PV(K )]
s2T
+ s2T
2
= ln(4.92/4.76)
0.40
+ 0.20 = 0.283
 d2 = d1 - s2T = 0.283 - 0.40 = 0.117
The value of the call option in this case is
 C = SxN(d1) - PV(K )N(d2)
 = ($4.92 million) * (0.611) - ($4.76 million) * (0.453)
 = $0.85 million
Again, it would not be optimal to wait. In this case, despite the information to be gained, the 
costs associated with waiting are too high.

dealership immediately; instead, it will wait until next year to decide whether to invest. The 
beta of your firm will therefore equal the beta of the option on a dealership, which we can 
calculate using the Black-Scholes formula and Equation 21.17 from the last chapter. Given 
the $6 million value of the operating dealership, and using the values from Eq. 22.2, the 
beta of the option to open the dealership—and therefore the beta of the corporation—is
bcorp = Sx*N(d1)
C
 bdealer = ($5.46 million)*(0.706)
$1.2 million
 bdealer = 3.2 * bdealer = 6.4
Notice that the beta of a corporation with the option to open a dealership (that is, 6.4) 
is considerably larger than the beta of a dealership itself (2.0). Moreover, the beta of the 
corporation will fluctuate with the value of the option, and it will only be equal to the beta 
of a dealership if it is optimal to open the dealership immediately.
As this example shows, when comparing firms in the same industry, betas may vary 
depending upon the firms’ growth opportunities. All else equal, firms for which a higher 
fraction of their value depends on future growth will tend to have higher betas.3
The fact that the beta of the firm includes the beta of the firm’s growth options has impli-
cations for capital budgeting. Because the beta of growth options tend to be higher than the 
beta of the firm’s investments in place, the beta of the firm typically overstates the beta of its 
existing assets. Hence, when financial analysts estimate an individual project beta by using the 
beta of a firm with substantial growth options, they may be overestimating the project beta.4

Uncertainty, Investment, and the Option to Delay
buy troubled assets and effectively signal the government’s 
intention to stabilize markets. By stabilizing markets and 
reducing uncertainty, it was hoped that TARP would help 
stimulate investment.
Unfortunately, however, TARP failed in its primary 
mission to decrease uncertainty. Indeed, concerns about 
whether the program would be implemented and how it 
would be implemented contributed significantly to overall 
uncertainty in the economy, making the option to delay 
investment until the uncertainty was resolved more valu-
able. In the end, the combination of this increased uncer-
tainty together with a gloomy economic forecast led to a 
19.1% decline in business investment in the fourth quarter 
of 2008, the largest decline since 1975.
In mid-September 2008, with the markets for investment 
capital frozen, the Treasury announced an unprecedented 
program to help unfreeze credit markets and stave off a deep 
recession. The well-founded worry was that the dysfunc-
tional financial markets would effectively cut off business 
activity and thus precipitate a crash in the real economy. 
Despite the passage of a $750 billion relief program (the 
Troubled Asset Relief Program—TARP), the economy 
plunged into the deepest recession since the Great Depres-
sion. What went wrong?
One likely factor was lawmakers’ insensitivity to the 
effect of uncertainty on the real option to delay invest-
ment. The original idea behind TARP was to reduce 
uncertainty by making a huge capital commitment to 
Global Financial Crisis

Chapter 22  Real Options
	
22.4	 Growth and Abandonment Options
When a firm has a real option to invest in the future, as in the dealership example, it is 
known as a growth option. In other situations, the firm may have the option to reduce the 
scale of its investment in the future; the option to disinvest is known as an abandonment 
option. Because these options have value, they contribute to the value of any firm with 
future possible investment opportunities.
Valuing Growth Potential
Future growth opportunities can be thought of as a collection of real call options on poten-
tial projects. Out-of-the-money calls are riskier than in-the-money calls, and because most 
growth options are likely to be out-of-the-money, the growth component of firm value is 
likely to be riskier than the ongoing assets of the firm. This observation might explain why 
young firms (and small firms) have higher returns than older, established firms. It also 
explains why R&D-intensive firms often have higher expected returns even when much of 
the R&D risk is idiosyncratic.5
In the dealership example, the main source of uncertainty was the investment’s expected 
cash flows. Let’s consider a second example of a growth option in which the uncertainty is 
instead about the investment’s cost of capital. In this case, we will also illustrate how to value 
the option using the technique of risk-neutral probabilities introduced in Chapter 21.6
StartUp Incorporated is a new company whose only asset is a patent on a new drug. If 
produced, the drug will generate certain profits of $1 million per year for the life of the 
patent, which is 17 years (after that, competition will drive profits to zero). It will cost $10 
million today to produce the drug. Assume that the yield on a 17-year risk-free annuity is 
currently 8% per year. What is the value of the patent?
Using the formula for the present value of an annuity, the NPV of investing today in 
the drug is
NPV =
1
0.08
 ¢1 -
1
1.0817 ≤- 10 = -$878,362
Based on this calculation, it does not make sense to invest in the drug today. But what if inter-
est rates change? Let’s assume that interest rates will change in exactly one year. At that time, 
all risk-free interest rates will be either 10% per year or 5% per year, and then will remain at 
that level forever. Clearly, an increase in interest rates will make matters worse. Because interest 
rates will remain at the new higher level forever, it will never be optimal to invest. Thus, the 
value of this growth option is zero in that state. However, if rates drop, the NPV of undertak-
ing the investment, given that the patent will have a remaining life of 16 years, is
NPV =
1
0.05
 ¢1 -
1
1.0516 ≤- 10 = $837,770
In this case, it is optimal to invest. We can put this information on a decision tree, as 
shown in Figure 22.6.

sult J. Berk, R. Green, and V. Naik, “The Valuation and Return Dynamics of New Ventures,” Review of 
Financial Studies 17 (2004): 1–35.
6Using risk-neutral probabilities in a decision tree is more general than Black-Scholes, which assumes a log-
normal distribution for the asset’s value and that the option can only be exercised at a fixed point in time.

	
22.4  Growth and Abandonment Options	
837
Working back to the information node at time zero, we face two outcomes, $0 if rates rise 
and $837,770 if rates fall. While we don’t know the true probability of each outcome, we can 
compute the present value using risk-neutral probabilities as we showed in Chapter 21. To 
find the risk-neutral probabilities, we solve for the probabilities so that the expected return of 
all financial assets is equal to the current risk-free rate. In Chapter 21, we used a stock as the 
financial asset; in this case, we use the 17-year risk-free annuity that pays $1000 per year as 
the financial asset. The value today of this annuity is
S = 1000
0.08
 ¢1 -
1
1.0817 ≤= $9122
A year from now, the annuity will pay $1000, and it will have 16 years left to maturity. 
Therefore, including the payment, it will be worth either
Su = 1000 + 1000
0.1

if interest rates go up, or, if interest rates fall,
Sd = 1000 + 1000
0.05
 ¢1 -
1
1.0516≤= $11,838
Suppose the current one-year risk-free interest rate is equal to 6%. (Note that this rate 
is below the current 17-year annuity rate of 8%; thus, the current yield curve is upward-
sloping.) We can calculate the risk-neutral probability of interest rates increasing, which we 
denote by r using Eq. 21.16:
r =
(1 + rf)S - Sd
Su - Sd
= 1.06 * 9122 - 11,838
8824 - 11,838
= 71.95%
That is, a risk-neutral probability of 71.95% that interest rates will rise is required for the 
annuity to have an expected return equal to the risk-free rate of 6% over the next year.
Now that we have calculated the risk-neutral probabilities for the interest rate move-
ments, we can use them to value StartUp’s patent. The value today of the investment

opportunity is the present value of the expected cash flows (using risk-neutral probabilities) 
discounted at the risk-free rate:
PV = 837,770 * (1 - 0.7195) + 0 * 0.7195
1.06
= $221,693
In this example, even though the cash flows of the project are known with certainty, the 
uncertainty regarding future interest rates creates substantial option value for the firm. The 
firm’s ability to use the patent and grow should interest rates fall is worth close to a quarter 
of a million dollars.
The Option to Expand
Future growth options are not only important to firm value, but can also be important 
in the value of an individual project. By undertaking a project, a firm often gets the 
­opportunity to invest in new projects that firms outside the industry cannot easily access. 
For example, a fashion designer might introduce a new line of clothes knowing that if the 
line proves popular, he has the option to launch a new line of accessories based on those 
clothes.
Consider an investment opportunity with an option to grow that requires a $10 million 
investment today. In one year, we will find out whether the project, which entails introduc-
ing a new product into the business machines market, is successful. The risk-neutral prob-
ability that the project will generate $1 million per year in perpetuity is 50%; otherwise, 
the project will generate nothing. At any time, we can double the size of the project on the 
original terms. Figure 22.7 represents these decisions on a decision tree.
Assume that the risk-free rate is constant at 6% per year. If we ignore the option 
to double the size of the project and we invest today, then the expected cash flows are 
$1 million * 0.5 = $500,000 per year. Computing the NPV gives
NPVwithout growth option = 500,000
0.06
- 10,000,000 = -$1.667 million
Based on this analysis, it appears that it is not optimal to undertake the project today. Of 
course, that also means we will never find out whether the project is successful.

QUESTION: How can real options be used 
to manage projects?
ANSWER: High-potential projects typi-
cally have substantial uncertain cash 
flows owing to technology and market 
uncertainties, and therefore your corporate finance team 
has to be more active in managing these projects. Essen-
tially they act as internal venture capitalists, seeking high 
payoffs from risky projects. We use real options to evaluate 
these types of investment opportunities. With real options, 
we can answer the questions: Given the technical and mar-
ket risks of the project, how much should we spend at the 
early stages? Does each incremental investment increase 
my return opportunities or decrease risk, and how? What 
amount of technology and market “learning” must be 
accomplished to merit a follow-on investment?
Real options are call options on an opportunity, giving 
you the right to stop, start, or modify a project at some 
future date. They are contingent, so you can make a stra-
tegic, rather than tactical, investment. By investing a small 
amount at each stage, you can gather enough information 
to decide what to do next. This limits your losses but still 
lets you capitalize on opportunities that arise. You don’t 
reject (or approve) the project outright, but make incre-
mental investments in the technology or market to gather 
sufficient information to determine whether this invest-
ment optimizes the company’s strategy and produces posi-
tive returns over the long term.
QUESTION: Explain the concepts of “pilot” 
and “commercial” stages?
ANSWER: The “pilot” stage refers to the 
incremental staged investments we make 
to move projects through “decision gates,” 
investing a small and appropriate amount 
to gather information about the technology 
and the market, while driving down the 
project risks. At the end of each decision 
gate, the project is re-evaluated. If there is 
a reasonable weighted probability of a suc-
cessful outcome, we invest again and con-
tinue to the next decision gate. Projects go 
through several gates, and at each one we 
focus on reducing uncertainty, until arriv-
ing at a decision point of whether to make 
a large, discretionary, one-time invest-
ment (the “strike price”) that launches the 
“piloted” concepts into production—the 
“commercial” stage—or terminate the project.
QUESTION: How does staging development create a real 
option with value?
ANSWER: Staging development is how we use real options 
to manage projects. By staging development we are buying 
knowledge, especially about the project risks and opportu-
nities. As a project moves through gates, projects compete 
for funding, and we use this knowledge to decide which 
projects should proceed and which ones should be deferred. 
The approach brings together the engineering, marketing, 
and finance disciplines to give a uniform look at risks and 
investment opportunities. This is one of the huge powers of 
the technique.
Boeing’s ability to solve aviation challenges with a high 
degree of efficiency is our competitive advantage and allows 
us to “buy” these options at below their market value 
through investments (the “premium”) in our engineering 
processes. Buying an option for less provides direct value to 
shareholders. We can leverage our internal knowledge with 
a relatively small amount of money and hedge the risks. It’s 
a tricky process, and is not completely financial. It often 
requires judgment as well.

Chapter 22  Real Options
The risk-neutral probability that this state will occur is 50%, so the expected value of this 
growth option is 6.667 * 0.5 = $3.333 million. The present value of this amount today is
PVgrowth option = 3.333
1.06 = $3.145 million
We have this option only if we choose to invest today (otherwise, we never find out 
how the product performs), so the NPV of undertaking this investment is the NPV we 
calculated above plus the value of the growth option we obtain by undertaking the project:
 NPV = NPVwithout growth option + PVgrowth option
 
= -1.667 + 3.145 = $1.478 million
Our analysis shows that the NPV of the investment opportunity is positive and the firm 
should undertake it.
Notice that it is optimal to undertake the investment today only because of the exis-
tence of the future expansion option. If we could find out how well the product would sell 
without actually producing it, then it would not make sense to invest until we found out 
this information. Because the only way to find out if the product is successful is to make 
and market it, it is optimal to proceed. In this case, the project is viable because we can 
experiment at a low scale and preserve the option to grow later.
This project is an example of a strategy that many firms use when they undertake big 
projects. Rather than commit to the entire project initially, a firm experiments by under-
taking the project in stages. It implements the project on a smaller scale first; if the small-
scale project proves successful, the firm then exercises the option to grow the project.
The Option to Abandon
The previous two examples consider cases in which the firm has the option to grow or 
expand if the project proves successful. Alternatively, when a project is unsuccessful, the 
firm may be able to mitigate its loss by abandoning the project. An abandonment option is 
the option to walk away. Abandonment options can add value to a project because a firm 
can drop a project if it turns out to be unsuccessful.
To illustrate, assume you are the CFO of a publicly traded nationwide chain of gourmet 
food stores. Your company is considering opening a new store in the renovated Ferry Build-
ing in Boston. If you do not sign the lease on the store today, someone else will, so you will 
not have the opportunity to open a store later. There is a clause in the lease that allows you 
to break the lease at no cost in two years.
Including the lease payments, the new store will cost $10,000 per month to operate. 
Because the building has just recently reopened, you do not know what the pedestrian traf-
fic will be. If your customers are mainly limited to morning and evening commuters, you 
expect to generate $8000 per month in revenue in perpetuity. If, however, the building fol-
lows the lead of the Ferry Building in San Francisco and becomes a tourist attraction, you 
believe that your revenue will be double that amount. You estimate there is a 50% prob-
ability that the Ferry Building will become a tourist attraction. The costs to set up the store 
will be $400,000. Assume that the cost of capital for the business is 7% per year.
Whether the Boston Ferry Building becomes a tourist attraction represents idiosyncratic 
uncertainty that investors in your company can costlessly diversify, and hence we do not 
need to adjust its probability for risk (i.e., the risk-neutral probability equals the true prob-
ability of 50%). If you were forced to operate the store under all circumstances, then the 

	
22.4  Growth and Abandonment Options	
841
expected revenue will be $8000 * 0.5 + $16,000 * 0.5 = $12,000. Given the monthly 
discount rate of 1.071/12 - 1 = 0.565%, the NPV of the investment is
NPV = 12,000 - 10,000
0.00565
- 400,000 = -$46,018
It would not make sense to open the store.
Of course, you do not have to keep operating the store. You have an option to get out of 
the lease after two years at no cost, and after the store is open it will be immediately obvi-
ous whether the Ferry Building is a tourist attraction. In this case, the decision tree looks 
like Figure 22.8.
If the Ferry Building is a tourist attraction, the NPV of the investment opportunity is
NPV = 16,000 - 10,000
0.00565
- 400,000 = $661,947
If the Ferry Building does not become a tourist attraction, you will close the store after 
two years. The NPV of the investment opportunity in this state is just the NPV of operat-
ing for two years:
 NPV = 8000 - 10,000
0.00565
 ¢1 -
1
1.0056524 ≤- 400,000
 = -$444,770
There is an equal probability of each state and again, because the risk is idiosyncratic, 
the actual and risk-neutral probabilities are the same. Thus, the NPV of opening the store 
is just the expected value using the actual probabilities:
$661,947 * 0.5 - $444,770 * 0.5 = $108,589
By exercising the option to abandon the venture, you limit your losses and so the NPV of 
undertaking the investment is positive. The value of the option to abandon is the difference 
between the NPV with and without the option: 108,589 - (-46,018) = $154,607.7
7We can also calculate the option value directly; with a 50% probability, we avoid the losses of $2000 per 
month starting in two years:

Chapter 22  Real Options
It is easy to ignore or understate the importance of the option to abandon. In many 
applications, killing an economically unsuccessful venture can add more value than starting 
a new venture. Often, however, managers focus on the value created by starting new ven-
tures and de-emphasize the value created by abandoning old ventures. Some of this behav-
ior undoubtedly results from the same behavioral biases that we discussed in ­Chapter 13 
that cause individual investors to hold onto losers. It is also closely tied to the sunk cost 
fallacy, the idea that once a manager makes a large investment, he should not abandon a 
project. As we pointed out in Chapter 8, sunk costs should have no bearing on an invest-
ment decision. If continuing a project is a negative-NPV undertaking, you can create value 
by abandoning, regardless of how much investment has already been sunk into the project.

22.5	 Investments with Different Lives
As we have seen, real options can add substantial value to an investment decision. There-
fore, when we are in a position of choosing between alternative investments, it is neces-
sary to assess any differences in the real options each provides. One example that can be 
particularly important is the case where one is comparing investments with different lives. 
While longer-term investments may have cost or return advantages, shorter-term invest-
ments include reinvestment options that should not be ignored. Let’s illustrate this trade-off 
with an example.
Consider the following problem faced by a financial analyst at Canadian Motors. Last 
year, an engineering firm named Advanced Mechanics was asked to design a new machine 
that will attach car chassis to bodies. The firm has produced two designs. The cheaper 
design will cost $10 million to implement and last five years. The more expensive design 
will cost $16 million and last 10 years. In both cases, the machines are expected to save 
Canadian Motors $3 million per year. If the cost of capital is 10%, which design should 
Canadian Motors approve?
Standalone NPV of Each Design.  Let’s first calculate the NPV of each decision on a 
standalone basis. The NPV of adopting the five-year machine is
NPV5 yr =
3
0.10
 ¢1 -
1
1.105 ≤- 10 = $1.37 million
The NPV of the 10-year machine is
NPV10 yr =
3
0.10
 ¢1 -
1
1.1010 ≤- 16 = $2.43 million
If the analyst simply picked the design with the higher standalone NPV, he would 
choose the longer-lived design. However, the preceding NPV calculation ignores the dif-
ference in these projects’ life spans. The longer-lived design embodies a 10-year production 
plan. The shorter-lived design only captures what will happen over the next five years. To 
truly compare the two options, we must consider what will happen once the shorter-lived 
equipment wears out. Let’s consider three possibilities: (1) the technology is not replaced; 

	
22.5  Investments with Different Lives	
843
(2) it is replaced at the same terms; or (3) technological advances allow us to replace it at 
improved terms.
No Replacement.  If the shorter-lived technology is not replaced (and the firm reverts to 
its old production process), there will be no additional benefits once its five-year life ends. 
In that case, the original comparison is correct, and the 10-year machine will increase firm 
value by 2.43 - 1.37 = $1.06 million more than the shorter-lived design.
One reason we might not replace the technology is if we expect its cost to increase. For 
example, suppose its cost in five years’ time will be $11.37 million or higher (an increase of 
2.6% per year). In that case, because the cost of the machine has gone up by more than its 
current NPV of $1.37 million, replacement will not be optimal.
Replacement at the Same Terms.  Suppose that we expect the costs and benefits of the 
shorter-lived design to be the same in five years. In that case, it will be optimal to replace the 
machine with a new equivalent machine, as we will again earn its NPV of $1.37 million. 
We should include this benefit when we evaluate the NPV of the five-year design, leading 
to a total NPV over the 10-year horizon of
NPV5 yr, with replacement = 1.37 + 1.37
1.105 = $2.22 million
Allowing for replacement at the same terms substantially increases the NPV we calcu-
lated for the five-year design. However, it is still inferior to the $2.43 million NPV from 
the 10-year design.
Replacement at Improved Terms.  In reality, the future cost of a machine is uncertain. 
Because of technological advances, machines may become less expensive rather than more 
expensive (think about the steadily declining prices of computers). Suppose we expect the 
cost of the new technology to fall to $7 million at the end of five years. Because the cost 
Traditionally, managers have accounted for the difference 
in project lengths by calculating the equivalent annual 
benefit (EAB) of each project, which is the constant annu-
ity payment over the life of the project that is equivalent 
to receiving its NPV today. The equivalent annual benefit 
method then selects the project with the highest equivalent 
annual benefit. (When all cash flows are costs, this approach 
is sometimes referred to as the equivalent annual cost 
method.)
For example, in the case of Canadian Motors, the equiva-
lent annual benefit of each machine is
 EAB5 yr =
1.37
1
0.10
 ¢1 -
1
1.105 ≤
= $0.361 million,
 EAB10 yr =
2.43
1
0.10
 ¢1 -
1
1.1010 ≤
= $0.395 million
Thus, the 10-year machine has the higher equivalent annual 
benefit and would be chosen under this method.
The equivalent annual benefit method assumes that we 
earn the project’s EAB over the entire forecast horizon. For 
the five-year machine, this assumption means that we would 
earn an NPV over 10 years of
NPV5 yr EAB = 0.361
0.10
 ¢1 -
1
1.1010 ≤= $2.22 million
Comparing this result with our earlier analysis, we see that 
using the EAB method is equivalent to assuming that we can 
replace the project at identical terms over the entire horizon. 
While this assumption may be correct, in most instances 
there is significant uncertainty regarding the project terms 
in the future. In that case, real option methods must be used 
to determine the correct choice.

has declined by $3 million, its NPV will rise to 3 + 1.37 = $4.37 million. In that case, the 
NPV of the five-year design over a 10-year horizon is
NPV5 yr, with improved replacement = 1.37 + 4.37
1.105 = $4.08 million
Thus, if terms are expected to improve in this way, the five-year design is optimal for 
the firm, increasing firm value by 4.08 - 2.43 = $1.65 million compared to the 10-year 
machine.
Valuing the Replacement Option.  As the above analysis reveals, adopting the five-year 
machine provides the firm with a replacement option in five years’ time. In order to com-
pare the two designs correctly, we must determine the value of this replacement option, 
which will depend on the likelihood that the cost of the machine will decrease or increase.
Example 22.2
Valuing the Replacement Option
Problem
Suppose the cost of the shorter-lived machine is equally likely to rise to $13 million, stay equal to 
$10 million, or fall to $7 million, and suppose this risk is idiosyncratic and does not change the 
project’s cost of capital. Which machine should the firm choose?
Solution
If the cost rises to $13 million, the firm will choose not to replace the machine and get an NPV 
of 0. If the cost stays the same or falls, the firm will replace the machine and get an NPV of $1.37 
million or $4.37 million, respectively. Given the probabilities, the NPV of the five-year machine 
over the 10-year horizon is
NPV5 yr, with uncertain replacement = 1.37 +
1
3 (0) + 1
3 (1.37) + 1
3 (4.37)
1.105
= $2.56 million
Thus, given this uncertainty, the shorter-lived machine offers a higher NPV over 10 years  
than the $2.43 million NPV of the longer-lived machine. By committing to the longer-
lived project, the firm would give up its real option to react to technological and market 
changes.

investment opportunities with different lives?
	
2.	 What is a major shortcoming of the equivalent annual benefit method?
	
22.6	 Optimally Staging Investments
In analyzing the value of the option to grow, we considered the real option value of a 
staged investment opportunity. The advantage of staging is that it allows us to postpone 
investment until after we learn important new information. We can avoid making the 
investment unless the new information suggests it is worthwhile.
In many applications, the stages have a natural order, for example, investing in a prototype 
before developing on a large scale. But in some situations, we can choose the order of the 
development stages. If so, how can we maximize the value of the real options that we create?

Required Time, Cost, and Likelihood of Success 
for Eclectic’s Project
An Example: Eclectic Motors.  Eclectic Motors is considering developing an electric car 
that would compete directly with gasoline-powered cars. They must overcome three tech-
nological hurdles to produce a successful car:
	
1.	 Develop materials to significantly reduce the car’s body weight.
	
2.	 Develop a method to rapidly recharge the batteries.
	
3.	 Advance battery technology to reduce weight and increase storage capacity.
As shown in Table 22.2, although Eclectic’s engineers have already made significant break-
throughs, further research and substantial risk remain for each task:
Suppose all three risks are idiosyncratic, and the risk-free interest rate is 6%. Given 
Eclectic’s resources, the company can only work on one technology at a time. Eclectic’s 
managers know that by appropriately staging these investments, they can enhance the 
firm’s value. The question is, assuming that it makes sense to proceed, which technology 
should they tackle first?
Mutually Dependent Investments.  Eclectic’s electric car project represents a situation 
with mutually dependent investments, in which the value of one project depends upon 
the outcome of the others. In this case, we assume that all three challenges must be over-
come, or there will be no benefit. Thus, we need to determine the optimal order of invest-
ment that will minimize the expected cost of development.
Investment Scale.  Consider first the materials and recharger technologies. These two are 
identical except for the upfront investment costs. Let’s compare the expected cost of com-
pleting them in different orders. If we begin with the materials technology, the expected 
cost to complete both is
100

Thus, it is clear that Eclectic should invest in the materials technology before working 
on the recharger. Because the cost of the recharger is greater, we don’t want to waste our 
investment in it if the materials technology fails. As this example shows, other things being 
equal, it is beneficial to make the least costly investments first, delaying more expensive 
investments until it is clear they are warranted.
Investment Time and Risk.  Next, let’s compare the materials and battery technologies. 
These projects have the same cost, but the battery technology will take longer and has a 
greater chance of failure. Considering only these two projects, if we begin with the materi-
als technology, the expected cost of completing both is
100
+
0.50
*   1
1.06

+
0.25
*   1
1.064
*
100
=
$119.80 million
Thus, Eclectic should work on the battery technology before working on the materials. 
Given its greater risk, we will learn more if the battery project succeeds regarding the 
viability of the overall project. Due to its longer time requirement, we also benefit from the 
time value of postponing the following investments further. In general, other things being 
equal, it is beneficial to invest in riskier and lengthier projects first, delaying future invest-
ments until the greatest amount of information can be learned.
A General Rule.  As we have seen, the cost, time, and risk of each project will determine 
the optimal order in which to invest. Intuitively, by making smaller, riskier investments 
first, we gain the most additional information at the lowest cost. (Thus, the battery project 
should definitely come before the recharger project.) In general, we can find the opti-
mal order to stage mutually dependent projects by ranking each, from highest to lowest, 
according to its failure cost index:
	
Failure Cost Index = 1 - PV(success)
PV(investment)
(22.3)
where PV(success) is the value at the start of the project of receiving $1 if the project suc-
ceeds (i.e., the present value of the risk-neutral probability of success) and PV(investment) 
is the project’s required investment, again expressed as a present value at the project’s start. 
The failure cost index orders investments so that we gain the most information at the low-
est cost upfront.

One of the major drawbacks of using the concepts introduced in this chapter is that they 
are difficult to implement. In practice, correctly modeling the sources of uncertainty and 
appropriate dynamic decisions usually requires an extensive amount of time and financial 
Example 22.3
Deciding the Order of Investment with Multiple Stages
Problem
Use the failure cost index to determine the optimal investment order for Eclectic’s electric car 
project.
Solution
Evaluating the failure cost index for each stage, we have
Materials:	
[1 - (0.50/1.06)]/100 = 0.00528
Recharger:	
[1 - (0.50/1.06)]/400 = 0.00132
Battery:	
[1 - (0.25/1.064)]/100 = 0.00802
So, Eclectic should develop the batteries first, then the body materials, and finally the charger, 
matching our earlier analysis.
Until now, we have ignored the decision about whether it is optimal to develop at all. In 
evaluating the overall investment decision, the first step is to decide the optimal order of 
investment in each stage. Once that order has been determined, we can calculate the over-
all NPV of the opportunity and reach a decision on whether to proceed.
Example 22.4
Deciding Whether to Invest in a Project with Multiple Stages
Problem
Eclectic’s managers estimate that with these technological breakthroughs, they can develop the 
electric car, and the present value of all future profits will be $4 billion. Does the decision to 
develop the car make sense?
Solution
Using the optimal order from Example 22.3, the NPV is
NPV = -100 - 0.25 100
1.064 - 0.25 * 0.5 400
1.065 + 0.25 * 0.5 * 0.5 4000
1.066 = $19.1 million
Thus, it is profitable to develop the electric car. However, this result crucially depends on the 
optimal staging—the NPV would be negative if Eclectic chose any other order!

expertise. Furthermore, in most cases, the solutions are problem-specific, so the time and 
expertise spent on one problem are not transferable to other problems. Consequently, 
many firms resort to following rules of thumb.8 Here, we examine two commonly used 
rules of thumb: the profitability index and hurdle rates.
The Profitability Index Rule
As we explained in Section 22.1, when an investment opportunity can be delayed, it is 
optimal to invest only when the NPV of the investment project is sufficiently high. In 
most applications, it is quite difficult to calculate precisely how high the NPV must be to 
trigger investment. As a result, some firms use the following rule of thumb: Invest whenever 
the profitability index exceeds a specified level.
Recall from Chapter 7 that in the simple case of a project where the only resource is the 
upfront investment, the profitability index is
Profitability Index =
NPV
Initial Investment
The profitability index rule directs you to invest whenever the profitability index exceeds 
some predetermined number. When the investment cannot be delayed, the optimal rule is 
to invest whenever the profitability index is greater than zero. When there is an option to 
delay, a common rule of thumb is to invest only when the index exceeds a higher thresh-
old, such as one. Often, firms set high thresholds because the cost of investing at the wrong 
time is usually asymmetric. It is often better to wait too long (use a profitability index 
criterion that is too high) than to invest too soon (use a profitability index criterion that is 
too low).
The Hurdle Rate Rule
The profitability index rule raises the bar on the NPV to take into account the option to 
wait. Rather than invest when the NPV is zero, you wait until the NPV is a multiple of 
the initial investment. Instead of raising the bar on the NPV, the hurdle rate rule raises 
the discount rate. The hurdle rate rule uses a higher discount rate than the cost of capital 
to compute the NPV, but then applies the regular NPV rule: Invest whenever the NPV 
calculated using this higher discount rate is positive. This higher discount rate is known as the 
hurdle rate because if the project can jump this hurdle—that is, have a positive NPV at 
this higher discount rate—then it should be undertaken.
When the source of uncertainty that creates a motive to wait is interest rate uncertainty, 
there is a natural way to approximate the optimal hurdle rate. In this case, the rule of thumb 
is to multiply the cost of capital by the ratio of the callable annuity rate, which is the rate 
on a risk-free annuity that can be repaid (or called ⁜) at any time, to the risk-free rate:
	
Hurdle Rate = Cost of Capital * Callable Annuity Rate
Risk@Free Rate

(22.4)
We should then invest whenever the NPV of the project is positive using this hurdle rate 
as the discount rate.

L. Trigeorgis (eds.), Project Flexibility, Agency, and Competition (Oxford University Press, 2000), for a 
detailed analysis of the performance of different rules of thumb.

	
22.7  Rules of Thumb	
849
Example 22.5
Using the Hurdle Rate Rule for the Option to Delay
Problem
You can invest in a risk-free technology that requires an upfront payment of $1 million and will 
provide a perpetual annual cash flow of $90,000. Suppose all interest rates will be either 10% 
or 5% in one year and remain there forever. The risk-neutral probability that interest rates will 
drop to 5% is 90%. The one-year risk-free interest rate is 8%, and today’s rate on a risk-free 
perpetual bond is 5.4%. The rate on an equivalent perpetual bond that is repayable at any time 
(the ­callable annuity rate) is 9%.9 Should you invest in the technology today, or wait and see if 
rates drop and then invest?
Solution
Because the investment is risk free, the cost of capital is the risk-free rate. Thus, Eq. 22.4 suggests 
using a hurdle rate equal to the callable annuity rate of 9%. With that rate,
NPV = 90,000
0.09
- 1,000,000 = 0
The hurdle rate rule implies that you are indifferent. Let’s see if this is correct. The actual cost of 
capital is 5.4% (the rate offered on a risk-free perpetuity), so the investment opportunity clearly 
has a positive NPV:
NPV = 90,000
.054
- 1,000,000 = $666,667
9To check that these rates make sense, note that a $1000 perpetual bond paying $54 per year would 
be worth $54 + 54/.05 = $1134 if interest rates fall and $54 + 54/.10 = $594 if rates rise, for a (risk-
neutral) expected payoff of 0.9 * 1134 + 0.1 * 594 = $1080, and an expected return equal to the 
one-year risk-free rate of 8%. Similarly, a $1000 callable bond with a coupon of $90 would be worth 
$90 + 1000 = $1090 if rates fall and the bond is prepaid, and $90 + 90/.10 = $990 if rates rise, again 
for a risk-neutral expected payoff of 0.9 * 1090 + 0.1 * 990 = $1080.
What is the intuition for this rule? Let’s assume you have a risk-free project that you can 
delay. It currently has a positive NPV. You intend to borrow the initial investment but you 
are unsure whether you should wait in the hope that interest rates will fall. If you take out a 
regular loan and interest rates decrease, you will be stuck paying a higher rate. However, if 
you take out a callable loan and interest rates fall, then you can refinance the loan and take 
advantage of the lower rates. So, if the project has a positive NPV using the callable annu-
ity rate as the discount rate, you can have your cake and eat it too: You can immediately 
get the benefits of the investment by undertaking it and still take advantage of a lower rate 
if rates fall. Thus, it makes sense to invest immediately. The rule of thumb approximately 
implements this decision rule.
How large is the difference between the hurdle rate and the cost of capital? Because 
government-guaranteed mortgages are insured against default and repayable by the bor-
rower at any time, they are an example of a callable annuity (as the box on the next page 
explains). Based on the difference between mortgage and risk-free rates, using a hurdle rate 
20% higher than the firm’s cost of capital might be a reasonable adjustment to account for 
the firm’s ability to wait until interest rates are sufficiently favorable to invest.

850	
Chapter 22  Real Options
Let’s see what the NPV of waiting is. If we delay the investment, it makes sense to invest only 
if rates drop to 5%, in which case
NPVrates go down = 90,000
0.05
- 1,000,000 = $800,000
The present value today of the expected NPV using risk-neutral probabilities is therefore
800,000 * 0.90
1.08
= $666,667
The hurdle rate rule is correct: You really are indifferent between investing today and waiting.
In situations like Example 22.5, when the cash flows are constant and perpetual, and 
the reason to wait derives solely from interest rate uncertainty, the rule of thumb is exact.10 
However, when these conditions are not satisfied, the rule of thumb merely approximates 
the correct decision.
While using a hurdle rate rule for deciding when to invest might be a cost-effective way 
to make investment decisions, it is important to remember that this rule does not provide an 
accurate measure of value. The value of making an investment is the NPV calculated using 
the cost of capital as the discount rate, not the hurdle rate. Thus, while the rule of thumb pro-
vides the correct time to invest in Example 22.5, the actual value of undertaking the invest-
ment is $666,667—the NPV when the correct cost of capital is used as the discount rate.
Potentially, there could be an advantage to using the hurdle rate and profitability index 
rules of thumb simultaneously. That is, the decision when to invest can be made by first com-
puting the NPV using the hurdle rate in Eq. 22.4 to account for interest rate uncertainty. The 
profitability index can then be calculated using this NPV, with the firm accepting the project 
only if the profitability index exceeds a threshold that accounts for cash flow uncertainty.

1319–1326.
As most homeowners know, mortgage interest rates are 
higher than comparable risk-free rates like the yield on the 
30-year U.S. Treasury bond. One reason mortgage rates are 
higher than Treasury rates is the risk that the homeowner 
will default. But, for high-quality borrowers, this risk has 
remained relatively small, even through the financial crisis. 
Furthermore, in many cases, mortgage lenders are insured 
against default by government agencies. Yet, mortgage rates 
for the best borrowers still exceed even the rates on some 
corporate debt.
Mortgage interest rates are higher than Treasury rates 
because mortgages have a repayment option that Treasuries 
do not have: You can repay your mortgage at any time, while 
the U.S. government cannot. Consequently, if interest rates 
drop, a mortgage holder can refinance—that is, repay the 
existing mortgage and take out a new mortgage at a lower 
rate. This option to refinance is valuable to the borrower but 
costly to the lender: If rates fall, the mortgage holder will 
repay the mortgage and replace it with a new mortgage at a 
lower rate, whereas if rates rise, the bank is stuck with a loan 
that is now below the market rate. Of course, banks under-
stand they have written this option, and so demand a higher 
rate on the loan than the rate they would if the mortgage did 
not have the repayment option. As a result, mortgage rates 
have tended to be at least 20% higher than long-term risk-
free interest rates.

22.8	 Key Insights from Real Options
Although a general rule for how to account for all real options does not exist, there are a 
few simple principles that we have covered in this chapter. In closing, it is worth restating 
these principles:
Out-of-the-Money Real Options Have Value.  Even if an investment opportunity cur-
rently has a negative NPV, it does not imply that the opportunity is worthless. So long as 
there is a chance that the investment opportunity could have a positive NPV in the future, 
the opportunity is worth something today.
In-the-Money Real Options Need Not Be Exercised Immediately.  You should not 
necessarily take on an investment opportunity that has a positive NPV today. If you can 
delay the investment opportunity, the option to delay might be worth more than the NPV 
of undertaking the investment immediately. In this case, you should not undertake the 
investment and instead delay it.
Waiting Is Valuable.  Value can be created by waiting for uncertainty to resolve because 
once uncertainty is resolved, you can make better decisions with better information. Thus, 
if there is no cost to waiting, investing early never makes sense. If there is a cost, always 
weigh the benefits of waiting for resolution of uncertainty against the costs of waiting.
Delay Investment Expenses as Much as Possible.  Because waiting is valuable, you should 
only incur investment expenses at the last possible moment. Committing capital before it 
is absolutely necessary reduces value because it gives up the option to make a better deci-
sion once uncertainty has been resolved.
Create Value by Exploiting Real Options.  In an uncertain environment, real options 
create value for the firm. To realize this value, the firm must continually re-evaluate its 
investment opportunities and optimize its decision-making dynamically. It is important to 
keep in mind that often as much value can be created by optimally delaying or abandoning 
projects as by creating or growing them.
Combining these insights, we find that by staging investments, and using clear 
­valuation-based methods to determine at each stage if the firm should abandon, defer, con-
tinue, or grow an investment opportunity, managers can substantially increase firm value.
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
22.1  Real Versus Financial Options
	
n	 A real option is an option where the underlying asset is physical rather than financial.
22.2  Decision Tree Analysis
	
n	 A decision tree is a graphical way to represent alternative decisions and potential outcomes in an 
uncertain economy. It contains decision nodes and information nodes.

852	
Chapter 22  Real Options
22.3  The Option to Delay: Investment as a Call Option
	
n	 By waiting before committing to an investment, a firm can obtain more information about the 
investment’s returns. By correctly choosing the time to invest, it can add value.
	
n	 When you have the option of deciding when to invest, it is usually optimal to invest only when 
the NPV is substantially greater than zero.
	
n	 Given the option to wait, an investment that currently has a negative NPV can have a positive 
value.
	
n	 The option to wait is most valuable when there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding what the 
value of the investment will be in the future.
	
n	 In the real option context, the dividends correspond to any value from the investment that we 
give up by waiting. Absent dividends, a call option should not be exercised early.
	
n	 The beta of the option to invest is a multiple of the beta of the underlying investment opportu-
nity, and varies with its value.
22.4  Growth and Abandonment Options
	
n	 By undertaking a project, a firm often gets the opportunity to make investments that it would 
not have otherwise. The opportunity to invest in projects in the future—that is, the firm’s 
growth options—is worth something today.
	
n	 When firms find themselves involved in a project that is losing money, with little prospect of 
turning things around in the future, they can exercise their abandonment option and walk away.
22.5  Investments with Different Lives
	
n	 In choosing between investments with different lives, a firm must take into account its option 
to replace or extend the shorter-lived project at the end of its original life.
	
n	 Managers sometimes use the equivalent annual benefit method to compare projects of different 
lengths. It implicitly assumes that the projects can be replaced at their original terms. Using 
the equivalent annual benefit method might produce different recommendations when future 
uncertainty is taken into account.
22.6  Optimally Staging Investments
	
n	 When deciding the order of investment for a multi-stage investment decision, there is a benefit 
to making smaller and riskier investments first in order to gain additional information at low 
cost. If the projects are mutually dependent so that all projects must succeed for the firm to 
­realize any benefit, the optimal order can be determined by ranking the projects according to 
the failure cost index in Eq. 22.3.
22.7  Rules of Thumb
	
n	 The profitability index rule of thumb calls for investing whenever the profitability index exceeds 
some predetermined number. It is a way of accounting for the option to wait when there is cash 
flow uncertainty.
	
n	 The hurdle rate rule of thumb computes the NPV using the hurdle rate, a discount rate higher 
than the cost of capital, and specifies that the investment should be undertaken only when the 
NPV computed this way is positive. It is a way of accounting for the option to wait when there 
is interest rate uncertainty.
22.8  Key Insights from Real Options
	
n	 Out-of-the-money real options have value.
	
n	 In-the-money real options need not be exercised immediately.
	
n	 Waiting is valuable.
	
n	 Delay investment expenses as much as possible.
	
n	 Create value by exploiting real options.

Decision Tree Analysis
	
1.	 Your company is planning on opening an office in Japan. Profits depend on how fast the econ-
omy in Japan recovers from its current recession. There is a 50% chance of recovery this year. 
You are trying to decide whether to open the office now or in a year. Construct the decision tree 
that shows the choices you have to open the office either today or one year from now.
	
2.	 You are trying to decide whether to make an investment of $500 million in a new technology 
to produce Everlasting Gobstoppers. There is a 60% chance that the market for these candies 
will produce profits of $100 million annually, a 20% chance the market will produce profits of 
$50 million, and a 20% chance that there will be no profits. The size of the market will become 
clear one year from now. Currently, the cost of capital of the project is 11% per year. There is a 
20% chance that the cost of capital will drop to 9% in a year and stay at that level forever, and 
an 80% chance that it will stay at 11% forever. Movements in the cost of capital are unrelated 
to the size of the candy market. Construct the decision tree that shows the choices you have to 
make the investment either today or one year from now.

6.	 You are a financial analyst at Global Conglomerate and are considering entering the shoe busi-
ness. You believe that you have a very narrow window for entering this market. Because of 
Christmas demand, the time is right today and you believe that exactly a year from now would 
also be a good opportunity. Other than these two windows, you do not think another oppor-
tunity will exist to break into this business. It will cost you $35.2 million to enter the market. 
Because other shoe manufacturers exist and are public companies, you can construct a perfectly 
comparable company. Hence, you have decided to use the Black-Scholes formula to decide 
when and if you should enter the shoe business. Your analysis implies that the current value 
of an operating shoe company is $40.4 million and it has a beta of 1.1. However, the flow of 
customers is uncertain, so the value of the company is volatile-your analysis indicates that the 
volatility is 25% per year. Twenty percent of the value of the company is attributable to the 
value of the free cash flows (cash available to you to spend how you wish) expected in the first 
year. If the one-year risk-free rate of interest is 4.1%:
a.	 Should Global enter this business and, if so, when?
b.	 How will the decision change if the current value of a shoe company is $35.6 million instead 
of $40.4 million?

7.	 It is the beginning of September and you have been offered the following deal to go heli-skiing. If 
you pick the first week in January and pay for your vacation now, you can get a week of heli-skiing 
for $1800. However, if you cannot ski because the helicopters cannot fly due to bad weather, there 
is no snow, or you get sick, you do not get a refund. There is a 30% probability that you will not 
be able to ski. If you wait until the last minute and go only if you know that the conditions are 
perfect and you are well, the vacation will cost $5400. You estimate that the pleasure you get from 
heli-skiing is worth $6500 per week to you (if you had to pay any more than that, you would 
choose not to go). If your cost of capital is 13% per year, should you book ahead or wait?
	
8.	 A professor in the Computer Science department at United States Institute of Technology has 
just patented a new search engine technology and would like to sell it to you, an interested 
venture capitalist. The patent has a 17-year life. The technology will take a year to implement 
(there are no cash flows in the first year) and has an upfront cost of $100 million. You believe 
this technology will be able to capture 1.15% of the Internet search market, and currently this 
market generates profits of $1 billion per year. Over the next five years, the risk-neutral prob-
ability that profits will grow at 10.1% per year is 20% and the risk-neutral probability that 
profits will grow at 5.1% per year is 80%. This growth rate will become clear one year from 
now (after the first year of growth). After five years, profits are expected to decline 2% annually. 
No profits are expected after the patent runs out. Assume that all risk-free interest rates are 
constant (regardless of the term) at 10.1% per year.

*11.	 The management of Southern Express Corporation is considering investing 20% of all future 
earnings in growth. The company has a single growth opportunity that it can take either now or 
in one period. Although the managers do not know the return on investment with certainty, they 
know it is equally likely to be either 12% or 15% per year. In one period, they will find out which 
state will occur. Currently the firm pays out all earnings as a dividend of $12 million; if it does not 
make the investment, dividends are expected to remain at this level forever. If Southern Express 
undertakes the investment, the new dividend will reflect the realized return on investment and 
will grow at the realized rate forever. Assuming the opportunity cost of capital is 13.1%, what is

Growth and Abandonment Options
	
13.	 Your R&D division has just synthesized a material that will superconduct electricity at room 
temperature; you have given the go ahead to try to produce this material commercially. It will 
take five years to find out whether the material is commercially viable, and you estimate that 
the probability of success is 25%. Development will cost $9.6 million per year, paid at the 
beginning of each year. If development is successful and you decide to produce the material, 
the factory will be built immediately. It will cost $1019 million to put in place and will gener-
ate profits of $87 million at the end of every year in perpetuity. Assume that the current five-­
year risk-free interest rate is 9.7% per year, and the yield on a perpetual risk-free bond will be 
11.6%, 10.4%, 7.8%, or 4.5% in five years. Assume that the risk-neutral probability of each 
possible rate is the same. What is the value today of this project?
	
*14.	 You are an analyst working for Goldman Sachs, and you are trying to value the growth poten-
tial of a large, established company, Big Industries. Big Industries has a thriving R&D division 
that has consistently turned out successful products. You estimate that, on average, the R&D 
division generates approximately two new product proposals every three years, so that there is a 
61% chance that a project will be proposed every year. Typically, the investment opportunities 
the R&D division produces require an initial investment of $10.1 million and yield profits of 
$1.06 million per year that grow at one of three possible growth rates in perpetuity: 3.2%, 0%, 
and -3.2%. All three growth rates are equally likely for any given project. These opportunities 
are always “take it or leave it” opportunities: If they are not undertaken immediately, they disap-
pear forever. Assume that the cost of capital will always remain at 11.6% per year. What is the 
present value of all future growth opportunities Big Industries will produce?
	
*15.	 Repeat Problem 14, but this time assume that all the probabilities are risk-neutral probabilities, 
which means the cost of capital is always the risk-free rate and risk-free rates are as follows: The 

856	
Chapter 22  Real Options
current interest rate for a risk-free perpetuity is 8%; in one year, there is a 64.375% chance that 
all risk-free interest rates will be 10% and stay there forever, and a 35.625% chance that they 
will be 6% and stay there forever. The current one-year risk-free rate is 7%.
	
16.	 You own a small networking startup. You have just received an offer to buy your firm from a 
large, publicly traded firm, JCH Systems. Under the terms of the offer, you will receive 1 million 
shares of JCH. JCH stock currently trades for $24.53 per share. You can sell the shares of JCH 
that you will receive in the market at any time. But as part of the offer, JCH also agrees that at 
the end of the next year, it will buy the shares back from you for $24.53 per share if you desire. 
Suppose the current one-year risk-free rate is 5.75%, the volatility of JCH stock is 29.3%, and 
JCH does not pay dividends.
a.	 Is this offer worth more than $24.53 million? Explain.
b.	 What is the value of the offer?
	
17.	 You own a wholesale plumbing supply store. The store currently generates revenues of $1 million 
per year. Next year, revenues will either decrease by 9.6% or increase by 4.8%, with equal prob-
ability, and then stay at that level as long as you operate the store. You own the store outright. Other 
costs run $880,000 per year. There are no costs to shutting down; in that case you can always sell 
the store for $510,000. What is the business worth today if the cost of capital is fixed at 9.6%?
	
*18.	 You own a copper mine. The price of copper is currently $1.54 per pound. The mine produces 
1 million pounds of copper per year and costs $2 million per year to operate. It has enough 
­copper to operate for 100 years. Shutting the mine down would entail bringing the land up to 
EPA standards and is expected to cost $4.92 million. Reopening the mine once it is shut down 
would be an impossibility given current environmental standards. The price of copper has an 
equal (and independent) probability of going up or down by 25% each year for the next two 
years and then will stay at that level forever. Calculate the NPV of continuing to operate the mine 
if the cost of capital is fixed at 15.2%. Is it optimal to abandon the mine or keep it operating?
	
19.	 An original silver dollar from the late eighteenth century consists of approximately 24 grams of 
silver. At a price of $0.19 per gram ($6 per troy ounce), the silver content of the coin is worth 
about $4.50. Assume that these coins are in plentiful supply and are not collector’s items, so 
they have no numismatic value. If the current price of silver is $0.19 per gram, will the price of 
the coin be greater than, less than, or equal to $4.50? Justify your answer.
	
*20.	 You own a piece of raw land in an up-and-coming area in Gotham City. The costs to construct 
a building increase disproportionately with the size of the building. A building of q square feet 
costs 0.1 * q2 to build. After you construct a building on the lot, it will last forever but you are 
committed to it: You cannot put another building on the lot. Buildings currently rent at $100 per 
square foot per month. Rents in this area are expected to increase in five years. There is a 50% 
chance that they will rise to $200 per square foot per month and stay there forever, and a 50% 
chance that they will stay at $100 per square foot per month forever. The cost of capital is fixed at 
12% per year.
a.	 Should you construct a building on the lot right away? If so, how large should the 
building be?
b.	 If you choose to delay the decision, how large a building will you construct in each possible 
state in five years?
Investments with Different Lives
	
21.	 What implicit assumption is made when managers use the equivalent annual benefit method to 
decide between two projects with different lives that use the same resource?
	
22.	 You own a cab company and are evaluating two options to replace your fleet. Either you can 
take out a five-year lease on the replacement cabs for $491 per month per cab, or you can pur-
chase the cabs outright for $31,000, in which case the cabs will last eight years. You must return 
the cabs to the leasing company at the end of the lease. The leasing company is responsible for 
all maintenance costs, but if you purchase the cabs, you will buy a maintenance contract that

will cost $101 per month for the life of each cab. Each cab will generate revenues of $1076 per 
month. Assume the cost of capital is fixed at 11.1%.
a.	 Calculate the NPV per cab of both possibilities: purchasing the cabs or leasing them.
b.	 Calculate the equivalent monthly benefit of both opportunities.
c.	 If you are leasing a cab, you have the opportunity to buy the used cab after five years. 
Assume that in five years a five-year-old cab will cost either $10,300 or $15,800 with equal 
likelihood, will have maintenance costs of $505 per month, and will last three more years. 
Which option should you take?
Optimally Staging Investments
	
23.	 Genenco is developing a new drug that will slow the aging process. In order to succeed, two 
breakthroughs are needed: one to increase the potency of the drug, and the second to eliminate 
toxic side effects. Research to improve the drug’s potency is expected to require an upfront 
investment of $10 million and take 2 years; the drug has a 5% chance of success. Reducing 
the drug’s toxicity will require a $30 million upfront investment, take 4 years, and has a 20% 
chance of success. If both efforts are successful, Genenco can sell the patent for the drug to a 
major drug company for $2 billion. All risk is idiosyncratic, and the risk-free rate is 6%.
a.	 What is the NPV of launching both research efforts simultaneously?
b.	 What is the optimal order to stage the investments?
c.	 What is the NPV with the optimal staging?
	
24.	 Your engineers are developing a new product to launch next year that will require both software 
and hardware innovations. The software team requests a budget of $6 million and forecasts an 
80% chance of success. The hardware team requests a $11 million budget and forecasts a 53% 
chance of success. Both teams will need 6 months to work on the product, and the risk-free 
interest rate is 3% APR with semiannual compounding.
a.	 Which team should work on the project first?
b.	 Suppose that before anyone has worked on the project, the hardware team comes back and 
revises their proposal, changing the estimated chance of success to 78% based on new infor-
mation. Will this affect your decision in (a)?
Rules of Thumb
	
25.	 Your firm is thinking of expanding. If you invest today, the expansion will generate $11 million 
in FCF at the end of the year and will have a continuation value of either $145 million (if the 
economy improves) or $50 million (if the economy does not improve). If you wait until next 
year to invest, you will lose the opportunity to make $11 million in FCF, but you will know the 
continuation value of the investment in the following year (that is, in a year from now, you will 
know what the investment continuation value will be in the following year). Suppose the risk-
free rate is 4%, and the risk-neutral probability that the economy improves is 37%. Assume the 
cost of expanding is the same this year or next year.
a.	 If the cost of expanding is $83 million, should you do so today, or wait until next year to 
decide?
b.	 At what cost of expanding would there be no difference between expanding now and 
waiting? To what profitability index does this correspond?
	
26.	 Assume that the project in Example 22.5 pays an annual cash flow of $100,000 (instead of 
$90,000).
a.	 What is the NPV of investing today?
b.	 What is the NPV of waiting and investing tomorrow?
c.	 Verify that the hurdle rate rule of thumb gives the correct time to invest in this case.

THE LAW Of OnE PRicE cOnnEcTiOn. How should a firm raise the funds 
it needs to undertake its investments? In the capital structure part of the text, we dis-
cussed the financial manager’s choice between the major categories of financing, debt, 
and equity. In this part of the book, we explain the mechanics of implementing these 
decisions. Chapter 23 describes the process a company goes through when it raises 
equity capital. In Chapter 24, we review firms’ use of debt markets to raise capital. 
Chapter 25 introduces an alternative to long-term debt financing—­leasing. By pre-
senting leasing as a financing alternative, we apply the Law of One Price to determine 
that the benefits of leasing must derive from tax differences, incentive effects, or other 
market imperfections.

AS WE POINTED OUT IN CHAPTER 1, MOST BUSINESSES in the 
United States are small sole proprietorships and partnerships. Yet, these firms gener-
ate only 10% of total U.S. sales. One limitation of a sole proprietorship is that it does 
not allow access to outside equity capital, so the business has relatively little capacity 
for growth. Another limitation is that the sole proprietor is forced to hold a large frac-
tion of his or her wealth in a single asset—the company—and therefore is likely to 
be undiversified. By incorporating, businesses can gain access to capital and founders 
can reduce the risk of their portfolios by selling some of their equity and diversifying. 
Consequently, even though corporations make up less than 20% of U.S. businesses, 
they account for nearly 85% of sales in the U.S. economy.
In this chapter, we discuss how companies raise equity capital. We begin by looking 
at sources of equity financing for private firms. These sources include angel investors, 
venture capital firms, and private equity firms. We then review the initial public offering 
(IPO) process in which firms list their shares to be traded by all investors on a recog-
nized stock exchange. Finally, we look how public companies may raise additional equity 
capital through a seasoned offering. To illustrate these concepts, we follow the case of 
a real company, RealNetworks, Inc. (RNWK). RealNetworks is a leading creator of digi-
tal media services and software. Customers use RealNetworks’ products to find, play, 
purchase, and manage digital music, videos, and games. RealNetworks was founded in 
1993 and incorporated in 1994. Using the example of RealNetworks, we first discuss 
the alternative ways new companies can raise capital and then examine the impact of 
these funding alternatives on current and new investors.

23.1	 Equity Financing for Private Companies
The initial capital that is required to start a business is usually provided by the entrepreneur 
herself and her immediate family. However, few families have the resources to finance a 
growing business, so growth almost always requires outside capital. A private company 
must seek sources that can provide this capital, but it must also understand how the infu-
sion of outside capital will affect the control of the company, particularly when outside 
investors decide to cash out their investments in the company.
Sources of Funding
When a private company decides to raise outside equity capital, it can seek funding from 
several potential sources: angel investors, venture capital firms, institutional investors, and 
corporate investors. The source of capital is closely tied to the lifecycle of the firm. Start-up 
firms in their earliest stages rely on angels. As the firm grows, it is able to tap into the other 
sources of equity financing.
Angel Investors.  Traditionally, when entrepreneurs had an idea and started a firm, they 
relied on friends and family as the initial source of funding. But today, the market for very 
early stage financing has become more efficient. Increasingly, early stage entrepreneurs are 
able to find individual investors, called angel investors, who will provide the initial capital 
to start their business. Angel investors are often rich, successful entrepreneurs themselves 
who are willing to help new companies get started in exchange for a share of the business.
In recent years the role of angel investors has changed, allowing start-ups to rely on 
angel financing for much longer into their life cycle. There are two reasons for this change. 
First, the number of angel investors has grown enormously, and within the angel com-
munity, angel groups have formed. An angel group is a group of angel investors who pool 
their money and decide as a group which investments to fund. The Angel Capital Associa-
tion lists over 400 angel groups on its Web site and estimates that the typical angel group 
had 42 members and invested an average of $2.42 million in 9.8 deals per year in 2013.1 
In addition it estimates that there are over 100,000 individuals making angel investments 
in any given year.
The second, and perhaps more important, reason for the growth in importance of angel 
financing is that the cost of setting up a business has dropped dramatically. Twenty years 
ago a new company would have to make relatively large capital investments in servers, 
databases, and other back office technologies. Today, almost all of these functions can be 
outsourced, allowing individuals to start and grow their businesses with much less capital.
Angel financing often occurs at such an early stage in the business that it is difficult 
to assess a value for the firm. Angel investors often circumvent this problem by hold-
ing a ­convertible note rather than equity. In a typical deal, in exchange for their invest-
ment, angels receive a note that is convertible into equity when the company finances with 
equity for the first time. The note holders convert the value of their initial investment plus 
accrued interest into equity at a discount (often 20%) to the price paid by new investors. 
Structuring the deal in this way allows angels and entrepreneurs to agree on terms without 
agreeing on a value for the firm, instead postponing the valuation until the firm is more 
mature and becomes attractive to venture capitalists.

Most Active U.S. Venture Capital Firms in 2015 
(by number of deals completed)
The typical size of an angel investment ranges from several hundred thousand dollars for 
individual investors to a few million dollars for angel groups. Although the pool of capital 
available from angel financing continues to grow, most firms’ financing needs eventually 
reach the point that they need to tap into larger funding sources, such as venture capital.
Venture Capital Firms.  A venture capital firm is a limited partnership that specializes in 
raising money to invest in the private equity of young firms. Table 23.1 lists the 12 most 
active U.S. venture capital firms in 2015, based on the number of deals completed.
Typically, institutional investors, such as pension funds, are the limited partners. The 
general partners run the venture capital firm; they are called venture capitalists. Venture 
capital firms offer limited partners a number of advantages over investing directly in start-
ups themselves. Venture firms invest in many start-ups, so limited partners get the benefit 
Crowdfunding: The Wave of the Future?
The last 10 years has seen growth in an entirely new kind 
of funding for start-ups, known as crowdfunding, in which 
the firm raises very small amounts of money from a large 
number of people. Investment levels can be minute, in some 
cases less than $100.
Historically in the U.S., the SEC has enforced strict rules 
that only allowed “qualified investors” (investors with a high 
net worth) to invest in private equity issues. These rules effec-
tively barred U.S. crowdfunding sites from offering equity to 
investors. As a result, companies like Kickstarter and Indiegogo 
offered investors other payoffs such as the products the com-
pany would ultimately produce. In many cases these “financ-
ing” contracts looked more like advanced purchase orders.
However, in 2012 the landscape changed dramati-
cally when Congress passed the JOBS Act that exempted 
crowdfunding from the historical restrictions on private 
equity investments. The act allowed equity investment by 
non-qualified individuals so long as the crowdfunding sites 
did not charge a commission for the transaction. In the 
wake of this act, a number of equity-based platforms such 
as AngelList emerged that charged fees based on the per-
formance of the investment. Recently the SEC announced 
specific restrictions on the size of an equity investment via 
crowdfunding. For example, in any year, companies may 
raise no more than $1 million through crowdfunding, and 
individuals whose annual income or net worth is less than 
$100,000 can invest no more than $2000, or up to 5% 
of their annual income or net worth (whichever is less) in 
crowdfunding-based equity.

fruition. Early indicators are that it will 
likely converge with early stage venture 
returns.
QUESTION: Is angel investing only for 
wealthy investors with domain exper-
tise?  Or is it accessible/attractive even for 
smaller investors?
ANSWER: Currently, active angel 
investing with large checks is still for 
wealthy investors with domain exper-
tise. Although a typical angel check is 
$25,000, the risk profile of each indi-
vidual investment is such that you want 
30 to 50 investments in a good portfolio. �You also need 
domain expertise to recognize good deals and be familiar 
enough with the management team and markets to move 
quickly.
While angel investing is still an asset class for sophis-
ticated investors, it no longer requires as much wealth or 
start-up experience to participate.  Services like AngelList 
allow investors to invest as little as $1,000 per company 
across hundreds of companies behind the wealthy, experi-
enced investors. This means that the standard for wealth 
has dropped (because your friends can combine their 
money with yours to make the appropriate check size), 
plus by investing behind experienced investors you can 
get access without having the same expertise. That has 
­broadened the investor base significantly.
QUESTION: On what basis do angel investors make the deci-
sion to invest?
ANSWER: Team, traction, and social proof, in that 
order, based on a recent study I co-authored with 
­several ­economists. The characteristics of the founding 
team were the most important factor, followed by how 
much ­progress the company had made (which varies by 
industry—­downloads, paying customers, pre-orders, etc.). 
The third factor, social proof, is who else is involved as 
investor or advisor to the company. When you are writing 
small checks for companies whose most likely failure rea-
son is “running out of cash too soon,” you want to be sure 
you’re investing with many other investors. A ­successful 
investor is a lot more likely to be followed by other inves-
tors than an unknown one, much as investors buy a stock 
after Warren Buffett does. Investing in a company that 
only manages to raise your $25,000 will lose you money 
for certain, no matter how “right” you were about its 
product or market.

can meet investors and recruit talent.
QUESTION: How has angel investing 
changed over the last decade?
ANSWER: Historically, angel investors 
typically grouped together in regions 
and markets not well covered by venture 
capital (VC) or would dispense cash 
along with advice at the earliest stages 
of a few technology companies. Often 
investors viewed funding start-ups as a sideline rather than 
a full-time business.
The cost of starting a technology company today has 
dropped significantly. Cloud services, social marketing, 
Search Engine Optimization, and other platforms and 
tools allow entrepreneurs to launch for $500,000 rather 
than $5 million. Because venture investors prefer to invest 
several million dollars, angels are now the dominant form 
of fundraising for the earliest (seed stage) cash needs of the 
company.
QUESTION: How has angel investing affected the venture 
capital industry?
ANSWER: The lines between angel investing and venture 
capital are blurring. Today’s angels ask for terms they 
didn’t when angel investing was more of a hobby—for 
example, pro rata investment rights (to maintain their level 
of percentage ownership during later financing rounds) and 
information rights. The venture industry is adjusting to a 
host of new players and is responding primarily by ceding 
the earliest stage markets to angel investors and engaging at 
Series A (the first round of financing after seed capital) and 
beyond.
QUESTION: How do the returns from angel investing compare 
with other investment classes?
ANSWER: Historically, angel investing encompassed 
a wide range of investments (from investing in your 
nephew’s doomed dry cleaner to early Google investors), 
making it hard to define the returns. An Angel Capital 
Association’s study found that returns of more “profes-
sional” angel investors outstripped venture capital investor 
returns. It is too early to say whether that will continue 
as angel investing in technology jumps dramatically, 
because most investments take 7 to 10 years to come to

of this diversification. More importantly, limited partners also benefit from the exper-
tise of the general partners. However, these advantages come at a cost—general partners 
charge substantial fees to run the firm. In addition to an annual management fee of about 
1.5%–2.5% of the fund’s committed capital, general partners also take a share of any posi-
tive return generated by the fund in a fee referred to as carried interest. Most firms charge 
20%, but some take up to 30%, of any profits as carried interest.
The importance of the venture capital sector has grown enormously in the last 50 years. 
As Figure 23.1 shows, growth in the sector increased in the 1990s and peaked at the height 
of the Internet boom. Although the size of the industry decreased substantially in the 
2000s, it has since recovered to the level it was in the late 1990s.
Venture capital firms can provide substantial capital for young companies. For example, 
in 2015, venture capital firms invested $58.8 billion in 4380 separate deals, for an average 
investment of about $13.4 million per deal. In return, venture capitalists often demand a 
great deal of control. Professors Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner2 report that venture capi-
talists typically control about one-third of the seats on a start-up’s board of directors, and 
often represent the single largest  voting block on the board. Although entrepreneurs gen-
erally view this control as a necessary cost of obtaining venture capital, it can actually be an 
important benefit of accepting venture financing. Venture capitalists use their control to

protect their investments; therefore, they may perform a key nurturing and monitoring 
role for the firm. Professors Shai Bernstein, Xavier Giroud, and Richard Townsend found 
that when a direct flight between the location of the key venture capitalist and the firm is 
introduced, making it easier to do this nurturing, the firm does better.3
Private Equity Firms.  A private equity firm is organized very much like a venture capital 
firm, but it invests in the equity of existing privately held firms rather than start-up compa-
nies. Often, private equity firms initiate their investment by finding a publicly traded firm 
and purchasing the outstanding equity, thereby taking the company private in a transac-
tion called a leveraged buyout (LBO). In most cases, the private equity firms use debt as 
well as equity to finance the purchase.
Private equity firms share the advantages of venture capital firms, and also charge 
similar fees. One key difference between private equity and venture capital is the mag-
nitude invested. For example, Figure 23.2 shows that the total LBO transaction volume 
in 2006–2007 (the peak of the private equity market) was nearly $700 billion, with an 
average deal size of $250 million. Table 23.2 lists the top 10 private equity funds in 
2015 based on the total amount of investment capital each firm raised over the last five 
years.
Institutional Investors.  Institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance compa-
nies, endowments, and foundations manage large quantities of money. They are major 
investors in many different types of assets, so, not surprisingly, they are also active inves-
tors in private companies. Institutional investors may invest directly in private firms, 
or they may invest indirectly by becoming limited partners in venture capital or private 
equity firms. Institutional interest in private equity has grown dramatically in recent years. 
For example, in 2015, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) 
reported that it had $29 billion of its $302 billion portfolio invested in private equity, with 
another $12 billion in capital committed to the sector.

Chapter 23  Raising Equity Capital
Corporate Investors.  Many established corporations purchase equity in younger, pri-
vate companies. A corporation that invests in private companies is called many different 
names, including corporate investor, corporate partner, strategic partner, and strategic 
investor. Most of the other types of investors in private firms that we have considered so 
far are primarily interested in the financial return that they will earn on their investments. 
Corporate investors, by contrast, might invest for corporate strategic objectives in addi-
tion to the desire for investment returns. For example, in May 2009, automaker Daimler 
invested $50 million for a 10% equity stake in electric car maker Tesla as part of a strategic 
collaboration on the development of lithium-ion battery systems, electric drive systems, 
and individual vehicle projects.
Venture Capital Investing
When a company founder decides to sell equity to outside investors for the first time, it is 
common practice for private companies to issue preferred stock rather than common stock 
to raise capital. Preferred stock issued by mature companies usually has preferential divi-
dend, liquidation, or voting rights relative to common shareholders. While the preferred 
stock issued by young companies typically does not pay regular cash dividends, it usually 
gives the owner the option to convert it into common stock, and so is called convertible 
preferred stock. If the company runs into financial difficulties, the preferred stockholders 
have a senior claim on the assets of the firm relative to any common stockholders (who are 
often the employees of the firm). If things go well, then these investors will convert their 
preferred stock and receive all the rights and benefits of common stockholders.
Each time the firm raises money is referred to as a funding round, and each round will 
have its own set of securities with special terms and provisions. After a potential initial 
“seed round,” it is common to name the securities alphabetically, starting with Series A, 
Series B, etc.
For example, RealNetworks, which was founded by Robert Glaser in 1993, was ­initially 
funded with an investment of approximately $1 million by Glaser. As of April 1995, 
­Glaser’s $1 million initial investment in RealNetworks represented 13,713,439 shares 
of Series A preferred stock, implying an initial purchase price of about $0.07 per share. 
­RealNetworks needed more capital, and management decided to raise this money by 
­selling equity in the form of convertible preferred stock.

Funding and Ownership
Problem
You founded your own firm two years ago. Initially, you contributed $100,000 of your money 
and, in return, received 1,500,000 shares of stock. Since then, you have sold an additional 
500,000 shares to angel investors. You are now considering raising even more capital from a ven-
ture capitalist. The venture capitalist has agreed to invest $6 million with a post-money valuation 
of $10 million for the firm. Assuming that this is the venture capitalist’s first investment in your 
company, what percentage of the firm will she end up owning? What percentage will you own? 
What is the value of your shares?
Solution
Because the VC will invest $6 million out of the $10 million post-money valuation, her own-
ership percentage is 6/10 = 60%. From Eq. 23.1, the pre-money valuation is 10 - 6 = $4 
million. As there are 2 million pre-money shares outstanding, this implies a share price of 
$4 million/2 million shares = $2 per share. Thus, the VC will receive 3 million shares for her 
investment, and after this funding round, there will be a total of 5,000,000 shares outstanding. 
You will own 1,500,000/5,000,000 = 30% of the firm, and the post-transaction valuation of 
your shares is $3 million.
The Series B preferred shares were new shares of stock being sold by RealNetworks. 
At the price the new shares were sold for, Glaser’s shares were worth $9.2 million and 
represented 83.6% of the outstanding shares. The value of the prior shares outstanding 
at the price in the funding round ($9.2 million in this example) is called the pre-money 
valuation. The value of the whole firm (old plus new shares) at the funding round price 
($11.0 million) is known as the post-money valuation. The difference between the pre- 
and post-money valuation is the amount invested. In other words,
	
Post@money Valuation = Pre@money Valuation + Amount Invested
(23.1)
In addition, the fractional ownership held by the new investors is equal to
	
Percentage Ownership = Amount Invested/Post@money Valuation
(23.2)

In each case, investors bought preferred stock in the private company. These investors were 
very similar to the profile of typical investors in private firms that we described earlier. Angel 
investors purchased the Series B stock. The investors in Series C and D stock were primarily 
venture capital funds. Microsoft purchased the Series E stock as a corporate investor.
Venture Capital Financing Terms
As we have already pointed out, outside investors generally receive convertible preferred 
stock. When things go well these securities will ultimately convert to common stock and so 
all investors are treated equally. But when they don’t, these securities generally give prefer-
ence to outside investors. Here are some typical features these securities have:
Liquidation Preference.  The liquidation preference specifies a minimum amount that 
must be paid to these security holders—before any payments to common stockholders—in 
the event of a liquidation, sale, or merger of the company. It is typically set to between 1 
and 3 times the value of the initial investment.
Seniority.  It is not uncommon for investors in later rounds to demand seniority over 
investors in earlier rounds, to ensure that they are repaid first. When later round investors 
accept securities with equal priority, they are said to be pari passu.
Participation Rights.  Holders of convertible shares without participation rights must 
choose between demanding their liquidation preference or converting their shares to

Over the next few years, RealNetworks raised three more rounds of outside equity in 
addition to the Series B funding round. Note the increase in the amount of capital raised 
as the company matured:
Misinterpreting Start-Up Valuations
When a new valuation round occurs, it is common in the 
popular press to quote the post-money valuation as the 
­“current value” of the company. Recall that the post-money 
valuation is calculated as the share price in the round times 
the total number of shares outstanding assuming all pre-
ferred shareholders convert their shares. But although the 
post-money valuation for a private firm is a similar calcula-
tion to the market capitalization of a public company, there 
is an important difference: While most shareholders of a 
public company hold the same securities, that is typically 
not the case for start-ups, where the terms in each funding 
round can differ substantially. As a result, the post-money 
value can be misleading.
Consider, for example, a start-up whose prior funding 
round closed at $3 per share with a post-money value of $300 
million (and so has 100 million shares outstanding). They are 
now looking to raise $100 million to expand their operations. 
Suppose investors are willing to pay $8.50 per share if the 
series has a 1x liquidation preference and equal priority, but 
will pay $10 per share if the series has a 3x liquidation prefer-
ence and is senior. Thus, depending on the terms, the post-
money value will be either $950 ­million or $1.1 billion; some 
firms might choose the latter in order to enjoy the publicity of 
achieving so-called unicorn status (start-ups with valuations 
over $1 billion). Obviously, the actual value of the company 
does not depend on the liquidation rights of its investors.
In reality, the higher post-money valuation achieved 
by providing better terms to the new investors is artificial: 
While the new shares are worth $10 per share, the old shares 
are not. This scenario can also create a serious conflict of 
interest—if in the future the firm were to receive an acquisi-
tion offer for $400 million, the new investors would receive 
a 300% return (having priority for their liquidation pref-
erence of $300 million), while earlier investors would split 
the remaining $100 million, and founders and employees 
would likely receive little or nothing.
Common Mistake

	
23.1  Equity Financing for Private Companies	
869
Example 23.2
 
Problem
Suppose that in addition to common shares, your firm raised $6 million in Series A financing with 
a 1x liquidation preference, no participation rights, and a $20 million post-money valuation, and 
$10 million in Series B financing with a 3x liquidation preference, no participation rights, and a 
$40 million post-money valuation, with Series B senior to Series A. If you sell the firm after the 
Series B financing, what is the minimum sale price such that common shareholders will receive 
anything? What is the minimum sale price such that all investors will convert their shares?
Solution
Series B has a liquidation preference of 3 * 10 = $30 million, and Series A has a liquidation 
preference of 1 * 6 = $6 million. Therefore, for a sale price of $30 million or less, only Series 
B will be paid, and any additional amount up to $36 million will be paid to Series A. Common 
shareholders will receive nothing unless the share price exceeds $36 million.
Because the Series B investors will receive up to 3x their investment from their liquidation 
preference, they will not be willing to convert their shares to common (and forfeit their liquida-
tion preference) unless the value of the firm has at least tripled from the time of their invest-
ment, or a sale price of 3 * 40 = $120 million. At that price, because Series B investors own 
10/40 = 25% of the firm, they will receive 25% * 120 = $30 million as common shareholders 
and so are just willing to convert. Series A investors own 6/20 = 30% of the remaining shares, 
and so receive 30% * 75% * 120 = $27 million (and so will also convert), and the remaining 
120 - 30 - 27 = $63 million goes to common shareholders.
common stock and forfeiting their liquidation preference and other rights. Participation 
rights allow the investors to “double dip” and receive both their liquidation preference 
and any payments to common shareholders as though they had converted their shares. 
Often, these participation rights are capped once the investor receives 2–3 times their ini-
tial investment (when there is no cap, the securities are referred to as fully participating).
Anti-Dilution Protection.  If things are not going well and the firm raises new funding 
at a lower price than in a prior round, it is referred to as a “down round.” Anti-dilution 
protection lowers the price at which investors in earlier rounds can convert their shares to 
common, effectively increasing their ownership percentage in a down round at the expense 
of founders and employees.5
Board Membership.  New investors may also negotiate the right to appoint one or more 
members to the board of directors of the firm as a way of securing control rights.
All of these provisions are negotiable, and so the actual terms in each funding round 
will depend on the relative bargaining power between the firm and the new investors at 
the time. For example, in a selection of Silicon Valley start-ups in 2014–2015, new inves-
tors obtained seniority about 30% of the time in up rounds, but more than 50% of the 
time in down rounds. Similarly, while only about 25% of funding rounds gave inves-
tors ­participation rights, almost 50% received them in down rounds. Over 80% of deals 
include anti-dilution protection, though the exact form of protection varies.6 Because of 
these protections, prior to conversion, preferred shares are generally worth more than the 
firm’s common stock and the true value of each series may differ.
5The simplest form is full ratchet protection, which adjusts old investors’ conversion price to match that of 
new investors. The most common form is broad-based weighted average protection, which resets the conver-
sion price to a weighted average of the old and new price.

From Launch to Liquidity
This chart illustrates the life cycle of a typical successful start-
up firm from first launch to its exit as a public firm via an 
initial public offering. The chart shows changes in the firm 
valuation as well changes in the distribution of ownership 
through each funding round. Our representative firm begins 
with an idea and two cofounders, who raise $500,000 from 
an angel investor in exchange for 20% of the company. Six 
months later they have a first prototype and receive $2 mil-
lion in VC seed funding with a pre-money valuation of 
$6 million. As part of this round they create an employee 
option pool with 15% of the shares, which they can use to 
attract new employees and fill out their executive team.
Within a year they have their first customer, and raise 
$6 million in a Series A round for a post-money value of 
$18 million. At this point the founders each hold 16% of 
the firm’s shares, and are sharing control with their VC back-
ers. As the product continues to gain traction and the com-
pany grows, they raise $15 million, then $25 million, and 
finally $50 million in three funding rounds over the next 
4 years, watching their valuation grow from $18 ­million to 
$200 million. With each round, they top up their employee 
option pool to 10% so they can retain and recruit top talent.
After 9 years, the company has established itself as a 
market leader, is consistently profitable, and undertakes

an IPO in which it raises $200 million with an opening 
market cap of $2.2 billion. At this point the founders hold 
5.5% of the company and their shares are each valued at 
$121 million.
While the figure illustrates a “typical” path of a success-
ful firm, it is important to remember that not all start-ups 
succeed. The top of the chart shows an estimate of the pro-
portion of firms at each stage: VCs will hear thousands of 
pitches before selecting 100 for seed funding. Of those, only 
56 survive to raise a follow-up Series A round, and the pool 
continues to shrink leaving only 4 of the original 100 to 
go public. So, while in this example the Series A investors 
earned 11.4% * $2.2 billion = $250 million or 42 times 
their initial investment, their expected multiple of money 
must take into account that only a small proportion of their 
investments ever have a successful exit. In this case, if we 
assume they do not recover anything on their unsuccess-
ful investments, their expected money multiple would only 
be 4/56 * 42 = 3x, corresponding to a 31/7 - 1 = 17% 
expected annual return over their 7-year investment.

Chapter 23  Raising Equity Capital
Exiting an Investment in a Private Company
Over time, the value of a share of RealNetworks’ stock and the size of its funding rounds 
increased. Because investors in Series E were willing to pay $8.99 for a share of preferred 
stock with essentially equivalent rights in July 1997, the valuation of existing preferred 
stock had increased significantly, representing a substantial capital gain for early investors. 
Because RealNetworks was still a private company, however, investors could not liquidate 
their investment by selling their stock in the public stock markets.
An important consideration for investors in private companies is their exit strategy—
how they will eventually realize the return from their investment. Investors exit in two 
main ways: through an acquisition or through a public offering. Often, large corporations 
purchase successful start-up companies. In such a case, the acquiring company purchases 
the outstanding stock of the private company, allowing all investors to cash out. Roughly 
88% of venture capital exits from 2002–2012 occurred through mergers or acquisitions 
with typical deal sizes in the range of $100 million to $150 million.6
The alternative way to provide liquidity to its investors is for the company to become a 
publicly traded company, which we discuss next.

2.	 What types of securities do VCs hold, and what protections do they have?
	
23.2	 The Initial Public Offering
The process of selling stock to the public for the first time is called an initial public 
offering (IPO). In this section, we look at the mechanics of IPOs and discuss some related 
puzzles.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Going Public
The two advantages of going public are greater liquidity and better access to capital. By 
going public, companies give their private equity investors the ability to diversify. In addi-
tion, public companies typically have access to much larger amounts of capital through the 
public markets, both in the initial public offering and in subsequent offerings. For exam-
ple, Table 23.3 shows the largest U.S. IPOs with proceeds in excess of $5 billion (as of 
Fall 2015). Of course, most IPOs are smaller, with a median size of $100 million in 2014. 
In RealNetworks’ case, its last round of private equity funding raised about $30 million 
in July 1997. The firm raised $43 million when it went public in November of the same 
year; less than two years later, it raised an additional $267 million by selling more stock to 
the public. Thus, as a public company, RealNetworks was able to raise substantially more 
money than it did as a private firm.
The major advantage of undertaking an IPO is also one of the major disadvantages 
of an IPO: When investors diversify their holdings, the equity holders of the corpora-
tion become more widely dispersed. This lack of ownership concentration undermines 
investors’ ability to monitor the company’s management, and investors may discount the 
price they are willing to pay to reflect the loss of control. Moreover, several high-profile 
corporate scandals during the early part of the twenty-first century prompted tougher

regulations designed to address corporate abuses. Organizations such as the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC), the securities exchanges (including the New York 
Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ), and Congress (through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002 and other legislation) adopted new standards that focused on more thorough finan-
cial disclosure, greater accountability, and more stringent requirements for the board of 
directors. These standards, in general, were designed to provide better protection for 
investors. However, compliance with the new standards is costly and time-consuming 
for public companies.
Types of Offerings
After deciding to go public, managers of the company work with an underwriter, an 
investment banking firm that manages the offering and designs its structure. Choices 
include the type of shares to be sold and the mechanism the financial advisor will use to 
sell the stock.
Primary and Secondary Offerings.  At an IPO, a firm offers a large block of shares for sale 
to the public for the first time. The shares that are sold in the IPO may either be new shares 
that raise new capital, known as a primary offering, or existing shares that are sold by cur-
rent shareholders (as part of their exit strategy), known as a secondary offering.
Best-Efforts, Firm Commitment, and Auction IPOs.  For smaller IPOs, the underwriter 
commonly accepts the deal on a best-efforts IPO basis. In this case, the underwriter does 
not guarantee that the stock will be sold, but instead tries to sell the stock for the best pos-
sible price. Often, such deals have an all-or-none clause: either all of the shares are sold in 
the IPO, or the deal is called off.
More commonly, an underwriter and an issuing firm agree to a firm commitment 
IPO, in which the underwriter guarantees that it will sell all of the stock at the offer price. 
The underwriter purchases the entire issue (at a slightly lower price than the offer price) 
and then resells it at the offer price. If the entire issue does not sell out, the underwriter is 
on the hook: The remaining shares must be sold at a lower price and the underwriter must

Auction IPO Pricing
Problem
Fleming Educational Software, Inc., is selling 500,000 shares of stock in an auction IPO. At the 
end of the bidding period, Fleming’s investment bank has received the following bids:
What will the offer price of the shares be?
Solution
First, we compute the total number of shares demanded at or above any given price:
For example, the company has received bids for a total of 125,000 shares at $7.75 per share or 
higher (25,000 + 100,000 = 125,000).

take the loss. The most notorious loss in the industry happened when the British govern-
ment privatized British Petroleum. In a highly unusual deal, the company was taken public 
gradually. The British government sold its final stake in British Petroleum at the time of 
the October 1987 stock market crash. The offer price was set just before the crash, but 
the offering occurred after the crash.7 At the end of the first day’s trading, the underwrit-
ers were facing a loss of $1.29 billion. The price then fell even further, until the Kuwaiti 
Investment Office stepped in and purchased a large stake in the company.
In the late 1990s, the investment banking firm of WR Hambrecht and Company 
attempted to change the IPO process by selling new issues directly to the public using 
an online auction IPO mechanism called OpenIPO. Rather than setting the price itself 
in the traditional way, Hambrecht lets the market determine the price of the stock by 
auctioning off the company. Investors place bids over a set period of time. An auction 
IPO then sets the highest price such that the number of bids at or above that price 
equals the number of offered shares. All winning bidders pay this price, even if their bid 
was higher. The first OpenIPO was the $11.55 million IPO for Ravenswood Winery, 
completed in 1999.
7This deal was exceptional in that the offer price was determined more than a week before the issue date. 
In the United States, the underwriter usually sets the final offer price within a day of the IPO date.

	
23.2  The Initial Public Offering	
875
In 2004, Google went public using the auction mechanism, generating substantial 
interest in this alternative. In May 2005, Morningstar raised $140 million in its IPO using 
a Hambrecht OpenIPO auction.8 But although the auction IPO mechanism seems to 
­represent a viable alternative to traditional IPO procedures, it has not been widely adopted 
either in the United States or abroad. After completing fewer than 30 transactions between 
1999 and 2008, Hambrecht has completed only one other auction IPO since.
The Mechanics of an IPO
The traditional IPO process follows a standardized form. In this section, we explore the 
steps that underwriters go through during an IPO.
Underwriters and the Syndicate.  Many IPOs, especially the larger offerings, are man-
aged by a group of underwriters. The lead underwriter is the primary banking firm 
responsible for managing the deal. The lead underwriter provides most of the advice and 
Google’s IPO
On April 29, 2004, Google, Inc., announced plans to go 
public. Breaking with tradition, Google startled Wall Street 
by declaring its intention to rely heavily on the auction IPO 
mechanism for distributing its shares. Google had been 
profitable since 2001, so, according to Google executives, 
access to capital was not the only motive to go public. The 
company also wanted to provide employees and private 
equity investors with liquidity.
One of the major attractions of the auction mechanism 
was the possibility of allocating shares to more individual 
investors. Google also hoped to discourage short-term spec-
ulation by letting market bidders set the IPO price. After 
the Internet stock market boom, there were many lawsuits 
related to the way underwriters allocated shares. Google 
hoped to avoid the allocation scandals by letting the auction 
allocate shares.
Investors who wanted to bid opened a brokerage account 
with one of the deal’s underwriters and then placed their 
bids with the brokerage house. Google and its underwriters 
identified the highest bid that allowed the company to sell 
all of the shares being offered. They also had the flexibility 
to choose to offer shares at a lower price.
On August 18, 2004, Google sold 19.6 million shares at 
$85 per share. At the time, the $1.67 billion raised was eas-
ily the largest auction IPO ever in the United States. Google 
stock (ticker: GOOG) opened trading on the NASDAQ 
market the next day at $100 per share. Although the Google 
IPO sometimes stumbled along the way, it represented the 
most significant example of the use of the auction mecha-
nism as an alternative to the traditional IPO mechanism.

Rules,” The Wall Street Journal, April 30, 2004, p. C1; R. Simon and E.

Journal, April 30, 2004, p. C1; and G. Zuckerman, “Google Shares Prove 
Big Winners—for a Day,” The Wall Street Journal, August 20, 2004, p. C1.
Fleming is offering a total of 500,000 shares. The winning auction price would be $7 per 
share, because investors have placed orders for a total of 500,000 shares at a price of $7 or higher. 
All investors who placed bids of at least this price will be able to buy the stock for $7 per share, 
even if their initial bid was higher.
In this example, the cumulative demand at the winning price exactly equals the supply. If 
total demand at this price were greater than the supply, all auction participants who bid prices 
higher than the winning price would receive their full bid (at the winning price). Shares would be 
awarded on a pro rata basis to bidders who bid exactly the winning price.

arranges for a group of other underwriters, called the syndicate, to help market and sell 
the issue. Table 23.4 shows the underwriters who were responsible for the largest number 
of IPOs in the United States during 2014. As you can see, the major investment and com-
mercial banks dominate the underwriting business, with the top 10 firms capturing about 
one-half of the total market. The data for 2013–2014 also reveal a strong turnaround from 
2008, when the aggregate number of issues was a paltry 29, with only $26 billion raised.
Underwriters market the IPO, and they help the company with all the necessary filings. 
More importantly, they actively participate in determining the offer price. In many cases, 
the underwriter will also commit to making a market in the stock after the issue, thereby 
guaranteeing that the stock will be liquid.
SEC Filings.  The SEC requires that companies prepare a registration statement, a legal 
document that provides financial and other information about the company to investors, 
prior to an IPO. Company managers work closely with the underwriters to prepare this reg-
istration statement and submit it to the SEC. Part of the registration statement, called the 
preliminary prospectus or red herring, circulates to investors before the stock is offered.
The SEC reviews the registration statement to make sure that the company has disclosed 
all of the information necessary for investors to decide whether to purchase the stock. Once 
the company has satisfied the SEC’s disclosure requirements, the SEC approves the stock 
for sale to the general public. The company prepares the final registration statement and 
final prospectus containing all the details of the IPO, including the number of shares 
offered and the offer price.9

for the final prospectus for RealNetworks’ IPO. This cover page includes the name of the

Valuation.  Before the offer price is set, the underwriters work closely with the company 
to come up with a price range that they believe provides a reasonable valuation for the 
firm using the techniques described in Chapter 9. As we pointed out in that chapter, there 
are two ways to value a company: estimate the future cash flows and compute the pres-
ent value, or estimate the value by examining comparable companies. Most underwriters 
use both techniques. However, when these techniques give substantially different answers, 
they often rely on comparables based on recent IPOs.

Chapter 23  Raising Equity Capital
Once an initial price range is established, the underwriters try to determine what the 
market thinks of the valuation. They begin by arranging a road show, in which senior 
management and the lead underwriters travel around the country (and sometimes around 
the world) promoting the company and explaining their rationale for the offer price to the 
underwriters’ largest customers—mainly institutional investors such as mutual funds and 
pension funds.
Example 23.4
Valuing an IPO Using Comparables
Problem
Wagner, Inc. is a private company that designs, manufactures, and distributes branded consumer 
products. During the most recent fiscal year, Wagner had revenues of $325 million and earnings 
of $15 million. Wagner has filed a registration statement with the SEC for its IPO. Before the 
stock is offered, Wagner’s investment bankers would like to estimate the value of the company 
using comparable companies. The investment bankers have assembled the following information 
based on data for other companies in the same industry that have recently gone public. In each 
case, the ratios are based on the IPO price.
After the IPO, Wagner will have 20 million shares outstanding. Estimate the IPO price for Wag-
ner using the price/earnings ratio and the price/revenues ratio.
Solution
If the IPO price of Wagner is based on a price/earnings ratio that is similar to those for recent 
IPOs, then this ratio will equal the mean of recent deals, or 21.2. Given earnings of $15 million, 
the total market value of Wagner’s stock will be ($15 million)(21.2) = $318 million. With 20 
million shares outstanding, the price per share should be $15.90.
Similarly, if Wagner’s IPO price implies a price/revenues ratio equal to the recent aver-
age of 0.9, then using its revenues of $325 million, the total market value of Wagner will be 
($325 million)(0.9) = $292.5 million, or ($292.5 million/20) = $14.63 per share.
Based on these estimates, the underwriters will probably establish an initial price range for 
Wagner stock of $13 to $17 per share to take on the road show.

At the end of the road show, customers inform the underwriters of their interest by 
telling the underwriters how many shares they may want to purchase. Although these com-
mitments are nonbinding, the underwriters’ customers value their long-term relationships 
with the underwriters, so they rarely go back on their word. The underwriters then add 
up the total demand and adjust the price until it is unlikely that the issue will fail. This 
process for coming up with the offer price based on customers’ expressions of interest is 
called book building.
Because no offer price is set in an auction IPO, book building is not as important in that 
venue as it is in traditional IPOs. Professors Ravi Jagannathan and Ann Sherman examined 
why auctions have failed to become a popular IPO method and have been plagued by inac-
curate pricing and poor aftermarket performance. They suggest that, since auctions do not

use the book-building process which aids in price discovery, investors are discouraged from 
participating in auctions.10
Pricing the Deal and Managing Risk.  In the RealNetworks’ IPO, the final offer price 
was $12.50 per share.11 Also, the company agreed to pay the underwriters a fee, called an 
underwriting spread, of $0.875 per share—exactly 7% of the issue price. Because this 
was a firm commitment deal, the underwriters bought the stock from RealNetworks for 
$12.50 - $0.875 = $11.625 per share and then resold it to their ­customers for $12.50 
per share.
Recall that when an underwriter provides a firm commitment, it is potentially expos-
ing itself to the risk that the banking firm might have to sell the shares at less than the 
offer price and take a loss. However, according to Tim Loughran and Jay Ritter, between 
1990 and 1998, just 9% of U.S. IPOs experienced a fall in share price on the first day.12 
For another 16% of firms, the price at the end of the first day was the same as the offer 
price. Therefore, the vast majority of IPOs experienced a price increase on the first day of 
trading, indicating that the initial offer price was generally lower than the price that stock 
market investors were willing to pay.
Underwriters appear to use the information they acquire during the book-building 
stage to intentionally underprice the IPO, thereby reducing their exposure to losses.
Furthermore, once the issue price (or offer price) is set, underwriters may invoke 
another mechanism to protect themselves against a loss—the over-allotment alloca-
tion, or greenshoe provision.13 This option allows the underwriter to issue more stock, 
amounting to 15% of the original offer size, at the IPO offer price. Look at footnote 
4 on the front page of the RealNetworks’ prospectus in Figure 23.3. This footnote is a 
greenshoe provision.
Let’s illustrate how underwriters use the greenshoe provision to protect themselves 
against a loss and thereby manage risk. The RealNetworks’ prospectus specified that 3 
million shares would be offered at $12.50 per share. In addition, the greenshoe provision 
allowed for the issue of an additional 450,000 shares at $12.50 per share. Underwriters 
initially market both the initial and the greenshoe allotment—in RealNetworks’ case, 
the $12.50 per share price is set so that all 3.45 million shares are expected to sell—and 
thereby “short sell” the greenshoe allotment. Then, if the issue is a success, the under-
writer exercises the greenshoe option, covering its short position. If the issue is not a 
success and its price falls, the underwriter covers the short position by repurchasing the 
greenshoe allotment (450,000 shares in the RealNetworks’ IPO) in the aftermarket, 
thereby supporting the price.14
Once the IPO process is complete, the company’s shares trade publicly on an exchange. 
The lead underwriter usually makes a market in the stock and assigns an analyst to cover it. 
By doing so, the underwriter increases the liquidity of the stock in the secondary market.

14R. Aggarwal, “Stabilization Activities by Underwriters After IPOs,” Journal of Finance 55(3) (2000): 
1075–1103, finds that underwriters initially oversell by an average of 10.75% and then cover themselves 
if necessary using the greenshoe option.

Chapter 23  Raising Equity Capital
This service is of value to both the issuing company and the underwriter’s customers. A 
liquid market ensures that investors who purchased shares via the IPO are able to easily 
trade those shares. If the stock is actively traded, the issuer will have continued access to 
the equity markets in the event that the company decides to issue more shares in a new 
offering. In most cases, the preexisting shareholders are subject to a 180-day lockup; they 
cannot sell their shares for 180 days after the IPO. Once the lockup period expires, they are 
free to sell their shares.

23.3	 IPO Puzzles
Four characteristics of IPOs puzzle financial economists and are relevant for the financial 
manager:
	
1.	 On average, IPOs appear to be underpriced: The price at the end of trading on the 
first day is often substantially higher than the IPO price.
	
2.	 The number of issues is highly cyclical: When times are good, the market is flooded 
with new issues; when times are bad, the number of issues dries up.
	
3.	 The costs of an IPO are very high, and it is unclear why firms willingly incur them.
	
4.	 The long-run performance of a newly public company (three to five years from the 
date of issue) is poor. That is, on average, a three- to five-year buy and hold strategy 
appears to be a bad investment.
We will now examine each of these puzzles that financial economists seek to understand.
Underpricing
Generally, underwriters set the issue price so that the average first-day return is positive. 
For RealNetworks, the underwriters offered the stock at an IPO price of $12.50 per share 
on November 21, 1997. RealNetworks’ stock opened trading on the NASDAQ market 
at a price of $19.375 per share, and it closed at the end of its first trading day at $17.875. 
Such performance is not atypical. On average, between 1960 and 2015, the price in the 
U.S. aftermarket was 17% higher at the end of the first day of trading. As is evident in 
Figure 23.4, the one-day average return for IPOs has historically been very large around 
the world.
Who benefits from the underpricing? We have already explained how the underwrit-
ers benefit by controlling their risk. Of course, investors who are able to buy stock from 
underwriters at the IPO price also gain from the first-day underpricing. Who bears the 
cost? The pre-IPO shareholders of the issuing firms. In effect, these owners are selling stock 
in their firm for less than they could get in the aftermarket.
So why do shareholders of issuing firms put up with this underpricing? A naive view 
is that they have no choice because a relatively small number of underwriters controls the 
market. In fact, this is unlikely to be the explanation. The industry, at least anecdotally, 
appears to be highly competitive. In addition, entrants offering cheaper alternatives to the 
traditional underwriting process, like WR Hambrecht, have not been very successful at 
gaining significant market share.

Example 23.5
IPO Investors and the Winner’s Curse
Problem
Thompson Brothers, a large underwriter, is offering its customers the following opportunity: 
Thompson will guarantee a piece of every IPO it is involved in. Suppose you are a customer. On 
each deal you must commit to buying 2000 shares. If the shares are available, you get them. If 
the deal is oversubscribed, your allocation of shares is rationed in proportion to the oversubscrip-
tion. Your market research shows that typically 80% of the time Thompson’s deals are oversub-
scribed 16 to 1 (there are 16 orders for every 1 order that can be filled), and this excess demand 
leads to a price increase on the first day of 20%. However, 20% of the time Thompson’s deals are 
not oversubscribed, and while Thompson supports the price in the market (by not exercising the 
greenshoe provision and instead buying back shares), on average the price tends to decline by 5% 
on the first day. Based on these statistics, what is the average underpricing of a Thompson IPO? 
What is your average return as an investor?
Solution
First, note that the average first-day return for Thompson Brothers deals is large: 0.8(20%) + 
0.2(-5%) = 15%. If ⁜Thompson had one IPO per month, after a year you would earn an annual 
return of 1.1512 - 1 = 435%!
In reality, you cannot earn this return. For successful IPOs you will earn a 20% return, but 
you will only receive 2000/16 = 125 shares. Assuming an average IPO price of $15 per share, 
your profit is
$15/share * (125 shares) * (20% return) = $375
Given the existence of underpricing, it might appear that investing in new IPOs 
would be a very lucrative deal. If the average one-day return is 17%, and you could 
invest in a new IPO at the beginning of every working day and sell your shares at the 
end of the day for 250 business days per year, your cumulative annual return would be 
(1.17)250 - 1 = 11,129,238,168,937,200,000%. Why don’t all investors do this?
The preceding calculation assumes that each day you can invest all of the proceeds of 
the previous day’s investment. However, when an IPO goes well, the demand for the stock 
exceeds the supply. (This is another way of saying that the stock is underpriced.) Thus, the 
allocation of shares for each investor is rationed. Conversely, when an IPO does not go well, 
demand at the issue price is weak, so all initial orders are filled completely. In this scenario, if 
you followed the strategy of reinvesting whatever you made on the last IPO in the next one, 
your orders would be completely filled when the stock price goes down, but you would be 
rationed when it goes up. This is a form of adverse selection referred to as the winner’s curse: 
You “win” (get all the shares you requested) when demand for the shares by others is low, 
and the IPO is more likely to perform poorly. This effect may be substantial enough so that 
the strategy of investing in every IPO does not even yield above-market returns, never mind 
the stratospheric number calculated above.15 Furthermore, this effect implies that it may be 
necessary for the underwriter to underprice its issues on average in order for less informed 
investors to be willing to participate in IPOs, as the following example demonstrates.
15This explanation was first proposed by K. Rock: “Why New Issues Are Underpriced,” Journal of Finan-
cial Economics 15(2) (1986): 197–212. See also M. Levis, “The Winner’s Curse Problem, Interest Costs 
and the Underpricing of Initial Public Offerings,” Economic Journal 100 (1990): 76–89.

	
23.3  IPO Puzzles

Cyclicality
Figure 23.5 shows the number and dollar volume of IPOs by year from 1975 to 2014. As 
the figure makes clear, the dollar volume of IPOs reached a peak in 1999–2000. An even 
more important feature of the data is the clear cycle pattern in the volume and number 
of issues. Sometimes, such as in 2000, the volume of IPOs is unprecedented by historical 
standards; yet, within a year or two, the volume of IPOs may decrease significantly. This 
cyclicality by itself is not particularly surprising. We would expect there to be a greater 
need for capital in times with more growth opportunities than in times with fewer growth 
For unsuccessful IPOs you will receive your full allocation of 2000 shares. Because these stocks 
tend to fall by 5%, your profit is
$15/share * (2000 shares) * (-5% return) = -$1500
Because 80% of Thompson’s IPOs are successful, your average profit is therefore
0.80($375) + 0.20(-$1500) = $0
That is, on average you are just breaking even! As this example shows, even though the average 
IPO may be profitable, because you receive a higher allocation of the less successful IPOs, your 
average return may be much lower. Also, if Thompson’s average underpricing were less than 
15%, uninformed investors would lose money and be unwilling to participate in its IPOs.

IPOs reached a peak in the late 1990s and is highly cyclical.

opportunities. What is surprising is the magnitude of the swings. It is very difficult to 
believe that the availability of growth opportunities and the need for capital changed so 
drastically between 2000 and 2003 as to cause a decline of more than 75% in the dol-
lar volume of new issues. It appears that the number of IPOs is not solely driven by the 
demand for capital. Sometimes firms and investors seem to favor IPOs; at other times firms 
appear to rely on alternative sources of capital and financial economists are not sure why.
Cost of an IPO
A typical spread—that is, the discount below the issue price at which the underwriter 
purchases the shares from the issuing firm—is 7% of the issue price. For an issue size of 
$50 million, this amounts to $3.5 million. By most standards, this fee is large, especially 
considering the additional cost to the firm associated with underpricing. As Figure 23.6 
shows, compared to other security issues, the total cost of issuing stock for the first time is 
substantially larger than the costs for other securities.
Even more puzzling is the seeming lack of sensitivity of fees to issue size. Although a 
large issue requires some additional effort, one would not expect the increased effort to be 
rewarded as lucratively. For example, Professors Hsuan-Chi Chen and Jay Ritter found that 
almost all issues ranging in size from $20 million to $80 million paid fees of about 7%.16 
During the 2008 financial crisis, IPO markets were not 
the only equity issue markets that saw a collapse in volume. 
Markets for seasoned equity offerings and leveraged buyouts 
also collapsed. The extreme market uncertainty at the time 
created a “flight to quality.” Investors, wary of taking risk, 
sought to move their capital into risk-free investments like 
U.S. Treasury securities. The result was a crash in existing 
equity prices and a greatly reduced supply of new capital to 
risky asset classes.
The drop in IPO issues during the 2008 financial crisis was 
both global and dramatic. The figure below shows the total 
worldwide dollar volume of IPO proceeds in billions of dollars 
(blue bars) and number of deals (red line) by quarter, from the 
last quarter of 2006 to the first quarter of 2009. Comparing 
the fourth quarter of 2007 (a record quarter for IPO issues) to 
the fourth quarter of 2008, dollar volume dropped a stunning 
97% from $102 billion to just $3 billion. Things got even 
worse in the first quarter of 2009 with just $1.4 billion raised. 
The market for IPOs essentially dried up altogether.

It is difficult to understand how a $20 million issue can be profitably done for “only” $1.4 
million, while an $80 million issue requires paying fees of $5.6 million.
No researcher has provided a satisfactory answer to this puzzle. Chen and Ritter argue 
for implicit collusion by the underwriters, but in response to their paper Robert Han-
sen finds no evidence of any such collusion.17 He shows that there is low underwriting 
industry concentration, that there have been significant new entrants in the IPO-­
underwriting market, and that a 7% spread is less profitable than normal investment 
banking activities.
One possible explanation is that by attempting to undercut its rivals, an underwriter 
may risk signaling that it is not the same quality as its higher-priced competitors, mak-
ing firms less likely to select that underwriter. Professor Craig Dunbar examined this 
­hypothesis.18 He found that underwriters charging slightly lower fees appear to enjoy a 
greater market share, but those charging significantly lower fees have smaller market shares. 
Indeed, in support of the idea that the quality of the underwriter is important, underwrit-
ers that charge very high fees gain market share.
Long-Run Underperformance
We know that the shares of IPOs generally perform very well immediately following the 
public offering. It is perhaps surprising, then, that Professor Jay Ritter found that newly 
listed firms subsequently appear to perform relatively poorly over the following three to

five years after their IPOs.19 In follow-up studies, Professors Alon Brav, Christopher Geczy, 
and Paul Gompers found that IPOs between 1975 and 1992 underperformed by an aver-
age of 44% relative to the S&P 500 over the subsequent five years.20 Jay Ritter and Ivo 
Welch found that IPOs between 1980 and 2001 underperformed the market by an average 
of 23.4% during the subsequent three years.21
As we will see in the next section, underperformance is not unique to an initial public issu-
ance of equity: It is associated with subsequent issuances as well, raising the possibility that 
underperformance might not result from the issue of equity itself, but rather from the condi-
tions that motivated the equity issuance in the first place. We will explain this idea in more 
detail in the next section after we explain how a public company issues additional equity.

23.4	 The Seasoned Equity Offering
A firm’s need for outside capital rarely ends at the IPO. Usually, profitable growth oppor-
tunities occur throughout the life of the firm, and in some cases it is not feasible to finance 
these opportunities out of retained earnings. Thus, more often than not, firms return to 
the equity markets and offer new shares for sale, a type of offering called a seasoned equity 
offering (SEO).
The Mechanics of an SEO
When a firm issues stock using an SEO, it follows many of the same steps as for an IPO. 
The main difference is that a market price for the stock already exists, so the price-setting 
process is not necessary.
RealNetworks has conducted several SEOs since its IPO in 1997. On June 17, 1999, 
the firm offered 4 million shares in an SEO at a price of $58 per share. Of these shares, 
3,525,000 were primary shares—new shares issued by the company. The remaining 
475,000 shares were secondary shares—shares sold by existing shareholders, includ-
ing the company’s founder, Robert Glaser, who sold 310,000 of his shares. Most of the 
rest of RealNetworks’ SEOs occurred between 1999 and 2004 and included secondary 
shares sold by existing shareholders rather than directly by RealNetworks.
Historically, intermediaries would advertise the sale of stock (both IPOs and SEOs) by 
taking out advertisements in newspapers called tombstones. Through these ads, inves-
tors would know who to call to buy stock. Today, investors become informed about the 
impending sale of stock by the news media, from the Internet, via a road show, or through 
the book-building process, so these tombstones are purely ceremonial.
Two kinds of seasoned equity offerings exist: a cash offer and a rights offer. In a cash 
offer, the firm offers the new shares to investors at large. In a rights offer, the firm offers 
the new shares only to existing shareholders. In the United States, most offers are cash

23.4  The Seasoned Equity Offering	
887
offers, but the same is not true internationally. For example, in the United Kingdom, most 
seasoned offerings of new shares are rights offers.
Rights offers protect existing shareholders from underpricing. To see how, suppose a 
company holds $100 in cash and has 50 shares outstanding. Each share is worth $2. The 
company announces a cash offer for 50 shares at $1 per share. Once this offer is com-
plete, the company will have $150 in cash and 100 shares outstanding. The price per 
share is now $1.50 to reflect the fact that the new shares were sold at a discount. The new 
shareholders therefore receive a $0.50 windfall at the expense of the old shareholders.
The old shareholders would be protected if, instead of a cash offer, the company did a 
rights offer. In this case, rather than offer the new shares for general sale, every shareholder 
would have the right to purchase an additional share for $1 per share. If all shareholders 
chose to exercise their rights, then after the sale, the value of the company would be the 
same as with a cash offer: It would be worth $150 with 100 shares outstanding and a price 
of $1.50 per share. In this case, however, the $0.50 windfall accrues to existing share-
holders, which exactly offsets the drop in the stock price. Thus, if a firm’s management 
is concerned that its equity may be underpriced in the market, by using a rights offering 
the firm can continue to issue equity without imposing a loss on its current shareholders.
Example 23.6
Raising Money with Rights Offers
Problem
You are the CFO of a company that is currently worth $1 billion. The firm has 100 million shares 
outstanding, so the shares are trading at $10 per share. You need to raise $200 million and have 
announced a rights issue. Each existing shareholder is sent one right for every share he or she 
owns. You have not decided how many rights you will require to purchase a share of new stock. 
You will require either four rights to purchase one share at a price of $8 per share, or five rights 
to purchase two new shares at a price of $5 per share. Which approach will raise more money?
Solution
If all shareholders exercise their rights, then in the first case, 25 million new shares will be pur-
chased at a price of $8 per share, raising $200 million. In the second case, 40 million new shares 
will be purchased at a price of $5 per share, also raising $200 million. If all shareholders exercise 
their rights, both approaches will raise the same amount of money.
In both cases, the value of the firm after the issue is $1.2 billion. In the first case, there are 
125 million shares outstanding, so the price per share after the issue is $9.60. This price exceeds 
the issue price of $8, so the shareholders will exercise their rights. In the second case, the num-
ber of shares outstanding will grow to 140 million, resulting in a post-issue stock price of $1.2 
billion for 140 million shares = $8.57 per share (also higher than the issue price). Again, the 
shareholders will exercise their rights. In both cases, the same amount of money is raised.
The arguments in favor of rights offers presume, however, that all shareholders par-
ticipate. Surprisingly, even though participation is profitable (because the new shares are 
priced at a discount), Professors Clifford Holderness and Jeffrey Pontiff report that on 
average less than 70% of shareholders participate in U.S. rights offerings.22 Rights offers 
therefore lead to a wealth transfer from non-participating shareholders, who tend to be 
small individual investors, to those who do participate.

of Financial Economics (2016).

Chapter 23  Raising Equity Capital
Price Reaction
Researchers have found that, on average, the market greets the news of an SEO with a price 
decline. Often the value destroyed by the price decline can be a significant fraction of the 
new money raised. This price decline is consistent with the adverse selection we discussed 
in Chapter 16. Because a company concerned about protecting its existing shareholders 
will tend to sell only at a price that correctly values or overvalues the firm, investors infer 
from the decision to sell that the company is likely to be overvalued; hence, the price drops 
with the announcement of the SEO.
Although adverse selection is a plausible explanation for SEO price reaction, some 
puzzles remain unexplained. First, by offering a rights issue, a company can mitigate the 
adverse selection. It is not clear, then, at least in the United States, why companies do 
not initiate more rights issues. Second, as with IPOs, evidence suggests that companies 
underperform following a seasoned offering (see Figure 23.7). At first glance, this under-
performance appears to suggest that the stock price decrease is not large enough, because 
underperformance implies that the price following the issue was too high.
A possible explanation for SEO subsequent underperformance, put forward by Profes-
sors Murray Carlson, Adlai Fisher, and Ron Giammarino, is that this outcome might not 
have to do with the SEO announcement itself, but rather with the conditions that led the 
firm to choose an SEO.23 The decision to raise financing externally usually implies that 
a firm plans to pursue an investment opportunity. As explained in Chapter 22, when a 
firm invests, it is exercising its growth options. Growth options are riskier than projects

themselves, so upon exercise, the firm’s beta decreases, which explains the post-SEO lower 
returns. Researchers have found empirical support for this hypothesis.24
Issuance Costs
Although not as costly as IPOs, as Figure 23.6 shows, seasoned offerings are still expensive. 
Underwriting fees amount to 5% of the proceeds of the issue and, as with IPOs, the varia-
tion across issues of different sizes is relatively small. Furthermore, rights offers have lower 
costs than cash offers.25 Given the other advantages of a rights offer, it is a puzzle why the 
majority of offers in the United States are cash offers. The one advantage of a cash offer 
is that the underwriter takes on a larger role and, therefore, can credibly certify the issue’s 
quality. If there is a large amount of asymmetric information and a large proportion of 
existing shareholders are buying the offering anyway, the benefits of certification might 
overcome the cost difference. Professors Espen Eckbo and Ronald Masulis have found 
empirical support for this hypothesis.26

23.1  Equity Financing for Private Companies
	
n	 Private companies can raise outside equity capital from angel investors, venture capital firms, 
private equity firms, institutional investors, or corporate investors.
	
n	 Increasingly, early stage entrepreneurs are able to find angel investors who provide the initial 
capital to start their business.
	
n	 When a company founder sells stock to an outsider to raise capital, the founder’s ownership 
share and control over the company are reduced.
	
n	 Venture capital investors in private firms are often negotiated in terms of the pre-money valua-
tion of the firm, which is the number of prior shares outstanding times the share price used in 
the funding round.
	
n	 Given the pre-money valuation and the amount invested:
Post@money Valuation = Pre@money Valuation + Amount Invested
(23.1)
In addition, the fractional ownership held by the new investors is equal to
Percentage Ownership = Amount Invested/Post@money Valuation.
(23.2)
	
n	 Venture capital investors hold convertible preferred stock. Convertible preferred differs from 
common shares due to provisions such as liquidation preference, seniority, anti-dilution 
­protection, participation rights, and board membership rights.

Chapter 23  Raising Equity Capital
	
n	 Equity investors in private companies plan to sell their stock eventually through one of two 
main exit strategies: an acquisition or a public offering.
23.2  The Initial Public Offering
	
n	 An initial public offering (IPO) is the first time a company sells its stock to the public.
	
n	 The main advantages of going public are greater liquidity and better access to capital. Disad-
vantages include regulatory and financial reporting requirements and the undermining of the 
investors’ ability to monitor the company’s management.
	
n	 During an IPO, the shares sold may represent either a primary offering (if the shares are being 
sold to raise new capital) or a secondary offering (if the shares are sold by earlier investors).
	
n	 Stock may be sold during an IPO on a best-efforts basis, as a firm commitment IPO, or using an 
auction IPO. The firm commitment process is the most common practice in the United States.
	
n	 An underwriter is an investment bank that manages the IPO process and helps the company sell 
its stock.
n	 The lead underwriter is responsible for managing the IPO.
n	 The lead underwriter forms a group of underwriters, called the syndicate, to help sell the stock.
	
n	 The SEC requires that a company file a registration statement prior to an IPO. The preliminary 
prospectus is part of the registration statement that circulates to investors before the stock is 
offered. After the deal is completed, the company files a final prospectus.
	
n	 Underwriters value a company before an IPO using valuation techniques and by book building.
	
n	 Underwriters face risk during an IPO. A greenshoe provision is one way underwriters manage 
the risk associated with IPOs.
23.3  IPO Puzzles
	
n	 Several puzzles are associated with IPOs.
n	 IPOs are underpriced on average.
n	 New issues are highly cyclical.
n	 The transaction costs of an IPO are high.
n	 Long-run performance after an IPO is poor on average.
23.4  The Seasoned Equity Offering
	
n	 A seasoned equity offering (SEO) is the sale of stock by a company that is already publicly traded.
	
n	 Two kinds of SEOs exist: a cash offer (when new shares are sold to investors at large) and a 
rights offer (when new shares are offered only to existing shareholders).
	
n	 The stock price reaction to an SEO is negative on average.

3.	 Starware Software was founded last year to develop software for gaming applications. The 
founder initially invested $1,000,000 and received 12 million shares of stock. Starware now 
needs to raise a second round of capital, and it has identified an interested venture capitalist. 
This venture capitalist will invest $1 million and wants to own 38% of the company after the 
investment is completed.
a.	 How many shares must the venture capitalist receive to end up with 38% of the company? 
What is the implied price per share of this funding round?
b.	 What will the value of the whole firm be after this investment (the post-money valuation)?
	
4.	 Suppose venture capital firm GSB partners raised $50 million of committed capital. Each year 
over the 12-year life of the fund, 1.5% of this committed capital will be used to pay GSB’s 
management fee. As is typical in the venture capital industry, GSB will only invest $41 million 
(committed capital less lifetime management fees). At the end of 12 years, the investments 
made by the fund are worth $550 million. GSB also charges 30% carried interest on the profits 
of the fund (net of management fees).
a.	 Assuming the $41 million of invested capital is invested immediately and all proceeds were 
received at the end of 12 years, what is the IRR of the investments GSB partners made? That 
is, compute IRR ignoring all management fees.
b.	 Of course, as an investor, or limited partner, you are more interested in your own IRR—that is,

	 It is currently 2012 and you need to raise additional capital to expand your business. You 
have decided to take your firm public through an IPO. You would like to issue an additional 
6 million new shares through this IPO. Assuming that your firm successfully completes its IPO, 
you forecast that 2012 net income will be $7 million.
a.	 Your investment banker advises you that the prices of other recent IPOs have been set such 
that the P/E ratios based on 2012 forecasted earnings average 18.0. Assuming that your IPO 
is set at a price that implies a similar multiple, what will your IPO price per share be?
b.	 What percentage of the firm will you own after the IPO?

Data Case
Few IPOs have garnered as much attention as social media giant Facebook’s public offering on May 
18, 2012. It was the biggest IPO in Internet history, easily topping Google’s initial public offering 
eight years earlier. Let’s take a closer look at the IPO itself, as well as the payoffs to some of Face-
book’s early investors.
	
1.	 Begin by navigating to the SEC EDGAR Web site, which provides access to company filings: 
www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. Choose “Search for Company Filings” and pick search by company 
name. Enter “Facebook” and then search for its IPO prospectus, which was filed on the date 
of the IPO and is listed as filing “424B4” (this acronym derives from the rule number requir-
ing the firm to file a prospectus, Rule 424(b)(4)). From the prospectus, calculate the following 
information:
a.	 The underwriting spread in percentage terms. How does this spread compare to a typical 
IPO?
b.	 The fraction of the offering that comprised primary shares and the fraction that comprised 
secondary shares.
c.	 The size, in number of shares, of the greenshoe provision. What percent of the deal did the 
greenshoe provision represent?
	
2.	 Next, navigate to Google Finance and search for “Facebook.” Determine the closing price of the 
stock on the day of the IPO (use the “Historical prices” link). What was the first day return? How 
does this return compare to the typical IPO?
	
3.	 Using the data provided by Google Finance, calculate the performance of Facebook in the three-
month post-IPO period. That is, calculate the annualized return an investor would have received 
if he had invested in Facebook at the closing price on the IPO day and sold the stock three 
months later. What was the return for a one-year holding period?

	
4.	 Prior to the public offering, Facebook was able to raise capital from all the sources mentioned in 
the chapter. Let’s concentrate on one particular source, Microsoft Corporation.
a.	 Microsoft made one investment in Facebook, during October 2007. Go to Facebook’s 
corporate news Web site (newsroom.fb.com) and locate the press release announcing this 
investment. Using the information in that press release and the number of shares owned by 
Microsoft listed in the IPO prospectus, calculate the per share price Microsoft paid.
b.	 Calculate the return (expressed on an annual basis) Microsoft earned on its investment up to 
the IPO (using the IPO price).
c.	 How much money did Microsoft receive from the IPO?
	
5.	 Facebook had only one angel investor, Peter Thiel (the founder of PayPal). Mr. Thiel invested 
more than once in Facebook, both as an angel and, in later rounds, on behalf of investors in his 
venture capital firm, Founders Fund. As an angel, Mr. Thiel invested $500,000 in September 
2004. Assuming that all the shares he received in the angel round were registered under the name 
Rivendell One LLC,27 use the information in the prospectus to calculate:
a.	 The per share price he paid as an angel.
b.	 The annualized return (using the IPO price) he made on his investment.
c.	 The amount of angel money Mr. Thiel received from the proceeds of the IPO (that is, from 
his Rivendell investments alone).
Note: Updates to this data case may be found at www.berkdemarzo.com.

27How Mr. Thiel holds his investments in Facebook is private information, so there is no substantive basis 
on which to make this assumption. That said, Mr. Thiel is reported to be a fan of The Lord of the Rings.

Debt Financing
IN the MIDDLe OF 2005, FOrD MOtOr COMpaNY DeCIDeD tO 
put one of its subsidiaries, Hertz Corporation, up for competitive bid. On September 
13, 2005, The Wall Street Journal reported that a group of private investors led by Clay-
ton, Dubilier & Rice (CDR), a private equity firm, had reached a deal with Ford to pur-
chase Hertz’s outstanding equity for $5.6 billion. In addition, Hertz had $9.1 billion in 
existing debt that needed to be refinanced as part of the deal. CDR planned to finance 
the transaction in part by raising over $11 billion in new debt. Using this Hertz deal 
as an illustrative example, in this chapter, we examine how corporations use the debt 
markets to raise capital.
When companies raise capital by issuing debt, they have several potential 
sources from which to seek funds. To complete the Hertz purchase, the group led by 
CDR ended up relying on at least four different kinds of debt: domestic- and foreign-
denominated high-yield bonds, bank loans, and asset-backed securities. In addition, 
each debt issue has its own specific terms, determined at the time of issue. We there-
fore begin our exploration of debt financing by explaining the process of issuing debt.
Corporations are not the only entities that use debt financing. ­Governments, 
municipalities, and other local entities as well as quasi-­government entities (such as 
state-owned corporations) also use the debt markets to raise capital. Hence, the scope 
of this chapter is necessarily broader than that of Chapter 23. Here, we introduce all 
of the important types of debt that exist—not just corporate debt. Finally, we discuss 
some of the more advanced features of bonds such as call provisions and conversion 
options.

Chapter 24  Debt Financing
24.1	 Corporate Debt
Recall from Chapter 23 our discussion of how private companies become public compa-
nies. The deal in which CDR bought Hertz is an example of the opposite transition—a 
public company becoming private, in this case through a leveraged buyout. Recall that in a 
leveraged buyout (LBO), a group of private investors purchases all the equity of a public 
corporation.1 With a total value of $15.2 billion,2 the leveraged buyout of Hertz was the 
second largest transaction of its kind at the time of its announcement (the largest LBO at 
the time was the $31.3 billion takeover of RJR-Nabisco in 1989). Taking a public corpora-
tion private in this way requires issuing large amounts of corporate debt. Table 24.1 shows 
the debt that was issued to finance the Hertz LBO. Using these debt issues as an example, 
let’s begin by explaining how corporations issue debt.
1At the time of the deal, Hertz was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company, which itself is 
a public company. Prior to Ford’s acquisition of Hertz’s outstanding shares in 2001, Hertz was publicly 
traded.
2The total value includes $5.6 billion in equity, $9.1 billion in debt, and $0.5 billion in fees and expenses. 
In addition to $11.1 billion in new debt, the transaction was financed using $1.8 billion of Hertz’s own 
cash and securities (including a $1.2 billion obligation from Ford, which was forgiven as part of the pay-
ment to Ford). The remaining $2.3 billion in private equity was contributed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice; 
The Carlyle Group; and Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity.

Public Debt
Corporate bonds are securities issued by corporations. They account for a significant 
amount of invested capital. As of mid-2015, the value of outstanding U.S. corporate bonds 
was about $8.1 trillion.
The Prospectus.  A public bond issue is similar to a stock issue. A prospectus or offering 
memorandum must be produced that describes the details of the offering (see Figure 24.1). 
In addition, for public offerings, the prospectus must include an indenture, a formal 
­contract between the bond issuer and a trust company. The trust company represents the 
bondholders and makes sure that the terms of the indenture are enforced. In the case of 
default, the trust company represents the bondholders’ interests.
While corporate bonds almost always pay coupons semiannually, a few corporations 
(e.g., Coca-Cola) have issued zero-coupon bonds. Historically, corporate bonds have 
been issued with a wide range of maturities. Most corporate bonds have maturities of 30 
years or less, although in the past there have been original maturities of up to 999 years.

Issue

In July 1993, for example, Walt Disney Company issued $150 million in bonds with a 
maturity of 100 years; these bonds soon became known as the “Sleeping Beauty” bonds.
The face value or principal amount of the bond is denominated in standard increments, 
most often $1000. The face value does not always correspond to the actual money raised 
because of underwriting fees and the possibility that the bond might not actually sell for its 
face value when it is offered for sale initially. If a coupon bond is issued at a discount, it is 
called an original issue discount (OID) bond.

Chapter 24  Debt Financing
Bearer Bonds and Registered Bonds.  In a public offering, the indenture lays out the 
terms of the bond issue. Most corporate bonds are coupon bonds, and coupons are paid 
in one of two ways. Historically, most bonds were bearer bonds. Bearer bonds are like 
currency: Whoever physically holds the bond certificate owns the bond. To receive a cou-
pon payment, the holder of a bearer bond must provide explicit proof of ownership. The 
holder does so by literally clipping a coupon off the bond certificate and remitting it to 
the paying agent. Anyone producing such a coupon is entitled to the payment—hence, the 
name “coupon” payment. Besides the obvious hassles associated with clipping coupons and 
mailing them in, there are serious security concerns with bearer bonds. Losing such a bond 
certificate is like losing currency.
Consequently, almost all bonds that are issued today are registered bonds. The issuer 
maintains a list of all holders of its bonds. Brokers keep issuers informed of any changes 
in ownership. On each coupon payment date, the bond issuer consults its list of registered 
owners and mails each owner a check (or directly deposits the coupon payment into the 
owner’s brokerage account). This system also facilitates tax collection because the govern-
ment can easily keep track of all interest payments made.
Types of Corporate Debt.  Four types of corporate debt are typically issued: notes, 
debentures, mortgage bonds, and asset-backed bonds (see Table 24.2). Debentures and 
notes are unsecured debt, which means that in the event of a bankruptcy bondholders 
have a claim to only the assets of the firm that are not already pledged as collateral on 
other debt. Typically, notes have shorter maturities (less than 10 years) than debentures. 
Asset-backed bonds and mortgage bonds are secured debt: Specific assets are pledged as 
collateral that bondholders have a direct claim to in the event of bankruptcy. Mortgage 
bonds are secured by real property, whereas asset-backed bonds can be secured by any kind 
of asset. Although the word “bond” is commonly used to mean any kind of debt security, 
technically a corporate bond must be secured.
Let’s illustrate these concepts by returning to the Hertz LBO. Recall that CDR intended 
to refinance approximately $9 billion of existing Hertz corporate debt. So, subsequent to 
the agreement, Hertz made a tender offer—a public announcement of an offer to all exist-
ing bondholders to buy back its existing debt. This debt repurchase was financed by issuing 
several kinds of new debt (both secured and unsecured), all of which were claims on Hertz’s 
corporate assets.
As part of the financing, CDR planned to issue $2.7 billion worth of unsecured debt3—
in this case, high-yield notes known as junk bonds (bonds rated below investment grade).4 
The high-yield issue was divided into three kinds of debt or tranches (see Table 24.3), all of 
3In the end, the firm issued only $2 billion in debt because fewer existing bondholders tendered their 
bonds than expected ($1.6 billion of existing debt remained on the balance sheet after the LBO was 
completed).
4A description of corporate credit ratings can be found in Chapter 6 (see Table 6.4).

which made semiannual coupon payments and were issued at par. The largest tranche was 
a $1.8 billion face-value note maturing in nine years. It paid a coupon of 8.875%, which at 
the time represented a 4.45% spread over Treasuries. A second tranche was denominated 
in euros, and the third tranche was junior to the other two and paid a coupon of 10.5%. 
The rest of the debt financing was made up of asset-backed debt that was sold privately, 
and bank loans.
Seniority.  Recall that debentures and notes are unsecured. Because more than one deben-
ture might be outstanding, the bondholder’s priority in claiming assets in the event of 
default, known as the bond’s seniority, is important. As a result, most debenture issues 
contain clauses restricting the company from issuing new debt with equal or higher prior-
ity than existing debt.
When a firm conducts a subsequent debenture issue that has lower priority than its 
outstanding debt, the new debt is known as a subordinated debenture. In the event of 
default, the assets not pledged as collateral for outstanding bonds cannot be used to pay 
off the holders of subordinated debentures until all more senior debt has been paid off. 
In Hertz’s case, one tranche of the junk bond issue is a note that is subordinated to the 
other two tranches. In the event of bankruptcy, this note has a lower-priority claim on the 
firm’s assets. Because holders of this tranche are likely to receive less in the event of a Hertz 
default, the yield on this debt is higher than that of the other tranches—10.5% compared 
to 8.875% for the first tranche.
Bond Markets.  The remaining tranche of Hertz’s junk bond issue is a note that is 
denominated in euros rather than U.S. dollars—it is an international bond. International 
bonds are classified into four broadly defined categories. Domestic bonds are bonds

Chapter 24  Debt Financing
issued by a local entity and traded in a local market, but purchased by foreigners. They are 
denominated in the local currency. Foreign bonds are bonds issued by a foreign company 
in a local market and are intended for local investors. They are also denominated in the 
local currency. Foreign bonds in the United States are known as Yankee bonds. In other 
countries, foreign bonds also have special names. For example, in Japan they are called 
Samurai bonds; in the United Kingdom, they are known as Bulldogs.
Eurobonds are international bonds that are not denominated in the local currency of 
the country in which they are issued. Consequently, there is no connection between the 
physical location of the market on which they trade and the location of the issuing entity. 
They can be denominated in any number of currencies that might or might not be con-
nected to the location of the issuer. The trading of these bonds is not subject to any par-
ticular nation’s regulations. Global bonds combine the features of domestic, foreign, and 
Eurobonds, and are offered for sale in several different markets simultaneously. The Hertz 
junk bond issue is an example of a global bond issue: It was simultaneously offered for sale 
in the United States and Europe.
A bond that makes its payments in a foreign currency contains the risk of holding that 
currency and, therefore, is priced off the yields of similar bonds in that currency. Hence, 
the euro-denominated note of the Hertz junk bond issue has a different yield from the 
dollar-denominated note, even though both bonds have the same seniority and maturity. 
While they have the same default risk, they differ in their exchange rate risk—the risk that 
the foreign currency will depreciate in value relative to the local currency.
Private Debt
In addition to the junk bond issue, Hertz took out more than $2 billion in bank loans. 
Bank loans are an example of private debt, debt that is not publicly traded. The private 
debt market is larger than the public debt market. Private debt has the advantage that it 
avoids the cost of registration but has the disadvantage of being illiquid.
There are two segments of the private debt market: term loans and private placements.
Term Loans.  Hertz negotiated a $1.7 billion term loan, a bank loan that lasts for a spe-
cific term. The term of the Hertz loan was seven years. This particular loan is an example 
of a syndicated bank loan: a single loan that is funded by a group of banks rather than just 
a single bank. Usually, one member of the syndicate (the lead bank) negotiates the terms 
of the bank loan. In the Hertz case, Deutsche Bank AG negotiated the loan with CDR and 
then sold portions of it off to other banks—mostly smaller regional banks that had excess 
cash but lacked the resources to negotiate a loan of this magnitude by themselves.
Most syndicated loans are rated as investment grade. However, Hertz’s term loan is an 
exception. Term loans such as Hertz’s that are associated with LBOs are known as leveraged 
syndicated loans and are rated as speculative grade; in Hertz’s case, Standard and Poor’s 
rated the term loan as BB and Moody’s rated it as Ba2.
In addition to the term loan, Dow Jones reported that Hertz negotiated an asset-backed 
revolving line of credit. A revolving line of credit is a credit commitment for a specific 
time period up to some limit (five years and $1.6 billion in Hertz’s case), which a company 
can use as needed. Hertz’s initial draw on the line of credit was $400 million. Because the 
line of credit is backed by specific assets, it is more secure than the term loan, so Standard 
and Poor’s gave it a BB+ rating.
Private Placements.  A private placement is a bond issue that does not trade on a public 
market but rather is sold to a small group of investors. Because a private placement does 
not need to be registered, it is less costly to issue. Instead of an indenture, often a simple 

	
24.2  Other Types of Debt	
903
promissory note is sufficient. Privately placed debt also need not conform to the same stan-
dards as public debt; as a consequence, it can be tailored to the particular situation.
Returning to the Hertz deal, CDR privately placed an additional $4.2 billion of U.S. 
asset-backed securities and $2.1 billion of international asset-backed securities. In this case, 
the assets backing the debt were the fleet of rental cars Hertz owned; hence, this debt was 
termed “Fleet Debt” in the offering memorandum.
In 1990, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Rule 144A, 
which significantly increased the liquidity of certain privately placed debt. Private debt 
issued under this rule can be traded by large financial institutions among themselves. The 
rule was motivated by a desire to increase the access of foreign corporations to U.S. debt 
markets. Bonds that are issued under this rule are nominally private debt, but because they 
are tradable between financial institutions they are only slightly less liquid than public 
debt. In fact, the $2.8 billion Hertz junk bond issue in Table 24.3 is actually debt issued 
under Rule 144A (which explains why the offering document in Figure 24.1 is called an 
“offering memorandum” rather than a “prospectus,” because the latter term is reserved for 
public offerings). As part of the offering, however, the issuers agreed to publicly register the 
bonds within 390 days.5 Because the debt was marketed and sold with the understanding 
that it would become public debt, we classified that issue as public debt.

24.2	 Other Types of Debt
Corporations are not the only entities that use debt. We begin with the largest debt 
­sector—loans to government entities.
Sovereign Debt
Recall from Chapter 6 that sovereign debt is debt issued by national governments. Recall 
too that bonds issued by the U.S. government are called Treasury securities. Treasury secu-
rities represent the single largest sector of the U.S. bond market. On June 30, 2015, the 
market value of outstanding Treasury securities was $12.70 trillion. These bonds enable 
the U.S. government to borrow money so that it can engage in deficit spending (that is, 
spending more than what is received in tax revenues).
The U.S. Treasury issues four kinds of securities (see Table 24.4). Treasury bills are 
pure discount bonds with maturities ranging from a few days to one year. Currently, 
5If Hertz failed to fulfill this commitment, the interest rate on all the outstanding bonds would increase 
by 0.5%.

the Treasury issues bills with original maturities of 4, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. Treasury 
notes are semiannual coupon bonds with original maturities of between 1 and 10 years. 
The ­Treasury issues notes with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years at the present 
time. ­Treasury bonds are semiannual coupon bonds with maturities longer than 10 
years. The Treasury currently issues bonds with maturities of 30 years (often called 
long bonds). All of these Treasury securities trade in the bond market.
The last type of security that the U.S. Treasury is currently issuing is inflation-indexed 
bonds called TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) with maturities of 5, 10, and 
30 years. These bonds are standard coupon bonds with one difference: The outstanding 
principal is adjusted for inflation. Thus, although the coupon rate is fixed, the dollar coupon 
varies because the semiannual coupon payments are a fixed rate of the inflation-adjusted 
principal. In addition, the final repayment of principal at maturity (but not the interest 
payments) is protected against deflation. That is, if the final inflation-adjusted principal 
amount is less than the original principal amount, the original principal amount is repaid.
Example 24.1
Coupon Payments on Inflation-Indexed Bonds
Problem
On January 15, 2008, the U.S. Treasury issued a 10-year inflation-indexed note with a coupon of 
15⁄8 %. On the date of issue, the consumer price index (CPI) was 209.49645. On January 15, 2015, 
the CPI had increased to 236.85403. What coupon payment was made on January 15, 2015?
Solution
Between the issue date and January 15, 2015, the CPI appreciated by 226.33474/184.77419 = 
1.13059.  Consequently, the principal amount of the bond increased by this amount; that is, the 
original face value of $1000 increased to $1130.59.  Because the bond pays semiannual coupons, 
the coupon payment was $1130.59 * 0.01625/2 = $9.19
Treasury securities are initially sold to the public by auction. Two kinds of bids are 
allowed: competitive bids and noncompetitive bids. Noncompetitive bidders (usually 
individuals) just submit the amount of bonds they wish to purchase and are guaranteed 
to have their orders filled at the auction. All competitive bidders submit sealed bids in 
terms of yields and the amount of bonds they are willing to purchase. The Treasury then 
accepts the lowest-yield (highest-price) competitive bids up to the amount required to 
fund the deal. The highest yield accepted is termed the stop-out yield. All successful 
bidders (including the noncompetitive bidders) are awarded this yield. In the case of a 
Treasury bill offering, the stop-out yield is used to set the price of the bill and all bidders 
then pay this price. In the case of a Treasury note or Treasury bond offering, this yield 
determines the coupon of the bond and then all bidders pay the par value for the bond 
or note.6 All income from Treasury securities is taxable at the federal level. This income, 
however, is not taxable at the state or local level.7
Zero-coupon Treasury securities with maturities longer than one year also trade in the 
bond market. They are called STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Prin-
cipal Securities). The Treasury itself does not issue STRIPS. Instead, investors (or, more

commonly, investment banks) purchase Treasury notes and bonds and then resell each 
coupon and principal payment separately as a zero-coupon bond.
Municipal Bonds
Municipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by state and local governments. Their distinguish-
ing characteristic is that the income on municipal bonds is not taxable at the federal level. 
Consequently, municipal bonds are sometimes also referred to as tax-exempt bonds. Some 
issues are also exempt from state and local taxes.
Most municipal bonds pay semiannual coupons. A single issue will often contain a num-
ber of different maturity dates. Such issues are often called serial bonds because the bonds 
are scheduled to mature serially over a number of years. The coupons on municipal bonds 
can be either fixed or floating. A fixed-coupon bond has the same coupon over the life of the 
bond. In a floating-rate issue, the coupon of the bond is adjusted periodically. The reset for-
mula is a spread over a reference rate like the rate on Treasury bills that is established when 
the bond is first issued. There are also a few zero-coupon municipal bond issues.
Municipal bonds can differ in terms of the source of funds that guarantee them. Rev-
enue bonds pledge specific revenues generated by projects that were initially financed by the 
bond issue. For example, the State of Nevada issued revenue bonds to finance the Las Vegas 
Monorail, to be repaid from fare revenues. Bonds backed by the full faith and credit of a 
local government are known as general obligation bonds. Sometimes local governments 
strengthen the commitment further by tying the promise to a particular revenue source, such 
as a special fee. Because a local government can always use its general revenue to repay such 
bonds, this commitment is over and above the usual commitment, so these bonds are called 
double-barreled. Despite these protections, municipal bonds are not nearly as secure as bonds 
backed by the federal government. Since 1970, about 4% of municipal bonds have defaulted, 
with the frequency and magnitude of default increasing in the aftermath of the 2008 finan-
cial crisis (including the aforementioned Las Vegas Monorail bonds).8 The largest municipal 
bond defaults in U.S. history were Detroit’s default in 2013 on over $7 billion in debt, soon 
­surpassed by Puerto Rico’s 2016 default on as much as $72 billion in debt.
8M. Walsh, “Muni Bonds Not as Safe as Thought,” The New York Times, August 15, 2012.
Detroit’s Art Museum at Risk
In July 2013, the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bank-
ruptcy protection, making history as the largest-ever munic-
ipal default. The city emerged from bankruptcy 15 months 
later, defaulting on $7 billion of its debt and cutting pension 
payments by 4.5%. But the cuts might have been worse, had 
not the city effectively “sold” its art museum.
The trouble for the city’s art museum began prior to 
the bankruptcy filing when Kevyn Orr was appointed as 
an emergency manager of the city and demanded that the 
art museum sell $500 million of its art to help pay off city 
debts. The museum responded by raising $800 million 
from donors and using the money to buy its independence 
from the city. Following the bankruptcy, the ownership of 
the art museum transferred from the city to an independent 
trust.
Compared to a corporate bankruptcy, which allows the 
debtors to claim all the assets of the corporation, the ability of 
the debtors to claim assets in a municipal bankruptcy is very 
limited. Although the museum did ultimately contribute to 
the bankruptcy settlement, the amount of the contribution 
was far less than the $4.6 billion appraised value of its art. 
Similarly, although the pensioners did take cuts, the assets 
that backed their pensions were left intact in the pension plans 
and were not used to pay off debt holders. In the end, the 
debt holders took losses even when city assets existed, that if 
liquidated, could have covered some, if not all, of those losses.

CDOs, Subprime Mortgages, and the Financial Crisis
of securities, distinguished by their seniority, known as 
­collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). By first 
pooling and diversifying the mortgages, and then tranching 
them into senior and subordinated securities, it is possible 
to create senior securities that have much lower risk than 
the underlying mortgages themselves. For example, consider 
a security with a senior claim to any principal repayments, 
for up to one half of the total principal outstanding. This 
security would be impaired only if more than 50% of the 
mortgages in the pool defaulted.
The figure below illustrates this idea, showing the flow of 
mortgage cash flows, first into MBS pools, and then into buck-
ets representing the CMO security tranches. The buckets that 
are first in line are very likely to be filled. These senior tranches 
received AAA ratings and were attractive to investors because 
of their high yields given their perceived safety. Of course, as 
we move further down, the later buckets face a much higher 
GNMA and the other government agencies that issue 
­mortgage-backed securities restrict the type of mortgages that 
they are prepared to securitize. For example, they will only 
securitize mortgages below a certain face value and, more 
importantly, that meet certain credit criteria. Mortgages that 
do not satisfy these criteria and have a high default probability 
are known as subprime mortgages. Part of the housing boom 
in the mid-2000s can be attributed to the increased availabil-
ity of subprime mortgages. As the number of subprime mort-
gages exploded so, too, did the incentives to securitize them. 
Private institutions, such as banks, issued large amounts of 
mortgage-backed securities backed by subprime mortgages.
To understand the origins of the crisis, it is helpful to 
understand how subprime loans were securitized. Banks 
originating these loans first combined them into large asset 
pools. The cash flows from these mortgage-backed security 
pools were then used to back promises to different tranches 
Global Financial Crisis
Asset-Backed Securities
An asset-backed security (ABS) is a security that is made up of other financial securi-
ties; that is, the security’s cash flows come from the cash flows of the underlying financial 
securities that “back” it. We refer to the process of creating an asset-backed security—
packaging a portfolio of financial securities and issuing an asset-backed security backed by 
this portfolio—as asset securitization.
By far, the largest sector of the asset-backed security market is the mortgage-backed secu-
rity market. A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is an asset-backed security backed by 
home mortgages. U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises, such as The Gov-
ernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or “Ginnie Mae”) are the largest issuers 
The riskiest tranches of these 
mortgage-backed secuities were 
often re-pooled and re-tranched
as CDOs.
Cash flows from individual mortgages 
are first pooled together in an MBS, 
diversifying their risk.
The cash flows of the pool are then
tranched into CMO securities with
differing priority. Senior securities
carry less risk than more junior ones.

in this sector. When homeowners in the underlying mortgages make their mortgage pay-
ments, this cash is passed through (minus servicing fees) to the holders of the mortgage-
backed security. The cash flows of mortgage-backed securities therefore mirror the cash 
flows of home mortgages.
In the case of GNMA-issued mortgage-backed securities, the U.S. government provides 
an explicit guarantee to investors against default risk. This guarantee does not mean that these 
securities are risk-free, however. As discussed in Chapter 22, a mortgage borrower always has 
an option to repay some or all of the mortgage loan early (often because the borrower moves 
or refinances), and this early repayment of principal is passed through to owners of mortgage-
backed securities. Thus, holders of mortgage-backed securities face prepayment risk—the 
risk that the bond will be partially (or wholly) repaid earlier than expected.
borrowers to refinance their loans and avoid default. Once 
the housing market slowed and began to decline in 2006–
2007, refinancing was no longer possible (as banks would 
not lend more than the house was worth), and the default 
rate skyrocketed to over 40%.
The increased default rate had two important conse-
quences. First, the original mortgage-backed securities turned 
out to be riskier than anticipated: Securities that were pro-
tected against default rates in excess of 20%, which seemed 
extremely safe in 2005, began to experience losses. But the 
damage was even more dramatic in the CDO securities that 
were created from the junior mortgage-backed securities. The 
safety of the senior tranches of these CDOs relied on diversifi-
cation—if no more than 20% of the junior mortgage-backed 
securities defaulted, these securities would be fully repaid. 
But the unexpectedly pervasive nature of the housing crisis 
meant that almost all of the securities that were backing these 
CDOs were running dry. As a result, many of the most senior, 
AAA-rated, CDO tranches were virtually wiped out, with 
their values declining to pennies on the dollar. This outcome 
was an extreme shock for the many investors who held them 
­believing they were safe investments.
risk of not filling completely. The most junior tranches had 
low ratings (or were even unrated), and were much riskier 
than the original pools (if even one mortgage in the entire pool 
defaulted, these securities would be affected). As a result, these 
junior tranches appealed only to very sophisticated investors 
with an appetite for, and an ability to assess, their risk.
As the subprime market grew, finding investors willing 
to hold the junior tranches became more problematic. To 
resolve this problem, investment banks created pools of these 
junior securities, which they then tranched into a new series of 
senior and junior securities (CDOs). By the same reasoning as 
before, the senior tranches of these new CDOs were perceived 
to be very low risk and received AAA ratings, making them 
easy to sell to a wide range of investors. (Note also that, due to 
diversification, the CDO securities can have a higher average 
rating than the individual assets backing them.)
What went wrong? From 2002 through 2005, default 
rates on subprime mortgages were quite low, dropping to 
below 6%. As a result, ratings agencies relaxed their require-
ments and increased the size of the tranches that received 
AAA ratings. However, these low default rates occurred 
because house prices were rising, making it easy for subprime

Chapter 24  Debt Financing
Other government-sponsored enterprises issuing mortgage-backed securities are the 
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or “Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC or “Freddie Mac”). The Student Loan Marketing 
Association (“Sallie Mae”) issues asset-backed securities backed by student loans. While, 
unlike Ginnie Mae, these enterprises are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit 
of the U.S. government, most investors doubt that the government would allow any of its 
agencies to default and so believe these issues contain an implicit guarantee. In September 
2008, this confidence was borne out when both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which 
were both on the brink of failure, were placed into conservatorship of the Federal Housing 
Finance Agency, effectively bailing them out. On June 16, 2010, Fannie Mae’s and Freddie 
Mac’s stocks were delisted from the NYSE.
Private organizations, such as banks, also issue asset-backed securities. These securities 
can be backed by home mortgages (typically loans that do not meet the criteria to be 
included in the asset-backed securities issued by the government agencies) or other kinds 
of consumer loans such as automobile loans and credit card receivables. In addition, pri-
vate asset-backed securities can be backed by other asset-backed securities. When banks 
re-securitize asset-backed and other fixed income securities, the new asset-backed security 
is known as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). CDO cash flows are usually divided 
into different tranches that are assigned different priorities. For example, investors in the 
junior tranche of an asset-backed security do not receive any cash flows until investors in 
the senior tranche have received their promised cash flows. Because of this prioritization, 
different CDO securities can have very different risk characteristics from each other, and 
from the underlying assets themselves (see the box on pages 906 and 907).

24.3	 Bond Covenants
Covenants are restrictive clauses in a bond contract that limit the issuer from taking actions 
that may undercut its ability to repay the bonds. One might guess that such covenants would 
not be necessary—after all, why would managers voluntarily take actions that increase the 
firm’s default risk? However, recall from Chapter 16 that when a firm is levered, managers 
may have an incentive to take actions that benefit equity holders at the expense of debt holders.
For example, once bonds are issued, equity holders have an incentive to increase divi-
dends at the expense of debt holders. Think of an extreme case in which a company issues 
a bond, and then immediately liquidates its assets, pays out the proceeds (including those 
from the bond issue) in the form of a dividend to equity holders, and declares bankruptcy. 
In this case, the equity holders receive the value of the firm’s assets plus the proceeds from 
the bond, while bondholders are left with nothing. Consequently, bond agreements often 
contain covenants that restrict the ability of management to pay dividends. Other covenants 
may restrict the level of further indebtedness and specify that the issuer must maintain a 
minimum amount of working capital. If the issuer fails to live up to any covenant, the bond 
goes into default. Covenants in the Hertz junk bond issue limited Hertz’s ability to incur 
more debt, make dividend payments, redeem stock, make investments, create liens, transfer 
or sell assets, and merge or consolidate. They also included a requirement to offer to repur-
chase the bonds at 101% of face value if the corporation experiences a change in control.

	
24.4  Repayment Provisions	
909
Recall that CDR made a tender offer to repurchase all of Hertz’s outstanding debt. 
CDR made this offer because the outstanding debt had a restrictive covenant that made it 
difficult to complete a merger or takeover of Hertz. Once the group led by CDR owned 
more that 50% of this debt, the terms of the prospectus gave CDR the ability to unilater-
ally change any covenant, thus allowing them to proceed with the LBO.
You might expect that equity holders would try to include as few covenants as possible 
in a bond agreement. In fact, this is not necessarily the case. The stronger the covenants in 
the bond contract, the less likely the issuer will default on the bond, and so the lower the 
interest rate required by investors who buy the bond. That is, by including more covenants, 
issuers can reduce their costs of borrowing. As discussed in Chapter 16, if the covenants are 
designed to reduce agency costs by restricting management’s ability to take negative NPV 
actions that exploit debt holders, then the reduction in the firm’s borrowing cost can more 
than outweigh the cost of the loss of flexibility associated with covenants.

2.	 Why can bond covenants reduce a firm’s borrowing cost?
	
24.4	 Repayment Provisions
A bond issuer repays its bonds by making coupon and principal payments as specified in the 
bond contract. However, this is not the only way an issuer can repay bonds. For example, 
the issuer can repurchase a fraction of the outstanding bonds in the market, or it can make 
a tender offer for the entire issue, as Hertz did on its existing bonds. Another way issuers 
repay bonds is to exercise a call provision that allows the issuer to repurchase the bonds at 
a predetermined price. Bonds that contain such a provision are known as ­callable bonds.
Call Provisions
Hertz’s junk bonds are examples of callable bonds. Table 24.3 lists the call features in each 
tranche. A call feature allows the issuer of the bond the right (but not the obligation) to retire 
all outstanding bonds on (or after) a specific date (the call date), for the call price. The call 
price is generally set at or above, and expressed as a percentage of, the bond’s face value. In 
Hertz’s case, the call dates of the two senior tranches are at the end of the fourth year. For the 
duration of 2010, the $1.8 billion issue could be called at price of 104.438% of the face value 
of the bond. In the following years, the call price declined until in 2012 the bond could be 
called at par. The euro-denominated bond has similar terms at slightly different call prices. 
The subordinated tranche’s call date is a year later and has a different call price structure.
The Hertz bonds could also be partially called in the first three years. Hertz had the 
option to retire up to 35% of the outstanding principal at the call prices listed in Table 24.3, 
as long as the funds needed to repurchase the bonds were derived from the proceeds of an 
equity issuance.
To understand how call provisions affect the price of a bond, we first need to consider 
when an issuer will exercise its right to call the bond. An issuer can always retire one of 
its bonds early by repurchasing the bond in the open market. If the call provision offers a 
cheaper way to retire the bonds, however, the issuer will forgo the option of purchasing the 
bonds in the open market and call the bonds instead.
Let’s examine a more concrete example. Consider a case in which an issuer has issued 
two bonds that are identical in every respect except that one is callable at par (redeem-
able at face value) and the other is not callable. This issuer wants to retire one of the two 

910	
Chapter 24  Debt Financing
bonds. How does it decide which bond to retire? If bond yields have dropped since the 
issue date, the non-callable bond will be trading at a premium. Thus, if the issuer wished 
to retire this bond (by repurchasing it in the open market), it would have to repay more 
than the outstanding principal. If it chose to call the callable bond instead, the issuer 
would simply pay the outstanding principal. Hence, if yields have dropped, it is cheaper 
to retire the callable bond. In other words, by exercising the call on the callable bond 
and then immediately refinancing, the issuer can lower its borrowing costs. Conversely, 
if yields have increased after the issue date, there is no reason to refinance. Both bonds 
would be trading at a discount. Even if the issuer wished to retire some bonds, it would 
be better off by repurchasing either bond at less than par in the market than by calling 
the callable bond for par. Thus, when yields have risen, the issuer will not choose to 
exercise the call on the callable bond.
Let’s consider this scenario from the perspective of a bondholder. As we have seen, the 
issuer will exercise the call option only when the coupon rate of the bond exceeds the 
prevailing market rate. Therefore, the only time the call is exercised, the bondholder finds 
herself in the position of looking for an alternative investment when market rates are lower 
than the bond’s coupon rate. That is, the holder of a callable bond faces reinvestment risk 
precisely when it hurts: when market rates are lower than the coupon rate she is currently 
receiving. This makes the callable bond relatively less attractive to the bondholder than the 
identical non-callable bond. Consequently, a callable bond will trade at a lower price (and 
therefore a higher yield) than an otherwise equivalent non-callable bond.
Let’s take a concrete example—a bond that is callable at par on only one specific date. 
Figure 24.2 plots the price of a callable bond and an otherwise identical non-callable bond 
on the call date as a function of the yield on the non-callable bond. When the yield of the 
non-callable bond is less than the coupon, the callable bond will be called, so its price is 
$100. If this yield is greater than the coupon, then the callable bond will not be called, so it 
has the same price as the non-callable bond. Note that the callable bond price is capped at

par: The price can be low when yields are high, but does not rise above the par value when 
the yield is low.
Before the call date, investors anticipate the optimal strategy that the issuer will follow, 
and the bond price reflects this strategy, as Figure 24.3 illustrates. When market yields are 
high relative to the bond coupon, investors anticipate that the likelihood of exercising the 
call is low and the bond price is similar to an otherwise identical non-callable bond. On the 
other hand, when market yields are low relative to the bond coupon, investors anticipate 
that the bond will likely be called, so its price is close to the price of a non-callable bond 
that matures on the call date. Because the issuer holds the option of whether to call the 
bond, the callable bond’s price is always below that of the non-callable bonds.

New York City Calls Its Municipal Bonds
In November 2004, New York City announced plans to call 
$430 million of its municipal bonds. New York City was an 
AAA-rated borrower, and these bonds paid relatively high 
interest rates of 6% to 8%. The city would be refinancing 
the bonds with new bonds that paid interest rates between 
3% and 5%. In total, New York City called 63 individual 
bond issues with original maturities between 2012 and 
2019.
Investors were attracted to the older municipal bonds 
because of their higher yields. Despite these yields, they 
did not expect New York City to call these bonds, so the 
market price for these bonds earlier in the year was 10% 
to 20% higher than their face value. When New York City 
announced its plans to call the bonds at prices slightly higher 
than the face value investors were caught off guard and the 
market value of the bonds fell accordingly. Investors suffered 
losses of 15% or more on their AAA-rated investment.
Investors did not expect New York City to call these 
bonds because it had already refinanced the debt in the 
early 1990s. According to Internal Revenue Service rules, 
the city could not refinance again with another tax-exempt 
issue. However, New York City surprised the market when 
it decided to refinance the bonds by issuing taxable bonds 
instead. Although it happens rarely, this example illus-
trates that investors are sometimes surprised by issuer call 
strategies.

Chapter 24  Debt Financing
The yield to maturity of a callable bond is calculated as if the bond were not callable. 
That is, the yield is still defined as the discount rate that sets the present value of the 
­promised payments equal to the current price, ignoring the call feature. We can think of the 
yield of a callable bond as the interest rate the bondholder receives if the bond is not called 
and repaid in full. Because the price of a callable bond is lower than the price of an oth-
erwise identical non-callable bond, the yield to maturity of a callable bond will be higher 
than the yield to maturity for its non-callable counterpart.
The assumption that underlies the yield calculation of a callable bond—that it will not 
be called—is not always realistic, so bond traders often quote the yield to call. The yield 
to call (YTC) is the annual yield of a callable bond assuming that the bond is called at the 
earliest opportunity. Again, because the issuer has the option not to call the bond on its 
call date, its yield to call will be higher than an identical non-callable bond that matures 
on the call date.
Example 24.2
Calculating the Yield to Call

IBM has just issued a callable (at par) five-year, 8% coupon bond with annual coupon pay-
ments. The bond can be called at par in one year or anytime thereafter on a coupon payment

to call?

Sinking Funds
Another way bonds are repaid is through a sinking fund. Instead of repaying the entire 
principal balance on the maturity date, the company makes regular payments into a sink-
ing fund administered by a trustee over the life of the bond. These payments are then used 
to repurchase bonds. In this way, the company can reduce the amount of outstanding debt 
without affecting the cash flows of the remaining bonds.
How does the trustee decide which bonds to repurchase? If the bonds are trading below 
their face value, the company simply repurchases the bonds in the market. But if a bond is 
trading above its face value, because the bonds are repurchased at par the decision is made 
by lottery.
Sinking fund provisions usually specify a minimum rate at which the issuer must con-
tribute to the fund. In some cases, the issuer has the option to accelerate these payments. 
Because the sinking fund allows the issuer to repurchase the bonds at par, the option to 
accelerate the payments is another form of call provision.
The manner in which an outstanding balance is paid off using a sinking fund depends 
on the issue. Some issues specify equal payments over the life of the bond, ultimately retir-
ing the issue on the maturity date of the bond. In other cases, the sinking fund payments 
are not sufficient to retire the entire issue and the company must make a large payment 
on the maturity date, known as a balloon payment. Often, sinking fund payments start 
only a few years after the bond issue. Bonds can be issued with both a sinking fund and 
call provision.
Convertible Provisions
Another way bonds are retired is by converting them into equity. Some corporate bonds 
have a provision that gives the bondholder an option to convert each bond owned into a 
fixed number of shares of common stock at a ratio called the conversion ratio. Such bonds 
are called convertible bonds. The provision usually gives bondholders the right to convert 
the bond into stock at any time up to the maturity date for the bond.9
To understand how a conversion feature changes the value of a bond, note that this 
provision gives a call option to the holder of a bond. Thus, a convertible bond can be 
thought of as a regular bond plus a special type of call option called a warrant. A warrant 
is a call option written by the company itself on new stock (whereas a regular call option is 
written on existing stock). That is, when a holder of a warrant exercises it and thereby

purchases stock, the company delivers this stock by issuing new stock. In all other respects, 
a warrant is identical to a call option.10
On the maturity date of the bond, the strike price of the embedded warrant in a con-
vertible bond is equal to the face value of the bond divided by the conversion ratio—that 
is, the conversion price. So, on the maturity date of a convertible bond with a $1000 face 
value and a conversion ratio of 15, if you converted the bond into stock, you would receive 
15 shares. If you did not convert, you would receive $1000. Hence, by converting, you 
essentially “paid” $1000 for 15 shares, implying a price per share of 1000/15 = $66.67. If 
the price of the stock exceeds $66.67, you would choose to convert; otherwise, you would 
take the cash. At maturity, you will choose to convert whenever the stock price exceeds the 
conversion price. As shown in Figure 24.4, the value of the bond is the maximum of its 
face value ($1000) and the value of 15 shares of stock.
What about prior to the maturity date? If the stock does not pay a dividend, then we 
know from our discussion of call options in Chapter 20 that it is never optimal to exercise 
a call early. Hence, the holder of a convertible bond should wait until the maturity date 
of the bond before deciding whether to convert. The value of the bond prior to maturity 
is plotted in Figure 24.4. If the stock price is low so that the embedded warrant is deep 
out-of-the-money, the conversion provision is not worth much and the bond’s value is 
close to the value of a straight bond—an otherwise identical bond without the conversion 
provision. When the stock price is high and the embedded warrant is deep in-the-money, 
then the convertible bond trades close to—but higher than (to reflect the time value of the 
option)—the value of the bond if converted.
10When a regular call is exercised, the loss incurred by the writer of the call accrues to an unknown third 
party. However, when a warrant is exercised, the loss accrues to the equity holders of the firm (because 
they are forced to sell new equity at below-market value), which includes the holder of the warrant (upon 
exercise, the warrant holder becomes an equity holder). This dilution effect implies that the gain from 
exercising a warrant is less than that from a call, so warrants are worth less than calls.

Convertible Bond Value
At maturity, the value of 
a convertible bond is the 
maximum of the value of a 
$1000 straight bond and 
15 shares of stock, and will 
be converted if the stock is 
above the conversion price. 
Prior to maturity, the value 
of the convertible bond will 
depend upon the likelihood 
of conversion, and will be 
above that of a straight 
bond or 15  
shares of stock.

Often, companies issue convertible bonds that are callable. With these bonds, if the 
issuer calls them, the holder can choose to convert rather than let the bonds be called. 
When the bonds are called, the holder faces exactly the same decision as he would on the 
maturity date of the bonds: He will choose to convert if the stock price exceeds the conver-
sion price and let the bonds be called otherwise. Thus, by calling the bonds, a company 
can force bondholders to make their decision to exercise the conversion option earlier than 
they would otherwise like to. Therefore, calling a convertible bond transfers the remaining 
time value of the conversion option from bondholders to shareholders.
When a corporation issues convertible debt, it is giving the holder an option—a war-
rant, in this case. As we learned in Chapter 20, options always have a positive value; hence, 
a convertible bond is worth more than an otherwise identical straight bond. Consequently, 
if both bonds are issued at par, the non-convertible bond must offer a higher interest rate. 
Many people point to the lower interest rates of convertible bonds and argue that therefore 
convertible debt is cheaper than straight debt.
As we learned in Chapter 14, in a perfect market, the choice of financing cannot affect the 
value of a firm. Hence, the argument that convertible debt is cheaper because it has a lower 
interest rate is fallacious. Convertible debt carries a lower interest rate because it has an embed-
ded warrant. If the price of a firm were subsequently to rise so that the bondholders choose to 
convert, the current shareholders will have to sell an equity stake in their firm for below-­market 
value. The lower interest rate is compensation for the possibility that this event will occur.

help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
24.1  Corporate Debt
	
n	 Companies can raise debt using different sources. Typical types of debt are public debt, which 
trades in a public market, and private debt, which is negotiated directly with a bank or a small 
group of investors. The securities that companies issue when raising debt are called corporate 
bonds.
	
n	 For public offerings, the bond agreement takes the form of an indenture, a formal contract 
between the bond issuer and a trust company. The indenture lays out the terms of the bond 
issue.
	
n	 Four types of corporate bonds are typically issued: notes, debentures, mortgage bonds, and 
asset-backed bonds. Notes and debentures are unsecured; mortgage bonds and asset-backed 
bonds are secured.
	
n	 Corporate bonds differ in their level of seniority. In case of bankruptcy, senior debt is paid in 
full first before subordinated debt is paid.
	
n	 International bonds are classified into four broadly defined categories: domestic bonds, which 
trade in foreign markets; foreign bonds, which are issued in a local market by a foreign entity; 
Eurobonds, which are not denominated in the local currency of the country in which they are 
issued; and global bonds, which trade in several markets simultaneously.

Chapter 24  Debt Financing
	
n	 Private debt can be in the form of term loans or private placements. A term loan is a bank loan 
that lasts for a specific term. A private placement is a bond issue that is sold to a small group of 
investors.
24.2  Other Types of Debt
	
n	 Governments, states, and other state-sponsored enterprises issue bonds as well.
	
n	 The U.S. Treasury has issued four different kinds of securities: Treasury bills, Treasury notes, 
Treasury bonds, and TIPS.
	
n	 Municipal bonds (“munis”) are issued by state and local governments. Their distinguishing 
characteristic is that the income on municipal bonds is not taxable at the federal level.
	
n	 An asset-backed security (ABS) is a security that is made up of other financial securities, that 
is, the security’s cash flows come from the cash flows of the underlying financial securities that 
“back” it.
	
n	 A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is an asset-backed security backed by home mortgages. U.S. 
government agencies, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA, or 
“Ginnie Mae”), are the largest issuers in this sector.
	
n	 Holders of agency-issued mortgage-backed securities face prepayment risk, which is the risk 
that they will find that the bond will be partially (or wholly) repaid earlier than expected. Hold-
ers of privately issued mortgage-backed securities also face default risk.
	
n	 A collateralized debt obligation is an asset-backed security that is backed by other asset-backed 
securities.
24.3  Bond Covenants
	
n	 Covenants are restrictive clauses in the bond contract that help investors by limiting the issuer’s 
ability to take actions that will increase the default risk and reduce the value of the bonds.
24.4  Repayment Provisions
	
n	 A call provision gives the issuer of the bond the right (but not the obligation) to retire the bond 
after a specific date (but before maturity).
	
n	 A callable bond will generally trade at a lower price than an otherwise equivalent non-callable 
bond.
	
n	 The yield to call is the yield of a callable bond assuming that the bond is called at the earliest 
opportunity.
	
n	 Another way in which a bond is repaid before maturity is by periodically repurchasing part of 
the debt through a sinking fund.
	
n	 Some corporate bonds, known as convertible bonds, have a provision that allows the holder to 
convert them into equity.
	
n	 Convertible debt carries a lower interest rate than other comparable non-convertible debt.

You are still employed at The Home Depot. Recall the presentation of Chapter 15’s plan to increase 
leverage to the Board of Directors. The idea of changing Home Depot’s capital structure stirred some 
conversations among top executives. The CFO and other top managers in the finance division are 
all aware that increasing the debt load will have ramifications in the credit markets. Specifically, they 
realize that the firm’s debt rating could change, which will raise the cost of borrowing as well as pos-
sibly lower the value of the existing debt. No one is exactly sure what the impact will be, but they all 
agree that it deserves investigation.
Because you prepared the spreadsheet data, you have been summoned to an executive-level meet-
ing and asked to estimate the impact of increasing the debt of the firm. Use the spreadsheet from 
Chapter 15’s Data Case as a starting point. You are to consider four different scenarios: issuing $1 
billion, $10 billion, $20 billion, and $30 billion in new debt. In each case, proceeds from the debt 
will be used to repurchase stock. The CFO believes that the $1 billion level will not affect the firm’s 
credit rating. However, each larger increase in debt will cause the debt to be downgraded one letter 
Data Case

grade (e.g., from Baa to Ba). For example, the $10 billion scenario will lower the ­current debt rating 
one level, the $20 billion scenario would lower the rating still another level, and so on. Your job is to 
determine the impact of additional debt on borrowing costs at each debt level. Assume the new debt 
will be raised by issuing 10-year bonds.
	
1.	 Determine the current debt rating for The Home Depot.
n	 Research the current bond rating at FINRA (finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/). 
Select the “Corporate” toggle, enter the symbol for Home Depot (HD), and click “Show 
Results.”
n	 What is the Moody’s bond rating on the Home Depot bond with the maturity closest to 10 
years from today? What is the yield on this bond?
	
2.	 Because lower bond ratings will lead to higher interest costs, you will need to determine those 
costs. Go to Bonds Online (www.bondsonline.com) and click “Today’s Market.” Next, click “US 
Corporate Bond Spreads.” You will see a table of bond spreads prepared by Reuters and the date 
the table was prepared right below it. These spreads represent the increased yield a bond must pay 
over the U.S. Treasury of the same maturity. Choose the 10-year spread for Home Depot’s cur-
rent rating and the three ratings below it. The spreads are in basis points; a basis point is 1/100th 
of a percentage point (thus, 50 basis points is 0.5%). We will adjust these old spreads to estimate 
the current spread.
n	 Because these spreads are dated, you will need to create new yield spreads for the various rat-
ings. Use the current difference between the Home Depot bond’s yield and the 10-year Trea-
sury as the true spread for the rating. Using Excel, compute the spreads for the other ratings, 
by adding the difference in spreads from the table to the new true spread for Home Depot’s 
rating. Finally, determine the yield for each rating by adding the new spread to the yield on 
the 10-year Treasury bond.
n	 Compute the required yields on 10-year bonds at each of the new debt levels requested.
	
3.	 What factors cause the bond rating to fall, and the bond yields to increase, as Home Depot

the necessary property, plant, and equipment. As an alternative to purchasing these 
assets outright, the firm can lease them. You are probably familiar with leases if you 
have leased a car or rented an apartment. These consumer rentals are similar to the 
leases used by businesses: The owner retains title to the asset, and the firm pays for 
its use of the asset through regular lease payments. When firms lease property, plant, 
or equipment, the leases generally exceed one year. This chapter focuses on such long-
term leases.
If you can purchase an asset, you can probably lease it. Commercial real estate, com-
puters, trucks, copy machines, airplanes, and even power plants are examples of assets that 
firms can lease rather than buy. Equipment leasing is a rapidly growing industry, with more 
than one-half of the world’s leasing now being done by companies in Europe and Japan. In 
2012 more than 33% of the productive assets acquired by U.S. companies were procured 
through leasing contracts, for a total leasing volume exceeding $264 billion. Eighty-five 
percent of U.S. companies lease all or some of their equipment.1 For example, it may come 
as a surprise that airlines do not own many of their own airplanes. The top aircraft leasing 
company by fleet size at the start of 2015 was GE Commercial Aviation Services. GE owns 
and manages over 2200 aircraft, the world’s largest commercial airplane fleet.2 GE leases 
these commercial aircraft to some 270 airline customers in 75 countries.
As you will learn, leases are not merely an alternative to purchasing; they also 
function as an important financing method for tangible assets. In fact, long-term leas-
ing is the most common method of equipment financing. How do companies such as

Chapter 25  Leasing
GE Commercial Aviation Services set the terms for their leases? How do their customers—the 
commercial airlines—evaluate and negotiate these leases? In this chapter, we first discuss the basic 
types of leases and provide an overview of the accounting and tax treatment of leases. We next 
show how to evaluate the lease-versus-buy decision. Firms often cite various benefits to leasing as 
compared to purchasing property and equipment, and we conclude the chapter with an evaluation 
of their reasoning.
	
25.1	 The Basics of Leasing
A lease is a contract between two parties: the lessee and the lessor. The lessee is liable for 
periodic payments in exchange for the right to use the asset. The lessor is the owner of the 
asset, who is entitled to the lease payments in exchange for lending the asset.
Most leases involve little or no upfront payment. Instead, the lessee commits to make 
regular lease (or rental) payments for the term of the contract. At the end of the contract 
term, the lease specifies who will retain ownership of the asset and at what terms. The lease 
also specifies any cancellation provisions, the options for renewal and purchase, and the 
obligations for maintenance and related servicing costs.
Examples of Lease Transactions
Many types of lease transactions are possible based on the relationship between the lessee 
and the lessor. In a sales-type lease, the lessor is the manufacturer (or a primary dealer) 
of the asset. For example, IBM both manufactures and leases computers. Similarly, Xerox 
leases its copy machines. Manufacturers generally set the terms of these leases as part of a 
broader sales and pricing strategy, and they may bundle other services or goods (such as 
software, maintenance, or product upgrades) as part of the lease.
In a direct lease, the lessor is not the manufacturer, but is often an independent 
company that specializes in purchasing assets and leasing them to customers. For exam-
ple, Ryder Systems, Inc., owns more than 135,000 commercial trucks, tractors, and 
trailers, which it leases to small businesses and large enterprises throughout the United 
States, ­Canada, and the United Kingdom. In many instances of direct leases, the lessee 
identifies the equipment it needs first and then finds a leasing company to purchase 
the asset.
If a firm already owns an asset it would prefer to lease, it can arrange a sale and ­leaseback 
transaction. In this type of lease, the lessee receives cash from the sale of the asset and then 
makes lease payments to retain the use of the asset. In 2002, San Francisco Municipal 
Railway (Muni) used the $35 million in proceeds from the sale and leaseback of 118 of its 
light-rail vehicles to offset a large operating budget deficit. The purchaser, CIBC World 
Markets of Canada, received a tax benefit from depreciating the rail cars, something Muni 
could not do as a public transit agency.
With many leases, the lessor provides the initial capital necessary to purchase the asset, 
and then receives and retains the lease payments. In a leveraged lease, however, the lessor 
borrows from a bank or other lender to obtain the initial capital for the purchase, using 
the lease payments to pay interest and principal on the loan. Also, in some circumstances, 
the lessor is not an independent company but rather a separate business partnership, called 
a special-purpose entity (SPE), which is created by the lessee for the sole purpose of 
­obtaining the lease. SPEs are commonly used in synthetic leases, which are designed to 
obtain specific accounting and tax treatment (discussed further in Section 25.2).

	
25.1  The Basics of Leasing	
923
Lease Payments and Residual Values
Suppose your business needs a new $20,000 electric forklift for its warehouse operations, 
and you are considering leasing the forklift for four years. In this case, the lessor will pur-
chase the forklift and allow you to use it for four years. At that point, you will return the 
forklift to the lessor. How much should you expect to pay for the right to use the forklift 
for the first four years of its life?
The cost of the lease will depend on the asset’s residual value, which is its market value 
at the end of the lease. Suppose the residual value of the forklift in four years will be $6000. 
If lease payments of amount L are made monthly, then the lessor’s cash flows from the 
transaction are as follows (note that lease payments are typically made at the beginning of 
each payment period):

Lease Terms in a Perfect Market
Problem
Suppose the purchase price of the forklift is $20,000, its residual value in four years is certain 
to be $6000, and there is no risk that the lessee will default on the lease. If the risk-free interest 
rate is a 6% APR with monthly compounding, what would be the monthly lease payment for a 
four-year lease in a perfect capital market?
Solution
Because all cash flows are risk free, we can discount them using the risk-free interest rate of 
6%/12 = 0.5% per month. From Eq. 25.1,
PV(Lease Payments) = $20,000 - $6000/1.00548 = $15,277.41
What monthly lease payment L has this present value? We can interpret the lease payments as an 
annuity. Because the first lease payment starts today, we can view the lease as an initial payment 
of L plus a 47-month annuity of L. Thus, using the annuity formula, we need to find L so that
15,277.41 = L + L *

1.00547≤R
In a perfect capital market (where lessors compete with one another in initiating leases), 
the lease payment should be set so that the NPV of the transaction is zero and the lessor 
breaks even:
	
PV(Lease Payments) = Purchase Price - PV(Residual Value)
(25.1)
In other words, in a perfect market, the cost of leasing is equivalent to the cost of purchasing 
and reselling the asset.
Thus, the amount of the lease payment will depend on the purchase price, the residual 
value, and the appropriate discount rate for the cash flows.

924	
Chapter 25  Leasing
Leases Versus Loans
Alternatively, you could obtain a four-year loan for the purchase price and buy the forklift 
outright. If M is the monthly payment for a fully amortizing loan, the lender’s cash flows 
will be as follows:
Assuming the loan is fairly priced, the loan payments would be such that
	
PV(Loan Payments) = Purchase Price	
(25.2)
Comparing Eq. 25.2 with Eq. 25.1, we see that while with a standard loan we are financ-
ing the entire cost of the asset, with a lease we are financing only the cost of the economic 
depreciation of the asset during the term of the lease. Because we are getting the entire asset 
when we purchase it with the loan, the loan payments are higher than the lease payments.

Loan Payments in a Perfect Market
Problem
Suppose that you purchase the forklift for $20,000 by borrowing the purchase price using a four-
year annuity loan. What would the monthly loan payment be in a perfect capital market where 
the risk-free interest rate is a 6% APR with monthly compounding, assuming no risk of default? 
How does this compare with the lease payment of Example 25.1?
Solution
Because all cash flows are risk free, we can discount them using the risk-free interest rate of 
6%/12 = 0.5% per month. Because loan payments are made at the end of each month, using 
the annuity formula to value the loan payments, Eq. 25.2 becomes

Of course, while the lease payments are lower, with the lease, we have the use of the forklift for

25.1  The Basics of Leasing	
925
The monthly loan payments in Example 25.2 exceed the lease payments in Example 
25.1. This difference does not mean the lease is superior to the loan. While the lease pay-
ments are lower, with the lease, we have use of the forklift for four years only. If we purchase 
the forklift using the loan, we own it after four years and can sell it for its residual value of 
$6000. Alternatively, if we lease the forklift and want to keep it after the lease terminates, 
we can purchase it for its fair market value of $6000. Once we consider the benefit of this 
residual value, by the Law of One Price, the total cost of purchasing with either the loan or 
the lease is the same. That is, combining Eq. 25.2 and Eq. 25.1, we have
	
PV(Lease Payments) + PV(Residual Value) = PV(Loan Payments)	
(25.3)
In other words, in a perfect market, the cost of leasing and then purchasing the asset is ­equivalent 
to the cost of borrowing to purchase the asset.3
End-of-Term Lease Options
In Example 25.1, we assumed that at the end of the lease the forklift would be returned 
to the lessor, who would then obtain its residual market value of $6000. In reality, other 
lease terms are possible. In many cases, the lease allows the lessee to obtain ownership of 
the asset for some price.
n	 A fair market value (FMV) lease gives the lessee the option to purchase the asset at its 
fair market value at the termination of the lease. (Depending on the asset, determining

the Cost of Capital Services,” Journal of Finance 31(3) (1976): 761–786; and W. Lewellen, M. Long, and 
J. McConnell, “Asset Leasing in Competitive Capital Markets,” Journal of Finance 31(3) (1976): 787–798.
Calculating Auto Lease Payments
Rather than use the annuity formula to calculate the lease 
payments, as we did in Example 25.1, in many cases, prac-
titioners use the following approximation to calculate the 
lease payments:
L = Purchase Price - Residual Value
Term
Avg. Depreciation
+ a Purchase Price + Residual Value
2
b * Interest Rate
Financing Cost
where the purchase price includes any fees charged on the 
lease (and is net of any down payment), the term is the 
number of payment periods, and the interest rate is for 
a payment period. The idea behind this approximation 
is that the first term is the average depreciation over a 
payment period and the second term is the interest cost 
associated with the average value of the asset. The sum is 
what you have to pay to use the asset over one payment 
period.
Despite its simplicity, this formula is very accurate for 
lease terms up to five years and interest rates up to 10%. 
Using it to calculate the lease payments in Example 25.1 
gives
20,000 - 6000
48
+ ¢ 20,000 + 6000
2
≤* 0.005 = $356.67
which is within $1 of the amount calculated in Example 
25.1.
This approximation for the lease payment is used to 
­calculate the payment on automobile leases. In that case, the 
formula is often stated as
L = Purchase Price - Residual Value
Term
+ (Purchase Price + Residual Value) * Money Factor
leaving many first-time car lessees wondering why they have 
to pay interest on both the purchase price and the residual 
value. In reality, all that has happened is that the factor of 2 
is subsumed into the money factor; that is, the money factor 
is half the interest rate.

Chapter 25  Leasing
its fair market value may be complicated. The lease will typically stipulate a procedure 
for doing so, and it often will require estimates of the fair market value to be provided 
by an independent third party.) With perfect capital markets, there is no difference 
between an FMV lease and a lease in which the assets are retained by the lessor, because 
acquiring the asset at its fair market value is a zero-NPV transaction.
n	 In a $1.00 out lease (also known as a finance lease), ownership of the asset transfers 
to the lessee at the end of the lease for a nominal cost of $1.00. Thus, the lessee will 
continue to have use of the asset for its entire economic life. The lessee has effectively 
purchased the asset by making the lease payments. As a result, this type of lease is in 
many ways equivalent to financing the asset with a standard loan.
n	 In a fixed price lease, the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the 
lease for a fixed price that is set upfront in the lease contract. This type of lease is very 
common for consumer leases (such as for autos). Notice that this kind of lease gives 
the lessee an option: At the end of the lease, if the market value of the asset exceeds the 
fixed price, the lessee can buy the asset at below its market value; if the market value 
of the asset does not exceed the fixed price, however, the lessee can walk away from the 
lease and purchase the asset for less money elsewhere. Consequently, the lessor will set a 
higher lease rate to compensate for the value of this option to the lessee.
n	 In a fair market value cap lease, the lessee can purchase the asset at the minimum of 
its fair market value and a fixed price (the “cap”). The lessee has the same option as in a 
fixed price lease, although the option in this case is easier to exercise because the lessee 
does not have to find a similar asset elsewhere to buy when the fixed price exceeds the 
market value.
Example 25.3
Lease Payments and End-of-Lease Options
Problem
Compute the lease payments for the forklift lease of Example 25.1 if the lease is (a) a fair market 
value lease, (b) a $1.00 out lease, or (c) a fixed price lease that allows the lessee to buy the asset at 
the end of the lease for $4000.
Solution
With the FMV lease, the lessee can buy the forklift for its fair market value of $6000 at the end 
of the lease. The lessor obtains a residual value of $6000, either from the forklift itself or from 
the payment from the lessee. Thus, the lease payments will be unchanged from Example 25.1, 
or $357 per month.
With the $1.00 out lease, the lessor receives essentially no residual value. Thus, the lease pay-
ments themselves will have to compensate the lessor for the full $20,000 purchase price. The 
lease payments are therefore

These payments are slightly less than the loan payments of $470 per month calculated in 
Example 25.2 because the lease payments occur at the beginning—rather than the end—of 
the month.
With the fixed price lease, because the forklift will be worth $6000 for certain, the lessee will 
exercise the option to purchase it for $4000. As a result, the lessor will receive only $4000 at the

Other Lease Provisions
Leases are privately negotiated contracts and can contain many more provisions than are 
described here. For example, they may include early cancellation options that allow the les-
see to end the lease early (perhaps for a fee). They may contain buyout options that allow 
the lessee to purchase the asset before the end of the lease term. Clauses may allow the les-
see to trade in and upgrade the equipment to a newer model at certain points in the lease. 
Each lease agreement can be tailored to fit the precise nature of the asset and the needs of 
the parties at hand.
These features of leases will be priced as part of the lease payment. Terms that give valu-
able options to the lessee raise the amount of the lease payments, whereas terms that restrict 
these options will lower them. Absent market imperfections, leases represent another form 
of zero-NPV financing available to a firm, and the Modigliani-Miller propositions apply: 
Leases neither increase nor decrease firm value, but serve only to divide the firm’s cash flows 
and risks in different ways.4

25.2	 Accounting, Tax, and Legal Consequences 
of Leasing
We have seen that with perfect capital markets, leasing represents yet another zero-NPV 
financing alternative for a firm. Thus, the decision to lease is often driven by real-world 
market imperfections related to leasing’s accounting, tax, and legal treatment.5 In particu-
lar, when a firm leases an asset, a number of important questions arise: Should the firm list 
the asset on its balance sheet and deduct depreciation expenses? Should the firm list the 
lease as a liability? Can the lease payments be deducted for tax purposes? In the event of 
bankruptcy, is the leased asset protected from creditors? As we will see in this section, the 
answers to these questions depend on how the lease is structured.

Asset Leasing Contracts,” Journal of Financial Economics 12(2) (1983): 237–261; and S. Grenadier, “Valu-

5Anyone who has ever considered leasing a car will be familiar with one such imperfection. In most states,

means lessees can avoid paying a substantial part of the sales tax purchasers must pay.

Leasing and the Balance Sheet
Problem
Harbord Cruise Lines currently has the following balance sheet (in millions of dollars):
Harbord is about to add a new fleet of cruise ships. The price of the fleet is $400 million. What 
will Harbord’s balance sheet look like if (a) it purchases the fleet by borrowing the $400 million, 
(b) it acquires the fleet through a $400 million capital lease, or (c) it acquires the fleet through 
an operating lease?
Solution
For parts (a) and (b), the balance sheet consequences are the same: The fleet becomes a new asset 
of the firm, and the $400 million becomes an additional liability.
Note that the firm’s debt-equity ratio increases in this case (from 900/700 = 1.29 to 1300/700 =
1.86).

Lease Accounting
When publicly traded firms disclose leasing transactions in their financial statements, they 
must follow the recommendations of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). 
For lessees, the FASB has historically distinguished two types of leases based on the lease 
terms, and this classification determines the lease’s accounting treatment:
n	 An operating lease is viewed as a rental for accounting purposes. In this case, the lessee 
reports the entire lease payment as an operating expense. The lessee does not deduct a 
depreciation expense for the asset and does not report the asset, or the lease payment 
liability, on its balance sheet. Operating leases are disclosed in the footnotes of the les-
see’s financial statements.
n	 A capital lease (also called a finance lease) is viewed as an acquisition for accounting pur-
poses. The asset acquired is listed on the lessee’s balance sheet, and the lessee incurs deprecia-
tion expenses for the asset. In addition, the present value of the future lease payments is listed 
as a liability, and the interest portion of the lease payment is deducted as an interest expense.6
The different accounting treatment for each type of lease will affect the firm’s balance 
sheet as well as its debt-equity ratio, as shown in Example 25.4.
6The accounting treatment of a capital lease for the lessor will depend on whether it is a sales-type lease, a 
direct lease, or a leveraged lease (a direct lease in which the lessor obtains more than 60% debt ­financing 
to purchase the asset, and the debt is non-recourse in that it is backed solely by the income from the asset).

	
25.2  Accounting, Tax, and Legal Consequences of Leasing 	
929
Because capital leases increase the apparent leverage on the firm’s balance sheet, firms 
sometimes prefer to have a lease categorized as an operating lease to keep it off the bal-
ance sheet. In its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS13), the FASB 
provides specific criteria that distinguish an operating lease from a capital lease. The lease 
is treated as a capital lease for the lessee and must be listed on the firm’s balance sheet if it 
satisfies any of the following conditions:
	
1.	 Title to the property transfers to the lessee at the end of the lease term.
	
2.	 The lease contains an option to purchase the asset at a bargain price that is 
­substantially less than its fair market value.
	
3.	 The lease term is 75% or more of the estimated economic life of the asset.
	
4.	 The present value of the minimum lease payments at the start of the lease is 90% or 
more of the asset’s fair market value.
These conditions are designed to identify situations in which the lease provides the lessee 
with use of the asset for a large fraction of its useful life. For example, a $1.00 out lease sat-
isfies the second condition and so would be ruled a capital lease for accounting ­purposes. 
Firms that prefer to keep a lease off-balance-sheet will often structure lease ­contracts to 
avoid these conditions.
Despite FASB’s strict rules about which leases could be characterized as operating leases, 
many investors as well as the SEC believed that these rules were being abused. In response, 
in 2006 the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) embarked on 
a joint project to reform the rules. The result is a new standard, announced in 2016 and 
slated to take full effect in 2019. While the reporting of lease expenses will continue to 
depend on the lease characterization, under the new rules firms will now have to recognize 
all leases with terms longer than one year on their balance sheets.
Operating Leases at Alaska Air Group
Alaska Air Group, Inc., was incorporated in 1985 as a hold-
ing company with two main subsidiaries: Alaska Airlines, 
Inc., and Horizon Air Industries. Alaska Airlines is a major 
airline with flights throughout the United States. Horizon 
Air is a regional airline concentrated in the Pacific North-
west. Typical for airlines, Alaska Air Group leases many of 
its aircraft, as is summarized in the following table:
Alaska Airlines leases more than a quarter of its aircraft, 
and Horizon leases almost one third. These leases are 
almost exclusively operating leases. (In many cases, the les-
sors are trusts established by a third party specifically to 
purchase, finance, and lease aircraft to Alaska.) In addi-
tion, Alaska leases the majority of its airport and terminal 
facilities.
Because these leases are operating leases, Alaska Air 
Group reports the entire lease payment as an operating 
expense. During 2014, Alaska Air reported aircraft rent 
expenses of $110 million relative to operating revenues of 
$5.4 billion. The firm did not deduct a depreciation expense 
for its leased aircraft, and these aircraft did not show up as 
an asset on its balance sheet (although Alaska Air does report 
the value of the aircraft that it owns as assets on its balance 
sheet). And though the lease obligations are not listed as a 
liability, if they were they would more than double Alaska 
Air’s reported debt.

If the fleet is acquired through an operating lease, as described in part (c), there is no change 
in the original balance sheet: The fleet is not listed as an asset, and the lease is not viewed as a 
liability. Thus, the apparent leverage ratio is unchanged.

Chapter 25  Leasing
The Tax Treatment of Leases
The categories used to report leases on the financial statements affect the values of assets on 
the balance sheet, but they have no direct effect on the cash flows that result from a leasing 
transaction. The IRS has its own classification rules that determine the tax treatment of a 
lease. Because the tax treatment does affect the cash flows, these rules are more significant 
from a financial valuation perspective.
The IRS separates leases into two broad categories: true tax leases and non-tax leases. 
These categories are roughly equivalent to operating and capital leases, although the 
­defining criteria are not identical.
In a true tax lease, the lessor receives the depreciation deductions associated with the 
ownership of the asset. The lessee can deduct the full amount of the lease payments as an 
operating expense, and these lease payments are treated as revenue for the lessor.
Although the legal ownership of the asset resides with the lessor, in a non-tax lease, the 
lessee receives the depreciation deductions. The lessee can also deduct the interest portion 
of the lease payments as an interest expense. The interest portion of the lease payment is 
interest income for the lessor.
IRS Revenue Ruling 55–540 provides the conditions that determine the tax ­classification 
of a lease. If the lease satisfies any of these conditions, it is treated as a non-tax lease:
	
1.	 The lessee obtains equity in the leased asset.
	
2.	 The lessee receives ownership of the asset on completion of all lease payments.
	
3.	 The total amount that the lessee is required to pay for a relatively short period of 
use constitutes an inordinately large proportion of the total value of the asset.
Example 25.5
Operating Versus Capital Leases
Problem
Consider a seven-year fair market value lease for a $12.5 million Gulfstream Jet with a remaining 
useful life of 10 years. Suppose the monthly lease payments are $175,000 and the appropriate 
discount rate is a 6% APR with monthly compounding. Would this lease be classified as an oper-
ating lease or a capital lease for the lessee? What if the lease contract gave the lessee the option to 
cancel the contract after five years?
Solution
We compute the present value of the monthly lease payments at the beginning of the lease 
using the annuity formula with a monthly interest rate of 6%/12 = 0.5% and 7 * 12 - 1 = 83 
monthly payments after the initial payment. Thus,
PV(Lease Payments) = 175,000 * J1 +
1
0.005 ¢1 -
1
1.00583 ≤R = $12.04 million
Because the present value of the lease payments is 12.04/12.50 = 96.3% of the value of the jet, 
the lease satisfies condition 4 and so it is a capital lease.
If the lessee can cancel the contract after five years, then the minimum number of lease 
­payments is 60 under the contract. In this case,
PV(Lease Payments) = 175,000 * J1 +
1
0.005
 ¢1 -
1
1.00559 ≤R = $9.10 million
This is only 9.10/12.5 = 73% of the value of the jet. As no other conditions for a capital lease 
are satisfied, the lease would be classified as an operating lease.

	
25.2  Accounting, Tax, and Legal Consequences of Leasing 	
931
	
4.	 The lease payments greatly exceed the current fair rental value of the asset.
	
5.	 The property may be acquired at a bargain price in relation to the fair market value 
of the asset at the time when the option may be exercised.
	
6.	 Some portion of the lease payments is specifically designated as interest or its 
equivalent.7
As with the accounting criteria, these rules attempt to identify cases in which a lease is 
likely to provide the lessee with use of the asset for a large fraction of its useful life. These 
rules are somewhat vague and are designed to provide the IRS with sufficient latitude to 
prevent the use of leases solely for tax avoidance.
For example, suppose a $200,000 asset was required to be depreciated by $20,000 per 
year for 10 years for tax purposes. By acquiring the asset through a four-year $1.00 out lease 
with payments of $50,000 per year, a firm could receive the same $200,000 total deduction 
at a faster rate if the lease were categorized as a true tax lease.8 The IRS rules prevent this 
type of transaction by categorizing such a lease as a non-tax lease (via ­conditions 3 and 5).
Leases and Bankruptcy
Recall from Chapter 16 that when a firm files for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
bankruptcy code, its assets are protected from seizure by the firm’s creditors while existing 
management is given the opportunity to propose a reorganization plan. Even secured lend-
ers are prevented from taking the assets that serve as collateral for their loans during this 
period, which can last from a few months to several years. Instead, bankruptcy law permits 
the firm to continue to use the assets in an effort to remain a going concern.
The treatment of leased property in bankruptcy will depend on whether the lease is clas-
sified as a security interest or a true lease by the bankruptcy judge. If the lease is deemed to 
be a security interest, the firm is assumed to have effective ownership of the asset and the 
asset is protected against seizure. The lessor is then treated as any other secured creditor and 
must await the firm’s reorganization or ultimate liquidation.
If the lease is classified as a true lease in bankruptcy, then the lessor retains ownership 
rights over the asset. Within 120 days of filing Chapter 11, the bankrupt firm must choose 
whether to assume or reject the lease. If it assumes the lease, it must settle all pending 
claims and continue to make all promised lease payments. If it rejects the lease, the asset 
must be returned to the lessor (with any pending claims of the lessor becoming unsecured 
claims against the bankrupt firm).
Thus, if a lease contract is characterized as a true lease in bankruptcy, the lessor is in a 
superior position than a lender if the firm defaults. By retaining ownership of the asset, the 
lessor has the right to repossess it if the lease payments are not made, even if the firm seeks 
bankruptcy protection. A lease therefore allows the lessee to commit to give the lessor supe-
rior treatment in default compared to ordinary creditors. Such commitment is efficient if the 
asset would be more valuable in the hands of the lessor than if retained by the defaulted firm. 
In this case, the firm might choose to lease assets it would otherwise choose not to finance.9
7IRS Revenue Ruling 55–540, 1955. Additional considerations exist for the tax treatment for the lessor if 
the lease is a leveraged lease.
8This transaction would have the opposite tax consequence for the lessor: The lease payments would be 
taxed as revenues, but the cost of the asset would be depreciated at the slower rate. However, there can be 
an advantage if the lessor is in a lower tax bracket than the lessee.
9For an analysis of the consequences of this treatment of leases for a firm’s borrowing capacity, see 
A. Eisfeldt and A. Rampini, “Leasing, Ability to Repossess, and Debt Capacity,” Review of Financial 
­Studies 22(4) (2008): 1621–1657.

Chapter 25  Leasing
Whether a transaction is classified as a true lease or a security interest will depend on the 
facts of each case, but the distinction is very similar to the accounting and tax distinctions 
made earlier. Operating and true tax leases are generally viewed as true leases by the courts, 
whereas capital and non-tax leases are more likely to be viewed as a security interest. In 
particular, leases for which the lessee obtains possession of the asset for its remaining 
­economic life (either within the contract or through an option to renew or purchase at a 
­nominal charge) are generally deemed security interests.10

25.3	 The Leasing Decision
How should a firm decide whether to buy or lease an asset? Recall that in a perfect ­market 
the decision is irrelevant, so the real-world decision depends on market frictions. In this 
section, we consider one important market friction—taxes—and evaluate the financial 
consequences of the leasing decision from the perspective of the lessee. We show how 
to determine whether it is more attractive to lease an asset or to buy it and (potentially)

.htm#ucc1.
Synthetic Leases
Synthetic leases are designed to be treated as an operating 
lease for accounting purposes and as a non-tax lease for tax 
purposes. With a synthetic lease, the lessee is able to deduct 
depreciation and interest expenses for tax purposes, just as if 
it had borrowed to purchase the asset, but does not need to 
report the asset or the debt on its balance sheet.
To obtain this accounting and tax treatment, synthetic leases 
have typically been structured by creating a special-purpose 
entity that will act as the lessor and obtain financing, acquire the 
asset, and lease it to the firm. To ensure that the lease qualifies as 
an operating lease, the lease is structured so that it (1) provides 
a fixed purchase price at the end of the lease term based on an 
initial appraised value (and so is not a bargain price), (2) has 
a term less than 75% of the economic life of the asset (which 
is renewable under certain conditions), and (3) has minimum 
lease payments with a present value less than 90% of the fair 
value of the property. In addition, to avoid balance sheet con-
solidation, the owner of record of the SPE must make an initial 
minimum equity investment of 3% that remains at risk during 
the entire lease term. The lease can qualify as a non-tax lease by 
designating some portion of the lease payments as interest.
A major motivation for such leases appears to be that 
they allow firms to use debt while avoiding the accounting 
consequences of debt. In particular, by keeping the debt off 
the balance sheet, the firm’s debt-equity ratio is improved, 
its return on assets is generally raised, and, if the lease pay-
ments are less than the interest and depreciation expenses, 
its reported earnings per share will be higher.
These types of transactions were used and abused by 
Enron Corporation to boost its earnings and hide its liabili-
ties prior to its downfall. In the wake of the Enron scandal, 
the FASB significantly tightened the requirements for SPEs, 
raising the at-risk equity investment of the SPE to 10% and 
requiring that ownership truly be independent from the les-
sor. Investors have also reacted skeptically to such deals, forc-
ing many firms to avoid synthetic leases or unwind structures 
that were already in place. For example, in 2002, Krispy 
Kreme Doughnuts Corporation reversed its decision to use a 
synthetic lease to fund a new $35 million plant after an article 
critical of the transaction was published in Forbes magazine. 
Because of abuses like these, starting in 2019, the FASB will 
require all leases to be on-balance sheet items.

finance the purchase with debt. First, we consider a true tax lease; then, we turn to non-tax 
leases at the end of the section.
Cash Flows for a True Tax Lease
If a firm purchases a piece of equipment, the expense is a capital expenditure. Therefore, 
the purchase price can be depreciated over time, generating a depreciation tax shield. If the 
equipment is leased and the lease is a true tax lease, there is no capital expenditure, but the 
lease payments are an operating expense.
Let’s compare the cash flows arising from a true tax lease with those arising from a pur-
chase using an example. Emory Printing needs a new high-speed printing press. It can 
purchase one for $50,000 in cash. The machine will last five years, and it will be depreci-
ated for tax purposes using straight-line depreciation over that period.11 This means that 
Emory can deduct $10,000 per year for depreciation. Given its tax rate of 35%, Emory will 
therefore save $3500 per year in taxes from the depreciation deduction.
Alternatively, Emory can lease the machine instead of purchasing it. A five-year lease 
contract will cost $12,500 per year. Emory must make these payments at the beginning 
of each year. Because the lease is a true tax lease, Emory deducts the lease payments as an 
operating expense when they are paid. Thus, the after-tax cost of each lease payment is 
(1 - 35%) * 12,500 = $8125. The lease contract does not provide for maintenance or 
servicing of the machine, so these costs are identical whether the machine is leased or 
purchased.
Table 25.1 shows the free cash flow consequences of buying and leasing. Here, we con-
sider only the cash flows that differ as a result of leasing versus buying. We do not need to 
consider cash flows that would be the same in both situations, such as the sales revenues 
generated by having the machine and maintenance expenses. We have also assumed the 
machine has no residual value after five years if it is purchased. If any of these differences 
existed, we would include them in the cash flows. Recall from Eq. 8.6 of Chapter 8 that 
free cash flow can be calculated as EBITDA less taxes, capital expenditures and increases in 
net working capital, plus the depreciation tax shield (i.e., tax rate * depreciation expense). 
Thus, if Emory buys, the only change to FCF is from capital expenditures and the depre-
ciation tax shield, and if Emory leases, the only change is a reduction in EBITDA, and 
therefore taxes, from the lease payment.
11In practice, a more accelerated depreciation schedule would be used for tax purposes. We use ­straight-line 
depreciation here for simplicity.

Chapter 25  Leasing
Note that the cash flows of leasing differ from buying. A purchase requires a large ­initial 
outlay followed by a series of depreciation tax credits. In contrast, the cost of a leased 
machine is more evenly spread over time.
Lease Versus Buy (An Unfair Comparison)
Is it better for Emory to lease or buy the printing press? To begin to answer this question, 
let’s compare the present value of the cash flows in each transaction (or, equivalently, we 
can compute the NPV of the difference between the cash flows). To compute the present 
value, we need to determine the cost of capital.
The appropriate cost of capital depends, of course, on the risk of the cash flows. Lease 
payments are a fixed obligation of the firm. If Emory fails to make the lease payments, it 
will default on the lease. The lessor will seek the remaining lease payments and, in addi-
tion, will take back the printing press. In that sense, a lease is similar to a loan secured 
with the leased asset as collateral. Moreover, as discussed in Section 25.2, in a true lease the 
lessor is in an even better position than a secured creditor if the firm files for bankruptcy. 
Thus, the risk of the lease payments is no greater than the risk of secured debt, so it is reasonable 
to discount the lease payments at the firm’s secured borrowing rate.
The tax savings from the lease payments and from depreciation expenses are also low-
risk cash flows, as they are predetermined and will be realized as long as the firm generates 
positive income.12 Therefore, a common assumption in practice is to use the firm’s 
­borrowing rate for these cash flows as well.
If Emory’s borrowing rate is 8%, the cost of buying the machine has present value
 PV(Buy) = -50,000 + 3500
1.08 + 3500
1.082 + 3500
1.083 + 3500
1.084 + 3500
1.085
 = -$36,026
The cost of leasing the machine has present value
 PV(Lease) = -8125 - 8125
1.08 - 8125
1.082 - 8125
1.083 - 8125
1.084
 = -$35,036
Thus, leasing is cheaper than buying, with a net savings of $36,026 - $35,036 = $990.
The preceding analysis ignores an important point, however. When a firm enters into 
a lease, it is committing to lease payments that are a fixed future obligation of the firm. If 
the firm is in financial distress and cannot make the lease payments, the lessor can seize 
the machine. Moreover, the lease obligations themselves could trigger financial distress. 
Therefore, when a firm leases an asset, it is effectively adding leverage to its capital structure 
(whether or not the lease appears on the balance sheet for accounting purposes).
Because leasing is a form of financing, we should compare it to other financing options 
that Emory may have. Rather than buy the asset outright, Emory could borrow funds (or 
reduce its planned cash balances, and thereby increase its net debt) to finance the pur-
chase of the machine, thus matching the leverage of the lease. If Emory does borrow, it 
12Even if income is negative, these tax benefits may still be obtained through carryback or carryforward 
provisions that allow the firm to apply these credits against income that was generated in past or future 
years.

	
25.3  The Leasing Decision

will also benefit from the interest tax shield provided by leverage. This tax advantage may 
make ­borrowing to buy the machine more attractive than leasing. Thus, to evaluate a lease 
­correctly, we should compare it to purchasing the asset using an equivalent amount of 
leverage. In other words, the appropriate comparison is not lease versus buy, but rather 
lease versus borrow.
Lease Versus Borrow (The Right Comparison)
To compare leasing to borrowing, we must determine the amount of the loan that leads 
to the same level of fixed obligations that Emory would have with the lease. We call this 
loan the lease-equivalent loan. That is, the lease-equivalent loan is the loan that is required 
on the purchase of the asset that leaves the purchaser with the same obligations as the lessee 
would have.13
The Lease-Equivalent Loan.  To compute the lease-equivalent loan in Emory’s case, we 
first compute the difference between the cash flows from leasing versus buying, which we 
refer to as the incremental free cash flow of leasing. As Table 25.2 shows, relative to buy-
ing, leasing saves cash upfront but results in lower future cash flows. The incremental free 
cash flow in years 1 through 5 represents the effective leverage the firm takes on by leasing. 
Alternatively, Emory could take on this same leverage by purchasing the printing press and 
taking on a loan with these same after-tax debt payments. How much could Emory borrow 
by taking on such a loan? Because the future incremental cash flows are the after-tax pay-
ments Emory will make on the loan, the initial balance on the lease-equivalent loan is the 
present value of these cash flows using Emory’s after-tax cost of debt:
	
Loan Balance = PV [Future FCF of Lease Versus Buy at rD(1 - tc )]
(25.4)
Using Emory’s after-tax borrowing cost of 8% (1 - 35%) = 5.2%, the initial loan balance is
	
Loan Balance = 11,625
1.052 + 11,625
1.0522 + 11,625
1.0523 + 11,625
1.0524 + 3500
1.0525 = $43,747
(25.5)
Eq. 25.5 implies that if Emory is willing to take on the future obligations implied by 
­leasing, it could instead buy the printing press and borrow $43,747. This exceeds the ­savings 
of $41,875 in year 0 from leasing shown in Table 25.2. Thus, by buying and borrowing 
using the lease-equivalent loan, Emory saves an additional $43,747 - 41,875 = $1872 
initially, and so leasing the machine is unattractive relative to this alternative.
13See S. Myers, D. Dill, and A. Bautista, “Valuation of Financial Lease Contracts,” Journal of Finance 
31(3) (1976): 799–819, for a development of this method.

Chapter 25  Leasing
We verify this result explicitly in the spreadsheet in Table 25.3. There, we compute the 
cash flows that result from buying the machine and borrowing using the lease-equivalent 
loan. Line 1 shows the lease-equivalent loan balance, which we compute at each date by 
applying Eq. 25.4. Line 2 shows the initial borrowing and principal payments of the loan 
(computed as the change in the loan balance from the prior year). Line 3 shows the interest 
due each year (8% of the prior loan balance), and line 4 computes the interest tax shield 
(35% of the interest amount). Line 5 then totals the after-tax cash flows of the loan, which 
we combine with the free cash flow from buying the printing press, to compute the total 
cash flow from buying and borrowing on line 7.
Comparing the cash flows from buying the printing press and financing it with the 
lease-equivalent loan (line 7 of Table 25.3) with the cash flows of the lease (e.g., line 1 
of Table  25.2), we see that in both cases Emory has a net future obligation of $8125 
per year for four years. But while the leverage is the same for the two strategies, the 
initial cash flow is not. With the lease, Emory will pay $8125 initially; with the loan, 
Emory will pay the purchase price of the printing press minus the amount borrowed, or 
$50,000 - $43,747 = $6253. Again, we see that borrowing to buy the machine is cheaper 
than the lease, with a savings of $8125 - $6253 = $1872. For Emory, the lease is not 
attractive. If Emory is willing to take on that much leverage, it would be better off doing so 
by borrowing to purchase the printing press, rather than leasing it.
A Direct Method.  Now that we have seen the role of the lease-equivalent loan, we can 
use the tools of Chapter 18 to directly compare leasing with an equivalent debt-financed 
purchase. Recall from Chapter 18 that when the cash flows of an investment will be off-
set completely with leverage, the appropriate weighted average cost of capital is given by 
rU - tc rD, where rU is the unlevered cost of capital for the investment (see Eq. 18.11 and 
the discussion on pages 688–690). Because the incremental cash flows from leasing versus 
borrowing are relatively safe, rU = rD and so rwacc = rD(1 - tc). Thus, we can compare leas-
ing to buying the asset using equivalent leverage by discounting the incremental cash flows of 
leasing versus buying using the after-tax borrowing rate.
In Emory’s case, discounting the incremental free cash flow in Table 25.2 at Emory’s 
after-tax borrowing cost of 8% * (1 - 35%) = 5.2%, we get
 PV(Lease Versus Borrow) = 41,875 - 11,625
1.052 - 11,625
1.0522 - 11,625
1.0523 - 11,625
1.0524 - 3500
1.0525
 = -$1872
Note that this is precisely the difference we calculated earlier.

25.3  The Leasing Decision	
937
The Effective After-Tax Lease Borrowing Rate.  We can also compare leasing and buying 
in terms of an effective after-tax borrowing rate associated with the lease. This is given by the 
IRR of the incremental lease cash flows in Table 25.2, which we can calculate as 7%:
41,875 - 11,625
1.07
- 11,625
1.072 - 11,625
1.073 - 11,625
1.074 - 3500
1.075 = 0
Thus, the lease is equivalent to borrowing at an after-tax rate of 7%. This option is not 
attractive compared to the after-tax rate of only 8% * (1 - 35%) = 5.2% that Emory pays 
on its debt. Because we are borrowing (positive followed by negative cash flows), a lower 
IRR is better. But be careful with this approach—as discussed in Chapter 7, if the cash 
flows alternate signs more than once, the IRR method cannot be relied upon.
Evaluating a True Tax Lease
In summary, when evaluating a true-tax lease, we should compare leasing to a purchase 
that is financed with equivalent leverage. We suggest the following approach:
	
1.	 Compute the incremental cash flows for leasing versus buying, as we did in 
Table 25.2. Include the depreciation tax shield (if buying) and the tax deductibility 
of the lease payments if leasing.
	
2.	 Compute the NPV of leasing versus buying using equivalent leverage by ­discounting 
the incremental cash flows at the after-tax borrowing rate.
If the NPV computed in Step 2 is negative, then leasing is unattractive compared to tra-
ditional debt financing. In this case, the firm should not lease, but rather should acquire 
the asset using an optimal amount of leverage (based on the trade-offs and techniques 
discussed in Parts 5 and 6).
If the NPV computed in Step 2 is positive, then leasing does provide an advantage over 
traditional debt financing and should be considered. Management should recognize, how-
ever, that while it may not be listed on the balance sheet, the lease increases the firm’s 
­effective leverage by the amount of the lease-equivalent loan.14
14If financial distress or other costs of leverage are large, the firm may wish to offset some of this increase 
in leverage by reducing other debt of the firm.

Chapter 25  Leasing
Problem
Suppose the lease in Example 25.6 is a non-tax lease. Would it be attractive for Emory in this case?
Solution
Instead of purchasing the machine for $50,000, Emory will pay lease payments of $11,800 per 
year. That is, Emory is effectively borrowing $50,000 by making payments of $11,800 per year. 
Given Emory’s 8% borrowing rate, payments of $11,800 per year on a standard loan would 
allow Emory to borrow
PV(Lease Payments) = 11,800 + 11,800
1.08
+ 11,800
1.082 + 11,800
1.083 + 11,800
1.084 = $50,883
That is, by making the same payments on a loan, Emory could raise more than $50,000. Thus, 
the lease is not attractive at these terms if it is a non-tax lease.
Evaluating a Non-Tax Lease
Evaluating a non-tax lease is much more straightforward than evaluating a true tax lease. 
For a non-tax lease, the lessee still receives the depreciation deductions (as though the asset 
were purchased). Only the interest portion of the lease payment is deductible, however. 
Thus, in terms of cash flows, a non-tax lease is directly comparable to a traditional loan. 
Therefore, it is attractive if it offers a better interest rate than would be available with a 
loan. To determine whether it does offer a better rate, we can discount the lease payments 
at the firm’s pretax borrowing rate and compare it to the purchase price of the asset.
Example 25.7
Comparing a Non-Tax Lease with a Standard Loan
Using Emory’s after-tax borrowing cost of 5.2%, the gain from leasing versus an equivalently 
leveraged purchase is
 NPV(Lease Versus Borrow) = 42,330 - 11,170
1.052 - 11,170
1.0522 - 11,170
1.0523 - 11,170
1.0524 - 3500
1.0525
 = 42,330 - 42,141
 = $189
Therefore, the lease is attractive at the new terms.
For both the true tax lease and the non-tax lease, we have ignored the residual value of 
the asset, any differences in the maintenance and service arrangements with a lease versus 
a purchase, and any cancellation or other lease options. If these features are present, they 
should also be included when comparing leasing versus a debt-financed purchase.
Concept Check	
1.	 Why is it inappropriate to compare leasing to buying?
	
2.	 What discount rate should be used for the incremental lease cash flows to ­compare a true tax 
lease to borrowing?
	
3.	 How can we compare a non-tax lease to borrowing?
	
25.4	 Reasons for Leasing
In Section 25.3, we saw how to determine whether a lease is attractive for the potential 
lessee. A similar, but reverse argument can be used from the standpoint of the lessor. The 
lessor could compare leasing the equipment to lending the money to the firm so that it can 

	
25.4  Reasons for Leasing	
939
purchase the equipment. Under what circumstances would leasing be profitable for both 
the lessor and the lessee? If a lease is a good deal for one of the parties, is it a bad deal for the 
other? Or are there underlying economic sources of value in a lease contract?
Valid Arguments for Leasing
For a lease to be attractive to both the lessee and the lessor, the gains must come from some 
underlying economic benefits that the leasing arrangement provides. Here, we consider 
some valid reasons for leasing.
Tax Differences.  With a true tax lease, the lessee replaces depreciation and interest tax 
deductions with a deduction for the lease payments. Depending on the timing of the pay-
ments, one set of deductions will have a larger present value. A tax gain occurs if the lease 
shifts the more valuable deductions to the party with the higher tax rate. Generally speak-
ing, if the asset’s tax depreciation deductions are more rapid than its lease payments, a true 
tax lease is advantageous if the lessor is in a higher tax bracket than the lessee.15 In contrast, 
if the asset’s tax depreciation deductions are slower than its lease payments, there are tax 
gains from a true tax lease if the lessor is in a lower tax bracket than the lessee.
15See J. Graham, M. Lemmon, and J. Schallheim, “Debt, Leases, Taxes, and the Endogeneity of ­Corporate 
Tax Status,” Journal of Finance 53(1) (1998): 131–162, for evidence that low tax rate firms tend to lease 
more than high tax rate firms.
Example 25.8
Exploiting Tax Differences Through Leasing
Problem
Suppose Emory is offered a true tax lease for the printing press at a lease rate of $11,800 per year. 
Show that this lease is profitable for Emory as well as for a lessor with a 15% tax rate and an 8% 
borrowing cost.
Solution
We already evaluated the lease with these terms in Example 25.6. There, we found that the NPV 
of leasing versus borrowing was $189 for Emory. Now let’s consider the lease from the 
standpoint of the lessor. The lessor will buy the printing press and then lease it to Emory. 
The incremental cash flows for the lessor from buying and leasing are as follows:
Evaluating the cash flows at the after-tax rate of 8% * (1 - 15%) = 6.8%, we find the 
NPV = $341 7 0 for the lessor. (Using the after-tax rate for the lessor implies that the lessor 
will borrow against the future free cash flows of the transaction.) Thus, both sides gain from 
the transaction due to the difference in tax rates. The gain comes from the fact that for Emory, 
the lease provides more accelerated tax deductions than the company would receive from depre-
ciating the printing press. Because Emory is in a higher tax bracket than the leasing company, 
­shifting the faster tax deductions to Emory is advantageous.

Chapter 25  Leasing
Reduced Resale Costs.  Many assets are time consuming and costly to sell. If a firm only 
needs to use the asset for a short time, it is probably less costly to lease it than to buy and 
resell the asset. In this case, the lessor is responsible for finding a new user for the asset, but 
lessors are often specialized to do so and so face much lower costs. For example, car dealer-
ships are in a better position to sell a used car at the end of a lease than a consumer is. Some 
of this advantage can be passed along through a lower lease rate. In addition, while owners 
of assets are likely to resell them only if the assets are “lemons,” a short-term lease can com-
mit the user of an asset to return it regardless of its quality. In this way, leases can help miti-
gate the adverse selection problem in the used goods market.16
Efficiency Gains from Specialization.  Lessors often have efficiency advantages over les-
sees in maintaining or operating certain types of assets. For example, a lessor of office copy 
machines can employ expert technicians and maintain an inventory of spare parts required 
for maintenance. Some types of leases may even come with an operator, such as a truck 
with a driver (in fact, the term “operating lease” originated from such leases). By offering 
assets together with these complementary services, lessors can achieve efficiency gains and 
offer attractive lease rates. In addition, if the value of the asset depends upon these addi-
tional services, then a firm that purchases the asset would be dependent on the service 
provider, who could then raise the price for services and exploit the firm.17 By leasing the 
asset and the services as a bundle, the firm maintains its bargaining power by ­retaining its 
flexibility to switch to competing equipment.
Reduced Distress Costs and Increased Debt Capacity.  As noted in Section 25.2, assets 
leased under a true lease are not afforded bankruptcy protection and can be seized in the 
event of default. As a result, lease obligations effectively have higher priority and lower risk 
than even secured debt. In addition, the lessor may be better able to recover the full eco-
nomic value of the asset (by releasing it) than a lender would. Because of the reduced risk 
and higher recovery value in the event of default, a lessor may be able to offer more attrac-
tive financing through the lease than an ordinary lender could. Studies suggest that this 
effect is important for small firms and firms that are capital constrained.18
Mitigating Debt Overhang.  Leasing may have an additional benefit to firms that suffer 
from debt overhang. Recall that with debt overhang, a firm may fail to make positive NPV 
investments because the existing debt holders will capture much of the value of any new 
assets. Because of its effective seniority, a lease may allow the firm to finance its expansion 
while effectively segregating the claim on the new assets, and thus overcome the debt over-
hang problem.19
For example, suppose clothing designer Andreano Ltd. has an opportunity that requires 
use of a new $1.1 million robotic sewing machine. The machine does not depreciate and 
so can be sold for $1.1 million at the end of the year, and the project will generate an

Journal of Political Economy 112(5) (2004): 1157–1180.
17This concern is often referred to as the hold-up problem. The importance of the hold-up problem in 
determining the optimal ownership of assets was identified by B. Klein, R. Crawford, and A. Alchian, 
“Vertical Integration, Appropriable Rents, and the Competitive Contracting Process,” Journal of Law and 
Economics 21 (1978): 297–326.

25.4  Reasons for Leasing

QUESTION: How is XOJET financed?
ANSWER: XOJET, one of the largest 
private aviation companies in North 
America, owns and operates the larg-
est chartered fleet of super midsize 
jets and also leases jets to supple-
ment its fleet. XOJET is financed by 
equity, secured and unsecured debt, 
and operating leases. As a private 
company in a capital-intensive busi-
ness, XOJET maximizes use of debt 
financing secured by aircraft primar-
ily funded through an established 
credit facility. Using aircraft as security reduces lender risk 
and therefore expands our access to debt capital markets and 
minimizes our cost of financing.
QUESTION: How do you make the decision whether to 
expand your fleet? How do you compare buying versus leasing 
airplanes?
ANSWER: XOJET’s fleet expansion criteria include such 
factors as:
n	 Positive contribution to maintain a 15% or higher ROIC 
(return on invested capital).
n	 Sufficient and sustainable customer demand generated 
through our retail channel.
n	 Availability of suitable lease or debt financing.
n	 Evaluation of the business environment: economic cycle 
stage, competitive environment, and growth outlook.
n	 Availability of suitably priced used aircraft for sale or lease 
that comport to our business model at the right capital cost.
Because paying all cash (“buying”) an aircraft is typically 
not an optimal use of our cash resources, the decision 
focuses on the type of financing available and the terms, as 
well as lease accounting treatment. Operating leases are off-
balance sheet, whereas capital leases (essentially full-payout 
loans like a mortgage) are carried on the balance sheet. 
Thus it’s also important to consider XOJET’s ability to add 
more balance-sheet debt.
We first assess the market availability 
for lease financing and any potential 
asset utilization penalties for excess 
use. Then we consider current and 
future residual values for a particular 
aircraft, secondary market conditions, 
the cash deposits required for the lease, 
and the potential extra cost of accept-
able return condition obligations 
(beyond normal wear). In addition, 
some individuals and small businesses 
have tax incentives to purchase an 
aircraft and then lease it to an operator 
like XOJET. These special situations 
may offer preferred lease terms to 
XOJET that may not otherwise be 
available in traditional debt markets, 
making leasing an attractive option.
QUESTION: What are some of the 
advantages/disadvantages associated 
with leasing?
ANSWER: The leasing arena offers 
a broader marketplace of investors, expanding our financ-
ing avenues. Another benefit is the transfer of the residual 
value risk to the lessor. An operating (off-balance sheet) lease 
reported in a financial footnote helps us manage compliance 
with leverage and coverage ratio covenants. Leases also allow 
us to structure both the lease term to best match the cash flow 
production over an asset’s planned life of the asset and the 
most tax efficient use of the asset.
A major disadvantage of an operating lease, which is 
expensed, is its negative impact on EBITDA, a common 
profitability measure. (The interest expense associated 
with loans does not impact EBITDA.) Leases are also 
non-­cancellable and incur large early-termination penal-
ties, which means less flexibility for XOJET to respond to 
changing market conditions.
QUESTION: Do you view leasing as another form of financing 
that is similar to debt, and why? 
ANSWER:  XOJET views each form of financing type as 
similar, although each has its advantages and disadvantages 
as mentioned previously. In some cases lease financing may 
be the best option, depending on the situational facts and 
seller motivation. Leasing is typically—but not always—a 
more expensive source of financing because the lessor wants 
to earn a premium over its cost of funds, mitigate potential 
credit risk through significant cash deposits, and be com-
pensated for potential future residual value risk. 
Mark Long, XOJET’s Executive Vice 
President and Chief Financial Officer 
since 2009, has more than 25 years’ 
aviation finance experience. He is 
responsible for maximizing XOJET’s 
operating performance, achieving finan-
cial goals, and managing financial risks, 
as well as aircraft fleet planning and 
asset management at the company.

Chapter 25  Leasing
additional $550,000 with certainty, for a total payoff of $1.65 million. If the risk-free rate 
is 10%, then this opportunity has NPV of $1.65 million/1.10 - 1.1 million = $400,000.
But suppose there is a 40% probability that Andreano will be in bankruptcy next year 
and its equity will be wiped out. In that case, the present value of the project’s payoff to 
equity holders is only 60% * $1.65 million/1.10 = $900,000, and it will not be willing to 
invest the $1.1 million needed to purchase the machine upfront.20
On the other hand, suppose Andreano can lease the machine for the year. From Eq. 
25.1, the competitive one-year lease rate is $1.1 million - 1.1 million/1.10 = $100,000. 
Equity holders would be willing to contribute this amount, as the present value of the 
equity holders’ payoff from the new project is 60% * $550,000/1.10 = $300,000. Leasing 
solves the debt overhang by allowing Andreano to use the machine without giving existing 
debt holders a claim to it in the event of default.21
Transferring Risk.  At the beginning of a lease, there may be significant uncertainty about 
the residual value of the leased asset, and whoever owns the asset bears this risk. Leasing 
allows the party best able to bear the risk to hold it. For example, small firms with a low 
tolerance for risk may prefer to lease rather than purchase assets.
Improved Incentives.  When the lessor is the manufacturer, a lease in which the lessor 
bears the risk of the residual value can improve incentives and lower agency costs. Such 
a lease provides the manufacturer with an incentive to produce a high-quality, durable 
product that will retain its value over time. In addition, if the manufacturer is a monopo-
list, leasing the product gives the manufacturer an incentive not to overproduce and lower 
the product’s residual value, as well as an ability to restrict competition from sales of used 
goods.
Despite these potential benefits, significant agency costs may also be associated with 
leasing. For leases in which the lessor retains a substantial interest in the asset’s residual 
value, the lessee has less of an incentive to take proper care of an asset that is leased rather 
than purchased.22
Suspect Arguments for Leasing
Some reasons that lessees and lessors cite for preferring leasing to purchasing are difficult 
to justify economically. While they may be important in some circumstances, they deserve 
careful scrutiny.
Avoiding Capital Expenditure Controls.  One reason some managers will choose to 
lease equipment rather than purchase it is to avoid the scrutiny from superiors that often 
accompanies large capital expenditures. For example, some companies may place limits 
on the dollar amounts a manager can invest over a certain period; lease payments may fall 
below these limits, whereas the cost of the purchase would not. By leasing, the manager 
20For simplicity, we have assumed in this example that all risk is idiosyncratic so that we can discount at 
the risk-free rate. More generally, the same results hold even if the risk is not idiosyncratic as long as we 
interpret the probabilities as risk-neutral probabilities, as discussed in Chapter 21.
21While secured debt might also be beneficial in this example, there is some risk that secured debt holders 
might not be able to repossess the assets in a timely fashion in the event of bankruptcy, and thus would 
not receive its full liquidation value.
22As an example, auto manufacturers require individuals who lease their cars to provide proper mainte-
nance. Without such requirements, individuals would be tempted to avoid paying for oil changes and 
other maintenance near the end of the lease term. Of course, there are other ways lessees may abuse their 
cars (driving at excessive speeds, for example) that cannot be easily controlled.

	
25.4  Reasons for Leasing

avoids having to make a special request for funds. This reason for leasing is also apparent in 
the public sector, where large assets are often leased to avoid asking the government or the 
public to approve the funds necessary to purchase the assets. However, the lease may cost 
more than the purchase, wasting stockholder or taxpayer dollars in the long run.
Preserving Capital.  A common argument made in favor of leasing is that it provides 
“100% financing” because no down payment is required, so the lessee can save cash to use 
for other needs. Of course, in a perfect market financing is irrelevant, so for leases to have 
a financing advantage, some friction must exist. Possible imperfections include the distress 
costs, debt overhang, and tax differentials discussed above. But it is important to appreciate 
that the advantage of a lease derives from its differential treatment for tax purposes and in 
bankruptcy, not because leases provide 100% financing. For firms that are not subject to 
these frictions, the amount of leverage the firm can obtain through a lease is unlikely to 
exceed the amount of leverage the firm can obtain through a loan.
Reducing Leverage Through Off-Balance-Sheet Financing.  By carefully avoiding the 
four criteria that define a capital lease for accounting purposes, a firm can avoid listing the 
long-term lease as a liability. Because a lease is equivalent to a loan, the firm can increase 
its actual leverage without increasing the debt-to-equity ratio on its balance sheet. But 
whether they appear on the balance sheet or not, lease commitments are liabilities for the 
firm. As a result, they will have the same effect on the risk and return characteristics of 
the firm as other forms of leverage do. Most financial analysts and sophisticated investors 
understand this fact and consider operating leases (which must be listed in the footnotes of 
the financial statements) to be additional sources of leverage.
Concept Check	
1.	 What are some of the potential gains from leasing if the lessee plans to hold the asset for only a 
small fraction of its useful life?
	
2.	 If a lease is not listed as a liability on the firm’s balance sheet, does it mean that a firm that leases 
rather than borrows is less risky?
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
25.1  The Basics of Leasing
	
n	 A lease is a contract between two parties: the lessee and the lessor. The lessee is liable for ­periodic 
payments in exchange for the right to use the asset. The lessor, who is the owner of the asset, is 
entitled to the lease payments in exchange for lending the asset.
	
n	 Many types of lease transactions are possible depending on the relationship between the lessee 
and the lessor.
n	 In a sales-type lease, the lessor is the manufacturer or primary dealer of the asset.
n	 In a direct lease, the lessor is an independent company that specializes in purchasing assets 
and leasing them to customers.
n	 If a firm already owns an asset it would prefer to lease, it can arrange a sale and leaseback 
transaction.
	
n	 In a perfect market, the cost of leasing is equivalent to the cost of purchasing and reselling 
the asset. Also, the cost of leasing and then purchasing the asset is equivalent to the cost of 
­borrowing to purchase the asset.

944	
Chapter 25  Leasing
	
n	 In many cases, the lease provides options for the lessee to obtain ownership of the asset at the 
end of the lease. Some examples include fair market value leases, $1.00 out leases, and fixed 
price or fair market value cap leases.
25.2  Accounting, Tax, and Legal Consequences of Leasing
	
n	 The FASB recognizes two types of leases based on the lease terms: operating leases and capital 
leases. Operating leases do not appear on the balance sheet, and lease payments are deducted as a 
rental expense. Capital leases are treated as a purchase and a loan, with interest and depreciation 
expenses. Beginning in 2019, firms will also list operating lease obligations on the balance sheet.
	
n	 The IRS separates leases into two broad categories: true tax leases and non-tax leases. With 
a true tax lease, the lessee deducts lease payments as an operating expense. A non-tax lease is 
treated as a loan for tax purposes, so the lessee must depreciate the asset and can expense only 
the interest portion of the lease payments.
	
n	 In a true lease, the asset is not protected in the event that the lessee declares bankruptcy, and the 
lessor can seize the asset if lease payments are not made. If the lease is deemed a security interest 
by the bankruptcy court, then the asset is protected and the lessor becomes a secured creditor.
25.3  The Leasing Decision
	
n	 To evaluate the leasing decision for a true tax lease, managers should compare the cost of leasing 
with the cost of financing using an equivalent amount of leverage.
n	 Compute the incremental cash flows for leasing versus buying.
n	 Compute the NPV by discounting the incremental cash flows at the after-tax borrowing 
rate.
	
n	 The cash flows of a non-tax lease are directly comparable to the cash flows of a traditional loan, 
so a non-tax lease is attractive only if it offers a better interest rate than a loan.
25.4  Reasons for Leasing
	
n	 Good reasons for leasing include tax differences, reduced resale costs, efficiency gains from 
specialization, reduced bankruptcy costs, mitigating debt overhang, risk transfer, and improved 
incentives.
	
n	 Suspect reasons for leasing include avoiding capital expenditure controls, preserving capital, 
and reducing leverage through off-balance-sheet financing.

6.	 Craxton Engineering will either purchase or lease a new $752,000 fabricator. If purchased, the 
fabricator will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over seven years. Craxton can lease the fab-
ricator for $131,000 per year for seven years. Craxton’s tax rate is 35%. (Assume the fabricator

will be worthless. If leased, the annual lease payments will be $66,152 per year for five years. 
Assume Riverton’s borrowing cost is 7%, its tax rate is 35%, and the lease qualifies as a true tax 
lease.
a.	 If Riverton purchases the equipment, what is the amount of the lease-equivalent loan?

actual after-tax borrowing rate?
	
8.	 Suppose Clorox can lease a new computer data processing system for $972,000 per year for

borrowing cost of 6.6% and a tax rate of 35%, and the system will be obsolete at the end of 
five years.
a.	 If Clorox will depreciate the computer equipment on a straight-line basis over the next five 
years, and if the lease qualifies as a true tax lease, is it better to lease or finance the purchase 
of the equipment?
b.	Suppose that if Clorox buys the equipment, it will use accelerated depreciation for tax 
purposes. Specifically, suppose it can expense 20% of the purchase price immediately 
and can take depreciation deductions equal to 32%, 19.2%, 11.52%, 11.52%, and 
5.76% of the purchase price over the next five years. Compare leasing with purchase in 
this case.
	
*9.	 Suppose Procter and Gamble (P&G) is considering purchasing $19 million in new manufac-
turing equipment. If it purchases the equipment, it will depreciate it on a straight-line basis 
over the five years, after which the equipment will be worthless. It will also be responsible 
for maintenance expenses of $2 million per year. Alternatively, it can lease the equipment for 
$4.3 million per year for the five years, in which case the lessor will provide necessary mainte-
nance. Assume P&G’s tax rate is 40% and its borrowing cost is 7.5%.

*10.	 Suppose Amazon is considering the purchase of computer servers and network infrastructure 
to expand its very successful business offering cloud-based computing. In total, it will purchase 
$48 million in new equipment. This equipment will qualify for accelerated depreciation: 20% 
can be expensed immediately, followed by 32%, 19.2%, 11.52%, 11.52%, and 5.76% over the 
next five years. However, because of the firm’s substantial loss carryforwards and other credits, 
Amazon estimates its marginal tax rate to be 10% over the next five years, so it will get very little 
tax benefit from the depreciation expenses. Thus, Amazon considers leasing the equipment 
instead. Suppose Amazon and the lessor face the same 8% borrowing rate, but the lessor has 
a 35% tax rate. For the purpose of this question, assume the equipment is worthless after five 
years, the lease term is five years, and the lease qualifies as a true tax lease.
a.	 What is the lease rate for which the lessor will break even?
b.	 What is the gain to Amazon with this lease rate?
c.	 What is the source of the gain in this transaction?
	
11.	 Western Airlines is considering a new route that will require adding an additional Boeing 777 
to its fleet. Western can purchase the airplane for $221.7 million or lease it for $25 million per 
year. If it purchases the airplane, its seating can be optimized, and the new route is expected to 
generate profits of $49.5 million per year. If leased, the route will only generate profits of $34.8 
million per year. Suppose the appropriate cost of capital is 12.9% and that, if purchased, the 
plane can be sold at any time for an expected resale price of $221.7 million. Ignore taxes.
a.	 As a one-year decision, does purchasing or leasing the plane have higher NPV?
b.	 Suppose the funds to purchase or lease the plane will come from equity holders (for example, 
by reducing the amount of Western’s current dividend). Western also has one-year debt out-
standing, and there is a 9.1% (risk-neutral23) probability that over the next year Western will 
declare bankruptcy and its equity holders will be wiped out. Otherwise, the debt will be 
rolled over at the end of the year. Is purchasing or leasing the plane more attractive to equity 
holders?
c.	 At what (risk-neutral) probability of default would equity holders’ preference for leasing 
versus purchasing the plane change?
23Chapter 21 explains risk-neutral probabilities. If you have not read that chapter, you can work the 
­problem and get the same answers by assuming that the specified probabilities are the actual probabilities 
of default but the risk of default is purely idiosyncratic risk.

Short-Term 
Financial Planning
THE LAW Of OnE PRicE cOnnEcTiOn. Most of the financial decisions 
we have studied so far have been long term, that is, decisions involving cash flows that 
occur over a period of time longer than one year. In Part 9, we turn to the details of run-
ning the financial side of a corporation and focus on short-term financial management. 
In a perfect capital market, the Law of One Price and the Modigliani-Miller propositions 
imply that the way a firm chooses to manage its short-term financial needs does not 
affect the value of the firm. In reality, short-term financial policy does matter because 
of the existence of market frictions. In this part of the book, we identify these fric-
tions and explain how firms set their short-term financial policies. In Chapter 26, we 
discuss how firms manage their working capital requirements, including accounts receiv-
able, accounts payable, and inventory. In Chapter 27, we explain how firms finance their 
short-term cash needs.

IN CHAPTER  2, WE DEFINED A firm’s NET WORKING CAPITAL 
as its current assets minus its current liabilities. Net working capital is the capital 
required in the short term to run the business. Thus, working capital management 
involves short-term asset accounts such as cash, inventory, and accounts receivable, as 
well as short-term liability accounts such as accounts payable.
The level of investment in each of these accounts differs from firm to firm and from 
industry to industry. It also depends on factors such as the type of business and indus-
try standards. Some firms, for example, require heavy inventory investments because 
of the nature of their business. ­Consider The Kroger Company, a retail grocery chain, 
and Carnival Corporation, a cruise ship operator. Inventory amounted to nearly 20% 
of Kroger’s total assets at the start of 2015, whereas Carnival’s investment in inven-
tory was less than 1%. A grocery store requires a large investment in inventory, while 
a cruise line’s profitability is generated primarily from its investment in plant, property, 
and equipment—that is, its 100 cruise ships.
There are opportunity costs associated with investing in inventories and accounts 
receivable, and from holding cash. Excess funds invested in these accounts could instead 
be used to pay down debt or returned to shareholders in the form of a dividend or 
share repurchase. This chapter focuses on the tools firms use to manage their working 
capital efficiently and thereby minimize these opportunity costs. We begin by discussing 
why firms have working capital and how it affects firm value. In a perfectly competitive 
market, many of the working capital accounts would be irrelevant. Not surprisingly, the 
existence of these accounts for real firms can be traced to market frictions. We discuss 
the costs and benefits of trade credit and evaluate the trade-offs firms make in manag-
ing various working capital accounts. Finally, we discuss the cash balance of a firm and 
provide an overview of the short-term investments in which a firm may choose to invest 
its cash.

26.1	 Overview of Working Capital
Most projects require the firm to invest in net working capital. The main components of 
net working capital are cash, inventory, receivables, and payables. Working capital includes 
the cash that is needed to run the firm on a day-to-day basis. It does not include excess 
cash, which is cash that is not required to run the business and can be invested at a market 
rate. As we discussed in Chapter 14, excess cash may be viewed as part of the firm’s capital 
structure, offsetting firm debt. In Chapter 8, we discussed how any increases in net working 
capital represent an investment that reduces the cash that is available to the firm. There-
fore, working capital alters a firm’s value by affecting its free cash flow. In this section, we 
examine the components of net working capital and their effects on the firm’s value.
The Cash Cycle
The level of working capital reflects the length of time between when cash goes out of 
a firm at the beginning of the production process and when it comes back in. A com-
pany first buys inventory from its suppliers, in the form of either raw materials or finished 
goods. A firm typically buys its inventory on credit, which means that the firm does not 
have to pay cash immediately at the time of purchase. After receiving the inventory, even if 
the inventory is in the form of finished goods, it may sit on the shelf for some time. Finally, 
when the inventory is ultimately sold, the firm may extend credit to its customers, delaying 
when it will receive the cash. A firm’s cash cycle is the length of time between when the 
firm pays cash to purchase its initial inventory and when it receives cash from the sale of 
the output produced from that inventory. Figure 26.1 illustrates the cash cycle.
Some practitioners measure the cash cycle by calculating the cash conversion cycle. The 
cash conversion cycle (CCC) is defined as
	
CCC = Accounts Receivable Days + Inventory Days - Accounts Payable Days   (26.1)
where

and when it receives cash 
from the sale of its product.

Chapter 26  Working Capital Management
The firm’s operating cycle is the average length of time between when a firm originally 
purchases its inventory and when it receives the cash back from selling its product. If the 
firm pays cash for its inventory, this period is identical to the firm’s cash cycle. However, 
most firms buy their inventory on credit, which reduces the amount of time between the 
cash investment and the receipt of cash from that investment.
The longer a firm’s cash cycle, the more working capital it has, and the more cash it 
needs to carry to conduct its daily operations. Table 26.1 provides data on the working 
capital needs for selected firms in a variety of industries.
Because of the characteristics of different industries, working capital levels vary signifi-
cantly. For example, grocery stores (Kroger) and fast-food restaurants (Chipotle Mexican 
Grill) typically sell on a cash-only basis, and thus have very short accounts receivable days.1 
Similar results hold for Southwest Airlines, because many of its customers pay in advance 
for airline tickets with cash or credit cards. Inventory represents the largest percentage of 
1When you use your Visa or MasterCard to pay for your groceries, it is a cash sale for the store. The credit 
card company pays the store cash upon receipt of the credit slip, even if you do not pay your credit card 
bill on time.

sales for firms such as Tiffany, Brown-Forman, and Lennar, whose products have long pro-
duction and sales cycles, whereas Chipotle and The New York Times hold minimal inven-
tory. Note also the wide variation in the firms’ cash conversion cycles; Amazon.com and 
Southwest’s cash conversion cycle is negative, reflecting the fact that they receive cash from 
their customers before having to pay suppliers, whereas firms such as Tiffany must spend 
cash to produce their products more than one year before they receive revenues from them.
Firm Value and Working Capital
Any reduction in working capital requirements generates a positive free cash flow that the 
firm can distribute immediately to shareholders. For example, if a firm is able to reduce 
its required net working capital by $50,000 permanently, it will be able to distribute this 
$50,000 as a dividend to its shareholders immediately and thus increase firm value by the 
same amount. Similarly, when evaluating a project, reducing the project’s net working capi-
tal needs over the project’s life reduces the opportunity cost associated with this use of capital.
Managing working capital efficiently will maximize firm value. We now turn our 
­attention to some specific working capital accounts.
Concept Check	
1.	 What is the firm’s cash cycle? How does it differ from the operating cycle?
	
2.	 How does working capital impact a firm’s value?
Example 26.1
Problem
Emerald City Paints would like to construct a new facility that will manufacture paint. In addi-
tion to the capital expenditure on the plant, management estimates that the project will require 
an investment today of $450,000 for net working capital. The firm will recover the investment 
in net working capital eight years from today, when management anticipates closing the plant. 
The discount rate for this type of cash flow is 6% per year. What is the present value of the cost 
of working capital for the paint facility? What is the value of an inventory policy that would 
halve the plant’s net working capital requirements?
Solution
The cash flows for the investment in net working capital are -$450,000 today and +$450,000 
eight years from today. Putting this on a timeline:
Given a discount rate of 6% per year, the NPV of these cash flows is
NPV = -$450,000 + $450,000
(1 + 0.06)8 = -$167,664
Although Emerald City Paints receives back all of its investment in working capital, it loses the 
time value of money on this cash. If a new inventory policy could halve this requirement, it 
would be worth $167,664/2 = $83,832 to the firm.

26.2	 Trade Credit
When a firm allows a customer to pay for goods at some date later than the date of ­purchase, 
it creates an account receivable for the firm and an account payable for the ­customer. 
Accounts receivable represent the credit sales for which a firm has yet to receive payment. 
The accounts payable balance represents the amount that a firm owes its ­suppliers for 
goods that it has received but for which it has not yet paid. The credit that the firm is 
extending to its customer is known as trade credit. A firm would, of course, prefer to 
be paid in cash at the time of purchase, but a “cash-only” policy may cause it to lose its 
customers to competition. In this section, we demonstrate how managers can compare the 
costs and benefits of trade credit to determine optimal credit policies.
Trade Credit Terms
To see how the terms of trade credit are quoted, let’s consider some examples. If a supplier 
offers its customers terms of “Net 30,” payment is not due until 30 days from the date of 
the invoice. Essentially, the supplier is letting the customer use its money for an extra 30 
days. (Note that “30” is not a magic number; the invoice could specify “Net 40,” “Net 15,” 
or any other number of days as the payment due date.)
Sometimes the selling firm will offer the buying firm a discount if payment is made 
early. The terms “2/10, Net 30” mean that the buying firm will receive a 2% discount if it 
pays for the goods within 10 days; otherwise, the full amount is due in 30 days. Firms offer 
discounts to encourage customers to pay early so that the selling firm gets cash from the 
sale sooner. However, the amount of the discount also represents a cost to the selling firm 
because it does not receive the full selling price for the product.
Trade Credit and Market Frictions
In a perfectly competitive market, trade credit is just another form of financing. Under the 
Modigliani-Miller assumptions of perfect capital markets, the amounts of payables and 
receivables are therefore irrelevant. In reality, product markets are rarely perfectly competi-
tive, so firms can maximize their value by using their trade credit options effectively.
Cost of Trade Credit.  Trade credit is, in essence, a loan from the selling firm to its cus-
tomer. The price discount represents an interest rate. Often, firms offer favorable interest 
rates on trade credit as a price discount to their customers. Therefore, financial managers 
should evaluate the terms of trade credit to decide whether to use it.
How do we compute the interest rate on trade credit? Suppose a firm sells a product 
for $100 but offers its customer terms of 2/10, Net 30. The customer doesn’t have to pay 
anything for the first 10 days, so it effectively has a zero-interest loan for this period. If the 
customer takes advantage of the discount and pays within the 10-day discount period, the 
customer pays only $98 for the product. The cost of the discount to the selling firm is equal 
to the discount percentage times the selling price. In this case, it is 0.02 * $100, or $2.
Rather than pay within 10 days, the customer has the option to use the $98 for an addi-
tional 20 days (30 - 10 = 20). The interest rate for the 20-day term of the loan is 
$2/$98 = 2.04%. With a 365-day year, this rate over 20 days corresponds to an effective 
annual rate of 2
EAR = (1.0204)365/20 - 1 = 44.6%
2See Eq. 5.1 in Chapter 5.

	
26.2  Trade Credit	
955
Thus, by not taking the discount, the firm is effectively paying 2.04% to borrow the 
money for 20 days, which translates to an effective annual rate of 44.6%! If the firm can 
obtain a bank loan at a lower interest rate, it would be better off borrowing at the lower 
rate and using the cash proceeds of the loan to take advantage of the discount offered by 
the supplier.
Example 26.2
Estimating the Effective Cost of Trade Credit
Problem
Your firm purchases goods from its supplier on terms of 1/15, Net 40. What is the effective 
annual cost to your firm if it chooses not to take advantage of the trade discount offered?
Solution
Because the discount is 1%, for a $100 purchase your firm must pay either $99 in 15 days or 
$100 in 40 days. Given the difference of 25 days (40 - 15), these terms correspond to an effec-
tive annual rate of (100/99)365/25 - 1 = 15.8%.
Benefits of Trade Credit.  For a number of reasons, trade credit can be an attractive 
source of funds. First, trade credit is simple and convenient to use, and it therefore has 
lower transaction costs than alternative sources of funds. For example, no paperwork must 
be completed, as would be the case for a loan from a bank. Second, it is a flexible source 
of funds, and can be used as needed. Finally, it is sometimes the only source of funding 
available to a firm.
Trade Credit Versus Standard Loans.  You might wonder why companies would ever 
provide trade credit. After all, most companies are not banks, so why are they in the busi-
ness of making loans? Several reasons explain their willingness to offer trade credit.3 First, 
providing financing at below-market rates is an indirect way to lower prices for only certain 
customers. Consider, for example, an automobile manufacturer. Rather than lower prices 
on all cars, the financing division may offer specific credit terms that are attractive to cus-
tomers with bad credit, but unattractive to customers with good credit. In this way, the car 
manufacturer is able to discount the price only for those customers with bad credit who 
otherwise might not be able to afford the car.
Second, because a supplier may have an ongoing business relationship with its customer, 
it may have more information about the credit quality of the customer than a traditional 
outside lender such as a bank. The supplier may also be able to increase the likelihood of 
payment by threatening to cut off future supplies if payment is not made. Finally, if the 
buyer defaults, the supplier may be able to seize the inventory as collateral. This inventory 
is likely to be more valuable to a company within the industry such as the supplier (which 
presumably has other customers) than to an outsider.
Managing Float
One factor that contributes to the length of a firm’s receivables and payables is the delay 
between the time a bill is paid and the cash is actually received. This delay, or processing 
float, will impact a firm’s working capital requirements.
3For a detailed discussion of these issues, see B. Biais and C. Gollier, “Trade Credit and Credit Rationing,” 
Review of Financial Studies 10 (1997): 903–937; and M. Petersen and R. Rajan, “Trade Credit: Theories 
and Evidence,” Review of Financial Studies 10 (1997): 661–691.

Chapter 26  Working Capital Management
Collection Float.  Collection float is the amount of time it takes for a firm to be able to 
use funds after a customer has paid for its goods. Firms can reduce their working capital 
needs by reducing their collection float. Collection float is determined by three factors:
n	 Mail float: How long it takes the firm to receive the check after the customer has 
mailed it
n	 Processing float: How long it takes the firm to process the check and deposit it in the bank
n	 Availability float: How long it takes before the bank gives the firm credit for the funds
Disbursement Float.  Disbursement float is the amount of time it takes before pay-
ments to suppliers actually result in a cash outflow for the firm. Like collection float, it is 
a function of mail time, processing time, and check-clearing time. Although a firm may 
try to extend its disbursement float in order to lengthen its payables and reduce its work-
ing capital needs, it risks making late payments to suppliers. In such a case, the firm may 
be charged an additional fee for paying late or may be required to pay cash before delivery 
(CBD) or on delivery (COD) for future purchases. In some cases, the supplier may refuse 
to do business in the future with the delinquent firm.
Electronic Check Processing.  Firms can employ several methods to reduce their collection 
and disbursement floats. The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21), which 
became effective on October 28, 2004, eliminated the disbursement float due to the check-
clearing process. Under the Act, banks can process check information electronically, and the 
funds are deducted from a firm’s checking account on the same day that the firm’s supplier 
deposits the check in its bank in most cases. Unfortunately, even though under Check 21 the 
funds are taken out of the check writer’s account almost immediately, the check recipient’s 
account is not credited as quickly. As a result, the act does not serve to reduce collection float.
There are, however, several ways that a firm can reduce its collection float. For example, 
the firm may streamline its in-house check-processing procedures. In addition, with elec-
tronic collection, funds are automatically transferred from the customer’s bank account to 
the firm’s bank account on the payment date, reducing the collection float to zero. The 
methods a firm employs to reduce its collection float are not without costs, of course. 
Therefore, to decide which, if any, to employ, the firm must compare the costs and benefits 
of systems that allow it to use its cash for a longer period.

26.3	 Receivables Management
So far, we have discussed the costs and benefits of trade credit in general. Next, we look at 
some issues that arise specifically from the management of a firm’s accounts receivable. In 
particular, we focus on how a firm adopts a policy for offering credit to its customers and 
how it monitors its accounts receivable on an ongoing basis.
Determining the Credit Policy
Establishing a credit policy involves three steps that we will discuss in turn:
	
1.	 Establishing credit standards
	
2.	 Establishing credit terms
	
3.	 Establishing a collection policy

	
26.3  Receivables Management	
957
Establishing Credit Standards.  Management must first decide on its credit stan-
dards. Will it extend credit to anyone who applies for it? Or will it be selective and 
extend credit only to those customers who have very low credit risk? Unless the firm 
adopts the former policy, it will need to assess the credit risk of each customer before 
deciding whether to grant credit. Large firms often perform this analysis in-house with 
their own credit departments. Many small firms purchase credit reports from credit 
rating agencies such as Dun & Bradstreet.
The decision of how much credit risk to assume plays a large role in determining how 
much money a firm ties up in its receivables. While a restrictive policy can result in a lower 
sales volume, the firm will have a smaller investment in receivables. Conversely, a less selec-
tive policy will produce higher sales, but the level of receivables will also rise.
Establishing Credit Terms.  After a firm decides on its credit standards, it must next 
establish its credit terms. The firm decides on the length of the period before payment 
must be made (the “net” period) and chooses whether to offer a discount to encourage 
early payments. If it offers a discount, it must also determine the discount percentage and 
the discount period. If the firm is relatively small, it will probably follow the lead of other 
firms in the industry in establishing these terms.
Establishing a Collection Policy.  The last step in the development of a credit policy is to 
decide on a collection policy. The content of this policy can range from doing nothing if a 
customer is paying late (generally not a good choice), to sending a polite letter of inquiry, 
to charging interest on payments extending beyond a specified period, to threatening legal 
action at the first late payment.
Monitoring Accounts Receivable
After establishing a credit policy, a firm must monitor its accounts receivable to analyze 
whether its credit policy is working effectively. Two tools that firms use to monitor the 
accounts receivable are the accounts receivable days (or average collection period) and the 
aging schedule.
Accounts Receivable Days.  The accounts receivable days is the average number of days 
that it takes a firm to collect on its sales. A firm can compare this number to the payment 
policy specified in its credit terms to judge the effectiveness of its credit policy. If the credit 
terms specify “Net 30” and the accounts receivable days outstanding is 50 days, the firm 
can conclude that its customers are paying 20 days late, on average.
The firm should also look at the trend in the accounts receivable days over time. If the 
accounts receivable days ratio of a firm has been approximately 35 days for the past few 
years and it is 43 days this year, the firm may want to reexamine its credit policy. Of course, 
if the economy is sluggish, the entire industry may be affected. Under these circumstances, 
the increase might have little to do with the firm itself.
Because accounts receivable days can be calculated from the firm’s financial statements, 
outside investors commonly use this measure to evaluate a firm’s credit management policy. 
A major weakness of the accounts receivable days is that it is merely one number and con-
ceals much useful information. Seasonal sales patterns may cause the number calculated 
for the accounts receivable days to change, depending on when the calculation takes place. 
The number can also look reasonable even when a substantial percentage of the firm’s cus-
tomers are paying late.

958	
Chapter 26  Working Capital Management
Aging Schedule.  An aging schedule categorizes accounts by the number of days they 
have been on the firm’s books. It can be prepared using either the number of accounts or 
the dollar amount of the accounts receivable outstanding. For example, assume that a firm 
selling on terms of 2/15, Net 30, has $530,000 in accounts receivable that has been on the 
books for 15 or fewer days in 220 accounts. Another $450,000 has been on the books for 
16 to 30 days and is made up of 190 accounts, and $350,000 has been on the books for 31 
to 45 days and represents 80 accounts. The firm has $200,000 that has been on the books 
for 46 to 60 days in 60 accounts. Yet another $70,000 has been on the books for more than 
60 days and is made up of 20 accounts. Table 26.2 includes aging schedules based on the 
number of accounts and dollar amounts outstanding.
In this case, if the firm’s average daily sales is $65,000, its accounts receivable days is 
$1,600,000/$65,000 = 25 days. But on closer examination, using the aging schedules 
in Table 26.2, we can see that 28% of the firm’s credit customers (and 39% by dollar 
amounts) are paying late.
Example 26.3
Problem
Financial Training Systems (FTS) bills its accounts on terms of 3/10, Net 30. The firm’s accounts 
receivable include $100,000 that has been outstanding for 10 or fewer days, $300,000 outstand-
ing for 11 to 30 days, $100,000 outstanding for 31 to 40 days, $20,000 outstanding for 41 to 
50 days, $10,000 outstanding for 51 to 60 days, and $2000 outstanding for more than 60 days. 
Prepare an aging schedule for FTS.

With the available information, we can calculate the aging schedule based on dollar amounts 
outstanding.

If the aging schedule gets “bottom-heavy”—that is, if the percentages in the lower half of 
the schedule begin to increase—the firm will likely need to revisit its credit policy. The aging 
schedule is also sometimes augmented by analysis of the payments pattern, which provides 
information on the percentage of monthly sales that the firm collects in each month after 
the sale. By examining past data, a firm may observe that 10% of its sales are usually col-
lected in the month of the sale, 40% in the month following the sale, 25% two months after 
the sale, 20% three months after the sale, and 5% four months after the sale. Management 
can compare this normal payments pattern to the current payments pattern. Knowledge of 
the payments pattern is also useful for forecasting the firm’s working capital requirements.

2.	 What is the difference between accounts receivable days and an aging schedule?
	
26.4	 Payables Management
A firm should choose to borrow using accounts payable only if trade credit is the cheapest 
source of funding. The cost of the trade credit depends on the credit terms. The higher the 
discount percentage offered, the greater the cost of forgoing the discount. The cost of for-
going the discount is also higher with a shorter loan period. When a company has a choice 
between trade credit from two different suppliers, it should take the less expensive alternative.
In addition, a firm should always pay on the latest day allowed. For example, if the discount 
period is 10 days and the firm is taking the discount, payment should be made on day 10, not 
on day 2. If the discount is not taken and the terms are 2/10, Net 30, the full payment should be 
made on day 30, not on day 16. A firm should strive to keep its money working for it as long as 
possible without developing a bad relationship with its suppliers or engaging in unethical prac-
tices. In this section, we examine two techniques that firms use to monitor their accounts payable.
Determining Accounts Payable Days Outstanding
Similar to the situation with its accounts receivable, a firm should monitor its accounts pay-
able to ensure that it is making its payments at an optimal time. One method is to calculate the 
accounts payable days outstanding and compare it to the credit terms. The accounts payable 
days outstanding is the accounts payable balance expressed in terms of the number of days of 
cost of goods sold. If the accounts payable outstanding is 40 days and the terms are 2/10, Net 
30, the firm can conclude that it generally pays late and may be risking supplier difficulties. Con-
versely, if the accounts payable days outstanding is 25 days and the firm has not been taking the 
discount, the firm is paying too early. It could be earning another five days’ interest on its money.
Example 26.4
Accounts Payable Management
Problem
The Rowd Company has an average accounts payable balance of $250,000. Its average daily cost 
of goods sold is $14,000, and it receives terms of 2/15, Net 40, from its suppliers. Rowd chooses 
to forgo the discount. Is the firm managing its accounts payable well?
Solution
The firm is not managing its accounts payable well. Rowd’s accounts payable days outstand-
ing is $250,000/$14,000 = 17.9 days. If Rowd made payment three days earlier, it could take 
advantage of the 2% discount. If for some reason it chooses to forgo the discount, it should not 
be paying the full amount until the fortieth day.

Chapter 26  Working Capital Management
Stretching Accounts Payable
Some firms ignore the payment due period and pay later, in a practice referred to as 
stretching the accounts payable. Given terms of 2/10, Net 30, for example, a firm may 
choose to not pay until 45 days have passed. Doing so reduces the direct cost of trade 
credit because it lengthens the time that a firm has use of the funds. While the interest 
rate per period remains the same:$2/$98 = 2.04%:the firm is now using the $98 for 
35 days beyond the discount period, rather than 20 days as provided by the trade credit 
terms.
Example 26.5
Cost of Trade Credit with Stretched Accounts Payable
Problem
What is the effective annual cost of credit terms of 1/15, Net 40, if the firm stretches the accounts 
payable to 60 days?
Solution
The interest rate per period is $1/$99 = 1.01%. If the firm delays payment until the sixtieth day, 
it has use of the funds for 45 days beyond the discount period. There are 365/45 = 8.11 45-day 
periods in one year. Thus, the effective annual cost is (1.0101)8.11 - 1 = 8.49%.
Firms may also make a payment on the thirtieth day but pay only the discounted price. 
Some may pay only the discounted price and pay even later than the thirtieth day. While 
all of these actions will reduce the effective annual rate associated with the trade credit, 
the firm may incur costs as a result of these actions. Suppliers may react to a firm whose 
payments are always late by imposing terms of cash on delivery (COD) or cash before 
delivery (CBD). The delinquent firm then bears the additional costs associated with these 
terms and may have to negotiate a bank loan to have the cash available to pay. The sup-
plier may also discontinue business with the delinquent customer, leaving the customer to 
find another source, which may be more expensive or of lower quality. A poor credit rating 
might also result, making it difficult for the firm to obtain good terms with any other sup-
plier. Moreover, when a firm explicitly agrees to the terms of the sale, violating these terms 
constitutes unethical business behavior in most people’s minds.

26.5	 Inventory Management
As we discussed earlier, in a perfect markets setting, firms would not need payables or 
receivables. Interest rates on trade credit would be competitive, and firms could use alter-
native sources of financing. However, unlike trade credit, inventory represents one of the 
required factors of production. Therefore, even in a perfect markets setting in which the 
Modigliani-Miller propositions hold, firms still need inventory.

	
26.5  Inventory Management	
961
Inventory management receives extensive coverage in courses on operations manage-
ment. Nevertheless, it is the firm’s financial manager who must arrange for the financing 
necessary to support the firm’s inventory policy and who is responsible for ensuring the 
firm’s overall profitability. Therefore, the role of the inventory manager is to balance the 
costs and benefits associated with inventory. Because excessive inventory uses cash, efficient 
management of inventory increases firm value.
Benefits of Holding Inventory
A firm needs its inventory to operate for several reasons. First, inventory helps minimize the 
risk that the firm will not be able to obtain an input it needs for production. If a firm holds 
too little inventory, stock-outs, the situation when a firm runs out of goods, may occur, 
leading to lost sales. Disappointed customers may switch to one of the firm’s competitors.
Second, firms may hold inventory because factors such as seasonality in demand mean 
that customer purchases do not perfectly match the most efficient production cycle. Con-
sider the case of the Sandpoint Toy Company. As is typical for many toy manufactur-
ers, 80% of Sandpoint’s annual sales occur between September and December, during the 
holiday gift season. It is more efficient for Sandpoint to manufacture toys at relatively 
constant levels throughout the year. If Sandpoint produces its toys at a constant rate, its 
inventory levels will increase to very high levels by August, in anticipation of the increase in 
sales beginning in September. In contrast, Sandpoint may consider a seasonal manufactur-
ing strategy, producing more toys between September and December when sales are high. 
Under this strategy, inventory would not accumulate, freeing up cash flow from work-
ing capital and reducing the costs of inventory. However, seasonal manufacturing incurs 
additional costs, such as increased wear and tear on the manufacturing equipment during 
peak demand and the need to hire and train seasonal workers. Sandpoint must weigh the 
costs of the inventory buildup under constant production against the benefits of more 
efficient production. The optimal choice is likely to involve a compromise between the two 
extremes, so that Sandpoint will carry some inventory throughout the year.
Costs of Holding Inventory
As suggested by the Sandpoint Toy example, tying up capital in inventory is costly for a 
firm. We can classify the direct costs associated with inventory into three categories:
n	 Acquisition costs are the costs of the inventory itself over the period being analyzed 
­(usually one year).
n	 Order costs are the total costs of placing an order over the period being analyzed.
n	 Carrying costs include storage costs, insurance, taxes, spoilage, obsolescence, and the 
opportunity cost of the funds tied up in the inventory.
Minimizing these total costs involves some trade-offs. For example, if we assume no 
quantity discounts are available, the lower the level of inventory a firm carries, the lower its 
carrying cost, but the higher its annual order costs, because it needs to place more orders 
during the year.
That said, the benefits from reducing inventory requirements can be substantial. In 
2003, the apparel chain GAP reduced its investment in inventory significantly by reducing 
its inventory days outstanding by 24%. This change freed up $344 million for other pur-
poses. GAP invested some of this cash in short-term securities—primarily in U.S. 

962	
Chapter 26  Working Capital Management
government and agency securities and in bank certificates of deposits with maturities 
between three months and one year. The firm reported an increase of $1.2 million in inter-
est income in fiscal year 2003 compared with fiscal year 2002. It attributed the increase to 
increases in the average cash balances available for investment.4
Some firms seek to reduce their carrying costs as much as possible. With “just-in-time” 
( JIT) inventory management, a firm acquires inventory precisely when needed so that its 
inventory balance is always zero, or very close to it. This technique requires exceptional 
coordination with suppliers as well as a predictable demand for the firm’s products. In 
addition, there may be a trickle-down effect when one firm in an industry adopts JIT. For 
example, in 1999, Toys ’R Us instituted JIT, which caused one of its suppliers, toy manu-
facturer Hasbro, to make changes in its production schedule.5

26.6	 Cash Management
In the Modigliani-Miller setting, the level of cash is irrelevant. With perfect capital mar-
kets, a firm is able to raise new money instantly at a fair rate, so it can never be short of 
cash. Similarly, the firm can invest excess cash at a fair rate to earn an NPV of zero.
In the real world, of course, markets are not perfect. Liquidity has a cost; for example, 
holding liquid assets may earn a below-market return, and a firm may face transaction costs 
if it needs to raise cash quickly. Similarly, recall from Chapters 15 and 17 that due to the 
double taxation of corporate interest income, holding excess cash has a tax disadvantage. In 
these cases, the optimal strategy for a firm is to hold cash in anticipation of seasonalities in 
its operating or investment cash flows, as well as to buffer random shocks that affect the 
business. Risky firms and firms with high-growth opportunities tend to hold a relatively 
high percentage of assets as cash. Firms with easy access to capital markets (for which the 
transaction costs of raising cash are lower) tend to hold less cash.6 In this section, we exam-
ine the firm’s motivation for holding cash, tools for managing cash, and the short-term 
securities in which firms invest.
Motivation for Holding Cash
There are three reasons why a firm holds cash:
n	 To meet its day-to-day needs
n	 To compensate for the uncertainty associated with its cash flows
n	 To satisfy bank requirements
Let’s discuss each of these motivations in more detail.
Transactions Balance.  Just like you, a firm must hold enough cash to pay its bills. The 
amount of cash a firm needs to be able to pay its bills is sometimes referred to as a trans-
actions balance. The amount of cash a firm needs to satisfy the transactions balance

26.6  Cash Management

requirement depends on both the average size of the transactions made by the firm and 
the firm’s cash cycle, discussed earlier in the chapter. Firms set the transactions balance so 
that the firm’s cash and other liquid securities are adequate to pay its near-term liabilities. 
One common measure used to assess whether the firm has adequate liquidity to meet 
short-term needs is its quick ratio, which is the ratio of current assets other than inventory 
to current liabilities. By increasing its cash balance, the firm can raise its quick ratio to its 
desired level.
Precautionary Balance.  The amount of cash a firm holds to counter the uncertainty sur-
rounding its future cash needs is known as a precautionary balance. The size of this 
balance depends on the degree of uncertainty surrounding a firm’s cash flows. The more 
uncertain future cash flows are, the harder it is for a firm to predict its transactions need, so 
the larger the precautionary balance must be. A useful measure to assess the firm’s desired 
precautionary balance is the volatility of its operating cash flows over different horizons. 
Firms will typically choose to maintain liquid assets equal to some multiple of this volatil-
ity, in order to avoid the risk of experiencing a cash shortfall.
Compensating Balance.  A firm’s bank may require it to hold a compensating balance in 
an account at the bank as compensation for services that the bank performs. Compensat-
ing balances are typically deposited in accounts that either earn no interest or pay a very 
low interest rate. This arrangement is similar to a bank offering individuals free checking 
so long as their balances do not fall below a certain level—say, $1000. Essentially, the 
customer has $1000 cash that he cannot use unless he is willing to pay a service charge. 
Similarly, the cash that a firm has tied up to meet a compensating balance requirement is 
unavailable for other uses.
Alternative Investments
In our discussion of collection and disbursement floats, we assumed that the firm will invest 
any cash in short-term securities. In fact, the firm may choose from a variety of short-term 
securities that differ somewhat with regard to their default risk and liquidity risk. The greater 
How are companies investing their cash? A 2007 sur-
vey by Treasury Strategies indicated that 20% is invested 
in money market funds (which in turn invest in a diver-
sified portfolio of the short-term securities described in 
Table 26.3), 18% is invested in bonds and notes, and the 
remainder is invested directly in commercial paper, CDs, 
repurchase agreements, and other investments.
During the 2008 financial crisis, short-term credit mar-
kets froze and many businesses that relied on short-term 
credit found themselves unable to conduct business. Even 
firms with sufficient cash balances had to worry about how 
secure their cash was: many banks were in or on the verge 
of default, and even traditionally safe money market funds 
risked losses. As a result, the breakdown in credit markets in 
the early days of the financial crisis was potentially as disrup-
tive for firms that relied on cash balances to conduct busi-
ness as it was for firms that relied on credit.
Corporate liquidity is measured as corporate investments 
in short-term, marketable securities. According to IRS 
­statistics, the cash holdings of U.S. corporations more 
than tripled between 1999 and 2009, rising from $1.6 
trillion to more than $4.8 trillion. Indeed, in 2015 more 
than 39% of U.S. publicly traded firms were net investors, 
having more cash and short-term investments than debt 
outstanding.
Why have companies been accumulating more cash? 
Factors include (i) a shift away from industries such as 
­manufacturing that spend heavily on plant and equip-
ment, (ii) growth in service sectors that have low capital 
­expenditures and high cash flows, (iii) avoidance of repa-
triation taxes by multi-national firms (see box on page 
557), and (iv) a desire by companies to preserve liquidity 
and financial flexibility. As a result, corporate savings has 
reached an all-time high.

Description
Maturity
Risk
Liquidity
Treasury Bills
Short-term debt of the U.S. 
government.
Four weeks, three months 
(91 days), six months 
(182 days), or one year 
when newly issued
Default risk free.
Very liquid and 
marketable.
Certificates of  
Deposit (CDs)
Short-term debt issued 
by banks, minimum 
denomination of $100,000.
Varying maturities up  
to one year
If the issuing bank is 
insured by the FDIC, any 
amount up to $250,000 
is free of default risk 
because it is covered by the 
insurance. Any amount in 
excess of $250,000 is not 
insured and is subject to 
default risk.
Unlike CDs purchased 
by individuals, these 
CDs sell on the 
secondary market, but 
are less liquid than 
Treasury bills.
Repurchase  
Agreements
Essentially a loan 
­arrangement wherein a 
securities dealer is the 
“borrower” and the investor 
is the “lender”; the investor 
buys securities, such as 
U.S. Treasury bills, from 
the securities dealer, with 
an agreement to sell the 
securities back to the dealer 
at a later date for a specified 
higher price.
Very short term, ranging 
from overnight to 
approximately three 
months in duration
The security serves as 
collateral for the loan, and 
therefore the investor is 
exposed to very little risk. 
However, the investor 
needs to consider the 
creditworthiness of the 
securities dealer when 
assessing the risk.
No secondary market for 
repurchase agreements.
Banker’s  
Acceptances
Drafts written by the 
borrower and guaranteed 
by the bank on which the 
draft is drawn, typically 
used in international trade 
transactions; the borrower is 
an importer who writes the 
draft in payment for goods.
Typically one to six 
months
Because both the borrower 
and a bank have guaranteed 
the draft, there is usually 
very little risk.
When the exporter 
receives the draft, 
he may hold it until 
maturity and receive its 
full value or he may sell 
the draft at a discount 
prior to maturity.
Commercial  
Paper
Short-term, unsecured debt 
issued by large corporations. 
The minimum denomination 
is $25,000, but most 
commercial paper has a face 
value of $100,000 or more.
Typically one to six 
months
Default risk depends on 
the creditworthiness of the 
issuing corporation.
No active secondary 
market, but issuer may 
repurchase commercial 
paper.
Short-Term Tax  
Exempts
Short-term debt of state and 
local governments; these 
instruments pay interest 
that is exempt from federal 
taxation, so their pre-tax 
yield is lower than that of 
a similar-risk, fully taxable 
investment.
Typically one to six 
months
Default risk depends on 
the creditworthiness of the 
issuing government.
Moderate secondary 
market.

the risk, the higher the expected return on the investment. The financial manager must 
decide how much risk she is willing to accept in return for a higher yield. If her firm expects 
to need the funds within the next 30 days, the manager will probably avoid the less liquid 
options. Table 26.3 briefly describes the most frequently used short-term investments; these 
short-term debt securities are collectively referred to as money market securities. Firms may 
invest in these securities directly, or through money market mutual funds.

Thus, a financial manager who wants to invest the firm’s funds in the least risky security 
will choose to invest in Treasury bills. However, if the financial manager wishes to earn a 
higher return on the firm’s short-term investments, she may opt to invest some or all of the 
firm’s excess cash in a riskier alternative, such as commercial paper.

26.1  Overview of Working Capital
	
n	 Working capital management involves managing the firm’s short-term assets and short-term 
liabilities.
	
n	 A firm’s cash cycle is the length of time between when the firm pays cash to purchase its initial 
inventory and when it receives cash from the sale of the output produced from that inventory. 
The operating cycle is the average length of time between when a firm originally purchases its 
inventory and when it receives the cash back from selling its product.
26.2  Trade Credit
	
n	 Trade credit is effectively a loan from the selling firm to its customer. The cost of trade credit 
depends on the credit terms. The cost of not taking a discount that is offered by a supplier 
implies an interest rate for the loan.
	
n	 Companies provide trade credit to their customers for two reasons: (1) as an indirect way to 
lower prices, and (2) because they may have advantages in making loans to their customers rela-
tive to other potential sources of credit.
	
n	 A firm should compare the cost of trade credit with the cost of alternative sources of financing 
in deciding whether to use the trade credit offered.
	
n	 Establishing a credit policy involves three steps: establishing credit standards, establishing credit 
terms, and establishing a collection policy.
26.3  Receivables Management
	
n	 Accounts receivable days and the aging schedule are two methods used to monitor the effective-
ness of a firm’s credit policy.
26.4  Payables Management
	
n	 Firms should monitor accounts payable to ensure that they are making payments at an optimal 
time.
26.5  Inventory Management
	
n	 Firms hold inventory to avoid lost sales due to stock-outs and because of factors such as seasonal 
demand.
n	 Because excessive inventory uses cash, efficient inventory management increases the firm’s 
free cash flow and thus increases firm value.
n	 The costs of inventory include acquisition costs, order costs, and carrying costs.

Chapter 26  Working Capital Management
Data Case
You are the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of BP. This afternoon you played golf with a member of 
the company’s board of directors. Somewhere during the back nine, the board member enthusiasti-
cally described a recent article she had read in a leading management journal. This article noted 
several companies that had improved their stock price performance through effective working capital 
management, and the board member was intrigued. She wondered whether BP was managing its 
working capital effectively and, if not, whether BP could accomplish something similar. How was 
BP managing its working capital, and how does it compare to its competitors?
Upon returning home, you decide to do a quick preliminary investigation using information 
freely available on the Internet.
	
1.	 Obtain BP’s financial statements for the past three years from Yahoo! Finance (finance
.yahoo.com).
a.	 Enter the stock symbol (BP) in the box and click “Get Quotes.”
b.	 Under “Financials,” click “Income Statement.” Copy and paste the statement into Excel (if 
using Internet Explorer, place the cursor in the statement and right-click the mouse, then 
choose “Export to Microsoft Excel” from the menu).
c.	 Go back to the Web page and under “Financials,” click “Balance Sheet”; repeat the download 
procedure for the balance sheet.
d.	Copy and paste the balance sheet so that it is on the same worksheet as the income statement.
	
2.	 Obtain the competitors’ ratios for comparison from Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com).
a.	 Enter ExxonMobil Corporation’s stock symbol (XOM) in the box at the top and click “Get 
Quotes.”
b.	 Follow the steps in Part 1 to obtain “net receivables” and “inventory” from the most recent 
annual balance sheet, and “total revenue” and “cost of revenue” from the most recent annual 
income statement.
c.	 Repeat the two steps above for Chevron Corporation (CVX).
	
3.	 Compute the cash conversion cycle for BP for each of the last three years.
a.	 Compute the inventory days using “cost of revenue” as cost of goods sold and a 365-day year.
b.	 Compute accounts receivable days using a 365-day year.
c.	 Compute accounts payable days.
d.	Compute the cash conversion cycle for each year.
	
4.	 How has BP’s CCC changed over the last few years?
	
5.	 Compare BP’s inventory and receivables turnover ratios for the most recent year to those of its 
competitors.
a.	 Compute BP’s inventory turnover ratio as cost of revenue/inventory.
b.	 Compute BP’s receivable turnover ratio as total revenue/net receivables.
c.	 Compute the average inventory turnover ratio and average receivable turnover ratio of Chev-
ron and ExxonMobil. How do BP’s numbers compare to the average ratios of its competitors? 
Do they confirm or refute your answer to Question 4?
	
6.	 Determine how BP’s free cash flow would change if BP’s inventory and accounts receivable 
­balances were adjusted to meet the industry averages.
	
7.	 Determine the amount of additional free cash flow that would be available if BP adjusted its 
accounts payable days to 75 days.
	
8.	 Determine the net amount of additional free cash flow and BP’s cash conversion cycle if its 
­inventory and receivables turnover ratios were at the industry average and its payable days were 
75 days.

	
Data Case	
971
	
9.	 What are your impressions regarding BP’s working capital management based on this preliminary 
analysis? Discuss any advantages and disadvantages of bringing the cash conversion cycle more in 
line with the industry averages.
	
10.	 You are somewhat concerned about the reliability of financial data from the Internet, and decide 
to check the data versus BP’s SEC filings. To obtain these filings, go to the SEC Web site and 
use the EDGAR system to search for BP’s financial statements: www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/
companysearch.html. Enter BP in the ticker symbol field and then click “Search.” Enter 20-F in 
the “Filing Type” field, and then click “Search.” Click on the latest 20-F, “Annual and transition 
report of foreign private issuers,” and then click on the 20-F document link. Once you are in the 
document, scroll down to the table of contents and select “Financial Statements,” and then find 
either the balance sheet or income statement to find the numbers you need. Is there any discrep-
ancy between these numbers and the data you downloaded originally?

Shor⁜t-Term Financial 
Planning
MATTeL, INC. IS A COMpANY IN The STANDArD AND pOOr’S 500 IndeX, 
with year-end 2014 assets of over $6.7 ­billion. ­Mattel designs and manufactures toys 
throughout the world; its major product lines include the Barbie, Fisher-Price, and 
American Girl brands. The demand for toys is typically highly seasonal, peaking dur-
ing the fall in anticipation of December’s holiday retailing season. As a result, Mattel’s 
revenues vary dramatically throughout the calendar year. For example, revenues during 
the fourth quarter of the calendar year are typically more than twice as high as revenues 
in the first quarter.
Mattel’s varying business revenues cause its cash flows to be highly cyclical. The 
firm generates surplus cash during some months; it has a great demand for capital 
during other months. These seasonal financing requirements are quite different from its 
ongoing, long-term demand for permanent capital. How does a company such as Mattel 
manage its ­short-term cash needs within each calendar year?
In this chapter, we analyze short-term financial planning. We begin by showing 
how companies forecast their cash flows to determine their short-term financing needs, 
and we explore reasons why firms use short-term financing. We next discuss financ-
ing policies that guide these financing decisions. Finally, we compare alternative ways 
a company can finance a shortfall during periods when it is not generating enough 
cash, including short-term financing with bank loans, commercial paper, and secured 
financing.

Chapter 27  Shor⁜t-Term Financial Planning
	
27.1	 Forecasting Short-Term Financing Needs
The first step in short-term financial planning is to forecast the company’s future cash 
flows. This exercise has two distinct objectives. First, a company forecasts its cash flows 
to determine whether it will have surplus cash or a cash deficit for each period. Second, 
management needs to decide whether that surplus or deficit is temporary or permanent. 
If it is permanent, it may affect the firm’s long-term financial decisions. For example, if 
a company anticipates an ongoing surplus of cash, it may choose to increase its dividend 
payout. Deficits resulting from investments in long-term projects are often financed using 
long-term sources of capital, such as equity or long-term bonds.
In this chapter, we focus specifically on short-term financial planning. With this 
­perspective, we are interested in analyzing the types of cash surpluses or deficits that are 
temporary and, therefore, short term in nature. When a company analyzes its short-term 
financing needs, it typically examines cash flows at quarterly intervals. To illustrate, let’s 
assume that it is currently December 2018 and consider the case of Springfield ­Snowboards, 
Inc. Springfield manufactures snowboarding equipment, which it sells primarily to sports 
retailers. Springfield anticipates that in 2019 its sales will grow by 10% to $20 ­million 
and its total net income will be $1,950,000. Assuming that both sales and production will 
occur uniformly throughout the year, management’s forecast of its quarterly net income 
and statement of cash flows for 2019 is presented in the spreadsheet in Table 27.1 (also 
shown, in gray, is the income statement for the fourth quarter of 2018).1
From this forecast, we see that Springfield is a profitable company. Its quarterly net 
income is almost $500,000. Springfield’s capital expenditures are equal to depreciation, 
and while Springfield’s working capital requirements increase in the first quarter due to the 
increase in sales, they remain constant thereafter and so have no further cash flow conse-
quence. Based on these projections, Springfield will be able to fund projected sales growth 
from its operating profit and, in fact, will accumulate excess cash on an ongoing basis. 
Given similar growth forecasts for next year and beyond, this surplus is likely to be long 
term. Springfield could reduce the surplus by paying some of it out as a dividend or by 
repurchasing shares.
Let’s now turn to Springfield’s potential short-term financing needs. Firms typically 
require short-term financing for three reasons: seasonalities, negative cash flow shocks, and 
positive cash flow shocks.
Seasonalities
In many industries, sales are seasonal. Figure 27.1 shows the seasonal pattern of sales for 
department stores, sporting goods, and building materials. Department store and sport-
ing good sales are concentrated during the Christmas holiday season, while for building 
materials, sales peak in the spring ahead of the summer building season. When sales are 
concentrated during a few months, sources and uses of cash are also likely to be seasonal. 
Firms in this position may find themselves with a surplus of cash during some months that 
is sufficient to compensate for a shortfall during other months. However, because of tim-
ing differences, such firms often have short-term financing needs.
1Given the extensive coverage we have provided in Chapters 2 and 19 on how to construct pro forma 
financial statements, we do not rehash those details here. The full Excel model for all spreadsheets in this 
chapter is available from 
 or www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/berk_demarzo. Note that, 
for ­simplicity, we have assumed Springfield has no debt, and earns no interest on retained cash.

To illustrate, let’s return to the example of Springfield Snowboards. In Table  27.1, 
­management assumed that Springfield’s sales occur uniformly throughout the year. In real-
ity, for a snowboard manufacturer, sales are likely to be highly seasonal. Assume that 20% 
of sales occur during the first quarter, 10% during each of the second and third quarters 
(largely Southern Hemisphere sales), and 60% occur in the fourth quarter, in anticipation

Income Statement ($000)
Statement of Cash Flows
of the (Northern Hemisphere) winter snowboarding season. The spreadsheet in Table 27.2 
presents the resulting statement of cash flows. These forecasts continue to assume produc-
tion occurs uniformly throughout the year.
From Table 27.2, we see that Springfield is still a profitable company, and its annual net 
income still totals $1,950,000. However, the introduction of seasonal sales creates some dra-
matic swings in Springfield’s short-term cash flows. There are two effects of seasonality on cash 
flows. First, while cost of goods sold fluctuates proportionally with sales, other costs (such as 
administrative overhead and depreciation) do not, leading to large changes in the firm’s net 
income by quarter. Second, net working capital changes are more pronounced. In the first 
quarter, Springfield receives cash by collecting the receivables from last year’s high fourth quar-
ter sales. During the second and third quarters, the company’s inventory balance increases. 
Given capacity constraints in its manufacturing equipment, Springfield produces snowboards 
throughout the year, even though sales during the ­summer are low. Because production occurs 
uniformly, accounts payable do not vary over the year. Inventory, however, builds up in antici-
pation of fourth quarter sales—and increases in inventory use cash. As a consequence, Spring-
field has negative net cash flows during the second and third quarters, primarily to fund its 
inventory. By the fourth quarter, high sales recover cash for the company.
Seasonal sales create large short-term cash flow deficits and surpluses. During the ­second 
and third quarters, the company will need to find additional short-term sources of cash to 
fund inventory. During the fourth quarter, Springfield will have a large short-term surplus. 
Given that its seasonal cash flow needs are likely to recur next year, Springfield may choose 
to invest this cash in one of the short-term investment options discussed in Chapter 26. 

	
27.1  Forecasting Short-Term Financing Needs	
977
Management can then use this cash to fund some of its short-term working capital needs 
during the following year.
Negative Cash Flow Shocks
Occasionally, a company will encounter circumstances in which cash flows are temporar-
ily negative for an unexpected reason. We refer to such a situation as a negative cash flow 
shock. Like seasonalities, negative cash flow shocks can create short-term financing needs.
Returning to the Springfield Snowboards example, assume that during April 2019, man-
agement learns that some manufacturing equipment has broken unexpectedly. It will cost an 
additional $1,000,000 to replace the equipment.2 To illustrate the effect of this negative cash 
flow shock, we return to the base case in which Springfield’s sales are level rather than sea-
sonal. (The marginal impact of this negative shock given seasonal sales would be similar.) The 
spreadsheet in Table 27.3 presents cash flows with level sales and the broken equipment.
In this case, the one-time expenditure of $1 million to replace equipment results in a 
negative net cash flow of $513,000 during the second quarter of 2019. If its cash reserves 
2For simplicity, assume the book value of the replaced equipment is zero, so the equipment change 
does not have any immediate tax implications. Also, assume that Springfield obtains the ­replacement 
equipment quickly, so that any interruption in production is negligible. Finally, assume that Springfield 
increases investment by an amount equal to any increase in depreciation. The general results discussed 
here still hold absent these assumptions, although the ­calculations become more complicated.

are insufficient, Springfield will have to borrow (or arrange for another financing source) 
to cover the $513,000 shortfall. However, the company continues to generate positive 
cash flow in subsequent quarters, and by the fourth quarter it will have generated enough 
in cumulative cash flow to repay any loan. Therefore, this negative cash flow shock has 
­created the need for short-term financing.
Positive Cash Flow Shocks
We next analyze a case in which a positive cash flow shock affects short-term financing 
needs. Although this surprise is good news, it still creates demand for short-term financing.
During the first quarter of 2019, the director of marketing at Springfield Snowboards 
announces a deal with a chain of outdoor sporting goods stores located in the Midwest. 
Springfield will be the exclusive supplier to this customer, leading to an overall sales 
increase of 20% for the firm, with other operating expenses expected to increase accord-
ingly. The increased sales will begin in the second quarter. As part of the deal, Springfield 
has agreed to a one-time expense of $500,000 for marketing in areas where the stores are 
located. An extra $1 million in capital expenditures is also required during the first quarter 
to increase production capacity. Likewise, sales growth will affect required working capital.
Managers at Springfield prepared the projected financial statement in Table 27.4 to 
reflect this new business. Notice that net income is lower during the first quarter, reflect-
ing the $500,000 increase in marketing expenses. By contrast, net income in subsequent 
quarters is higher, reflecting the higher sales. Sales increases in each of the first two quarters 
result in increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable.

27.2  The Matching Principle	
979
Even though the unexpected event in this case—the opportunity to grow more ­rapidly—
is positive, it results in a negative net cash flow during the first quarter, due primarily to the 
new marketing expenses and capital expenditures. However, because the company will be 
even more profitable in subsequent quarters, this financing need is temporary.
Now that we have explained how a company determines its short-term needs, let’s 
explore how these needs are financed.
Concept Check	
1.	 How do we forecast the firm’s future cash requirements?
	
2.	 What is the effect of seasonalities on short-term cash flows?
	
27.2	 The Matching Principle
In a perfect capital market, the choice of financing is irrelevant; thus, how the firm chooses 
to finance its short-term cash needs cannot affect value. In reality, important market 
­frictions exist, including transaction costs. For example, one transaction cost is the oppor-
tunity cost of holding cash in accounts that pay little or no interest. Firms also face high 
transaction costs if they need to negotiate a loan on short notice to cover a cash shortfall. 
Firms can increase their value by adopting a policy that minimizes these kinds of costs. 
One such policy is known as the matching principle. The matching principle states that 
short-term needs should be financed with short-term debt and long-term needs should be 
financed with long-term sources of funds.3
Permanent Working Capital
Permanent working capital is the amount that a firm must keep invested in its short-term 
assets to support its continuing operations. Because this investment in working capital is 
required so long as the firm remains in business, it constitutes a long-term investment. 
The matching principle indicates that the firm should finance this permanent investment 
in working capital with long-term sources of funds. Such sources have lower transaction 
costs than short-term sources of funds, which would have to be replaced more often.
Temporary Working Capital
Another portion of a firm’s investment in its accounts receivable and inventory is tempo-
rary and results from seasonal fluctuations in the firm’s business or unanticipated shocks. 
This temporary working capital is the difference between the actual level of investment 
in short-term assets and the permanent working capital investment. Because temporary 
working capital represents a short-term need, the firm should finance this portion of its 
investment with short-term financing.
To illustrate the distinction between permanent and temporary working capital, we 
return to the Springfield Snowboards example. Table 27.2 presented cash flow forecasts 
assuming seasonal sales. In the spreadsheet in Table 27.5, we report the underlying levels of 
working capital that correspond to these forecasts.
3Some evidence indicates that most firms appear to follow the matching principle. See W. Beranek, 
C. Cornwell, and S. Choi, “External Financing, Liquidity, and Capital Expenditures,” Journal of Financial 
Research (Summer 1995): 207–222; and M. Stohs and D. Mauer, “The Determinants of Corporate Debt 
Maturity Structure,” Journal of Business 69(3) (1996): 279–312.

980	
Chapter 27  Shor⁜t-Term Financial Planning
In Table 27.5, we see that working capital for Springfield varies from a minimum of 
$2,125,000 in the first quarter of 2019 to $5,425,000 in the third quarter. The minimum 
level of working capital, or $2,125,000, can be thought of as the firm’s permanent working 
capital. The difference between this minimum level and the higher levels in subsequent 
quarters (for example, $5,425,000 - $2,125,000 = $3,300,000 in the third quarter) 
reflects Springfield’s temporary working capital requirements.
Financing Policy Choices
Following the matching principle should, in the long run, help minimize a firm’s ­transaction 
costs. But what if, instead of using the matching principle, a firm financed its permanent 
working capital needs with short-term debt? When the short-term debt comes due, the firm 
will have to negotiate a new loan. This new loan will involve additional ­transaction costs, and 
it will carry whatever market interest rate exists at the time. As a result, the firm is also exposed 
to interest rate risk. Financing part or all of the permanent working capital with short-term 
debt is known as an aggressive financing policy. An ultra-aggressive policy would involve 
financing even some of the plant, property, and equipment with short-term sources of funds.
When the yield curve is upward sloping, the interest rate on short-term debt is lower 
than the rate on long-term debt. In that case, short-term debt may appear cheaper than 
long-term debt. However, we know that with perfect capital markets, Modigliani and 
Miller’s results from Chapter 14 apply: The benefit of the lower rate from short-term debt 
is offset by the risk that the firm will have to refinance the debt in the future at a higher 
rate. This risk is borne by the equity holders, and so the firm’s equity cost of capital will 
rise to offset any benefit from the lower borrowing rate.
Why, then, might a firm choose an aggressive financing policy? Such a policy might 
be beneficial if the market imperfections mentioned in Chapter 16, such as agency costs 
and asymmetric information, are important. The value of short-term debt is less sensitive 
to the firm’s credit quality than long-term debt; therefore, its value will be less affected by 
management’s actions or information. As a result, short-term debt can have lower agency 
and “lemons” costs than long-term debt, and an aggressive financing policy can benefit 
shareholders. On the other hand, by relying on short-term debt, the firm exposes itself to 
funding risk, which is the risk of incurring financial distress costs, should the firm not be 
able to refinance its debt in a timely manner or at a reasonable rate.
Alternatively, a firm could finance its short-term needs with long-term debt, a practice 
known as a conservative financing policy. For example, when following such a policy, a 
firm would use long-term sources of funds to finance its fixed assets, permanent working 
capital, and some of its seasonal needs. The firm would use short-term debt very sparingly 
to meet its peak seasonal needs. To implement such a policy effectively, there will necessar-
ily be periods when excess cash is available—those periods when the firm requires little or 
no investment in temporary working capital. While a conservative financing policy reduces 
funding risk, it entails other costs: First, excess cash may earn a below-market interest rate,

thereby reducing the firm’s value. Second, even if the cash is invested at a competitive rate, 
interest income on the cash will be subject to double taxation, an additional cost. Finally, 
holding excess cash within the firm also increases the possibility that managers of the firm 
will use it nonproductively—for example, on perquisites for themselves.
Once a firm determines its short-term financing needs, it must choose which instru-
ments it will use for this purpose. In the rest of this chapter, we survey the specific ­financing 
options available: bank loans, commercial paper, and secured financing.

1.	 What is the matching principle?
	
2.	 What is the difference between temporary and permanent working capital?
	
27.3	 Short-Term Financing with Bank Loans
One of the primary sources of short-term financing, especially for small businesses, is the 
commercial bank. Bank loans are typically initiated with a promissory note, which is a 
written statement that indicates the amount of the loan, the date payment is due, and the 
interest rate. In this section, we examine three types of bank loans: single, end-of-period 
payment loans; lines of credit; and bridge loans. In addition, we compare the interest rates, 
common stipulations, and fees associated with these bank loans.
Single, End-of-Period Payment Loan
The most straightforward type of bank loan is a single, end-of-period-payment loan. Such a 
loan agreement requires that the firm pay interest on the loan and pay back the principal in 
one lump sum at the end of the loan. The interest rate may be fixed or variable. With a fixed 
interest rate, the specific rate that the commercial bank will charge is stipulated at the time the 
loan is made. With a variable interest rate, the terms of the loan may indicate that the rate will 
vary with some spread relative to a benchmark rate, such as the yield on one-year Treasury 
securities or the prime rate. The prime rate is the rate banks charge their most creditworthy 
customers. However, large corporations can sometimes negotiate bank loans at an interest rate 
that is below the prime rate. For example, in its 2007 annual report, Mattel indicated that the 
weighted average interest rate it paid on average short-term borrowings from domestic institu-
tions was 5.5% in 2007. By comparison, the average prime rate in 2007 was 8.05%.4 Another 
common benchmark rate is the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, which is the 
rate of interest at which banks borrow funds from each other in the London interbank market. 
It is quoted for maturities of one day to one year for 10 major currencies. As it is a rate paid by 
banks with the highest credit quality, most firms will borrow at a rate that exceeds LIBOR.
Line of Credit
Another common type of bank loan arrangement is a line of credit, in which a bank agrees 
to lend a firm any amount up to a stated maximum. This flexible agreement allows the 
firm to draw upon the line of credit whenever it chooses.
Firms frequently use lines of credit to finance seasonal needs.5 The line of credit may be an 
uncommitted line of credit, meaning it is an informal agreement that does not legally bind 
4Mattel 2007 annual report and Federal Reserve Statistical Release Web site. On the other hand, in 2015 
Mattel was paying over 10% while the prime rate was only 3.25%.
5Lines of credit may be used for other purposes as well. For example, Gartner, Inc., which provides 
research and analysis on information technology, announced that it would use both cash on hand and an 
existing bank line of credit to finance its 2005 acquisition of competitor Meta Group (Craig Schneider, 
“Dealwatch,” ww2.CFO.com, January 5, 2005).

Chapter 27  Shor⁜t-Term Financial Planning
the bank to provide the funds. As long as the borrower’s financial condition remains good, the 
bank is happy to advance additional funds. A committed line of credit consists of a written, 
legally binding agreement that obligates the bank to provide the funds regardless of the finan-
cial condition of the firm (unless the firm is bankrupt), as long as the firm satisfies any restric-
tions in the agreement. These arrangements are typically accompanied by a compensating 
balance requirement (that is, a requirement that the firm maintain a minimum level of depos-
its with the bank) and restrictions regarding the level of the firm’s working capital. The firm 
pays a commitment fee based on a percentage of the unused portion of the line of credit plus 
interest on the amount that the firm borrowed. The line of credit agreement may also stipu-
late that at some point in time the outstanding balance must be zero. This policy ensures that 
the firm does not use the short-term financing to finance its long-term obligations.
Banks usually renegotiate the terms of a line of credit on an annual basis. A revolving 
line of credit is a committed line of credit that involves a solid commitment from the bank 
for a longer period of time, typically two to three years. A revolving line of credit with no 
fixed maturity is called evergreen credit. In its 2014 annual report, Mattel reported that 
it relied on a $1.6 billion revolving credit facility as a source of financing for its seasonal 
working capital requirements.
Bridge Loan
A bridge loan is another type of short-term bank loan that is often used to “bridge the 
gap” until a firm can arrange for long-term financing. For example, a real estate developer 
may use a bridge loan to finance the construction of a shopping mall. After the mall is 
completed, the developer will obtain long-term financing. Other firms use bridge loans 
to finance their plant and equipment costs until they receive the proceeds from the sale 
of a long-term debt or an equity issue. After a natural disaster, lenders may provide busi-
nesses with short-term loans to serve as bridges until they receive insurance payments or 
­long-term disaster relief.
Bridge loans are often quoted as discount loans with fixed interest rates. With a ­discount 
loan, the borrower is required to pay the interest at the beginning of the loan period. The 
lender deducts interest from the loan proceeds when the loan is made.
Common Loan Stipulations and Fees
We now turn to common loan stipulations and fees that affect the effective interest rate on 
a loan. Specifically, we look at loan commitment fees, loan origination fees, and compen-
sating balance requirements.
Commitment Fees.  Various loan fees charged by banks affect the effective interest rate 
that the borrower pays. For example, the commitment fee associated with a committed 
line of credit increases the effective cost of the loan to the firm. The “fee” can really be 
considered an interest charge under another name. Suppose that a firm has negotiated a 
committed line of credit with a stated maximum of $1 million and an interest rate of 10% 
(EAR) with a bank. The commitment fee is 0.5% (EAR). At the beginning of the year, the 
firm borrows $800,000. It then repays this loan at the end of the year, leaving $200,000 
unused for the rest of the year. The total cost of the loan is
Interest on borrowed funds = 0.10($800,000)
=
$80,000
Commitment fee paid on unused portion = 0.005($200,000)
=
$ 1,000

$81,000

	
27.3  Short-Term Financing with Bank Loans	
983
Loan Origination Fee.  Another common type of fee is a loan origination fee, which a 
bank charges to cover credit checks and legal fees. The firm pays the fee when the loan 
is initiated; like a discount loan, it reduces the amount of usable proceeds that the firm 
receives. And like the commitment fee, it is effectively an additional interest charge.
To illustrate, assume that Timmons Towel and Diaper Service is offered a $500,000 
loan for three months at an APR of 12%. This loan has a loan origination fee of 1%. The 
loan origination fee is charged on the principal of the loan. In this case, the fee amounts 
to 0.01 * $500,000 = $5000, so the actual amount borrowed is $495,000. The interest 
payment for three months is $500,000(0.12/4) = $15,000. Putting these cash flows on a 
timeline:
Thus, the actual three-month interest rate paid is
515,000
495,000 - 1 = 4.04%
Expressing this rate as an EAR gives 1.04044 - 1 = 17.17%.
Compensating Balance Requirements.  Regardless of the loan structure, the bank 
may include a compensating balance requirement in the loan agreement that reduces 
the usable loan proceeds. Recall from Chapter 26 that a compensating balance require-
ment means that the firm must hold a certain percentage of the principal of the loan in 
an account at the bank. Assume that, rather than charging a loan origination fee, Tim-
mons Towel and Diaper Service’s bank requires that the firm keep an amount equal to 
10% of the loan principal in a non-interest-bearing account with the bank as long as 
the loan remains outstanding. The loan was for $500,000, so this requirement means 
that Timmons must hold 0.10 * 500,000 = $50,000 in an account at the bank. Thus, 
the firm has only $450,000 of the loan proceeds actually available for use, although it 
must pay interest on the full loan amount. At the end of the loan period, the firm owes 
$500,000 * (1 + 0.12/4) = $515,000, and so must pay $515,000 - 50,000 = $465,000 
after using its compensating balance. Putting these cash flows on a timeline:
The actual three-month interest rate paid is
465,000
450,000 - 1 = 3.33%
Expressing this as an EAR gives 1.03334 - 1 = 14.01%.
We assumed that Timmons’ compensating balance is held in a non-interest-earning 
account. Sometimes a bank will allow the compensating balance to be held in an account 
that pays a small amount of interest to offset part of the interest expense of the loan.

Example 27.1
Compensating Balance Requirements and the Effective Annual Rate
Problem
Assume that Timmons Towel and Diaper Service’s bank pays 1% (APR with quarterly com-
pounding) on its compensating balance accounts. What is the EAR of Timmons’ ­three-month 
loan?
Solution
The balance held in the compensating balance account will grow to 50,000(1 + 0.01/4) = 
$50,125. Thus, the final loan payment will be 500,000 + 15,000 - 50,125 = $464,875. Notice 
that the interest on the compensating balance accounts offsets some of the interest that ­Timmons 
pays on the loan. Putting the new cash flows on a timeline:
The actual three-month interest rate paid is
464,875
450,000 - 1 = 3.31%

27.4	 Short-Term Financing with Commercial Paper
Commercial paper is short-term, unsecured debt used by large corporations that is usu-
ally a cheaper source of funds than a short-term bank loan. The minimum face value is 
$25,000, and most commercial paper has a face value of at least $100,000. The interest on 
commercial paper is typically paid by selling it at an initial discount.
The average maturity of commercial paper is 30 days and the maximum maturity is 
270 days. Extending the maturity beyond 270 days triggers a registration requirement with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which increases issue costs and creates a 
time delay in the sale of the issue. Commercial paper is referred to as either direct paper 
or dealer paper. With direct paper, the firm sells the security directly to investors. With 
dealer paper, dealers sell the commercial paper to investors in exchange for a spread (or 
fee) for their services. The spread decreases the proceeds that the issuing firm receives, 
thereby increasing the effective cost of the paper. Like long-term debt, commercial paper is 
rated by credit rating agencies.

Short-Term Financing in Fall 2008
0.5%. The onset of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008 
precipitated an explosion in the spread. By October, spreads 
were over 4%. Government intervention helped reduce 
the overnight spread, but the more risky 30-day spread 
remained elevated and actually topped 6% on the last day of 
the year. The new year brought more calm to the short-term 
debt markets and by late 2009 spreads were back to their 
fall 2007 levels. Since that time, spreads have remained low 
(although have trended mildly upward through 2015).
Credit spreads at the level witnessed during the financial 
crisis effectively shut firms like Mattel out of the commercial 
paper market and severely hampered their ability to conduct 
business. In addition, the increased uncertainty in financial 
markets made firms less likely to invest. Both effects were 
significant contributors to the global recession that accom-
panied the financial crisis.
One of the biggest problems firms faced during the financial 
crisis was short-term financing. In the weeks following the 
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the short-term credit markets 
froze. Many investors lost confidence in money market mutual 
funds and withdrew their capital. In response, fund managers 
liquidated their short-term investments, causing the availability 
of short-term credit to contract dramatically and short-term 
yields to skyrocket. Nowhere was this more evident than in the 
commercial paper market. The figure below shows the spread 
(difference) between the yields on the highest-rated commer-
cial paper (P1) and the second-highest-rated commercial paper 
(P2) for two maturities: overnight (red) and 30 day (blue).
Before the collapse of housing prices and the subprime 
crisis in 2007, spreads were tiny—less than 0.2%. Then, 
in the latter half of 2007, spreads increased dramatically, 
at times exceeding 1% and consistently remaining above

27.5	 Short-Term Financing with Secured Financing
Businesses can also obtain short-term financing by using secured loans, which are loans 
collateralized with short-term assets—most typically the firm’s accounts receivables 
or inventory. Commercial banks, finance companies, and factors, which are firms that 
purchase the receivables of other companies, are the most common sources for secured 
­short-term loans.
Accounts Receivable as Collateral
Firms can use accounts receivable as security for a loan by pledging or factoring.
Pledging of Accounts Receivable.  In a pledging of accounts receivable agreement, the 
lender reviews the invoices that represent the credit sales of the borrowing firm and decides 
which credit accounts it will accept as collateral for the loan, based on its own credit stan-
dards. The lender then typically lends the borrower some percentage of the value of the 
accepted invoices—say, 75%. If the borrowing firm’s customers default on their bills, the 
firm is still responsible to the lender for the money.
Factoring of Accounts Receivable.  In a factoring of accounts receivable arrangement, 
the firm sells receivables to the lender (i.e., the factor), and the lender agrees to pay the 
firm the amount due from its customers at the end of the firm’s payment period. For 
example, if a firm sells its goods on terms of Net 30, then the factor will pay the firm the 
face value of its receivables, less a factor’s fee, at the end of 30 days. The firm’s customers 
are usually instructed to make payments directly to the lender. In many cases, the firm 
A Seventeenth-Century Financing Solution
In recent years, it has become more difficult for small busi-
nesses to obtain funding in order to purchase inventory. 
Several factors have contributed to this trend. First, bigger 
banks have acquired many small, regional banks that were 
traditionally important sources of loans to small businesses. 
Second, large banks have tightened lending requirements for 
small borrowers. Third, many small businesses rely increas-
ingly on foreign suppliers that demand payment upfront, 
increasing the immediate demand for capital by small 
businesses.
Some small businesses have started to rely on a 400-year-
old solution: venture merchant financing. This type of 
financing arrangement began in the seventeenth century, 
when groups of investors would provide capital for the voy-
ages of Dutch sea captains. The captains would travel the 
seas, using the capital to purchase exotic merchandise. On 
their return, the merchant bankers would take about one-
third of the captain’s profits when the goods were sold as 
compensation for the financing.
Now consider the Kosher Depot, which sells exotic kosher 
foods to restaurants and supermarkets in Westbury, New York. 
It wanted to grow but lacked access to capital to purchase more 
specialty-foods inventory. Kosher Depot arranged a two-year, 
$3.3 million venture merchant financing arrangement with 
Capstone Business Credit. Kosher Depot would prearrange 
sales and notify Capstone, which would use its capital to buy 
the goods for Kosher Depot. Capstone would purchase and 
import the goods, storing them in its own warehouses. The 
warehouses then filled the orders received by Kosher Depot. 
For its services, Capstone received about 30% of the profits.
The cost of this arrangement—the 30% margin charged 
by the venture merchant—may be expensive relative to 
some of the alternative financing arrangements discussed in 
this chapter. However, the price may be worthwhile for a 
small business with no other short-term alternatives.

can borrow as much as 80% of the face value of its receivables from the factor, thereby 
receiving its funds in advance. In such a case, the lender will charge interest on the loan in 
addition to the factor’s fee. The lender charges the factor’s fee, which may range from 1% 
to 2% of the face value of the accounts receivable, whether or not the firm borrows any of 
the available funds. Both the interest rate and the factor’s fee vary depending on such issues 
as the size of the borrowing firm, the dollar volume of its receivables, and the creditworthi-
ness of its customers. The dollar amounts involved in factoring agreements may be sub-
stantial. In 2014, for example, Mattel had sold nearly $23 million of its accounts receivable 
under factoring arrangements.
A factoring arrangement may be with recourse, meaning that the lender can seek pay-
ment from the borrower should the borrower’s customers default on their bills. Alterna-
tively, the financing arrangement may be without recourse, in which case the lender bears 
the risk of bad-debt losses. In this latter case, the factor will pay the firm the amount due 
regardless of whether the factor receives payment from the firm’s customers. If the arrange-
ment is with recourse, the lender may not require that it approve the customers’ accounts 
before sales are made. If the factoring agreement is without recourse, the borrowing firm 
must receive credit approval for a customer from the factor prior to shipping the goods. If 
the factor gives its approval, the firm ships the goods and the customer is directed to make 
payment directly to the lender.
Inventory as Collateral
Inventory can be used as collateral for a loan in one of three ways: as a floating lien, as a 
trust receipt, or in a warehouse arrangement.
Floating Lien.  In a floating lien, general lien, or blanket lien arrangement, all of the 
inventory is used to secure the loan. This arrangement is the riskiest setup from the stand-
point of the lender because the value of the collateral used to secure the loan dwindles 
as inventory is sold. When a firm becomes financially distressed, management may be 
tempted to sell the inventory without making payments on the loan. In such a case, the 
firm may not have enough funds to replenish its inventory. As a result, the loan may 
become under-collateralized. To counter this risk, this type of loan bears a higher interest 
rate than the next two arrangements that we discuss. In addition, lenders will loan a low 
percentage of the value of the inventory.
Trust Receipt.  With a trust receipts loan or floor planning, distinguishable inventory 
items are held in a trust as security for the loan. As these items are sold, the firm remits the 
proceeds from their sale to the lender in repayment of the loan. The lender will periodi-
cally send someone to ensure that the borrower has not sold some of the specified inven-
tory and failed to make a repayment on the loan. Car dealerships often use this type of 
secured financing arrangement to obtain the funds needed to purchase vehicles from the 
manufacturer.
Warehouse Arrangement.  In a warehouse arrangement, the inventory that serves as col-
lateral for the loan is stored in a warehouse. A warehouse arrangement is the least risky 
collateral arrangement from the standpoint of the lender. This type of arrangement can be 
set up in one of two ways.
The first method is to use a public warehouse, which is a business that exists for the 
sole purpose of storing and tracking the inflow and outflow of the inventory. The lender 
extends a loan to the borrowing firm, based on the value of the inventory stored. When the 

988	
Chapter 27  Shor⁜t-Term Financial Planning
borrowing firm needs the inventory to sell, it returns to the warehouse and retrieves it 
upon receiving permission from the lender. This arrangement provides the lender with the 
tightest control over the inventory. Public warehouses work well for some types of inven-
tory, such as wine and tobacco products, which must age before they are ready to be sold. 
It is not practical for items that are subject to spoilage or are bulky and, therefore, difficult 
to transport to and from the warehouse.
The second option, a field warehouse, is operated by a third party, but is set up on 
the borrower’s premises in a separate area so that the inventory collateralizing the loan is 
kept apart from the borrower’s main plant. This type of arrangement is convenient for 
the borrower but gives the lender the added security of having the inventory that serves as 
­collateral controlled by a third party.
Warehouse arrangements are expensive. The business operating the warehouse charges 
a fee on top of the interest that the borrower must pay the lender for the loan. However, 
the borrower may also save on the costs of storing the inventory herself. Because the 
warehouser is a professional at inventory control, there is likely to be little loss due to 
damaged goods or theft, which in turn lowers insurance costs. Because the control of the 
inventory remains in the hands of a third party, lenders may be willing to lend a greater 
percentage of the market value of the inventory than they would under other inventory 
arrangements.
Example 27.3
Calculating the Effective Annual Cost of Warehouse Financing
Problem
The Row Cannery wants to borrow $2 million for one month. Using its inventory as collateral, 
it can obtain a 12% (APR) loan. The lender requires that a warehouse arrangement be used. The 
warehouse fee is $10,000, payable at the end of the month. Calculate the effective annual rate of 
this loan for Row Cannery.
Loan Guarantees: The Ex-Im Bank Controversy
Exporters looking to finance working capital needs often 
face difficulty obtaining loans from domestic lenders. Lend-
ers may feel unable to evaluate adequately the credit risk 
of foreign customers, for example, making them unwilling 
to lend against the exporter’s accounts receivables, or to 
finance its purchases of inventory.
The Export-Import Bank of the United States, or Ex-Im 
Bank, was established in 1934 by President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt as an independent export credit agency that 
serves to “assist in financing the export of U.S. goods and 
services to international markets.” It does so by providing 
loan guarantees which insure exporters’ receivables against 
the risk of default by foreign customers, as well as risks of 
non-payment due to war or inconvertibility of the foreign 
currency. After obtaining such a loan guarantee, it is then 
usually possible for the exporter to arrange for short-term 
financing of its working capital needs from traditional 
lenders.
Critics of the Ex-Im Bank argue that because the bank 
is government sponsored, these loan guarantees implicitly 
pass the risk of the loans to U.S. taxpayers. If defaults were 
to exceed the bank’s reserves, the federal government would 
need to bail out the bank. Supporters of the bank emphasize 
that the bank creates U.S. jobs by supporting the growth of 
U.S. exporters, and that without these guarantees the firms it 
serves would be unable to obtain competitive financing terms.
After facing controversial reauthorization votes in 2012 
and 2014, the U.S. Congress let the Ex-Im Bank’s autho-
rization expire on June 30, 2015, closing the bank. After 
months of strong lobbying by U.S. businesses, Congress 
voted in a rare bipartisan effort to reauthorize and reopen 
the bank in December 2015.

The method that a firm adopts when using its inventory to collateralize a loan will affect 
the ultimate cost of the loan. The blanket lien agreement exposes the lender to the most 
risk, and will therefore carry the highest interest rate of the three types of arrangements dis-
cussed. While a warehousing arrangement provides the greatest amount of control over the 
inventory to the lender, resulting in a lower interest rate on the loan itself, the borrowing 
firm must pay the additional fees charged by the warehouser and accept the inconvenience 
associated with the loss of control. Although a trust receipts arrangement may offer a lower 
interest rate than a blanket lien, and it allows the firm to avoid the high fees associated with 
a warehouse arrangement, it can be used only with certain types of inventory.

help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
27.1  Forecasting Short-Term Financing Needs
	
n	 The first step in short-term financial planning is to forecast future cash flows. The cash flow 
forecasts allow a company to determine whether it has a cash flow surplus or deficit, and 
whether the surplus or deficit is short term or long term.
	
n	 Firms need short-term financing to deal with seasonal working capital requirements, negative 
cash flow shocks, or positive cash flow shocks.
27.2  The Matching Principle
	
n	 The matching principle specifies that short-term needs for funds should be financed with short-
term sources of funds, and long-term needs with long-term sources of funds.
27.3  Short-Term Financing with Bank Loans
	
n	 Bank loans are a primary source of short-term financing, especially for small firms.
n	 The most straightforward type of bank loan is a single, end-of-period payment loan.
n	 Bank lines of credit allow a firm to borrow any amount up to a stated maximum. The line 
of credit may be uncommitted, which is a nonbinding informal agreement, or may more 
typically be committed.
Solution
The monthly interest rate is 12%/12 = 1%. At the end of the month, Row will owe 
$2,000,000 * 1.01 = $2,020,000 plus the warehouse fee of $10,000. Putting the cash flows on 
a timeline gives:
The actual one-month interest rate paid is
2,030,000
2,000,000 - 1 = 1.5%
Expressing this as an EAR gives 1.01512 - 1 = 19.6%.

n	 A bridge loan is a short-term bank loan that is used to bridge the gap until the firm can 
arrange for long-term financing.
	
n	 The number of compounding periods and other loan stipulations, such as commitment fees, 
loan origination fees, and compensating balance requirements, affect the effective annual rate of 
a bank loan.
27.4  Short-Term Financing with Commercial Paper
	
n	 Commercial paper is a method of short-term financing that is usually available only to large, 
well-known firms. It is a low-cost alternative to a short-term bank loan for those firms with 
access to the commercial paper market.
27.5  Short-Term Financing with Secured Financing
	
n	 Short-term loans may also be structured as secured loans. The accounts receivable and ­inventory 
of a firm typically serve as collateral in short-term secured financing arrangements.
	
n	 Accounts receivable may be either pledged as security for a loan or factored. In a factoring 
arrangement, the accounts receivable are sold to the lender (or factor), and the firm’s ­customers 
are usually instructed to make payments directly to the factor.
	
n	 Inventory can be used as collateral for a loan in several ways: a floating lien (also called a general 
or blanket lien), a trust receipts loan (or floor planning), or a warehouse arrangement. These 
arrangements vary in the extent to which specific items of inventory are identified as collateral; 
consequently, they vary in the amount of risk the lender faces.

ON JULY 14, 2008, ST. LOUIS-BASED ANHEUSER-BUSCH agreed 
to an acquisition by Belgian-based beer giant InBev for $70 per share in cash. The 
agreement ended 150 years of independence for the brewer of iconic Budweiser beer. 
In fact, Anheuser-Busch’s board flatly rejected InBev’s initial $65 per share offer, prefer-
ring to remain independent. However, the sweetened offer, valuing the company at $60 
billion, was too compelling a deal for Anheuser’s board to pass up. Next, InBev’s manag-
ers faced the daunting task of integrating Anheuser’s organization and brands into their 
global company and generating enough value from the transaction to justify the price 
they paid. Given the complexity and potential sums of money at stake, it is clear that 
some of the most important decisions financial managers make concern mergers and 
acquisitions.
In this chapter, we first provide some historical background about the market for 
mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Next, we discuss some of the reasons why a corporate 
financial manager may decide to pursue an acquisition. We then review the takeover 
process. Finally, we address the question of who benefits from the value that is added 
when a takeover occurs.

28.1	 Background and Historical Trends
Mergers and acquisitions are part of what is often referred to as “the market for ­corporate 
control.” When one firm acquires another, there is typically a buyer, the acquirer or 
­bidder, and a seller, the target firm. There are two primary mechanisms by which owner-
ship and control of a public corporation can change: Either another corporation or group 
of individuals can acquire the target firm, or the target firm can merge with another firm. 
In both cases, the acquiring entity must purchase the stock or existing assets of the target 
either for cash or for something of equivalent value (such as shares in the acquiring or 
newly merged corporation). For simplicity, we refer to either mechanism as a takeover.
The global takeover market is highly active, averaging more than $1 trillion per year 
in transaction value. Table 28.1 lists the twenty largest mergers of publicly traded firms 
completed from 1998 through fall 2015. As the table indicates, takeovers happen between 
well-known companies, and individual transactions can involve huge sums of money.
Merger Waves
The takeover market is also characterized by merger waves—peaks of heavy activity fol-
lowed by quiet troughs of few transactions. Figure 28.1 displays the time series of takeover 
activity from 1926 to 2015. Merger activity is greater during economic expansions than 
during contractions and correlates with bull markets. Many of the same technological and

economic conditions that lead to bull markets also motivate managers to reshuffle assets 
through mergers and acquisitions. Thus, the same economic activities that drive expan-
sions most likely also drive peaks in merger activity.1
Figure 28.1 shows that the periods of the greatest takeover activity occurred in the 
1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. Each merger wave was characterized by a typical type of 
deal. The increase in activity in the 1960s is known as the “conglomerate wave” because 
firms typically acquired firms in unrelated businesses. At the time, it was thought that 
managerial expertise was portable across business lines and that the conglomerate busi-
ness form offered great financial advantages. This conglomerate fad eventually fell out of 
favor, and the 1980s were known for hostile, “bust-up” takeovers, in which the acquirer 
purchased a poorly performing conglomerate and sold off its individual business units 
for more than the purchase price. The 1990s, in contrast, were known for “strategic” or 
“global” deals that were more likely to be friendly and to involve companies in related 
businesses; these mergers often were designed to create strong firms on a scale that would 
allow them to compete globally. At the end of 2004, takeover activity began to pick up 
again, starting the next big merger wave, marked by consolidation in many industries 
such as telecommunications and software. This wave also saw private equity playing a 
larger role than it had in the past, with some private equity groups such as KKR, TPG, 
Blackrock, and Cerberus taking ever-larger firms such as Hertz (see Chapter 24), Chrysler, 
and Harrah’s private. The financial crisis and severe contraction of credit in 2008 brought 
an abrupt end to the last merger wave, though activity, in terms of dollar value, has 
again picked up in 2014–2015. In fact, according to data from Thomson Reuters, nearly 
$5 trillion in global M&A deals were announced in 2015, setting a new record.

analysis of why these waves occur.

Types of Mergers
While we tend to talk about merger waves and mergers in general, the term “merger,” as 
commonly used, encompasses several types of transactions that vary by the relation between 
the target and the acquirer and by the method of payment used in the transaction. If the 
target and acquirer are in the same industry, the merger is typically called a horizontal 
merger, whereas if the target’s industry buys or sells to the acquirer’s industry, it is called a 
vertical merger. Finally, if the target and acquirer operate in unrelated industries, the deal 
is a conglomerate merger. Conglomerate mergers, while popular in the 1960s, have gen-
erally fallen out of favor with shareholders because of the difficulty in creating value when 
combining two unrelated businesses.
Deals also vary based on whether the target shareholders receive stock or cash as payment 
for target shares. When they receive stock, the deal is often called a stock swap, because 
target shareholders are swapping their old stock for new stock in either the acquirer or the 
newly created merged firm. The consideration paid to target shareholders can be very com-
plex, including debt instruments, options, and mixes of any of these with cash and/or stock. 
Commonly, however, target shareholders receive stock, cash, or a mix of the two.
While news reports understandably focus on the price and method of payment, the 
structure of a merger transaction, summarized in a term sheet, can be simple or incred-
ibly complex. The items to negotiate include, among other things, who will run the new 
company, the size and composition of the new board, the location of the headquarters, and 
even the name of the new company.

28.2	 Market Reaction to a Takeover
In most U.S. states, the law requires that when existing shareholders of a target firm are 
forced to sell their shares, they receive a fair value for their shares. Typically this concept is 
interpreted as the value exclusive of any value that arises because of the merger itself. For 
practical purposes, this principle translates into the share price prior to the merger. As a 
consequence, a bidder is unlikely to acquire a target company for less than its current mar-
ket value. Instead, most acquirers pay a substantial acquisition premium, which is the per-
centage difference between the acquisition price and the premerger price of the target firm.
Table 28.2 lists the average historical premium and market reaction to a takeover.2 As 
the table shows, acquirers pay an average premium of 43% over the premerger price of the 
2The original research done in the 1970s and 1980s documented that shareholders experience signifi-
cant gains (between 20% and 30%) upon a successful takeover of their firms. See G. Mandelker, “Risk 
and  Return: The Case of the Merging Firm,” Journal of Financial Economics 1(4) (1974): 303–335; 
M.  Jensen and R. Ruback, “The Market for Corporate Control: The Scientific Evidence,” Journal 
of Financial Economics 11(1) (1983): 5–50; and M. Bradley, A. Desai, and E. Kim, “The Rationale 
Behind Interfirm Tender Offers: Information or Synergy?” Journal of Financial Economics 11(1) (1983): 
183–206. More recent papers have found combined losses on the order of $240 billion in capitalization 
at the announcement of takeover bids. This finding appears to be driven by spectacular losses from some 
large takeovers of public targets, especially in the late 1990s. See T. Loughran and A. Vijh, “Do Long-
Term Shareholders Benefit from Corporate Acquisitions?” Journal of Finance 52(5) (1997): 1765–1790; 
and S. Moeller, R. Stulz, and F. Schlingemann, “Wealth Destruction on a Massive Scale: A Study of 
Acquiring Firm Returns in the Recent Merger Wave,” Journal of Finance 60(2) (2005): 757–782.

target. When a bid is announced, the target shareholders enjoy a gain of 15% on average in 
their stock price. Although acquirer shareholders see an average gain of 1%, in half of the 
transactions, the bidder price decreases. These facts raise three important questions that we 
answer in this chapter:
1.	Why do acquirers pay a premium over the market value for a target company?
2.	Although the price of the target company rises on average upon the announcement 
of the takeover, why does it rise less than the premium offered by the acquirer?
3.	If the transaction is a good idea, why does the acquirer not consistently experience a 
large price increase?
Let’s start with the first question—why do acquirers pay a premium over market value? 
In fact, this question has two parts: (1) Why is the target worth a premium over the cur-
rent market value? and (2) Even if the target is worth more than its premerger value, why 
do acquirers pay more than the premerger market price? In the next section, we answer the 
first part of this question. We delay the discussion of the second part until the end of the 
chapter, when we fully understand the mechanics of the takeover process.

28.3	 Reasons to Acquire
For most investors, an investment in the stock market is a zero-NPV investment. How, 
then, can an acquirer pay a premium for a target and still satisfy the requirement that 
the investment is a positive-NPV investment opportunity? The answer is that an acquirer 
might be able to add economic value, as a result of the acquisition, that an individual inves-
tor cannot add.
Large synergies are by far the most common justification that bidders give for the pre-
mium they pay for a target. An extreme example is SBC’s acquisition of AT&T in 2005 for 
more than $15 billion. In interviews immediately after the announcement, SBC’s Chair-
man Ed Whitacre was quick to point out that the projected synergies of $15 billion alone 
could justify the price SBC agreed to pay for AT&T, let alone AT&T’s assets.
Such synergies usually fall into two categories: cost reductions and revenue enhance-
ments. Cost-reduction synergies are more common and easier to achieve because they 
generally translate into layoffs of overlapping employees and elimination of redundant 
resources. This was the case in the SBC/AT&T acquisition, which forecasted 13,000 layoffs

in the first year. If the merger will create possibilities to expand into new markets or gain 
more customers, then the merger partners will predict synergies that enhance their revenue. 
For example, when Dell and EMC announced their merger agreement in October 2015, 
they forecasted $1 billion in revenue-enhancement synergies, partially through providing 
new opportunities for VMWare, partially held by EMC, to sell its virtualization software.
Let’s examine in detail the synergies most often cited by acquirers to justify takeovers.
Economies of Scale and Scope
A large company can enjoy economies of scale, or savings from producing goods in high 
volume, that are not available to a small company. For example, in Stride Rite’s acquisition 
of sports shoemaker Saucony in 2005, one motivation was to reduce Saucony’s manufactur-
ing costs because, due to its larger size, Stride Rite could negotiate superior manufacturing 
contracts in China. Larger firms can also benefit from economies of scope, which are sav-
ings that come from combining the marketing and distribution of different types of related 
products (e.g., soft drinks and snack foods). Many analysts believed that Kraft’s decision in 
2009 to purchase the British chocolate maker Cadbury was motivated by a desire to expand 
Kraft’s snack foods into emerging markets where Cadbury already had a large presence.
There may also be costs associated with size. Chief among these is that larger firms 
are more difficult to manage. In a small firm, the CEO is often close to the firm’s opera-
tions. He or she can keep in touch with the firm’s largest customers and most important 
personnel, thereby keeping abreast of changing market conditions and potential problems. 
Because they receive information quickly, small firms are often able to react in a timely way 
to changes in the economic environment.
Vertical Integration
Vertical integration refers to the merger of two companies in the same industry that make 
products required at different stages of the production cycle. A company might conclude 
that it can enhance its product if it has direct control of the inputs required to make the 
product. Similarly, another company might not be happy with how its products are being 
distributed, so it might decide to take control of its distribution channels.
The principal benefit of vertical integration is coordination. By putting two companies 
under central control, management can ensure that both companies work toward a com-
mon goal. For example, oil companies are often vertically integrated. They generally own 
all stages of the production process, from the oil fields to the refineries and so on, even 
down to the gas stations that distribute their primary product—gasoline. Many also have 
divisions that prospect for new oil.
Vertically integrated companies are large, and as we have already pointed out, large 
corporations are more difficult to run. Consequently, not all successful corporations are 
vertically integrated. A good example is Microsoft Corporation. Microsoft has chosen to 
make the operating system that the vast majority of computers use, but not the computers 
themselves. Many experts have argued that a key factor in Microsoft’s early success over 
rivals IBM and Apple was its decision not to integrate vertically.
Expertise
Firms often need expertise in particular areas to compete more effectively. Faced with 
this situation, a firm can enter the labor market and attempt to hire personnel with the 
required skills. However, hiring experienced workers with the appropriate talent might be 
difficult with an unfamiliar, new technology. A more efficient solution may be to purchase 
the talent as an already functioning unit by acquiring an existing firm. For example, in 

1000	
Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
2000 Paris-based AXA bought Sanford C. Bernstein, a Wall Street private partnership, 
to gain expertise and a preexisting client base in the huge U.S. asset management market. 
Similarly, U.K. builder Amec bought a large stake in Spie Batignolles, a French contractor, 
to gain local contacts and expertise in the French building industry. Such mergers are com-
mon in high-tech industries. Networking firm Cisco Systems is known for its strategy of 
buying young startup firms that have developed promising new networking technologies.
Monopoly Gains
It is often argued that merging with or acquiring a major rival enables a firm to substan-
tially reduce competition within the industry and thereby increase profits. Society as a 
whole bears the cost of monopoly strategies, so most countries have antitrust laws that 
limit such activity.
The extent to which these laws are enforced tends to vary across countries and over time 
depending on the policy of current leaders. When General Electric (GE) agreed to buy Hon-
eywell in October 2000, the U.S. Justice Department approved the deal with limited condi-
tions. However, the European Commission (EC) determined that putting GE’s aircraft 
leasing division and Honeywell’s extensive avionics product line under the same management 
would lead to unacceptable anticompetitive effects in the avionics market. Despite substantial 
concessions by GE and top-level political lobbying by U.S. officials, the EC refused to 
approve the deal, and it was eventually called off. The GE/Honeywell deal was the first time 
a merger of two U.S. companies that had been approved by U.S. authorities was blocked by 
European officials. The EC had no direct jurisdiction over the merger of the companies, but 
it was in the position to impose crippling restrictions on sales inside the European Union.3
Monopoly power could be very valuable, and we would expect that in the absence of strong 
antitrust laws, many companies would merge. However, while all companies in an industry 
benefit when competition is reduced, only the merging company pays the associated costs 
(from, for instance, integrating the target and managing a larger corporation). Perhaps this 
reason, along with existing antitrust regulation, accounts for the lack of convincing evidence 
that monopoly gains result from the reduction of competition following takeovers. For exam-
ple, financial researchers have found that the share prices of other firms in the same industry 
did not significantly increase following the announcement of a merger within the industry.4
Efficiency Gains
Another justification acquirers cite for paying a premium for a target is efficiency gains, 
which are often achieved through an elimination of duplication—for example, as in the 
SBC/AT&T merger mentioned earlier. Acquirers also often argue that they can run the 
target organization more efficiently than existing management could.
While in theory a chief executive of an inefficiently run corporation can be ousted 
by current shareholders voting to replace the board of directors, very few managers are 
replaced in this way. Instead, unhappy investors typically sell their stock, so the stock of a 
corporation with an inept chief executive trades at a discount relative to the price at which 
it would trade if it had more capable leadership. In such a situation, an acquirer could 
purchase shares at the discounted price to take control of the corporation and replace the

minister of Italy from 2011–2013 and helped resolve the Italian debt crisis.

­Economics 11(1) (1983): 241–273; and R. Stillman, “Examining Antitrust Policy Toward Horizontal 
Mergers,” Journal of Financial Economics 11(1) (1983): 225–240.

chief executive with a more effective one. Once the benefits of the new management team 
become obvious to investors, the discount for the old management will likely disappear 
and the acquirer can resell its shares for a profit.5
Although identifying poorly performing corporations is relatively easy, fixing them is 
another matter entirely. Takeovers relying on the improvement of target management are 
difficult to complete, and post-takeover resistance to change can be great. Thus, not all 
inefficiently run organizations necessarily become more efficient following a takeover.
Tax Savings from Operating Losses
When a firm makes a profit, it must pay taxes on the profit. However, when it incurs a loss, 
the government does not rebate taxes. Thus, it might appear that a conglomerate has a tax 
advantage over a single-product firm simply because losses in one division can be offset by 
profits in another division. Let’s illustrate this scenario with an example.
Example 28.1
Taxes for a Merged Corporation
Problem
Consider two firms, Ying Corporation and Yang Corporation. Both corporations will either 
make $50 million or lose $20 million every year with equal probability. The only difference 
is that the firms’ profits are perfectly negatively correlated. That is, any year Yang Corporation 
earns $50 million, Ying Corporation loses $20 million, and vice versa. Assume that the corporate 
tax rate is 34%. What are the total expected after-tax profits of both firms when they are two 
separate firms? What are the expected after-tax profits if the two firms are combined into one 
corporation called Ying-Yang Corporation, but are run as two independent divisions? (Assume it 
is not possible to carry back or carry forward any losses.)
Solution
Let’s start with Ying Corporation. In the profitable state, the firm must pay corporate taxes, so 
after-tax profits are $50 * (1 - 0.34) = $33 million. No taxes are owed when the firm reports 
losses, so the expected after-tax profits of Ying Corporation are 33(0.5) - 20(0.5) = $6.5 mil-
lion. Because Yang Corporation has identical expected profits, its expected profits are also $6.5 
million. Thus, the expected profit of both companies operated separately is $13 million.
The merged corporation, Ying-Yang Corporation, always makes a pretax profit equal to  
50 - 20 = $30 million. After taxes, expected profits are therefore $30 * (1 - 0.34) = $19.8  mil­
lion. So Ying-Yang Corporation has significantly higher after-tax profits than the total stand-
alone after-tax profits of Ying Corporation and Yang Corporation.
Although Example 28.1 is an extreme case, it illustrates a benefit of conglomeration. In 
the United States, however, these benefits are mitigated because the IRS typically allows 
companies to carry back losses up to 2 years, or forward up to 20 years, to offset earnings. 
While that rule would reduce the tax benefit in Example 28.1, it also creates a motive for 
profitable firms to acquire targets with large tax loss carryforwards in order to reap the tax 
savings from them. However, the IRS will disallow a tax break if it can show that the prin-
cipal reason for a takeover is tax avoidance, so it is unlikely that such a tax benefit could, by 
itself, be a valid reason to acquire another firm.
5There are a number of papers that document operational improvements in the context of private equity 
buyouts; see for example, S. Kaplan, “The Effects of Management Buyouts on Operating Performance 
and Value,” Journal of Financial Economics 24 (1989): 217–254; and S. Bernstein and A. Sheen “The 
Operational Consequences of Private Equity Buyouts: Evidence from the Restaurant Industry,” Review of 
Financial Studies (2016), forthcoming.

Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
Diversification
The benefits of diversification are frequently cited as a reason for a conglomerate merger. 
The justification for these benefits comes in three forms: direct risk reduction, lower cost 
of debt or increased debt capacity, and liquidity enhancement. We discuss each in turn.
Risk Reduction.  Like a large portfolio, large firms bear less idiosyncratic risk, so often 
mergers are justified on the basis that the combined firm is less risky. The problem with this 
argument is that it ignores the fact that investors can achieve the benefits of diversification 
themselves by purchasing shares in the two separate firms. Because most stockholders will 
already be holding a well-diversified portfolio, they get no further benefit from the firm 
diversifying through acquisition. Moreover, as we have already pointed out, there are costs 
associated with merging and with running a large diversified firm. Because it may be harder 
to measure performance accurately in a conglomerate, agency costs may increase and 
resources may be inefficiently allocated across divisions.6 As a result, it is cheaper for inves-
tors to diversify their own portfolios than to have the corporation do it through acquisition.
Debt Capacity and Borrowing Costs.  All else being equal, larger, more diversified firms 
have a lower probability of bankruptcy given the same degree of leverage. Consequently, 
such firms can increase leverage further and enjoy greater tax savings without incurring 
significant costs of financial distress. Thus, increased tax benefits and reduction in bank-
ruptcy costs from leverage are potential benefits of diversifying mergers. Of course, to 
justify a merger, these gains must be large enough to offset any disadvantages of running a 
larger, less-focused firm.
Liquidity.  Shareholders of private companies are often under-diversified: They have a 
­disproportionate share of their wealth invested in the private company. Consequently, when 
an acquirer buys a private target, it provides the target’s owners with a way to reduce their risk 
exposure by cashing out their investment in the private target and reinvesting in a diversified 
portfolio. This liquidity that the bidder provides to the owners of a private firm can be valu-
able and often is an important incentive for the target shareholders to agree to the takeover.
Earnings Growth
It is possible to combine two companies with the result that the earnings per share of the 
merged company exceed the premerger earnings per share of either company, even when 
the merger itself creates no economic value. Let’s look at how this can happen.
6See, for example, A. Goel, V. Nanda, and M. P. Narayanan, “Career Concerns and Resource Allocation 
in Conglomerates,” Review of Financial Studies 17(1) (2004): 99–128.
Example 28.2
Mergers and Earnings per Share
Problem
Consider two corporations that both have earnings of $5 per share. The first firm, OldWorld 
Enterprises, is a mature company with few growth opportunities. It has 1 million shares that are 
currently outstanding, priced at $60 per share. The second company, NewWorld Corporation, is 
a young company with much more lucrative growth opportunities. Consequently, it has a higher 
value: Although it has the same number of shares outstanding, its stock price is $100 per share. 
Assume NewWorld acquires OldWorld using its own stock, and the takeover adds no value. In 
a perfect market, what is the value of NewWorld after the acquisition? At current market prices, 
how many shares must NewWorld offer to OldWorld’s shareholders in exchange for their shares? 
Finally, what are NewWorld’s earnings per share after the acquisition?

	
28.3  Reasons to Acquire	
1003
As Example 28.2 demonstrates, by acquiring a company with low growth potential (and 
thus a low P/E multiple), a company with high growth potential (and high P/E multiple) 
can raise its earnings per share. In the past, people have cited this increase as a reason to 
merge. Of course, a savvy investor will see that the merger adds no economic value. All that 
has happened is that the high-growth company, by combining with a low-growth com-
pany, has lowered its overall growth rate. As a result, its P/E multiple should fall, which 
results from its earnings per share rising. Thus, we can draw no conclusion regarding 
whether a merger was beneficial solely by looking at its impact on the acquirer’s earnings.
Example 28.3
Mergers and the Price-Earnings Ratio
Problem
Calculate NewWorld’s price-earnings ratio before and after the takeover described in Example 28.2.
Solution
Before the takeover, NewWorld’s price-earnings ratio is
P/E = $100/share
$5/share
= 20
After the takeover, NewWorld’s price-earnings ratio is
P/E = $100/share
$6.25/share = 16
The price-earnings ratio has dropped to reflect the fact that after taking over OldWorld, more of 
the value of NewWorld comes from earnings from current projects than from its future growth 
potential.
Solution
Because the takeover adds no value, the post-takeover value of NewWorld is just the sum of 
the values of the two separate companies: 100 * 1 million + 60 * 1 million = $160 million. To 
acquire OldWorld, NewWorld must pay $60 million. At its pre-takeover stock price of $100 per 
share, the deal requires issuing 600,000 shares. As a group, OldWorld’s shareholders will then 
exchange 1 million shares in OldWorld for 600,000 shares in NewWorld, or each shareholder 
will get 0.6 share in NewWorld for each 1 share in OldWorld. Notice that the price per share of 
NewWorld stock is the same after the takeover: The new value of NewWorld is $160 million and 
there are 1.6 million shares outstanding, giving it a stock price of $100 per share.
However, NewWorld’s earnings per share have changed. Prior to the takeover, both com-
panies earned $5/share * 1 million shares = $5 million. The combined corporation thus earns 
$10 million. There are 1.6 million shares outstanding after the takeover, so NewWorld’s post-
takeover earnings per share are
EPS =
$10 million
1.6 million shares = $6.25/share
By taking over OldWorld, NewWorld has raised its earnings per share by $1.25.
Managerial Motives to Merge
Most of the reasons given so far are economically motivated, shareholder-driven incentives 
to merge. However, managers sometimes have their own reasons to merge. Studies have 
consistently found that the stock price of large bidders drops on average when a bid is 

1004	
Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
announced, especially when the target is publicly traded. Two possible explanations might 
be conflicts of interest with their shareholders and overconfidence.
Conflicts of Interest.  Managers may prefer to run a larger company due to the addi-
tional pay and prestige it brings. Because most CEOs hold only a small fraction of their 
firm’s stock, they may not bear enough of the cost of an otherwise bad merger that 
increases their personal benefits.7 For example, a CEO who owns 1% of her firm’s stock 
bears 1% of every dollar lost on a bad acquisition, but enjoys 100% of the gains in com-
pensation and prestige that come with being the CEO of a larger company. If the acquisi-
tion destroys $100 million in shareholder value, but increases the present value of her 
compensation by more than $1 million, she will prefer to execute the merger anyway. 
Why would the board of directors create these incentives? Either due to poor monitoring 
of the manager, or belief that the strategy is correct even if the stock market disagrees, 
boards typically increase the pay of CEOs along with the size of the firm, even if the size 
comes at the expense of poorly performing acquisitions.8 We will discuss corporate gover-
nance further in the next chapter.
Overconfidence.  As explained in Chapter 13, people in general tend to be overconfident 
in their abilities. Psychological research has shown that it takes repeated failures for a per-
son to change his belief that he is above-average at some activity. Most CEOs perform at 
most one large acquisition during their tenure as CEO. In a well-known 1986 paper,9 
Richard Roll proposed the “hubris hypothesis” to explain takeovers, which maintains that 
overconfident CEOs pursue mergers that have low chance of creating value because they 
truly believe that their ability to manage is great enough to succeed. The critical distinction 
between this hypothesis and the incentive conflict discussed above is that overconfident 
managers believe they are doing the right thing for their shareholders, but irrationally over-
estimate their own abilities. Under the incentive conflict explanation, managers know they 
are destroying shareholder value, but personally gain from doing so.

In this section, we explore how the takeover process works. We begin by establishing how 
a bidder determines the initial offer. We then review the tax and accounting issues specific 
to a takeover and explain the regulatory approval process. We end by discussing board 
approval, including defensive strategies that boards implement to discourage takeovers.

lose money, acquiring CEOs are financially better off.

Valuation
In Chapter 19, we demonstrated how a bidder values a target company. Recall that we 
explained, in the context of a case study, how an acquirer values a target by using two dif-
ferent approaches. The first—and simpler—approach compares the target to other com-
parable companies. Although this approach is easy to implement, it gives at best a rough 
estimate of value. Valuing the target using a multiple based on comparable firms does not 
directly incorporate the operational improvements and other synergistic efficiencies that 
the acquirer intends to implement. Purchasing a corporation usually constitutes a very 
large capital investment decision, so it requires a more accurate estimate of value including 
careful analysis of both operational aspects of the firm and the ultimate cash flows the deal 
will generate. Thus, the second approach to valuation requires making a projection of the 
expected cash flows that will result from the deal, and valuing those cash flows.
A key issue for takeovers is quantifying and discounting the value added as a result 
of the merger. In Chapter  19, the acquirer was expected to implement operational 
improvements, as well as changes to the target’s capital structure (potentially increasing 
its tax efficiency). As demonstrated in Section 28.3, a takeover can generate other sources 
of value. For simplicity, in this section we refer to any additional value created as the 
takeover synergies.
Conceptually, we can separate the price paid for a target into its pre-bid market value plus 
a premium:
Amount Paid = Target’s Pre-Bid Market Capitalization + Acquisition Premium
(28.1)
From the bidder’s standpoint, the benefit from the acquisition includes both the stand-
alone value of the target (what it is worth on its own) and any synergies created:
Value Acquired = Target Stand-Alone Value + PV(Synergies)
(28.2)
Comparing Eqs. 28.1 and 28.2, if we equate the pre-bid market capitalization with the 
stand-alone value of the target,10 then from the bidder’s perspective, the takeover is a positive-
NPV project only if the premium it pays does not exceed the synergies created. Although the 
premium that is offered is a concrete number, the synergies are not—investors might well be 
skeptical of the acquirer’s estimate of their magnitude. The bidder’s stock price reaction to 
the announcement of the merger is one way to gauge investors’ assessments of whether the 
bidder overpaid or underpaid for the target. As Table 28.2 shows, the average stock price 
reaction is 1%, but the median is closer to zero. Thus, the market, on average, believes that 
the premium is approximately equal to the synergies. Nonetheless, there is large variation in 
the premium across deals. One large-scale study of the value effects of mergers found that 
positive reactions to bids are concentrated in smaller bidders. In fact, during the 1990s, 
87 large public acquirers announced bids that resulted in $1 billion or more in value reduc-
tion at announcement.11 This finding is likely explained by some of the managerial motives 
discussed in the previous section.
10Rumors about a potential bid for the target will often push its share price up in anticipation of the 
premium offer. Practitioners refer to the “unaffected” target price, meaning the target’s share price before 
it was affected by rumors of a takeover. This price would be used to compute the stand-alone value of the 
target.

Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
The Offer
Once the acquirer has completed the valuation process, it is in the position to make a 
tender offer—that is, a public announcement of its intention to purchase a large block 
of shares for a specified price. A bidder can use either of two methods to pay for a target: 
cash or stock. In a cash transaction, the bidder simply pays for the target, including any 
premium, in cash. In a stock-swap transaction, the bidder pays for the target by issuing 
new stock and giving it to the target shareholders. The “price” offered is determined by 
the exchange ratio—the number of bidder shares received in exchange for each target 
share—multiplied by the market price of the acquirer’s stock.
A stock-swap merger is a positive-NPV investment for the acquiring shareholders if the 
share price of the merged firm (the acquirer’s share price after the takeover) exceeds the 
premerger price of the acquiring firm. We can write this condition as follows. Let A be 
the premerger, or stand-alone, value of the acquirer, and T be the premerger (stand-alone) 
value of the target. Let S be the value of the synergies created by the merger. If the acquirer 
has NA shares outstanding before the merger, at share price PA, and issues x new shares to 
pay for the target, then the acquirer’s share price should increase post-acquisition if
	
A + T + S
NA + x
7 A
NA
= PA
(28.3)
The left side of Eq. 28.3 is the share price of the merged firm. The numerator indicates 
the total value of the merged firm: the stand-alone value of the acquirer and target plus the 
value of the synergies created by the merger. The denominator represents the total number 
of shares outstanding once the merger is complete. The ratio is the post-merger share price. 
The right side of Eq. 28.3 is the premerger share price of the acquirer: the total premerger 
value of the acquirer divided by the premerger number of shares outstanding.
We can rearrange Eq. 28.3 to find the following condition for the acquirer to earn a 
positive NPV:
	
x PA 6 T + S
(28.4)
Eq. 28.4 simply states that the value of the shares offered, xPA, must be less than the value 
of the target plus the synergies created. If we let PT = T/NT be the premerger value of the 
target, then we can rewrite this condition to find the maximum exchange ratio the acquirer 
should offer:
	
Exchange ratio = x
NT
6 PT
PA
 ¢
 1 + S
T≤
(28.5)
For example, if the value of synergies equals 20% of the value of the target, you would be 
willing to pay an exchange ratio 20% higher than the current price ratio.

Problem
At the time Sprint announced plans to acquire Nextel in December 2004, Sprint stock was 
trading for $25 per share and Nextel stock was trading for $30 per share. If the projected syner-
gies were $12 billion, and Nextel had 1.033 billion shares outstanding, what is the maximum 
exchange ratio Sprint could offer in a stock swap and still generate a positive NPV? What is the 
maximum cash offer Sprint could make?

Merger “Arbitrage”
Once a tender offer is announced, there is no guarantee that, in fact, the takeover will take 
place at this price. Often acquirers have to raise the price to consummate the deal. Alterna-
tively, the offer may fail. When an acquirer bids for a target, the target firm’s board may not 
accept the bid and recommend that existing shareholders not tender their shares, even when 
the acquirer offers a significant premium over the pre-offer share price. Even if the target 
board supports the deal, there is also the possibility that regulators might not approve the 
takeover. Because of this uncertainty about whether a takeover will succeed, the market price 
generally does not rise by the amount of the premium when the takeover is announced.
This uncertainty creates an opportunity for investors to speculate on the outcome of the 
deal. Traders known as risk arbitrageurs, who believe that they can predict the outcome 
of a deal, take positions based on their beliefs. While the strategies these traders use are 
sometimes referred to as arbitrage, they are actually quite risky, so they do not represent 
a true arbitrage opportunity in the sense we have defined in this book. Let’s illustrate the 
strategy using the 2002 stock-swap merger of Hewlett-Packard (HP) and Compaq.
In September 2001, HP announced that it would purchase Compaq by swapping 0.6325 
shares of HP stock for each share of Compaq stock. After the announcement, HP traded for 
$18.87 per share, so the implied value of HP’s offer was $18.87 * 0.6325 = $11.9353. Yet, 
the price of Compaq was only $11.08 per share after the announcement, $0.8553 below the 
value of HP’s offer. Thus, a risk arbitrageur who simultaneously purchased 10,000 Compaq 
shares and short sold 6325 HP shares, would net 6325 * $18.87 - 10,000 * $11.08
= $8553 immediately. Then, if the takeover was successfully completed on the original 
terms, the 10,000 Compaq shares would convert into 6325 HP shares, allowing the risk 
arbitrageur to cover the short position in HP and be left with no net exposure. Thus, the 
arbitrageur would pocket the original $8553 as a profit.12
The potential profit described above arises from the difference between the target’s stock 
price and the implied offer price, and is referred to as the merger-arbitrage spread. How-
ever, it is not a true arbitrage opportunity because there is a risk that the deal will not go 
through. If the takeover did not ultimately succeed, the risk arbitrageur would eventually 
have to unwind his position at whatever market prices prevailed. In most cases, these prices 
would have moved against him (in particular, the price of Compaq would be likely to 
decline if the takeover did not occur), so he would face losses on the position.
12For simplicity, we are ignoring dividend payments made during the period. HP paid $0.24 and Compaq 
paid $0.075 in dividends prior to the completion of the merger, reducing slightly the profit from the trade 
by 10,000 * $0.075 - 6325 * $0.24 = -$768.
Solution
Nextel’s premerger market cap was T = 1.033 * 30 = $31 billion. Thus using Eq. 28.5,
Exchange ratio 6 PT
PA
 ¢1 + S
T ≤= 30
25
 ¢1 + 12
31≤= 1.665
That is, Sprint could offer up to 1.665 shares of Sprint stock for each share of Nextel stock 
and generate a positive NPV. For a cash offer, given synergies of $12 billion/1.033 billion 
shares = $11.62 per share, Sprint could offer up to $30 + 11.62 = $41.62. Note that this cash 
amount equals the cash value of the exchange offer: $25 * 1.665 = $41.62.

Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
The HP-Compaq takeover was distinctive in that the uncertainty about the success of the 
deal stemmed largely from acquirer discomfort with the deal rather than from target share-
holder discomfort. Although initially supportive of the merger, the Hewlett family got cold 
feet. About two months after the deal was announced, Walter Hewlett disclosed his family’s 
opposition to it. On the day of Walter Hewlett’s announcement, the price of HP stock rose 
to $19.81, while Compaq’s stock price fell to $8.50, causing the merger-arbitrage spread to 
widen to $19.81 * 6325 - $8.5 * 10,000 = $40,298. We plot the merger-arbitrage spread 
for the HP-Compaq merger in Figure 28.2. The risk-arbitrage strategy outlined above is 
effectively a short position on this spread, which pays off if the spread declines. Thus, an 
arbitrageur who opened the strategy when the deal was announced and closed it after Walter 
Hewlett announced his opposition would face a loss of $40,298 - $8553 = $31,745.
Although the Hewlett family members were large shareholders of HP, they were not con-
trolling shareholders; they did not have enough shares to block the deal single-­handedly. 
Hence, a battle for control of HP ensued between the Hewlett family and CEO Carly Fiorina, 
the driving force behind the acquisition of Compaq. This conflict was only resolved months 
later when HP shareholders, by a slim margin, voted in favor of issuing new shares, thereby 
effectively approving the merger and netting a profit for any risk arbitrageur who stayed the 
course. As is clear from Figure 28.2, arbitrageurs who did not have the stomach to hold on 
would have faced large losses at several points during the roller-coaster ride. And while HP 
CEO Carly Fiorina survived this early challenge to her authority, the performance of HP fol-
lowing the merger vindicated Hewlett’s position. HP’s board ultimately fired Fiorina in 2005.
Tax and Accounting Issues
Once the terms of trade have been decided, the tax and accounting implications of a merger 
can be determined. How the acquirer pays for the target affects the taxes of both the tar-
get shareholders and the combined firm. Any cash received in full or partial exchange for 
shares triggers an immediate tax liability for target shareholders. They will have to pay a

capital gains tax on the difference between the price paid for their shares in the takeover 
and the price they paid when they first bought the shares. If the acquirer pays for the take-
over entirely by exchanging bidder stock for target stock, then the tax liability is deferred 
until the target shareholders actually sell their new shares of bidder stock.
If the acquirer purchases the target assets directly (rather than the target stock), then it 
can step up the book value of the target’s assets to the purchase price. This higher depre-
ciable basis reduces future taxes through larger depreciation charges. Further, any goodwill 
created could also be amortized for tax purposes over 15 years. The same treatment applies 
to a forward cash-out merger, where the target is merged into the acquirer and target share-
holders receive cash in exchange for their shares.
Many transactions are carried out as acquisitive reorganizations under the tax code. 
These structures allow the target shareholders to defer their tax liability on the part of the 
payment made in acquirer stock but they do not allow the acquirer to step up the book 
value of the target assets. However, they provide a mechanism for isolating the target’s assets 
and liabilities in a subsidiary of the acquirer. This can be very attractive for an acquirer that 
does not want to be exposed to the known (or unknown) liabilities of the target.
While the method of payment (cash or stock) affects how the value of the target’s assets is 
recorded for tax purposes, it does not affect the combined firm’s financial statements for finan-
cial reporting. The combined firm must mark up the value assigned to the target’s assets on the 
financial statements by allocating the purchase price to target assets according to their fair mar-
ket value. If the purchase price exceeds the fair market value of the target’s identifiable assets, 
then the remainder is recorded as goodwill and is examined annually by the firm’s accountants 
to determine whether its value has decreased. For example, in HP’s takeover of Compaq, HP 
recorded more than $10 billion in goodwill. The footnotes to the statements attributed the 
goodwill to the value of the Compaq brand name, which is assumed to have an indefinite life.
Even when a merger has a positive NPV, bidding managers are typically very concerned 
with the effect of the merger on earnings. This is the other side of the earnings-growth 
argument as a reason to merge. Just as merging two companies can increase earnings with-
out affecting economic value, it can also decrease earnings without affecting economic 
value. Nevertheless, acquirers are hesitant to commit to a deal that would be dilutive to 
earnings per share, even if only in the short run.
Board and Shareholder Approval
For a merger to proceed, both the target and the acquiring board of directors must approve 
the deal and put the question to a vote of the shareholders of the target (and, in some cases, 
the shareholders of the acquiring firm as well).
In a friendly takeover, the target board of directors supports the merger, negotiates 
with potential acquirers, and agrees on a price that is ultimately put to a shareholder vote. 
Although it is rare for acquiring boards to oppose a merger, target boards sometimes do not 
support the deal even when the acquirer offers a large premium. In a hostile takeover, the 
board of directors (together with upper-level management) fights the takeover attempt. To 
succeed, the acquirer must garner enough shares to take control of the target and replace 
the board of directors. When a takeover is hostile, the acquirer is often called a raider.
If the shareholders of a target company receive a premium over the current market value 
of their shares, why would a board of directors ever oppose a takeover? There are a number 
of reasons. The board might legitimately believe that the offer price is too low. In this case, 
a suitor that is willing to pay more might be found or the original bidder might be con-
vinced to raise its offer. Alternatively, if the offer is a stock-swap, target management may 

1010	
Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
oppose the offer because they feel the acquirer’s shares are over-valued, and therefore that 
the value of the offer is actually less than the stand-alone value of the target. Finally, man-
agers (and the board) might oppose a takeover because of their own self-interests, especially 
if the primary motivation for the takeover is efficiency gains. In this case, the acquirer most 
likely plans to undertake a complete change of leadership of the corporation. Upper-level 
managers could view opposing the merger as a way of protecting their jobs (and the jobs of 
their employees). In fact, this concern is perhaps the single biggest reason for the negative 
associations that hostile takeovers generate. Bear in mind that if substantial efficiency gains 
are indeed possible, current management is not doing an effective job. A takeover, or threat 
thereof, might be the only recourse investors have to fix the problem.
In theory, the duty of the target board of directors is to choose the course of action that 
is in the best interests of the target shareholders. In practice, the courts have given target 
directors wide latitude under what is called the “business judgment rule” to determine the 
best course for their companies, including spurning a premium offer if the directors can rea-
sonably argue that more value will eventually be realized for their shareholders by remaining 
independent. The premise of this rule is that absent evidence of misconduct or self-dealing, 
the court will not substitute its judgment for that of the elected, informed directors.
In merger transactions, however, there is heightened judicial scrutiny under what is 
commonly referred to as the “Revlon duties” and “Unocal,” named after the cases in which 
they were established. The Revlon duties state that if a change of control is going to occur, 
then directors must seek the highest value (they cannot favor one controlling entity over 
another based on anything other than value to shareholders). The Unocal case established 
that when the board takes actions deemed as defensive (we discuss these in detail in the 
next section), its actions are subject to extra scrutiny to ensure that they are not coercive 
or designed simply to preclude a deal. The board must believe that there is a threat to its 
corporate strategy and its defenses must be proportional to the magnitude of the threat.

28.5	 Takeover Defenses
For a hostile takeover to succeed, the acquirer must go around the target board and appeal 
directly to the target shareholders. The acquirer can do this by making an unsolicited offer 
to buy target stock directly from the shareholders (a tender offer). The acquirer will usu-
ally couple this with a proxy fight: The acquirer attempts to convince target shareholders 
to unseat the target board by using their proxy votes to support the acquirers’ candidates 
for election to the target board. Target companies have a number of strategies available to 
them to stop this process. These strategies can force a bidder to raise its bid or entrench 
management more securely, depending on the independence of the target board. We begin 
with the most effective defensive strategy, the poison pill.
Poison Pills
A poison pill is a rights offering that gives existing target shareholders the right to buy 
shares in the target at a deeply discounted price once certain conditions are met. The 
acquirer is specifically excluded from this right. Because target shareholders can purchase 
shares at less than the market price, the rights offering dilutes the value of any shares held 
by the acquirer. This dilution makes the takeover so expensive for the acquiring sharehold-
ers that they choose to pass on the deal.

	
28.5  Takeover Defenses	
1011
The poison pill was invented in 1982 by a takeover lawyer, Martin Lipton, who success-
fully warded off a takeover attempt of El Paso Electric by General American Oil.13 Because 
the original poison pill goes into effect only in the event of a complete takeover (that is, a 
purchase of 100% of the outstanding shares), one way to circumvent it is to not do a com-
plete takeover. The first time this work-around was used was by Sir James Goldsmith, who 
took control of Crown Zellerbach by purchasing slightly more than 50% of the outstand-
ing stock. Because he did not purchase the rest, Crown Zellerbach’s poison pill was 
ineffective.
In response to the takeover of Crown Zellerbach, corporate lawyers have perfected the 
original poison pill. Most poison pills now specify that if a raider acquires more than a 
trigger amount (typically 20%) of the target shares (but chooses not to execute a complete 
takeover by purchasing all outstanding shares), existing shareholders—with the exception 
of the acquirer—have the right to buy more shares in the target at a discounted price.
The name poison pill comes from the world of espionage. Once caught, a spy is sup-
posed to take his own life by swallowing a poison pill rather than give up important secrets. 
Poison pills are very effective in stopping takeovers, but where is the suicide analogy? The 
answer is that by adopting a poison pill, a company effectively entrenches its management 
by making it much more difficult for shareholders to replace bad managers, thereby poten-
tially destroying value. Financial research has verified this effect. A firm’s stock price typi-
cally drops when it adopts a poison pill. Furthermore, once adopted, firms with poison 
pills have below-average financial performance.14
Not surprisingly, companies adopting poison pills are harder to take over, and when a 
takeover occurs, the premium that existing shareholders receive for their stock is higher. 
Therefore, because a poison pill increases the cost of a takeover, all else being equal, a target 
company must be in worse shape (there must be a greater opportunity for profit) to justify 
the expense of waging a takeover battle.
Poison pills also increase the bargaining power of the target firm when negotiating with 
the acquirer because they make it difficult to complete the takeover without the coopera-
tion of the target board. If used effectively, this bargaining power can allow target share-
holders to capture more of the takeover gains by negotiating a higher premium than they 
would get if no pill existed. Numerous studies on the impact of anti-takeover provisions on 
takeovers have found that such provisions result in higher premiums accruing to existing 
shareholders of the target company.15
Staggered Boards
A determined bidder in the face of a poison pill has another available option: Get its own 
slate of directors elected to the target board, which it can submit at the next annual share-
holders meeting. If the target shareholders elect those candidates, then the new directors

Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
can cancel the poison pill and accept the bidder’s offer. To prevent such a coup from 
happening, about two-thirds of public companies have a staggered (or classified) board. 
In a typical staggered board, every director serves a three-year term and the terms are stag-
gered so that only one-third of the directors are up for election each year. Thus, even if the 
bidder’s candidates win board seats, it will control only a minority of the target board. A 
bidder’s candidate would have to win a proxy fight two years in a row before the bidder 
had a majority presence on the target board. The length of time required to execute this 
maneuver can deter a bidder from making a takeover attempt when the target board is stag-
gered. Most experts consider a poison pill combined with a staggered board to be the most 
effective defense available to a target company.
While staggered boards and poison pills are an effective defense against hostile take-
overs, preventing such takeovers may not be in shareholders’ best interest. Indeed, many 
investors have come to view these mechanisms as fostering management entrenchment, 
allowing subpar managers to escape market discipline. Increased shareholder activism in 
the 2000s has led to dramatic decline in the use of these devices, as shown in Figure 28.3.
White Knights
When a hostile takeover appears to be inevitable, a target company will sometimes look for 
another, friendlier company to acquire it. This company that comes charging to the tar-
get’s rescue is known as a white knight. The white knight will make a more lucrative offer 
for the target than the hostile bidder. Incumbent managers of the target maintain control 
by reaching an agreement with the white knight to retain their positions.
One variant on the white knight defense is the white squire defense. In this case, a large 
investor or firm agrees to purchase a substantial block of shares in the target with special 
voting rights. This action prevents a hostile raider from acquiring control of the target. The 
idea is that the white squire itself will not choose to exercise its control rights.

Golden Parachutes
A golden parachute is an extremely lucrative severance package that is guaranteed to a 
firm’s senior managers in the event that the firm is taken over and the managers are let go. 
For example, when Procter & Gamble acquired The Gillette Company in 2005, Gillette 
CEO James Kilts was reported to have received a severence package worth $165 million. 
Golden parachutes have been criticized because they are seen both as excessive and a 
misuse of shareholder wealth. In fact, the empirical evidence does not support this view.16 If 
anything, it supports the view that an adoption of a golden parachute actually creates value. 
If a golden parachute exists, management will be more likely to be receptive to a takeover. 
Gillette CEO James Kilts is a case in point. He reportedly solicited the offer from Procter & 
Gamble, which long coveted Gillette. This means the existence of golden parachutes lessens 
the likelihood of managerial entrenchment. Researchers have found that stock prices rise on 
average when companies announce that they plan to implement a golden parachute policy, 
and that the number of firms bidding against one another for the target and the size of the 
takeover premium are higher if a golden parachute agreement exists.
Recapitalization
Another defense against a takeover is a recapitalization, in which a company changes its 
capital structure to make itself less attractive as a target. For example, a company with a lot 
of cash might choose to pay out a large dividend. Companies without a lot of cash might 
instead choose to issue debt and then use the proceeds to pay a dividend or repurchase stock.
Why does increasing leverage make a firm less attractive as a target? In many cases, a 
substantial portion of the synergy gains that an acquirer anticipates from a takeover are 
from tax savings from an increase in leverage as well as other cost reductions. By increasing 
leverage on its own, the target firm can reap the benefit of the interest tax shields. In addition, 
the need to generate cash to meet the debt service obligations provides a powerful motivation 
to managers to run a corporation efficiently. In effect, the restructuring itself can produce 
efficiency gains, often removing the principal motivation for the takeover in the first place.
Other Defensive Strategies
Corporate managers and defense advisors have devised other mechanisms to forestall a take-
over. A corporation’s charter can require a supermajority (sometimes as much as 80%) of votes 
to approve a merger. It can also restrict the voting rights of very large shareholders. Finally, a 
firm can require that a “fair” price be paid for the company, where the determination of what 
is “fair” is up to the board of directors or senior management. Beauty is always in the eye of the 
beholder, so “fair” in this case usually implies an optimistic determination of value.
We might expect the presence of defensive strategies to reduce firm value. However, Pro-
fessors Gregg Jarrell and Annette Poulsen17 found that, on average, the public announce-

Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
Regulatory Approval
All mergers must be approved by regulators. In Section 28.2, we discussed monopoly gains 
from takeovers and the use of antitrust regulations to limit them. In the United States, 
antitrust enforcement is governed by three main statutes: the Sherman Act, the Clayton 
Act, and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The Sherman Act of 1890, which was passed in 
response to the formation of huge oil trusts such as Standard Oil, prohibits mergers that 
would create a monopoly or undue market control. The Clayton Act, enacted in 1914, 
strengthened the government’s hand by prohibiting companies from acquiring the stock 
(or, as later amended, the assets) of another company if it would adversely affect competi-
tion. Under both the Sherman and Clayton acts, the government had to sue to block a 
merger. Often by the time a decision was rendered, the merger had taken place and it was 
difficult to undo it. The Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act of 1976 put the burden of proof 
on the merging parties. Under HSR, all mergers above a certain size (the formula for deter-
mining whether a transaction qualifies is complicated, but it comes out to approximately 
$60 million) must be approved by the government before the proposed takeovers occur. 
The government cannot delay the deal indefinitely, however, because it must respond with 
approval or a request for additional information within 20 days of receiving notification of 
the proposed merger.
The European Commission has established a process similar to the HSR process, which 
requires merging parties to notify the EC, provide additional information if requested 
about the proposed merger, and wait for approval before proceeding. As discussed in the 
Honeywell/GE example, even though the EC technically lacks legal authority to block a 
merger of U.S. companies, it can stop a takeover by imposing restrictions on the combined 
firm’s operations and sales in Europe. Although globally a proposed takeover might have to 
satisfy antitrust rules in more than 80 jurisdictions, practically the most important jurisdic-
tions besides the home jurisdiction of the firm are Europe and the United States.
Weyerhaeuser’s Hostile Bid for Willamette Industries
In November 2000, Weyerhaeuser, a forest products company 
based in Federal Way, Washington, announced a hostile bid 
of $48 per share for its smaller neighbor, Willamette Indus-
tries, based in Portland, Oregon. Weyerhaeuser had been 
pursuing Willamette in private since 1998, when Steve Rogel 
unexpectedly resigned as CEO of Willamette to become 
CEO of Weyerhaeuser. Each time Rogel approached his old 
employer in private, he was rebuffed. The response to the hos-
tile tender offer was no different. Despite the fact that the bid 
represented a substantial premium to the firm’s pre-bid stock 
price, the Willamette board rejected the offer and urged its 
shareholders not to tender their shares to Weyerhaeuser.
Willamette’s defenses included a staggered board and a poi-
son pill, so Weyerhaeuser made its tender offer conditional on 
Willamette’s board canceling the poison pill. Consequently, 
Weyerhaeuser initiated a proxy fight at the next annual 
shareholders’ meeting in June 2001. One of the directors 
up for reelection at that time was Duane McDougall, Willa-
mette’s CEO. One month before the meeting, Weyerhaeuser 
increased its offer to $50 per share, but ­Willamette’s board 
still believed that the offer was too low and worried that too 
many of its long-time employees would face layoffs after the 
merger. Nonetheless, at the annual meeting, Weyerhaeuser’s 
slate received 1.4% more votes than Willamette’s, thereby 
removing Willamette’s CEO from its board.
The loss of the board seats did not change Willamette’s 
position. Willamette unsuccessfully searched for a white 
knight to generate a bidding contest that would force 
­Weyerhaeuser to up its bid. It also entered into talks to buy 
­Georgia-Pacific’s building products division. Such a deal 
would have increased its size and added enough debt to its 
balance sheet to render the firm unattractive to Weyerhaeuser.
In the end, Weyerhaeuser increased its offer to $55.50 
per share in January 2002, and Willamette finally agreed to 
a deal and called off its negotiations with Georgia-Pacific. 
Even without the presence of other bidders, Willamette’s 
board was able to get what it considered to be a fair price 
from Weyerhaeuser.

28.6	 Who Gets the Value Added from a Takeover?
Now that we have explained the takeover process, we can return to the remaining ques-
tions posed at the beginning of this chapter: why the price of the acquiring company does 
not rise at the announcement of the takeover and why the bidder is forced to pay a pre-
mium for the target.
You might imagine that the people who do the work of acquiring the corporation 
and replacing its management will capture the value created by the merger. Based on the 
average stock price reaction, it does not appear that the acquiring corporation generally 
captures this value. Instead, the premium the acquirer pays is approximately equal to the 
value it adds, which means the target shareholders ultimately capture the value added by 
the acquirer. To see why, we need to understand how market forces react to a takeover 
announcement.
The Free Rider Problem
Assume you are one of the 1 million shareholders of HighLife Corporation, all of whom 
own 1 share of stock. HighLife has no debt. Its chief executive is not doing a good job, pre-
ferring to spend his time using the company’s jets to fly to the corporate condo in Aspen, 
Colorado, rather than running the company in Chicago. As such, the shares are trading 
at a substantial discount. They currently have a price of $45 per share, giving HighLife a 
market value of $45 million. Under a competent manager, the company would be worth 
$75 million. HighLife’s corporate charter specifies that a simple majority is required to 
make all decisions, so to take control of HighLife a shareholder must purchase half the 
outstanding shares.
T. Boone Icon decides to fix the situation (and make a profit at the same time) by mak-
ing a tender offer to buy half the outstanding shares for $60 per share in cash. If fewer than 
50% of the shareholders tender their shares, the deal is off.
In principle, this idea could land T. Boone a handsome profit. If 50% of shareholders 
tender their shares, those shares will cost him $60 * 500,000 = $30 million. Once he has 
control of the firm, he can replace the managers. When the executive jets and the Aspen 
condo are sold and the market realizes that the new managers are serious about improv-
ing performance, the market value of the firm will rise to $75 million. Hence T. Boone’s 
shares will be worth $75 per share, netting him a profit of $15 * 500,000 = $7.5 million. 
But will 50% of the shareholders tender their shares?
The offer price of $60 per share exceeds the value of the firm if the takeover does not go 
through ($45 per share). Hence, the offer is a good deal for shareholders overall. But if all 
shareholders tender their shares, as an individual shareholder, you could do better by not 
tendering your share. Then if T. Boone takes control, each of your shares will be worth $75 
rather than the $60 you would get by tendering. In this case it is wiser to not tender. Of 
course, if all shareholders think this way no one will tender their shares, and T. Boone’s deal 
will not get off the ground. The only way to persuade shareholders to tender their shares is 
to offer them at least $75 per share, which removes any profit opportunity for T. Boone. 
The problem here is that existing shareholders do not have to invest time and effort, but 
they still participate in all the gains from the takeover that T. Boone Icon generates—hence 

1016	
Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
the term “free rider problem.” By sharing the gains in this way, T. Boone Icon is forced to 
give up substantial profits and thus will likely choose not to bother at all.18
Toeholds
One way for T. Boone to get around the problem of shareholders’ reluctance to tender 
their shares is to buy the shares in the market anonymously. However, SEC rules make it 
difficult for investors to buy much more than about 10% of a firm in secret.19 After 
T. Boone acquires such an initial stake in the target, called a toehold, he would have to 
make his intentions public by informing investors of his large stake. To successfully gain 
control of HighLife, he would have to announce a tender offer to buy an additional 40% 
of the shares for $75 per share. Once in control, he would be able to sell his stake for $75 
per share. Assuming he accumulated the first 10% for $50 per share, his profits in this case 
will be $25 * 100,000 = $2.5 million. Not bad, but substantially less than the value he is 
adding.
Why should investors care whether T. Boone’s profits are substantially lower than the 
value he is adding? The answer is that people like T. Boone perform an important service. 
Because of the threat that such a person might attempt to take over their company and 
fire them, chief executives are less likely to shirk their duties. Thus, the more profitable we 
make this activity, the less likely we will have to resort to it. If $2.5 million is not enough 
to justify T. Boone’s time and effort, he will not try to acquire HighLife. Current manage-
ment will remain entrenched and T. Boone will think about acquiring the company only if 
further erosion in the stock price makes the deal lucrative enough for him.
A number of legal mechanisms exist that allow acquirers to avoid the free rider problem 
and capture more of the gains from the acquisition. We describe the two most common, 
the leveraged buyout and the freezeout merger, next.
The Leveraged Buyout
The good news for shareholders is that another significantly lower-cost mechanism allows 
people like T. Boone Icon to take over companies and fire underperforming managers. 
Recall from Chapter 24 that this mechanism is called the leveraged buyout (LBO). Let’s 
illustrate how it works by returning to HighLife Corporation.20
Assume that T. Boone chooses not to buy any shares in the market secretly, but instead 
announces a tender offer for half the outstanding shares at a price of $50 per share. How-
ever, instead of using his own cash to pay for these shares, he borrows the money through 
a shell corporation by pledging the shares themselves as collateral on the loan. The only time 
he will need the money is if the tender offer succeeds, so the banks lending the money can 
be certain that he will have control of the collateral. Even more important, if the tender 
offer succeeds, with control of the company, T. Boone can merge the target with the shell 
corporation, effectively attaching the loans directly to the target—that is, it is as if the 
18A rigorous analysis of the free rider problem in mergers can be found in S. Grossman and O. Hart, 
“Takeover Bids, the Free-Rider Problem, and the Theory of the Corporation,” Bell Journal of Economics 
11(1) (1980): 42–64.
19The rules actually require that any shareholder who owns more than 5% of a firm publicly disclose this 
fact, but the time delays in the disclosure process allow investors to accumulate more than 5% of the firm 
before this information is made public.
20For a further discussion of this mechanism, see H. Mueller and F. Panunzi, “Tender Offers and Lever-
age,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 119 (2004): 1217–1248.

	
28.6  Who Gets the Value Added from a Takeover?	
1017
Example 28.5
Leveraged Buyout
Problem
FAT Corporation stock is currently trading at $40 per share. There are 20 million shares out-
standing, and the company has no debt. You are a partner in a firm that specializes in leveraged 
buyouts. Your analysis indicates that the management of this corporation could be improved 
considerably. If the managers were replaced with more capable ones, you estimate that the value 
of the company would increase by 50%. You decide to initiate a leveraged buyout and issue a 
tender offer for at least a controlling interest—50% of the outstanding shares. What is the maxi-
mum amount of value you can extract and still complete the deal?
Solution
Currently, the value of the company is $40 * 20 million = $800 million, and you estimate you 
can add an additional 50%, or $400 million. If you borrow $400 million and the tender offer 
succeeds, you will take control of the company and install new management. The total value of 
the company will increase by 50% to $1.2 billion. You will also attach the debt to the company, 
so the company will now have $400 million in debt. The value of the equity once the deal is 
done is the total value minus the debt outstanding:
Total Equity = 1200 - 400 = $800 million
The value of the equity is the same as the premerger value. You own half the shares, which are 
worth $400 million, and paid nothing for them, so you have captured the value you anticipated 
adding to FAT.
The Leveraged Buyout of RJR-Nabisco by KKR
By the summer of 1988, Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR 
Nabisco (RJR), was becoming increasingly worried about the 
poor stock price performance of the conglomerate. Despite 
a strong earnings record, management had not been able to 
shake loose its image as a tobacco company, and the stock 
price was languishing at $55 per share. In October 1988, 
Johnson and a small team of RJR’s executives, backed by the 
Wall Street firms of Shearson Lehman Hutton and Salomon 
Brothers, announced a bid of $75 per share for the company. 
At this price, the deal would have been valued at $17.6 bil-
lion, more than twice as large as the largest LBO completed 
up to that point. Because this deal involved the current man-
agement of the company, it falls into a special category of 
LBO deals called management buyouts (MBOs).
The announcement focused Wall Street’s attention on 
RJR. Even at this substantial premium, the MBO appeared 
to be a good deal for Johnson and his team, because soon 
after the offer went public, it became hotly contested. 
Foremost among the contenders was the firm of Kohlberg, 
Kravis, and Roberts (KKR). KKR launched its own bid with 
a cash offer of $90 per share. A bidding war ensued that saw 
the offer price ultimately rise to $109 per share, valuing the 
deal at more than $25 billion. In the end, both Johnson 
and KKR offered very similar deals, although management’s 
final bid was slightly higher than KKR’s. Eventually, RJR’s 
board accepted KKR’s bid of $109 per RJR share. The offer 
price comprised $81 per share in cash, $18 per share in pre-
ferred stock, and $10 per share in debenture securities.
From an economic point of view, this outcome is sur-
prising. One would think that given their inside knowledge 
of the company, management would be in the best position 
not only to value it, but also to run it. Why, then, would 
an outsider choose to outbid an insider for a company? 
The answer in RJR’s case appeared to point to the manag-
ers themselves. As the deal proceeded, it became increasingly 
obvious to investors that executives (and members of the 
board of directors) enjoyed perks that were unprecedented. 
For example, Johnson had the personal use of numerous cor-
porate apartments in different cities and literally a fleet of 
corporate jets that he, the top executives, and members of 
the corporate board used for personal travel. In their lever-
aged buyout proposal, they had obtained a 4% equity stake 
for top executives that was worth almost $1 billion, $52.5 
million in golden parachutes, and assurances that the RJR air 
force (the fleet of corporate jets) and the flamboyant Atlanta 
headquarters would not be subject to budget cutting.

Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
What if you borrowed more than $400 million? Assume you were able to borrow $450 mil-
lion. The value of equity after the merger would be
Total Equity = 1200 - 450 = $750 million
This is lower than the premerger value. Recall, however, that in the United States, existing share-
holders must be offered at least the premerger price for their shares. Because existing shareholders 
anticipate that the share price will be lower once the deal is complete, all shareholders will tender 
their shares. This implies that you will have to pay $800 million for these shares, and so to com-
plete the deal, you will have to pay 800 - 450 = $350 million out of your own pocket. In the 
end, you will own all the equity, which is worth $750 million. You paid $350 million for it, so 
your profit is again $400 million. Thus, you cannot extract more value than the value you add to 
the company by taking it over.
target corporation, and not T. Boone, has borrowed the money. At the end of this process,  
T. Boone still owns half the shares, but the corporation is responsible for repaying the 
loan. T. Boone has effectively acquired half the shares without paying for them!
You might imagine that no shareholder would be willing to tender her shares under 
these circumstances. Surprisingly, this conclusion is wrong. If you tender your shares, you 
will receive $50 for each of them. If you do not tender your shares, but enough other 
shareholders do, then T. Boone will take control of the company. After he replaces the 
managers, the enterprise value of the company will be $75 million. What will your shares 
be worth if you did not tender them?
For simplicity, assume that there are no frictions or taxes. To gain control of the firm, 
T. Boone borrowed $25 million to purchase half the outstanding shares ($50 * 500,000). 
Because this debt is now attached to HighLife, the total value of HighLife’s equity is just 
the total value of the company, minus the value of debt:
Total Value of HighLife’s Equity = $75 million - $25 million = $50 million
The total number of outstanding shares is the same (remember that T. Boone pur-
chased existing shares), so the price per share is $50 million , 1 million = $50/share. If 
the tender offer succeeds, you will be indifferent. Whether you tender your shares or keep 
them, each is always worth $50. If you keep your shares and the tender offer fails, the price 
per share stays at $45. Clearly, it is always in your best interests to tender your shares, so 
T. Boone’s tender offer will succeed. T. Boone also makes substantially more profits than 
he would if he used a toehold strategy—his profits are the value of his shares upon comple-
tion of the takeover: $50 * 500,000 = $25 million.
The examples we have illustrated are extreme in that the acquirer takes over the target 
without paying any premium and with no initial investment. In practice, premiums in 
LBO transactions are often quite substantial—while they can avoid the free rider problem, 
acquirers must still get board approval to overcome other defenses such as poison pills, as 
well as outbid other potential acquirers. And while in earlier times it was possible to fund 
deals with over 90% leverage, lenders today typically require that the acquirer have a sig-
nificant equity stake as protection for the debt holders, in case the claimed post-acquisition 
benefits do not materialize. In the $15.2 billion Hertz LBO (at the time in 2006, the 
­second largest in history), which we described in Chapter 24, the acquirers contributed 
$2.3 billion in equity out of $12.9 billion of total capital raised. As shown in Figure 28.4, 
recent LBOs tend to have equity stakes closer to 40%.
From 2003 to 2007, there was a surge in leveraged buyout activity, fueled by a ­combination 
of huge flows of capital to buy out (private equity) firms, and increased ­appetite for risk by 

	
28.6  Who Gets the Value Added from a Takeover?	
1019
lenders willing to allow buyout groups to leverage their equity investment at attractive terms 
(see Figure 23.2 on page 865). Buyout firms took many ­companies ­private with the stated 
goal of increasing their performance without concern for perceived pressure from public 
investors to meet short-term earnings targets. They also employed so-called “roll-up” strate-
gies whereby they would buy many smaller, already private firms in a particular industry and 
consolidate them into a larger player. The typical LBO has a planned exit in five years, either 
by taking the firm public again, or selling it to an operating firm or another private equity 
group. In 2008, the financial crisis and contraction of credit put an almost complete halt to 
private equity activity. Some highly levered private equity transactions from the peak faltered 
under their debt load during the recession. For example, Chrysler, which had been pur-
chased and taken private from Daimler Chrysler AG by private equity firm Cerberus Group, 
declared bankruptcy in 2009, wiping out Cerberus’ stake in the firm.The LBO market has 
gradually recovered in the years since the financial crisis, and by 2015 the annual dollar vol-
ume of deals is back at 2005 levels (see Figure 23.2 on page 865).
The Freezeout Merger
Although a leveraged buyout is an effective tool for a group of investors to use to purchase 
a company, it is less well suited to the case of one company acquiring another. An alterna-
tive is the freezeout merger: The laws on tender offers allow the acquiring company to 
freeze existing shareholders out of the gains from merging by forcing non-tendering share-
holders to sell their shares for the tender offer price. Let’s see how this is accomplished.
An acquiring company makes a tender offer at an amount slightly higher than the current 
target stock price. If the tender offer succeeds, the acquirer gains control of the target and 
merges its assets into a new corporation, which is fully owned by the acquirer. In effect, the non-
tendering shareholders lose their shares because the target corporation no longer exists. In com-
pensation, non-tendering shareholders get the right to receive the tender offer price for their 
shares. The bidder, in essence, gets complete ownership of the target for the tender offer price.21
21 Y. Amihud, M. Kahan, and R. K. Sundaram, “The Foundations of Freezeout Laws in Takeovers,” Journal 
of Finance 59 (2004): 1325–1344, contains a detailed discussion of the mechanics of freezeout mergers.

While early LBOs were often 
financed with over 90% 
leverage, average equity 
stakes for U.S. LBOs have 
averaged about 40% over 
the past decade. They 
exceeded 50% during the

Chapter 28  Mergers and Acquisitions
Because the value the non-tendering shareholders receive for their shares is equal to the 
tender price (which is more than the premerger stock price), the law generally recognizes it 
as fair value and non-tendering shareholders have no legal recourse. Under these circum-
stances, existing shareholders will tender their stock, reasoning that there is no benefit to 
holding out: If the tender offer succeeds, they get the tender price anyway; if they hold out, 
they risk jeopardizing the deal and forgoing the small gain. Hence the acquirer is able to 
capture almost all the value added from the merger and, as in a leveraged buyout, is able to 
effectively eliminate the free rider problem.
The freezeout tender offer has a significant advantage over a leveraged buyout because 
an acquiring corporation need not make an all-cash offer. Instead of paying the target’s 
shareholders in cash, it can use shares of its own stock to pay for the acquisition. In this 
case, the bidder offers to exchange each shareholder’s stock in the target for stock in the 
acquiring company. As long as the exchange rate is set so that the value in the acquirer’s 
stock exceeds the premerger market value of the target stock, the non-tendering sharehold-
ers will receive fair value for their shares and will have no legal recourse.
Competition
The empirical evidence in Table 28.2 suggests that, despite the availability of both the 
freezeout merger and the leveraged buyout as acquisition strategies, most of the value 
added still appears to accrue to the target shareholders. That is, on average, acquirers do 
not have a positive price reaction on the announcement of a takeover. Why do acquirers 
choose to pay so large a premium that they effectively hand the value they create to the 
target company’s shareholders?
In addition to the presence of the takeover defenses we have previously discussed, the 
most likely explanation is the competition that exists in the takeover market. Once an 
acquirer starts bidding on a target company and it becomes clear that a significant gain 
exists, other potential acquirers may submit their own bids. The result is effectively an auc-
tion in which the target is sold to the highest bidder. Even when a bidding war does not 
result, most likely it is because, rather than participate in a bidding war, an acquirer offered 
a large enough initial premium to forestall the process. In essence, it must give up most of 
the value added to the target shareholders.

28.1  Background and Historical Trends
	
n	 Mergers can be horizontal, vertical, or conglomerate. The global takeover market is active, 
averaging more than $1 trillion per year in transaction value. The periods of greatest activity 
have been the 1960s, 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. During the 1960s, deals were aimed at building 
conglomerates. In the 1980s, the trend reversed and conglomerates were split into individual 
businesses. The 1990s saw a rise in “strategic” or “global” deals designed to create firms that 
could compete globally. From 2004–2008, further consolidation and global-scale deals con-
tributed to the most recent merger wave.

28.2  Market Reaction to a Takeover
	
n	 While on average the shareholders of the acquiring firm obtain small or no gains, shareholders 
from the acquired firm typically enjoy gains of 15% on the announcement of a takeover bid.
28.3  Reasons to Acquire
	
n	 The most common justifications given for acquiring a firm are the synergies that can be 
gained through an acquisition. The most commonly cited sources of synergies are economies 
of scale and scope, the control provided by vertical integration, gaining monopolistic power, 
the expertise gained from the acquired company, improvements in operating efficiency, and 
benefits related to diversification such as increased borrowing capacity and tax savings. Share-
holders of a private company that is acquired gain by switching to a more liquid invest-
ment. Some mergers are motivated by incentive conflicts or overconfidence of the acquirer’s 
management.
	
n	 From the bidder’s perspective, a takeover is a positive-NPV project only if the premium paid 
does not exceed the synergies created. The bidder’s stock price reaction to the announcement of 
the merger is one way to gauge investors’ assessments of whether the bidder overpaid or under-
paid for the target.
28.4  Valuation and the Takeover Process
	
n	 The acquisition is positive-NPV for the acquirer only if the total amount paid does not exceed 
the standalone value of the target plus the value of the synergies from the transaction.
	
n	 If we equate the standalone value with the pre-bid value of the target, the transaction is positive-
NPV for the acquirer if the value of the synergies exceeds the premium paid. For an all stock 
transaction, this requires

(28.5)
	
n	 A tender offer is a public announcement of an intention to purchase a large block of shares for 
a specified price. Making a tender offer does not guarantee that a deal will take place.
	
n	 Bidders use either of two methods to pay for a target: cash or stock. In a cash transaction, the bid-
der simply pays for the target in cash. In a stock-swap transaction, the bidder pays for the target by 
issuing new stock and giving it to the target shareholders. The method used by the bidder to pay 
for the acquired firm has tax and accounting implications.
	
n	 For a merger to proceed, both the target and the acquiring board of directors must approve the 
merger and put the question to a vote of the shareholders of the target (and, in some cases, the 
shareholders of the acquiring firm as well). In a friendly takeover, the target board of directors 
supports the merger and negotiates with the potential acquirers. If the target board opposes 
the merger, then the acquirer must go around the target board and appeal directly to the target 
shareholders, asking them to elect a new board that will support the merger.
28.5  Takeover Defenses
	
n	 The most effective takeover defense strategy is the poison pill, which gives target shareholders 
the right to buy shares in either the target or the acquirer at a deeply discounted price. The 
purchase is effectively subsidized by the existing shareholders of the acquirer, making the take-
over very expensive.
	
n	 Another effective defense strategy is having a staggered board, which prevents a bidder from 
acquiring control over the board in a short period of time.
	
n	 Other defenses include looking for a friendly bidder (a white knight), making it expensive to 
replace management, and changing the capital structure of the firm.

­chapter, but the following books address the topics of this chapter in more detail: J. Weston, 
M. Mitchell, and J. Mulherin, Takeovers, Restructuring and Corporate Finance (Prentice-Hall, 2004); 
L. Herzel and R. Shepro, Bidders and Targets: Mergers and Acquisitions in the U.S. (Basil Blackwell,

28.6  Who Gets the Value Added from a Takeover?
	
n	 When a bidder makes an offer for a firm, the target shareholders can benefit by keeping their 
shares and letting other shareholders sell at a low price. However, because all sharehold-
ers have the incentive to keep their shares, no one will sell. This scenario is known as the 
free rider problem. To overcome this problem, bidders can acquire a toehold in the target, 
attempt a leveraged buyout, or, in the case when the acquirer is a corporation, offer a freeze-
out merger.

Reasons to Acquire
	
5.	 If you are planning an acquisition that is motivated by trying to acquire expertise, you are basi-
cally seeking to gain intellectual capital. What concerns would you have in structuring the deal 
and the post-merger integration that would be different from the concerns you would have 
when buying physical capital?
	
6.	 Do you agree that the European Union should be able to block mergers between two U.S.-
based firms? Why or why not?
	
7.	 How do the carryforward and carryback provisions of the U.S. tax code affect the benefits of 
merging to capture operating losses?
	
8.	 Diversification is good for shareholders. So why shouldn’t managers acquire firms in different 
industries to diversify a company?
	
9.	 Your company has earnings per share of $4. It has 1.6 million shares outstanding, each of which 
has a price of $56. You are thinking of buying TargetCo, which has earnings per share of $1,  
1.3 million shares outstanding, and a price per share of $24. You will pay for TargetCo by 
­issuing new shares. There are no expected synergies from the transaction.
a.	 If you pay no premium to buy TargetCo, what will your earnings per share be after the 
merger?
b.	 Suppose you offer an exchange ratio such that, at current pre-announcement share prices for 
both firms, the offer represents a 20% premium to buy TargetCo. What will your earnings 
per share be after the merger?
c.	 What explains the change in earnings per share in part (a)? Are your shareholders any better 
or worse off?
d.	What will your price-earnings ratio be after the merger (if you pay no premium)? How does 
this compare to your P/E ratio before the merger? How does this compare to TargetCo’s 
premerger P/E ratio?
	
10.	 If companies in the same industry as TargetCo (from Problem 9) are trading at multiples of 
14 times earnings, what would be one estimate of an appropriate premium for TargetCo?
	
11.	 You are invested in GreenFrame, Inc. The CEO owns 4% of GreenFrame and is consider-
ing an acquisition. If the acquisition destroys $57 million of GreenFrame’s value, but the 
present value of the CEO’s compensation increases by $5 million, will he be better or 
worse off?
Valuation and the Takeover Process
	
12.	 Loki, Inc., and Thor, Inc., have entered into a stock swap merger agreement whereby Loki will 
pay a 22% premium over Thor’s premerger price. If Thor’s premerger price per share was $42 
and Loki’s was $53, what exchange ratio will Loki need to offer?
	
13.	 The NFF Corporation has announced plans to acquire LE Corporation. NFF is trading for $48 
per share and LE is trading for $74 per share, implying a premerger value of LE of approxi-
mately $4.5 billion. If the projected synergies are $1.48 billion, what is the maximum exchange 
ratio NFF could offer in a stock swap and still generate a positive NPV?
	
14.	 Let’s reconsider part (b) of Problem 9. The actual premium that your company will pay for 
­TargetCo will not be 20%, because on the announcement the target price will go up and your 
price will go down to reflect the fact that you are willing to pay a premium for TargetCo. 
Assume that the takeover will occur with certainty and all market participants know this on the 
announcement of the takeover.
a.	 What is the price per share of the combined corporation immediately after the merger is 
completed?
b.	 What is the price of your company immediately after the announcement?

c.	 What is the price of TargetCo immediately after the announcement?
d.	What is the actual premium your company will pay?
	
15.	 ABC has 1 million shares outstanding, each of which has a price of $25. It has made a takeover 
offer of XYZ Corporation, which has 1 million shares outstanding and a price per share of 
$2.59. Assume that the takeover will occur with certainty and all market participants know this. 
Furthermore, there are no synergies to merging the two firms.
a.	 Assume ABC made a cash offer to purchase XYZ for $4 million. What happens to the price 
of ABC and XYZ on the announcement? What premium over the current market price does 
this offer represent?
b.	 Assume ABC makes a stock offer with an exchange ratio of 0.16. What happens to the price 
of ABC and XYZ this time? What premium over the current market price does this offer 
represent?
c.	 At current market prices, both offers are offers to purchase XYZ for $4 million. Does that 
mean that your answers to parts (a) and (b) must be identical? Explain.
Takeover Defenses
	
16.	 BAD Company’s stock price is $30, and it has 2 million shares outstanding. You believe you 
can increase the company’s value if you buy it and replace the management. Assume that BAD 
has a poison pill with a 15% trigger. If it is triggered, all BAD’s shareholders—other than the 
acquirer—will be able to buy one new share in BAD for each share they own at an 80% discount. 
Assume that the price remains at $30 while you are acquiring your shares. If BAD’s management 
decides to resist your buyout attempt and you cross the 15% threshold of ownership:
a.	 How many new shares will be issued and at what price?
b.	 What will happen to your percentage ownership of BAD?
c.	 What will happen to the price of your shares of BAD?
d.	Do you lose or gain from triggering the poison pill? If you lose, where does the loss go (who

Corporate governance
the tUrN OF the tWeNtY-FIrSt CeNtUrY WItNeSSeD scandaLs 
and corporate fraud in the United States. The names of once well-respected compa-
nies like Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and Adelphia filled the news. Enron, with stock worth 
$68 billion at its peak, became almost worthless in a matter of months, wiping out the 
retirement savings of thousands of employees and other stockholders. The story at 
WorldCom was similar. The once high-flying stock peaked at a market value of $115 
billion after a string of acquisitions that included well-known phone company MCI. In 
2002, WorldCom filed what was at the time the largest bankruptcy ever. After building 
one of the nation’s largest cable companies from scratch, the Rigas family of Adelphia 
was forced to endure the indignity of watching their own cable system convey the image 
of Adelphia’s demise into millions of homes.
The common theme among these companies is the accusation of fraud, perpe-
trated by the manipulation of accounting statements. Shareholders, analysts, and regu-
lators were kept in the dark as the companies’ financial situations became ever more 
precarious, resulting, in the end, in total collapse. How did this happen? Aren’t manag-
ers supposed to act in the interests of shareholders? Why did auditors go along with 
the fraud? Where were the boards of directors when all of this was happening?
There is an opportunity cost to bad governance; thus, by ­replacing bad gover-
nance with good governance, it is possible to increase firm value—in other words, good 
governance is a positive-NPV project. Hence, we begin by discussing various gover-
nance mechanisms that are designed to mitigate the agency conflicts between man-
agers and owners. These agency conflicts cannot be removed completely by a firm’s 
governance mechanisms, so we next discuss regulations that are designed to prohibit 
managers from taking certain acts that are not in the interests of shareholders. We 
conclude the chapter with a discussion of corporate governance around the world.

Chapter 29  Corporate Governance
	
29.1	 Corporate Governance and Agency Costs
Any discussion of corporate governance—the system of controls, regulations, and 
­incentives designed to prevent fraud—is a story of conflicts of interest and attempts to 
­minimize them. As we saw in Chapter 16, the different stakeholders in a firm all have their 
own interests. When those interests diverge, we may have agency conflicts. That chapter 
emphasized the sources of conflicts between bondholders and shareholders. In this chapter, 
we focus on the conflicts between managers and investors.
The conflict of interest between managers and investors derives from the separation of 
ownership and control in a corporation. As we pointed out in Chapter 1, the separation of 
ownership and control is perhaps the most important reason for the success of the corpo-
rate organizational form. Because any investor can hold an ownership stake in a corpora-
tion, investors are able to diversify and thus reduce their risk exposures without cost. This is 
especially true for the managers of a corporation: Because they are not also required to own 
the firm, their risk exposures are much lower than they would be if ownership and control 
were not separate.
Once control and ownership are separated, however, a conflict of interest arises 
between the owners and the people in control of a corporation. For example, in 
­Chapter 28, we talked about mergers that are motivated by managers’ desire to man-
age a larger firm, gaining them more prestige and greater pay, even if that might not be 
in the best interests of shareholders. Other examples of agency problems are excessive 
­perquisites, such as using corporate jets for family vacations, or managers not working 
as diligently as they would if it were their own business. Agency conflicts are likely to 
arise any time the manager does not internalize the full cost of his or her actions—just 
think about how you order at a ­restaurant when you are paying compared to when the 
­company is paying!
The seriousness of this conflict of interest depends on how closely aligned the interests 
of the managers and shareholders are. Aligning their interests comes at a cost—it increases 
the risk exposure of the managers. For example, tying managerial compensation to perfor-
mance aligns managers’ incentives with investors’ interests, but then managers are exposed 
to the firm’s risk (because the firm might do poorly for reasons unrelated to the manager’s 
performance).
The role of the corporate governance system is to mitigate the conflict of interest that 
results from the separation of ownership and control without unduly burdening managers 
with the risk of the firm. The system attempts to align these interests by providing incen-
tives for taking the right action and punishments for taking the wrong action. The incen-
tives come from owning stock in the company and from compensation that is sensitive 
to performance. Punishment comes when a board fires a manager for poor performance 
or fraud, or when, upon failure of the board to act, shareholders or raiders launch control 
contests to replace the board and management. As we will see, these actions interact in 
complicated ways. For example, as a manager owns more stock in the firm, his incentives 
become better aligned, but, in addition to the increase in risk the manager must bear, the 
manager also becomes harder to fire because the block of stock gives him significant voting 
rights.
Let’s now take a closer look at the components of the corporate governance system.

29.2  Monitoring by the Board of Directors and Others

29.2	 Monitoring by the Board of Directors and Others
At first glance, one might think that there is a simple solution to the conflict of interest 
problem: monitor the firm’s managers closely. The problem with this reasoning is that 
it ignores the cost of monitoring. When the ownership of a corporation is widely held, 
no one shareholder has an incentive to bear this cost (because she bears the full cost of 
­monitoring but the benefit is divided among all shareholders). Instead, the shareholders as 
a group elect a board of directors to monitor managers. The directors themselves, however, 
have the same conflict of interest—monitoring is costly and in many cases directors do not 
get significantly greater benefits than other shareholders from monitoring the managers 
closely. Consequently, in most cases, shareholders understand that there are reasonable 
limits on how much monitoring they can expect from the board of directors.
In principle, the board of directors hires the executive team, sets its compensation, 
approves major investments and acquisitions, and dismisses executives if necessary. In the 
United States, the board of directors has a clear fiduciary duty to protect the interests of 
the owners of the firm—the shareholders. Most other countries give some weight to the 
interests of other stakeholders in the firm, such as the employees. In Germany, this concept 
is formalized through a two-tier board structure that gives half of the seats on the upper 
board—called the supervisory board—to employees.
Types of Directors
Generally, researchers have categorized directors into three groups: inside, gray, and 
­outside (or independent). Inside directors are employees, former employees, or family 
members of employees. Gray directors are people who are not as directly connected to the 
firm as insiders are, but who have existing or potential business relationships with the firm. 
For example, bankers, lawyers, and consultants who are already retained by the firm or 
who would be interested in being retained may sit on a board. Thus, their judgment could 
be compromised by their desire to keep the CEO happy. Finally, all other directors are 
considered outside (or independent) directors and are the most likely to make decisions 
solely in the interests of the shareholders.
Board Independence
Researchers have hypothesized that boards with a majority of outside directors are better 
monitors of managerial effort and actions. One early study showed that a board was more 
likely to fire the firm’s CEO for poor performance if the board had a majority of outside 
directors.1 Other studies have found that firms with independent boards make fewer 
­value-destroying acquisitions and are more likely to act in shareholders’ interests if targeted 
in an acquisition.2

boards award directors more equity-based compensation, increasing incentives for the board to moni-
tor. (“Who Is in Whose Pocket? Director Compensation, Board Independence, and Barriers to Effective

Chapter 29  Corporate Governance
Despite evidence that board independence matters for major activities such as firing 
CEOs and making corporate acquisitions, researchers have struggled to find a connection 
between board structure and firm performance. Although the firm’s stock price increases 
on the announcement of its addition of an independent board member, the increased 
firm value appears to come from the potential for the board to make better decisions on 
acquisitions and CEO turnover rather than from improvements in the firm’s operating 
performance. Researchers have argued, however, that so many other factors affect firm 
performance that the effect of a more or less independent board is very difficult to detect.
Another reason why it may be difficult to explicate a relationship between board 
­independence and firm performance is the nature of the role of the independent director. 
On a board composed of insider, gray, and independent directors, the role of the inde-
pendent director is really that of a watchdog. But because independent directors’ personal 
wealth is likely to be less sensitive to performance than that of insider and gray ­directors, 
they have less incentive to closely monitor the firm. However, there has been a trend toward 
more equity-based pay for outside directors. As recently as the early 1990s, it was very 
common for directors to be paid a fixed annual cash fee plus perhaps an extra nominal fee 
per meeting attended. It is now standard for outside directors to be granted shares of stock 
and/or options to more closely align their interests with those of the shareholders they serve.
Incentives notwithstanding, even the most active independent directors spend only one 
or two days per month on firm business, and many independent directors sit on multiple 
boards, further dividing their attention. In fact, some studies have found value decreases 
when too many of a board’s directors are “busy,” meaning that they sit on three or more 
boards.3
A board is said to be captured when its monitoring duties have been compromised 
by connections or perceived loyalties to management. Theoretical and empirical research 
­support the notion that the longer a CEO has served, especially when that person is also 
chairman of the board, the more likely the board is to become captured. Over time, most 
of the independent directors will have been nominated by the CEO. Even though they 
have no business ties to the firm, they are still likely to be friends or at least acquaintances 
of the CEO. The CEO can be expected to stack the board with directors who are less likely 
to challenge her. When the CEO is also chairman of the board, the nominating letter 
offering a seat to a new director comes from her. This process merely serves to reinforce 
the sense that the outside directors owe their positions to the CEO and work for the CEO 
rather than for the shareholders.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX), which we discuss in more depth in ­Section 29.5, 
required that the audit committee of the board, charged with overseeing the audit of the 
firm’s financial statements, be composed entirely of independent directors. Following the 
implementation of SOX, major U.S. exchanges (NYSE and NASDAQ) changed their 
listing requirements such that firms listed on those exchanges must have a majority of 
independent directors on their board. Most recently, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 further 
requires that all members of a firm’s compensation committee be independent board mem-
bers. Ideally, these changes will reduce entrenchment and improve governance. However, 
all such changes come at a cost, because the other major role of the board is to advise man-
agers on strategic issues. Independent directors, while unbiased, are also the least likely to 
be experts in the firm’s business, thus reducing their ability to advise.

Board Size and Performance
Researchers have found the surprisingly robust result that smaller boards are associated 
with greater firm value and performance.4 The likely explanation for this phenomenon 
comes from the psychology and sociology research, which finds that smaller groups make 
better decisions than larger groups. Most firms that have just gone public either as young 
companies or as older firms returning to public status after a leveraged buyout (LBO) 
choose to start with smaller boards. Boards tend to grow over time as members are added 
for various reasons. For example, boards are often expanded by one or two seats after an 
acquisition to accommodate the target CEO and perhaps one other target director.
Other Monitors
The board is complemented by other monitors, both inside and outside the firm. We 
­discuss direct shareholder monitoring and action in Section  29.4, but other monitors 
include security analysts, lenders, the SEC, and employees within the firm itself.
Securities analysts produce independent valuations of the firms they cover so that they 
can make buy and sell recommendations to clients. They collect as much information as 
they can, becoming an expert on the firm and its competitors by poring over a company’s 
financial statements and filings. As a result, they are in a position to uncover ­irregularities 
first. Analysts often ask difficult and probing questions of CEOs and CFOs during 
­quarterly earnings releases. Anyone can listen to these conference calls, which are typically 
simulcast on the company’s investor relations Web site.
Lenders also carefully monitor firms to which they are exposed as creditors. Loans and 
lines of credit also contain financial covenants designed to provide early warning signs of 
trouble. These covenants, such as requiring maintenance of a certain quick ratio or profit-
ability level, are primarily designed to capture the firm’s ability to repay the loan. None-
theless, they complement other signals of potential governance problems. A stockholder 
must keep in mind, however, that her interests are not perfectly aligned with the creditors’ 
interests. The creditor, lacking upside participation, is particularly interested in minimizing 
risk, even at the expense of some positive-NPV projects.
Employees of the firm are most likely to detect outright fraud because of their inside 
knowledge. However, they do not always have strong incentives to report the fraud. They 
may personally benefit from the fraud, or they may fear retribution from “blowing the 
whistle.” Some states have whistle-blower statutes to protect employees who report fraud 
to the authorities; there are federal statutes to protect employees who expose fraud against 
the U.S. government.
The SEC is charged with the task of protecting the investing public against fraud and 
stock price manipulation. But while the SEC’s enforcement powers are extensive and carry 
with them the weight of criminal prosecution, its detection resources are limited. Out of 
necessity, the SEC must rely on the array of other monitors, each with vested interests in 
detecting governance problems, to alert it to potential wrongdoing.

Chapter 29  Corporate Governance
	
29.3	 Compensation Policies
In the absence of monitoring, the other way the conflict of interest between managers 
and owners can be mitigated is by closely aligning their interests through the managers’ 
compensation policy. That is, by tying compensation to performance, the shareholders 
effectively give the manager an ownership stake in the firm.
Stock and Options
Managers’ pay can be linked to the performance of a firm in many ways. The most basic 
approach is through bonuses based on, for example, earnings growth. During the 1990s, most 
companies adopted compensation policies that more directly gave managers an ownership stake 
by including grants of stock or stock options to executives. These grants give managers a direct 
incentive to increase the stock price to make their stock or options as valuable as possible. Con-
sequently, stock and option grants naturally tie managerial wealth to the wealth of shareholders.
Many studies have examined firms’ compensation policies. One of the earlier studies 
examined the sensitivity of managers’ compensation to the performance of their firms.5 
The authors found that for every $1000 increase in firm value, CEO pay changed, on aver-
age, by $3.25. Most of this increase came from changes in the value of their stock ­ownership 
($2). The rest was driven by options, bonuses, and other compensation changes. The 
authors of the study argued that this seemed too small a sensitivity to provide managers 
with the proper incentives to exert extra effort on the behalf of shareholders. Recall, how-
ever, that increasing the pay-for-performance sensitivity comes at the cost of burdening 
managers with risk. As a consequence, the optimal level of sensitivity depends on the 
­managers’ level of risk aversion, which is hard to measure.
Pay and Performance Sensitivity

1990s. As the figure shows, median cash pay, consisting of salary and bonuses, has

fluctuated only moderately. The climb in CEO total compensation has been driven instead 
by the sharp increase in the value of stock, options, and deferred compensation granted 
each year. The median value of options granted rose from less than $200,000 in 1993 to 
more than $1 million by 2001. Not surprisingly, the substantial use of stock and option 
grants in the 1990s greatly increased managers’ pay-for-performance sensitivity. Conse-
quently, subsequent estimates put this sensitivity at $25 per $1000 change in wealth.6 
While the value of stock and option grants have fluctuated in the 2000s with the perfor-
mance of the overall stock market, there appears to have been some substitution toward 
deferred compensation and retirement packages, with median amounts exceeding $2 mil-
lion in 2014. 
Besides increasing managers’ risk exposure, increasing the sensitivity of managerial pay 
and wealth to firm performance has some other negative effects. For example, often options 
are granted “at the money,” meaning that the exercise price is equal to the current stock 
price. Therefore, managers have an incentive to manipulate the release of financial forecasts 
so that bad news comes out before options are granted (to drive the exercise price down) 
and good news comes out after options are granted. Studies have found evidence that the 
practice of timing the release of information to maximize the value of CEO stock options 
is widespread.7
More recently, Professor Erik Lie has found evidence suggesting that many executives 
have engaged in a more direct form of manipulating their stock option compensation: 
backdating their option grants.8 Backdating refers to the practice of choosing the grant 
date of a stock option retroactively, so that the date of the grant would coincide with a date 
when the stock price was at its low for the quarter or for the year. By backdating the option 
in this way, the executive receives a stock option that is already in-the-money, with a strike 
price equal to the lower price on the supposed grant date.
The use of backdating suggests that some executive stock option compensation may not 
truly have been earned as the result of good future performance of the firm. Furthermore, 
unless it is reported in a timely manner to the IRS and to shareholders, and reflected in 
the firm’s financial statements, backdating is illegal. In mid-2006, SEC and U.S. Justice 
Department investigations into alleged backdating were ongoing for more than 70 firms. 
New SEC rules require firms to report option grants within two days of the grant date, 
which may help prevent further abuses.

Chapter 29  Corporate Governance
	
29.4	 Managing Agency Conflict
Even with the risk benefits of separating ownership and control, there are still examples of 
corporations in which the top managers have substantial ownership interests (for example, 
Microsoft Corporation). One might conjecture that such corporations have suffered less 
from the conflict of interest between managers and shareholders.
Academic studies have supported the notion that greater managerial ownership is associ-
ated with fewer value-reducing actions by managers.9 But while increasing managerial owner-
ship may reduce perquisite consumption, it also makes managers harder to fire—thus 
reducing the incentive effect of the threat of dismissal. Therefore, the relationship between 
managerial ownership and firm value is unlikely to be the same for every firm, or even for 
different executives of the same firm. Shareholders will use all of the tools at their disposal to 
manage the agency conflict. Thus, if managers have small ownership stakes, shareholders may 
use compensation policies or a stronger board to create the desired incentives. Harold Dem-
setz and Kenneth Lehn argue that if you look at a group of firms at any time, you should not 
necessarily see any relationship between ownership and value, unless you are able to control 
for all of the other, sometimes unobservable, parts of the governance system, including the 
risk aversion of the manager.10 More recent studies have supported their position.11
Direct Action by Shareholders
If all else fails, the shareholders’ last line of defense against expropriation by self-interested 
managers is direct action. Recall that shareholders elect the board of directors. Typically, 
these elections look like those in the former Soviet Union—there is only one slate of candi-
dates and you vote “yes” or “no” for the slate as a whole. When shareholders are angry 
about the management of the company and frustrated by a board unwilling to take action, 
however, they have at their disposal a variety of options for expressing that displeasure.
Shareholder Voice.  First, any shareholder can submit a resolution that is put to a vote at the 
annual meeting. A resolution could direct the board to take a specific action, such as discon-
tinue investing in a particular line of business or country, or remove a poison pill. Such reso-
lutions rarely receive majority support, but if large shareholders back them, they can be 
embarrassing for the board. Studies show that the market responds positively when such 
resolutions are adopted, presumably indicating that they positively impact the ­governance of 
firms.12 Some large public pension funds, such as the California Public Employees Retire-
ment System (CalPERS), take an activist role in corporate governance. Typically, these funds 
target firms that are taking actions without considering the concerns of the stockholders; for 
example, they may privately approach the board of the firm and ask it to reverse its course.

The explicit threat at that stage is that if the board fails to comply, the pension fund will put 
the issue to a shareholder vote. Studies have reported that such activist investors are usually 
successful in achieving their goals without having to take matters public.13 Such activism has 
been very effective, for example, in removing poison pills and other defenses designed to 
entrench management (see Figure 28.3 on page 1012).
Recently, shareholders have started organizing “no” votes. That is, when they are dis-
satisfied with a board, they simply refuse to vote to approve the slate of nominees for 
the board. The most high-profile example of this type of action occurred in 2004 with 
the Walt Disney Company. Major shareholders were dissatisfied with the recent perfor-
mance of Disney under long-time CEO and Chairman Michael Eisner. They began an 
organized campaign to convince the majority of Disney shareholders to withhold their 
approval of the reelection of Eisner as director and chairman of the board. When the votes 
were counted, 45% of Disney’s shareholders had voted to withhold approval of Eisner. 
While Eisner technically had won reelection, a 45% “no” vote is practically unprecedented 
in large public companies. The signal was clear, and an embarrassed Eisner and the Disney 
board decided that Eisner would remain CEO, but relinquish the chairman title. Shortly 
thereafter, Eisner announced plans to retire completely in 2006.
Shareholder Approval.  In addition to electing the directors of the company, ­shareholders 
must approve many major actions taken by the board. For example, target shareholders 
must approve merger agreements and, in some cases, so must bidder shareholders. Even 
in cases where bidder shareholders are not required to approve a merger directly, listing 
requirements on the NYSE, for example, demand that shareholders approve any large issue 
of new shares, such as might be necessary in a stock-swap merger. Normally, approval is 
perfunctory, but it cannot be taken for granted. As we saw in Chapter 28, after Hewlett-
Packard CEO Carly Fiorina negotiated the merger of HP and Compaq, the Hewlett ­family 
used their board seats and voting block to oppose the deal.
A recent movement, which gained momentum and regulators’ interest during the 2008 
financial crisis, is to let shareholders have a “say on pay,” vote. Typically, this is a nonbinding 
vote to approve or disapprove of the compensation plan for senior executives each year. 
Even though the votes are nonbinding, firms that narrowly passed shareholder resolutions

Shareholder Activism at The New York Times
New York Times Co., publisher of The New York Times, is 
closely controlled by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which 
owns most of the Class B voting shares, allowing it to 
elect 70% of the board members. However, in December 
2007 and January 2008, two hedge funds working together 
started acquiring a large stake in the publicly traded Class 
A shares. The two funds, Harbinger Capital Partners and 
Firebrand Partners, initially acquired 5% of the shares, sub-
sequently raising the stake to 19%. The funds also filed to 
nominate four dissident directors to the NYT Co. board, 
arguing that the Times was moving too slowly to develop 
digital content and should shed non-core assets. After ini-
tially resisting, the Company agreed to accept two of the 
funds’ nominees and the funds withdrew their competing 
proxy statement. Over the two-month period starting when 
the funds began their activism, the stock price of the Com-
pany increased by close to 30%. This episode is indicative 
of two emerging trends in investor activism: hedge funds 
taking a more activist role and working in concert to effect 
change at a company, and an increased willingness of tar-
geted companies to negotiate a settlement with activists (see 
Figure 29.2).

requiring say on pay votes subsequently saw their stock prices increase in response (relative 
to firms that narrowly rejected such resolutions).14
In 2010 the Dodd-Frank Act required advisory votes of shareholders on executive pay for all 
large U.S. corporations. While shareholders do tend to support executive pay packages— 
voting them down a mere 8% of the time in 2011—firms with poor performance or unusually 
high executive pay are more likely to see their compensation proposals rejected by shareholders.15
Proxy Contests.  Perhaps the most extreme form of direct action that disgruntled sharehold-
ers can take is to hold a proxy contest and introduce a rival slate of directors for election to the 
board (see Figure 29.2). This action gives shareholders an actual choice between the nominees 
put forth by management and the current board and a completely different slate of nominees 
put forth by dissident shareholders. 
For example, in February 2008 Microsoft made an unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo! for 
$31 per share. While many shareholders supported the offer, which represented a 60% pre-
mium to its stock price, Yahoo!’s management and board of directors resisted and Micro-
soft eventually withdrew its offer that May. Immediately thereafter, dissident Carl Icahn 
launched an effort aimed at replacing Yahoo!’s board via a proxy contest. Yahoo! settled the 
contest in July by agreeing to give board seats to Icahn and two of his supporters.
Perhaps because proxy fights can push management to take needed action, one early 
study of proxy contests found that the announcement of a contest increased firm stock 
price by 8% on average, even if the challenge was eventually unsuccessful and the incum-
bents won reelection.16
Management Entrenchment
Given the importance of shareholder action in corporate governance, researchers and large 
investors alike have become increasingly interested in measuring the balance of power 
between shareholders and managers in a firm. Over time, the tools that managers can use to

entrench themselves have evolved, including antitakeover protections such as those discussed 
in Chapter 28. The Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) has collected informa-
tion on 24 different characteristics that can entrench, or give more power, to managers vis-à-
vis shareholders. These provisions include state antitakeover statutes, poison pills, staggered 
boards, and restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings themselves.
Researchers have begun using data from the IRRC as a way of measuring how entrenched 
managers are. One study found that firms with more restrictions on shareholder power 
performed worse than firms with fewer restrictions during the 1990s.17 Other studies have 
found connections between the degree of entrenchment and the compensation offered to 
managers, and even to the value of acquisitions made.18 While the index offered by the 
IRRC does not capture every aspect of corporate governance, many practitioners are 
­finding it to be a useful summary measure of the degree to which managers are entrenched 
and less likely to have their actions checked by shareholders.
The Threat of Takeover
Many of the provisions listed in the IRRC index concern protection from takeovers. As we dis-
cussed in Chapter 28, one motivation for a takeover can be to replace poorly performing man-
agement. When internal governance systems such as ownership, compensation, board oversight, 
and shareholder activism fail, the one remaining way to remove poorly performing managers is 
by mounting a hostile takeover. Thus, the effectiveness of the corporate governance structure 
of a firm depends on how well protected its managers are from removal in a hostile takeover.
An active takeover market is part of the system through which the threat of dismissal is 
maintained. In fact, some research has suggested that an active takeover market complements 
a board’s own vigilance in dismissing incompetent managers. That research found that boards 
are actually more likely to fire managers for poor performance during active takeover markets 
than they are during lulls in takeover activity.19 This finding also has implications internation-
ally because some countries have much more active takeover markets than others. In particu-
lar, hostile takeovers are far more common in the United States than in other countries.

So far, we’ve focused on those parts of the corporate governance system that have evolved 
over time as economic responses to the need for shareholders to mitigate the conflict of 
interest between themselves and managers. For example, boards of directors came into

Chapter 29  Corporate Governance
have long appointed independent directors to their boards without being required to do 
so. Nonetheless, from time to time, government has added to existing requirements by 
passing laws that force minimum standards of governance. Recent examples include the 
­Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.
In the wake of the massive failures of large public companies and corporate fraud scan-
dals in the early 2000s mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Congress rushed to 
enact legislation to fix what it saw as inadequate safeguards against malfeasance by manag-
ers of public corporations. The result was the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Prior to SOX, the larg-
est overhaul of securities markets and introduction of regulation came in response to the 
stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. The Exchange Acts of 
1933 and 1934, among other things, established the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) and prohibited trading on private information gained as an insider of a firm.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act
One of the most critical inputs to the monitoring process is accurate information. If a 
board of directors has inaccurate information, it cannot do its job. While SOX contains 
many provisions, the overall intent of the legislation was to improve the accuracy of infor-
mation given to both boards and to shareholders. SOX attempted to achieve this goal 
in three ways: (1) by overhauling incentives and independence in the auditing process,  
(2) by stiffening penalties for providing false information, and (3) by forcing companies to 
­validate their internal financial control processes.
Many of the problems at Enron, WorldCom, and elsewhere were kept hidden from 
boards and shareholders until it was too late. In the wake of these scandals, many people 
felt that the accounting statements of these companies, while often remaining true to the 
letter of GAAP, did not present an accurate picture of the financial health of the company.
Auditing firms are supposed to ensure that a company’s financial statements accurately 
reflect the financial state of the firm. In reality, most auditors have a long–standing relation-
ship with their audit clients; this extended relationship and the auditors’ desire to keep the 
lucrative auditing fees makes auditors less willing to challenge management. More important 
perhaps, most accounting firms have developed large and extremely profitable consulting 
divisions. Obviously, if an audit team refuses to accommodate a request by a ­client’s man-
agement, that client will be less likely to choose the accounting firm’s consulting ­division 
for its next consulting contract. SOX addressed this concern by putting strict limits on the 
amount of non-audit fees (consulting or otherwise) that an accounting firm can earn from 
the same firm that it audits. It also required that audit partners rotate every five years to limit 
the likelihood that auditing relationships become too cozy over long periods of time. Finally, 
SOX called on the SEC to force companies to have audit committees that are dominated by 
outside directors and required that at least one outside director have a financial background.
SOX also stiffened the criminal penalties for providing false information to sharehold-
ers. It required both the CEO and the CFO to personally attest to the accuracy of the 
financial statements presented to shareholders and to sign a statement to that effect. Pen-
alties for providing false or misleading financial statements were increased under SOX—
fines of as much as $5 million and imprisonment of a maximum of 20 years are permitted. 
Furthermore, CEOs and CFOs must return bonuses or profits from the sale of stock or the 
exercise of options during any period covered by statements that are later restated.
Finally, Section 404 of SOX requires senior management and the boards of public com-
panies to be comfortable enough with the process through which funds are allocated and 
controlled, and outcomes monitored throughout the firm, to be willing to attest to their 
effectiveness and validity. Section 404 has arguably garnered more attention than any other

Securities and Exchange Commission 
from 2002 to 2004, Dr. Lawrence 
E. Harris was the primary advisor to 
the SEC on all economic issues. He 
participated extensively in the devel-
opment of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) 
regulations. Currently Dr. ­Harris holds 
the Fred V. Keenan Chair in Finance 
at the University of ­Southern Califor-
nia’s Marshall School of Business.
QUESTION: Why is legislation such 
as Sarbanes-Oxley necessary to ­protect 
shareholders?
ANSWER: Public investors will sup-
ply capital to entrepreneurs seeking 
to fund new business ventures only 
if they believe it will be used wisely. 
Regrettably, history has shown that 
management too often has violated 
that trust.
The interests of managers and shareholders often con-
flict. To solve this agency problem, shareholders rely upon 
information produced by corporate accounting systems. 
Sarbanes-Oxley mandated accounting and audit standards 
to improve the quality of corporate financial disclosure.
Opponents of governance regulation believe that 
shareholders can—and should—take care of themselves. 
Unfortunately, shareholders often cannot exercise the con-
trol necessary to solve agency problems that they could 
not have anticipated when the firm was first founded. The 
firm’s governance structure, which may have been sensible 
when the firm was a small company funded primarily by its 
founders, may no longer be appropriate for a large, widely 
held corporation operating in the modern economy. Man-
agement with little ownership stake may be entrenched, 
and the directors may be conflicted. When shareholders 
cannot solve their agency problems, the government must 
intervene with the lightest possible hand.
QUESTION: What are the costs and benefits of 
Sarbanes-Oxley?
ANSWER: Good corporate disclosure is essential to pub-
lic finance. SOX improved the quality of disclosure by 
strengthening accounting and auditing standards. By 
requiring the CEO and CFO to sign accounts and attest 
to their accuracy, SOX also put teeth into enforcement if 
fraud is discovered.
What many people perceive as 
costs of SOX are really expendi-
tures that weak firms avoided. All 
well-managed firms must ensure 
the integrity of their accounting. 
SOX merely requires that people 
adopt existing best practice. Many 
companies were already fully com-
pliant with SOX in most essential 
respects.
Critics claim that SOX made 
going public more difficult for 
small firms by increasing the cost 
of being a public firm. But a pub-
lic firm must have secure control 
mechanisms to protect sharehold-
ers. SOX may decrease the number 
of firms that go public, but it will 
also decrease the losses suffered by 
public investors.
SOX established the Public Cor-
poration Auditing Oversight Board 
(PCAOB) to regulate auditors. 
Previous efforts at self-regulation failed because accountants 
would not discipline their peers. Following numerous nota-
ble failures, Congress stepped in and created the PCAOB.
QUESTION: Is SOX a good law?
ANSWER: Regulators are blamed for failing to regulate when 
crises occur, but they do not bear the costs of their regula-
tions. This asymmetry often causes them to underestimate 
the costs of their regulations and thus adopt unnecessary 
regulations. The problem is greatest when political consider-
ations force Congress to write regulations that would be bet-
ter written by well-informed specialists in regulatory agencies 
such as the SEC. Congress wrote SOX in response to the 
financial accounting crises that greatly offended the public. 
Although SOX permits the SEC to essentially rewrite any 
provision that it determines not to be in the public interest, 
under the circumstances, it could not do so.
SOX is generally good regulation, but it has some 
notable unintended consequences. The power it gives audit 
firms over their corporate clients allows them to interpret 
SOX to their advantage and thereby increase the work nec-
essary to comply with SOX. SOX also imposes unnecessary 
costs upon mutual funds. Investment companies are subject 
to SOX because they are public corporations, but they 
do not face the same accounting problems that operating 
companies face. In its haste to appease the public, Congress 
failed to be as discriminating as it could have been.

section in SOX because of the potentially enormous burden it places on every firm to vali-
date its entire financial control system. When the SEC estimated the cost of implementing 
Section 404, its staff economists put the total cost at $1.24 billion. Recent estimates based 
on surveys by Financial Executives International and the American Electronics Association 
predict that the actual cost will be between $20 billion and $35 billion.20 The burden of 
complying with this provision is greater, as a fraction of revenue, for smaller companies. 
The surveys cited earlier found that multibillion-dollar companies will pay less than 0.05% 
of their revenues to comply, whereas small companies with less than $20 million in ­revenues 
will pay more than 3% of their revenues to comply.
The Cadbury Commission
It is difficult to determine definitively whether the costs of SOX outweigh its benefits: Even 
if we could measure the total direct and indirect costs of a law, we could never ­accurately 
estimate how much fraud is deterred by that law. One place to turn to for guidance is 
the experiences of other countries. The following quote from The Independent21 sounds like 
it was written to describe the motivation behind the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation:
Prompted by public concern over a string of unexpected collapses of recently audited firms and 
over big rises in executive pay, exchanges and public officials rode a wave of public outrage 
to institute corporate governance reforms to strengthen the independence of the board and 
address the conflicts of interest in the auditing process.
In actuality, this passage was written in 1992, and it described what happened in the 
United Kingdom in 1991. Following the collapse of some large public companies, the U.K. 
government commissioned Sir Adrian Cadbury to form a committee to develop a code of 
best practices in corporate governance. Sir Cadbury, in introducing his ­recommendations, 
reportedly said the following:
The fundamental issue is one of pressure. There is pressure on the company to show the results 
that the market expects. There is pressure on the auditors who don’t want to lose their jobs. 
The question is whether a structure can emerge out of the dialogue which is robust enough 
to give the shareholders what they ought to get and what they can rely upon. Internal controls 
are a part of the legitimate expectations of those who receive accounts.22
The problems that the Cadbury Commission identified are the same as those that SOX 
attempted to address in the United States 10 years later. Perhaps not surprisingly, the resulting 
recommendations were quite similar as well. According to the commission’s findings, audit 
and compensation committees should be made up entirely of independent directors or, at 
least, have a majority of them. The CEO should not be chairman of the board, and at the very 
least there should be a lead independent director with similar agenda-setting powers. Auditors 
should be rotated, and there should be fuller disclosure of non-audit work. Unlike SOX, these 
recommendations were not backed up by the force of law. Rather, companies could adopt 
them or instead explain why they chose not to adopt them in their annual reports. Some 
researchers have studied firms that adopted the Cadbury recommendations versus those that

did not. The results are mixed. While one study found that those firms that separated the 
position of CEO and chairman performed better, another found no relation between the 
independence of key board committees and firm performance in the post-Cadbury era.23
Dodd-Frank Act
As the previous cases illustrate, regulatory change is often prompted by crisis.  As we explained 
in Chapter 1, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 was spurred by the 2008 financial crisis. Many 
people believed that poor corporate governance was an important factor that contributed to 
the crisis and so the act has numerous clauses designed to strengthen governance, including:
n	 Independent Compensation Committee:  All U.S. exchanges must require that the 
listed firms’ compensation committees be composed of only independent board mem-
bers, and have the authority to hire outside compensation consultants.
n	 Nominating Directors:  Large shareholders owning at least 3% of a company’s stock 
for at least three years may nominate candidates for the board of directors, with the 
candidates listed on the firm’s proxy statement alongside the nominees of management.
n	 Vote on Executive Pay and Golden Parachutes:  At least once every three years, firms 
must provide shareholders with a nonbinding vote on the compensation of the firm’s 
CEO, CFO, and the three other most highly paid executives. While the vote is non-
binding, companies must formally respond regarding how they have taken into account 
the results of the vote.
n	 Clawback Provisions:  Public companies must establish policies that allow firms 
to take back up to three years of any executive incentive compensation erroneously 
awarded in the event of an accounting restatement.
n	 Pay Disclosure:  Companies must disclose the ratio of CEO annual total compensa-
tion to that of the median employee. Companies are also required to disclose the rela-
tionship between executive compensation and the firm’s financial performance. Finally, 
firms are required to disclose whether they permit employees and directors to hedge 
against decreases in the market value of the company’s stock.
Insider Trading
One aspect of the conflict of interest between managers and outside shareholders that we 
have not yet addressed is insider trading. Insider trading occurs when a person makes a 
trade based on privileged information. Managers have access to information that outside 
investors do not have. By using this information, managers can exploit profitable trading 
opportunities that are not available to outside investors. If they were allowed to trade on 
their information, their profits would come at the expense of outside investors and, as a 
result, outside investors would be less willing to invest in corporations. Insider trading 
regulation was passed to address this problem.
In the United States, regulation against insider trading traces back to the Great 
­Depression—specifically, to the Exchange Act of 1934. Insiders of a company are defined 
broadly to include managers, directors, and anyone else who has access to material non-
public information, including temporary insiders—for example, lawyers working on a

Whether information is material has been defined in the courts as referring to whether the 
information would have been a significant factor in an investor’s decision about the value 
of the security. Some examples include knowledge of an upcoming merger announcement, 
earnings release, or change in payout policy. The law is especially strict with regard to 
takeover announcements, prohibiting anyone (whether an insider or not) with nonpublic 
information about a pending or ongoing tender offer from trading on that information or 
revealing it to someone who is likely to trade on it.
The penalties for violating insider trading laws include jail time, fines, and civil penal-
ties. Only the U.S. Justice Department—on its own or at the request of the SEC—can 
bring charges that carry the possibility of a prison sentence. However, the SEC can bring 
civil actions if it chooses. In 1984, Congress stiffened the civil penalties for insider trading 
by passing the Insider Trading Sanctions Act, which allowed for civil penalties of up to 
three times the gain from insider trading.

29.6	 Corporate Governance Around the World
Most of our discussion in this chapter has focused on corporate governance in the 
United States. Yet, both the protection of shareholder rights and the basic ownership 
and control structure of corporations vary across countries. We explore some of those 
differences here.
Protection of Shareholder Rights
Recent events notwithstanding, investor protection in the United States is generally seen as 
being among the best in the world. The degree to which investors are protected against 
expropriation of company funds by managers and even the degree to which their rights are 
enforced vary widely across countries and legal regimes. In an important study, researchers 
Martha Stewart and ImClone
One of the most famous insider trading cases involved 
­Martha Stewart, self-made celebrity, billionaire, and CEO of 
a media empire built around her name. Stewart sold 3928 
shares of ImClone Systems in December 2001, just before 
the Food and Drug Administration announced that it was 
rejecting ImClone’s application to review a new cancer 
drug. The SEC investigated, alleging that Stewart sold the 
shares after receiving a tip from her broker that the ImClone 
founder and his family had been selling shares. Even though 
Stewart was not an employee of ImClone, insider trading 
laws prohibited her from trading on information gained 
through a tip, as the origin of the information violated the 
duty of trust. Nonetheless, in the end, Stewart was charged  
only with lying to a federal officer and conspiracy to obstruct 
justice (the investigation of her trades). She was convicted 
and served five months in prison and an additional five 
months of home confinement. In addition, she was fined 
$30,000.
While Stewart’s case made the headlines, it was relatively 
minor by SEC standards. From 2009–2015, the SEC has 
charged over 600 individuals for insider trading, with some 
of those convicted facing penalties exceeding $100 million 
and jail terms of up to 11 years. The largest penalty ever 
imposed was $1.8 billion against hedge fund SAC Capital 
in 2013, with at least 8 individuals at the firm convicted or 
pleading guilty to a series of violations.

collected data on aspects of shareholder rights across more than 30 countries.24 They 
claimed that the degree of investor protection was largely determined by the legal origin of 
the country—specifically, whether its legal system was based on British common law (more 
protection) or French, German, and Scandinavian civil law (less protection). This pur-
ported link between legal origin and investor protection has been challenged by other 
researchers, however, who demonstrate that formal legal protection for investors is a rela-
tively recent development in Great Britain.25 In the late nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries, there was essentially no formal legal protection of minority investors.
Controlling Owners and Pyramids
Much of the focus in the United States is on the agency conflict between shareholders, 
who own the majority of a firm but are a dispersed group, and managers, who own little of 
the firm and must be monitored. In many other countries, the central conflict is between 
what are called “controlling shareholders” and “minority shareholders.” In Europe, many 
corporations are run by families that own controlling blocks of shares. For most practical 
purposes, blocks of shares in excess of 20% are considered to be controlling, as long as no 
one else has any large concentration of shares. The idea is that if you own 20% and the 
other 80% is dispersed among many different shareholders, you will have considerable say 
in the operation of the firm; other shareholders would have to coordinate their activities to 
try to outvote you—a formidable challenge.
In these firms, there is usually little conflict between the controlling family and the 
management (it is often made up of family members). Instead, the conflict arises between 
the minority shareholders (those without the controlling block) and the controlling share-
holders. Controlling shareholders can make decisions that benefit them disproportionately 
relative to the minority shareholders, such as employing family members rather than the 
most talented managers or establishing contracts favorable to other family-controlled firms.
Dual Class Shares and the Value of Control.  One way for families to gain control over 
firms even when they do not own more than half the shares is to issue dual class shares—a 
scenario in which companies have more than one class of shares and one class has supe-
rior voting rights over the other class. For example, Mark Zuckerberg controls more than 
50% of the voting power of Facebook because he controls the majority of Facebook’s class 
B shares, and these shares have ten votes for every one vote of a class A share. Control-
ling shareholders—often families—will hold all or most of the shares with superior voting 
rights and issue the inferior voting class to the public. This approach allows the controlling 
shareholders to raise capital without diluting their control. Dual class shares are common 
in Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, 
and Switzerland. In the United States, they are far less common. Some countries, such as 
Belgium, China, Japan, Singapore, and Spain, outlaw differential voting rights altogether.
Pyramid Structures.  Another way families can control a corporation without owning 
50% of the equity is to create a pyramid structure. In a pyramid structure, a family first 
creates a company in which it owns more than 50% of the shares and therefore has a con-
trolling interest. This company then owns a controlling interest—that is, at least 50% of

Economy 106 (1998): 1113–1155.

Chapter 29  Corporate Governance
the shares—in another company. Notice that the family controls both companies, but owns 
only 25% of the second company. Indeed, if the second company purchased 50% of the 
shares of a third company, then the family would control all three companies, even though 
it would own only 12.5% of the third company. The farther you move down the pyramid 
the less ownership the family has, but it still remains in complete control of all the compa-
nies. Although this example is stylized, a variety of pyramid structures based on this idea 
are quite common outside the United States.
Figure 29.3 details the actual pyramid controlled by the Pesenti family in Italy as of 
1995.26 The Pesenti family effectively controls five companies primarily concentrated 
in the construction industry—Italmobiliare, Italcementi, Franco Tosi, Cementerie 
Siciliane, and Cementerie de Sardegna—even though it does not have more than 50% 
ownership of any one of them. In this case, the family uses a pyramid structure plus 
shares with special voting rights to control companies even when its ownership share is 
as little as 7%.
A controlling family has many opportunities to expropriate minority shareholders in a 
pyramid structure. The source of the problem is that as you move down the pyramid, the 
difference between the family’s control and its cash flow rights increases. Cash flow rights 
refer simply to the family’s direct ownership stake and, therefore, the portion of the cash 
flows generated by the firm that the family has a right to. Notice that Italcementi gets 
74% of the dividends of Cementerie Siciliane; Italmobiliare gets 32% of the dividends of 
Italcementi. Finally, the Pesenti family has rights to 29% of the dividends of Italmobiliare.

and voting rights (which can differ

of numbers (in blue) indicates the 
rights of the preceding company 
one step up the pyramid. The 
second set of numbers (in red) 
shows the effective rights of the 
Pesenti family in that company. 
For example, Italmobiliare controls 
Italcementi through its 54% vot-
ing block, but it owns only 32% of 
the company. The Pesenti family’s 
investment in Italmobiliare gives it a 
10% ownership of Italcementi but, 
because it is controlled by Italmo-
biliare, 45% of the effective voting 
rights in Italcementi.

Thus, the family receives only 29% * 32% * 74% = 7% of the dividends of Cementerie 
Siciliane but still controls it.
A conflict of interest arises because the family has an incentive to try to move profits 
(and hence dividends) up the pyramid—that is, away from companies in which it has few 
cash flow rights and toward firms in which it has more cash flow rights. This process is 
called tunneling. An example of how this might occur is if the Pesenti family would have 
Cementerie Siciliane enter into an agreement to be supplied by Italmobiliare at prices that 
are extremely favorable to Italmobiliare. Such a move would reduce Cementerie Siciliane’s 
profits and increase Italmobiliare’s profits.
Of course, if you are a minority shareholder in one of these subsidiaries, you would 
rationally anticipate this expropriation and so you would pay less for the shares of firms in 
which a family has control, especially if it is low in the pyramid. In effect, you would factor 
in your expected loss from being a minority shareholder rather than a controlling share-
holder. Many studies have confirmed this intuition, finding sharp differences between the 
value of controlling blocks and minority shares.27 Thus, controlling shareholders pay for 
their control rights because the firm effectively faces a higher cost of equity for outside 
capital.
The Stakeholder Model
The agency costs and the ways to control them that we have discussed are general to all 
companies anywhere in the world. However, the United States is somewhat of an exception, 
in that it focuses solely on maximizing shareholder welfare. Most countries follow what is 
called the stakeholder model, giving explicit consideration to other ­stakeholders—in par-
ticular, rank-and-file employees. As noted earlier, countries such as Germany give employees 
board representation. Others have mandated works councils, local versions of labor unions 
that are to be informed and consulted on major corporate decisions. Finally, some coun-
tries mandate employee participation in decision making in their ­constitutions. Table 29.1 
summarizes employee standing in the governance of firms in OECD ­(Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development) countries.
It is important to keep in mind that in countries like the U.S. where other stakehold-
ers are not explicitly considered in the firm’s objective, the interests of these stakeholders 
are not necessarily ignored. Most firms are constrained because they operate in competi-
tive markets. If they mistreat other stakeholders such as employees or customers, these 
27For estimates based on research on mergers and acquisitions, see P. Hanouna, A. Sarin, and A. Shapiro, 
“Value of Corporate Control: Some International Evidence,” SSRN working paper (2004). Estimates of 
the value of control have also been done comparing the value of shares with different voting rights. In 
the United States, see C. Doidge, “U.S. Cross-listings and the Private Benefits of Control: Evidence from 
Dual Class Shares,” Journal of Financial Economics 72(3) (2004): 519–553. Italy is a country where the 
value of control is much larger. Zingales reports a premium of 82% on voting shares, presumably because 
of lower protection to minority investors. See L. Zingales, “The Value of the Voting Right: A Study 
of the Milan Stock Exchange Experience,” Review of Financial Studies 7(1) (1994): 125–148. Other 
work includes H. Almeida and D. Wolfenzon, “A Theory of Pyramidal Ownership and Family Busi-
ness Groups,” Journal of Finance 61(6) (2006): 2637–2680; L. Bebchuk, R. Kraakman, and G. ­Triantis,

stakeholders will be tempted to sever their relationship with the firm. Thus an objective 
that maximizes shareholder value must also implicitly consider stakeholder preferences.
Cross-Holdings
While in the United States it is rare for one company’s largest shareholder to be another 
company, in many countries, such as Germany, Japan, and Korea, it is the norm. In 
Japan, groups of firms connected through cross-holdings and a common relation to a 
bank are known as keiretsu. Monitoring of each company comes from others in the group 
holding blocks of its stock and primarily from the main bank of the group, which as a 
creditor monitors the financial well-being of the group companies closely. In Korea, huge 
conglomerate groups such as Hyundai, Samsung, LG, and SK comprise companies in 
widely diversified lines of business and are known as chaebol. For example, SK Corpora-
tion has subsidiary and group companies in energy, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and tele-
communications. An important difference between the Korean chaebol and the Japanese 
keiretsu is that in Korea the firms do not share a common relationship with a single bank.

29.7	 The Trade-Off of Corporate Governance
Corporate governance is a system of checks and balances that trades off costs and benefits. 
As this chapter makes clear, this trade-off is very complicated. No one structure works for 
all firms. For example, it would be hard to argue that having Bill Gates as a controlling 
shareholder of Microsoft was bad for minority investors. For Microsoft, the alignment of 
incentives assured by Gates’ large stake in Microsoft appeared to outweigh the costs of hav-
ing such an entrenched CEO. In other cases, however, this is unlikely to be true.

The costs and benefits of a corporate governance system also depend on cultural norms. 
Acceptable business practice in one culture is unacceptable in another culture, and thus 
it  is not surprising that there is such wide variation in governance structures across 
countries.28
It is important to keep in mind that good governance is value enhancing and so, in 
­principle, is something investors in the firm should strive for. Because there are many 
ways to implement good governance, one should expect firms to display—and firms do 
display—wide variation in their governance structures.
28Resources that detail how governance differs across the world include J. Charkham, Keeping Good Com-
pany: A Study of Corporate Governance in Five Countries (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1994); J. Franks and 
C. Mayer, “Corporate Ownership and Control in the U.K., Germany and France,” Journal of Applied 
Corporate Finance 9(4) (1997): 30–45; R. La Porta, F. Lopez-de-Silanes, and A. Shleifer, “Corporate Own-

Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
29.1  Corporate Governance and Agency Costs
	
n	 Corporate governance refers to the system of controls, regulations, and incentives designed to 
prevent fraud from happening.
	
n	 The conflicts between those who control the operations of a firm and those who supply capital 
to the firm are as old as the corporate organizational structure. Shareholders use a ­combination 
of incentives and threats of dismissal to mitigate this conflict.
29.2  Monitoring by the Board of Directors and Others
	
n	 The board of directors hires managers, sets their compensation, and fires them if necessary. 
Some boards become captured, meaning that they act in the interests of managers rather than 
shareholders. Boards with strong, outside directors who were nominated before the current 
CEO took the helm of the firm are the least likely to be captured.
29.3  Compensation Policies
	
n	 Ownership of a company’s stock by management can reduce managers’ perquisite ­consumption. 
However, moderate holdings of shares can have a negative effect by making the managers 
harder to fire (reducing the threat of dismissal), without fully aligning their interests with those 
of shareholders.
	
n	 By tying managers’ compensation to firm performance, boards can better align managers’ inter-
ests with shareholders’ interests. Care must be taken to make sure managers do not have incen-
tives to try to manipulate the firm’s stock price to garner a big compensation payout.
29.4  Managing Agency Conflict
	
n	 If a board fails to act, shareholders are not without recourse. They can propose an alternate slate 
of directors or vote not to ratify certain actions of the board.
	
n	 A board and management can adopt provisions, such as staggered boards and limitations on 
special shareholder meetings that serve to entrench them. These provisions also have the effect 
of limiting the efficacy of a hostile takeover bid.

1046	
Chapter 29  Corporate Governance
	
n	 Despite the defenses that a determined management can erect, one source of the threat of dis-
missal comes from a hostile acquirer, which can take over a firm and fire the management, even 
if the board fails to do so.
29.5  Regulation
	
n	 Regulation is an important piece of the total corporate governance environment. Regula-
tion can be beneficial by reducing asymmetric information between managers and capital 
providers and thus reducing the overall cost of capital. Regulation also carries with it costs of 
compliance and enforcement. Good regulation balances these forces to produce a net benefit 
for society.
	
n	 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act was intended to improve shareholder monitoring of managers by 
increasing the accuracy of their information.
n	 It overhauls incentives and independence in the auditing process.
n	 It stiffens the penalties for providing false information.
n	 It forces companies to validate their internal financial control process.
	
n	 The most recent overhaul of U.S. governance regulation is the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. The 
act requires that firms
n	 Choose independent compensation committees and allow long-term large shareholders to 
nominate directors.
n	 Allow shareholders to vote on executive pay and to clawback incentive pay that was errone-
ously awarded.
n	 Disclose how executive pay compares with that of the median employee, as well as how it is 
related to the firm’s financial performance.
	
n	 The Exchange Acts of 1933 and 1934 are the basis of insider trading regulation. Over time, the 
SEC and the courts have developed interpretations of the law that
n	 Prohibit insiders with a fiduciary duty to their shareholders from trading on material non-
public information in that stock.
n	 Prohibit anyone with nonpublic information about a pending or ongoing tender offer from 
trading on that information or revealing it to someone who is likely to trade on it.
29.6  Corporate Governance Around the World
	
n	 Corporate governance, regulations, and practices vary widely across countries.
n	 Some studies suggest that countries with common-law roots generally provide better 
­shareholder protection than countries with civil-law origin.
n	 Ownership structures in Europe and Asia often involve pyramidal control of a group of 
companies by a single family. In these situations, the controlling family has many opportu-
nities for expropriation of minority shareholders through tunneling.
n	 Dual class shares with differential voting rights allow a controlling shareholder or family to 
maintain control of a company or group even if their cash flow rights are relatively small. 
Dual class shares are common outside the United States.
n	 Most countries give employees some role in governing a firm. Employee involvement 
usually takes the form of board seats or works councils that are consulted before major 
decisions.
n	 It is common outside the United States for a company’s largest shareholder to be another 
company. These cross-holdings create incentives for firms to monitor each other.
29.7  The Trade-Off of Corporate Governance
	
n	 Corporate governance is a system of checks and balances that trades off costs and benefits.
	
n	 Good governance is value enhancing and so, in principle, is something investors in the firm 
should strive for. Because there are many ways to implement good governance, one should 
expect firms to display—and firms do display—wide variation in their governance structures.

risk Management
aLL FIrMS are SUBJeCt tO rISK FrOM a VarIetY OF sources: chaNGes 
in consumer tastes and demand for their products, fluctuations in the cost of raw materials, 
employee turnover, the entry of new competitors, and countless other uncertainties. Entre-
preneurs and corporate managers willingly take on these risks in the pursuit of high returns 
and accept them as part of the cost of doing business. But as with any other cost, firms 
should manage risk to minimize the effect on the value of the firm.
The primary method of risk management is prevention. For example, firms can 
avoid or at least reduce many potential risks by increasing safety standards in the work-
place, by making prudent investment decisions, and by conducting appropriate due 
diligence when entering into new relationships. But some risks are too costly to prevent 
and are inevitable consequences of running a business. As discussed in Part 5, the firm 
shares these business risks with its investors through its capital structure. Some of the 
risk is passed on to debt holders, who bear the risk that the firm will default. Most of 
the risk is held by equity holders, who are exposed to the volatility of the stock’s real-
ized return. Both types of investors can reduce their risk by holding the firm’s securities 
in a well-diversified portfolio.
Not all risks need to be passed on to the firm’s debt and equity holders. Insurance 
and financial markets allow firms to trade risk and shield their debt and equity holders 
from some types of risk. For example, after a fire shut down its processing plant in Janu-
ary 2005, Suncor Energy received more than $200 million in settlements from insurance 
contracts covering both the damage to the plant and the lost business while the plant 
was being repaired. Much of the loss from the fire was thus borne by Suncor’s insurers 
rather than by its investors. In 2008, Southwest Airlines received $1.3 billion from finan-
cial contracts that compensated it for the rise in the cost of jet fuel. In July 2015, Cisco 
held contracts to protect nearly $3.5 billion worth of projected foreign revenues from 
fluctuations in exchange rates, and General Electric held contracts, with a total market 
value exceeding $5 billion, designed to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

Chapter 30  Risk Management
In this chapter, we consider the strategies that firms use to manage and reduce the risk borne by 
their investors. We begin with the most common form of risk management, insurance. After carefully 
considering the costs and benefits of insurance, we look at the ways firms can use financial markets to 
offload the risks associated with changes in commodity prices, exchange rate fluctuations, and interest 
rate movements.
	
30.1	 Insurance
Insurance is the most common method firms use to reduce risk. Many firms purchase 
property insurance to insure their assets against hazards such as fire, storm damage, van-
dalism, earthquakes, and other natural and environmental risks. Other common types of 
insurance include:
n	 Business liability insurance, which covers the costs that result if some aspect of the 
business causes harm to a third party or someone else’s property
n	 Business interruption insurance, which protects the firm against the loss of earnings if 
the business is interrupted due to fire, accident, or some other insured peril
n	 Key personnel insurance, which compensates for the loss or unavoidable absence of 
crucial employees in the firm
In this section, we illustrate the role of insurance in reducing risk and examine its pric-
ing and potential benefits and costs for a firm.
The Role of Insurance: An Example
To understand the role of insurance in reducing risk, consider an oil refinery with a 1-in-
5000, or 0.02%, chance of being destroyed by a fire in the next year. If it is destroyed, the 
firm estimates that it will lose $150 million in rebuilding costs and lost business. We can 
summarize the risk from fire with a probability distribution:
Event
Probability
Loss (in $ million)
No fire
99.98%
0
Fire
0.02%
150
Given this probability distribution, the firm’s expected loss from fire each year is
99.98% * ($0) + 0.02% * ($150 million) = $30,000
While the expected loss is relatively small, the firm faces a large downside risk if a fire does 
occur. If the firm could completely eliminate the chance of fire for less than the present 
value of $30,000 per year, it would do so; such an investment would have a positive NPV. 
But avoiding any chance of a fire is probably not feasible with current technology (or at least 
would cost far more than $30,000 per year). Consequently, the firm can manage the risk by 
instead purchasing insurance to compensate its loss of $150 million. In exchange, the firm 
will pay an annual fee, called an insurance premium, to the insurance ­company. In this way, 
insurance allows the firm to exchange a random future loss for a certain upfront expense.
Insurance Pricing in a Perfect Market
When a firm buys insurance, it transfers the risk of the loss to an insurance company. The 
insurance company charges an upfront premium to take on that risk. At what price will the 
insurance company be willing to bear the risk in a perfect market?

	
30.1  Insurance	
1051
In a perfect market without other frictions, insurance companies should compete until 
they are just earning a fair return and the NPV from selling insurance is zero. The NPV is 
zero if the price of insurance equals the present value of the expected payment; in that case, 
we say the price is actuarially fair. If rL is the appropriate cost of capital given the risk of 
the loss, we can calculate the actuarially fair premium as follows:1
Actuarially Fair Insurance Premium
	
Insurance Premium = Pr(Loss) * E[Payment in the Event of Loss]
1 + rL

(30.1)
where Pr(Loss) is the probability that the loss will occur, E[ # ] is the expected payment if 
the loss occurs, and rL is the appropriate cost of capital.
The cost of capital rL used in Eq. 30.1 depends on the risk being insured. Consider 
again the oil refinery. The risk of fire is surely unrelated to the performance of the stock 
market or the economy. Instead, this risk is specific to this firm and, therefore, diversifi-
able in a large portfolio. As we discussed in Chapter 10, by pooling together the risks 
from many policies, insurance companies can create very-low-risk portfolios whose annual 
claims are relatively predictable. In other words, the risk of fire has a beta of zero, so it will 
not command a risk premium. In this case, rL = rf , the risk-free interest rate.
Not all insurable risks have a beta of zero. Some risks, such as hurricanes and earth-
quakes, create losses of tens of billions of dollars and may be difficult to diversify com-
pletely.2 Other types of losses may be correlated across firms. Increases in the cost of 
health care or more stringent environmental regulations raise the potential claims from 
health insurance and liability insurance for all firms. Finally, some risks can have a causal 
effect on the stock market: The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks cost insurers $34 
billion3 and also led to a 12% decline in the S&P 500 in the first week of trading follow-
ing the attacks.
For risks that cannot be fully diversified, the cost of capital rL will include a risk pre-
mium.4 By its very nature, insurance for nondiversifiable hazards is generally a negative-
beta asset (it pays off in bad times); the insurance payment to the firm tends to be larger 
when total losses are high and the market portfolio is low. Thus, the risk-adjusted rate rL 
for losses is less than the risk-free rate rf, leading to a higher insurance premium in Eq. 30.1. 
While firms that purchase insurance earn a return rL 6 rf  on their investment, because of 
the negative beta of the insurance payoff, it is still a zero-NPV transaction.5
1Equation 30.1 assumes insurance premiums are paid at the start of the year, and payments in the event 
of loss are made at the end of the year. It is straightforward to extend it to alternative timing assumptions.
2For example, insured losses from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, which pummeled the south-
eastern United States in 2005, exceeded $40 billion, with total economic losses topping $100 billion. 
When insuring large risks like these, many insurance companies buy insurance on their own portfolios 
from reinsurance companies. Reinsurance firms pool risks globally from different insurance companies 
worldwide. For natural disasters, typically, one-fourth to one-third of the insured losses is passed on to 
reinsurers.
3This number includes property, life, and liability insurance, as estimated by the Insurance Information 
Institute, www.iii.org.
4Alternatively, we can use risk-neutral probabilities, as defined in Chapter 21, to calculate the expected loss 
in the numerator of Eq. 30.1, in which case we would continue to discount using the risk-free interest rate.
5Not all insurance must have a zero or negative beta; a positive beta is possible if the amount of the insured 
loss is higher when market returns are also high.

Chapter 30  Risk Management
The Value of Insurance
In a perfect capital market, insurance will be priced so that it has an NPV of zero for both 
the insurer and the insured. But if purchasing insurance has an NPV of zero, what benefit 
does it have for the firm?
Modigliani and Miller have already provided us with the answer to this question: In a perfect 
capital market, there is no benefit to the firm from any financial transaction, including insurance. 
Insurance is a zero-NPV transaction that has no effect on value. Although insurance allows the 
firm to divide its risk in a new way (e.g., the risk of fire is held by insurers, rather than by debt 
and equity holders), the firm’s total risk—and, therefore, its value—remains unchanged.
Thus, just like a firm’s capital structure, the value of insurance must come from reduc-
ing the cost of market imperfections on the firm. Let’s consider the potential benefits of 
insurance with respect to the market imperfections that we considered in Part 5.
Bankruptcy and Financial Distress Costs.  When a firm borrows, it increases its chances 
of experiencing financial distress. In Chapter 16, we saw that financial distress may impose 
significant direct and indirect costs on the firm, including agency costs such as excessive 
risk taking and underinvestment. By insuring risks that could lead to distress, the firm can 
reduce the likelihood that it will incur these costs.
For example, for an airline with a large amount of leverage, the losses associated with an 
accident involving one of its planes may lead to financial distress. While the actual losses from 
the incident might be $150 million, the costs from distress might be an additional $40 million. 
The airline can avoid these distress costs by purchasing insurance that will cover the $150 mil-
lion loss. In this case, the $150 million paid by the insurer is worth $190 million to the firm.
Issuance Costs.  When a firm experiences losses, it may need to raise cash from outside 
investors by issuing securities. Issuing securities is an expensive endeavor. In addition to 
underwriting fees and transaction costs, there are costs from underpricing due to adverse 
Example 30.1
Insurance Pricing and the CAPM
Problem
As the owner of a landmark Chicago skyscraper, you decide to purchase insurance that will pay 
$1 billion in the event the building is destroyed by terrorists. Suppose the likelihood of such a 
loss is 0.1%, the risk-free interest rate is 4%, and the expected return of the market is 10%. If the 
risk has a beta of zero, what is the actuarially fair insurance premium? What is the premium if the 
beta of terrorism insurance is -2.5?6
Solution
The expected loss is 0.1% * $1 billion = $1 million. If the risk has a beta of zero, we compute 
the insurance premium using the risk-free interest rate: ($1 million)/1.04 = $961,538.
If the beta of the risk is not zero, we can use the CAPM to estimate the appropriate cost of 
capital. Given a beta for the loss, bL, of -2.5, and an expected market return, rmkt, of 10%:
rL = rf + bL(rmkt - rf ) = 4% - 2.5(10% - 4%) = -11%
In this case, the actuarially fair premium is ($1 million)/(1 - 0.11) = $1.124 million. Although 
this premium exceeds the expected loss, it is a fair price given the negative beta of the risk.
6Given a market volatility of 18%, a beta of -2.5 is consistent with a market decline of roughly 9% in the 
event of an attack.

selection as well as potential agency costs due to reduced ownership concentration. Because 
insurance provides cash to the firm to offset losses, it can reduce the firm’s need for exter-
nal capital and thus reduce issuance costs.
Tax Rate Fluctuations.  When a firm is subject to graduated income tax rates, insurance 
can produce a tax savings if the firm is in a higher tax bracket when it pays the premium 
than the tax bracket it is in when it receives the insurance payment in the event of a loss.
Consider an almond grower with a 10% chance of a weather-related crop failure. If the 
risk of crop failure has a beta of zero and the risk-free rate is 4%, the actuarially fair pre-
mium per $100,000 of insurance is
1
1.04
* 10% * $100,000 = $9615
Suppose the grower’s current tax rate is 35%. In the event of a crop failure, however, the 
grower expects to earn much less income and face a lower 15% tax rate. Then, the grower’s 
NPV from purchasing insurance is positive:
 NPV = -$9615 * (1 - 0.35) +
1
1.04
* 10% * $100,000 * (1 - 0.15)
 = $1923
The benefit arises because the grower is able to shift income from a period in which it has 
a high tax rate to a period in which it has a low rate. This tax benefit of insurance can be 
large if the potential losses are significant enough to have a substantial impact on the firm’s 
marginal tax rate.
Debt Capacity.  Firms limit their leverage to avoid financial distress costs. Because insur-
ance reduces the risk of financial distress, it can relax this trade-off and allow the firm to 
increase its use of debt financing.7 In Chapter 16, we found that debt financing provides 
7Indeed, it is not unusual for creditors to require the firm to carry insurance as part of a covenant.
Example 30.2
Avoiding Distress and Issuance Costs
Problem
Suppose the risk of an airline accident for a major airline is 1% per year, with a beta of zero. If 
the risk-free rate is 4%, what is the actuarially fair premium for a policy that pays $150 million 
in the event of a loss? What is the NPV of purchasing insurance for an airline that would experi-
ence $40 million in financial distress costs and $10 million in issuance costs in the event of a loss 
if it were uninsured?
Solution
The expected loss is 1% * $150 million = $1.50 million, so the actuarially fair premium is 
$1.50 million/1.04 = $1.44 million.
The total benefit of the insurance to the airline is $150 million plus an additional $50 million 
in distress and issuance costs that it can avoid if it has insurance. Thus, the NPV from purchas-
ing the insurance is
NPV = -1.44 + 1% * (150 + 50)/1.04 = $0.48 million
= $9615

several important advantages for the firm, including lower corporate tax payments due to 
the interest tax shield, lower issuance costs, and lower agency costs (through an increase in 
equity ownership concentration and a reduction in excess cash flow).
Managerial Incentives.  By eliminating the volatility that results from perils outside man-
agement’s control, insurance turns the firm’s earnings and share price into informative 
indicators of management’s performance. Therefore, the firm can increase its reliance on 
these measures as part of performance-based compensation schemes, without exposing 
managers to unnecessary risk. In addition, by lowering the volatility of the stock, insurance 
can encourage concentrated ownership by an outside director or investor who will monitor 
the firm and its management.
Risk Assessment.  Insurance companies specialize in assessing risk. In many instances, they 
may be better informed about the extent of certain risks faced by the firm than the firm’s 
own managers. This knowledge can benefit the firm by improving its investment deci-
sions. Requiring the firm to purchase fire insurance, for example, implies that the firm will 
consider differences in fire safety, through their effects on the insurance premium, when 
choosing a warehouse. Otherwise, the managers might overlook such differences. Insur-
ance firms also routinely monitor the firms they insure and can make value-­enhancing 
safety recommendations.
The Costs of Insurance
When insurance premiums are actuarially fair, using insurance to manage the firm’s risk 
can reduce costs and improve investment decisions. But in reality, market imperfections 
exist that can raise the cost of insurance above the actuarially fair price and offset some of 
these benefits.
Insurance Market Imperfections.  Three main frictions may arise between the firm and 
its insurer. First, transferring the risk to an insurance company entails administrative and 
overhead costs. The insurance company must employ sales personnel who seek out clients, 
underwriters who assess the risks of a given property, appraisers and adjusters who assess 
the damages in the event of a loss, and lawyers who can resolve potential disputes that arise 
over the claims. Insurance companies will include these expenses when setting their premi-
ums. In 2014, expenses for the property and casualty insurance industry amounted to over 
28% of premiums charged.8
A second factor that raises the cost of insurance is adverse selection. Just as a manager’s 
desire to sell equity may signal that the manager knows the firm is likely to perform poorly, 
so a firm’s desire to buy insurance may signal that it has above-average risk. If firms have 
private information about how risky they are, insurance companies must be compensated 
for this adverse selection with higher premiums.
Agency costs are a third factor that contributes to the price of insurance. Insurance 
reduces the firm’s incentive to avoid risk. For example, after purchasing fire insurance, a 
firm may decide to cut costs by reducing expenditures on fire prevention. This change in 
behavior that results from the presence of insurance is referred to as moral hazard. The 
extreme case of moral hazard is insurance fraud, in which insured parties falsify or deliber-
ately cause losses to collect insurance money. Property and casualty insurance companies 
estimate that moral hazard costs account for more than 11% of premiums.9

Addressing Market Imperfections.  Insurance companies try to mitigate adverse selection 
and moral hazard costs in a number of ways. To prevent adverse selection, they screen 
applicants to assess their risk as accurately as possible. Just as medical examinations are 
often required for individuals seeking life insurance, plant inspections and reviews of safety 
procedures are required to obtain large commercial insurance policies. To deter moral haz-
ard, insurance companies routinely investigate losses to look for evidence of fraud or delib-
erate intent.
Insurance companies also structure their policies in such a way as to reduce these costs. 
For example, most policies include both a deductible, which is the initial amount of the 
loss that is not covered by insurance, and policy limits, which limit the amount of the loss 
that is covered regardless of the extent of the damage. These provisions mean that the firm 
continues to bear some of the risk of the loss even after it is insured. In this way, the firm 
retains an incentive to avoid the loss, reducing moral hazard. Also, because risky firms will 
prefer lower deductibles and higher limits (because they are more likely to experience a 
loss), insurers can use the firm’s policy choice to help identify its risk and reduce adverse 
selection.10

Insurance Policy,” American Economic Review 69 (1979): 84–96; G. Huberman, D. Mayers, and C.

Example 30.3
Adverse Selection and Policy Limits
Problem
Your firm faces a potential $100 million loss that it would like to insure. Because of tax benefits 
and the avoidance of financial distress and issuance costs, each $1 received in the event of a loss 
is worth $1.50 to the firm. Two policies are available: One pays $55 million and the other pays 
$100 million if a loss occurs. The insurance company charges 20% more than the actuarially 
fair premium to cover administrative expenses. To account for adverse selection, the insurance 
company estimates a 5% probability of loss for the $55 million policy and a 6% probability of 
loss for $100 million policy.
Suppose the beta of the risk is zero and the risk-free rate is 5%. Which policy should the firm 
choose if its risk of loss is 5%? Which should it choose if its risk of loss is 6%?
Solution
The premium charged for each policy is
Premium ($55 million policy) = 5% * $55 million
1.05
* 1.20 = $3.14 million
Premium ($100 million policy) = 6% * $100 million
1.05
* 1.20 = $6.86 million
If the risk of a loss is 5%, the NPV of each policy is
NPV ($55 million policy)
= -$3.14 million + 5% * $55 million
1.05
* 1.50 = $0.79 million

Chapter 30  Risk Management
The Insurance Decision
In a perfect capital market, purchasing insurance does not add value to the firm. It can add 
value in the presence of market imperfections, but market imperfections are also likely to 
raise the premiums charged by insurers. For insurance to be attractive, the benefit to the 
firm must exceed the additional premium charged by the insurer.
For these reasons, insurance is most likely to be attractive to firms that are currently 
financially healthy, do not need external capital, and are paying high current tax rates. They 
will benefit most from insuring risks that can lead to cash shortfalls or financial distress, 
and that insurers can accurately assess and monitor to prevent moral hazard.
Full insurance is unlikely to be attractive for risks about which firms have a great deal of 
private information or that are subject to severe moral hazard. Also, firms that are already 
in financial distress have a strong incentive not to purchase insurance—they need cash 
today and have an incentive to take risk because future losses are likely to be borne by their 
debt holders.

30.2	 Commodity Price Risk
Firms use insurance to protect against the unlikely event that their real assets are damaged 
or destroyed by hazards such as fires, hurricanes, accidents, and other catastrophes that 
are outside their normal course of business. At the same time, many risks that firms face 
arise naturally as part of their business operations. For many firms, changes in the market 
prices of the raw materials they use and the goods they produce may be the most important 
source of risk to their profitability. For example, in the airline industry, the second-largest 
expense after labor is jet fuel. With oil prices increasing from a low of $17 a barrel in 2001, 
to nearly $150 a barrel in mid-2008, most major carriers struggled to achieve profitability. 
Industry analysts estimate that each $1 per barrel increase in the price of oil equates to 
a $425 million increase in the industry’s annual jet fuel expenses. United Airlines alone

= -$6.86 million + 5% * $100 million

Thus, with a 5% risk, the firm should choose the policy with lower coverage. If the risk of a loss 
is 6%, the policy with higher coverage is superior:
NPV($55 million policy)
= -$3.14 million + 6% * $55 million
1.05
 * 1.50 = $1.57 million
NPV($100 million policy)
= -$6.86 million + 6% * $100 million
1.05
* 1.50 = $1.71 million
Note that the insurance company’s concerns regarding adverse selection are justified: Firms that 
are riskier will choose the higher-coverage policy.

spent more than $11 billion on fuel in 2014, nearly 30% of its annual revenue. For an 
airline, oil price fluctuations are clearly an important source of risk.
In this section, we discuss ways firms can reduce, or hedge, their exposure to commodity 
price movements. Like insurance, hedging involves contracts or transactions that provide 
the firm with cash flows that offset its losses from price changes.
Hedging with Vertical Integration and Storage
Firms can hedge risk by making real investments in assets with offsetting risk. The most 
common strategies are vertical integration and storage.
Vertical integration entails the merger of a firm and its supplier (or a firm and its customer). 
Because an increase in the price of the commodity raises the firm’s costs and the supplier’s rev-
enues, these firms can offset their risks by merging. For example, in 2005 Japanese tire maker 
Bridgestone purchased a large Indonesian rubber plantation to control its costs. As the price 
of rubber increases, so will the profits of the rubber plantation, offsetting the higher costs of 
making tires. Similarly, airlines could offset their oil price risk by merging with an oil company.
While vertical integration can reduce risk, it does not always increase value. Recall the key 
lesson of Modigliani and Miller: Firms add no value by doing something investors can do for 
themselves. Investors concerned about commodity price risk can diversify by “vertically inte-
grating” their portfolios and buying shares of the firm and its supplier. Because the acquiring 
firm often pays a substantial premium over the current share price of the firm being acquired, 
the shareholders of the acquiring firm would generally find it cheaper to diversify on their own.
Vertical integration can add value if combining the firms results in important synergies. For 
example, Boeing ultimately decided to purchase a number of its suppliers involved in its 787 
“Dreamliner” to improve quality control and coordination, and reduce production delays. In 
many instances, however, diseconomies would be the more likely outcome of vertical integra-
tion, as the combined firm would lack a strategic focus (e.g., airlines and oil producers). Finally, 
vertical integration is not a perfect hedge: A firm’s supplier is exposed to many other risks besides 
commodity prices. By integrating vertically, the firm eliminates one risk but acquires others.
A related strategy is the long-term storage of inventory. An airline concerned about 
rising fuel costs could purchase a large quantity of fuel today and store the fuel until it is 
needed. By doing so, the firm locks in its cost for fuel at today’s price plus storage costs. 
But for many commodities, storage costs are much too high for this strategy to be attrac-
tive. Such a strategy also requires a substantial cash outlay upfront. If the firm does not 
have the required cash, it would need to raise external capital—and consequently would 
suffer issuance and adverse selection costs. Finally, maintaining large amounts of inventory 
would dramatically increase working capital requirements, a cost for the firm.
Hedging with Long-Term Contracts
An alternative to vertical integration or storage is a long-term supply contract. Firms rou-
tinely enter into long-term lease contracts for real estate, fixing the price at which they will 
obtain office space many years in advance. Similarly, utility companies sign long-term sup-
ply contracts with power generators, and steelmakers sign long-term contracts with mining 
firms for iron ore. Through these contracts, both parties can achieve price stability for their 
product or input.
A good example is provided by Southwest Airlines. In early 2000, when oil prices were 
close to $20 per barrel, Chief Financial Officer Gary Kelly developed a strategy to protect 
the airline from a surge in oil prices. By the time oil prices soared above $30 per barrel later 
that year and put the airline industry into a financial crisis, Southwest had signed contracts 
guaranteeing a price for its fuel equivalent to $23 per barrel. The savings from its fuel hedge 

1058	
Chapter 30  Risk Management
amounted to almost 50% of Southwest’s earnings that year, as shown in Figure 30.1. Kelly 
went on to become Southwest’s CEO, and Southwest has continued this strategy to hedge 
fuel costs. Between 1998 and 2008, Southwest saved $3.5 billion over what it would have 
spent if it had paid the industry’s average price for jet fuel, accounting for 83% of the com-
pany’s profits during that period.
Of course, like insurance, commodity hedging does not always boost a firm’s profits. Had 
oil prices fallen below $23 per barrel in the fall of 2000, Southwest’s hedging policy would 
have reduced the firm’s earnings by obligating it to pay $23 per barrel for its oil (and perhaps 
Kelly might not have gone on to be CEO). Presumably, Southwest felt that it could afford 
to pay $23 per barrel for oil even if the price fell. In fact, in recent years oil prices have fallen 
dramatically leaving Southwest with a loss of $1.8 billion for outstanding hedges through 
2018. In response, the airline significantly reduced its hedging program in 2016, from about 
70% of its fuel consumption, to 30%. But although these hedges have turned out to be a bad 
bet recently, the losses from them were offset by Southwest’s higher profit margins resulting 
from low fuel costs. Thus, in either case, as Figure 30.1 illustrates, hedging stabilizes earnings.
Example 30.4
Hedging with Long-Term Contracts
Problem
Consider a chocolate maker that will need 10,000 tons of cocoa beans next year. Suppose the 
current market price of cocoa beans is $1400 per ton. At this price, the firm expects earnings 
before interest and taxes of $22 million next year. What will the firm’s EBIT be if the price of 
cocoa beans rises to $1950 per ton? What will EBIT be if the price of cocoa beans falls to $1200 
per ton? What will EBIT be in each scenario if the firm enters into a supply contract for cocoa 
beans for a fixed price of $1450 per ton?

Smoothes Earnings
By locking in its fuel costs 
through long-term supply 
contracts, Southwest Air-
lines has kept its earnings 
stable in the face of fluc-
tuating fuel prices. With a 
long-term contract at a price 
of $23 per barrel, South-
west would gain by buying 
at this price if oil prices go 
above $23 per barrel. If oil 
prices fall below $23 per 
barrel, Southwest would lose 
from its commitment to buy 
at a higher price.

30.2  Commodity Price Risk	
1059
Often, long-term supply contracts are bilateral contracts negotiated by a buyer and a seller. 
Such contracts have several potential disadvantages. First, they expose each party to the risk 
that the other party may default and fail to live up to the terms of the contract. Thus, while 
they insulate the firms from commodity price risk, they expose them to credit risk. Second, 
such contracts cannot be entered into anonymously; the buyer and seller know each other’s 
identity. This lack of anonymity may have strategic disadvantages. Finally, the market value 
of the contract at any point in time may not be easy to determine, making it difficult to track 
gains and losses, and it may be difficult or even impossible to cancel the contract if necessary.
An alternative strategy that avoids these disadvantages is to hedge with futures contracts. 
We investigate this strategy in the next section.
Hedging with Futures Contracts
A commodity futures contract is a type of long-term contract designed to avoid the disad-
vantages cited above. A futures contract is an agreement to trade an asset on some future 
date, at a price that is locked in today. Futures contracts are traded anonymously on an 
exchange at a publicly observed market price and are generally very liquid. Both the buyer 
and the seller can get out of the contract at any time by selling it to a third party at the cur-
rent market price. Finally, through a mechanism we will describe shortly, futures contracts 
are designed to eliminate credit risk.
Figure 30.2 shows the prices in September 2015 of futures contracts for light, sweet crude 
oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). Each contract represents a 
Solution
If the price of cocoa beans increases to $1950 per ton, the firm’s costs will increase by (1950 -
1400) * 10,000 = $5.5 million. Other things equal, EBIT will decline to $22 million - $5.5
million = $16.5 million. If the price of cocoa beans falls to $1200 per ton, EBIT will rise to 
$22 million - (1200 - 1400) * 10,000 = $24 million. Alternatively, the firm can avoid this 
risk by entering into the supply contract that fixes the price in either scenario at $1450 per ton, 
for an EBIT of $22 million - (1450 - 1400) * 10,000 = $21.5 million.

commitment to trade 1000 barrels of oil at the futures price on its delivery date. For exam-
ple, by trading the March 2019 contract, buyers and sellers in September 2015 agreed to 
exchange 1000 barrels of oil in March 2019 at a price of $57 per barrel. By doing so, they 
were able to lock in the price they will pay or receive for oil more than three years in advance.
The futures prices shown in Figure 30.2 are not prices that are paid today. Rather, they 
are prices agreed to today, to be paid in the future. The futures prices are determined in the 
market based on supply and demand for each delivery date. They depend on expectations 
of future oil prices, adjusted by an appropriate risk premium.11
Eliminating Credit Risk.  If a buyer commits to purchase crude oil in March 2019 for 
$57 per barrel, how can the seller be assured that the buyer will honor that commitment? 
If the actual price of oil in March 2019 is only $35 per barrel, the buyer will have a strong 
incentive to renege and default on the contract. Similarly, the seller will have an incentive 
to default if the actual price of oil is more than $57 in March 2019.
Futures exchanges use two mechanisms to prevent buyers or sellers from defaulting. 
First, traders are required to post collateral, called margin, when buying or selling com-
modities using futures contracts. This collateral serves as a guarantee that traders will meet 
their obligations. In addition, rather than waiting until the end of the contract, there is 
daily settlement of all profits and losses through a procedure called marking to market. 
That is, gains and losses are computed and exchanged each day based on the change in the 
price of the futures contract.
Marking to Market: An Example.  Suppose that the price of the March 2019 futures 
contract varies as shown in Table  30.1 over the 900 remaining trading days between 
September 2015 and the delivery date in March 2019. A buyer who enters into the 
11If we let Pt be the market price of oil at the time of delivery, and Ft be the futures price agreed to today 
for delivery on date t, then the buyer of a futures contract receives oil worth Pt and pays Ft at delivery, 
for a net payoff of Pt - Ft. The seller’s payoff is Ft - Pt. We compute the NPV of the contract by dis-
counting the futures price at the risk-free rate (because it is known when we enter the contract) and the 
expected oil price at a rate rp that reflects a risk premium for uncertainty regarding the price of oil. Because 
­competition should drive the NPV to zero, we have
0 =
E[Pt]
(1 + rp)t -
Ft
(1 + rf )t or Ft = E[Pt] 
(1 + rf )t
(1 + rp)t
Also, the futures price cannot exceed the cost of storing, or “carrying,” oil for the future: 
Ft … P0 (1 + rf )t + FV (storage costs). Otherwise, buying, storing, and selling oil using futures contracts 
would offer an arbitrage opportunity. (Because the cheapest way to store oil is to leave it in the ground, 
the futures price is often well below this “cost-of-carry” price. Thus, the relationship between the current 
price, P0, and the futures price, Ft, will depend on oil producers’ ability to shift production across time.)

contract on date 0 has committed to pay the futures price of $57 per barrel for oil. If the next 
day the futures price is only $55 per barrel, the buyer has a loss of $2 per barrel on her posi-
tion. This loss is settled immediately by deducting $2 from the buyer’s margin account. If the 
price rises to $56 per barrel on day 2, the gain of $1 is added to the buyer’s margin account. 
This process continues until the contract delivery date, with the daily gains and losses shown. 
The buyer’s cumulative loss is the sum of these daily amounts and always equals the differ-
ence between the original contract price of $57 per barrel and the current contract price.
In December 2018, delivery takes place at the final futures price, which is equal to the 
actual price of oil at that time.12 In the example in Table 30.1, the buyer ultimately pays 
$35 per barrel for oil and has lost $22 per barrel in her margin account. Thus, her total cost 
is $35 + $22 = $57 per barrel, the price for oil she originally committed to. Through this 
daily marking to market, buyers and sellers pay for any losses as they occur, rather than 
waiting until the final delivery date. Thus, as long as the margin balance is sufficient to 
cover the daily variation in price, this mechanism avoids the risk of default.13
In essence, the March 2019 futures contract is the same as a long-term supply ­contract 
with a set price of $57 per barrel of oil.14 But unlike a bilateral contract, the buyer and the 
seller can close their positions at any time (and accept the cumulative losses or gains in 
12At its delivery date, a futures contract is a contract for immediate delivery. Thus, by the Law of One 
Price, its price must be the actual price of oil in the market.
13The futures exchange sets a minimum balance for the margin account to be sure it is sufficient to cover 
one day’s loss. If a buyer’s remaining margin in the account is too low, the exchange will require the buyer 
to replenish the account in a margin call. If the buyer fails to do so, the account will be closed and the 
buyer’s contract will be assigned to a new buyer.
14Because the daily marked-to-market gains and losses occur over the life of the contract rather than at the 
end, after we account for interest, the future value of the loss is somewhat higher with a futures contract 
than with a supply contract. To account for this effect, which can be sizable for a multiyear contract, prac-
titioners generally reduce the magnitude of their initial futures position to reflect the interest earned over 
the life of the contract. This adjustment is called tailing the hedge.
Hedging Risk
There are several common mistakes to be avoided when 
hedging risk:
Account for Natural Hedges. Even though purchases of a 
commodity may be a firm’s largest expense, they may not be 
a source of risk if the firm can pass along those costs to its 
customers. For example, gas stations do not need to hedge 
their cost of oil, because the price of gasoline—and thus 
their revenues—fluctuate with it. When a firm can pass on 
cost increases to its customers or revenue decreases to its sup-
pliers, it has a natural hedge for these risks. A firm should 
hedge risks to its profits only after such natural hedges are 
accounted for, lest it over-hedge and increase risk.
Liquidity Risk. When hedging with futures contracts, the 
firm stabilizes its earnings by offsetting business losses with 
gains on the futures contracts and by offsetting business gains 
with losses on the futures contracts. In the latter scenario, the 
firm runs the risk of receiving margin calls on its futures posi-
tions before it realizes the cash flows from the business gains. 
To effectively hedge, the firm must have, or be able to raise, 
the cash required to meet these margin calls or it may be forced 
to default on its positions. Hence, when hedging with future 
contracts, the firm is exposed to ­liquidity risk. Such was the 
case for Metallgesellschaft Refining and Marketing (MGRM), 
which shut down in 1993 with more than $1 billion in losses 
in the oil futures market. MGRM had written long-term con-
tracts to supply oil to its customers and hedged its risk that oil 
prices might rise by buying oil futures. When oil prices subse-
quently dropped, MGRM faced a cash flow crisis and could 
not meet the margin calls on its futures positions.
Basis Risk. Futures contracts are available only for a set of 
standardized commodities, with specific delivery dates and 
locations. Thus, while a futures contract that promises to 
deliver crude oil in Oklahoma in June 2018 is a reason-
able hedge for the cost of jet fuel in Dallas in July 2018, it 
will not be a perfect match. Basis risk is the risk that arises 
because the value of the futures contract will not be perfectly 
correlated with the firm’s exposure.

1062	
Chapter 30  Risk Management
their margin accounts), and the contract will then be reassigned to a new buyer or seller at 
its current price. Because of this liquidity and the lack of credit risk, commodity futures 
contracts are the predominant method by which many firms hedge oil price risk. Similar 
futures contracts exist for many other commodities, including natural gas, coal, electricity, 
silver, gold, aluminum, soybeans, corn, wheat, rice, cattle, pork bellies, cocoa, sugar, car-
bon dioxide emissions, and even frozen orange juice.
Deciding to Hedge Commodity Price Risk
In a perfect market, commodity supply contracts and futures contracts are zero-NPV 
investments that do not change the value of the firm. But hedging commodity price 
risk can benefit the firm by reducing the costs of other frictions. Just as with insurance, 
the potential benefits include reduced financial distress and issuance costs, tax savings, 
increased debt capacity, and improved managerial incentives and risk assessment. Com-
modity futures markets, in particular, provide valuable information to commodity produc-
ers and users. For example, an oil firm can lock in the future price of oil before it spends 
millions of dollars on drilling a new well. A farmer unsure of future crop prices can lock in 
the futures price of wheat when deciding the quantity to plant.
But while hedging commodity price risk has similar potential benefits as buying insur-
ance, it does not have the same costs. In comparison to the market for hazard insurance, 
the commodity markets are less vulnerable to the problems of adverse selection and moral 
hazard. Firms generally do not possess better information than outside investors regarding 
the risk of future commodity price changes, nor can they influence that risk through their 
actions. Also, futures contracts are very liquid and do not entail large administrative costs.
Trading in these contracts carries other costs, however. First, as Figure 30.1 illustrates, 
when a firm hedges, sometimes it will lose money. These losses will be offset by other gains 
or savings, but the firm must be sure it can weather the losses until it realizes the offsetting 
gains. Therefore, the firm must have access to capital it can post as collateral until the ulti-
mate delivery date. Second, the firm may speculate by entering into contracts that do not 
offset its actual risks. Speculating increases the firm’s risk rather than reducing it. When a 
firm authorizes managers to trade contracts to hedge, it opens the door to the possibility of 
Differing Hedging Strategies
In mid-2005, oil prices rose to more than $60 per barrel. As a 
result of its aggressive hedging policy, Southwest Airlines was 
paying slightly more than $26 per barrel for 85% of its oil at 
the time. But many other U.S. airlines lacked, at that time, 
the cash or creditworthiness necessary to enter into long-term 
contracts. In 2004, Delta was forced to sell its supply con-
tracts to raise cash so as to avoid defaulting on its debt. United 
Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December 
2002, had only 30% of its fuel hedged in 2005 at a price of 
$45 per barrel. Researchers have documented these patterns 
more generally: Risk management drops substantially as air-
lines approach distress and recovers only slowly afterward.*
These differences in strategy are somewhat under-
standable given the airlines’ differing financial positions. 
Southwest was profitable and desired to reduce its risk of 
becoming financially distressed by hedging its fuel costs. 
Moreover, it had the collateral necessary to do so. Delta 
and United were already financially constrained and in 
financial distress. Hedging would therefore tie up scarce 
collateral without avoiding distress costs. And for Delta 
and United’s equity holders, taking a risk by not hedg-
ing may be the best strategy—a sudden drop in oil prices 
would lead to a windfall for equity holders, while losses 
from further increases would likely be borne by debt hold-
ers in default.
As the financial health of United and Delta improved, 
they too became active hedgers, resulting in large losses 
when oil prices fell dramatically in 2014–15. United and 
Delta combined reported over $3 billion in hedging losses 
in 2015, and along with Southwest Airlines, have decided 
to scale back their hedging programs.

30.3	 Exchange Rate Risk
Multinational firms face the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. In this section, we consider two 
strategies that firms use to hedge this risk: currency forward contracts and currency options.
Exchange Rate Fluctuations
Recall from Chapter 3 that an exchange rate is the market rate at which one currency 
can be exchanged for another currency. Consider the relationship between the U.S. dollar 
and the euro. In April 2008, the value of the euro (;) relative to the dollar peaked at an 
exchange rate of 0.625 euros per dollar or, equivalently,
1
;0.625/$ = $1.60 per euro
Like most foreign exchange rates, the dollar/euro rate is a floating rate, which means it 
changes constantly depending on the quantity supplied and demanded for each currency 
in the market. The supply and demand for each currency is driven by three factors:
n	 Firms trading goods: A U.S. dealer exchanges dollars for euros to buy cars from a German 
automaker.
n	 Investors trading securities: A Japanese investor exchanges yen for dollars to purchase 
U.S. bonds.
n	 The actions of central banks in each country: The British central bank may exchange 
pounds for euros to attempt to keep down the value of the pound.
Because the supply and demand for currencies varies with global economic conditions, 
exchange rates are volatile. Figure 30.3 shows the dollar price of euros from January 1999

through October 2015. Notice that the price of the euro often varies by as much as 20% over 
periods as short as a few months. From its low in 2000 to the summer of 2008, the value of 
the euro nearly doubled relative to the dollar, only to fall by close to 20% between August 
and October 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis, and again in 2014 in response to con-
tinued instability in the eurozone.
Fluctuating exchange rates cause a problem, known as the importer–exporter dilemma, 
for firms doing business in international markets. To illustrate, consider the problem faced 
by Manzini Cyclery, a small U.S. maker of custom bicycles. Manzini needs to import parts 
from an Italian supplier, Campagnolo. If Campagnolo sets the price of its parts in euros, then 
Manzini faces the risk that the dollar may fall, making euros, and therefore the parts, more 
expensive. If Campagnolo sets its prices in dollars, then Campagnolo faces the risk that the 
dollar may fall and it will receive fewer euros for the parts it sells to the U.S. manufacturer.
The problem of exchange rate risk is a general problem in any import–export relationship. 
If neither company will accept the exchange rate risk, the transaction may be difficult or 
impossible to negotiate. Example 30.5 demonstrates the potential magnitude of the problem.
Example 30.5
 The Effect of Exchange Rate Risk
Problem
In December 2002, when the exchange rate was $1 per euro, Manzini ordered parts for next 
year’s production from Campagnolo. They agreed to a price of 500,000 euros, to be paid when 
the parts were delivered in one year’s time. One year later, the exchange rate was $1.22 per euro. 
What was the actual cost in dollars for Manzini when the payment was due? If the price had 
instead been set at $500,000 (which had equivalent value at the time of the agreement), how 
many euros would Campagnolo have received?
Solution
With the price set at 500,000 euros, Manzini had to pay ($1.22/euro) * (500,000 euros) = 
$610,000. This cost is $110,000, or 22% higher than it would have been if the price had been 
set in dollars.
If the price had been set in dollars, Manzini would have paid $500,000, which would have 
been worth only $500,000 , ($1.22/euro) = 409,836 euros to Campagnolo, or more than 18% 
less. Whether the price was set in euros or dollars, one of the parties would have suffered a sub-
stantial loss.
Hedging with Forward Contracts
Exchange rate risk naturally arises whenever transacting parties use different currencies: 
One of the parties will be at risk if exchange rates fluctuate. The most common method 
firms use to reduce the risk that results from changes in exchange rates is to hedge the 
transaction using currency forward contracts.
A currency forward contract is a contract that sets the exchange rate in advance. It 
is usually written between a firm and a bank, and it fixes a currency exchange rate for a 
transaction that will occur at a future date. A currency forward contract specifies (1) an 
exchange rate, (2) an amount of currency to exchange, and (3) a delivery date on which 
the exchange will take place. The exchange rate set in the contract is referred to as the 
forward exchange rate, because it applies to an exchange that will occur in the future. By 
entering into a currency forward contract, a firm can lock in an exchange rate in advance 
and reduce or eliminate its exposure to fluctuations in a currency’s value.

	
30.3  Exchange Rate Risk	
1065
If the forward contract allows the importer to eliminate the risk of a stronger euro, 
where does the risk go? At least initially, the risk passes to the bank that has written the 
forward contract. Because the bank agrees to exchange dollars for euros at a fixed rate, it 
will experience a loss if the euro increases in value. In Example 30.6, the bank receives only 
$493,500 in the forward contract, but gives up euros that are worth $610,000.
Why is the bank willing to bear this risk? First, generally the bank is much larger and 
has more capital than a small importer, so it can bear the risk without being in jeopardy of 
financial distress. More importantly, in most settings the bank will not even hold the risk. 
Instead, the bank will find another party willing to trade euros for dollars. By entering into 
a second forward contract with offsetting risk, the bank can eliminate its risk altogether.
This situation is illustrated in Figure 30.4. A U.S. importer, who must pay for goods 
with euros, purchases euros from the bank through a forward contract with a forward 
exchange rate of $0.987 per euro. This transaction locks in the importer’s cost at $493,500. 
Similarly, a U.S. exporter, who will receive payment in euros, uses a forward contract to sell 
the euros to the bank, locking in the exporter’s revenue at $493,500. The bank holds both 
forward contracts—the first to exchange dollars for euros and the second to exchange euros 
for dollars. The bank bears no exchange rate risk and earns fees from both the exporter and 
the importer.
Cash-and-Carry and the Pricing of Currency Forwards
An alternative method, the cash-and-carry strategy, also enables a firm or bank to elimi-
nate exchange rate risk. Because this strategy provides the same cash flows as the forward 
contract, we can use it to determine the forward exchange rate using the Law of One Price. 
Let’s begin by considering the different ways investors can exchange foreign currency in 
the future for dollars in the future.
Example 30.6
Using a Forward Contract to Lock In an Exchange Rate
Problem
In December 2002, banks were offering one-year currency forward contracts with a forward 
exchange rate of $0.987/;. Suppose that at that time, Manzini placed the order with Campag-
nolo with a price of 500,000 euros and simultaneously entered into a forward contract to pur-
chase 500,000 euros at a forward exchange rate of $0.987/; in December 2003. What payment 
would Manzini be required to make in December 2003?
Solution
Even though the exchange rate rose to $1.22/; in December 2003, making the euro more 
expensive, Manzini would obtain the 500,000 euros using the forward contract at the forward 
exchange rate of $0.987/;. Thus, Manzini must pay
500,000 euros * $0.987/; = $493,500 in December 2003
Manzini would pay this amount to the bank in exchange for 500,000 euros, which are then paid 
to Campagnolo.
This forward contract would have been a good deal for Manzini because without the hedge, it 
would have had to exchange dollars for euros at the prevailing rate of $1.22/;, raising its cost to 
$610,000. However, the exchange rate could have moved the other way. If the exchange rate had 
fallen to $0.85/;, the forward contract still commits Manzini to pay $0.987/;. In other words, 
the forward contract locks in the exchange rate and eliminates the risk—whether the movement 
of the exchange rate is favorable or unfavorable.

1066	
Chapter 30  Risk Management
The Law of One Price and the Forward Exchange Rate.  Currency forward contracts 
allow investors to exchange a foreign currency in the future for dollars in the future at 
the forward exchange rate. We illustrate such an exchange in the currency timeline in 
Figure 30.5, which indicates time horizontally by dates (as in a standard timeline) and 
currencies vertically (dollars and euros). Thus, “dollars in one year” corresponds to the 
upper-right point in the timeline and “euros in one year” corresponds to the lower-right 
point in the timeline. To convert cash flows between points, we must convert them at an 
appropriate rate. The forward exchange rate, indicated by F$/;, tells us the rate at which 
we can exchange euros for dollars in one year using a forward contract.
Figure 30.5 also illustrates other transactions that we can use to move between dates or 
currencies in the timeline. We can convert euros to dollars today at the current exchange 
rate, also referred to as the spot exchange rate, S$/;. By borrowing or lending at the dollar 
interest rate r$, we can exchange dollars today for dollars in one year. Finally, we can con-
vert euros today for euros in one year at the euro interest rate r;, which is the rate at which 
banks will borrow or lend on euro-denominated accounts.

As Figure 30.5 shows, combining these other transactions provides an alternative way to 
convert euros to dollars in one year. The cash-and-carry strategy consists of the following 
three simultaneous trades:
	
1.	 Borrow euros today using a one-year loan with the interest rate r;.
	
2.	 Exchange the euros for dollars today at the spot exchange rate S $/;.
	
3.	 Invest the dollars today for one year at the interest rate r$.
In one year’s time, we will owe euros (from the loan in transaction 1) and receive dollars 
(from the investment in transaction 3). That is, we have converted euros in one year to dol-
lars in one year, just as with the forward contract. This method is called a cash-and-carry 
strategy because we borrow cash that we then carry (invest) in the future.
Arbitrage in Currency Markets?
counter-party risk—the entity on the other side of the for-
ward contract might default on their obligation. Because 
of the heightened uncertainty during the crisis, inves-
tors might very well have viewed this one-month com-
mitment as risky. Hence, the strategy was not really risk 
free—these “profits” were at least in part compensation 
for this risk. Finally, Professors Loriano Mancini, Angelo 
Ranaldo, and Jan Wrampelmeyer* provide evidence that 
liquidity might also have been a contributing factor. U.S. 
short-term credit markets (including even overnight mar-
kets) froze during the crisis, so banks and other traders 
might have had difficulty taking advantage of the appar-
ent arbitrage opportunity because borrowing dollars was 
very difficult. In other words, during the financial crisis 
the natural arbitrageurs in these markets were themselves 
capital constrained!
*“Liquidity in the Foreign Exchange Market: Measurement, Common-
ality, and Risk Premiums,” Journal of Finance 68 (2012): 1805–1841.
Currency markets are amongst the largest and most liquid 
markets in the world. Consequently, they are one of the last 
places we would expect to find arbitrage opportunities. Yet, for 
a short time during the 2008 financial crisis there were arbi-
trage opportunities in these markets when the cash-and-carry 
strategy and the forward exchange rate did not provide the 
same rate of exchange in the forward market. The figure below 
shows the profits per dollar from borrowing for one month 
in dollars, converting the proceeds into euros at the spot 
exchange rate, investing for one month in euros, and simulta-
neously entering into a forward contract to convert euros back 
to dollars in a month. Prior to the 2008 crisis, the strategy 
did not make economically meaningful profits, but during the 
crisis the strategy appears to have been quite profitable—at the 
peak generating about $0.25 for each borrowed dollar.
What explains these apparent profits? One possibil-
ity is the risk of default. The arbitrage requires borrow-
ing and lending, and during the crisis the risk of default 
was perceived to be very high. In addition, there is also

Because the forward contract and the cash-and-carry strategy accomplish the same con-
version, by the Law of One Price they must do so at the same rate. Combining the rates 
used in the cash-and-carry strategy leads to the following no-arbitrage formula for the

the interest rates in each currency. Note that on both sides of the equation, the ultimate 
units are $/; in one year.
Let’s evaluate Eq. 30.2 in an example. In December 2002, the spot exchange rate 
was $1/;, while one-year interest rates were 1.66% for dollars and 3% for euros. From 
Eq. 30.2, the no-arbitrage forward exchange rate in December 2002 for an exchange to 
take place one year later was
F = S *
1 + r$
1 + r;
= ($1/;) * 1.0166
1.0300 = $0.987/;
which is the rate offered by the bank in Example 30.6.
Equation 30.2 is referred to as the covered interest parity equation; it states that the dif-
ference between the forward and spot exchange rates is related to the interest rate differential 
between the currencies. When the interest rate differs across countries, investors have an 
incentive to borrow in the low-interest rate currency and invest in the high-interest rate cur-
rency. Of course, there is always the risk that the high-interest rate currency could depreciate 
while the investment is held. If you try to avoid this risk by locking in the future exchange 
rate using a forward contract, Eq. 30.2 implies that the forward exchange rate will exactly 
offset any benefit from the higher interest rate, eliminating any arbitrage opportunity.
Example 30.7
Computing the No-Arbitrage Forward Exchange Rate
Problem
Suppose that in December 2019, the spot exchange rate for the Japanese yen is ¥116/$. At the 
same time, the one-year interest rate in the United States is 4.85% and the one-year interest rate in 
Japan is 0.10%. Based on these rates, what forward exchange rate is consistent with no arbitrage?
Solution
We can compute the forward exchange rate using Eq. 30.2. Because the exchange rate is in terms 
of ¥/$ rather than $/¥, we also need to invert the interest rates in the formula:
F = S 1 + r¥
1 + r$
= ¥116/$ * 1.0010
1.0485 = ¥110.7/$ in one year
(A useful rule to remember is that the ratio of interest rates must match the units of the exchange 
rate. Because the exchange rate is ¥/$, we multiply by the yen interest rate and divide by the dol-
lar interest rate. Of course, we could also solve the problem by converting all the rates to $/¥.) 
The forward exchange rate is lower than the spot exchange rate, offsetting the higher interest rate 
on dollar investments.

Advantages of Forward Contracts.  Why do firms use forward contracts rather than the 
cash-and-carry strategy? First, the forward contract is simpler, requiring one transaction 
rather than three, so it may have lower transaction fees. Second, many firms are not able to 
borrow easily in different currencies and may pay a higher interest rate if their credit qual-
ity is poor. Generally speaking, cash-and-carry strategies are used primarily by large banks, 
which can borrow most easily and face the lowest transaction costs. Banks use such a strat-
egy to hedge their currency exposures that result from commitments to forward contracts.
Example 30.8
Using the Cash-and-Carry Strategy
Problem
In December 2019, a Japanese bank enters into a forward contract with Japanese exporter Shi-
mano, in which Shimano agrees to exchange $100 million for yen in December 2020 at the 
forward exchange rate of ¥110.7/$. If the current exchange rate is ¥116/$, and one-year interest 
rates are 4.85% in the United States and 0.10% in Japan, how can the bank hedge its risk if it has 
no other clients interested in currency forward contracts?
Solution
The forward contract specifies that Shimano will pay $100 million to the bank in exchange for 
$100 million * ¥110.7/$ = 11.07 billion yen. To hedge its risk, the bank may find another cli-
ent or clients who would like to exchange yen for dollars. When no such clients can be found, 
the bank can still hedge its risk using a cash-and-carry strategy:
	
1.	 Borrow dollars today at the dollar interest rate of 4.85%. The bank can borrow 
$100 million/1.0485 = $95.37 million today and repay the loan using the cash 
received from Shimano.
	
2.	 Convert dollars to yen at the spot exchange rate of ¥116/$. The bank can convert the 
­dollars borrowed to $95.37 million * ¥116/$ = ¥11.06 billion.
	
3.	 Invest the yen today at the yen interest rate of 0.10%. By depositing the yen for one year, 
the bank will have 11.06 billion * 1.001 = ¥11.07 billion in one year.
Through this combination of transactions, the bank can lock in its ability to convert dollars to 
yen at the rate agreed upon in the forward contract with Shimano.
Equation 30.2 easily generalizes to a forward contract longer than one year. Using the 
same logic, but investing or borrowing for T years rather than one year, the no-arbitrage 
forward rate for an exchange that will occur T years in the future is
	
FT = S *
(1 + r$)T
(1 + r;)T 
(30.3)
where the spot and forward rates are in units of $/; and the interest rates are the current 
risk-free T-year rates from the yield curve for each currency.
Hedging with Options
Currency options are another method that firms commonly use to manage exchange rate 
risk. Currency options, like the stock options introduced in Chapter 20, give the holder 
the right—but not the obligation—to exchange currency at a given exchange rate. Cur-
rency forward contracts allow firms to lock in a future exchange rate; currency options 
allow firms to insure themselves against the exchange rate moving beyond a certain level.

1070	
Chapter 30  Risk Management
To demonstrate the difference between hedging with forward contracts and hedging 
with options, let’s examine a specific situation. In December 2005, the one-year forward 
exchange rate was $1.20 per euro. Instead of locking in this exchange rate using a forward 
contract, a firm that will need euros in one year can buy a call option on the euro, giving it 
the right to buy euros at a maximum price.15 Suppose a one-year European call option on 
the euro with a strike price of $1.20 per euro trades for $0.05 per euro. That is, for a cost 
of $0.05 per euro, the firm can buy the right—but not the obligation—to purchase euros 
for $1.20 per euro in one year’s time. By doing so, the firm protects itself against a large 
increase in the value of the euro, but still benefits if the euro declines.
Table 30.2 shows the outcome from hedging with a call option if the actual exchange rate 
in one year is one of the values listed in the first column. If the spot exchange rate is less than 
the $1.20 per euro strike price of the option, the firm will not exercise the option and will 
convert dollars to euros at the spot exchange rate. If the spot exchange rate is more than $1.20 
per euro, the firm will exercise the option and convert dollars to euros at the rate of $1.20 per 
euro (see the second and third columns). We then add the initial cost of the option (fourth 
column) to determine the total dollar cost per euro paid by the firm (fifth column).16
15Currency options can be purchased over the counter from a bank or on an exchange. The Philadelphia 
Stock Exchange (PHLX, now part of NASDAQ OMX) is one exchange offering currency options.
16In computing the total cost, we have ignored the small amount of interest that could be earned on the 
option premium.

1071
We plot the data from Table 30.2 in Figure 30.6, where we compare hedging with options 
to the alternative of hedging with a forward contract or not hedging at all. If the firm does not 
hedge at all, its cost for euros is simply the spot exchange rate. If the firm hedges with a forward 
contract, it locks in the cost of euros at the forward exchange rate and the firm’s cost is fixed. 
As Figure 30.6 shows, hedging with options represents a middle ground: The firm puts a cap 
on its potential cost, but will benefit if the euro depreciates in value. (In this case, the actual 
exchange rate turned out to be $1.30/; in December 2006, for a total cost of $1.25.)
Options Versus Forward Contracts.  Why might a firm choose to hedge with options rather 
than forward contracts? Many managers want the firm to benefit if the exchange rate moves 
in their favor, rather than being stuck paying an above-market rate. Firms also prefer options 
to forward contracts if the transaction they are hedging might not take place. In this case, 
a forward contract could commit them to making an exchange at an unfavorable rate for 
currency they do not need, whereas an option allows them to walk away from the exchange.
Example 30.9
Using Options to Hedge a Conditional Exposure
Problem
ICTV is a U.S. company that develops software for cable television networks. Executives at 
ICTV have just negotiated a £20 million deal with British cable operator Telewest. ICTV will 
receive the payment in six months’ time, after ICTV demonstrates a prototype proving the via-
bility of its technology. If Telewest is not satisfied with the technology, it can cancel the contract 
at that time and pay nothing. ICTV executives have two major concerns: (1) their engineers may 
not be able to meet Telewest’s technology requirements and (2) even if the deal succeeds, the 
British pound may fall, reducing the dollar value of the £20 million payment.
Suppose the current exchange rate is $1.752/£, the six-month forward exchange rate is 
$1.75/£, and a six-month put option on the British pound with a strike price of $1.75/£ is 
trading for $0.05/£. Compare ICTV’s outcomes if it does not hedge, hedges using a forward 
contract, or hedges using the put option.
Solution
First, let’s plot ICTV’s revenue if it chooses not to hedge (the red lines in the plot):

Currency Option Pricing.  In the preceding example, we assumed that ICTV could pur-
chase a currency option at a price of $0.05/£. But how do we determine the price of 
a currency option? Just as we determined the forward exchange rate by assessing banks’ 
ability to replicate a forward contract using a cash-and-carry strategy, the prices of cur-
rency options are determined by identifying banks’ ability to replicate them using dynamic 
trading strategies of the type introduced in Chapter 21 for stock options. In fact, we can 
apply the same pricing methodologies discussed in Chapter 21, such as the Black-Scholes 
formula or the binomial model, to currency options. In this case, the underlying asset is the 
currency, so we use the spot exchange rate in place of the stock price. The foreign interest 
rate you earn while holding the currency is analogous to the dividend yield for a stock.
Recall that to price a European option on a dividend-paying stock, you simply replace 
the stock price, S, in the Black-Scholes formula with S x, the current value of the stock 
excluding any dividends paid during the life of the option. In the case of a currency option, 
we exclude the foreign interest earned, so that if r; is the foreign interest rate, then from 
Eq. 21.11, Sx = S/(1 + r;)T. Thus, the price of a European call option on the euro that 
expires in T years with a strike price of K dollars per euro is17
Price of a Call Option on a Currency
	
C =
S
(1 + r;)T  N(d1) -

(30.4)
where N() is the normal distribution function and d1 and d2 are calculated using the fact 
that S x/PV(K ) = FT/K, where FT is the forward exchange rate from Eq. 30.3:
	
d1 = ln(FT /K )
s2T
+ s2T
2  and d 2 = d 1 - s2T 
(30.5)
17This formula for the price of a currency option was first derived by M. Garman and S. Kohlhagen, 
“Foreign-Currency Option Values,” Journal of International Money and Finance 2 (1983): 231–237.
Suppose ICTV does not hedge, and the British pound falls to $1.50/£. Then, ICTV’s 
dollar revenue from the deal will be only £20 million * $1.50/£ = $30 million. However, if 
ICTV hedges the £20 million payment using a forward contract, it will be guaranteed rev-
enue of £20 million * $1.75/£ = $35 million if the deal succeeds (the upper blue line). But if 
Telewest cancels the deal, ICTV will still be obligated by the forward contract to pay the bank 
£20 million in exchange for $35 million. If the spot exchange rate rises to $2.00/£, then the 
£20 million will be worth £20 million * $2.00/£ = $40 million, and ICTV will have a loss of 
40 - 35 = $5 million on its forward contract (see the lower blue line).
Thus, if ICTV does not hedge or hedges with a forward contract, there are scenarios that lead 
to large losses. Now consider hedging with the put option. The upfront cost of the put option 
is £20 million * $0.05/£ = $1 million, and the results of this hedge are plotted as the yellow 
curves. For example, if the deal succeeds and the pound falls below $1.75/£, ICTV can exercise 
the put and receive, net of the cost of the put,
£20 million * $1.75/£ - $1 million = $35 million - $1 million = $34 million
(We have ignored the small amount of interest on the cost of the put over six months.) If Telewest 
cancels the deal and the spot exchange rate rises, ICTV will lose the $1 million cost of the put. 
In either case, Telewest has limited its potential losses.

30.4	 Interest Rate Risk
Firms that borrow must pay interest on their debt. An increase in interest rates raises firms’ 
borrowing costs and can reduce their profitability. In addition, many firms have fixed 
long-term future liabilities, such as capital leases or pension fund liabilities. A decrease in 
interest rates raises the present value of these liabilities and can lower the value of the firm. 
Thus, when interest rates are volatile, interest rate risk is a concern for many firms.
In this chapter, we have considered several methods that firms use to manage interest 
rate risk. Before firms can manage it, however, they must be able to measure it. Thus, we 
begin by discussing the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk, duration. We will 
then see how firms can use duration-hedging to minimize their interest rate risk.
Interest Rate Risk Measurement: Duration
In Chapter 6, we informally introduced the notion of a bond’s duration as a measure of its 
sensitivity to interest rate changes. There, we saw that the sensitivity of zero-coupon bonds 
to interest rates increases with their maturity. For example, for a 10-year, zero-coupon 
bond, an increase of one percentage point in the yield to maturity from 5% to 6% causes 
the bond price per $100 face value to fall from
100
1.0510 = $61.39 to 100
1.0610 = $55.84
or a price change of (55.84 - 61.39)/61.39 = -9%. The price of a five-year bond drops 
only 4.6% for the same yield change. The interest rate sensitivity of a single cash flow is 
roughly proportional to its maturity. The farther away the cash flow is, the larger the effect 
of interest rate changes on its present value.
Example 30.10
Implied Volatility of Exchange Rates
Problem
Suppose the current exchange rate is $1.752/£, the interest rate in the United States is 4.25%, 
the interest rate in the United Kingdom is 4.5%, and a six-month European call option on the 
British pound with a strike price of $1.75/£ trades for a price of $0.05/£. Use the Black-Scholes 
formula to determine the implied volatility of the $/£ exchange rate.
Solution
We can use Eq. 30.4 and Eq. 30.5 to compute the Black-Scholes price of a call option on the 
British pound. The inputs are S = spot exchange rate = 1.752, K = 1.75, T = 0.5, r$ = 4.25%, 
and the U.K. interest rate r£ = 4.5%. The forward exchange rate is F0.5 = 1.752 * 
(1.0425)1/2/(1.045)1/2 = 1.75. With a volatility of 10%, we have d1 = 0.035 and d2 = -0.035, 
with N(d1) = 0.514 and N(d2) = 0.486, so the Black-Scholes value of the call is $.048/£. With 
a volatility of 11%, the Black-Scholes value is $.055/£. Thus, the implied volatility of the $/£ 
exchange rate is between 10% and 11% per year.

1074	
Chapter 30  Risk Management
Now consider a bond or portfolio with multiple cash flows. How will its value change if 
interest rates rise? As we saw in Chapter 11, the return of a portfolio is the value-weighted 
average of the returns of the elements of the portfolio. Because the interest rate sensitivity 
of a cash flow depends on its maturity, the interest rate sensitivity of a security with mul-
tiple cash flows depends on their value-weighted maturity. Thus, we formally define a 
security’s duration as follows:18
Duration of a Security
	
Duration = a t
PV(Ct)
P
* t
(30.6)
where Ct is the cash flow on date t, PV(Ct) is its present value (evaluated at the bond’s 
yield), and P = a t PV(Ct) is the total present value of the cash flows, which is equal to 
the bond’s current price. Therefore, the duration weights each maturity t by the percentage 
contribution of its cash flow to the total present value, PV(Ct)/P.
18This measure is also called the Macaulay duration.
Example 30.11
The Duration of a Coupon Bond
Problem
What is the duration of a 10-year, zero-coupon bond? What is the duration of a 10-year bond 
with 10% annual coupons trading at par?
Solution
For a zero-coupon bond, there is only a single cash flow. Thus, in Eq. 30.6, PV(C10) = P and the 
duration is equal to the bond’s maturity of 10 years.
For the coupon bond, because the bond trades at par, its yield to maturity equals its 10% 
coupon rate. Table 30.3 shows the calculation of the duration of the bond using Eq. 30.6.
Note that, because the bond pays coupons prior to maturity, its duration is shorter than its 
10-year maturity. Moreover, the higher the coupon rate, the more weight is put on these earlier 
cash flows, shortening the duration of the bond.

30.4  Interest Rate Risk

Just as the interest rate sensitivity of a single cash flow increases with its maturity, the 
interest rate sensitivity of a stream of cash flows increases with its duration, as shown by 
the following result:
Duration and Interest Rate Sensitivity: If r, the APR used to discount a stream of cash flows, 
increases to r + e, where e is a small change, then the present value of the cash flows changes by 
approximately19
	
Percent Change in Value  -Duration *

(30.7)
where k is the number of compounding periods per year of the APR.
19The term Duration/(1 + r/k) is called the modified duration. Thus, Eq. 30.7 can also be written as
% change in value  -(Modified Duration) * e
To see how Eq. 30.7 is derived, note that the approximate price change for a small change in r is equal to 
the derivative of the price with respect to r:

Equation 30.7 follows by dividing by P to express the price change in percentage terms.
As we see, we can use duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of a security or a 
portfolio. We now consider ways firms can hedge this risk.
Duration-Based Hedging
A firm’s market capitalization is determined by the difference in the market value of its 
assets and its liabilities. If changes in interest rates affect these values, they will affect the 
firm’s equity value. We can measure a firm’s sensitivity to interest rates by computing the 
duration of its balance sheet. Moreover, by restructuring the balance sheet to reduce its 
duration, we can hedge the firm’s interest rate risk.
Example 30.12
Estimating Interest Rate Sensitivity Using Duration
Problem
Suppose the yield of a 10-year bond with 10% annual coupons increases from 10% to 10.25%. 
Use duration to estimate the percentage price change. How does it compare to the actual price 
change?
Solution
In Example 30.11, we found that the duration of the bond is 6.76 years. We can use Eq. 30.7 to 
estimate the percentage price change:
% Price Change  -6.76 * 0.25%
1.10 = -1.54%
Indeed, calculating the bond’s price with a 10.25% yield to maturity, we get

Chapter 30  Risk Management
Savings and Loans: An Example.  Consider a typical savings and loan (S&L). These insti-
tutions hold short-term deposits, in the form of checking and savings accounts, as well as 
certificates of deposit. They also make long-term loans such as car loans and home mort-
gages. Most S&Ls face a problem because the duration of the loans they make is generally 
longer than the duration of their deposits. When the durations of a firm’s assets and liabili-
ties are significantly different, the firm has a duration mismatch. This mismatch puts the 
S&L at risk if interest rates change significantly.
As an example, Table 30.4 provides the market-value balance sheet for Acorn Savings 
and Loan, listing the market value and duration of each asset and liability. What is the 
combined duration of Acorn’s assets and liabilities? The duration of a portfolio of invest-
ments is the value-weighted average of the durations of each investment in the portfolio. 
That is, a portfolio of securities with market values A and B and durations DA and DB, 
respectively, has the following duration:
Duration of a Portfolio
	
DA+B =
A
A + B
 DA +
B
A + B
 DB
(30.8)
Therefore, the duration of Acorn’s assets is
DA = 10
300
* 0 + 120
300
* 2 + 170
300
* 8 = 5.33 years
Similarly, the duration of Acorn’s liabilities is
DL = 120
285
* 0 + 90
285
* 1 + 75
285
* 12 = 3.47 years
Note the mismatch between Acorn’s assets and liabilities. Given their long duration, if 
interest rates rise, Acorn’s assets will fall in value much faster than its liabilities. As a result, 
the value of equity, which is the difference between assets and liabilities, may drop signifi-
cantly with a rise in interest rates.
In fact, we can calculate the duration of Acorn’s equity by expressing it as a portfolio 
that is long the assets and short the liabilities:
Equity = Assets - Liabilities

= 300
15
* 5.33 - 285
15
* 3.47 = 40.67 years
(30.9)
Therefore, if interest rates rise by 1%, the value of Acorn’s equity will fall by about 
40%. This decline in the value of equity will occur as a result of the value of Acorn’s assets 
decreasing by approximately 5.33% * 300 = $16 million, while the value of its liabilities 
decrease by only 3.47% * 285 = $9.9 million. Acorn’s market value of equity therefore 
declines by about 16 - 9.9 = $6.1 million or (6.1/15) = 40.67%.
How can Acorn reduce its sensitivity to interest rates? To fully protect its equity from an 
overall increase or decrease in the level of interest rates, Acorn needs an equity duration of 
zero. A portfolio with a zero duration is called a duration-neutral portfolio or an immu-
nized portfolio, which means that for small interest rate fluctuations, the value of equity 
should remain unchanged.
To make its equity duration neutral, Acorn must reduce the duration of its assets or 
increase the duration of its liabilities. The firm can lower the duration of its assets by sell-
ing some of its mortgages in exchange for cash. We compute the amount to sell from the 
following formula:20
Amount to Exchange =
Change in Portfolio Duration * Portfolio Value
Change in Asset Duration

(30.10)
To reduce its risk from interest rate fluctuations, Acorn would like to reduce the dura-
tion of its equity from 40.7 to 0. Because the duration of the mortgages will change from 
8 to 0 if the S&L sells the mortgages for cash, Eq. 30.10 implies that Acorn must sell 
(40.7 - 0) * 15/(8 - 0) = $76.3 million worth of mortgages. If it does so, the duration of 
its assets will decline to
10 + 76.3
300
* 0 + 120
300
* 2 + 170 - 76.3
300
* 8 = 3.30 years
Thus, its equity duration will fall to 300
15 * 3.30 - 285
15 * 3.47 = 0, as desired.
Adjusting a portfolio to make its duration neutral is sometimes referred to as 
­immunizing the portfolio, a term that indicates it is being protected against interest rate 
changes. Table 30.5 shows Acorn’s market-value balance sheet after immunization. Note 
that the duration of equity is now zero.
A Cautionary Note.  While duration matching is a useful method of interest rate risk 
management, it has some important limitations. First, the duration of a portfolio 
depends on the current interest rate. As interest rates change, the market values of the 
20To derive Eq. 30.10, let P be the value of the original portfolio and S be the amount of assets sold, and 
let DP and DS be their respective durations. Let DB be the duration of the new assets bought. Then, new

securities and cash flows in the portfolio change as well, which in turn alters the weights 
used when ­computing the duration as the value-weighted average maturity. Hence, 
maintaining a duration-neutral portfolio will require constant adjustment as interest 
rates change.21
The second important limitation is that a duration-neutral portfolio is only protected 
against interest rate changes that affect all yields identically. In other words, it offers protec-
tion in the case of parallel up or down movements in the yield curve. If short-term interest 
rates were to rise while long-term rates remained stable, then short-term securities would 
fall in value relative to long-term securities, despite their shorter duration. Additional 
methods (beyond the scope of this text) are required to hedge the risk of such changes in 
the slope of the yield curve.
Finally, even if assets have similar maturities, if the assets have different credit risks, 
duration-based hedging will not protect against fluctuations in the relative credit spreads 
of the assets. For example, during the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, Treasury interest 
rates fell dramatically, while at the same time the yields of similar maturity corporate bonds 
increased (e.g., see the Global Financial Crisis box on page 225 in Chapter 6.)
Swap-Based Hedging
Acorn Savings and Loan was able to reduce its interest rate sensitivity by selling assets. For 
most firms, selling assets is not an attractive prospect, as those assets are typically necessary 
to conduct the firms’ normal business operations. Interest rate swaps are an alternative 
means of modifying the firm’s interest rate risk exposure without buying or selling assets. 
An interest rate swap is a contract entered into with a bank, much like a forward contract, 
in which the firm and the bank agree to exchange the coupons from two different types 
21Another measure of interest rate sensitivity, convexity, provides a measure of the change in duration of 
a portfolio as interest rates change. For example, see F. Fabozzi, Duration, Convexity, and Other Bond Risk 
Measures (⁜渠屮⁜John Wiley & Sons, 1999).

of loans. In this section, we describe interest rate swaps and explore how they are used to 
manage interest rate risk.22
In a standard interest rate swap, one party agrees to pay coupons based on a fixed inter-
est rate in exchange for receiving coupons based on the prevailing market interest rate dur-
ing each coupon period. An interest rate that adjusts to current market conditions is called 
a floating rate. Thus, the parties exchange a fixed-rate coupon for a floating-rate coupon, 
which explains why this swap is also called a “fixed-for-floating interest rate swap.”
To demonstrate how an interest swap works, consider a five-year, $100 million interest 
rate swap with a 7.8% fixed rate. Standard swaps have semiannual coupons, so the fixed 
coupon amounts would be 1
2 (7.8% * $100 million) = $3.9 million every six months. The 
floating-rate coupons are typically based on a six-month market interest rate, such as the six-
month Treasury bill rate or the six-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).23 This 
rate varies over the life of the contract. Each coupon is calculated based on the six-month 
interest rate that prevailed in the market six months prior to the coupon payment date. 
Table 30.6 calculates the cash flows of the swap under a hypothetical scenario for LIBOR 
rates over the life of the swap. For example, at the first coupon date in six months, the fixed 
coupon is $3.9 million and the floating-rate coupon is 1
2 (6.8% * $10 million) = $3.4 mil-
lion, for a net payment of $0.5 million from the fixed- to the floating-rate payer.
Each payment of the swap is equal to the difference between the fixed- and floating-rate 
coupons. Unlike with an ordinary loan, there is no payment of principal. Because the $100 
million swap amount is used only to calculate the coupons but is never actually paid, it is 
referred to as the notional principal of the swap. Finally, there is no initial cash flow associated 
with the swap. That is, the swap contract—like forward and futures contracts—is typically 
structured as a “zero-cost” security. The fixed rate of the swap contract is set based on current 
market conditions so that the swap is a fair deal (i.e., has an NPV of zero) for both sides.
22Interest rate forward contracts, futures contracts, and options contracts also exist and can be used to 
manage interest rate risk. Swaps, however, are by far the most common strategy used by corporations.
23LIBOR is the rate at which major international banks with offices in London estimate they would be 
able to borrow in the interbank market. It is a common benchmark interest rate for swaps and other 
financial agreements. However, charges emerged in 2012 that some banks were skewing their estimates to 
manipulate LIBOR, prompting calls for its redefinition.

Chapter 30  Risk Management
Combining Swaps with Standard Loans.  Corporations use interest rate swaps routinely 
to alter their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The interest rate a firm pays on its loans 
can fluctuate for two reasons. First, the risk-free interest rate in the market may change. 
Second, the firm’s credit quality, which determines the spread the firm must pay over the 
risk-free interest rate, can vary over time. By combining swaps with loans, firms can choose 
which of these sources of interest rate risk they will tolerate and which they will eliminate. 
Let’s consider a typical example.
Alloy Cutting Corporation (ACC), a manufacturer of machine tools, is in the process of 
expanding its operations. It needs to borrow $10 million to fund this expansion. Currently, 
the six-month interest rate (LIBOR) is 4% and the 10-year interest rate is 6%—but these 
rates are for AA-rated firms. Given ACC’s low current credit rating, the bank will charge 
the firm a spread of 1% above these rates.
ACC’s managers are considering whether they should borrow on a short-term basis and 
then refinance the loan every six months or whether they should borrow using a long-term, 
10-year loan. If they borrow for the short term, they worry that if interest rates rise sub-
stantially, the higher interest rates they will have to pay when they refinance the debt could 
lead to financial distress for ACC. They can avoid this risk if they borrow for the long term 
and lock in the interest rate for 10 years. But long-term borrowing also has a downside. 
ACC’s managers believe that their firm’s credit rating will improve over the next few years 
as the expansion generates additional revenue. If they borrow using a 10-year loan, ACC 
will be stuck paying a spread based on its current credit quality.
Table  30.7 highlights these trade-offs. Borrowing long term has the advantage of 
­locking in interest rates, but the disadvantage of not allowing ACC to get the benefit of its 
improving credit quality. Borrowing short term enables ACC to benefit as its credit quality 
improves, but it risks an increase in interest rates.
In this situation, ACC can use an interest rate swap to combine the best of both 
­strategies. First, ACC can borrow the $10 million it needs for expansion using a short-term 
loan that is rolled over every six months. The interest rate on each loan will be rt + dt, 
where rt is the new (LIBOR) market rate and dt is the spread ACC must pay based on its 
credit rating at the time. Given ACC’s belief that its credit quality will improve over time, 
dt should decline from its current 1% level.
The Savings and Loan Crisis
In the late 1970s, many U.S. savings and loans were in 
exactly the same position as Acorn. The rates offered on 
deposits by S&Ls were highly regulated by the government, 
which encouraged these institutions to use their deposits to 
make long-term home loans at fixed rates to borrowers. As 
in our Acorn example, these S&Ls were especially vulner-
able to a rise in interest rates.
That increase in rates occurred in the early 1980s, with 
rates rising from less than 9% to more than 15% in less than 
one year. As a result, many S&Ls quickly became insolvent, 
with the value of their liabilities being close to or exceeding 
the value of their assets.
Most firms in this situation would be unable to raise 
new funds and would quickly default. However, because 
their deposits were protected by federal deposit insurance, 
these insolvent S&Ls were able to attract new depositors 
to pay off old ones and keep their doors open. Many of 
them embarked on a strategy of making very risky invest-
ments in junk bonds and other securities in hopes of a 
high return that would reestablish their solvency. (Recall 
the discussion in Chapter  16 regarding the incentives 
of equity holders to take excessive risk when the firm is 
near default.) Most of these risky investments also failed, 
compounding the S&Ls’ problems. By the late 1980s, the 
U.S. government had to shut down more than 50% of the 
nation’s S&Ls and fulfill its deposit insurance obligations 
by bailing out S&L depositors at a cost of more than $100 
billion to taxpayers.

Next, to eliminate the risk of an increase in the interest rate it will pay in the future, rt, 
ACC can enter into a 10-year interest rate swap in which it agrees to pay a fixed rate of 6% 
per year in exchange for receiving the floating rate rt.24 Combining the cash flows from the 
swap with ACC’s short-term borrowing, we can compute ACC’s net borrowing cost as 
follows:
Short@Term
Fixed Rate
Floating Rate
Net Borrowing
Loan Rate
Due on Swap
Received from Swap
Cost
rt + dt
+
6%
-
rt
=
6% + dt
That is, ACC will have an initial net borrowing cost of 7% (given its current credit spread 
of 1%), but this cost will decline in the future as its credit rating improves and the spread 
dt declines. At the same time, this strategy protects ACC from an increase in interest rates.
24The fixed rate on the swap corresponds to the 10-year market rate for a AA-rated borrower. ACC would 
be able to get this rate on a swap, even though it is not AA-rated, because there is very little credit risk in 
a swap (because there is no exchange of the $10 million principal associated with a swap contract). As a 
result, swap rates are relatively independent of the user’s credit quality.

Using Interest Rate Swaps
Problem
Bolt Industries is facing increased competition and wants to borrow $10 million in cash to pro-
tect against future revenue shortfalls. Currently, long-term AA rates are 10%. Bolt can borrow 
at 10.5% given its credit rating. The company is expecting interest rates to fall over the next 
few years, so it would prefer to borrow at short-term rates and refinance after rates drop. How-
ever, Bolt’s management is afraid that its credit rating may deteriorate as competition intensifies, 
which may greatly increase the spread the firm must pay on a new loan. How can Bolt benefit 
from declining interest rates without worrying about changes in its credit rating?
Solution
Bolt can borrow at the long-term rate of 10.5% and then enter into a swap in which it receives a 
fixed rate of 10% and pays the short-term rate rt. Its net borrowing cost will then be

Using a Swap to Change Duration.  Firms can also use interest rate swaps with duration-
hedging strategies. The value of a swap, while initially zero, will fluctuate over time as 
interest rates change. When interest rates rise, the swap’s value will fall for the party receiv-
ing the fixed rate; conversely, it will rise for the party paying the fixed rate.
For the party receiving the fixed rate, we can calculate the interest rate sensitivity of a swap 
by thinking of it as a portfolio that is long a long-term bond and short a short-term bond, each 
with a face value equal to the notional principal. Thus, a 10-year, $10 million interest swap 
with a 6% fixed rate is equivalent to a portfolio that is long a 10-year, $10 million bond with 
a 6% coupon rate, and short a six-month, $10 million bond at the current short-term rate. 
Likewise, the party paying the fixed rate is short a 10-year bond and long a six-month bond.
A swap contract will therefore alter the duration of a portfolio according to the differ-
ence in the duration of the corresponding long-term and short-term bonds. We can apply 
Eq. 30.10 to compute the notional principal required to achieve a particular change in 
duration. Used in this way, swaps are a convenient way to alter the duration of a portfolio 
without buying or selling assets.
Example 30.14
Using a Swap to Immunize a Portfolio
Problem
How can Acorn Savings and Loan use a swap to hedge its interest rate exposure rather than sell 
its mortgages?
Solution
Acorn needs to reduce the duration of its $15 million in equity from 40.7 to 0. To compute the 
correct notional amount of the swap, we must first compute the duration of a current 10-year bond. 
Suppose the duration is 6.76. The duration of a six-month bond is 0.5. Then, from Eq. 30.10,
N =
40.7 * 15
(6.76 - 0.5) = $97.5 million
Acorn should enter into a swap with the notional amount of $97.5 million. Because Acorn 
would like to reduce the duration of its equity, it should enter into a swap of this size in which 
it pays fixed and receives floating interest rates, as this swap will increase in value if interest rates 
rise, immunizing its balance sheet.

2.	 How do firms manage interest rate risk?
Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
30.1  Insurance
	
n	 Insurance is a common method firms use to reduce risk. In a perfect market, the price of insur-
ance is actuarially fair. An actuarially fair insurance premium is equal to the present value of the 
expected loss:
	
Pr(Loss) * E [Payment in the Event of Loss]
1 + rL

(30.1)

	
n	 Insurance for large risks that cannot be well diversified has a negative beta, which raises its cost.
	
n	 The value of insurance comes from its ability to reduce the cost of market imperfections for the 
firm. Insurance may be beneficial to a firm because of its effects on bankruptcy and financial 
distress costs, issuance costs, taxes, debt capacity, and risk assessment.
	
n	 The costs of insurance include administrative and overhead costs, adverse selection, and moral 
hazard.
30.2  Commodity Price Risk
	
n	 Firms use several risk management strategies to hedge their exposure to commodity price 
movements.
n	 Firms can make real investments in assets with offsetting risk using techniques such as verti-
cal integration and storage.
n	 Firms can enter into long-term contracts with suppliers or customers to achieve price 
stability.
n	 Firms can hedge risk by trading commodity futures contracts in financial markets.
n	 Futures contracts eliminate credit risk of long-term contracts via margin requirements, 
marking to market, and daily settlement.
n	 While futures contracts are liquid and therefore easy to enter into or cancel, they expose the 
firm to liquidity risk from possible margin calls, as well as basis risk if the hedge is imperfect.
30.3  Exchange Rate Risk
	
n	 Firms can manage exchange rate risk in financial markets using currency forward contracts 
to lock in an exchange rate in advance and currency option contracts to protect against an 
exchange rate moving beyond a certain level.
	
n	 The cash-and-carry strategy is an alternative strategy that provides the same cash flows as the 
currency forward contract. By the Law of One Price, we determine the forward exchange rate 
by the cost-of-carry formula, called the covered interest parity equation. For an exchange that 
will take place in T years, the corresponding forward exchange rate (in $/;) is:
	
FT = S *
(1 + r$)T
(1 + r;)T 
(30.3)
	
n	 Currency options allow firms to insure themselves against the exchange rate moving beyond a 
certain level. A firm may choose to use options rather than forward contracts if
n	 It would like to benefit from favorable exchange rate movements but not be obligated to 
make an exchange at unfavorable rates.
n	 There is some chance that the transaction it is hedging will not take place.
	
n	 Currency options can be priced (in $/;) using the Black-Scholes formula, with the foreign 
interest rate as a dividend yield:
	
C =
S
(1 + r;)T N(d1) -
K
(1 + r$)T N(d2)
(30.4)
	
	
where
	
d1 = ln(FT /K  )
s2T
+ s2T
2
 and d2 = d1 - s2T 
(30.5)
	
n	 Firms face interest rate risk when exchange rates are volatile. The primary tool they use to measure 
interest rate risk is duration. Duration measures the value-weighted maturity of an asset.
	
Duration = a t

30.4  Interest Rate Risk
	
n	 The interest rate sensitivity of a stream of cash flows increases with its duration. For a small 
change, e, in the interest rate, the change in the present value of a stream of cash flows is given by
	
Percent Change in Value  -Duration *
e
1 + r/k
(30.7)
	
	where r is the current interest rate, expressed as an APR with k compounding periods per year.
	
n	 The duration of a portfolio is equal to the value-weighted average duration of each security in 
the portfolio. The duration of a firm’s equity is determined from the duration of its assets and 
liabilities:
	
DE = DA-L =
A
A - L
 DA -
L
A - L
 DL
(30.9)
	
n	 Firms manage interest rate risk by buying or selling assets to make their equity duration 
neutral.
	
n	 Interest rate swaps allow firms to separate the risk of interest rate changes from the risk of fluc-
tuations in the firm’s credit quality.
n	 By borrowing long term and entering into an interest rate swap in which the firm receives a 
fixed coupon and pays a floating-rate coupon, the firm will pay a floating interest rate plus a 
spread that is fixed based on its initial credit quality.
n	 By borrowing short term and entering into an interest rate swap in which the firm receives 
a floating-rate coupon and pays a fixed coupon, the firm will pay a fixed interest rate plus a 
spread that will float with its credit quality.
	
n	 Firms use interest rate swaps to modify their interest rate risk exposure without buying or sell-
ing assets.

2.	 Genentech’s main facility is located in South San Francisco. Suppose that Genentech would 
experience a direct loss of $550 million in the event of a major earthquake that disrupted its 
operations. The chance of such an earthquake is 2.5% per year, with a beta of -0.25.

of​ oil, at the current futures price of $60 per barrel. Suppose futures prices change each day 
as follows:

a.	 What is the mark-to-market profit or loss (in dollars) that you will have on each date?
b.	 What is your total profit or loss after 10 days? Have you been protected against a rise in oil 
prices?

9.	 You are a broker for frozen seafood products for Choyce Products. You just signed a deal with a 
Belgian distributor. Under the terms of the contract, in one year you will deliver 3600 kilograms 
of frozen king crab for 102,000 euros. Your cost for obtaining the king crab is $106,000. All 
cash flows occur in exactly one year.
a.	 Plot your profits in one year from the contract as a function of the exchange rate in one year,

b.	 Suppose the one-year forward exchange rate is $1.25/;€ and that you enter into a forward 
contract to sell the euros you will receive at this rate. In the figure from part (a), plot your 
combined profits from the crab contract and the forward contract as a function of the 
exchange rate in one year. Label this line “Forward Hedge.”
c.	 Suppose that instead of using a forward contract, you consider using options. A one-year call 
option to buy euros at a strike price of $1.25/;€ is trading for $0.18/;€. Similarly a one year 
put option to sell euros at a strike price of $1.25/;€ is trading for $0.18/;€. To hedge the risk 
of your profits, should you buy or sell the call or the put?
d.	In the figure from parts (a) and (b), plot your “all in” profits using the option hedge (com-
bined profits of crab contract, option contract, and option price) as a function of the 
exchange rate in one year. Label this line “Option Hedge.” (Note: You can ignore the effect 
of interest on the option price.)
e.	 Suppose that by the end of the year, a trade war erupts, leading to a European embargo on 
U.S. food products. As a result, your deal is cancelled, and you don’t receive the euros or 
incur the costs of procuring the crab. However, you still have the profits (or losses) associ-
ated with your forward or options contract. In a new figure, plot the profits associated with 
the forward hedge and the options hedge (labeling each line). When there is a risk of cancel-
lation, which type of hedge has the least downside risk? Explain briefly.

at LIBOR versus the 8.1% fixed rate.

IN the 1990s, StarBUCKS COFFee COMpaNY IDeNtIFIeD JapaN as a 
potentially lucrative new market for its coffee products and decided to invest as much as 
$10 million in fiscal year 1996 to begin operations there. Because Starbucks realized it 
needed specialized knowledge of the Japanese market, it established a joint venture with 
Sazaby, Inc., a Japanese retailer and restaurateur. This venture, called Starbucks Coffee 
Japan Ltd., intended to open as many as 12 stores in this initial phase. Although stores 
opened more slowly than expected, the venture had more than 200 stores and sales 
of ¥29 billion ($252 million) by 2001, and it opened its 500th store in November 
2003. To finance this growth, Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd. used the Japanese capital 
markets. It held an initial public offering of shares on the Osaka Stock Exchange in Octo-
ber 2001 with a market capitalization of ¥90.88 billion ($756 million), raising ¥18.8 
billion ($156 ­million) in additional capital for expansion. As of 2015, Starbucks had over 
1000 stores in Japan. How did Starbucks’ managers decide to undertake this investment 
opportunity? Why did they decide to use the Japanese domestic market to finance it 
rather than U.S. markets?
This chapter focuses on some of the factors a firm faces when making a foreign 
investment that it does not encounter when making a domestic investment. There are 
three key issues that arise when considering an investment in a foreign project like 
­Starbucks Coffee Japan Ltd.:
n	 The project will most likely generate foreign currency cash flows, although the 
firm cares about the home currency value of the project.
n	 Interest rates and costs of capital will likely be different in the foreign country 
as a result of the macroeconomic environment.
n	 The firm will probably face a different tax rate in the foreign ­country and will be 
subject to both foreign and domestic tax codes.

Chapter 31  International Corporate Finance
As a first step toward evaluating foreign projects, this chapter discusses international capital 
markets. We begin by examining internationally integrated capital markets, which provide a useful 
benchmark for comparing different methods of valuing a foreign project. We next explain how to 
value a foreign project and address the three key issues mentioned above. We then value foreign 
currency cash flows using two valuation methodologies and consider the implications of foreign 
and domestic tax codes. Finally, we explore the implications of internationally segmented capital 
markets.
	
31.1	 Internationally Integrated Capital Markets
We begin our examination of valuing foreign projects by developing a conceptual bench-
mark based on the integration of capital markets across currencies and borders. In this 
framework, capital markets are internationally integrated when the value of a foreign 
investment does not depend on the currency (home or foreign) we use in the analysis.
Consider a risky foreign asset that is expected to pay the cash flow, CFC, in one period. 
In a normal market, the price of this asset in a foreign market is the present value of this 
cash flow using the cost of capital of a local investor:
	
CFC /(1 + rFC
* )
(31.1)
 A U.S. investor who wants to purchase this asset in dollars will have to pay
	
S *
CFC
(1 + r*FC)

(31.2)
where S is the current spot exchange rate in dollars per foreign currency. Now any U.S. 
investor who actually purchased this security would have to convert the future cash flow 
into dollars, so the payoff to such an investor is the dollar cash flow it produces. To value 
this cash flow, assume that the U.S. investor contracts today to convert the expected cash 
flow in one period at the forward rate, F, quoted as dollars per foreign currency. If we 
assume that spot exchange rates and the foreign currency cash flows of the security are 
uncorrelated, then this U.S. investor’s expected dollar cash flow is F * CFC.1 If r$* is the 
appropriate cost of capital from the standpoint of a U.S. investor, the present value of this 
expected cash flow is
	
F * CFC
(1 + r*$)

(31.3)
By the Law of One Price, this value must be equal to what the U.S. investor paid for the 
security:
S *
CFC
(1 + r*FC)
=
F * CFC
(1 + r*$)
1The actual cash flow in foreign currency will be CFC + e where e is the uncertainty in the cash flow and has 
an expected value of zero. In U.S. dollars, this cash flow is F * CFC + S1 * e because the forward contract 
is only for the amount CFC; the rest must be converted at the prevailing spot rate in one period, S1. Then, 
because spot rates are uncorrelated with the project cash flows, E[S1 * e] = E[S1] * E[e] = E[S1] * 0 = 0.

	
31.2  Valuation of Foreign Currency Cash Flows	
1093
Rearranging terms gives
	
F =
(1 + r*$ )
(1 + r*FC)
 S
(31.4)
This condition ought to look familiar from Chapter 30, because Eq. 31.4 is simply covered 
interest parity, here derived for risky rather than riskless discount rates.
At this point, it is worth taking a step back and considering the assumptions specific to the 
international context that we needed to derive Eq. 31.4. Recall from Chapter 3 that in a nor-
mal market, prices are competitive. In this context, this concept means, among other things, 
that any investor can exchange either currency in any amount at the spot rate or forward rates, 
and is free to purchase or sell any security in any amount in either country at their current 
market prices. Under these conditions, which we term internationally integrated capital 
markets, the value of an investment does not depend on the currency we use in the analysis.
Concept Check	
1.	 What assumptions are necessary for internationally integrated capital markets?
	
2.	 What implication do internationally integrated capital markets have for the value of the same 
asset in different countries?
	
31.2	 Valuation of Foreign Currency Cash Flows
The most obvious difference between a domestic project and a foreign project is that the 
foreign project will most likely generate cash flows in a foreign currency. If the foreign 
project is owned by a domestic corporation, managers and shareholders need to determine 
the home currency value of the foreign currency cash flows.
In an internationally integrated capital market, two equivalent methods are available for 
calculating the NPV of a foreign project: Either we can calculate the NPV in the foreign 
Example 31.1
Present Values and Internationally Integrated Capital Markets
Problem
You are an American who is trying to calculate the present value of a ¥10 million cash flow that 
will occur one year in the future. You know that the spot exchange rate is S = ¥110/$ and the 
one-year forward rate is F = ¥105.8095/$. You also know that the appropriate dollar cost of 
capital for this cash flow is r$* = 5% and that the appropriate yen cost of capital for this cash 
flow is r* = 1%. What is the present value of the ¥10 million cash flow from the standpoint of 
a Japanese investor, and what is the dollar equivalent of this amount? What is the present value 
of the ¥10 million cash flow from the standpoint of a U.S. investor who first converts the ¥10 
million into dollars, and then applies the dollar discount rate?
Solution
The present value of the yen cash flow is ¥10,000,000/(1.01) = ¥9,900,990, and the dollar equiv-
alent is ¥9,900,990/(110 ¥/$) = $90,009. (Note that we adjusted the formula in Eq. 31.2 because 
the exchange rate is expressed as yen per dollar rather than dollars per yen.) The present value from 
the standpoint of a U.S. investor who first converts the ¥10 million into dollars using the forward 
rate and then applies the dollar cost of capital is (¥10,000,000 , 105.8095 ¥/$)/1.05 = $90,009. 
(Again, we have adjusted the formula in Eq. 31.3 because the exchange rate is expressed as yen per 
dollar.) Because the U.S. and Japanese capital markets are internationally integrated, both methods 
produce the same result.

country and convert it to the local currency at the spot rate, or we can convert the cash 
flows of the foreign project into the local currency and then calculate the NPV of these cash 
flows. The first method is essentially what we have done throughout this book (­calculating 
the NPV of a project in a single currency) with the added step at the end of converting the 
NPV into the local currency using spot rates. Because this method should be familiar to 
you at this stage, we will concentrate on the second method.
WACC Valuation Method in Domestic Currency
The second valuation method requires converting the expected dollar value of the for-
eign currency cash flows and then proceeding to value the project as if it were a domestic 
project.
Application: Ityesi, Inc.  Ityesi, Inc., a manufacturer of custom packaging products 
headquartered in the United States, wants to apply the weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC) technique to value a project in the United Kingdom. Ityesi is considering intro-
ducing a new line of packaging in the United Kingdom that will be its first foreign project. 
The project will be completely self-contained within the United Kingdom, such that all 
revenues are generated and all costs are incurred there.
Engineers expect the technology used in the new products to be obsolete after four 
years. The marketing group expects annual sales of £37.5 million per year for this product 
line. Manufacturing costs and operating expenses are expected to total £15.625 million 
and £5.625 million per year, respectively. Developing the product will require an upfront 
investment of £15 million in capital equipment that will be obsolete in four years, and 
an initial marketing expense of £4.167 million. Ityesi pays a corporate tax rate of 40% 
regardless of where it manufactures its products. The expected pound free cash flows of the 
proposed project are projected in the spreadsheet in Table 31.1.
Ityesi’s managers have determined that there is no correlation between the uncer-
tainty in these cash flows and the uncertainty in the spot dollar-pound exchange rate. As 
we explained in the last section, under this condition, the expected value of the future 
cash flows in dollars is the expected value in pounds multiplied by the forward exchange 
rate. Obtaining forward rate quotes for as long as four years in the future is difficult, so

Ityesi’s managers have decided to use the covered interest rate parity formula (Eq. 30.3 in 
­Chapter 30) to compute the forward rates.
Forward Exchange Rates.  The current spot exchange rate, S, is $1.60/£. Suppose that the 
yield curve in both countries is flat: The risk-free rate on dollars, r$, is 4%, and the risk-free 
interest rate on pounds, r£, is 7%. Using the covered interest parity condition for a multi-
year forward exchange rate (Eq. 30.3):
 F1 = S *
(1 + r$)
(1 + r£) = ($1.60/£) (1.04)
(1.07) = $1.5551/£
 F2 = S *
(1 + r$)2
(1 + r£)2 = ($1.60/£) (1.04)2
(1.07)2 = $1.5115/£
 F3 = S *
(1 + r$)3
(1 + r£)3 = ($1.60/£) (1.04)3
(1.07)3 = $1.4692/£
 F4 = S *
(1 + r$)4
(1 + r£)4 = ($1.60/£) (1.04)4
(1.07)4 = $1.4280/£
Free Cash Flow Conversion.  Using these forward exchange rates, we can now calculate 
the expected free cash flows in dollars by multiplying the expected cash flows in pounds by 
the forward exchange rate, as shown in the spreadsheet in Table 31.2.
The Value of Ityesi’s Foreign Project with WACC.  With the cash flows of the U.K. proj-
ect now expressed in dollars, we can value the foreign project as if it were a domestic U.S. 
project. We proceed, as we did in Chapter 18, under the assumption that the market risk 
of the U.K. project is similar to that of the company as a whole. As a consequence, we can 
use Ityesi’s costs of equity and debt in the United States to calculate the WACC.2
Ityesi has built up $20 million in cash for investment needs and has debt of $320 ­million, 
so its net debt is D = 320 - 20 = $300 million. This amount is equal to the ­market value 
of its equity, implying a (net) debt-equity ratio of 1. Ityesi intends to maintain a similar 
(net) debt-equity ratio for the foreseeable future. The WACC thus assigns equal weights to 
equity and debt (Table 31.3).
2The risk of the foreign project is unlikely to be exactly the same as the risk of domestic projects (or the 
firm as a whole), because it may be exposed to foreign economic and exchange rate risk factors. Ityesi’s 
managers have assessed these additional risks to be small, and so for practical purposes have chosen to 
ignore it. Alternatively, one could estimate a domestic cost of capital for the project based on return data 
for a foreign firm in the same industry with stock that is traded on the U.S. market.

Chapter 31  International Corporate Finance
With Ityesi’s cost of equity at 10% and its cost of debt at 6%, we calculate Ityesi’s 
WACC as follows:
 rwacc =
E
E + D
 rE +
D
E + D
 rD(1 - tC)
 = (0.5)(10.0%) + (0.5)(6.0%)(1 - 40%) = 6.8%
We can now determine the value of the foreign project, including the tax shield from 
debt, by calculating the present value of the future free cash flows using the WACC:
17.495
1.068 + 17.004
1.0682 + 16.528
1.0683 + 16.065
1.0684 = $57.20 million
Because the upfront cost of launching the product line in dollars is only $28 million, 
the net present value is 57.20 - 28 = $29.20 million. Thus, Ityesi should undertake the 
U.K. project.
Using the Law of One Price as a Robustness Check
To arrive at the NPV of Ityesi’s project requires making a number of assumptions—for 
example, that international markets are integrated, and that the exchange rate and the cash 
flows of the project are uncorrelated. The managers of Ityesi will naturally worry about 
whether these assumptions are justified. Luckily, there is a way to check the analysis.
Recall that there are two ways to compute the NPV of the foreign project. Ityesi could 
just have easily computed the foreign NPV by discounting the foreign cash flows at the 
foreign cost of capital and converting this result to a domestic NPV using the spot rate. 
Except for the last step, this method requires doing the same calculation we have per-
formed throughout this book—that is, calculate the NPV of a (domestic) project. Deter-
mining the NPV requires knowing the cost of capital—in this case, the cost of capital 
for an investment in the United Kingdom. Recall that to estimate this cost of capital we 
use return data for publicly traded single-product companies—in this case, U.K. firms. 
For this method to provide the same answer as the alternative method, the estimate for 
the foreign cost of capital, r£*, must satisfy the Law of One Price, which from Eq. 31.4 
implies:
	
(1 + r£*) = S
F
 (1 + r$*)	
(31.5)
If it does not, then Ityesi’s managers should be concerned that the simplifying assump-
tions in their analysis are not valid: Either there are market frictions that prevent inte-
gration, or there is a significant correlation between the project’s cash flows and the 
exchange rate.

We can further interpret Eq. 31.5 by using the covered interest rate parity relation 
derived in Chapter 30 (Eq. 30.3):
	
S
F =
1 + r£
1 + r$
	
(31.6)
where r£ and r$ are the foreign and domestic risk-free interest rates, respectively. Combin-
ing Eq. 31.5 and Eq. 31.6 and rearranging terms gives the foreign cost of capital in terms 
of the domestic cost of capital and interest rates:
The Foreign-Denominated Cost of Capital
 r*£ =
1 + r£
1 + r$
 (1 + r*$) - 1
	
  r£ + (r*$ - r$)
(31.7)
In other words, the foreign risk premium is approximately equal to the domestic risk 
premium, so the foreign cost of capital is roughly equal to the foreign risk-free rate plus the 
domestic risk premium. If the simplifying assumptions Ityesi made in calculating the NPV 
of its U.K. project are valid, then the cost of capital estimate calculated using Eq. 31.7 will 
be close to the cost of capital estimate calculated directly using comparable single-product 
companies in the United Kingdom.
Example 31.2
Internationalizing the Cost of Capital
Problem
Use the Law of One Price to infer the pound WACC from Ityesi’s dollar WACC. Verify that the 
NPV of Ityesi’s project is the same when its pound free cash flows are discounted at this WACC 
and converted at the spot rate.
Solution
Using Eq. 31.7 to compute the pound WACC gives
r*£ =
1 + r£
1 + r$
 (1 - r*$) - 1¢ 1.07
1.04≤(1.068) - 1 = 0.0988
The pound WACC is 9.88%.
We can now use Ityesi’s pound WACC to calculate the present value of the pound free cash 
flows in Table 31.3:
11.25
1.0988 + 11.25
1.09882 + 11.25
1.09883 + 11.25
1.09884 = £35.75 million
The NPV in pounds of the investment opportunity is 35.75 - 17.5 = £18.25 million. ­Converting 
this amount to dollars at the spot rate gives £18.25 million * 1.6$/£ = $29.20 million, which is 
exactly the NPV we calculated before.

31.3	 Valuation and International Taxation
In this chapter, we assume that Ityesi pays a corporate tax rate of 40% no matter where its 
earnings are generated. In practice, determining the corporate tax rate on foreign income 
is complicated because corporate income taxes must be paid to two national governments: 

1098	
Chapter 31  International Corporate Finance
the host government (the United Kingdom in this example) and the home government 
(the United States). If the foreign project is a separately incorporated subsidiary of the par-
ent, the amount of taxes a firm pays generally depends on the amount of profits repatri-
ated (brought back to the home country).
Single Foreign Project with Immediate Repatriation of Earnings
We begin by assuming that the firm has a single foreign project and that all foreign profits 
are repatriated immediately. The general international arrangement prevailing with respect 
to taxation of corporate profits is that the host country gets the first opportunity to tax 
income produced within its borders. The home government then gets an opportunity to 
tax the income from a foreign project to the domestic firm. In particular, the home gov-
ernment must establish a tax policy specifying its treatment of foreign income and foreign 
taxes paid on that income. In addition, it needs to establish the timing of taxation.
U.S. tax policy requires U.S. corporations to pay taxes on their foreign income at the 
same rate as profits earned in the United States. However, a full tax credit is given for 
foreign taxes paid up to the amount of the U.S. tax liability. In other words, if the foreign 
tax rate is less than the U.S. tax rate, the company pays total taxes equal to the U.S. tax rate 
on its foreign earnings. In this case, all of the company’s earnings are taxed at the same rate 
no matter where they are earned—the working assumption we used for Ityesi.
If the foreign tax rate exceeds the U.S. tax rate, companies must pay this higher rate on 
foreign earnings. Because the U.S. tax credit exceeds the amount of U.S. taxes owed, no tax 
is owed in the United States. Note that U.S. tax policy does not allow companies to apply 
the part of the tax credit that is not used to offset domestic taxes owed, so this extra tax 
credit is wasted. In this scenario, companies pay a higher tax rate on foreign income and a 
lower (U.S.) tax rate on income generated in the United States.
Multiple Foreign Projects and Deferral of Earnings Repatriation
Thus far, we have assumed that the firm has only one foreign project and that it repatri-
ates earnings immediately. Neither assumption is realistic. Firms can lower their taxes by 
pooling multiple foreign projects and deferring the repatriation of earnings. Let’s begin by 
considering the benefits of pooling the income on all foreign projects.
Pooling Multiple Foreign Projects.  Under U.S. tax law, multinational corporations may 
use any excess tax credits generated in high-tax foreign countries to offset their net U.S. tax 
liabilities on earnings in low-tax foreign countries. Thus, if the U.S. tax rate exceeds the 
combined tax rate on all foreign income, it is valid to assume that the firm pays the same 
tax rate on all income no matter where it is earned. Otherwise, the firm must pay a higher 
tax rate on its foreign income.
Deferring Repatriation of Earnings.  Now consider an opportunity to defer repatriation 
of foreign profits. This consideration is important because U.S. tax liability is not incurred 
until the profits are brought back home, if the foreign operation is set up as a separately 
incorporated subsidiary (rather than as a foreign branch). If a company chooses not to repa-
triate £12.5 million in pre-tax earnings, for example, it effectively reinvests those earnings 
abroad and defers its U.S. tax liability. When the foreign tax rates exceed the U.S. tax rates, 
there are no benefits to deferral because in such a case there is no additional U.S. tax liability.
When the foreign tax rate is less than the U.S. tax rate, deferral can provide ­significant 
benefits. Deferring repatriation of earnings lowers the overall tax burden in much the same 
way as deferring capital gains lowers the tax burden imposed by the capital gains tax. Other 
benefits from deferral arise because the firm effectively gains a real option to repatriate 

	
31.4  Internationally Segmented Capital Markets	
1099
income at times when repatriation might be cheaper. For example, we have already noted 
that by pooling foreign income, the firm effectively pays the combined tax rate on all foreign 
income. Because the income generated across countries changes, this combined tax rate will 
vary from year to year. In years in which it exceeds the U.S. tax rate, the repatriation of 
additional income does not incur an additional U.S. tax liability, so the earnings can be 
repatriated tax-free. In addition, there have been occasions in the past when the U.S. Con-
gress has granted a “tax holiday,” allowing firms to repatriate funds at a temporarily reduced 
tax rate. For example, the American Jobs Creation Act passed in 2004 allowed firms to repa-
triate funds at a 5.25% tax rate rather than the standard 35% corporate tax rate.3
This tax treatment leads many U.S. firms with significant profits abroad to opt to defer 
repatriation and accumulate cash overseas. For instance, in July 2015, Cisco reported total 
cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet of over $60 billion. However, nearly 
90% of this cash was held overseas, with only $7 billion held in the United States.

31.4	 Internationally Segmented Capital Markets
To this point, we have worked under the assumption that international capital markets are 
integrated. Often, however, this assumption is not appropriate. In some countries, espe-
cially in the developing world, all investors do not have equal access to financial securities. 
In this section, we consider why countries’ capital markets might not be integrated—a case 
called segmented capital markets.
Many of the interesting questions in international corporate finance address the issues 
that result when capital markets are internationally segmented. In this section, we briefly 
consider the main reasons for segmentation of the capital markets and the implications for 
international corporate finance.
Differential Access to Markets
In some cases, a country’s risk-free securities are internationally integrated but markets for 
a specific firm’s securities are not. Firms may face differential access to markets if there is 
any kind of asymmetry with respect to information about them. For example, Ityesi may 
be well known in the United States and enjoy easy access to dollar equity and debt markets 
there because it regularly provides information to an established community of analysts 
tracking the firm. It may not be equally well known in the United Kingdom and, there-
fore, may have difficulty tapping into the pound capital markets because it has no track 
record there. For this reason, investors in the United Kingdom may require a higher rate of 
return to persuade them to hold pound stocks and bonds issued by the U.S. firm.
With differential access to national markets, Ityesi would face a higher pound WACC 
than the pound WACC implied by Eq. 31.7. Ityesi would then view the foreign project as 
less valuable if it raises capital in the United Kingdom rather than in the United States. In 
fact, to maximize shareholder value, the firm should raise capital at home; the method of 
valuing the foreign project as if it were a domestic project would then provide the correct 
NPV. Differential access to national capital markets is common enough that it provides the 
best explanation for the existence of currency swaps, which are like the interest rate swap 
3For further discussion see the “Repatriation Tax” box on page 557 in Chapter 15.

1100	
Chapter 31  International Corporate Finance
contracts we discussed in Chapter 30, but with the holder receiving coupons in one cur-
rency and paying coupons denominated in a different currency. Currency swaps generally 
also have final face value payments, also in different currencies. Using a currency swap, a 
firm can borrow in the market where it has the best access to capital, and then “swap” the 
coupon and principal payments to the currency in which it would prefer to make pay-
ments. Thus, swaps allow firms to mitigate their exchange rate risk exposure between assets 
and liabilities, while still making investments in the most profitable locales and raising 
funds where their cost of capital is lowest.
Macro-Level Distortions
Markets for risk-free instruments may also be segmented. Important macroeconomic rea-
sons for segmented capital markets include capital controls and foreign exchange controls 
that create barriers to international capital flows, and thus segment national markets. Many 
countries regulate or limit capital inflows or outflows, and many do not allow their cur-
rencies to be freely converted into dollars, thereby creating capital market segmentation. 
Similarly, some countries restrict who can hold financial securities.
Political, legal, social, and cultural characteristics that differ across countries may require 
compensation in the form of a country risk premium. For example, the rate of interest paid 
on government bonds or other securities in a country with a tradition of weak enforcement 
of property rights is likely not really a risk-free rate. Instead, interest rates in the country 
will reflect a risk premium for the possibility of default, so relations such as covered interest 
rate parity will not hold exactly.
Example 31.3
Risky Government Bonds
Problem
On July 27, 2009, the spot ruble-dollar exchange rate was R30.9845/$ and the one-year forward 
exchange rate was R33.7382/$. At the time, the yield on short-term Russian government bonds 
was about 11%, while the comparable one-year yield on U.S. Treasury securities was 0.5%. 
Using the covered interest parity relationship, calculate the implied one-year forward rate. Com-
pare this rate to the actual forward rate, and explain why the two rates differ.
Solution
Using the covered interest parity formula, the implied forward rate is
F = S *
(1 + rR)
(1 + r$) = (R30.9845/$)1.110
1.005 = R34.2217/$
The implied forward rate is higher than the current spot rate because Russian government bonds have 
higher yields than U.S. government bonds. The difference between the implied forward rate and the 
actual forward rate likely reflects the default risk in Russian government bonds (the Russian govern-
ment defaulted on its debt as recently as 1998). A holder of 100,000 rubles seeking a true risk-free 
investment could convert the rubles to dollars, invest in U.S. Treasuries, and convert the proceeds 
back to rubles at a rate locked in with a forward contract. By doing so, the investor would earn
R100,000
R30.9845/$ today
*
$1.005 in 1 year
$ today
* (R33.7382/$ in 1 year) = R109,432 in 1 year
for an effective ruble risk-free rate of 9.432%. The higher rate of 11% on Russian bonds reflects 
a credit spread of 11% - 9.432% = 1.568% to compensate bondholders for default risk.

	
31.4  Internationally Segmented Capital Markets	
1101
Example 31.4
Valuing a Foreign Acquisition in a Segmented Market
Problem
Camacho Enterprises is a U.S. company that is considering expanding by acquiring Xtapa, Inc., 
a firm in Mexico. The acquisition is expected to increase Camacho’s free cash flows by 21 million 
pesos the first year; this amount is then expected to grow at a rate of 8% per year. The price of 
the investment is 525 million pesos, which is $52.5 million at the current exchange rate of 10 
pesos/$. Based on an analysis in the Mexican market, Camacho has determined that the appro-
priate after-tax peso WACC is 12%. If Camacho has also determined that its after-tax dollar 
WACC for this expansion is 7.5%, what is the value of the Mexican acquisition? Assume that the 
Mexican and U.S. markets for risk-free securities are integrated and that the yield curve in both 
countries is flat. U.S. risk-free interest rates are 6%, and Mexican risk-free interest rates are 9%.
Solution
Let’s begin by calculating the NPV of the expansion in pesos and converting the result into dol-
lars at the spot rate. Putting the free cash flows on a timeline:
The net present value of these cash flows at the peso WACC is
NPV =
21
0.12 - 0.08 - 525 = 0
so the purchase is a zero-NPV transaction. Presumably, Camacho is competing with other Mexi-
can companies for the purchase, and they have bid up the price to the point that NPV = 0.
We can also compute the NPV in dollars by converting the expected cash flows into 
dollars using forward rates. The N-year forward rate (Eq. 30.3 in Chapter 30) expressed in 
pesos/$ is
FN = S *
(1 + rp)N
(1 + r$)N = 10 * a 1.09
1.06b
N
= 10 * 1.0283N = 10.283 * 1.0283N-1
Thus, the dollar expected cash flows are the peso cash flows (from the earlier timeline) converted 
at the appropriate forward rate (we divide by the forward rate because it is in pesos/$):
C p
N/FN =
21(1.08)N-1
10.283 * 1.0283N-1 = 2.0422 * 1.0503N-1

Implications
A segmented financial market has an important implication for international corporate 
finance: One country or currency has a higher rate of return than another country or 
currency, when the two rates are compared in the same currency. If the return difference 
results from a market friction such as capital controls, corporations can exploit this friction 
by setting up projects in the high-return country/currency and raising capital in the low-
return country/currency. Of course, the extent to which corporations can capitalize on this 
strategy is naturally limited: If such a strategy were easy to implement, the return difference 
would quickly disappear as corporations competed to use the strategy. Nevertheless, certain 
corporations might realize a competitive advantage by implementing such a strategy. For 
example, as an incentive to invest, a foreign government might strike a deal with a particu-
lar corporation that relaxes capital controls for that corporation alone.

1102	
Chapter 31  International Corporate Finance
The dollar expected cash flows are therefore
so the dollar cash flows grow at about 5% per year. The NPV of these cash flows is
NPV =
2.0422
0.075 - 0.0503 - 52.5 = $30.18 million
Which NPV more accurately represents the benefits of the expansion? The answer depends 
on the source of the difference. To compute the dollar expected cash flows by converting the 
peso expected cash flows at the forward rate, we must accept the assumption that spot rates and 
the project cash flows are uncorrelated. The difference might simply reflect that this assumption 
failed to hold. Another possibility is that the difference reflects estimation error in the respective 
WACC estimates.
If Camacho is relatively confident in its assumptions about spot rates and its WACC ­estimates, 
a third possibility is that Mexican and U.S. capital markets are not integrated. In this case, 
Camacho, because of its access to U.S. capital markets, might have a competitive ­advantage. 
Perhaps other companies with which it is competing for the purchase of Xtapa are all Mexican 
firms that do not have access to capital markets outside of Mexico. Hence Camacho can raise 
capital at a cheaper rate. Of course, this argument also requires that other U.S. companies are 
not competing for the purchase of Xtapa. Camacho, however, might have special knowledge of 
Xtapa’s markets that other U.S.-based companies lack. This knowledge would give Camacho a 
competitive advantage in the product market over other U.S. companies and puts it on an equal 
footing in the product market with other Mexican companies. Because it has a competitive 
advantage in capital markets over other Mexican companies, the NPV of the purchase is positive 
for Camacho, but zero for the other bidders for Xtapa.

31.5	 Capital Budgeting with Exchange Risk
The final issue that arises when a firm is considering a foreign project is that the cash flows 
of the project may be affected by exchange rate risk. The risk is that the cash flows gener-
ated by the project will depend upon the future level of the exchange rate. A large part of 
international corporate finance addresses this foreign exchange risk. This section offers an 
overview with respect to valuation of foreign currency cash flows.
The working assumptions made thus far in this chapter are that the project’s free cash 
flows are uncorrelated with the spot exchange rates. Such an assumption often makes sense 
if the firm operates as a local firm in the foreign market—it purchases its inputs and sells its 

	
31.5  Capital Budgeting with Exchange Risk	
1103
outputs in that market, and price changes of the inputs and outputs are uncorrelated with 
exchange rates. However, many firms use imported inputs in their production processes 
or export some of their output to foreign countries. These scenarios alter the nature of a 
project’s foreign exchange risk and, in turn, change the valuation of the foreign currency 
cash flows.
As an example, let’s reconsider what happens if the Ityesi project in the United Kingdom 
imports some materials from the United States. In this case, the project’s pound free 
cash flows will be correlated with exchange rates. Assuming the cost of the material in 
the United States remains stable, if the value of a dollar appreciates against the pound, 
the  pound cost of these materials will increase, thereby reducing the pound free cash 
flows. The reverse is also true: If the dollar depreciates, then the pound free cash flows will 
increase. Hence, our working assumption that changes in the free cash flows are uncor-
related with changes in the exchange rate is violated, and it is no longer appropriate to 
calculate the expected dollar free cash flows by converting the expected pound free cash 
flows at the forward rate.

QUESTION: What are the benefits to 
being international?
ANSWER: When a business seeks growth, 
sooner or later it must look at the 
­international market. In today’s world, 
you are usually involved in international 
business because so much production 
and manufacturing occurs in China. We have had long-
standing relationships with Chinese companies and have been 
importing from China and Japan for 30 years. We have also 
invested and become partners in other businesses: one in India, 
another in Africa, in Europe, and in the United Kingdom.
QUESTION: How have currency exchange rates affected your 
company?
ANSWER: Currency fluctuations have huge implications. If the 
marketplace was used to buying something at $1 Canadian but 
now, due to an exchange rate change, it is $1.20 Canadian, that 
is a really tough situation to manage. Sometimes we hedge. We 
buy options on currency. We buy forwards on currency. We try 
to anticipate and protect ourselves by buy-
ing into the future. We never buy 100% 
into the future but we hedge 50 to 70% 
of our exposure.
QUESTION: Are there any important 
international tax considerations you face?
ANSWER: International tax rules affect 
where and how we do business. We are 
an Atlantic Canadian company. We form 
holding companies in various parts of the 
world depending upon the tax implica-
tions. In a specific instance in India, we 
determined that by manufacturing in 
China and exporting to India, we would 
face a huge import duty. The solution was 
to manufacture in India; by doing so, we 
saved about 27% in tax.
QUESTION: Do you get involved in joint ventures, licensing 
agreements, etc., or do you access other countries directly?
ANSWER: We do business in a variety of ways, including 
joint venture relationships, distribution relationships, and 
agency relationships. There are many countries that have 
such complex regulatory issues that a joint venture is the only 
practical way to go. In other situations, like the European 
Union, there is a common set of regulatory, tax, and deploy-
ment issues in terms of how people are hired, what your obli-
gations are to them, and what their obligations are to you.

Chapter 31  International Corporate Finance
Whenever a project has cash flows that depend on the values of multiple currencies, the 
most convenient approach is to separate the cash flows by currency. For example, a fraction 
of Ityesi’s manufacturing costs may be for inputs whose cost fluctuates with the value of 
the dollar. Specifically, suppose £5.625 million of the costs are denominated in pounds, 
and an additional $16 million (or £10 million at the current exchange rate of $1.60/£) is 
for inputs whose price fluctuates with the value of the dollar. Then we can calculate Ityesi’s 
pound-denominated free cash flows excluding these dollar-based costs, as in Table 31.4.
If the revenues and costs in the spreadsheet in Table 31.4 are not affected by changes 
in the spot exchange rates, it makes sense to assume that changes in the free cash flows are 
uncorrelated with changes in the spot exchange rates. Hence, we can convert the pound-
denominated free cash flows to equivalent dollar amounts using the forward exchange rate, 
as we did in Section 31.2. The spreadsheet in Table 31.5 performs this calculation, with 
the dollar value of the pound-denominated free cash flow shown in line 3.
Next, we add the dollar-based cash flows to determine the project’s aggregate free cash 
flow in dollar terms. This calculation is done in lines 4 through 6 of Table 31.5. Note that 
we deduct Ityesi’s dollar-denominated costs, and then add the tax shield associated with 
these costs. Even if the taxes will be paid in pounds in the U.K., they will fluctuate with the 
dollar cost of the inputs and so can be viewed as a dollar-denominated cash flow.

Here is what you should know after reading this chapter. 
 will 
help you identify what you know and where to go when you need to practice.
31.1  Internationally Integrated Capital Markets
	
n	 The condition necessary to ensure internationally integrated capital markets is that the value of 
a foreign investment does not depend on the currency (home or foreign) used in the analysis.
31.2  Valuation of Foreign Currency Cash Flows
	
n	 Two methods are used to value foreign currency cash flows when markets are internationally 
integrated and uncertainty in spot exchange rates is uncorrelated with the foreign currency cash 
flows:
n	 Calculate the foreign currency value of a foreign project as the NPV of the expected foreign 
currency future cash flows discounted at the foreign cost of capital, and then convert the 
foreign currency NPV into the home currency using the current spot exchange rate.
Given the dollar-denominated free cash flow in line 6 of Table 31.5, we can now com-
pute the NPV of the investment using Ityesi’s dollar WACC:3
17.225
1.068 + 16.473
1.0682 + 15.744
1.0683 + 15.033
1.0684 - 28.000 = $27.05 million
Notice that we would have gotten the same answer had we taken the dollar-based expected 
costs of $16 million and included them in Table 31.4 by first converting them to pounds 
at the forward exchange rate. But note that had we done so, these cash flows would no lon-
ger correspond to expected cash flows because the forward exchange rate is not an unbiased 
predictor of the future spot rate. Thus, another way to account for cash flows that are cor-
related with exchange rates is to convert the cash flows at the forward rate with the explicit 
understanding that the resulting numbers are not expectations.
The Ityesi example was simplified because we could easily isolate the cash flows that 
would vary perfectly with the dollar-pound exchange rate from those that would be uncor-
related with the exchange rate. In practice, determining these sensitivities may be difficult. 
If historical data is available, the tools of regression can be used to identify the exchange 
rate risk of project cash flows, in much the same way that we used regression to identify the 
market risk of security returns in Part 4.
In this chapter, we have endeavored to provide an introduction to international capital 
budgeting. This topic is sufficiently complicated that entire textbooks are devoted to it. 
Hence, it is difficult to do this issue justice in a single-chapter treatment. Although we have 
provided a basic framework for approaching the problem, a reader who is seriously consid-
ering undertaking a foreign venture should consult one of the books listed in the Further 
Readings section at the end of the chapter.
Concept Check	
1.	 What conditions cause the cash flows of a foreign project to be affected by exchange rate risk?
	
2.	 How do we make adjustments when a project has inputs and outputs in different currencies?
3Again, we use the domestic WACC to discount the cash flows because we continue to assume, as in foot-
note 2, that the overall market risk of the project is unchanged.

1106	
Chapter 31  International Corporate Finance
n	 Compute the expected value of the foreign currency cash flows in the home currency by 
multiplying the expected value in the foreign currency by the forward exchange rates, and 
then compute the NPV of these home currency cash flows using the domestic cost of capital.
	
n	 When markets are internationally integrated and uncertainty in spot exchange rates is uncor-
related with the foreign currency cash flows, the foreign and domestic risk premia are approxi-
mately the same so the foreign WACC can be approximated as the foreign risk-free interest rate 
plus the domestic risk premium:
	
r£* =
1 + r£
1 + r$
 (1 + r$*) - 1  r£ + (r$* - r$)	
(31.7)
31.3  Valuation and International Taxation
	
n	 A U.S. corporation pays the higher of the foreign or domestic tax rate on its foreign project, so 
project valuation should use the higher of these two rates as well. The U.S. corporation may be 
able to reduce its tax liability by undertaking foreign projects in other countries whose earnings 
can be pooled with those of the new project, or by deferring the repatriation of earnings.
31.4  Internationally Segmented Capital Markets
	
n	 Capital markets might be internationally segmented. The implication is that one country or 
currency has a higher cost of capital than another country or currency, when the two are com-
pared in the same currency. This segmentation may provide a firm with a comparative advan-
tage based on its access to capital across markets.
31.5  Capital Budgeting with Exchange Risk
	
n	 When a project has inputs and outputs in different currencies, the foreign-denominated cash 
flows are likely to be correlated with changes in spot rates. To correctly value such projects, the 
foreign and domestic cash flows should be valued separately.

WACC for your company is known to be 7.7%. If these markets are internationally integrated, 
estimate the euro cost of capital for a project with free cash flows that are uncorrelated with 
spot exchange rates. Assume the firm pays the same tax rate no matter where the cash flows are 
earned.
	
6.	 Maryland Light, a U.S. light fixtures manufacturer, is considering an investment in Japan. The 
dollar cost of equity for Maryland Light is 13.34%. You are in the corporate treasury depart-
ment, and you need to know the comparable cost of equity in Japanese yen for a project with 
free cash flows that are uncorrelated with spot exchange rates. The risk-free interest rates on dol-

that capital markets are internationally integrated. What is the yen cost of equity?
	
7.	 The dollar cost of debt for Coval Consulting, a U.S. research firm, is 7.6%. The firm faces a tax 
rate of 30% on all income, no matter where it is earned. Managers in the firm need to know 
its yen cost of debt because they are considering a new bond issue in Tokyo to raise money for 
a new investment there. The risk-free interest rates on dollars and yen are r$ = 4% and r¥ =
0.8%, respectively. Coval Consulting is willing to assume that capital markets are internation-
ally integrated and that its free cash flows are uncorrelated with the yen-dollar spot rate. What 
is Coval Consulting’s after-tax cost of debt in yen? (Hint: Start by finding the after-tax cost of 
debt in dollars and then finding the yen equivalent.)

9.	 Tailor Johnson, a U.S. maker of fine menswear, has a subsidiary in Ethiopia. This year, the 
­subsidiary reported and repatriated earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 100 million 
Ethiopian birrs. The current exchange rate is 8 birr/$ or S1 = $0.125/birr. The Ethiopian tax 
rate on this activity is 25%. U.S. tax law requires Tailor Johnson to pay taxes on the ­Ethiopian 
earnings at the same rate as profits earned in the United States, which is currently 45%. 
­However, the United States gives a full tax credit for foreign taxes paid up to the amount of the 
U.S. tax liability. What is Tailor Johnson’s U.S. tax liability on its Ethiopian subsidiary?
	
*10.	 Tailor Johnson, the menswear company with a subsidiary in Ethiopia described in Problem 9, 
is considering the tax benefits resulting from deferring repatriation of the earnings from the 
subsidiary. Under U.S. tax law, the U.S. tax liability is not incurred until the profits are brought 
back home. Tailor Johnson reasonably expects to defer repatriation for 10 years, at which point 
the birr earnings will be converted into dollars at the prevailing spot rate, S10, and the tax credit 

for Ethiopian taxes paid will still be converted at the exchange rate S1 = $0.125/birr. Tailor 
Johnson’s after-tax cost of debt is 5%.
a.	 Suppose the exchange rate in 10 years is identical to this year’s exchange rate, so 
S10 = $0.125/birr. What is the present value of deferring the U.S. tax liability on Tailor 
Johnson’s Ethiopian earnings for 10 years?
b.	 How will the exchange rate in 10 years affect the actual amount of the U.S. tax liability? 
Write an equation for the U.S. tax liability as a function of the exchange rate S10.
	
11.	 Peripatetic Enterprises, a U.S. import-export trading firm, is considering its international tax 
situation. U.S. tax law requires U.S. corporations to pay taxes on their foreign earnings at the 
same rate as profits earned in the United States; this rate is currently 45%. However, a full tax 
credit is given for the foreign taxes paid up to the amount of the U.S. tax liability. Peripatetic 
has major operations in Poland, where the tax rate is 20%, and in Sweden, where the tax rate 
is 60%. The profits, which are fully and immediately repatriated, and foreign taxes paid for the 
current year are shown here:

Data Case
You are a senior financial analyst with IBM in their capital budgeting division. IBM is considering 
expanding in Australia due to its positive business atmosphere and cultural similarities to the U.S.
The new facility would require an initial investment in fixed assets of $5 billion Australian and 
an additional capital investment of 3% would be required each year in years 1–4. All capital invest-
ments would be depreciated straight-line over the five years that the facility operates. First-year rev-
enues from the facility are expected to be $6 billion Australian and grow at 10% per year. Cost 
of goods sold would be 40% of revenue; the other operating expenses would amount to 12% of 
revenue. Net working capital requirements would be 11% of sales and would be required the year 
prior to the actual revenues. All net working capital would be recovered at the end of the fifth year. 
Assume that the tax rates are the same in the two countries, that the two markets are internationally 
a.	 What is the U.S. tax liability on the earnings from the Polish subsidiary assuming the 
­Swedish subsidiary did not exist?
b.	 What is the U.S. tax liability on the earnings from the Swedish subsidiary assuming the 
­Polish subsidiary did not exist?
c.	 Under U.S. tax law, Peripatetic is able to pool the earnings from its operations in Poland 
and Sweden when computing its U.S. tax liability on foreign earnings. Total EBIT is thus 
$179.1 million and the total host country taxes paid is $77.2 million. What is the total U.S. 
tax liability on foreign earnings? Show how this relates to the answers in parts (a) and (b).
Internationally Segmented Capital Markets
	
*12.	 Suppose the interest on Russian government bonds is 7.9%, and the current exchange rate is 
28.6 rubles per dollar. If the forward exchange rate is 29.1 rubles per dollar, and the current U.S. 
risk-free interest rate is 4.8%, what is the implied credit spread for Russian government bonds?
Capital Budgeting with Exchange Risk
	
*13.	 Assume that in the original Ityesi example in Table 31.1, all sales actually occur in the United 
States and are projected to be $60 million per year for four years. Keeping the cost of sales, 
operating expenses, capital expenditures and depreciation expenses unchanged (and in pounds), 
and assuming the tax rate remains at 40%, calculate the NPV of the investment opportunity.

3.	 You may have noticed that the four-year rate is not available at www.investing.com for the U.S. 
Treasury. To find an estimate of the four-year yield, calculate the average of the three and five-year 
yields.
	
4.	 In your Excel spreadsheet, create a new worksheet with a timeline for the project expected cash 
flows.
a.	 Compute the tax rate as the three-year average of IBM’s annual income tax divided by annual 
earnings before tax.
b.	 Determine the expected free cash flows of the project.
	
5.	 Note that the free cash flows you calculated in Question 4 are in Australian dollars. Use Eq. 30.3 
to determine the forward exchange rates for each of the five years of the project. Then, use the 
forward rates to convert the cash flows to U.S. dollars.
	
6.	 Compute the NPV of the project in U.S. dollars using the 12% required return given by your 
team manager.
