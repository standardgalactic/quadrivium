Preface
Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP) is a coveted certification for an
information security professional to achieve. Certified individuals are considered
experienced and knowledgeable information security professionals. This is due to the fact
that the certification's requirements are that the candidate not only has to pass the exam, but
have 4 to 5 years of relevant practical experience in one or two domains of information
security.
The exam is conducted by the International Information System Security Certification
Consortium (ISC)²®, a nonprofit consortium that is the globally recognized Gold Standard
for certifying information security professionals throughout their careers. (ISC)²® was
founded in 1989 by industry leaders and has certified over 1,00,000 information security
professionals across the globe.
While preparing for CISSP™, a candidate has to study many books and references. There
are many books that cover the CISSP™ CBK™ domains in depth and provide a starting
point for a thorough preparation for the exam. References to such books are covered in the
references chapter at the end of this book. However, since there are many concepts spread
across the eight security domains, it is an important starting point as a guide to explore
deeper concepts, as well as refresh many concepts that need to be revised before the exam.
This book addresses the requirements of the initial preparation for the exam, as well as
revisiting the key concepts in these eight domains. To facilitate such a need core concept,
the eight CISSP information security domains are explained in a short, simple, and lucid
form.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies, covers
the foundational concepts in information security, such as Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability (CIA) from the first domain of CISSP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK)®.
Chapter 2, Day2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and
Security Education, covers risk management practices that include the identification of risks
through risk analysis and assessment, and mitigation techniques such as reduction, moving,
transferring, and avoiding risks. An overview of business continuity requirements,
developing and documenting project scopes and plans, and conducting business impact
analyses is provided. Further more policies and practices pertaining to personnel security
are covered.

Preface

Day 1 – Security and Risk
Management - Security,
Compliance, and Policies
Information security and risk management are analogous to each other. The security and
risk management domain forms the baseline for all information security concepts and
practices. This is the first domain in CISSP CBK. Concepts on the key areas explained in this
domain are across the next seven domains of CISSP, and will serve as the conceptual
foundation for more complicated topics. Hence, a strong foundational knowledge in this
domain will help the students in understanding the concepts in the rest of the domains.
A candidate appearing for the CISSP exam is expected to have foundational concepts and
knowledge in the following key areas of the security and risk management domain:
Asset protection
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)
Security governance principles
Compliance
Legal and regulatory issues that pertain to information security in the global
context
Professional ethics
Personnel security policies
Risk management principles
Threat modeling
Business continuity planning

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 8 ]
Security risk considerations in acquisition strategy and practice
Security education training and awareness
This chapter gives an overview of Security, Compliance, and Policies using a high-level
illustration. This is followed with an overview of asset and asset protection. Furthermore,
the concepts of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) are explained with
suitable examples. Security governance principles, compliance frameworks, and legal and
regulatory issues that can impact on compliance are covered from a global perspective.
Management practices that relate to security policies, standards, procedures and guidelines,
as well as personnel security policies, are covered toward the end.
Overview of security, compliance, and
policies
Asset protection forms the baseline for security. Unintended disclosure and unauthorized
modification or destruction of an asset can affect security.
Observe the following illustration:

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 9 ]
Asset requires protection
Protection is based on the requirements of Confidentiality, Integrity and
Availability (CIA) for the
Security is ensured through Security Governance that comprises management
practices and management oversight
Security is demonstrated through compliance that could be legal or regulatory
Compliance consists of adherence to applicable legal and regulatory
requirements; applicable policies, standards, procedures and guidelines; and
personnel security policies
Compliance can be affected by security issues
Asset
Assets can be tangible, that is, perceptible by touch. An example of a tangible asset could be
a desktop computer or a laptop. Assets can be intangible, that is, not have physical
presence. An example of an intangible asset could be a corporate image or an intellectual
property, such as patents.
Assets are used by the organization for business processes. Every asset, whether tangible or
intangible, has a certain intrinsic value to the business. The value can be monetary, or of
importance, or both. For example, a simple firewall that costs less than $10000 may be
protecting important business applications worth millions of dollars.
If an asset is compromised, for example, stolen or modified, and the data or a secret
information is disclosed, it will have an impact that could lead to monetary loss, customer
dissatisfaction, or legal and regulatory non-compliance.
An asset can be hardware, software, data, process, product, or infrastructure that is of value
to an organization, and hence, needs protection. The level of protection is based on the
value of the asset to the business.
To assess protection requirements, assets are grouped based on the type of assets, such as
tangible or intangible, physical or virtual, and computing or noncomputing. For example, a
computer can be a physical asset as well as a computing asset, such as hardware.
Note that equipment, such as plumbing tools, can also be called hardware
in some countries. However, in the information security domain,
hardware generally implies computing and computer-related equipment.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 10 ]
Assets are generally grouped as follows:
Physical assets: They are tangible in nature and examples include buildings,
furniture, Heating, Ventilating and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment, and
so on.
Hardware assets: They are related to computer and network systems. Examples
include, servers, desktop computers, laptop, router, network cables and so on.
Software assets: They are intangible assets that an organization owns a license to
use. In general, organizations may not have Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
over such assets. Examples include, Operating Systems (OS), Data Base
Management Systems (DBMS), office applications, web server software, and so
on.
Information assets: They are intangible in nature. They are owned by the
organization. Examples include, business processes, policies and procedures,
customer information, personnel information, agreements, and formulas
developed in-house or purchased outright.
Personnel assets: People associated with the organization, such as employees,
contractors, and third-party consultants, are grouped under this type.
Note that, in certain accounting practices, software can also be classified
under Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE). However, in the information
security domain, software is classified as an intangible asset. Besides,
software or information may be stored in hardware or physical assets,
such as on hard disk or DVD.
Asset protection
In the information security domain, asset protection involves security management
practices that are subjected to business and compliance requirements. Such practices for 
asset protection are called security controls.
Types of security controls include:
Physical entry controls to an office building that allow only authorized personnel
Monitoring controls, such as CCTV, for surveillance of critical assets
Controls, such as locks, for hardware assets for protection from theft
Tamper proofing controls, such as hashing and encryption, for software and data
asset
Copyrights or patent for information assets to protect legal rights
Identity management systems to protect personnel assets from identity theft

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 11 ]
This is not a comprehensive list of security controls. This book provides hundreds of such
requirements and controls in subsequent chapters. However, a requirement or a control is
not determined ad-hoc. Instead, asset protection requirements are identified through a
structured method of risk analysis, evaluation, and assessment. Similarly, controls are
identified through risk mitigation strategies. Risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies
are covered in the next chapter.
Hence, asset protection requirements are based on risk. In order to understand risk, to
perform risk assessment and select controls for asset protection, the concepts of CIA have to
be understood first.
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
(CIA)
Information is a business asset and adds value to an organization. Information exists in
many forms. It may be printed or written on paper, stored in electronic media, transmitted
by electronic means, or spoken in conversations.
Information and its associated infrastructure are accessed and used in business by
employees, third-party users or by automated processes. For example, an HR Manager
accessing employee profile database through a database application. Each component in
this activity, that is, HR manager, employee profile database, and the database application
is called entities. Other examples would be a time-based job scheduler, such as cron in
UNIX, such as operating systems, or a task scheduler in Windows, such as operating
systems updating information through a script in a database. Here, scheduler application,
the script or application it runs, and the data being accessed are entities.
Information assets and associated entities have certain levels of CIA requirements. A level
could be a numeric value or representational value, such as high, low, or medium. The CIA
triad is frequently referred to as tenets of information security. Tenet means something
accepted as an important truth. The CIA values of an asset are established through risk
analysis, which is a part of risk management. Concepts of risk management are covered in
the next chapter.
Information security is characterized by preserving CIA values of an asset. Preserving is to
ensure that the CIA values are maintained all the time and at all the locations. Hence, for an
effective information security management, defining and maintaining CIA values is a
primary requirement.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 12 ]
Confidentiality
Information needs to be disclosed to authorized entities for business processes, for example,
an authorized employee accessing information about the prototype under development on
the server. Confidentiality is to ensure that the information is not disclosed to
unauthorized entities, for example, confidentiality is often achieved by encryption.
Integrity
Information has to be consistent and not altered or modified without established approval
policies or procedures. Integrity is to maintain the consistency of the information internally
as well as externally. This is to prevent unauthorized modification by authorized entities,
for example, an update to the database record is made without approval.
Integrity is also to prevent authorized modification by unauthorized entities, for example,
when malicious code is inserted in a web application by an unethical hacker. In this
scenario, a hacker (an unauthorized entity) may modify an application through an
established procedure (authorized update).
Availability
Availability is to ensure that information and associated services are available to
authorized entities as and when required. For example, in an attack on the network through
Denial-of-Service (DoS). Sometimes, an authorized update to an application may stop
certain essential services and will constitute a breach in availability requirements, for
example, inadvertently tripping over a server power cable may constitute as an availability
breach.
Security governance
Information security for a long time was considered as a purely technical domain. Hence,
the focus was to define and manage security predominantly through the Information 
Technology department in many organizations. It was more like protecting only the
Information systems, such as computers and networks.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 13 ]
Information exists in many forms and the levels of assurance required vary, based on their
criticality, business requirements and from legal, regulatory compliance requirements.
Hence, the focus has to be on protecting the information itself, which is essential and much
broader in scope compared to focusing only on Information Technology.
Information is a business asset and valuable to organizations. Information has a lifecycle. It
could be handled, processed, transported, stored, archived, or destroyed. At any stage
during the lifecycle, the information can be compromised. A compromise can affect the CIA
requirements of the information.
Information protection is a business responsibility. It involves governance challenges, such as
risk management, reporting, and accountability. Hence, it requires the involvement of
senior management and the board to provide a strategic oversight for implementing and
ensuring continual effectiveness.
Strategy, goals, mission, and objectives
Aligning and integrating information security with enterprise governance and IT
governance frameworks is the primary strategy for the senior management and the board.
It includes the definition of the current state of security and establishing goals and
objectives to align with the corporate mission.
For such a strategy, goals and objectives will include understanding protection
requirements, which are based on the value of information, expected outcomes of the
information security program, benefits that are quantifiable, and methods to integrate
information security practices with organizational practices.
A corporate mission is based on the definition of the business, its core purpose, values and
beliefs, standards, and behaviors. An information security mission defines security
requirements, their purpose, focus on risk management, commitment to continual
maintenance, and the improvement of the information security program. Hence, aligning
information security mission with the corporate's mission is one of the primary strategies of
security governance.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 14 ]
Organizational processes
To support the information security strategy and to meet the goals and objectives, 
organizational processes need to be aligned to the mission. Such processes include defining
the roles and responsibilities of the personnel involved with effective implementation and
day-to-day management; establishing monitoring mechanisms that include reporting,
review and approval processes, and ensuring that management support is available to such
organizational processes.
Security roles and responsibilities
Information security is everyone's responsibility in any organization. Specific security roles
and responsibilities are to be considered from the security governance perspective. Hence,
the information security responsibilities of the board of directors/trustees, executives,
steering committee, and chief information security officer are important at management
level.
Control frameworks
To support the information security strategy and the mission, control frameworks are
established by the organization. Such frameworks contain controls under three broad
categories, namely, management, administrative, and technical.
Management controls
Management controls are characterized by stating the views of the management and their
position in particular topics, such as information security.
For example, the Information security policy is a management control, wherein the
management states its intent, support, and direction for security.
Administrative controls
While a policy is a high-level document that provides the intent of the management, 
administrative controls are to implement such policies.
For example, procedures, guidelines, and standards are administrative controls that
support the policies. These are covered later in this chapter.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 15 ]
Technical controls
Information is stored and processed predominantly in IT systems. Hence, technical controls
are established to support management and administrative controls in the information
systems.
Firewall, intrusion detection systems, antivirus, and so on, are some examples of technical
controls.
Due diligence and due care
It is important that intent and management support to information security programs is
visible across the organization to investors and customers. Hence, an organization should
demonstrate due diligence and due care pertaining to information security processes and
activities.
Understanding risk and estimating the same, in view of the organizations' mission,
prevailing threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks, and legal, regulatory compliance, form a part
of the due diligence process by the management.
Implementing security governance by way of organizational processes, defining roles and
responsibilities, establishing risk management processes, and monitoring effectiveness of
the information security controls are due care activities by the management.
Compliance
Information security breaches in the past two decades have necessitated new security-
related legal and regulatory frameworks or updates to existing legal and regulatory
frameworks to include security-related compliance provisions across various countries.
Requirements to comply with legal and legislative frameworks have increased
exponentially due to global nature of the Internet, cross-border information exchange,
electronic commerce, and services. Compliance frameworks are abundant with terms and
jargon that a security professional should be aware of. Following are some of the legal and
regulatory frameworks, terms, and jargons that are relevant to the Information Security
domain.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 16 ]
Legislative and regulatory compliance
Common law is a law that is developed based on the decisions of courts and tribunals
rather than through statutory laws (legislative statutes). The legal system that uses common
law is called common law legal systems. Countries, such as the United Kingdom, the
United States of America (most of the states in the USA), Canada, Australia, South Africa,
India, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong follow common law.
There are three categories under common law that are generally established:
Regulatory law, also called as Administrative law, primarily deals with the
1.
regulations of administrative agencies of the government.
Criminal law deals with the violations of government laws. Criminal laws are
2.
filed by government agencies against an individual or an organization. The
punishment under criminal laws includes imprisonment as well as financial
penalties.
Civil law deals with the lawsuits filed by private parties, such as corporations or
3.
individuals. Punishments under this law are financial or punitive damages or
both.
Statutory law, legislative statute, or statute law is a legal system that is set down by the
legislature or executive branch of the government. Statutory law under certain instances is
also termed as codified law.
Religious are legal systems based on religious principles. Examples include Hindu, Islam,
and Christian laws.
Civil Law laws are legal systems based on religious principles. Examples include Hindu,
Islam, and Christian laws.
Civil Law is a legal system based on codes and legislative statutes as opposed to common
law. France, Germany, and many other countries in the world follow civil law. Hence, there
is a civil law category in the common law system and a civil law system itself.
Privacy requirements in compliance
Privacy is protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)about individuals or 
Sensitive Personal Information (SPI) that can be used to identify a person in context with a
group. Protection under privacy is from disclosure or selective disclosure based on the
individual's preferences.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 17 ]
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published a guide to
protecting the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information-wide NIST special
publication 800-122. As per the guide, PII is defined as any information about an individual
maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an
individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden
name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual,
such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information.
Privacy laws deal with protecting and preserving the rights of an individual's privacy.
A few examples of privacy laws in the United States include the following:
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
Financial Services Modernization Act (GLB), 15 U.S. Code: 6801-6810
Final Rule on Privacy of Consumer Financial Information, 16 Code of Federal
Regulations, Part 313
In the UK, they include the following:
Data Protection Act 1998 (United Kingdom)
Data Protection Directive (European Union)
Licensing and intellectual property
Intellectual Property (IP) refers to creative works using intellect, that is, mind, music,
literary works, art, inventions, symbols, designs, and so on fall under intellectual property.
The creator of such intellectual work has certain exclusive rights over the property. These
exclusive rights are called Intellectual Property Rights (IPR).
Intellectual property law is a legal domain that deals with Intellectual Property Rights
(IPR).
Following are some of the IPR-related terminologies:
Copyright: This is an intellectual property that grants exclusive rights to the
creator of the original work, such as deriving financial benefits out of such work,
ownership credits, and so on. Others do not have 'right to copy' such work.
Copyright is country-specific.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 18 ]
Patent: This is a set of exclusive rights granted to the inventor of new, useful,
inventive, and industry applicable inventions. This right excludes others from
making, using, selling, or importing the invention. Patents are granted for a
specific period of time. A patent is a public document.
Trademark: This is a unique symbol or mark that is used by individuals or
organizations to uniquely represent a product or a service. Trademark is also
used to distinguish from products and services of other entities.
Trade secret: This is a formula, design, process, practice, or pattern that is not 
revealed to others. This is to protect the information being copied and gain
competitive advantage.
Legal and regulatory issues
Information compromise or security breach that could lead to civil or criminal liability on
the part of an organization will be grouped under legal and regulatory issues. For example,
if a hacker intrudes into a system, obtains Personally Identifiable Information (PII), and
publishes the same in an Internet portal, then the liability for failure to protect such
information falls on the organization.
The following list of issues may have legal or regulatory ramifications.
Computer crimes
A computer crime is a fraudulent activity that is perpetrated against computer or IT
systems. The motivation could be for financial gain, competitive gain, popularity, fame, or
adventure.
In computer crime, the term computer refers to the role it plays in different scenarios.
Whether the crime is committed against a computer, whether the crime is committed using
the computer, whether the computer is incidental in the crime, or a combination of all the
three.
The following paragraphs provide some of the common computer crimes. Remember, CIA
compromise or breach will be the end result of a crime.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 19 ]
Fraud
Manipulation of computer records, such as data diddling, salami slicing, or any other
techniques, or a deliberate circumvention of computer security systems, such as cracking or
unethical hacking for monitory gain, is termed as fraud.
Data diddling is a malicious activity to change the data during input or
processing stage of a software program to obtain financial gain.
Salami slicing, also known as penny shaving, is a fraudulent activity to
regularly siphon extremely small quantity of money so as to prevent from
being observed or caught.
Hacking refers to the discovery of vulnerabilities, holes, or weaknesses in computer
software and associated IT systems either to exploit the same for improvising the security or
to prevent intentional fraud. Hackers are persons who do hacking. However, hacking is
classified with different names to distinguish the objective:
Black-hat hackers are people with malicious intent, who compromise the
computer systems to commit crime. Such a hacker is called a cracker and the
malicious hacking activity is termed as cracking.
White-hat hackers or ethical hackers are people who try to compromise the
computer systems to discover holes and improve the security.
Grey-hat hackers are ambiguous wherein their actual intention is not known.
Theft
Identity theft is to steal someone's identity. The intention is to pretend to be someone else
to commit fraud. Stealing passwords, login credentials, and credit card information are
examples of identity theft.
Intellectual property theft is stealing software code or designs for financial gain.
Malware/malicious code
A malware is malicious software that is designed to compromise, damage, or affect the
general functioning of computers, gain unauthorized access, collect private, and sensitive
information and/or corrupt the data.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 20 ]
Writing or spreading malware is a computer crime. Viruses, worms, Trojan horses,
spyware, such as Key logger, and so on are examples of malware and are explained as
follows:
A computer virus is a malicious program or a malicious code that attaches to files
and can spread from one file to another file or from one computer to another
computer. Technically, a virus can spread or infect the computer if the user opens
the infected file.
Worms are similar to viruses, but are self-replicating and propagating. Generally,
worms do not require the human intervention of opening an infected file.
A Trojan horse is a malware that hides its identity within a legitimate program.
Users are tricked into opening the file containing the malware by way of social
engineering.
Social engineering is a type of nonintrusive attack in which
humans are tricked into circumventing security controls. Some
of the attacks, such as phishing and Cross Site Request Forgery
(CSRF), use social engineering techniques. More details about
CSRF are covered in Chapter 6, Day 6 – Security Engineering –
Security Design, Practices, Models and Vulnerability Mitigation.
Spyware is a malicious code that tracks the user actions. Examples of user actions
include web browsing patterns, files opened, applications accessed, and so on. A
spyware is best explained as a snooping software.
Key loggers are a type of spyware that capture keystrokes and transmit them to
an attacker's server. Sensitive information, such as username and passwords, are
captured using key loggers. Key loggers can be a hardware or software.
Cyber crime
Criminal activities that are perpetrated using communication networks, such as the
Internet, telephone, wireless, satellite, and mobile networks, are called as cyber crimes:
Cyber terrorism is a type of cybercrime perpetrated against computers and 
computer networks and they generally are premeditated in nature. The objective
of the attacks could be to cause harm based on social, ideological, religious,
political, or similar objectives.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 21 ]
Cyber stalking is a type of cybercrime in which the offender harasses or
intimidates the victim using the Internet and other electronic means. It is a
criminal offence under various state anti stalking, harassment laws.
Information warfare is a type of cybercrime to destabilize the opponent, such as
corporations and institutions, to gain a competitive advantage. For example, false
propaganda, web page defacement, and so on.
Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attack or Distributed Denial-Of-Service (DDoS)
attacks are cybercrimes where websites or corporate systems of the corporations
or computer systems of any user, made inaccessible by way of multiple services,
request to overload the web and application servers. Eventually, the servers stops
responding to genuine requests. (Ro)botnets are increasingly used for such
crimes. A botnet is an army of computers listening to a control center system for
executing orders. Generally, computers in a bot network are compromised
systems through security vulnerability exploitation.
More details about botnets are covered in Chapter 6, Day 6 – Security
Engineering – Security Design, Practices, Models and Vulnerability Mitigation.
Making and digitally distributing child pornography is a cyber crime.
Digitally distributing and storing copyrighted materials of others without the copyright
owner's explicit permission is a cyber crime.
Using e-mail communication to disrupt or send unsolicited commercial e-mails or induce
the user to perform certain actions to steal information or money fall under cyber crime.
Following are examples of such crimes:
Sending Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) is called spamming. It is a cyber
crime that clogs the networks and intrudes into the privacy of the user.
Phishing is a type of cyber crime wherein a user is lured to an attacker
constructed illegitimate website that looks similar to actual website the user
intended to visit. For example, online banking websites, e-mail login pages, and
so on. A successful phishing attack would result in the capture of user credentials
by the attacker.
Pharming is a type of cyber attack wherein a user is redirected to a malicious
website constructed by the attacker. Generally, this type of redirection happens
without user acceptance or knowledge.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 22 ]
SMiShing is a type of cyber attack using mobile networks. In this attack, Short
Messaging Service (SMS) is used to lure the user to the attacker-constructed
malicious websites. This is similar to phishing.
Harassment in the form of cyberstalking, cyberbullying, hate crime, online
predating, and trolling are crimes that target specific individuals.
Importing and exporting controls
Many countries have import and export restrictions pertaining to the encryption of data.
For example, encryption items specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted, or
modified for military applications, command, control, and intelligence applications are
generally controlled based on munitions lists.
Transborder data flow
The transfer of computerized data across national borders, states or political boundaries are 
termed as transborder data flow. Data can be personal, business, technical, and
organizational. Legal issues that arise out of such data is related to ownership and the
usage.
Data breaches
By definition, a data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, protected, or
confidential data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an individual
unauthorized to do so. It can also be owing to unintentional information disclosure, data
leak, or data spill.
Data breach can happen owing to hacking (unethical means), organized crimes, negligence
in the disposal of media, and so on.
Data breach is a security incident, and hence, many jurisdictions have passed data breach
notification laws.
In the United States, data breach-related laws are categorized as security breach laws.
National Conference of State Legislatures in the United States defines the provisions of such
laws as:

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 23 ]
Security breach laws typically have provisions regarding who must comply with the law (e.g.
businesses, data/ information brokers, government entities, and so on); definitions of “personal
information” (e.g. name combined with SSN, drivers license or state ID, account numbers, and so
on.); what constitutes a breach (e.g. unauthorized acquisition of data); requirements for notice (e.g.
timing or method of notice, who must be notified); and exemptions (e.g. for encrypted information).
Professional ethics
The information security profession is based on trust, as the professional may be handling
sensitive or confidential information. Ethically sound and consistently applied code of
professional ethics need to be adhered to by the professional.
Codes of ethics
These are based on the safety of the commonwealth, duty to principals, such as employers,
contractors, people whom a professional works for, and to each other. It requires that 
professionals adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior.
(ISC)
2 code of professional ethics
International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)
2 has a
published code of professional ethics for its members provided as follows:
Protect society, the commonwealth, and the infrastructure
Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally
Provide diligent and competent service to principals
Advance and protect the profession
Security policies, standards, procedures,
and guidelines
Policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines form a quartet of organizational
mechanisms in protecting information:
Security policies are high-level statements that provide management intent and
direction for information security. They describe the what of the description.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 24 ]
Security standards provide prescriptive statements, control objectives, and
controls for enforcing security policies. In a way, they provide the how of the
description. They can be internally developed by the organization and/or
published by standard bodies, such as National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or
country-specific standard bodies.
Security procedures are step-by-step instructions to implement the policies and
standards.
Security guidelines provide the best practice methods to support security
controls selection and implementation. They can be used in whole or part while
implementing security standards.
For example, NIST Special Publication 800-14, Generally Accepted Principles
and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems provides procedures
and guidelines for System security life cycle.
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) along with International Electro-
Technical Commission (IEC) has published code of practice guidelines and a standard for 
Information Security Management System (ISMS). They are as follows:
ISO/IEC 27002: Code of practice for information security. This standard provides
a list of best practices an organization could adopt for security management.
ISO/IEC 27001: This standard specifies the management framework required for
Information Security and is a certifiable standard. Organizations can seek 
certification against this standard for their Information Security Management
System (ISMS).
Personnel security policies
Personnel security policies concern people associated with the organization, such as
employees, contractors, and consultants. These policies encompass the following:
Screening processes to validate security requirements
Understanding their security responsibilities
Understanding their suitability to security roles
Reducing the risk of theft, fraud, or the misuse of facilities

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 25 ]
Employment candidate screening
Background verification checks are primarily used in employment candidate screening
processes. They may include the following:
Character references to evaluate the personal traits of the applicant. Best practice
1.
guidelines indicate character references from at least two entities, such as from
business and personnel.
Completeness and accuracy of the applicant's curriculum vitae and the
2.
verification of claimed academic and professional qualifications are critical
checks in the screening process.
Identity checks by verifying identification documents.
3.
Checking criminal records as well as credit checks.
4.
Employment agreement and policies
Besides general job roles, based on the business requirements, information security
responsibilities that include information handling requirements should form part of the
employment agreement and policies.
Employees should also be aware of organization's information security policies, and when
they are given access to sensitive or confidential information, they need to additionally sign
confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements.
Employment termination processes
Employee termination processes have to be in accordance with the established security
policies and practices. The primary objective of the process is to ensure that employees,
contractors, and third-party users exit or change employment as per established procedures
without compromising security. The procedures may include termination of
responsibilities, return of assets, removal of access rights, and so on.
Vendor, consultant, and contractor controls
Third-party users, such as vendors, consultants, and contractors, need access to the
information and associated systems based on the job function. Information protection starts
from screening process, confidentiality, and nondisclosure agreements.

Day 1 – Security and Risk Management - Security, Compliance, and Policies
[ 26 ]
Compliance and privacy
Adherence to policies, procedures, and so on, performing job functions as per the legal,
regulatory requirements, and adherence to privacy protection mechanisms, are applicable
across the board in an organization.
Summary
This chapter has covered foundational concepts in Information Security. In a nutshell, assets
such as physical, hardware, software, information and personnel require protection.

Management, Business
Continuity, and Security
Education
This chapter gives an overview of risk management, business continuity, and security
education using a high-level illustration. Understanding and applying risk management
concepts, threat modeling, and establishing business continuity requirements are some of
the main topics covered in this chapter. A brief overview of integrating security risk
considerations into information systems' acquisition, strategy, and practice are covered.
Establishing and managing information security education, training, and awareness
programs and recommendation of best practices are provided towards the end of the
chapter.
Overview of risk management, business
continuity, and security education
Asset protection forms the baseline for security. Unintended disclosure, unauthorized 
modification, or destruction of an asset can affect security.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 29 ]
Observe the following illustration:
Fig 1
Risk is to assets from threat sources.
The asset requires protection from attacks.
Protection is based on the value of the assets. The value can be based on
monetary value, anticipated loss due to customer dissatisfaction, damage to
corporate image, or all of the above.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 30 ]
Risk management is to identify, assess, control, and mitigate risks.
Risk management consists of monitoring, reviewing, communicating, and
improving mechanisms.
Risks that compromise the availability of assets and resources are treated through
Business Continuity Plans (BCP).
Security education is an integral part of risk management.
These concepts are covered in detail in the rest of this chapter.
Risk management
Risk is defined as an exposure to loss, injury, or damage due to threats, vulnerabilities, and
attacks. Risk management is to manage the risks.
Identifying threats and vulnerabilities, attacks, estimating potential impact, and establishing
and implementing suitable controls to treat the risk are functional steps in risk
management. Monitoring, reviewing, communicating the results, and improving the
security posture are continual improvement processes in the risk management cycle.
Security posture is an overall plan of the organization pertaining to
security. It includes security governance, policies, procedures, and
compliance.
Observe the following illustration, which is a typical web application network
infrastructure consisting of the N-tier architecture:
Fig 2

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 31 ]
In the preceding architecture, various assets are involved in the business process of
accessing, updating, or modifying the information. For example, an employee (people asset)
accesses a web application (information asset) in a web server (hardware and software
assets). The web application accesses the application server, which in turn accesses and
processes the data in the database server. In this chain of connections and processes, each
asset will have certain levels of CIA requirements. For example, the applications in the
application server and the data they access will have higher confidentiality and integrity
requirements than the web server. Also, observe that there are some existing controls, such
as the firewall, authentication systems, and access control mechanisms.
From the information security perspective, a corporation has to evaluate
the risk of security compromise to the system, data, or physical assets and
estimate potential loss through threat, vulnerability, and attack analysis.
Threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks
Threat is an event that could compromise the information security by causing loss or
damage to assets. The threat is predominantly external to an organization. Examples of
threats are fire, flood, hacking, and so on.
Vulnerability is a hole or a weakness in the system. Threat can exploit vulnerabilities
through its agents called threat agents. For example, having no antivirus software is a
vulnerability, which a threat agent like a virus could exploit. Similarly, hacking is a threat
that could exploit a weakness in the system through its agent, for instance, a hacker.
A threat event exploiting a vulnerability is called as an attack. The end result of an attack
can lead to a security violation. An attack either compromises a security control or lack of it
and can affect the CIA requirements of the asset.
Having vulnerabilities and threats alone may not end in attacks. An attack
can be a motivated action to commit financial fraud or adventure action,
such as stopping a service or adversarial action for competitive gain,
revenge, and so on. Proper assessment has to be done to ascertain the
chance of an attack, the tenet of CIA it can affect, and the resulting damage
if the attack succeeds. In a nutshell, attacks can either be motivated or
inadvertent.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 32 ]
Threat risk modeling
Observe the following illustration, which now provides threat and vulnerability scenarios
in the same network depicted earlier. It is apparent, that due to vulnerabilities in the
system, threat agents may be able to attack and possibly succeed in penetrating the network
and obtain confidential information, alter sensitive data, or stop a service. However, we still
do not know yet that such an attack could materialize with prevailing controls in place. But
we will be able to estimate the possible impact if such an attack materializes. In other
words, we will be able to estimate potential loss.
Fig 3
Hence, in a threat risk modeling process, the following steps are necessary to estimate
potential loss:
Identify assets and their CIA requirements.
1.
Identify threats to those assets.
2.
Identify vulnerabilities in those assets.
3.
Identify attack possibilities.
4.
Identify existing controls.
5.
Perform vulnerability assessment and penetration tests on the assets and the
6.
infrastructure.
Estimate risk (potential loss).
7.
We have reviewed assets and CIA requirements of assets in the previous chapter. The rest
of the steps are covered in the following topics.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 33 ]
Threat and vulnerability analysis
In a threat risk-modeling scenario, the infrastructure/application has to be broken down
into various types of assets. Observe the following flow diagram:
Fig 4
During threat and vulnerability analysis, the following questions are pertinent to determine
the risks:
Q1. What are the security objectives (requirements)?
Security objectives are based on policies, such as the information security policy,
legal/regulatory requirements as mandated in privacy laws, Service Level
Agreements (SLA) as required in infrastructure availability, or data integrity
assurance requirements as required in financial transactions.
Q2. What is the overall infrastructure?
What are the individual components in the infrastructure? What are the CIA
values of the assets (people, infrastructure, application, data, and so on)? Will the
CIA values change due to certain factors? If so, what are those factors?
Infrastructure consists of physical security requirements, such as secure locations,
and environmental requirements, such as clean power, heating, ventilation and air
conditioning, and so on.
Application security requirements are based on access control, data flows, trust
boundaries, and so on.
Q3. What threats are applicable based on the type of assets (threat register)? What are the
prevailing threats to these assets?
Identify and document threats to the infrastructure, threats to the application, and
threats to data.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 34 ]
Q4. What are the vulnerabilities (vulnerability register) that these threats can compromise?
Which of these vulnerabilities are identified in these assets?
Identify and document vulnerabilities in infrastructure, applications in data flow,
and so on.
When a corporation compiles the answers to the preceding questions, it is in the process of
threat and vulnerability analysis. The end result of such an exercise will be a documented
matrix of assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.
Attack analysis
Based on the matrix of threats and vulnerabilities and based on the results of security
testing, a few attack scenarios can be constructed. Such a scenario is called as an attack tree.
Observe the following single dimensional attack tree. This attack tree is based on Fig 2 in
the previous page:
Fig 5
Note that some of the technical jargon used in the illustration, such as
custom payload, CSRF, and so on, is covered in Chapter 6, Day 6 –
Security Engineering – Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability
Mitigation.
Hence, an attack tree is constructed based on the following questions:
Q1. What are the various attacks that are possible based on the type of assets (attack
vectors)?
Attack possibilities can be created based on vulnerability assessment, penetration
testing, application security testing, and also based on the existing documentation
of attacks that are available from trusted sources.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 35 ]
Q2. What will happen when the attack succeeds?
Identify the system or data that will be compromised, CIA values that will
be affected and so on. It is also important to identify cascading effects of such a
compromise. For example, if an attacker compromises a webserver, will the other
servers that have trust relationships established with the webserver be
compromised?
Q3. What will be the loss? Is the loss quantifiable?
Identify loss in terms of money, time to recover, policy violation and its impact,
loss of competitive advantage, customer loss, compliance violation and its impact,
and so on.
Threat, vulnerability, and attack analysis provide information to perform
risk analysis. Few online dictionaries and databases are available that
provide common weaknesses and attack possibilities to applications or to
infrastructure and so on. References and URLs for such resources are
provided in Chapter 5, Day 5 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions.
Risk analysis
Risk is an exposure to loss or damage due to threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Hence,
risk analysis is used to estimate the probability of an attack, identify prevailing controls and
their effectiveness in combating the attacks, and estimate the consequence of such an attack
in terms of potential loss.
Risk has to be understood from the following perspectives:
Risk to what?
Risks are generally to assets. Assets can be tangible or intangible.
Risk from what?
Risks are from threat sources, such as earthquakes, floods, hacking, fires,
viruses, disgruntled employees, and so on.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 36 ]
Risk of what?
When an asset is compromised by a threat, it may result in a security
violation. Hence, there could be loss or damage. The damage can be
monetary loss, image loss, customer loss, or legal issues. Hence, there is
a risk of losing money, a risk of losing customers, or a risk of facing
legal/regulatory consequences due to the security breach.
The damage caused due to a security violation is called as an impact. The magnitude of
such an impact is the potential loss or, in other words, risk.
If the magnitude of an impact can be calculated in monetary terms (say, a dollar value),
then the risk is defined in quantitative terms. If the magnitude cannot be determined in
terms of monetary value, but can be measured in relative terms (such as high, medium, or
low), then the risk is defined in qualitative terms.
In terms of information security, ISO/IEC 27000 defines risk as the probability of a threat
exploiting the vulnerability and the consequence of loss or damage to the asset due to that
event. This is called probability versus consequence analysis and is a type of risk analysis.
Different types of risk assessments can be conducted based on the type of
assets and applicability and based on regulatory requirements. Some of
them are, Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability
Evaluation (OCTAVE), Asset based risk assessment method based on
ISO/IEC 27005, NISTSP 800:30, DREAD, and so on. References to many
such risk assessment methodologies and a brief overview of them are
provided in Chapter 5, Day 5 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions.
The results of probability versus consequence risk analysis will provide four scenarios.
Refer to the following illustration (Fig 6):
Fig 6

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 37 ]
The probability is low and the consequence is low, represented as the green zone
at the bottom left corner
The probability is low and the consequence is high, represented as the amber
zone at the top left corner
The probability is high and the consequence is low, represented as the amber
zone at bottom right corner
The probability is high and the consequence is high, represented as the red zone
on top right corner
By systematically analyzing the probability of a threat exploiting vulnerability and the
related consequences, one can deduce the risk.
The process of determining the risk level in terms of threats and a vulnerabilities and the
probability versus consequence analysis is called risk analysis. In other words, risk analysis
is a systematic process of identifying the risks and estimating the loss if the risk
materializes.
In the risk analysis process, related parameters of threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks are
taken into consideration to derive a value. The value can be a number (quantitative) or an
expression (qualitative). This derived value is called the risk value. For example, an
insurance agent may consider different parameters, such as age, health conditions,
hereditary diseases, habits, and so on, before determining a premium for life insurance.
Similarly, in information security, parameters are based on assets, their required CIA
values, threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.
Risk analysis process involves two distinctive activities. One is to measure the impact of the
risk. The analysis process tries to estimate the loss in terms of monetary value if a risk
materializes. However, assets are tangible or intangible in nature. It is not possible to
always determine the value of assets in monetary terms. Hence, two types of analysis are
used to determine loss expectancy. One is called quantitative risk analysis and the other is
called qualitative risk analysis.
Both quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes require that the value of the asset is
determined. The terms of reference by which the significance of the risk is determined
called are risk criteria.
Quantitative risk analysis
This type of risk analysis provides risk values in numeric terms. For example, monetary
loss. In other words, quantify the risk or derive a dollar value of a risk. Mathematical models are
available to estimate the monetary value of a risk. One such model is provided here.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 38 ]
When a threat event happens, the percentage of loss of an asset is based on its exposure
level to that particular threat. Generally, an exposure level is represented in terms of a
numerical value between 0 and 1.
For example, refer to the network diagram in Fig 3. The web server has a higher exposure
level from external sources than the application server . It is possible to approximate this
exposure level based on threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. The primary firewall in Fig 3
has a weak rule that allows a custom payload to be deployed on the web server. If the web
server contains a confidential file that can be obtained due to the attack, then the exposure
value of the web server and the file will be 1.
If an exposure value is represented in percentage, then the percentage will be called the 
Exposure Factor (EF) of that asset. In the preceding web server example, the exposure value
will be 1, which will give an exposure factor of 100%. Exposure factor is calculated based on
the other controls that are in place. For example, if the web server is protected with a host-
based firewall or privilege-based access controls are implemented, then the exposure factor
will be less.
When a monetary value or a dollar value is assigned for the expected loss due to a single
threat event, it is called Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), whereas, the monetary value of the
asset is called the Asset Value (AV).
SLE is the AV multiplied by the EF. In other words, SLE = AV X EF. In the previous
example, assuming the asset value of the confidential file is $10, then SLE = 10 X 100% = $10.
The estimated frequency or probability of a threat event occurring in a year is called
 Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO). For example, if the web server is compromised
five times in a year, ARO = 5.
When SLE is multiplied by ARO, the resultant value is called Annualized Loss
Expectancy (ALE). In this example, ARO = 10×5 = $50.
ALE is a dollar figure that is a quantified financial loss per annum.
Qualitative risk analysis
Qualitative risk analysis provides risk values in relative terms, such as a rating scales. For
example, high, medium, or low; or a grading scale of 1, 2, 3; or red, amber, green, and so on.
For example, if an asset value is categorized as high, medium, or low based on the business
impact, then the risk will be based on such rating scales rather than monetary values.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 39 ]
Risk treatment
Using risk analysis methods, either quantitative or qualitative risk values are obtained. This
activity of assigning values to risk is called risk estimation. Once the risks are identified, it
is important to understand their significance in terms of the impact to the business. This
process of estimating the impact is called risk evaluation. Overall, the process of risk
analysis and risk evaluation is called risk assessment.
Based on the risk assessment, suitable strategies are devised to mitigate the risks. These
strategies are called controls or counter measures, which are safeguards against the risk.
There are four types of risk mitigation strategies followed in the information security
domain:
Fig. 7
Risk acceptance is a strategy adopted when both probability and consequence are
low. For example, if the cost of protecting the file is higher than the cost of
controls, then the risk may be accepted. That is, the consequence is lower than the
control cost.
Risk reduction is a strategy adopted when the probability is high and the
consequence is low. For example, not storing a confidential file in the web server
or controls, such as encryption, will reduce the risk of disclosure of confidential
files.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 40 ]
Risk transfer is a strategy adopted when the probability is low and the
consequence is high. For example, threat event, such as earthquakes or other
natural calamities. When the probability is low and the consequence is high,
implementing a control may be cost prohibitive, but accepting risk could be
catastrophic. In situations like these, transferring risk through insurance would
be most appropriate.
Risk avoidance is a strategy adopted when both the probability and the
consequence are high. Risks that will have a catastrophic impact on the business
have to be avoided or, by using disaster recovery methods, moved to an
acceptable level.
Suitable plans need to be drawn up and controls are identified to mitigate the risks. Such
plans are called risk treatment plans.
Coordinated activities to manage the risk by way of risk assessment, risk treatment, risk
acceptance, risk communication to stakeholder, risk monitoring, and risk review are
collectively called risk management.
Due to the heterogeneous nature of information systems, even after applying the controls, it
may not be possible to assure either 100% security or 0% risk to assets. There is an amount
of risk that will remain after implementing safeguards. This risk is called residual risk. For
example, assume the SLE for the company website is 50,000. The EF is currently 1. Firewall
A will reduce the EF to .10 and cost 10,000. Firewall B will reduce the EF to .0 and cost
50,000. Going with Firewall A will cost 40,000 less, but will still leave you with 5,000 of
residual risk. Given that it would cost 40,000 to remove 5,000 of the risk, it is prudent to
allow residual risk instead of implementing additional controls. In this scenario, risk
acceptance is the best strategy.
Business continuity management
Generally, risk mitigation strategies for confidentiality and integrity-related risks are
implemented through various operational and technical means. They are covered in
domains, such as cryptography, telecommunication network security, access control, and so
on. Risk mitigation strategies to address risks in terms of the availability of assets is
addressed through the business continuity management processes.
In the business continuity domain, the focus is on specific threat events that could have a
devastating impact on the functioning of the organization as a whole and the IT
infrastructure in specific. Examples of such events are fires, floods, earthquakes, tornados,
terrorist attacks, and so on.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 41 ]
Generally, an organization may not have controls to prevent such events. Such events are
termed as disruptive events. In other words, an event that could impact regular operations
for a prolonged period of time is a disruptive event. Hurricane Katrina, the attacks on the
World Trade Center in 2001, or the collapse of large organizations, such as Enron, are
examples of disruptive threat events.
Business continuity management involves the following:
Risk analysis and review to identify disruptive threat events
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) to estimate potential
Strategies for safeguarding business interests
Business Continuity Plans (BCP) that are instituted to respond to potential threats
Tests and exercises to verify the continuity processes
Regular and systematic reviews through program management
Business continuity management consists of policies as stipulated by the senior
management, processes that involve business continuity-related activities, people with
required skill sets, and infrastructure resources to support critical business functions.
The Business Continuity Planning (BCP) process
Addressing the risks by way of plans and procedures for the continuation of business
operations during and after a disruptive event is called Business Continuity Planning
(BCP). The aim is to prevent interruptions to business operations.
This domain is concerned with the continuation of critical business processes and business
support systems in the event of an incident, emergency, or disaster. For example, critical 
business processes may include accounting, payroll, Customer Relationship Management
(CRM), and so on.
BCP involves the following:

3.
Developing the BCP.
4.
Implementing, testing, and creating awareness.
5.
Maintenance of plans.
6.
While designing the BCP, availability should be considered the primary factor. The
objective of BCP is to avoid any serious damage to the business also to enable the recovery
of information systems within an acceptable timeframe. This time frame is derived from
Business Impact Analysis.
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a type of risk assessment exercise that
tries to assess qualitative and quantitative impacts on the business due to a
disruptive event. Qualitative impacts are generally operational impacts,
such as the inability to deliver, while quantitative impacts are related to
financial losses.
BCP best practices
BCP should be as follows:
Appropriate: The scoping process should cover the essential resources
Adequate: Based on BIA, the adequacy of available resources pertaining to
continuity and recovery should be established
Complete: The plan should include all of the resources required based on the
analysis
BCP resources should include the availability of processes and the availability of people to
implement the processes.
The BCP process should include testing the plans and day-to-day functions/activities to be
performed to make the plan effective and ready at all times.
BCP measures should include preventative measures to control known issues and
facilitating measures to act in a timely manner on the issues that are not under the control of
the organization.
BCP should identify mission-critical systems, business impact due to the nonavailability of
critical systems (loss of revenue, loss of profits, inability to comply with laws, damage to
reputation, and so on), preventive controls, and recovery controls.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 43 ]
BCP objectives should include recovery time by way of Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
and recovery points by way of Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): A timeframe within which the systems
should be recovered (indicated in terms of hours/days). For example, if
RTO is less than 8 hours, then a virtual environment with active/passive
data center will an be significantly faster.
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): The maximum period of time (or
amount) of transaction data that the business can afford to lose during a
successful recovery. For example, if RPO is 10 mins, then the backup plan
should be to conduct backups every 10 mins.
Business continuity procedures should include the procedure for testing plans and the
procedure for updating plans.
The BCP should include the following:
Notification
Call trees
Response teams
Updating mechanism for contacts
Step-by-step procedure for recovery
Appropriate testing
Restoring normalcy to the primary website or stable state
Required records and the format of the records
Awareness of people
Security risk considerations in acquisitions,
strategy, and practice
Information systems include various components, such as operating systems and
application software, which may be off-the-shelf products or custom developed
applications, database management systems, infrastructure, and so on. During development
and/or implementation, security risks should be considered based on security requirements.
Some such requirements are listed here:

Note that detailed information and best practices are provided in various
chapters throughout this book.
Information security education, training, and
awareness
The information security domain consists of many concepts and definitions. Besides,
information security initiatives in an organization will have many policies, procedures, as
well as technology components. In order to have an effective security posture within the
organization, it is important that people or personnel are aware of security requirements,
organization-specific security policies and procedures, and most importantly, particular
personnel-specific roles and responsibilities pertaining to security.
Security awareness and training is one of the core components of the risk management
program in any organization. The objective is to ensure that the personnel are aware of the
security requirements and are trained to handle day-to-day security events.
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication 800-14 – Generally
Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology Systems, recommends
seven steps for a security awareness and training program. The standard groups the best
practices into three broad areas, which are identification, management, and the evaluation
of training and awareness programs.
In the identification phase, an organization would establish scope, goals and
objectives, training staff identification, and the audience.
In managing the program, an organization would motivate the management and
employees, manage administration, and maintain the training and awareness
programs.
Periodically, an organization will evaluate the program for its effectiveness.

Day 2 – Security and Risk Management - Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Security Education
[ 45 ]
The international standard ISO/IEC27002 Information technology – Security techniques-code of
practice for information security management is an acknowledged International Standard that
provides some of the best practices in various domains of information security. The
standard defines the following good practices a security professional should be aware of
pertaining to Security Awareness and Training:
Based on their job function, the standard emphasizes that all employees and,
where relevant, contractors and third-party users should be provided with
appropriate awareness training as well as regular updates in organizational
policies and procedures.
The induction program should consist of awareness training that covers the
organization's security policies and the security expectations. The personnel
should undergo such training before any access to information or services are
granted to them.
The training program should contain the security requirements of the
organization, legal responsibilities, business controls and, most importantly,
correct usage instructions that relate to information processing facilities.
Procedures related to log-on, appropriate usage of systems, networks, software
packages, and the explanation of disciplinary processes in case of policy or
procedure violations should be part of the training.
The training should also focus on known threats and enhance the awareness of
security incidents and problems and the way to respond to them based on the
personnel's role.
Summary
This chapter has covered foundational concepts in risk management. In a nutshell, risks
are from threat sources to assets. When a threat event exploits a vulnerability, it results in a
security violation, which could compromise the established CIA requirements of assets.
Risks to assets may cause loss or damage, which is estimated through risk analysis
methods. Security risks are managed through risk assessment, control implementation, risk
monitoring, and review procedures.
In the next two chapters, we will cover asset protection and security that forms the basis for
selection and implementation of technical and administrative controls.

Day 3 – Asset Security -
Information and Asset
Classification
Information security is the preservation of confidentiality and integrity and the availability
of assets. Assets have intrinsic value to the business and are classified into various types.
The type of asset and its value are used to determine the required level of security
assurance.
This chapter provides an overview of asset security. The concepts and techniques that
pertain to information assets are covered in detail throughout this chapter. Data security
concepts and controls are also covered in detail using suitable illustration and examples.
This chapter covers the following:
Overview of asset security
Overview of information and asset classification
Asset ownership
Classification types in government
Classification types in corporations
Overview of data privacy
Overview of data retention strategies

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 48 ]
Overview of asset security – information and
asset classification
Asset protection forms the baseline for security. Unintended disclosure, unauthorized
modification, or destruction of an asset can affect security. In other words, confidentiality,
integrity, and/or availability requirements will be affected.
As covered in Chapter 1, Day 1 – Security and Risk Management – Security, Compliance, and
Policies, assets are grouped based on their type, such as physical, hardware, information,
and so on. Similarly, assets are further classified based on their value and sensitivity. Value
can be monetary or based on other qualitative factors, such as loss in terms of people,
property, or image. Sensitivity is based on confidentiality factors and the effect of disclosure
to national security. For corporations, sensitivity is based on the extent of the loss of
corporate image.
Observe the following illustration:

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 49 ]
Asset classification and control
Information is a business asset and is of value to an organization. Information can exist in
various forms, such as printed on paper, spoken in conversations, stored in electronic
media, transmitted through e-mails and messages, and so on. Hence, irrespective of the
location of the asset, its protection is vital and is based on the classification. In turn,
classification is based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements.
Asset classification is based on asset value. Various parameters are used in the industry to
derive asset value. In general, asset value is based on the impact to the corporation in the
event of disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Impacts could be loss of business, loss of
corporate image, customer dissatisfaction, and so on. Hence, parameters to derive asset
value may include, monetary value, intellectual property value, competitive advantage,
privacy requirements, legal and regulatory requirements, and so on. Security controls for
asset protection are based on its value and its sensitivity. Hence, the asset type and its value
determine the level of security assurance required. Information assurance requirements
establish the required CIA values.
In a nutshell, asset classification is used to identify the type of information based on its
value, sensitivity, and the degree of assurance required. Classification helps to devise
suitable security controls.
The following parameters are applicable to information assets:
Classification criteria: Information assets are generally classified based on the
following:
Value
Age
Useful life
Personnel association based on privacy requirements, such as the
damage caused by loss or damage

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 50 ]
Owner: The owner of the information asset is responsible for its protection. The
owner plays the role of determining the classification level, periodical review,
and delegation.
Custodian: The custodian is the person delegated to maintain the information by
the owner. A custodian's role includes the backup and restoration of the
information and maintaining records.
User: A user uses the information. A user may be an employee, an operator, or a
third party. The role of the user is to exercise due care while handling the
information by following the operating procedures. A user is responsible for
using the information only for the authorized purpose.
Classification types in government
Governmental agencies classify information based on confidentiality requirements and on
the damage that might be incurred if the information is disclosed or compromised. This
classification schema enforces need to know principle for access.
The need to know principle establishes that one has to demonstrate
specific need to know or access to information that is classified as
sensitive. In other words, even if the primary clearance is available to the
user to access the information, whenever such sensitive information is
accessed, the user should establish the need to access the information.
For example, entering a data center may require an access card and also
writing down the date, time, and reason for access in the log book.
Another example could be: Joe has a secret clearance and works in IT. Joe
has access to most secret material, but is restricted from accessing details
of his companies latest aerospace project because his duties do not include
aerospace engineering, therefore he does not need to know.
The United States information classification
Information classification in the United States government is based on the effect of
compromise of the asset on national security. There is a specific classifications, such as Core
Secrets, for information assets within the National Security Agency (NSA) besides others.
They are:

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 51 ]
Core Secrets is the highest level of classification. In this classification, only select
individuals from the NSA and government have access to the information.
Top Secret is any information that will cause exceptional damage to national
security if disclosed to unauthorized entities. This is level 5 or the highest level of
classification after Core Secrets.
Secret information has a potential to cause serious damage to national security if
disclosed. This is one level down from Top Secret.
Confidential information could cause certain damage to national security when
disclosed to unauthorized entities. This is level 3 classification.
Public Trust is a type of information that may require background clearance to
access. This is neither confidential nor unclassified.
Unclassified information does not compromise confidentiality and its disclosure
will not have adverse impacts. This information is neither confidential nor
classified.
Classification types in corporations
Private and public sector corporate entities classify information under four categories.
These classifications are generic and vary between corporations and across countries. Some
of the top classification types are follows:
Confidential: This classification is used to denote that information is to be used
strictly within the organization. Its unauthorized disclosure will have adverse
effects. This is the highest level of classification in private sector or a corporation.
Private: This information classification is applicable to personnel information and
should be used strictly within the organization. Compromise or unauthorized
disclosure will adversely affect the organization and will have legal and
regulatory ramifications from privacy laws.
Sensitive: This classification is used to ensure higher confidentiality and integrity
requirements of the information asset. They are generally associated with
competitiveness and corporate image.
Public: This is an information classification applicable to all the information that
can be disclosed to everyone. However, unauthorized modifications are not
allowed. This is the lowest level of classification.

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 52 ]
Data privacy
Information assets that contain personal details of people are classified as private or
personal data. In other words, disclosure of personal data to third parties without the
consent of the data owner is a breach of privacy requirements of such assets. The data
owner is the individual associated with that data. The contents of data that can uniquely
identify a person or group of persons is called Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
There are legal and regulatory requirements that pertain to the collection, storage,
transmission, disclosure, retention, and destruction of personal information. References and
online links to such requirements are provided in Chapter 5, Day 5 – Exam Cram and
Practice Questions, of this book.
In information security, the requirement for data privacy is to share personal data in a
secure manner to third parties depending on the need and as required. This requirement is
to ensure that PII is not disclosed to unauthorized entities while sharing the information.
During data processing, various entities may access personal information, process, transmit,
or store it. When personal details are grouped together, it is called a record.
For example, records that contain personal information may include the following:
A health record that contains the physical and mental health of a person
An education record that contains the marks and grades associated with a
student
An insurance record that contains information about the individual
An employee record that contains the Employee ID and performance data
A customer record that contains credit card numbers or social security numbers
When the previous records are accessed or available in an accessible location, then, as per
data privacy requirements, there are limitations to who can access, process, modify, store,
or transmit such information.
Within personal data, some of the information is considered to be sensitive. The term
associated with this concept is sensitive personal data.
In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) classifies the following as sensitive
consumer data:
Financial data
Data about children
Health information

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 53 ]
Precise geographic location information
Social security numbers
As per the Data Protection Act of the UK, the following are considered as sensitive personal
data:
The racial or ethnic origin of the data subject
His/her political opinions
His/her religious beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature
Whether he/she is a member of a trade union
His/her physical or mental health or condition
His/her sexual life
The commission or alleged commission by him/her of any offence, or any proceedings for any offence
committed or alleged to have been committed by him/her, the disposal of such proceedings, or the
sentence of any court in such proceedings
Data owners
Data owners that pertain to privacy are the people identified in that record. The owner can
provide consent to process or share the personal information to others, such as
corporations. In such cases, the entity that processes, stores, or transmits the information on
behalf of the owner is called a licensee.
Data processors
When a third-party vendor is engaged by the licensee to create, receive, maintain, or
transmit personal information, such entities are called business associates or data
processors.
There are various privacy safeguard requirements pertaining to data processors in
international laws.
For example, in the USA, all the companies that are strictly engaged in activities that are
financial in nature are required to adhere to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the
GLBA privacy and safeguarding rules.

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 54 ]
All health care providers including health insurance companies and health care information
clearing houses are subjected to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA) privacy and security rules. Similarly, all schools and institutions that
receive funds from the department of education are subject to the Family Education Rights
and Privacy Act (FERPA).
In all the preceding laws, the legal obligations are passed on to the data processors as well.
Data remanence
Once the data is safely backed up or past its useful life, it needs to be deleted or purged
from the digital media. However, such erasure actions may not completely wipe the data
from the digital media. The possibility of residual data remains. Besides, in some systems,
only the table entries for the data are removed and not the data itself until it is overwritten.
Corporations regularly dispose of systems with digital media containing such residual data.
Data that remains even after erasing or formatting digital media is called residual data and
the property to retain such data is called data remanence.
Data remanence is the residual data that remains when the data is not
completely erased or destroyed. When the media is reused, this may result
in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. It is a good
practice to prevent media reuse by physically destroying the media
completely. In case of reuse, policies and procedures should be established
to ensure that the data is destroyed completely.
Data collection limitations
Privacy laws stipulate data collection limitations pertaining to personal data. Safeguards
include the following:
Data should be collected by lawful and fair means
Data should be collected with the knowledge and consent of the subject
Personal data collected should be relevant for the purposes for which it is
collected
Collected data to be accurate and kept up to date
Personal data should not be disclosed to other parties without the consent of the
subject
Personal data should not be used for other purposes than for what it was
collected

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 55 ]
Personal data should be safeguarded against intentional or inadvertent access,
use, disclosure, destruction, and modification
The following are some of the important privacy-related practices and laws across the
world that provide frameworks and limitations pertaining to personal data.
Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) is a best practices document jointly
developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) and Canadian Institute of
Chartered Accountants (CICA).
OECD privacy principles are guidelines on the protection of privacy and transborder flow
of privacy data. These principles were developed by the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD).
In the USA, there are a couple of Safe Harbor privacy laws to comply with European and
Swiss data protection requirements.
Hence, from the information security perspective, data collection, use, retention, and
destruction should be in accordance with established principles and best practices.
Data retention
Information in the form of data must be stored in digital media or in hard printed copies.
Based on the requirements of the law and based on corporate policies, data needs to be
retained even after its useful life. Data is also retained in media as a backup and used in
business continuity and disaster recovery scenarios.
Data in media
Data security also concerns the physical protection of equipment as well as addressing
security requirements pertaining to the media where the data is stored.
Storage media, such as hard disks, backup tapes, CDs, and diskettes, need additional
security measures so as to ensure the security of the data they contain. Controls should
ensure the prevention of data disclosure and modification by unauthorized entities.

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 56 ]
The following controls need to be considered for media security:
Storage controls are the primary means to protect the data in storage media, such as hard
disks, magnetic tapes, CDs, and so on. The primary consideration should be controlling
access to the data, which is usually achieved by encrypted keys. Additional security
considerations are required when the backup media is stored offsite.
Maintenance is a regular process to ensure that the data in the storage media is not
corrupted or damaged. Media handling procedures are used to ensure this.
The users and operators should be provided with the proper usage instructions to handle
the media.
Media usage should be in accordance with the established policies and procedures.
Data destruction is done by way of formatting the media. One time formatting may not
completely delete all the data. Formatting the media seven times for complete data
destruction is recommended by some of the standards.
Data in hardware
Theft is one of the most common threats that need to be addressed for personal computers,
laptops, or media protection.
The following controls need to be considered for protection from theft:
Cable locks are used to physically secure PCs and laptop computers. These locks
prevent the computer or laptop being detached and taken away.
Port protection is to ensure that media devices, such as CD-ROM, floppy drive, 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices such as memory sticks, Wireless-Fidelity
(Wi-Fi) ports, printers, and scanners are not accessible by unauthorized
personnel. The purpose of port protection is to prevent the download or transfer
of confidential information and/or intellectual property by unauthorized users to
a portable medium.
Switches are used to prevent a malicious user to power on/off the systems.
BIOS checks use password protection during the boot up process so that access
to the operating system is controlled.
Encryption is used to make the folders and files secure so that unauthorized
disclosure and modification is prevented.

Day 3 – Asset Security - Information and Asset Classification
[ 57 ]
Data with personnel
The information people possess in their memories also needs to be controlled and data
protection measures are applicable. Operational procedures, such as not discussing
confidential or personally identifiable information in public places or transmitting
information through publicly accessible mediums, should be discouraged.
Summary
This chapter has covered foundational concepts in asset security. In a nutshell, assets need
protection from unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure, modification, or destruction.
Hence, assets are classified based on factors, such as their value, useful life, and sensitivity,
to establish protection requirements. Data privacy is a critical requirement as per laws and
regulatory frameworks that are specific to safeguarding personal data. Data retention and
data remanence can pose security challenges in protecting the information and were
covered.
In the next chapter, Data Loss Prevention (DLP)-related terminologies, concepts, and
techniques will be covered.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data
Security Controls and Handling
This chapter provides an overview of data security controls and data handling using a high-
level illustration. Data can exist in different states in an organization. It can be in e-mails,
stored on a USB stick, printed on paper, or spoken in conversations. Hence, in any of these
states, appropriate security controls are necessary to protect such information assets.
The following topics are covered in this chapter:
Overview of data security controls
Overview of data handling
Data security requirements in standards and regulatory compliance
Data Loss Prevention-related concepts
Data Loss Prevention strategies and controls
Overview of asset security – data security
controls and handling
Critical data that may require CIA safeguards can exist in different states and reside in
multiple locations in your corporation. Data can be in motion, as in e-mails, or data can be
at rest, as in databases, or data can be in use, as in laptop or portable devices. Security
controls are required to protect the data in any state or location. However, protection
mechanisms vary depending on the data state.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 60 ]
Observe the following illustration:
Data security controls
Logical assets such as data that are in a intangible form need various levels of protection
based on the state they are in. Data protection requirements are based on the classification
of the information assets and CIA requirements such as legal, regulatory, and privacy
compliance.
Data security requirements
In the past decade, data in corporations has been growing exponentially. Some studies
indicate that the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of data is 70% or above. Besides,
an organization has to comply with various requirements during its operations. Compliance
requirements pertaining to data security are based on the CIA requirements and privacy of
data. Some of the following compliance requirements may be applicable to corporations.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 61 ]
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
(PCI DSS)
PCI DSS is a standard that pertains to payment card-related security requirements. The PCI
Security Standards Council is an open global forum that develops and maintains this
standard. Any entity that is involved in the payment card processing chain needs to comply
with the safeguards of this standard. There are six core objectives in this standard:
Network security has to be robust. Hence, an entity has to implement and
maintain a secure network and systems.
Cardholder data has to be protected from fraudulent transactions.
Vulnerability management program has to be maintained by the entities.
Access control measures have to be strong.
The monitoring and testing of the networks has to be regularly performed.
A formal maintenance of information security policy is mandatory.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
This is the US federal law that mandates various administrative controls pertaining to the
financial reporting of publicly traded companies in the United States. From an information
security perspective, this law mandates the demonstration of internal controls over financial
reporting systems. One of the key objectives of this act is to enforces segregation of duties to
reduce the chances of committing financial fraud.
Segregation of duties or separation of duties is a security control measure
to ensure that mutually exclusive roles are not assigned to a single user
concurrently. In other words, if two roles are required to complete the job
function and if one role ensures security, then they are mutually exclusive.
Examples of such roles include system administrator versus security
administrator, check signatory versus check approver, accounts receivable
versus accounts payable, and so on.
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
This act in the United Sates mandates privacy rules for financial institutions, their
customers, and their privacy rights. Various security safeguards are advised in the
safeguards rules. As per this act, developing an information security plan and the
protection of a client's nonpublic information are mandatory.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 62 ]
EU Data Protection Act (DPA)
This act is for the countries in the European Union and the primary focus is on data
protection pertaining to the privacy information of client data.
In a nutshell, corporations are challenged with the explosive growth of data and with more
and more regulations to protect the data and many channels of information exchange,
where data can be compromised. Hence, appropriate strategies are required for Data Loss
Prevention.
Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
Data can be traditionally grouped under three categories based on their criticality. They are
as follows:
Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Examples include birth dates,
employee numbers, Social Security Numbers, national identification numbers,
credit card information, personal health information, and so on.
Intellectual Property (IP): Examples include product design documents, the
source code of software, research information, patent applications, and customer
data.
Non-Public Information (NPI): Examples include financial information,
mergers—and acquisitions-related information and activities, corporate policies,
legal and regulatory matters, executive communication, and so on.
Compromising any of the preceding data will have adverse impacts on corporations.
Additionally, risk factors, such as employee behavior, customer treatment, and financial
controls, will also have an effect on organizations.
Data, whether it is PII, IP, or NPI, can exist in three states. Protection requirements in each
of the three states may vary based on the type and classification of the information.
The three states in which a data can exist are as follows.
Data in motion
This refers to information as it moves around the organization. Examples include e-mail,
FTP, and messaging:

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 63 ]
Data protection strategies for such information include the following:
Secure login and session procedures for file transfer services.
Encryption for sensitive data.
Monitoring activities to capture and analyze the content to ensure that
confidential or privacy-related information are is not transmitted to third parties
or stored in publicly accessible file server locations.
Data at rest
This refers to the information that is stored within the organization. Examples include
information stored in a file server and shared locations and information in databases:
Data protection strategies include secure access controls, the segregation of duties, and the
implementation of need to know mechanisms for sensitive data.
Data in use
This refers to information that is used by staff, as in laptops or portable devices, and
information that is being printed or copied to a USB stick. This is the data available in
endpoints.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 64 ]
Data security controls for data in use would include port protection and whole disk
encryption. Controls against shoulder surfing, such as clear screen and clear desk policies,
are also applicable to data in use controls:
Data Loss Prevention strategies
In general, the compromise of data in any of the preceding three states is called Data Loss
and the strategies to prevent such a loss are called Data Loss Prevention (DLP).
Controls for Data Loss Prevention include the following:
Security policy
Data classification
CIA requirements
Risk assessment
Devising suitable controls
Implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of controls
DLP controls
Preventative controls for addressing data loss issues are generally in the form of monitoring
activities and appropriate actions. For each of the data states, various types of controls are
required to ensure security.
Data breach or loss can happen in any of the three states, that is, data in motion, data at rest,
or data in use. Controls to prevent data loss can be either preventative or detective.
Preventative controls include access restrictions based on the classification of the data.
However, a 100% preventative environment is not feasible as the information technology
components are heterogeneous in nature. Since different products and technologies from
different vendors are used, a uniform policy to prevent data breach may be difficult to
implement.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 65 ]
Data loss is an incident. An attempt, whether malicious or inadvertent, to steal data or cause
data to be exposed should be identified through proper incident management controls and
appropriate actions have to be taken based on the criticality of the data.
Generally, DLP controls are based on the following:
What is the sensitivity or value of the information?
Who is causing the incident?
What actions were carried out by the individual to cause such an incident?
Who else is involved and where?
What action is taken?
For example, a user may be attaching a document containing confidential or PII to a web
mail website or saving company confidential financial information to a USB stick. Such
incidents require appropriate controls and actions to detect and prevent data loss or
leakage:
Data in motion, such as e-mails or posting to the web, requires controls, such as blocking
such an attempt, warning the user, alerting the monitoring team or the owner, and/or
forcing encryption for sensitive data.
Additional controls, such as informing the security team, capturing the data for
investigation, and redirecting the user to the appropriate training in data-handling
requirements can also be considered. If the data is malicious, then quarantining such data
may be necessary. Furthermore, and based on the incident's analysis, classifying the data
and/or additional supervision based on user behavior would be necessary to ensure
security.
Data at rest, such as files in file servers or records in databases, may require controls, such
as copying the data for analysis, moving the data to a safer location, stubbing the data with
a warning file, or reclassifying the data to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized access.
Besides these steps, reviewing, deleting malicious files, or capturing the event are some of
the additional actions that can be considered.
Data in use is data that is being printed or saved to external devices, such as USB or
portable hard disks. Suitable controls include blocking such activities, supervising the
activity, forcing encryption, and informing the monitoring team.
Furthermore, actions such as warning the user about the security policies, capturing the
data being copied for further analysis, and reclassification can be used to strengthen the
control environment.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 66 ]
Cryptographic methods to secure data
Data in native formats, such as texts, documents, or spreadsheets, may be easier to read
using a suitable application software. For sensitive data, additional controls may be
required to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure of such information. Cryptographic
methods offer the best solutions for such requirements. By using cryptographic methods,
confidentiality and integrity requirements can be addressed more effectively.
The following are some of the common cryptographic methods used in data security
controls.
Encryption
When data is encrypted, it means that the data is scrambled or transformed into an
unintelligible form with an appropriate key to unscramble it or, in other words, return it to
its original form. Without the key, data cannot be read either by humans or other
applications. The key is called the crypto variable. This method of data protection will
ensure confidentiality.
Hashing
Data may be altered or modified by an unauthorized entity to commit fraud. In order to
detect and prevent such unauthorized modifications, hashing or message digest methods
are used.
In hashing, based on the contents of the document, a cryptographic value is computed. The
computed value is called a checksum. By periodically recomputing the checksum and
validating it with the original computed value, it is possible to detect whether the document
is altered. This process helps ensure integrity.
Digital signatures
In digital communications, establishing the authenticity of the sender of the message is
essential and is very important for integrity assurance requirements.
Establishing the identity of the receiver or sender can be accomplished through digital
signatures. In other words, the authenticity of the data originating from the authorized
sender and access only by the intended receiver can be achieved through digital signatures
and encryption.

Day 4 – Asset Security - Data Security Controls and Handling
[ 67 ]
Note that cryptography and its concepts and methods are covered in
detail in Chapter 7, Day 7 – Security Engineering – Cryptography and
Physical Security.
Data handling requirements
Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of requirements during various
states that any data will pass through requires the secure handling of such data.
Appropriate policies and procedures should be established for handling sensitive data.
Handling sensitive information
Sensitive data such as confidential files need special care. Some of the best practices to
handle sensitive information include the following:
Secure disposal of media: Media containing sensitive data has to be disposed off
in a secure manner. Shredding in case of paper documents and pulverizing in
case of digital media are some of the methods used in media disposal.
Labelling: Appropriate labelling is important for sensitive data without
disclosing the type of content.
Access restrictions: The need to know principle is to be adopted while designing
and implementing access restrictions to sensitive data.
Formal records of authorized recipients of data: Recipients who are authorized
to access the data should be documented and approved.

Review of distribution lists: Periodic review of the distribution lists is necessary
to ensure that the data is not shared with obsolete or unauthorized entities.
Control of publicly available information: Suitable controls should be 
established to ensure that sensitive data is not disclosed or posted to publicly
available repositories or websites.
Summary
This chapter has covered foundational concepts in data security and the data handling
requirements of sensitive information. In a nutshell, data can exist in three states. They are
data in motion, data at rest, or data in use. The protection of data in any of these states is
called Data Loss Prevention. Sensitive data needs special handling requirements as the
compromise of such data would have devastating consequences.

CISSP CBK domain #1 – security and risk
management
The following information consists of some of the important concepts. They are presented
as bullet points that will serve as exam cram for this first domain:
Assets are tangible or intangible in nature.
Assets are used by the organization for business processes.
Assets have quantitative value such as monetary or qualitative value such as
corporate image.
Examples of assets are computers, operating systems, data, processes, products,
infrastructure, and so on.
Assets are grouped as physical, hardware, software, information, and personnel
assets.
Risk is defined as an exposure of the asset to loss, injury, and damage due to
threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.
Risk to assets is from threat sources.
Asset protection means identifying and implementing security controls.
Asset protection requirements are identified through a structured method of risk
analysis, evaluation, and assessment.
Risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk assessment, and risk mitigation strategies are
the components of risk management.
Risk analysis provides risk values in numeric terms, such as monetary values are
quantitative.
Risk analysis provides risk values in non-numeric terms, such as high-low-
medium are qualitative.
Security controls are identified through risk mitigation strategies.
Identifying threats and vulnerabilities, attacks, estimating potential impact, and
establishing and implementing suitable controls to treat the risk are functional
steps in risk management.

Day 5 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 72 ]
Risk treatment includes accepting, transferring, reducing, or avoiding risk.
Monitoring, reviewing, communicating the results, and improving the security
posture are continual improvement processes in the risk management cycle.
Security posture is an overall plan of the organization pertaining to its security. It
includes security governance, policies, procedures, and compliance.
Information security and risk management are analogous to each other.
Information security is a preservation of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability (CIA) of assets:
Confidentiality: Unauthorized users should not view the
information
Integrity: Unauthorized users should not modify the information
Availability: Authorized users are able to access the information
Threat is an event that could compromise information security by causing loss or
damage to assets.
A threat is predominantly external to organizational.
The examples of threats are fires, floods, hacking, and so on.
Vulnerability is a hole or weakness in the system. In other words, a vulnerability
is susceptible to threat.
Threat can exploit vulnerabilities through threat agents.
The threat agent exploiting a vulnerability is called an attack.
The end result of an attack could be a security violation.
Security violation is a compromise of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability requirement of the asset.
Information has a life cycle that includes handling, processing, transporting,
storing, archiving, and destroying.
Information protection includes risk management, risk reporting, and
accountability.
Senior management and the board should provide strategic oversight for the
implementation of security controls and they should ensure continual
effectiveness.
Aligning and integrating information security with enterprise and IT governance
frameworks is called information security strategy.
Information security strategy includes the definition of the current state of
security, goals, and objectives that align with the corporate mission.
The goal of an information security strategy is to understand protection
requirements.

Day 5 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions

CISSP CBK domain #2 – asset security
The following information is about some of the important concepts, presented as bullet
points, that will serve as exam cram for this second domain:
Asset security is based on asset classification and CIA values.
Asset classification is used to identify the type of information based on its value,
sensitivity, and the degree of assurance required.

Day 5 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 77 ]
Asset value is based on the impact to the corporation in the event of
unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
Asset classification helps to devise suitable security controls.
The classification of assets is based on criteria such as value, age, useful life, and
privacy.
Assets have owners, custodians, and users.
Governmental agencies classify information based on confidentiality
requirements.
The need-to-know principle establishes that one has to demonstrate a specific
need to know or access to the information that is classified as sensitive. An
individual will be granted access to the information only if it is required to
perform the duties of their job.
Information classification in the United States government is based on the effect
of the compromise of the asset on national security.
Core Secrets, Top Secret, Secret, Confidential, Public Trust, and unclassified are
the types of information classifications in the US.
Private and public sector corporate entities classify information under four
categories: confidential, private, sensitive, and public.
Information assets that contain personnel details of people are classified as
private or personal data.
In information security, requirement for data privacy is to share personal data in
a secure manner to third parties on a need basis.
In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) classifies sensitive consumer
data.
In the UK, the Data Protection Act specifies sensitive personal data.
Data owners that pertain to privacy are the personnel identified in the data.
When a third-party vendor is engaged by the licensee to create, receive, maintain,
or transmit personal information, such entities are called business associates or
data processors.
Data that remains even after erasing or formatting from digital media is called
residual data and the property to retain such data is called data remanence.
Privacy laws stipulate data collection limitations pertaining to personal data.
Data collection, use, retention, and destruction should be in accordance with
established principles and best practices.
Storage controls are the primary means to protect data in storage media, such as
hard disk, magnetic tapes, CDs, and so on.
Theft is one of the most common threats that need to be addressed for personal
computer, laptop, or media protection.

data protection pertaining to the privacy information of client data.
Data can traditionally be grouped under three categories such as Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), Intellectual Property (IP), and Non-Public
Information (NPI).
Data exists in three states: data in motion, data at rest, and data in use.
Data in motion refers to the information as it moves around the organization.
Information that is stored within the organization is considered to be data at rest.
Data in use refers to the information that is used by the staff and the data that is
available in endpoints.
Strategies to prevent data loss are called Data Loss Prevention (DLP).
Data Loss Prevention controls are based on who is causing the incident? What
actions are carried out by the individual to cause such an incident? Who else is
involved and where? What action is taken?
Cryptographic methods are used in data security controls.
Encryption means the data is scrambled with an appropriate key.
Encryption is used for ensuring confidentiality.
Hashing is a method in which cryptographic value is computed and periodically
validated based on the contents of the document.
Hashing is used for ensuring integrity. Hashes are generally one-way computed
values.
Establishing the identity of the sender in a digital communication is
accomplished through digital signatures.
Secure disposal of media, labeling, access restrictions, the formal record of
authorized recipients, the storage of media, data distribution, marking, the

Day 6 – Security Engineering -
Security Design, Practices,
Models, and Vulnerability
Mitigation
The security engineering domain consists of security design principles that are the building
blocks of secure software, hardware, and networking products. This domain also addresses
best practices, proven models, and processes that can be adapted during product design.
The focus of this domain is to ensure good security implementation. This domain also deals
with technical vulnerabilities and mitigation techniques. Additionally, cryptography and
physical security principles and practices are also covered in this domain.
A candidate appearing for a CISSP exam is expected to have foundational concepts and
knowledge in the following key areas of the security engineering domain:
Secure design principles
Security engineering practices
Security organizational processes
Information security models
Systems security evaluation models
Security capabilities in information systems
Vulnerability assessment and mitigation in information systems
Vulnerability assessment and mitigation in web-based systems
Vulnerability assessment and mitigation in mobile systems

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 84 ]
Vulnerability assessment and mitigation in embedded and cyber-physical
systems
The fundamentals of cryptography
The application of cryptography
Physical security principles for sites and facilities
Environmental security practices for sites and facilities
To get the most out this chapter, you need to understand and memorize subtle differences
between vulnerability testing and mitigation actions, security engineering and
organizational processes, and information security models and systems security evaluation
models.
An overview of security design, practices,
models, and vulnerability mitigation
Security engineering is based on design principles, practices, and models to ensure
confidentiality, integrity, and the availability requirements of information assets. The end
result could be the development of a product or supporting organizational processes.
Further, the product could be hardware, software, or a combination of both.
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the process or product that might creep in during design
stage, development, or in the end product. These weaknesses could be exploited for a
myriad of reasons that include fraud, stealing trade secrets, the Denial-of-Services, and so
on. Identifying vulnerabilities during design/development stage is critical to a secure an end
product. Since the Information Technology environment is complex and diverse, it may not
always be possible to foresee and identify all the possible vulnerabilities during the
design/development stage itself. Hence, vulnerability identification remains essential even
after the product or service roll-out. A robust security implementation needs mitigation
plans and ongoing maintenance.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 85 ]
Observe the following illustration:
The following bullet points represent a brief overview of the preceding diagram. These
points explain the overall structure of this chapter in a logical sequence:
IT assets can be grouped as software, hardware, and networking related
Software can be further grouped as operating systems, application software,
embedded software, mobile applications, and web applications
Hardware and networking systems may contain embedded software

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 86 ]
Security requirements should be addressed in a continual process through
design, development, and integration phases
Vulnerabilities might creep in during any of these phases
By adhering to software development engineering practices and security
organizational processes, vulnerability issues can be addressed
Secure design principles
System and application development consists of design, development, test, and deployment
processes. Security has to be addressed at every step in the development cycle. However,
addressing security in the design stage itself is most critical. Since prevention is better than
cure, addressing security at the design stage itself can facilitate preventative controls to
address security issues.
The computer architecture
The elements of a computer that are fundamental to its operations, together with the way
the elements are organized, are referred to as the computer architecture.
A computer is a physical device consisting of physical components. These physical
components are called hardware. The hardware components process the instructions and
data presented to them. The set of instructions and data is called software.
Some of the fundamental elements in the computer architecture are the input/output
systems, the CPU, and memory. A common plane connects the previous three and is called
a bus.
The following are the functions of each of these elements:
A central processing unit (CPU) is the heart and brain of a computer. Its primary
function is to process the instruction and data presented to it by other systems
such as application software through input/output systems. The process carried
out by the CPU is called executing the program.
An input/output (IO) systems interface with the CPU. Input/Output mechanisms
and structures enable the supply of input instructions and data to the CPU, and
they manage the output data from the CPU to appropriate interfaces.
The function of memory is to store the instructions and data either
permanently or temporarily. Computer memory can be categorized as

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 87 ]
primary memory and secondary memory.
Primary memory refers to a storage area that is directly addressable by the
CPU. The examples of such memory are cache, Random Access Memory
(RAM), and Read Only Memory (ROM).
Secondary memory refers to permanent storage that is indirectly
accessible by the CPU. Some examples are magnetic disks, tapes, and so
on.
Computer system
Telecommunication and networking technologies enable computers to communicate with
each other. A computer may act as a server or a client or both. Based on the role of a
computer in a network, the network architecture is classified as a client-server or
centralized model. Since interconnectivity is the primary goal, these models are generally
called distributed architecture.
Sometimes, the collection of hardware and software is together referred to as a computer
system.
A computer system can be categorized as an open system, a closed system, or a combination
of both.
An open system, as the name implies, is open to interconnectivity with other systems. It can
also be reviewed by independent third parties. This means an open system can be reviewed
and evaluated by third parties. In contrary, a closed system is proprietary in nature, and the
internal workings are not known; auditing such systems, such as code review or
architecture review is not feasible. Such systems may not be compatible with other systems.
From an asset classification and information security perspective, a computer is a physical
asset and the necessary physical security principles are applicable to it. The service
provided by a computer is called computing. It is treated as a service asset.
Various computing methods are available to improve the instruction execution cycle. An
instruction execution cycle is the time required to fetch the instruction and data from
memory, decode the information, and execute it.
When many operations are performed per instruction, such a computing is known as 
Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC). When instruction sets reduce the cycle time to
execute instructions, then the method is called Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC).
Instruction processing generally contains fetch, decode, and execute cycles.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 88 ]
When the fetch, decode, and execute cycles are overlapped by a set of instructions to reduce
the time cycle, then such a method is called pipelining.
From an information security perspective, computer architecture should take into
consideration the CIA aspects of computing services.
Trusted computing
In computer systems, establishing the level of assurance based on the defined security
models so that the computer system can be trusted for use in critical infrastructure is called 
trusted computing.
The following are some of the concepts that relate to information security aspects of a
trusted computing architecture:
Trusted computing base is as follows:
The totality of protection mechanisms within it
It includes hardware, firmware, and software
It is responsible for enforcing a computer security policy
Trusted computer system refers to systems that have a well-defined security
policy, accountability, assurance mechanisms, and proper documentation.
Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) is a set of basic
requirements to evaluate the effectiveness of computer security controls built into
computer systems. TCSEC is the United States Department of Defense (DOD)
standard and is popularly known as orange book.
Protection domain is a security function used to control or prevent direct access
by an insecure or lower-level entity to a secure higher-level entity. Software
programs, such as operating systems or applications, run in either the user-
protection domain or the kernel-protection domain.
When the protection domains are organized in a hierarchical format, then they
are called protection rings. The purpose of protection rings is to protect data and
the computing system from malicious behaviors of programs. For example,
sensitive and machine-critical data that is accessible to the operating system will
be in the inner rings. They will be protected from access or modification by the
programs that are on the outer-level ring.
Security perimeter is an outer ring of a trusted computing base or, in simple
terms, it is the outer ring of a protected domain or entity.
Trusted path refers to secure paths provided by software to communicate with
entities within  trusted rings to eliminate unauthorized access.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 89 ]
Encapsulation is a technique used to hide information from unauthorized
entities. This is analogous to a capsule in medicine. The contents within the
capsule are protected from environmental effects by the capsule shell.
Abstraction is the process of hiding the details and exposing only the essential
features of a particular concept or object that are encapsulated.
Reference monitor is a secure module that controls access to trusted, protected
entities in a trusted computing base.
Security kernel is a computer architecture consisting of hardware and software
elements that implement reference monitor.
Security label is a classification mechanism used to indicate the security levels of
entities. Examples of labels can be low, medium, or high or classified, secret, or
sensitive and so on based on the sensitivity of the data and function.
Logical security guard is a security mechanism to control the communication
between entities that are labeled low sensitive and high sensitivity.
Security modes are operating modes based on the operating level of the
information systems and the sensitivity level or the security label. Some of the
modes in which information systems operate are dedicated, compartmented,
controlled, and limited access.
Assurance
In information security, the term assurance means the level of trust or the degree of
confidence in the satisfaction of security needs. There are many standards and guidelines
published by the government and commercial organizations to evaluate the assurance
aspects of computer systems.
Common Criteria
Common Criteria (CC) is an assurance framework that is predominantly derived from the
following three country specific standards:
Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)
Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC)
Canadian Trusted Computer Product Evaluation Criteria (CTCPEC)
CC basically defines a Protection Profile (PP) for computing systems.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 90 ]
The following are some of the concepts pertaining to CC:
Target of Evaluation (TOE) is the target product or system that is to be
evaluated.
Security Target (ST) is principally a document that identifies the security
properties of the TOE. This document contains Security Functions Requirements
(SFR) that may be provided by the product or system.
Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) is a numerical rating based on the evaluation
level. EAL is based on Security Assurance Requirements (SAR). There are seven
levels of EAL starting from EAL1 (Basic) to EAL7 (most stringent).
Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) is also called the orange book in a
rainbow series published by the United States Department of Defense (DoD). The focus of
TCSEC is on confidentiality while the DoD's other standard, Trusted Network
Interpretation (TNI), which is also called the  red book, addresses confidentiality as well as
integrity.
Information Technology Security Evaluation Criteria (ITSEC) is a European standard for
IT security that specifies evaluation criteria for functionality and assurance. ITSEC divides
evaluation parameters as follows:
Functionality classes
Assurance levels
Correctness levels
Security functions
There are two kinds of assurances specified:
The correctness of security functions
The effectiveness of the Target of Evaluation (TOE)
Canadian Trusted Computer Product Evaluation Criteria (CTCPEC) is a Canadian
standard for security product evaluation published by the Communications Security
Establishment.
Certification and accreditation
Information systems need to be evaluated and they may also need to be certified based on a
set of defined parameters. There are many security certification and accreditation standards
for security assurance. The following topics describe a few important ones.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 91 ]
DITSCAP
Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation
Process (DITSCAP) is the standardized approach designed to guide DoD agencies through
the certification and accreditation process for a single information technology (IT) entity.
There are four phases to the DITSCAP process:
Definition: All the system requirements and capabilities are documented to
1.
include mission, function, and interfaces.
Verification: recommended changes to a system are performed and the resulting
2.
deliverable is a refined System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA).
Validation: This proceeds with a review of the SSAA.
3.
Post accreditation: Here, system changes are managed, system operations are
4.
reviewed, acceptable risk is maintained, and the SSAA is updated.
System Security Authorization Agreement (SSAA) is a document that
details system specifications, such as the system mission, target
environment, target architecture, security requirements, and applicable
data access policies. SSAA is a basis on which certification and
accreditation actions take place.
NIACAP
National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (NIACAP) is a
process for the certification and accreditation of the computer systems that handle the US
National Security information. It is derived from DITSCAP.
DIACAP
The DoD Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP) is a
standard that supersedes DITSCAP. This standard was published in 2006.
Security engineering practices
System Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM) is a system security
process maturity model that focuses on requirements pertaining to the implementation of
security in a system or a group of systems specifically in the Information Technology
security domain. It is a National Security Agency (NSA) sponsored effort.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 92 ]
There are 11 security engineering practices that are defined in SSE-CMM. They are as
follows:
PA01: Administer Security Controls
PA02: Assess Impact
PA03: Assess Security Risk
PA04: Assess Threat
PA05: Assess Vulnerability
PA06: Build Assurance Argument
PA07: Coordinate Security
PA08: Monitor Security Posture
PA09: Provide Security Input
PA10: Specify Security Needs
PA11: Verify and Validate Security
There are 11 more process areas and related project and organizational practices. They are
as follows:
PA12: Ensure Quality
PA13: Manage Configuration
PA14: Manage Project Risk
PA15: Monitor and Control Technical Effort
PA16: Plan Technical Effort
PA17: Define Organization's Systems Engineering Process
PA18: Improve Organization's Systems Engineering Process
PA19: Manage Product Line Evolution
PA20: Manage Systems Engineering Support Environment
PA21: Provide Ongoing Skills and Knowledge
PA22: Coordinate with Suppliers
Information security models
Computer security is based on the role of various entities within the system and their CIA
requirement. Information security models address the CIA requirements in computing
systems and data.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 93 ]
Take-grant model
This computer security model is also called the take-grant protection model and it specifies
obtaining (taking) rights from one entity and giving them to another or the transferring
(granting) of rights by one entity to another. There are two entities defined in this model: a
subject and object. In simple terms, this model proposes a directed graph that represents the
transfer of rights.
There are four rules in this model; they are as follows:
Take rule: The subject takes rights of another subject
Grant rule: The subject grants rights to another subject
Create rule: The subject creates new nodes
Remove rule: The subject removes its rights over an object
Bell-LaPadula model
This is a data-confidentiality model developed by David Elliot Bell and Len LaPadula. Since
the focus is on confidentiality, this model prescribes access controls to classified or
confidential information. This model specifies three security properties. The first two are
related to Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and the last is Discretionary Access Control
(DAC):
The Simple Security property states that a subject, at a given security level, may
not read an object at a higher security level (no read-up)
The *-property (star-property) states that a subject, at a given security level, must
not write to any object at a lower security level (no write-down)
The Discretionary Security property uses an access matrix to specify the
discretionary access control
A simple way to remember this model is: no read up and no write down.
Biba model
This model focuses on data integrity. This model was developed by Kenneth J. Biba.
This model states the following two rules:
Simple integrity axiom states that a subject, at a given level of integrity, may not
read an object at a lower integrity level (no read down)

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 94 ]
* (star) integrity axiom states that a subject, at a given level of integrity, must not
write to any object at a higher level of integrity (no write up)
A simple way to remember this model is: no read down and no write up.
Clark-Wilson model
This is an integrity model that was developed by David D. Clarke and David R. Wilson.
This model aims to address multi-level security requirements in computing systems.
Vulnerability assessment and mitigation
IT components, such as operating systems, application software, and networks have many
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are open to compromise or exploitation. This provides
a possibility of penetrating into systems that result in unauthorized access.
Vulnerability tests are done to identify vulnerabilities and penetration tests are conducted
to check the possibility of compromising systems such that the established access control
mechanisms may be defeated and the unauthorized access gained.
Otherwise, systems can be shutdown or overloaded with malicious data using techniques
such as the denial of service attacks such that access by legitimate users or processes maybe
denied.
The primary purpose of vulnerability and penetration tests is to identify, evaluate, and
mitigate the risks of vulnerability exploitation.
Vulnerability assessment
Vulnerability assessment is a process in which IT systems, such as computers, networks,
operating systems, and application software, are scanned for identifying the presence of
known and unknown vulnerabilities.
Vulnerabilities in IT systems such as software and networks can be considered to be holes
or errors.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 95 ]
Vulnerabilities creep into systems due to improper software design, insecure coding, or
both. For example, buffer overflow is a vulnerability where the boundary limits for an
entity, such as a variable and constants, are not properly defined or checked. Such a
vulnerability can be compromised by supplying data that is much more than the entity can
hold. This will result in data spill over other memory areas, which will corrupt the
instructions or code that need to be processed by the microprocessor.
Vulnerabilities can be compromised and such an act is called the exploitation of
vulnerabilities. When a vulnerability is exploited, it results in a security violation, which
will result in a certain impact. A security violation may provide unauthorized access, give
higher privileges, or stop some functions, which will result in the denial of service to IT
systems.
Tools are used in the process of identifying vulnerabilities. These tools are called
vulnerability scanners. A vulnerability scanning tool can be hardware based or a software
application.
Generally, vulnerabilities can be classified based on the type of security error. A type is the
root cause of such vulnerability.
 
Vulnerabilities may be classified into the following types:
Access control vulnerabilities: This is an error due to lack of enforcement
pertaining to users or functions that are permitted or denied access to an object or
resource:
Examples:
Improper or no access control list or table
No privilege model
Inadequate file permissions
Improper or weak encoding
Security violation and impact:
File/object/process can be accessed directly without
proper authentication or routing
Authentication vulnerabilities: This is an error due to inadequate identification 
mechanisms, such that a user or a process is not correctly identified:
Examples:
Weak or static passwords
Improper or weak encoding, weak algorithms, or
biometric errors

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 96 ]
Security violation and impact:
Unauthorized or less privileged users (e.g. Guest
user) or a less privileged process gains higher
privileges, such as administrative or root access to
system or Denial-of-Service from authorized
individuals being improperly denied.
Boundary condition vulnerabilities: This is an error due to inadequate
checking/validating mechanisms, so that the length of the data is not
checked/validated against the size of the data storage or resource:
Examples:
Buffer overflow
Overwriting the original data in the memory
Security violation and impact:
Memory is overwritten with some arbitrary code so
as to gain access to programs; or corrupting the
memory, which will crash the operating system. An
unstable system due to memory corruption may be
exploited to get command prompt or shell access by
injecting an arbitrary code.
Configuration weakness vulnerabilities: This is an error due to improper
configuration of system parameters or leaving the default configuration settings
as it is, which may not be secure:
Examples:
Default security policy configuration
File and print access in Internet connection sharing
Security violation and impact:
Most of the default configuration settings of software
applications are published and available in the
public domain. For example, some applications come
with standard default passwords, which, when not
changed to a secure one, allow an attacker to
compromise the system. Configuration weaknesses
are exploited to gain higher privileges resulting in
privilege escalation impacts.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 97 ]
Exception handling vulnerabilities: This is an error due to improper setup or
coding, such that the system fails to handle or properly respond to exceptional or
unexpected data or conditions:
Examples:
Structured Query Language (SQL) Injection
Security violation and impact:
By injecting exceptional data, user credentials can be
captured by an unauthorized entity
Input validation vulnerabilities: This is an error due to lack of verification
mechanisms to validate the input data or contents:
Examples:
Directory traversal
Malformed URLs
Security violation and impact:
Due to poor input validation, access to system-
privileged programs may be obtained.
Randomization vulnerabilities: This is an error due to a mismatch in random
data used in the software process. Such vulnerabilities are predominantly related
to encryption algorithms:
Examples:
Weak encryption key
Insufficient random data
Security violation and impact:
Cryptographic key can be compromised, which will
impact data and access security
Resource vulnerabilities: This is an error due to a lack of resources available for
correct operations or processes:
Examples:
Memory getting full
CPU is completely utilized
Security violation and impact:
Due to lack of resources, the system may become
unstable or hang. The impact could be Denial-of-
Services to legitimate users.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 98 ]
State Error: This is an error due to the lack of state maintenance because of an
incorrect process flow:
Examples:
Opening multiple tabs in web browsers
Security violation and impact:
There are specific security attacks, such as cross-site-
scripting, which will result in user-authenticated
sessions being hijacked.
Information security professionals need to be aware of the processes involved in identifying
system vulnerabilities and they need to devise suitable counter measures. Some such
measures are applying patches supplied by application vendors and hardening systems.
Penetration testing
While vulnerability assessment and remediation is used to strengthen the computer system,
it is also important to perform suitable penetration tests periodically to identify the
possibilities of system compromise. The primary purpose of penetration tests is to identify
the exploitation possibilities of an identified vulnerability.
Vulnerability assessment and the penetration
testing process
The following diagram illustrates the process of Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration
Testing (VAPT):

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 99 ]
Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing contains the following processes:
Scope: While performing assessment and testing, the scope of the assignment
needs to be clearly defined. The following are the three possible scopes that exist:
1. Testing from an external network with no prior knowledge of the
internal networks and systems is referred to as black box testing.
2. Performing the test from within the network is refereed to as
internal testing or white box testing.
3. Testing from an external and or internal network with the
knowledge of internal networks and systems is referred to as gray
box testing. This is usually a combination of black box testing and
white box testing.
Information gathering: The process of information gathering is obtaining as
much information as the possible about the IT environment, such as networks, IP
addresses, the operating system version, and so on. This is applicable to all three
types of scope discussed previously.
Vulnerability detection: In this process, tools such as vulnerability scanners are
used and vulnerabilities are identified in the IT environment by way of scanning.
Information analysis and planning: This process is used to analyze the identified
vulnerabilities combined with the information gathered about the IT
environment to devise a plan for penetrating the network and systems.
Penetration testing: In this process, target systems are attacked and penetrated
using the plan devised in the earlier process.

Day 6 – Security Engineering - Security Design, Practices, Models, and Vulnerability Mitigation
[ 100 ]
Privilege escalation: After successful penetration into the system, this process is
used to identify and escalate access to gain higher privileges such as root access
or administrative access to the system.
Result analysis: This process is used to perform a root cause analysis as a result
of successful compromise of the system, leading to penetration and devising
suitable recommendations, to make the system secure by plugging holes in the
systems.
Reporting: All the findings that are observed during the vulnerability assessment
and penetration testing processes need to be documented, along with
recommendations, to produce a testing report for the management for suitable
actions.
Cleanup: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing involves
compromising the system, and during the process, some files may be altered. The
cleanup process is applied to ensure that the system is brought back to the
original state before the testing, by cleaning up (restoring) the data and files used
in the target machines.
CVE and CVSS
Many security groups, vendors and other organizations that are involved in vulnerability
research identify vulnerabilities in systems almost daily. There are lots of variations in
terms of these reported vulnerabilities by different vendors. Sometimes, it is difficult to
identify whether a reported vulnerability by different vendors is the same or different.
To address this anomaly, many the security vendors, software vendors, and other similar
business groups formed a worldwide effort and the outcome of this group is an online
dictionary of vulnerabilities and exposures. This online dictionary is called Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and is sponsored by the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) of the USA.
CVE being an online dictionary of vulnerabilities, there is an effort by National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, as part of their Information Security Automation
Program (ISAP), provides a criticality rating or scoring for CVE listed vulnerabilities. This
scoring is called the Critical Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and it is contained in an
online database called the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).

Summary
This chapter covered foundational concepts in the security engineering domain. Hardware,
software, or networking systems need to be secure, for which adherence to security best
practices during design, development, and integration is essential. Security standards and
models provide a baseline for developing and maintaining secure systems. During various

Day 7 – Security Engineering -
Cryptography
This chapter gives an overview of cryptography, its requirements, concepts, application,
attacks, and management using a high-level illustration. Understanding and applying
cryptography and its use in preserving the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive assets as
well as attacks on cryptographic systems and cryptographic standards are some of the main
topics covered in this chapter.
An overview of cryptography
Sensitive assets need protection from unauthorized disclosure or tampering. The sensitivity
of assets is determined by confidentiality and integrity requirements and the impact of
compromise on the corporation or national security. Cryptographic methods and solutions
provide assurance to protect assets from compromise.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 105 ]
Observe the following illustration:
The following bullet points represent a brief overview of the preceding diagram. These
points explain the overall structure of this chapter in a logical sequence:
Sensitive assets require an additional level of security pertaining to
confidentiality and integrity.
Additional security requirements of confidentiality and integrity can be assured
through the application of cryptographic methods.
The fundamentals of cryptography are related to encryption and the methods of
encryption.
Various types of encryption methods are used in the cryptography domain based
on their characteristics, such as the type of algorithm used, the key length, and
the application.
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is an industry standard framework, which
enables the integration of various services that are related to cryptography.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 106 ]
Key management techniques are important from the perspective of cryptographic
key generation, distribution, storage, validation, and destruction.
Cryptographic key can be compromised. Compromises can be due to a weak
algorithm or weak keys. Many methods of cryptanalytic attacks exist to
compromise keys.
Cryptographic standards provide tools and best practice methods to secure
information and keys from cryptanalytic attacks.
The rest of this chapter covers these concepts in detail.
The fundamentals of cryptography
Cryptography is an art as well as a science that involves the process of transforming plain
text into scrambled text and vice versa. The purpose of cryptography is to conceal
confidential information from unauthorized entities and ensure immediate detection of any
alteration made to the concealed information. Concealing the original information that is in
human or machine-readable format is achieved by a method called encryption.
The methods of encryption
A plain text in the cryptographic context is information that is in a human or machine-
readable format that needs protection. For example, the password that you are typing is in 
plain text. Similarly, documents such as business agreements, MOU, and so on are in plain
text.
Scrambled text in the cryptographic context is called a cipher text. A cipher text is the
scrambled version of the plain text. Cipher text is not in a human or machine-readable
format.
The functions of cryptography are to keep the plain text secret by way of scrambling and
detecting unauthorized changes to such information. These functions are for the purposes
of confidentiality and integrity.
The cryptographic process
The process of converting plain text into scrambled (cipher) text is called encryption. The
process of encryption is also called enciphering. Hence, cipher text can be called encrypted
text.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 107 ]
The process of converting scrambled (cipher) text into plain text is called decryption. The
process of decryption is also called deciphering. The output of decryption is plain text or
decrypted text.
Cryptographic algorithms
Encryption as well as decryption is based on algorithms. An algorithm, in cryptography, is
a series of well-defined steps that provide the procedure for encryption/decryption. For
example, if we use a scrambling method that substitutes the alphabets with the next
alphabet, then we're using a type of substitution algorithm. In this type of algorithm A=B,
B=C….Z=A. Hence, in this algorithm, a word such as WELCOME will be represented as
XFMDPNF. As you can see, this example uses only one step, but complex algorithms use
multiple steps with different mathematical formulae.
Julius Caesar used a type of shift3 cipher (substitution by third alphabet)
to communicate military secret messages.
An example of a shift3 cipher is here:
WELCOME ~ shift by 3 letters would give ~ ZHOFRPH
The algorithm that is used for encryption as well as decryption is referred
to as cipher.
A cryptographic key is also called a Crypto variable, and it is used on the operation for
encryption and decryption of a text. This is analogous to the keys that we use in household
padlocks. If you observe the physical key, you can find varying slots. These are called
tumblers or levers. By adjusting the levers, different types of key combinations are obtained.
Similarly, in cryptography, we use an electronic key (cryptographic key) to lock or unlock a
plain text, document, or any electronic data.
The cryptographic method
A cryptographic method is a way of doing encryption and decryption in a systematic way.
The following diagram illustrates a cryptographic method:

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 108 ]
In the preceding process, message (M) from the sender is encrypted and results in the
cipher text (C). A cryptographic key (K) is used in the encryption process. When cipher text
is decrypted, it results in the original message. The same key (K) that was used for
encrypting is required for decrypting (D) the cipher text. This process is represented as
EK(M)=C and DK (C)=M, where E is encryption, K is for key, M is for message, C is for a cipher
text, and D is for decryption.
Decrypting an encrypted message (cipher text) will result in an original
message. This process can be represented as D[EK(M)]=M.
Types of encryption
Cryptography is based on algorithms and the keys that operate on them. Types of
encryption or decryption are based on the combination of these two factors (algorithms and
keys). There are two types of encryption predominantly used in government agencies as
well as corporations. Either there is a single key or there are two keys:
If only one key is used, then it is called symmetric key encryption
If two keys are used, then it is called asymmetric key encryption
There is also a method in cryptography that uses no keys. If no key is
used, then it is called hashing. It uses no keys and applies a one-way
function of computing a hash value (sometimes called a checksum) from
the original or scrambled text. Hashing is used for the assurance of
integrity.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 109 ]
Symmetric key encryption
In symmetric key encryption, only one key is used. The name symmetric implies that the
key used for encryption as well as for decryption is the same. This type of encryption is also
called Secret Key Cryptography (SKC).
Based on the algorithm used, this symmetric key encryption can be categorized into two
types:
Stream cipher: When the key stream algorithm operates on a single bit, byte, or a
computer word such that the information is changed constantly, then it is called
a stream cipher. For example, in a stream cipher, if we want to encrypt a word
such as WELCOME, then each of the alphabets in the word will be encrypted using
the algorithm. The Caesar shift3 algorithm is a stream cipher.
Block cipher: If the algorithm operates on a block of text (as opposed to a single
bit or byte), then it is known as a block cipher. In this case, the algorithm will
encrypt the entire word.
The following are some of the examples of algorithms that are commonly used in the
industry.
The examples of stream cipher is given here:
The Rivest Cipher (RC4) algorithm uses about 40 to 256 bits and the key sizes are
different. It is considered good for speed and is to be used in less-complex
hardware. Some of the examples where RC4 is used are in protocols such as
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
The examples of block cipher are given here:
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher that uses up to 56-bit keys and
operates on 64-bit blocks. It was designed by International Business Machines
(IBM) and adopted by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST).
Triple-DES (3DES), as the name implies, uses three 56-bit keys that pass over the
blocks three times.
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a 128-bit block cipher that employs 128,
192, or 256 bit keys. This is based on the NIST specifications and is the official
successor to DES.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 110 ]
The present AES uses an algorithm known as Rijndael that uses a variable
block as well as key lengths.
Blowfish is an algorithm that uses variable key lengths of 32 to 448 bits that work
on 64-bit blocks.
Twofish is a block cipher that uses 128, 192, or 256-bit keys on 128-bit blocks.
And is considered to be more secure.
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) is a block cipher that uses 128-
bit keys on 64-bit blocks.
The operation modes of block ciphers
The following are the different operational modes of block ciphers:
When a cipher text block is formed by the application of a secret key to encrypt
the plain text block, it is called Electronic Code Book (ECB).
When plain text is eXlusively-ORed (XORed) with the previous block of cipher
text then the mode is called Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
Cipher FeedBack (CFB) is a mode that allows encrypted data units to be smaller
than the block unit size.
Output FeedBack (OFB) uses an internal feedback mechanism such that the same
plain text block cannot create the same cipher text block.
Initialization vectors are a block of bits that allow either a stream cipher or a
block cipher to execute on any of the previous modes. It is usually a random
number that is applied to ensure that the cipher text is different when the same
message is encrypted twice.
Asymmetric key encryption
In this type, there are two keys. The name asymmetric implies that the keys are not the
same. This type of encryption is also called Public Key Cryptography (PKC):

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 111 ]
The two keys that are used in this type are called the private key and the public key. They
are used in combination to encrypt and decrypt the message or text.
The following are important concepts in public key cryptography:
There are two keys (private and public).
The private key is kept secret.
The public key is widely distributed.
An entity's (a person or a software application) private and public keys are
related by way of a mathematical algorithm.
It is not possible to derive the private key from the public key.
The body of the message is encrypted using the recipient's public key. Hence,
only the recipient's private key can be used to decrypt the message. This ensures
the confidentiality of the message. For example, if Bob wants to send a document
to Alice and he does not want anyone to else be able to read this document, then
Bob will encrypt the document using Alice's public key. Then, only Alice can
open the document using her private key.
Digital signature is a type of public key cryptography where the message is digitally signed
using the sender's private key. Digitally signing means encrypting the hash value. This can
be verified using sender's public key. This is to verify the authenticity of the sender. For
example, Bob will digitally sign the message that he is sending to Alice using his private
key. Alice can verify the authenticity using Bob's public key.
One of the most important applications of public key cryptography is to ensure non-
repudiation. Non-repudiation is a method by which the sender of the message can deny
their actions.
Asymmetric key encryption uses one-way functions that are easier to
compute on one side and difficult to do the same on reverse.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 112 ]
The following are examples of algorithms that are commonly used in the industry:
Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm
named after its inventors. It uses a variable size encryption block as well as a
variable size key. The algorithm uses a product of two large prime numbers to
derive the key pairs.
Diffie-Hellman method is used primarily for private-key exchange over an
insecure medium.
ElGamel is similar to Diffie-Hellman and is used for exchanging keys.
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an algorithm that generates keys from
elliptical curves.
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is specified by NIST under Digital
Signature Standard (DSS). This algorithm is primarily used for authentication
purposes in digital signatures.
Hashing
Hashing or hash functions are a type of encryption where a key is not used. Instead, a hash
value is computed based on the contents of the message. The computed value is called
a checksum. The purpose of hashing is to provide integrity checking to the plain or
encrypted text.
Hashing is also called message digest or one-way encryption as there is
no decryption but only validating the computed checksum.
The following are some of examples of algorithms that are commonly used in the industry:
Message Digest Algorithm (MD) are series of hashing algorithms that produce
128-bit hash values from an arbitrary length message.
Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) is based on NIST's Secure Hash Standard (SHS),
which can produce hash values that are 224, 256, 384, or 512 bits in length.

The key length and security
In cryptography, the length of keys is not the only factor that indicates its strength or
security. While short key means less secure, the same is not true for the reverse; that is,
longer keys do not automatically translate into stronger security. The security of an
encryption lies in the quality of the encryption algorithm and the entropy of the key.
The entropy of a key in cryptography means the uncertain portions of key combinations. In
other words, entropy is related to the randomness of the key combinations. Hence, a 128-bit
key may not have 128-bits of entropy. The more the entropy, the stronger the key and it
requires more time and computing power to try the combinations.

Applications and the use of cryptography
Cryptographic systems are the common implementations of standard algorithms. They may
be used in applications and embedded systems.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 115 ]
The following are some systems that are popular:
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
are protocols that provide communication security by encrypting sessions while
using the Internet. They use many of the cryptographic algorithms discussed
previously. Some of the activities that can be secured by TLS or SSL are web
browsing, e-commerce transactions such as online shopping, banking, and more,
and instant messaging or Internet chat.
Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) is a set of standard protocols for securing
credit card transactions over insecure networks. SET uses digital certificates and
public key cryptography. One of the primary applications is to ensure security
while using credit cards over the Internet.
IPSec is a set of protocols to secure Internet communication. Authentication and
encryption are the key functions. IPSec is primarily used in the implementation of
Virtual Private Networks (VPN).
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) was developed by Zimmermann, is a software
package that supports secure e-mail communications. Some of the security
services provided by PGP include message encryption, digital signatures, data
compression, and e-mail compatibility. PGP uses International Data Encryption
Algorithm (IDEA) for encrypting the message and it uses RSA for key exchange
and digital signature.
Secure Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) uses public key
cryptography to provide authentication for e-mail messages through digital
signatures. This system uses encryption for the confidentiality of e-mail
messages. This standard defines how both parts of e-mail (header and body) can
be constructed. This standard is also called an extended Internet e-mail standard,
as it defines the usage of multimedia content, such as picture, sound, video, and
so on, in e-mail messages. MIME itself does not provide security. S/MIME is an
encryption protocol and provides digital signature capabilities to e-mail
messages. S here denotes secure.
Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (SHTTP) is a protocol that introduces an
authentication/encryption layer between the Hyper Text Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) so as to secure the
communications for the World Wide Web (WWW).
Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol that establishes a secure channel between two
computers for communication purposes.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 116 ]
Kerberos is an encryption and authentication service. Kerberos is designed to
authenticate network resources and it does not provide any third-party
verification (as opposed to digital signatures). Kerberos maintains a centralized
server that performs the functions of key distribution and session authentication
between two network resources. A single point of compromise would be the
Kerberos server itself.
Steganography refers to the art of concealing information within computer files,
such as documents, images, or any multimedia content. This is opposed to
obscuring information by encryption. Only the sender and receiver can know the
presence of the hidden message.
Digital Watermarking is a method by which copyright information is embedded
in digital content, such as documents, images, and multimedia files.
SecureID is a two-factor authentication system developed by Security Dynamics.
This uses a randomly generated number along with a PIN or password for
authentication purposes. This is used in local as well as remote access computers.
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a set of standards for wireless
communications using devices such as mobile phones. The encryption
technology is used in Wireless Transport Layer Security (WTLS).
IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards for Wireless Local Area
Networking (WLAN). Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and
Wireless (WI-FI) Protected Access (WPA) are the commonly used protocols for
encryption in this communication standard.
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
PKI is a framework which enables the integration of various services that are related to
cryptography.
The aim of PKI is to provide confidentiality, integrity, access control, authentication, and
most importantly non-repudiation.
Non-repudiation is a concept or a way to ensure that the sender of a
message cannot deny in future the sending of such a message. This is the
confirmation of the authenticity of the sender's message. Because it is
encrypted with a private key, and only one person has the private key, it
has to be this person who sent the message/e-mail. One of the important
audit checks for non-repudiation is the time stamp. The time stamp is an
audit trail that provides the information on the time the message was sent.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 117 ]
Encryption/decryption, digital signature, and key exchange are the three primary functions
of a PKI.
RSS and Elliptic curve algorithms provide all three primary functions; that is,
encryption/decryption, digital signature, and key exchange. The Diffie-Hellman algorithm
supports key exchange while the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) is used in the digital
signature.
Public Key Encryption is the encryption methodology used in PKI and was initially
proposed by Diffie and Hellman in 1976. The algorithm is based on mathematical functions
and it uses asymmetric cryptography; that is, it uses a pair of keys:
The preceding image represents a simple document-signing function. In PKI, every user
will have two keys called a pair of keys. One key is called a private key and the other key is
called a public key. The private key is never revealed and it is kept with the owner. The
public key is accessible by everyone and is stored in a key repository.
A key can be used to encrypt or decrypt a message. The key pairs work together and, based
on their function, they can either encrypt or decrypt (not both for the same info/function).
Most importantly, a message that is encrypted with a private key can only be decrypted
with a corresponding public key and, similarly, a message that is encrypted with a public
key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key.
In the preceding example image, Bob wants to send a confidential document electronically
to Alice. Bob has four issues to address before this electronic transmission:
To ensure that the contents of the document are encrypted such that the
document is kept confidential.
To ensure that the document is not altered during transmission and maintain
integrity.
Since Alice does not know Bob, he has to somehow prove that the document is
indeed sent by him; that is, source authenticity.
To ensure that Bob cannot deny sending it in the future.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 118 ]
PKI supports all four requirements by way of methods such as secure messaging, message
digest, digital signature, and non-repudiation services.
Secure messaging
To ensure that the document is protected from eavesdropping and not altered during the
transmission, Bob will first encrypt the document using Alice's public key. This ensures two
things: one, that the document is encrypted, and two, only Alice can open it as the
document requires the private key of Alice to open it. In summary, encryption is done using
the public key of the receiver, and the receiver decrypts with his/her private key. In this
method, Bob could ensure that the document is encrypted and the intended receiver (Alice)
only can open it. However, Bob cannot ensure whether the contents are altered (Integrity)
during transmission by just document encryption.
In summary, when confidentiality is required, the sender will use the receiver's public key
to encrypt the message body.
Message digest
In order to ensure that the document is not altered during transmission, Bob performs a
hash function on the document. The hash value is a computational value based on the
contents of the document. This hash value is called message digest. By performing the same
hash function on the decrypted document, the message digest can be obtained by Alice and
she can compare it with the one sent by Bob to ensure that the contents are not altered.
This process will ensure the integrity requirement. However, the hash (message digest) will
be encrypted using the public key of the receiver. Otherwise, without encrypting the hash
(message digest), a hacker could simply alter the information and recompute a hash for the
manipulated data. Because a digital signature is protected by the sender's private key, the
encrypted hash could not be recreated.
Digital signature
In order to prove that the document is sent by him to Alice, Bob needs to use a digital
signature. Digital signature means applying a sender's private key to the message,
document, or to the message digest. This process is called signing. The message can only be
decrypted using the sender's public key:

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 119 ]
Bob will encrypt the message digest with his private key to create a digital signature. In this
scenario, Bob will encrypt the document using Alice's public key and he will digitally sign it
using his private key. This ensures that Alice can verify that the document was sent by Bob.
She can do so by verifying the digital signature (Bob's private key) using Bob's public key
(remember a private key and the corresponding public key are linked, albeit
mathematically). She can also verify that the document is not altered by validating the
message digest. She can also open the encrypted document using her private key.
Message authentication is an authenticity verification procedure that
facilitates verifying the integrity of the message as well as the authenticity
of the source from which the message is received.
The digital certificate
By digitally signing the document, Bob has assured that the document was sent by him to
Alice. However, he has not yet proved that he is Bob. To prove this, Bob needs to use a
digital certificate. That is, digitally signing with the private key should prove Bob is
genuine.
A digital certificate is an electronic identity issued to a person, system, or an organization
by a competent authority after verifying the credentials of the entity. A digital certificate
contains a public key that is unique for each entity. A certification authority issues digital
certificates.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 120 ]
In PKI, digital certificates are used for authentic verification of an entity. An entity can be an
individual, system, or an organization.
An organization that is involved in issuing, distributing, and revoking digital certificates is
known as a certification authority (CA). A CA acts as a notary by verifying an entity's
identity. A Certification Authority is a trusted third party. A CA digitally signs and
publishes the public key of the user. This is done using the CA's private key. Hence, the
trust of the user relies on the trust of the CA.
One of the important PKI standards pertaining to digital certificates is X.509. This is an 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) published standard. It specifies, among
other things, the standard format for digital certificates.
PKI also provides the key exchange functionality that facilitates a secure exchange of public
keys so that authenticity of the parties can be verified. Hence, the significant function is for
PKI to be used for the secure exchange of session (symmetric) keys.
Key management techniques
Cryptographic keys go through a life cycle. From the generation of keys, to their safe
destruction, keys have to be managed according to the established policies and procedures.
Key management procedures
Key management consists of four essential procedures concerning public and private keys.
They are as follows:
Secure generation of keys: Procedures to ensure that the private and public keys
1.
are generated in a secure manner.
Secure storage of keys: Procedures to ensure that keys are stored securely.
2.
Secure distribution of keys: Procedures to ensure that keys are not lost or
3.
modified during distribution.
Secure destruction of keys: Procedures to ensure that the keys are destroyed
4.
completely once the useful life of the key is over.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 121 ]
Type of keys
NIST Special Publication 800-57, titled Recommendation for Key Management – Part 1:
General, specifies the following nineteen types of keys:
Private signature keys: They are private keys of public key pairs and are used to
generate digital signatures. They are used to provide authentication, integrity,
and non-repudiation.
Public signature verification key: This is the public key of the asymmetric
(public) key pair. It is used to verify the digital signature.
Symmetric authentication keys: They are used with symmetric key algorithms to
provide the assurance of integrity and source of the messages.
Private authentication key: This is the private key of the asymmetric (public) key
pair. It is used to provide assurance of the integrity of information.
Public authentication key: This is a public key of an asymmetric (public) pair
that is used to determine the integrity of information; and to authenticate the
identity of entities.
Symmetric data encryption keys: They are used to apply confidentiality
protection of information.
Symmetric key wrapping keys: They are key encryption keys in the sense that
they are used to encrypt other symmetric keys.
Symmetric and asymmetric random number generation keys: They are used to
generate random numbers.
Symmetric master key: This is a master key that is used to derive other
symmetric keys.
Private key transport keys: They are the private keys of asymmetric (public) key
pairs that are used to decrypt keys, which have been encrypted with the
associated public key.
Public key transport keys: They are the public keys of asymmetric (public) key
pairs that are used to decrypt keys that have been encrypted with the associated
public key.
Symmetric agreement keys: They are used to establish keys such as key
wrapping keys, data encryption keys, and so on using a symmetric key
agreement algorithm.
Private static key agreement keys: They are the private keys of asymmetric
(public) key pairs that are used to establish keys such as key wrapping keys, data
encryption keys, and so on.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 122 ]
Public static key agreement key: They are public keys of asymmetric (public) key
pairs that are used to establish keys such as key wrapping keys, data encryption
keys, and so on.
Private ephemeral key agreement keys: They are private keys of asymmetric
(public) key pairs that are used only once to establish one or more keys such as
key wrapping keys, data encryption keys, and so on.
Public ephemeral key agreement key: They are the public keys of asymmetric
(public) key pairs that are used in a single key establishment transaction to
establish one or more keys.
Symmetric authorization keys: These keys are used to provide privileges to an
entity using the symmetric cryptographic method.
Private authorization key: This is a private key of an asymmetric (public) key
pair that is used to provide privileges to an entity.
Public authorization key: It is the public key of an asymmetric (public) key pair
that is used to verify privileges for an entity that knows the associated private
authorization key.
Key management best practices
The following are some of the best practices that are applicable to key management.
Key usage refers to using the key for a cryptographic process. This should be limited to
using a single key for only one cryptographic process. This is to ensure that the security
provided by the key is not weakened.
When a specific key is authorized for use by legitimate entities for a period of time or if the
effect of a specific key for given system is only for a period of time, then the time span is
known as a the crypto period. The purpose of defining a crypto period is to limit a
successful cryptanalysis by a malicious entity.
Cryptanalysis is the science of analyzing and deciphering codes and
ciphers.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 123 ]
The following assurance requirements are a part of the key management process:
Integrity protection: This assures the source and format of the keying material by
verification
Domain parameter validity: This assures the parameters used by some public
key algorithms during the generation of key pairs and digital signatures and
during the generation of shared secrets that are subsequently used to derive
keying material
Public key validity: This assures that the public key is arithmetically
mathematically correct
Private key possession: This assures that the possession of a private key is
obtained before using the public key
The cryptographic algorithm and the key-size selection are two important key
management parameters that provide adequate protection to the system and data
throughout their expected lifetime.
Key states
Cryptographic keys go through different states from their generation to destruction. These
states are defined as key states. When a cryptographic key moves from one state to another,
it is known as key transition.
NIST SP800-57 defines the following six key states:
The pre-activation state: The key has been generated, but not yet authorized for
use
The active state: The key may be used to cryptographically protect information
The deactivated state: The crypto period of the key is expired, but the key still
needs to perform cryptographic operations
The destroyed state: The key is destroyed here
The compromised state: The key is released or determined by an unauthorized
entity
The destroyed compromised state: The key is destroyed after a compromise or
the compromise is found after the key is destroyed

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 124 ]
Key management phases
The key states or transitions can be grouped under four key management phases. They are
as follows:
The pre-operational phase: The keying material is not yet available for normal
cryptographic operations
The operational phase: The keying material is available for normal cryptographic
operations and is in use
The post-operational phase: The keying material is no longer in use, but access to
the material is possible
The destroyed phase: Keys are no longer available
Cryptanalytic attacks
Cryptanalytic attacks mean compromising keys by way of decipherment to find out the
keys. The goal of cryptanalysis is to decipher the private or secret key. The amount of
information provided to the analyst as well as the type of information provided determines
the type of attacks possible.
The methods of cryptanalytic attacks
The following six are the possible attack scenarios. Candidates are advised to understand
the key differences between the different types of attacks:
The cipher text only attack: This refers to the availability of the cipher text
(encrypted text) to the cryptanalyst. With large cipher text data, it maybe possible
to decipher the cipher text by analyzing the pattern.
The known-plain text attack: When a cryptanalyst obtains cipher text as well as
the corresponding plain text, then this type of attack is known as the known-
plaintext attack. In this scenario, even if the data is small, it is possible to
understand the algorithm.
The chosen-plain text attack: This refers to the availability of corresponding
cipher text to the block of plain text chosen by the analyst.
The adaptive-chosen-plain text attack: If the cryptanalyst can choose the samples
of plain text based on the results of previous encryptions in a dynamic passion,
then this type of cryptanalytic attack is known as an adaptive-chosen-plain text
attack.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 125 ]
The chosen-cipher text attack: This is a type of attack used to obtain the plain
text by choosing a sample of cipher text.
The adaptive-chosen-cipher text attack: This is similar to the chosen cipher text,
but the samples of cipher text are dynamically selected by the cryptanalyst; and
the selection can be based on the previous results as well.
Cryptographic standards
Cryptography standards are related to the following:
Encryption
Hashing
Digital signatures
Public key infrastructure
Wireless
Federal standards
We've covered different cryptographic standards pertaining to encryption, hashing, digital
signatures, and public key infrastructure in the previous sections. In this section, we'll cover
the wireless standards and the Federal standard FIPS-140 for cryptographic modules.
Wireless cryptographic standards
Wireless protocols and services are predominantly governed by IEEE 802.11 standards.
These standards are basically for Wireless Local Area Networking (WLAN) for computer
communications.
The following are some of the cryptographic standards that are used in WLAN:
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an algorithm that uses the stream cipher RC4
encryption standard for confidentiality protection and CRC-32 for integrity assurance. This
algorithm is now deprecated as it was breached easily.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 126 ]
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is a security protocol developed by the Wi-Fi alliance that
replaces WEP. This protocol implements majority of the advanced requirements in
IEEE802.11i standard released in 2004. WPA is backward compatible with WEP.
WPA2 is an advanced protocol certified by the Wi-Fi alliance. This protocol fulfills the
mandatory requirements of IEE 822.11i standard, and it uses the AES algorithm for
encryption.
IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards that govern wireless networking
transmission methods. IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, and 802.11g are
different standards based on the throughput or bandwidth and the
frequency band.
IEEE 802.11i is an amendment to the original 802.11 standards.
Wi-Fi implementations are based on IEEE standards, an international organization known
as, Wi-Fi alliance promotes Wi-Fi standards.
Wi-Fi alliance is a non-profit organization that supports IEEE wireless
standards. Here is the information about the Wi-Fi alliance as published
on their website.
The Wi-Fi Alliance is a global, non-profit industry association of more
than 300 member companies devoted to promoting the growth of Wireless
Local Area Networks (WLANs). With the aim of enhancing the user
experience for wireless portable, mobile, and home entertainment devices,
the Wi-Fi Alliance's testing and certification programs help ensure the
interoperability of WLAN products based on the IEEE 802.11 specification.
Bluetooth is a wireless protocol for short-range communications of fixed or portable
computers and mobile devices. It uses 2.4GHz short-range radio frequency bandwidth for
communication between mobile devices, computers, printers, GPS and more. Bluetooth
uses custom block ciphers for confidentiality and authentication.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 127 ]
The Federal Information Processing Standard
We'll cover one of the most important federal standards, titled Security Requirements for
Cryptographic Modules, FIPS-140 series, in the this section.
As per the published information, the Federal Information Processing
Standards Publication Series of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) is the official series of publications relating to
standards and guidelines, adopted and promulgated under the provisions
of Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act
of 1949, as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public Law
100-235. These mandates have given the Secretary of Commerce and NIST
important responsibilities for improving the utilization and management
of computer and related telecommunications systems in the Federal
Government. NIST, through its Computer Systems Laboratory, provides
leadership, technical guidance, and coordination of government efforts in
the development of standards and guidelines in these areas.
The core structure of FIPS140 recommends four security levels for cryptographic modules
that protect sensitive information in federal systems, such as computer and
telecommunication systems that include voice systems as well. These levels are qualitative
in increasing order-level 1 being the lowest and level 4 the highest.
The following are brief descriptions of the FIPS140 levels:
FIPS140 Security Level 1: This is a basic or the lowest level of security that
prescribes basic security requirements for a cryptographic module, such as using
at least one approved cryptographic algorithm. This level does not emphasize
physical security.
FIPS140 Security Level 2: Tamper evidence mechanisms is the requirement in
this level. This enhances the physical security of the device. Tamper-evident seals
or coatings should be used to physically protect the device or storage that
contains the cryptographic module. This level also emphasizes the
implementation of role-based authentication as a minimum requirement.
FIPS140 Security Level 3: The primary requirement is preventing an intruder
from gaining access to the cryptographic modules and the Critical Security
Parameters (CSP) contained within. This level prescribes high probability of
detection and response mechanisms for physical attacks. This level emphasizes
identity-based authentication.

Day 7 – Security Engineering - Cryptography
[ 128 ]
FIPS140 Security Level 4: This is the highest level and physical security
mechanisms provide a complete envelope of protection around the cryptographic
module with the intent of detecting and responding to all unauthorized attempts
at physical access. This level requires a two-factor authentication. This level also
requires the control of environmental conditions, such as preventing damage to
cryptographic modules due to temperature, heat, and voltage.
Summary
This chapter has covered foundational concepts in Cryptography. In a nutshell,
cryptography is an art and science to conceal information. Encryption methods are used to
ensure the confidentiality of information as well as authenticity verification. Additionally,
hashing methods are used to ensure the integrity of the information. Public key
cryptography and public key infrastructure provide methods to assure confidentiality,
integrity, source authentication, and non-repudiation during digital communications.
Cryptanalysis consists of methods used to validate the strength and security of
cryptographic algorithms and keys.
In the next two chapters, we will cover Communication and Network security, which forms

Getting an overview of application of cryptography in communication security
Understanding the security requirements in network components
Network architecture, protocols, and
technologies
Security in communication and networks is based on the architecture type, protocols, and
the technologies used. Secure network design forms the baseline for the network's resilience
against attacks. Generally, network architecture consists of layered independent 
communication channels. Security has to be understood and applied in each and every
layer for an overall communication and network protection. In a nutshell, networks are
architected like roads, and protocols are architected like cars. Each car can be different but
must follow constraints of the roads.
Layered architecture
Layered architecture is a technique that is used to design communication networking in the
form of layers. Each layer is independent and communicates with its immediate upper and
lower layers. This technique allows the isolation of network components without affecting
others in other layers.
Open System Interconnect (OSI) model
Open System Interconnect (OSI) is an International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
layered architecture standard that defines a framework for implementing protocols in seven
layers.
A protocol is a communication standard that defines rules pertaining to
syntax, semantics, and synchronization for communications.

[ 134 ]
The seven layers in the OSI model are represented as a top-down list in the following
illustration:
Layers 7, 6, 5, and 4 work at the host (computer) level and are sometimes called host layers,
whereas layers 3, 2, and 1 are related to transmission through the media and are called 
media layers:
Layer 7: This is the application layer that provides application services that are
required for application processes. Interaction between the user and the host
application is facilitated in this layer. All functionalities in this layer are oriented
toward applications.
Layer 6: This is the presentation layer that manages the way information or data
is encoded or represented. Hence, this layer transforms the data for applications.
Layer 5: This is the session layer, and the primary purpose of this layer is to
manage communications between two computers.
Layer 4: This is used to maintain the integrity and validity of the data that is 
being transported, and it is known as the transport layer.
Layer 3: This is called the network layer, and it ensures that the proper route is 
established for transporting the data.
Layer 2: This is the data link layer that ensures node-to-node validity of the data
that is being transmitted.
Layer 1: This deals with electrical and mechanical characteristics of the data and
is called the physical layer.

OSI mnemonics are used to remember the order of the seven layers. The following are a
couple of the most popular OSI mnemonics:

Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP)
Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is an Internet Protocol suite on
which most of the Internet and commercial networks run. There are two important
protocols in it, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) based on
which this suite is named.
The original TCP/IP reference model consists of four layers that are purely related to
Internet communications. These four layers are the application layer, the transport layer, the
network/internet layer, and the data link layer.
The following diagram illustrates the four-layered TCP/IP model:
OSI layers and security
The upcoming section covers some important protocols in OSI layers. Application layer
protocols, presentation layer protocols, session layer protocols, and their security are
covered in this chapter. The remaining layers are covered in the next chapter.
This section also gives an overview of security weaknesses in such layer/protocols as well as
security measures to mitigate such weaknesses.

Day 8 – Communication and Network Security - Network Security
[ 136 ]
Application layer protocols and security
In the application layer, some of the important protocols are Domain Name System (DNS), 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), TELNET, Post Office Protocol (POP3), Internet Message
Access Protocol (IMAP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP).
Domain Name System (DNS)
DNS works at the application layer. DNS translates domain names into IP addresses. DNS's
main purpose is to resolve host names to matching numeric IP addresses, as well
as maintaining resource records for e-mail and other services where end-to-end delivery
needs to be assured.
Threats, attacks, and countermeasures
A common threat to DNS is spoofing. It is a terminology used in computer security to refer
to the successful masquerading of one entity as another. An entity can be a person or
program. Masquerading refers to disguising, impersonating, or masking.
Many spoofing attacks exist. Some of them are as follows:
Man-in-the-Middle-Attack: This refers to spoofing the systems in order to listen
to the network traffic between two computers and capture data packets. In other
words, attackers insert themselves in the communication path between hosts.
URL spoofing: Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the method by which a web
page or website is identified by the browser. This is also called the website or
webpage address. In URL spoofing, a web browser is led to believe that it is
accessing the requested legitimate website. However, the browser accesses the
attacker-directed website due to spoofing.
Phishing: This is a spoofing technique used by fraudsters to capture sensitive
information, such as user name, password, credit card details, and more. In
Phishing, URL spoofing is used to redirect a user to the attacker-constructed
illegitimate website, and e-mail spoofing is used to lure the user to open an
illegitimate spoofed URL.
E-mail spoofing: This is a technique used to masquerade as a legitimate source
address (such as a bank) of the e-mail. Due to this, the user is led to believe that
the e-mail is from a trusted source.

Day 8 – Communication and Network Security - Network Security
[ 137 ]
SMS spoofing: This is similar to e-mail spoofing, but in this case, the mobile 
number of the source is masqueraded by a malicious entity to send a spoofed text
message.
DNS cache poisoning: This relates to altering the DNS cache data with
illegitimate entries. A cache data is the information stored in the host memory.
Since DNS resolves IP addresses, a poisoned data would redirect a legitimate
address request to an illegitimate address.
Countermeasures provide methods to address security threats. A countermeasure can be a
technical solution or a kind of best practice. Some of the countermeasures for the common
security threats and attacks include.
Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC): They are a set of extensions that
provide origin authentication, data integrity, and the authenticated denial of existence. The
primary purpose of DNSSEC is to prevent Zone Enumeration.
Zone enumeration: The practice of discovering the full content of a zone
via successive queries. Zone enumeration was non-trivial prior to the
introduction of DNSSEC.
Source: RFC5155 – DNS Security (DNSSEC) Hashed Authenticated Denial
of Existence
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
In an Internet Protocol (IP) network, client devices obtain necessary network parameters
from a centralized server(s) using this protocol. One of the primary parameters obtained is
the IP address itself. DHCP helps in reducing manual configurations.
DHCP is primarily used for assigning IP addresses to servers and clients. This protocol also
uses Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) and Network Address Translation (NAT) for assigning
IP addresses to on-demand hosts such as dialup and broadband.
The IP address allocation is either automatic or manual depending upon the level of user
intervention required. The address allocation method used is called as Discover, Offer,
Request, Acknowledge (DORA).
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
This protocol has similar threats as DNS, such as cache poisoning and masquerading.

Day 8 – Communication and Network Security - Network Security
[ 138 ]
Vulnerabilities are generally in the form of misconfigured DHCP and DNS server
(misconfiguration), and lack of session authentication and encryption.
Few unique attacks exist in the protocol such as birthday attack and DNS forgery:
Birthday attack: This is a cryptographic attack to guess a random input data. It
works on a mathematical probability theory that there is a chance that more than
50% of randomly chosen people in a group of 23 may have the same birthday.
The probability increases to 99% when the group is more than 57.
DHCP exhaustion due to DOS attacks or Man-in-the-Middle-Attacks to access alt
gateways.
DNS Forgery: This is a type of DNS cache poisoning. Countermeasures for the
preceding security threats, vulnerabilities, or attacks include:
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): These are 
cryptographic protocols. The purpose of these protocols is to provide a secure
communication by way of encryption.
Secure Shell (SSH): This is a network protocol that facilitates secure encrypted
communications between two computers.
Digital Signature: This is used in a public key cryptography where the message
is digitally signed using the sender's private key. The purpose here is to
authenticate the sender.
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
The Internet web pages on the World Wide Web (WWW) are coded in the Hyper Text
Markup Language (HTML). HTTP is a communication protocol that enables retrieval and
transfer of hypertext pages. HTTP uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for
connections.
HTTP works in the application layer of the TCP/IP model, and HTTP is the default protocol
for serving web pages. Hence, the primary delivery mechanisms for web pages use this
protocol.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Some of the common threats for HTTP include spoofing, unauthorized disclosure, and path
traversal; and vulnerabilities include weaknesses in coding header information and weak
encoding of get methods.

Day 8 – Communication and Network Security - Network Security
[ 139 ]
Path traversal: This relates to unauthorized access to the web server
directory structure. Generally, the server should return an HTTP web
page; instead of this, the directory structure is revealed.
DNS spoofing attacks exist for HTTP as well. Besides attacks such as Denial-of-Service
(DoS) and Eavesdropping are also popular attacks to HTTP.
Eavesdropping is a type of attack, and it is used to listen to the
communication between the client and the server in a surreptitious
manner.
Countermeasures include strict validation techniques and using HTTPS protocol during
sensitive information transmission. For example, Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (S-
HTTP or HTTPS) uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for encrypting the session between the
server and the client.
FTP and TELNET
FTP is a network protocol and is used to transfer files from one computer to another over a
TCP/IP network. The main application of FTP is to transfer files between computers. FTP is
not suitable for executing programs in the target servers.
TELNET stands for TELecommunication NETwork and is used to access remote computer
resources using a communication shell. The purpose of TELNET is to log into the remote
server and perform maintenance works in the system from a remote location.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Some of the common threats for FTP and TELNET include unauthorized data capture
including the password capture. Vulnerabilities that aid such a threat include sending 
passwords in clear text as well as the clear text transmission of sensitive information.
Similar to HTTP, eavesdropping attacks are possible on FTP and TELNET. Sniffing is
another common attack on these protocols.
Sniffing is used to capture the data that flows through the network and
analyze it in order to obtaining sensitive information.

Day 8 – Communication and Network Security - Network Security
[ 140 ]
Adapting to Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) and using Secure Shell (SSH) for sensitive
information transmission will act as a countermeasure to such attacks. Hence,
countermeasures are using SFTP instead of FTP and using SSH instead of TELNET.
Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) uses SSH for transmitting the files
and session data. This ensures that the session is encrypted end to end.
Post Office Protocol (POP3) and Internet Message
Access Protocol (IMAP)
POP3 and IMAP protocols are used to retrieve e-mails from the e-mail servers over the
TCP/IP connection.
The POP3 protocol is used by e-mail clients to download e-mail messages from the remote
e-mail server. Unless configured, this protocol is designed to delete the e-mails after
download.
IMAP is used to view the e-mail messages in the server. Unless offline mode is enabled, the
messages are not stored in the local machine, and the messages in the server are not deleted.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Some of the common threats to POP3 and IMAP include the non-delivery of e-mails and
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE), which is popularly known as SPAM. Vulnerabilities
are generally related to the misconfiguration of the e-mail servers.
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail (UCE) is also known as spam. Due to
vulnerabilities in Mail Transport Agents (MTA), a commercial mail that is
spam is relayed to many e-mail accounts.
Attacks include e-mail relay and spoofing. Countermeasures are implementing strong
authentication such as two-factor solutions as well as source-verification methods.

Day 8 – Communication and Network Security - Network Security
[ 141 ]
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
As the name implies, this network protocol is used for managing administrative tasks in the
network. Managing the uptime of the network, network query, and measuring throughput
are some of the primary applications of this protocol/service
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Some of the common threats to SNMP include unauthorized data capture and the
disclosure of sensitive information such as community strings. Vulnerabilities are related to
the misconfiguration of SNMP servers and using default values for community strings and
other data.
Common attacks to SNMP include packet sniffing, brute force and dictionary attacks, as
well as IP spoofing.
Brute force and dictionary attacks use a combination of words in
dictionary and numeric and special characters to crack the encrypted
password hashes.
Enforcing stronger passwords and a secure configuration of servers are some of the
countermeasures for such attacks. Using SNMP3 is also a countermeasure as this version
addresses many of the security issues.
Presentation layer protocols and security
In the presentation layer, some of the important protocols are Multi-Purpose Mail
Extensions (MIME), Secure Shell (SSH), and Transport Layer Security (TLS).
In the TCP/IP reference model, the preceding protocols are grouped under
the application layer. TCP/IP combines the application, presentation and
session layers into a single layer as the application layer.
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL)
TLS is used to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data while being transmitted. SSL
is a predecessor of TLS. This protocol is used in encrypting sessions and transported data.
Both these protocols are cryptographic protocols.

Day 8 – Communication and Network Security - Network Security
[ 142 ]
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
The most common threat for TLS and SSL is unauthorized information access, and software
vulnerabilities help such threats to materialize.
A common attack is the replay attack. It uses a session or data capture to replay the data to
the server such that a software vulnerability can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to
the system or data.
Validating the session data and source authenticity verification are some of the common
countermeasures against Replay attacks.
Session layer protocols and security
Session layer sockets are primarily used for a session establishment of protocols, such as
TCP. This layer is responsible for a session between applications. Some of the functions
pertaining to sessions include the opening/closing of connections, maintaining the sessions,
and managing request/response mechanisms between end-user applications.
Some of the important protocols in this layer are Network Basic Input Output System
(NetBIOS), Network File System (NFS), and Server Message Block (SMB).
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
The most common threats for the session layer are hijacking and unauthorized information
disclosure.
There are many vulnerabilities that are present in the session layer protocols. Weaknesses in
session management and weak access mechanisms are common vulnerabilities of the same.
A common attack is session hijacking. Specifically, when NetBIOS is used over TCP/IP,
attacks on the vulnerabilities will allow the exposure of a network or file share information
to the attackers.
SMB signing and limiting NetBIOS to intranet are some of the countermeasures for the
attacks.

Day 9 – Communication and
Network Security -
Communication Security
This chapter covers foundational concepts in the communication security domain. Security
in communication channels—security requirements in voice, data, multimedia, and remote
access—and virtualized networks are covered. An overview of attacks on communication
networks, prevention and mitigation of such attacks, including widely used security
controls, is also covered.
An overview of communication security
Communication and the network security domain deals with the security of voice and data
communications through local area, Wide area, and Remote access networking. Candidates
are expected to have knowledge in the areas of secure communications: securing networks,
threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures to the communication networks and
protocols that are used in remote access.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 146 ]
Observe the following illustration. We have already covered the application, presentation,
and session layer in the OSI model. In this chapter, we will cover transport, networks, data
links, and the physical layers of the OSI model:
Transport layer protocols and security
Transport layer does two things. One is to package the data given out by applications to a
format that is suitable for transport over the network, and the other thing is to unpack the
data received from the network and then format it suitable for applications.
In the transport layer, some of the important protocols are Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP), User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), 
Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), and Fiber Channel Protocol (FCP).
The process of packaging the data packets received from the applications is called 
encapsulation, and the output of such a process is called a datagram.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 147 ]
Similarly, the process of unpacking the datagram received from the network is called 
decapstulation.
When moving from layer 7 down to 4, when the layer 4 header is placed on the data, it
becomes a datagram. When the datagram is encapsulated with a layer 3 header, it becomes a
packet; the packet encapsulated becomes a frame, and it is put on the wire as bits.
The upcoming section describes some of the important protocols in this layer along with the
security concerns and their countermeasures.
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
This is a core Internet protocol that provides reliable delivery mechanisms over the Internet.
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. A protocol that guarantees delivery of datagram
(packets) to the destination application by way of a suitable mechanism (for example, a
three-way handshake of SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK in TCP) is called a connection-oriented
protocol. The reliability of the datagram delivery of such a protocol is high due to the
acknowledgment part of the receiver.
This protocol has two primary functions. The primary function of TCP is the transmission
of datagrams between applications; and the secondary one is in terms of the controls that
are necessary to ensure reliable transmission.
Applications where the delivery needs to be assured, such as e-mail, World Wide Web
(WWW), file transfer and more, use TCP for transmission
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
One of the common threats to TCP is a service disruption. A common vulnerability is half-
open connections exhausting the server resources.
Denial of service attacks, such as TCP SYN attacks as well as connection hijacking as IP
Spoofing attacks, are also possible.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 148 ]
A
1 half-open connection is a vulnerability in the TCP implementation. As discussed earlier,
TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish or terminate connections. Refer to the
following illustration:
In a three-way handshake, first the client (workstation) sends a request to the server (for
example, www.some_website.com). This is called an SYN request. The server
acknowledges the request by sending a SYN-ACK, and in the process, it creates a buffer for
this connection. The client does a final acknowledgement by ACK. TCP requires this setup,
since the protocol needs to ensure the reliability of the packet delivery.
If the client does not send the final ACK, then the connection is called half open. Since the
server has created a buffer for this connection, a certain amount of memory or server
resource is consumed. If thousands of such half-open connections are created maliciously,
then the server resources may be completely consumed, resulting in Denial-of-Service to
legitimate requests.
TCP SYN attacks technically establish thousands of half-open connections to consume the
server resources. There are two actions that an attacker might perform. One is that the
attacker or malicious software will send thousands of SYN attacks to the server and
withheld ACK. This is called SYN flooding. Depending on the capacity of the network
bandwidth and server resources, in a span of time, the entire resources will be consumed,
resulting in denial-of-service. If the source IP were blocked by some means, then the
attacker or the malicious software would try to spoof the source IP addresses to continue
the attack. This is called SYN spoofing.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 149 ]
SYN attacks, such as SYN flooding and SYN spoofing, can be controlled using SYN cookies
with cryptographic hash functions. In this method, the server does not create the connection
at the SYN-ACK stage. The server creates a cookie with the computed hash of the source IP
address, source port, destination IP, destination port, and some random values based on an
algorithm. Then, the source sends it as SYN-ACK. When the server receives an ACK, it
checks the details and creates the connection.
A cookie is a piece of information that is usually in the form of a text file
sent by the server to the client. Cookies are generally stored in client
computers and are used for purposes such as authentication, session
tracking, and management.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
UDP is a connectionless protocol and is similar to TCP. However, UDP does not provide the
delivery guarantee of data packets. A protocol that does not guarantee the delivery of
datagram (packets) to the destination is called a connectionless protocol. In other words,
the final acknowledgment is not mandatory in UDP.
UDP uses one-way communication. The speed of the delivery of the datagram by UDP is
high. UDP is predominantly used where a loss of intermittent packets is acceptable, such as
with video or audio streaming.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Service disruptions are common threats, and validation weaknesses facilitate such threats.
UDP flood attacks cause service disruptions; and controlling the UDP packet size acts as a 
countermeasure to such attacks.
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
ICMP is used to discover service availability in network devices or servers. ICMP expects
response messages from devices or systems to confirm the service availability.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Service disruptions are common threats. Validation weaknesses facilitate such threats.
ICMP flood attacks, such as the Ping of Death, causes these service disruptions; and
controlling ICMP packet size acts as a countermeasure to such attacks.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 150 ]
Pinging is a process of sending an Internet Control Message Protocol
(ICMP) ECHO_REQUEST message to servers or hosts to check whether they
are up and running. In this process, a server or host on a network
responds to a ping request, and such a response is called an echo.
Ping of death refers to sending large numbers of ICMP packets to the
server to crash the system.
Other protocols in the transport layer
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP): This is a connection-oriented
protocol similar to TCP, but it provides facilities such as multi-streaming and
multi-homing for better performance and redundancy. It is used in UNIX-like
operating systems.
Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP): As the name implies, this is a
transport layer protocol that is used for congestion control. Applications here
include Internet telephony and video/audio streaming over the network.
Fiber Channel Protocol (FCP): This protocol is used in high-speed networking.
One of the prominent applications is Storage Area Network (SAN).
Storage Area Network (SAN) is a network architecture used to attach
remote storage devices, such as tape drives, disk arrays, and more, to the
local server. This facilitates using storage devices as if they are local
devices.
The network layer protocols and security
The Network or Internet layer in the TCP/IP model is used for internetworking. This layer
has a group of methods, functions, and protocols to facilitate communication between 
different networks. In this layer, communication between networks is achieved through
mechanisms called gateways.
In the Network layer, some of the important protocols are Internet
Protocol (IP), Internet Communication Message Protocol (ICMP), Internet
Group Management Protocol (IGMP), and Internet Protocol security
(IPsec).

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 151 ]
Protocols in this layer carry out the following functions:
Passing the outgoing packets through gateways to the next layer (the data link
layer)
Passing the incoming packets to the transport layer
Providing error detection and diagnostics for incoming and outgoing packets
Internet Protocol (IP)
IP is a connectionless protocol and is used in packet-switched networks such as the Internet.
The primary function of this protocol is to send data from one computer to another. IP
works in the network layer of OSI and the Internet layer of the TCP/IP model.
The primary function of this layer is to send data packets across the network to the
destination computer. The computers, in such networks, are called hosts. IP tries the best
effort method of delivery for packets, but it does not guarantee it. Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) manages the reliability of the transmission.
Two versions are being used in the Internet. One is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and
the other is Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Some of the common threats in this layer are the non-delivery of packets or some corrupted
data. Vulnerabilities that these threats could exploit include lack of validation mechanisms
and a lack of sequencing procedures and processes.
The most common attack on this layer is data theft. Information or data packets can be
captured during transmission and decoded. Unauthorized access and privilege escalation
entry points are possible in this layer.
Countermeasures is by way of using appropriate security features in Transmission Control 
Protocol, Address Resolution Protocols (ARP), IPv6 security controls, and most importantly
Internet Protocol Security (IPSec).
Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is a widely deployed protocol on the
Internet. As the name implies, it is the fourth iteration of the protocol. It
uses 32 bits for the length of the address and is limited to 2
32 addresses.
The number of publicly available IPv4 addresses is more or less
consumed, and the Internet is moving toward IPv6.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 152 ]
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is designed as a successor to the IPv4
address space. This protocol uses 128 bits for the IP addresses and has an
address space of 2
128 IP addresses.
IPsec protocols
IPsec is a suit of protocols that is created to secure Internet Protocols (IP). They provide
authentication, integrity, and encryption functions. Compared to the upper-layer security
protocols, such as SSL or TLS, IPsec is an independent application, and it can be used to
protect the application and transport layer protocols as a whole.
IPsec uses the following three protocols for various security functions:
Internet Key Exchange (IKE): This is used to negotiate protocols, algorithms, and
generate keys for encryption and authentication
Authentication Header (AH): This is used to provide the data origin
authentication to datagrams and integrity assurance
Encapsulation Security Payload (ESP): This is used to support encryption-only
and authentication-only configurations
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Threats such as spoofing and unauthorized connections materialize due to weak
authentication and a lack of connection checks in this protocol. Such vulnerabilities are
exploited through Man-in-the-Middle attacks. These attacks can be countered by proper 
IPsec policies and by deploying additional IPsec connection checks. Using Virtual Private
Networks (VPN) enables a secure communication in this layer.
Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a virtual network that is set up to use a
larger public network, such as the Internet. VPN uses a concept called
tunneling to route the data, and IPsec protocols are used for an end-to-end
encryption.
A tunnel in a computer network, such as VPN, is a secure path, or route
for the datagram to pass through an insecure or un-trusted network.
Protocols such as IPsec, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and
Layer2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) are some of the examples of tunneling
protocols.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 153 ]
Data link layer protocols and security
The methods, protocols, and specifications that are used to link hosts or nodes in a network
are grouped as a data link layer. The link layer operates close to the physical layer
components.
In data link layer some of the important protocols are Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP),
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), and Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP). Fiber
channel and Ethernet also work in this layer.
Link layer protocols
The following protocols operate on the link layer:
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): This is used to resolve the hardware
address (Layer 2, MAC address, 48 bits, 12 HEX characters) for a given IP address
Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP): This is used to obtain IP 
addresses based on the hardware address
Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP): This is used to find neighbor nodes in an
IPv6 network
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
This protocol is a standard method of finding hardware addresses from network layer
addresses, such as Internet Protocol (IP). The primary application of ARP is to translate IP
addresses to ethernet Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.
The primary purpose of this protocol is to resolve hardware addresses such that
communication can be established between two computers within the same network or
over the Internet. This is necessary because as you go down the OSI model stack from 7 -> 1,
you know that IP address 1 is trying to send to IP address 2. But to encapsulate this at layer
2, you need to know the MAC address of IP address 2.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Some of the common threats in this layer include sniffing and spoofing. Unsolicited ARP
reply is a common vulnerability. Attacks such as ARP poisoning, ARP poison routing, and
Denial-f-Service (DOS) are prevalent in this layer. Countermeasures include MAC to IP-
mapping processes.

Day 9 – Communication and Network Security - Communication Security
[ 154 ]
ARP poisoning refers to overwriting the existing entry in the ARP table
with a malicious address. The primary purpose of this is to perform a
MIIM attack.
Media Access Control (MAC) is a unique hardware address that is
assigned to Network Interface Cards (NIC) or network adapters.
Border Gateway Protocol
This is a type of routing protocol that is being used on the Internet. The primary purpose is to
decentralize the Internet routing. Internet Service Providers (ISP) predominantly use this
protocol for routing the data and information between them.
Routing protocols exist so that routers can tell each other about the routes they own
(otherwise, having to manually insert routes in ever router for EVERY network, that is static
routes). Interior routing protocols called RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and ISIS are used inside the
organizations. They are fast but don't scale to the Internet size. Exterior protocols, such as
BGP, are used to tell backbone routers where all the routes on the Internet are. BGP is very
slow, but it can obviously scale to the entire Internet.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Some of the common threats include the misuse of network resources, network congestion, 
packet delays, and the violation of local routing policies. Another issue with BGP is that it
advertises networks that are not its own.
Vulnerabilities that help these threats to materialize include misconfigured routers and
software flaws. Such vulnerabilities are exploited through spoofing and message-injection
attacks.
Message or data injection refers to injecting arbitrary code into the
system. This is to compromise input validation techniques.
Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is often referred to as layer 2.5 protocol, as it lies
between layer 2 and 3 of the OSI model. It provides more reliability and support for T1,
ATM, the Frame relay, and DSL.

Ethernet
This is a family of frame-based networking technologies that is used in Local Area Network
(LAN). Ethernet operates in the Link layer as well as the Physical layer of the TCP/IP model.
Ethernet initially used coaxial cables for networking. However, the present-day
technologies include switches and twisted pair cabling.
Present-day switches can provide layer 3 functions such as support for routing protocols as
well.
Ethernet technologies have predominantly replaced other LAN standards such as token
ring, FDDI, and ARC net.
Threats, vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures
Threats in this layer include spoofing, while a common vulnerability is the reuse of frame
buffers. Attacks such as eavesdropping and Denial of Service (DOS) are possible due to the
vulnerabilities. Segmentation, filtering, and encryption methods act as countermeasures to
such attacks.
The physical layer and security
The physical layer is the lowest layer in the OSI stack. It is concerned with the transmission
of bits from one computer to another. The components in the physical layer are concerned
with a physical connection between the computers. The transmission and receiving of
signals in bit stream is the primary function.
Some of the important components in this layer include RS-232, RJ45, and 802.11a/b/g/n,
Universal Serial Bus (USB), and Bluetooth.
Security in the physical layer is predominantly used to deal with physical disconnections,
damage of the physical components, and theft.

[ 156 ]
Security in communication channels
Communication channels facilitate the transmission of information across users or devices.
The increasing adoption of mobile communication systems with smart technologies have
blurred the isolation of communication and computing devices to Unified Information and
Communication systems. This rapid progression and unification of communication and
computing technologies have also opened multiple vectors for attacks, numerous threats,
and vulnerabilities. Hence, it is essential for a security professional to understand and apply
suitable security controls to address modern-day threats and vulnerabilities in
communication technologies, such as voice, multimedia, remote access, data
communications, mobile communications, and virtualized networks.
Security requirements in voice, multimedia,
remote access, data communications, and
virtualized networks
In Information and Communication Technology (ICT), which is a convergence of data
communication and voice communication technologies, security requirements focus
primarily on data integrity, service availability, and identity assurance. The traditional
circuit-based telephony networks are being rapidly replaced with packet-switching-based
data networks. Thus, end-to-end protection for devices, communication channels, and
operator networks from unauthorized access and compromise from external networks
become a priority requirement while designing and implementing communication
networks.
The following are some of the common security requirements in ICT systems:
Prevention of unauthorized access and modification of the data at devices, data in
transmission, and the data being processed
Service assurance such as availability of communication channels and devices,
including the operator side equipment
Assurance from theft or the leakage of service such as the diversion of data or
calls and operator and business side revenue theft

focus many cyber-based attacks on communication. Some common attacks can be broadly
classified under the following:
Snooping/eavesdropping
Theft of services
Denial-of-Service (DoS)
Preventing or mitigating communication
network attacks

Summary
In this chapter, we covered some of the concepts in telecommunications and the network
security domain.
Security requirements in voice, data, multimedia, remote access, and virtual networks are
based on service availability, data confidentiality, and theft/leakage. Security requirements
are addressed through prevention and mitigation strategies and communication controls.

Cryptography is an art as well as a science that involves the process of
transforming a plain text into a scrambled text and vice versa.
The process of converting plain text into scrambled or unintelligible (cipher) text
is called encryption.
The process of converting scrambled or unintelligible (cipher) text into plain text
is called decryption.
An algorithm in cryptography is a series of well-defined steps that provide the
procedure for encryption/decryption.
A cryptographic method is a way of doing encryption and decryption in a
systematic way.
Cryptography is based on algorithms and the keys that operate on them.
If only one key is used, then it is called symmetric key encryption; if two keys are
used, then it is called asymmetric key encryption; and if no key is used, then it is
called hashing.
When the key stream algorithm operates on a single bit, byte, or computer word
such that the information is changed constantly, then it is called stream cipher.
If the algorithm operates on a block of text (as opposed to a single bit or byte),
then it is known as block cipher.
The Rivest Cipher (RC4) algorithm uses about 40 to 256 bits, and the key sizes
are different. RC4 is a stream cipher.

192, or 256 bit keys.
When a ciphertext block is formed by the application of a secret key to encrypt
the plaintext block, this is called Electronic Code Book (ECB).
When a plaintext is exclusively-ORed(XORed) with the previous block of
ciphertext, then the mode is called Cipher Block Chaining (CBC).
Cipher FeedBack (CFB) is a mode that allows the encrypted data units to be
smaller than the block unit size.
Output FeedBack(OFB) uses an internal feedback mechanism such that the same
plaintext block cannot create the same ciphertext block.

hypertext pages. HTTP uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for
connections.
Common threats for HTTP include Spoofing, Unauthorized disclosure, and Path
traversal.
Transport layer in the TCP/IP model does two things. One job is to package the
data given out by applications to a format that is suitable for transport over the
network, and the other one is to unpack the data received from the network to
the format suitable for applications.
The process of packaging the data packets received from the applications is called
encapsulation, and the output of such a process is called a datagram.
Similarly, the process of unpacking the datagram received from the network is
called abstraction.

An overview of identity and access
management
An asset, such as data, is accessed through systems and applications. Similarly, access to
facilities such as data centers and operational areas are facilitated through access control
mechanisms. Hence, physical or logical access to assets needs to establish the identity of the
person or process scripts before determining the access permission.
Observe the following illustration. Users need access to data or physical facilities. Similarly,
scripts or programs need access to data for processing and execution. Essentially, one type
of asset needs access to another type of asset. The overall process of facilitating and
managing identities of such assets, and controlling access while ensuring information
security, is termed as Identity and Access Management (IAM):
In this module you will understand the following:
Physical and logical access to assets and security controls
Identification and authentication
Managing people to device interactions
Integrating identity as a service and third-party identity services

Day 11 – Identity and Access Management - Identity Management
[ 178 ]
Physical and logical access to assets
In information technology, physical access includes access to physical assets such as
facilities, operational areas, and data centers. Logical access includes access to computing
assets such as operating systems, application programs, and networks that include the
Internet/intranet, information, and data.
Access to physical or logical assets is attempted by entities such as people, programs, or
scripts. From the perspective of access, every entity that is trying to access physical or
logical assets through any method is considered to be anonymous before some sort of
method is used to determine the identity of the entity, and subsequently the access
permission. The information security domain that deals with such activities is called 
identity and access management—in short, IAM.
The IAM domain can be further subdivided into two interrelated management activities:
identity management and access management. Generally, they are called layers in this
domain. There are distinctive principles and practices that govern processes in these layers.
The layers are known as identity layers and access layers.
This chapter covers principles and practices in the identity layer, or in other words, it covers
identity management principles and practices. In the next chapter, we will cover access
management principles and practices that pertain to access layers.
Identity management principles and
implementation
Identity and access management consists of four distinctive principles and practices. They
are Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability. Sometimes, the last
three are together referred to as access control. In centralized access control systems, such as
radius and TACACS, they are identified as the Triple A of access control based on the
starting letter of each practice.
Observe the following illustration. The core principles and practices in identity and access
domains are layered into three groups. The first layer is called the Identity layer and
consists of identification principles and practices. The subsequent layer is called the access
layer and consists of authentication and authorization principles and practices. The third
and the last layer consists of accountability principles and practices such as auditing, audit
trail, and monitoring.

Day 11 – Identity and Access Management - Identity Management
[ 179 ]
Accountability is common and applicable to identity as well as the access layer:
The identity layer consists of distinctive principles and practices termed as identity
management. Consider the following example. John Edwards requires multiple identities in
an organization. While his core identity, in other words his principle identity, is John
Edwards, he needs access to other systems such as a directory system, a database, and web
applications.
Observe the following illustration:
John has multiple identities.
Each identity may have one or more credentials associated with it. For example, a
combination of passwords and a digital certificate.
Hence, managing identities requires few processes in the identity management domain.
All the activities are to be performed in accordance with corporate security policies, such
that identity is not misused to commit fraud or unauthorized access to systems.
In the preceding illustration, a single primary identity (John Edwards) spans to multiple
identities in different systems; and the requirement of each identity for access to
applications is also different. For example, an active directory account may be used for a
domain logon, while Unix system access is through a specific terminal.

Day 11 – Identity and Access Management - Identity Management
[ 180 ]
Hence, identity management includes some or all of the following:
Enrollment of user identifiers
Provisioning of user identities to different systems
Whenever there is a change in user information, updating all or some of the
associated accounts
If the user no longer needs access, retire, and then deprovisioning accounts
Identity as a service
The traditional methods of software implementation and access from a local installation at
standalone servers are slowly and steadily migrating to centralized cloud-based service
models. Furthermore, application hosting and access from cloud-based models are available
as subscription services. When software is delivered as a service through the Internet cloud,
then it is generically termed as Software as a Service (SaaS).
Some of the popular cloud-based services include Google cloud, which
provides Platform as a Service. Amazon AWS provides PaaS and
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Salesforce provides SaaS.
Similarly, identity and access management applications and associated services are
delivered through subscription-based cloud models. Such services are termed as Identity as
a Service (IDaaS). While such services provide flexibility and cost effectiveness, there are
security concerns due to the open nature of the Internet.
Security concerns
The following are some of the security concerns pertaining to Software or Identity as a
Service:
Due to the open nature of the Internet, cloud-based identity services are subject to
higher scrutiny in regard to security. One important concern is identity theft.
During the login process to the cloud application, it may be possible that the
communication can be intercepted (eavesdropping) and the credential details can
be captured.
The security of data at rest, such as the credentials stored in the database.
Systems can be compromised and the credentials may be captured from the
databases.

Day 11 – Identity and Access Management - Identity Management
[ 181 ]
When using software as a service, one important security concern is privacy. The
amount of personal information that the cloud software application can access
from the local computer is a concern.
The compromise of passwords using brute force or other password attacks on the
identity systems.
Cookies are generally used by identity services to store session information. Some
systems are susceptible to cookie replay attacks. In such a scenario, an attacker
may be able to gain access to the system without knowing the credentials.
Cookies are temporary files that may contain the user logon session
information and other data necessary for personalization purposes. They
may be stored in the user's browser disk or on the hard disk. A cookie may
not contain a password.
Data may be tampered during the communication, which would compromise the
integrity of the identity data during the communication.
Identity services may be unavailable due to denial-of-service (DoS) type of
attacks, thereby affecting access and compromising the availability requirements.
The spoofing of identities and forgery or cloning attacks.
Phishing attacks on the users to gain identity information.
Security concerns and attacks listed previously are covered in Chapters
8, Day 8 – Communication and Network Security – Network Security, and
Chapter 9, Day 9 – Communication and Network Security – Communication
security.
Security solutions for many of the security concerns pertaining to Identity as a Service
(IDaaS) are based on strong authentications, such as multifactor authentication;
cryptographic methods, such as encryption; and robust monitoring.
Cryptographic controls are covered in Chapter 7, Day 7 – Security
Engineering – Cryptography and Physical security.

Day 11 – Identity and Access Management - Identity Management
[ 182 ]
Third-party identity services
Identity as a service is predominantly provided by third-party service providers. It may
include all the processes, such as identification, authentication, authorization, and
accountability, or some of them. Similarly, such services may include activities such as
enrollment, provisioning, and deprovisioning.
Some of the identity services that may be offered by third-party service providers include
the following:
Single Sign-on services: When a user needs to access many different resources
that have similar authentication requirements and varying authorization polices,
then Single Sign-On (SSO) services provide seamless access to such additional
resources, without the user needing to provide credentials at each of the resource
access. For example, assume that a user is first authenticated in a website called
abc.com, and then he traverses to another website called xyz.com. Since
xyz.com also requires user authentication, the site may ask for user credentials
again. With SSO, it is possible to trust the earlier authentication at abc.com and
check only authorization policies to allow the user to access xyz.com resources
without asking for the credentials again.
Federated identity provider services: A federation is based on standards and
works on the identity layer. In a federation, there are two entities. One is called
(Asserting Party (AP) or Identity Provider (IdP). The other one is Relying Party
(RP) or Service Provider (SP). A user tries to access service-provider website
resources, then the service provider requests the identity provider to assert about
the identity of the user. The identity provider authenticates the user and asserts
about the identity to the service provider. A federation provides a centralized
identity service for many consuming service provider websites.
Password management services: Password management services provide a
centralized password vault for safe storage and credential transmission facilities
for users.
User provisioning services: Provisioning of user identity is required for access.
User-provisioning services provide automatic or dynamic provisioning
capabilities of user accounts to different systems, based on the access
requirements.
Access certification services: Third-party access certification services provide
digital identity information, such as digital certificates during electronic
transactions.

In this module, you will understand the following:
Access control concepts, methodologies, and techniques
Authorization mechanisms
The identity and provisioning lifecycle
Preventing or mitigating access control attacks
Access management concepts,
methodologies, and techniques
The access management layer consist of access control mechanisms, such as authentication
and authorization. This layer also consists of accountability mechanisms such as logging
and monitoring activities.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 188 ]
Basic concepts
One of the primary concepts in access control is that of subject and object.
A subject maybe a person, process, or technology component that either seeks access or
controls the access. A physical entry to a data center and login to a system are examples of
access. Hence, an employee trying to access their business e-mail account is a subject;
similarly, the system that verifies the credentials, such as the user name and password, is
also termed as subject.
An object can be a file, data, a physical equipment, or premises that needs controlled access.
For example, the e-mails stored in the mailbox are an object that a subject is trying to access
is data.
Controlling access to the object by a subject is the core requirement of an access control
process and its associated mechanisms. In a nutshell, a subject either seeks or controls
access to an object.
An access control mechanism can be classified broadly into the following two types:
If access to an object is controlled based on certain contextual parameters such as
location, time, sequence of responses, access history, and more, then it is known
as context-dependent access control. In this type, the value of the asset being
accessed is not a primary consideration. The following are the examples of such
an access control mechanism:
Providing username/password combination followed by a
challenge/response mechanism such as CAPTCHA
Filtering access based on a MAC address in wireless connections
Firewall filtering the data based on packet analysis
Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and
Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is a challenge-response test used to ensure
that the input to an access control system is supplied by humans and not
machines. This mechanism is predominantly used by websites to prevent
Web roBots (WebBots) from accessing the controlled section of the website
by brute force methods.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 189 ]
Here is an example of CAPTCHA:
If access is provided based on the attributes or content of an object, then it is
called content-dependent access control. In this type, the value and attributes of
the content that is being accessed determines the control requirements. The
following are few examples of content-dependent access control mechanisms:
Hiding or showing menus in an application
Views in databases
Controlling access to confidential information
Access control models
Access control models define methods by which a system controls the access to an object by
a subject. The upcoming headings are some of the models that are predominantly used in
the access control domain.
Discretionary access control
Discretionary access control employs an access control scheme where the subject has some
authority to specify the objects that are accessible to them. In simpler terms, access to an
asset is based on the discretion of the owner of the asset.
Access control list (ACL) is an example of discretionary access control, wherein users and
privileges are mapped. The following is a simple example of an access control list that
allows or denies a connection from a specific IP addresses by a router:
10 permit 10.1.1.1
20 permit 10.1.1.2
30 permit 10.1.3.0, wildcard bits 0.0.0.255
In the preceding example, the router allows connections from 10.1.1.1, 10.1.1.2, and all the
IP addresses in the 10.1.3.0 to 10.1.3.255 range, and denies any other connections. ACLs
implicitly deny anything not defined in the list.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 190 ]
Identity-based access control is a form of discretionary access control in which the control
is based on an individual's identity. For example, biometrics-based access control systems
are based on this type.
Non-discretionary access control
When the access to an object is based on certain rules, then it is called Rule-Based Access
Control (RBAC). For example, the clearance level of the subject and the classification level
of the object determines the access levels. Some practical examples include your college
providing Internet access during specific hours of the day (the rule here is based on time).
When access is controlled based on mandatory rules, then it is known as Mandatory Access
Control (MAC). This type of access control is based on security labels. The security label is
applicable to a subject as well as an object. A subject should have an equal or higher
security label than the object to access it. For example, most of the modern-day operating
systems, such as Vista or certain Linux variants, restrict the permissions of applications to
access certain processes, based on integrity or sensitiveness labels.
The acronym MAC is also used in computer networking, and it denotes
Media Access Control. This is an addressing scheme that provides a
unique hardware number to the network interface card.
If a centralized authority controls access based on a specific policy, then this is referred to as
non-discretionary access control.
Centralized access control is a facility in which all the core functions of access, such as 
Authentication, Authorization and Accountability (AAA), are performed from a
centralized location.
Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a type of non-discretionary access control based on
the subject's role or position in the organization. The majority of applications, such as 
Enterprise Resource Management (ERP) and Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES),
use this control as a default or a preferred option. For example, an Active Directory setup
may contain server admins, domain admins, and so on. Hence, people put in groups the
permissions assigned to groups based on the role.
Rule Based Access Control (RBAC) and Role based Access Control (RBAC)
share the same acronym RBAC.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 191 ]
Task-based access control is based on a subject's responsibilities in the organization. A role
may contain multiple tasks. For example, a role may contain tasks such as creating a user
record, and then provisioning the user to a specific system. In task-based access control, the
access is allowed only for specific tasks within a role and not all of them.
Lattice-based access control is one where there is a pair of values that determine the access
rights. The pair of values are related to least upper bound and the greatest lower bound in
the lattice model. This is another type of non-discretionary access control. This model is
usually represented in a grid-like setup where a subject and object are mapped.
In the following example, user levels and file levels are mapped in a lattice model to
represent access levels:
Decentralized access control or Distributed access control is such that the core functions of
the access are distributed over a network. A distributed database is an example of such a
system. In a distributed access control mechanism, authentication may be handled by a
centralized server, such as an Active Directory, and authorization may be handled by a
different source, such as a database.
Authentication and authorization
Identity and access management consists of two distinctive activities. One is related to the
identification of the subject by the system. The other is authentication and authorization, which
is the system's ability to validate the credential supplied by the subject and determine access
levels.
The authentication process may require more than one type of credential to validate the
identity. This type of validation is called factoring. Access security is enhanced when more
than one factor of authentication is used.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 192 ]
When an entity (subject) is validated against a single credential, then it is called a one-factor
authentication. For example, providing a user name and password to the system is a single-
factor authentication. Generally, the user name/password combination authenticates the
credentials from the principle of what you know (the user name and password).
When an entity (subject) is validated against two different credentials, then it is called a 
two-factor authentication. For example, providing a PIN along with the ATM or smart card
to the system is a two-factor authentication. In this scenario, the system authenticates the
credentials from the principle of what you have (a smart card) and what you know (a PIN)
When an entity (subject) is validated against two or more different credentials, then it is
called a multi-factor authentication. For example, providing a PIN along with the ATM or
smart card and also swiping your finger on the fingerprint (biometric) reader is a multi-
factor authentication. In this scenario, the system authenticates the credentials from three
factors, such as what you are (fingerprint), what you have, and what you know.
Biometric authentication validates biological characteristics to
authenticate the entity (user). This follows the principle “what you are”.
Some of the biometric authentication methods are: fingerprint scanning,
retina scanning, hand geometry, and face geometry.
Hence, strong authentication includes more than one factor. The more factors of
authentication using different mechanisms, the stronger the security is.
Authorization
Authorization is a process of determining the levels of access a subject may have on the
object. For example, when an employee accesses an intranet portal, based on the employee
type such as manager, administrator, or an ordinary employee, then the functions and
sections that are accessible to them may vary.
Authentication determines whether a user identification is valid and whether the user can have
access to the resource, whereas authorization determines what the user can access or which
resource the user can access.
From an information security perspective, attacking and compromising authorization
mechanisms gives higher privileges of access to the attacker. Such types of attack are called 
privilege escalation attacks.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 193 ]
Identity and provisioning life cycle
In an identity and provisioning life cycle, there are two distinctive activities. One is user
management and the other is system or application access. Furthermore, the life cycle
consists of the assignment of privileges through roles and delegation.
Observe the following illustration, a typical identity and provisioning life cycle consists of
these things:
Enrollment of users, which is creating and/or registering user accounts
Determining roles, privileges, and access requirements to systems and
applications
Provisioning user accounts to systems
Ongoing updates based on changes in roles, privileges, and access requirements
Deprovisioning in the case of user retirement or termination
Access control attacks and
countermeasures
There are many attacks that can be attributed to the compromise of access control systems
and processes to gain unauthorized access. The following are some of the most prominent
ones.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 194 ]
Port scanning and compromise
Backdoors are the unauthorized open ports created by malicious programs that allow an
unauthorized entity to gain access into the system. An important countermeasure is to
periodically check these open ports in the system and close the ports that are not used by
programs. Port scanning tools will help in this process. While port scanning helps security
tests to identify open ports, the scanners can also be used by attackers to find the entry
points to system.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) is a type of attack wherein the availability of the system is
compromised, and the legitimate users of the system are prevented from accessing their
desired resources. A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is a type of attack where
multiple systems attack a single resource from distributed locations. SYN attacks, Teardrop
attack, and Smurf are some examples of Denial-of-Service attacks. A countermeasure to DoS
attacks is regularly monitoring the network activities. Also, firewall and Intrusion
Protection Systems (IPS) have robust mechanisms to protect against such attacks.
Hijacking
Hijacking is an attack in which the session established by the client to the server is taken
over by a malicious person or process. A strong session management and encryption is the
countermeasure for such attacks.
The Man-in-the-Middle attack (MIIM) is a type of attack where an attacker hijacks the
established session to the server by substituting his public key instead of the client. MIIM
attacks are also used to surreptitiously listen to network communications.
TCP hijacking is a type of attack in which the TCP session of the trusted client to the server
is hijacked by an attacker.
Malicious codes
Malicious codes are prevalent in the information technology environment and are varied in
use and purpose. The basic functionality of malicious code is to execute itself in the client
machine and compromise security. Important countermeasures are to use and update
antivirus systems, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 195 ]
A trojan horse is a type of malicious code that comes disguised inside a trusted program.
Once installed, this malicious code can open ports, create backdoors to the system, and do
innumerable security breaches. When the Trojan horse is activated on a particular event
(such as a particular date), then it is called a logic bomb.
Malicious mobile codes are the ones that are executed in the client system through the
network from a remote server.
Password attacks
Password guessing is a type of attack that uses various methods to obtain user passwords.
The use of strong password with a combination of alpha, numeric, and special characters is
a countermeasure. Besides, adhering to strict password policies, such as frequent change of
passwords, length of passwords, and history of passwords, are effective against such
attacks.
Dictionary attacks are a type of password-guessing attack that checks the encrypted
password database with words found in a dictionary.
Brute force attacks are the means by which the password database is attacked with every
possible character combination.
Hybrid attacks combine the dictionary as well as brute force attacks.
Replay attacks are ones in which the session (such as authentication) is captured and
replayed against the system. In such attacks, valid authentication tokens are played back at
a later time by an unauthorized user. These authentication tokens are commonly obtained
through MIIM attacks.
Vulnerability compromises
Scanning is an attack to probe the network and system to identify the vulnerabilities for
planning a possible attack to compromise.
Vulnerability exploitation is a way of attacking systems by compromising the holes or
errors in the operating system or application software to gain access or bypass security
controls.
Spoofing is a type of attack to imitate a trusted entity, thereby making the system trust this
imitated entity. IP spoofing is an example of such an attack.

Day 12 – Identity and Access Management - Access Management, Provisioning, and Attacks
[ 196 ]
Social engineering is a type of attack to obtain credential information, such as passwords,
pin numbers, and so on, using social skills such as impersonation or fake e-mails. Generally,
social-engineering attacks exploit human nature, such desires to please or be helpful to
others, as well as ignorance.
An important countermeasure for the vulnerability compromise of systems is to
periodically scan and fix the vulnerabilities in the IT systems using vendor-supplied
patches, along with other means of filtering and protection using suitable vulnerability
management tools.
Accountability
In identity and access management, accountability aspects play a major role in establishing
preventative, detective, and corrective controls to access control attacks. Accountability, in
simple terms, can be defined as monitoring activities of the authorized user. In other words, it is
used for ensuring that the authorized users access the systems and perform activities for
legitimate purposes.
When an attacker compromises a system, then the primary step for such an attack would be
escalating privileges to get an authorized administrator level of access. Hence, it is
important to establish strong accountability mechanisms to mitigate privilege-escalation
attacks. Similarly, accountability measures provide audit data to validate available identity
and access management controls and improve them.
Some of the common accountability measures in this domain are as follows:
Logging
System monitoring
Session recording
Keystroke monitoring
Auditing

An overview of security assessment and
testing
Risk management involves assessment and testing pertaining to security. Controls such as
preventive, detective, or corrective measures require appropriate design and
implementation. During the design, development, implementation, and operational phases
of security controls, assessment and testing need to be performed on periodical basis to
ascertain the effectiveness of security controls and their continued suitability for protecting
the assets.
Generally, security assessment and testing is carried out on the basis of suitably designed
assessment and test strategies. Such strategies include the application of suitable testing
tools, methods, and techniques. It is also important that the outcome of the test results
provide the data pertaining to the effectiveness of the implemented security control.
Observe the following illustration. IT assets, such as computers, contain operating systems,
databases, and applications. They are used in business in day-to-day operations, transaction
processing in e-commerce, in universities, and so on. Security issues in such systems could
provide unauthorized access or denial of service. Security assessment and testing methods
and tools provide the identification of security issues and mitigate them:

In this module, you will understand the following:
Designing and validating assessment and test strategies
Security testing and tools, methods, and techniques
The effectiveness of controls
Security assessment and test strategies
Information technology infrastructure consists of heterogeneous combinations of software,
hardware, networking, and communication-related assets. Such a combination is used in
design, development, production, and business operations. Risk assessments on IT
infrastructure provide an area of risk on the assets and the impact to business that it would
have if the assessed risk materializes. However, risk is a function of probability and
consequence. Hence, both the probability and consequence of a risk to business needs to be
adequately ascertained in order to design suitable security controls. Such controls have to
be effective in mitigating the risk. In this context, proper security assessments and test
strategies are required to ascertain the suitability of controls to mitigate the assessed risk,
and their continued effectiveness if the risk value changes.
Security assessment and test strategies are administrative controls that provide processes
and procedures to operate and continually assess the effectiveness of controls. This chapter
provides some of the assessment and testing strategies that are recommended in best
practices, standards, or are emphasized in regulatory or other frameworks.
Designing and validating assessment and testing
strategies
Security assessment and testing strategies are based on risk to assets. They play a pivotal
role in providing inputs while assessing the risk and the validation of risk mitigation
actions. Hence, while designing assessments and tests, and during the validation of such 
assessment and tests, it is important to consider the risk assessment results and the
identified or implemented controls. For example, a two-factor authentication system may be
implemented as part of a risk mitigation strategy for password compromises.

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 202 ]
A security assessment and test on such a control should include technical tests, such as
dictionary-attack simulations, as well as social engineering like phishing or calling
techniques to ascertain the control effectiveness. Similarly, a technical vulnerability
assessment in an operating system may focus on the identification of such a vulnerability
and the effectiveness of administrative controls, such as patch management.
In essence, security assessment is a combination of security tests and the validation of
security control effectiveness based on the test results. A security assessment strategy is
based on the requirements from the information security policy, generic and domain-
specific business requirements, and risk management processes.
Security controls
Risk mitigation strategies involve the security controls that address one or more risk areas.
For example, preventative controls are designed and implemented to prevent a security
violation from happening. Similarly, detective controls are designed and rolled out to detect
a security violation; reactive and recovery controls assist in business continuity in the event
of a disaster or disruptions to business processes.
This security violation can stem from either an inadvertent or malicious breach of a security
policy. For example, a security policy may state that Non-Public Information (NPI) such as
internal communications between board members or internal project information should not be
exposed to general public. If an employee posts such kind of information in a public blog, or if
he sends out such information to an external entity through e-mail, then this will constitute
a security violation. Such an act by an employee may be inadvertent. However, if an
employee sends out such information to an external entity for a monetary benefit, then such
an act is malicious.
Regardless of the intent of the act by the employee, the violation has to be identified and
categorized as an incident for suitable remedial action. Any control that captures a security
policy violation is an example of a security control.
Security controls can target a specific domain as well as combinations of domains. For
example, preventive-physical controls are preventative controls that address physical
security requirements. Similarly, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a detective control
that is available for IT networks as well as physical infrastructure.
Identifying suitable security controls is based on the security assessment, which in turn is a
part of the risk management process. Once a suitable security control is identified, then its
integration with the systems, associated processes, and the operations they perform should
be a controlled activity. Besides, the data that is used for testing and the output of testing

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 203 ]
also needs to be a controlled activity.
Information-security standards, legal-regulatory frameworks and best practice
recommendations provide baseline requirements for security assessments and expected test
outcomes. However, a specific security control for an assessed risk depends on the risk
mitigation strategy and is sometimes specific to the type of business.
For example, a bank may require a different type of security control compared to a research
organization for the similar types of IT operations. Hence, security assessment and testing
draw methods that are based on a combination of baseline standard requirements and
domain-specific control needs.
The following sections describe various standard security assessments and test strategies,
along with the expected outcomes of such security control testing. The expected outcomes
can also be termed as the performance metrics for a security control.
Conduct security control testing
Generally, security control testing involves testing for the effectiveness of the control. In
other words, whether the implemented control is performing as expected. A couple of
examples of measurements of performance for a control would be the relevancy and
adequacy of the control.
For example, to identify technical vulnerabilities in an off-the-shelf software product,
relevant technical tools are required. Such tools are called scanners. However, such a tool
may be inadequate for identifying vulnerabilities for logical implementation errors, which
may require a different type of approach.
Vulnerability assessments
Vulnerability tests and assessments are performed to ascertain the presence of technical
vulnerabilities or weaknesses in a system. It could be an IT system or any other automation
product. Vulnerability in IT systems such as operating systems, an application software, or
a network implementation can be considered as a hole or an error. Being technically an
error, a vulnerability may allow a security violation to happen.
In the parlance of security, a security violation that happens due to a vulnerability is called
a vulnerability compromise or vulnerability exploitation. Such exploitation may affect the
confidentiality, integrity, or availability requirement of an organization's IT assets. For
example, a buffer overflow vulnerability exploit may allow unauthorized access to the
system or result in Denial-of-Service to legitimate users.

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 204 ]
Vulnerability types, attacks and impacts are covered in detail in Chapter
6, Day 6 – Security Engineering – Security design, practices, models and
Vulnerability mitigation.
Vulnerability tests are performed to ascertain the presence of vulnerabilities that are
published either by the application vendor or by an unknown one. When an identified
vulnerability is not published by the application vendor, then it is called a zero-day
vulnerability. Sometimes, an exploit code may be published by security or malicious groups.
Such an exploit code is called zero-day exploits.
Hence, periodical vulnerability tests have to be performed to identify known and unknown
vulnerabilities. Such tests reveal the effectiveness of security controls such as patch
management; and for zero-day vulnerabilities, such tests reveal the effectiveness of
compensating controls. Some of the areas where vulnerability tests are performed include
the following:
Operating system software
Application software including web applications
Firmware
SCADA systems
Industrial control systems
Compensating controls are security controls that compensate for the lack
of actual security control. In a zero-day vulnerability scenario, if a patch is
not available for an identified vulnerability then additional monitoring
may act as a compensating control for attack detection.
Penetration testing
Penetration testing is often performed to ascertain break-in possibilities to systems. In other
words, penetration tests are done to ascertain the exploitation possibilities of identified or
unidentified vulnerabilities that are present in the software but are yet to be identified or
published.
An identified vulnerability may be exploited; in other words, the vulnerability here is tested
by trying to get unauthorized access possibilities to the application or system. A penetration
test simulates an attack scenario. The scenario could be from the perspective of an internal
authorized user such as an employee, an external entity, or a combination of both.

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 205 ]
The tests are performed using different attack scenarios. The scenarios are based on the
level of information available to the tester or an attacker. The following section lists some of
the most common test or attack scenarios.
Black box testing
In black box testing, the network and application details are unknown to the tester. This is
to simulate an external attacker trying to compromise the network or application from
external locations, without the knowledge of internal configurations and the application's
infrastructure.
White box testing
In white box testing, the network and application infrastructure is provided to the tester
including configuration details. Hence, the test is performed to simulate the possibility of an
attack by an internal user, who is an employee with in-depth knowledge about the
infrastructure.
Grey box testing
A grey box testing can be considered as a combination of black box and a white box. In this
scenario, some information about the infrastructure is known. For example, vendors may
need to be provided access to internal applications. However, they may access the systems
from external networks or connect to the corporate networks using technologies such as
VPN. This test will simulate the possibility of an attack from such a setup.
Log reviews
Log reviews are a part of monitoring activities. Logs reveal a trail of transactions or
activities that have taken place in real-time monitoring scenarios, while the activities are
going on. Generally, a log review is a part of the accountability domain wherein the
activities of the authorized users are monitored.
A log is a Write Once Read Many (WORM) type of data. The protection of log data itself is
an important security control. If the integrity of the log data is lost, then the log review
mechanism itself will produce erroneous results. Hence, an important security control such
as “segregation of duties” is enforced for such data.
The segregation of duties and other security controls are described in the earlier chapters.

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 206 ]
Synthetic transactions
These are generally used for performance monitoring, and hence, they are directly
associated with the availability tenet of the information-security triad. Such kind of
transaction testing is sometimes referred to as a real process or user monitoring. While log
monitoring or reviewing can be used for checking all the three tenets of the information
security, synthetic transaction tests focus mainly on the availability of systems and
processes during different use case scenarios. Generally, a use case scenario in this type of
test is stress or load testing.
Some of the tests in synthetic transactions are mentioned here.
Stress tests
While software or hardware is built to certain operational limits, stress tests are performed
to test the robustness of the operational capabilities. For example, how much physical 
memory the application requires under certain test conditions, such as the number of
transactions per hour, can be ascertained through stress tests.
Denial-of-Service tests
Denial-of-Service (DoS) is a type of test used to check the availability of a service under
different conditions such as multiple and simultaneous requests. Using such tests involves
flooding the application or network with many requests and checking the application or
network-response times. If such a test is simulated from multiple networks to a single-
targeted system, then it is called a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) test.
Load tests
Load tests are performed to simulate the performance of an application under load. For
example, peak office hour loads versus non-business hour operations. The outcome of load
tests will assist in defining or enhancing the capacity of the infrastructure or devising
appropriate business-continuity plans.
Concurrency tests
This test is performed to test the application with a concurrent user activity. Generally,
applications may not be accessed concurrently by all users. However, when an application
is accessed concurrently by multiple users, then the request processing may get delayed.
For example, the opening of a reservation window in a web application for a popular sports
activity. Many users may try to book tickets at the same time, which increases the stress or
load.

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 207 ]
Latency test
Any request to a network or an application may involve a round trip of data—from the
user, to application, and the resultant data back to the user. A latency test is used to check
the round-trip time. The more time it takes for the request to reach the application, results
in more time for the response to the user and vice-versa.
Code review and testing
Code review and testing involves testing the source code of an application for the presence
of technical vulnerabilities as well as performance and logical issues. The following types of
tests are applicable for code review.
Manual code review
A manual review of code is performed to check for any logical errors based on the
application structure. Besides, such a review is conducted to check adherence to coding
standards. Manual code reviews are generally done by the peer group of software
developers or selected reviewers.
Dynamic code review
In dynamic code reviews, or the testing of a program, the software is executed in a
simulated system or a virtual processor. In such tests, the program is fed with the required
input values as well as malicious data to test the operational efficiency and security
effectiveness.
Static code review
Contrary to dynamic code review, in a static review a software code is analyzed without
executing the program code. This process is also called static code analysis. Unlike a manual
review, a static review is mostly performed using automated tools to check for security,
performance, and logical issues in an application code.
Fuzz code review
When random data is fed to an application as input values (sometimes, a large amount of
random data as well) to test for application performance and security, then such a test is
called a fuzz test. The purpose of a fuzz test is to test for application resilience in the event
of unknown or unrelated data streams.

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 208 ]
Misuse case testing
In this type of test, the reverse of use case is tested. In other words, doing a malicious act
against a system is the misuse case of a normal act. For example, if an application is
designed to perform a mathematical calculation and provide an input, such as an image
data, then this is a misuse case. Generally, a security attack itself is a misuse case, which
deviates from the purpose for which the application was actually built, and it is done to
compromise the system.
Test coverage analysis
Generally, a software or an application code may not be completely taken up for code
analysis due to the time-consuming process. Hence, the sample coverage of code is taken up
for analysis. There may be security issues due to lesser test coverage. Similarly, all types of
code reviews or other tests may not be conducted on the application. Hence, based on the
security requirements, metrics have to be evaluated to identify the required tests, and the
optimum level of code samples are required for testing. An analysis performed to identify
such metrics is called a test coverage analysis.
Interface testing
User interfaces are gateways between man-machine interactions. Such interactions can be
through the simple text methods of interaction—which are sometimes referred to as
command-line interfaces—Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and Application Programming
Interfaces (API). Interface testing is done to ascertain the security during interactions
between user to interfaces and interface to modules. For example, a user may be accessing a
web application that requires a login. This is an example of a user interacting with an
interface to provide an input. After the user provides the input (for example, the
username/password), the application passes this to an authentication module for
verification; and based on the feedback from the module, it allows the user to access the
application. This is an example of an interface application to the module interaction.
The API
An API is a method to interact with applications through request-response calls rather than
through a graphical user interface. API's are generally published by the application vendor
with available methods and parameters to interact with the application. An API test
involves the testing of functionality, performance, and security.

Day 13 – Security Assessment and Testing - Designing, Performing Security Assessment, and Tests
[ 209 ]
The UI
A User Interface (UI) testing can include Command-Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User
Interface (GUI) testing. The focus of such tests include the operations that can be performed
through user interfaces. The performances of such user interfaces and the security of data
during the interactions are the focus of such tests. Besides, the usability aspects of the
interface are also tested.
Physical
Physical interfaces are generally used in instruments where operating parameters can be
adjusted using physical buttons, switches, rotating units, and so on. Human interaction to
computing devices using touch interactions can also be grouped under physical interfaces.
For example, a biometric reader is a physical input from the user. Tests such as pressure,
temperature, and environmental conditions are relevant for such interfaces.
The effectiveness of controls
In security, the effectiveness requirements of tools take precedence over efficiency. For
example, a 100% efficient antivirus software that allows 10% of critical viruses to go
undetected is an ineffective application. Similarly, systems that have high false-positive and
false-negative rates are ineffective as well.
Summary
This chapter has covered foundational concepts in security assessment and testing
strategies. Designing and validating security assessment and test strategies are important
parts of the security profession. Conducting security tests provides information about
vulnerabilities in the systems and can also be used to test the effectiveness of security
controls. Depending on the type of IT asset, a suitable test method has to be adopted.
Vulnerability assessment and penetration tests are generally conducted on networks and
servers. Software tests including load tests and code reviews are conducted on application
programs.
Continued in the next chapter are topics in this domain pertaining to the collection analysis
of security test data, which include reporting internal and third-party auditing
requirements.

Day 14 – Security Assessment
and Testing - Controlling,
Analyzing, Auditing, and
Reporting
This chapter covers management and operational controls pertaining to security process
data. Analyzing and reporting test outputs either automated or through manual methods,
and conducting or facilitating internal and third party audits are covered in detail.
A candidate appearing for the CISSP exam is expected to understand the foundational
concepts and have knowledge in the following key areas of controlling, analyzing,
auditing, and reporting security tests from the security assessment and testing domains:
Management and operational controls on security process data
Disaster recovery and business continuity
Analyzing and reporting test outputs
Internal and third-party security audits

Day 14 – Security Assessment and Testing - Controlling, Analyzing, Auditing, and Reporting
[ 213 ]
An overview of controlling, analyzing,
auditing, and reporting security test data
Security controls can be grouped as administrative and technical. The physical verification
of an employee badge is a procedural administrative security control. Similarly, an access
control system, such as a card reader that automates such a verification, is a technical 
security control. The function of a security control is based on data.
There are two types of applicable data pertaining to security controls. One is the data that is
provided to the control for processing, in other words, the input data to the control. The
other is security process data, in other words, the output data. For example, during a
vulnerability scan on systems, lots of process data is available. Similarly, monitoring
systems, such as intrusion prevention or detection systems, generate process data during
control operations.
The input and output data of a security process has to be secured for analysis and establish
an audit trail. Besides, such process data may need to be preserved for a longer period of
time based on legal and regulatory requirements:
In this module, you will learn the following:
Understanding the collection of security process data
Understanding key performance and risk indicators
Understanding disaster recovery and business continuity
Getting an overview of automated and manual test results analysis and reporting
methods
Understanding internal and third-party audits and requirements

Day 14 – Security Assessment and Testing - Controlling, Analyzing, Auditing, and Reporting
[ 214 ]
A collection of security process data
Security control implementation should be based on the outcome of risk assessment, and it
is part of risk mitigation strategy. A strategy is based on the security policies, and the
implementation and maintenance of a strategy is based on security procedures. One of the
key requirements for security control is to demonstrate that the implemented control
satisfies the requirements of the risk mitigation strategy, and in turn demonstrate adherence
to established security policies and procedures.
Hence, a security control, whether technical, administrative, or physical, should provide
sufficient data to establish that security policies and procedures are continuously and uniformly
applied.
The data pertaining to a security control can be of two forms. One is data that is provided as
an input to the control. The other is data that is generated or used during the process of an
event and the output of control action. The input data can be a sample data or a live data.
The output data of a process is called a control or audit log, which also contains the control
action.
A control log contains triggers and a trace of activities. A control action contains the
decision taken based on the activity and the trigger. For example, an e-mail sent out by an
employee with confidential information maybe allowed or disallowed based on the security
policy. A control log will contain these triggers based on policy and subsequent events as
activity logs. Hence, confidential information in the e-mail triggers the security policy. The
control action may block, warn, or raise an incident, advise encryption, and so on.
Before implementing a security control, sample test data may be used to verify the accuracy
of the control. For example, databases containing information may be used as test data.
Similarly, a collection of security process data is critical in establishing the audit trail, along
with demonstrating that the application of security policies and procedures are continuous
and uniform.
Hence, it is essential that both the input and output data that are used in security process
has to be controlled. The following sections describe best practices for the control of security
process data.

Day 14 – Security Assessment and Testing - Controlling, Analyzing, Auditing, and Reporting
[ 215 ]
The control of security process data
Security process data establishes the audit trail including the action taken on a specific
security event. Hence, the logs are important for any further investigation and/or to
demonstrate adherence to security policies as well as any legal, regulatory, or contractual
requirements. Any tampering of the security process data, data corruption, or non-
availability will lead to non-compliance. Hence, it is important that this security process
data is preserved and controlled as per the established data storage and retention norms as
per business policies.
The protection and control of system test data
System test data may contain sensitive information. The selection of test data, protection,
and control is a mandatory requirement in many regulatory frameworks. Some such
requirements include the following:
Avoiding operational databases that contain personal or sensitive information
In case of using personal or sensitive information for testing purposes, then
controlled removal of the data from test environment
Establishing suitable access-control procedures to test systems
Enforcing the segregation of duties
Authorization policies for test systems
Erasing operational information from test systems after the completion of tests
Logging off all test activities to provide an audit trail
Audit logging
The activities of users, exceptions, and information security events are recorded in audit
logs. These logs need to be retained for longer period of time based on data or log retention
policies.
Audit logs include the following:
User IDs and their access events, such as logon and logoff
Terminal or location from which the user accessed the system
The result of control action pertaining to the access attempt, for example, allowed
or rejected
Any changes to system configuration
Accessed information including files and data

Day 14 – Security Assessment and Testing - Controlling, Analyzing, Auditing, and Reporting
[ 216 ]
Any bypasses such as deactivation of a security control or using malicious
application
Audit logs are essential for future investigations and access control monitoring.
System logs
Monitoring system logs for security events involve segregating the security-related log
information from the overall logs. It is also best practice to separately copy or save security
event information from system logs to a different file or location.
Administrator and operator logs
System administration or super user accounts have complete control over the system in
most of the operating systems. These accounts are also single point of failure in many
systems. Monitoring system administration and operator activities are critical to security
and hence usage of such accounts must be logged.
Similar to audit logging, system administrator access and the actions performed by the
administrator must also be logged. Such a log should be reviewed on a regular basis to
demonstrate compliance to system administration monitoring.
Fault logging
Faults in systems may be reported by users or the application fault or error messages
should be appropriately logged to an error or a fault-log file. Fault logs should be reviewed
periodically to implement corrective measures as well as devise appropriate preventive
controls.
Key performance and risk indicators
The data from security processes can indicate several important parameters. One is related
to the performance of the security tools and the other is related to risk. For example, a tool
monitoring a storage device may provide information, such as the data retrieval time in
terms of performance, and provide a capacity utilization to highlight the risk of exceeding
the disk quota.
Such data is useful in determining the disaster-recovery and business-continuity needs, and
it will help in establishing appropriate plans for business continuity.

Day 14 – Security Assessment and Testing - Controlling, Analyzing, Auditing, and Reporting
[ 217 ]
Disaster recovery and business continuity
In the context of process data, disaster-recovery and business-continuity plans include 
backup procedures and recovery mechanisms.
In the event of a system overload, a catastrophic system failure, or the loss of facility, such
data is essential for audit trails and for devising suitable BC and DR plans.
Analyzing security process data
Data analysis is one of the core activities used to establish a security violation as well as
control effectiveness. Two parameters are used in this industry to indicate the effectiveness
of control from the perspective of identified security violations. One parameter is called the
false positive rate and the other is the false negative rate. False positive flags an event as a
security violation when it is not. On the other hand, false negative fails to flag a security
violation.
False positives
A security process or tool may flag an event as a security violation while the event is not.
For example, a fingerprint scanner used in identity and access management may reject a
legitimate entity after scanning. This may be due to incorrect or insufficient samples of the
entity's finger prints. Such a control action is called false positive action.
False negatives
When a security process or a tool allows an illegitimate event to pass through without
raising a security violation, then it is called false negative. For example, an unauthorized
entity is allowed to access a resource that requires authorization.
The effectiveness of a security control or a process can also be determined by false positive
and false negative rates. Generally, such data will provide inputs to adjust the sensitivity
settings of a security control.

Day 14 – Security Assessment and Testing - Controlling, Analyzing, Auditing, and Reporting
[ 218 ]
The effectiveness of a security control
A security control is considered to be effective when the false positive and false negative
rates are minimum. This implies that the security control is performing as per the
requirement of the security policy.
The effectiveness of a security control can be ascertained from audits. Periodical internal or
third-party audits provide the verification and validation of the control implementation and
performance.
Internal and third-party security audits
Audits provide a method to validate adherence to security policies and procedures by the
business. Audits consist of verification and validation actions to identify compliance and
non-compliance. The verification process in an audit checks the availability of suitable
processes to support policies and procedures. The validation process in an audit to check
adequacy, the correctness of a process, and the adequacy of controls.
Internal audits
When a business audits its processes through its internal audit department, then such an
exercise is called an internal audit. An internal audit is generally performed by the business
using its own resources. The purpose of an internal audit is to regularly validate various
business systems for policy and procedural compliance.
Third-party audits
In third-party audits, an independent agency or entity that is not associated with the
business performs the audit. The auditors are external to the organization. The purpose of
third-party audits is twofold. One is the independent verification of security posture. The
other one is for certification purposes, such as compliance or standards-related certification.
Information system audit controls
In both internal and third-party audits, when the audits are performed on information
systems, it is important to consider that such audits have a minimum disruption to business
processes.

Some of the best practices in information system audit controls include the following:
The management, agreement, and acceptance for audit requirements
Agreement on the scope prior to audit
Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) with auditors
Unless required for audit process, allowing only read-only access of data to the
auditors
Monitoring all auditor access
Agreed responsibilities of auditors
Ensuring that the persons carrying out the audit are independent of the activity
being audited
Reporting test and audit outputs
The test and audit data has to be presented in a format suitable for making management
and administrative decisions. Such a process is called audit reporting, and the outcome is an
audit report. A test report can identify specific areas of administrative controls, and it
provides the test results of a security-testing activity. An audit report will be a consolidated
view of adherence to security policies, procedures, as well as compliance to specific legal or
regulatory requirements or information security standards.
Test and audit reports need to be backed up and archived for future investigations or
compliance requirements. The time period for such archival varies between standards and
regulatory requirements.
Summary
This chapter has covered foundational concepts in controlling, analyzing, auditing, and
reporting the security process and test data. The preservation of security test data is
essential in the event of audits and establishing audit trail. It is also used in demonstrating
the effectiveness of implemented security control. Methods such as analyzing the security
data and internal and third-party audits are conducted to provide evidence that the
application of security policies and procedures are continuous and uniform.
Next is a review chapter that includes the content from chapters 11 to 14 in an exam cram
format. References and further study for the four chapters are provided. A mock test
consisting of about 10 questions is also provided.

Presented here is a revision of the concepts discussed in the previous four chapters, that is,
chapters eleven through fourteen. They are provided in bullet points as snippets that are
easy to revise. These snippets are for a quick revision and reinforcement of the knowledge
learned:
CISSP CBK Domain #5 – identity and access
management
The following bullet points are in an exam cram format for a quick revision. They cover
important points from the identity and access management domain. The covered topics
include physical and logical access to assets, Identity Management principles and
implementation, identity as a service, third-party identity services, access management,
authorization mechanisms, identity and provisioning life cycle, and preventing or
mitigating access control attacks:
The overall process of facilitating and managing identities and controlling access
to assets while ensuring information security is termed as identity and access
management (IAM).
Identity and access management domain can further be subdivided into two
interrelated management activities, such as Identity Management and Access
Management.
Identity and access management consists of four distinctive principles and
practices. They are Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and
Accountability.
Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability are together referred to as the
Triple A of Access Control.
Identity management includes some or all of the following:
The enrollment of user identifiers.
The provisioning of user identities to different systems.
Updating all associated accounts whenever there is a change in
user information.
If the user no longer needs access or is retired, then deprovisioning
user accounts that are no longer required.

Day 15 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 224 ]
When software is delivered as a service through the Internet cloud, then it is
generically termed as Software as a Service (SaaS).
When identity and access management applications and associated services are
delivered through subscription-based cloud models, such services are termed as 
Identity as a Service (IDaaS).
Access management is facilitated through authentication and authorization
processes.
The access management layer also consists of accountability mechanisms, such as
logging and monitoring activities.
The primary concept in access control is to understand about a subject and an
object.
A subject may be a person, process, or technology component that either seeks
access or controls the access.
An object can be a file, data, a physical equipment, or premises that needs
controlled access.
Controlling access to the object by a subject is the core requirement of access
control.
If access to an object is controlled based on certain contextual parameters such as
location, time, sequence of responses, access history and more, then it is known
as context-dependent access control.
If the access is provided based on the attributes or content of an object, then it is
called content-dependent access control.
Access control models define methods by which a system controls the access to
the object by a subject.
Discretionary access control is one in which the subject has some authority to
specify the objects that are accessible to them. Access control list (ACL) is an
example of discretionary access control.
When access to the object is based on certain rules, then it is called Rule-Based
Access Control (RBAC).
When the access is controlled based on mandatory rules, then it is known as 
Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
If a centralized authority controls the access based on a specific policy, then the
same is referred to as non-discretionary access control.
A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a non-discretionary access control based
on the subject's role or position in the organization.

Day 15 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 225 ]
A task-based access control is based on a subject's responsibilities in the
organization.
A lattice-based access control is one where there is a pair of values that
determine the access rights.
Decentralized access control or Distributed access control is where the core
functions of access are distributed over a network.
Identity and access management consists of two distinctive activities:
One is related to the identification of the subject by the system.
The other is authentication and authorization, which is the system's
ability to validate the credential supplied by the subject and
determine access levels.
When an entity (subject) is validated against a single credential, then it is called a 
one-factor authentication and generally uses the what you know principle.
When an entity (subject) is validated against two different credentials, then it is
called a two-factor authentication and generally uses the what you have principle.
When an entity (subject) is validated against two or more different credentials,
then it is called a multifactor authentication and generally uses the what you
are principle.
Authorization is a process of determining the levels of access a subject may have
on the object.
In the identity and provisioning life cycle, there are two distinctive activities. One
is user management and the other is system or application access.
There are many attacks that can be attributed to the compromise of access control
systems and processes to gain unauthorized access.
Backdoors are unauthorized open ports created by malicious programs that
allow an authorized entity to gain access into the system.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) is a type of attack wherein the legitimate users of the
system are prevented from access by disturbing the availability.
A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) is a type of attack where multiple
systems attack a single resource from distributed locations.
Hijacking is an attack in which the session established by the client to the server
is taken over by the malicious person or process.
Man-in-the-Middle attack is a type of attack where an attacker hijacks the
established session of a client to the server by impersonating a client.
TCP hijacking is a type of attack in which the TCP session of the trusted client to
the server is hijacked by an attacker.

Day 15 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 226 ]
Malicious codes executes itself in the client machine and compromises the
security.
The Trojan horse is one type of malicious code that comes disguised inside a
trusted program.
When the Trojan horse is activated on a particular event (such as a particular
date), then it is called a logic bomb.
Malicious mobile codes are the ones that are executed in the client system
through the network from a remote server.
Password guessing is one of the attacks that uses various methods to obtain user
passwords.
Dictionary attacks are a type of password-guessing attack that checks the
encrypted password database with the words found in the dictionary.
Brute force attacks are the means by which the password database is attacked
with all the types of letters and possible combinations of characters.
Hybrid attacks combine the dictionary as well as brute force attacks.
Replay attacks are the ones in which the session (such as authentication) is
captured and replayed against the system.
Scanning is an attack used to probe the network and system to identify the
vulnerabilities for planning a possible attack to compromise.
Vulnerability exploitation is the way of attacking systems by compromising the
holes or errors in the operating system or application software to gain access or
bypass security controls.
Spoofing is a type of attack used to imitate a trusted entity, thereby making the
system trust this imitated entity.
Social engineering is a type of attack used to obtain credential information such
as passwords, pin numbers, and so on using social skills, such as impersonation,
fake e-mails, and so on.
In identity and access management, accountability aspects play a major role in
establishing preventative, detective, and corrective controls to access control
attacks.
Accountability, in simple terms, can be defined as monitoring the activities of the
authorized user.

CISSP CBK Domain #6 – security assessment
and testing
The following bullet points are presented in an exam cram format for a quick revision. They
cover important points from the identity and access management domain. The covered
topics include security assessment and testing strategies, security control testing, designing
and validating assessment and testing strategies, security testing tools, methods and
techniques, and evaluating the effectiveness of controls:
Risk management involves assessment and testing pertaining to security.
Security assessment and testing is carried out based on suitably designed
assessment and test strategies.
Security assessment and test strategies are administrative controls that provide
processes and procedures to operate and continually assess the effectiveness of
controls.
Security assessment and test strategies are based on risk to assets.
Information security standards, legal-regulatory frameworks, and best practice
recommendations provide a baseline requirements for security assessments and
expected test outcomes.
Vulnerability tests and assessments are performed to ascertain the presence of
technical vulnerabilities or some kind of weakness in systems.
When an identified vulnerability is not published by the application vendor, then
it is called a zero-day vulnerability.
When an exploit code is published by security or malicious groups before a patch
release by the vendor, then it is called zero-day exploits.
Penetration testing is often performed to ascertain break-in possibilities
in systems.
In black-box testing, the network and application details are unknown to the
tester.
In white-box testing, the network and application infrastructure is provided to
the tester, including configuration details.
A grey-box testing can be considered as a combination of black box and a white
box. In this scenario, some information about the infrastructure is known.
Log reviews area a part of monitoring activities.
Logs reveal a trail of transactions or activities that have taken place and in real-
time monitoring scenarios while the activities are going on.

Day 15 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 228 ]
Synthetic transactions are generally used for performance monitoring, and
hence, they are directly associated with the availability tenet of the information
security triad.
Stress tests are performed to test the robustness of the operational capabilities.
Denial-of-Service (DoS) is a type of test used to check the availability of a service
under different conditions, such as multiple and simultaneous requests.
Load tests are performed to simulate the performance of an application under
load.
Concurrency tests are performed to test the application with concurrent user
activity.
Latency tests check the round-trip time of a request response.
Code review and testing involves testing the source code of an application for
the presence of technical vulnerabilities as well as performance and logical issues.
A manual code review is performed to check for any logical errors based on the
application's structure.
In a dynamic code review or testing of a program, the software is executed in a
simulated system or a virtual processor.
In a static code review, a software code is analyzed without executing the
program code.
A misuse case test is the reverse of a use case test. In other words, doing a
malicious act against a system is the misuse case of a normal act.
An analysis performed to identify metrics for code coverage is called the test
coverage analysis.
Interface testing is done to ascertain the security during interactions between a
user to interfaces and interface to modules.
An API test involves the testing of the functionality, performance, and security of
application programming interfaces.
A User Interface (UI) testing can include Command-Line Interface (CLI) or
Graphical User Interface (GUI) testing. The focus of such tests includes
operations that can be performed through user interfaces.
Tests such as pressure, temperature, and environment conditions are used in 
physical interface tests.
In security effectiveness, the requirements of tools take precedence over
efficiency.
An assurance of effective software and applications is a requirement and is
ascertained through security testing.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 233 ]
An overview of operations security
Assets, such as data, are accessed and processed in operational areas through systems and
applications. Similarly, access to facilities, such as data centers and operational areas, are
facilitated through access control mechanisms. Hence, physical access to operational areas
needs to have appropriate controls for strong authentication and authorization.
Observe the following illustration. Users need access to physical facilities such as
operational areas. Such physical areas can be subdivided into perimeter and interior
sections. Controlling access to operational areas, and the process of identifying and blocking
unauthorized intrusions to the operational areas are primary security requirements in this
domain. In the scenario of a physical intrusion, it is essential to identify breaches and
implement control actions, including investigations:
In this module, you will learn about the following:
Applying secure principles to the site and facility design
Designing and implementing physical security
Understanding logging and monitoring activities
Understanding and supporting investigations
An overview of investigation types
An overview of security while the provision of resources
Understanding operations security
Employing resource protection techniques

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 234 ]
The physical security design
While designing a robust physical security environment, a security professional needs to
take into account the following three important parameters:
The physical facility
Geographic operating location
Supporting facilities
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-12: An
Introduction to Computer Security – The NIST Handbook explains these three parameters
next.
Physical facility
The physical facility is usually the building, other structure, or vehicle housing the system
and network components.
Systems can be characterized, based upon their operating location, as static, mobile, or
portable:
Static systems are installed in structures at fixed locations
Mobile systems are installed in vehicles that perform the function of a structure
but not at a fixed location
Portable systems are not permanently installed in fixed operating locations
Geographic operating location
Natural threats such as earthquakes and floods; man-made threats such as burglary and
civil disorders; communication-related threats such as the interception of transmissions or
emanations and electromagnetic interference; and chemical threats such as toxic chemical
spills, explosions, fire, and so on; have to be taken into consideration while determining the
facility's general geographic operating location.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 235 ]
Supporting facilities
Supporting facilities include electric power, heating, and air conditioning, and
telecommunications. Disturbances in such facilities or performance degradation would
adversely affect the operation of the system or may cause data corruption.
The design should consider the following three primary requirements in terms of security:
Unauthorized disclosure leading to a confidentiality breach
Loss of control over integrity of the information
Interruptions as well as physical damage that could affect availability
Also, one of the most important threats that needs to be considered for physical security is 
theft that could affect all the three.
Physical and operations security controls
Security controls that pertain to physical and operations are predominantly in the
authentication and authorization processes. Unauthorized intrusions are a common threat
in this domain. The following sections provide some of the common security threats,
vulnerabilities, and countermeasures in this domain.
Threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures for
physical and operations security
We have seen the concept of threats and vulnerabilities in various security domains in the
earlier chapters. Though the threats are predominantly common across most of the security
domains, the vulnerabilities they could exploit will vary, and the countermeasures are
generally unique. Some of the threats and vulnerabilities that could exploit the
infrastructure (infrastructure includes IT infrastructure as well) and its associated
components are listed here.
Common threats
Some of the common threats to physical environment are as follows:
Theft
Heat and temperature

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 236 ]
Humidity
Organic materials and chemicals that are in gaseous or liquid form
Organisms such as microbes
Missiles or bombs that are used as projectiles
Natural calamities such as earthquake, flood, and so on
Electrical power disruptions that includes electro-magnetic interference
Common vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities that the preceding threats could exploit but are not limited to include the
following:
Lack of physical entry controls and accountability
Lack of fire extinguishers or improper maintenance
Improper or poor cabling
Inappropriate chemicals used in the fire extinguishers for the protection of a
particular type of asset
Inappropriate storage of magnetic media
Weak access controls and intrusion detection systems
No backup or business continuity plans
Lack of power control systems
A deeper understanding of these threats and vulnerabilities are essential to do a thorough
risk assessment. It is also important to understand relevant specifications pertaining to
equipment's as well as physical security standards while designing countermeasures.
Designing physical and operations security
controls
Security controls and monitoring processes for physical and operations areas can be
subdivided into two main sections. One is related to a perimeter that is external to
boundaries, and the other pertains to an interior or operational area. In both these sections,
the following core controls need to be considered:
Preventative controls: These are designed to prevent a security event. For
example, having a high-raise wall will be a control to prevent intrusion.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 237 ]
A security event is an undesirable activity that could affect he
Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability of an information asset.
The following are some of the examples that are preventive physical
controls:
A high-rise wall
Fences
Locks
Detective controls: These controls are designed to detect an event before it could
damage the facilities. The following are some of the examples that are detective
physical controls:
Fire alarm
Intrusion detection systems such a motion and heat sensors
Surveillance monitors such as CCTV
Reactive controls: These controls are designed to react in a timely manner to a
security event, for example, armed response to an intrusion. The following are
some of the examples that are reactive physical controls:
Armed responses
Mantrap systems
Deterrent controls: These controls are designed to act as a deterrent against an
attempt to breach the security; for example, guards and dogs. The following are
some of the examples that are deterrent physical controls:
Guards
Dogs
Lighting
Perimeter security
Perimeter security relates to the security considerations pertaining to the boundaries. In
other words, securing the entry and exit points of the facility, networks, and so on, will fall
under perimeter security.
In physical and operations security domain, the following controls are applicable to 
perimeter security:

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 238 ]
Guards are a form of security control used to prevent, detect, deter,
and react to an intrusion event. They also act as a physical access
control to the facility. Their ability to adapt to situations is a major plus
to this type of security. The disadvantages are related to their
availability in hostile environments that do not support human
intervention, reliability, and cost.
Dogs are a type of security control used to prevent, detect, deter, and
react to an intrusion event. Their ability where a judgment is necessary
is, however, limited.
Fencing is an access control for perimeter security. High-rise walls,
gates, mantraps, and turnstiles are some of the examples for the same.
The following are some of the height requirements pertaining to
fencing:
3' to 4' high deters casual trespassers
6' to 7' high is too hard to climb easily
8' high with 3 strands of barbed wire deters most of the
intruders
A turnstile is a type of fencing that will allow only one person to pass
through it at a time and is also called a baffle gate. Similarly, a type of
vertical post called a bollard is used as a control to protect the facility from
vehicle intrusions.
Locks are preventative access control to perimeter security. Preset locks have
preset internal mechanisms, whereas programmable locks have dials that can be
programmed to contain digits, letters, or a combination of both.
Lighting is a deterrent control. The purpose of lighting is to discourage intruders
as well as detect suspicious movements. NIST standards specify an illumination
of 2 feet wide and 8 feet high for critical areas.
Closed circuit televisions (CCTV) are used to monitor live movements as well as
provide an audit trail during incident review. Heat sensors are also used to
monitor the facilities for detecting live movements.
Access control devices such as access cards control physical access to the facility.
Access cards can be categorized as photo cards, digitally encoded cards, as
well as wireless cards. When an access card combines with the physical
and logical access control as well as contains embedded integrated circuits
that can process information, then it is called a smart card.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 239 ]
Biometric devices use physical characteristics of a person to identify and provide
access to the facility. Some examples of it are fingerprint scanners, retina
scanning, and more.
Interior security
Interior security refers to the security considerations pertaining to the facilities that are
inside the perimeter. This will include equipment inside the data center and personnel
working in such facilities.
One of the most important aspects of interior security is the threats posed by unauthorized
intrusions, fire, electrical power, and Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (HVAC).
Unauthorized intrusions
Intrusions to the interior are controlled by motion detectors, mantraps, and more. Motion
detectors are used in interior security to detect suspicious movements. They raise an alarm
based on the type of motion detection technique used.
Mantrap systems are designed to stop and trap an intruder in between two entrances. Based
on the physical access control mechanisms, a mantrap gets activated on detection of
suspicious movement either automatically or manually.
Motion detectors
The wave pattern is a type of motion detector that would generate an alarm when the wave
pattern is disturbed. There are three types of sensors used in wave pattern motion detectors.
They are passive infrared, ultrasonic, and microwave sensors.
When an electric field is used around an object being monitored and the field gets charged
to raise an alarm, then it is called a capacitance-based motion detector.
Audio detectors are a type of motion detector that passively listen to abnormal sounds to
detect motion.
Fire
Fire is a threat that could damage the physical assets, such as computers, networks, as well
as the data center.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 240 ]
Fire spreads through combustible materials. While fire extinguishers or suppression agents
are used to contain the rapid spread of fire, a professional has to be cautious about the type
of extinguishing material used.
Fire classes
For fire to catch and spread, a combustible material is required. Based on the type of
combustible material, fire is classified into four classes.
National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) provides the following specifications
pertaining to the fire classes based on the type of the combustible material; it also classifies
them based on suppression mediums:
Class A combustible materials are wood, paper, cloth, rubber. Most of the plastics
also fall into this class.
Class B combustible materials are oils, greases, oil-based paints, lacquers, and
flammable liquids and gases.
Class C is predominantly electrical equipment that is energized.
Class D refers to flammable chemicals, such as magnesium and sodium.
Fire detectors
Fire detectors are controls for detecting and responding to heat, flames, or smoke.
Depending upon the type of detection, they can be classified as heat, flame, or smoke
sensors.
Fire suppression mediums
Fire suppression is critical to protect lives, operational systems, and the data center. Using a
suitable or applicable fire suppression medium is important if you want to have effective
protection:
Water, soda acid, CO
2, and Halon are some of the fire suppression mediums
Portable fire extinguishers predominantly use Carbon Dioxide (CO
2) or soda
acid
Halon is a suppressing medium that is no longer allowed to be used, as it is
designated as an ozone depleting substance

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 241 ]
Water sprinklers
Fire extinguishers use either water sprinkler or gas dischargers to suppress fire.
Water sprinklers are of four types. They are Wet pipe, Dry pipe, Deluge, and Preaction:
Wet pipe sprinkling systems always contain water and the valve opens when the
heat rises above 165°F
In Dry pipe sprinkling systems, water flows from the outer valve when the heat
rises above the threshold level
Deluge sprinkler systems are used to discharge large volumes of water
Preaction combines wet as well as dry pipe systems such that the water flow is
controlled
Gas dischargers
Gas discharge systems use CO
2 or Halon instead of water and are usually used under the
raised floor of the data centers. However, CO
2 can be used only in an unattended data
center as it will have a harmful effect on humans.
Electrical power
Clean electrical power is a requirement for proper equipment functioning. If the power is
not clean, then it will result in spoiling or damaging the equipment. This may lead to the
malfunctioning of devices, leading to unavailability and the corruption of data.
The following are some of the most important terms that are related to electrical power that
could affect equipment:
When the power fluctuates due to interference, the effect is called noise.
When there is a charge difference between neutral, hot, and ground electrical
wires, it results in Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). This interference is
caused by electromagnetic waves.
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is caused by radio waves generated by the
electrical system components such as cables, florescent lights, and so on.
The following definitions are related to electrical power that a candidate should be
thorough with:

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 242 ]
When there is a momentary power loss, it is called a Fault
If the power loss is complete, then it is called a Blackout
When there is a momentary low voltage, it is called a Sag
When the voltage is low for a prolonged period of time, it is called a Brownout
When the voltage is temporarily high, then it is called a Spike
If the voltage is high for a prolonged period of time, then it is called a Surge
When the incoming power at the beginning is high, then it is called a Inrush
When there is a steady interference, it is called a Noise
When the interference is of short duration, it is called a Transient
When the power is non-fluctuating, then it is called a Clean
Humidity is the percentage of water vapor present in the air. For proper functioning of the
computer systems, the humidity levels should be between 40 and 60 percent. If the
humidity is low, then due to dryness, static electricity would set in. If the humidity is high,
then due to wetness, some of the components would rust.
Operations/facility security
Facility security concerns the management of facility controls. Some of the important
controls that need attention are auditing and emergency procedures.
Auditing
Auditing is a process to check and validate the effectiveness of controls. The primary tool
that assists in the audit is an audit trial. In physical and operational security domains,
auditing is primarily done from the scope of physical access controls and operational
procedures. The focus of the audit is to ascertain that the threats and vulnerabilities to
physical access are identified, suitable mitigation to the risks is being implemented, and the
effectiveness of physical access controls is ascertained.
While doing audits with the scope of physical security of information systems, the
following points need to be considered:
The physical location of the information systems is a primary factor.
Environmental factors, such as proximity to toxic chemical installations and
locations that are in the seismic zone and close to seashore, should be avoided at
best.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 243 ]
Seismic zones are regions where earthquakes are known to occur.
Adherence to HVAC specifications for server and network equipment, their
proper functioning, and maintenance. It is better not to have windows in the data
center, and the doors are designed to maintain positive air pressure.
Positive air pressure implies that the air flows out of the room when the
door is opened.
The usage of raised floors in data centers and all the cables and ducts are run
under the raised floors.
Based on various specifications, a raised data center floor can be anywhere
between 300 mm to 800 mm, depending upon the floor area
It is important to check the adequacy of access control mechanisms. The usage of
smart cards, proximity cards, biometric sensors, and mantrap systems for data
center access control should be encouraged. An audit trail has to be established
for auditing the use of credentials.
A periodic vetting of personnel working in critical installations such as data
centers.
Access controls to support infrastructure such as telecommunication rooms,
power control rooms housing UPS, and batteries.
Fire detection and suppression controls based on the recommended
specifications.
An adequacy of lighting and emergency lighting.
An adequacy of water, temperature, and humidity sensors along with their alarm
functions.
Avoiding obvious sign boards and directions to critical installations.
Insurance coverage.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 244 ]
Audit trail
An audit trail contains all the recorded events. The events may be security related or
general activities. One of the most important audit trails in physical and operational
security domains is the access details to the data center and other control rooms. The access
details should contain the access attempts, the result such as success or failure, as well as
the location accessed.
The record of access events is stored in a file called logs. An access log contains the events
that are related to access attempts, and error logs contain the exceptions.
Generally, access logs contain event-related details, such as the date and time of the access
attempt, the result of the access attempt in terms of success or failure, the location where the
access was granted, the person who was authorized, and the modifications to the access
privileges.
Emergency procedures
Physical security also deals with procedures that need to be followed during emergencies.
An emergency is an undesired event that may disturb operations for a prolonged period of
time. The impact of an emergency event could be devastating in terms of human loss,
facility loss, connectivity disturbances, and equipment and data loss. Proper procedures
need to be developed; personnel are trained on such procedures and are periodically tested
for effectiveness and continued usability.
The upcoming sections deal with emergency procedures that an information security
professional should be aware of.
Startup and shutdown procedures
During an emergency, the IT systems may be shutdown intentionally or automatically and
may be required to be relocated to a different site. Similarly, data maybe moved to a
different system at a remote site. System startup and shutdown procedures lay down
guidelines and activities that need to be performed in a way that security could not be
compromised during system/data migration or relocation. These procedures should include
emergency procedures to address the requirements when a disaster strikes. Some of the
startup and shutdown procedures include the following:
Checking all the cables before startup to ensure that they are not loose
Checking that the power strip is turned on and the power plug is tightly placed

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 245 ]
Checking that the peripheral devices are properly connected and powered on as
per procedures
Booting the systems to a single user or a multi-user mode as per security
requirements
Activating network connections in either manual or automatic mode based on
security requirements
Ensuring that the system shuts down completely during system halt
Avoiding the physical reset of the operating system
Ensuring that all the programs are closed before shutdown
In case of unplanned or unexpected shutdown, ensuring that the system is
restarted in diagnostic mode, so that any data corruption is checked before
loading the operating system
Evacuation procedures
Evacuation procedures address the priorities in terms of evacuating assets from the disaster
site and properly handling such assets. The following points should be considered while
developing and testing evacuation procedures.
Personnel are the first to be secured during an emergency or disaster. It is important that
evacuation procedures should address a secure evacuation of personnel first:
Emergency exits are clearly marked and should lead to an open space
A floor plan with a clear marking of emergency locations and indicating the
current location should be available in all the strategic locations
Emergency lights should be installed at strategic locations throughout the facility
A clearly marked assembly area has to be set up, and the personnel should be
advised to assemble and remain in the assembly area during evacuation
Automatic shutdown of equipment, such as air conditioners during a fire alarm,
should be considered
Equipment such as fire extinguishers should be available at strategic locations
The maintenance of fire extinguishers must be up to date
Trained personnel designated as a warden or a supervisor who should direct and
control emergency procedures should be available
The roles and responsibilities of building wardens or supervisors and other sub
wardens should be clearly defined, and their action plans including coordination
should be documented clearly

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 246 ]
Identification mechanisms such as different colored helmets or coats for
identifying relevant support personnel should be used
Training and awareness
Training and awareness plays an important role during emergencies. Most importantly, the
personnel need to be aware of the emergency procedures. To achieve this, organizations
should conduct periodical mock tests to ensure that the activities that need to be performed
during an emergency or disaster are rehearsed and any kind of deviation is documented.
These mock tests allow the security planners to fine-tune the emergency procedures and
that percolates into the training activities. Periodical mock tests are also called evacuation
drills.
The following points should be covered in training, awareness programs, and evacuation
drills:
Evacuation drills should be periodically conducted
The success and failure of such drills should be properly documented, and the
lessons learned from such exercises should be updated in the emergency
procedures and training manuals
An explanation of different alarm types should be given
An explanation of different identification mechanisms for support personnel
should be given
Actions to be taken by personnel when the alarm signals
The location of assembly points
Security procedures to be followed if moving computer equipment
Protecting and securing equipment
Physical security also concerns with the physical protection of equipment as well
addressing various security requirements pertaining to the media where the data is stored.
Theft is one of the most important threats that needs to be addressed for personal computer,
laptop, and media protection.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 247 ]
Equipment security
Equipment security involves protection from theft and unauthorized access. Some of the
controls include the following:
Cable locks are used to physically secure PCs and laptop computers. These locks
prevent the computers or laptops from being detached and taken away.
Encryption is used to make folders and files secure such that unauthorized
disclosure and modification is prevented.
Full disk encryption is used to encrypt the data in laptops. This is to ensure that
even if the laptop is lost, the content is not disclosed. This method is also used to
ensure that the system is not compromised using a technique called cold boot
attack.
Cold boot attack is used to retrieve the information such as password or
encryption keys from the DRAM memories even after the power is
removed. This is due to the data-remanence property of DRAM memories.
Modern technologies include a security token to control access to laptops as well as remote
laptop-security mechanisms that enable the owner to remotely access and disable the laptop
over the Internet.
Port protection is used to ensure that media devices, such as CD-ROM, floppy drive, 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) memory sticks, Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi) ports, and printers
and scanners, are not accessible to unauthorized personnel. The purpose of port protection
is to prevent downloading or transferring confidential information and/or intellectual
property by unauthorized users to a portable medium. Port protection also assists in
preventing the spread of malware.
BIOS checks use password protection during the boot up process so that the access to the
operating system is controlled. These checks are called pre-boot authentication.
Computer hardware equipment is prone to failure due to various factors such as vibration,
electrical fluctuation, electromagnetic interference, and so on. For critical systems such as
servers, high availability is a primary requirement.
There are two important parameters used in the IT industry to qualify server grade
equipment:
One is Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), which is a time measurement that
specifies the average time between failures. This time is called the useful life of
the device.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 248 ]
The other parameter is Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), which indicates the
downtime or the average time required to repair the device after a failure.
Media security
Storage media such as hard disks, backup tapes, CDs/DVDs, and diskettes need additional
security measures to ensure the security of the data they contain. The controls should
ensure to prevent data disclosure and modification by unauthorized entities.
The following controls need to be considered for media security:
Storage controls are the primary means to protect the data in storage media such
as hard disk, magnetic tapes, CDs, and so on. The primary consideration should
be controlling access to the data, which is usually achieved by encryption.
Additional security considerations are required when backup media is stored off
the site.
Maintenance is a regular process to ensure that the data in the storage media is
not corrupted or damaged. Media handling procedures are used to ensure this.
The users and operators should be provided with the proper usage instructions
to handle the media.
Media usage should be in accordance with the established policies and
procedures.
Data destruction is done by way of formatting the media. One-time formatting
may not completely delete all the data. Degaussing is an effective method of
destroying the data in magnetic media.
Data remanence is the residual data that remains when the data is not completely
erased or destroyed. When the media is reused, this may result in unauthorized
disclosure of sensitive information. It is a good practice to prevent media reuse
by physically destroying the media. In case of reuse, there should be policies and
procedures to ensure that the data is destroyed.
Computer investigations
Computer investigations are also called computer forensics. This process deals with
collecting, preserving, and producing the evidence that pertains to computer crimes.
Evidence must be handled to ensure it is admissible in a court of law.

Day 16 – Security Operations - Foundational Concepts
[ 249 ]
Evidence in computer investigations is a piece of information that supports a conclusion.
From the legal perspective, evidence maybe oral or written statements, physical objects,
computer files, computer data, or other documentary material that is admissible in a court
of law.
Most of the evidence pertaining to computer crimes is intangible in nature. It maybe stored
in a magnetic medium, such as tape, disk drive, or in memory. Information such as location,
time, discovery, securing, controlling, and the maintenance of the evidence needs to be
followed. This activity is called chain of evidence.
The cycle of activities from discovery of evidence to preservation, transportation, admission
in the court, and to return to the owner is called the evidence life cycle.
Summary
This chapter covered physical security design and some of the common threats,
vulnerabilities, and the related countermeasures pertaining to the physical and operational
security domains. The focus of coverage was to understand different controls, such as
preventive, detective, reactive, and deterrent, that are applicable to the physical and
operational security domains, along with a few examples associated with each of them.

Incident Management and
Disaster Recovery
This chapter covers incident management and disaster recovery concepts from the
perspective of physical and operational security domains. Concepts related to incident
management controls, business continuity planning process, and disaster recovery planning
are covered with relevant examples and illustrations:
Observe the preceding diagram. Incidents may cause disruption to business processes and
activities. In turn, an unattended incident may also lead to disaster. A suitable business
continuity planning process with disaster recovery planning will ensure continuity in
business operations.
In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:
Foundational concepts on incident management
Preventative measures
Patch and vulnerability management

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 253 ]
Change management principles
Disaster recovery and business continuity exercises
Incident management and reporting
An incident is an event that could possibly violate information security. The violation may
breach confidentiality, integrity, and the availability requirements of information assets.
Primarily, incidents happen due to weaknesses in the systems and operational processes
and procedures.
When a systematic and procedural way of managing incidents is established in an
organization, then it is called incident management.
Incident management consists of incident reporting and response to such reports.
Incident reporting refers to the mechanism of reporting suspected weaknesses and
incidents to the management by employees, contractors, and third-party users.
The examples of incidents
The following are some of the examples of incidents:
Access violation is a type of incident where an unauthorized entity either tries to
gain access to the system and/or successfully gains access.
The malfunction of hardware and software could possibly affect the availability
of the systems. It is also possible that data could be corrupted, compromising
integrity.
Human errors such as wrong inputs to the system, improper configuration, and
the violation of established procedures could compromise security.
Uncontrolled system changes could affect system security in a manner that
prevents the system from being restored to its previous secure state, and/or the
other users of the system are unaware of the changes.
Noncompliance with policies and procedures is an incident that could
compromise the established secure practices.
A physical security breach is an incident that could compromise information
security controls.

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 254 ]
Incident management objective and goals
The objective of information security incident management is to manage incidents in an
effective manner to mitigate the risks by timely actions.
The goals of incident management are as follows:
Establishing, implementing, and maintaining suitable procedures for reporting
information security-related incidents and weaknesses by employees, third-party
contractors, and outsourced entities
Establishing, implementing, and maintaining escalation procedures related to
information security incidents
Establishing the designated points of contact for reporting information security
incidents and weaknesses
Periodically conducting awareness programs for employees, third-party
contractors, and outsourced service providers about information security
incidents, weaknesses, and reporting procedures
Ensuring that the reported incidents are properly dealt with and corrective
actions are taken
Establishing procedures to percolate the lessons learned from incidents into the
awareness programs and management procedures
Incident management controls
Incident management involves actions that are predominantly corrective in nature. For
example, fire fighting is a corrective exercise. However, certain preventive actions are taken
to control the onset of an incident. The following are some of the security controls, systems,
and actions that can help in managing incidents.
Intrusion detection systems
As this name implies, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are detective controls that detect 
unauthorized intrusions to the premises, such as data centers or computer networks.
Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
In physical, operational, and network security, vulnerability assessment and penetration
testing are periodically conducted to identify the weaknesses in the access control
mechanisms and test the possibility of unauthorized intrusion.

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 255 ]
Patch management
Computer applications contain vulnerabilities, in other words, errors. These applications
are generally executable files and are produced by different software vendors. The 
vulnerabilities that are identified after the final release of such applications are periodically
fixed by these vendors by releasing software code containing the patches. Patch
management refers to applying patches to the existing applications or the patching of
computers in a systematic way. Applying the patches to the test system before applying
them to production systems, and  creating rollback mechanisms if the applied patch affects
the existing applications are considered to be patch management controls. Patch
management has to be validated as a part of the compliance-monitoring activity.
Configuration management
An improper configuration of IT systems may lead to systems compromise, affecting the
confidentiality and integrity of the systems. Configuration errors will also affect the
availability. Configuration management refers to maintaining the right configuration of
systems and documenting and managing the changes to the systems.
Business Continuity Planning (BCP)
From the operations security perspective, BCP is to ensure that the continuity of IT
operations is maintained from the primary or alternate locations during an incident or
disastrous events based on the business continuity requirements. An important
consideration is that the security levels are maintained during such operations.
Before we plunge deeper into the myriad concepts of the BCP domain, let's recap some of
important concepts in the risk assessment and risk management areas:
Risk is the probability that a threat agent could exploit vulnerability and the
resulting impact. The impact may be related to the loss of money, resources,
customer confidence, reputation, or legal and regulatory noncompliance and
related issues.
Threat is an event that could affect business operations.
Vulnerability is a weakness in the system that a threat could exploit.

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 256 ]
In the BCP domain, our focus will be on specific threat events that could cause devastating
impacts on the functioning of the organization as a whole, and the IT infrastructure in
particular. The examples of such events are fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, or terrorist
attacks. Generally, an organization may not have controls to prevent such events. Such
events are termed as disruptive events. In other words, an event that could impact regular
operations for a prolonged period of time can be termed as a disruptive event.
Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is a process that proactively addresses the
continuation of business operations during and in the aftermath of such disruptive events.
The aim is to prevent interruptions to operations.
BCP goals and objectives
BCP requires coordinated efforts by a team of personnel drawn from different business
functions of an organization. Let's quickly review the goal and objectives pertaining to the
BCP process.
The goal of BCP is to ensure the continuity of business operations without affecting the
organization as a whole.
While designing the BCP, availability should be considered as the most important factor.
People are the most important assets in business operations. Hence, life safety or preventing
human loss is one of the primary objectives of BCP. Another important objective of BCP is
to avoid any serious damage to the business.
BCP process
BCP involves the following steps. These simplified steps form a life cycle model for the BCP
process:

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 257 ]
Scoping should be thought of in terms of assets, operations, and business
1.
processes.
Scoping is a very important activity in a BCP process. The scope of a
BCP primarily focuses on a business process. For example, if the scope
of BCP is Customer Relationship Management (CRM) processes, then
we're looking at the CRM-related information systems: data, people
associated with customer management, and facilities such as the servers,
data center, backup media, and so on. By focusing on a business process
and defining the scope, we will be able to see an end-to-end link of all
the associated assets, operations, and processes. Therefore, the primary
criterion of BCP scoping is to ensure that it is appropriate, which means
ensuring that the scoping process covers all the essential resources.
Initiating the planning process.
2.
The Business Continuity Planning process is initiated by establishing the
roles and responsibilities of personnel involved. Generally, a BCP
committee is formed with personnel drawn from critical business units.
The function of a BCP committee is to create, test, and implement the
plans. The critical component in planning this process is the support and
involvement of senior management throughout the process, life cycle.
Performing Business Impact Analysis (BIA).
3.
BIA is a type of risk assessment exercise that tries to assess qualitative
and quantitative impacts on the business due to a disruptive event.
Qualitative impacts are generally operational impacts such as inability
to deliver, whereas quantitative impacts are related to financial losses. In
general, BIA uses What-If scenarios to assess the risks. For example, take
a look at the following:
What will be the financial loss if CRM server is down for 4 hours?
What will be the operational issues if the system administrator is not
available during an emergency update of the system?
What will be the legal ramifications if the customer data is corrupted or
stolen? A matrix of What-If is created and analyzed to develop suitable
mitigation strategies for the risks. In BCP terminology, such a risk
mitigation strategy is called a continuity plan.

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 258 ]
Developing the BCP.
4.
Business Continuity Plans are proactive measures that identify critical
business processes required for the continuity and sustainability of the
business based on BIA. For example, let's assume if the organization has
a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with its customers and a maximum of
2 hours of continuous downtime of its CRM services, then continuity
plans need to address the systems that are needed to ensure an
adherence to the SLA proactively. The organization needs a strategy or
plan, and the same should be consistent across all business units.
Defining the continuity strategy and documenting the same are two
important functions that constitute the development of BC plans.
BC plan implementation, testing the plans, and creating awareness to the
5.
personnel.
The senior management must approve the properly documented
business continuity plans and, upon approval, the plans are
implemented. Personnel associated with business continuity strategy
and operations must be made aware of the continuity processes; the
plans have to be periodically tested and updated based on the lessons
learned from such tests.
The BC plan maintenance.
6.
The BCP life cycle also includes the maintenance of the plans. The
primary driver for plan update is based on incidents, periodic risk
assessments, and changes to the business environment. The plans need
to be periodically reviewed and updated based on business changes,
technology changes, and/or policy changes.
BCP best practices
The following best practices are gleaned from many BCP-related standards and guidelines.
They form the base for a successful BC Planning process.
BCP should be as follows:
Appropriate: The scoping process should be covering the essential resources
Adequate: Based on Business Impact Analysis, the adequacy of available
resources pertaining to continuity and recovery should be established

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 259 ]
Complete: The plan should include all the resources required based on the
analysis
BCP resources should include the following:
An availability of processes
An availability of people to implement the processes
BCP processes should include the following:
Testing the plans
Day-to-day functions/activities to be performed to make the plan effective and
ready at all times
BCP measures should include the following:
Preventative measures to control known issues
Facilitating measures to act in a timely manner on issues that are reasonably not
under the control of the organization
BCP should identify the following:
Mission-critical systems
Business impact due to nonavailability of critical systems (loss of revenue, loss of
profits, inability to comply with laws, damage to reputation, and so on)
Preventive controls
Recovery controls
BCP objectives include the following:
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): This is a timeframe within which the systems
should be recovered (indicated in terms of hours or days)
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): This is the maximum period of time (or
amount of transaction data) that the business can afford to lose during a
successful recovery
BCP procedures include the following:
Procedure for testing the plans
Procedure for updating the plans

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 260 ]
BCP plans should contain the following:
Notification: To whom and, in case the concerned personnel is not available, who
holds the secondary responsibility.
Call trees: The list of personnel associated with continuity operations and their
contact details.
Response teams: Who should respond during a disruptive event? For example,
an event such as fire requires trained teams to handle evacuation and other
specific procedures.
Updating mechanism for contacts.
A step-by-step procedure for recovery.
Appropriate testing.
Restoring a primary site to normalcy or a stable state.
Required records and the format of the same.
The awareness of people.
Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)
Disaster recovery is a process that enables the business to recover from an event that affects
the normal business operations for a prolonged period of time.
At this point, I would like to highlight the similarities and differences between BCP and
DRP processes:
Both BCP and DRP are targeted at continuity or the resumption of business
processes, as the case may be.
Both the processes address the actions to be taken when an incident happens or a
disruptive event strikes.
BCP focuses on the continuity of business processes. For example, power failure
is an incident. It is not a disastrous event. BCP will address this using continuity
processes such as an Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) system or a power
generator. However, BCP focuses on the continuity of the business processes
from the holistic perspective of the business itself.
DRP focuses on recovery procedures due to disastrous events. For example,
earthquake strikes the location. This is not the same situation as a power failure.
Even having a UPS or a generator is not going to be helpful. DRP will address
this by resuming the critical business processes from an alternative site.

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 261 ]
Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP) is a process for the following:
Developing procedures that define the actions to be taken during and after
1.
disastrous event.
Testing the procedure for effectiveness.
2.
Updating the procedures to reflect the lessons learned from the testing process.
3.
Goals and objectives
The goal of disaster recovery planning is to effectively manage the operations during
disaster and ensure a proper coordination of different teams.
The objective of disaster recovery planning is to continue the business/IT operations in a
secondary site during disaster and restore back to the primary site in a timely manner.
Components of disaster recovery planning
Some of the components of disaster recovery include these:
The identification of suitable teams to coordinate the recovery process
The resumption of business from alternate sites or recovering data from a backup
Communications with employees, external groups, and media
Financial management including insurance
Recovery teams
In disaster recovery, various teams play important roles. The most important teams are as
follows:
The recovery team: On the declaration of a disaster, this team is entrusted with
implementing the recovery procedures
The salvage team: This team will be responsible for returning business
operations to the primary site

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 262 ]
Recovery sites
A primary site is the one where normal business operations, including IT operations, take
place.
A secondary site is referred to as a backup to the primary site. Generally, secondary sites
are geographically located in a different region.
Business resumption from alternative sites
The following are some of the disaster-recovery activities that are related to continuing
business from an alternative site.
A reciprocal agreement
A reciprocal agreement is an arrangement with another company having additional
computing facilities that can be utilized during contingency. The term reciprocal implies
that it is a mutual agreement that both the companies may utilize the computing facilities of
the other in the event of a disaster. However, such agreements are not legally binding, as it
is a simple arrangement.
Subscription services
This means paying or subscribing to facility management services that use third-party
backups and processing facilities. This type of arrangement is called a subscription service:
A type of subscription that services a company may be contracted based
on the Business Impact Analysis (BIA), Recovery Time Objectives
(RTO), and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO).
BIA, RTO and RPO are explained in the previous chapter.
A hot site is an alternate backup site that is fully configured with computer
systems, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and power
supply. This site also contains all the applications as well as the data to
commence the operations immediately. Hot sites are highly expensive. Typically,
a business operation that needs to be resumed within 24 hours would consider a
hot site.

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 263 ]
A cold site contains no computer or other computing equipment. Only HVAC
and power are available here. The computers, the computing equipment,
applications, and data need to be installed before commencing the operations.
Cold sites are the least expensive. Typically, a business operation that can be
resumed in a span of a week to 10 days would consider this option.
A warm site is in between hot and cold sites. In this type of arrangement, the
computing facilities such as computers, other communication elements, HVAC,
and power are available. However, applications and data need to be installed
before commencing the operations. This type of site is less expensive than a hot
site. Typically, a business operation that needs to be restored within a span of 24
hours to 96 hours would consider this option.
Dual sites refer to mirroring the exact operations and data in alternative sites.
From the recovery perspective, this type of sit is instantaneous in business
resumption. However, they are very expensive to maintain. Typically, business
operations that cannot afford any downtime at all would consider this option.
Backup terminologies
The following concepts are applicable to hot sites and dual sites in terms of backup and
restorations:
Electronic vaulting is a batch process used to dump the data at periodical
intervals to a remote backup system.
Remote journaling is a parallel processing system that writes the data in a
remote system at the alternate site. This type of backup is used where the RTO is
less and a high degree of fault tolerance is required.
Database shadowing is used to duplicate the data into multiple sites from the
remote journaling process. This type of system is used where the fault-tolerance
requirement is of the highest degree.
Testing procedures
Disaster recovery plans should include various testing procedures so that the plans can be
tested for adequacy and correctness. The lessons learned from such tests can be
incorporated into the plans for better preparedness during a disaster.
The following are some of the industry standard tests pertaining to disaster recovery
planning processes:

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 264 ]
A checklist review is a review process for checking the disaster recovery plan by
managers of various business units. The following table shows a general
checklist. This list is at the macro level. Further lists should be generated at micro
level to drill down to finer details:
A structured walk-through is a tabletop exercise in which a management team
of various business units meets and reviews each and every step in a sequential
manner. Any deficiencies or missing steps are discussed and updated in the plan.
While a checklist review is used to check the availability of the resources such as
documents, systems, people, communication facilities, backup, and more, the
structured walk-through checks the recovery processes step by step over a
tabletop review.
A simulation test is a testing process used to simulate the event in a testing
environment. This test is expected to provide vital inputs from the actions of
various response teams, and any deficiency can be corrected, including the
training requirements. This type of test is also called a walk-through test or drill.
A simulation test is more comprehensive than a tabletop exercise.

Day 17 – Security Operations - Incident Management and Disaster Recovery
[ 265 ]
A parallel test is a testing process used to test the coordination of other essential
groups such as medical, fire services including internal teams, and the adherence
to communication procedures. This type of test is used for testing the
functionality of the plans. Hence, it is referred to as a functional drill.
A full test is a type of test that tries to simulate a real emergency or a disaster
event. This test involves the participation of all the associated teams and groups
as well as a real shutdown of the primary site, and the commencement of
operations from the remote site.
Summary

An overview of software development
security
Software is a core building block in an IT infrastructure. Applications are the outcome of 
software development, and they are most important from the perspective of security, as
they deal with data.
Applications provide a way to achieve tasks that are related to the input, processing, and
the output of data. Besides this, applications are used to store, retrieve, process, transmit, or
destroy data. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to ensure the security of
applications:
Observe the preceding diagram. The primary area that a security professional should focus
on is the addressing of security requirements at the design stage of the application itself. An
application contains software code, and it is important that secure coding practices are used
throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) processes.

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 270 ]
In this module, you will learn about the following:
Systems engineering concepts
Security in the software development life cycle
Software development life cycle models
An overview of enforcing security controls in development environments
Systems engineering
Systems engineering is a term that connotes the application of engineering concepts while
designing application systems that are complex and large.
A system may be defined as the combination of elements or parts that work together to
produce an output. In other words, systems are used to achieve an objective. In a system,
parts or elements are interrelated.
Many organizations in the world publish standards, models, principles, and practices
pertaining to systems engineering. One of them is the International Council on Systems
Engineering (INCOSE), which is a not-for-profit membership organization, founded to
develop and disseminate the interdisciplinary principles and practices that enable the
realization of successful systems. Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon
University develops and maintains a Capability Maturity Model (CMM) pertaining to
software development process maturity.
According to INCOSE, Systems Engineering is an interdisciplinary approach and means to enable
the realization of successful systems. It focuses on defining customer needs and the required
functionality early in the development cycle, documenting requirements, then proceeding with design
synthesis and system validation while considering the complete problem.
When a system is developed using the system engineering processes, then development
activities go through a life cycle model and are called System Development Life Cycle
(SDLC). Software development is an activity in system development life cycle models.
A system development life cycle model consists of many processes. It starts from
establishing the needs (initiation) and runs to archiving or destruction (disposal).
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) special publication 800-14 titled
Generally Accepted Principles and Practices for Securing Information Technology (IT)
Systems defines five phases in terms of the system development life cycle.

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 271 ]
The following diagram illustrates the five phases of the System Development Life Cycle as
defined in the NIST 800-14:
System Development Life Cycle
Initiation phase
The initiation phase establishes the need for the system and creation of the associated
documentation. It is necessary to conduct a sensitive assessment at this phase, and the scope
of the assessment is to look at the sensitivity of the information to be processed as well as
the sensitivity of the system itself. Sensitive assessment establishes the data protection
needs in the developed or acquired system.
Development/acquisition phase
The second phase is the development/acquisition phase. During this phase, a system is 
designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed. This phase
requires three activities to be performed:
Determining security requirements
Incorporating security requirements into specifications
Obtaining the system and related security activities
Implementation phase
The third phase is the implementation phase. This phase emphasizes the testing and
installation of the systems. There are very few primary requirements in this phase
pertaining to security:

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 272 ]
Installing and/or turning-on controls, such that security features are enabled and
configured
Performing security testing on some particular parts of the system that are
developed or acquired
Security testing the entire system
Obtaining system security accreditation
Operation/maintenance phase
The fourth phase is the operation/maintenance phase. In this phase the system is 
operational and performs its work. In this phase, the system may be modified or upgraded
based on the requirements.
Some of the important security considerations in this phase are as follows:
Security operations
Security administration
Operational assurance
Monitoring
Auditing
Disposal phase
The final phase in the system development life cycle is the disposal phase. This phase
involves the disposition of information, hardware, and software.
Some of the security considerations in this phase areas follows:
Archiving and retrieval
Media sanitization
Software development life cycle
Software development is a part of the systems development life cycle. Within the
development phase, there are many stages and processes. The activity or cycle starts from a
specification development based on which the overall system is designed and implemented.

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 273 ]
The software programs are written based on the system design, the system is documented
and the operating procedures are written too.
During the entire process of the software development life cycle, other activities are
involved to ensure the functionality of the developed application. Verification and
validation are the two important activities during development and implementation.
Verification is used to establish the adherence to software specifications, whereas
validation is used to establish the fitness of the system as outlined in the design and
requirements.
Software development models
Life cycle models are used for software development purposes. The objectives of such
models are to develop quality software applications or products that meet specifications,
customer requirements, and financial viability in terms of budgets and timelines.
Simplistic model
A simplistic model is the one that takes an approach of sequential stages in software
development. In this model, the concept of rework does not arise, and it assumes that each
and every stage of development is finalized before moving to the next stage. One of the
popular models in simplistic software development is the waterfall model.
Waterfall model
The waterfall model is a type of simplistic model where the development flows like water
falling from top to bottom through a series of steps. In this model, activities such as
requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, integration, and maintenance are
completed in a sequence. This model's top-down only approach will have difficulty when a
rework has to be done on the system design or the software application:

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 274 ]
Waterfall model
Complex models
Software development models are considered to be complex when the scope or
requirements are uncertain during the initiation of the project. A complex model expects
that the scope, requirements, or specifications may change during the development phase.
Hence, such models have to be accommodating to include the changes, and development
processes should have robust change management processes and strong integration
methods. One of the popular methods that is considered to be following a complex model is
an agile framework.
When a software development life cycle model uses iterative methods and processes, then
such models are called iterative models. In such models, reworking is allowed to improve
the systems. Some of the examples of this model include an incremental model and a spiral
model.

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 275 ]
Incremental model
This model allows the segregation of software development processes into multiple builds
or modules. An incremental model can, in a way, be visualized as similar to a multiple
waterfall model with each build following its own set of processes. Some of the advantages
of such models include flexibility, smaller iterations, and parallel development.
Disadvantages include a higher cost than simplistic models, and complete scope and design
should be ready before the development:
The incremental model
Spiral model
The spiral model is a type of iterative model. This model specifies design as well as
prototyping stages. This model proposes top-down as well as bottom-up approaches so that
rework is possible:

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 276 ]
Agile framework
This framework emphasizes the concept of iterations throughout the software development
life cycle. An Agile method can use incremental models. However, the development model
is considered to be Agile when it adheres to the Agile manifesto that was published in the
year 2001 by a consortium of software developers.
The agile manifesto envisages individuals such as software programmers and their
interactions, working software (for example beta versions) instead of only documentation,
customer or stakeholder involvement throughout the development, and continuous
development that includes quick response to changes.
One of the popular agile programming methods is called Extreme Programming (XP).
There are two core objectives of such programming. One is producing high-quality
software, and the other is productivity enhancements. Extreme programming generally has
multiple short development cycles. Agile development methods are considered to be more
suitable from the perspective of security.

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 277 ]
Security in software development
In software development, secure processes are required during development to produce a
secure software. Therefore, security during development stages and the security of the
developed software are interrelated and necessary for overall security.
Security controls in software development
The software development process follows the cycle of design, development, testing, and
integration. Security controls are necessary in all these stages. The following sections
describe some of the best practices pertaining to the security controls in software
development.
Separation of development, test, and operational
facilities
In order to prevent inappropriate developer access to production systems, controlled access
to operational systems for developers and testers should be implemented. Hence, to prevent
unintended operational system changes, the separation of development, test, and
operational facilities should be implemented.
Change control processes and procedures
Formal change control processes and procedures are necessary to ensure that the changes in
development processes and implementation are done in a controlled manner. This is to
prevent the corruption of data or programming. Change control processes should take into
account and follow documentation, specification, testing, quality control, and controlled
implementations.
Whenever there is a change in the system or application, performing risk assessment on the
impact of the proposed change is necessary. Establishing suitable security controls based on
the assessment is important for security.
Similarly, a version of the operating system may change after the application is deployed.
The porting of the application to other operating systems may also be planned after the
initial deployment in one operating system. In both scenarios, a technical review on the
security of the application software has to be done due to the operating system changes.
Primarily, integrity procedures should be reviewed.

Day 18 – Software Development Security - Security in Software Development Life Cycle
[ 278 ]
Any change control processes and procedures should take into account business continuity
requirements and include tests for the BCP.
Vendor-supplied software packages
Any changes to the vendor-supplied software by internal development personnel should be
avoided. If a change is necessary, it may either be done by the vendor, or it should be done
internally after obtaining  consent from the vendor. This is to ensure the validity of the
warranty. Similarly, any changes provided by the vendor to the software by way of patches
should be tested thoroughly in a test environment before updating to operational systems.
The tests should also contain rollback mechanisms in case of failure.
Avoiding covert channels
In a software application, covert channels may be introduced by developers with malicious
intent. A covert channel can provide a path for information leakage, circumventing security
controls. They may also have functions for evading monitoring controls. Hence, covert
channel analysis is necessary to ensure data confidentiality.
Summary
This chapter covered systems engineering concepts and various phases in the process.
Software development is in the development phase of a systems engineering process.
Software development follows life cycle models. When a development model follows
simple and sequential methods, then it is called a simplistic model, and where iterations are
allowed throughout the cycle, then such a model is called a complex model. Security in the
development, test, and operational implementations is critical to overall software security.
Some of the important security controls in development include change control procedures
and technical review for security.
In the next chapter, we will cover assurance requirements in the software and related
security testing procedures.

Day 19 – Software
Development Security -
Assessing effectiveness of
Software Security
This chapter covers methods to assess the effectiveness of security in software. Effectiveness
is used to ensure that the software has sufficient security controls, and these controls are
performing as expected. Software quality and effectiveness is based on assurance
requirements, and such requirements are based on performance and security. Hence,
parameters such as performance and security must be demonstrable. Monitoring activities
such as logging plays an important role in determining the performance and the security
control effectiveness of the software.

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 282 ]
Overview
Assurance in software means that software performance is as per the design and has
effective security controls available. Observe the following diagram:
In this module, you will understand the following:
Assurance requirements in software
Auditing and logging, risk analysis and mitigation, and acceptance testing
Security impact analysis on the acquired software
Security in information technology systems
Information technology systems can be broadly classified as follows:
Object-oriented systems
Artificial intelligence systems
Database systems
The preceding systems may be centralized or decentralized in the way that they are
distributed.

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 283 ]
Object-oriented systems
Object-oriented systems use the concept of objects that work together with other objects in a 
system to achieve certain objectives. Related and common tasks are grouped together as an
object. Such systems are considered more reliable and less prone to security issues due to
changes in the software code.
The following are some of the concepts of object-oriented systems.
Object-oriented programming (OOP)
An object-oriented programming method uses the collection of objects that communicate
and coordinate with other objects to achieve a desired objective. Sending or receiving
messages and processing instructions are some of the functions of these objects.
Some of the fundamental concepts that are used in object-oriented programming are as
follows:
Class: This defines the characteristics and behaviors of an object
Object: This is a pattern, example, or model of a class
Instance: When a class creates a specific object during runtime, then it is called an
instance of that class
Method: This signifies the abilities of an object
Message passing: This is the communication process to invoke a method by one
object to another
Inheritance: Classes have subclasses; these subclasses inherit characteristics from
the main class
Encapsulation: This is a wrapper and can conceal the functional details of an
object to the class
Abstraction: This is used to simplify a complex structure by modeling
Polymorphism: This is when treating derived class members are treated just like
their parent class members
Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA): This is an analysis process for producing
conceptual model, and Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is used to design the
ways (how) in which to implement the conceptual model produced in the
analysis process

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 284 ]
The security in object-oriented software
Software developed through object-oriented methods are generally considered to be secure.
Only the data that is required for the process is accessible to the class, and the other system
data is not accessible. This data-hiding method makes object-oriented software more secure,
and so, they are prone to less data corruption.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems
AI is science and engineering of making intelligent systems. AI systems perceive their
environment and take action, which maximizes the chance of success. Due to the
adaptability of AI systems based on the environment and the circumstances, a success in an
AI system is determined on the successful decisions that the system makes.
AI systems are used in information technology in an attempt to mimic human brains in 
perception and decision-making. From a security perspective, an artificial intelligence
system can be a protector from attacks as well as a perpetrator of attacks.
An expert system is an artificial intelligence based system that tries to reproduce the
performance of one or more human experts.
Neural network is a type of artificial intelligence system that tries to mimic the neural
processing of the human brain. They are used in applications such as speech recognition,
image analysis, software agents, and so on.
Database systems
A database system defines the storage and manipulation of data, while a Database
Management System (DBMS) is a set of software programs that are used to perform and
control the operations of a database system.
DBMS consists of a modeling language, data structures, database query language, and
transaction mechanisms.

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 285 ]
Threats and vulnerabilities to application
systems
As a security professional, one must s on the following while considering security for 
applications:
Asset: An asset is basically a resource. It may be a computer, operating system,
database management system and so on.
Threat: This is an event that could compromise an asset by exploiting the
weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the asset.
Threat agent: A threat cannot manifest on its own. It needs an agent to exploit 
vulnerabilities. For example, hacking is a threat. Not having suitable patch
management control or monitoring control is a vulnerability. Hacking is done by
a hacker. Hence, a malicious hacker is a threat agent for unethical hacking.
Vulnerability: This is a weakness in the system that a threat agent could exploit.
Inappropriate change controls or insufficient security testing in a software
development process is an example of weak development processes. Such
weaknesses could introduce vulnerabilities in the software.
Attack: This is a technique used by a threat agent to exploit vulnerabilities. For 
example, a malicious hacker would inject a malformed data to a web application
to exploit a weakness for gaining access.
Countermeasures: These are preventative, corrective, or reactive steps to address
vulnerability or an attack.
Web application security
Web applications are becoming popular and used more and more by the government,
universities, and business organizations. The convenience of delivering services such as
banking, e-commerce, e-governance, and education from a centralized location to the users
around the world is taking this technology to dizzying heights. However, the World Wide
Web (WWW) or the Internet is an open network that can be accessed by anyone using a
connected computer. Due to its open nature, web applications are prone to innumerable
security threats and vulnerabilities.

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 286 ]
Common web application vulnerabilities
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a volunteer-based project that lists
the following vulnerabilities that are common to web applications.
OWASP groups and classifies viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and logic bombs as non-target
specific threat agents:
Access control vulnerability: Vulnerabilities in access control mechanisms or
code include authentication and authorization related errors. Some of the
common issues include the following:
Password management errors including empty passwords, hard
coded passwords, or password aging
Authentication bypasses
Unsafe mobile codes
Code permission vulnerability: This type of vulnerability is due to improper
permission setup for the code to run. The exploitation of such a vulnerability
would give higher privilege access to programs.
Code quality vulnerability: The quality of code is based on various parameters.
Vulnerabilities such as leftover debug code, memory leak, undefined behavior,
undefined initialization, and so on will affect the quality of code from a security
perspective.
Cryptographic vulnerability: Vulnerabilities that arise due to algorithm issues
are categorized under this category. Some of the vulnerabilities pertaining to
cryptography include insecure or incorrect algorithms, inappropriate use of
algorithms, implementation errors, and key management problems.
Environmental vulnerability: Vulnerabilities related to environment 
configuration such as improper setup or insecure default settings will fall under
this category.
Error-handling vulnerability: Information leakage, improper handling of error
conditions, null pointer exceptions, and so on will fall under error-handling 
vulnerability.
General logic error vulnerability: This includes logical errors due to branching
or process priority.
Input validation vulnerability: Here, the sanitization of data provided during
the input is insufficient. For example, a form element expecting an input of a
number may be provided with a code as input. If such a code is not validated at
the input stage, then it may be executed internally in the application, thereby
creating a security violation.

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 287 ]
Logging and auditing vulnerability: This includes weak monitoring
mechanisms.
Password management vulnerability: This includes insufficient password rules
and password strength.
Path vulnerability: This includes multiple paths to the target resource with some
of them being insecure.
Protocol error: This signifies weaknesses related to communication protocols.
Range and type error vulnerability: This vulnerability is related to upper and
lower bound memory errors.
Sensitive data protection vulnerability: This vulnerability is related to weak
encryption and/or sensitive data in publicly accessible locations.
Session management vulnerability: This vulnerability is related to weaknesses
in preserving session data.
Synchronization and timing vulnerability: This vulnerability is related to race
conditions that allow an insecure process to be executed before a security control
implementation.
Unsafe mobile codes: These are the codes executed at the client side that have
weaknesses which may allow unauthorized access.
Use of dangerous API: This includes weaknesses in Application Programming
Interfaces.
Security impact analysis
The preceding vulnerability list can be compromised through various attacks. In-house
developed software or acquired software should be thoroughly tested for various attack
scenarios, and their impact has to be determined. The following list provides some of the
common application attacks that need to be tested in applications:
Abuse of functionality
Data structure attacks
Exploitation of authentication
Injection such as code injection or SQL injection
Malicious code attack
Path traversal attack
Probabilistic techniques
Protocol manipulation
Resource depletion

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 288 ]
Resource manipulation
Sniffing attacks
Spoofing
Many of these listed attacks are explained in the previous chapters.
Monitoring and testing activities
Monitoring the application, and testing the security controls is an important step for
software security assurance. Application controls are mechanisms used to preserve
confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application systems and the data they
process, store, or transmit. Such application controls are important to address
vulnerabilities and thwart attacks.
Some of the important application controls that need to be addressed during development
processes include the following:
Memory and address protection is a control used to ensure controlled access to
the memory and address locations by the application. The core focus is to limit
access and prevent overwriting other memory areas.
Access control is a process used to ensure access to authorized entities and block
unauthorized entities.
File protection is a mechanism used to ensure that files are accessed and
modified by authorized entities in a controlled manner.
Authentication is a process used to identify and authorize legitimate entities.
Reliability is a quality parameter used to assure that the application systems are
performing efficiently and effectively.
Summary
This chapter covered performance and assurance requirements in software applications.
Information technology application systems such as object-oriented systems, Artificial
Intelligence systems, Database management systems, and other application development
systems have inherent security and performance controls.

Day 19 – Software Development Security - Assessing effectiveness of Software Security
[ 289 ]
However, software and applications need to be tested for security during development and
regularly after implementation. Such tests need to focus on published and known
vulnerabilities as well as unknown vulnerabilities based on attack scenarios.

Presented here is the revision of the concepts discussed in the previous four chapters, that
is, chapters sixteen through nineteen. They are provided in bullet points as snippets that are
easy to revise. These snippets are for a quick revision and reinforcement of the knowledge
learned.
CISSP CBK Domain #7 – security operations
The following bullet points presented in an exam cram format are for a quick revision. They
cover important points from the security operations domain. The covered topics include
implementing and managing physical security, physical security principles for site and
facilities, environmental security practices for site and facilities, logging and monitoring
activities, understanding and supporting investigations, securing the provision of resources,
operations security, resource protection techniques, foundational concepts on incident
management, preventative measures, patch and vulnerability management, change
management principles, and disaster recovery and business continuity exercises:
Physical access to operational areas needs to have appropriate controls for strong
authentication and authorization.
Controlling access to operational areas and, in the process, identifying and
blocking unauthorized intrusions to the operational areas are primary security
requirements.
Physical security design should include security parameters for the physical
facility, the geographic operating location, and supporting facilities.
The physical facility is usually the building, other structures, a vehicle housing
the system, and network components.
Based on their operating location, systems are characterized as static, mobile, or
portable.
Natural threats, such as earthquake and flooding, and man-made threats, such as
burglary, civil disorders, and so on, characterize the security of the geographic
operating location.
Supporting facilities are those services (both technical and human) that
underpin the operation of the system.
Unauthorized intrusions are a common threat to physical security.
Other threats for physical and operations security include theft, heat and
temperature, humidity, electrical disruptions, and more.

Day 20 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 293 ]
Lack of physical entry controls, lack of accountability, insufficient business
continuity plans, lack of power controls systems, and more are some of the
common vulnerabilities in this domain.
Security controls including monitoring processes for physical and operations are
subdivided into perimeter security and interior security.
High-rise walls, fences, and locks are preventative controls in this domain.
Fire alarm, motion detectors, and more, are detective controls in this domain.
Armed response, mantrap systems, and more are reactive controls in this domain.
Guards, dogs, and lighting are some of the deterrent controls in this domain.
Perimeter security relates to the security considerations pertaining to the
boundaries. Securing the entry and exit points of the facility, networks, and more
will fall under perimeter security.
Guards and dogs are the form of security control to prevent, detect, deter, and
react to an intrusion event.
Fences, high-rise walls, gates, mantraps, and turnstiles are some of the access
control mechanisms for perimeter security.
A turnstile is also called a baffle gate.
Locks such as preset or programmable ones are preventative access control
mechanisms in physical and operations security domain.
Lighting is a deterrent control and is used to discourage intruders as well as
detect suspicious movements.
Closed circuit television, heat sensors, and biometric devices are used in physical
and operation security as monitoring and access control mechanisms.
Interior security refers to the security considerations pertaining to the facilities
that are inside the perimeter.
Unauthorized intrusions are detected through motion detectors and controlled
through mantrap systems.
Fire is an important threat to be considered for physical and operations security.
Based on the type of combustible material, fire is classified as Class A, Class B,
Class C, and Class D.
Class A combustible materials are wood, paper, cloth, rubber. Most of the plastics
also fall into this class.
Class B combustible materials are oils, greases, oil-based paints, lacquers, and
flammable liquids and gases
Class C is predominantly some electrical equipment that is energized.
Class D refers to flammable chemicals such as magnesium and sodium.
Fire detectors are based on heat, flame, or smoke detection.

Day 20 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 294 ]
Fire-suppression mediums include water, soda acid, CO
2, and halon.
Halon is a suppressing medium that is no longer allowed to be used, as it is
designated as an ozone-depleting substance.
Fire extinguishers include water sprinklers and gas dischargers.
Water sprinklers consist of wet pipe, dry pipe, deluge, and preaction.
Gas dischargers generally use CO
2 as an extinguisher.
Clean electrical power is a requirement for proper equipment functioning.
Some of the electrical power-related parameters that could affect equipment's
include noise, Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and Radio Frequency
Interference (RFI).
For proper functioning of the computer systems, the humidity levels should be
between 40 and 60 percent.
Auditing is a process to check and validate the effectiveness of controls. The
primary tool that assists in the audit is an audit trail.
Audit trail contains all the recorded events. One of the most important audit trail
in the physical and operational security domains is the access details to the data
center and other control rooms.
The record of access events is stored in a file called a log. The access log contains
the events that are related to access attempts, and error logs contain the
exceptions.
Physical security also deals with procedures that need to be followed during
emergencies. An emergency is an undesired event that may disturb operations
for a prolonged period of time.
System startup and shutdown procedures lay down guidelines and activities
that need to be performed in a way so that security can not be compromised
during system/data migration or relocation.
Evacuation procedures address the priorities in terms of evacuating assets from
the disaster site and properly handling such assets.
Training and awareness plays an important role during emergencies. The
personnel need to be aware of the emergency procedures. Periodical mock tests
are conducted to ensure that the activities that need to be performed during an
emergency or disaster are rehearsed and all deviances are documented. Such tests
are also called evacuation drills.
Physical security is also concerned with the physical protection of equipment as
well.
Equipment security controls include cable locks, encryption, port protection,
switches, BIOS checks, and more.

required to repair the device.
Data destruction is done by way of formatting the media or degaussing it.
Degaussing is an effective method of destroying the data in a magnetic media.
Data remanence is the residual data that remains when the data is not completely
erased or destroyed.
Computer investigations are also called computer forensics. This process deals
with collecting, preserving, and producing the evidences that pertain to computer
crimes.
Information such as location, time, discovery, securing, controlling, and
maintenance of the evidence is called the chain of evidence.
The cycle of activities from the discovery of evidence to preservation,
transportation, admission in the court, and returning to the owner is called the 
evidence life cycle.
An incident is an event that could possibly violate information security. The
violation may breach the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability requirements
of information assets.
When a systematic and procedural way of managing incidents is established in
an organization, then it is called incident management.
Incident management consists of incident reporting and response to such reports.
Incident management involves actions that are predominantly corrective in
nature.
Some of the incident management controls include intrusion detection controls,
vulnerability assessment and penetration testing, patch management, and
configuration management.
Business continuity planning (BCP) is used to ensure that the continuity of IT
operations is maintained from a primary or alternate location during an incident
or disastrous event based on the business process requirements.
In the BCP domain, our focus will be on specific threat events that could have
a devastating impact on the functioning of the organization as a whole, and the IT
infrastructure in specifically.
BCP is a process that proactively addresses the continuation of business
operations during and aftermath of disruptive events. The aim here is to prevent
interruptions to operations.
The goal of BCP is used to ensure the continuity of business operations without
impacting the organization as a whole.

Day 20 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 296 ]
While designing the BCP, availability should be considered as the most
important factor.
People are the most important asset in business operations. Hence, life safety or
preventing human loss is one of the primary objectives of BCP. Another
important objective of BCP is to avoid any serious damage to business.
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) is a type of risk assessment exercise that tries to
assess qualitative and quantitative impacts on the business due to a disruptive
event.
BCP should be appropriate, adequate, and complete.
BCP resources should include the availability of processes and people to
implement the processes.
Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the timeframe within which the systems
should be recovered (indicated in terms of hours/days).
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum period of time (or amount) of
transaction data that the business can afford to lose during a successful recovery.
Disaster recovery is a process that enables the business to recover from an event
that affects normal business operations for a prolonged period.
Both BCP and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP) are targeted at continuity or
the resumption of business processes as the case may be.
The goal of disaster recovery planning is to effectively manage the operations
during disaster and to ensure proper coordination of different teams.
The objective of disaster recovery planning is to continue the business/IT
operations in a secondary site during disaster and restore them back to the
primary site in a timely manner.
On declaration of disaster the recovery team is entrusted with implementing the
recovery procedure
The salvage team: This team will be responsible for returning business
operations to primary site.
A primary site is the one where normal business operations including IT
operations take place.
A secondary site is referred to as a backup to the primary site. Generally,
secondary sites are geographically located in a different region.
A hot site is an alternate backup site that is fully configured with computer
systems; Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), and power supply.
A cold site, as the name implies, contains no computers or other computing
equipment. Only HVAC, power, and the office space are available.

Day 20 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 297 ]
A warm site is between hot and cold sites. In this type of arrangement, the
computing facilities, such as computers and other communication elements, as
well as HVAC and power are available.
A dual site refers to mirroring the exact operations and data in alternative sites.
Electronic vaulting is a batch process used to dump the data at periodical
intervals to a remote backup system.
Remote journaling is a parallel processing system that writes the data in a
remote system at the alternate site. This type of backup is used where the RTO is
less and a high degree of fault tolerance is required.
Database shadowing is used to duplicate data into multiple sites from the remote
journaling process. This type of system is used where a fault-tolerance
requirement is of the highest degree.
Checklist review is a review process for checking the disaster recovery plan by
the managements of various business units.
A structured walk-through is a tabletop exercise that the management team of
various business unit meets to review each and every step in a sequential
manner.

concepts while designing application systems that are complex and large.

Day 20 – Exam Cram and Practice Questions
[ 298 ]
When a system is developed using the system engineering process, then the
development activity goes through a life cycle model and is called a System
Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Software development is an activity in system
development life cycle models.
A system development life cycle model consists of many processes. They start
from establishing the needs (initiation) and go through to archiving or
destruction (disposal).
Software development is a part of systems development life cycle. Within the
development phase, there are many stages and processes. The activity or cycle
starts from specification development based on which the overall system is
designed and implemented.
Software development models include simplistic models, such as the waterfall
model, iterative models, such as the incremental model or the spiral model, and
complex models, such as the agile framework.
Some of the important security controls in the software development include the
following:

packages
Checking and covert channels
Object-oriented systems use the concept of objects that work together with other
objects in a system to achieve certain objectives.
An object-oriented programming method uses a collection of objects that
communicate and coordinate with other objects to achieve a desired objective.
Sending or receiving messages and processing instructions are some of the
functions of these objects.
Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) is an analysis process for producing
conceptual model, and Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is used to design the
ways (how) in which to implement the conceptual models produced in the
analysis process.

Presented here is a revision of some of the important concepts from all the domains of
CISSP CBK. They are provided in bullet points as snippets that are easy to revise. These
snippets are for quick revision and reinforcement of the knowledge learned:
Risk is defined as an exposure of the asset to loss, injury, or damage due to
threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks.
Asset protection requirements are identified through a structured method of risk
analysis, evaluation, and assessment.
Risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk assessment, and risk mitigation strategies are
the components of risk management.
Identifying threats and vulnerabilities, attacks, estimating potential impact, and
establishing and implementing suitable controls to treat the risk are functional
steps in risk management.
Risk analysis that provides risk values in numeric terms, such as monetary
values, is known as quantitative.
Risk analysis that provides risk values in non-numeric terms, such as high-low-
medium, is called qualitative.
Security controls are identified through risk mitigation strategies.
Risk treatment includes accepting, transferring, reducing, or avoiding the risk.
Monitoring, reviewing, communicating the results, and improving the security
posture are continual improvement processes in the risk management cycle.
Security posture is the overall plan of the organization pertaining to its security.
It includes security governance, policies, procedures, and compliance.
Information security is the preservation of the Confidentiality, Integrity, and
Availability (CIA) of assets:
Confidentiality: Unauthorized users should not view the
information
Integrity: Unauthorized users should not modify the information
Availability: To ensure authorized users can access the information
whenever they need to
Threat is an event that could compromise the information security by causing
loss or damage to assets. Vulnerability is a hole or weakness in the system.
Threat can exploit vulnerabilities through threat agents. A threat event, through
its agents, exploiting a vulnerability is called an attack. The end result of an
attack could be a security violation.

Day 21 – Exam Cram and Mock Test
[ 305 ]
Security violation is a compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and the
availability requirement of the asset.
The information life cycle includes handling, processing, transporting, storing,
archiving, and destroying the information.
Information protection includes risk management, risk reporting, and
accountability.
Aligning and integrating information security with enterprise governance and IT
governance frameworks is called information security strategy.
Information security policystates the management intent, support, and direction
for security.
Procedures, guidelines, and standards are called administrative controls.
Technical controls are used to support management and administrative controls
through information systems.
Due diligence is understanding risk and estimating the risk values, and Due care
is implementing security governance.
Privacy is the protection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Sensitive
Personal Information (SPI) of individuals.
A computer crime is a fraudulent activity that is perpetrated against computers
or IT systems.
In computer crime, the term computer refers to the role it plays in different
scenarios: crime committed against a computer, crime committed using the
computer, and computer incidental in the crime.
Data breach is a security incident in which sensitive, protected, or confidential
data is copied, transmitted, viewed, stolen, or used by an unauthorized entity.
Code of ethics is based on the safety of the commonwealth; duty to principals
such as employers, contractors, people whom a professional works for; and duty
to each other.
The (ISC)
2code of professional ethics includes four clauses. They are:
Protect society, the commonwealth, and the infrastructure
Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally
Provide a diligent and competent service to principals
Advance and protect the profession
A personnel security policy concerns people associated with the organization
such as employees, contractors, and consultants.
Risk mitigation strategies address risks in terms of availability of the assets
are addressed through business continuity management processes.

[ 306 ]
An event that could impact regular operations for a prolonged period of time can
be termed a disruptive event.
Addressing the risks by way of plans and procedures for the continuation of
business operations during and after a disruptive event is called Business
Continuity Planning (BCP).
Asset security is based on asset classification and CIA values; and asset
classification helps to devise suitable security controls.
The need-to-know principle establishes that one has to demonstrate specific
needs to know or access information that is classified as sensitive.
Core secret, top secret, secret, confidential, public trust, and unclassified are the
types of information classification in the United States.
Private and public sector corporate entities classify information under four
categories such as confidential, private, sensitive, and public.
Data that remains even after erasing or formatting from the digital media is called
residual data, and the property to retain such kind of data is called data
remanence.
Privacy laws stipulate data collection limitations pertaining to personal data.
The segregation of duties or the separation of duties is a security control measure
used to ensure that mutually exclusive roles are not assigned to a single user
concurrently.
Data can be traditionally grouped under three categories such as Personally
Identifiable Information (PII), Intellectual Property (IP), and Non-Public
Information (NPI).
Data in Motion refers to the information as it moves around the organization.
Information that is stored within the organization is considered to be Data at rest.
Information that is used by the staff and the data that is available in endpoints is
considered as Data in Use.
Data Loss Prevention controls are based on who is causing the incident. What
actions are carried out by the individual to cause such an incident? Who else is
involved and where? And what action is taken?
Hashing is a method in which a cryptographic value is computed and
periodically validated based on the contents of the document. Hashing uses
mathematical algorithms to compare hashes, and it provides integrity.
Establishing the identity of the receiver or sender in a digital communication is
accomplished through digital signatures.
A secure disposal of media, labeling, access restrictions, formal records of
authorized recipients, the storage of media, data distribution, marking, the
review of distribution lists, and the control of publicly available information are a

documentation.
Encapsulation is a technique to hide information from unauthorized entities.
Abstraction is the process of hiding the details and exposing only the essential
features of a particular concept or object that are encapsulated.
Logical Security Guard is a security mechanism used to control the
communication between entities that are labeled lower-sensitive and high-
sensitive.
In information security, the term assurance means the level of trust or the degree
of confidence in the satisfaction of security needs.
A computer security model Take-grant protection model specifies obtaining
(taking) rights from one entity to another or transferring (granting) of rights by
one entity to another.
The Bell LaPadula security model focus on confidentiality; this model prescribes
access controls to classified or confidential information. A simple way to
remember this model is-no read up and no write down.
The Biba model focuses on data integrity. A simple way to remember this model
is-no read down and no write up.
The Clarke Wilson model focuses on integrity and aims to address multilevel
security requirements in computing systems.
The primary purpose of vulnerability and penetration tests is to identify,
evaluate, and mitigate the risks due to vulnerability exploitation.
Testing from an external network with no prior knowledge of the internal
networks and systems is referred to as black-box testing.
Performing the test from an external network or within the network with the
knowledge of networks and systems is referred to as white-box testing.
Testing from an external and/or internal network with some knowledge of
internal networks and systems is referred to as gray-box testing. This is usually a
combination of black-box testing and white-box testing.
An algorithm in cryptography is a series of well-defined steps that provide the
procedure for encryption/decryption.

Day 21 – Exam Cram and Mock Test

If only one key is used, then it is called symmetric key encryption; if two keys
are used, then it is called asymmetric key encryption; and if no key is used, then
it is called .
When the key stream algorithm operates on a single bit, byte, or computer word
such that the information is changed constantly, then it is called stream cipher.
If the algorithm operates on a block of text (as opposed to a single bit or byte),
then it is known as block cipher.
Digital signature is a type of public key cryptography where the message is
digitally signed using the sender's private key.

The overall process of facilitating and managing identities and controlling access
to assets while ensuring information security is termed Identity and Access
Management (IAM).
Identity and access management consists of four distinctive principles and
practices. They are Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and
Accountability.
Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability are together referred to as 
Triple A of Access Control.
When identity and access management applications and associated services are
delivered through subscription-based cloud models, then such services are
termed as Identity as a Service (IDaaS).
Access management is facilitated through authentication and authorization
processes.
If access to an object is controlled based on certain contextual parameters, such as
location, time, sequence of responses, and access history, then it is known as 
context-dependent access control.
If the access is provided based on the attributes or content of an object, then it is
called content-dependent access control.
A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a non-discretionary access control based
on the subject's role or position in the organization.
When an entity (subject) is validated against a single credential, then it is called a 
one-factor authentication and generally uses the what you know principle.
When an entity (subject) is validated against two different credentials, then it is
called as two-factor authentication and generally uses what you have principle.
When an entity (subject) is validated against two or more different credentials,
then it is called a multifactor authentication and generally uses the what you are
principle.
When a Trojan horse is activated on a particular event (such as a particular date),
then it is called a logic bomb.
Spoofing is a type of attack used to imitate a trusted entity, thereby making the
system trust this imitated entity.
Vulnerability tests and assessments are performed to ascertain the presence of
technical vulnerabilities or weakness in systems. When an identified vulnerability
is not published by the application vendor, then it is called a zero-day
vulnerability. When an exploit code is published by a security or malicious
group before a patch released by the vendor, then it is called a zero-day exploits.
Penetration testing is often performed to ascertain break-in possibilities in
systems.
