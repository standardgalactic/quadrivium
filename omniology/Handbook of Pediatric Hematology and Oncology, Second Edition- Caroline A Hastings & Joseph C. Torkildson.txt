Preface
The pace of change in the ﬁeld of pediatric
hematology and oncology is staggering.
Molecular biology, genomics, and bio-
chemistry have accelerated the accumula-
tion of knowledge and understanding of
disease states. Yet the application of this
new knowledge to the individual child
before you, the work of the physician, is
often overwhelming, even for the most
experienced practitioner. The course and
prognosis for the child is often determined
by the rapidity of disease onset, diagnosis,
and initial treatment. What is needed is
a
practical,
tested
approach
to
these
problems that ensures timely evaluation,
competent early care, and avoidance of
pitfalls that might prejudice future treat-
ment options. This practical approach is
clearly brought by spending time with
the
patients
and
their
families,
and
observing the myriad variations that are
never mentioned in the large studies or
case reports.
This handbook represents the work of my
colleagues at Children’s Hospital & Research
Center Oakland toward this endeavor. The
guidelines offered here have been used to
train medical students, pediatric residents,
and pediatric hematology/oncology fellows
forover20years.Thishandbookwillgiveyou
clinical approaches for common problems in
pediatric hematology and oncology, the
knowledge to organize and to evaluate the
care of your patients, and a framework to
incorporate
ever-expanding
psychosocial
needs, clinical studies, medical treatments,
and science. All of these are essential com-
ponents that make up the care of the child
with cancer or a blood disease.

Acknowledgments
We could not be here without the long-
standing love and support of our families.
On a day to day basis, the patients and their
families continue to show us how to live
gracefully in even the hardest of times and
inspire us to continue to endeavor for
improved outcomes. Our experiences have
taught us the magnitude of remembering
our roles: “to cure sometimes, to relieve
often, to comfort always.” (Anonymous,
15thcentury)

Approach to the
Anemic Child
Anemia is the condition in which the con-
centration of hemoglobin or the red cell
mass is reduced below normal. Anemia
results in a physiological decrease in the
oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and
reduced oxygen supply to the tissues. Causes
of anemia are increased loss or destruction
of red blood cells (RBCs) or a signiﬁcant
decreased rate of production. When evalu-
ating a child with anemia, it is important to
determine if the problem is isolated to one
cell line (e.g., RBCs) or multiple cell lines
(i.e., RBCs, white blood cells [WBCs], or
platelets). When two or three cell lines are
affected, it may indicate bone marrow
involvement (leukemia, metastatic disease,
and aplastic anemia), sequestration (i.e.,
hypersplenism), immune deﬁciency, or an
immune-mediated process (e.g., hemolytic
anemia and immune thrombocytopenic
purpura).
Evaluation of anemia
The evaluation of anemia includes a com-
plete medical history, family history, physical
examination, and laboratory assessment. See
Figure 1.1.
The diagnosis of anemia is made after
reference to established normal controls for
age (Table 1.1). The blood smear and red
cell indices are very helpful in the diagnosis
and classiﬁcation of anemia. It allows for
classiﬁcation by the cell size (MCV, mean
corpuscular volume), gives the distribution
of cell size (RDW, red cell distribution
width), and may give important diagnostic
clues if speciﬁc morphological abnormali-
ties are present (e.g., sickle cells, target cells,
and spherocytes). The MCV, RDW, and
reticulocyte count are helpful in the differ-
ential diagnosis of anemia. A high RDW, or
anisocytosis, is seen in stress erythropoiesis
and is often suggestive of iron deﬁciency or
hemolysis. A normal or low reticulocyte
count is an inappropriate response to ane-
mia and suggests impaired red cell produc-
tion. An elevated reticulocyte count suggests
blood loss, hemolysis, or sequestration.
The investigation of anemia requires
the following steps:
1. The medical history of the anemic child
(Table 1.2), as certain historical points may
provide clues as to the etiology of the
anemia.
2. Detailed physical examination (Table 1.3),
with particular attention to acute and chronic
effects of anemia.
3. Evaluation of the complete blood count
(CBC), RBC indices, and peripheral blood
smear,
with
classiﬁcation

reticulocyte count, and RBC morphology.
Consideration should also be given to the
WBC and platelet counts as well as their
respective morphology.
4. Determination of an etiology of the
anemia by additional studies as needed
(see Figures 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3).

and storage iron forms (such as total
iron-binding capacity [TIBC], serum iron,
transferrin saturation, and ferritin). Iron
absorption is impaired in certain chronic
disorders (autoimmune diseases such as
lupus,
peptic
ulcer
disease,
ulcerative
colitis, and Crohn’s disease), by certain
medications (antacids and histamine-2
blockers), and by environmental factors
such as lead toxicity.
Indications for an oral iron challenge
include any condition in which a poor
response to oral iron is being questioned,
such as in: noncompliance, severe anemia
secondary to dietary insufﬁciency (exces-
sive milk intake), and ongoing blood loss.
Administration of an oral iron challenge
is quite simple: ﬁrst, draw a serum iron level;
second, administer a dose of iron (3 mg/kg
elemental iron) orally; third, draw another
serum iron level 30 to 60 minutes later.
The serum level is expected to increase by
at least 100 mcg/dL if absorption is ade-
quate. The oral iron challenge is a quick
and easy method to assess appropriateness
of oral iron to treat iron deﬁciency—a safer,
cheaper yet equally efﬁcacious method of
treatment as parenteral iron.
Parenteral iron therapy
Due to the potential risks of older parenteral
iron preparations (speciﬁcally high molec-
ular weight iron dextran), a reluctance
remains to use the newer and much safer
formulations. The majority of safety data
exists with low molecular weight (LMW)
iron dextran although many practitioners
have moved to newer (and perceived safer)

formulations including ferric gluconate and
iron sucrose. Three additional compounds
have been approved recently, 2 in Europe
(ferric carboxymaltose and iron isomalto-
side) and 1 in the United States (ferumox-
ytol). These newer agents have the potential
beneﬁt of total dose replacement in a very
short and single infusion as compared to
ferric gluconate and iron sucrose which
require multiple doses. LMW iron dextran
is approved as a total dose infusion for
adults in Europe but not the United States.
Due to the smaller dose generally required
in pediatric patients, total iron replacement
is feasible in 1 to 2 doses of LMW iron
dextran. Calculation of the necessary dose is
as follows:
Dosage ðmLÞ ¼ 0:0442  LBW ðkgÞ

þ ½0:26  LBW ðkgÞ;
where
LBW ¼ lean body weight

females: 45:5 kg þ 2:3 kg for
every inch over 5 ft in height
Hgbn ¼ desired hemoglobin ðg=dLÞ ¼ 12
if <15 kg or 14:8 if >15 kg

states). Replacement may be given in a single
dose, depending on the dose required. See
the formulary for further information.
Severe allergic reactions can occur
with iron dextran and the low molecular
weight product should be preferentially
utilized. A test dose (10 to 25 mg) should be
given prior to the ﬁrst dose with observation
of the patient for 30 to 60 minutes prior to
administering the remainder of the dose. A

can be given, lack of need for a test dose, and
excellent side effect proﬁle.
Erythropoietin
Recombinant
human
erythropoietin
(EPO) stimulates proliferation and differ-
entiation of erythroid precursors, with an
increase in heme synthesis. This increased
proliferation creates an increased demand
in iron availability and can result in a
functional iron deﬁciency if not given with
iron therapy.
Indications for EPO include end-stage
renal
disease,
anemia
of
prematurity,
anemia of chronic disease, anemia associ-
ated with treatment for AIDS, and autolo-
gous blood donation. EPO use for the
treatment of chemotherapy-induced ane-
mia remains controversial and is not rou-
tinely recommended in pediatric patients
(see Chapter 25).
The most common side effect of EPO
administration is hypertension, which may
be somewhat alleviated with changes in the
dose and duration of administration.
Typical starting dose of EPO is 150 U/kg
three times a week (IV) or subcutaneous
(SC). CBCs and reticulocyte counts are
checked weekly. Higher doses, and more
frequent dosing, may be necessary. Response
is usually seen within 1 to 2 weeks. Adequate
iron intake (3 mg/kg/d orally or intermittent
parenteral therapy) should be provided to
optimize effectiveness and prevent iron
deﬁciency.
Transfusion therapy
Children with very severe anemia (Hgb < 5
g/dL) may require treatment with red cell
transfusion, depending on the underlying
disease and baseline hemoglobin status,
duration of anemia, rapidity of onset, and
hemodynamic stability. The pediatric liter-
ature is scarce as to the best method of
transfusing
such
patients.
However,
it
appears to be common practice to give slow
transfusions to children with cardiovascular
compromise (i.e., gallop rhythm, pulmo-
nary edema, excessive tachycardia, and poor
perfusion) while being monitored in an ICU
setting. Transfusions are given in multiple
small volumes, sometimes separated by sev-
eral hours, with careful monitoring of the
vitals and ﬂuid balance. For those children
who have gradual onset of severe anemia,
without cardiovascular compromise, con-
tinuous transfusion of 2 mL/kg/h has been
shown to be safe and result in an increase in
the hematocrit of 1% for each 1 mL/kg of
transfused packed RBCs (based on RBC
storage method). The hemoglobin should
be increased to a normal value to avoid
further cardiac compromise (i.e., Hgb 8
to 12 g/dL). Again, the ﬁnal endpoint may
be dependent on several factors including
nature of anemia, ongoing blood loss or lack
of production, baseline hemoglobin, and
volume to be transfused. Care should be
taken to avoid unnecessary exposure to
multiple blood donors by maximal use of
the unit of blood, proper division of units in
the blood bank, and avoidance of opening
extra units for small quantities to meet a
total volume. See Chapter 5 for product
preparation, ordering, and premedication.
A
posttransfusion
hemoglobin
can
be
checked if necessary at any point after the
transfusion has been completed. Waiting
for “reequilibration” is anecdotal and un-
necessary.
Case study for review
You are seeing a one year old for their well
child check in clinic. As part of routine
screening,
a
ﬁngerstick
hemoglobin
is
recommended.
1. What questions in the history might help
screen for anemia?
2. What about the physical examination?

Chapter 1

Multiple questions in the history can be
helpful. Dietary screening for excessive milk
intake is important in addition to asking
about intake of iron-rich foods such as
green leafy vegetables and red meat. One
should also ask about pica behavior such as
eating dirt or ice and include questions
regarding the age of the house to help screen
for lead paint exposure and ingestion. Any
sources of blood loss should also be
explored including blood in the urine or
stool as well as frequent gum or nose bleed-
ing (more likely in an older child). Finally,
family history should be explored regarding
anemia during pregnancy, previous history
of iron deﬁciency in siblings, and history of
hemoglobinopathies.
Physical examination to search for ane-
mia should be focused. Pallor, especially
subconjunctival, perioral, and periungual
should be checked. Tachycardia, if present,
would be more consistent with acute anemia
rather than well-compensated chronic ane-
mia. Splenomegaly, sclera icterus, and jaun-
dice may point to an acute or chronic
hemolytic picture.
You do the ﬁngerstick hemoglobin in
clinic and it is 10.2 g/dL. The history is not
suggestive of iron deﬁciency and the exam is
unremarkable.
3. What are the reasonable next steps?
Depending on the prevalence of iron
deﬁciency in your population, it would be
reasonable at this point to give a 1 month
trial of oral iron therapy. The family should
be counseled that oral iron tastes bad and
should be given with vitamin C (i.e., orange
juice) and not milk to improve absorption.
If there is a low likelihood of iron deﬁciency,
a family history of thalassemia or sickle cell
disease, or a suggestive newborn screen, an
empiric trial of oral iron supplementation
should not be performed. Similarly, if there
are signs that are consistent with a hemolytic
process or a signiﬁcant underlying disorder,
further workup should be done. In these
cases, it would be correct to next perform
a CBC. If there are concerns for sickle cell
disease or thalassemia, it would be reason-
able to also perform hemoglobin electro-
phoresis. If there are concerns for hemoly-
sis, labs including reticulocyte count, total
bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and a
direct
Coombs
should
be
performed.
Finally, if there is concern for a systemic
illness such as leukemia, a manual differ-
ential should be requested. Further workup
for iron deﬁciency (ferritin and TIBC)
as well as lead toxicity could be included
or deferred until the anemia is better
characterized utilizing the MCV and RDW
on the CBC.

Hemolytic Anemia
Red blood cells (RBCs) normally live for
about 100 to 120 days in the circulation.
Hemolytic anemia results from a reduced red
cell survival due to increased destruction. To
compensate for a reduced RBC life span, the
bone marrow increases its output of red cells,
a response mediated by erythropoietin.
Destruction of red cells can be intravascular
(within the circulation) or extravascular (by
phagocytic cells of the bone marrow, liver,
or spleen). Red cell injury or destruction is
associated with a transformation to a rigid
or abnormal form. Altered cell deformability
then leads to decreased survival. Hemolytic
anemia may be inherited (thalassemias,
hemoglobinopathies, red cell enzyme deﬁ-
ciencies, or membrane defects) or acquired
(immune-mediated, associated with infec-
tion, or medication related). It can be chronic
or acute. Some types of low-grade chronic
hemolytic anemias can have acute exacerba-
tions, such as a child with glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deﬁciency
with
an
exposure
to
fava
beans
or
naphthalene.
Red cell membrane disorders
Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most
common congenital red blood cell mem-
brane disorder. The usual patient with HS
has intermittent jaundice, and hemolytic or
red cell aplastic episodes associated with
viral infection, splenomegaly, and choleli-
thiasis. However, the clinical presentation is
quite variable, with most severe cases pre-
senting in the newborn period or early
childhood and milder cases presenting in
adulthood.
Several membrane protein defects are
responsible for HS. Most result in the insta-
bility of spectrin, one of the major red cell
skeletal
membrane
proteins.
Structural
changes that result as a consequence of pro-
tein deﬁciency lead to membrane instability,
loss of surface area, abnormal membrane
permeability, and decreased red cell deform-
ability. Metabolic depletion accentuates the
defect in HS cells, which accounts for an
increase in osmotic fragility after a 24-hour
incubation of whole blood at 37 C. The
splenic sinusoids prevent passage of nonde-
formable spherocytic red cells. This explains
the occurrence of splenomegaly in HS and
the therapeutic effect of splenectomy.
Patientswith HS havea mild-to-moderate
chronic hemolytic anemia. Red cell indices
reveal a normal to low mean corpuscular
volume (MCV) depending on the number
of microspherocytes. Cellular dehydration
increases the mean corpuscular hemoglobin
concentration
(characteristically
>36%).
The red cell distribution width (RDW) is

elevated because of the variable presence
of microspherocytes and reticulocytes in
proportion to the degree of hemolysis. The
peripheral blood smear can be diagnostic
with the presence of spherocytes, although
this can be a normal ﬁnding in the patient
with severe anemia and a resultant reticulo-
cytosis. Osmotic fragility tests and ektacyto-
metry studies are characteristic for HS,
with
increased
fragility
in
hypotonic
environments.
As
with
other
hemolytic
anemias,
affected individuals are susceptible to hypo-
plastic crises during viral infections. Human
parvovirus B19, a frequent pathogen and the
organism responsible for erythema infectio-
sum (ﬁfth disease), selectively invades ery-
throid progenitor cells and may result in a
transient arrest in red cell proliferation.
Recovery begins within 7 to 10 days after
infection and is usually completed by 4 to 6
weeks. If the initial presentation of a patient
with HS is during an aplastic crisis, a diag-
nosis of HS might not be considered because
the reticulocyte count will be low and the
peripheral blood smear may be nondiagnos-
tic. The family history of HS should be
explored; if it is positive, the patient should
be evaluated for HS after recovery from the
aplastic episode.
Splenectomy is often considered for
patients who have had severe hemolysis
requiring transfusions or repeated hospital-
ization. In patients with mild hemolysis, the
decision to perform splenectomy should be
delayed; in many cases, it is not required.
For pediatric patients who have excessive
splenic size, an additional consideration for
splenectomy is to diminish the risk of trau-
matic splenic rupture. The risks of splenec-
tomy must be considered before any clinical
decision is made regarding the procedure.
Red cell survival returns to normal
values after splenectomy unless an accessory
spleen develops. Although an increased
number of spherocytes can be seen in the
peripheral blood after splenectomy and
the osmotic fragility is more abnormal, the
hemoglobin
value
is
normal.
Platelet
counts frequently increase to more than
1000  109/L immediately after splenec-
tomy but return to normal levels over
several weeks. No therapeutic interventions
are required for postsplenectomy thrombo-
cytosis in patients with HS.
To minimize the risk of sepsis due to
Haemophilus inﬂuenza and Streptococcus
pneumoniae, the splenectomy procedure
(when necessary) is often postponed until
after the child’s ﬁfth or sixth birthday.
Patients should be immunized against these
organisms in addition to Neisseria meningi-
ditis prior to splenectomy and receive pen-
icillin prophylaxis following the procedure.
The increase in penicillin-resistant strains of
S. pneumoniae has raised questions regard-
ing the use of prophylactic penicillin. No
studies have determined the frequency of
this problem in children receiving prophy-
lactic penicillin after splenectomy.
Red cell enzyme deﬁciencies
Glucose is the primary metabolic substrate
for the red cell. Because the mature red cell
does not contain mitochondria, it can
metabolize
glucose
only
by
anaerobic
mechanisms. The two major metabolic
pathways
within
the
red
cell
are
the
Embden–Meyerhof pathway (EMP) and the
hexose monophosphate shunt.
Red cell morphological changes are
minimal in patients with red cell enzyme
deﬁciency involving the EMP. Red cell
indices are usually normocytic and normo-
chromic. The reticulocyte count is elevated
in proportion to the extent of hemolysis.
Because
many
enzyme
activities
are
normally increased in young red cells, a
mild deﬁciency in one of the enzymes may
be obscured by the reticulocytosis.
Hemolytic Anemia
11

Pyruvate kinase (PK) deﬁciency is the
most common enzyme deﬁciency in the
EMP. The inheritance pattern of this disor-
der is autosomal recessive. Homozygotes
usually have hemolytic anemia with spleno-
megaly, whereas heterozygotes are usually
asymptomatic. The disorder is found world-
wide, although it is most common in Cau-
casians of northern European descent. The
range of clinical expression is variable, from
severe neonatal jaundice to a fully compen-
sated hemolytic anemia. Anemia is usually
normochromic and normocytic, but macro-
cytes may be present shortly after a hemo-
lytic crisis, reﬂecting erythroid hyperplasia
and early release of immature red cells. The
osmotic fragility of red cells is normal to
slightly reduced. Diagnosis is conﬁrmed by a
quantitative assay for pyruvate kinase, by
the measurement of enzyme kinetics and
glycolytic intermediates, and by family
studies.
Splenectomy is a therapeutic option for
PK-deﬁcient patients. As with HS, the deci-
sion should be made on the basis of the
patient’s clinical course. Unlike HS patients,
PK-deﬁcient
patients,
although
they
improve after splenectomy, do not have
complete correction of their hemolytic ane-
mia. As with all hemolytic anemias, these
patients should have dietary supplementa-
tion with folic acid (1 mg/day) to prevent
megaloblastic complications associated with
relative folate deﬁciency. Immunization
against H. inﬂuenza, S. pneumonia, and N.
meningiditis should be given, as well as
lifelong penicillin prophylaxis in the sple-
nectomized patient.
Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deﬁciency is the most common
X-linked red cell enzyme deﬁciency, with
partial expression in the female population
and full expression in the affected male
population. The distribution of G6PD deﬁ-
ciency is worldwide, with the highest inci-
dence in Africans and African-Americans.
Mediterraneans, American Indians, South-
east Asians, and Sephardic Jews are also
affected. In African-Americans, 12% of the
male population has the deﬁciency, 18% of
the female population is heterozygous, and
2% of the female population is homozy-
gous. In Southeast Asians, G6PD deﬁciency
is found in approximately 6% of the male
population. Most likely, the prevalence of
this enzyme abnormality confers resistance
to malaria, thus its geographic distribution.
Many variants of G6PD deﬁciency are
known and have been characterized at the
biochemical and molecular levels. A variant
found in Mediterraneans is associated with
chronic hemolytic anemia. Other variants
are associated with an unstable enzyme that
has normal levels in young red cells. These
result in hemolysis only in association with
an oxidant challenge (as found in African-
Americans). In some cases of G6PD deﬁ-
ciency, hemolysis may be triggered by the
oxidant intermediates generated during
viral or bacterial infections or after ingestion
of oxidant compounds. Shortly after expo-
sure to the oxidant, hemoglobin is oxidized
to methemoglobin and eventually dena-
tured,
forming
intracellular
inclusions
called Heinz bodies that attach to the red
cell membrane. This portion of the mem-
brane may be removed by reticuloendothe-
lial cells resulting in a “bite” cell that has a
shortened survival owing to its loss of mem-
brane components. To compensate for
hemolysis, red cell production is increased
and thus the reticulocyte count is increased.
Individuals with the Mediterranean or
Asian forms of G6PD deﬁciency, in addition
to being sensitive to infections and certain
drugs, often have a chronic, moderately
severe anemia, with nonspherocytic red
cells and jaundice. Hemolysis usually starts
in early childhood. Reticulocytosis is pres-
ent and can increase the MCV.
When a hemolytic crisis occurs in G6PD
deﬁciency (or favism), pallor, scleral icterus,
12
Chapter 2

hemoglobinemia,
hemoglobinuria,
and
splenomegaly may be noted. Plasma hapto-
globin and hemopexin concentrations are
low with a concomitant rise in plasma-free
hemoglobin. The peripheral smear shows
the fragmented bite cells and polychromato-
philic cells. Red cell indices may be normal.
Special stains can detect Heinz bodies in the
cells during the ﬁrst few days of hemolysis.
A diagnosis of G6PD deﬁciency should be
basedon familyhistory,ethnicity, laboratory
features, physical ﬁndings, and clinical sus-
picion suggested by a recent exposure to
oxidants with resultant acute hemolysis. The
diagnosis is conﬁrmed by a quantitative
enzyme assay or by molecular analysis of the
gene. Since reticulocytes may have a normal
levelofG6PDenzymeactivity,screeningtests
during acute hemolysis may be falsely ele-
vated; therefore, it is important to test once

againhasmatureredbloodcells.Treatmentis
directed toward supportive care during the
acute event and counseling regarding pre-
ventionoffuturehemolyticcrises.Inpatients
with chronic hemolysis, dietary supplemen-
tation with folic acid (1 mg/day) is recom-
mended. Use of vitamin E, 500 mg/day, may
improve red cell survival in patients with
chronic hemolysis.
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
In addition to intrinsic causes of hemolytic
anemia, patients may also develop an auto-
antibody and/or alloantibody toward their
red blood cells. The underlying cause for
this antibody formation is often idiopathic
or due to a secondary condition including
drugs, infectious syndromes, autoimmune
diseases, or an oncological process. A pos-
itive direct antiglobulin test (DAT, direct
Coombs) is pathognomonic for immune-
mediated hemolysis with the appropriate
clinical
and
laboratory
ﬁndings
(i.e.,
jaundice, scleral icterus, elevated bilirubin,
and anemia with reticulocytosis). Fortu-
nately, the majority of pediatric cases of
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) are
acute and self-limited.
In the DAT, the patient’s erythrocytes
are washed and then incubated with speciﬁc
antiglobulin antisera (usually anti-IgG and
anti-C3d). Agglutination indicates a posi-
tive test. In patients with severe immune-
mediated hemolytic anemia, the DAT is
often
strongly
positive,
although
the
strength of the reaction does not always
correlate to the severity of the disease. Sim-
ilarly, up to 80% of patients will have anti-
bodies in the serum as well, measured by the
indirect Coombs (indirect antiglobulin test,
IAT). In the IAT, donor erythrocytes are
incubated with test serum, washed, and then
incubated with speciﬁc antiglobulin anti-
sera. Agglutination again indicates a posi-
tive test. Of note, patients without symp-
toms of hemolysis may have a positive DAT
and/or IAT; therefore, screening is only
recommended in the setting of clinical and
laboratory signs of hemolysis. In approxi-
mately 5% to 10% of cases, patients may
have an AIHA with a negative DAT.
The initiation of autoimmunity is poorly
understood. Viral syndromes are often pro-
posed as a culprit, although causation has
been hard to prove. A majority of cases of
AIHA in pediatrics are due to “warm” anti-
bodies, so named because they react at
37 C. These are often secondary to a viral
syndrome, although patients with an under-
lying autoimmune disease or oncological
process can also present with a warm AIHA.
The formation of IgG antibodies leads
to extravascular hemolysis in which pieces
of the red cell membrane are sequentially
removed
during
passages
through
the
spleen. Patients may also develop direct
Coombs positive hemolytic anemia and
immune-mediated
thrombocytopenia
(Evans syndrome).
Hemolytic Anemia
13

Hemolytic disease of the
newborn
Intrinsic causes of hemolytic anemia can
present as jaundice in the newborn period.
These syndromes must be differentiated
from hemolytic disease of the newborn in
which alloimmunization in the mother
occurs due to foreign RBC antigens from
the fetus. RBC antigens can either be major
(ABO) or minor (Rh, Kell, Duffy, etc.). For
ABO hemolytic disease, typically the mother
is type O and the fetus is type A; anti-A
antibodies subsequently produced by the
mother then traverse the placenta leading
to
hemolytic
anemia
in
the
fetus.
RhoGAM (Rho[D] Immune Globulin) has
virtually eliminated hemolytic disease in the
Rh-negative (D-negative) mother with a
Rh-positive (D-positive) fetus although is
still possible in the mother not receiving
prenatal care. Many cases of hemolytic dis-
ease of the newborn are now due to other
minor RBC antigens with varying levels of
clinical severity. AIHA in the mother can
also lead to hemolytic disease of the new-
born. In this case, maternal antibodies tra-
verse the placenta and are transferred to the
fetus. If the mother is DAT positive but does
not have clinical signs of hemolytic anemia,
there is usually no risk to the fetus.
Microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias are
due to extracorpuscular abnormalities and
are not associated with antibody formation.
Causes include disseminated intravascular
coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, pre-
eclampsia, malignant hypertension, valvular
abnormalities, and march hemoglobinuria.
In these cases, red blood cells travel through
damaged blood vessels or heart valves or are
damaged by the formation of an intravas-
cular ﬁbrin mesh due to hypercoagulability,
leading to fragmentation (e.g., schistocytes)
and intravascular hemolysis.
Evaluation
Theevaluation ofhemolytic anemia includes
a thorough history assessing for evidence of
chronic hemolytic anemia and possible pre-
cipitants of an acute event (see Figure 2.1).
The family history is equally important
and questions to ask include:
History of newborn jaundice
Gallstones
Splenomegaly or splenectomy
Episodes of dark urine and/or yellow skin/
sclerae
Anemia unresponsive to iron
supplementation
Medications
Environmental exposures
Ethnicity
Dietary history
The physical exam should be complete, but
focused on:
Skin color (pallor, jaundice, and icteric
sclerae)
Facial
bone
changes
(extramedullary
hematopoiesis)
Abdominal fullness and splenomegaly
The laboratory evaluation includes:
Complete blood count, RBC indices, and
reticulocyte count (")
Peripheral blood smear (assess for fragmen-
ted forms or evidence of inherited ane-
mia
with
speciﬁc
morphological
abnormalities)
Bilirubin (")
Coombs test, direct and indirect (to exclude
antibody-mediated red cell destruction)
Urinalysis (for heme, bili)
Free plasma hemoglobin (")
14
Chapter 2

Speciﬁc tests for diagnosis may include:
Osmotic fragility
Ektacytometry
Red cell enzyme defects (G6PD and PK)
Red cell membrane defects (HS)
The osmotic fragility test is used to measure
the osmotic resistance of red cells. Red cells
are incubated under hypotonic conditions,
and their ability to swell before lysis is
determined. The osmotic fragility of red
cells is increased when the surface area to
volume ratio of the red cells is decreased, as
in hereditary spherocytosis, in which mem-
brane instability results in membrane loss
and decreased surface area. Conversely,
osmotic fragility is decreased in liver disease
as the ratio of the red cell surface area to
volume is increased. Ektacytometry mea-
sures the deformability of red cells subjected
simultaneously to shear stress and osmotic
stress.

Hemolytic Anemia
15

Treatment
Therapy depends on the underlying cause
of the anemia and the degree of acute
hemolysis. In chronic hemolysis, such as
that associated with hereditary spherocyto-
sis, splenectomy is often recommended to
decrease the degree of splenic destruction
and level of anemia and to decrease the
incidence
of
bilirubin
gallstones.
This
therapy must be now weighed against the
potential long-term complications of sple-
nectomy
including
risk
for
infection,
thrombosis, and pulmonary hypertension.
In other forms of inherited anemias in
which the hemolysis is more signiﬁcant and
even life-threatening, such as thalassemia or
some forms of enzymopathies, chronic
transfusion therapy is recommended. Other
general measures include folic acid replace-
ment due to high cell turnover, avoidance of
oxidant chemicals and drugs, and iron che-
lation therapy as indicated for transfusion-
related iron overload.
Immune hemolytic anemias can require
more immediate and aggressive therapy.
The underlying disease, if present and
identiﬁable, warrants treatment. Addition-
ally, the use of corticosteroids in high doses
is frequently necessary. Splenectomy and
immunosuppressive
drugs
have
also
been successful. Microangiopathic hemo-
lytic anemias can also be severe and life-
threatening. Treatment should again ﬁrst be
directed toward the primary disorder to
remove the cause of trauma, if possible.
Transfusions are frequently necessary and
splenectomy
may
be
needed
in
some
patients with severe hypersplenism.
Case study for review
You are seeing a 6-year-old child in the
emergency department. The family notes
that the child has been jaundiced and
fatigued over the last few days with a red
color to the urine. Fingerstick hemoglobin
at the pediatrician’s ofﬁce reveals a hemo-
globin of 5 g/dL prior to transfer to the ED.
On the basis of this history and hemoglobin,
it appears that the child is suffering from a
hemolytic anemia.
1. What initial lab studies will help conﬁrm
the diagnosis and also help with the initial
treatment plan?
Initial lab studies should include a com-
plete blood count with reticulocyte count.
The reticulocyte count is an important ﬁrst
steptoconﬁrmthatthepatientisundergoing
hemolysis, which should present with a low
hemoglobin and a resultant increase in the
reticulocyte count. A low reticulocyte count
in this setting should lead to consideration of
alternative diagnoses such as viral suppres-
sion (although one would not expect hemo-
lysis). A complete metabolic panel as well as
lactatedehydrogenase(LDH)shouldbedone
to ensure that the patient is actually suffering
from jaundice (elevated total bilirubin) and
hemolysis (elevated LDH and AST). A direct
and indirect Coombs (DAT/IAT) is an
important ﬁrst step to determine if the
patient is undergoing an immune or nonim-
mune hemolytic anemia.
The patient is noted to have a hemoglobin
of 4.6 g/dL with 12.6% reticulocytes. One
should ﬁrst determine if the patient is having
an appropriate bone marrow response to
anemia by calculating the reticulocyte index
(RI):
RI ¼ Reticulocyte count ð%Þ

current hemoglobin
expected hemoglobin


In this case, the RI is 12.6%  (4.6/13) ¼ 4.5.
An RI  3.0 is consistent with an appro-
priate bone marrow response to anemia, and
therefore helps to rule out bone marrow
16
Chapter 2

dysfunction in this case. Modern blood cell
analyzers have the ability to calculate the
absolute reticulocyte count and the fraction
of“immature”reticulocytesdirectly.Patients
who are demonstrating an appropriate
response to hemolysis will have an elevated
absolute reticulocyte count and immature
reticulocyte fraction; these will be low or
normal in patients with an inadequate
response.
Other labs include a total bilirubin of
6.7 mg/dL, LDH of 936U/L (reference range
313 to 618 U/L), and AST of 161U/L. DAT is
noted to be positive for IgG and C3d.
2. What is the likely diagnosis?
With the positive DAT to IgG and com-
plement and clinical and laboratory signs of
hemolysis, warm antibody-mediated AIHA
is the likely diagnosis. It should be noted
that a positive DAT without clinical and
laboratory signs of hemolysis is not sufﬁ-
cient for the diagnosis of AIHA.
3. What should be the initialtreatment plan?
The patient is started on steroid therapy,
IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg BID. After a
couple of days, the hemoglobin has contin-
ued to decrease to 3 g/dL even though the
methylprednisolone has been increased to
4 mg/kg BID and the patient is showing signs
of symptomatic anemia and congestive heart
failure.
4. How should your treatment change at
this point?
Since the patient has a falling hemoglobin
with clinical signs of cardiac instability and
volume overload, the patient should be
transfused. The term “least incompatible
unit” has been used in the past but is a
misnomer if phenotypically matched blood
is given. The patient may not have a normal
increase in hemoglobin with transfusion
due to continued hemolysis and the poten-
tial for increased, bystander hemolysis with
transfusion. Because of the cardiac instabil-
ity, it is advisable to give the transfusion
slowly and monitor for worsening cardiac
function. Finally, a change in therapy would
be advisable at this point with either intra-
venous immunoglobulin or a different
immunosuppressant such as cyclosporine,
cyclophosphamide, or rituximab (monoclo-
nal antibody to CD20).

Sickle Cell Disease
Sickle cell disease refers to a group of genetic
disorders that share a common feature:
hemoglobin S (Hgb S) alone or in combi-
nation with another abnormal hemoglobin.
The sickle cell diseases are inherited in
an autosomal codominant manner. The
molecular defect in Hgb S is due to the
substitution of valine for glutamic acid at
the sixth position of the b-globin chain.
The change of location of this substitution
results in polymerization of the hemoglobin
and causes the red cells to transform from
deformable
biconcave
discs
into
rigid,
sickle-shape cells. Hypoxia, acidosis, and
hypertonicity facilitate polymer formation.
The most common combinations of
abnormal hemoglobins are (1) Hgb SS,
(2) Hgb SC, and (3) Hgb S with a beta-
thalassemia, either Sb þ or Sb0. The most
severely affected individuals have either Hgb
SS or Sb0 (no normal beta-globin produc-
tion). Individuals with Hgb Sb þ
have
decreased beta-globin production and less
severe disease, whereas children who have
Hgb SC have intermediate severity of dis-
ease. There is phenotypic overlap between
Hgb SS and Hgb SC; some children with
Hgb SC are more symptomatic than chil-
dren with Hgb SS. There are many variables
to expression of this hemoglobinopathy
including haplotypes, Hgb F concentration,
and other yet to be delineated factors. As yet,
it is not possible to predict the severity of
disease in advance of severe complications.
Generally, children who have vaso-occlusion
and other complications have a more severe
course. Increased leukocyte count, decreased
hemoglobin with concomitant increased
reticulocytosis, as well as frequency and
severity of vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs)
are associated with increased morbidity and
mortality.
Alpha-thalassemia (frequency 1% to 3%
in African-Americans) may be coinherited
with sickle cell trait or disease. Individuals
who have both a-thalassemia and sickle cell
anemia are less anemic than those who have
sickle cell anemia alone due to a more
similar concentration of a- and b-globulins.
However,
a-thalassemia
trait
does
not
appear to prevent frequency or severity of
vaso-occlusive complications, resulting in
eventual end-organ damage.
Sickle cell disease is not uncommon and
has developed due to protection from
malaria in those with sickle cell trait. In
African-Americans, the frequency of genetic
alteration is quite high: 8% have the Hgb S
gene, 4% the Hgb C gene, and 1% the
b-thalassemia gene. Approximately 1 in
600 African-American infants has sickle cell
anemia. Sickle cell disease also occurs in
children from the Middle East, India, Cen-
tral and South America, and the Caribbean.

All children who have sickle cell hemo-
globinopathies have a variable degree of
hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusive tis-
sue ischemia resulting in numerous clinical
complications. Organs most sensitive to
the ischemic-hypoxic injury of red cell
sickling are the lungs, spleen, kidneys,
bone marrow, eyes, brain, and the heads
of the humeri and femurs. Sickling has
both acute and long-term implications for
organ function. Cerebral vascular disease
can be subtle, causing only abnormal
neuropsychological testing or it can be
catastrophic,
resulting
in
hemiparesis,
coma, or death; acute pulmonary sickling
causes lung injury leading to restrictive
lung disease and eventually pulmonary
hypertension; osteonecrosis of the femoral
head can be debilitating, resulting in the
need for hip replacement; untreated reti-
nopathy can lead to blindness; and, sickle
cell nephropathy can cause asymptomatic
proteinuria, an early sign of the risk of
eventual renal failure.
Now that newborn hemoglobinopathy
testing is mandatory in most states, chil-
dren are diagnosed early and receive
appropriate care before they are at risk for
complications. All infants who have an
electrophoretic
pattern
of Hgb
FS
at
birth will have some form of sickle cell
disease.
Fever and infection in sickle cell
disease
Susceptibility to infection is increased not
only because of loss of splenic function due
to infarction but also because of other
acquired
immunologic
abnormalities.
This can result in life-threatening episodes
of sepsis. Recognition of this susceptibility
and aggressive medical management have
resulted in an increased life span for most
patients.
Most children with sickle cell disease are
identiﬁed at birth, started on prophylactic
penicillin by age 2 months, and aggressively
monitored and treated for signs of infection.
However, with the increasing concern for
bacterial antibiotic resistance, health care
providers need to be vigilant when con-
fronted with an infant or a child who has
fever (38.3 C) and/or appears ill. Overall,
Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for
>80% of the morbidity of infection. In
some areas of the United States, up to
50% of pneumococcal isolates are penicillin
resistant. Infections can precipitate vaso-
occlusive episodes and other complications
of sickle cell anemia and, in this population,
can quickly become fulminant. Although
the American Academy of Pediatrics guide-
lines recommend the discontinuation of
penicillin prophylaxis after 6 years of age,
our institutional practice is to continue it
as
long
as
possible
(until
compliance
becomes an issue) due to the high risk of
S. pneumoniae infection.
Additional bacteria that cause morbidity
and mortality include Haemophilus inﬂuen-
zae,
Neisseria
meningitidis,
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmo-
nella species, Escherichia coli, and Strepto-
coccus pyogenes. The S. pneumoniae and
H. inﬂuenzae vaccines have importantly
resulted in a lowered case rate of sepsis from
these organisms. Viral infections, particu-
larly parvovirus B19, can cause severe aplas-
tic crises as well as acute chest syndrome
(ACS).
Infants, young children, and any patient
who has a central venous catheter with a
fever (38.3 C) should have a complete
evaluation and laboratories including CBC
with differential, reticulocyte count, blood
culture, urinalysis, and urine culture (see
Figure 3.1). A chest radiograph should also
be obtained. Meningitis can occur in chil-
dren with sickle cell disease but routine
lumbar puncture without physical signs of
Sickle Cell Disease
19

meningitis is not warranted. Urosepsis is
common in sickle cell patients of all ages.
All infants (up to 2 to 3 years of age) should
be admitted and cultures followed for 48 to
72 hours. These patients should not be
discharged during this time even if they
appear
well
and
are
afebrile.
Some
practitioners would recommend complete
evaluation in all patients with a fever.
Children
with
a
documented
fever
should have the same workup as infants,
although admission is not required if they
are well appearing, with reassuring labs and
chest radiograph, and follow-up can be

reasonably guaranteed. Acute chest syn-
drome should be high on the differential
in all children with fever. While physical
examination is essential, 60% of pulmonary
inﬁltrates in children with sickle cell disease
and fever will be missed on exam alone,
therefore chest radiography is essential. If
there is another possible source of infection,
appropriate cultures should be obtained. If a
child appears to be ill, has a temperature of
38.3 C or higher, or has an elevated WBC
with a left shift, treatment should be imme-
diate with parenteral antibiotics and close
monitoring, preferably in a hospital setting.
Of note, studies have shown that the higher
the temperature, the more likely the risk for
bacterial sepsis. If there is difﬁculty with
intravenous (IV) access, ceftriaxone can
be given intramuscular (IM) while access
is being obtained.
Children who do not appear septic, in
whom there is a low index of suspicion, and
who are older than 2 to 3 years of age (per
institutional preference), can be treated as
outpatients with IV/IM ceftriaxone while
awaiting culture results, only if close mon-
itoring can be assured (parents can be con-
tacted by telephone and daily evaluation is
easily done while still febrile). If all cultures
are negative after 2 to 3 days and the child is
afebrile without clinical symptoms, the anti-
biotics and follow-up can be discontinued.
All patients who appear ill should be
hospitalized and treated for presumed infec-
tion. Many children will develop increasing
symptoms after being evaluated and hospi-
talized. Acute chest syndrome commonly
occurs after hydration and is frequently pre-
cipitated by a vaso-occlusive pain episode.
Vaso-occlusive episodes
The bones and joints are the major sites
of pain in sickle cell disease. In trabecular
bones, such as the vertebrae, infarction can
occur and eventually lead to collapse of the
vertebral plates and compression. The clas-
sic radiographic appearance is of “ﬁsh
mouth” disc spaces and the “step” sign (a
depression in the central part of the verte-
bral body). Back pain is a common symp-
tom in sickle cell disease, likely as a result of
recurrent infarction and vertebral compres-
sion. Infarction in the long bones can cause
swelling and edema in the overlying soft
tissues. It may be difﬁcult to differentiate
VOE from acute osteomyelitis. Although
uncommon, infection should be consid-
ered. Osteomyelitis may be ruled out by
close clinical observation, blood cultures,
and occasionally, aspiration of the affected
area. Plain radiographs are not helpful in
the early stages of infection and bone
scans may not differentiate a simple infarct
from osteomyelitis.
Dactylitis,
or
hand-foot
syndrome,
refers to painful swelling of the hands and
feet. This is seen exclusively in infants and
children (<5 years of age). It presents with
pain, low-grade fever, and diffuse nonpit-
ting edema of the dorsum of the hands and
feet, which extends to the ﬁngers. One or
more extremities may be affected at one
time. Radiographic changes (periostitis and
subperiosteal new bone formation with
periosteal elevation) may appear 1 week
or more after the clinical presentation.
Therapy is analgesics, hydration, and paren-
tal reassurance. Although the swelling or
radiographic changes may persist for weeks,
the syndrome is almost always self-limited.
Transfusions and antibiotics are not neces-
sary, unless there is concern for infection or
the medical condition worsens.
Occasionally, there is a precipitating
event such as hypoxia (obstructive sleep
apnea), fever, viral illness, or dehydration
that leads to the vaso-occlusive episode. Few
children have frequent pain episodes; it
should not be taken for granted that each
of these episodes is similar, and a source for
Sickle Cell Disease
21

each painful event should be sought. If the
pain changes or is very persistent, the child
should be reevaluated. If a young child has a
symptom that is interpreted as pain, such as
refusal to walk or a limp, also consider that
the cause may be due to an acute CNS event.
The most common type of pain is mus-
culoskeletal pain. The pain may be of any
conﬁguration: isolated, multifocal, symmet-
ric, migratory, or associated with erythema
or swelling. There can be low-grade fevers,
possibly associated with other clinical symp-
toms. It can sometimes be difﬁcult to dis-
tinguish pain from an infection, synovitis,
or other pathological process.
Children
are
frequently
seen
with
abdominal pain. A surgical abdominal
problem needs to be considered. Children
who have sickle cell anemia have a high
incidence of cholecystitis. Also consider
pancreatitis, urinary tract infection, pelvic
inﬂammatory
disease,
and
pneumonia
presenting as abdominal pain. Ileus and
acute chest syndrome are frequent com-
plications
of
abdominal
vaso-occlusive
episodes.
Vaso-occlusive episodes can last for
many days. Do not assume that the episode
is controlled when the acute administration of
analgesia is effective. Children with these
symptoms may have a medical problem that
needs aggressive treatment beyond therapy
for their pain. A vaso-occlusive episode is a
diagnosis of exclusion. The pain needs to be
treated while there is a workup for potential
other causes of pain beyond the vaso-occlu-
sive episode itself.
A reliable tool should be used to assess a
child’s level of pain. The assessment should
be modiﬁed depending on the age and
developmental level of the child, and the
pain tool should be able to rate both sub-
jective and objective aspects of the child’s
pain. Physicians should be familiar with
their use and refer to them when assessing
children and adolescents with pain.
High-risk
factors
for
complications
other than VOE in children with pain:
* Fever  101F (38.3C) and signs of
infection
* Acute pulmonary symptoms (chest pain,
hypoxia, abnormal ausculatory exam)
* Persistent vomiting
* Pain that is unusual for the patient
* Severe abdominal pain
* Extremity weakness or loss of function
* Any neurological symptoms
* Severe headache
* Acute joint swelling
Pain management
Following are the recommendations for the
management of vaso-occlusive events. How-
ever, many children and adolescents need
individualized care plans for their routine
treatment.
Outpatient
Mild pain
* Increase ﬂuids to 1 to 1.25 maintenance.
Water, fruit juice, and fruit drinks as well as
decaffeinated soda are recommended.
* Acetaminophen without codeine (15 mg/
kg q4 to 6 hours) orally should be tried prior
to
using
acetaminophen
with
codeine
(1.0 mg codeine/kg q4 to 6 hours). For
many children, acetaminophen alone is not
sufﬁcient for vaso-occlusive pain.
* Ibuprofen (10 mg/kg q6 to 8 hours) orally
should be used routinely, every 8 hours even
if pain is temporarily controlled.
* Rest and heat to the area of pain.
* Relaxation and biofeedback exercises,
suchaspositivevisualizationandmeditation.
Severe pain
* IV hydration: bolus to correct ﬂuid losses,
then IV with D5W 1/2 NS at 1 to 1.25
maintenance (IV þ PO). Use caution not
to overhydrate, especially if there are any
22
Chapter 3

pulmonary symptoms (overhydration can
lead to pulmonary edema and precipitate
acute chest syndrome). Note that if the
patient does not appear volume depleted,
an IV ﬂuid bolus is not routinely required.
* Analgesics
(IV):
Morphine:
0.1
to
0.15 mg/kg/dose q3 to 4 hours. In children
<2 years who have not been exposed to
narcotic analgesics, 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg should
be used. The pharmacokinetics of morphine
differs between individual children and
doses
must
be
titrated
for
individual
patients. Both underdosing and overdosing
need to be avoided. Careful management
is required! Previous medication history is
often a good starting place.
* Ketorolac: (child) IV: 1 mg/kg/load, then
0.5 mg/kg q6 hours (max 30 mg); (adult) IV:
30 to 60 mg/load, then 15 to 30 mg/kg q6
hours. GI bleeding has been reported, and
an H2 blocker such as ranitidine is required
if ketorolac is given IV. Morphine and
ketorolac can be given simultaneously or
in succession for the initial treatment of
pain in children. Added to narcotic therapy,
ketorolac increases analgesia and has a nar-
cotic sparing effect. Ketorolac is very useful
in pain control, but should not be used for
more than 5 days. There are numerous
other analgesic medications that have been
used to treat sickle cell pain.
Upon presentation to the clinic or emer-
gency room, the child or adolescent should
be rapidly assessed and treated for pain.
Initially, both morphine and ketorolac
should be given at the maximum recom-
mended doses. If the pain returns, repeat the
parenteral narcotic dose; it is unlikely that
oral analgesics will be successful if this reg-
imen is not effective. If pain relief can be
achieved and maintained for 3 hours,
administer an oral narcotic and observe for
1 hour. If this regimen is successful, give a
prescription of narcotic and nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory medications for several
days (10 to 15 doses). There should be
follow-up within 72 hours. If this regimen
is not successful, if other symptoms develop
with hydration, or a fever develops, the
patient should be admitted and observed.
Inpatient
As noted above, the administration of nar-
cotics to acutely ill patients requires careful
monitoring. A plan for pain management is
deﬁned on admission and followed for the
duration of hospitalization. In addition to
whirlpool therapy, warm packs, and bio-
feedback therapy (as available), routine care
includes:
Management
* Correct acute losses due to dehydration.
Do not overhydrate children who have pul-
monary symptoms.
* Total ﬂuid intake (IV þ PO) should be 1
to 1.25 daily maintenance ﬂuids; do not
overhydrate.
* Monitor daily weight, record strict intake
and output (l&O), and observe for signs of
ﬂuid overload.
* Encourage ambulation, sitting up in bed,
and taking deep breaths.
* Incentive spirometry, 10 times an hour,
every hour while awake.
Analgesics
* Pain medication should be administered
on a ﬁxed-time schedule, with an interval
that does not extend beyond the duration of
the analgesic effect. Do not give narcotics on
a PRN basis except for when the patient is
ready for discharge.
* Titration schedules (requires a written
plan, close observation, and a ﬂow sheet
to
monitor
effectiveness;
sedation
and
hypoventilation can lead to hypoxia and
increased sickling and pain).
* Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). This
is the method of choice for controlling pain
in children who are 7 years of age or older.
Sickle Cell Disease
23

PCA protocols may be hospital speciﬁc.
Generally,
there
is
an
initial
bolus
(0.1 mg/kg morphine), and an on-demand
dose (0.01 to 0.04 mg/kg morphine) with a
10 to 20 minute lock out, and a 1 hour
maximum of 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg of mor-
phine. At night, there may be a need for a
continuous low-dose infusion (0.01 to
0.02 mg/kg/h morphine) without changing
the 1 hour lock out.
Side effects of narcotics include respiratory
depression,
nausea,
vomiting,
pruritus,
hypotension, constipation, inappropriate
secretion of anti-diuretic hormone, and
change in seizure threshold. Low-dose nal-
oxone drip has been used for severe pruritus
and urinary retention due to morphine. The
most common side effects of nausea, vomit-
ing, and pruritus resolve over time. IV or
PO diphenhydramine may be used safely in
this setting and can have a synergistic pos-
itive effect with morphine. Meperidine
should not be substituted for morphine.
The metabolites of meperidine can accumu-
late and cause seizures, especially if used
over a longer period at high doses. A plan
for withdrawal should be a part of discharge
planning; clonidine hydrochloride has been
used successfully in this setting, but should
be carefully monitored.
All patients who are hospitalized for pain
should have an incentive spirometer at the
bedside. Ensure that the patient has been
instructed on its usage and can demonstrate
it appropriately.
Alternative methods of pain control
(behavior modiﬁcation, relaxation, visuali-
zation, self-hypnosis, and transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation) are helpful
adjuvants in the outpatient and inpatient
setting but should not replace standard
therapy. Children should have access to a
psychologist who is experienced in the man-
agement of sickle cell pain.
Drug addiction is extremely rare and
should not be a primary concern. The goal
should be to provide patients with ade-
quate relief by understanding the pharma-
cology of the medications, drug tolerance,
and physical dependence. Drug tolerance
is common, and withdrawal symptoms
after hospitalization are probably under-
reported by the patients. All patients
should start a narcotic taper while in the
hospital and complete this as an outpa-
tient. On average, patients admitted for the
management of VOE require 3 to 7 days of
inpatient care.
Acute chest syndrome/
pneumonia
Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is deﬁned as
the development of a new pulmonary inﬁl-
trate in the presence of fever or respiratory
symptoms. As chest radiograph changes may
be delayed, the diagnosis may not be appar-
ent at presentation. Approximately 50% of
children with sickle cell disease will have
acute chest syndrome. ACS is frequently
caused by community-acquired pathogens
such as chlamydia, mycoplasma, and other
bacterial or viral organisms. In older chil-
dren, adolescents, and young adults, ACS
may be more commonly associated with
vaso-occlusion, infarction, fat embolism, or
in situ sickling. These episodes are charac-
terized by chest pain, fever, hypoxia, and
pulmonary inﬁltrates. Although ACS usually
improves with medical management, it can
present with or progress rapidly to respira-
tory failure (acute respiratory distress syn-
drome), requiring mechanical ventilation
and emergent exchange transfusion.
Sixty percent of children who have pneu-
monia on X-ray will be missed by physical
exam alone. In addition, many children with
a negative chest ﬁlm on admission will
24
Chapter 3

develop ﬁndings after hydration. All chil-
dren who have symptoms of pulmonary
disease, such as fever, shortness of breath,
tachypnea, chest pain, cough, wheezing,
rales, or dullness to percussion, should
have an assessment of oxygen saturation,
a chest radiograph, receive parenteral anti-
biotics, and be admitted to the hospital
(see
Figure
3.2).
Bronchodilators
and
incentive spirometry are helpful adjuncts
in treatment and prevention of worsening
ACS. If there is an inﬁltrate, the patient
should be closely observed for hypoxia
and progression of pulmonary inﬁltrates,
with repeat chest radiographs. Overhydra-
tion can lead to pulmonary edema and
exacerbate acute chest syndrome. Over-
sedation with narcotics can also lead to

Children who have an episode of life threatening acute chest syndrome will need to be on 
hydroxyurea therapy or chronically transfused. In addition, they should be followed for 
evidence of pulmonary hypertension with cardiac echocardiography

count; ABG, arterial blood gas; ACS, acute chest syndrome).
Sickle Cell Disease
25

hypoventilation, increasing the risk for ACS.
Narcotics should be used with caution in
this setting.
Acute chest syndrome can develop in a
matter of hours and is associated with
a high rate of morbidity and mortality.
Children should have oxygen saturation
monitored
and,
if
indicated,
arterial
blood gases also. Oxygen therapy should
be used only for signiﬁcant hypoxia (O2
saturation  92%). Supplemental oxygen
can decrease erythropoietin production
and lead to more severe anemia. Pulmo-
nary infections should be treated aggres-
sively, and these children watched closely.
If there is no improvement, and/or wors-
ening anemia, a red blood cell transfusion
(straight or exchange, dependent upon
the severity of the hypoxia, anemia, and
clinical status of the patient) may help to
correct the anemia, decrease the percent
Hgb S, and improve oxygen-carrying
capacity to aid in reversing the pulmo-
nary sickling and improve the clinical
course. Transfusions are more effective
when administered early in the course
of ACS, rather than as a life-saving mea-
sure in a critically ill child.
There is a distinct difference between
the etiology of acute chest syndrome in
children and that of adolescents and
adults. In children, the incidence of acute
chest syndrome is seasonal, lower in the
summer months with increasing rates in
the winter when viral infections are prev-
alent. In adults and adolescents, ACS is
frequently a complication of an episode of
vaso-occlusion (without fever) due to
pulmonary fat embolism. This event will
progress to include chest pain, fever, and a
pulmonary inﬁltrate (usually basilar with
pleural effusion). Adults and adolescents
more frequently need transfusions and
less frequently have a viral or bacterial
infection associated with their episode
of acute chest syndrome. Individuals with
Hgb SC disease have relatively more fat
in their marrow and resultantly can have
more severe pulmonary fat emboli when
their course is complicated by acute chest
syndrome.
Stroke and other central nervous sys-
tem events are more common in children
with ACS in the 2 week period after the
event.
Laboratory evaluation of acute
chest syndrome
* CBC with differential and reticulocyte
count.
* Type and hold for possible blood trans-
fusion (phenotypically matched, sickledex
negative).
* Chest radiograph, as often as clinically
indicated
to
monitor
progression
of
disease.
* Continuous pulse oximetry and baseline
arterial blood gas (on room air if possible).
* Blood culture for fever.
Management
All patients with evidence of acute pulmo-
nary pathology should be admitted to the
hospital. If fever is present or if an infec-
tious process is suspected, antibiotic ther-
apy should be started immediately. See
Fever and Infection section, and Figures 3.1
and 3.2.
* Oxygen
Hypoxemic
patients
(PaO2
70
to
80 mmHg, O2 saturation 92%): 2 L/min
per nasal cannula.
Reevaluate arterial blood gas on oxygen.
* Antibiotics
Initiate broad spectrum antibiotic: cef-
triaxone 50 mg/kg/d IV every 24 hours
after blood cultures obtained (maximum
2 g/dose).
Due to the frequency of atypical organ-
isms (e.g., chlamydia and mycoplasma), a
26
Chapter 3

macrolide or quinolone antibiotic should
be included: azithromycin 10 mg/kg on day
1, followed by 5 mg/kg on days 2 to 5
(maximum 500 mg on day 1, 250 mg on
days 2 to 5).
* Analgesics
As indicated for vaso-occlusive pain man-
agement, administration must be moni-
tored to provide the maximum pain control
and prevent hypoventilation or atelectasis
from splinting or narcotization.
* Hydration
PO and IV hydration (D5W 1/2 NS) at a
maximum of 1.25 maintenance. Caution
should be used in patients with potential
acute chest syndrome to avoid ﬂuid over-
load. Monitor Is & Os, daily weight.
* Other supportive measures
Continuous pulse oximetry.
Incentive spirometry, 10 times an hour,
every hour while awake (prevention of
hypoventilation and atelectasis).
Albuterol
aerosols
q4
hours (airway
hyperreactivity common in ACS).
* Physical therapy
Warm packs.
Ambulation as tolerated, sitting up in bed.
* Transfusion
Straight transfusion.
Exchange transfusion (for patients with
hematocrit > 30% or moderate-to-severe
ACS to more efﬁciently reduce Hgb S%).
Transfusion decreases the proportion of
sickling red cells and increases blood oxygen
afﬁnity. The main indication is worsening
respiratory function, as documented by
hypoxemia (paO2 <70 mmHg on room air),
worsening chest pain, evolving clinical
examination, or worsening inﬁltrates on
chest radiography. For patients with chronic
hypoxemia, a drop of >10% from baseline
is a reasonable level at which to transfuse.
Delays in instituting transfusion therapy,
particularly in rapidly deteriorating patients,
should be avoided.
Priapism
Forty percent of men who are homozygous
for Hgb S report having priapism in their
adolescence and early adulthood. Priapism
has a second peak at 21 to 29 years. Priapism
is deﬁned as a painful erection that lasts for
more than 30 minutes. It frequently results
in interference with the urinary stream.
Priapism can be precipitated by prolonged
intercourse or masturbation, frequently
occurs at night, and can be differentiated
from a nocturnal erection by its duration
and pain. Children will occasionally com-
plain of dysuria as the ﬁrst complaint of
priapism. Prognosis is poorer in adolescents
and adults who have recurrent prolonged
priapism, and if aggressive treatment has
not been successful, impotence may result.
Children who have priapism generally have
a better prognosis than adolescents and
adults and usually do not have prolonged
episodes requiring aggressive therapy. Pria-
pism can occur with vaso-occlusive episodes
as well as with fever and sepsis.
Priapism can last for hours, days, or
weeks with moderate-to-severe pain, or it
can occur as a pattern of painful erections
that recur over a period of days to several
weeks (stuttering priapism). Chronic non-
painful priapism can also occur.
Since priapism can lead to impotence,
early medical management is indicated. A
urologist familiar with priapism in sickle cell
disease should be consulted. Treatment
includeshydration,painmanagement,intra-
cavernous injection of alpha-adrenergic
agents, exchange transfusion, and shunting
surgery. Oral alpha-adrenergics (e.g., pseu-
doephedrinehydrochloride30 mgBID)have
been used successfully to treat stuttering
priapism. Chronic transfusion therapy has
beenusedinpatientswithrecurrentpriapism
(maintenance of Hgb S below 30% to 40%),
although no controlled trials have been per-
formed proving the efﬁcacy of this therapy.

Stroke (cerebrovascular
accident)
Stroke is a common event in children
homozygous for Hgb S. Between 10% and
15% of children with sickle cell disease
suffer from overt strokes. In children,
strokes are more frequently the result of
cerebral vascular stenosis and infarction.
The mean age of occurrence of clinically
evident stroke is 7 to 8 years with the highest
risk occurring between 2 and 9 years. Hem-
orrhage and infarct may occur together.
Strokes in children who have sickle cell
disease involve stenosis and occlusion of the
major anterior arteries of the brain, includ-
ing the carotids. The presenting symptoms
of stroke can be dramatic and acute, such as
coma, seizure, hemiparesis, hemianesthesia,
visual ﬁeld deﬁcits, aphasia, or cranial nerve
palsies. Subtle limb weakness (without pain)
is often mistaken for an acute vaso-occlusive
episode but can be due to stroke. By deﬁ-
nition, the symptoms must persist for at
least 24 hours to be classiﬁed as a stroke. The
presentation of severe headache and vomit-
ing with no other neurological ﬁndings can
be symptoms of an intracranial hemorrhage.
Initially, a CT scan without contrast will
be normal for up to 6 hours after a stroke
but will rule out intracerebral hemorrhage,
abscess, tumor, or other pathology that
would explain the neurological symptoms.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are
much more sensitive methods to determine
intracranial infarct but can remain normal
for 2 to 4 hours after an event. All cata-
strophic neurological events should ﬁrst be
evaluated with CT since it is generally more
available and will rule out acute pathology.
With clinical concern prior to deﬁnitive
diagnosis by MRI/MRA imaging, children
are exchange transfused to achieve a con-
centration of Hgb S of less than 30%. Blood
pressure should be continually monitored
during an exchange transfusion realizing
that, relative to the normal population,
children with sickle cell disease are hypo-
tensive. The diagnosis of stroke in children
should initially be made based on clinical
ﬁndings and treated emergently. Children
should be monitored until they are stable
and
the
hemoglobin
electrophoresis
is
documented. Those who have had a stroke
require chronic transfusion therapy for an
undetermined length of time.
Children with sickle cell disease have
more frequent and more severe headaches
than other children; these may be manifes-
tations of cerebral hypoxia and vasodilation.
Children who have severe headaches accom-
panied by vomiting need extensive evalua-
tion with imaging as well as neurologic and
neuropsychological testing.
Transcranial Doppler (TCD) has been
shown to predict increased risk of stroke in
children who have increased ﬂow velocity in
major cerebral arteries. Unsuspected cere-
bral vascular damage was detected by CT
and MRI in 25% to 30% of children in the
Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease. No
clinical factors, with the exception of tran-
scranial Doppler, predicted the occurrence
of stroke. In this study, there was a corre-
lation between ﬁrst stroke and transient
ischemic attack, acute chest syndrome, ele-
vated systolic blood pressure, and severe
anemia. All children who can cooperate
with transcranial Doppler (usually by 2 years
of age) should have an annual evaluation
if the study is available locally. Normal
middle cerebral artery velocity in children
with sickle cell disease is approximately
120 cm/s. Children who have velocities of
170 to 199 cm/s are considered at high risk
and those with velocities 200 cm/s are at
highest
risk.
The
STOP
trial
(Stroke
Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia)
showed that transfusion greatly reduces the
risk of ﬁrst stroke in children who have
abnormally high TCD velocity (200cm/s).
28
Chapter 3

Prophylactic chronic transfusion should be
strongly considered if there are two studies
at least 2 weeks apart with velocities 200
cm/s.
Compliance
issues
and
risks
of
chronic transfusions must also be consid-
ered when deciding on this therapy.
Transient ischemic attacks are deﬁned
as focal neurological deﬁcits with a vascular
distribution persisting for less than 24
hours, although they typically last less than
an hour. Patients with transient ischemic
attacks are treated in a similar manner to
those who have an infarct. The diagnosis is
made in retrospect when the follow-up MRI
is negative for a persistent lesion that would
explain the neurological symptoms.
Intracerebral hemorrhage or subarach-
noid hemorrhage may present without
focal
neurologic
symptoms.
Exchange
transfusion should be carried out immedi-
ately. Arteriography is used to identify the
arterial bleed and the patient may need
emergent surgical intervention. Mortality
is very high during the acute event (50%).
Acute anemia
There are two common causes of acute life-
threatening anemia in sickle cell disease:
splenic sequestration and aplastic crisis.
Splenic sequestration
Infants and young children who have Hgb
SS and Sb0 thalassemia and older children
(over 10 years) who have Hgb SC or Sb þ
thalassemia syndromes can have intrasple-
nic pooling of large amounts of blood and
platelets. This can lead to anemia, throm-
bocytopenia, hypovolemia, cardiovascular
collapse, and sudden death within hours
of the onset of sequestration. The syndrome
has been reported in infants as young as 2
months of age. Classically, however, it
occurs in children with Hgb SS after the
disappearance of Hgb F from approximately
6 months to 3 years of age when the spleen
becomes ﬁbrotic due to multiple infarc-
tions. These crises can occur in older chil-
dren who have Hgb SC or Sb þ thalassemia
but are usually not as severe; still, fatal
events have been recorded for these chil-
dren. The incidence is between 10% and
30% and the recurrence rate is 50%. Mild
events can indicate the possibility of life-
threatening sequestration events. Chronic
sequestration can also be a sequelae with
chronic anemia and thrombocytopenia.
The clinical presentation is usually rapid
in onset; the child will typically have sudden
weakness, pallor of the lips and mucous
membranes, breathlessness, rapid pulse,
faintness, and abdominal fullness. Evalua-
tion of the CBC will frequently show a
precipitous
drop
from
the
baseline
hemoglobin.
The treatment for splenic sequestration
is transfusion to restore circulating blood
volume, usually with phenotypically mat-
ched blood (unless there is a life-threatening
situation). As the shock is reversed and
thetransfusedblooddecreasesthepercentage
of Hgb S, the splenomegaly regresses and
much of the blood is remobilized with a
rapid rise in the child’s hemoglobin.
Splenectomy should be strongly consid-
ered in all children who have a splenic
sequestration
crisis.
Transfusions
can
prevent recurrence until surgery can be
arranged. Some children who have Hgb
SS and older children who have other S
hemoglobinopathies
can
have
massive
splenomegaly with hypersplenism after an
episode of splenic sequestration. If hypers-
plenism (with resultant anemia, neutrope-
nia, or thrombocytopenia) is persistent
and severe, splenectomy is indicated.
Prior to splenectomy, younger children
should have an evaluation of splenic func-
tion with a pit count and a spleen scan. In
normally eusplenic persons, fewer than 1%
of the circulating red cells are pitted; values
Sickle Cell Disease
29

of 2% to 12% may represent decreased
splenic function. If they still have a func-
tional spleen, usually under 2 years of age, a
partial splenectomy can be performed. Chil-
dren should have appropriate immuniza-
tions, including pneumococcal and menin-
gococcal vaccinations, prior to splenectomy.
Penicillin prophylaxis is continued indeﬁ-
nitely in all children who have been
splenectomized.
Aplastic crisis
Severe anemia can develop over several days
due to shortened red cell survival without
compensatory reticulocytosis. Reticulocyto-
penia can last 7 to 10 days. The primary
cause of transient red cell aplasia is parvo-
virus B19, though it can follow other viral
infections as well. Parvovirus B19, the most
common cause of aplasia in children with
hemoglobinopathies, can also cause neutro-
penia. While many patients recover spon-
taneously, the anemia can be profound. Red
cell transfusion is indicated for those who
become symptomatic from anemia or if the
hemoglobin falls 2 g/dL or more from base-
line. Symptoms occurring with aplastic cri-
sis include nausea and vomiting, myalgias,
and arthralgias. Splenic and hepatic seques-
tration have also been reported with aplastic
crises. If the ability to follow-up is of con-
cern, the child should be hospitalized for
observation. The patient should be isolated
from other patients with chronic hemolytic
anemias (sickle cell disease or thalassemia)
or red cell aplasia and should not have
pregnant caregivers. If the child is mildly
anemic and asymptomatic, outpatient mon-
itoring is reasonable.
Avascular necrosis
Bone pain is common in sickle cell disease.
Marrow infarcts can cause pain that can
last for weeks. Avascular necrosis (osteone-
crosis) causes pain that can sometimes be
confused with a bone infarct. Symptoms of
avascular necrosis, such as limping, can
sometimes be confused with stroke. Limp-
ing with weakness but without pain is
stroke not avascular necrosis.
Avascular necrosis is common in all age
groups but is more frequently diagnosed in
the adolescent and usually involves the
humeral and femoral heads. It is more
common in individuals who have Hgb
Sb0 thalassemia and Hgb SS with alpha-
thalassemia. It is also seen, though with a
lower frequency, in those who have Hgb
Sb þ thalassemia. Individuals who have Hgb
SS are more frequently affected than those
with Hgb SC.
Avascular necrosis is a result of an infarct
in the cancellous trabeculae in the head of
either the femur or the humerus. The pro-
cess of necrosis and repair can be progres-
sive, leading to collapse of the head or arrest
with varying degrees of disability and scle-
rosis. Below is a method of describing the
progression of avascular necrosis:
Stage 0: no evidence of disease
Stage 1: X-ray normal, bone scan abnormal,
MRI abnormal
Stage 2: X-ray: sclerosis and cystic changes
without collapse
Stage 3: Subchondral collapse (crescent
sign) without collapse
Stage 4: Collapse and ﬂattening of the fem-
oral head without acetabular involve-
ment, normal joint space
Stage 5: Joint narrowing and/or acetabular
involvement
Stage 6: Increased joint narrowing and/or
acetabular involvement
Treatment for avascular necrosis of the
femur includes bed rest with crutch walking
for 6 weeks, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), and core decompression
30
Chapter 3

surgery for stages 1 or 2. Extensive physical
therapy has been found to be beneﬁcial but
is often difﬁcult to perform. Decompression
surgery is relatively simple; a core is
removed from the head of the femur.
The coring begins approximately 2 cm
below the trochanteric ridge extending
through the neck and into the head of the
femur. Acutely this procedure provides
relief of pain and is thought to arrest the
progression of avascular necrosis; however,
this has not been conﬁrmed in a prospective
trial.
Higher
stage
avascular
necrosis
requires joint replacement.
Retinopathy/Hyphema
The eye is particularly sensitive to hypoxia.
Vaso-occlusion of retinal vessels and hyp-
oxia of the retina cause permanent retinal
damage. Blood in the anterior chamber of
the eye (hyphema) becomes rapidly deoxy-
genated and permanently sickled, obstruct-
ing the outﬂow from the aqueous humor.
The accumulation of aqueous humor in the
anterior chamber increases intraocular pres-
sure leading to decreased blood ﬂow to the
retina until the perfusion pressure of the
globe is reached. This leads to sudden vas-
cular stasis and blindness. The events occur-
ring in hyphema can also occur in children
who have sickle cell trait.
Retinal vascular occlusion initially occurs
in peripheral retinal vessels without signiﬁ-
cant sequelae. It eventually leads to neovas-
cularization from the retina into the vitreous
(sea fans). These abnormal vessels are fragile
and can bleed into the vitreous causing
“ﬂoaters” or blindness if the hemorrhage is
sufﬁcient. If bleeds do not obscure vision and
are unnoticed, they can cause collapse of the
vitreous, traction on the retina, and eventu-
ally cause retinal detachment. Retinal disease
of the eye is common in sickle cell disease. It
occurs most commonly in individuals who
have Hgb SC.
Treatment of sickle cell retinopathy
requires recognition. The damaged periph-
eral vessels are not generally appreciated by
direct ophthalmic examination and require
the use of indirect binocular stereoscopic
ophthalmoscopy.
Sea
fanning,
vitreous
hemorrhage, and retinal detachment can
be observed by direct ophthalmoscopy.
Annual
ophthalmic
evaluations
should
begin at age 10 for all children with sickle
cell disease. Treatment of early neovascular-
ization requires laser photocoagulation.
Surgical
approaches
are
required
for
advanced lesions.
Hyphema is a medical emergency in
sickle cell disease. It requires immediate
ophthalmic
evaluation
and
transfusion
(exchange or straight) to reduce sickling
and improve oxygenation. If a conservative
approach is not successful, anterior cham-
ber paracentesis is performed to relieve
intraocular
pressure
and
remove
the
hyphema.
Hyperbilirubinemia /Gallstones
Bilirubin
gallstones
can
eventually
be
detected in most patients with chronic
hemolytic anemia. In sickle cell disease,
gallstones occur in children as young as 3
to 4 years of age, and are eventually found in
approximately 70% of patients. It may be
difﬁcult to differentiate between gallbladder
disease and abdominal vaso-occlusive crisis
in patients with recurrent abdominal pain.
Cholecystectomy may be necessary for
patients with fat intolerance, presence of
gallstones, and recurrent abdominal pain.
Hepatomegaly and liver dysfunction
may be caused by a combination of intra-
hepatic
trapping
of
sickled
cells,
transfusion-acquired
infection,
or
Sickle Cell Disease
31

transfusional hemosiderosis. The combina-
tion of hemolysis, liver dysfunction, and
renal tubular defects can result in very high
bilirubin levels. Benign cholestasis of sickle
cell disease results in severe asymptomatic
hyperbilirubinemia without fever, pain, leu-
kocytosis, or hepatic failure.
Perioperative management of
sickle cell patients
Following are guidelines for the manage-
ment of sickle cell patients who have sur-
gical procedures or require anesthesia for
other purposes. General anesthesia results
in atelectasis and hypoxia, which is poorly
tolerated by the patient with sickle cell
disease; therefore, special precautions must
be taken perioperatively to decrease mor-
bidity and mortality associated with even
minor surgical procedures. Other risk fac-
tors include the presence of chronic organ
damage in some patients, the effects of asple-
nia, and the propensity for sickling and
obstruction of microvasculature with even
mild hypoxia. The guidelines suggested
below are extrapolated from a multicenter
randomized trial of transfusion (exchange vs
straight) in the perioperative period.
Preoperative care
1. Admission to the hospital the afternoon
prior to scheduled surgery.
2. Hydration at 1.25 maintenance (IV þ
PO) the evening and night prior to surgery.
3. Pulse
oximetry
on
room
air
(spot
checks).
4. Incentive spirometry at least 10 times per
hour while awake.
5. Lab work: CBC with differential and
reticulocyte count, urinalysis, type and
cross, chemistry panel.
6. Transfusion:
All
sickle
cell
patients
should
have
a
red
cell
phenotype
study obtained prior to any transfusion.
Sickle cell patients should receive pheno-
typically matched blood to decrease the
risk of alloimmunization. In addition, all
blood should be sickledex negative and
leukodepleted. The following transfusion
guidelines
are
recommended.
See
also
Chapter 5.
a. Patients with Hgb SS or Sb0 disease
who are undergoing any procedure other
than
myringotomy
tube
placement
should have a simple transfusion to
achieve a hemoglobin of 10 to 12 g/dL.
Do not exceed 12 g/dL due to the risk of
stasis/sludging.
b. Patients with Hgb SC disease or Sb þ
who have baseline hemoglobin below
10 g/dL may need transfusions to achieve
a hemoglobin of 10 to 12 g/dL. However,
do not transfuse these patients prior to
consulting the hematologist. Many fac-
tors may affect this decision including a
history of signiﬁcant complications of
their sickle cell disease (i.e., pneumonia,
vaso-occlusive episodes, priapism, and
aseptic necrosis).
c. Consult the hematologist if there is
confusion regarding individual patients.
7. Patients with central venous catheters or
those undergoing dental procedures should
receive
antibiotic
prophylaxis
prior
to
surgery.
Postoperative care
1. Adequate pain management to prevent
splinting and atelectasis, with care to pre-
vent narcosis.
2. Pulse oximetry for at least the ﬁrst 12 to
24 hours postoperatively.
3. Incentive spirometry at least 10 times per
hour while awake. Be aggressive!
4. Ambulation as early as possible, taking
into account the speciﬁc surgical procedure.
5. Lab work: CBC with reticulocyte count
daily.

6. Follow-up
in
clinic
approximately
1 week post-hospital discharge or sooner
if there are ongoing problems.
Transfusion therapy
Red blood cell transfusion increases oxygen-
carrying capacity and improves microvas-
cular perfusion by decreasing the propor-
tion of sickle red cells (Hgb S%). Transfu-
sions are given to patients with sickle cell
disease to stabilize or reverse an acute med-
ical complication, or as part of chronic
therapy in certain situations to prevent
future complications.
Indications
Acute illnesses
Splenic sequestration
Transient red cell aplasia
Hyperhemolysis (infection, ACS)
Patients should be transfused if there is
evidence
of
cardiovascular
compromise
(heart failure, dyspnea, hypertension, or
marked fatigue). Generally, transfusion is
indicated if the hemoglobin falls below 5 g/
dL or drops greater than 2 g/dL from the
steady state.
Sudden severe illness
Acute chest syndrome
Stroke
Sepsis
Acute multiorgan failure
These life-threatening illnesses are often
accompanied by a falling hemoglobin.
Transfusion therapy has become standard
medical practice in the management of
these illnesses. When ACS is associated with
hypoxia and a falling hemoglobin, transfu-
sion is indicated. Many patients can be
treated with straight transfusion, though
in severe cases, exchange transfusion or red
cell pheresis is recommended. Studies sug-
gest early transfusion may prevent progres-
sion of acute pulmonary disease.
The efﬁcacy of transfusion in the man-
agement of acute stroke has not been well
studied, though anecdotal reports indicate
that early exchange transfusion may limit
neuronal damage by improving local oxy-
genation and perfusion. Chronic transfu-
sion therapy reduces the rate of recurrence
and is indicated in all patients after a ﬁrst
stroke.
Perioperative transfusion
Patients with sickle cell anemia undergoing
major surgery should be prepared in
advance by transfusion to a hemoglobin
of approximately 10 g/dL and a decrease
in Hgb S% to approximately 60%. While
standard
practice
guidelines
have
not
been developed for Hgb SS patients under-
going minor procedures or those with Hgb
SC, it is generally acceptable to not trans-
fuse these patients, assuming they are med-
ically stable.
Chronic transfusion therapy
Chronic
transfusions
are
indicated
in
several conditions in which the potential
medical complications warrant the risks
of alloimmunization, infection, and trans-
fusional iron overload. Transfusions are
given every 3 to 4 weeks, with a goal to
maintain the Hgb S% at 30% to 50%. While
straight transfusions are acceptable, red cell
pheresis or exchange transfusions may be
preferred to decrease the rate of iron
overload.
Indications
1. Primary stroke prevention
2. Pulmonary hypertension/chronic lung
disease
3. Frequent ACS
4. Chronic debilitating pain
Sickle Cell Disease
33

Other indications for transfusions:
Transfusions are sometimes suggested for
a number of conditions in which efﬁcacy is
unproven,butmaybeconsideredundersevere
circumstances. Such circumstances include:
Acute priapism
Pregnancy (frequent complications)
“Silent” cerebral infarcts
Leg ulcers
Hydroxyurea therapy
Hydroxyurea (HU) was originally utilized as
an antineoplastic agent, but due to its effects
on increasing fetal hemoglobin (Hgb F), it
has gained favor in the treatment of patients
with
sickle
cell
disease.
Hydroxyurea’s
mechanism of action is not clearly under-
stood; however, it is thought that inhibition
of ribonucleotide reductase leads to down-
stream cytotoxicity of erythroid progenitors
leading to upregulation of fetal hemoglobin
production.
In
addition,
hydroxyurea’s
cytotoxic effects lead to leukopenia and
neutropenia, beneﬁcial in sickle cell disease
secondary to the viscous properties of these
cells during vaso-occlusion.
Long-term adult studies have shown no
signiﬁcant complications of HU usage and it
is being used more commonly in pediatric
patients with sickle cell disease. Current
recommendations for HU usage include the
following:
* Frequent episodes of VOE including
dactylitis
* Acute chest syndrome
* Chronic hypoxia
* Low hemoglobin and Hgb F
* Signs of increased hemolysis (increased
LDH and total bilirubin)
* Abnormal TCD or history of stroke with
refusal for chronic transfusion therapy
As experience grows with HU therapy,
practitioners are recommending HU as
prophylaxis in more patients. Some would
argue that all patients with hemoglobin SS
and Sb0 thalassemia should be on HU ther-
apy; this may become the standard of care in
the near future.
HU therapy begins at 20mg/kg/d and
should be titrated based on beneﬁcial incre-
ment in Hgb F% and resultant increase in
hemoglobin and MCV. Potential toxicities
with HU therapy that should be monitored
closely include neutropenia, leukopenia, and
anemia. Elevation in ALT and thrombocyto-
penia can also occur, though less commonly.
Hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantion in sickle cell disease
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantion is
curative for patients with sickle cell disease
and should be considered in young patients
with hemoglobin SS and Sb0 thalassemia
and a matched sibling donor.
Patients with severe manifestations of
sickle cell disease including multiple pain
episodes, recurrent ACS, stroke, and end-
organ damage should be considered for
unrelated bone marrow or umbilical cord
blood transplantation when a matched sib-
ling donor is not available.
Case study for review
You are a primary care physician taking care
of a 2-year-old with known sickle cell disease
(Hgb SS). You are counseling the family on
particular risks for the patient at this age.
1. What are some of the main areas of
discussion?
In evaluating the patient as a whole, one
must ﬁrst discuss growth and development
and the risks of low hemoglobin on brain
development. Assuming the patient has had
previous laboratory studies, past hemoglobin
34
Chapter 3

values can help objectively guide this discus-
sion as phenotypic disease is related to level
of anemia and concomitant reticulocytosis,
amount of leukocytosis, as well as evidence
ofhemolysis(total bilirubin and LDHlevels).
In this discussion, newer treatment modali-
ties including hydroxyurea therapy and the
potential for hematopoietic stem cell trans-
plantation should be discussed.
Fortunately, this child has had a relatively
benign course to date.
2. What are some of the potential acute
risks that should again be discussed with
the family?
The major risks to the child include severe
infection, pain including dactylitis, and
splenic sequestration. These risks should all
be discussed in detail with the family.
In terms of severe infection, the family
should be aware that they should monitor
the child closely if the child appears ill and
check the temperature before administering
antipyretics, even if given for pain alone. In
addition, they should be aware that if the
childappearsill,theyshould immediatelycall
the on-call physician and will likely require
immediate evaluation including blood work,
chestradiography,parenteralantibiotics,and
hospital admission and observation. You
should again reinforce the need for the child
to be on penicillin prophylaxis. Finally, one
should review the child’s vaccinations to
ensure they are up to date, especially for
encapsulated bacteria including S. pneumo-
niae, H. inﬂuenzae, and N. meningitidis.
Regarding episodes of pain, although it is
reassuring the child has had a relatively unre-
markable course to date, VOE can start at any
age. At 2 years of age, the child is still at risk
for developing episodes of dactylitis. The
family should be advised on the signs and
symptoms to monitor for pain in a young
childwhichmaypresentasirritability, refusal
to walk, decreased appetite, as well as local-
ized swelling and/or tenderness. A pain plan
should be established with the family which
should include the availability of oral med-
ications at home (e.g., acetaminophen, ibu-
profen, Tylenol with codeine, and/or Lortab
elixir) as well as adjuvant strategies such as
warm bath and heating pads.
Finally, the practitioner should discuss
other potential acute complications such as
splenic sequestration. If the child has a pal-
pable spleen, the family should be advised on
the current size and to monitor for changes
in size if the patient appears to be pale or
weak. In addition, if the child does appear
to have these symptoms without a change
in the size of the spleen or does not have a
palpable spleen, the family should be advised
that these symptoms should again lead to
prompt evaluation as they could be signs of
splenic sequestration or an aplastic crisis.

Thalassemia
The thalassemias are a diverse group of
genetic diseases characterized by absent or
decreased production of normal hemoglo-
bin, resulting in a microcytic anemia. The
alpha-thalassemias
are
concentrated
in
Southeast Asia, Malaysia, and southern
China. The beta-thalassemias are seen pri-
marily in the Mediterranean, Africa, and in
Southeast Asia. Due to global migration
patterns, there is an increase in the incidence
of thalassemia in North America, primarily
because of immigration from Southeast
Asia. Like with sickle cell anemia, develop-
ment of thalassemia is directly related to
evolutionary pressure secondary to malaria.
Normally, 95% of adult hemoglobin
found on electrophoresis is Hgb A (a2b2).
Two minor hemoglobins occur: 2% to 3.5%
is Hgb A2 (a2d2) and 2% is Hgb F (a2g2).
A mutation affecting globin chain produc-
tion or deletion of one of the globin chains
leads to a decreased production of that
chain and an abnormal globin ratio. The
globin that is produced in normal amounts
is in excess and forms aggregates or inclu-
sions within the red cells. These aggregates
become oxidized and damage the cell mem-
brane leading to ineffective erythropoiesis,
hemolysis, or both. The quantity and prop-
erties of these globin chain aggregates deter-
mine the phenotypic characteristics of the
thalassemia.
An excess of alpha-globin chains (beta-
thalassemia) leads to the formation of
alpha-globin tetramers that accumulate in
the erythroblast. These aggregates are very
insoluble and precipitation of these aggre-
gates interferes with erythropoiesis, cell
maturation, and cell membrane function
leading to ineffective erythropoiesis and
anemia.
An excess of beta-globin chains (alpha-
thalassemia) leads to tetramers of beta-
globin, Hgb H. These tetramers are more
stable and soluble, but as the red cell ages in
the circulation and, under conditions of
oxidant stress, Hgb H precipitates and inter-
feres with cell membrane function leading
to an increase in hemolysis.
Alpha-thalassemia
The alpha-thalassemias are caused by a
decrease in the production of alpha-globin
due to a deletion or mutation of one or more
of the four alpha-globin genes located on
chromosome
16.
Alpha-gene
mapping
can be obtained to determine the speciﬁc
mutation. The alpha-thalassemias are cate-

alpha-thalassemia trait in a parent is discov-
ered after the birth of an affected child.
Silent carrier status is characterized by
three
functional
genes
for
a-globin:
(a/aa). Outside the newborn period, it
is not possible to make this diagnosis by
conventional methods. There is overlap
between the red blood cell indices of these
individuals and normals, although the MCV
may be slightly lower. This state is deduced
when a “normal” individual has a child with
Hgb H disease or with microcytic anemia
consistent with alpha-thalassemia trait. An
unusual case of the silent carrier state is the
individual who carries the hemoglobin con-
stant spring mutation (acsa/aa or aacs/aa).
This is an elongated a-globin due to a
termination codon mutation. Individuals
who have this mutation have normal red
blood cell indices, but can have children
who have Hgb H-constant spring if the
other parent has alpha-thalassemia trait
(aa/). Generally, these children are more
affected clinically than other children who
have Hgb H.
Individuals who have alpha-thalassemia
trait (a/–a) or (aa/) are identiﬁed by
microcytosis, erythrocytosis, hypochromia,
and mild anemia. The diagnosis is made
by genetic studies, ruling out both iron-
deﬁciency
anemia
and
beta-thalassemia
trait. In the neonatal period, when hemo-
globin Bart’s (g4) is present (5% on
newborn screen), the diagnosis can be sus-
pected. In children, there are no markers
such as elevated Hgb A2 and Hgb F (as seen
in beta-thalassemia trait) to make the diag-
nosis. The diagnosis is one of exclusion and
is often mistaken for iron-deﬁciency anemia
secondary to the microcytosis. Clues for the
diagnosis include a normal RDW and an
increase in red blood cells for the level of
hemoglobin. During pregnancy, the micro-
cytic anemia can be mistaken for anemia of
pregnancy, and may be a clue for a family
history of alpha-thalassemia trait.
Hemoglobin H (/a) should be con-
sidered in the case of a neonate in whom all
of the red blood cells are very hypochromic.
Neonates who have Hgb H will also have a
high percentage of Hgb Bart’s on their
newborn screen (20%). In children, this
hemoglobinopathy is characterized by mod-
erate anemia with a hemoglobin in the 8 to
10 g/dL range, hypochromia, microcytosis,
red cell fragmentation, and a fast migrating
hemoglobin (Hgb H) on electrophoresis.
Hemoglobin H does not function as a
normal hemoglobin, and has a high oxygen
afﬁnity, so the measuredhemoglobin in these
children is misleading. Individuals who have
Hgb H generally have a persistent stable
state of anemia that may be accentuated by
increased hemolysis during viral infections
and by exposure to oxidant medications,
chemicals, and foods such as sulfa-drugs,
benzene, and Fava beans, similar to indivi-
duals who have G6PD deﬁciency. As the red
cells mature, they lose their ability to with-
stand oxidant stress and Hgb H precipitates,
leading to hemolysis. Therapy for individuals
who have Hgb H disease includes folate,
avoidance of oxidant drugs and foods,
genetic counseling, education, and frequent
medical care. Uncommon occurrences in a
child with Hgb H would be severe anemia,
cholelithiasis, skin ulceration, and spleno-
megaly requiring splenectomy. Unlike indi-
viduals who have beta-thalassemia, hemosi-
derosis is rare in Hgb H disease.
Children with hemoglobin H-constant
spring (/acsa or acs–/a–) have a more
severe course than children who have Hgb
H. They have a more severe anemia, with a
steady-state hemoglobin ranging between 7
and 8 g/dL. They more frequently have
splenomegaly and severe anemia with febrile
illnesses and viral infections, often requiring
transfusion. If anemia is chronically severe
and the child has splenomegaly, a splenec-
tomy may be performed. If splenectomy is
anticipated, a complication can be severe
Thalassemia
37

postsplenectomy
thrombocytosis
with
hypercoagulability leading to thrombosis
of the splenic vein or hepatic veins. This
complication has also been reported as
recurrent pulmonary emboli and clotting
diathesis. Children who are scheduled to
have surgery are treated with low-molecular-
weight heparin, followed by low-dose aspi-
rin, continued indeﬁnitely.
The most severe form of alpha-thalasse-
mia is alpha-thalassemia major (/).
This diagnosis is frequently made in the last
months of pregnancy when fetal ultrasound
indicates a hydropic fetus. The mother fre-
quently exhibits toxemia and can develop
severe
postpartum
hemorrhage.
These
infants are usually stillborn. There can be
other congenital anomalies, though none
are pathognomonic for alpha-thalassemia
major. Because of in utero hypoxia, the
hemoglobins found in these infants are Hgb
Portland (z2g2), Hgb H (b4), and Hgb Bart’s
(g4), and no Hgb A or A2. These babies can
have other complications associated with
hydrops such as heart failure and pulmo-
nary edema.
If the diagnosis is made early, intrauter-
ine transfusions can be performed. There
are reports of survival with chronic trans-
fusion in these infants, now more recently
replaced by curative hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation.
Undoubtedly,
more
of
these infants could be saved if the diagnosis
was anticipated by prenatal diagnosis and
the treatment provided.
Beta-thalassemia
Beta-thalassemia is caused by mutations in
the beta-globin gene. Although there have
been hundreds of mutations identiﬁed
within the beta-globin gene locus, about
20 different alleles make up about 80% of
the mutations found worldwide. Within
each
geographic
population,
there
are
unique mutations. Individuals with beta-
thalassemia major are usually homozygous
for one of the common mutations (as well as
having one of the geographically unique
mutations) that lead to the absence of
beta-chain production.
The beta-thalassemia syndromes are
much more diverse than the alpha-thalassemia
syndromes due to the diversity of the
mutations that produce the defects in the
beta-globin gene. Unlike the deletions that
constitute most of the alpha-thalassemia
syndromes, beta-thalassemias are caused
by mutations on chromosome 11 that affect
all aspects of beta-globin production: tran-
scription, translation, and the stability of the
beta-globin product. Most hematologists
feel there are three general categories of
beta-thalassemia:
beta-thalassemia
trait,
beta-thalassemia
intermedia,
and
beta-
thalassemia major. However, with the lack
of genotypic differentiation, there remains
phenotypic overlap between these three
general categories.
Splice site mutations also occur and are
of clinical consequence when combined
with a thalassemia mutation. Three splice
site mutations occur in exon 1 of the beta-
globin gene. These mutations result in three
different abnormal hemoglobins: Malay, E,
and Knossos. Hemoglobin E is a very com-
mon abnormal hemoglobin in the Southeast
Asian population and when paired with a
b0-thalassemia,
mutation
can
produce
severe transfusion-dependent thalassemia.
Hemoglobin E is described in the section
on newborn screening.
Individuals who have beta-thalassemia
trait have microcytosis and hypochromia;
there may be targeting and elliptocytosis,
though some individuals have an almost
normal smear. These hematologic features
can be accentuated in women with trait who
are pregnant and individuals who are folate
or iron deﬁcient. If iron deﬁciency is con-
current with beta-thalassemia trait, there
38
Chapter 4

may be a normal Hgb A2. Iron deﬁciency
causes decreased hemoglobin production
and folate or vitamin B12 deﬁciency can
lead to megaloblastic anemia with increased
Hgb A2. Both of these deﬁciencies need to be
treated prior to evaluation for thalassemia
trait. In iron-, B12-, and folate-replete indi-
viduals, the Hgb A2 can be as high as 3.5% to
8% and the Hgb F as high as 2% to 5%.
Generally, beta-thalassemia trait is milder in
African-Americans (who frequently have a
promoter gene mutation) but has a similar
presentation in individuals of Chinese,
Southeast Asian, Greek, Italian, and Middle
Eastern heritage.
Infants born in most states in the United
States are screened for hemoglobinopathies.
In states without newborn screening for
hemoglobinopathies and in recent immi-
grants to this country, affected children are
frequently found later than the newborn
period, and the evaluation of their micro-
cytic anemia includes differentiation bet-
ween iron deﬁciency and beta-thalassemia
trait. The red blood cell indices can be
helpful in this differentiation as the hemo-
globin concentration and the red cell count
will generally be lower in iron deﬁciency.
The distinguishing ﬁnding in beta-thalasse-
mia is a hemoglobin electrophoresis with an
elevated Hgb A2 and F. Both will be
increased in beta-thalassemia trait without
iron deﬁciency, and will be normal or
decreased in alpha-thalassemia and isolated
iron-deﬁciency anemia. There are several
formulas to help in ofﬁce screening, but
they are also based on the assumption that
the child is not iron deﬁcient. Usually, iron
deﬁciency can be ruled out using free
erythrocyte protoporphyrin, transferrin sat-
uration, or ferritin as a screening test in
children who have a hypochromic microcytic
anemia. The least expensive test is a trial of
iron and a repeat hemogram after a month. A
lead level should be obtained if there is an
index of suspicion for lead toxicity.
Problems can still arise if both alpha- and
beta-thalassemia coexist since the changes in
Hgb A2 and F will not be apparent as noted
above. Family studies and DNA analysis can
be used to make a deﬁnitive diagnosis.
Children who are diagnosed with thalas-
semia intermedia have a homozygous or
heterozygous
beta-globin
mutation
that
causes a greater decrease in beta-chain pro-
duction than seen in thalassemia minor, but
not to the degree for which chronic transfu-
sion therapy is required. The phenotype can
also occur in children who have a mutation
that increases production of a-globin, in
children who have coinherited alpha- and
beta-thalassemia, and in other rarer muta-
tions.
Children
who
have
thalassemia
intermedia are able to maintain a hemoglo-
bin of 7 g/dL or slightly higher with a greatly
expanded erythron and may manifest bony
deformities,
pathological
fractures,
and
growth retardation. Children who have thal-
assemia intermedia can also have delayed
pubescence, exercise intolerance, leg ulcers,
inﬂammatory arthritis, and extramedullary
hematopoiesis causing spinal cord compres-
sion—a medical emergency requiring radia-
tion therapy and transfusion. They can also
have iron overload due to increased absorp-
tion of iron from the gastrointestinal tract
and intermittent transfusion. They are at risk
for the cardiac and endocrine complications
of hemosiderosis, but usually at an older age
than chronically transfused children. Chela-
tion therapy is indicated for increasing fer-
ritin and elevated liver iron.
Children who cannot maintain a hemo-
globin between 6 and 7 g/dL should have an
alternative diagnosis considered. If thalas-
semia is the cause of the anemia, transfusion
and/or splenectomy should be considered.
Frequently,
adolescents
and
adults
are
unable to tolerate the degree of anemia
that is seen in thalassemia intermedia.
Hypersplenism, splenic pain, congestive
heart failure, severe exercise intolerance,
Thalassemia
39

thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia should
be considered indications for transfusion
and splenectomy.
Appropriate
clinical
management
of
thalassemia intermedia patients may be
more difﬁcult than patients with thalasse-
mia major requiring chronic transfusion
due to phenotypic heterogeneity. Patients
with clinically mild disease still may have
serious
long-term
complications
as
described above due to ineffective erythro-
poiesis as well as chronic hemolysis, leading
to pulmonary hypertension with resultant
congestive heart failure and thrombosis in
addition to cholelithiasis. Currently, trans-
fusion therapy is limited to patients with
symptomatic anemia or in children with
delayed growth and development and is
generally tailored to the individual patient.
Hydroxyurea has been utilized as in sickle
cell anemia, increasing Hgb F and obviating
some of the need for transfusion. Splenec-
tomy has been utilized but now is thought to
be at least partly responsible for the devel-
opment of pulmonary hypertension and
thrombosis secondary to chronic hemolysis.
Some argue that transfusion therapy is
underutilized in thalassemia intermedia and
improved risk stratiﬁcation is needed.
Thalassemia major was ﬁrst described
by a Detroit pediatrician, Thomas Cooley,
in 1925. The clinical picture he described is
prevalent today in countries without the
necessary resources to provide patients with
chronic transfusions and iron chelation
therapy. Children who have untreated thal-
assemia major have ineffective erythropoi-
esis, decreased red cell deformability, and
enhanced clearance of defective red cells by
macrophages. The result is a very hypermet-
abolic bone marrow with thrombocytosis,
leukocytosis, and microcytic anemia in the
young child prior to the enlargement of
their spleen. At presentation, they have
almost 100% Hgb F (these cells have a
longer life span due to a balanced globin
ratio as g, rather than b, globin is present in
Hgb F). These children have little or no Hgb
A2 and a low reticulocyte count. The diag-
nosis can be made with certainty by dem-
onstrating thalassemia trait in both parents,
by
globin
biosynthetic
ratios,
or
by
beta-gene screening. Beta-gene screening
identiﬁes the most common and some
uncommon mutations, but not all muta-
tions. An electrophoresis showing only Hgb
F, a complete blood count, and a peripheral
blood smear will generally be diagnostic. In
most states, these children will be discovered
by newborn screening or occasionally by the
obstetrician who makes a diagnosis of thal-
assemia trait in the mother and obtains a
family history of thalassemia or anemia in
both parents prior to the birth of the baby.
Children who have untreated thalasse-
mia die in the ﬁrst decade of life from
anemia, septicemia, and pathologic frac-
tures. When palliative transfusions are
introduced, children live into their late teens
eventually succumbing to heart failure due
to iron overload.
With
the
introduction
of
frequent
chronic transfusion therapy with regular
iron chelation, children are now surviving
into adulthood, adding to the complexity of
the disease. The longevity of patients who
are compliant with their chelation therapy,
or in those who have received bone marrow
transplantation, is not yet known.
Neonatal screening for
hemoglobinopathies
Newborn screening identiﬁes patients with
beta-thalassemia major, hemoglobin H, and
sickle cell disease. Patients with beta-
thalassemia major and sickle cell disease will
be asymptomatic at birth due to high fetal
hemoglobin levels but will become symp-
tomatic over the next 2 to 3 months as
normal production of Hgb F wanes. Patients
40
Chapter 4

with signiﬁcant Bart’s hemoglobin (see
Table 4.1) should be considered to have
hemoglobin H and require alpha-gene
screening to detect the possibility of Hgb
H-constant spring.
The presence of Hgb F only on the
newborn screening will be interpreted as
beta-thalassemia major (see Table 4.2). This
diagnosis must be conﬁrmed with parental
electrophoresis and repeat testing of the
infant at 2 to 3 months after fetal hemoglo-
bin wanes with concomitant increase in
hemoglobin A and A2 in the normal patient.
The pattern FA is normal and should not be
interpreted as beta-thalassemia trait. This is
a diagnosis made by the practitioner when
microcytic anemia is seen during routine
childhood screening and an investigation
for thalassemia conﬁrms the diagnosis.
Hgb FE will be presumed to be Hgb E-
beta-thalassemia until that diagnosis is inves-
tigated and conﬁrmed, or ruled out by repeat
electrophoresis and family studies. Hemoglo-
bin E is the most common abnormal

hemoglobin discovered in the state of Cali-
forniaonnewbornscreening.Itiscommonin
Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. Hemoglobin
E results from a mutation in an exon (exon 1,
codon 26: GAG to AAG) that creates an
alternate splice site competing with the nor-
mal splice site. This results in abnormal
hemoglobin production and mild microcytic
anemia (Hgb 10g/dL) in the homozygous
state. Electrophoresis reveals about 90% Hgb
E with varying amounts of Hgb F. The het-
erozygote has a hemoglobin of about 12 g/dL
with microcytosis and an electrophoretic
pattern consistent with Hgb E plus Hgb A.
When combined with other more severe
beta-thalassemias,HgbE-beta-thalassemiacan
produce an anemia that is profound requiring
chronic transfusion therapy. All children who
have Hgb E and Hgb F on their state screen
require scrutiny for the emergence of a severe
thalassemia syndrome. Individuals who are
homozygous for Hgb E should not have a
signiﬁcant anemia and do not require special
care.Likepatientswithalpha-thalassemia,they

cytic anemia unless they are proven to have

Case study for review
You are seeing an infant that has been fol-
lowing in your clinic since the newborn
period. The baby was born full-term without
any signiﬁcant issues. You are now seeing the
baby back at 4 months for the well-child
check and their secondary vaccinations. The
parents note that the baby has been more
listless, not eating as well, and looking paler.
There are no recent infections or fevers.
1. Assumingthisbabyisanemic,whatwould
your differential diagnosis be at this point?
Causes of anemia are quite broad at this point.
Complete blood count with differential,
MCV,andreticulocytecountwouldbehelpful
to narrow the differential. Iron deﬁciency is
unlikely before 6 months of age due to mater-
nal iron stores unless the baby was born
prematurely (and would have been routinely
put on iron therapy) or if the mother had
severe anemia during pregnancy or if there
was acute or occult blood loss. Viral suppres-
sion or aplasia from infections such as par-
vovirus is possible, but less likely without
any history of recent infection or fever.
Beta-thalassemia as well as sickle cell anemia
should be high in the differential as fetal
hemoglobin lives 60 to 90 days and therefore
by 4 months of age the infant will be produc-
ing little fetal hemoglobin (a2g2) and should
have moved to almost solely hemoglobin A
(a2b2) unless there is a problem with the
b-globin
chain.
Additional
possibilities
include a hemolytic anemia, transient ery-
throblastopenia of childhood (though rarely
seen at this young of an age), infant leuke-
mia, and folate and vitamin B12 deﬁciency if
the baby is being fed goat’s milk or the
mother is vegan, respectively.
2. What additional piece of information
may be helpful in this young child?
In addition to asking about a family history
of sickle cell anemia and thalassemias, the
provider should look for the results of new-
born screen which could be very helpful in
this case. If the patient has a newborn screen
that is FA, sickle cell anemia and b-thalas-
semia major can be ruled out. More con-
cerning newborn screening results would
include F (b-thalassemia major), FS (Hgb
SS disease or Hgb S/b0-thalassemia), and
FSA
(Hgb
S/b þ-thalassemia).
b0-
and
b þ-thalassemia are differentiated based
on the presence (b þ) or absence (b0) of
hemoglobin A, although phenotypically
the patient can have an extremely vari-
able clinical presentation, in part due to
the persistence of fetal hemoglobin. If the
42
Chapter 4

patient had sickle cell trait, their newborn
screen result would be FAS as the percentage
of hemoglobin A should be greater than
the percentage of hemoglobin S. If neces-
sary, results can be conﬁrmed at 4 to
6 months of age after fetal hemoglobin
levels should be signiﬁcantly decreased or,
if possible, the parents can be tested. In
this case, the newborn screen results are F
only.
3. How might repeat hemoglobin electro-
phoresis be different at this age?
The patient that has no hemoglobin A will
be on the extreme end of the clinical spec-
trum with deﬁnitive b-thalassemia major.
For
those
patients
with
some
b-
globin production, the clinical severity of
disease at this point cannot be determined
on a molecular level. Patients who are solely
fetal hemoglobin (a2g2) on newborn screen
will likely continue to make some amount of
fetal hemoglobin in addition to hemoglobin
A2 (a2d2). Their repeat hemoglobin electro-
phoresis will represent this with variable
amounts of hemoglobin A2 and F and no
hemoglobin A.
4. What would you expect the parents’
hemoglobin electrophoresis to show?
The parents likely both have b-thalassemia
trait. If they were tested as newborns, they
would be FA. As adults, after fetal hemo-
globin
production
has
decreased,
they
would have increased amounts of both A2
(>3.5%) and F (>2%) in addition to hemo-
globin A.
5. What other clinical signs might be appar-
ent in the infant?
One would expect to see increasing signs of
extramedullary hematopoiesis with increas-
ing age and decreasing fetal hemoglobin
production. Some of the early signs could
be frontal bossing as well as maxillary and
mandibular prominence. The infant may
have failure to thrive as well as the devel-
opment of hepatosplenomegaly.

Transfusion Medicine
Transfusion of blood products continues
to be an important and necessary part of
therapy in children with hematologic and
oncologic diagnoses. Many complications
can result from transfusion, both infectious
and
noninfectious.
With
continued
improvements in donor screening, and
better testing techniques, infections from
known entities have become a rarity. How-
ever, as long as blood component therapy is
derived from human blood donation, the
risk will persist. Donor selection criteria are
designed to screen out potential donors with
increased risk of infection with HIV-1/2,
HTLV-I/II, and hepatitis B and C, as well
as other infectious pathogens. Despite rig-
orous screening and testing for these infec-
tions, the risk of transmitting these viruses is
not totally eliminated.
Clerical errors and misidentiﬁcation are
major risks for transfusion and can result in
serious consequences, including death. It is
essential that all blood samples drawn for a
type and cross-match be clearly labeled with
the patient’s identiﬁcation. Before adminis-
tration of the blood product, the order
should be checked, patient identiﬁcation
reviewed (patient’s identiﬁcation band),
and blood type veriﬁed. Many institutions
have moved toward testing two separate
blood type specimens for nonemergent
transfusion
in
previously
untransfused
patients to eliminate the risk of clerical
error.
Directed
donation
from
ﬁrst-degree
relatives (especially maternal) should be
discouraged for patients who may be can-
didates for an allogeneic bone marrow
transplant due to the possibility of antigen
sensitization. If it cannot be avoided, the
blood should be irradiated to prevent graft-
versus-host disease (GVHD). Studies have
shown that blood from directed donation is
not safer than the general donation pool due
to current sophisticated
screening
and
testing methods.
These risks must be carefully considered
and
weighed
against
expected
beneﬁt
each time a transfusion is contemplated.
Informed consent should be obtained prior
to
every
nonemergent
transfusion.
In
California, the Gann Act must be renewed
on a yearly basis for those patients under-
going frequent transfusion due to an
underlying
hematologic
or
oncologic
condition.
Packed red blood cell transfusion
Transfusion decisions are made on the basis
of clinical context, rather than the level of
hemoglobin alone (see Figure 5.1). Prior to
transfusion, it is necessary to assess the

mechanism responsible for anemia (bone
marrow inﬁltration, ineffective erythropoi-
esis of chronic disease, occult or obvious
blood loss, transfusion or drug-related sup-
pression of normal hematopoiesis, and
nutritional deﬁciency), the severity of the
signs and symptoms, and the likelihood of
resumption of normal hematopoiesis.
Whole blood is rarely, if ever, utilized in
standard practice, though may occasionally
be utilized for massive transfusion after
military trauma. Packed red blood cells
(PRBCs) are depleted of the majority of
platelets and white blood cells and need
to be ABO and RhD compatible, at the
minimum. Phenotypically, and now more
recently genotypically, matched blood for
minor antigens should be utilized for
patients undergoing chronic transfusion
(e.g., sickle cell disease). One unit of PRBCs
is approximately 250 to 350 mL with a
hematocrit of 55% to 60% when prepared
with adsol. Based on the hematocrit of the
stored PRBCs, one can calculate the pre-
sumed rate of rise from blood transfusion.
For adsol-preserved units, the transfusion
factor is approximately 5 (assuming no
hemolysis of transfused blood or blood
loss). The estimated hemoglobin (Hgb)
increase can be derived utilizing this trans-
fusion factor:
Estimated hemoglobin rise ðg=dLÞ
¼ Volume of PRBC transfusion ðmL=kgÞ

For example, for a transfusion of 15 mL/kg,
the estimated hemoglobin increase should
be 3 g/dL. Of note, waiting a certain
period
of
time
for
a
posttransfusion
“reequilibration” prior to rechecking the
hemoglobin is not necessary.
Removal of the vast majority of remain-
ing white blood cells, or leukoreduction, is
an important step in reducing transfusion-
related risks including risk of infection,
febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions
(FNHTRs), and alloimmunization from
PRBC transfusion. Although not universal
as yet in the United States, leukoreduction is
becoming standard of care and is universal
in Canada and much of Europe.
Irradiation of blood products should be
utilized for all patients who are immuno com-
promised in order to prevent transfusion-
associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-
GVHD). This should include all oncology
patients as well as neonates.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negativeblood
should be considered in patients in the
peritransplant period who are noted to be
CMV seronegative in addition to neonates
born to CMV-negative mothers and patients
with
immunodeﬁciencies.
Institutional
guidelines vary and should be consulted in
determining the need for CMV-negative
blood secondary to the limited supply of
this product.
Finally, washing of PRBCs is rarely indi-
cated and decreases the red cell mass by
approximately 20%. Washing is indicated
for severe allergic transfusion reactions,
hyperkalemia, large-volume transfusions,
and selective IgA deﬁciency.
Indications for PRBC transfusion
Neonates
Guidelines for transfusion in neonates and
infants vary widely in the literature. Clinical
correlation is required in addition to the
following basic guidelines:
* Transfusion
of
leukopoor,
irradiated
blood in premature infants and low-birth
weight neonates (CMV-negative if CMV
status of mother is negative or unknown)
* High oxygen requirement or severe car-
diac disease, keep Hgb 11 to 15 g/dL
* Mild-to-moderate respiratory distress or
perioperative care, keep Hgb 10 g/dL
46
Chapter 5

* Stable infants who become symptomatic
from anemia, keep Hgb > 7 to 8 g/dL (based
on degree of symptoms)
Acute blood loss and nonimmune
hemolytic anemia
Unlike chronic conditions that result in a
slow drop in hemoglobin and time for
compensation, patients with acute blood
loss or nonimmune hemolytic anemia may
be symptomatic at much higher hemoglo-
bin levels and should be transfused accord-
ingly. In situations of continuing blood loss,
patients should be transfused to achieve an
expected hemoglobin level in addition to
receiving blood to compensate for ongoing
losses. In an emergent situation, transfusion
consent is not required, and if there is no
time for a cross-match, O-negative blood
should be given.
Severe chronic anemia
In pediatric patients, iron-deﬁciency ane-
mia is the most likely cause of severe
chronic anemia (i.e., Hgb < 5 g/dL), in
addition to viral suppression, transient
erythroblastopenia of childhood, aplastic
anemia, and newly diagnosed leukemia.
Pediatric patients can present with an
extremely low hemoglobin (e.g., 2 to 3 g/
dL) and yet be relatively well compensated.
Patients should be assessed closely for sub-
tle signs of congestive heart failure (cardi-
omegaly on chest radiograph, increased
diastolic blood pressures, hepatomegaly,
oliguria, and periorbital edema) prior to
transfusion. Slow transfusion (e.g., 1 mL/
kg/h) has been recommended in the past,
although studies have shown that 2 to
3 mL/kg/h is safe in patients with normal
underlying
cardiopulmonary
function.
Those with signs of cardiopulmonary dys-
function should be transfused slowly with
judicious usage of diuretics, and exchange
transfusion should be considered in those
with heart failure.
Oncology patients
In general, a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL is used as
the threshold for transfusion in pediatric
oncology patients. This may be altered in
cases where the patient is asymptomatic
with imminent recovery of red blood cells
(often heralded by increase in platelet
count). Infants with effects on growth and
development due to anemia should be
maintained at higher hemoglobins; simi-
larly, adolescents may complain of headache
and fatigue and be less symptomatic with
hemoglobins in the 8 to 10 g/dL range.
Those with cardiopulmonary dysfunction
and those requiring procedural sedation
with anticipated blood loss should be kept
in the 8 to 10 g/dL range as well.
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
In patients with an autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, immunosuppressive therapy is usu-
ally sufﬁcient to abate the underlying pro-
cess. In those patients who are symptomatic
with a continuing drop in hemoglobin and/
or resultant signiﬁcant cardiopulmonary
dysfunction, phenotypically matched blood
may be given with close observation know-
ing that hemolysis is likely to continue and
may even be augmented.
Chronically transfused patients
Patients with b-thalassemia major as well as
some with b-thalassemia intermedia, Hgb
SS,
and
Hgb
S/b0-thalassemia
require
chronic transfusion therapy, as outlined in
previous chapters. These patients should
have a red cell phenotype prior to initiating
transfusions and based on institutional
practice will usually receive phenotypically
matched blood to a small panel of antigens
(at our institution, other Rh antigens
including C/c and E/e as well as Kell). If
the patient develops antibodies to other
minor red cell antigens (e.g., MNS, Duffy
[Fya/Fyb], Kidd [Jka/Jkb], and Lewis [Lea/
Leb]), more extensive phenotype matching
Transfusion Medicine
47

is performed in order to decrease the con-
tinued risk for alloimmunization. Genotyp-
ing for a wider range of antigens is becoming
more universally available and will likely
become the future standard of care. Sickle
cell patients in addition should receive sick-
ledex-negative blood as blood donors are
not screened for sickle cell trait. Transfusion
is given on a regular basis (i.e., every 3 to 4
weeks) in order to suppress ineffective
erythropoiesis.
Dosing of PRBC transfusion
The desired incremental increase in hemo-
globin should be considered when deter-
mining the amount of blood to be trans-
fused. In general, 10 to 20 mL/kg over 4
hours is given in order to increase the
hemoglobin by 2 to 4 g/dL. Care should
be taken to not waste blood; therefore,
orders should be rounded to the nearest
unit or half unit, as feasible. Remaining
blood may be sterilely aliquoted and used
later in the same patient in order to decrease
exposure to multiple donors. Slow transfu-
sion should be given in patients with signs of
volume overload or cardiopulmonary dys-
function. Patients with frank heart failure
should be exchange transfused. Care should
be taken to not increase the hemoglobin
above 12 g/dL in patients with sickle cell
disease secondary to hyperviscosity and
increased risk of CNS events. Similarly, in
leukemic patients with hyperleukocytosis at
diagnosis(whitebloodcellcount>100 109/
L), the hemoglobin should preferably be kept
below 10 g/dL and transfusion avoided if
possible due to the same risks of increasing
viscosity and the propensity for leukostasis.
Exchange transfusion
Exchange transfusion or erythrocytopher-
esis may be indicated in the severely anemic
patient with congestive heart failure, acute
sickle cell events, hyperbilirubinemia, or in
an anemic patient treated with severe ﬂuid
restriction (increased ICP). In sickle cell dis-
ease, exchange transfusion quickly reduces
the concentration of sickle cells without
increasing the hematocrit or whole blood
viscosity. In addition, red cell exchange
transfusion reduces iron accumulation since
an equal volume of red cells and iron are
removed as infused. Therefore, for sickle cell
disease, erythrocytopheresis is preferred over
straight transfusion in patients requiring
chronic transfusion in addition to those
patients with acute events. Automated ery-
throcytopheresis can be done rapidly and
safely in most situations. Limitations of this
technique include increased red cell utiliza-
tion, venous access, and increased cost.
Platelets
Platelet transfusions are indicated for throm-
bocytopenic patients with bleeding due to
severely decreased platelet production or for
patientswithbleedingsecondarytofunction-
ally abnormal platelets. Transfusion is not
indicated for those with rapid destruction
(e.g., immune thrombocytopenic purpura
and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytope-
nia) unless there is life-threatening hemor-
rhage; however, transfusion may be useful in
the bleeding patient with rapid consumption
(e.g., disseminated intravascular coagula-
tion [DIC]) or dilutional thrombocytopenia
(massive transfusion or exchange). Platelets
are frequently needed in the patient receiving
chemotherapy or one thrombocytopenic
secondary to a marrow inﬁltrative process.
Indications for platelet
transfusion
1. Premature or sick infants
a. Stable infant with platelet count
<50  109/L
48
Chapter 5

b. Distressed infant with platelet count
<100  109/L
2. Children
a. Platelet count <10  109/L; higher if
febrile, septic, or with active bleeding
b. Platelet count <20 to 50  109/L with
a minor invasive procedure such as:
i.
Lumbar puncture
ii.
ECMO or CV bypass
iii.
Other minor procedures such as
central line placement
c. Invasive procedure in a patient with a
qualitative platelet defect
d. More invasive procedures will require
discussionwiththesurgicalteamregarding
platelet transfusion threshold, although
recommendations are generally not evi-
dence based
3. Patients
undergoing
therapy
for
malignancy
a. Platelet count <10  109/L; higher if
febrile, septic, or with active bleeding
b. Induction chemotherapy:
i.
ALL <10  109/L
ii.
AML <10 to 20  109/L
c. Children undergoing intensive ther-
apy with active mucositis should have
their platelet count maintained at 30 to
50  109/L (i.e., Head Start protocol for
brain tumors)
d. Lumbar puncture with platelet count
<20 to 50 109/L; potentially <50 to100
 109/L with diagnostic lumbar puncture
e. Bleeding patient with normal coagu-
lation studies, platelets <50  109/L;
with
abnormal
coagulation
studies,
platelet count <100  109/L
f. Patient requiring a moderately inva-
sive surgical procedure, with a platelet
count <50 to 100  109/L (requiring
discussion with surgical team secondary
to lack of evidence-based guidelines).
Most surgeons would like platelet count
to remain >50 to 75  109/L for 48 to
72 hours after the surgical procedure
g. Intramuscular injection (i.e., PEG-
asparaginase)
with
platelet
count
<20  109/L
Dosing of platelet transfusion
One unit of random platelets (40 mL) per
10 kg will increase the platelet count by 40 to
50  109/L if there is no active consumptive
process (e.g., fever, immune thrombocyto-
penic purpura, sepsis, alloimmunization, or
DIC) or sequestration. This is equivalent to
an increment in platelet count of 10  109/L
per mL/kg of transfused platelets (i.e., in a
10 kg child, 10 mL/kg or 100 mL of trans-
fused plates should raise the platelet count
by 100  109/L). The platelet count should
be checked 1 to 2 hours after infusion to
identify refractory patients. A patient is
refractory if 1 hour after transfusion the
platelet
increment
is
less
than
5
to
10  109/L per unit transfused for two sep-
arate transfusions.
A patient may have platelet refractori-
ness secondary to alloantibodies (immune
mediated). Nonimmune causes of platelet
refractoriness are common and include
splenomegaly, fever, infection, DIC, and use
of amphotericin B.
For refractory patients, a trial of cross-
matched platelets should be given. Other
possibilities for treatment should this fail
include leukocyte-depleted, human leuko-
cyte
antigen
(HLA)-matched
platelets,
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with
HLA-matched platelets, or massive trans-
fusion with random donor platelets (to
overwhelm the antibody).
Most institutions now utilize pheresed
platelets that are harvested from a single
donor and generally contain greater than
30  109/L
of
platelets,
equivalent
to
approximately 6 to 8 units of random plate-
lets. The volume is usually 250 to 350 mL.
Secondary to the apheresis, these platelet
products are considered to be leukoreduced.
In addition, although controversial, most
Transfusion Medicine
49

believe that apheresis is sufﬁcient to reduce
the risk of CMV transmission. Plasma ABO
compatibility should generally be utilized,
especially with increasing volume of trans-
fusion. Type-speciﬁc platelets can be given
in cases of refractoriness and should be
given to patients in the peritransplant
period to eliminate the production of any
potential red blood cell antibodies. As with
PRBC transfusion, platelet irradiation is
required in oncology patients, premature
or low birth weight newborns, and patients
with immunodeﬁciencies.
Dosage of platelet transfusion is gener-
ally 10 to 15 mL/kg and can be given over 30
minutes to 1 hour. Due to the expected
increase in platelet count and short life-
span of platelets, 1 unit of pheresed platelets
is usually sufﬁcient for transfusion in
patients over 30 kg. As with PRBCs, pher-
esed platelet units should be rounded to
the nearest half and full units as feasible
to decrease waste and may be sterilely
aliquoted as needed.
Fresh frozen plasma
Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is a source of
plasma proteins, including nonlabile clotting
factors, such as ﬁbrinogen. It is used for the
treatmentofstableclottingfactordeﬁciencies
in which no concentrate is available (not for
factorVIIIorIX).Bydeﬁnition,eachmilliliter
of undiluted plasma contains 1 international
unit (IU) of each coagulation factor.
Plasma consists of the anticoagulated
clear portion of blood separated by centri-
fugation. FFP is collected from single
donors, with each unit being removed from
a unit of whole blood and frozen within 6 to
8 hours of collection. FFP should not be
used when the coagulopathy can be cor-
rected more effectively with speciﬁc treat-
ment such as vitamin K, cryoprecipitate, or
factor
concentrate.
Due
to
the
high
concentration of plasma antibodies, FFP is
often the cause in cases of transfusion-asso-
ciated acute lung injury (TRALI) and there-
fore should be used judiciously. The direct
antiglobulin test (DAT; Coombs test) may
also be positive for this reason.
Indications for FFP
* Bleeding or invasive procedure with
documented clotting factor deﬁciency and
appropriate factor not available
* Treatment of protein C or S deﬁciency,
factor XI deﬁciency (hemophilia C)
* Bleeding during massive transfusion, not
from thrombocytopenia
Dosing of FFP
The usual dosage of FFP is 10 to 15 mL/kg
over 1 hour, which is expected to increase
the concentration of coagulation factors by
25% to 50%. Due to the presence of
isohemagglutinins, FFP should be ABO
matched. White blood cells are killed or
made nonfunctional during the freezing
process; therefore, leukoreduction and irra-
diation are unnecessary.
Cryoprecipitate
Cryoprecipitate is prepared by thawing FFP
and recovering the cold precipitate. Each
bag contains >80 U factor VIII coagulant
activity and >150 mg ﬁbrinogen in approx-
imately 15 mL of plasma. In addition, cryo-
precipitate contains factor XIII and von
Willebrand factor. Bags must usually be
pooled to achieve an adequate dose.
Indications for cryoprecipitate
* Bleeding or invasive procedure with
factor VIII deﬁciency or von Willebrand
disease and factor concentrate not available
* Bleeding or invasive procedure with
hypoﬁbrinogenemia
or
factor
XIII
deﬁciency
50
Chapter 5

Dosing of cryoprecipitate
The usual dosage for cryoprecipitate is
1 unit/5 kg. Obtain a ﬁbrinogen level at
30 minutes postinfusion. For hypoﬁbrino-
genemia with coagulopathy, the goal is to
maintain ﬁbrinogen >100 mg/dL Speciﬁc
factor or coagulation protein levels need
to be determined in addition to assessing
clinical status to decide on frequency of
transfusion. As with FFP, cryoprecipitate
is preferably ABO compatible and leukor-
eduction and irradiation are not required.
Antithrombin III
Antithrombin III (ATIII) concentrate is
available for use in patients with inherited
or
acquired
ATIII
deﬁciency
(sepsis,
thrombosis, and medication induced). It
may also be needed in patients receiving
heparin therapy who have a low ATIII
level. Patients with thrombosis after aspar-
aginase therapy should have an ATIII
level checked and repletion as necessary.
ATIII replacement should also be consid-
ered in patients with veno-occlusive disease
(sinusoidal obstructive syndrome) after
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Dosing of ATIII is based on the baseline
and desired level.
Granulocyte transfusion
Patients with profound and prolonged neu-
tropenia are at increased risk for serious life-
threatening fungal and bacterial infections.
The beneﬁcial effect of granulocyte trans-
fusion in this population, with known
persistent infection, especially with Gram-
negative organisms and fungus, is yet to be
proven by randomized controlled trials,
although observational studies are available.
Donor
mobilization
with
granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(G-CSF)
has
increased granulocyte yields, and therefore
the therapeutic beneﬁt of transfusion, as
the dose of granulocytes is the most impor-
tant factor in success of this treatment
modality.
Granulocytes migrate toward, phago-
cytize, and kill bacteria. When given a gran-
ulocyte transfusion, the cells migrate to the
foci of infection, though there is rarely a
measurable
increase
in
the
peripheral
granulocyte count. This is likely from
sequestration at the site of infection, prior
immunization to leukocyte antigens, or a
consumptive process secondary to the infec-
tion. Side effects of granulocyte transfusion
include the risk of CMV infection, TA-
GVHD, respiratory distress with pulmonary
inﬁltrates (TRALI, concurrent administra-
tion of amphotericin B, or secondary to
granulocyte
sequestration),
and
alloimmunization.
Preparation of granulocyte
concentrates
Donor mobilization is recommended with
G-CSF at 5 mcg/kg (maximum 300 mcg IV/
SC) and dexamethasone 12 hours prior to
col-lection. Granulocytes are then collected
by apheresis and ideally should be transfused
within 8 to 12 hours of collection. RBC
contamination requires ABO compatibility.
Due to risks of TA-GVHD and CMV infec-
tion, irradiation and CMV seronegativity
are required (in those that are CMV-
negative), respectively. Amphotericin B and
concomitant
granulocyte
transfusion
is
potentially associated with severe pulmo-
nary reactions, although the evidence is
controversial; however, it is reasonable to
space these therapies apart by at least
4
hours.
HLA-matched
granulocytes
should be given in patients with known
alloimmunization. Since granulocyte half-
life is only 7 hours, daily collection and
transfusion for several days are likely
required for beneﬁt.
Transfusion Medicine
51

Indications for granulocyte
transfusion
With a lack of randomized controlled trials,
there are no evidence-based guidelines for
granulocyte transfusion. Limited data in
neonates with sepsis has failed to show a
signiﬁcant
beneﬁt.
After
weighing
the
potential risks and beneﬁts, as well as deter-
mining the daily availability of an eligible
donor and collection site, granulocyte trans-
fusion can be considered in severely neu-
tropenic patients with a refractory or pro-
gressive bacterial or fungal infection on
appropriate, aggressive therapy with neu-
tropenia that is expected to continue for, at
the least, several days.
Transfusion reactions
Approximately 4% of transfusions are asso-
ciated with some form of adverse reaction,
ranging from brief episodes of fever to life-
threatening
episodes
of
hemolysis
and
shock. Fortunately, the majority of reactions
are short-term, speciﬁcally FNHTRs and
allergic
reactions,
and
easily
managed.
Life-threatening reactions are nearly always
due to clerical error resulting in transfusion
of an ABO incompatible unit. The challenge
for the clinician is to promptly recognize
potential serious complications that may
present with common symptoms such as
fever. For any transfusion reaction, a bed-
side check of all labels, forms, and patient
identiﬁcation should be done, in addition to
notifying the blood bank. Transfusion reac-
tions are summarized below and include
FNHTRs,
allergic
reactions,
immune-
mediated hemolysis, TRALI, transfusion-
associated circulatory overload (TACO),
TA-GVHD, and acute infection.
Hemolytic transfusion reactions
Hemolytic transfusion reactions can either
be acute or delayed. Acute hemolytic trans-
fusion reactions (AHTRs) are usually due to
clerical error resulting in the transfusion of
an ABO incompatible unit. AHTRs classi-
cally present with fever, chills, nausea, and
vomiting in addition to dyspnea, hypo-
tension, shock, hemoglobinuria, and DIC.
Bacterial contamination must be considered
in the differential for an AHTR. Delayed
hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs)
present 2 to 14 days after transfusion with
milder
symptoms
including
low-grade
fever,
jaundice,
and
a
posttransfusion
hemoglobin increment less than expected
due
to
minor
antigen
incompatibility
(alloimmunization) from prior transfusion.
Evaluation of a potential AHTR should
include work-up of all recently transfused
blood products (see Figure 5.2). A bedside
check of labeling should occur followed by
laboratory
evaluation
including
repeat
cross-matching and a DAT (Coombs test).
The DAT may not always be positive if all
the antibodies have been destroyed during
the hemolytic crisis. Other labs that should
be sent to rule out intravascular hemolysis
include indirect bilirubin, LDH, plasma-
free hemoglobin (and/or haptoglobin), and
urinalysis for hemoglobinuria.
DHTRs lead to extravascular hemolysis
and should be evaluated in a patient with
clinical or laboratory symptoms after the
ﬁrst 24 hours. Labs to follow include a
posttransfusion hemoglobin level and retic-
ulocyte count, indirect bilirubin, LDH, and
DAT.
If an AHTR is suspected, emergent man-
agement is vital. The transfusion should be
immediately stopped and IV ﬂuid resusci-
tation commenced. Inotropic support may
be required for hypotension and shock.
Renal perfusion and urine output should
be followed closely and additional blood
product support may be required. DHTRs
usually
do
not
require
intervention
although
may
rarely
cause
profound
anemia.
FNHTRs were signiﬁcantly more com-
mon prior to near universal leukoreduction
52
Chapter 5

and occur due to pyrogenic cytokines
released by leukocytes during blood com-
ponent storage. FNHTR is deﬁned as a
temperature increase of 1 C (1.8 F) with-
out any other attributable cause. More seri-
ous causes of fever including AHTR and
bacterial contamination must be ruled out
prior to the diagnosis of FNHTR being
made.
Transfusion
must
therefore
be
discontinued until an AHTR can be ruled
out (see Figure 5.2). Fever due to FNHTR is
usually self-limited and resolves with anti-
pyretic usage and stopping the transfusion.
Chills, rigors, and discomfort can occur,
mimicking an AHTR. Transfusion can
potentially be restarted after AHTR has been
ruled out based on the clinical status of the
patient and urgency of the transfusion.

Transfusion Medicine
53

Although patients with a history of FNHTR
often receive premedication with acetamin-
ophen with future transfusions, this prac-
tice is not evidence based. Antipyretics
should be considered for the patient with
multiple FNHTRs; if acetaminophen is not
effective, a trial of washed blood compo-
nents can be considered. Of note, transfu-
sion can be given to the febrile patient if
urgently necessary, as the criteria for work-
up (beyond a close and continued clinical
assessment) is an increase of 1 C in fever
compared to the fever curve from the
previous 24 hours.
Allergic transfusion reactions
Allergic reactions are typically type I hyper-
sensitivity reactions to plasma in blood
components. Allergic reactions are com-
mon, occurring in 1% to 5% of transfusions,
and usually with mild symptoms such as
urticaria, although anaphylaxis can occur.
For the majority of allergic reactions, an
antihistamine such as diphenhydramine is
sufﬁcient to alleviate symptoms and the
transfusion can likely be completed in the
allotted time. For more severe symptoms,
the transfusion should be stopped. Steroids,
an H2 blocker (e.g., ranitidine), epineph-
rine, volume expansion, b2 agonists (e.g.,
albuterol), and oxygen may be required.
Patients with a severe allergic reaction
should be tested for IgA deﬁciency. As with
FNHTRs, premedication (with an antihis-
tamine) remains controversial in patients
with a history of a reaction. Patients with
multiple episodes may beneﬁt from preme-
dication with an antihistamine and, if not
effective, potentially corticosteroids. If aller-
gic reactions continue, washed blood pro-
ducts should be utilized.
Transfusion related acute lung
injury
TRALI is becoming increasingly recognized
as an important cause of morbidity after
transfusion with plasma-containing blood
components. Signs and symptoms include
hypoxia, chest inﬁltrates (without volume
overload), dyspnea/tachypnea, fever, and
hypotension.
TRALI
generally
should
occur within 6 hours of transfusion com-
pletion. A majority of patients with TRALI
will recover in a 2- to 4-day period,
although respiratory support, and in some
cases
mechanical
ventilation,
is
often
required.
Transfusion-associated
circulatory overload
TACO also is becoming more widely rec-
ognized but is likely rare in the pediatric
population. TACO occurs due to cardio-
genic edema from too rapid or too large a
volume of transfusion. Clinical signs such as
dyspnea/tachypnea and hypoxia may be
confused with TRALI. Differentiating fea-
tures include hypertension rather than
hypotension due to pulmonary overcircula-
tion with a positive ﬂuid balance. Chest
radiograph should be more consistent with
pulmonary
edema/effusion
rather
than
inﬁltrates. Aggressive diuresis should be
utilized.
Transfusion-associated
graft-versus-host disease
TA-GVHD can occur in immunocompro-
mised patients who receive nonirradiated
blood or platelet transfusion due to donor
T-lymphocytes that cannot be rejected by
the host. TA-GVHD has also been reported
in immunologically normal patients with an
HLA-compatible donor such as in homo-
geneous populations or in cases where the
donor is a close relative (directed donation).
Clinical symptoms are equivalent to those
with transplant GVHD including fever,
anorexia, vomiting/diarrhea, and skin rash.
Hepatic dysfunction and pancytopenia can
similarly manifest.
54
Chapter 5

Bacterial infections
Blood components may be contaminated
with bacteria at the time of collection or
during processing. Infection rates are higher
after platelet transfusion since platelets are
stored at room temperature, although clin-
ical signs and symptoms are often more
severe after transfusion of contaminated
PRBCs. Infection is associated with a rapid
onset of symptoms and a high rate of
morbidity and mortality, especially from
Gram-negative organisms. The patient may
present acutely septic with fever/chills,
hypotension, tachycardia, and shock. If
bacterial contamination is suspected, the
transfusion should be stopped immediately.
Aggressive supportive treatment including
IV ﬂuid resuscitation, initiation of broad-
spectrum antibiotics, and potential therapy
for renal failure, shock, and/or DIC should
be started emergently.
Case study for review
You are following a 12-year-old, 60-kg boy
admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit
with septic shock. He is secondarily found to
be anemic and thrombocytopenic with coa-
gulopathy and hypoﬁbrinogenemia in DIC.
After initial stabilization of the patient
with IVF, antibiotics, mechanical ventila-
tion, and pressors, the PICU team is deter-
mining their transfusion plan. Current
hemoglobin
is
7.0 g/dL,
platelets
are
34  109/L, PT is 27.2 seconds, PTT is
74.6 seconds, and ﬁbrinogen is 76 mg/dL.
There is no noted active bleeding. 1:1 mix-
ing studies correct both the PT and PTT,
implying a factor deﬁciency rather than an
antibody. The patient does appear to have
some amount of hemolysis with an elevated
indirect bilirubin and LDH but has a neg-
ative direct Coombs test.
1. What
blood
products
should
be
transfused?
2. What amount of PRBCs should be given?
3. Are there any special considerations for
the type of blood product required?
4. What are some speciﬁc risks with this
patient presentation?
First, the patient should be given PRBCs,
pheresed platelets (if possible), and FFP.
Cryoprecipitate may or may not be required
dependent on the increase in ﬁbrinogen
with FFP. If the patient is clinically wors-
ening (e.g., problems oxygenating, drop-
ping blood pressures), consideration should
be given to transfusing O-negative PRBCs
while awaiting cross-matching.
Second, one can utilize the transfusion
factor to estimate the increment in hemo-
globin with transfusion. In this case, the
transfusion factor will likely overestimate
the bump as the patient is actively septic
and therefore hemolyzing PRBCs and con-
suming platelets. Still, estimating will help
determine a reasonable plan. Assuming the
decision is made to give 15 mL/kg (3 units),
one would expect at most an increase in
hemoglobin of 3 g/dL:
Transfusion amount (mL/kg)/transfusion
factor ¼ Hgb increase (g/dL)
Therefore, in this case (15 mL/kg)/5 ¼ 3 g/
dL
In general, platelet and FFP transfusion will
also be 10 to 15 mL/kg. Platelet transfusion
should initially be a maximum of one pher-
esed unit (approximately 250 to 350 mL).
Posttransfusion hemoglobin, platelets, and
coagulation studies can help determine the
need for additional transfusion as well as the
likely frequency of necessary transfusion
(directly dependent on the clinical status
of the patient). Time for “equilibration”
after the completion of transfusion is
unnecessary.
Third, in this case, no signiﬁcant special
arrangements need to initially be made in
regards to the transfusions. The patient does

not need sickledex-negative blood unless
they have concomitant sickle cell disease.
Also, phenotypically
matched
blood is
unnecessary.
As
the
patient
does
not
have a known underlying reason to be
immunocompromised,
irradiated
blood
and platelets are not required. Similarly,
CMV-negative blood is unnecessary.
Finally, speciﬁc risks exist for this patient
and must be considered during transfusion.
Due to the likelihood of continued transfu-
sions as well as the presence of sepsis, the
patient may develop volume overload and
potentially TACO; therefore, the judicious
use of diuretics with transfusion should be
considered. In addition, a signiﬁcant vol-
ume of PRBC transfusion can have a dilu-
tional effect on platelets and coagulation
factors, thus increasing transfusion require-
ments for these blood products. The patient
is also at risk for hyperkalemia with increas-
ing PRBC transfusion. If hyperkalemia
begins to occur, washed PRBCs should
be given. Massive PRBC or whole blood
transfusion has been shown to induce
transfusion-associated
microchimerism.
Microchimerism is the presence of donor
lymphocytes in the recipient’s circulation.
The signiﬁcance of transfusion-associated
microchimerism
is
unknown.
Patients
receiving large amounts of plasma are at
risk for developing TRALI that must be
considered
with
worsening
respiratory
symptoms.

Chelation Therapy
Transfusional iron overload
Iron overload may occur in any patient
receiving intermittent transfusions for acute
illness (e.g., sickle cell disease), chronic
transfusion therapy (thalassemia, sickle cell
disease, red cell aplasia, bone marrow failure
syndromes), or in those having received
an intensive period of frequent transfusion
(myelosuppressive chemotherapy/radiation
for treatment of malignancy and after
hematopoietic stem cell transplant). Each
milliliter of blood contains 1 mg of iron and
normal iron stores are approximately 3 g,
with 2 g in the blood and 1 g in the liver.
Therefore, patients receiving frequent trans-
fusion likely will have received a large
amount of transfused iron and should be
monitored for evidence of iron accumulation.
There is no simple test for quantifying
total iron burden. Serial serum ferritin levels
are helpful in determining hepatic iron
stores, but values are altered in states of
inﬂammation. Liver biopsy remains the
gold standard for quantiﬁcation of total
body iron but is an invasive procedure. Liver
iron levels 7 mg/g dry weight liver are
indicative of iron overload. The supercon-
ducting
quantum
interference
device
(SQUID) is accepted as a noninvasive
method to quantitate total body iron, but
its limited availability does not allow for
routine use. Currently, R2 MRI (proton
magnetic resonance imaging) is becoming
more widely utilized as an accurate and
noninvasive measure of organ iron content,
and T2 MRI is becoming the new standard
for measuring cardiac iron stores. Further
study is required for these new techniques to
become uniformly calibrated methods.
Institution of chelation therapy relative to
transfusion frequency is based on institu-
tional practice. Patients that will require
chronic transfusion therapy should be che-
lated before their liver iron reaches a high
level, measured by liver biopsy, MRI quan-
tiﬁcation, or based on the number of trans-
fusions received (i.e., chelation initiated after
receiving 10 to 20 transfusions, or approxi-
mately 3 to 6 g of transfusional iron in a
30 kg patient). Thalassemia patients tend to
have a higher iron burden than sickle cell
patients as the chronic inﬂammatory state in
sickle cell disease limits gastrointestinal iron
absorption. Thalassemia patients should be
counseled to be on a low-iron diet.
Patients receiving intermittent transfu-
sion or those receiving frequent transfusion
therapy in a short period of time (e.g., with
intensive leukemia therapies) may have a
more insidious development of iron overload.
Patients with leukemia should have serum
ferritin levels checked at the end of therapy.
Those with ferritin levels > 1000 ng/mL

should have serial checks every 3 months; if
ferritin remains above this threshold after 6 to
12 months, the patient should undergo liver
biopsy or R2 MRI for more accurate iron
quantiﬁcation.
These
patients,
especially
male adolescents, may beneﬁt from monthly
phlebotomy which can be discontinued when
the ferritin and liver iron concentration reach
normal levels (i.e., 1.6 mg/g dry liver weight).
Younger children and menstruating females
have been shown to have reversible iron
overload in most such cases.
Current treatment strategies for iron
overload and potential side effects of iron
chelators are summarized in Table 6.1. Des-
feroxamine (Desferal) has the longest treat-
ment record but requires parenteral admin-
istration and has been widely replaced by
deferasirox (Exjade) due to the convenience
of oral intake and therefore presumed
increased compliance. Exjade may not be
effective in all patients, which must be
weighed against the risks of noncompliance
with Desferal. Deferiprone (Ferriprox or
Kelfer) was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in October 2011.
Usage of two agents concomitantly is cur-
rentlyundergoingclinicaltrialsandmayhave
particular beneﬁt in chelation ofcardiac iron.
Concomitant administration of ascorbic
acid (vitamin C) increases the excretion of
iron when given with chelation. Iron che-
lators should not be administered when
there is concern for a bacterial infection.
By mobilizing free iron, chelators promote
bacterial growth, in particular Yersinia
enterocolitica. For febrile patients on chela-
tor therapy, chelation should be stopped
until blood cultures are deﬁnitively nega-
tive. Broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis
should be initiated and include coverage for
this unusual organism.

Lead toxicity
Lead poisoning is an environmental disease
that has undergone a major evolution in the
past few decades. Recognition of the devas-
tating neurologic effects of high lead levels
and knowledge of the causes have led to
universal efforts to decrease environmental
lead
contamination,
with
a
resultant
decrease in measured blood lead levels in
children over the past 2 to 3 decades.
Sources of lead have included gasoline addi-
tives, food can soldering, lead-based paints,
ceramic glazes, certain toys, drinking water
systems (lead pipes), and folk remedies. The
use of these products has been markedly
reduced as the result of federal guidelines
and the development of cost-effective alter-
natives. Lead in gasoline and paint is at
extremely low levels and has been elimi-
nated altogether from food can soldering.
Housing built prior to 1960 is likely to have
been painted with high-content lead-based
paint, and since lead isotopes are very stable,
environmental exposure presents an on-
going risk. High risk populations have a
greater likelihood of living in older housing,
which has not had lead abatement. Risk
factors for excessive lead exposure include
poverty, age younger than 6 years, African-
American ethnicity, and urban housing.
Lead may enter the body through direct
ingestion, inhalation, or via skin absorption.
The most common pathway among young
children is through the mouth. Lead absorp-
tion is enhanced in the presence of other
dietary mineral deﬁciencies, such as calcium
and iron, due to competitive biochemical
pathways. Pica behavior enhances the like-
lihood of direct ingestion. Toddlers in par-
ticular are at risk due to normal develop-
mental behaviors such as putting objects
and toys in the mouth and chewing on
unusual surfaces (e.g., window sills).
Lead entering the intravascular space
rapidly attaches to the red blood cell, with
minimal amounts (3%) detected in the
plasma. The half-life in the blood is approx-
imately 21 to 30 days. Excretion is primarily
through the kidneys, with small amounts
deposited in the hair, nails, and bile. The
lead that remains in the body accumulates
mostly in the bone (65% to 90%). Lead can
enter any cell and toxicity may occur in any
tissue or organ. Classically, in severe lead
intoxication, gastrointestinal and central
nervous system toxicities are the most clin-
ically apparent. Gastrointestinal symptoms
include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdom-
inal pain, and constipation. The blood lead
level is typically 50 mcg/dL or greater when
these symptoms are present. Lead poisoning
was a lethal disease in the United States
decades ago, primarily related to neurotoxic
effects. At levels above 100 mcg/dL, children
may show evidence of encephalopathy,
including a marked change in mentation
or activity, ataxia, seizures, and coma.
Increased intracranial pressure may be pres-
ent on examination. These effects are usu-
ally permanent with long-term sequelae of
retardation, palsies, and growth failure.
Most children who have elevated blood
lead levels have subclinical disease. Fewer
than 5% of children present with overt
symptoms of lead toxicity. An elevated
blood lead level, suggesting excessive envi-
ronmental exposure, is deﬁned as 10 mcg/dL.
Many
studies
have
shown
associations
between blood lead levels and impaired neu-
rocognitive function. These results have pro-
vided the primary impetus for current public
health efforts. Of note, no lead level is normal
and even lead levels below 10mcg/dL are
thought to lead to subtle neurocognitive
dysfunction.
Screening for lead toxicity
Prevention and treatment of lead toxicity
remains a major public health concern, and
efforts for screening have primarily focused
on high risk populations. All children

should have a screen of potential environ-
mental exposures by their primary health
care provider starting at 1 year of age, and
repeated when the child is mobile and
attains hand-to-mouth behavior. The Cen-
ters for Disease Control (CDC) and the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)
recommend venous blood lead sampling for
children identiﬁed to be at high risk (living
in housing built prior to 1960, indigent,
urban, and minority children) at 1 and 2
years of age. Venous blood samples should
be used to assess blood lead levels as capil-
lary samples may give falsely low results. If
the screening test conﬁrms an elevated

guidelines have been developed by the CDC
and AAP and are summarized in Table 6.2.
The vast majority of children with elevated
lead levels are not candidates for chelation
therapy with currently available drugs. Chil-
dren with low levels (<20 mcg/dL) are

asymptomatic and unlikely to have signiﬁ-
cant increase in lead excretion with chela-
tion. These children beneﬁt primarily from
decreased exposure.
Blood lead levels measure the blood con-
centration at a point in time and may not be
able to accurately predict bone stores. Bone
lead content may be assessed noninvasively
using a radiographic technique called X-ray
ﬂuorescence. Measurement of the heme pre-
cursor,
free
erythrocyte
protoporphyrin
(FEP), may also provide a useful clue about
the duration of exposure and the degree of
lead accumulation. Excessively high FEP
levels classically are seen with severe lead
toxicity. Other causes of elevated FEP levels
include iron deﬁciency, inﬂammatory disor-
ders (due to decreased iron absorption),
increased
fetal
hemoglobin,
and
rarely,
porphyria.
Management of lead toxicity
The primary aims of management are pre-
vention of future lead exposure and resul-
tant absorption as well as enhancement of
excretion. The steps to accomplish these
goals include:
1. Assessment of the environment to elimi-
nate the sources of exposure or removal of the
child from the contaminated environment.
2. Modifying the child’s behavior to decrease
hand-to-mouth activity.
3. Ensuring adequate nutrition, especially
minerals, to limit lead absorption, including
evaluation for concomitant iron deﬁciency.
4. Administering medications (chelators)
in children with very high lead levels to
increase lead excretion.
After chelation therapy, a period of reequili-
bration for 10 to 14 days should be allowed,
prior to repeat assessment of the blood lead
concentration.
Subsequent
treatments
should be based on these levels, using the
same criteria speciﬁed in Table 6.2. Ongoing
efforts should be made to provide the family
with education in order to prevent exposure
in the child’s environment in addition to
assuring adequate nutrition. Family mem-
bers and siblings should be screened as well.

Approach to the
Bleeding Child
Hemostasis is a critical protective response
of the body to reverse a loss of vascular
integrity and prevent excessive blood loss.
It
requires
a
coordinated
interaction
between platelets, vascular endothelial cells,
and plasma clotting factors. The ﬁrst and
primary stage of hemostasis is the formation
of a platelet plug that involves a complex
interaction between circulating platelets and
the exposed vascular subendothelial layer.
The steps in the process include platelet
adhesion,
mediated
by
an
interaction
between von Willebrand factor (VWF) and
platelet surface glycoprotein (Gp) Ib, and
platelet activation, mediated by platelet sur-
face Gp IIb/IIIa and leading to release of
platelet contents. Gp IIb/IIIa interacts with
VWF and ﬁbrinogen, leading to platelet
aggregation and enlargement of the platelet
plug. This lays the foundation for the for-
mation of a ﬁbrin clot, the secondary stage
of hemostasis caused by activation of the
coagulation cascade.
Clinical disorders associated with abnor-
malities of primary hemostasis include vas-
cular
abnormalities,
qualitative
platelet
abnormalities, quantitative platelet abnor-
malities, and von Willebrand disease. These
aberrations
in
primary
hemostasis
are
characterized by bleeding of the mucous
membranes,
epistaxis,
and
superﬁcial
ecchymoses. Typical manifestations are pro-
longed oozing from minor wounds or abra-
sions, or abnormal intraoperative bleeding.
Aberrations in secondary hemostasis are
characterized by bleeding from large vessels
with subcutaneous, palpable hematomas,
hemarthroses, or intramuscular hemato-
mas. The hemophilias are examples of dis-
orders in this category.
Evaluation of the bleeding child
There are three critical questions that must
be addressed when faced with a child who is
actively bleeding or has experienced a major
hemorrhage in the past. The ﬁrst two ques-
tions are, “is the patient continuing to
bleed?” and “is the patient hemodynami-
cally stable?” These questions should be
answered
quickly
and
simultaneously.
Patients who are actively bleeding but are
hemodynamically stable should have efforts
directed at controlling the bleeding. While
therapies that are speciﬁc for a particular
bleeding disorder should not be provided
before a diagnosis is made, more general
strategies such as ice, pressure, and elevation
can be used. Patients who do not appear to
be actively bleeding but are hemodynami-
cally unstable require rapid initiation of

vascular reexpansion and a search for occult
bleeding.
Once the patient is stabilized and bleed-
ing is controlled, the third critical question
is whether the child presenting with bleed-
ing warrants an evaluation for a bleeding
disorder. Examples of excessive bleeding
include epistaxis lasting more than 15 min-
utes despite the appropriate application of
pressure to the side of the nose, signiﬁcant
blood loss following a dental procedure
lasting more than 24 hours or requiring
blood transfusion, bruising that seems
excessive following trauma, or menorrhagia
(heavy menstrual bleeding lasting for 7 days
or more, or loss of more than 80 mL of
blood per cycle). When evaluating a child
for “excessive bruising,” it is essential to
determine whether the bruising could be the
result of nonaccidental trauma. Bruising
involving the scalp, back, or chest, or having
a pattern suggestive of common instruments
of abuse such as belts, cords, or wire should
be reported. Excessive bruising caused by
underlying bleeding disorders occurs on
areas more commonly involved in falls or
trauma such as shins and bony prominences.
History
Assessment of the child with a suspected or
known bleeding diathesis begins with a
complete history. The nature of the bleeding
should be explored with particular attention
to location, duration, frequency, and the
measures necessary to stop it. The time of
the patient’s ﬁrst episode of bleeding should
be documented and a careful history of
bruising during the toddler age is impor-
tant. A previous history of bleeding asso-
ciated with trauma or surgery, dental
extraction, circumcision, or tonsillectomy
is also important, as is a history of petechial
rash, arthritis with hemarthroses, or blood
transfusion. In females, the duration and
severity of menstrual bleeding should be
documented.
A family history and pedigree are crucial,
as many bleeding disorders are hereditary.
The history should also address the use of
over-the-counter and prescription drugs
that can induce bleeding. The most com-
mon offenders are aspirin, ibuprofen, and
naproxen. It is important to ask the patient
speciﬁcally about the use of medications
for colds, sinus trouble, muscle aches, or
headaches, which may contain these medi-
cations. Some antibiotics, penicillins in
particular, can affect platelet function or
be associated with speciﬁc inhibitors of
clotting.Anticonvulsantscancausethrombo-
cytopenia, and procainamide has been asso-
ciated with an acquired lupus anticoagulant.
Physical examination
In addition to the routine examination, the
skin should be scrutinized carefully for pete-
chiae, purpura, and venous telangiectasias.
The joints should be examined for swelling
or chronic changes such as contractures or
distorted appearance with asymmetry rela-
ted to repeated bleeding episodes. Mucosal
surfaces such as the gingiva and nares
should be examined for bleeding.
Initial laboratory evaluation
The purpose of the initial laboratory eval-
uation is to screen for the presence of a
bleeding disorder, hopefully categorize the
disorder as primary or secondary, and direct
further evaluation. Appropriate screening
tests include a complete blood count (CBC),
peripheral blood smear, prothrombin time
(PT), and partial thromboplastin time
(PTT). In certain circumstances, this list
will also include a ﬁbrinogen and a throm-
bin time (TT).
The CBC provides several pieces of use-
ful information. It provides the platelet
count, identifying in most cases the presence
or absence of thrombocytopenia. However,
it is important to review the peripheral
blood smear, as a small number of patients
Approach to the Bleeding Child
63

with a low measured platelet count will have
pseudothrombocytopenia,
a
condition
caused by platelet clumping in the presence
of the anticoagulant EDTA. It provides the
hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume
(MCV), which can provide clues regarding
the duration and severity of the patient’s
bleeding. The presence of anemia indicates a
clinically signiﬁcant bleeding disorder; the
concomitant presence of microcytosis sug-
gests the bleeding has been prolonged and
has led to iron deﬁciency. A normocytic
anemia suggests that the bleeding has been
more recent and likely more severe, as the
blood loss has likely been more signiﬁcant.
Abnormalities in more than one cell line
(anemia, thrombocytopenia, and/or neutro-
penia) suggest the presence of a bone marrow
failure state such as aplastic anemia or
marrow inﬁltration as is seen in leukemia.
Many analyzers provide a measure of the
mean platelet volume which can be useful
in evaluating the thrombocytopenic patient.
Large platelets are often seen in consumptive
thrombocytopenia such as immune throm-
bocytopenic purpura (ITP), normal-sized
platelets in hypoproliferative thrombocyto-
penia, and small platelets in inherited con-
ditions such as Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome.
The PT evaluates the extrinsic system of
coagulation. Factor VII is the only coagu-
lation factor measured by the PT that is not
measured by the PTT. Thus, in isolated
factor VII deﬁciency, the PT is prolonged
with a normal PTT. Factor VII is vitamin K
dependent and has a very short half-life, so
the PT is one of the most sensitive measures
of oral anticoagulant therapy with vitamin
K antagonists such as warfarin. Most labo-
ratories now report an international nor-
malized ratio (INR) along with the PT. The
INR is calculated as the patient PT/control
PT to the power of the international sensi-
tivity index. This index corrects for the large
variation in the sensitivity of thromboplas-
tin reagents to low plasma concentrations of
some coagulation proteins. A normal value
is 1.00 to 1.10. The INR is used to evaluate
the adequacy of oral anticoagulant therapy;
the PT should be used to look for the
presence of a clotting factor deﬁciency.
The PTT assesses the integrity of the
intrinsic system of coagulation. Depending
on the laboratory methods, the PTT will be
normal when the activity of all measured
coagulation factors is at least 30% of nor-
mal. It is prolonged in patients with hemo-
philia, and in some patients with VWD due
to the decreased concentration of factor VIII
in the plasma. However, the PTT is much
more susceptible than the PT to spurious
abnormalities caused by errors in collection
or processing of the specimen. These are
outlined in Table 7.1.
The most commonly encountered inhi-
bitors of coagulation detected in children
are so-called lupus anticoagulants. These are
IgG antibodies directed against phospholi-
pids, and while they are commonly identi-
ﬁed in adults with autoimmune disease,
they occur frequently in children as a post-
infectious phenomenon that is short-lived.
Asphospholipidisanessentialcofactor inthe
PTT assay, antiphospholipid antibodies will
commonly cause prolongation of the test.
Addition of normal plasma (with additional
phospholipid) as is done in mixing studies
will often at least partially normalize the test,
but it will most often remain abnormal.
These antibodies have no effect on clotting
in vivo, and patients with lupus anticoagu-
lants do not have clinical bleeding; in fact,
their most common coagulation problem is
thrombophilia rather than bleeding.
The TT is useful in evaluating the ter-
minal steps of coagulation and identifying
anticoagulants present in plasma. The TT is
abnormal when the plasma concentration of
ﬁbrinogen
is
decreased
(hypoﬁbrino-
genemia or aﬁbrinogenemia), when the
ﬁbrinogen present is dysfunctional (dysﬁ-
brinogenemia),
or
when
there
are

Chapter 7

circulating
anticoagulants
(heparin)
or
ﬁbrin degradation products. As dysﬁbrino-
genemia is most often asymptomatic, a
prolonged TT in the face of a normal ﬁbrin-
ogen level is almost always associated with
heparin or an inhibitor.
Abnormalities in one or more of the
above screening tests will be noted with
most bleeding disorders. An approach to
identifying the most likely coagulation dis-
orders given the results of these tests is
presented in Table 7.2.
Management
Once the diagnosis is made, speciﬁc treat-
ment can be provided based on the recom-
mendations
outlined
in
the
following
chapters. Two exceptions are management
of epistaxis and menorrhagia. These types
of bleeding can be caused by a variety of
different conditions; yet in most situations,
the following management plans will be
effective. See also Figure 7.1.

1. Place patient in a sitting position to
decrease venous pressure, or if the patient
is recumbent in bed, turn head to the side.
Keep the head higher than the level of the
heart. Do not allow patient to lie ﬂat.
2. Flex neck anteriorly, with the chin touch-
ing the chest.
3. With the thumb and index ﬁnger, pinch
the soft parts of the nose. Hold pressure
ﬁrmly over the lower half of the nose. Avoid
compressing the upper half of the nose.

Clots caused by slow blood ﬂow or delay in transferring

Plasma volume
Volume of anticoagulant must be corrected for plasma
volume. If tube is not completely ﬁlled, or patient is
extremely anemic or polycythemic, sample will not
be appropriately anticoagulated
Heparin contamination
Very small amounts of heparin will cause the PTT to be
abnormal
Interpretation
Age-dependent normal
values
Mild prolongation is normal in the newborn period
(immaturity of the coagulation system)
Inhibitor vs. factor
deﬁciency
A number of agents can interfere with the PTT assay
and cause a factitious prolongation of the test. If the
concentration is high they can lead to a mild pro-
longation of the PT as well. These are diagnosed by
mixing the patient’s plasma and normal plasma in a
1:1 ratio and repeating the test. If the PTT is
prolonged due to factor deﬁciency, this maneuver
will increase the level of all coagulation factors to at
least 50% and normalize the test. If the prolongation
is due to an inhibitor, it may improve but will
remain prolonged. See the discussion of inhibitors

Diagnosis or suspicion of von Willebrand disease or other bleeding disorder: type and severity may influence 
nature of bleeding and intervention
Assessment:
1. History: categorize bleeding pattern by duration, regularity, quantification of bleeding
2. Medication History: evaluate for drugs associated with bleeding including warfarin, heparin, 
salicylates, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, phenytoin, antipsychotics (SSRIs) and tricyclic anti-
depressants, prolonged antibiotic use (low vitamin K), herbal supplements
3. Physical: evidence of bleeding disorder or gynecologic problem
4. Laboratory: assess for degree of anemia and red cell indices with CBC, urine βHCG for pregnancy 
screen, consider STI (gonorrhea, chlamydia with bleeding and use of OCPs)
5. Imaging: assess for anatomic etiology with pelvic ultrasound to look for fibroids, polyps, 
endometriosis, pregnancy complications, ovarian cysts, endometrial cancer
Active, heavy bleeding and anemia
1.Avoid D&C, may worsen bleeding
2.Treat with high dose estrogen PO or IV, 
e.g., estrogen 30 mcg/norgestrel 0.3 mg 
(LoOvral):  1 pill QID x 4 days, then 
TID x 3 days, then BID x 2 days, then 
daily for 3 weeks
3.Consider desmopressin or factor 
concentrate
4.If controlled, follow routine 
management
Routine Management (listed in order of preference, 
patients may require 1 or more interventions):
1. OCP*: combined oral contraceptive, minimum 
3 month trial (synthetic estrogen + progestin); 
consider no withdrawal week for 1–3 months; 
consider increase in dose if breakthrough 
bleeding or persistence of menorrhagia after
3 months
2. Desmopressin: intranasal at initiation of 
menses, could give second dose at 24 hours
3. Antifibrinolytic therapy with initiation of 
menses:  tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid
4. Intrauterine device impregnated with 
progestin (Mirena), may cause bleeding with 
insertion and require preventive intervention
5. Avoid medications that may cause or 
exacerbate bleeding
*Estrogen containing therapies may not be safe 
for women who smoke or have known 
thrombophilia; may increase coagulation proteins

additional hemostasis. Anterior packs may be
left in place for 1 to 5 days, though should be
removed within 24 hours in an immunocom-
promised patient due to the risk of infection.

when placed correctly and snugly, is a reliable
means of packing. Packing may be soaked in
4% topical cocaine or a solution of 4% lido-
caine and topical epinephrine (1:1000) to
provide local anesthesia and vasoconstriction.
Management of menorrhagia
1. The American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists and the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics issued a committee con-
sensus report in 2006 in which they deﬁned
normal menstruation. This report stated that
normal menstruation begins at 11 to 14 years
of age, the normal cycle interval is 21 to 45
days, and the normal length of menstrual
ﬂow is 7 days or less with product use no
more than three to six pads or tampons per
day. Based on this, menorrhagia has been
deﬁned as heavy menstrual bleeding lasting
for more than 7 days orresulting inthe loss of
more than 80 mL per menstrual cycle. How-
ever, attempts to quantify menstrual blood
loss in clinical practice can be quite difﬁcult.
Variables
that
have
been
identiﬁed
as
predicting menstrual blood loss of >80 mL
include the passing of clots >1 inch in diam-
eter, a low serum ferritin, or changing a pad
or tampon more often than hourly.
2. The most effective management of men-
orrhagia is prevention. This can often be
accomplished with hormonal therapy. The
most common approach is the use of com-
bination estrogen–progestin oral contracep-
tive pills (COCP), both cyclic and extended
cycle use. Regular COCPs can been prescribed
in an extended cycle pattern, with the patient
taking 63 to 84 days of active pills before
stopping for 7 days to allow withdrawal
bleeding. Young women often prefer this
approach despite the occasional breakthrough
bleeding that may occur. Table 7.3 lists COCP
preparations that have been used successfully
in managing menorrhagia in women with
bleeding disorders. There are no data that
indicate that any of these agents are superior
to the others in controlling bleeding.
3. Other hormonal approaches to prevent
menorrhagia
include
the
levonorgestrel
intrauterine system (Mirena), oral progesto-
gens, and injected progestogens. Mirena has
been shown to be as efﬁcacious as endome-
trial ablation in decreasing the incidence and
severity of menorrhagia. It has also been
shown in one small study to be well tolerated
by nulliparous adolescent females. Oral
progestin-only OCPs (Micronor, Nor-QD)
contain norethindrone as the active agent.
The progestin implant (Implanon) contains
etonogestrel. Depo-Provera is an injectable
progestin
only
contraceptive
containing
medroxyprogesterone as the active agent.
4. Young women presenting with the acute
complaint of menorrhagia should have a
pregnancy test performed to ensure that
they are not having a miscarriage. They
should also be carefully evaluated to rule
out the presence of severe anemia or hypo-
volemia. If they are hemodynamically stable,
have no prior personal or family history of
abnormal bleeding, and are not allergic to
68
Chapter 7

nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory
drugs
(NSAIDs), ibuprofen 200 mg every 4 to 6
hours can be tried. NSAIDs have been
shown to decrease the amount of menstrual
ﬂow by 25% to 30% by altering the endo-
metrial prostaglandin balance. However,
they are contraindicated in women with
known or suspected coagulopathy.
5. “Double-dose” COCPs can be used to
treat young women presenting with acute
menorrhagia as well. Any of the COCPs in
Table 7.3 containing 35 mcg of ethinyl estra-
diol/tablet can be prescribed twice a day for
up to 7 days until the bleeding stops, after
which the remainder of the pack is com-
pleted on a once daily schedule.
6. If these steps are not effective or the
bleeding is more signiﬁcant, tranexamic
acid can be added to any of these treatments
at a dose of 1300 mg (two tablets) three
times daily for up to 5 days. This antiﬁbri-
nolytic agent has been successfully used to
treat menorrhagia in women both with and
without coagulopathies.
7. Women with inherited coagulopathies
(Type 1 VWD, hemophilia carriers, platelet
functiondisorders)shouldideallybetestedfor
responsiveness to DDAVP prior to menarche.
If they are responsive, this should be used as
ﬁrst-line therapy for menorrhagia. It can be
given IV at a dose of 0.3mcg/kg in 50mL
normalsalineover30minutes.Aconcentrated
nasal preparation is also available (Stimate)
containing 150mcg/spray; it is given at a dose
of one spray in each nostril once daily. Either
preparationcanberepeateddailyforupto3to
4 days during the heaviest menstrual ﬂow. It
should be used in conjunction with tranexa-
mic acid if the bleeding is heavy. Side effects
include ﬂushing, headache, nausea, ﬂuid
retention, and rarely, hyponatremia.
8. Women with persistent bleeding despite
these therapies should be hospitalized for
more
aggressive
therapy,

Case study for review
A 4-year-old girl presents to the emergency
department with a 3 day history of easy
bruising and “rash.” She denies any other
bleeding including epistaxis, oral bleeding,
hematuria, or hematochezia. She has oth-
erwise been well except for an upper respi-
ratory infection 2 weeks ago.
1. What other information would be help-
ful in evaluating this child?
The girl’s parents deny any previous history
of easy bruising, hemarthroses, or muscle
bleeding in the past. The family history is
signiﬁcant for two older brothers who have
never had any bleeding abnormalities. There
is no history of epistaxis, gingival bleeding,
menorrhagia, or excessive bleeding with sur-
gery or trauma in any other family members.
There is no family history of malignancy or
autoimmune disorders. The patient has not
been taking any medications recently.
2. What will you be looking for on physical
examination?
The vital signs are normal, and the patient is
at the 50th percentile for height and weight.
She appears completely healthy. There are
no signs of oral bleeding or purpura. Her
heart and lung exam are normal, and she has
no tenderness, masses, or hepatosplenome-
galy on abdominal exam. You note a diffuse
petechial rash over her entire body, with
several ecchymoses on her shins and arms,
with a few on her back. Her neurological
exam is completely normal.
3. What are your ﬁrst thoughts, and what
would you like to do next?
The presence of petechiae and increased
superﬁcial bruising suggests a disorder of
primary hemostasis. The lack of a previous
history and a negative family history suggest
this is more likely to be an acute problem
rather than a congenital one, although this
is not certain. Acquired problems of primary
hemostasis include acquired (often immune-
mediated) thrombocytopenia or acquired
(often
drug-induced)
platelet
function
abnormalities. This presentation could also
result from a vasculitis, although most
patients with such a problem would likely
appear more ill. The best next steps would be
to obtain a CBC and coagulation studies to
see if you can identify where an abnormality
might be. The CBC reveals a hemoglobin of
12.3 g/dL, a WBC count of 6.5  109/L with
a normal differential, and a platelet count
of 6  109/L. The PT is 12.2 seconds (refer-
ence range, 12.6 to 13.5 s) and the PTT is
30 seconds (range, 26 to 33 s).
4. What do you think now, and what is
your next step?
The patient has isolated thrombocytopenia
with a normal hemoglobin and platelet
count, and no evidence of a clotting factor
deﬁciency. The recent history of a viral
illness is very consistent with ITP. The
absence of any clinically signiﬁcant bleeding
at this point means that no immediate inter-
vention is necessary. The management of
ITP is discussed more fully in Chapter 12.

Von Willebrand
Disease
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most
common
inherited
bleeding
disorder,
affecting as much as 1% of the general
population, and equally affects both genders
as well as all races and ethnicities. The actual
prevalence is difﬁcult to determine, as many
affected individuals are either asymptomatic
or have such mild symptoms that they do
not seek medical attention. While most
patients with VWD have the inherited form,
an acquired form also occurs. The three
characteristic clinical features of the inher-
ited form are excessive mucocutaneous
bleeding, abnormal von Willebrand factor
(VWF) laboratory studies, and a family
history of abnormal bleeding.
VWF is a large multimeric glycoprotein
that is synthesized in megakaryocytes and
endothelial cells. VWD is usually inherited
in an autosomal dominant manner, but a
rare autosomal recessive form and an X-
linked
recessive
form
have
also
been
described. VWD results from either a deﬁ-
ciency or a defect in the VWF protein. This
protein plays two critical roles in hemosta-
sis: the large multimers bind to platelet
glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) causing platelet acti-
vation and adherence to damaged endothe-
lium, and it is the carrier protein for factor
VIII (FVIII), stabilizing it and protecting
it from degradation and clearance from
plasma. This accounts for the prolonged
partial thromboplastin time (PTT) seen in
some patients.
VWD is classiﬁed into three types:
Type 1, found in 70% to 80% of cases, is
characterized by partial deﬁciency of nor-
mally functioning VWF. Type 2 is charac-
terized by functional defects in VWF. It is
divided into four subtypes. Type 2A is char-
acterized by a decreased number of high-
molecular-weight multimers and a concom-
itant decrease in platelet adhesion. The
measured amount of VWF:Ag (antigen) is
normal or only slightly decreased, but the
VWF:RCo (ristocetin cofactor), a measure
of VWF activity, is much lower. Type 2B is
caused by mutations that pathologically
increase platelet–VWF binding, which leads
to the proteolytic degradation and depletion
of large, functional VWF multimers. Circu-
lating platelets are also coated with mutant
VWF, which may prevent the platelets from
adhering at sites of injury. The VWF-coated
platelets often become sequestered in the
microcirculation,
leading
to
thrombo-
cytopenia. Type 2M is characterized by
decreased interaction between VWF and
platelet GPIb on connective tissue. The ratio
ofVWF:RCotoVWF:Ag islow asinType2A,
but the multimer panel appears normal.
Type 2N is marked by decreased binding

between VWF and FVIII, resulting in a phe-
notype of autosomal recessive hemophilia.
Type 3, a rare condition, is characterized by
the almost complete absence of VWF.
The majority of affected patients expe-
rience mucocutaneous bleeding such as epi-
staxis, easy bruising, and menorrhagia in
women. They may also experience posttrau-
matic or postsurgical bleeding. Patients with
severe VWD may experience bleeding into
muscles and joints as well. VWD should be
suspected in the patient with platelet-type
bleeding and a family history of a bleeding
diathesis.
Clinical presentation
The clinical features of VWD can be quite
variable. In most cases of VWD, the bleed-
ing is mild. Mucosal bleeding, such as epi-
staxis, gingival bleeding with tooth brush-
ing, ecchymoses, or menorrhagia, are clas-
sic. The initial presentation, however, may
be postoperative bleeding, such as following
a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy or den-
tal extraction. In retrospect, the child who
was thought to have normal childhood
complaints (bruising and epistaxis) is real-
ized to actually have a bleeding disorder.
Recurrent or severe epistaxis, particularly in
the older child or adult, is unusual and
warrants investigation. It is important to
obtain a thorough medical history of bleed-
ing from the family as this may provide
clues. Since other affected family members
are often unaware that they have the condi-
tion, simply inquiring about a history of
bleeding problems often yields negative
results. Speciﬁc questions such as “Have any
women in the family had hysterectomies
during their child-bearing years because of
intractable uterine bleeding?” or “Do any
men in the family insist on shaving with
an electric razor?” (because of the prolonged
oozing
they
experience
if
they
nick
themselves with a safety razor) can be more
informative. Often, the child is diagnosed
with VWD and then a parent or sibling is
found to have the disorder after screening.
In patients with mild VWD, the stress
associated with serious operations or child-
birth may prevent symptoms. VWF is an
acute phase reactant and the level will fre-
quently increase into the normal range fol-
lowing surgery, in pregnancy, or in patients
with active liver disease or collagen vascular
disease. It can be reduced in hypothyroid-
ism. Even the stress of phlebotomy can
increase the level of VWF, which can
make it difﬁcult to conﬁrm the diagnosis
even with repeat testing. Neonates have
elevated VWF levels following vaginal deliv-
ery, making it difﬁcult to diagnose in the
neonatal period. VWF levels can be up to
25% lower in individuals who are blood
type O, increasing the difﬁculty in distin-
guishing between VWD and normal indivi-
duals with a low VWF level.
Diagnosis
Screening tests are of little value in making
the diagnosis of VWD. The complete blood
count (CBC) may demonstrate iron deﬁ-
ciency anemia if the patient’s blood loss has
been signiﬁcant, but it is nonspeciﬁc. The
rare patient with Type 2B VWD may have
mild thrombocytopenia. If the level of VWF
is sufﬁciently low, the PTT may be prolonged
due to decreased concentration of FVIII, but
this is neither sensitive nor speciﬁc. The
PFA-100 platelet function analyzer is a more
useful screening test for VWD. It measures
the time required for blood, drawn through a
ﬁne capillary, to block a membrane coated
with collagen and epinephrine or collagen
and ADP. Its sensitivity in identifying
patients with VWD is fairly high, but its
speciﬁcity is low. Four speciﬁc tests are used
to diagnose VWD:
72
Chapter 8

1. Factor VIII coagulant (FVIIIc): func-
tional measurement of FVIII coagulant
activity, which is carried in the circulation
by VWF.
2. Von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:
Ag): VWF protein as measured by protein
assays; does not imply functional ability.
Immunologic quantitation of VWF by
either the quantitative immunoelectropho-
retic assay (Laurell assay) or the enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay.
3. Von Willebrand factor activity (VWF:
RCo): ristocetin induces the binding of
VWF to the GPIb receptor on formalin-
ﬁxed platelets. The slope of the platelet
agglutination curve correlates with the level
of plasma VWF.
4. Multimeric analysis: an agarose gel elec-
trophoretic study used to identify quantita-
tive or qualitative multimer abnormalities.
The most common type of VWD (Type 1)
has a normal multimeric analysis.
The classiﬁcation of patients with VWD
based on the results of these tests is pre-
sented in Table 8.1.
Even with these test results, it can be
difﬁcult to determine whether a child has
VWD or not, especially in mild cases. Unlike
hemophilia, there are not clearly deﬁned
levels of VWF antigen or activity that sep-
arate normal patients from those with
VWD. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes
of Health published an algorithm, presented
in Figure 8.1, to assist in identifying affected
individuals while at the same time avoiding
overdiagnosis. Except for patients with
clearly abnormal VWF levels (<30%), the
diagnosis should be made after consultation
with a hematologist.
Treatment
The goal of treatment in VWD is to control
or prevent serious or life-threatening bleed-
ing. There are no effective therapies to limit
the chronic bruising that many active chil-
dren experience, and parents need to be
given assistance to accept that reality. Many
children and adults with Type 1 VWD,
especially males, never require therapy.
Individuals with Type 2 or Type 3 VWD
are much more likely to need treatment at
various times throughout life.
Three strategies are used to treat patients
with VWD: increase the plasma concentra-
tion of VWF by releasing endogenous VWF
stores through stimulation of endothelial
cells with desmopressin, replace VWF by
using human plasma-derived, viral-inacti-
vated concentrates, and use agents that pro-
mote hemostasis and wound healing but do

not substantially alter the plasma concen-
tration of VWF. These strategies are not
mutually exclusive; different bleeding epi-
sodes may require a combination of two or
even all three of these strategies to be
effective.
Desmopressin (DDAVP) is the treat-
ment of choice in mild Type 1 disease
(65% to 80% of all cases) and may be of
beneﬁt with some of the other variants. It
stimulates endogenous release of VWF from
endothelial
cells,
with
most
patients
experiencing a two- to fourfold increase
in their plasma VWF and FVIII levels within
15 to 30 minutes of the infusion. The
approximate half-life of these released fac-
tors is 8 to 10 hours. Occasionally, patients
do not respond to this therapy (especially
children younger than 18 months of age).
The peak effect is observed in 30 to 60
minutes. A therapeutic trial of DDAVP
should be given to determine individual
responsiveness to this therapy with mea-
surement of FVIII and VWF levels before
and after administration. After baseline
levels are obtained, a standard dose of
0.3 mcg/kg is administered intravenously
in 30 to 50 mL of normal saline over 15
to 30 minutes, and levels are measured again
60 minutes after completion of the infusion.
A positive trial is deﬁned as at least a twofold
increase in the VWF:Ag and VWF:RCo
activity. Ninety percent of patients with
Type
1
VWD
demonstrate
a
positive
response to intravenous (IV) DDAVP.
A unique intranasal form of DDAVP
(Stimate, 1500 mcg/mL) is also available to
treat bleeding in VWD. A more dilute form
of DDAVP (100 mcg/mL) is approved for
use in patients with diabetes insipidus but
should not be prescribed for VWD, as it is
impossible to deliver an adequate dose with
this preparation. Stimate is most useful for
individuals with more frequent episodes of
bleeding requiring therapy, such as women
with menorrhagia not controlled using
other measures. Given its high cost and
relatively short shelf life (6 months after
the bottle is opened), it is less suitable for
individuals with very infrequent bleeding
episodes. Although effective, there is some
variability in response due to inconsistent
absorption. Therefore, patients should be
tested for responsiveness prior to prescrib-
ing. The dose for children weighing less
than 50 kg is one spray (150 mcg) once
daily. The effective dose in adolescents and
adults is one spray in each nostril (total
dose of 300 mcg) once daily. The peak
effect is observed 60 to 90 minutes after
administration.
Patients undergoing surgical procedures
such as tonsillectomy or dental extractions
may need extended therapy to maintain
increased levels of VWF and FVIII until
healing has occurred. Studies have demon-
strated that DDAVP can be repeated daily
for up to 4 days with little loss of efﬁcacy as
measured by VWF levels or PFA-100. Pre-
and postinfusion measurements of VWF:Ag
or VWF:RCo can be done to establish con-
tinued clinical responsiveness. However, it
may be difﬁcult to obtain the results of these
tests quickly.
Patients with Type 1 VWD who have
severe bleeding manifestations unrespon-
sive to DDAVP or those patients with
desmopressin-unresponsive Type 2 or 3
disease require treatment with exogenous
VWF. Unlike FVIII replacement products,
there are no recombinant VWF products yet
in clinical use, although one product is being
evaluated in animal models. The FDA has
approved three plasma-derived FVIII/VWF
products, Humate-P, Wilate, and Alphanate
for the treatment of VWD. A fourth plasma-
derived product, Koate DVI, is licensed in
the United States for the treatment of hemo-
philia and is used off-label to treat VWD.
These agents are not identical, and have
differing ratios of FVIII to VWF, so should
not
be
considered
interchangeable.
Von Willebrand Disease
75

Humate-P contains 50 to 100 IU/mL VWF:
RCo activity and 20 to 40 IU/mL FVIII
activity. It has the highest ratio of VWF:
RCo to FVIII activity and the highest con-
centration of high-molecular-weight multi-
mers. Alphanate contains 40 to 180 IU/mL
FVIII activity and at least 16 IU/mL VWF:
RCo activity. The FDA approved Wilate, the
most recently licensed product, in 2010. It
was approved speciﬁcally for use in VWD,
and has essentially equal amounts of VWF:
RCo and FVIII activity. It has demonstrated
both safety and efﬁcacy in patients with
VWD. There are no head-to-head studies
comparing the efﬁcacy of any of these pro-
ducts. Wilate’s packaging promotes more
frequent dosing with lower doses of prod-
uct, which the company states is more
physiological and more cost-effective.
The goal of factor replacement therapy is
to reach a therapeutic level of VWF:RCo
of 100 IU/mL and nadir of >50 IU/mL.
Recommended starting doses are 40 to
60 IU/kg of VWF:RCo activity, followed
by 20 to 40 IU/kg every 8 to 24 hours as
needed to maintain desired levels. Major
surgical procedures should only be per-
formed at centers that have the capability
of measuring VWF activity levels in-house
on a daily basis. To decrease the risk of
thrombotic events, VWF:RCo levels should
be <200 IU/mL, and FVIII levels should be
<250 to 300 IU/mL.
Other adjuvant therapies are available
that are often helpful in managing bleeding
in patients with VWD. Direct pressure is
very effective in managing epistaxis and
bleeding from tooth sockets or lacerations.
Family members must be taught to main-
tain continuous pressure “without peeking”
for at least 20 minutes for best results. If the
bleeding remains uncontrolled, a single dose
of desmopressin is usually effective to stop
bleeding in patients who have shown
responsiveness. Low-estrogen oral contra-
ceptives have been very helpful in control-
ling menorrhagia as they minimize the
amount of endometrial development that
takes place. Minor surgical procedures such
as laceration repairs or dental extractions
can frequently be managed with a single
treatment of desmopressin or factor con-
centrate followed by antiﬁbrinolytic therapy
for 7 to 10 days. Two antiﬁbrinolytic agents
are available, epsilon aminocaproic acid
(Amicar) and tranexamic acid; Amicar is
the more widely used agent. The oral dose of
aminocaproic acid is 100 to 200 mg/kg
(maximum dose, 10 g) as the initial dose,
followed by 100 mg/kg (maximum dose,
5 g) every 6 hours. To maintain effective-
ness, families must be instructed to adhere
to the every 6 hour schedule. The dose of
tranexamic acid is 25 mg/kg/dose every 6 to
8 hours. Both drugs are available in oral and
intravenous forms. These drugs are partic-
ularly effective in minimizing bleeding from
mucosal surfaces due to the increased level
of ﬁbrinolytic activity present in these areas.
Patients with Type 3 VWD have plasma
VWF and FVIII levels that are extremely
low (typically less than 5 IU/dL). Desmo-
pressin is usually ineffective in these cases,
but a therapeutic trial of desmopressin may
be given, as occasionally patients will
respond appropriately. These patients often
have signiﬁcant bleeding including pro-
found epistaxis or hemarthroses similar
to that seen in patients with hemophilia
due to their low levels of both FVIII and
VWF. With bleeding, such patients should
be managed similarly to patients with
hemophilia, using the previously men-
tioned FVIII concentrates that contain
adequate levels of VWF and FVIII.
Patients with Type 2A VWD have abnor-
mally small VWF multimers, and desmo-
pressin, though frequently effective, often
has only a transient effect. Serious bleeding
should be treated with plasma-derived
FVIII/VWF concentrates. These patients
may do well with desmopressin for the
treatment
of
minor
bleeds
or
dental
extractions.
76
Chapter 8

Type 2B VWD is often associated with
mild thrombocytopenia due to excessive
platelet binding to an abnormal VWF
molecule and rapid clearance. Stress can
exacerbate the thrombocytopenia. Desmo-
pressin is usually contraindicated due to
the potential for worsening thrombocyto-
penia and failure to demonstrate a thera-
peutic response. However, in mild bleeding,
desmopressin may be effective. For internal
bleeding or surgery, patients should receive
FVIII/VWF concentrate. If profound throm-
bocytopenia exists, concomitant administra-
tion of platelets may be necessary.
Patients with 2M VWD will demonstrate
an increase in VWF:Ag but not in VWF:RCo
in response to DDAVP, due to the defective
binding of their VWF to GPIb. These
patients routinely require replacement with
FVIII/VWF concentrates for bleeding epi-
sodes or for surgery. Patients with Type 2N
VWD similarly require factor replacement;
although they produce normal amounts of
FVIII, it is destroyed prematurely due to the
inability of their VWF to bind to the FVIII
molecule and protect it. Replacement with
functional VWF will typically normalize their
FVIII levels even if the relative concentration
of FVIII in the product is low since they are
able to produce normal amounts.
Acquired von Willebrand
syndrome
Acquired
von
Willebrand
syndrome
(AVWS) refers to defects in VWF concen-
tration, structure, or function that are not
inherited directly but are consequences of
other medical disorders. It is usually caused
by one of three mechanisms: autoimmune
clearance or inhibition of VWF, increased
shear-induced
proteolysis
of
VWF,
or
increased binding of VWF to platelets or
other cell surfaces. Autoimmune causes of
AVWS in children include postviral anti-
body
production
similar
to
immune
thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), lympho-
proliferative diseases, systemic lupus erythe-
matosus, other autoimmune disorders, and
some
cancers,
most
commonly
Wilms
tumor. Pathologic increases in ﬂuid shear
stress can occur with cardiovascular lesions
such as ventricular septal defect and aortic
stenosis, or with primary pulmonary hyper-
tension. This leads to increased destruction
of VWF, particularly the larger multimers;
the multimer panel often resembles that seen
in Type 2A VWD. Its occurrence in Wilms
tumor and other malignancies is believed to
be due to expression of platelet GPIb on the
tumor cell surface, leading to binding of
VWF to the tumor with subsequent degra-
dation. Hyaluronic acid secretion by nephro-
blastoma cells is another potential mecha-
nism in Wilms tumor patients leading to
decreased efﬁcacy of VWF. Patients may
present with classic signs and symptoms of
VWD and their levels of VWF, VWF:Ag, and
FVIII are typically quite low.
Desmopressin may induce a transient rise
in VWF in AVWS. One small study demon-
strated that intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) at a dose of 1 g/kg/d for 2 days was
beneﬁcial in improving VWF levels and
decreasing clinical bleeding, but this is only
beneﬁcial in immune-mediated AVWS. Plas-
mapheresis, corticosteroids, and immuno-
suppressive agents have also been successful
in these patients. For serious bleeding, treat-
ment with factor concentrate (high VWF
content) should be given. The antibodies
typically disappear with control or resolution
of the underlying disease.
Other considerations
As a general precaution, all children with
bleeding disorders should be immunized with
the hepatitis B vaccine, with boosters given at
appropriate time intervals, since these chil-
dren have a lifelong potential for receiving
blood products. Patients and families should
Von Willebrand Disease
77

be counseled to avoid aspirin, NSAIDs, and
other platelet-inhibiting drugs. Also, it is
generally recommended that children wear
MedicAlert bracelets and have information
readily available (at school, home, and doc-
tor’s ofﬁce) specifying the diagnosis and
treatment for bleeding.

Hemophilia
Hemophilia is deﬁned as an inherited bleed-
ing disorder caused by low levels, or
absence, of a blood protein that is essential
for clotting. The congenital hemophilias are
uncommon disorders, with a total incidence
of 10 to 20 per 100,000 births. The most
common form is factor VIII (FVIII) deﬁ-
ciency (hemophilia A or classic hemo-
philia), with an estimated incidence of 1
in 5000 males. The second most common
form is factor IX (FIX) deﬁciency (hemo-
philia B), with an incidence of approxi-
mately 1 in 25,000 males. Both the FVIII
and FIX genes are carried on the X chro-
mosome; thus, both hemophilia A and B are
X-linked recessive disorders. Approximately
80% of hemophilia patients have hemo-
philia A and 20% have hemophilia B. Both
disorders are found throughout the world
and do not appear to have any ethnic or
racial predisposition.
Hemophilia A and B are clinically indis-
tinguishable since both FVIII and FIX are
essential factors in the intrinsic clotting
pathway for activating factor X (FX). Factor
levels are measured in comparison to a
reference standard that is assumed to have
a factor level of 100% (1.0 IU/mL). In the
normalindividual, FVIII and FIX levelsrange
from 50% to 200% (0.50 to 2.0IU/mL).
Disease severity is deﬁned as severe (<1%),
moderate (1% to 5%), and mild (6% to
50%). The frequency of bleeding symptoms
generally correlates well with the measured
residual factor activity. Boys with severe
hemophilia bleed with minimal trauma and
bleeding symptoms are usually apparent by
the time the infant begins to crawl or walk,
whereas those with mild hemophilia usually
bleed only with signiﬁcant trauma or surgery
and may have a delayed diagnosis.
Several other congenital factor deﬁcien-
cies have been described as well, but are all
very uncommon. They are described in
Table 9.1.
Aﬁbrinogenemia is associated with fre-
quent and serious bleeding. Spontaneous
bleeding is rare if the ﬁbrinogen level is
>50mg/dL. The thrombin time (TT) is the
most sensitive test to diagnose this disorder.
Hypoprothrombinemia is an autosomal
recessive disorder associated with mild bleed-
ing. All patients have some prothrombin
activity. Prothrombin deﬁciency also occurs
in patients with vitamin K deﬁciency, liver
disease, and warfarin use. Factor V (FV)
deﬁciency is often characterized by bleeding
from mucous membranes including epi-
staxis, menorrhagia, and bleeding after dental
procedures. Congenital deﬁciency of both FV
and FVIII can occur as a result of a mutation
in the ERGIC-53 gene, which acts as a chap-
erone for intracellular transport of these
factors through the endoplasmic reticulum.

Patients with factor VII deﬁciency who have
levels less than 1% have bleeding symptoms
similar to that of classic hemophilia with
hemarthrosis,
intramuscular
hemorrhage,
and
intracranial
hemorrhage
(ICH).
Heterozygotes are typically asymptomatic.
Two-thirds of patients with factor X (FX)
deﬁciency have hemarthroses and hemato-
mas. The proportion of patients with FX
deﬁciency who require treatment is higher
than that of the other rare coagulation
deﬁciencies. Factor XI (FXI) deﬁciency is
characterized by mucocutaneous and geni-
tourinary tract bleeding; the likelihood of
bleeding does not correlate well with mea-
sured FXI levels. Only individuals with factor
XIII (FXIII) deﬁciency whose levels are
<1% are symptomatic. Bleeding manifesta-
tions
include
soft-tissue
hemorrhages,
hemarthroses, and hematomas, and patients
undergoing surgery or trauma may experi-
ence poor wound healing.
Alpha2-antiplasmin deﬁciency, factor XII
deﬁciency, prekallikrein (Fletcher’s factor)
deﬁciency, and high-molecular-weight kini-
nogen (Fitzgerald’s factor) deﬁciency have
also been identiﬁed using appropriate clot-
ting measurements. Alpha2-antiplasmin is
the primary inhibitor of plasmin, a key com-
ponent of the ﬁbrinolytic pathway. Patients
with a2-antiplasmin deﬁciency are unable to
effectively inhibit plasmin, and therefore lyse
clots abnormally quickly leading to abnormal
bleeding. As clots are formed normally, all the
usual screening coagulation tests are normal
except for the euglobulin and urea clot lysis
tests. Factor XII (FXII) deﬁciency, prekal-
likrein
deﬁciency,
and
high-molecular-
weight kininogen deﬁciency all cause pro-
longation of the PTT but are not associated
with clinical hemorrhage.
Clinical presentation
Boys with hemophilia may develop symp-
toms very early in life, experiencing a
hemorrhage after circumcision or with sep-
aration of the umbilical cord. However, up
to 50% of affected male infants have no
difﬁculty during the neonatal period, and
a negative history of bleeding after circum-
cision does not rule out the diagnosis of
hemophilia.
Mild
hemophilia
may
go
unsuspected for years until the patient
experiences trauma or has a surgical proce-
dure.
Conversely,
patients
with
severe
hemophilia often experience spontaneous
hemorrhages, both externally and inter-
nally, into the head, joints, muscles, and
retroperitoneum. Bleeding from the mouth
or frenulum often occurs during infancy,

and minimal lacerations may cause very
prolonged bleeding. Intramuscular injec-
tions (as with immunizations) often result
in
large
hematomas.
Joint
hematomas
(hemarthroses) can result in secondary joint
degeneration. Life-threatening blood loss
can occur with intramuscular bleeds. ICH
occurs in 2% to 14% of hemophilia patients
and is associated with an 18% mortality.
Although ICH is much more common in
severe hemophilia, it has been reported in
patients with mild hemophilia as well.
ICH is the most serious complication in
hemophilia. A history of trauma is elicited
in only 20% to 25% of patients with central
nervous system (CNS) hemorrhages, and
there may be a delay of days or weeks before
symptoms develop. Bleeding can be intra-
cerebral, subdural, subarachnoid, or epidu-
ral. Patients who survive these episodes
frequently experience complications such
as mental retardation, seizure disorders,
or motor impairment. Any history of head
trauma should be considered emergent. A
nonfocal neurologic examination does not
exclude a diagnosis of an intracranial bleed.
Any suspicion of a signiﬁcant intracranial
injury should prompt a head CT and close
neurological observation. Immediate treat-
ment to achieve a factor level of 80% to
100% should be provided and maintained
until an intracranial bleed can be fully
excluded.
An
intraspinal
hemorrhage
should be excluded with any back trauma
or symptoms of a peripheral neuropathy. A
lumbar puncture should never be per-
formed in a hemophilia patient without
factor therapy to avoid this complication.
Hemarthroses appear in young children
as they become mobile. The elbows are often
ﬁrst affected as the infant begins crawling,
followed by shoulders, wrists, hips, knees,
and ankles. The hands and spine are rarely
involved. The initial signs of a hemarthrosis
are vague and difﬁcult to detect, especially
in the nonverbal infant. Early, aggressive
treatment of an acute hemarthrosis is
recommended to relieve symptoms and
hopefully prevent recurrent bleeding into
the same joint, setting up the situation of
a “target” joint.
Bleeding into muscle is characterized by
pain and limitation of mobility. They can be
difﬁcult to evaluate, particularly if they
occur in deep muscles such as the iliopsoas
muscle (see below). They can result in long-
term complications such as permanent
muscle contractures. It is important to
exclude any potential neurovascular com-
promise that can result from compression of
adjacent nerves.
An iliopsoas hemorrhage can be quite
devastating due both to the long-term con-
sequences and to the large volume of blood
loss that can occur acutely into this large
muscle bed and into the retroperitoneal
space. The presenting signs of groin or lower
abdominal/upper thigh pain can be difﬁcult
to differentiate from a hip bleed. With an
iliopsoas bleed, examination reveals inabil-
ity to extend the hip, with normal internal
and external hip rotation. Radiologic con-
ﬁrmation by CT scan is recommended.
Soft tissue hemorrhages occur very
commonly and do not require therapy
unless their location is near vital structures.
For instance, a retropharyngeal bleed with
potential airway compromise should be
aggressively treated. Vigorous examination
of the oropharynx with a tongue blade or
other manipulations should be avoided to
prevent injury with subsequent hemor-
rhage. A “straddle” injury resulting in a
hematoma of the perineal/perirectal area
should be closely evaluated for neurologic
compromise as evidenced by either bladder
or bowel dysfunction.
About 70% of hemophilia patients will
have at least one episode of hematuria.
Usually, these episodes are painless, thus
if there is severe pain associated with hema-
turia, a thrombosis in the renal pelvis
Hemophilia
81

should be excluded. Increased ﬂuid intake
and bed rest is recommended. Factor
replacement may be warranted with per-
sistent symptoms. Treatment with antiﬁ-
brinolytic drugs is contraindicated given
the risk of upper urinary tract obstruction
caused by clot.
Epistaxis occurs in hemophilia patients,
most commonly in those with severe dis-
ease. Gastrointestinal bleeding can also
occur but is atypical; an underlying gastro-
intestinal lesion should be excluded. Intra-
mural bleeding into the bowel wall can
occur, with signs of severe pain and possible
intestinal obstruction. Appropriate therapy
may avoid an unnecessary laparotomy.
Prolonged gingival oozing is common
after shedding of deciduous teeth, eruption
of new teeth, or instrumentation. Treatment
with
an
antiﬁbrinolytic
medication
is
recommended for prolonged symptoms.
Routine dental care is particularly important
in the patient with a bleeding disorder to
prevent the need for restorative care in the
future where extensive factor replacement
therapy is often indicated. Regional block
anesthesia is discouraged, even with factor
coverage, given the risk of hemorrhage that
can lead to nerve damage and extension into
the neck causing airway compromise.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis of FVIII deﬁciency should be
suspected in males presenting with a char-
acteristic bleeding history, especially if there
is a family history of males with abnormal
bleeding. However, 30% of patients with
hemophilia A and B have spontaneous
mutations and no family history of abnor-
mal bleeding. A prolonged PTT in conjunc-
tion with a normal PT and platelet count is
suggestive of the diagnosis; this can be
conﬁrmed by speciﬁcally measuring levels
of FVIII and FIX.
Newborn males with a possible or con-
ﬁrmed diagnosis of hemophilia should be
carefully evaluated for an intracranial hem-
orrhage, especially if delivered via assisted
vaginal delivery (vacuum extraction or
forceps). However, infants delivered via
cesarean section are also at risk for severe
bleeding. The initial PTT can be performed
on cord blood, but it must be remembered
that the upper limit of normal for newborns
is longer than for adults. The normal range
for FVIII levels in the newborn is the same as
for adults, but FIX levels are lower until the
concentrations of factors produced by the
liver mature to adult levels (approximately 6
months of age). Therefore, the diagnosis of
hemophilia B may be more difﬁcult initially.
Conﬁrmatory studies should be performed
on a sample obtained by venipuncture if a
cord blood sample was initially obtained.
Arterial as well as femoral or jugular venous
sites to obtain plasma samples should be
avoided if possible. Prenatal testing for both
conditions is available to pregnant women
who are known carriers.
Treatment
After the newborn period, affected infants
rarely require treatment until they become
more mobile with increasing age. Treatment
recommendations
for
the
hemophilia
patient depend on several factors: the type
and severity of disease (mild, moderate, or
severe; FVIII or FIX deﬁciency); the site of
the bleed (proximity to vital structures)
with consideration of long-term debilitating
consequences; and therapy response (factor
recovery/survival and inhibitor status).
Treatment of patients with hemophilia
and bleeding is by replacement of factor in a
concentrated
form.
Many
high-purity
plasma-derived preparations are currently
available, as are recombinant FVIII and FIX
products. Most experts feel that hemophilia
82
Chapter 9

patients who have not been previously trea-
ted with plasma-derived products should be
treated with only recombinant products.
There are two treatment strategies cur-
rently used for patients with hemophilia.
Episodic or on-demand treatment involves
providing treatment at the time a bleeding
episode occurs. Prophylactic therapy is the
periodic infusion of factor replacement to
prevent such bleeding episodes. A number
of single institutional case series have dem-
onstrated the superiority of prophylaxis
regimens in the prevention of joint disease,
but widespread adoption of this strategy for
all patients has been limited by the high cost
of factor replacement therapy and the chal-
lenge of adequate vascular access, particu-
larly in young patients.
When providing on-demand therapy,
the duration, frequency, and doses of factor
provided depend on the severity of the
hemophilia and bleeding episode. Factor
vials vary in the number of units of
factor activity they contain. The required
factor dose should be calculated, and vials
should then be selected that come closest to
the calculated target dose. Doses are calcu-
lated using the following formula:
Dose ðunits of FVIIIÞ ¼ Weight ðkgÞ
 desired % rise of FVIII level  0:5
For FIX, multiply result by 2, for recom-
binant FIX, multiply by 2.4.
Round up to the whole vial since factor is
expensive and not uniformly dispersed in
suspension. Table 9.2 outlines the dose and
duration of therapy for commonly encoun-
tered
bleeding
episodes
in
hemophilia
patients. More serious bleeding episodes
should be treated using doses at the higher
end of the range.
Other important interventions for a
hemarthrosis include initial immobilization
and application of ice to the area or use of a
cryocuff. For particularly critical joints such
as the shoulder or hip, where long-term
consequences of pressure-induced avascular
necrosis can be debilitating, a longer treat-
ment course is recommended. Iliopsoas
bleeds should be treated as retroperitoneal
rather than as muscle bleeds.

Inhibitors
The development of an inhibitor, an anti-
body that inactivates the coagulant func-
tion of replacement factor, is one of the
most serious complications of hemophilia
treatment. FVIII inhibitors develop in 20%
to 30% of boys with severe hemophilia A,
whereas FIX inhibitors develop in 3% to
5% with severe hemophilia B. These usu-
ally develop within the ﬁrst 50 exposures to
factor replacement. Risk factors for inhib-
itor development include the nature of the
underlying mutation, with those leading
to substantial loss of coding information
representing greater risk, high-intensity
product exposure, CNS bleeding, and Afri-
can-American race. Inhibitors are quanti-
tated by Bethesda titers: one Bethesda unit
(BU) is the amount of inhibitor that inac-
tivates 50% of FVIII function in a one-stage
clotting assay. Low-titer inhibitors (<5
BU) can be managed by using larger doses
of factor replacement; higher titer inhibi-
tors require the use of alternative hemostatic
agents. Alternative agents include prothrom-
bin complex concentrates (PCCs), activated
PCCs (aPCCs), and recombinant factor VIIa
(rFVIIa). Immune tolerance induction with
high, frequent doses of FVIII or FIX has also
been successful. Management of patients
with inhibitors is difﬁcult and complex and
should be performed only by experienced
hematologists.
Other considerations
In addition to aggressive factor replacement
when bleeding has occurred and the use of
physical therapy programs to prevent or min-
imize chronic joint disease, comprehensive
medical care must be provided to all patients
with hemophilia. All immunizations includ-
ing hepatitis B vaccine should be given on
schedule. Regular dental care is essential to
prevent excessive decay and gingival disease
that may predispose to complications. Psy-
chological support is essential to assist patients
and families cope with the emotional and
social burden imposed by the disease. A com-
prehensive program of patient and family
education will prevent complications caused
by failure to recognize or understand warning
signs of hemorrhage as well as empower
family members and eventually the patient
to take an active role in the management of the
disease. Education in home treatment is vital,
and should be used whenever possible, as
speed in the treatment of bleeding, especially
hemarthroses, is directly related to minimizing
long-term complications of the disease.

The Child with
Thrombosis
Virchow’s triad describes risk factors for
thrombus (blood clot) formation: (1) venous
stasis, (2) endothelial injury, and (3) hyper-
coagulability. Hypercoagulability, also called
thrombophilia or a prothrombotic state, is
deﬁned as a propensity to develop throm-
bosis secondary to aberrations in the coag-
ulation system. Thrombophilia is becoming
increasingly recognized in pediatric patients
and can refer to multiple potential condi-
tions: (1) spontaneous thrombus formation,
(2) recurrent thrombosis, (3) thrombosis out
of proportion to the underlying risk factor,
and (4) thrombosis at a young age.
Optimal prevention and treatment in
pediatric patients with thrombosis differs
from adult patients for several reasons.
These include physiologic age-dependent
differences in the hemostatic system that
inﬂuence the risk for venous thromboem-
bolism, differing underlying etiologies and
location of clots, and differing responses to
antithrombotic agents. Little evidence exists
as how best to manage pediatric patients
with thrombosis, both from a diagnostic
and from a treatment standpoint. Much
of the currently utilized data is based on
adult studies, and here we summarize the
generally accepted recommendations in lieu
of evidence-based pediatric guidelines (see
Figure 10.1).
Evaluation of thrombosis
Pediatric patients may have both congenital
and acquired risk factors underlying throm-
bus formation. The single most common
acquired risk factor for venous thromboem-
bolism is the presence of a central venous
catheter (e.g., endothelial injury). Other
acquired risk factors include trauma, surgery,
infection, nephrotic syndrome, inﬂammatory
syndromes, diabetes, complex congenital
heart disease, liver disease, and malignancy
(e.g., acute lymphoblastic leukemia in asso-
ciation with the use of asparaginase or solid
tumors with tumor thrombus). Asymptom-
atic patients may be found to have an
incidental clot on imaging, or the patient
may be symptomatic, most often with swell-
ing, pain, or erythema in an extremity.
Venous ultrasonography with Doppler ﬂow
remains the cornerstone of evaluation for
thrombosis, as in adults. Lack of venous
compression or Doppler ﬂow is diagnostic
for thrombus. This imaging modality is
limited to the extremities, neck, distal sub-
clavian veins, and potentially, distal iliac
veins. Echocardiography can be utilized to
evaluate for atrial clots and the proximal
superior and inferior vena cava. Imaging of
the abdomen and pelvis as well as the upper
venous system requires CT or magnetic

resonance venography (MRV). Similarly,
sinus venous thrombosis must be eva-
luated by magnetic resonance imaging/
arteriography
(MRI/MRA).
Pulmonary
emboli or thrombosis can be identiﬁed with
a helical CT scan.
Testing for thrombophilia
Although often undertaken, clear guidelines
are lacking as to the utility of testing for an
underlying hypercoagulable state. In the
patient with a known acquired risk factor
and secondary thrombosis, it is unclear that
testing for thrombophilia will aid in the
management of the patient (e.g., asymptom-
atic catheter-related thrombosis). Patients
might have a single-trait thrombophilia on
testing, but this alone may not contribute
signiﬁcantly
to

with deﬁciencies in protein C and S and
antithrombin III could beneﬁt from testing
and factor replacement if found to be deﬁ-
cient. For patients with spontaneous throm-
bosis, often found in adolescents (e.g.,
adolescent female starting oral contracep-
tives) and in neonates (secondary to stroke
or sinus venous thrombosis), testing should
be considered. For patients with a symptom-
atic catheter-related thrombosis or for an
asymptomatic patient with a positive family
history, the decision to test for thrombophi-
lia must be made on an individual basis after
appropriate family counseling. The family
must be advised that a positive screen for a
single thrombophilia trait will not result in a
change in management and may lead to
unnecessary anxiety. Similarly, negative test-
ing may give false reassurance and does not
completely abrogate the potential for throm-
bosis. The primary thrombophilia traits are
listed in Table 10.1.

Management of thrombosis
Managementofpediatric thrombosis isagain
based on adult studies and expert guidelines.
Removal of the precipitating agent should be
doneaspossibleincaseswithanacquiredrisk
factor. Treatment of thrombosis is under-
taken to prevent clot propagation, pulmo-
nary embolus, and the postthrombotic syn-
drome (PTS). Although reported frequently
in adults, PTS is poorly understood in chil-
dren but can potentially lead to chronic pain,
swelling, skin changes, and collateral venous
formation. The decision to initially utilize a
thrombolytic (tissue plasminogen activator,
TPA) versus an anticoagulant (unfractio-
nated heparin, UH or low-molecular-weight
heparin, LMWH) must be made in consul-
tation with a pediatric hematologist. In some
cases, thrombectomy or thrombolysis by
intervention radiology should be considered.
Thrombolysis
In general, a thrombolytic should be con-
sidered in patients with an occlusive throm-
bus without signiﬁcant risk factors for
bleeding (recent surgery, central nervous
system hemorrhage). Patients with a long-
standing occlusive thrombus (i.e., >14 days)
or without evidence of improvement on
imaging studies after 24 to 48 hours of
TPA therapy may beneﬁt from thrombect-
omy or thrombolysis by interventional
radiology. Although not evidence based,
we typically treat with low-dose systemic
TPA
as
suggested
by
Manco-Johnson
(see suggested further reading) at a dose
of 0.03 to 0.06 mg/kg/h with a maximum
of 2 mg/h for 24 to 48 hours to decrease
the risk of signiﬁcant hemorrhage that is
seen with bolus TPA, unless there is a life-
threatening clot (e.g., massive pulmonary
embolism). Arterial clots may beneﬁt from
a higher systemic dose for a shorter time
period. Also if possible, TPA should be
instilled distal to the clot in order to decrease
ﬁrst-pass liver metabolism, although this is
mitigated with the use of systemic TPA as it is
expected that much of the TPA will bypass
theobstructionthroughcollateralcirculation.
Patients receiving systemic low-dose TPA
therapy should have close monitoring of
coagulation
studies
(prothrombin
time
[PT],partial thromboplastin time[PTT],and
ﬁbrinogen), platelets, and plasminogen to
ensure hemostatic and ﬁbrinolytic potential
and theneed for potential repletionwithfresh
frozen plasma (FFP).
Anticoagulation
If TPA is thought to pose signiﬁcant risk, or
if the patient has a nonocclusive thrombus
or transient risk factors, UH or LMWH may
be started. UH is a natural anticoagulant
and works by complexing to the physiologic
inhibitor antithrombin III (ATIII), acceler-
ating the inhibition of thrombin and other
coagulant proteins. It is therefore important
to ensure adequate levels of ATIII when
administering
heparin.
Many
potential
issues are present with UH usage in chil-
dren: (1) rapid clearance, (2) low ATIII
levels in the ﬁrst few months of life,
(3) greater variability in dosing compared
to adults, and (4) lack of evidence assessing
the optimal target PTT range for the preven-
tion and treatment of venous thromboem-
bolism. The patient must also be monitored
for the development of heparin antibodies
that can most notably lead to heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Long-
term usage can also lead to osteoporosis.
LMWH is more widely utilized now due
to a more narrow dosing range and wide
therapeutic window secondary to direct
targeting of Factor Xa as well as reduced
incidence of HIT and osteoporosis.
In general, we utilize LMWH unless
there is potential need for immediate rever-
sal of anticoagulation. Although protamine
can be utilized with LMWH, the reversal
effect is not complete (thought to be about
88
Chapter 10

two-thirds effective) and therefore a risk of
bleeding can still be present if, for instance,
surgical intervention is required emergently.
In these cases, UH should be utilized due to
its short half-life and ability to be fully
reversed. UH is generally given at a loading
dose of 75 U/kg followed by a maintenance
dose of 20 U/kg/h with a goal PTT of 2 to
3 the upper limit of the reference range or,
preferably, anti-Xa levels of 0.3 to 0.7 U/mL,
if available in a timely manner. Currently,
the only LMWH approved by the FDA for
pediatric patients is enoxaparin, with a half-
life of 4 hours and subcutaneous dosing. For
treatment of thrombosis, enoxaparin must
be given every 12 hours, usually starting at
1.0 to 1.25 mg/kg (see Formulary and
Manco-Johnson for more speciﬁc dosing
guidelines). Treatment effectiveness is fol-
lowed by anti-Xa levels, with goal levels of
0.5 to 1.0 U/mL (checked 4 hours after the
second or subsequent dose). For prophy-
laxis, 0.5 mg/kg is typically given twice daily.
Anti-Xa levels do not need to be checked
with prophylactic dosing. In practice, some
hematologists utilize 1 mg/kg once daily for
prophylaxis, although available data suggest
this may undertreat a group of patients,
especially those <5 years of age.
Concomitant use of TPA and UH or
LMWH may also be beneﬁcial in clot lysis
without signiﬁcantly increasing hemorrhagic
risk, although again this recommendation is
not evidence-based in pediatric patients and
must be determined on a per patient basis in
consultation with a pediatric hematologist,
weighing the potential risks of hemorrhage
and potential beneﬁts of clot lysis. Therapeu-
ticefﬁcacycansimplybefollowedwithrepeat
imaging, although this can be difﬁcult with
central venous clots that may require multi-
ple CT or MRI with resultant increased radi-
ation exposure and cost, respectively. Other
potential markers to follow for clot lysis
include d-dimers or ﬁbrin-split products
which should increase with lysis, although
marker elevation may be confounded by
continuing inﬂammation.
Duration of therapy
Duration of therapy depends on multiple
factors including the time to removal of
inciting agents such as central venous cathe-
ters,
presence
of
thrombophilia
traits,
and time to clot resolution. Patients initially
treated with TPA or UH therapy should be
transitioned to LMWH or warfarin therapy
for long-term maintenance. Because of the
time required to reach an appropriate ther-
apeutic level, warfarin therapy should begin
at least 48 hours prior to discontinuation of
heparin therapy. Maintenance with LMWH
is frequently used due to the difﬁculty in
maintaining a therapeutic international nor-
malized ratio (INR) with warfarin therapy.
For patients with clot resolution, antic-
oagulation should be continued at prophy-
lactic dosing for 6 weeks to 3 months after
removal of the inciting agent (e.g., central
venous catheter) due to the likelihood of
continued endothelial injury. For patients
without clot resolution (potentially after inef-
fective interventional thrombectomy and/or
thrombolysis), anticoagulation should be
continued for 6 to 12 months to potentially
decrease or resolve the clot and prevent the
development of PTS. Patients that had a
spontaneous or recurrent thrombus and were
found to have multitrait thrombophilia (3
traits) or antiphospholipid syndrome should
continue life-long anticoagulation.
New agents
Multiple new agents will be available in the
near future for pediatric patients and are
summarized in Table 10.2.
Case study for review
You are seeing a 17-year-old female in clinic
who is deciding on whether to start oral

contraceptive pills (OCPs). She has an aunt
that had a “blood clot” when she was in her
ﬁfties. Your patient does not know any
further details about the incident but does
know about the potential increased risk of
blood clots with oral contraceptive pills.
1. What advice would you give the patient?
2. She asks about testing for clotting risk
factors, what do you advise her?
All patients who are starting OCPs should
be made aware of the increased risk of blood
clots with estrogen-containing contracep-
tives (about a three times increased risk).
This risk is thought to be about 2 to 3 per
10,000 per year on OCPs, or about 0.02% to
0.03% incidence per year (baseline risk
being approximately 0.008% per year).
Single-trait
thrombophilias,
most
com-
monly Factor V Leiden mutation, increase
this risk signiﬁcantly. Speciﬁcally for Factor
V Leiden, the risk for a heterozygous carrier
increases the risk approximately 30 times to
a yearly incidence of 0.6% to 0.9%. This
incidence is also highest in the ﬁrst year of
OCP usage.
Thrombophilia testing can be considered
on an individual basis for the patient wish-
ing to start OCPs who has a family member
with a known thrombophilia. Additionally,
the patient should be offered alternative
lower risk forms of contraception. In this
case, the practitioner should try to get
more information regarding the episode
of thromboembolism in the aunt. Were
there acquired risk factors such as trauma,
surgery,
or
immobility?
Was
the
clot
thought to be spontaneous? If so, was the
aunt tested for thrombophilia?
Current recommendations would not
advise testing your patient without further
information. If the aunt had a spontaneous
thrombus,
one
could
advise
that
she
should be tested for thrombophilia, and if
found to be positive your patient could be
tested as well. If it was determined that
there was an underlying risk factor in the
aunt’s thromboembolism, testing her and/
or your patient would not be advised. In the

The Neutropenic Child
Neutrophils are a key component in the
defense against infection. They contain toxic
cytoplasmic granules that, following inges-
tion of infecting bacteria and fungi, are
released into the phagocytic vacuole and
destroy them. Once released from the bone
marrow, they circulate in the blood for a
brief time (4 to 6 hours) before leaving the
circulation and entering the tissue where, in
response to the presence of infection, they
act to control the infection while sending
chemotactic signals to recruit additional
neutrophils to the area and stimulate the
accelerated production of neutrophils in the
bone marrow. While the presence of ade-
quate neutrophil numbers in the tissue is the
best predictor of the patient’s ability to ﬁght
infection, there is no easy clinical method to
determine the number of tissue neutrophils,
so the number present in the blood is used
as a surrogate marker.
Neutropenia has traditionally been de-
ﬁned as a decrease in the absolute neutro-
phil count (ANC) to <1.5  109/L. The
ANC is calculated by multiplying the white
blood cell count by the total percentage of
segmented
(mature)
neutrophils
plus
bands. Mild neutropenia is deﬁned as an
ANC of 1.0 to 1.5  109/L, moderate neu-
tropenia is an ANC of 0.5 to 1.0  109/L,
and severe neutropenia is an ANC below
0.5  109/L. This division is useful for
determining the individual’s risk for infec-
tion and the urgency of medical interven-
tion. However, this deﬁnition fails to take
into account important variations in nor-
mal neutrophil number related to age and
ethnicity. Up to 25% of young African-
American children
will have an ANC
between 1.0 and 1.5  109/L, and this level
should be considered normal in this group.
Also, the normal range for ANC extends
down to 1.0  109/L in infants between 2
weeks and 6 months of age, and should not
be considered abnormal if less than this.
Risk assessment
The ﬁrst question when evaluating a child
with neutropenia is: “What is the risk
that this patient has or will develop a life-
threatening infection?” This is particularly
pertinent if the patient presents with fever.
The susceptibility to bacterial infection in
neutropenic patients is quite variable and
depends on a number of factors. The ﬁrst
is the severity of neutropenia, as described
above. Patients with mild neutropenia have
minimal to no increased risk of infection,
those with moderate neutropenia have a
mildly increased risk of frequent or severe
infections, and those with severe neutropenia
are highly susceptible to bacterial infection.
Handbook of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology: Children’s Hospital & Research Center Oakland,
Second Edition. Caroline A. Hastings, Joseph C. Torkildson, and Anurag K. Agrawal.
 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Published 2012 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, patients who are neutropenic as a
result of cytotoxic therapy (e.g., chemother-
apy and radiation) may be at an increased
risk of infection because of the rate of decline
of the neutrophil count or other immuno-
suppressive effects of chemotherapy, even
before the ANC falls below 0.5 109/L.
Another factor is the cause of the neutrope-
nia, if known. Patients with neutropenia
caused by intrinsic bone marrow failure or
hypoplasia have a greater risk of infection
than those whose neutropenia is due to
factors extrinsic to the bone marrow such
as
excessive
neutrophil
destruction
or
sequestration (immune neutropenia and
splenomegaly, respectively). While patients
with extrinsic neutropenia may have a low
circulating neutrophil count, their tissue
counts are near normal and they are more
protected from infection. A third factor is the
presence or absence of other phagocytic cells.
Many patients with chronic neutropenia
have an elevated circulating monocyte count,
which provides some additional protection
against
pyogenic
organisms.
Conversely,
patients being treated with steroids or other
immunosuppressive therapy will have treat-
ment-related abnormalities in cell-mediated,
humoral, and macrophage–monocyte immu-
nity and may be at increased risk of invasive
infection even with a normal neutrophil
count. Patients with a history of splenectomy
have an increased risk of overwhelming infec-
tion caused by encapsulated bacteria regard-
less of their neutrophil count.
The age at presentation with neutropenia
is an important factor in risk assessment.
The younger the child is at the time of
diagnosis, the greater the concern that the
patient could have a severe form of chronic
neutropenia, whereas children who are
found to be neutropenic later in life and
who do not have a history of frequent
bacterial infections or chronic illness are
more likely to have a more benign form
of neutropenia.
Etiology of neutropenia
A large variety of conditions can lead to
neutropenia in childhood. They can be clas-
siﬁed as being either acquired causes or
inherited causes. Of these, acquired causes
are much more frequent. These are pre-
sented in Table 11.1.
Viral infection is the most common
cause of mild-to-moderate neutropenia.
Transient marrow suppression is seen in
children with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),
respiratory syncytial virus, inﬂuenza A and
B, hepatitis, human herpesvirus-6 (HHV6),
varicella, rubella, and rubeola. This typically
lasts for 3 to 8 days. Neutropenia can also be
seen in the setting of overwhelming bacte-
rial infection as well as with typhoid fever,
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tuber-
culosis. Phagocytosis of microbes leads to
release of toxic metabolites, which then
activate the complement system, inducing
neutrophil aggregation and adherence of
leukocytes to the pulmonary capillary bed.
Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1,
released by macrophages, likely accelerate
this process. Activated granulocytes seques-
tered in the lungs may cause acute cardio-
pulmonary complications. Neonates have a
limited granulocyte pool in their bone mar-
row, which can be exhausted rapidly during
overwhelming bacterial sepsis.
Replacement of the bone marrow (as
occurs with hematologic malignancies, gly-
cogenstoragediseases,granulomasassociated
withinfection,andﬁbrosisrelatedtochemical
or radiation injury or osteoporosis) results in
neutropenia. Frequently, the erythroid and
megakaryocytic lines are also affected.
Medications are a common cause of neu-
tropenia. Neutropenia is a common and
expected side effect of anticancer therapy.
Many chemotherapeutic agents have a direct
toxic effect on the early marrow stem cells.
The severity and duration of the neutropenia
depend on the particular medication and
The Neutropenic Child

dosage as well as the patient’s underlying
disease, state of nutrition, and general health.
Many other medications can induce neutro-
penia, including antibiotics (chlorampheni-
col, cephalosporins, penicillins, and sulfona-
mides),
anticonvulsants
(phenytoin
and
valproic acid), anti-inﬂammatory agents,
cardiovascular
agents,
tranquilizers,
and
hypoglycemic agents. The severity and dura-
tion of drug-induced neutropenia are vari-
able. The underlying mechanism is not
known, although studies with certain drugs
have led to various hypotheses including
immune-mediated destruction, toxic effect
of the drug or metabolites on the marrow
stem cells, and toxic effects on the marrow
microenvironment. After withdrawal of the
drug, the marrow can repopulate with early
myeloid forms within 3 to 4 days and appear
morphologically normal by 1 to 2 weeks.
The duration of neutropenia is likely related
to the underlying mechanism; some chronic
idiosyncratic drug reactions can last from
months to years.
Autoimmune neutropenia is another
common cause of neutropenia following a

viral infection, and may be difﬁcult to dis-
tinguish from virus-associated marrow sup-
pression due to the difﬁculty in identifying
antineutrophil antibodies. Unlike viral sup-
pression, autoimmune neutropenia can per-
sist for 7 to 24 months, and affected children
occasionally suffer from infections of the
ear, lung, skin, or other sites.
Neonatal alloimmune neutropenia is
analogous to Rh-related hemolytic disease
of the newborn; mothers generate IgG anti-
bodies against paternal neutrophil antigens
expressed on fetal neutrophils. These anti-
bodies cross the placenta and cause neutro-
penia in the fetus and newborn.
“Chronic idiopathic” neutropenia, also
known as chronic benign neutropenia of
childhood, is likely caused by a variety of
disorders without a unifying etiology. It is
likely that many of these children in fact
have autoimmune neutropenia or familial
benign neutropenia. They often have mild-
to-moderate neutropenia; the susceptibility
to infection is roughly proportionate to the
degree of neutropenia. The blood neutro-
phil count remains stable over years, and
becomes elevated in response to an infection
in a subset of children. Spontaneous remis-
sions at 2 to 4 years of age have been
reported. Affected individuals have normal
life expectancies. Evaluation of the bone
marrow
shows
decreased
myelopoiesis
(often with monocytosis), and there is con-
siderable variability in the stage at which
maturation is arrested. These patients are at
low risk for the development of serious
infections, and no treatment is required
except during infectious episodes.
Splenomegaly from any cause including
chronic hemolytic anemia, portal hyperten-
sion, liver disease, and storage disorders can
cause mild neutropenia, as well as anemia
and thrombocytopenia. If severe, splenec-
tomy may be necessary.
Deﬁciencies of folate and B12 are rare in
children; the presence of hypersegmented
neutrophils caused by impaired neutrophil
nuclear maturation is a clue to this condition.
Similarly, copper deﬁciency is a rare cause of
neutropenia often secondary to an underlying
malabsorptive process or due to zinc excess.
These patients usually present with concom-
itant anemia and thrombocytopenia.
A number of inherited conditions have
neutropenia as one of their characteristic
features. The more common of these con-
ditions are presented in Table 11.2.
Children with severe congenital neutro-
penia (SCN) often present in early infancy
with umbilical infection, skin infections, oral
ulcers, pneumonia, or perineal infections.
There are two forms: an autosomal recessive
form(Kostmannsyndrome)involvingmuta-
tions in the HAX1 gene that is involved in
signal transduction and an autosomal dom-
inant form involving mutations in the neu-
trophil elastase gene (ELA2) or, more rarely,
in the GFI1 gene that targets ELA2. Bone
marrow aspiration reveals a maturational
arrest at the promyelocyte stage. In addition
to the risk of death due to overwhelming
infection, patients with either of these con-
ditions have an increased risk of developing
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML).
Cyclic neutropenia is characterized by
approximately 21-day cycles of changing
neutrophil counts, with frank neutropenia
developing at regular intervals and lasting 3
to 6 days. Fever and oral ulcerations usually
are seen during the nadir, as well as gingi-
vitis, pharyngitis, and skin infections. Diag-
nosis is often delayed because the neutrophil
count may have improved by the time
the patient seeks medical attention. These
patients also demonstrate mutations in the
ELA2 gene, but at different locations than in
those with SCN. They do not have the same
risk of developing MDS or AML. Diagnosis
is made by obtaining serial complete blood
counts (CBCs) 2 to 3 times/week over 4 to
6 weeks to demonstrate the periodicity of

the cycle. Granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF) has been used in patients
who develop recurrent infections during
their nadir.
Shwachman–Diamond syndrome in-
cludes exocrine pancreatic insufﬁciency,
short stature, metaphyseal dysplasia, and
bone marrow failure with typically mild-to-
moderate neutropenia. Affected patients
also have an increased risk of MDS and
AML. Intestinal malabsorption with failure
to thrive commonly occurs, especially in
infancy and early childhood.
Benign familial neutropenia is charac-
terized by moderate neutropenia with min-
imal risk of invasive bacterial infections. It
has been postulated that the underlying
cause is a defect in neutrophil mobilization
from the bone marrow, but the etiology is as
yet unknown. It occurs more commonly in
individuals of African, Arabic, and Yeme-
nite Jewish descent. Periodontal disease is
the most frequent complication.
Fanconi anemia is characterized by a
defect in DNA repair leading to extensive
chromosomal breakage. Affected patients
have mutations within the FANC family of
genes, including FANC A, C, and G. It pre-
sents most commonly during the early school
age years; patients with the characteristic
physical ﬁndings may be diagnosed sooner.
Thrombocytopenia is often the presenting
hematologic abnormality, with anemia and
neutropenia developing later. Up to 10% of
patients ultimately develop MDS or AML.
Bone marrow transplantation is curative, but
challenging to complete successfully given
the underlying chromosomal fragility.
Dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) is char-
acterized clinically by the triad of abnormal
nails, reticular skin pigmentation, and oral
leukoplakia. Bone marrow failure occurs
during early adulthood and is associated with
a high risk of developing aplastic anemia,
MDS, leukemia, and solid tumors. Patients
have very short germ line telomeres, and
approximately half have mutations in one
of six genes encoding proteins that maintain
telomere function. Affected patients rarely
present with hematologic abnormalities dur-
ing childhood.
Diamond–Blackfan anemia is a congen-
ital anemia that presents in infancy. There
is typically a failure of erythropoiesis with
preservation
of
myeloid
and
platelet
production. Only 20% to 25% of cases are
inherited; the rest are sporadic. Approxi-
mately 50% of affected persons have devel-
opmental abnormalities including growth
retardation and craniofacial, upper limb/
hand, cardiac, and genitourinary malforma-
tions. Neutropenia is seen in 25% to 40%
of affected children. Patients also have an
increased risk of MDS, AML, and osteogenic
sarcoma. Genetic studies have identiﬁed
heterozygous mutations in at least one of
eight ribosomal protein genes in up to 50%
of cases. Mutations in ribosomal protein L5
(RPL5) are associated with multiple physi-
cal abnormalities including cleft lip/palate,
thumb, and heart anomalies. The diagnosis
is often difﬁcult due to incomplete pheno-
types and a wide variability of clinical
expression. Up to 80% of patients respond
to a course of steroids with improvement in
their cytopenias.
The etiology of neutropenia in glycogen
storage disease 1b is not deﬁnitively known,
but appears to be related to increased
neutrophil apoptosis caused by an excess
of reactive oxygen species due to a defect in
neutrophil energy metabolism.
Almost one-third of patients with selec-
tive
IgA
deﬁciency
have
evidence
of
autoimmune disease; neutropenia in this
condition is felt most likely related to the
presence of antineutrophil antibodies.
Patients with a mild form of Wiskott–
Aldrich
syndrome
(WAS)
known
as
X-linked neutropenia have a unique “gain
98
Chapter 11

of function” mutation in the GTPase-binding
domain of the WAS protein (WASp) that
leads to increased actin polymerization in
neutrophils, causing defective mitosis and cell
movement and ultimately severe neutropenia.
Initial evaluation of the child with
neutropenia
Evaluation of the child with neutropenia
begins with a thorough history and physical
examination. It is critical to know whether
the child has had recent or recurrent bac-
terial infections, and whether there is a
family history of neutropenia or recurrent
bacterial infections. On examination, atten-
tion should be paid to any phenotypic
abnormalities, adenopathy, splenomegaly,
evidence of a chronic or underlying disease,
and meticulous evaluation of the skin and
mucous membranes (particularly in the oral
and perirectal areas). A CBC must be done
to determine if the patient has isolated
neutropenia or neutropenia associated with
anemia
and/or
thrombocytopenia.
The
approach to a child with bi- or trilineage
abnormalities is different than that in a child
with isolated neutropenia; multiple abnor-
mal lineages increase the likelihood of a
more generalized marrow failure state such
as aplastic anemia or a marrow inﬁltrative
process such as leukemia. It is valuable to
repeat the CBC at least once, especially if the
child appears well, to avoid proceeding with
a major evaluation due to a laboratory error.
Well-appearing children with mild-to-
moderate neutropenia can typically be
observed over the next 2 to 3 weeks with
serial CBCs. Children with persistent or
worsening neutropenia require further eval-
uation. Patients with recurrent neutropenia
should have blood counts checked 2 to 3
times per week for 6 weeks to evaluate
for cyclic neutropenia. Additional studies
include antineutrophil antibodies, assess-
ment of cellular and serum immune status,
and careful review of the peripheral smear
for morphologic abnormalities of the white
cells. If severe congenital neutropenia or
Kostmann syndrome is suspected, assess-
ment for ELA2
and HAX1 mutations
should be made. A bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy may be necessary to identify
granulocyte precursors and to search for
defects in myeloid maturation. In addition,
the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy can be
used to exclude hematologic malignancies,
marrow inﬁltration, or ﬁbrosis.
Management of the child with
neutropenia and fever
Childrenidentiﬁedwithneutropeniabutwho
are free of fever or other signs of infection
should be evaluated as outlined above, but
require no other therapy at that time. Man-
aging the child with neutropenia and fever is
more complex and depends on many factors
including the nature of the neutropenia
(acute or chronic), its severity, and the asso-
ciation with immune defects, underlying
illnesses, or malignancies. Patients with
acquired neutropenia arising from malig-
nancy or chemotherapeutic drugs have a
diminishedinﬂammatorycapabilityandhave
a greater susceptibility to sepsis. Fever may be
the earliest and only warning sign. Sepsis
related to chemotherapy-induced neutrope-
nia remains a leading cause of mortality in
these patients. Aggressive management of the
febrile, neutropenic cancer patient in the
hospital has markedly reduced morbidity and
mortality due to infection. For management
of oncology patients with fever and neutro-
penia, see Chapter 27.
The management of the febrile child who
is discovered to be neutropenic depends on
several factors. Patients with fever and mild
The Neutropenic Child

or moderate neutropenia and signs and
symptoms suggestive of a viral illness that
otherwise look well may be managed sup-
portively without antibiotics, although in
most cases they will receive a long-acting
cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone prior to
discharge from the clinic or emergency
department.
Their
parents
should
be
instructed to bring them back in 24 hours
for further evaluation, or sooner if they
develop additional symptoms or begin to
appear unwell. If they become afebrile, their
neutropenia should be evaluated as outlined
above. Patients with fever and mild or mod-
erate neutropenia who have evidence of
localized bacterial disease (otitis media,
sinusitis, or local skin infections) may be
treated with appropriate oral antibiotics in
the outpatient setting. Patients with mild
neutropenia and evidence of bacterial pneu-
monia, GU tract infections, lymphadenitis,
or systemic symptoms should have cultures
of the infection site and of the blood. They
may be treated with appropriate oral anti-
biotics if their appearance is not concerning,
but should be seen back for reevaluation
within 24 hours. Similar patients with mod-
erate neutropenia can also be treated in the
outpatient setting if they appear totally well.
Febrile patients with moderate or severe
neutropenia who appear in any way unwell
require emergent medical assessment and
initiation of therapy, as do children who
are known to have severe forms of neutro-
penia such as severe congenital neutrope-
nia or Kostmann syndrome. These children
require:
* Hospital admission.
* Coverage with broad-spectrum antibio-
tics due to their increased risk of mortality
due to sepsis. These should provide cover-
age for Gram-negative and Gram-positive
organisms. A combination of an aminogly-
coside and a b-lactam antibiotic provides
initial broad coverage and is synergistic for
Pseudomonas species, but several different
antibiotic
choices
are
appropriate
and
depend on local practice.
* Careful
physical
evaluation,
paying
meticulous attention to potential sites of
occult infection (e.g., the oral cavity and
perineum).
* Laboratory studies: CBC with differential,
blood cultures, urinalysis and urine culture,
and cultures from sites of suspected infec-
tion such as the skin, throat, and stool.
* Chest
radiograph
if
any
pulmonary
symptoms are present.
* Daily blood cultures and a CBC with
differential every 24 hours in the persistently
febrile patient to help determine further
management.
* CT scan of the chest (þ / sinuses, abdo-
men, and pelvis) looking for evidence of
occult infection in any patient remaining
febrile for >96 hours without a speciﬁc
cause being identiﬁed. They should be
started on empiric antifungal coverage due
to the increased risk of invasive fungal
infection in this patient population.
Prophylactic antibiotics have been used in
the past in an attempt to decrease the fre-
quency of serious infections in patients with
severe neutropenia. However, this has gen-
erally fallen out of favor. Exceptions include
the use of prophylactic penicillin or amox-
icillin in patients following splenectomy and
the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis jiroveci
(previously known as Pneumocystis carinii)
pneumonia in patients with T-cell dysfunc-
tion in addition to neutropenia.
The use of cytokines, particularly G-CSF,
has become increasingly popular in the
management of symptomatic neutropenia.
It is particularly useful in patients with
symptomatic cyclic neutropenia or in the
neutropenia-accompanying disorders such
as glycogen storage disease 1b, as these
patients typically respond well to low dose
therapy (1 to 2 mcg/kg/dose) on a daily or
100
Chapter 11

alternate day schedule with a goal of main-
taining an ANC between 1.0 and 1.5 
109/L. It is also used frequently in patients
with severe chronic neutropenia. However,
the doses required to raise the ANC into the
desired range vary signiﬁcantly between
patients. A typical starting dose is 3 to
5mcg/kg/day, and the dose is increased
slowly until the desired ANC is achieved.
Patients with severe neutropenia who fail
to respond to doses as high as 50 to
100 mcg/kg/day are considered poor respon-
ders. These patients are candidates for bone
marrow transplantation given their high like-
lihood of mortality due to infection as well as
an up to 30% chance of developing myeloid
malignancy.
Case study for review
A 7-week-old girl presents to your clinic for
evaluation of a fever to 38.6 C. She had
been seen 4 weeks earlier for a well child visit
and was noted to have a small ulcer on her
vulva. This was treated with oral antibiotics
and resolved. Her parents report that the
vulvar lesion had recurred 24 hours before
she developed the fever. She had no blood
work performed at the previous visit. Her
physical examination reveals her to be alert
and nontoxic appearing. A 6-mm shallow
ulceration is present on her vulva with
minimal surrounding erythema, drainage,
or induration. It is mildly tender, however.
Her physical
examination
is
otherwise
normal.
1. What additional information would you
like?
Thepatientwasbornattermviaspontaneous
vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated preg-
nancy. Her weight, height, and head circum-
ference were appropriate for gestational age.
Her nursery course was unremarkable, and
she was discharged from the nursery at
24 hours of life. She is an only child. There
is no family history of recurrent fevers, or
severe or unusual infections. Her parents are
unaware of any “blood problems” in other
family members.
2. What additional studies would you like
to obtain?
Given her age and degree of fever, a sepsis
workup is indicated. A CBC reveals a
WBC count of 12.4  109/L, a hemoglobin
of 11.7 g/dL, and a platelet count of
423  109/L. The differential reveals 0%
neutrophils, 73% lymphocytes, and 27%
monocytes. A urinalysis is normal. Because
of her severe neutropenia she is admitted to
the hospital and started on broad-spectrum
antibiotics. A blood culture is performed
and is negative. The vulvar lesion is cultured
and grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The
lesion resolves with intravenous antibiotics.
A bone marrow aspiration is performed
and reveals an adequately cellular specimen
with normal megakaryocytes and erythroid
precursors. The myeloid lineage shows a
maturational arrest at the myelocyte stage,
however.
3. What are you thinking now? What would
you do next?
The isolated neutropenia in the face of a
normal hemoglobin and platelet count
makes congenital aplastic anemia unlikely.
The young age at presentation, the signiﬁ-
cant degree of neutropenia, and the unusual
organism identiﬁed raise concern that this
child may have a severe form of congenital
neutropenia. Once her active infection has
resolved and she is afebrile she can be dis-
charged from the hospital, but should have
regular follow-up to determine what her
neutrophil count does over time. More
importantly, her parents need to understand
The Neutropenic Child
101

the importance of bringing her immediately
to you or to the emergency room if she
develops another fever.
Twice weekly CBCs are performed over
the next 6 weeks and reveal a consistent
pattern of severe neutropenia, with ANCs
ranging from 0 to 170. Serum immunoglo-
bulins are measured and are normal, as are
T-cell subset studies. Over that time period,
she has several episodes of oral mucosal
ulcers.
4. What would be your next step?
The persistent, noncyclic nature of her neu-
tropenia provides further evidence that this
infant is suffering from a form of severe
congenital neutropenia. Given the lack of a
family history, the autosomal recessive form
(Kostmann syndrome) would be more likely,
although she may have a new ELA2 muta-
tion. Genetic testing for HAX1 and ELA2
mutations can be sent for conﬁrmation.
A trial of G-CSF can also be initiated to see
if it will result in an increase in the ANC.

Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia, or low platelets, can
occur as an isolated ﬁnding or in conjunc-
tion with a multitude of underlying clinical
conditions. Normal platelet counts range
from 150 to 400  109/L and thrombocyto-
penia is generally deﬁned as a platelet count
of less than 100  109/L. Thrombocytopenia
may further be deﬁned as mild (50 to
100  109/L), moderate (20 to 50  109/L),
and severe (<20  109/L). Other sources
deﬁne
thrombocytopenia
as
a
platelet
count of <150  109/L or in patients with
a drop of >50% from their baseline platelet
counts (if known). Thrombocytopenia is
typically subdivided into immune
and
nonimmune causes. Immune causes gener-
ally cause increased platelet destruction.
Nonimmune causes may cause increased
destruction or decreased bone marrow
production. In patients with splenomegaly,
platelet sequestration may also lead to
thrombocytopenia.
Acute immune thrombocytope-
nic purpura
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP;
also referred to as immune thrombocyto-
penia or idiopathic thrombocytopenic pur-
pura) is an acquired, isolated disorder in
which the patient typically presents with a
low platelet count and symptoms of muco-
cutaneous bleeding. Most cases are consid-
ered idiopathic whereas others are second-
ary to coexisting conditions. The diagnosis
of ITP is one of exclusion (see Table 12.1,
Figures 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3).
The most common cause of destructive
thrombocytopenia is autoimmunity. Short-
ened platelet survival is due to platelet auto-
antibody production (usually IgG), often
stimulated by infection or drug exposure.
IgM antibodies and complement activation
are less frequently found but can also be seen
in childhood ITP. It is an acute, self-limited
disease of isolated thrombocytopenia that
usually occurs in children aged 2 to 5 years
(though may occur at any age from infancy
to adolescence), typically resolving in more
than 80% of children within 6 weeks to 6
months. When ITP occurs in the child over
10 years of age, especially females, the course
may be chronic and associated with an
autoimmune
disorder.
The
otherwise
healthy child presents with sudden onset
of severe thrombocytopenia (usually < 20 
109/L),
manifested
by
petechiae
and
purpura and less frequently mucosal bleed-
ing such as epistaxis, menorrhagia, hema-
turia, and hematochezia. There is a history
of an antecedent viral illness within the past
1 to 3 weeks in up to 60% to 70% of
children. It may also follow vaccination with

Severe bleeding such as protracted epistaxis,
hemoptysis, or gastrointestinal bleeding
leading to severe anemia and need for trans-
fusion is rare. Intracranial hemorrhage
(ICH) is the most feared complication with
an estimated incidence of 0.1% to 0.5%;
more than 50% of patients with ICH present
with this ﬁnding at diagnosis or within
1 week of diagnosis. More than 75% of
patients with ITP and ICH survive. It has
yet to be deﬁned what risk factors predis-
pose children with ITP to sustain this rare
but extremely serious complication.
Evaluation
The initial evaluation of the child with
suspected ITP begins with a complete his-
tory and physical examination. Other than a
possible antecedent illness and the acute
onset of minor bleeding and bruising, the
child should be otherwise clinically well
appearing. More signiﬁcant bleeding may
be associated with trauma. Bleeding into
joints (hemarthroses) should lead one to
consider an alternative bleeding disorder
(e.g., congenital or acquired factor deﬁ-
ciency such as hemophilia). There should
be no history of unexplained fevers, bone
pain, or weight loss which would be con-
cerning for an underlying malignancy or
chronic infection. A medication history is
critical as many drugs have been implicated
in inducing drug-mediated immune throm-
bocytopenia. Implicated drugs include hep-
arin, aspirin, aspirin-containing cold med-
ications,
nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), and seizure medications
such as valproic acid. Chronic infections
with HIV, CMV, and hepatitis C may cause
a low platelet count and appropriate screen-
ing should be done. Helicobacter pylori has
been implicated in adults with ITP and there
are some reports of this association in chil-
dren as well. Family history should include
an assessment for autoimmune diseases,

immune deﬁciency, or congenital syndromes

for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly,
short stature, dysmorphic features, or the

(e.g.,

The laboratory features of ITP include
a low platelet count in the face of an
otherwise normal complete blood count
(CBC). However, the hemoglobin, white

cell
count,
and/or
absolute
neutrophil count may be altered due to
a recent infection, and the hemoglobin
may be low due to bleeding. Coagulation
screening tests including PT, PTT, and
ﬁbrinogen and the complete metabolic
panel should be normal. Therefore, no
studies other than a CBC truly need to
be done if the diagnosis of ITP is strongly
suspected. The platelet count should be
conﬁrmed to be low on a second evalua-
tion if the physical ﬁndings do not corre-
late with the laboratory value.

If two cytopenias are present with any
ﬁndings on the history or physical suggestive
of another diagnosis, consideration should
be given to performing a bone marrow aspi-
ration (BMA). However, a bone marrow
evaluation is rarely necessary to conﬁrm
the diagnosis. BMA in ITP typically demon-

individuals with suspected ITP only if ster-
oids are to be part of the treatment plan due
to the small chance the thrombocytopenia
may be an early manifestation of leukemia.
However, even this practice is controversial.

Additional laboratory evaluations may
be required for speciﬁc clinical indications
(e.g., screening for autoimmune or thyroid
disease, viral testing for HIV, hepatitis C,
CMV, or parvovirus B19; direct antiglobu-
lin testing [DAT; Coombs] and reticulocyte
count if concern for autoimmune hemolytic
anemia; and immunoglobulin levels and T/
B cell numbers if concern for underlying
immunodeﬁciency syndrome). Antiplatelet
antibody tests are not sensitive or speciﬁc
and not required for diagnosis or for routine
clinical management.
Review of the peripheral blood smear
conﬁrms a low platelet count, and the few
remaining platelets typically are large. If
platelet size is determined by an automated
cell counter (Coulter), it is usually elevated,
consistent with young platelet age (due to
early marrow release associated with rapid
peripheral platelet destruction). Oftentimes
the platelet count is underestimated as very
large immature platelets (megakaryocytic
fragments) are not counted by the Coulter.
This may in part explain the relative lack of
bleeding symptoms in children with very

low platelet counts. The erythrocyte and
leukocyte counts and morphology should
be normal and there should be no evidence
of hemolysis or microangiopathic disease
(e.g., schistocytes and/or burr cells).
False values for platelet counts can result
from aggregation of platelets in the syringe
or collection tube, counting of small non-
platelet particles (fragmented red or white
cells) by automated cell counters, and pseu-
dothrombocytopenia due to in vitro platelet
agglutination by anticoagulant-dependent
ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid
(EDTA)
antibodies. Review of the blood ﬁlm should
assess for clumps of agglutinated platelets at
the periphery of the slide.
Treatment
The natural history of acute ITP is com-
plete resolution in the majority of children.
Despite the relatively benign course experi-
enced by most children with ITP, the sud-
den onset, concern for a possible serious
condition such as leukemia or aplastic ane-
mia, and concern for life-threatening bleed-
ing often guide the initial treatment decision
making. Parents often bring their child to
see the primary care or emergency physi-
cian, many of whom are not accustomed to
encountering such severe thrombocytope-
nia. Risk factors for the rare life-threatening
hemorrhage have yet to be elucidated and
dogma hasbeentotreatthepatientaccording
to platelet count rather than being guided by
the degree of clinical symptoms. This clinical
scenario has led to signiﬁcant controversy
as to whether intervention is warranted,
when it is warranted, and with what treat-
ment.Contemporarytherapieshavenotbeen
shown to alter the course or outcome of
children with acute ITP. As such, the concept
of nontreatment in ITP is increasingly
becoming the standard of care in most pedi-
atric hematology/oncology centers.
All patients and families should be coun-
seled regarding rough play, contact sports,
and general anticipatory guidance such as
the use of protective gear (helmets) and seat
belts. Intramuscular injections should be
withheld until platelet counts increase. Spe-
ciﬁc medications that interfere with platelet
function (such as NSAIDs, SSRIs [selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors], anticonvul-
sants, and aspirin) should not be given.
The use of a bleeding score as the frame-
work for a consistent treatment strategy is
gaining in popularity and several scoring
systems
have
been
published
to
date.
Patients are categorized by the presence of
clinical signs and symptoms of bleeding;
more than 80% present with mild clinical
bleeding (manifested by bruising, petechiae,
mild epistaxis, and no anemia). Moderate
clinical bleeding is characterized by more
signiﬁcant mucosal bleeding such as more
severe epistaxis or menorrhagia and severe
bleeding (usually < 5% of patients) is
marked by unusual or severe bleeding
requiring hospitalization for control and/
or blood transfusion support with symp-
toms seriously interfering with quality of
life. All patients may present with very low
platelet counts (e.g., 1 to 20  109/L) though
those with severe symptoms tend to have
initial platelet counts < 10  109/L.
Utilizing
the
bleeding
score,
many
patients with clinically mild or moderate
bleeding can be effectively managed with
observation.
The
anxiety
of
patients,
families, and other caregivers can often be
alleviated with education on the pathophys-
iology and natural history of ITP in addition
to general preventive measures and periodic
clinical and laboratory assessments. Platelet
counts do not need to be checked more
often than every 1 to 2 weeks (or even less
often in the clinically stable child). Disrup-
tion of school or work is not necessary,
though participation in contact sports or
other situations that could lead to head or
abdominal injury should be avoided until
the platelet count is known to have returned
Thrombocytopenia
109

to a safe levels (typically >50  109/L). With
observation, the majority of patients with
ITP will have resolution of symptoms and
the underlying thrombocytopenia while
avoiding unnecessary costs and side effects
of medications and hospitalization.
Pharmacological
treatments
to
raise
the platelet count in children with moder-
ate-to-severe bleeding include two ﬁrst-line
therapies: intravenous immune globulin
(IVIG) and RhoGAM (anti-Rh [anti-D]
immune globulin, also Rhophylac). IVIG
is thought to function by saturating the
Fc receptors on the reticuloendothelial cells
in the spleen and liver, thereby decreasing
the clearance of opsonized platelets. These
treatments typically provide a quick yet
transient increase in the platelet count, often
sustained 2 to 4 weeks. More than 80% of
patients respond with an increase in the
platelet count, which is sufﬁcient to decrease
or eliminate bleeding symptoms. Patients
and families should be counseled as to the
transitory effect of IVIG treatment due to
the
misconception
that
a
subsequent
decrease in platelet count is indicative of
increased disease severity. The dose of IVIG
is 0.8 to 1 g/kg over 4 to 6 hours. If neces-
sary, IVIG may be repeated two to three
times for a total dose of 2 to 3 g/kg; doses
should be given at least 24 hours apart to
allow sufﬁcient time to determine response.
A rise in the platelet count is usually seen
within 24 to 72 hours and peaks at approx-
imately 9 days. A good initial response is an
increase in platelet count by 20 to 50  109/L.
Side effects of IVIG are usually immediate,
relate to the rate of infusion, and include
nausea, lightheadedness, and headache. At
times, onset of a severe headache can
prompt an emergent head CT to assess for
potential intracranial hemorrhage. These
symptoms can be alleviated by slowing the
rate of infusion and premedicating with
diphenhydramine
if
further
doses
are
needed.
Fever
may
also
occur,
and
premedication
with
acetaminophen
is
advisable. Rare side effects include anaphy-
laxis in an IgA-deﬁcient patient, aseptic
meningitis, acute renal failure, pulmonary
insufﬁciency, and thrombosis. Although
IVIG is a pooled blood product, it is thought
to be safe with regard to viral transmission
and does not require consent as with blood
product administration. Subsequent dosing
with IVIG may be indicated depending on
clinical symptomatology and continued
thrombocytopenia.
RhoGAM is a less-expensive alternative
therapy to IVIG. The dose is 75 mg/kg IV
over 20 to 30 minutes. Response rate and
time to onset are similar to IVIG. Anti-D
works by binding the RhD antigen expressed
on the surface of red blood cells, leading to
their recognition by Fc receptors on cells of
the reticuloendothelial system. The coated
red cells are thought to compete with the
antiplatelet–antibody coated platelets for the
activated Fc receptor sites, thereby slowing
platelet clearance. Side effects include fever
and chills, intravascular hemolysis, head-
ache, emesis, and rarely anaphylaxis. Preme-
dication with acetaminophen and diphen-
hydramine may prevent these adverse effects
with subsequent infusions. A response is
typically seen within 24 to 48 hours. Patients
must be Rh positive, have a functional spleen
(at least not known to be splenectomized
or asplenic), and not be anemic (i.e., > 2 to
4 g/dL below expected hemoglobin for age).
RhoGAM does cause transient hemolysis
and a decrease in hemoglobin of 1 to
2 g/dL over the ensuing 3 to 4 days should
be expected. The hemoglobin should subse-
quently recover within 10 days. Though rare,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
currently mandates that patients be moni-
tored for 8 hours with serial urinalysis after
administration of anti-D due to cases of
severe, life-threatening hemolysis.
Amicar (e-aminocaproic acid) may be
utilized
in
patients
with
prolonged
110
Chapter 12

thrombocytopenia and persistent mucosal
bleeding without anemia (mild bleeding).
Reports of efﬁcacy with minimal side effects
make low-dose therapy a good option
(10 mg/kg/dose every 6 to 8 hours). Another
option is low-dose prednisone which may
beneﬁt the patient with a long course of ITP
who secondarily develops alteration in vas-
cular integrity. Low-dose steroids would not
be expected to raise the platelet count; how-
ever, they would have minimal side effects.
Corticosteroids may be used in the ini-
tial medical management of ITP, though
typically are considered a second-line ther-
apy in pediatrics. Response is slower than
with IVIG or RhoGAM and is usually within
3 to 4 days. The ﬁrst steroid prescribed is
prednisone, 1 to 2 mg/kg/day for 2 to
4 weeks, tapering the dose post-platelet
response (i.e., >100  109/L) over several
weeks. The initial response rate is 70% to
90%. An immune rebound may occur with a
taper that is too rapid and patients will often
require prolonged steroid therapy to main-
tain the desired platelet count. There are
several mechanisms by which steroids affect
the platelet count: inhibition of phagocyto-
sis of the antibody-coated platelets leading
to prolonged platelet survival; inhibition of
antibody production by B-lymphocytes;
improvement of capillary integrity reducing
clinical bleeding; and an increase in platelet
production. Many patients respond to this
treatment, although side effects may occur
with repeated treatment or chronic use such
as gastritis, ﬂuid retention, weight gain,
mood lability, acne, striae, high blood pres-
sure, and elevated serum glucose. An alter-
native to oral steroids is high-dose pulse
infusion of intravenous methylpredniso-
lone. Some patients become thrombo-
cytopenic again after therapy and require
retreatment. A relapse may be managed
safely by observation and restriction of
activity and medications, or with inter-
mittent
IVIG
and/or
pulse
steroids.
Dexamethasone has also been used with
efﬁcacy in refractory patients.
Emergency therapy
Patients with known or suspected life-
threatening hemorrhage such as central
nervous system hemorrhage from ITP (usu-
ally with concomitant platelet count < 10
 109/L) should be treated emergently with
combination therapy including IVIG 1 g/kg
daily for 2 to 3 days and intravenous high-
dose methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day (up
to 1 g/day) for 1 to 3 days. Active life-
threatening hemorrhage with refractory
thrombocytopenia is one of the only current
indications for emergency splenectomy.
Continuous infusion of platelets should be
considered in an emergent situation and
during surgery or childbirth in a severely
thrombocytopenic patient, in conjunction
with other therapies. Off-label recombinant
factor VIIa (rFVIIa) may also be considered.
Chronic immune thrombocytope-
nic purpura
Acute and chronic ITP are deﬁned based on
disease duration, with chronic ITP deﬁned
as persisting for > 6 months. Approximately
10% to 20% of children with acute ITP that
persists will go on to have chronic ITP. The
child with chronic ITP is still likely to have
complete resolution within 6 months to
2 years or may have an associated auto-
immune disease or underlying immunod-
eﬁciency state. Some practitioners deﬁne
chronic ITP as that lasting beyond a 1 year
period. Most patients with chronic ITP do
not need treatment as the platelet count is
often above 20  109/L and bleeding is min-
imal. Platelet count alone does not correlate
with the risk of hemorrhage as platelets are
large due to a healthy marrow response to
peripheral thrombocytopenia and, as a con-
sequence, have greater than normal procoa-
gulant activity. In the rare patient with
chronic, refractory ITP who has clinical
Thrombocytopenia
111

hemorrhage or cannot tolerate the living
restrictions imposed by the thrombocytope-
nia, intervention with medical or surgical
therapies should be considered.
ITP may be the initial manifestation of
aplastic anemia including Fanconi anemia
before progression to pancytopenia, Evans
syndrome (association of ITP with autoim-
mune hemolytic anemia), systemic lupus
erythematosis (SLE), or autoimmune lym-
phoproliferative syndrome. HIV infection
should be considered in all patients with
isolated thrombocytopenia as this is fre-
quently the ﬁrst manifestation of disease
in children. ITP may also be present in
children years before the diagnosis of
immunodeﬁciency (i.e., common variable
immunodeﬁciency) is evident.
Therapies utilized in the treatment of
acute ITP may be utilized for chronic ITP,
though continued administration, cost, and
side effects frequently limit their use. Other
considerations include additional medical
and surgical approaches.
Rituximab is a chimeric human–mouse
monoclonal antibody directed against the
transmembrane CD20 antigen present on B
cells, leading to apoptosis and antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Children
with chronic ITP may have a 30% to 50%
response rate with rituximab. The standard
dosage is 375 mg/m2 IV weekly infusion
(over 4 to 6 hours) for 4 weeks. Most
patients start to show a response by the
second week, though delayed responses sev-
eral weeks later may occur. Responses may
be short-lived or last for years. Acute tox-
icity is minimal though patients may expe-
rience fever and chills (often abates with
subsequent
infusions),
serum
sickness,
headache, nausea, emesis, and mucocutane-
ous reactions (continuum from hives and
dermatitis to rarely reported Stevens-John-
son syndrome and toxic epidermal necro-
lysis). B-cell depletion lasts for approxi-
mately
6
months
with
a
signiﬁcant
decrement in humoral response, although
decreased total IgG immunoglobulin levels
and increased infections have not been fre-
quently reported. For the treatment of ITP
without an underlying immunodeﬁciency,
it remains unclear if increased infection is a
risk in pediatric patients after rituximab.
Although considered a T-cell-dependent
infection, B-cell depletion may lead to an
increased risk of PCP (Pneumocystis jiroveci
pneumonia) and cotrixomazole prophylaxis
should be considered. Hepatitis B reactiva-
tion and progressive multifocal leukoence-
phalopathy secondary to JC virus are rare
considerations in this population.
Splenectomy may be considered for
patients with chronic ITP with bleeding
and/or limitation in activities negatively
impacting quality of life. Splenectomy is suc-
cessful in 60% to 85% of patients; however,
relapse of ITP may occur due to immune-
mediated platelet destructioninother organs,
especially the liver. Patients should ideally
receive appropriate immunization several
weeks prior to surgery due to the risk of
infection
with
encapsulated
organisms
(pneumococcus, haemophilus inﬂuenza, or
meningococcus). Lifelong penicillin prophy-
laxis is recommended postsplenectomy.
Vinca alkaloids (vincristine and vinblas-
tine), danazol (a virilizing androgen), and
immunosuppressive agents such as azathio-
prine and cyclophosphamide have also been
used with some success. Ascorbic acid, cyclo-
sporine, and interferon a-2b are other agents
that have also been investigated for use in
chronic ITP. Long-term management of
chronic ITP includes periodic assessments
for development of other manifestations of
immunodeﬁciency or autoimmune disease,
counseling regarding activities and medica-
tions, and periodic assessments of the platelet
count toassess for continuation orresolution
of the underlying process.
The thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics
are currently under investigation for the
112
Chapter 12

treatment of childhood chronic ITP, follow-
ing successful clinical trials in adults. As ITP
is likely the result of impaired production in
addition to peripheral immune-mediated
destruction, these drugs may have some role
in treatment to stimulate increased produc-
tion, even in patients with normal throm-
bopoietin levels. Drugs currently under
investigation are romiplostim (Nplate)
and eltrombopag (Promacta). Concerning
toxicities include marrow reticulin ﬁbrosis
and thromboembolism. It is likely that
these drugs or subsequent generations will
provide potential new therapeutic options
in the future.
Neonatal alloimmune
thrombocytopenia
Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia
(NAIT) is caused by the transplacental pas-
sage of maternal alloantibodies directed
against fetal platelets, similar in pathophys-
iology to hemolytic disease of the newborn.
Unlike hemolytic disease of the newborn,
NAIT often affects the ﬁrst-born offspring.
Although rare, NAIT is the most common
cause of severe thrombocytopenia in the
ﬁrst few days of life. Alloantibodies are
secondary to human leukocyte antigen
incompatibility as fetal platelet antigens are
inherited from the father. Immunization in
the mother against fetal platelet antigens can
occur during the current or a previous
pregnancy or secondary to a previous plate-
let transfusion and may lead to severe
thrombocytopenia in the fetal-newborn
period, with a high risk of fatal hemorrhage.
Thrombocytopenia leading to fetal loss and
hemorrhage has been reported as early as 16
to 24 weeks of gestation. Although several
platelet antigens have been implicated, the
large majority of cases can be related to
human
platelet
antigen
1a
(HPA-1a)
incompatibility (HPA-1a-negative mother
with an HPA-1a-positive fetus). HPA-1a
resides on the GP IIb/IIIa complex that is
responsible for ﬁbrinogen receptor activity
and thus important in aggregation and
platelet-plug formation. Therefore, devel-
opment of anti-HPA-1a antibodies may
interfere with normal platelet aggregation
in addition to decreasing platelet number,
resulting in a qualitative platelet defect as
well as in addition to a quantitative one.
This may in part explain the high incidence
of serious bleeding in these infants as com-
pared with those born to mothers with ITP
with alloantibodies directed against alter-
nate antigens. HPA-1a is common in the
Caucasian population in addition to HPA-
5b. HPA-4 incompatibility is more common
in Asian populations.
The infant with NAIT typically presents
with moderate-to-severe thrombocytopenia
(<20 to 50  109/L) and may rapidly
develop petechiae, purpura, and bleeding.
ICH is common, occurring in 10% to 20%
of neonates and may occur prenatally or
antenatally.
Therefore,
head
ultrasound
should always be part of the initial diagnos-
tic workup. Complications of early central
nervous system hemorrhage include hydro-
cephalus, porencephaly, seizures, and fetal
loss. Early jaundice occurs in 20% of cases
owing to resolution of intracranial or
intraorgan hemorrhage. The infant should
otherwise be generally healthy without other
perinatal complications and the mother
should have an unremarkable hematologic
history. For a mother with a previous low
platelet count, the differential diagnosis
should include maternal idiopathic, auto-
immune, and drug-dependent thrombocy-
topenias,
infection,
and
preeclampsia.
Infants may also be thrombocytopenic
secondary to birth asphyxia, infection,
congenital bone marrow hypoplasia, or
from prematurity. The presence of hepatos-
plenomegaly, intrauterine growth retarda-
tion, and/or intracranial calciﬁcations with
Thrombocytopenia
113

thrombocytopenia should suggest a congen-
ital viral infection. However, if a secondary
diagnosis is not clearly delineated, it is
important to exclude alloimmune throm-
bocytopenia by appropriate immunologic
testing as future-affected pregnancies tend
to be more severe and require close ante-
natal monitoring.
Early platelet alloantigen evaluation of
the newborn and parents is important, both
in offering the affected infant appropriate
treatment and in order to minimize the risk
of devastating complications with future
pregnancies. Evaluation includes platelet
typing on the mother and father, speciﬁcally
looking for antigens responsible for alloim-
munization such as HPA-1a. Serum from
the mother and infant is screened for anti-
platelet antibodies against either the infant’s
or the father’s platelets. We send blood for
the NAIT workup to the Blood Center of
Wisconsin.
Several treatment options are available
for the infant with neonatal alloimmuniza-
tion. Transfusion with antigen-negative pla-
telets has been the mainstay of treatment,
when available. Since HPA-1a-negative pla-
telets are present in only 2% of the Cauca-
sian population, the most available source
of platelets is from the mother. Random
platelet transfusions (10 to 20 mL/kg) may
provide a transient increase, lasting 1 to 2
days, and should be used in cases of serious
hemorrhage, while antigen-negative plate-
lets are being obtained and prepared. If
random donor platelets are ineffective, then
cross-matched donor platelets or washed
maternal platelets may be used if available.
An excellent alternative treatment is IVIG.
The recommended dose is 1 g/kg/24 hours
for 1 to 2 doses (until the platelet count is
50  109/L). Platelet transfusion may still
be necessary with IVIG if immediate cor-
rection of the thrombocytopenia is needed.
Corticosteroids can be effective in reducing
platelet destruction and increasing vascular
integrity. Methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg IV
every 6 to 8 hours, with IVIG is frequently
effective. Regular head ultrasounds should
be done while the infant remains severely
thrombocytopenic (<50  109/L). If intra-
cranial bleeding is present, platelets should
be kept at 100  109/L. Head MRI is nec-
essary to further deﬁne the hemorrhage.
Ultrasound should be repeated at 1 month
in children with ICH to identify early
hydrocephalus. Resolution of thrombocyto-
penia typically occurs within 2 to 6 weeks.
Mothers with an affected infant should
be counseled on the need for aggressive
monitoring with future pregnancies due
to the risk of increasingly severe NAIT. Fetal
platelet counts should be obtained starting
around 20 weeks of gestation, with ultra-
sound monitoring for hemorrhage. Mater-
nal antiplatelet titers cannot be used to
accurately predict affected fetuses. IVIG
1 g/kg/week given to the mother from
mid-gestation until near term has been
shown to effectively increase fetal platelet
counts in the majority of cases. Delivery
should be planned near term with an elec-
tive cesarean section or planned induced
vaginal delivery after documented increase
in fetal platelet count following administra-
tion of maternal IVIG. Antigen-negative
platelets, which can be obtained from the
mother by apheresis, should be obtained
and prepared prior to delivery in the event
of extreme thrombocytopenia or hemor-
rhage. The infant’s platelet count should
be checked at birth and every 6 to 12 hours
for 1 to 2 days and be kept 50  109/L.
Frequency of monitoring can be decreased
depending on the stability of the platelet
count and the clinical status of the infant.
Neonatal autoimmune
thrombocytopenia
Neonatal autoimmune thrombocytopenia
occurs due to the passive transfer of auto-
antibodies from mothers with ITP and may
114
Chapter 12

be idiopathic, caused by other disorders
including autoimmune diseases such as sys-
temic lupus erythematosis, hypothyroidism,
and lymphoproliferative states, or second-
ary to medications. Unlike NAIT, these
antibodies recognize both maternal and
fetal platelet antigens. Maternal ITP should
be distinguished from gestational thrombo-
cytopenia that tends to occur late in preg-
nancy and leads to mild thrombocytopenia
in the mother (e.g., 70 to 100  109/L)
without the development of antibodies.
Therefore, the infant is not at risk for
thrombocytopenia. Maternal platelet counts
return to normal shortly after birth. The
degree of thrombocytopenia seen in neo-
nates born to mothers with ITP is less severe
than with NAIT, with only 10% to 15%
having platelet counts <50  109/L. Bleed-
ing is minimal and ICH is rare (<1% to
2%). The platelet count may be normal at
birth but falls within 1 to 3 days of delivery.
Platelet counts should be monitored closely
and a head ultrasound obtained to exclude
ICH. Treatment should be initiated if the
platelet count falls below 30 to 50  109/L
with the same treatment regimen as for
NAIT: IVIG, IV methylprednisolone, and
random donor platelet transfusion if neces-
sary for hemorrhage. The duration of
thrombocytopenia is usually 3 to 6 weeks.
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia
In addition to immune-mediated mechan-
isms induced by drugs, many bone marrow
suppressive agents such as chemotherapy
cause thrombocytopenia, though usually
in the face of pancytopenia. Management
is usually with platelet transfusion, to pre-
vent or treat bleeding. The bone marrow
effects of these agents often deﬁne their
dose-limiting toxicity, and thrombocytope-
nia is a common effect. Patients usually
respond well to platelet transfusion but can
become refractory because of the underlying
illness, organomegaly and sequestration,
development of alloimmunization, sepsis,
and other medications. Other potential
offending drugs include anticonvulsants
such as valproic acid, chlorothiazides, estro-
genic hormones, ethanol, ristocetin, and
protamine sulfate.
Heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia
(HIT) is caused by antibody formation to
complexes of heparin and platelet factor 4
leading to platelet activation, often resulting
in severely low counts as well as risk for
thrombosis. It is much less common in
children than adults. HIT should be sus-
pected in the child receiving heparin (usu-
ally secondary to unfractionated but can
also occur with low molecular weight) who
develops unexplained thrombocytopenia of
any degree within 5 to 10 days of exposure,
often deﬁned as a decrease of 50% from
baseline (even if still in the normal range).
Testing for heparin-induced antibodies is
not very speciﬁc as many patients without
HIT will have circulating antibody. If sus-
pected, based on clinical scoring that deﬁnes
likelihood, functional studies of platelet
activation under the presence of heparin
can be done by specialized laboratories.
These tests include the serotonin release
assay and heparin-induced platelet aggrega-
tion assay. Heparin should be discontinued
and replaced by an anticoagulant that does
not lead to antibody formation such as
argatroban. Warfarin should not be utilized
immediately due to associated protein C
deﬁciency with risk of microthrombosis
leading to skin necrosis and gangrene.
Nonimmune thrombocytopenia
Many nonimmune-mediated processes lead
to increased platelet consumption. Gener-
alized platelet activation with trapping of
microaggregates in the small vasculature
contributes to microangiopathic hemolytic
anemia (MAHA) occurring in congenital
Thrombocytopenia
115

heart disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS), and thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura (TTP). HUS is primarily associ-
ated with a prothombotic state induced by
exposure to shiga-toxin producing Escher-
ichia coli (usually O157:H7), particularly
affecting the renal vasculature and leading
to the triad of MAHA, platelet consump-
tion, and renal failure. HUS is the most
common cause of acute renal failure in
children. Patients may present with abdom-
inal pain and bloody diarrhea and are trea-
ted with supportive care (i.e., red cell trans-
fusions, dialysis as necessary). Platelet trans-
fusion may worsen the clinical status and
should be used with caution.
Idiopathic TTP is a rare disease in chil-
dren, characterized by the pentad of throm-
bocytopenia,
hemolytic
anemia,
renal
impairment, neurologic symptoms, and
fever, although few patients present with
the full gamut of symptoms. Idiopathic TTP
is often clinically indistinguishable from
diarrhea-negative HUS. There is also a rare
congenital form in which affected neonates
present with jaundice and thrombocytope-
nia, although patients may not have an
episode of overt TTP for years until triggered
by infection, pregnancy, or stress. Patients
with congenital TTP have low levels of
ADAMTS13, a protein that cleaves unusually
large multimers of von Willebrand factor
into a biologically less-active form. Absence
of ADAMTS13 inhibits cleavage of these
large multimers allowing spontaneous plate-
let adhesion and aggregation.
Patients with acquired TTP, which is
often idiopathic, commonly demonstrate
antibodies to the protein, unlike the con-
genital form in which there is a constitutive
deﬁciency. Affected individuals are more
commonly female, of African descent, and
diagnosis can be associated with pregnancy,
autoimmune disease, infection, or trans-
plantation. The hallmark of disease is the
presence of segmental hyalin microthrombi
in the microvasculature that can also be seen
in the lymph nodes and spleen. Classic signs
and
symptoms
include
fever,
malaise,
nausea and vomiting, abdominal and chest
pain, arthralgia and myalgia, pallor, jaun-
dice, purpura, progressive renal failure, and
ﬂuctuating neurologic signs and symptoms.
Laboratory features include thrombocyto-
penia and MAHA. The peripheral blood
smear will show polychromasia, basophilic
stippling, schistocytes, microspherocytes,
and nucleated red cells. The DAT (Coombs)
should be negative as TTP is not an auto-
immune hemolytic anemia. The LDH and
unconjugated bilirubin will be elevated and
haptoglobin reduced due to the MAHA,
with associated hemoglobinuria. Without
treatment, mortality is >90%. Plasmaphe-
resis is the mainstay of therapy in the
acquired form. Fresh frozen plasma is usu-
ally sufﬁcient to treat the congenital form.
Patients may also beneﬁt from rituximab
and
other
immunosuppressive
drugs
including steroids, cyclosporine, cyclophos-
phamide, vincristine, and azathioprine.
Increased utilization of platelets may
occur in active bleeding, infection, or sepsis.
In disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC), there is an imbalance between intra-
vascular thrombosis and ﬁbrinolysis, with
increased platelet consumption, depletion
of plasma clotting factors, and formation
of ﬁbrin. DIC can be initiated by many
events, including sepsis due to bacteria,
viruses, or fungi; malignancy, particularly
acute promyelocytic leukemia and neuro-
blastoma; hemolytic transfusion reactions;
and trauma. Therapy is aimed at treating
the underlying etiologic process. Supportive
care consists of platelet transfusion to
maintain platelet counts >50  109/L and
plasma protein replenishment to correct
coagulopathies and maintain ﬁbrinogen
>100 mg/dL.
Thrombocytopenia can occur in the sick
newborn
for
many
reasons,
most
116
Chapter 12

commonly
with
infection,
prematurity,
asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome,
pulmonary hypertension, or meconium
aspiration. These infants appear to have
normal to increased platelet production, but
a decreased platelet life span for reasons that
are unclear. Thrombocytopenia is a fre-
quent occurrence in congenital cyanotic
heart disease associated with compensatory
polycythemia.
Therapeutic
phlebotomy
may lessen the thrombocytopenia.
The association of thrombocytopenia
and giant hemangiomas occurs in the
infant with Kasabach–Merritt syndrome
and represents a form of localized intravas-
cular coagulation. The hemangiomas may
be multiple and may involve only viscera.
Therefore, in an infant with unexplained
thrombocytopenia, imaging studies should
be done to look for a vascular anomaly.
Hemangiomas are proliferative lesions that
grow rapidly for several months and then
regress spontaneously. Platelet thrombi may
develop in these lesions and platelet life span
may be decreased. These infants may also
have a consumptive coagulopathy with low
ﬁbrinogen levels and elevated concentra-
tions of ﬁbrin degradation products. The
lesions are also prone to necrosis and infec-
tion. A particular hemangioma’s size or
location cannot predict whether it will lead
to platelet trapping and thrombocytopenia.
These infants should be managed by close
observation and hematologic monitoring
while waiting for regression to occur. How-
ever, the lesions may become large enough
to compromise the infant by impinging on
the airway or vital organs, leading to com-
partment syndrome, and resulting in serious
illness or death. External compression of
hemangiomas by ﬁrm bandaging, when
possible due to location, may reduce blood
ﬂow and platelet trapping. Corticosteroid
treatment at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day may
bring about regression of the lesion and
normalization
of
the
platelet
count.
Interferon a-2a has been shown to be ben-
eﬁcial in correcting the platelet count and
shrinking the lesion. Recent fortuitous dis-
covery of propanolol as a treatment for
hemangiomas has now made it ﬁrst-line
therapy; although not clearly delineated, the
mechanism of action is likely related to the
inhibition
of
angiogenesis.
Supportive
transfusion therapy is indicated with active
bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Platelet
transfusion as well as infusion of coagula-
tion factors (fresh frozen plasma, cryopre-
cipitate, and antiﬁbrinolytic drugs) may be
helpful but usually are of only transitory
beneﬁt. Antiplatelet medications (aspirin
and dipyridamole) have been used in the
past to interfere with platelet trapping
within the hemangioma but carry the risk
of causing platelet dysfunction in addition
to the existing thrombocytopenia.
A variety of conditions that result in
splenomegaly are associated with throm-
bocytopenia. The large spleen sequesters
and destroys circulating platelets. Anemia,
leukopenia, and neutropenia may also be
present. Megakaryocytic production in the
marrow is normal, and may be accelerated
in response to a decrease in the circulation.
Storage diseases, early portal hyperten-
sion, hemolytic conditions (red cell mem-
brane defects), infections such as with
HIV, EBV, and CMV, and malignancies
are frequently associated with splenomeg-
aly and may result in hypersplenism
(increased splenic activity and resultant
red cell destruction).
Decreased platelet production
Thrombocytopenia due todecreased produc-
tion may be a result of an acquired or inher-
ited disease process. Decreased production
may be a direct effect of marrow crowding
due to malignancy (leukemia or metastatic
solid
tumors
such
as
lymphoma,
Thrombocytopenia
117

neuroblastoma,
medulloblastoma,
and
rhabdomyosarcoma)
or
storage
diseases
(Gaucher, Neimann-Pick, etc.). Drugs may
be implicated in decreased production. The
liver is the site of TPO production and liver
disease is associated with chronic severe
thrombocytopenia. Severe iron deﬁciency
can result in decreased production, though
early iron deﬁciency states are associated with
an elevated platelet count likely due to mar-
row stress. Diseases affecting the marrow
matrix (aplastic anemia and myeloﬁbrosis)
cannot support stem cell growth and matu-
ration with resultant thrombocytopenia.
Thrombocytopenia related to an inher-
ited condition is frequently distinguished
by characteristic clinical features, early
presentation and chronic course, family
history, platelet morphology, and lack of
response to classic treatments for ITP. A
number of these conditions are associated
with
macrothrombocytes
and
mild-to-
moderate
thrombocytopenia
including
Bernard-Soulier syndrome, MYH9-related
disorders
(May-Hegglin
anomaly
with
bluish
cytoplasmic
inclusions
including
Sebastian, Fechtner, Epstein, and Alport-
like syndromes), platelet-type von Willeb-
rand disease, gray platelet syndrome (stor-
age pool disease), benign Mediterranean
macrothrombocytopenia, Paris-Trousseau
type thrombocytopenia, and more poorly
deﬁned syndromes such as Montreal plate-
let syndrome. Microthrombocytes are seen
in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X-linked
disorder resulting from a mutation on the
WAS gene. Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome is
characterized by thrombocytopenia, recur-
rent bacterial and viral infections secondary
to T-cell dysfunction, chronic eczema, and a
propensity to develop autoimmune disor-
ders. Patients with defects in the WAS gene
may also have a milder syndrome called
X-linked
thrombocytopenia
with
small
platelets and immune dysregulation which
may develop over time. Of note, it is
difﬁcult to appreciate small platelets in the
newborn and the mean platelet volume
reported on the CBC is unreliable in the
face of thrombocytopenia.
Patients with inherited thrombocytope-
nia may have normally sized platelets in
certain conditions including congenital ame-
gakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (CAMT),
thrombocytopenia with absent radii (TAR),
familial platelet disorder and predisposition
to AML (acute myelogenous leukemia), ame-
gakaryocytic thrombocytopenia with radio-
ulnar synostosis (ATRUS), and autosomal
dominant thrombocytopenia. CAMT, a rare
cause of neonatal thrombocytopenia, is a
bone marrow failure syndrome inherited in
an autosomal recessive manner due to deﬁ-
ciency in the TPO receptor c-mpl. Bleeding
symptoms lead to diagnosis in infancy
although CAMT is often initially confused
with other more common neonatal causes of
thrombocytopenia such as alloimmune- and
autoimmune-mediated processes. However,
unlike these other conditions, the thrombo-
cytopenia does not resolve with time. There
are no classic physical features. Diagnosis is
based on markedly reduced megakaryocytic
precursors in the bone marrow with normal
erythroid and myeloid lineages with elevated
TPO levels. Current treatment is supportive
care, platelet transfusion as needed, and con-
sideration for curative hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation. Gene therapy is being
developed.
Children with ATRUS present similarly
to CAMT with severe thrombocytopenia at
birth, but with the addition of associated
skeletal anomalies and sensorineural hear-
ing loss. Skeletal abnormalities are fusion of
the radius and ulna at the elbow, often
associated with minor clinodactyly. The
disease may progress to aplastic anemia
or leukemia. TAR syndrome is also thought
to be secondary to a defective response to
TPO with variable thrombocytopenia and
normal erythroid and myeloid lineages.
118
Chapter 12

Most cases are diagnosed at birth or in utero
due to bilateral absence of the radii man-
ifested as a shortening of the forearms
and ﬂexion at the elbows. The thumbs are
present, which distinguish TAR from the
skeletal anomaly associated with Fanconi
anemia. Patients may have additional plate-
let dysfunction and are at risk for signiﬁcant
bleeding episodes. Typically, the thrombocy-
topenia improves through childhood. Asso-
ciated clinical features include additional
skeletal limb defects, renal and cardiac anom-
alies, facial capillary hemangiomas, and cow’s
milk intolerance. Fanconi anemia is an in-
herited disorder characterized by chromo-
somal instability with skeletal anomalies
and
hypoproductive
thrombocytopenia,
although other cell lines are eventually
affected. These patients have an increased
susceptibility to develop leukemia and may
beneﬁt from early hematopoietic stem cell
transplantationifasuitabledonorisavailable.
Case study for review
A 9-year-old previously well Hispanic boy
presents to the emergency department
with a 2-hour history of profuse epistaxis.
On presentation he is noted to be well-
developed and well-nourished, frightened,
fatigued, and pale, with numerous ecchy-
moses and blood pouring from both
nares. He is emergently triaged and has
bilateral nasal packing placed. He con-
tinues to have massive bleeding and has
repeated emesis of digested and bright red
blood. His vitals are T 37.2C, HR 156, RR
30, and BP 62/38.
1. What are your immediate thoughts
regarding possible diagnosis? How do you
conﬁrm this and what steps do you take in
treatment and stabilization of your patient?
2. What
pertinent
history
should
you
obtain?
3. What ﬁndings do you look for on exam-
ination to either conﬁrm or dispute your
suspected diagnosis?
Obviously, the ﬁrst concern is to try to stop
the bleeding and treat him for acute, symp-
tomatic hemorrhage. You suspect a bleeding
disorder and see this is an otherwise healthy
child with no known inherited bleeding
diathesis. Although ITP presents with acute
massive bleeding in fewer than 5% of cases,
you are appropriately concerned that he has
mucosal type bleeding associated with either
an acquired or inherited platelet problem,
which may be qualitative or quantitative.
You order a STAT CBC to determine both
platelet and hemoglobin levels and initiate
ﬂuid resuscitation awaiting the results.
Additional historical points to elicit
include recent illness, medication exposure,
underlying disease, and prior symptoms.
You are contemplating other diagnoses such
as von Willebrand disease and acute leuke-
mia and ask questions related to these pos-
sibilities. In this case, the mother states that
he has been healthy, with no prior medica-
tions, illnesses, hospitalizations, or other
comorbidities. There is no family history
of a diagnosed bleeding disorder (though
you make a mental note to pursue these
questions later as family members may not
have been evaluated for symptoms sugges-
tive of von Willebrand disease). The mother
states that he on awakening this morning
had unexplained bruises over his torso and
extremities and blood blisters in his mouth.
He complained of feeling sick to his stom-
ach and began to have simultaneous emesis
and nose bleeding, which led to her calling
an ambulance as she could not stop it.
On examination, you note he is alert and
oriented, though frightened to see so much
blood and expresses to you he thinks he is
going to die. You provide reassurance and
quickly note his oral and skin ﬁndings of
diffuse petechiae and purpura. Purpuric
Thrombocytopenia
119

lesions on the torso are very unusual and
frequently not associated with trauma, reﬂect-
ing more spontaneous bleeding. He has no
adenopathy, organomegaly, other skin rashes,
and no pain on palpation of the extremities
and abdomen with full range of motion of all
joints, and in general appears well developed
and appropriate for age. All these ﬁndings are
supportive of a diagnosis of ITP.
Your patient’s CBC comes back with a
platelet countof2  109/L, hemoglobin6.2 g/
dL, and white blood cell count of 7.4  109/L
with a normal differential. You explain the
anemia as secondary to massive epistaxis.
Your patient now has evidence of gross
hematuria and melena, with a further drop
in blood pressure despite having received a
unit of packed red blood cells and volume
support. The complete metabolic panel and
coagulation studies are normal.
4. What is your next thought for treatment?
5. How do you counsel the family?
As you are now certain that this is acute ITP
and your patient is experiencing life-threat-
ening hemorrhage, you initiate therapy
with IVIG 1 g/kg IV over 4 hours, methyl-
prednisolone 1 mg/kg IV every 8 hours,
continuous infusion of packed red blood
cells, and ﬂuid support with Lactated
Ringer’s or normal saline. Consideration
should also be given to continuous infusion
of platelets. Consultation with an ENT
surgeon should be obtained for nasal pack-
ing and control of the bleeding in the
posterior pharynx.
The prognosis of ITP, even in the face of
such a dramatic presentation, is excellent.
However, this situation is tenuous due to
lack of therapies that could cause an imme-
diate rise in the platelet count. At this time,
his prognosis is guarded.
Your patient is hospitalized in the PICU
and continues to received red cell trans-
fusions,
continuous
platelet
transfusion
(1 pheresed unit every 2 to 3 hours), FFP
infusion, further doses of methylpredniso-
lone, and a second dose of IVIG. On day 3,
the hemoglobin drops to 4.6 g/dL and the
decision is made to perform an emergent
splenectomy. The family is counseled that he
may not survive this procedure. Fortunately,
however, he does very well and is supported
with transfusions without a worsened clinical
course. Unfortunately, there is no immediate
response
to
splenectomy.
Typically,
in
patients that do respond there is an imme-
diate increase in postoperative platelet count,
often to above normal levels due to an exag-
gerated marrow response that persists after
the source of peripheral destruction or
sequestration has been removed. Splenec-
tomy is not successful in 30% of cases and
it cannot be predicted who will respond. Our
patient continues to receive massive blood
product support for one week, then starts to
stabilize with an increase in hemoglobin to
8 g/dL and platelet count of 54 109/L. He
continues on a course of steroids, eventually
transitioning to oral prednisone, and taper-
ing off by 6 weeks. By this time his platelet
count normalizes, and several years later he
continues to have a normal platelet count.
Of interest, the patient re-presents with
moderate epistaxis, no anemia, and a nor-
mal platelet count 1 year later. Further diag-
nostic workup reveals a diagnosis of type 1
von Willebrand disease.
6. How would the knowledge of this
comorbidity have inﬂuenced your manage-
ment of the patient with the initial presen-
tation of ITP and massive epistaxis?
Knowledge of this disease may have led
to the use of additional therapies such
as DDAVP to stimulate release of von
Willebrand
factor,
and
Humate-P,
a
Factor VIII concentrate that also contains
von Willebrand factor and is used for von
Willebrand
factor
replacement.
It
is
120

unknown whether such additional therapies
may have impacted the clinical course.

Evaluation of the Child
with a Suspected
Malignancy
Each year approximately 15,000 children
and adolescents under 20 years of age are
diagnosed with cancer in the United States.
The likelihood of a young adult having a
history of childhood cancer is approxi-
mately 1 in 300. Although cancer remains
the leading cause of death in children except
for accidents, survival continues to steadily
increase. In adolescents, cancer deaths are
less common than those caused by acci-
dents, homicide, and suicide. More than
80% of children diagnosed with cancer are
now expected to be cured of their disease.
That being said, cancer remains a devastat-
ing diagnosis. The initial approach to the
child and family must be with a heightened
sensitivity to the emotional impact. Once a
diagnosis of cancer is suspected, an imme-
diate
and
thorough
evaluation
should
proceed.
Initial symptoms of cancer may be some-
what elusive, given the subtle and overlap-
ping symptoms and signs that may be pres-
ent in both malignant and nonmalignant
disease. Many pediatricians and clinicians
may only see a new case of childhood cancer
every 5 to 7 years, and each case may be so
unique as to not allow for the increased
awareness of this possibility.
The history is the ﬁrst step in the diag-
nostic process, with the chief complaint
providing the most important clue. Most
of the symptoms of childhood cancer are
either due to a mass and its effect on the
surrounding tissues, invasion of the mar-
row, or secretion of a substance by the
tumor that disturbs normal function. A
careful family history should be elicited and
include familial cancers. Certain conditions
can predispose to malignancy such as
genetic diseases (e.g., Down syndrome,
Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, neuroﬁ-
bromatosis), prior history of a malignancy,
or radiation therapy. Environmental and
genetic factors have been associated with
the development of malignancy; genetic
factors are known to play a signiﬁcant role
in the development of pediatric cancer,
whereas environmental factors are postu-
lated to play a role in the increasing inci-
dence of certain cancers.
Timely diagnosis is critical though can be
difﬁcult due to the nonspeciﬁc symptoms
and rarity of the diseases. Though highly
curable in many circumstances, earlier diag-
nosis may play a factor in improved prog-
nosis. Consideration should be given to the
nature of the complaint by the child and

family, potential explanations for the com-
plaint (or lack thereof), persistence of symp-
toms, and lack of response to common
interventions (see Table 13.1).
Headache is one of the most common
complaints in the pediatric population, the
majority of which are attributable to non-
malignant conditions. Although few head-
aches are caused by intracranial masses,
primary brain tumors or metastases must
be ruled out when dealing with a patient
with
repeated
or
persistent
headaches.
Headaches are often the ﬁrst symptom of
a brain tumor and, dependent on location,
are frequently accompanied by more subtle
ﬁndings on neurologic examination. His-
tory should include questions to character-
ize the headache including worrisome signs
such as recurrent morning headache, head-
ache that awakens the child, intense inca-
pacitating headache, associated vomiting, or
changes in the quality, frequency, and pat-
tern of the headaches. Associated neurologic
symptoms or signs should warrant an emer-
gent evaluation for a tumor in the central
nervous system. These include, but are not
limited to, localizing symptoms such as
focal weakness, cranial nerve palsies, ataxia,
failure to thrive, and developmental delays
or
regression.
A
thorough
neurologic
examination,
including
evaluation
for
papilledema, should precede radiographic
imaging. Other important historical points
include an assessment of changes in visual
acuity, behavior, and academic perfor-
mance. MRI is recommended to evaluate
for the presence of an intracranial mass in
children with symptoms suggestive of a
brain tumor. CT may be appropriate as
an initial test in certain settings depending
on the availability of MRI. CT is a good,
rapid tool for the assessment of acute

hemorrhage or increased intracranial pres-
sure (see Table 13.2).
Lymphadenopathy is a common ﬁnding
on examination in children. Enlarged lymph
nodes are a frequent presenting sign in
association with malignancies or infection,
and differentiation requires a meticulous
and systematic approach. Lymph nodes
become large in response to infection or
inﬁltration. Generally, a lymph node is con-
sidered enlarged if it measures greater than
10 mm, although inguinal nodes may be
15 mm or greater before being considered
worrisome and epitrochlear nodes are con-
cerning once greater than 5 mm. In addition
to size, other factors to consider in establish-
ing a differential between infection and
malignancy include persistence or rate of
growth, quality of the node, location and
distribution
(e.g.,
adenopathy
that
is
symmetric, localized, regional, or dissemi-
nated), and presence of other signs or symp-
toms of infection. Adenopathy in the supra-
clavicular, axillary, or epitrochlear areas is
considered an abnormal ﬁnding. Adenopa-
thy that persists longer than 6 weeks is
concerning for malignancy as is a unilateral
location. Nodes that are hard, nonmobile,
and nontender are worrisome for malig-
nancy. Nodes associated with ﬂuctuance,
tenderness, warmth, or overlying erythema
are more consistent with infection. How-
ever, these are only generalizations as rap-
idly growing malignant nodes may be ten-
der and infectious nodes may be quite ﬁrm
and nonmobile.
Important historical points to elicit
include:
* Duration of lymphadenopathy or local-
ized mass
* Presence of a recent infectious illness
* Skin lesions, cuts, or abrasions (and rela-
tionship to nodal drainage patterns)
* Recent immunizations
* Medications
* Animal contact (e.g., cat scratch, rodent
bite, tick bite)
* Recent transfusion
* Travel
* Possible sexually transmitted infection
* Presence of symptoms such as arthralgias,
weight loss, and night sweats
The differential diagnosis of lymphadenop-
athy includes infectious etiologies (viral, bac-
terial, spirochetal, and protozoan), connec-
tive tissue disease, hypersensitivity states,
lymphoproliferative disorders, immunodeﬁ-
ciency states, storage diseases, and malig-
nancy. In infants, the differential diagnosis
of head and neck lumps includes lymphade-
nopathy and congenital malformations such
as cystic hygroma, thyroglossal duct cyst,
branchial cleft cyst, epidermoid cyst, and
neonatal torticollis. Localized adenopathy
may be infectious in origin including bacte-
rial causes such as Staphylococcus aureus,
beta-hemolytic strep, cat-scratch disease
(Bartonella henselae), and tuberculous and
nontuberculous mycobacteria, in addition to
nonbacterial causes such as HIV, EBV, cyto-
megalovirus (CMV), and toxoplasmosis.

The physical examination of the child
with lymphadenopathy includes an assess-
ment of the size, location, and quality of the
node(s). A full examination should include
assessment of the skin and mucocutaneous
tissues draining to the particular node in
question, and evidence of other signs related
to an underlying disease process such as
hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. Nodes
should be measured in largest diameter, the
quality should be assessed as to mobility,
ﬁrmness, tenderness, and overlying skin
changes, and these ﬁndings should be docu-
mented. Children with mildly enlarged
nodes should be monitored with frequent
examinations, and when not associated with
malignancy, most of these nodes will revert
to normal size.
If infection is considered the cause of
the adenopathy, as in localized cervical
adenitis, it is reasonable to treat the patient
with a 2 week course of antibiotics. Depen-
dent on the history, physical, and clinical
suspicion, a particular antibiotic regimen
can be chosen in addition to sending serol-
ogy or further testing for likely organisms.
A baseline complete blood count (CBC)
with differential and peripheral blood
smear should be done if there is any con-
cern for a diagnosis other than infection.
The patient should be seen again following
completion of the antibiotics and if the
node has not changed or has increased in
size, consideration should then be given to
biopsy. Many cases of infection-related
adenopathy resolve spontaneously in 2 to
6 weeks or as a result of antibiotic treat-
ment (see Figure 13.1).
For the large node (i.e., >2.5 cm in size)
or in the patient without response to anti-
biotics, further evaluation is required.
Additional studies should include a PPD
(or quantiferon gold), chest radiograph,
CBC with differential (if not already done),
chemistries including lactate dehydroge-
nase (LDH) and uric acid, and serologies
as indicated by history and examination. A
biopsy should be done on enlarging or
persistently large nodes or if adenopathy
is also seen on chest radiography. It is
recommended
that
excisional
biopsies
(i.e., removal of intact node) be performed
when malignancy is suspected to evaluate
the architecture of the node in addition to
the cellular inﬁltrate. The largest node
should be biopsied when possible, with
avoidance of the upper cervical and ingui-
nal areas. Studies to be performed on the
tissue include Gram stain and culture (bac-
terial, mycobacterial, viral, and/or fungal);
histology
and
immunohistochemistry
for suspected malignancy; and if malig-
nancy is conﬁrmed, ﬂow cytometry and
speciﬁc cytogenetic testing for further
classiﬁcation.
Splenomegaly is the ﬁnding of a palpa-
ble spleen edge on examination. A 1 to 2 cm
splenic tip is found in 30% of full-term
neonates and in as many as 10% of healthy
children. Approximately 3% of healthy
college students have palpable spleens.
Therefore, this ﬁnding on a routine physical
examination of an otherwise healthy child
should not create great concern. Children
with
other
signs
of
systemic
disease,
however, should have their splenomegaly
evaluated.
Splenomegaly is associated with many
disease states, both congenital and acquired:
* Hemolytic anemia: hereditary spherocy-
tosis, thalassemia, splenic sequestration in
sickle cell disease, and autoimmunity
* Immunological disease: common variable
immune deﬁciency, connective tissue dis-
orders, and autoimmune lymphoprolifera-
tive disease
* Infection: viral (EBV, CMV, HIV, hepa-
titis), bacterial (tularemia, abscesses, tuber-
culosis, infective endocarditis), spirochetal,
protozoan, and fungal
* Storage disease: Gaucher, Neimann-Pick,
and mucopolysaccharidoses
Evaluation of the Child with a Suspected Malignancy
125

* Malignancy: leukemias as well as Hodgkin
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
A detailed history should be obtained to
gain clues as to the etiology of the enlarged
spleen. The patient should be questioned
regarding current or recent infectious symp-
toms, fevers or rigors (e.g., in subacute
bacterial endocarditis, infectious mononu-
cleosis, and malaria), jaundice (with hemo-
lytic anemia or liver disease), abnormal
bleeding or bruising (malignancy), travel
to endemic areas (malaria), trauma (splenic
hematoma), and family history (hemoglo-
binopathies, thalassemia, and hereditary
spherocytosis with prior splenectomy or
cholescystectomy). The physical examina-
tion should include a measurement of the
spleen size (centimeters below the midcostal
margin), consistency, and presence of ten-
derness (which suggests rapid increase in
size)

to
the

adenopathy or hepatomegaly. The vitals
should be reviewed for evidence of fever
or hypotension and the skin assessed for
cutaneous bleeding. Other considerations
include evaluation for stigmata of speciﬁc
disease states including jaundice, cardiac
murmurs, arthritis, as well as speciﬁc ﬁnd-
ings of endocarditis including Roth spots
(retinal
hemorrhages),
Janeway
lesions
(nontender hemorrhagic lesions on the
palms/soles),
and
Osler
nodes
(tender
microemboli on the ﬁngers and toes).
The laboratory and imaging assessment
is determined based on suspicion of the
underlying
etiology
of
splenomegaly.
Consideration should also be given to a
secondary effect of hypersplenism in which
the child may have cytopenias due to a large
spleen. Persistent splenomegaly should be
fully investigated as follows:
* CBC: evaluate red cell indices, reticulo-
cyte count, platelet count, white blood
cell count, and review peripheral blood
smear (all to help rule out hematologic
disorders
such
as
hemolytic
anemia;
membrane disorders with spherocytes or
elliptocytes; increased red cell indices and
anemia in thalassemia; atypical lympho-
cytes as in EBV; leukemic blasts; and
cytopenias
secondary
to
leukemia
or
hypersplenism)
* Infection: blood culture, viral studies,
PPD (or quantiferon gold), thick and thin
smear, and serologies to rule out EBV,
CMV, HIV, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis,
and malaria
* Hemolytic evaluation: CBC, reticulocyte
count, direct antiglobulin test (Coombs),
haptoglobin, serum bilirubin, LDH, red cell
enzyme assays (G6PD, pyruvate kinase deﬁ-
ciency), osmotic fragility testing or ektacy-
tometry, and urinalysis
* Liver disease: complete metabolic panel,
coagulation studies, hepatitis panel, a-1
antitrypsin,
ceruloplasmin
(Wilson
dis-
ease), and 24-hour urine copper
* Connective tissue disease: ESR, comple-
ment (C3, C4, CH50), antinuclear antibody,
and rheumatoid factor
* Inﬁltrative diseases: bone marrow aspirate
and biopsy (looking for blasts, storage
cells)
and
enzyme
study
for
Gaucher
(glucocerebrosidase)
* Lymph node biopsy: can be done if per-
formed with coexistent lymphadenopathy
* Imaging: volumetric and heterogeneity
assessment with ultrasound, CT, or MRI;
liver–spleen scan with 99mTc-sulfur colloid
for functional analysis; can also send pit
count for pitted red blood cells.
Bone pain is unusual in children and ado-
lescents except when associated with trauma.
Growing pains are a common complaint and
consist of bilateral (80% of cases) lower
extremity pain occurring in the afternoon,
evening, or night, affect children between 3
and14yearsofage,occurmostcommonly on
a weekly or monthly basis and much less
frequently daily, and are relieved with mas-
sage in the majority of cases. Children pre-
senting with this complaint have an excellent
prognosis. Pain is otherwise usually due to
bone, bone marrow, or nerve inﬁltration.
Back pain in young people is pathologic and
may be due to a tumor in the spinal cord or
one causing external compression such as
neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or a
leukemic chloroma. This ﬁnding should
prompt an MRI of the spine, as these con-
ditionstypically resultinno abnormalitieson
plain ﬁlm.
Patients with primary bone tumors
often present with localized pain, fre-
quently in association with a growing mass.
Pain may be attributed to recent mild
trauma or growing pains. In some cases,
patients sustain a pathological fracture after
seemingly mild trauma due to inﬁltration
of the periosteum and weakening of the
bone. Bone pain is typically a presenting
symptom
in
patients
with
osteogenic
Evaluation of the Child with a Suspected Malignancy

sarcoma and Ewing sarcoma. Langerhans
cell histiocytosis very often involves bone
and may present with localized bone pain
anywhere in the body, often with overlying
soft tissue swelling.
Diffuse or multifocal bone pain is a
common presenting symptom in acute
leukemia. It is reported in more than
25% of patients diagnosed with acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia (ALL), but is seen less
commonly in acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML). It is due to marrow crowding with
leukemic cells. Patients will often com-
plain of back or leg pain that is persistent
and increasing in intensity and very young
children may become irritable and refuse
to walk or participate in normal activities.
Musculoskeletal pain in children is often
diagnosed as arthritis or bone or joint
infection. Pain may be asymmetric and
often children present with a limp with
pain seemingly disproportionate to the
ﬁndings on examination. In contrast to
children with arthritis, children with leuke-
mia will have worsened pain at night, severe
pain that may shift to other locations, no
morning stiffness or swelling, and may have
associated constitutional symptoms such as
weight loss and night sweats. Associated
laboratory ﬁndings that may suggest malig-
nancy include an elevated erythrocyte sed-
imentation rate, elevated serum LDH, ane-
mia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and/
or leukopenia. Any of these ﬁndings should
prompt
an
examination
of
the
bone
marrow.
Bone pain may also be a direct result
of bony metastatic disease or marrow
inﬁltration
secondary
to
other
tumors
including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosar-
coma, Ewing sarcoma, and non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Localized bone pain warrants
radiographic evaluation (two-view plain
radiographs) for the assessment of a lesion
or leukemic changes.
Cytopenias and/or abnormalities on
the peripheral blood smear are suspicious
for a marrow inﬁltrative process, primarily
leukemia. Isolated anemia, leukopenia, or
thrombocytopenia can occur in leukemia
but much more commonly the patient will
present with bi- or pancytopenia. Pancyto-
penia may also indicate the lack of blood cell
production as in aplastic anemia, or is
caused by the proliferation of malignant
cells in the marrow with resultant crowding.
The anemia is frequently characterized as
one of chronic diseases (i.e., normochromic
and low reticulocyte count). Leukocyte
counts are variable at presentation in acute
leukemia and may be normal, decreased, or
elevated. The cell differential, however, is
likely to show neutropenia and the periph-
eral blood smear will likely, though not
always, demonstrate blasts or immature
cells. Unless metastasis to the marrow has
occurred, leukopenia and thrombocytope-
nia are rarely associated with extramedul-
lary malignancies (see Table 13.3).
Patients
with bi- and pancytopenia
require bone marrow aspiration and possi-
bly biopsy for suspected diagnosis of a
marrow inﬁltrative process, most likely
acute leukemia. The situation can be more
complex in the case of a single depressed
lineage. Children with persistent or wors-
ening normocytic, normochromic anemia
without manifestations of hemolysis, clini-
cal suspicion of transient erythroblastopenia
of childhood, or renal disease with low
erythropoietin
production
should
have
diagnostic bone marrow studies performed.
Those with isolated severe thrombocytope-
nia suspected of having immune thrombo-
cytopenic purpura (ITP) with no clinical
signs or symptoms of malignancy should be
followed closely and, if with the develop-
ment of additional cytopenias or the need
to start corticosteroids as part of their treat-
ment for ITP, should also have a bone
marrow examination. The necessity of bone
marrow examination prior to the initiation
of steroids for the treatment of ITP is
controversial.
128
Chapter 13

Bone marrow examination with aspi-
rate and/or biopsy is indicated in the fol-
lowing situations:
* Signiﬁcant depression of one or more
peripheral blood lineages (white cells, red
cells, and platelets) without an obvious
explanation
* Presence of circulating blasts on the
peripheral blood smear
* Any cytopenias associated with unex-
plained lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly,
hepatomegaly, anterior mediastinal mass,
or bone pain.
Bleeding as a presenting sign in cancer is
usually related to severe thrombocytopenia
and occurs commonly in children with acute
leukemia. Manifestations typically involve
mucocutaneous tissues with clinical signs
including petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, and
menorrhagia. Patients with acute promye-
locytic leukemia (APL; AML M3) are at risk
for severe bleeding at presentation due to
underlying coagulation abnormalities and
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
(DIC), whereas Wilms tumor patients may
have acquired von Willebrand disease at
presentation
increasing
bleeding
risk.
Patients with extensive marrow involvement
such as advanced stage neuroblastoma may
also present with signiﬁcant purpura.
Mediastinal masses may lead to com-
pression of respiratory, vascular, or other
structures
and
can
range

asymptomatic incidental ﬁnding to signiﬁ-
cant compromise and an emergent situa-
tion. Most mediastinal masses in children
are malignant. Imaging with chest radio-
graphy and chest CT yields information
with respect to location in the mediastinum
and potential for compromise.
Anterior mediastinal masses are more
typically seen in older children and adoles-
cents and frequently are associated with lym-
phomas, T-cell leukemia, thymic tumors,
thyroid tumors, and some benign tumors
(teratomas, lipomas, and angiomas). Malig-
nant tumors, especially lymphomas and
leukemia, may have rapid growth rates and
quickly lead to compromise with presenta-
tion of superior vena cava syndrome, airway
obstruction, dysphagia, and symptoms of
increased
intracranial
pressure
due
to
decreased cerebral venous return. The mass
may cause a pericardial effusion or directly
obstruct cardiac outﬂow leading to cardiac
compromise. See Chapter 14 for assessment
and management.
Middle mediastinal masses are also
more likely malignant. Infections should
be in the differential diagnosis and one
should consider tuberculosis or histoplas-
mosis in addition to pericardial cysts, bron-
chogenic cysts, esophageal lesions, or direct
extension of an abdominal mass. Malignant
tumors common in this location include
Hodgkin lymphoma and nodal masses of
neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and
germ cell tumors.
Posterior mediastinal masses are gen-
erally neurogenic in origin and include
benign
and
malignant
tumors.
These
include
ganglioneuroma,
neuroﬁbroma,
and neuroblastoma. Most of these lesions
are asymptomatic, but may present with
symptoms of spinal cord compression such
as pain or focal neurological signs.
A palpable abdominal mass is one of
the most common presenting ﬁndings of a
malignant solid tumor in children. Non-
malignant
etiologies
include
impacted
stool, intussusception, abdominal aorta, a
distended bladder, hydronephrotic kidneys,
and pregnancy.
The age of the child can provide a clue to
diagnosis. In the newborn, an abdominal
mass is most likely to be a congenital abnor-
mality of renal origin. The most common
malignant tumors in young children are
neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor. Children
with Wilms tumor most often present well
appearing and the mass is an incidental
ﬁnding by a family member or during a
well-child check. Unlike Wilms tumor, neu-
roblastoma will often present with evidence
of spread and systemic symptoms including
weight loss, fever, and bone pain. In older
patients, the mass may be related to leuke-
mia or lymphoma with enlargement of the
spleen and liver. The most common lym-
phoma in children is Burkitt lymphoma
that may present as a rapidly enlarging
abdominal
mass
leading
to
pain
and
obstructive symptoms (gastrointestinal and
urinary tracts) in association with metabolic
derangements from tumor lysis. Burkitt and
other lymphomas, as well as primary gas-
trointestinal tumors, may also occur in the
ileocecal area and serve as a lead point for
intussusception.
The history is important to determine if
thesymptomsarerelatedtothemass.Acareful
genitourinary history should be obtained to
determine if the mass may be of renal origin.
Historical points may provide suspicion of
catecholamine production such as ﬂushing,
palpitations, diarrhea, and sweating (very
rare). Constitutional symptoms such as fail-
ure to thrive, fever, night sweats, and sudden
weight loss should lead one to suspect a
disseminated process such as neuroblastoma
in young children or lymphoma in older
children and adolescents.
A meticulous and careful physical exam-
ination of the child should be done by ﬁrst
attempting to have the child relax. When
examining the abdomen, keep in mind the
normal structures that may be present such
130
Chapter 13

as the liver or spleen edges, kidneys, aorta,
sigmoid colon, stool, or spine. A rectal exam-
ination and pelvic/vaginal examination may
be indicated but should be performed only
by an experienced practitioner and after
obtaining laboratory studies (should not
be neutropenic for a rectal examination).
Care should be taken to palpate the mass
gently and limit the number of examiners.
Imaging will also help determine size and
location. A careful general physical exami-
nation is vital as many tumors may have
associated signs and symptoms or underly-
ing syndromes. Aniridia, hemihypertrophy,
and genitourinary abnormalities have been
reported in association with Wilms tumor.
Subcutaneous nodules (typically bluish),
periorbital ecchymoses, opsoclonus-myoc-
lonus, and presence of organomegaly are
seen with neuroblastoma. Signs of preco-
cious puberty may be seen with tumors
involving
the
liver, adrenal glands, or
gonads (i.e., germ cell tumors). The neu-
rological examination may show evidence
of a Horner’s syndrome with apical tumors
(often neuroblastoma) or spine compres-
sion with large abdominal masses. See
Table 13.4 for the workup of a child with
Table 13.4 Evaluation of the child with an abdominal mass.

an abdominal mass. A surgical consultation
should be obtained and the decision made
whether to obtain a biopsy or perform a
resection of the mass. Surgical staging is done
by assessing tumor margins, nodal involve-
ment, presence of locally invasive or distant
disease, and for possible tumor spillage (see
Chapters 18 and 19).

Oncologic
Emergencies
The prognosis for children diagnosed with
cancer has steadily improved over the past
50 years, and it is now estimated that more
than 80% of children newly diagnosed with
cancer will ultimately be cured of their
disease. Given this positive outlook, it
becomes even more important that life-
threatening complications arising either as
a result of the patient’s cancer diagnosis or
the treatment being provided be promptly
recognized and appropriately treated.
Oncologic emergencies can be catego-
rized based on their pathogenesis, including
emergencies caused by space-occupying
lesions, those caused by abnormalities of
blood and blood vessels, and metabolic
emergencies.
Emergencies caused by
space-occupying lesions
Superior vena cava syndrome and
superior mediastinal syndrome
Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) refers
to the signs and symptoms resulting from
the compression or obstruction of the SVC
caused by an anterior mediastinal mass.
These include orthopnea, headache, facial
swelling, dizziness or fainting, sudden pal-
lor, and exacerbation of symptoms with the
Valsalva maneuver. The physical examina-
tion often reveals a plethoric, edematous
face and neck, jugular venous distension,
papilledema, and pulsus paradoxus. Blood
pressure changes, pallor, and even cardiac
arrest can result from postural changes.
Superior mediastinal syndrome is the com-
bination of SVCS and tracheal compression
that leads to symptoms of cough, dyspnea,
air hunger, and wheezing. Examination
often
reveals
decreased
breath
sounds,
wheezing, stridor, or cyanosis. Affected chil-
dren are often incredibly anxious as well.
Malignant tumors are the most common
primary cause of SVCS. The most common
cause is non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL;
usually lymphoblastic lymphoma or diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma). Other malignant
causes include Hodgkin lymphoma, T-cell
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia
(T-ALL),
malignant teratoma, thymoma, neuroblas-
toma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or Ewing sar-
coma. A secondary cause can be thrombosis
of the major vessels caused by the presence
of a central venous catheter. Nonmalignant
causes
include
mediastinal
granulomas
(histoplasmosis), aortic aneurysms, vascular
thrombosis
complicating
cardiovascular
surgery for congenital heart disease, shunting
for
hydrocephalus,
catheterizations,
and
infections (e.g., tuberculosis and syphilis).

The SVC is a thin-walled vessel with low
intraluminal pressure, prone to thrombosis,
and surrounded by thymus and nodes that
drain the right side and lower left side of
the chest. Part of the SVC is also in the
pericardial reﬂection. Lymph nodes, thy-
mus, and the pericardium may become
enlarged from infection or tumor involve-
ment and compress the SVC. Adjacent cor-
onary and collateral vessels can become clot-
ted. Compression, clotting, and edema lead
to diminished air ﬂow and blood ﬂow. Addi-
tionally, the trachea and right mainstem
bronchus are less rigid in children as com-
pared to adults.
Evaluation
1. History and physical examination. The
history is nonspeciﬁc, with a typically short
period of progressively worsening symptoms.
Patients with ALL may have a short history of
fever, bone pain, bruising, petechiae, or other
signs of marrow dysfunction. Presenting
symptoms and signs include cough and dys-
pnea (commonest), closely followed by dys-
phagia, orthopnea, hoarseness, chest pain,
facial edema, wheezing, pleural effusion,
pericardial effusion, features of carbon diox-
ide retention like anxiety, confusion, leth-
argy, headache, distorted vision, and syn-
cope, and occasionally other symptoms like
conjunctival suffusion and cyanosis.
2. Chest radiography including a lateral
view. This usually shows mediastinal wid-
ening, tracheal deviation or compression,
and possibly pleural effusions.
3. CT scan of the chest. This helps delineate
distortion of normal anatomy, identify tra-
cheal compression, and allow assessment of
mediastinal mass width. This may be done
in the prone position if the patient is unable
to lie supine.
4. Tissue diagnosis with least invasive proce-
dures, with no sedation, and local anesthesia
only. A biopsy is essential for diagnosis,
but must be able to be performed safely.
General
anesthesia
may
cause
cardio-
vascular and/or respiratory compromise
by increasing abdominal tone and decreas-
ing respiratory muscle tone and lung vol-
ume. Sedatives can also decrease venous
return and should be used cautiously.
5. Bone marrow aspiration under local anes-
thesia. If the bone marrow is involved, this
test will allow the diagnosis to be made
without a biopsy of the mass itself.
6. Examination of pleural ﬂuid/pericardial
ﬂuid/ascitic ﬂuid. In addition to relieving
distress, removal of ﬂuid and subsequent
cytological examination may allow a deﬁn-
itive diagnosis to be made, especially in the
case of NHL.
7. Echocardiography. This is necessary to
look for pericardial effusion and cardiac tam-
ponade and to evaluate myocardial function.
8. Pulmonary function tests. The patient’s
peak expiratory ﬂow rate and the shape of
the ﬂow volume loop can reliably predict
the patient’s ability to tolerate various diag-
nostic and therapeutic procedures.
9. Measurement of b-HCG (b-subunit of
human chorionic gonadotrophin) and AFP
(a-fetoprotein). Elevations in these markers
are diagnostic of a malignant germ cell
tumor, but they are generally not available
urgently.
Management
1. Children should be under close observa-
tion in the intensive care unit with elevation
of the head, continuous cardiovascular and
respiratory monitoring, and pulse oximetry.
2. Children with impending or actual air-
way obstruction should receive emergent
radiation therapy, given in 1 to 2 Gy frac-
tions for 1 to 4 days. A small area of the
tumor should be shielded to prevent radi-
ation-induced changes if a biopsy still needs
to be performed to establish the diagnosis.
The
surgeon
and
radiation
oncologist
should communicate to ensure that the
most easily accessible area is shielded.
134
Chapter 14

Tracheal swelling and further airway com-
promise can occur as a result of the
radiation.
3. Empiric therapy for suspected malig-
nancy may need to be initiated due to the
life-threatening situation. Steroids, cyclo-
phosphamide, vincristine, or anthracyclines
have been given in this situation to children
with suspected leukemia or lymphoma.
Prednisone is commonly used as most of
these children are ultimately diagnosed with
lymphoma or leukemia, especially if other
clues to the diagnosis are apparent (e.g.,
organomegaly,
generalized
adenopathy,
evidence of tumor lysis syndrome [TLS],
elevated WBC [white blood cell] counts).
Intravenous methylprednisolone is started
at a dose of 50 mg/m2/day divided BD.
Hydration should be given and the child
monitored for tumor lysis syndrome that
may be exacerbated by the initiation of
therapy and is discussed later.
Spinal cord compression
Acute spinal cord compression occurs in
about 5% of children with cancer. Prolonged
cord compression leads to irreversible neu-
rological injury with paralysis, sensory loss,
and loss of boweland bladder control. Once a
neurologicaldeﬁcitoccurs,itoftenprogresses
to paraplegia within days or even hours. The
most frequent cause of cord compression is
externalcompressioncausedbyextensionofa
paravertebral tumor through an interverte-
bral foramen into the epidural space. The
tumor compresses the vertebral venous
plexus leading to cord edema, venous hem-
orrhage,myelopathy,andischemia.Themost
common tumors leading to spinal cord com-
pression
include
neuroblastoma,
Ewing
sarcoma, NHL, and Hodgkin lymphoma.
Intraspinouschloromasinpatientswithacute
myelogenousleukemia(AML)arealesscom-
mon cause. Spinal cord astrocytomas and
ependymomas
can
also
cause
cord
compression,morecommonlyfromanintra-
medullary location.
Evaluation
1. Localized back pain or radicular pain
extending down the leg occurs in up to
80% of children with cord compression.
The duration is variable but generally short;
one series reported a range of 5 days to
4 weeks. Characteristically, straight leg rais-
ing, neck ﬂexion, or the Valsalva maneuver
aggravates the pain. Pain is almost always
the ﬁrst presenting symptom, with weak-
ness and bowel or bladder dysfunction
occurring later. Sensory loss may occur but
is often difﬁcult to identify, especially in
young children. Any objective neurological
deﬁcit requires further evaluation.
2. Plain radiographs are generally not help-
ful in identifying abnormalities in children,
as cord compression typically occurs via
extension of tumor through the interverte-
bral foramina without bony erosion or
injury. MRI is the best study for demon-
strating intraspinous extension, but is not
always immediate available. While CT is less
sensitive in identifying extension of disease
into the spinal canal, it will effectively iden-
tify paraspinous disease.
3. Examination of the cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) is rarely helpful, and patients may
experience rapid neurological deterioration
following a lumbar puncture (spinal coning).
Management
1. Patients with rapidly progressing spinal
cord dysfunction require immediate inter-
vention. Dexamethasone 1 mg/kg should be
given IV even before imaging is performed,
and an MRI should be obtained immedi-
ately. Patients with suspicious ﬁndings who
are stable should be started on a lower dose
of oral dexamethasone (0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg
every 6 hours) with imaging performed
within 24 hours.
2. If imaging reveals a tumor with spinal
cord compression, this must be promptly
Oncologic Emergencies
135

relieved. Surgical decompression with a
laminectomy quickly relieves pressure and
allows tumor to be removed for diagnosis. It
should be performed if the diagnosis is
unknown. If the diagnosis is known and
the tumor is radiosensitive, emergent radi-
ation therapy should be promptly initiated.
Chemotherapy is an alternative for chemo-
therapy-responsive tumors such as neuro-
blastoma, Ewing sarcoma, Hodgkin lym-
phoma, and NHL; the onset of action in
these tumors is similar to radiation therapy.
The prognosis for recovery of function is
directly related to the degree of disability at
diagnosis. This is associated with the dura-
tion of symptoms and the length of time
required to make the diagnosis. Patients
who are ambulatory at diagnosis typically
remain ambulatory; approximately 50% of
children who are nonambulatory at diagno-
sis regain the ability to ambulate.
Increased intracranial pressure
and brain herniation
Brain tumors are the most common solid
tumor in childhood, and the majority of
patients present with signs and symptoms
ofincreasedintracranialpressure(ICP).For-
tunately, few of these patients progress to
actual brain herniation. Most pediatric brain
tumorsareinfratentorialandcauseincreased
ICP by obstructing the third or fourth ven-
tricle with resultant obstructive hydroceph-
alus. They can also cause increased ICP sim-
ply by mass effect. This most commonly
occurs with astrocytomas, as well as with
primitive neuroectodermal tumors includ-
ing medulloblastoma.
The presentation can vary signiﬁcantly
depending on patient age. Common symp-
toms in infants include vomiting, lethargy,
personality changes, loss of developmental
milestones, and increased head circumfer-
ence. Older children commonly complain
of headache. This is frequently intermittent
at ﬁrst, and then becomes more frequent
and severe. It characteristically occurs in
the morning, and is often but not always
accompanied by vomiting without diar-
rhea. Other signs and symptoms include
diplopia, ataxia, hemiparesis, speech dis-
turbance, neck stiffness, dizziness, lethargy,
and coma.
Some tumors may also cause focal neu-
rological changes. Cerebellar astrocytomas
may lead to ipsilateral weakness, hypotonia,
and ataxia. Herniation of a cerebellar tonsil
often causes head tilt and neck stiffness.
Tumors near the third ventricle (cranio-
pharyngiomas, germ cell tumors, optic gli-
omas, and hypothalamic and pituitary
tumors) may cause visual loss, increased
intracranial pressure, and hydrocephalus.
A pineal tumor may lead to Parinaud’s
syndrome (impairment of upward gaze,
convergence nystagmus, and alterations in
pupillary response).
Evaluation
1. Assessment of vital signs is critical.
Increased ICP will often result in Cushing’s
triad: bradycardia, hypertension, and apnea.
2. A careful physical examination looking
for signs of increased ICP or impending
herniation must be done quickly. In addition
to the ﬁndings mentioned above, impending
brain herniation may cause changes in respi-
ratory pattern, pupil size and reactivity,
extraocular movements, spontaneous motor
function, and responsiveness to verbal and
physical stimuli.
Management
If increased ICP or impending brain herni-
ation is suspected, appropriate management
must be initiated prior to more deﬁnitive
testing to hopefully avoid death or perma-
nent neurological injury. The following
steps should be initiated:
1. Fluid intake should be limited to no
more than 75% maintenance.
136
Chapter 14

2. A loading dose of dexamethasone 0.5 to
1 mg/kg should be given IV followed by 0.25
to 0.5 mg/kg every 6 hours.
3. An emergent CT scan of the head should
be performed. A noncontrast scan will effec-
tively identify bleeding, most tumors, cere-
bral edema, and hydrocephalus.
4. If the diagnosis of increased ICP is con-
ﬁrmed, the patient should be admitted to
the ICU. Neurosurgical consultation should
be immediately obtained if a tumor is iden-
tiﬁed or the patient has hydrocephalus.
5. Acetazolamide 5mg/kg/dose every 6 hours
can be given to decrease CSF production.
6. Intubation
and
hyperventilation
to
decrease the pCO2 to 20 to 25 mmHg will
decrease cerebral perfusion. Care must be
taken not to cause cerebral ischemia.
7. Surgical options (external ventricular
drainage, third ventriculostomy) should
be considered.
8. Prophylaxis with antiseizure medication
should also be considered.
9. Intracranial pressure monitoring may be
beneﬁcial.
10. An MRI should be obtained as soon as
possible to look for or conﬁrm the presence
of a tumor.
Massive hepatomegaly
Massive hepatomegaly is the most emergent
complication of stage 4S neuroblastoma in
infants, especially those under 4 weeks of
age. While 4S neuroblastoma often regresses
spontaneously, when it occurs during early
infancy the resulting hepatomegaly can
cause death due to respiratory insufﬁciency
or hepatic failure.
Evaluation
1. The patient should be examined for evi-
dence of gastrointestinal dysfunction, respi-
ratory compromise (respiratory rate >60/
min or oxygen requirement), poor venous
return (leg edema), renal dysfunction (poor
urine output and azotemia), or dissemi-
nated intravascular coagulation.
2. A biopsy and staging evaluation including
CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis,
bone scan, bilateral bone marrow aspiration
and biopsy, and other imaging such as MRI
of the brain and spine should be performed
quickly if the patient is able to tolerate these
procedures. This will allow prompt initiation
of appropriate therapy.
Treatment
1. If the patient is stable and does not exhibit
any of the ﬁndings above, careful observation
and supportive care should be provided.
2. If the patient is unstable, treatment with
chemotherapy or radiation therapy should
be considered. Cyclophosphamide 5 mg/kg/
day for 5 days has been shown to be effec-
tive, as has radiation therapy at a dose of
150 cGy/day  3 days.
Emergencies caused by
abnormalities of blood and
blood vessels
Hyperleukocytosis
Hyperleukocytosis is deﬁned as a peripheral
WBC count exceeding 100  109/L. It is
most commonly seen at presentation or
relapse of AML, ALL, or chronic myeloge-
nous leukemia (CML). Using this deﬁni-
tion, the incidence of hyperleukocytosis at
presentation is 9% to 13% of children with
ALL, 5% to 22% with AML, and almost all
children in chronic phase of CML. How-
ever, clinically signiﬁcant hyperleukocytosis
occurs with WBC counts >200 109/L in
AML and >300  109/L in ALL and CML.
Using these criteria, the incidence is lower.
The most common complication of hyper-
leukocytosis in AML and CML is stroke,
whereas in ALL it is TLS. It is more common
in infantile ALL and AML, T-cell ALL, and
in any phase of CML.
Oncologic Emergencies
137

Hyperleukocytosis leads to occlusion of
small veins in the brain, lung, and other
organs through the formation of WBC
aggregates (white thrombi). The excessive
leukocytes also cause local hypoxia by com-
peting for available oxygen, leading to blood
vessel damage and bleeding. The degree of
obstruction is related to the whole blood
viscosity, which is related to the deform-
ability of the cells present and the sum of the
packed erythrocyte and packed leukocyte
volumes. As myeloblasts and monoblasts
are less deformable than lymphoblasts or
granulocytes, leukostasis is more likely to
occur in AML than in ALL or CML. Other
factors that can increase the risk of leukos-
tasis include dehydration and an elevated
hemoglobin level.
Poor perfusion and anaerobic metabo-
lism in the microcirculation lead to lactic
acidosis. When the WBC count is >300 
109/L, local proliferation of cells occurs
within the cerebral vasculature and brain and
vessel damage occurs, leading to secondary
hemorrhage. Vessel damage can occur any-
where in the body, though the most clinically
signiﬁcant is in the brain and lungs.
Evaluation
1. Signs and symptoms of leukemia are
usually present (pallor, fatigue, fever, bleed-
ing, bone pain, adenopathy, organomegaly,
anemia, thrombocytopenia).
2. Possible signs and symptoms of leukos-
tasis in the lungs or brain include hypoxia,
acidosis, dyspnea, cyanosis, blurred vision,
papilledema, stupor, coma, or ataxia. Pria-
pism may also occur in this setting.
3. The
laboratory
assessment
should
include frequent monitoring (q6 to 8 hours)
of the WBC count to follow the rate of rise
or the response to therapy. Metabolic stud-
ies also need close monitoring as the child
may have evidence of tumor lysis and renal
dysfunction. Evaluate electrolytes, BUN,
creatinine, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium, liver function studies, and
LDH at presentation, and then follow the
electrolytes,
BUN,
creatinine,
calcium,
phosphorus, and uric acid frequently to
assess response to therapy.
Treatment
1. Therapeutic
intervention
should
be
immediate.
2. If the child is being transported, these
simple measures should be initiated prior
to transport. The mainstay of therapy is
aggressive hydration, typically two to three
times maintenance intravenous ﬂuids. The
ﬂuids should be alkalinized to promote
excretion of uric acid by converting it to a
more soluble urate salt. A ﬂuid such as D5W
1/4NS with 40mEq/L NaHCO3 is quite suit-
able. Allopurinol or urate oxidase (rasburi-
case) should also be started to prevent or
decrease the severity of hyperuricemia. If
urate oxidase is given, alkalinization is not
required as the uric acid level falls precipi-
tously and uric acid solubility is no longer an
issue. This topic is discussed more fully in the
section on TLS.
3. If aggressive hydration does not bring the
WBC count down quickly to 100 to
200  109/L or the WBC count is rapidly
rising due to rapid tumor growth, cytore-
duction may be necessary. Two techniques
that have been used previously to acutely
decrease the number of circulating WBCs
are leukapheresis and exchange transfu-
sion. Because of the infectious disease
concerns with exchange transfusion, leuka-
pheresis is used almost exclusively where it
is available and technically feasible. The
purpose of leukapheresis is to decrease
tumor bulk, decrease the risk of TLS, and
correct the anemia and hyperviscosity (goal
of >30% leukocyte reduction with leuka-
pheresis). If used, single volume exchange
transfusion should be performed with
repeat laboratory analysis to determine
effectiveness. Further exchanges can be
138
Chapter 14

performed to reach the goal of a total WBC
count <200  109/L.
4. Therapy for the underlying malignancy
should begin as soon as possible and is the
only permanent therapy for hyperleukocy-
tosis. In general, it is safer from a metabolic
viewpoint to initiate chemotherapy with a
lower WBC.
5. Emergency cranial radiation therapy has
not been demonstrated to improve outcome
and is not recommended.
6. Platelet transfusions can be given safely
in small volumes, as platelets have not been
shown to increase viscosity or worsen leu-
kostasis. Platelets should be given if the child
is bleeding or the platelet count is <20
 109/L. Red cell transfusions should be
given with extreme caution due to the
potential to increase total blood viscosity
and worsen leukostasis. The only indication
is cardiovascular compromise caused by
anemia. The hemoglobin level should be
kept below 10 g/dL.
Anemia
Anemia is a common ﬁnding in children
presenting with malignancy. Up to 80% of
children presenting with ALL will be anemic
at diagnosis. This can result from bleeding,
inﬂammation, or marrow inﬁltration by
tumor. It is rarely an emergency; children
can tolerate a hemoglobin level as low as 2 to
3 g/dL if it develops slowly from decreased
production. Conversely, levels as low as 5 g/
dL can be life threatening if they occur as a
result of sudden hemorrhage.
Treatment
1. Anemia in this situation is treated with
packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions.
As a general rule, 10 mL/kg of PRBCs will
increase the hemoglobin level by 2 to 3 g/dL.
In practice, children with acute anemia due
to blood loss may need 15 to 20 mL/kg to
reach this level.
2. Several authors of textbooks on pediatric
oncology recommend that children with
profound anemia (hemoglobin <5 g/dL)
that has developed over an extended period
of time be transfused more slowly (1 vs.
3 mL/kg/h) to avoid causing congestive
heart failure. This concern is based on an
extrapolation of the Starling law of cardiac
physiology, but there are few data support-
ing this concern. Two published studies as
well as experience in our own institution
suggest that this practice is unnecessary,
especially if these children are being cared
for in the ICU where more careful moni-
toring is being performed. This can avoid
potentially exposing patients to additional
donor units unnecessarily.
3. All blood products given to known or
potential
oncology
patients
should
be
irradiated to prevent transfusion-associated
graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). They
should also be leukoreduced to decrease
the risk of CMV transmission.
4. Erythropoietin is not used in children at
this time to increase the hemoglobin and
decrease the need for transfusion due to data
from adult studies that suggest patients
receiving erythropoietin have inferior out-
comes compared to those who do not.
Leukopenia
Leukopenia is commonly found in newly
diagnosed oncology patients as well as during
therapy. This predisposes them to a variety of
infections with bacteria, viruses, fungi, and
protozoa. The evaluation and management
of this is discussed in Chapter 27.
Coagulopathy
Coagulopathy
in
children
with
cancer
results from a variety of mechanisms. The
most common is thrombocytopenia, which
can result from decreased platelet produc-
tion (marrow inﬁltration or adverse effect
of therapy) or from increased consumption
Oncologic Emergencies
139

(infection/DIC, splenomegaly, and sinu-
soidal obstruction syndrome). Abnormal
platelet function is seen in patients with
uremia. Reduced levels of coagulation fac-
tors are seen in patients with liver disease or
in DIC when coagulation factors are abnor-
mally consumed. It is important to remem-
ber that consumption can deplete anticoag-
ulant proteins as well, potentially making
the patient hypercoagulable.
Evaluation
1. The CBC will reveal thrombocytopenia,
and the prothrombin time (PT), partial
thromboplastin time (PTT), ﬁbrinogen, and
D-dimers will provide evidence of a clotting
disorder.
2. Patients presenting with a stroke-like
syndrome should have measurements of
protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III,
especially if they have recently received
asparaginase therapy.
3. A patient with an alteration in con-
sciousness or neurological abnormalities
associated with symptoms or signs sugges-
tive of a coagulopathy should have a non-
contrast CT scan of the brain performed
emergently looking for evidence of bleeding
or thrombosis.
Management
1. The short-term therapy for thrombocyto-
penia is platelet transfusion. Patients who are
ill or unstable should be transfused to keep
their platelet count >20 109/L. Patients
who are actively bleeding should be trans-
fused if their platelet count is <50 109/L in
case they have a component of platelet dys-
function. Patients undergoing invasive pro-
cedures (intubation, central venous catheter
placement, or biopsy) should be transfused
to a platelet count of 50 to 100  109/L
depending on the procedure.
2. One pheresed unit of platelets/m2 will
typically increase the platelet count by 50 to
60  109/L, although the increase in platelet
count is less predictable than the increase
in hemoglobin following PRBC transfusion.
3. As with PRBCs, platelets should be
irradiated and leukoreduced to decrease the
risk of TA-GVHD and CMV transmission,
respectively.
4. Patients with bleeding and an abnormal
PT/PTT should receive fresh frozen plasma
(FFP) at a dose of 10 mL/kg. This will
correct most clotting factor deﬁciencies
with the exception of Factor VIII and ﬁb-
rinogen. Patients with a ﬁbrinogen level
<100 mg/dL or a persistently prolonged
PTT
despite
FFP
replacement
should
receive cryoprecipitate at a dose of 5 mL/
kg; a typical unit of cryoprecipitate has a
volume of 20 to 50 mL. FFP and cryopre-
cipitate do not need to be irradiated or
leukoreduced as they are acellular products
and have no risk of causing TA-GVHD or
transmitting CMV.
Metabolic emergencies
Tumor lysis syndrome
TLS is a pattern of speciﬁc metabolic abnor-
malities that occurs as a result of extremely
rapid cellular turnover. It is almost always
encountered in the context of malignant
tumors that either have a rapid rate of
apoptosis or after initiation of therapy in
bulky tumors that are exquisitely sensitive
to the therapy being provided. The rapid
lysis of tumor cells in either situation causes
large amounts of potassium, phosphate,
and nucleic acids to be released into the
circulation, resulting in hyperuricemia,
hyperphosphatemia,
and
hyperkalemia.
When the uric acid concentration in the
renal tubule exceeds its solubility coefﬁ-
cient, urate crystals form in the tubule
causing obstruction. Lactic acidosis, sec-
ondary to poor tissue oxygenation in
patients with high WBC counts, may con-
tribute to uric acid deposition. In addition,
140
Chapter 14

phosphates are released when tumor cells
lyse. When the calcium– phosphorus prod-
uct exceeds 60, precipitation occurs in the
microvasculature, particularly in an alka-
line environment, further obstructing the
renal tubules and resulting in hypocalce-
mia. Lymphoblasts are particularly rich in
phosphate, containing up to four times the
amount found in normal lymphocytes.
Potassium is also released from tumor cells,
is secondarily elevated in poor renal func-
tion, and can lead to fatal arrhythmia. The
complete syndrome includes all these com-
ponents,
with
progressively
worsening
renal failure. Tumor inﬁltration of the kid-
ney and dehydration can further impair
renal function and accelerate the develop-
ment of TLS.
In
children,
TLS
develops
most
frequently
in
association
with
Burkitt
lymphoma or T-ALL. These malignancies
typically
present
with
a
large
tumor
mass, short doubling time (38 to 116
hours in Burkitt lymphoma), poor urine
output, and elevated uric acid and LDH.
TLS has also been reported in children
with hepatoblastoma and advanced stage
neuroblastoma.
Evaluation
1. Evaluate for signs and symptoms of
metabolic
abnormalities.
These
include
lethargy, nausea, vomiting, hypotension,
muscle spasm, and cardiac dysrhythmia.
2. Perform a metabolic panel in all chil-
dren with suspected malignancy to assess
for TLS. Frequent reassessments should be
performed early in therapy as well, par-
ticularly in patients with high tumor
burdens and those expected to respond
rapidly to treatment. The timing of this
will depend on the underlying disease,
evidence of preexisting renal dysfunction,
timing of initiation of therapy, and the
risk of TLS.
3. Carefully monitor vital signs, intake and
output for evidence of renal insufﬁciency,
and possible symptoms of hypocalcemia
(anorexia, vomiting, cramps, spasms, tet-
any, and seizures). A renal ultrasound may
be indicated in suspected renal dysfunction.
Therapy
1. Aggressive hydration should be provided
at a rate of two to three times maintenance.
If alkalinization of serum and urine is
desired, an appropriate starting ﬂuid is
D5W 1/4NS þ 40 mEq/L NaHCO3. The
bicarbonate should then be titrated to keep
the urine pH between 7 and 7.5, which will
optimize the excretion of both uric acid and
calcium phosphate.
2. An agent to prevent or reverse hyper-
uricemia should also be initiated immedi-
ately. Allopurinol is the most commonly
used agent for this purpose, and it can be
given at presentation and as needed during
the early phase of therapy for the preven-
tion or treatment of TLS. The urine is
typically alkalinized when allopurinol is
used, as it often does not cause a signiﬁcant
decrease in the uric acid level until the rate
of tumor lysis slows. It is given at a dose of
300 mg/m2/day
divided
every
8
hours
(800 mg/day maximum). Another agent,
rasburicase (urate oxidase), is a recombi-
nant enzyme that acts as a catalyst in the
degradation of uric acid into allantoin, a
highly soluble product compared with uric
acid. It works quickly (within 30 minutes
of IV infusion) and keeps the uric acid level
low for 12 to 24 hours or longer, depend-
ing on the underlying rate of cell turnover.
Rasburicase has been studied in children
with cancer who have hyperuricemia as a
result of tumor lysis and has been found to
be safe and effective. However, it is quite
expensive compared to allopurinol. Many
hospital pharmacies have practice guide-
lines that specify the conditions where
Oncologic Emergencies
141

rasburicase should be prescribed to avoid
overuse. It is given at a dose of 0.15 to
0.2 mg/kg/day in 50 mL preservative-free
normal saline IV over 30 minutes. While
the package insert states that this dose
should be repeated daily for up to 5 days,
in practice a single dose will often keep the
uric acid level low for 48 hours or more,
and may be sufﬁcient to prevent TLS for
the entire course. Patients treated with
rasburicase do not require alkalinization,
which is an advantage when managing
other electrolyte abnormalities. It will
precipitate hemolysis in patients with
G6PD deﬁciency and has caused methe-
moglobinemia in susceptible individuals.
Routine screening for G6PD deﬁciency is
not recommended before use, but families
should be asked about this possibility. It
also has rarely caused anaphylaxis.
3. Potassium should not be added to IV
ﬂuids until it is clear that the potassium is
stable and not increasing due to TLS or renal
insufﬁciency.
4. The patient’s intake and output must be
closely monitored to ensure it remains
balanced, taking into account insensible
losses.
5. Careful metabolic monitoring should be
performed.
6. An ECG should be obtained if the
potassium is 7 mEq/L or higher. This may
show widened QRS complexes and peaked
T waves in hyperkalemia. Symptomatic
hyperkalemia requires immediate therapy
with calcium gluconate, albuterol, and
glucose and insulin, along with kayexalate
to remove excess potassium from the body.
If this is ineffective, continuous renal
replacement therapy or dialysis may be
required.
7. If hyperphosphatemia is present, treat-
ment is forced saline diuresis with furo-
semide and dietary phosphate restriction.
Oral phosphate binders are typically not
effective, as they do nothing to remove
phosphate from the circulation. Persistent
hyperphosphatemia may require dialysis.
Hypercalcemia
Malignancy-associated
hypercalcemia
(MAH) is a rare complication of childhood
cancer, occurring in 0.4% to 1.3% of newly
diagnosed cases. It is seen most frequently in
ALLandalveolarrhabdomyosarcoma,buthas
also been reported in children diagnosed with
rhabdoid tumor, hepatoblastoma, Hodgkin
lymphoma, NHL, AML, brain tumors, and
neuroblastoma. The cause of MAH can be
increasedboneresorptionfromskeletalmetas-
tases or production of calcium-mobilizing
substances such as parathyroid hormone
(PTH)-related peptide or osteoclast-activat-
ing factor by the tumor. MAH in turn
adversely affects the ability of the kidney to
concentratetheurine,leadingtodehydration,
decreased glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), a
further reduction in calcium excretion, and
worsening hypercalcemia.
Evaluation
1. Symptoms of mild hypercalcemia (12 to
15mg/dL) include generalized weakness,
poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipa-
tion, abdominal or back pain, polyuria,
and drowsiness. More severe hypercalcemia
(>15mg/dL) results in profound muscle
weakness, severe nausea and vomiting, coma,
and bradydysrhythmias with broad T waves
and prolonged PR interval on the ECG.
2. Patients exhibiting any of these symp-
toms should have a serum Ca2þ
level
measured immediately. Measurement of
an ionized Ca2þ should be done if there
is any question about the validity of the total
calcium
measurement
or
to
rule
out
primary hyperparathyroidism or pseudohy-
percalcemia due to increased plasma pro-
tein binding capacity.
3. Measurement of the intact parathy-
roid hormone (PTH) level should be
performed
to
exclude
concomitant
142
Chapter 14

hyperparathyroidism. PTH levels are usu-
ally low, normal, or suppressed in MAH.
The
serum
concentration
of
calcitriol
should be measured when the hypercalce-
mia is suspected to be due to Hodgkin
lymphoma or NHL, as it has been impli-
cated as a key mediator of hypercalcemia in
almost all cases of Hodgkin lymphoma and
30% to 40% of cases of NHL.
Treatment
1. The goals of treatment are to increase
renal clearance of calcium and decrease
bone resorption.
2. Aggressive hydration will help increase
renal excretion of calcium. Forced diuresis
with normal saline at two to three times
maintenance and furosemide 2 to 3 mg/kg
every 2 hours was previously recommended.
Furosemide blocks calcium reabsorption by
the kidney, and can decrease the calcium
level in 24 to 48 hours. However, a recent
meta-analysis suggests the data to support
this approach are limited, and it can also
cause severe loss of sodium, potassium, and
magnesium. At present, the use of furose-
mide is recommended only for patients
experiencing
ﬂuid
overload
following
aggressive saline diuresis.
3. If the patient is hypophosphatemic,
phosphate
replacement
at
a
dose
of
10 mg/kg/dose 2 to 3 times/day may inhibit
osteoclastic activity and promote calcium
deposition into bone.
4. Bisphosphonates
have
become
the
treatment of choice for adults with MAH,
but these have not been widely studied in
children. The most published experience is
with pamidronate at a dose of 0.5 to 2 mg/
kg given IV over 2 to 24 hours. This has
been highly successful in correcting MAH
within 1 to 4 days of treatment. When
MAH is associated with ALL, rapid initi-
ation of induction therapy has been shown
to be very important in reversing the
hypercalcemia.

Acute Leukemias
Acute leukemia is the most common type
of malignancy in children, accounting for
approximately 25% of newly diagnosed
cancers in patients less than 15 years of age.
Approximately 2500 to 3000 new cases are
diagnosed each year in the United States.
The peak incidence is between 2 and 5 years
of age. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
accounts for 75% of cases of leukemia,
followed by acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) in 20%, with the remainder being
other, rarer forms. The acute leukemias are
biologically classiﬁed by blast morphology,
surface proteins, cytogenetic abnormalities,
and cytochemical staining. This informa-
tion, in addition to clinical features, is uti-
lized for risk stratiﬁcation into treatment
groups. Risk-based therapy optimizes cura-
tive potential while minimizing risks and
side effects.
A number of hypotheses regarding the
etiology and pathogenesis of acute leukemia
have been described, including Knudson’s
two-hit hypothesis that entails an initial
early event (possibly prior to birth), fol-
lowed by a second, environmentally-medi-
ated (possibly infectious) event. Ionizing
radiation and exposure to benzene have
been associated with an increased risk of
developing leukemia. Certain syndromes
and chromosomal abnormalities have also
been associated with a high incidence of
developing leukemia (e.g., Down syndrome
[DS], Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome,
ataxia telangiectasia). Siblings, in particular
identical twins, have an increased risk of
developing leukemia as children. Most cases
of leukemia stem from somatic genetic
alterations, as opposed to an inherited
genetic predisposition. Though unclear at
this time, inciting events in the development
of leukemia in children and adolescents
involve complex relationships between host
genetic
polymorphisms,
environmental
exposures, and infections.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
The majority of ALL cases arise from B-cell
committed progenitors. T-cell ALL repre-
sents approximately 15% of ALL cases.
Cytogenetic abnormalities are common and
provide important prognostic information.
Hyperdiploidy (an excess of chromosomes;
e.g., >50) is seen in approximately one-
third of children with B-precursor ALL, and
the TEL-AML translocation t(12;21)(p13;
q22) is present in another 25% of cases.
Both of these cytogenetic ﬁndings are asso-
ciated with a favorable outcome, whereas
hypodiploidy (44 chromosomes), and the
presence of certain translocations such
as the Philadelphia chromosome t(9;22)

and the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)
rearrangement t(4;11) or t(1;19) have tra-
ditionally been associated with poorer out-
comes. The addition of tyrosine kinase inhi-
bitors in therapy may be signiﬁcantly alter-
ing the outcome of patients with the Phila-
delphia chromosome translocation. It is
important to note that conventional cyto-
genetics may not detect these common
translocations seen in ALL and therefore
FISH (ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization) is
necessary for detection.
Clinical presentation
The clinical manifestations of leukemia are a
direct result of marrow invasion with resul-
tant cytopenias (anemia, thrombocytope-
nia, leukopenia, and/or neutropenia) and
rarely
extramedullary
involvement
(see
Table 15.1). Children typically present with
nonspeciﬁc symptoms related to anemia
such as fatigue, irritability, and anorexia
as well as clinical signs such as pallor, tachy-
cardia, and more rarely evidence of conges-
tive
heart
failure.
Low-grade
fever
of
unknown etiology may be a presenting
manifestation due to presumed cytokine
release or may be related to infection
secondary to neutropenia and immunosup-
pression. Bleeding secondary to thrombo-
cytopenia is usually mild and manifests as
petechiae, bruising, gingival oozing, and/or
epistaxis. Life-threatening hemorrhage may
occur, but is very rare. Bone pain (typically
long bones) is common and may result in
refusal to walk or irritability in young chil-
dren. This may result from direct leukemic
inﬁltration of the periosteum or expansion
of the marrow cavity by leukemic cells.
Pathologic fractures may also be present
at diagnosis and cause signiﬁcant pain (see
Table 15.2). Patients with T-cell ALL present

with some distinctive features. It more fre-
quently occurs in males, and the incidence of
central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at
diagnosis is higher than for B-cell ALL (10%
to 15% vs. 2% to 5%). Patients are more
likely to present with a mediastinal mass
(nearly 50%) or a white blood cell (WBC)
count above 100  109/L (30% to 50%). The
presence of an anterior mediastinal mass
may cause airway or cardiovascular compro-
mise (see Chapter 14).
Frequently seen laboratory abnormali-
ties include elevated liver enzymes and lac-
tate dehydrogenase (LDH). Evidence of
tumor lysis related to a large tumor burden
and rapid cell turnover may result in hyper-
uricemia, hyperkalemia, and hyperpho-
sphatemia (with resultant hypocalcemia due
to precipitation of calcium phosphate).
CNS involvement occurs in less than 5%
of children at presentation, but is more
common in children with T-cell disease. It
is usually detected in an asymptomatic child
with analysis of the cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF). Rarely, a patient may present with
signs or symptoms of increased intracranial
pressure (e.g., cranial nerve VI palsy with
resultant esotropia and diplopia, papille-
dema, visual changes, morning headache,
vomiting, lethargy, irritability, possible sei-
zures) or evidence of parenchymal involve-
ment, hypothalamic syndrome, or diabetes
insipidus. Other rare complications such
as chloromas causing compression of the
spinal cord or CNS hemorrhage (related to
leukostasis and coagulopathy) are rare and
more likely to be associated with AML.
Leukemic involvement of the testes
occurs in 2% to 5% of boys at diagnosis
and presents as painless enlargement, either
unilaterally or bilaterally. Early testicular
involvement is also associated with T-cell
disease, elevated WBC count, and lympho-
matous features.
Diagnostic evaluation
Children presenting with more than one
cytopenia and clinical symptomatology sug-
gestive of bone marrow inﬁltration should
undergo a diagnostic evaluation to investi-
gate for the possibility of acute leukemia.
Laboratory and imaging studies indi-
cated are:
* Complete blood count (CBC), differen-
tial, review of peripheral blood smear by an
experienced individual
* Bone marrow aspirate (consider biopsy
for dry tap or inadequate specimen) for
morphology, blast count, immunopheno-
typing, cytogenetics, cytochemistry
* Metabolic panel, to include liver function
studies, electrolytes, lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), uric acid, phosphorus, calcium,
blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine
* Blood culture if febrile; cultures of other
suspected sites of infection
* Chest radiography to evaluate for the
presence of a mediastinal mass
* Plain ﬁlms of the long bones for patients
presenting with pain to evaluate for patho-
logic fracture or evidence of leukemic
changes
Typically the bone marrow is 80% to 100%
replaced with lymphoblasts at diagnosis. At
times, due to the packed condition of the
marrow, it may be difﬁcult to aspirate a
sample (dry tap) and a bone marrow biopsy
may provide diagnostic samples. The diag-
nosis
of
acute
leukemia
requires

presence of 25% or more blasts (M3 bone
marrow); however, the diagnosis is sus-
pected when the marrow contains 5% to
25% blasts (M2 bone marrow with M1
being a normal bone marrow with <5%
blasts) (Table 15.3). Lymphoblasts have a
typical morphology with a high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio, ﬁne nuclear chromatin,
and the presence of nucleoli. In addition,
the cells tend to have a uniform size and
appearance.
Immunophenotyping
and
cytochemistry are used to differentiate ALL
and AML and identify T- and B-cell ALL.
Lymphoid malignancies should lack mye-
loid cell surface markers (CD13 and CD33;
CD [cluster of differentiation]). B-cell ALL
should have B-cell surface markers such as
CD10, CD19, kappa, and lambda, whereas
T-cell ALL should have T-cell surface mar-
kers including CD2, CD5, and CD7. T-cell
ALL cells should also stain for terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase, an immature
lymphoid marker.
After the diagnosis is conﬁrmed, evalu-
ation of the CSF should be done prior to
therapy (this is frequently done at the time
of the diagnostic bone marrow aspirate if
the clinical suspicion is high). A lumbar
puncture is done to assess possible involve-
ment of the CSF and to assist with
therapeutic decision-making and risk strat-
iﬁcation. Many patients require a platelet
transfusion prior to the initial lumbar punc-
ture, which should be performed by an
experienced clinician to decrease the chance
of a traumatic tap. There is some evidence
that a platelet count of 100  109/L is
desired to decrease this risk. In addition,
evidence exists that a traumatic tap at diag-
nosis (with peripheral blasts) can theoreti-
cally seed the CSF space increasing the risk
of later CNS relapse. Subsequent procedures
may be done with platelet counts of 20 to
50  109/L, per institutional and provider
preference. A cell count and cytocentrifuge
examination for cell morphology is done on
the fresh CSF. The diagnosis of CNS leuke-
mia requires the presence of 5 or more
WBCs/mL and identiﬁcation of blasts on the
CSF cytocentrifuge examination. CNS leu-
kemia is classiﬁed as follows:
* CNS1: no detectable blasts
* CNS2: <5 WBCs/mL, blasts present
* CNS3: 5 WBCs/mL and blasts present or
signs of CNS leukemia (i.e., facial nerve
palsy, hypothalamic syndrome, or brain/eye
involvement)
A traumatic lumbar puncture is deﬁned as
the presence of 10 red blood cells/mL.
Formulas are available to assist with inter-
pretation of CNS status in the event of
traumatic initial taps with blasts on cytospin
(Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm).
Other assessments prior to
initiation of therapy
An echocardiogram and electrocardiogram
are done as baseline studies in all patients
who will be receiving anthracyclines. These
drugs are frequently given in induction for
high risk patients and in the delayed inten-
siﬁcation phase for all patients. Acute and
delayed cardiotoxicity may occur, though

late complications are more often related to
high cumulative doses (i.e., >300 mg/m2)
given at a young age (<4 years) and asso-
ciated with other risk factors for cardiac
disease such as mediastinal radiation, obe-
sity, family history of early cardiovascular
disease, and abnormal lipid proﬁles.
Viral serologies for hepatitis B and C,
cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex
virus (HSV), and varicella zoster virus (VZV)
are obtained as baseline information (see
Chapter 25). This aids in determining if later
infection with one of these viral agents could
be related to transfusion (potentially in the
case of hepatitis B and C), and whether
the infection is primary or reactivation (in
the case of CMV, HSV, and VZV). Baseline
knowledge of previous exposure may impact
later treatment choices.
Risk group classiﬁcation
The concept of risk stratiﬁcation allows
patients at comparatively high risk of
relapse to be treated with more intensive
and
potentially
more
toxic
therapies,
whereas patients at lower risk of relapse are
given lower intensity regimens that main-
tain the same low risk of recurrence while
minimizing exposure to unnecessary agents
and decreasing toxicity. Classiﬁcation into
risk groups is generally based on clinically
apparent prognostic factors identiﬁed by
retrospective analysis and then veriﬁed
by prospective studies. Many risk factors
have been utilized in risk classiﬁcation for
acute leukemia, but only age, WBC, and
immunophenotype (i.e., AML vs. ALL, T-
vs. B-cell ALL) at diagnosis continue to be
the most signiﬁcant factors for initial
classiﬁcation.
The commonly used National Cancer
Institute criteria classify standard risk (SR)
ALL as children 1 to 10 years of age with a
WBC <50  109/L and high risk (HR) ALL
as children with age 10 years or WBC
50 109/L.
Utilizing
these
criteria,
approximately
two-thirds
of
pre-B
and
one-third of T-cell ALL patients are classiﬁed
as SR. Better outcomes are observed in youn-
ger children, B-cell phenotype, those with
more favorable cytogenetic features, and
females.
Further stratiﬁcation into treatment
groups is done within the ﬁrst few weeks
of therapy based on early morphologic
response to therapy (as measured by day
7 and/or day 14 bone marrow aspirate),
cytogenetic abnormalities identiﬁed on the
diagnostic marrow, and remission status
at the end of induction (morphologic and
as measured by minimal residual disease
[MRD] detection). Other considerations
include presence of extramedullary disease
such as testicular or CNS disease. Infants
have a special category as they are a partic-
ularly high risk group, especially the very
young.
Treatment
Treatment of childhood leukemia is one of
the success stories in pediatric oncology,
though much remains to be accomplished.
Remarkable advances have occurred by the
identiﬁcation of more effective drug com-
binations, recognition of drug sanctuary
sites and routine presymptomatic CNS
directed therapy, intensiﬁcation of therapy
in early phases, and identiﬁcation of clinical
and biologic variables predictive of outcome
for use in risk stratiﬁcation.
Most children with cancer in the United
States are treated at pediatric oncology cen-
ters and have access to participation in clin-
ical trials. These studies have accelerated the
advances made in the diagnosis and treat-
ment of pediatric cancer and clearly are a
major reason for many of the successes. The
Children’s Oncology Group is a national
collaborative group of professionals involved
in the treatment of children with cancer.
Most
pediatric
cancer
centers
register
patients on these trials. Families are asked
148
Chapter 15

to give informed consent to participate in
these trials, which may include clinical and
biologic questions. For families not wishing
to participate, the standard of care is offered
(best published clinical regimen). Many
centers may also participate in smaller pilot
studies or have their own clinical protocols.
The purpose of therapy in ALL is to
induce a permanent biologic and clinical
remission (no evidence of disease on labo-
ratory and physical assessment). Overall,
approximately 85% of children with ALL will
be curedof their disease. Treatmentregimens
are classically divided into phases of therapy:
* Induction: refers to the ﬁrst 28 to 35 days
of therapy, after which the child should be in
a morphologic remission. Remission induc-
tion rate in SR ALL is 98%.
* Consolidation: further systemic chemo-
therapy is given, in addition to a focus on
CNS prophylaxis.
* Interim Maintenance: similar drugs as
maintenance, but in a more intensiﬁed
manner.
* Delayed Intensiﬁcation: refers to rein-
duction and reconsolidation; may be given
once or twice, depending on the protocol.
* Maintenance: continuation of therapy;
this phase lasts 2 to 3 years (longer in males
due to theoretical increased risk for testic-
ular relapse).
* CNS directed therapy: intrathecal meth-
otrexate; cranial radiation in select groups
(CNS3, T-cell).
Open clinical trials will likely alter some
aspect of therapy for certain risk groups
in an attempt to improve outcomes and
diminish acute and late toxicity. Some
examples may include adding a new agent
in certain phases, altering chemotherapy
dosing or timing in speciﬁc phases, or pos-
sibly asking a radiation-related question.
Conventional induction therapy includes
prednisone or dexamethasone, asparaginase,
and vincristine in addition to intrathecal
cytarabine
(Ara-C)
and
methotrexate.
Patients with HR ALL also receive daunoru-
bicin. Consolidation for HR patients incor-
porates
cyclophosphamide,
cytarabine,
asparaginase, 6-mercaptopurine, and inten-
siﬁedtherapydirectedtowardtheCNS(either
intrathecal methotrexate alone or with radi-
ation for patients with CNS disease). SR
patients receive intensiﬁed CNS therapy with
minimalsystemicchemotherapy.Thedelayed
intensiﬁcation (DI) phase has led to signiﬁ-
cantly improved outcomes as has further
intensiﬁcation of the interim maintenance
phase (intensiﬁed vincristine and methotrex-
ate compared to standard maintenance). DI
is a concept in which reintensiﬁcation of
therapy following attainment of remission
can be achieved with some alteration indrugs
utilized previously in the induction and con-
solidation phases. Maintenance classically
consists of pulses of steroid (prednisone or
dexamethasone) and vincristine in addition
to oral methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine.
Individualized drug dosing is required to
maintain certain hematologic levels and dif-
ferences in metabolism and tolerability are
likely related to individual polymorphisms.
This aspect of management in addition to
the length of maintenance makes it a unique
cancer therapy for children.
CNS prophylaxis continues with peri-
odic intrathecal methotrexate throughout
therapy. Children with CNS3 disease receive
augmented therapy with 1800 cGy cranial
radiation, in addition to intrathecal meth-
otrexate. Treatment of children with CNS2
disease is controversial although recent
Children’s Oncology Group studies have
showed no difference between CNS1 and
CNS2 patients receiving equivalent therapy.
This is due to the addition of medications
with improved penetration through the
blood–brain barrier, including dexametha-
sone instead of prednisone and high-dose
methotrexate. Without CNS prophylaxis, it
is estimated that 60% to 70% of children
Acute Leukemias
149

would relapse in the CNS (based on histor-
ical data). T-cell patients are at higher risk
for CNS relapse and augmented CNS-
directed therapy is given to all patients (even
without overt CNS involvement) with pro-
phylactic 1200 cGy cranial radiation.
Complications of therapy
Because of the myelosuppressive nature of
therapy and the underlying disease state,
children undergoing chemotherapy and/or
radiation may expect to experience compli-
cations during the course of their treatment.
Many of these complications can be antici-
pated and prevented (see Chapter 25). Most
patients will require transfusion support with
packed red blood cells and/or platelets (see
Chapter 5). Children with neutropenia are
instructed to take special precautions to
decrease the risk of infection exposure. Any
child receiving chemotherapy who develops a
fever should have emergent medical atten-
tion, especially during phases of anticipated
neutropenia (i.e., induction, consolidation,
delayed intensiﬁcation; see Chapter 27).
Certain therapies are associated with speciﬁc
toxicities: anthracyclines with cardiotoxicity,
vincristine with peripheral neurotoxicity,
intrathecal methotrexate with central neuro-
toxicity, steroids (especially dexamethasone)
withavascular necrosis ofbone,andradiation
with acute and late effects (see Chapter 30).
These anticipated side effects should also be
discussed in detail with the patient and family
to help with earlier recognition and support-
ive care should be initiated as needed. Poten-
tial late toxicities are monitored throughout
the course of treatment and in the off-therapy
phase of follow-up.
Relapse
Despite the dramatic improvements in our
knowledge about the biology of ALL, prog-
nostic factors, and more tailored therapy,
20% of children with ALL will relapse, with
only about one-third of those patients going
on to have a long-term remission with inten-
siﬁed therapy. Due to the frequency of ALL as
compared to other pediatric malignancies,
relapsed ALL is the fourth most common
oncologic diagnosis in children. Timing and
site of relapse are prognostic and important
determinants for future therapy. Sites of
relapse include the bone marrow or an extra-
medullary site, such as the CNS or testes, or
some combination of sites. Early relapse
(<18 months since therapy initiation) is
associated with a particularly grim prognosis.
Concepts of therapy include systemic retreat-
ment and radiation therapy to sites of extra-
medullary relapse. Allogeneic hematopoietic
stem
cell
transplantation
(HSCT)
may
improve the outcome of patients with mar-
row or combined relapse. Overall survival
after relapse is also impacted by cumulative
toxicity from prior therapy and high infec-
tion rates due to the increased intensity of
therapy. In general, children with late, iso-
lated extramedullary relapse fare better.
New agents
New agents are currently under investigation
to improve outcomes for high-risk and
relapsed patients. Such agents include the
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, dasati-
nib) in Philadelphia chromosome positive
ALL and nelarabine in T-cell disease. Finding
agents with favorable toxicity proﬁles for use
in highly treated relapse patients is a
challenge. Monoclonal antibodies such as
inotuzumab and epratuzumab (anti-CD22
antibodies) may be part of the solution.
Clofarabine, a new generation nucleoside
analog that inhibits DNA synthesis, is
currently being investigated in relapsed and
refractory ALL. Other drugs are being
explored utilizing newly acquired knowledge
of novel signaling pathways such as mTOR
inhibitors. It is anticipated that the next
generation of clinical trials will be utilizing
a combination of conventional chemother-
apy and immunomodulator therapy.

Acute myelogenous leukemia
Approximately 20% of acute childhood leu-
kemia is myelogenous. Unlike ALL, AML
does not have a peak incidence in children
as there are only subtle increases in inci-
dence from infancy to adolescence. On the
other hand, there appears to be a steady
increase with age in adults, in whom the
incidence of AML is approximately four
times that of ALL. AML is associated with
a poorer prognosis than ALL, with long-
term survival expected to be 50% to 60%.
Additionally,
therapy
for
AML,
which
includes
multiagent
chemotherapy
and
HSCT, is one of the most toxic therapies
in childhood cancer. Hispanic children are
noted to have a higher incidence of AML,
mostly accounted for by the acute promye-
locytic leukemia subtype (APL; M3). The
incidence of secondary AML following
treatment of childhood cancer is rising, due
in part to increased survival after primary
malignancy as well as increased use of agents
that cause direct DNA damage (e.g., alka-
lytors
[cyclophosphamide,
ifosfamide],
anthracyclines
[doxorubicin,
daunorubi-
cin], radiation therapy), and those that
inhibit topoisomerase II (e.g., epidophyllo-
toxins [etoposide] and anthracyclines).
The etiology of AML is likely sporadic
although several inherited and acquired risk
factors may predispose to this disease. The
most common inherited predisposition to
develop leukemia is DS. Children with DS
have a 10- to 20-fold increased risk of
developing acute leukemia compared to
other children. In early life, children with
DS have a particularly high risk of the
megakaryoblastic subtype of AML (AMKL;
M7). Overall, children with DS constitute
approximately 10% of children with AML.
In addition, approximately 10% of neonates
with DS may develop a transient myelopro-
liferative disorder that mimics congenital
AML but typically improves spontaneously
by 4 to 6 weeks of age. However, these
children have a 20% to 30% risk of devel-
oping AML before 3 years of age. Children
with transient myeloproliferative disorder
or presumed congenital AML who do not
display phenotypic features of DS should
have a karyotype performed to look for
possible trisomy 21 mosaicism.
Patients with inherited bone marrow
failure syndromes such as Fanconi anemia,
Kostmann syndrome, Bloom syndrome,
dyskeratosis
congenita,
Shwachman–
Diamond syndrome, congenital amegakar-
yocytic thrombocytopenia, and Diamond-
Blackfan anemia have a predisposition to
malignancy, including AML. Other condi-
tions
such
as
Li-Fraumeni
syndrome,
Noonan syndrome, acquired paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and myelodys-
plastic syndrome confer an increased risk.
Twins and siblings of AML patients have an
increased risk of AML, though this is much
more signiﬁcant in monozygotic twins
within 6 years of initial diagnosis. Exposure
to ionizing radiation has also been convinc-
ingly implicated, especially following the
atomic bombs in World War II.
Clinical presentation
AML and ALL are indistinguishable at pre-
sentation, with the majority of signs and
symptoms being related to inﬁltration of the
marrow and other body organs. Dependent
on the number of circulating myeloblasts
and total WBC, some of the presenting
manifestations may be life threatening.
Children with extreme leukocytosis (WBC
> 200  109/L) may present with metabolic
abnormalities and tumor lysis syndrome
(see Chapter 14). Clinically, they are at risk
for hypoxia in the small vessels of the brain
and lungs as a result of increased blood
viscosity related to the rheology of the mye-
loblasts (large, adherent, and nondeform-
able cells). This may translate to sludging
in the small vasculature of the retinal,
Acute Leukemias
151

pulmonary, and central nervous systems
with resultant decreased oxygen delivery,
hypoxia, and stroke.
Patients typically present with signs and
symptoms related to pancytopenia with pal-
lor, fatigue, anorexia, and bleeding. Fever is
very common at presentation, often with no
apparent infectious etiology. Bone pain is
also common, though not typically associ-
ated with fractures. Some unique and sug-
gestive features of AML at presentation
include leukemia cutis in infants (blueberry
mufﬁn rash thought secondary to extrame-
dullary
hematopoiesis)
and
chloromas
(extramedullary collections of myeloblasts).
Chloromas may occur in up to 10% of
children with AML and present most com-
monly in the bones, skin, soft tissues, and
lymph nodes, but may occur anywhere in
the body. Gingival hypertrophy is a unique
ﬁnding in AML secondary to chloroma of
the gums. A particularly rare yet important
presentation is spinal cord compression
from a chloroma in the paraspinal/epidural
region.
Life-threatening
bleeding
is
another
complication somewhat unique to AML.
Although the majority of patients will be
thrombocytopenic
secondary
to marrow
inﬁltration with myeloblasts, patients with
concomitant coagulopathy due to dissemi-
nated intravascular coagulation are at partic-
ularly high risk, a ﬁnding seen most com-
monly in APL (M3 AML). This association is
thought to be secondary to the release of
thromboplastin from cytoplasmic granules
in the promyelocytic blasts.
Children with AML and hyperleukocyto-
sis (WBC >100  109/L) are at risk for tumor
lysis syndrome at presentation and with the
initiation of therapy. Risk factors include the
presence of bulky disease with lymphadenop-
athy and/or hepatosplenomegaly as well as a
rapidly escalating WBC count suggesting a
high mitotic index (see Table 15.4).
Diagnostic evaluation
The same studies suggested for the evalua-
tion of ALL should be obtained in the
evaluation of the child with suspected AML.
It is common to see severe anemia and
thrombocytopenia in association with an
elevated total WBC count. The deﬁnitive
diagnosis is made with the evaluation of the
bone marrow, with at least 25% to 30% of
the cellular elements identiﬁed as myelo-
blasts based on immunophenotyping and
cytochemistry. Morphologic review may
also reveal Auer rods (clumps of azurophilic
granules shaped into elongated needles and
located in the cytoplasm), classically only
seen in some subtypes of AML (i.e., M2 and
M3). A lumbar puncture should be done as
up to 5% of children will have overt CNS
involvement at presentation. A coagulation
evaluation should be performed in these
patients including PT, INR, PTT, ﬁbrino-
gen, and D-dimers to evaluate for the
possibility of disseminated intravascular
coagulation (most typically seen in M3).

Several morphologic classiﬁcation sys-
tems are available for AML, including the
classic French-American-British (FAB) clas-
siﬁcation of M0 to M7 and the World
Health Organization (WHO) categorization
into four major subgroups (Table 15.5).
Additionally, chromosome analyses are per-
formed to obtain important diagnostic and
prognostic markers. Approximately 60% of
children with primary AML demonstrate
clonal abnormalities in the blast lineage
prior to therapy initiation. The t(8;21)
translocation is the most common chromo-
some translocation and is associated with
the M2 subgroup and a more favorable
prognosis. The t(15;17) translocation is
classically seen in APL (AML M3). Inversion
of chromosome 16 (inv(16)) is associated
with
acute
myelomonoblastic
leukemia
(AML M4) and also portends a favorable
prognosis. Finally, chromosomal aberra-
tions including monosomy 7 or 7q deletion,
monosomy 5 or 5q deletion, and complex
abnormalities
(3
or
more
unrelated
changes) all impart a worse prognosis.
Monosomy 5 and 7 are also highly associ-
ated with cases of secondary myeloprolifer-
ative disorders and AML that develop after
chemotherapy for a primary malignancy.
See Other assessments prior to initiation of
therapy in the ALL section for further
information.
Risk group classiﬁcation
Historically AML has been classiﬁed utiliz-
ing the FAB morphologic classiﬁcation sys-
tem (Table 15.5). The WHO classiﬁcation
system was subsequently developed to also
include cytogenetics, disease biology, and
clinical history. Host factors such as age,

gender, race, and constitutional abnormal-
ities all have some prognostic inﬂuence on
outcome. Females do slightly better than
males, older children do better than infants
(though outcomes in infants are improving
with current therapies), and Caucasians fare
better than non-white patents. Children
with DS, particularly those under the age
of 4 years at diagnosis, have an improved
outcome with less intensive therapy (overall
survival 80%) but also show increased tox-
icity with therapy. Children with an initial
WBC < 20  109/L have an improved out-
come and those with hyperleukocytosis
(WBC >100  109/L) have a worse out-
come. A number of recurring cytogenetic
abnormalities are associated with AML and
confer
prognostic
signiﬁcance.
Overall,
poor risk features include WBC count >100
 109/L, monosomy 7, and secondary AML.
Good risk features include certain FAB sub-
types (M1/M2 with Auer rods, M3, M4 with
eosinophilia), rapid response to initial ther-
apy, and favorable chromosomal features
such as t(8;21), t(15;17), and inversion 16.
As with ALL, assessment of MRD is becom-
ing an important marker of outcome with
chemotherapy and transplant.
Treatment
As with ALL, the goal of induction therapy is
to induce a clinical and biologic remission
by rapidly reducing the number of malig-
nant cells. Approximately 80% of children
achieve remission with induction therapy.
The most effective induction regimens use a
combination of cytarabine and an anthra-
cycline, typically daunorubicin. Individual
trials have built upon this backbone with
changes in dosing and timing, alternative
anthracyclines, or introduction of new sup-
portive care strategies to better manage
potential adverse effects of therapy. Other
agents utilized in continuation therapy
include etoposide, dexamethasone, 6-thio-
guanine, and asparaginase. Prior studies
have shown no added beneﬁt for a mainte-
nance phase following intensiﬁcation. Allo-
geneic HSCT is recommended for patients
with high risk cytogenetics (i.e., monosomy
7, FLT3/ITD [internal tandem duplication],
monosomy 5, or 5q-) or those who have not
attained a remission following two courses
of induction therapy. Patients with favor-
able
risk
cytogenetics
and
good
early
responses to induction therapy receive allo-
geneic HSCT only in the case of relapse and
if a second remission has been achieved. It
remains unclear if HSCT has beneﬁt for
those AML patients with intermediate risk
features (usually deﬁned as neither high risk
features nor low risk features) and decisions
must be made on an individual basis asses-
sing the clinical status of the patient, avail-
ability of an appropriate match, and family
preference.
The morphologic subtypes of AML with
highest involvement of the CNS are FAB M4
and M5. Overall, the frequency of CNS
involvement is between 15% and 20% at
diagnosis. All patients receive CNS conso-
lidative therapy with intrathecal cytarabine
in addition to high-dose cytarabine, which
has good CSF penetration. AML patients
with myeloblasts in the CNS can usually be
cleared with intrathecal cytarabine. Cranial
irradiation is reserved for those children
with refractory CNS involvement. Children
with Down syndrome rarely have CNS
involvement, and due to their increased
risk of toxicity, CNS prophylaxis has been
greatly reduced without negative conse-
quence in these patients.
APL is distinctly different from the other
AML subtypes and has a particularly good
prognosis due to the development of tar-
geted
therapies.
Approximately
3%
of
patients with APL die in the early phases
of therapy as a result of the unique hemor-
rhagic
complications
of
this
disease.
Patients receive treatment with differentiat-
ing agents such as all-trans retinoic acid
154
Chapter 15

(ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). The
t(15;17) translocation is present in the
majority of cases and leads to the produc-
tion of a fusion protein involving the reti-
noic acid receptor alpha and promyelocyte
gene leading to arrest of differentiation at
the promyelocyte stage. ATRA induces the
differentiation of immature promyelocytes
into mature granulocytes, followed by res-
toration of normal hematopoiesis. ATRA
does not cross the blood–brain barrier
and is therefore ineffective in treating CNS
involvement with APL. A WBC 10  109/L
is associated with a higher risk of relapse.
Higher WBC count is also associated with
the microgranular variant (M3v), presence
of the FLT3/ITD mutation, and the bcr3
isoform. Treatment includes induction with
ATRA and anthracycline therapy (i.e., idar-
ubicin or daunorubicin) followed by anthra-
cycline consolidation and maintenance with
intermittent ATRA and low dose 6-mercap-
topurine. The use of arsenic trioxide in the
initial treatment of patients with APL
remains controversial and is currently under
investigation. Similarly, the length and use
of a consolidation phase as well as the need
for intrathecal chemotherapy are yet to be
answered questions. Patients can expect an
event-free overall survival of 70% to 80%.
Toxicities with ATRA may be signiﬁcant;
speciﬁcally, ATRA may lead to a differenti-
ation syndrome in 2% to 6% of patients and
present with fever, respiratory distress,
weight
gain,
edema,
and,
importantly,
hyperleukocytosis. The incidence of ATRA
syndrome has decreased due to the addition
of anthracycline therapy in induction and
can be treated with IV dexamethasone.
ATRA may cause other side effects including
dryness of the lips and mucosa, fever, trans-
aminitis, and headache associated with
pseudotumor cerebri. Due to the rarity of
APL in pediatric patients, the role of arsenic
trioxide and transplant after relapse is still
poorly deﬁned.
Complications of therapy
Given the intensity of therapy for AML,
children can expect to experience a number
of complications that include cytopenias
requiring frequent blood product support,
mucositis, liver toxicity, need for parenteral
hyperalimentation, and severe, prolonged
marrow suppression. Infection is common
and should be anticipated. Once neutrope-
nic, these children are at particularly high
risk for the development of sepsis with
Gram-negative organisms in addition to
invasive fungal disease. Routine antifungal
prophylaxis with ﬂuconazole is recom-
mended in addition to PCP prophylaxis.
Streptococcus viridans sepsis is associated
with the use of high-dose cytarabine and
resultant altered integrity of the gastroin-
testinal mucosa. Sepsis with this organism
can be rapidly fatal. Empiric therapy for
fever and neutropenia should include cov-
erage for S. viridans and be started imme-
diately with the ﬁrst fever. Prolonged hos-
pitalization is expected during the course of
treatment for AML and these patients
should be in protective environments.
Coagulopathy at diagnosis is not uncom-
mon, especially in the child with APL. Coag-
ulation studies should be done routinely. In
general,plateletcounts shouldbemaintained
above 10  109/L (>50 109/L for the APL
patient at diagnosis). The use of fresh frozen
plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelets are
important supportive care measures due to
the frequently observed coagulopathy, hypo-
ﬁbrinogenemia (ﬁbrinogen <150 mg/dL),
and thrombocytopenia, respectively. This
will help prevent bleeding complications,
especially in the APL patient (in addition
to the early initiation of ATRA therapy).
Relapse
Even with current intensive therapies, only
about half of children diagnosed with AML
are expected to be long-term survivors. As
mentioned, patients with DS and APL have
Acute Leukemias

an improved prognosis. Some patients suc-
cumb to early mortality related to progressive
disease, infection, bleeding, and other com-
plications of therapy. After relapse, chemo-
therapy alone results in <10% 1-year disease-
free survival (DFS). For those patients that
can again obtain a morphologic remission
after
reinduction
chemotherapy,
HSCT
improves survival to 30% to 50%. MRD after
reinduction therapy for AML relapse has
been shown to be a vital prognostic factor
in DFS after HSCT. Newer modalities of
therapy are needed and are under investiga-
tion. These include targeted immunotherapy
(gemtuzumab targeted against CD33), tyro-
sine kinase inhibitors (lestaurtinib and sor-
afenib for patients with FLT3 mutations),
nucleoside analogues (clofarabine), farnesyl-
transferase inhibitors (tipifarnib), histone
deacetylase inhibitors (vorinostat), protea-
some inhibitors (bortezomib), and demethy-
lating agents (decitabine and azacitidine).

Central Nervous
System Tumors
Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the
most common cancer diagnosed in children
after leukemia, accounting for 20% of all
pediatric malignancies. The most common
location is infratentorial in children up to 14
years of age, while supratentorial tumors are
more common in adolescents. Spinal cord
tumors are also more common in adolescents
than in younger children (9% vs. 3%).
The cause of most pediatric CNS tumors
is unknown. The majority of them are
sporadic, although a small percentage is
associated with genetic disorders such as
neuroﬁbromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, von
Hippel–Lindau syndrome, and Li-Fraumeni
syndrome (germ line mutation of p53, a
suppressor oncogene). Radiation therapy
is the most frequently identiﬁed cause of
pediatric CNS tumors; these occur as second
malignancies in children who have previ-
ously received radiation therapy for the
treatment of leukemia or primary CNS
tumors.
In general, brain tumor classiﬁcation is
based on embryonic derivation and histo-
logic cell of origin, and occasionally on
tumor location. The World Health Organi-
zation
Classiﬁcation
System
for
brain
tumors contains more than 100 entries,
making it difﬁcult for pathologists to agree
on a diagnosis in speciﬁc cases. Microscopic
criteria useful in grading of tumors include
cellular pleomorphism, mitotic rate, degree
of anaplasia, and presence or absence of
necrosis. A growing number of chromo-
somal abnormalities and speciﬁc genomic
signatures have been identiﬁed in pediatric
brain tumors, and the use of these is becom-
ing increasingly important for accurate
pathologic classiﬁcation.
Clinical presentation
It is often difﬁcult to make the diagnosis of
a CNS tumor in a child. The presenting
symptoms of CNS tumors can be quite
variable, depending on the location of the
tumor, its rate of growth, and the age of the
child. Additionally, most of the symptoms
are nonspeciﬁc, and occur more commonly
in children with a variety of benign condi-
tions. Prompt diagnosis of a CNS tumor
requires an appropriate index of suspicion
and a good understanding of the duration of
symptoms that is expected with other dis-
orders. Due to the frequent association of
hydrocephalus with infratentorial tumors,
50% of children with brain tumors will
present with signs of increased intracranial
pressure (ICP), including lethargy, vomit-
ing, and irritability. These symptoms may

be less prominent in infants because the
cranial sutures remain open and the skull
can accommodate the increase in ventric-
ular size. For this reason, accurate mea-
surement of the head size should be part of
every well-baby examination. Headache is
a presenting symptom in 70% of children
with posterior fossa tumors and 50% of
central tumors. Features that are helpful in
distinguishing
tumor-related
headache
from
a
primary
headache
syndrome
include nausea and vomiting (particularly
in the morning), increasing frequency and/
or severity over a few weeks, and abnor-
malities
on
neurologic
examination.
Neurologic deﬁcits such as ataxia, visual
changes, and hemiparesis occur in about
25% of cases. Weakness is sometimes sub-
tle, but parents often relate a loss of phys-
ical function or developmental milestones.
Visual changes include diplopia caused by
cranial nerve dysfunction and loss of visual
acuity caused by optic nerve involvement
or papilledema.
Two speciﬁc clinical syndromes are fre-
quently associated with childhood brain
tumors. Parinaud’s syndrome consists of
paralysis of upward gaze, accommodative
paresis,
nystagmus
during
attempts
at
upward gaze, eyelid retraction (Collier’s
sign), and “setting-sun sign” (conjugate
downward gaze). It is most commonly asso-
ciated with pineal region tumors, but can also
be caused by obstructive hydrocephalus from
any cause, posterior fossa tumors, or a num-
ber of infectious or vascular abnormalities
leading to ischemia or damage to the dorsal
midbrain. Diencephalic syndrome is a rare
cause of failure to thrive in infants and young
children. Characteristic features include pro-
found emaciation with normal caloric intake,
absence of subcutaneous fat, locomotor
hyperactivity, euphoria, and alertness. It is
almost always associated with hypothalamic/
suprasellar tumors, most commonly optic
pathway gliomas.
Seizures are relatively rare in younger
children but occur twice as often in adoles-
cents (13% vs. 25%). They can be focal or
generalized. When focal they may provide a
clue as to the location of the tumor. An
often-overlooked symptom in school-age
children is deterioration in school perfor-
mance and behavioral changes. It is not
uncommon for these children to be referred
by a psychologist or psychiatrist after many
months of unsuccessful therapy for these
symptoms.
Symptoms of spinal cord tumors are
caused by compression of the spinal cord
or nerve roots by the mass. The most com-
mon symptom in children with spinal cord
tumors is back pain. Unlike adults, the
complaint of back pain is very rare in child-
hood. “Benign” causes of back pain include
trauma, medical conditions such as sickle
cell disease, or involvement in aggressive
sports such as football, gymnastics, skate-
boarding, or motocross bicycling. In the
absence of such a history, there should be
concern that a tumor might be the cause.
Tumor-related pain is often described as
being worse in the supine position or with
Valsalva’s maneuver. Other symptoms asso-
ciated with spinal cord tumors include sci-
atica, weakness, numbness, problems with
or loss of bowel and/or bladder control, and
spinal deformity.
Tumors within the spinal canal are either
intramedullary (within the spinal cord or
nerve roots) or extramedullary. Intramedul-
lary spinal cord tumors are almost always glial
in origin, the most common histologies being
astrocytoma, myxopapillary ependymoma,
and oligodendroglioma. Extramedullary tu-
mors are either intradural or extradural.
Extramedullary intradural tumors are most
commonly neuroﬁbromas, Schwannomas, or
more rarely meningiomas. Extradural tumors
are usually not CNS tumors at all, but
metastatic tumors from other locations such
as neuroblastoma, lymphoma, or Ewing
158
Chapter 16

sarcoma. Tumors within the vertebral bodies
such as primary bone tumors, tumors met-
astatic to bone, and histiocytosis can also
extend into the spinal canal and cause the
above symptoms.
Diagnostic evaluation
Imaging studies
The ﬁrst step in evaluating a child with a
suspected CNS tumor is neuroimaging. A
variety of imaging techniques can be useful
in this assessment.
Computerized tomography
Computerized tomography (CT) was the
ﬁrst imaging modality to revolutionize the
diagnosis of CNS tumors both in children
and in adults. It is often still the ﬁrst imaging
study obtained when evaluating patients
suspected of having a tumor. However,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
largely replaced it as the deﬁnitive neuro-
imaging study. Advantages of CT include
widespread availability, rapid acquisition
time, superior resolution of bone and vas-
cular structures including lesions of the
skull base, and utility in patients with con-
traindications to MRI (e.g., ferrous metal
implants). Its limitations include inferior
resolution of the brain itself, particularly
within the posterior fossa, and signiﬁcant
radiation exposure, especially with regular
monitoring.
Magnetic resonance imaging
An MRI with and without gadolinium
enhancement is the single best study for
evaluating the majority of tumors within
the brain and spine. It provides greater
sensitivity in areas that may be obscured
by proximity to bone, such as the temporal
lobe and posterior fossa. It also provides
multiplanar images. Contrast MRI allows
for identiﬁcation of tumor within areas of
surrounding edema, detects focal areas of
blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, and
improves delineation of cysts from solid
tumor.
Recent advances include MR spectros-
copy, tractography, and functional MRI
scanning.
MR
spectroscopy
allows
the
determination of the chemical makeup of
tissue within a predeﬁned region of interest.
Different types of tumors have characteristic
spectroscopic signatures, allowing the iden-
tiﬁcation of the most likely tumor type
before surgery takes place. Tractography is
a software technique that allows identiﬁca-
tion of the location of white matter tracts
and their associated nuclei. This has become
very useful as a preoperative planning tool
that allows the neurosurgeon to avoid dis-
ruption of eloquent nuclei and ﬁber tracts
during surgery. Functional MRI is another
technique that precisely identiﬁes speciﬁc
motor regions, speech and language centers,
and other eloquent areas for preoperative
planning purposes.
Positron emission tomography
Positron emission tomography (PET) imag-
ing is a relatively new modality for evalu-
ating a variety of tumors including those of
the CNS. It detects the relatively higher rate
of metabolism present in many neoplasms
by measuring the rate of metabolism of
one of a growing number of radioactively
labeled compounds. It has been used to
distinguish between recurrent tumor and
necrotic tissue, scar, or edema, each of
which can develop following the treatment
of a malignant brain tumor. It is used to
determine the most appropriate site for a
biopsy. Its utility in young children is lim-
ited due to the need for a 30- to 60-minute
period of limited mental activity between
injection and scanning to optimize the dis-
tinction between normal and abnormal
structures.
Central Nervous System Tumors
159

Single-photon emission C T
Single-photon emission CT is a three-
dimensional imaging technique introduced
in the early 1980s for the investigation of
regional cerebral blood ﬂow that often cor-
relates with tumor metabolic activity. In this
technique, radioactive thallium and radiola-
beled tyrosine have been used to localize
brain tumors as well as distinguish viable
tumor from radiation necrosis. It is much
less expensive than PET scanning, but the
resolution is less and the 20- to 30-minute
acquisition times needed for high-quality
pictures again limit the utility in young
children.
Other studies
Lumbar puncture
Certain primary CNS tumors such as
medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectoder-
mal tumor (PNET), ependymoma, malig-
nant germ cell tumors (GCTs), and, to a
lesser extent, malignant gliomas have a pro-
pensity to metastasize throughout the sub-
arachnoid space. As with other malignant
tumors, the presence of metastatic disease
alters both treatment and prognosis. For
this reason, a lumbar puncture (LP) is a
routine part of the diagnostic workup of
these patients. Spinal ﬂuid is collected and
sent for cell count and differential, glucose,
protein, and cytological examination to
look for malignant cells. Measurements of
a-fetoprotein (AFP) and the beta subunit of
human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG)
should also be performed on patients with
suprasellar and pineal region tumors to
identify malignant germ cell tumors. These
markers can, if present, also be used to
measure response to therapy. The diagnostic
LP should be delayed for at least 7 days
following tumor resection to allow any
nonviable tumor cells present in the CSF
as a result of the surgery itself to be cleared.
Bone marrow aspiration
In the past it was recommended that patients
with medulloblastoma undergo a bone mar-
row aspiration at the time of diagnosis to rule
out metastatic disease prior to starting ther-
apy. However, more recent studies have
indicated that fewer than 3% of patients
diagnosed with medulloblastoma have extra-
neural metastases at diagnosis, with fewer
than 25% of these having disease in the
marrow. Therefore, recent clinical trials have
no longer recommended routine examina-
tion of the bone marrow, but have instead
recommended this only for patients with
unexplained cytopenias. Extraneural metas-
tases are almost unheard of in other types of
pediatric CNS tumors, making bone marrow
aspiration at diagnosis unnecessary.
Bone scan
While 90% of extraneural metastases in
patients with medulloblastoma are to bone,
this remains an unlikely presenting ﬁnding
since, as mentioned above, fewer than 3%
of patients have extraneural metastases at
diagnosis. Therefore, bone scan should be
reserved for brain tumor patients who pres-
ent with bone pain with the underlying
diagnosis of medulloblastoma.
Treatment
Children with CNS tumors are typically
treated with some combination of neuro-
surgery, radiation therapy, and chemother-
apy. The speciﬁc treatment chosen is depen-
dent on the histology, location, resectability,
and prognosis of the patient’s tumor.
Neurosurgery
Initial neurosurgical intervention is indi-
cated in the majority of patients. Exceptions
include diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas
due to the inﬁltrative nature of the tumor
160
Chapter 16

throughout the pons and tumors that are
radiographically consistent with germ cell
tumors and present with elevation of both
AFP and b-HCG. This combination con-
ﬁrms the diagnosis of nongermanomatous
germ cell tumor (NGGCT) without a
biopsy, and aggressive surgery at diagnosis
has not been shown to improve survival.
The role of surgery in children with func-
tioning pituitary adenomas is also limited.
The goals of neurosurgical intervention
are to achieve the maximum tumor removal
possible while minimizing morbidity and
mortality and to obtain tissue for a histo-
logic diagnosis. In the case of medulloblas-
toma, PNET, ependymoma, and high-grade
gliomas, extent of surgical resection is one of
the major predictors of outcome.
Children with increased ICP caused by
obstructive hydrocephalus will likely have a
CSF diversion procedure performed as well,
either before their deﬁnitive surgery if they
are unstable or at the time of resection. An
external ventricular drain will often be placed
initially and will be clamped at some point
after surgery to determine if normal CSF ﬂow
has been restored. Children who redevelop
symptoms of increased ICP will likely require
placement of a permanent shunt.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy has played a pivotal role
in the management of children with malig-
nant brain tumors for decades. It has been
used to destroy remaining tumor in cases of
incomplete surgical resection and to treat
microscopic residual disease and metastatic
disease in children who have malignant
tumors with a high likelihood of tumor
regrowth. The dose of radiation used is
dependent on the type of tumor and the
location and volume to be irradiated.
Unfortunately, the use of radiation ther-
apy is associated with signiﬁcant adverse late
effects,
particularly
in
young
children.
Those children receiving radiation before
6 years of age can be expected to suffer
signiﬁcant impairment of intellectual and
physical development as a result of this
therapy. A group of young Canadian chil-
dren with medulloblastoma who received
“curative” doses of radiation therapy were
followed longitudinally
into adulthood;
none of the survivors were capable of inde-
pendent living. Another concern is the
development of secondary malignancies in
the radiation ﬁeld. Children receiving pro-
phylactic craniospinal radiation for leuke-
mia have been shown to have a >20-fold
increase in the risk of secondary CNS
tumors; more than 80% of these tumors
occurred in children who were radiated
before 5 years of age. Children with standard
risk medulloblastoma who survive >5 years
following conventional treatment including
radiation without a relapse are more likely
to die from a secondary radiation-induced
cancer than from a recurrence of their pri-
mary tumor.
A variety of innovations in radiation
therapy
delivery
have
been
developed
recently to minimize the side effects of
radiation. These include 3D conformal
planning techniques and intensity-modu-
lated radiation therapy, which minimize the
dose of radiation delivered to adjacent nor-
mal tissue. Another innovation is proton
beam therapy, which takes advantage of the
shorter decay path of high-energy protons
compared with gamma rays (photons). This
minimizes the exit dose delivered beyond
the site of the tumor. These innovations
have proven very valuable in decreasing the
radiation exposure to heart, lung, bowel,
and reproductive organs in children receiv-
ing whole spine radiation. Nevertheless, the
use of radiation therapy continues to carry
the risk of signiﬁcant morbidity. Work con-
tinues to develop novel strategies that will
allow the avoidance of radiation therapy
completely in children with CNS tumors,
or at least to delay it in very young children.

Chemotherapy
The utility of chemotherapy in the treat-
ment of CNS tumors was recognized more
recently than in other tumors. It was initially
felt that the BBB would prevent the delivery
of effective concentrations of chemothera-
peutic agents to the tumor. However, it
became apparent that many drugs do ade-
quately cross the BBB, or that this barrier is
abnormally permeable in many malignant
brain tumors. Other factors such as tumor
heterogeneity, cell kinetics, drug distribu-
tion, and drug excretion may also have a
signiﬁcant
impact
on
effectiveness
of
chemotherapy. Lower grade tumors are
characterized by a low mitotic index and
relatively slow growth rate; it was long felt
that these tumors would be less sensitive to
chemotherapy,
while
more
malignant
tumors would be more sensitive. However,
several studies over the last two decades
have demonstrated that many low-grade
tumors are sensitive to chemotherapy.
Commonly used drugs for the treatment
of brain tumors include vincristine, meth-
otrexate,
temozolomide,
procarbazine,
lomustine (CCNU), cisplatin, carboplatin,
cyclophosphamide, and etoposide.
Speciﬁc tumor types
Primitive neuroectodermal tumor
PNETs are the most common malignant
brain tumors in children. They are comprised
primarily of small cells with hypochromatic
nuclei and can occur throughout the CNS.
There
has
been
controversy
regarding
whether these tumors should be classiﬁed
as a single entity or divided by location.
The WHO has chosen the latter approach,
and divided these tumors into medullo-
blastoma (occurring in the cerebellum),
pinealoblastoma (occurring in the pineal
gland), and supratentorial PNET (occurring
elsewhere in the supratentorial region).
Medulloblastoma is the most common
malignant CNS tumor in children, account-
ing for up to 20% of all childhood brain
tumors. Supratentorial PNET is much less
common, comprising about 2.5% of cases
when pinealoblastoma is included. It has a
propensity to metastasize early; in up to
40% of cases, widespread seeding of the
subarachnoid space is present. Extraneural
spread is unusual at diagnosis, but may
develop later if tumor recurrence occurs.
The initial mode of therapy is surgery,
and extent of surgical resection directly
affects prognosis and treatment. Patients
with <1.5 cm3 of residual tumor after sur-
gery and no evidence of metastatic disease
are deﬁned as standard risk, while patients
with >1.5 cm3 of residual disease or meta-
static disease are considered high risk. Once
the diagnosis is conﬁrmed, patients should
be staged with an MRI of the spine and an
LP for cell count, glucose, protein, and
cytology. Additional studies looking for
extraneural metastases are no longer con-
sidered necessary.
PNETs including medulloblastoma are
very sensitive to radiation therapy, and as a
result this has traditionally been considered
the mainstay of postsurgical therapy. Due to
the high likelihood of metastases through-
out the CNS, it has been considered neces-
sary to deliver a dose of radiation to the
entire brain and spine (craniospinal irradi-
ation; CSI) to these patients, with a higher
(boost) dose delivered to the region of their
tumor. As the long-term consequences of
radiation have become more apparent,
especially for young children, strategies to
delay or avoid radiation in young children
have
become
more
widely
used
and
attempts have been made to decrease the
doses of radiation given to older children.
The value of chemotherapy both in
improving survival among patients with
PNETs and in allowing a reduction in the
dose of radiation therapy required for cure
162
Chapter 16

has become increasingly evident over the
past three decades. For the past several years
a combination of cisplatin, vincristine,
CCNU, and cyclophosphamide has been
used following completion of radiation
therapy with good effect. Vincristine is also
used during radiation therapy, and the
Children’s Oncology Group is evaluating
whether the addition of carboplatin during
radiation therapy will improve outcomes
further in children with high risk disease.
Due to the devastating effects that CSI
can have in children less than 6 years of age
at the time of treatment, an alternative
strategy was developed in the early 1990s
that substituted very intensive chemother-
apy followed by consolidative myeloablative
chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell
rescue without radiation therapy for these
young children. Known as the Head Start
regimen, this strategy proved fairly effective
for children with standard risk embryonal
tumors, but results were suboptimal for
patients with high risk medulloblastoma
or supratentorial PNET, including pinealo-
blastoma. In 1995, the second Head Start
study added high-dose methotrexate to the
existing chemotherapy; results from this
modiﬁcation
were
very
encouraging.
Patients with standard risk medulloblas-
toma had 5-year event-free survival (EFS)
rates of 50% and overall survival rates of
75%. Children who relapsed following che-
motherapy alone were effectively salvaged
with reoperation and radiation therapy in
half of the cases. This strategy led to more
than 70% of children with standard risk
disease treated on Head Start II being cured
without radiation therapy. The Children’s
Oncology Group is investigating a similar
strategy for children <3 years of age with
high risk medulloblastoma and supraten-
torial PNET.
The outlook for children >3 years of
age with standard risk medulloblastoma is
quite
good;
5-year
EFS
with
current
multimodality therapy is >80%. Children
with high risk medulloblastoma and supra-
tentorial PNET do less well; the most
recently published 5-year EFS rates are
50% to 60%.
Gliomas
Gliomas account for just over 50% of all
CNS tumors in childhood. They are a het-
erogeneous collection of tumors including
astrocytoma (60%), ependymoma (15%),
oligodendroglioma (15%), mixed gliomas
(5%), and other unspeciﬁed glial tumors
(5%). They can occur anywhere in the CNS,
although certain subtypes have a propensity
to occur in speciﬁc locations.
Gliomas are classiﬁed histologically into
grades 1 to 4 based on cellular pleomor-
phism, cell density, mitotic index, and
necrosis. Grade 1 and 2 tumors are deﬁned
as low grade gliomas (LGG); they are con-
sidered by some to be “benign,” but many
neuro-oncologists disagree with this deﬁni-
tion. Grade 3 and 4 gliomas are deﬁned as
high grade gliomas (HGG) and are clearly
malignant. For most gliomas, the histologic
classiﬁcation is the most important factor in
choosing therapy and predicting long-term
outcome.
Surgical resection is a key component of
therapy for most gliomas that are amenable
to this approach. This includes cerebellar
gliomas and supratentorial gliomas that are
not centrally located or within the optic
pathway. Gliomas occurring in the tectal
region of the midbrain are an exception
to this rule; these are very indolent tumors
that typically require no intervention. LGG
that are completely resected do not require
adjuvant therapy and are simply observed. If
they recur, re-resection is generally curative.
Surgery should be used judiciously, how-
ever. Most LGG can be controlled success-
fully with chemotherapy, so surgery that
leaves the patient with signiﬁcant postop-
erative morbidity should be avoided. HGG
Central Nervous System Tumors
163

always require adjuvant therapy, but the
likelihood of cure is related to the degree
of surgical resection.
Radiation therapy was a key part of the
treatment of all gliomas for many years, but
it is used very rarely now to treat children
with LGG due to the frequency of long-term
consequences of this therapy and the real-
ization that these tumors can be managed
successfully with chemotherapy. It remains
an essential component of therapy for HGG,
however. Since these tumors metastasize
much less frequently than PNETs, children
do not require CSI, but they do require
doses of 50 to 60 Gy to their tumor sites
to achieve local control.
The value of chemotherapy in the man-
agement of children with LGG has become
increasingly apparent over the past ten years.
This is especially true for children with neu-
roﬁbromatosis-associated LGG, as the fre-
quency of secondary malignant tumors in
these children after treatment with radiation
therapy is alarmingly high. The goal of ther-
apy in this situation is different than with
other tumors. Chemotherapy rarely leads to
total disappearance of the tumor, but rather
produces a state of stable disease that is
hopefully maintained after therapy is discon-
tinued. In this regard, management of
incompletely resected LGG is similar to man-
aging a chronic illness like asthma, with
periods of stability, occasional ﬂares of dis-
ease, and a hope that the child will eventually
“grow out” of their condition.
Gliomas arising in the brain stem deserve
special mention. These comprise about 15%
of brain tumors in children. About 70% of
these arise in the pons and are diffusely
inﬁltrative, and are termed diffuse intrinsic
pontine gliomas. These are the most deadly
of all childhood brain tumors; median sur-
vival of children with this diagnosis is 8 to 9
months, and 90% of affected children are
dead within 2 years of diagnosis regardless
of
the
treatment
provided.
Radiation
therapy has been estimated to prolong sur-
vival for a median of 2 months; since the
therapy takes 6 weeks to deliver, the impact
of this treatment on improving quality of
life may be minimal, especially for children
requiring anesthesia for their radiation.
Many trials have been conducted over the
past 25 years trying to improve the survival
of children with this tumor, all with disap-
pointing results.
Although ependymomas are traditionally
classiﬁed with other glial tumors, their behav-
ior and management is quite different. They
represent about 5% to 10% of childhood
primary brain tumors. About 60% of intra-
cranial ependymomas occur in the posterior
fossa and 40% are supratentorial. Grade 1
ependymomas are rare and almost never
occur in the brain, although Grade 1 (myx-
opapillary) ependymomas of the spine com-
prise about 10% of childhood ependymomas.
Grade 4 ependymoma does not exist.
The extent of surgical resection is the
most important prognostic factor in chil-
dren with ependymoma. The 5-year EFS
for patients having a complete resection is
80%, versus 40% for those patients having a
near-total or subtotal resection. Unfortu-
nately, ependymomas are often difﬁcult to
completely resect, especially in the posterior
fossa due to their predilection to surround
cranial nerves and other vital structures. It
remains unclear that postoperative chemo-
therapy improves survival in patients with
ependymoma, but it may improve outcome
when given before second look surgery to
improve the likelihood that a complete
resection can be achieved. Radiation ther-
apy remains an important component of
therapy for this tumor; the doses required
are similar to those needed to achieve local
control of other glial tumors. Ependymo-
mas are more likely to metastasize within
the CNS than other gliomas, especially if
they originate in the posterior fossa or are
Grade 3. Assessment of the spinal ﬂuid
164
Chapter 16

postoperatively is important, although neg-
ative spinal ﬂuid cytology does not reliably
identify patients less likely to recur away
from their primary tumor site.
Germ cell tumors
CNS GCTs are relatively uncommon. Their
management shares many similarities with
GCTs occurring outside the CNS. They are
discussed in Chapter 21.
Summary
In summary, although brain tumors occur
relatively commonly in children, the varia-
tions in histologic appearance, presentation,
treatment,
and
prognosis
make
their
management quite challenging. The best
outcomes for these children occur when
they are diagnosed early and treated at a
center
with a
multidisciplinary
neuro-
oncology program. Therefore, every effort
should be made to ensure that potential
signs of a brain tumor are not missed and
that early referral to such a multidisciplinary
center occurs.

Hodgkin and Non-
Hodgkin Lymphoma
Hodgkin
and
non-Hodgkin
lymphoma
together account for approximately 10% to
12% of malignancies in children; they are
third in relative frequency after acute leuke-
mias and brain tumors. Non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma (NHL) comprises approximately
60% of all lymphomas.
Hodgkin lymphoma
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is rare among
children <5 years of age and relatively rare
in the adult population, but is the most
commonly diagnosed cancer among adoles-
cents aged 15 to 19. HL is classiﬁed into two
general groups: classical HL (95% of cases)
and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL
(NLPHL, 5% of cases). Classical HL is further
subdivided into nodular sclerosis, mixed
cellularity, lymphocyte-depleted, and lym-
phocyte-rich forms. The tumor cells in clas-
sical HL are designated Hodgkin and Reed–
Sternberg (HRS) cells, whereas in NLPHL
they are designated lymphocyte-predomi-
nant (LP) cells. HRS cells are now felt to
derive from germinal center B-cells that have
acquired unfavorable immunoglobulin V
gene mutations and that normally would
have undergone apoptosis, whereas LP cells
derive from antigen-selected germinal center
B-cells. In both forms of the disease, the
tumor cells comprise only 0.1% to 10% of
the cells within the tumor.
Epidemiologic studies suggest that two
different forms of pediatric HL exist: child-
hood and adolescent/young adult (AYA).
The childhood form is deﬁned as occurring
in those 14 years of age, and is character-
ized by a male predominance and a histo-
logic subtype that is more likely to be mixed
cellularity (30% to 35%) or nodular lym-
phocyte predominant (10% to 20%). An
increased proportion of childhood HL is
associated with Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
infection, and studies suggest that early
exposure to EBV is a risk factor for devel-
oping HL in childhood. AYA HL occurs in
patients between 15 and 35 years of age.
There is no gender predilection. The most
common histologic subtype is nodular
sclerosis (70% to 80%). EBV infection
appears to play a role in AYA HL also. Other
infectious agents that have been associated
with HL include human herpesvirus 6 and
cytomegalovirus. There is clearly an associ-
ation between HL and alterations in immune
function. HL is seen more commonly in
patients with HIV disease, acquired immu-
nodeﬁciency (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell or
solid organ transplant), and autoimmune
disease.

Clinical presentation
The most common presentation of HL is
painless cervical or supraclavicular adeno-
pathy. The nodes are typically described as
rubbery or ﬁrm and nontender, although
may be sensitive to touch with rapid growth.
As the disease progresses, the nodes enlarge
and often aggregate into larger masses that
may become ﬁxed to the underlying tissue.
As children often have reactive or infectious
adenopathy, it is common to have received
treatment with several courses of antibiotics
before ultimately coming to biopsy. This is
more common with cervical than with
supraclavicular adenopathy, as the latter is
less frequently associated with infection or
inﬂammation and leads more quickly to
referral for possible malignancy. At least
two-thirds of patients with cervical or
supraclavicular adenopathy have mediasti-
nal involvement as well. This is frequently
asymptomatic, but may be associated with
cough (usually nonproductive), shortness of
breath, chest pain, or superior vena cava
syndrome. HL limited to infradiaphrag-
matic sites occurs in <5% of pediatric cases,
occurring most commonly in femoral,
superﬁcial iliac, or inguinal nodes.
Constitutional
symptoms
commonly
occur in patients with HL. They are caused
by cytokines produced by the HRS cells
within the tumor. Certain speciﬁc symp-
toms known as “B symptoms” have been
demonstrated to have a negative prognostic
signiﬁcance. These are unplanned weight
loss of >10% of body weight over the 6
months
preceding
diagnosis,
drenching
night sweats, or fever >38C for at least
three consecutive days. Other common con-
stitutional symptoms include generalized
pruritus and alcohol-induced pain.
Evaluation
1. A careful history and physical examina-
tion is imperative. The presence of B symp-
toms and any other unusual symptoms
should be identiﬁed, as patients with HL
can present with a variety of paraneoplastic
syndromes. All superﬁcial nodal groups
should be carefully examined, and the size
of any enlarged nodes and their character
should be documented.
2. The
laboratory
evaluation
should
include a complete blood count (CBC) with
differential, erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), complete
metabolic panel (including transaminases,
lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], and alkaline
phosphatase), serum copper, and serum
ferritin. One or more of these nonspeciﬁc
inﬂammatory markers may be elevated and
thus be useful initially to monitor response
to therapy and later to identify possible
recurrence.
3. A posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral
chest radiograph will identify bulky medi-
astinal disease, if present. This is important,
as it will inﬂuence the approach used to
obtain diagnostic material since patients
with bulky mediastinal disease are more
likely to experience complications with gen-
eral anesthesia. Other important imaging
studies include a CT scan of the neck, chest,
abdomen, and pelvis. The radiologist should
be reminded to include the Waldeyer ring in
the scan as this nodal area can be involved
with disease as well, especially in patients
with upper cervical node involvement. Oral
and intravenous contrast are required for
accurate identiﬁcation of intra-abdominal
adenopathy. Splenic involvement occurs in
30% to 40% of children at diagnosis.
Positron emission tomography (PET)-CT
is now commonly used at diagnosis as a very
sensitive tool for identifying sites of involve-
ment, when it is available. A gallium scan
should be performed if PET is not available.
4. Bone marrow involvement at initial pre-
sentation of pediatric HL is uncommon and
rarely occurs as an isolated site of extranodal
disease. However, it is seen more commonly
in patients with advanced stage (stage III
Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
167

or IV) disease or patients with B symptoms.
These patients should undergo bone mar-
row aspiration and biopsy from at least two
sites as part of their diagnostic evaluation.
All patients experiencing a recurrence of
their disease should have their bone marrow
examined.
5. Skeletal metastases are also rare at diag-
nosis, and bone scans have typically been
performed only in patients with bone pain,
unexplained elevations in the alkaline phos-
phatase, or other sites of extranodal disease.
PET-CT is a sensitive test for identifying
bone metastases and ultimately may replace
bone scanning all together. It is important
to remember that typical PET-CT imaging
stops at the knee; patients with distal lower
extremity pain will need to have the exam
carried further or have alternative imaging
of these areas.
Staging
The most widely used staging system for
pediatric HL is the Ann Arbor staging
system. This system divides lymph node
regions into nodal sites (e.g., neck, axilla,
and mediastinum), and the number of
involved sites then determines the stage.
Stage I disease involves only a single nodal
site, whereas stage II involves two or more
sites that lie together on one side of the
diaphragm. Stage III disease spans the dia-
phragm and stage IV is disseminated sys-
temic disease. Additional modiﬁers include
A or B, to describe the absence or presence
of systemic symptoms respectively, and E,
involvement of a single extranodal site that
is contiguous or proximal to a known nodal
site. The presence of bulky mediastinal
disease, described as greater than one-third
of
the
intrathoracic
diameter,
is
also
considered.
Treatment
The ﬁrst successful treatment strategy for
HL was based solely on the use of radiation
therapy (RT). While this approach was fairly
effective in curing the disease in low risk
patients, it resulted in unacceptable muscu-
loskeletal hypoplasia, cardiovascular and
pulmonary dysfunction, and the develop-
ment of subsequent secondary cancers. This
led to the development of combined modal-
ity therapy with the goal of improving
event-free and overall survival, especially
in higher risk patients, and decreasing the
long-term adverse effects of a radiation
only approach. Current research efforts in
HL treatment seek to maintain the excellent
survival rates presently achieved while con-
tinuing to decrease the frequency of later
adverse events. Today, patients with favor-
able disease presentations receive fewer
cycles of multiagent chemotherapy than
those with advanced and unfavorable clin-
ical presentations, either alone or combined
with low-dose, involved-ﬁeld radiation.
With current therapy, more than 80% of
children diagnosed with classical HL are
expected to be long-term disease-free survi-
vors, regardless of stage at diagnosis.
For treatment purposes, patients with
HL are typically divided into low, inter-
mediate, and high risk disease groups.
These groups are deﬁned by clinical stage,
presence of bulky disease, and presence
of B symptoms. The current approach to
therapy also includes the adaptation of
treatment based on the patient’s response
to early therapy, a so-called response-based
approach.
A variety of chemotherapy agents have
been shown to be effective in treating
HL. However, many early regimens such
as nitrogen mustard, vincristine, procar-
bazine, and prednisone (MOPP) resulted
in a very high rate of secondary malig-
nancy. Newer regimens have replaced
nitrogen mustard with cyclophosphamide
(COPP) and added other agents such as
doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and
etoposide.

Chapter 17

Classical HL—low risk disease
A number of studies have attempted to elim-
inate the use of RT completely in children
with low risk disease. This approach has
resulted in an increased rate of relapse in
patients not receiving RT, but many of these
patients were successfully salvaged with com-
bination chemotherapy and RT, thus long-
term survival was not affected. The most
recent Children’s Oncology Group study
treated patients with three cycles of doxoru-
bicin,vincristine,prednisone,andcyclophos-
phamide. Those having a complete response
by PET-CT or gallium scan were observed;
those having a partial response received
involved-ﬁeld radiation therapy (IFRT).
Classical HL—intermediate and
high risk disease
The majority of patients with intermediate
risk disease either have stage I/II disease with
one or more unfavorable features (B symp-
toms, lymph node bulk, hilar lymph node
involvement, involvement of three or more
lymph node regions, and extranodal exten-
sion to contiguous structures) or have
stage IIIA disease. High risk patients typically
include those with stage IIIB or IV disease.
Due to their more advanced stage, these
patients are treated with more aggressive
chemotherapy followed by IFRT. Current
therapy includes doxorubicin, bleomycin,
vincristine,
etoposide,
prednisone,
and
cyclophosphamide (ABVE-PC); slow respon-
ders may also receive additional chemother-
apy. The role of IFRT continues to be
investigated in the treatment of intermediate
risk patients, whereas high risk patients all
receive consolidation with IFRT.
Nodular lymphocyte
predominant HL
Several studies have demonstrated that
patients with NLPHL who present with
stage I disease and a single involved lymph
node can be successfully treated with surgery
alone. Stage I patients with more than one
involved node and stage II patients, which
represent more than 80% of patients with
NLPHL, are successfully treated with similar
protocols used in low risk classical HL
patients. Current studies are investigating
whether therapy can be reduced even further
in this group of very low risk patients.
Complications of treatment
Short term
The chemotherapy regimens used for the
treatment of HL are moderately emetogenic.
The nausea and vomiting can usually be
controlled with serotonin receptor antago-
nist antiemetics such as ondansetron. It is
not uncommon for patients to develop
anticipatory nausea and vomiting with
repeated cycles; this can be managed with
benzodiazepines such as lorazepam. Myelo-
suppression occurs very commonly, espe-
cially with the more intensive regimens, and
patients occasionally require hospitalization
for fever and neutropenia. Varicella zoster
occurs frequently both during and after ther-
apy, with a frequency that correlates with the
intensity of therapy. Appropriate preventive
and therapeutic steps should be taken
quickly in the event of exposure or infection
(see Chapter 25). Peripheral neuropathy can
result from vincristine and vinblastine ther-
apy, as can constipation. Pulmonary toxicity
can result from bleomycin, with develop-
ment of restrictive lung disease and reduc-
tions in diffusion capacity. Anthracycline-
induced cardiac toxicity is unusual with the
decreased doses used in current regimens,
but is more common when combined with
mediastinal RT.
Long term
The most signiﬁcant long-term complica-
tion of HL therapy is the development of a
second malignant neoplasm. The frequency
Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
169

has decreased with recent modiﬁcations in
chemotherapy and reductions in RT dose
and volume, but it remains a concern dur-
ing long-term follow-up. One speciﬁc issue
is the risk of development of early breast
cancer in female patients treated during
adolescence, especially those treated with
mediastinal
radiation.
Other
potential
long-term consequences of therapy include
sterility/infertility (most common in males
treated with alkylating agents), secondary
acute myelogenous leukemia (etoposide,
alkylating
agents),
pulmonary
ﬁbrosis
(bleomycin), and atherosclerotic heart dis-
ease (anthracyclines þ RT). Comprehen-
sive long-term follow-up is essential for
survivors of HL due to their increased risk
of late complications of therapy.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
NHL is about 1.5 times as common as
Hodgkin lymphoma. The incidence is low
in children less than 5 year of age, but from
that point it increases steadily with age
throughout life. In all age groups, there is
a signiﬁcant male predominance, particu-
larly among patients with Burkitt lym-
phoma (BL). During childhood, the disease
is more common among non-Hispanic
whites and Asians/Paciﬁc Islanders; after
age twenty, it occurs more commonly in
African-Americans. The incidence of differ-
ent histologic subtypes is very different in
children and adults.
Children with congenital or acquired
immune system dysfunction have a high risk
of developing lymphoma. Congenital condi-
tions include ataxia-telangiectasia, as well
as Bloom, Wiskott-Aldrich, and Chediak–
Higashi
syndromes; acquired conditions
include HIV and prolonged immunosup-
pressive therapy following bone marrow or
solid organ transplant. EBV is clearly asso-
ciated with BL in underdeveloped countries,
and has been linked to several subtypes of
NHL in the developed world. Other identi-
ﬁed risk factors include Helicobacter pylori
infection, tobacco exposure, and chemical or
other environmental exposures. It is likely
that there is not a single etiology responsible
for the development of all cases of NHL.
The histologic classiﬁcation of NHL
has changed frequently over time and has
become more precise as our understand-
ing of the development of lymphoma has
improved
and
better
diagnostic
tools
(immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, molec-
ular biology, and gene proﬁling) have been
developed. The current World Health Orga-
nization classiﬁcation is now widely used.
There are four major histologic subtypes of
NHL that occur commonly in children (in
order of frequency): diffuse, large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL), lymphoblastic lym-
phoma (LL), BL, and anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (ALCL).
DLBCL and ALCL tend to be heteroge-
neous immunologically. Most are B-cell
derived, although some are T-cell derived
or arise from the macrophage–histiocyte
lineage. Burkitt and Burkitt-like subtypes
are virtually all B-cell tumors, distinguished
only by the amount of cellular heterogene-
ity. The most common site of occurrence of
LL is the mediastinum, and these tumors are
virtually all of T-cell origin. Less commonly
LL occurs in bone or subcutaneously; these
tumors are typically of B-cell origin. All of
these subtypes can invade the bone marrow
and undergo leukemic transformation.
Clinical presentation
The clinical presentation of NHL varies and
depends on the primary site of disease,
histologic subtype, and extent of disease.
NHL can arise anywhere in the body, but
occurs most frequently in the lymph nodes,
thymus, Waldeyer’s ring, Peyer’s patches,
and bone marrow. In the United States,
BL typically
presents
in
the
intestine,
170
Chapter 17

resulting in obstruction. These children
usually present with nausea, vomiting, and
abdominal distention. It is not unusual for
NHL to be confused with a surgical abdo-
men, such as appendicitis. BL also presents
in Waldeyer’s ring or in the facial bones.
T-cell LL most commonly arises from the
thymus; these children typically present
with respiratory symptoms, cervical or
supraclavicular adenopathy, or superior
vena cava syndrome. Children may have
very limited disease affecting the tonsils,
nasopharynx, or Waldeyer’s ring, and the
diagnosis has resulted from the pathologic
examination following a tonsillectomy and
adenoidectomy. Lymphomas arising in less
common sites such as superﬁcial lymph
nodes, bone, skin, thyroid, orbit, eyelid,
kidney, and the epidural space can be
caused by any subtype of lymphoma.
Diagnostic evaluation
It is not unusual to begin with a surgical
procedure for excision or biopsy of a
node or laparotomy in the case of an acute
abdominal presentation. Many times the
diagnosis is not suspected prior to these
procedures. In any event, histologic conﬁr-
mation is necessary for diagnosis. The diag-
nosis of NHL is usually made using biopsy
material but it can also be conﬁrmed by
cytological examination of effusion ﬂuids or
review of bone marrow smears. In this way,
major surgical procedures can often be
avoided in patients presenting with BL and
LL, who are frequently unstable at presen-
tation. If possible, sufﬁcient material should
be obtained for immunologic and cyto-
genetic or molecular biology studies. Many
therapeutic trials now have requirements for
submission of material for central pathology
review or biology studies; these require-
ments should be taken into consideration
when planning a diagnostic procedure.
The laboratory studies that should be
obtained include:
* A CBC with differential and review of the
peripheral smear to assess for possible bone
marrow involvement or leukemia.
* Serum chemistries to include liver trans-
aminases, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,
LDH, uric acid, electrolytes, calcium, and
phosphorus. Lymphomas, particularly LL
and BL, can present with overt tumor lysis
syndrome (TLS) and/or renal dysfunction.
The LDH can be useful prognostically, espe-
cially in
patients with advanced stage
disease.
* Bilateral bone marrow aspirations and
biopsies as the child may actually have leu-
kemia, deﬁned as a marrow with >25%
replacement by lymphoblasts.
* A lumbar puncture to assess the cerebro-
spinal ﬂuid for involvement by NHL.
Radiologic procedures that should be per-
formed will vary depending on the location
of the mass and associated symptoms, but
should include:
* A prompt PA and lateral chest radiograph
to evaluate for mediastinal involvement.
* CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and
pelvis if the patient is sufﬁciently stable.
* MRI of the brain for patients with immu-
nodeﬁciency-related NHL as these patients
more commonly present with parenchymal
brain disease.
* MRI of the brain and spine for patients
with focal neurologic symptoms.
* PET-CT to include all identiﬁed sites of
disease. Ideally, this should be performed
following the diagnostic procedure, as these
patients frequently have residual abnormal-
ities in their surgical bed on plain CT that
are discovered on PET-CT to not represent
active disease.
Staging
NHL is staged using the St. Jude (Murphy)
staging
system
that

presented
in
Table 17.1.
Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
171

Treatment
Therapy is based on clinical staging, local-
ized versus disseminated disease, and histo-
logic subtype. In general, children with
localized NHL have an excellent prognosis,
with a 90% long-term survival. Therapy
may begin with surgical resection in the
case of primary gastrointestinal tumors that
are amenable to complete resection, but this
is not a necessary part of therapy for treat-
ment of other sites (unless a life-threatening
complication is present).
These tumors are exquisitely sensitive to
chemotherapy, and multidrug regimens,
similar to those used for leukemia, are fre-
quently
recommended.
Radiotherapy
is
generally reserved for some patients with
CNSþ lymphoblastic lymphoma, relapsed
patients, or oncologic emergencies due to
tumor compression. In general, B-cell lym-
phomas require intensive short-course ther-
apy ranging from 2 to 8 months in duration
depending on initial tumor burden. Ritux-
imab is now frequently added to treatment
regimens for patients with B-cell lym-
phoma, although clear evidence that it sig-
niﬁcantly improves pediatric outcomes is
lacking. Patients with LL have superior out-
comes with longer acute lymphoblastic
leukemia-type therapy. CNS prophylaxis
in either type is indicated in advanced stages
and in those patients with parameningeal or
overt CNS disease at diagnosis. The optimal
treatment of ALCL is not yet well deﬁned.
Patients with stage I and II disease do well
with brief, multiagent intensive chemother-
apy and CNS prophylaxis. Patients with
advanced stage disease who express the
fusion protein generated by the anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene have superior
outcomes compared to patients who are
ALK negative. The latter patients typically
require a more intensive, anthracycline-
containing regimen.
With the initiation of therapy, the
child must be closely monitored for the
development of TLS and resultant meta-
bolic
abnormalities.

ceeding to the induction phase with insti-

Wilms Tumor
Wilms tumor is the second most common
retroperitoneal tumor in children, account-
ing for approximately 6% of childhood
malignancies. A tumor of the developing
kidney, it typically occurs in young children
between the ages of 1 and 5 years, with equal
incidence among boys and girls (though
interestingly occurs at earlier ages in boys).
Most cases of Wilms tumor are sporadic,
with approximately 1% being familial and
2% to 4% associated with rare congenital
syndromes. Familial cases are more likely to
present with bilateral tumors and occur at a
younger age.
Genetics
Congenital anomalies occur in 12% to 15%
of cases, the most common being hemihy-
pertrophy, aniridia, and genitourinary tract
(GU) anomalies such as cryptorchidism,
hypospadias, horseshoe kidney, ureteral
duplication, and polycystic kidney. Most
children with Wilms tumor have a normal
karyotype; however, a chromosomal dele-
tion in the short arm of chromosome 11
(11p13 deletion) is seen in association with
congenital aniridia. The Wilms tumor 1
(WT1) gene encodes a transcription factor
important in normal kidney development.
Mutations within the WT1 gene have been
identiﬁed in two syndromes associated with
Wilms tumor: WAGR syndrome (Wilms
tumor, Aniridia, GU anomalies, and mental
Retardation) and Denys–Drash syndrome
(Wilms tumor, nephropathy, and GU
anomalies including pseudohermaphrodit-
ism).
Beckwith–Wiedemann
syndrome
(macroglossia, omphalocele,
viscerome-
galy, with or without hemihypertrophy)
is associated with imprinting defects at
several genes at chromosome 11p15.5, a
locus referred to as the WT2 gene. Patients
with this syndrome have a genetic predis-
position to develop Wilms tumor, with an
incidence as high as 5% to 10%.
Clinical presentation
Most children with Wilms tumor are gen-
erally in good health at presentation and
come to medical attention due to abdom-
inal enlargement or when a family member
has felt a mass. Associated signs and symp-
toms include abdominal pain, malaise,
fever,
hypertension,
and
microscopic
hematuria. Bleeding within the tumor may
occur and result in anemia, pallor, and
fatigue. Tumor thrombus may extend into
the vena cava, causing partial obstruction,
hypertension, and distention of abdominal
veins. Polycythemia may be seen in Wilms

tumor and may or may not be related to
elevated erythropoietin levels. Acquired
von Willebrand disease with reduced von
Willebrand factor (VWF), factor VIII coag-
ulant, and ristocetin cofactor levels has
been reported in approximately 8% of
patients
newly
diagnosed
with
Wilms
tumor and typically resolves with therapy
initiation. Its occurrence in Wilms tumor is
thought secondary to binding of VWF to
the tumor with subsequent degradation as
well as hyaluronic acid secretion by nephro-
blastoma cells leading to decreased efﬁcacy
of VWF.
Evaluation of suspected Wilms
tumor
* History: include family history of malig-
nancies, congenital anomalies, or syndromes
* Physical examination: assess gently for
abdominal/ﬂank mass (usually distinct and
not crossing the midline), congenital anom-
alies (hemihypertrophy, GU malformations,
aniridia), hypertension, abdominal venous
distention, and liver enlargement
* Laboratory
studies:
urinalysis
with
microscopic evaluation,
complete blood
count (polycythemia and anemia), serum
chemistries
(hypercalcemia
in
rhabdoid
tumor or congenital mesoblastic nephroma),
and coagulation studies including von Will-
ebrand panel
* Diagnostic imaging studies:
* Doppler abdominal ultrasound to eval-
uate the tumor,
possible vena cava
involvement, blood ﬂow, and contralat-
eral kidney
* Abdominal CT or MRI with special
attention to evidence of bilateral involve-
ment, vessel involvement or extension to
the inferior vena cava (IVC), lymph node
involvement, and liver metastases
* ChestradiographyandchestCTtoassess
for lung metastases (most common site)
* Bone scan to assess for metastases if the
tumor is a clear cell sarcoma and for all
patients with Wilms tumor with lung or
liver
metastatic
disease
and
bony
symptoms
* MRI of the brain for metastases if the
tumor is a rhabdoid tumor or clear cell
sarcoma
* Echocardiogram for detecting tumor
extension from the IVC to the right
atrium and also indicated in the child
receiving anthracycline chemotherapy
Pathologic diagnosis
Children with suspected Wilms tumor
should have an immediate consultation
with a pediatric surgeon. Surgical removal
of the involved kidney and intact tumor is
indicated at diagnosis if possible. Cases
with tumor in the renal pelvis and IVC
require a detailed imaging assessment to
guide the surgeon. In some cases, complete
removal of the primary tumor at diagnosis
may not be possible. In these cases, open
biopsy is indicated for pathologic conﬁr-
mation and determination of histology.
Tumor pathology is critical in diagnosis
as well as helping to determine the staging
and
therefore
subsequent
treatment.
Classic Wilms tumor presents with three
types of nephroblastoma tissue elements:
blastema, stroma (mesenchyme), and epi-
thelium. Additional assessment includes
determination of histology as either favor-
able (well-differentiated components) or
unfavorable (presence of anaplasia with
poor differentiation and a worse prognosis).
Other malignant tumors of the kidney need
to be considered and ruled out including
rhabdoid tumor of the kidney, clear cell
sarcoma of the kidney, and renal cell carci-
noma. Chromosome analysis is performed
on the tumor and may prove to be especially
useful in association with congenital anom-
alies and familial cases. Loss of heterozygos-
ity (LOH) of chromosomes 1p and 16q has
also recently been conﬁrmed to be a nega-
tive prognostic indicator.
Wilms Tumor
175

Staging
Staging is done postoperatively and is deter-
mined based on the extent of disease, ability
to perform a total resection, and the path-
ologic ﬁndings. Patients unable to undergo
a radical nephrectomy at diagnosis due to
excessive risk receive preliminary staging
and
preoperative
chemotherapy
with
delayed resection. A careful pathologic eval-
uation at the time of excision should be
performed regardless of whether this occurs
at diagnosis or later following preoperative
chemotherapy, as the histology may be dif-
ferent than that seen on initial biopsy. This
evaluation includes identifying tumor his-
tology and looking for extension of disease
outside the kidney, including penetrance of
the tumor through the renal capsule into the
renal pelvis and vessels and presence of
nodal involvement.
Clinicopathologic staging is as follows:
* Stage I: tumor limited to the kidney and
completed excised without tumor rupture
or biopsy prior to resection
* Stage II: tumor extends through the renal
capsule, has been biopsied, or ruptured
prior to excision with spillage conﬁned to
the ﬂank; tumor may involve the perirenal
soft tissue and/or inﬁltrate vessels outside
the kidney but is completely excised
* Stage III: residual nonhematogenous dis-
semination of tumor conﬁned to the abdo-
men; tumor may extend beyond surgical
margin at resection, may involve local
lymph nodes, or have tumor spillage with
peritoneal implants
* Stage IV: hematogenous dissemination
of tumor to lungs, liver, bone, brain, or
distant lymph nodes
* Stage V: bilateral renal involvement
Patients with bilateral involvement of tumor
(stage V) should have each side indepen-
dently staged with treatment based on the
side with the highest stage.
Treatment
The prognosis of Wilms tumor is excellent,
with more than 85% of children being cured
of their disease. Histology is more prognos-
tic for outcome than staging; for example,
patients with stage IV disease but with
favorable histology still have a 4-year sur-
vival of more than 85%, compared to chil-
dren with diffuse anaplasia and advanced
disease who have very poor outcomes. Chil-
dren with stage I and II favorable histology
tumors have an event-free survival rate
exceeding 95%.
Many tumors are low stage at presenta-
tion and are able to be fully resected.
Additionally, these tumors are very sensitive
to chemotherapy and radiation. Based on
the exceedingly good outcomes, contempo-
rary studies have looked to decrease therapy
in the lower risk stratum. This includes the
elimination of chemotherapy in patients
younger than 2 years with stage I disease
and tumor mass of <550 g without LOH at
1p and 16q. For patients receiving chemo-
therapy, the backbone of therapy is based on
previous studies by the National Wilms
Tumor Study Group and includes vincris-
tine,
doxorubicin,
and
dactinomycin.
Higher stage patients may require radiation
therapy in addition to this chemotherapeu-
tic backbone. Patients with stage IV disease
or patients with advanced stage and LOH at
1p and 16q receive more aggressive therapy
with the addition of cyclophosphamide and
etoposide. In general, patients with pulmo-
nary metastasis will require lung irradiation
although newer protocols are studying
whether this can be eliminated in patients
with a rapid response to chemotherapy and
no additional risk factors. Finally, patients
with higher stage anaplastic disease as well
as patients with rhabdoid tumor of the
kidney or metastatic clear cell sarcoma
receive a similar regimen with the addition
of carboplatin.
176
Chapter 18

Relapse is uncommon in Wilms tumor;
patients may be salvaged with aggressive
multiagent chemotherapy, radiation if pre-
viously not given, and possibly may beneﬁt
from high-dose chemotherapy with autol-
ogous stem cell rescue. As survival is excel-
lent, much attention has focused on late
effects related to therapy and limiting
potential toxicities. Patients are at risk for
hypertension and renal insufﬁciency, as
most children will have a solitary remaining
kidney.
Patients
with
bilateral
disease,
partial resection, and radiation exposure are
particularly at risk for developing protein-
uria and renal compromise in addition to
hypertension. Cardiac complications may
be seen in those patients who receive anthra-
cyclines and lung irradiation. Additionally,
patients
with
right-sided
tumors
who
receive ﬂank irradiation and those receiving
whole
abdomen
irradiation
have
an
increased risk of developing a secondary
liver cancer. These potential issues must all
be taken into account in the patient’s long-
term follow-up plan.

Neuroblastoma
Neuroblastoma is a neoplasm of the sym-
pathetic nervous system and the most com-
mon solid tumor of early childhood, with a
peak incidence around 2 years of age. Neu-
roblastoma is a disease of developing neural
crest tissue and has an extremely heteroge-
neous prognosis based on multiple factors
such as the age of the patient, differentiation
and biology of the tumor, and extent of
disease spread. Screening in the Japanese
infant population found a high incidence
of neuroblastoma, although the majority of
these cases matured or involuted spontane-
ously, again implying the heterogeneous
prognosis based on patient age. Although
survival
rates
for
neuroblastoma
have
improved over the last 30 years, the majority
of these gains have been observed in patients
with lower risk disease. Recent break-
throughs hold promise to increase survival
in those with high risk disease as well.
Familial cases of neuroblastoma are
quite rare. However, genetic risk factors for
neuroblastoma have been identiﬁed includ-
ing the anaplastic lymphoma kinase 1 and
PHOX2B homeobox genes. Patients with
Hirschsprung’s disease, neuroﬁbromatosis
type I, and congenital hypoventilation syn-
drome may have genetic alterations in
PHOX2B and an increased risk of develop-
ing neuroblastoma, although clear genetic
links have not as yet been identiﬁed. More
commonly, ampliﬁcation of the oncogene
N-myc in tumor tissue has been found to
have a profound negative impact on prog-
nosis. Similarly, a near diploid (low DNA
index, DNA index ¼ 1) chromosome num-
ber in the tumor has also been found to be a
negative prognostic indicator as compared
to patients with a DNA index >1. Based on
these factors, in addition to age, stage, and
histology (favorable or unfavorable based
on mitosis-karyorrhexis index and maturity
of the tumor), a complicated risk-stratiﬁed
treatment regimen has been created.
Clinical presentation
As neuroblastoma originates from primor-
dial neural crest cells that normally give rise
to the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic
ganglia, tumors present in the abdomen and
along the sympathetic neural pathway. The
most common presentation is an abdomi-
nal mass with primary tumor in the adrenal
gland, often with metastatic disease via lym-
phatic and hematogenous spread. Tumors
are often seen along the paraspinal ganglion
and may be found in the neck, thorax, and
pelvis. Infants are more likely to have tho-
racic and cervical tumors. Common sites of
metastasis are the lymph nodes, bone mar-
row, bone, liver, and skin.

The signs and symptoms at presentation
depend on the site of the tumor, size, and
the degree of spread. Patients with locore-
gional disease may be relatively asymptom-
atic, whereas patients with widely metastatic
disease are often ill-appearing with fever,
pain, weight loss, and irritability. Abdomi-
nal tumors are usually palpable, hard, ﬁxed
masses. The liver may be enlarged, leading
to respiratory compromise, especially in the
infant. There may be evidence of anemia
(pallor, weakness, and fatigue), coagulopa-
thy (bruising and bleeding), and bone pain
or limping with bone or bone marrow
involvement. Thoracic masses are usually
picked up in the posterior mediastinum
incidentally by imaging studies done for
other reasons. Cervical masses may initially
be treated as cervical adenopathy related to
infection. The presence of Horner’s syn-
drome (miosis [contracted pupil], ptosis,
enophthalmos
[posterior
eye
displace-
ment], and anhidrosis) or heterochromia
iridis should prompt an evaluation for cer-
vicothoracic neuroblastoma. Pelvic masses
may cause bowel or bladder symptoms and
tumors along the sympathetic ganglia may
cause spinal cord compression. Skin lesions
tend to be limited to infants and appear as
bluish, nontender subcutaneous nodules.
Sphenoid or retro-orbital bone involvement
may occur and appear clinically as “raccoon
eyes” secondary to periorbital hemorrhage.
In addition to Horner’s syndrome, the
clinician should be aware of potential para-
neoplastic syndromes with neuroblastoma.
One unusual presentation is opsoclonus-
myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS), also
referred to as “dancing eyes/dancing feet.”
These children have cerebellar and truncal
ataxia as well as myoclonus (muscle jerks)
and opsoclonus (rapid, involuntary, unco-
ordinated eye movements). Developmental
delay, language deﬁcits, and behavioral
abnormalities (e.g., irritability) may also
be present. Children with OMAS should
be carefully evaluated for the presence of
an occult neuroblastoma. Children with
OMAS tend to have a low-stage, highly
curable neuroblastoma. Unfortunately, this
cure often has little impact on the OMAS,
and these children are frequently left with
severe, chronic neurologic deﬁcits. The
pathophysiology of this syndrome is not
well deﬁned but is likely due to formation
of an antibody directed against the neuro-
blastoma cells also targeting cerebellar neu-
rons. In addition to treatment of the neu-
roblastoma, these children may beneﬁt
from
immunosuppressive
therapy
with
agents such as dexamethasone, cyclophos-
phamide, intravenous immune globulin
(IVIG), and adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH). Neuroblastoma patients may also
present with hypersecretory diarrhea sec-
ondary to hypersecretion of vasoactive
intestinal peptide (VIP) from the neuro-
blastoma cells. In most cases, treatment of
the underlying disease will eliminate the
VIP hypersecretion.
Diagnostic evaluation
History
Assess for constitutional symptoms, abdom-
inal pain, bowel or bladder control problems,
bleeding, bone pain, and limping.
Physical examination
Assess vital signs (fever and hypertension)
and evaluate for abdominal mass, spinal
cord compression, unusual signs/symptoms
associated with neuroblastoma (hetero-
chromia,
raccoon
eyes,
Horner’s
syn-
drome), subcutaneous nodules in infants,
enlarged liver or lymph nodes, and evidence
of anemia or coagulopathy.
Laboratory studies
Obtain complete blood count with differ-
ential, serum chemistries (liver function
Neuroblastoma

studies and lactate dehydrogenase), ferritin
(may be a tumor marker and elevated in
neuroblastoma, though also an acute-phase
reactant), and urine for catecholamines
including homovanillic acid (HVA) and
vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). These urine
metabolites are elevated in more than 90%
of children with neuroblastoma, especially
in the higher stages of disease. In patients
with clinical suspicion for neuroblastoma
and negative urine markers, urine dopa-
mine can be measured in addition to
24-hour urine collections for HVA and
VMA. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE), a
serum marker speciﬁc to the sympathetic
nervous system, is relatively speciﬁc to neu-
roblastoma although it can be elevated after
brain injury and seizures.
Diagnostic studies
Patients with conﬁrmed neuroblastoma
should have bilateral bone marrow aspira-
tion and biopsy performed to assess for
bone marrow involvement. Special stains
(S100, synaptophysin, and NSE) are used
to differentiate this tumor from other small,
round blue cell tumors of childhood such as
rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, lym-
phoma, and primitive neuroectodermal
tumor. Lumbar puncture should be avoided
as this procedure may increase the incidence
of central nervous system metastases.
Imaging studies should include:
* CT or MRI of the primary site (MRI is
preferred due to the radiation exposure
associated with repeated CT imaging). Cal-
ciﬁcations and hemorrhage are commonly
seen, especially in large abdominal masses.
The tumors tend to be large and displace
adjacent organs; however, the tumor can
wrap around major structures, causing
obstruction and dysfunction. If there is
suspicion
of
paraspinal
or
intraspinal
involvement, MRI and plain ﬁlms of the
spine should be done.
* Bone scan (technetium-99m).
* MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan
(123I-MIBG scan preferred over 131I-MIBG
due to decreased risk to thyroid function).
Prior to MIBG scanning, the patient must
receive thyroid protection with potassium
iodide (SSKI) drops and should have
baseline
thyroid
function
(FT4/TSH)
checked. MIBG, a functional analog of
norepinephrine, is taken up by sympathetic
neurons and is a sensitive test for neuro-
blastoma
cells.
It
is
also
positive
in
pheochromocytoma.
* Due to the high radiation doses with both
bone scan and MIBG scanning, patients can
be followed solely with MIBG if results of
baseline imaging are concordant.
Localized
tumors
should
be
surgically
removed if it deemed safe and feasible.
Many tumors are initially unresectable.
These tumors should be surgically biopsied,
with sampling of local lymph nodes. Diag-
nosis is generally established by pathologic
assessment of the resected or biopsied mass
and can be conﬁrmed by diagnostic features
such as bone marrow involvement with
appropriate
immunohistochemical
mar-
kers, MIBG avidity, and positive urine cate-
cholamines and serum NSE.
Staging
The International Neuroblastoma Staging
System as shown in Table 19.1 was most
recently revised in 1993 and provides a basic
prognostic model that has been more
recently complemented by biologic and
pathologic assessments including N-myc
amplication, DNA ploidy, and histology.
A new risk-stratiﬁed staging system by the
International Neuroblastoma Risk Group is
currently being prospectively evaluated in
clinical trials.

Treatment
Risk stratiﬁcation divides patients into mul-
tiple potential treatment categories that are
continually evaluated through clinical stud-
ies. For simplicity, we divide treatment
strategies into three main groups: (1) obser-
vation, (2) chemotherapy, and (3) high-dose
chemotherapy with autologous stem cell res-
cue and adjuvant therapy with immunomo-
dulators (described below).

Stage

patients
(after

resection)
2. Stage IIA/B patients with >60% tumor

pliﬁcation, favorable histology, and DNA
ploidy >1
Chemotherapy

ﬁcation, not including patients >12 months
of age with unfavorable histology and/or
DNA ploidy ¼ 1 and all patients >18
months of age
4. Stage IVS patients with N-myc nonam-
pliﬁcation who have unfavorable histology
and/or DNA ploidy ¼ 1
High-dose chemotherapy with
autologous transplant
* Stage III, IV, and IVS patients not
included above and all patients >12 years
of age with stage III or greater disease
As mentioned, clinical studies are ongoing
to reﬁne treatment groups. Speciﬁcally,
attempts are being made to reduce treat-
ment in some of the lower risk subgroups
that still require therapy but have an excel-
lent overall prognosis (>90% survival).
Novel therapeutic agents are being utilized
in addition to the current backbone of
therapy that includes drugs such as carbo-
platin,
cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin,
and etoposide. The majority of work is
centered on high risk patients who continue
to have an extremely poor prognosis (30%
to 40% survival). Multiple efforts are cur-
rently being evaluated in clinical trials
including

Sarcomas of the Soft
Tissues and Bone
Sarcomas comprise a heterogeneous group
of malignant tumors that arise in the soft
tissues or bone. Soft tissue sarcomas (STS)
are derived from primitive mesenchymal
cells such as muscle, connective tissue (ten-
dons and synovial tissue), supportive tissue
(fat and nerves), and vascular tissue (lymph
and blood vessels). Rhabdomyosarcoma
(RMS) is the most common STS in younger
children, comprising more than half of these
tumors in children up to 9 years of age.
Other nonrhabdomyomatous soft tissue
sarcomas (NRSTS) include synovial sar-
coma, liposarcoma, ﬁbrosarcoma, alveolar
soft part sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.
STS account for approximately 6% of can-
cer cases in those less than 19 years of age
(annual incidence 11 cases per million in the
United States). The relative incidence of
various STS varies by age, gender, and race.
For instance, NRSTS such as ﬁbrosarcoma
and malignant hemangiopericytoma are
more common in infants (less than 1 year
of age). NRSTS also account for the major-
ity of STS in patients over 10 years of age.
The most common bone sarcomas in
children are osteosarcoma and Ewing sar-
coma (annual incidence 8.7 per million).
Approximately two-thirds of cases are oste-
osarcoma and one-third Ewing sarcoma.
Osteosarcoma is believed to arise from
osteoblasts and has a bimodal age distribu-
tion with an initial peak in the second
decade of life and a second peak in older
adulthood. Ewing sarcoma is thought to
derive from neural crest and is also most
frequently diagnosed in the second decade
of life.
Genetics
The majority of soft tissue and bone sarco-
mas develop without a predisposing genetic
risk factor, although there have been mul-
tiple reported associations: RMS in patients
with neuroﬁbromatosis type 1, Beckwith-
Wiedemann syndrome, Costello syndrome,
Li-Fraumeni familial cancer syndrome, and
cardio-facial-cutaneous syndrome. There
has also been an association with maternal
use of marijuana and cocaine as well as ﬁrst-
trimester exposure to radiation, including
diagnostic
radiographs.
Children
with
hereditary retinoblastoma (who harbor the
Rb germ line mutation) are at increased risk
of
developing
sarcoma.
Alveolar
RMS
(ARMS) has a characteristic translocation
of the FKHR gene at 13q14 with PAX3 at
2q35 or less commonly PAX7 at 1p36, lead-
ing to a fusion transcription factor that is

thought to inappropriately activate gene
transcription. Embryonal RMS (ERMS) dis-
plays a loss of heterozygosity in the short
arm of chromosome 11, especially at 11p15.
The allelic loss of 11p15 has also been seen in
translocation negative, histologic ARMS. In
general, patients with ERMS have a better
prognosis than patients with ARMS, in large
part due to the increased risk of metastatic
disease at presentation with ARMS. DNA
content or ploidy has also been implicated
in prognosis with hyperdiploid tumors
(51 chromosomes) having a better out-
come. NRSTS can occur in sites of prior
radiation, and children with human immu-
nodeﬁciency virus may develop leiomyosar-
coma (often in association with Epstein–
Barr virus). Interestingly, family members
of children affected with Ewing sarcoma
family of tumors (ESFT; also referred to
as primitive neuroectodermal tumors) have
an increased risk of neuroectodermal and
stomach malignancies. The translocation
t(11;22)(q24;q12) occurs in greater than
95% of ESFT and some consider this ﬁnding
to be pathognomonic and sufﬁcient to con-
ﬁrm the diagnosis. This translocation results
in the EWS–FLI1 fusion transcript that acts
as an aberrant transcription factor altering
tumor suppressor gene pathways.
Osteosarcoma is characterized by com-
plex unbalanced karyotypes with alterations
in the Rb and p53 tumor suppressor path-
ways, linking this tumor to retinoblastoma
and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, respectively.
Osteosarcoma has long been thought to
be associated with adolescent growth spurts
and the higher incidence in large dog breeds
and taller people support this correlation.
Girls have a peak incidence younger than
boys (12 vs. 16 years) correlating with the
different average age for pubertal develop-
ment. Well-documented risk factors include
radiation exposure, Paget’s disease, and
other disorders associated with increased
bone turnover. Soft tissue and bone sarco-
mas also occur as secondary malignancies.
Soft tissue sarcoma
Clinical presentation
STS may occur anywhere in the body and
are not limited to muscle or connective
tissues. The most common sites for RMS
are head and neck (35%), genitourinary
system
(26%),
and
extremities
(20%).
Younger children less than 10 years of age
tend to develop ERMS in head and neck or
genitourinary locations, whereas adoles-
cents tend to develop extremity, truncal,
or paratesticular ARMS. The majority of
RMS are localized, and, of the 15% to
20% of cases with metastatic disease at
presentation, most involve the lungs, bone
marrow, lymph nodes, or bone.
As RMS can arise from anywhere in the
body, the presenting symptoms are highly
variable. Typically, RMS presents as a pain-
less growing mass. Depending on location,
adjacent structures may be compressed and
lead to symptoms such as airway obstruc-
tion or cranial nerve ﬁndings with nasopha-
ryngeal
tumors,
proptosis
with
orbital
tumors, and urinary obstruction with blad-
der or prostate tumors.
Diagnostic evaluation
Patients presenting with an enlarging mass
suspected to be malignancy should have an
open surgical biopsy for conﬁrmation of
diagnosis.
Sufﬁcient
tissue
should
be
obtained for pathologic evaluation and
staining in addition to cytogenetic and
molecular biologic studies. Patients may
be eligible to participate in a clinical ther-
apeutic or biologic trial that also mandates
submission of tissue. A complete assessment
of extent of disease with meticulous atten-
tion
to
sites
of
metastatic
disease
is
184
Chapter 20

mandated prior to initiating deﬁnitive ther-
apy. Some protocols also mandate biopsy of
regional nodes or a sentinel node in patients
with primary extremity tumors. These eva-
luations include:
* Complete history and physical examina-
tion with careful assessment of the mass,
adjacent structures, and regional lymph
nodes.
* Laboratory studies including complete
blood count, complete metabolic panel with
renal and liver function studies, coagulation
testing, and urinalysis.
* Radiographic studies including mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or
computed tomography (CT) scan of the
primary lesion, depending on the location.
Chest CT and radioisotope bone scan
should also be conducted to evaluate for
potential lung metastases and bone metas-
tases, respectively. Site-dependent studies
may include: brain MRI for parameningeal
head and neck tumors, ultrasound and
cystourethroscopy in bladder or prostate
tumors, and spine MRI in patients with
evidence of medullary compression. Fluo-
rine-18-ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emis-
sion tomography (FDG-PET) imaging may
be helpful to determine initial extent of
disease and to monitor response to therapy.
* Bilateral bone marrow aspirate and
biopsy should be performed, especially in
patients with metastatic disease or alveolar
histologic subtype of RMS.
* Lumbar puncture in patients with para-
meningeal head and neck primary lesions.
Staging and classiﬁcation
RMS are stratiﬁed into groups based on
prognostic factors. The principal determi-
nants of prognosis are primary site, tumor
size, histologic subtype, degree of regional
spread and nodal involvement, distant met-
astatic disease, and extent of prechemother-
apy tumor resection. Risk stratiﬁcation is
essential to tailoring of therapy to maximize
outcome. A unique aspect of the RMS stag-
ing is the postoperative clinical grouping
system that is based on extent of surgical
resection and results of the lymph node
evaluation. Risk group classiﬁcation is then
based on pretreatment stage, postoperative
clinical group, and histology. Favorable sites
include the orbit, genitourinary (nonbladder
nonprostate), and nonparameningeal head
and neck locations. Unfavorable sites are
bladder/prostate, extremity, cranial parame-
ningeal, trunk, and retroperitoneum.
Low risk group: patients with nonmeta-
static favorable site ERMS (stage I, regard-
less of degree of initial resection) and
completely resected (groups I and II) non-
metastatic unfavorable site ERMS
Intermediate risk group: patients with
any nonmetastatic ARMS and all ERMS
with unfavorable sites (stages 2 or 3) that
have been incompletely resected (group III)
High risk group: patients with meta-
static tumors, both ARMS and ERMS
NRSTS are generally staged using the
same criteria above. The major determi-
nants of outcome include tumor grade, size,
extent of initial resection, and presence of
metastatic disease. Extent of resection is
strongly correlated with treatment stratiﬁ-
cation and prognosis.
Pathologic diagnosis and
treatment
RMS is classiﬁed pathologically as embryo-
nal (ERMS) with botryoid and spindle cell
variants or alveolar (ARMS). Investigation
for particular translocations (see Genetics
section) should be done to assist with deﬁn-
itive tissue diagnosis in combination with
histochemical studies.
A multidisciplinary approach to the
treatment of STS is crucial. Basic principles
of therapy include systemic treatment of
Sarcomas of the Soft Tissues and Bone
185

micrometastatic disease with adjuvant che-
motherapy and aggressive local control with
deﬁnitive surgery and addition of radiation
as necessary.
Local control is achieved with either
complete surgical resection (with negative
margins) or surgery and radiation (if micro-
scopic or gross residual disease remains after
surgical intervention). Primary re-excision
may be indicated prior to initiation of che-
motherapy in certain situations such as: if
the diagnosis was not suspected and only a
biopsy was performed; gross or microscopic
residual disease is amenable to wide exci-
sion; or if there is uncertainty about residual
disease or margins. Aggressive surgical
debulking that would result in signiﬁcant
loss of function is not recommended. RMS
often arise in sites in which complete or
wide resection is not feasible (e.g., orbit,
most
genitourinary
and
parameningeal
sites). STS are moderately sensitive to radi-
ation therapy, and this treatment modality
is critical for tumors that cannot be fully
excised surgically with negative margins.
Radiation is typically delayed until the com-
pletion of 10 to 20 weeks of systemic che-
motherapy, but may be indicated earlier in
patients with intracranial primary tumors
or in those with compromise of function
that may be debilitating or life threatening.
Current studies are evaluating the optimal
timing of irradiation.
Chemotherapy provides the backbone
of treatment for patients with RMS and
is initiated following the initial surgical
procedure. After deﬁnitive local control
surgery and/or radiation, chemotherapy
continues due to the risk of microscopic
residual or metastatic disease. The most
active drugs in the treatment of RMS are
vincristine,
dactinomycin,
and
cyclo-
phosphamide (VAC), doxorubicin, and
ifosfamide and etoposide (IE). VAC is
considered the standard of therapy in all
risk groups.
Recent trials have not been able to show
improvement in survival in patients with
metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma and new
drug therapies are being investigated. Such
therapies include irinotecan, temozolomide,
bevacizumab
(anti-vascular
endothelial
growth factor monoclonal antibody), tem-
sirolimus (mTOR inhibitor), vinorelbine
(vinca alkaloid), and cixutumumab (mono-
clonal antibody to the insulin-like growth
factor-1 receptor). High-dose chemother-
apy with hematopoietic stem cell rescue has
not shown beneﬁt in patients with high risk
and metastatic disease.
Prognosis
Overall, survival without relapse is greater
than 70% in children and adolescents 5 years
from diagnosis. Low risk groups, represent-
ing approximately 30% of RMS, can be
expected to have an excellent outcome with
long-term survival greater than 90%. Of
the 55% of patients with intermediate risk
disease, 5-year overall survival is approxi-
mately 55% to 65%. In patients with met-
astatic alveolar disease (15% to 20% of the
population), survival is poor, at less than
30%. Several caveats are present that help
determine prognosis:
* Site of the primary tumor has a major
impact on survival and is associated with
pathologic subtypes, ease of surgical resect-
ability, timing to presentation, and involve-
ment of regional nodes.
* Extent of disease is the most signiﬁcant
predictive factor for survival. Children with
localized, completely resected disease do
better than those with widespread or dis-
seminated disease.
* Patients with smaller tumors (<5 cm)
have improved survival compared to chil-
dren with tumors >5 cm.
* The alveolar subtype of RMS has an
adverse prognosis and is often associated
with an aggressive clinical course and met-
astatic disease at diagnosis and relapse.
186
Chapter 20

* Patients between 1 and 9 years of age
have a better prognosis compared to infants
and older children.
Children with recurrent RMS have a dismal
prognosis with long-term survival of less
than 15%, particularly if the disease recurs
in a metastatic site or area of prior irradi-
ation. The majority of relapses occur within
3 years of therapy completion. Metastatic
recurrence is essentially incurable, though
treatment may offer palliation. Treatment
with surgical resection and adjuvant mul-
tiagent chemotherapy is recommended with
new drug combinations such as ifosfamide/
carboplatin/etoposide,
docetaxel/gemcita-
bine, and irinotecan in combination with
temozolomide
or
vinorelbine.
Durable
remissions for several years may be obtained
with aggressive local retreatment and sys-
temic therapy. High-dose chemotherapy
followed by hematopoietic stem cell rescue
has not been shown to be advantageous in
this group.
Nonrhabdomyomatous soft
tissue sarcomas
Few clinical trials and prospective studies
have been conducted in this population of
children. Surgery is the mainstay of effective
therapy and every effort should be made to
completely excise the tumor with clear
tumor margins. Patients with completely
excised low-grade tumors or high-grade
tumors <5 cm have a favorable outcome
with survival exceeding 85%. Patients with
high-grade NRSTS larger than 5 cm and
those with unresectable, localized disease
have
an
intermediate
prognosis
with
approximately 50% survival. Patients with
high-grade tumors and positive tumor
resection margins typically receive adjuvant
irradiation. It is not clear if adjuvant che-
motherapy confers a survival advantage in
this group of patients. Patients with meta-
static NRSTS have a dismal long-term prog-
nosis and fewer than 20% survive 5 years
from
diagnosis.
Neoadjuvant
chemora-
diotherapy is being explored in this group
but there continues to be a paucity of new
potential therapeutic agents.
Bone sarcomas
Primary malignant bone tumors in children
are the sixth most common malignant neo-
plasm in children and the third most com-
mon malignancy in adolescents and young
adults. They constitute approximately 6% of
all childhood malignancies. The two most
common bone tumors are osteosarcoma
and Ewing sarcoma. Other malignant bone
tumors include chondrosarcoma and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma of bone. Bone lesions
may also represent Langerhans cell histio-
cytosis, benign tumors, or metastatic dis-
ease. Osteosarcoma is classiﬁed into three
major subtypes: osteoblastic, chondroblas-
tic, and ﬁbroblastic, reﬂecting the predom-
inant type of matrix in the tumor. Histo-
logic variants include telangiectatic, small
cell, periosteal, and parosteal.
Clinical presentation
Patients typically present with a mass in the
involved area and pain, with symptoms pre-
ceding diagnosis often by several months.
Patients frequently attribute the pain to a
minor trauma and indeed may present with a
pathologic fracture in the affected bone. A
palpable mass or swelling of the involved site
typically arises after the onset of pain. Sys-
temic symptoms such as weight loss or short-
ness of breath may be late sequelae and
secondary to metastatic disease. Fever is a
common symptom of ESFT and may lead to
confusion with osteomyelitis and a longer
period of time from development of symp-
toms to diagnosis.
Sarcomas of the Soft Tissues and Bone
187

Diagnostic evaluation
Osteosarcoma may occur in any bone but
primarily occurs in the metaphyses of the
most rapidly growing bones. The most com-
mon primary sites are the distal femur,
proximal tibia, and proximal humerus with
approximately 50% of tumors originating
around the knee. Approximately 10% of
patients have primary tumors in the axial
skeleton including the pelvis, and 15% to
20% present with metastatic disease (lung,
bone, lymph nodes, and rarely brain).
Most ESFT occur in bones and their loca-
tions tend to differ from that of osteosarcoma.
Flat bones of the axial skeleton are more
commonlyaffected;inlongbones,thediaphy-
seal portion is usually involved. The most
common primary locations include the pelvic
bones, the long bones of the lower extremities,
and the bones of the chest wall. Metastatic
disease is present in 25% of patients at diag-
nosis and is primarily located in the lungs,
bones,orbonemarrow.Siteofprimarydisease
is related to the incidence of metastases at
diagnosis; central primaries are associated
more frequently with distant disease (40%),
whereas distal primary lesions have the lowest
incidence (15%).
The requisite elements of evaluation
include:
* A
complete
history
and
physical
examination.
* Routine laboratory studies include a com-
plete blood count, complete metabolic panel
with renal and liver function tests, serum
creatinine, creatinine clearance, and urinal-
ysis. A measured or calculated glomerular
ﬁltration rate should be obtained prior to
initiation of nephrotoxic chemotherapy. The
alkaline phosphatase may be elevated and has
been associated with an inferior outcome in
osteosarcoma. The serum lactate dehydroge-
nase may also be elevated and may correlate
with tumor burden.
* Imaging studies should begin with plain
radiographs to visualize osseous changes
and conﬁrm suspicion of a malignant
tumor.
Osteosarcoma
usually
produces
dense sclerosis in the metaphyses of long
bones with soft tissue extension seen in 75%
of tumors, radiating calciﬁcations (sunburst
pattern) in 60% of tumors, osteosclerotic
lesions in 45% of cases, lytic lesions in 30%
of cases, and mixed lesions in 25% of cases.
A triangular area of periosteal calciﬁcation
in the border region of the tumor and
healthy tissue is known as a Codman trian-
gle. ESFT are described as lytic with an
“onion peel” periosteal reaction and typi-
cally occur in the diaphysis. Patients with
soft tissue ESFT only may have normal
radiographs. Additional assessment of the
primary tumor site with MRI should be
undertaken to view the soft tissue compo-
nent, surrounding structures, vessels and
nerves, and the intramedullary extension
to assist with surgical planning. MRI should
include the entire involved bone and neigh-
boring joints to evaluate for skip lesions.
Metastatic disease is typically in the lungs or
bone and therefore imaging with chest CT
and technetium-99m bone scan is essential
in the initial workup for staging. FDG-PET
imaging is a sensitive screening tool for the
detection of bone metastases in ESFT but its
role in evaluation of osteosarcoma has yet to
be determined.
* Bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy
should be performed in patients with ESFT.
* Baseline audiogram and echocardiogram
should be obtained prior to initiation of
ototoxic and cardiotoxic chemotherapy,
respectively.
Pathologic diagnosis
Patients presenting with a bone mass sus-
picious for malignancy should undergo a
diagnostic incisional or core biopsy. It is
strongly recommended that an experienced
oncologic orthopedic surgeon who will also
be performing the deﬁnitive procedure per-
form the biopsy so that the biopsy tract can
188
Chapter 20

be excised en bloc with the planned surgical
resection.
Sufﬁcient
tissue
should
be
obtained for diagnostic histopathology as
well as for any submissions required for
participation in a clinical trial. Biopsy may
be taken from an extraosseous component,
if present, to prevent pathologic fracture.
As the histologic and immunophenoty-
pic features of ESFT overlap to some degree
with many other small, round blue cell
tumors of childhood, an expanded immu-
nohistochemical
panel
should
include
assessment for CD99 (a cell surface glyco-
protein with strong expression in ESFT) as
well as markers for neuroblastoma (neuron-
speciﬁc enolase and S100), synovial sarcoma
(Leu-7), and rhabdomyosarcoma (vimen-
tin, desmin, and myogenin). Molecular
genetic studies using ﬂuorescent in situ
hybridization
or
reverse
transcriptase-
polymerase chain reaction are valuable in
diagnosis, speciﬁcally for the detection of
characteristic translocations that allow for
deﬁnitive diagnosis of ESFT, RMS, and
synovial cell sarcoma.
Treatment
Systemic multiagent chemotherapy prior to
and following deﬁnitive radical surgery is
the standard of care for treatment of oste-
osarcoma. Complete resection of all disease
sites including metastatic lesions is critical
to long-term survival. An assessment of
histologic response to initial induction che-
motherapy at the time of deﬁnitive surgery
may guide subsequent treatment and helps
deﬁne prognosis. The orthopedic oncologic
surgeon determines the type of surgical
procedure performed and factors used in
this determination include the location and
size of the tumor, patient age and skeletal
maturity, presence of metastatic disease,
and patient lifestyle choices. Limb sparing
procedures are feasible in the majority of
patients and the development of expandable
endoprostheses has allowed the use of these
techniques in younger children. Tumors of
the pelvis or axial skeleton present a difﬁcult
situation, as resection with adequate mar-
gins may not be possible. Outcome is related
to degree of resection and these patients as a
group have inferior outcomes compared to
patients with extremity tumors.
Radiation therapy has limited utility in
patients with osteosarcoma, but is indicated
for those unable to undergo complete resec-
tion. The most active chemotherapeutic
agents are cisplatin, doxorubicin, high-dose
methotrexate, ifosfamide, and etoposide.
Patients can expect to be treated for approx-
imately 1 year, with a deﬁnitive surgical
procedure
performed
at
approximately
week 12, followed by continuation of mul-
tiagent chemotherapy.
Patients presenting with metastatic dis-
ease undergo the same therapeutic approach
with systemic chemotherapy and deﬁnitive
surgery of the primary site in addition to
surgery of metastatic sites, as feasible.
Approximately one-third of osteosarcoma
patients with pulmonary metastases will
have additional microscopic pulmonary
nodules not visible on the current, highest
resolution CT imaging. It is recommended
that pulmonary nodules identiﬁed on CT
imaging be surgically resected by open tho-
racotomy that will allow intraoperative lung
palpation to potentially identify additional
sites of metastatic disease. Patients with
unilateral
lung
metastases
on
imaging
should undergo bilateral thoracotomies for
this reason.
As with osteosarcoma, cure in ESFT
can be achieved only with a multimodal
approach, using surgery and/or radiation
therapy for local control of the primary
lesion and chemotherapy for eradication
of subclinical micrometastases. Deﬁnitive
surgery follows a period of induction
chemotherapy
and
many
patients
are
candidates for complete surgical resection
with limb salvage procedures. Induction
Sarcomas of the Soft Tissues and Bone
189

chemotherapy may also render initially
unresectable tumors resectable. ESFT are
radiation responsive, although typically this
therapeutic modality is reserved for surgi-
cally unresectable tumors or in tumors with
positive margins after resection. Patients
who receive radiation therapy as the only
local control modality have an inferior
outcome. Frequently, these patients have
other adverse features including large tumor
size, unfavorable locations (e.g., vertebral
tumors), or both. Radiation is also utilized
in the treatment of metastatic disease.
Debulking procedures have not been shown
to improve outcome and should not be part
of local control therapy.
Active chemotherapy agents in ESFT
include vincristine, dactinomycin, cyclo-
phosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and
etoposide (similar to RMS). As with osteo-
sarcoma, the length of systemic therapy is
approximately one year. The current stan-
dard of care for localized pediatric ESFT is
alternating cycles of vincristine, doxorubi-
cin, and cyclophosphamide (VDC) with
ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) given in a
compressed, every 2-week schedule. This
increased time–dose intensity schedule has
shown beneﬁt in pediatric patients though
not for adults. Although still being investi-
gated, high-dose chemotherapy with autol-
ogous stem cell rescue has not as yet shown
beneﬁt in the treatment of bone sarcoma.
Prognosis
Most patients with bone sarcomas have
micrometastatic disease at diagnosis since,
in the past, 80% to 90% developed lung
metastases following local control therapy
(i.e., surgery and/or radiation) alone. There-
fore, prior to the use of systemic chemo-
therapy, survival rates at 2 years were 15%
to 20%. Currently, patients with localized
disease can expect a long-term survival of
greater than 70%. Survival in patients
with metastatic disease remains dismal,
estimated at 2 years as 10% to 30%. The
degree of tumor necrosis following neoad-
juvant (presurgery) chemotherapy is an
independent predictor of event-free and
overall
survival,
presumably
reﬂecting
tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy. Specif-
ically, osteosarcoma patients with a good
response, deﬁned as greater than 95%
tumor necrosis at the time of surgery, have
a superior survival. A similar cutoff is yet to
be deﬁned for ESFT. To date, intensiﬁed
treatment for those with less favorable
tumor necrosis has not improved outcome.
The prognosis for patients with recur-
rence is quite poor. Most local recurrence is
associated with concomitant distant disease.
Time to relapse and tumor burden correlate
with postrelapse outcome. Late recurrence
(e.g., >5 to 10 years) has been reported in
bone sarcoma. Surgical resection remains
the mainstay of therapy for curative second-
line therapy. Patients with osteosarcoma
who develop pulmonary lesions after com-
pletion of therapy can be cured with surgery
alone. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in
relapse is controversial, though patients are
often offered such treatments including
cyclophosphamide/topotecan,
irinotecan/
temozolomide, and gemcitabine/taxotere.
Radiation has a role in the treatment of
patients with ESFT who develop new met-
astatic sites and for palliation and pain
control in either osteosarcoma or ESFT.
Targeted and biologically based thera-
pies are being investigated in patients with
poor response to initial chemotherapy,
those with metastatic disease, and those
with recurrent disease. Novel agents with
potential therapeutic beneﬁt include mono-
clonal antibodies to insulin growth factor-1
receptor, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, mTOR
inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies to
vascular endothelial growth factor. Speciﬁc
novel therapies for osteosarcoma include
bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid) and
RANK inhibitors (e.g., denosumab); for
190
Chapter 20

ESFT, transcription inhibition of the EWS-
FLI1 translocation is being studied.
Late effects
Site and extent of disease, as well as thera-
peutic interventions with chemotherapy,
radiation, and surgery all contribute to late
sequelae in sarcoma patients. A majority of
ﬁrst-line protocols utilize high cumulative
doses of anthracyclines (i.e., doxorubicin)
resulting in a lifelong risk of developing
cardiomyopathy.
Thus,
lifelong
cardiac
monitoring with serial echocardiograms
and
periodic
functional
assessments
is
recommended. Alkylator therapy (e.g., ifos-
famide) can lead to gonadal toxicity (pri-
marily in males) and increased risk of
secondary malignancy. Second malignant
neoplasms occur in approximately 3% of
patients within 10 years of therapy comple-
tion, likely related to both a genetic predis-
position and treatment with mutagenic
therapies. Platinum therapy (e.g., cisplatin)
can lead to long-term oto- and nephrotox-
icity. High-frequency hearing loss is com-
mon and some patients will require hearing
aids. Renal dysfunction is rare but could
result in chronic electrolyte wasting due to
proximal tubular damage (see Chapter 30
for more details).
For osteosarcoma patients, contempo-
rary orthopedic surgery techniques are
aimed at preservation of function and
improved limb salvage without compromis-
ing survival. Amputation may result in
superior limb function in some cases. In a
skeletally immature child, expandable pros-
theses may require subsequent revisions
though some may beneﬁt from newer
self-expanding prostheses. Late prosthetic
failures or infection can occur, requiring
surgical revision or delayed amputation.
Radiation therapy can lead to local effects
including

Case study for review
A 9-year-old boy presents with a nontender
3  4 cm mass in the right inguinal region.
He denies fever, weight loss, or pain else-
where. The mass has been present and
growing for several weeks.
1. What key elements should you obtain in
the history?
2. What are you looking for on the physical
examination?
3. What is your differential diagnosis for
this boy?
4. How do you approach a diagnostic eval-
uation and staging?
5. What do you tell the child and his family?
6. Assuming you ﬁnd out this is a localized
undifferentiated sarcoma, what is the child’s
prognosis and what is the general treatment
plan?
Key elements in the history include length of
symptoms, possible relationship to infec-
tion (could this be a lymph node?), animal
exposures and bites, travel, cuts or injuries
to the affected leg, systemic symptoms such
as malaise, fevers, unexplained weight loss,
or discomfort that limits activities or neces-
sitates medication.
The physical examination should be
complete, head to toe. The mass should
be measured and characterized for mobility,
tenderness, warmth, and erythema. The
mass may be hard and nontender if malig-
nant disease is present. If the mass is sus-
pected to be a node, it may be enlarged as a
result of disease spread and therefore the
distal extremity must be carefully examined.
All other lymph node chains as well as the
liver and spleen should also be carefully
assessed.
The differential diagnosis of a mass in the
inguinal area consists of lymphadenopathy
secondary to an infectious or malignant
etiology.
Infections
may
be
bacterial,
Sarcomas of the Soft Tissues and Bone
191

protozoal, fungal, or viral and may be the
result of introduction by a cut (which may
have since healed), animal bite, or scratch.
A mass that is hard, nontender, and non-
mobile, without signs and symptoms of
infection, is concerning for malignancy.
Malignancies that can lead to regional
spread in an extremity include sarcomas
(bone and soft tissue).
Assuming you could ﬁnd no lump or
tender area on the extremity exam, it is
prudent to begin a detailed investigation
with imaging and biopsy. Imaging should
consist of MRI of the inguinal area and leg
(to the tips of the toes), bone scan, and plain
ﬁlms. An excisional biopsy should be per-
formed as well given the concern for malig-
nancy (and to prevent potential tumor
tracking which can occur with an incisional
biopsy). Once the mass is a biopsy-proven
malignancy, further staging should evaluate
for distant disease and include CT of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
Prior to initiation of the biopsy and
imaging, it is best to be straightforward with
the family and let them know your concern
that this mass likely represents a malignancy.
As the mass is in the inguinal area, it could
represent regional spread of a distant tumor.
In this case, the child had a nonpalpable
mass in the ﬁfth distal toe found on MRI.
The pathologic diagnosis of undifferenti-
ated sarcoma was made on excisional biopsy
of the inguinal mass. No other evidence of
distant tumor was found on further imag-
ing. Prognosis for undifferentiated sarcoma
is generally similar to alveolar rhabdomyo-
sarcoma, and patients with localized disease
who receive systemic chemotherapy and
aggressive local control (complete surgical
excision and focal radiation) can expect to
have approximately a 70% event-free sur-
vival. This is in stark contrast to patients
with metastatic disease in which case sur-
vival is less than 20% despite aggressive
therapy.
Those
patients
with
regional
spread, similar to this case, have an inter-
mediate prognosis. Such cases would be
treated with aggressive multiagent chemo-
therapy in addition to aggressive local con-
trol. Future therapies may include novel
biologic or targeted agents. In this child,
local control would involve treatment of the
toe and the inguinal mass. One should also
consider treatment (i.e., radiation therapy)
of the lymph nodes in between these regions
in addition to nearby pelvic nodes.

Germ Cell Tumors
Germ cell tumors (GCT) arise from primor-
dial cells involved in gametogenesis and
occur primarily in the testes and ovaries.
These tumors represent approximately 4%
of pediatric cancers. Primordial germ cells
(PGCs) are thought to originate in the yolk
sac endoderm and migrate along the genital
ridge and thus may also present in midline
extragonadal sites such as the sacrococcygeal
region, midline of the brain, mediastinum,
and retroperitoneum. Due to the pluripoten-
tiality of PGCs, GCT are an array of different
histologic subtypes, adding to the complexity
of the disease. In addition, GCT can occur
due to tumorigenesis or as part of normal
embryonal development, in part explaining
the pediatric bimodal age of distribution (2
and 20 years). In addition, age of presenta-
tion and histologic subtype varies signiﬁ-
cantly between males and females. This is
thought to be due in part to the differential
timing of male and female development;
female germ cells enter meiosis at 11 to 12
weeks of gestation while male germ cells
begin meiosis with the onset of puberty.
Epidemiology
Due to the differential timing of germ cell
maturation, GCT are more common in
females until adolescence and then become
more frequent in males. Testicular GCT
have several known risk factors including
infertility/testicular atrophy as well as crypt-
orchidism. Males with cryptorchidism have
a higher incidence of testicular cancer in
both the undescended testis and the nor-
mally descended contralateral testis despite
surgical correction, hormonal therapy, or
spontaneous descent. However, early cor-
rection may partially ameliorate this risk.
The incidence of testicular GCT in the
Caucasian population is increasing at a rate
of 3% to 6% per year. Perinatal and envi-
ronmental risk factors are thought to play a
role although these are yet to be clearly
elucidated. Young parental age at birth, low
birth order, low birth weight, and breech
birth have all been noted to be statistically
signiﬁcant risk factors in multiple studies.
Maternal exposure to pesticides or hor-
mones, parental smoking, and alcohol con-
sumption may also be factors. Genetic risk
factors also play a role, speciﬁcally in tes-
ticular GCT, as a family history of cancer,
especially at a young age, has been associ-
ated
with
increased
risk
in
pediatric
patients. Additionally, there is a higher inci-
dence in monozygotic twins and some
familial clusters have been reported. A num-
ber of congenital genitourinary anomalies
such as retrocaval ureter, bladder divertic-
ulum,
and
inguinal
hernia
have
been

associated with increased risk, emphasizing
that abnormalities in development likely
play a role. Similarly, disorders of sexual
development, especially in cases with excess
Y chromosome material (e.g., gonadal dys-
genesis), pose an increased risk in both
males and females. Children with Down
syndrome, who generally have a decreased
risk of solid tumors, are at a predisposition
to develop testicular GCT, whereas patients
with Klinefelter syndrome have an increased
risk of mediastinal GCT. Gain of chromo-
some 12p is also seen in the majority of
testicular and malignant ovarian GCT.
Approximately half of all pediatric GCT are
extragonadal in origin, with about 15% of
these being malignant.
Pathology and serum tumor
markers
The main histologic variants of GCT include
germinomas (dysgerminoma in the ovary
and seminoma in the testis), embryonal
carcinoma, yolk sac tumor (endodermal
sinus tumor), choriocarcinoma, and tera-
toma (mature and immature). Mixed GCT
are composed of two or more histologies.
Teratomas contain tissues from all three
germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and
mesoderm). Mature teratomas contain no
malignant germ cell elements and are most
commonly located in the ovary or sacro-
coccygeal region. The vast majority of
female GCT are teratomas. Teratomas in
the prepubertal male are benign, whereas
those occurring during or after the onset of
puberty are always malignant, as they arise
from other forms of testicular germ cell
tumor (speciﬁcally embryonal carcinoma).
Therefore, teratomatous elements in the
testis largely occur as a component of a
mixed GCT. In the female or prepubertal
male, these tumors are thought to derive
from a benign germ cell but may rarely
develop malignant components (i.e., squa-
mous cell carcinoma) and therefore are
treated with complete surgical resection.
Immature teratomas are tumors of inter-
mediate malignant potential with less dif-
ferentiated tissues.
Germinomas may be of pure histology or
mixed. Syncytiotrophoblastic cells occur in
about 5% of germinomas and secrete the
beta subunit of human chorionic gonado-
tropin (b-HCG). Embryonal carcinoma is
most often found as a component of testic-
ular mixed GCT and is thought to be the
driver for the development of other histo-
logic subtypes including teratoma, yolk sac
tumor,
and
choriocarcinoma.
Yolk
sac
tumor isgenerally foundasapartoftesticular
mixed GCT but can also be seen as a pure
histologic variant in young children. Yolk sac
tumor secretes a-fetoprotein (AFP).
Choriocarcinoma contains syncytiotro-
phoblastic cells and therefore also secretes
b-HCG. Ovarian cases should be distin-
guished
from
metastatic
gestational
choriocarcinoma.
In the ovary and testis, GCT should be
distinguished
from
sex
cord
stromal
tumors, which arise from the nongermina-
tive components of gonadal tissue and
include tumors involving the Sertoli-Leydig
cells of the testis and granulosa cells of the
ovary. Sarcoma as well as gonadal inﬁltra-
tion by leukemia and non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma should also be considered in the
differential diagnosis of gonadal tumors.
Due to the speciﬁc histologies that
secrete AFP and b-HCG, these tumor mar-
kers can be quite helpful in distinguishing
tumor type as well as following disease.
Mature teratomas secrete neither marker;
therefore, if a serum marker is present in the
patient diagnosed with a mature teratoma,
one must consider that the tumor contains
one or more foci of yolk sac tumor if the
AFP is positive, choriocarcinoma or germi-
noma if the b-HCG is positive, and that the
194
Chapter 21

patient in fact has a mixed malignant germ
cell tumor. Due to physiologic changes in the
secretion of fetal AFP, this marker can be
difﬁcult to utilize in young infants. AFP is
made in the fetal liver and does not decline to
adult levels until approximately 6 to 8
months of age. Age appropriate levels can
be obtained from published tables. AFP can
also be secreted by regenerating liver post-
injury or by certain liver tumors such as
hepatoblastoma. Degree of AFP elevation
may be related to tumor volume. b-HCG
is elevated in pregnancy and can also be seen
in association with childhood hepatic tumors
and other cancers involving the breast, stom-
ach, and pancreas in adults. Nonspeciﬁc
markers of GCT include lactate dehydroge-
nase isoenzyme 1, neuron-speciﬁc enolase,
and placental alkaline phosphatase.
Clinical presentation
GCT should be considered in children who
present with a pelvic, ovarian, or testicular
mass, or a midline mass in the sacrococcy-
geal region, retroperitoneum, mediastinum,
or pineal or suprasellar regions of the brain.
GCT present with signs and symptoms
related to the site and size of the primary
tumor. Compression of internal structures
can lead to pain, constipation, and urinary
obstruction. Large ovarian tumors can addi-
tionally lead to decreased lung volumes and
respiratory distress. GCT can metastasize,
most commonly to the lungs, but patients
rarely present with clinical symptoms refer-
able
to
these
metastases.
Occasionally,
patients may present with hormonal man-
ifestations
secondary
to
secretion
of
b-HCG. Speciﬁcally, peripheral conversion
of androgen to estrogen can lead to gyneco-
mastia or uterine bleeding.
Boys with gonadal GCT typically present
with a slowly enlarging testicular mass,
occasionally complicated by acute severe
pain due to testicular torsion. The differen-
tial diagnosis of a testicular mass includes
hydrocele, hematocele, varicocele, inguinal
hernia, and torsion of a normal testis. Girls
most frequently present with abdominal
pain, distention, and weight gain. Torsion
of an involved ovary, hemorrhage, or tumor
rupture may occur and present as an acute
surgical abdomen. Secretion of b-HCG may
lead to isosexual precocity. Occasionally, the
increasing abdominal girth and elevated
urine and serum b-HCG have been con-
fused with pregnancy.
The most common site of extragonadal
tumors
is
the
sacrococcygeal
region.
Although usually benign, patients can have
malignant tumors of higher stage. Older age
at diagnosis is associated with a greater risk
of malignancy. Sacrococcygeal tumors are
classiﬁed as four anatomic variants: type I
(predominantly outside the body), type II
(equally inside and outside the body),
type III (largely intra-abdominal), and
type IV (completely within the body). More
than 90% of tumors present with some
component of an externally visible mass.
These tumors are often detected in utero
with prenatal ultrasonography. They may
also present later in children with constipa-
tion, urinary obstruction, urgency or fre-
quency, lower back or pelvic pain, lower
extremity weakness, or sensory changes, all
signs and symptoms due to compression of
normal structures by tumor.
Approximately 20% of children with
GCT will present with metastatic disease,
most commonly to the lung, liver, or lymph
nodes, and rarely to the central nervous
system, bone, or bone marrow. Regional
spread resulting in surgically unresectable
tumors occurs in approximately 25% of
patients at presentation. Tumor dissemina-
tion occurs by local extension, intracavitary
seeding, or hematogenous spread. Intraca-
vitary seeding may involve the omentum,
bowel, spleen, diaphragm, or pelvic organs.

Rarely, bone involvement can occur by
direct extension.
Diagnostic evaluation and risk
stratiﬁcation
The following studies should be performed
in a child with a suspected or conﬁrmed
GCT:
* Complete history
* Physical examination
* Baseline laboratory studies consisting of a
complete blood count, transaminases, blood
urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolytes
* Baseline tumor markers including AFP,
b-HCG, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
* Imaging studies to evaluate the extent of
the mass and potential metastatic sites:
ultrasound, CT, or MRI of the primary mass
(testicular ultrasound in males, abdominal
and pelvic ultrasound, CT, or MRI in
females); abdominal and pelvic MRI or
CT as well as baseline chest radiography
with or without CT of the chest to evaluate
for metastatic disease (all CTs should be
done with contrast)
Determination of the extent of disease at
diagnosis allows proper decision making
regarding the safest and most reasonable
place to biopsy. Localized tumors of the
ovary
or
testis
should
be
completely
removed. Resection of ovarian tumors
should include abdominal exploration and
peritoneal washings for cytologic assess-
ment. Risks and beneﬁts of lymph node
sampling and biopsy of the contralateral
testis or ovary should be discussed with the
surgeon, patient, and family.
GCT are known to grow rapidly and
metastasize frequently. Diagnostic studies
should be done expeditiously to allow ini-
tiation of therapy. Due to the potential
underlying risk of contralateral testicular
atrophy, infertility, or carcinoma in situ,
sperm banking should be discussed with the
patient and family prior to radical inguinal
orchiectomy.
Treatment and prognosis
Staging is done postoperatively and is based
on pathologic degree of tumor invasion,
presence of lymph node involvement, con-
tinued positivity of tumor markers, positive
peritoneal washings (in ovarian tumors),
and presence of residual or metastatic dis-
ease. Factors known to affect prognosis
include extreme tumor marker elevation
and failure of these markers to appropriately
decline following tumor resection, based on
the appropriate half-life for each marker. Site
of tumor is prognostic, with mediastinal
tumors fairing more poorly. Histology is also
important as pure germinomas are generally
very chemotherapy sensitive and have a high
response rate. Patients with higher stage,
metastatic disease also fair more poorly.
In the patient with suspected GCT,
every effort should be made to perform a
complete resection with negative margins.
In situations where the patient presents
emergently with torsion, there may not
be time to wait for a deﬁnitive diagnosis
prior to surgery; every effort should be
made in these cases to perform a gross
total resection (GTR), assuming there is
low operative risk, after sending the appro-
priate tumor markers. In the case of a large,
invasive tumor, biopsy should be done
followed by administration of chemother-
apy and delayed surgical resection. Due to
the location of some extragonadal tumors,
especially those in the mediastinum and
retroperitoneum, neoadjuvant chemother-
apy is often required prior to surgery in
order to help facilitate the chance of a
safe GTR.
Depending on tumor location and his-
tology, some GCT can be observed after
GTR without additional therapy. Young
196
Chapter 21

patients with extragonadal tumors and a
GTR can generally be observed after surgery,
as these tumors rarely have malignant ele-
ments. Sacrococcygeal tumors must be
removed with the coccyx in order to
decrease the risk of local recurrence. Young
patients are more likely to present with pure
yolk sac tumors, and these patients can also
be observed after GTR. Gonadal tumors that
are histologically consistent with mature
teratoma similarly require only observation
after GTR. Localized testicular seminoma
can be observed, although patients with
continued elevation
of
tumor markers
should
undergo
adjuvant
radiotherapy.
Patients with this pure histology are very
chemotherapy sensitive and easily salvaged
in the event of relapse. In general, patients
with localized testicular mixed GCT can also
be observed assuming that tumor markers
normalize after surgery, again due to the
high rate of salvage with potential relapse.
Due to this risk of relapse, which is directly
related to the amount of vascular tumor
invasion, size of the primary tumor, and
percent
embryonal
carcinoma,
patients
should be presented the options of obser-
vation versus chemotherapy. Due to the
rarity of malignant ovarian GCT, recom-
mendations for chemotherapy versus obser-
vation generally follow those presented for
testicular tumors.
Higher stage, nonlocalized GCT are trea-
ted with chemotherapy and are generally
very chemotherapy sensitive. Patients are
treated with bleomycin, etoposide, and
cisplatin (BEP) regimens for 3 to 4 cycles.
These tumors exhibit a steep dose–response
curve to platinum compounds, though the
risk of toxicity (oto- and nephrotoxicity)
must be considered. Due to the potential
risk of long-term pulmonary ﬁbrosis from
bleomycin, etoposide/cisplatin (EP) and
etoposide (VP-16), ifosfamide, and cisplatin
(VIP) regimens have been developed as
alternative
therapies
to
BEP.
Bilateral
retroperitoneal lymph node dissection may
also be recommended in patients with exten-
sive disease at presentation. Patients with a
poor response to therapy or recurrent disease
may beneﬁt from second-line therapies such
as paclitaxel (Taxol), ifosfamide, cisplatin
(TIP);
vinblastine,
ifosfamide,
cisplatin
(VeIP); or gemcitabine/oxaliplatin. GCT are
also quite radiosensitive, although the high
cure rates seen with chemotherapy alone
have obviated the need for radiation in most
cases. Radiation may be considered in refrac-
tory or recurrent disease, or for palliation.
Additionally, high-dose chemotherapy with
autologous stem cell rescue may be beneﬁ-
cial in a subset of refractory patients.
Patients treated with high-dose platinum
agents may develop high-frequency hearing
loss and require hearing assistive devices.
Additionally, these drugs may lead to tran-
sient proximal tubule renal dysfunction and
resultant electrolyte wasting. Patients who
receive alkylator therapy (e.g., ifosfamide)
are at risk for secondary malignancy and
infertility (especially in males). Topoisom-
erase II inhibitors (etoposide) also increase
risk for secondary neoplasms. Bleomycin
may lead to pulmonary ﬁbrosis, although
the risk is poorly quantiﬁed.
Germ cell tumors of the central
nervous system
Intracranial GCT comprise approximately
3% of primary childhood brain tumors with
a peak incidence between the second and
third decade of life. The majority of these
tumors are germinomas, which account for
50% to 70% of cases. Nongerminomatous
germ cell tumors (NGGCT) account for the
remaining third and consist of multiple
histologies
including
endodermal
sinus
(yolk sac) tumors, choriocarcinoma, mature
and immature teratoma, and embryonal
carcinoma. Most NGGCT are of mixed
Germ Cell Tumors
197

histology and may contain germinomatous
elements but will not have this as a pure
histology. Mature and immature teratomas
predominate in the neonatal period. Patients
typically present with symptoms depending
on the location and size of the tumor,
further inﬂuenced by the extent of pituitary
dysfunction and the presence or absence of
hydrocephalus. Midline pineal tumors are
often associated with symptoms related to
increased
intracranial
pressure
due
to
obstruction of the cerebral aqueduct and
Parinaud’s syndrome (paralysis of upward
gaze) due to involvement of the tectal plate.
Tumors in the suprasellar area often lead to
endocrinopathies such as diabetes insipidus
(DI) and visual ﬁeld defects. Occasionally
DI is related to occult involvement of the
infundibulum. In children with clinical
symptoms of DI and consistent MRI ﬁnd-
ings (i.e., absence of a posterior pituitary
bright spot, possibly in association with
thickening of the pituitary stalk), the differ-
ential diagnosis should include GCT and
Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The presence
or absence of CSF tumor markers may assist
with this diagnostic dilemma.
Children with midline brain tumors
should be assessed for a GCT. CSF should
be obtained for routine studies (glucose,
protein, chamber count, and cytology) in
addition to assessment of tumor markers
(AFP and b-HCG). Patients with classic
ﬁndings on MRI and elevated AFP with
or without a signiﬁcantly elevated b-HCG
do not require a biopsy for diagnosis as they
have chemical evidence of NGGCT. Patients
with negative markers or a modest elevation
in b-HCG only should have a biopsy per-
formed. Central nervous system GCT often
spread along the CSF pathways; thus, MRI
of the spine should be obtained in addition
to head imaging for diagnostic and staging
purposes.
Patients with benign tumors such as
mature teratoma should have a curative
surgical GTR, as safely feasible. In other
tumor types, the value of a surgical resection
has not been clearly delineated and is
recommended only in speciﬁc situations
(i.e., persistence of tumor following induc-
tion chemotherapy). Pure germinomatous
tumors are highly sensitive to both radio-
and chemotherapy. In the past, radiother-
apy was the modality of choice for these
tumors
due
to
the
high
cure
rate
(5-year survival >80%). Due to the recog-
nized long-term risks from this therapy
(neuropsychological and endocrine), adju-
vant chemotherapy is now being used to
allow a reduction in the dose and extent of
radiotherapy without increasing relapse
rate. Chemotherapeutic agents are similar
to those used for systemic GCT and include
platinum agents (cisplatin and carboplatin),
alkylators (cyclophosphamide and ifosfa-
mide), and topoisomerase II inhibitors (eto-
poside). Of note, patients with DI should be
carefully monitored in an ICU setting while
receiving alkylators or platinum therapy due
to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity.
Management during this therapy can be
simpliﬁed by the use of IV vasopressin
administered as a continuous infusion.
Patients with NGGCT have had a poorer
outcome in the past as these tumors are
generally
less
radiosensitive
than
pure
germinoma. Outcome is related to tumor
histology as those patients with pure embry-
onal carcinoma, endodermal sinus tumor,
and
choriocarcinoma
fair
much
more
poorly than those with mixed histology,
especially those with a high proportion of
teratoma or germinoma. Neoadjuvant plat-
inum-based
chemotherapeutic
regimens
have shown beneﬁt in patients with NGGCT
prior to radiation therapy. Second-look sur-
gery is beneﬁcial in those patients with an
incomplete radiologic response or persis-
tently elevated tumor markers following
induction chemotherapy, prior to radiation
therapy.
High-dose
chemotherapy
with
198
Chapter 21

autologous stem cell rescue has been shown
to be of beneﬁt in patients with residual
malignant disease after chemotherapy and
surgery.
Patients with recurrent disease may be
successfully treated, depending on initial
therapy. Patients with pure germinoma
treated solely with chemotherapy may ben-
eﬁt from additional chemotherapy followed
by radiation therapy. Those that have pre-
viously received radiation may beneﬁt from
high-dose chemotherapy with autologous
stem cell rescue. Patients with recurrent
NGGCT have a much more dismal outcome
though may beneﬁt from additional chemo-
therapy, surgery, radiation, and/or high-
dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue.

Rare Tumors of
Childhood
The rarer tumors of childhood collectively
comprise fewer than 20% of all pediatric
cancers. The more frequently seen of these
include retinoblastoma (2% to 3%), liver
tumors (1%), and epithelial tumors of the
adrenal or thyroid gland (2% to 3%), which
are discussed herein. Many other rare pedi-
atric malignancies also exist that are beyond
the scope of this chapter.
Retinoblastoma
Retinoblastoma
is
the
most
common
malignant ocular tumor in childhood,
affecting 200 to 300 children per year in
the United States. Retinoblastoma is rarely
diagnosed after 5 years of age. This unique
neoplasm has a strong genetic component
related to mutation in the RB1 gene located
on chromosome 13. It was the model for the
development of Knudson’s two-hit hypoth-
esis after observation that children with
bilateral retinoblastoma developed disease
at an earlier age compared to those with
unilateral disease. The genetic form of the
disease is inherited in an autosomal domi-
nant manneryet only 15% to 25%ofchildren
have a family history, suggesting the acqui-
sition of a newgermlineor somaticmutation
in the majority. Genetic counseling is of
utmost importance in affected families due
to the risk of tumors in siblings as well as
offspringofsurvivors,especially inthose with
bilateral retinoblastoma.
The RB1 gene is a tumor suppressor gene
and individuals with loss of function of both
allelic copies are predisposed to malignancy.
Germline de novo mutations of the RB1 gene
largely occur during spermatogenesis. Sec-
ondary mutations may then be germline or
somatic depending on the timing of events.
Those mutations that are germline are her-
itable for future generations.
Retinoblastoma arises from the photo-
receptor cells of the innermost layer of the
retina. The tumor frequently extends into
the vitreous cavity, presenting with a ﬂeshy
nodular mass visible on ophthalmologic
examination. Large tumors may occupy
most of the posterior chamber. Less fre-
quently, tumors may extend externally
resulting in retinal detachment. The tumor
tends to outgrow its blood supply and may
develop areas of necrosis and calciﬁcation.
Due to the large mass or retinal detach-
ment, the normal papillary red reﬂex is
replaced by leukocoria (white papillary dis-
coloration) and is often ﬁrst noticed by the
family. Strabismus is the second most com-
mon presenting sign and is due to visual
impairment from the tumor. Other less

common presenting signs include hetero-
chromia, inﬂammatory changes, hyphema,
and glaucoma. Familial cases are often
detected early when the family is appropri-
ately advised on the need for frequent and
careful
screening
with
ophthalmologic
examinations under anesthesia. The differ-
ential diagnosis of leukocoria includes a
number of rare nonmalignant conditions
such as Coats disease, congenital cataracts,
toxocariasis, retinopathy of prematurity,
and persistent hyperplastic primary vitre-
ous. Careful retinal examination by an
ocular oncologist can rule out these other
diseases and obviate the need for tissue
biopsy. Patients with advanced disease may
present with proptosis and swelling depend-
ing on the degree of extraocular invasion.
Metastatic spread can occur through inﬁl-
tration of the optic nerve, dissemination
into the subarachnoid space, invasion into
the choroid plexus, and anteriorly into the
conjunctiva. Invasion through the optic
nerve and subarachnoid can lead to involve-
ment of the brain and spinal cord, invasion
of the vascular choroid plexus can lead to
vascular spread, and anterior invasion can
lead to regional lymph node involvement.
Patients with bilateral retinoblastoma
may present with a concurrent intracranial
neuroblastic tumor, referred to as trilateral
retinoblastoma. These patients tend to have
a poor prognosis and usually present with a
pinealoblastoma, although they may have a
neuroblastic tumor in the suprasellar region
as well. The intracranial tumor may present
at the same time as the retinoblastomas, or
after the identiﬁcation and treatment of the
original tumors, emphasizing the need for
close follow up after initial treatment.
Ultrasound, CT, and MRI are typically
used in addition to ophthalmologic exam-
ination to further characterize the tumor.
CT is the most useful test as it effectively
demonstrates intraocular calciﬁcations that
conﬁrm the diagnosis, but it creates risk due
to radiation that increases the likelihood of
secondary malignancy. MRI is most useful
for identiﬁcation of extraocular extension
and trilateral retinoblastoma. MRI of the
spine and lumbar puncture for cerebrospi-
nal ﬂuid cytology should be done in patients
with intracranial spread, involvement of the
optic nerve, or evidence of tumor invasion
beyond the lamina cribrosa on pathology
after eye enucleation. In patients with delay
in diagnosis and concern for metastatic
disease, bone marrow studies and bone scan
should be performed.
Treatment for retinoblastoma is individ-
ualized and dependent on multiple factors
including unilaterality or bilaterality of dis-
ease, potential for preserving vision, and
extent of intraocular and extraocular dis-
ease. Enucleation performed by an experi-
enced ophthalmologist is indicated for
large tumors ﬁlling the vitreous and in
those with little or no likelihood of vision
preservation. Enucleation is often indicated
for unilateral localized retinoblastoma, and
alone is effective therapy in these children.
The eye must be removed intact to avoid
seeding and care must be taken to resect
enough optic nerve to ensure negative mar-
gins. After enucleation, patients are ﬁtted
with a prosthetic implant.
Focal treatments such as laser photoco-
agulation, cryotherapy, and thermotherapy
may be utilized for very small tumors. Che-
motherapy (usually vincristine, etoposide,
and carboplatin) can be utilized for local-
ized tumors in order to facilitate focal treat-
ment for tumor eradication and prevent the
need for enucleation.
Patients
with
bilateral
disease
may
require enucleation of the more affected
eye, but fortunately bilateral enucleation is
rarely indicated. As with localized unilateral
retinoblastoma, chemotherapy may be uti-
lized prior to focal therapy to avoid enucle-
ation in either eye or in the less-affected eye.
External beam radiation therapy is generally
Rare Tumors of Childhood
201

reserved for patients with refractory or
recurrent disease after these other treatment
modalities have been exhausted due to the
high incidence of side effects including risk
of secondary malignancy.
Patients with regional extraocular disease
and metastatic disease have historically faired
very poorly. Newer studies have shown the
potential beneﬁt of chemotherapy (or high-
dose chemotherapy with autologous stem
cell rescue in those with metastatic disease)
with external beam radiation therapy.
Children treated for retinoblastoma are
at high risk for cosmetic and functional
impairment related to either enucleation
or radiation. Patients with a heritable muta-
tion in the RB1 gene have an especially high
rate of secondary malignancy after radiation
therapy.
Reported
second
malignancies
include head and neck cancers, osteosar-
coma, soft tissue sarcoma, and melanoma.
Adult tumors also have an increased inci-
dence in those with germline RB1 muta-
tions, especially epithelial tumors such as
lung cancer. Radiation therapy also may
lead to decreased visual acuity, eye irrita-
tion, and dry eye as well as growth abnor-
malities in the orbital bones. After therapy,
patients should be followed closely due to
the risk of recurrent disease. Patients with
bilateral retinoblastoma and those diag-
nosed with unilateral retinoblastoma at a
young age (i.e., <1 year of age) should be
observed for the development of an intra-
cranial mass and, in the case of unilateral
disease, a contralateral retinal mass. Recur-
rence or new disease rarely occurs after 5
years of age, although an ophthalmologist
should examine these patients annually.
Liver tumors
Primary hepatic tumors in childhood and
adolescence account for just more than 1%
of
malignancies
in
these
age
groups.
Hepatoblastoma is the most common,
representing more than 60% of hepatic
tumors,
and
occurs
almost
exclusively
during infancy and young childhood. The
incidence of hepatoblastoma is increasing,
possibly due to increased survival in very
low birth weight infants. Hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), approximately 20% to
25% of childhood primary liver tumors, is
seen most often in children above 10 years of
age. Although chronic hepatitis B infection
is the leading cause of HCC in Asia, few
American children with HCC have an
apparent etiology. Benign hepatic tumors,
such as hemangioendothelioma, hamartoma,
mature teratoma, angiolipoma, and ade-
noma,
also
occur
in
childhood
and
account for up to 20% of liver tumors in this
age group. Other extremely rare malignant
hepatic tumors include cholangiocarcinoma,
rhabdoid tumor, yolk sac tumor, rhabdomyo-
sarcoma, undifferentiated sarcoma, angiosar-
coma, leiomyosarcoma, and lymphoma.
Malignant hepatic tumors of childhood
have been associated with a number of
genetic syndromes and environmental risk
factors. Hepatoblastoma has been reported
in children with Beckwith–Wiedemann syn-
drome, familial adenomatous
polyposis
(which includes Gardner syndrome), and
isolated hemihypertrophy. The strongest
association has been reported in infants
born at less than 1500 g. Additional associa-
tions may include maternal smoking (inde-
pendent of birth weight), use of infertility
treatment, fetal alcohol syndrome, use of
oral contraceptives during pregnancy, and
occupational exposure to metals, petro-
leum, paints, and pigments. HCC is seen
in association with hereditary tyrosinemia,
biliary cirrhosis, glycogen storage diseases,
hemochromatosis, ataxia telangiectasia, and
a1-antitrypsin deﬁciency. Infection with
hepatitis B or C has been identiﬁed as a
risk factor for HCC as have exposure to
alcohol, anabolic steroids, aﬂatoxin, and
202
Chapter 22

certain carcinogens such as pesticides and
vinyl chloride.
Clinical presentation
The most common presenting signs of a
malignant hepatic tumor in childhood are
generalized abdominal enlargement or an
asymptomatic abdominal mass palpated by
the family or physician. Patients with HCC
may present with constitutional symptoms
including weight loss, anorexia, emesis, and
abdominal pain. Rarely, children may pres-
ent with jaundice in HCC or in cases with
biliary tree involvement. Occasionally, males
with hepatoblastoma present with signs of
isosexualprecociouspuberty due toexcessive
production of the beta subunit of human
chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) that is
converted to testosterone. Lung metastases
(typically
asymptomatic) may occur
at
presentation in up to 20% to 30% of children
with hepatoblastoma and HCC. Extrahepatic
extension may include peritoneal implants as
well as spread to regional and distant lymph
nodes, bone, bone marrow, and rarely the
central nervous system. Liver tumors may
also invade into adjacent intra-abdominal
structures.
Diagnosis and staging
Work up of a suspected hepatic mass should
include laboratory measurement of liver
function with coagulation studies in addi-
tion to transaminases, total bilirubin, and
alkaline phosphatase. Patients should have a
baseline complete blood count (CBC) in
addition to metabolic studies as patients
may present with thrombocytosis and/or
leukocytosis. Patients with suspected hepa-
toblastoma should have elevation of a-feto-
protein (AFP) and, less commonly, of
b-HCG. In certain cases with an extremely
high AFP, the value reported out may be
falsely low due to overwhelming of the assay
(hook effect). When the index of suspicion
is high, serial dilution of serum can allow for
more accurate reporting. Those with HCC
may also have elevation in AFP but not to
the same magnitude as hepatoblastoma.
b-HCG may be elevated in patients with
carcinoma of the biliary tract. Of note,
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and vita-
min B12 binding capacity may be elevated in
some cases of HCC. Imaging studies should
begin with abdominal and speciﬁcally liver
ultrasound with Doppler ﬂow to character-
ize the tumor as well as the relationship
between tumor and hepatic vessels. CT or
MRI should also be obtained prior to sur-
gical intervention. Angiography may be
required to help with surgical planning, but
is rarely needed now due to the excellent
resolution of current generation CT and
MRI. Evaluation for metastatic disease
should include chest CT.
AFP is the most sensitive marker for
disease,
especially
in
hepatoblastoma.
Patients with small-cell undifferentiated his-
tology have a poorer prognosis and tend to
have low serum AFP, which is a poor
prognostic marker. Decline in AFP levels with
courses of treatment is prognostic and AFP
should be followed for normalization after
surgical resection and as a marker for poten-
tial disease recurrence. Of note, serum AFP
levels vary with age in infancy, declining to
adult levels by around 6 to 8 months of age.
In addition, AFP has a long serum half-life
of 5 to 6 days and therefore may take several
weeks to normalize in cases with an extremely
high level at presentation.
Incaseswhereclinicalpresentation,imag-
ing, and tumor markers are highly suggestive
of hepatoblastoma, patients should undergo
a primary resection if it is deemed safe and
feasible. In cases where a complete resection
is not feasible or the diagnosis is uncertain,
the patient should ﬁrst undergo biopsy. A
current Children’s Oncology Group clinical
trial hopes to determine whether patients
who undergo a complete resection with a
favorable histology (i.e., pure fetal histology)
Rare Tumors of Childhood
203

can be safely observed without adjuvant che-
motherapy. Patients who cannot obtain a
complete resection or have a less favorable
histology will receive chemotherapy. In the
past, chemotherapy for hepatoblastoma has
consisted of cisplatin, 5-FU (ﬂuorouracil),
and vincristine (C5V). For patients with
higher risk disease (i.e., small-cell undiffer-
entiated histology or higher stage), the addi-
tion of other chemotherapeutic agents such
as doxorubicin and irinotecan is being
explored. Patients should receive chemother-
apy in order to facilitate total resection when
feasible, and if not feasible, prior to ortho-
topic liver transplantation. Consolidative
chemotherapy is given after resection to treat
any residual microscopic metastatic disease.
Patients with gross metastatic disease at pre-
sentation have a poor prognosis, as do
patients with recurrent disease.
In general, HCC has a poor prognosis
and often presents with multifocal liver and
metastatic disease. Previous studies treated
pediatric patients with a similar chemother-
apeutic regimen as hepatoblastoma (i.e.,
C5V) with disappointing results. Gross total
surgical resection remains the mainstay of
cure for HCC. In cases where resection is
not safe or feasible at presentation, neoad-
juvant chemotherapy may be of beneﬁt and
allow for a later total resection or for ortho-
topic liver transplantation.
A distinct pathologic variant, ﬁbrolamel-
lar HCC, has been associated with a higher
resection rate and improved survival com-
pared to other forms of HCC. Novel tar-
geted agents have shown a modest beneﬁt at
best, but may have promise when used as
part of multimodal therapy.
Radiation therapy has not been proven to
be effective in the treatment of hepatoblas-
toma and HCC, but it may have a role in
palliation of lung metastases. Similarly,
high-dose chemotherapy with autologous
stem cell rescue has not as yet been
found beneﬁcial. Local therapies including
hepatic artery chemoembolization,
per-
cutaneous radiofrequency ablation, and
percutaneous ethanol injection may be
beneﬁcial in patients with localized yet unre-
sectable HCC.
Adrenocortical carcinoma
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare
malignancy in childhood and adolescence
with peaks in both the ﬁrst and fourth dec-
ades of life. The incidence varies worldwide
with an interestingly high incidence in south-
ern Brazil. ACC has been reported in asso-
ciation with speciﬁc genetic syndromes such
as Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, isolated
hemihypertrophy, Li-Fraumeni syndrome,
and in association with congenital adrenal
hyperplasia and multiple endocrine neopla-
sia type 1 (MEN-1 syndrome). Germline
mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene
have been implicated in the majority of pedi-
atric cases in the United States and Brazil.
ACC may be functionally inactive or
secrete hormones such as glucocorticoids,
sex steroids and their precursors, and miner-
alocorticoids. Benign adrenocortical tumors
are more common and must be carefully
differentiated from ACC. Patients frequently
present with clinical signs and symptoms of
excessive cortisol production (Cushing’s
syndrome) or excessive androgen produc-
tion (virilization). Other less common symp-
toms include abdominal pain and weight
loss. The diagnosis is made based on the
presence of elevated concentrations of adre-
nocortical hormones and their intermediates
in the serum or urine. Baseline studies
should include a 24-hour free cortisol, dexa-
methasone suppression test, basal cortisol,
and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
to measure glucocorticoid secretion; testos-
terone, estradiol, androstenedione, dehydro-
epiandrosterone
sulfate
(DHEA-S),
and
17-OH-progesterone to measure sex steroids
204
Chapter 22

and their precursors; and aldosterone and
renin in patients with hypertension or hypo-
kalemia to rule out mineralocorticoid excess.
Pheochromocytoma can be ruled out by
checking
catecholamines
and
metane-
phrines. Imaging with CT or MRI of the
abdomen conﬁrms the presence of a supra-
renal mass. FDG-PET may be utilized in
equivocal cases or if CT/MRI are negative
with positive hormone markers. FDG-PET is
negative in benign adrenocortical tumors.
Many patients present with large primary
tumors and evidence of metastatic disease
involving the lungs, liver, or bones. CT of the
chest, abdomen, and pelvis in addition to
bone scan should be done for staging
purposes prior to surgical resection. ACC
are locally aggressive tumors with a thin
pseudocapsule;
an
open
adrenalectomy
should be performed to prevent extensive
hemorrhage or tumor rupture. Surgical
resection is the only known curative therapy
for ACC, both for primary and metastatic
sites. Surgery is also indicated in recurrent
disease to prolong survival.
Due to the poor response to chemother-
apy, patients with advanced disease have a
very poor prognosis. A tumor weight <
200 g (<5 cm in diameter in adults) is a
good prognostic factor. Patients with local-
ized disease should undergo aggressive gross
total surgical resection. Patients with large
tumors (>200 g) without metastatic disease
may also beneﬁt from radical retroperito-
neal lymph node dissection (RPLND).
Patients with advanced disease (invasive
or metastatic) should be treated with aggres-
sive surgical resection of the primary tumor,
RPLND, and resection of metastatic lesions
in addition to chemotherapy. If resection
of metastases is not feasible, resection of
the primary tumor may not be of beneﬁt.
Mitotane, a synthetic derivative of the insec-
ticide
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT), has a speciﬁc cytotoxic effect on
adrenocortical cells. It has shown beneﬁt in
a subset of patients with invasive, meta-
static, or recurrent disease. Mitotane may
have beneﬁt in patients with localized, fully
resected disease, although this question has
not been clearly answered. Mitotane levels
greater than 14 mg/L seem to be most ben-
eﬁcial. As mitotane is an adrenocorticolytic
agent, replacement with hydrocortisone and
ﬂudrocortisone is necessary to prevent adre-
nal insufﬁciency. For patients that progress
on mitotane or have side effects that limit its
usage, chemotherapy with cisplatin, etopo-
side, and doxorubicin may be beneﬁcial.
ACC is considered radioresistant, so this
is not a therapeutic option.
Thyroid tumors
The incidence of malignant thyroid carci-
noma in children is very low, comprising
less than 2% of pediatric cancers. The peak
incidence is in the older adolescent age
group, 15 to 19 years of age, with a prepon-
derance in females. Childhood thyroid
carcinomas are clinically and biologically
distinct from those seen in adults. The
majority of thyroid carcinomas are papillary
or follicular variants of papillary carcinoma.
Exposure to head and neck irradiation is
associated with an increased risk of thyroid
carcinoma, particularly the papillary vari-
ant. An increased incidence has been seen in
children receiving therapeutic radiation
with a median latency of 13 years and has
also been observed in survivors following the
Chernobyl nuclear accident. Genetics plays
a major role in patients with medullary
carcinoma with many children having a
positive family history. Inherited medullary
carcinoma is also seen in association with
MEN types 2A and 2B or as part of familal
medullary carcinoma. MEN types 2A and 2B
are caused by germline mutations in the RET
(rearranged
during
transfection)
proto-
oncogene. Patients with MEN type 2A
Rare Tumors of Childhood
205

develop medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheo-
chromocytoma, and parathyroid tumors.
Patients with MEN type 2B may develop
medullary carcinoma or pheochromocytoma
and are associated with a marfanoid body
habitus, mucosal neuromas, and ganglio-
neuromatosis. A high incidence of papillary
carcinoma of the thyroid is seen in familial
adenomatous polyposis coli and Cowden
disease.
Patients typically present with a painless
solitary thyroid nodule (approximately 70%
to 75%) and up to 35% to 40% present with
palpable cervical adenopathy. If the tumor
has invaded locally, patients may present with
dysphagia or dysphonia. Children are more
likely than adults to present with advanced or
metastatic disease (primarily lungs). Pulmo-
nary metastases classically appear as miliary
lesions. Staging in children is based on the
presence or absence of metastases. Younger
children may have an increased risk of recur-
rence. Presence of metastatic disease, age, size
of tumor, and degree of extrathyroid invasion
are predictive of outcome.
The initial evaluation of the child with a
thyroid nodule should include thyroid
ultrasound as well as measurement of free
thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH). Up to 20% of thyroid
nodules in children will be malignant, and
younger age, past history of irradiation, and
family history are all highly predictive of
malignant disease. Ultrasound characteris-
tics may guide the clinician in the diagnosis
as malignant tumors are more likely to have
indistinct margins, vascularity, an absence
of an echogenic halo around the nodule,
and presence of calciﬁcations. Nuclear
medicine
thyroid
scintigraphy (usually
with I123) can be utilized but is not diag-
nostic and delivers quite a bit of radiation.
The majority of thyroid nodules are cold on
thyroid scan but most of these are benign
follicular adenomas. Image-guided ﬁne
needle
aspiration
is
recommended
to
obtain tissue diagnosis. Surgical removal
may be considered in higher risk patients
with suspicious features on imaging, posi-
tive family history, or past history of irra-
diation. When a thyroid carcinoma is diag-
nosed, staging is completed with a neck
ultrasound, CT, or MRI to evaluate lymph
nodes, chest CT to evaluate for metastasis,
and possibly a neck MRI to assess for degree
of local invasion.
Surgical resection is key to curative ther-
apy in thyroid carcinoma. Patients should
undergo a total or subtotal thyroidectomy.
No speciﬁc recommendations are currently
available in children with regard to lymph
node dissection. When lymph node involve-
ment is conﬁrmed on imaging or by biopsy,
a modiﬁed lateral neck dissection is recom-
mended. Following surgery, a diagnostic
whole body scan with I123 or I131 is recom-
mended to deﬁne areas of residual disease.
Radioiodine ablation is then recommended
and has been shown to reduce the incidence
of locoregional recurrence. Lifetime thyroid
replacement is required after surgery and
radioablation.

Histiocytic Disorders
Histiocytes (composed of dendritic cells
and monocytes/macrophages; also called
tissue macrophages) are cells of the mono-
nuclear phagocytic system that ﬁght infec-
tion and clear debris. Histiocytic disorders
occur due to abnormal proliferation or
activity of these cells and have a wide variety
of clinical presentations, from the localized
and mild to the generalized and severe.
The classiﬁcation of these conditions can
be as confusing as the conditions themselves.
The most recent World Health Organization
(WHO) classiﬁcation was developed in 1997
and is presented in Table 23.1. While most of
the histiocytic disorders are considered non-
malignant conditions, many are treated sim-
ilarly to malignant disease, and the mortality
of several conditions is quite high. The eti-
ology of most types is unknown, but appears
secondary to poorly understood pathophys-
iological mechanisms. This chapter focuses
on the more common presentations of dis-
ease, speciﬁcally Langerhans cell histiocytosis
(LCH) and hemophagocytic lymphohistio-
cytosis (HLH). Less common disorders
include juvenile xanthogranuloma (includ-
ing Erdheim–Chester disease) and sinus his-
tiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy
(Rosai–Dorfman disease).
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
LCH is now the accepted umbrella term
for a wide variety of other conditions pre-
viously described, including histiocytosis X,
eosinophilic
granuloma,
Hand-Sch€uller–
Christian syndrome, Letterer–Siwe disease,
Hashimoto–Pritzker syndrome, self-healing
histiocytosis, pure cutaneous histiocytosis,
Langerhans cell granulomatosis, Langerhans
cell (eosinophilic) granulomatosis, type II
histiocytosis, and nonlipid reticuloendothe-
liosis. The pathogenesis of LCH is poorly
understood. Immune dysregulation likely
plays a role and may be reactive, occurring
secondary to trauma and infection, especially
in those patients with remitting disease. A
neoplastic process may also be possible in
cases that are systemic and widely dissemi-
nated. LCH is a misnomer as the Langerhans
cell, an epidermal dendritic cell, is not the
sole culprit; rather, like other histiocytic
disorders, LCH is due to abnormalities in
the mononuclear phagocytic system. Diag-
nosis is based on histologic features of these
Langerhans cells (characterized by Birbeck
granules on electron microscopy) in addition
to
speciﬁc
immunophenotypic
markers
(CD1a and CD207).

LCH most often presents in the bone as a
solitary or as multifocal lesions and may also
be localized to the skin or lymph nodes. Bone
lesions may be painful or painless. On plain
ﬁlm, lesions appear lytic, often with a
“punched out,” beveled appearance and may
have an associated periosteal reaction with
soft tissue swelling. Skin lesions are scaly,
erythematous papules often involving the
scalp. Localized disease in these areas portends
a good prognosis with chance for spontane-
ous remission due to “burning out” of the
underlying immune reaction. Observation is
generally favored in this situation, with certain
caveats:
1. Vertebral lesions have an inherent risk of
causing vertebral compression (vertebra
plana) or spinal cord compression if signif-
icant soft tissue swelling exists, therefore
radiation therapy should be considered.
2. Large or symptomatic solitary lesions
may beneﬁt from surgical curettage or resec-
tion, intralesional steroid injection, or radi-
ation therapy.

3. For solitary bone lesions, the recom-
mendation
for
observation
excludes
sites that put the patient at increased
risk for the development of diabetes insi-
pidus (facial bones and anterior/middle
cranial fossa). For these “special sites,”
and for multifocal bone, skin, or lymph
node
involvement,
chemotherapy
with
12 months of prednisone and vinblastine
is recommended.
Systemic disease, which involves multiple
organs including the bone marrow, liver,
spleen, or lungs, has a much worse progno-
sis, especially in those patients without an
early response to therapy. Poor responders
likely will require more intensive therapy
including, potentially, hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation.
Hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis
Like other histiocytic disorders, immune
dysregulation is the key feature in HLH.
This condition presents with prolonged
and excessive activation of macrophages,
histiocytes, and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes
(CTL). Natural killer (NK) cells, vital to
antigen recognition and killing as well
as contraction of the immune response
from T-cells and histiocytes, often have
decreased activity, in part allowing for this
hyperproliferative immune response. Viral
infection by Epstein–Barr virus is the most
common known acquired cause, although
multiple other viruses have been implicated,
and often the pathogen is not identiﬁed.
Familial HLH can occur secondary to mul-
tiple known genetic causes that lead to NK
and CTL dysfunction. The familial causes
are outlined in Table 23.2. An underlying
genetic predisposition may still require a
“second hit,” such as a viral infection, to
develop HLH.
Clinical ﬁndings are secondary to the
chronic inﬂammatory state and most
notably
include
fever,
splenomegaly,
cytopenias, and hepatitis. Diagnostic cri-
teria
for
HLH
are

clinical suspicion for HLH, treatment
should be initiated promptly even while
pending pertinent laboratory evaluation.
Current therapy includes dexamethasone,
etoposide, and cyclosporine. For patients
that have a complete response after 8
weeks, treatment can be stopped. For
those that have not responded completely
or relapse after stopping therapy, hemato-
poietic stem cell transplantation is the
treatment of choice.
Excessive activation of macrophages and
T-lymphocytes may also lead to a secondary
or reactive HLH known as macrophage
activation syndrome (MAS). Clinical crite-
ria for MAS are similar to HLH and the
underlying pathogenesis is due to an auto-
immune condition, most commonly sys-
temic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis
(adult Still’s disease). Multiple other auto-
immune diseases have been reported to
cause MAS. NK cells are vital in the pre-
vention of autoimmunity; decreased NK
activity could result in both the develop-
ment of an autoimmune disease and sec-
ondary HLH. Often it is difﬁcult to separate
the symptoms of MAS from the underlying
autoimmune disease or primary HLH.
Patients may have leukocytosis, thrombo-
cytosis, and hyperﬁbrinogenemia secondary
to the underlying inﬂammatory state, but
these levels will trend down with the
development of MAS. Fevers may become
nonremitting, and due to worsening liver
dysfunction, there may be a paradoxical
improvement
in
inﬂammatory
markers
such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) and ﬁbrinogen with a resultant
improvement in inﬂammatory symptoms
such
as
arthritis.
Treatment
for
MAS
includes pulse steroids and cyclosporine.
Duration of therapy is dependent on clinical
response; patients that do not respond or
relapse may beneﬁt from primary HLH
therapy although outcomes are poor.
Case study for review
You are seeing a 6-year-old child that pre-
sents to the emergency department with 3

fuse and spreading rash. Fever began soon

On examination, the patient is alert and
interactive, but seems somewhat uncom-
fortable from the rash. There is mild spleno-
megaly and no hepatomegaly. The patient is
started on antibiotics for presumed sepsis/
toxic shock with initial resolution of fever.
Cultures are all normal. Due to worsening
labs and rash, as well as no source of infec-
tion, the differential diagnosis is revisited.
The patient again becomes febrile.
1. What ﬁndings in the initial laboratory
tests suggest sepsis as well as HLH and MAS?
Thepatienthaselevatedinﬂammatorymarkers
(CRPandESR).Hyponatremiaandhypoalbu-
minemia are often seen with an underlying
inﬂammatory condition. There are no signiﬁ-
cant cytopenias, making HLH less likely. In
addition, the high CRP makes HLH less likely.
You review the lab trends:
Hemoglobin: 12.5 ! 10.3 ! 8.9
Platelets: 150 ! 98 ! 67
White blood cell count: 18.4 ! 28.7 ! 39.7
(continued left shift)
ESR: 50 ! 47
CRP 6.3 ! 12.9 ! 18.1
Fibrinogen: 441 ! 387 mg/dL
A ferritin is sent and is very elevated
at 68,300 mcg/L. Fasting triglycerides are
253 mg/dL.
2. How do these lab values help with the
differential?
The patient continues to have signs of an
underlying
inﬂammatory
picture
and
hypercytokinemia. Sepsis should still be
considered on the differential with the
continued elevated ESR, CRP, and ﬁbrin-
ogen. The worsening bicytopenia though
should make HLH and MAS higher on the
differential. The extremely elevated ferri-
tin is relatively speciﬁc for HLH and MAS,
and a level this high is concerning for
MAS. The decreasing ESR and ﬁbrinogen
also raise the concern that the patient is
moving for symptoms of an underlying
autoimmune
disorder
to
frank
MAS.
Finally, the elevated white blood cell count
with neutrophilia makes MAS much more
likely than HLH.

Hematopoietic Stem
Cell Transplantation
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) has become increasingly accepted
as a therapeutic modality for a variety of
malignant and nonmalignant conditions.
HSCT involves the ablation of the reci-
pient’s bone marrow with high doses of
chemotherapy as well as, in some cases,
radiation therapy in order to allow engraft-
ment of the donor’s stem cells. Collected
stem cells can either be allogeneic (from a
separate donor) or autologous (from the
patient). The rationale for HSCT is based
on the logarithmic dose–response curve
for many chemotherapeutic agents: a much
higher dose effectively increases tumor kill-
ing at the cost of profound myelosuppres-
sion. Secondarily, multidrug therapy is
required
to
overcome
resistance
and
heterogeneity within the malignant cell
population.
Transplantable conditions
Diseases treated using HSCT can be divided
into malignant and nonmalignant condi-
tions.
Recommendations
for
malignant
conditions are continually being updated
due to changes in the effectiveness of
standard chemotherapy and the risks and
beneﬁts of HSCT. In pediatric patients,
allogeneic
transplantation
is
generally
recommended for hematologic malignan-
cies due to the underlying bone marrow
involvement (Table 24.1). In addition to
the effectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy
in tumor killing, there is beneﬁt of a “graft-
versus-leukemia” (or lymphoma) effect in
allogeneic transplant in which the immu-
nosensitized donor T-cells can theoretically
kill residual malignant cells. In contrast,
autologous transplant is generally reserved
for patients with solid tumors and no evi-
dence of bone marrow involvement after
failure of standard chemotherapeutic regi-
mens (Table 24.2). Recommendations for
allogeneic HSCT in nonmalignant condi-
tions are summarized in Table 24.3.
Types of transplantation
Stem cells for allogeneic transplantation are
collected from bone marrow, peripheral
blood, or umbilical cord blood (UCB),
whereas stem cells for autologous transplan-
tation are collected most commonly from
peripheral blood. Collection of stem cells
from peripheral blood occurs after mobili-
zation with granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF). The usual volume of bone
marrow
required
to
ensure
successful

engraftment of donor cells is 10 to 20 mL/kg
of recipient body weight. Younger donors
have
a
higher
proportion
of
marrow
repopulating cells. Peripheral blood stem
cells are collected via apheresis and identi-
ﬁed by the presence of a cell surface marker,
CD34 (cluster of differentiation). In general,
5  106 CD34þ cells/kg are required to
ensure engraftment. For allogeneic trans-
plant, the physician must balance the risks,
beneﬁts, and availability of cells derived
from bone marrow, peripheral blood, and
UCB. Peripheral blood has the highest yield
of CD34þ cells (with G-CSF mobilization),
whereas UCB has the lowest (due to the
volume of UCB). The risk of graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD) is lowest after UCB
transplantation and highest after peripheral
blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT). En-
graftment of donor cells occurs earliest after
PBSCT. Availability of allogeneic stem cells
is often limited by the lack of an eligible
donor.
Donor matching in allogeneic
transplantation
The
major
histocompatibility
complex
(MHC) is a large genomic region on chro-
mosome 6 that encodes the human leuko-
cyte antigen (HLA) system. MHC is vital for
the immune system to recognize self versus
nonself and varies greatly between indivi-
duals. MHC is divided into two major
classes, class I and class II. MHC class I
molecules are found on nucleated cells and
present the MHC to cytotoxic T-cells and
natural killer cells. MHC class I includes
HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C. MHC class II
molecules are located on antigen-presenting
cells (B-cells and macrophages) and present
the MHC to T helper cells. MHC class II
includes HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR.
Many
other
minor
histocompatibility
complexes are important in the immune
response; however, current donor matching
for HSCT is limited to class I and II
molecules.
Identiﬁcation
of
a
suitable
donor
requires matching the recipient’s MHC
class I and II antigens with those of the
donor. Greater disparity between donor and
recipient leads to increasing risk of rejection
of the donor cells and, if engraftment
occurs, GVHD. Matched family member
donor grafts have been found to be the least
immunogenic. Unfortunately, 60% to 70%
of patients will not have a matched family
donor. In these cases, unrelated volunteer
donors can be found through bone marrow
donor registries, such as the National Mar-
row Donor Program in the United States

and Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide that
coordinates multiple worldwide registries.
Due to the unavailability of a matched
donor in many cases, partially matched
donors must be used with increasing risk
of immune reactions.
Currently, HLA matching is limited to
HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DR, and
HLA-DQ.
National
Marrow
Donor
Program retrospective reviews on HLA
matching in unrelated donor bone marrow
transplantation have shown that mismatches
at MHC class I (HLA-A, HLA -B, and HLA
-C) and MHC class II DR (speciﬁcally HLA-
DRB1) each had a separate, signiﬁcant effect
on survival and risk of GVHD. Additionally,
an increasing number of mismatches led to
decreasing survival. HLA-DQB1 was also
found to have an additive negative effect in
patients with other mismatches. UCB trans-
plantation has been shown to not require the
same level of HLA matching, and matching is
limited to HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DR.
UCB transplantation is thought to be less
immunogenic secondary to the decreased
alloreactivity of these immature cells. Ulti-
mately, the physician must balance the avail-
ability of a matched donor with other factors
such as the patient’s disease stage, remission
status, and general condition. In most cases,
disease stage has a greater impact on survival
than the level of HLA mismatch.
Pretransplant preparative
regimens
High-dose chemotherapy, with or without
radiation, is administered in order to max-
imize tumor killing and, in patients under-
going allogeneic transplant, to affect a suf-
ﬁcient amount of immunosuppression to
overcome recipient rejection of the HSCT.
Commonly used conditioning agents, their
mode of action, and potential side effects are
summarized in Table 24.4.

Engraftment
syndrome,
characterized
by
fever, rash, as well as pulmonary symptoms
and weight gain (secondary to capillary leak),
may take place during the initial rapid rise in
the white blood cell count. After infection has
been ruled out, a short course of intravenous
steroid therapy can alleviate symptoms.
Primary graft failure is deﬁned as a lack
of engraftment within 6 weeks after trans-
plant. Chimerism studies, either of the
peripheral blood or bone marrow, measure
percentage of donor and recipient cells and
thus also help determine marrow engraft-
ment or primary graft failure. Factors in
graft failure include: a nonmyeloablative
preparative regimen, insufﬁcient volume
of
stem
cells
(i.e.,
UCB
transplant),
increased immunogenicity due to mis-
matched HSCT, and the use of myelosup-
pressive
agents
(i.e.,
medications
for
GVHD). Secondary graft failure (graft rejec-
tion) occurs after the initial wave of engraft-
ment secondary to the continued presence
of recipient cytotoxic T-cells. Chimerism
studies must again be utilized to show that
the majority of cells are of host origin. Other
causes of graft failure including infection
and recurrence of an underlying hemato-
logical malignancy should be ruled out.
Complications of hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation
HSCT recipients have a unique set of poten-
tial complications that must be well under-
stood when caring for these patients. The
pretransplant preparative regimen can lead
to a number of posttransplant complica-
tions as outlined in Table 24.4. A common
complication
is
veno-occlusive
disease
(VOD) of the liver, also known as sinusoidal
obstructive syndrome (SOS). The profound
immunosuppression
that
occurs
both
before and after engraftment puts HSCT
patients at high risk for infection with a
variety of organisms. Finally, immunogenic
donor T-cells can lead to GVHD due to the
recognition of host alloantigens as foreign.
Multiple late sequelae of HSCT must also be
considered.
Infections
Practitioners must be cognizant of the many
potential infectious complications in the
HSCT patient. Infection prophylaxis is an
important aspect of supportive care and is
outlined in more detail below (text and
Table 24.12). The duration of severe neutro-
penia (ANC< 0.5 109/L)
and time
to
engraftment are signiﬁcant risk factors, as the
large majority of patients will have a docu-
mented infection after 4 to 5 weeks of neu-
tropenia. Even though the white blood cell
count recovers in weeks after transplant,
immune reconstitution takes months to
years depending on the type of transplant
(autologous vs. allogeneic) as well as
the continued use of immunosuppressive
agents to prevent or treat GVHD. The
presence of a central venous catheter is a
secondary risk factor. Infections tend to
occur at different times after transplant as
outlined in Table 24.5. Work up of fever in
the posttransplant period is outlined in
Table 24.6. Engraftment syndrome, GVHD,
and medications such as G-CSF can all be
causes of fever in the posttransplant period
but are diagnoses of exclusion. Clostridium
difﬁcile should be considered in the patient
with associated symptoms such as fever,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
Veno-occlusive disease/sinusoidal
obstructive syndrome
Veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also called
sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS),
results from hepatic injury caused by
high-dose chemotherapy or total body irra-
diation leading to ﬁbrosis of small hepatic
216
Chapter 24

vessels. VOD/SOS typically occurs in the
ﬁrst 30 days after allogeneic transplant
and presents with worsening weight gain,
jaundice, and hepatomegaly. Treatment of
VOD/SOS is supportive; general guidelines
are outlined in Table 24.7.
Graft-versus-host disease
GVHD occurs due to the proliferation of
donor T-cells that recognize host antigen
as foreign. Direct effects of the T-lympho-
cytes and cytokine response lead to the signs
and symptoms of GVHD. Acute GVHD can
begin
within
weeks
of
transplantation;
chronic GVHD is deﬁned as GVHD lasting
beyond 100 days after transplant. Signs and
symptoms of acute and chronic GVHD are
summarized in Table 24.8, grading of GVHD
isoutlinedinTable24.9,and prophylaxisand
treatment are described in Table 24.10.
Patients should be checked daily for signs
and symptoms of acute GVHD while hospi-
talized following HSCT.
Late sequelae
Multiple late effects must be considered and
are summarized in Table 24.11.
Supportive care in transplant
patients
Routine care for the HSCT patient is a
unique and vital aspect of preventing
infections
and
a
multitude
of
other
potential complications including bleeding,
transfusion-associated GVHD, and CMV
reactivation, as well as ABO incompatibility
between recipient and donor.
Infection prophylaxis
Due
to
profound
immunosuppression,
HSCT patients are at risk for reactivation
of latent viral infections in addition to fun-
gal and bacterial infection. Guidelines for
infection prophylaxis and surveillance are
outlined in Table 24.12.
Diet
Due to the pretransplant preparative regi-
men, patients will have an extended period
of
anorexia
requiring
total
parenteral
nutrition (TPN). Triglycerides should be
followed weekly while on TPN in addition
to routine monitoring of electrolytes. Trace
elements should be included in the TPN.

Once the patient is eating, it is vital that the
patient’s family be aware of the bone
marrow transplant low microbial diet of
acceptable foods and appropriate methods
of handling, preparation, and storage in
order to prevent infection from food-borne
pathogens.
Transfusion guidelines
Due to immunosuppression, all HSCT
patients should receive irradiated blood
products in order to eliminate the risk of
transfusion-associated GVHD. In addition,
packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions
should be CMV negative for HSCT recipi-
ents who are identiﬁed as CMV seronega-
tive during the pretransplant period. CMV
seronegative platelets are not routinely
required as leukoﬁltered platelets are con-
sidered sufﬁciently leukoreduced to pre-
vent transmission of CMV. In order to
diminish the risk of spontaneous bleeding,
platelet level is kept above 20  109/L after
HSCT. This threshold is increased to above
50  109/L
in
certain
cases,
including
patients with sickle cell disease, brain tumor

patients, and patients with severe mucositis,
VOD/SOS, or problems with hemostasis (e.
g., epistaxis and GI bleeding). A lower thresh-
old of 10  109/L can be utilized in stable
patients who are out of the immediate post-
transplant period. Hemoglobin levels are
usually kept above 8 to 9 mg/dL depending
on institutional practice. Platelet transfu-
sions should be limited to 1 pheresed unit
(see Chapter 5). ABO blood types of both the
donor and recipient must be considered
when
transfusing
platelets
and
PRBCs.
Appropriate transfusion in ABO-incompat-
ible donor and recipient is summarized in
Table 24.13.
Immune reconstitution
Even with the recovery of white blood cell
counts and speciﬁcally lymphocyte counts,
HSCT patients take months to years to
recover immune function. Loss of memory
B-lymphocytes due to the pretransplant
preparative regimen leads to loss of anti-
body secondary to vaccination and lifetime
environmental exposures. Immune recov-
ery is variable but generally occurs once the
patient is off immunosuppressant therapy,
and therefore is often earlier in patients
undergoing
autologous
transplantation.
Once there is sufﬁcient evidence of immune
reconstitution, HSCT patients will proceed
with revaccination. Studies of immune
reconstitution, which begin once the abso-
lute lymphocyte count is >1  109/L and
the patient is off immunosuppressive ther-
apy, are summarized in Table 24.14.

2. What medications would you consider
adding based on the above differential?
The patient is well covered for Gram-neg-
ative
infections
with
ceftazidime
and
tobramycin.
Gram-positive
infections
usually have a positive blood culture,
although vancomycin should be consid-
ered if the patient is clinically worsening
(i.e., respiratory distress or hypotension).
The patient is at risk for S. epidermidis
secondary to the central catheter and
S. viridans secondary to mucositis, neither
of which is covered with ceftazidime and
tobramycin. Fungal infection must be
seriously
considered.
Fluconazole
will
cover Candida albicans but not other can-
didal species or Aspergillus. You should
consider discontinuing ﬂuconazole and
starting an antifungal agent with a broader
spectrum of activity such as an echinocan-
din (i.e., micafungin). Micafungin has a
broader spectrum of activity than ﬂucon-
azole, but only has moderate coverage
against Aspergillus and does not cover most
mold species. Finally, the addition of
steroids for engraftment syndrome with
fever and rash should be a consideration
if infection is relatively well ruled out
after negative blood cultures and chest
radiography.
After a few days the patient defervesces
but has developed an increase in his
bilirubin. The infectious work up has been
negative to date. On looking at his ﬂuid
status for the last 48 hours, you note that he
is 2 L positive and his weight has increased
by 2 kg from the time of his transplant.
3. What is the differential diagnosis for
hyperbilirubinemia and weight gain at this
point after transplant?
Differential diagnosis:
Veno-occlusive
disease/sinusoidal
obstructive syndrome
Viral infection
Engraftment syndrome
Heart failure (secondary to infection,
ﬂuid overload, and previous anthracy-
cline therapy)
Graft-versus-host disease
At this time point after transplant, with a
negative infectious work up, VOD/SOS is
the most likely diagnosis. If the patient is
having increasing WBC counts with rash
and diarrhea, engraftment syndrome is
possible but should be a diagnosis of exclu-
sion. Although GVHD is a possible cause of
hyperbilirubinemia and weight gain, it is
less likely this soon after HSCT. Heart
failure is a possibility secondary to toxicity
from therapy or an underlying infection
and
should
be
ruled
out
with
echocardiogram.
4. What would be changes in therapy that
you should institute?
Most patients with VOD/SOS ultimately
recover with supportive care alone. Fluid and
sodium restriction should be initiated in
addition to starting spironolactone therapy.
An abdominal ultrasound with Doppler ﬂow
should be undertaken to look for hepatic
ﬁbrosis and changes in portal venous ﬂow.
Antioxidants including vitamin C, E, and
selenium should be added to the TPN. If the
patient develops increasing weight gain and
liver dysfunction, more aggressive interven-
tions such as antithrombin III therapy or
deﬁbrotide should be instituted.

Supportive Care of the
Child with Cancer
Much of the dramatic improvement in
outcomes in pediatric oncology over the
last 50 years can be attributed to the devel-
opment of novel chemotherapeutic agents
and an increase in therapeutic intensity.
With this increased intensity, supportive
care has become a vital component in
preventing, recognizing, and treating the
potential
side
effects
of
this
therapy.
The practitioner should be familiar with
the potential risks of chemotherapy as out-
lined in Chapter 30, guidelines for trans-
fusional supportive care as described in
Chapter 5, and treatment for febrile neu-
tropenia as discussed in Chapter 27. Here
we discuss infection prophylaxis, anti-
emetic therapy, and the use of hematopoi-
etic growth factors. Speciﬁc supportive care
information for patients after hematopoi-
etic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is
discussed in Chapter 24.
Infection prophylaxis
Children receiving chemotherapy for treat-
ment of their malignancies are susceptible to
acquiring infection from bacterial, viral,
fungal, and protozoal organisms. They are
chronically immunosuppressed as a direct
result
of
chemotherapy,
and
at
times
severely myelosuppressed. While inpatient
they have an increased exposure to nosoco-
mial organisms as well. Many of these chil-
dren have central venous catheters and may
intermittently have mucosal breakdown
secondary to chemotherapy, both factors
disrupting the integrity of the body’s phys-
ical defense barriers. Poor nutrition also
plays a signiﬁcant role in host susceptibility.
Certain standards of care are indicated to
minimize the risk of acquiring infection in
these
children.
Infection
prophylaxis
remains the cornerstone of supportive care
in children with malignancies, decreasing
morbidity and mortality.
General measures for the prevention of
infection include avoidance of crowded
environments,wearingamaskinpublicwhen
severely neutropenic (i.e., absolute neutro-
phil count [ANC] <0.5 109/L), and careful
hand washing (by the patient and all those
whohavedirectcontact).Goodnutritionand
proper dental hygiene cannot be overempha-
sized. Oral hygiene should include daily
brushing (with a soft brush) and oral rinsing
with tap water or saline solution. Cleanliness
of the perianal area is important, especially in
theneutropenicstate.Constipationshouldbe
avoided with an age-appropriate diet, and, if
necessary, a stool softener (e.g., docusate
sodium) or laxative (e.g., MiraLax). Rectal
suppositories and rectal temperatures should
be avoided to decrease the possibility of a

mucosal tear and infection with enteric
organisms.
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/
SMX) prophylaxis is indicated in immuno-
suppressed children to reduce the risk of
acquiring Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia
(PCP) due to T-lymphocyte dysfunction
secondary to chemotherapy. Current pro-
phylactic dosing is 5 mg/kg/day of the TMP
component in two divided doses on two to
three successive days per week. Evidence
indicates that this regimen also provides
good
general
antibacterial
prophylaxis,
although
probably
more
effectively
in
patients given daily prophylaxis, which
must be balanced with potential allergy or
intolerance to TMP/SMX and especially
secondary to myelosuppression from the
therapy. For patients unable to take TMP/
SMX, inhaled pentamidine or oral dapsone
may be given. Pentamidine is preferred but
due to the need for a cooperative patient
who can appropriately inhale the medica-
tion, is usually limited to children above the
age of 7 years. The dose is 300 mg inhaled on
a monthly basis. Dapsone is given once
weekly at 4 mg/kg, with a maximum dose
of 200 mg. It is dispensed as 25 and 100 mg
tablets. Patients should commence prophy-
laxis at the time of diagnosis and continue
until 3 months after completion of therapy
to ensure T-lymphocyte immune reconsti-
tution. Prophylaxis with TMP/SMX should
be discontinued one day prior to the admin-
istration of high-dose IV methotrexate
(doses >1 g/m2) and restarted after the
serum methotrexate level has fallen to below
1  10–7 M due to competitive excretion
between TMP/SMX and methotrexate and
the risk for delayed methotrexate clearance.
Temporary interruption of TMP/SMX or a
change to an alternative therapy may be
necessary for prolonged marrow suppres-
sion or transaminitis rather than decreasing
the dose of maintenance chemotherapy
for
children
with
acute
lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL).
Fungal
prophylaxis
is
indicated
in
severely myelosuppressed patients. Mouth
care with brushing and oral rinsing is
routinely recommended for the prevention
or treatment of mouth sores and yeast. Flu-
conazole (3 mg/kg/day PO or IV) is indicated
in patients that are at very high risk of
developing infection(i.e.,acutemyelogenous
leukemia[AML],relapsed acutelymphoblas-
tic leukemia [ALL] patients). The most com-
mon fungal infections in patients receiving
intensive chemotherapy include candidiasis
and aspergillosis. Efforts to prevent invasive
fungal disease (especially Aspergillus sp., an
airborne organism) include respiratory iso-
lation, laminar air ﬂow rooms, and high-
efﬁciency particulate air ﬁlters. Patients
should not have live plants in the room, play
in dirt or gardens, or be in proximity to
construction work. Some patients may ben-
eﬁt from the addition of an echinocandin (e.
g., micafungin 1.5–2 mg/kg IV daily) for
broader prophylactic fungal coverage while
inpatient with prolonged fevers and severe
neutropenia (see Chapter 27).
Prophylaxis
for
subacute
bacterial
endocarditis is recommended for patients
with central venous catheters undergoing
invasive procedures that could cause tran-
sient bacteremia and seeding of the catheter
or heart valves. Such interventions include
dental cleaning or procedures and poten-
tially surgery involving the gastrointestinal
or genitourinary tract (controversial). The
standard regimen is the same as recom-
mended by the American Heart Association
for children with congenital heart disease:
amoxicillin 50 mg/kg (maximum 2 g) orally
1 hour prior to the procedure. Azithromy-
cin may be given to penicillin-allergic
patients (15 mg/kg, max 500 mg, 1 hour
prior to the procedure).
Viral prophylaxis and treatment
Common viral infections may be particu-
larly virulent in immunocompromised chil-
dren. These viruses include varicella zoster
Supportive Care of the Child with Cancer
227

(VZV), herpes simplex (HSV), cytomegalo-
virus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis
types A and B, respiratory syncytial virus,
and rubeola (measles). Infection with these
viruses may result in prolonged viral excre-
tion, increased morbidity, or death. At the
time of diagnosis, an immunization and
infection history should be determined. In
addition, serologies for VZV, HSV, and
CMV should be obtained as potential future
exposure to and infection with these agents
will result in different treatment recommen-
dations depending on the potential for pri-
mary infection versus reactivation. CMV
serology should also be known in determin-
ing whether a potential HSCT patient needs
CMV-negative blood (see Chapter 5).
The child exposed to varicella or zoster
with known negative varicella immune sta-
tus (negative titers [IgG] and no history of
varicella infection) should receive Varicella
Zoster Immune Globulin (VariZIG) within
96 hours of exposure (of note, VariZIG
remains an investigational agent in the
United States and requires institutional
review board approval and completion of
an investigational new drug form). Parents
should be counseled on the risk of exposure
for the child with negative immune status
and the need for immediate evaluation and
treatment if exposed. The dosage is one vial
(125 units) per 10 kg, with a minimum dose
of 125 units and a maximum of 625 units (5
vials), intramuscularly. Administration of
VariZIG extends the incubation period
from 14 to 28 days and decreases, but does
not eliminate, the possibility of clinical
infection with VZV (the incubation period
generally is shortened in the immunocom-
promised patient who does not receive Var-
iZIG). If VariZIG is not available then
intravenous immune globulin can be given
at 400 mg/kg. Myelosuppressive chemother-
apy may need to be stopped 7 days after the
exposure and held until the end of the
incubation period. The decision to hold
chemotherapy during the incubation period
should be based on the intensity of expo-
sure, condition of the patient, and intensity
of the chemotherapy. If >96 hours have
passed since exposure, the patient should
be given acyclovir at 80 mg/kg/day (max
dose 800 mg/dose) divided QID PO for 7
days. In the event of varicella or zoster
infection, chemotherapy should be stopped
and IV acyclovir should be given, 30 mg/kg/
day divided TID for 7 to 10 days, until all
lesions are crusted and no new lesions have
appeared for 24 to 48 hours. Monitor renal
function and ﬂuid status daily due to poten-
tial nephrotoxicity from acyclovir. Of note,
it is safe for household contacts to receive
varicella vaccination as transmission from
healthy recipients rarely occurs. If skin
lesions occur after vaccination, exposure
should be avoided until all lesions have
crusted over.
Children with a history of recurrent
herpes
simplex
infections
are
at
an
increased risk of reactivation with subse-
quent courses of chemotherapy or during
and after HSCT. Acyclovir administered
prophylactically can prevent or decrease
the severity of recurrent herpes infection;
the recommended oral dose is 200 mg TID-
QID for children above 2 years of age.
Immunocompromised patients with active
HSV infection should receive IV acyclovir
(30 mg/kg/day or 1500 mg/m2/day divided
q8h). HSCT guidelines
for
HSV
and
VZV
prophylaxis
are
summarized
in
Chapter 24.
Immunization during
chemotherapy
Patients receiving chemotherapy, or who are
otherwise immunocompromised, should not
receive live virus vaccines (MMR, live atten-
uated inﬂuenza vaccine [LAIV; FluMist],
varicella, rotavirus, and oral polio). Siblings
228
Chapter 25

or household contacts should not receive oral
polio although MMR, varicella, and rotavirus
are safe as transmission is rare. Limited
information is available regarding risk of
transmission with LAIV; since an inactivated
form of inﬂuenza vaccination is available,
this should be the preferred immunization
in family members as well as health care
providers. Although varicella vaccination has
been shown to be safe in patients with ALL in
maintenance, the beneﬁts and risks of this
immunization should be weighed carefully.
Consideration should be given to the likeli-
hood of developing a protective response
while still on chemotherapy and the poten-
tial to develop active infection with admin-
istration of a live attenuated vaccine. This
must be weighed with the signiﬁcant risks
from natural varicella infection in the immu-
nocompromised, although the chance of
infection has decreased signiﬁcantly with
herd immunity.
Inactivated vaccines (e.g., DTaP, Tdap,
Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, pneumococcal,
Hib, IPV, meningococcal, and inﬂuenza)
can be safely given during therapy, although
response will be signiﬁcantly attenuated
based on the level of immunosuppression.
Yearly inﬂuenza vaccination is reasonable
during therapy as the potential beneﬁt of
immunization outweighs the risks, espe-
cially for children with ALL in maintenance.
In order to increase the chance of an appro-
priate
antibody
response,
vaccination
should be spaced out from chemotherapy
as much as feasible. Due to potential risks of
pneumococcal and Hib infection in patients
with
Hodgkin
lymphoma
(HL)
some
experts recommend vaccination against
these pathogens prior to starting therapy.
Although not immunocompromised, un-
treated patients with HL have an underlying
B-lymphocyte dysfunction and the beneﬁts
of immunization prior to therapy are often
signiﬁcantly diminished. Evidence is lacking
to make ﬁrm recommendations.
Catch-up immunizations should occur
after the completion of therapy. Most
sources feel that waiting 3 to 6 months after
therapy completion will produce sufﬁcient
immune reconstitution to allow an appro-
priate response to inactivated vaccines.
Patients who had not previously completed
their primary vaccination series should
restart from the beginning. Patients who
previously completed the primary series
can have antibody titers drawn to deter-
mine what protection they have lost, if
any. Children above 5 years of age (not
including patients with HL) have a small
risk
of
developing
signiﬁcant
disease
from pneumococcus or Hemophilus in-
ﬂuenza, but revaccination against these
pathogens should be considered in all
patients
after
therapy.
Postvaccination
titers can be considered although the
likelihood of an insufﬁcient response is
minimal in patients who are vaccinated
6 months after chemotherapy has been
completed. Little evidence exists as to
the appropriate and safe timeframe to
receive live vaccinations after chemo-
therapy. In general, we recommend waiting
12 months after therapy completion before
reimmunizing with MMR and varicella.
HSCT guidelines are brieﬂy described in
Chapter 24.
Prevention of chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting
Antiemetics are a vital component of the
supportive
care
regimen
for
patients
receiving
chemotherapy
or
radiation.
There are three types of chemotherapy-
induced nausea and vomiting (CINV): (1)
anticipatory, (2) acute, and (3) delayed.
Anticipatory emesis occurs before chemo-
therapy is administered and may be a
result of nausea and vomiting experienced
during previous cycles of therapy. Acute
Supportive Care of the Child with Cancer
229

emesis occurs within the ﬁrst 24 hours of
therapy; delayed emesis occurs at least 24
hours after therapy has been completed.
Poor control of nausea and vomiting may
prolong, or result in, hospitalization and
lead to dehydration and electrolyte abnor-
malities. The single most important factor
in CINV is the emetogenic potential of a
particular chemotherapeutic agent, which,
in pediatric patients, is also dose depen-
dent for some drugs (Table 25.1).
Multiple agents are useful for the pre-
vention and treatment of CINV. Recogni-
tion of the chemoreceptor trigger zone and
the importance of the 5-HT3 receptor have
been instrumental in better controlling
CINV. Cytotoxic chemotherapy appears
to be associated with release of local
mediators such as 5-HT and substance P
from the enterochromafﬁn cells of the
small intestine. The release of these local
mediators subsequently stimulates vagal
afferents that initiate vomiting. 5-HT3
receptors and substance P receptors (called
neurokinin-1) are located both peripherally
(vagal nerve terminals) and centrally in the
chemoreceptor trigger zone; thus, 5-HT3
and substance P antagonists may have both
peripheral and central effects in inhibiting
vomiting.
The major pediatric antiemetics, and
their speciﬁc mechanisms of action and
dose, are summarized in Table 25.2.
Hematopoietic growth factors in
children with cancer
Several hematopoietic growth factors have
been approved for clinical use in children
including granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (G-CSF, ﬁlgrastim) granulocyte–
macrophage
colony-stimulating
factor
(GM-CSF, sargramostim), and erythro-
poietin (EPO, epoetin alfa). The indica-
tions for each of these growth factors are
based on limited evidence in pediatric
patients and are generally derived from
adult data. Here we summarize general
recommendations for the use of these
agents in pediatric oncology.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor
G-CSF is a lineage speciﬁc cytokine that
stimulates the proliferation of neutrophils
(granulocytes). As patients may have pro-
longed periods of myelosuppression after
chemotherapy, G-CSF is recommended
for adult patients with: (1) the expectation
for prolonged myelosuppression to pre-
vent episodes of febrile neutropenia and
infection, (2) a history of febrile neutro-
penia, (3) the history of a delay between
chemotherapy cycles, and (4) a diagnosis
of febrile neutropenia. Pediatric evidence
is minimal compared to adult studies but
supports the use of G-CSF for patients with
two of these four scenarios: (1) prevention
of febrile neutropenia and infection (pri-
mary prophylaxis), and (2) treatment of
febrile neutropenia. Although infection-
related morbidity has not been shown
to decrease with G-CSF usage in these
scenarios, risk of infection and length of
hospitalization have been shown to be sig-
niﬁcantly reduced in meta-analyses, with
potential beneﬁts for quality of life and
decreased cost from shorter hospitalization.
GM-CSF has shown similar results to G-CSF
but has not been shown to be superior in
clinical studies. In general, G-CSF is the
colony-stimulating
factor
of
choice
in
pediatric patients. Clinical studies have

less frequent dosing; pediatric randomized
controlled studies are lacking.
Primary prophylaxis
G-CSF should be given to patients receiving
multiagent chemotherapy who are expected
to experience a high incidence of febrile
neutropenia or severe, prolonged neutrope-
nia (i.e., ANC <0.5  109/L for 7 or more
days). G-CSF should not be given on the
same days patients are given myelosuppres-
sive chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
G-CSF is generally not administered to
patients with myeloid leukemia due to the
theoretical risk of stimulating proliferation
of the leukemic clone.
Treatment of febrile neutropenia
Pediatric guidelines are not clear but treat-
ment should be considered in patients with
profound neutropenia (ANC <0.1  109/L),
uncontrolled primary disease, pneumonia,
hypotension, multiorgan failure, and inva-
sive fungal infection.
Duration
G-CSF should be started between 1 to 5
days after the last dose of myelosuppressive
chemotherapy or radiation. G-CSF should
be continued until the ANC is greater than
1.5  109/L for 1 to 2 days following the
expected neutrophil nadir from chemo-
therapy. Speciﬁc protocols may call for
different ANC thresholds.
Monitoring
Once G-CSF is initiated, a complete blood
count (CBC) and differential should be
monitored at least weekly.
Adverse effects
The most common side effects of G-CSF
are bone pain and elevation of uric acid,
LDH, or alkaline phosphatase. Occasionally
G-CSF has been reported to cause fever,
nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, splenomeg-
aly, and erythema at the injection site.
Recombinant human
erythropoietin
Erythropoietin induces proliferation and dif-
ferentiation of red blood cell progenitors. The
recombinant
product erythropoietin
alfa
(rHuEPO) has been approved in pediatric
patients although administration of rHuEPO
to oncology patients with chemotherapy-
induced anemia remains controversial. A sec-
ond recombinant, darbopoietin alfa, which
has a two- to threefold longer half-life, has
been approved in adult patients only.
Meta-analysis of adult data has shown
that although rHuEPO decreases transfu-
sion requirements in cancer patients, there
is a signiﬁcant increase in venous throm-
boembolism and, potentially, mortality.
Pediatric data are limited but have not to
date shown a signiﬁcant difference in sur-
vival with the use of rHuEPO, although
quality of life may be improved. In addi-
tion, venous thromboembolism has not
been seen in pediatric patients. Concern
remains that the decrease in adult survival
rates with rHuEPO may be secondary to
the ubiquitous expression of the EPO-
receptor on tumor cells and therefore
tumor upregulation with rHuEPO usage.
Conclusive in vivo data are lacking.
Pediatric guidelinesforrHuEPOtherefore
include the following: (1) use of rHuEPO is
not recommended in pediatric oncology
patients, and (2) rHuEPO should be consid-
ered on a case-by-case basis in special popu-
lations where blood product usage is rela-
tively contraindicated. Speciﬁcally, Jehovah’s
Witnesses forbid blood product transfusion
and therefore the potential risks and beneﬁts
of rHuEPO should be discussed with the
practicing patient and their family. A candid
discussion
should
occur
between
the
Supportive Care of the Child with Cancer
233

provider, patient, family, and potentially
patient advocate, to discuss this complex
situation. Although rHuEPO may ameliorate
some transfusion need, it may not be able to
eliminate this need completely. Additionally,
the patient and family should be made aware
of the theoretical risks regarding survival
with rHuEPO usage.

Central Venous
Catheters
Indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs)
have revolutionized the care of children
with cancer by simplifying the administra-
tion of therapy, increasing safety, decreasing
pain, and improving quality of life by reduc-
ing
physical
and
psychological
stress.
Peripheral
venous
access
can
become
increasingly difﬁcult in young children.
Additionally, peripheral administration of
certain antineoplastic drugs may cause
injury due to extravasation. CVCs provide
a safe, accessible route for infusion of che-
motherapy, total parenteral nutrition, blood
products, antibiotics, pain medications,
hematopoietic stem cells, and other medi-
cations and infusions. These devices also
allow for frequent and convenient blood
sampling, which can be taught to home care
providers. CVCs are now an integral aspect
of management of cancer or chronic illness
in children.
The optimal type and timing of place-
ment of a CVC are not standardized. Many
types of CVCs are available and are divided
between temporary (peripherally inserted
central catheters) and more permanent,
tunneled catheters. Tunneled catheters can
either be entirely under the skin or have an
external portion that allows access. This
chapter focuses on the permanent catheters,
placed to provide access for months to years.
These catheters are typically made of plastics
with ﬂexible silicone rubber tubing. They
are surgically placed (and removed) by
experienced practitioners via a percutane-
ous or cut down technique. The patient
should be assessed for bleeding risk by
having a platelet count and coagulation
studies checked preoperatively. External
right atrial catheters are typically inserted
into the subclavian, internal jugular, or
external jugular vein and are tunneled to
an exit site on the anterior or lateral chest.
Placement in other locations may be neces-
sary for patients with a history of throm-
bosis, multiple previous CVCs, or in the
patient with compression of the upper
venous system due to tumor. The location
of the catheter tip should be conﬁrmed by
ﬂuoroscopy or chest radiography to be at
the junction of the superior or inferior vena
cava and the right atrium prior to the
catheter being used. Ultrasonography or
angiography may assist the surgeon in
determining the most accessible vein for
CVC placement. External CVCs have a
Dacron cuff attached to the catheter wall
that is positioned 1–2 cm from the skin exit
site. This allows for the growth of ﬁbrous
tissue (scar) into the cuff, preventing migra-
tion and loss of the line. Surgeons will
typically place sutures externally as well that

may be removed after healing. Totally
implanted catheters (ports) are secured to
the deep fascia on the anterior chest wall
with sutures. Ports are made of nonimmu-
nogenic materials and some now allow for
high-pressure infusion of contrast for radio-
graphic imaging. The silicone membrane of
the reservoir is accessed by a special non-
coring needle (Huber) and is self-sealing
with needle removal. Topical anesthesia is
typically applied over the reservoir prior to
internal catheter access.
The most frequently
used tunneled
external catheters are Broviac, Hickman,
and Leonard. Totally implantable catheters
include Medi-Port, Port-a-Cath, BardPort,
and
PowerPort.
Single
lumen
external
catheters and ports are used most com-
monly in children, but double and triple
lumen catheters and ports are available.
Patients that require pheresis for stem cell
collection early in their course of therapy
may beneﬁt from the placement of a phere-
sible catheter, such as a Medcomp. These
lines require meticulous maintenance and
are not repairable, unlike the standard
external tunneled catheters. Due to the
larger lumen size required for a pheresible
catheter and associated risk of thrombosis,
these lines are not always feasible for long-
term access in smaller children. The Bard
PowerLine is becoming a popular double
lumen pheresible catheter due to the higher
ﬂow rates that are possible through them. In
addition, they can frequently be placed in
children who are too small to safely receive a
conventional double lumen catheter (see
Table 26.1).
The decision about the type of CVC to be
placed is based on multiple factors including
length and intensity of therapy; frequency of
lab draws; the need for multiple lumens to

support simultaneous administration of
chemotherapy, hydration, pain medication,
parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, and other
agents; age; and lifestyle. In general, external
and multilumen devices are associated with
greater risk, primarily due to an increased
incidence of infection and thrombosis.
Ports are becoming increasingly more pop-
ular, especially with lower intensity thera-
pies and in older children and adolescents.
Ports are cosmetically more satisfactory, do
not require routine care, and allow for easy
bathing and swimming. However, ports
may be difﬁcult to place and access in obese
or very thin patients. Additionally, the use
of ports for routine blood draws is limited
due to their need to be accessed prior to use.
An external CVC should be used in patients
requiring frequent laboratory monitoring.
External CVCs and ports may be used
immediately after placement. In the case
of a port, the surgeon should be asked to
access the device when it is placed, prior
to development of postoperative edema.
This
allows
immediate
use,
decreasing
patient
discomfort
and
reducing
the
potential for introduction of infection. Ulti-
mately, in cases where an external catheter is
not essential, the decision on the type of
catheter to utilize must include a discussion
with the patient and the family reviewing
the pros and cons of each type of device.
Table 26.2 summarizes the type of CVC to
consider based on diagnosis and subsequent
therapy intensity.
Maintenance
External catheters require daily heparin
ﬂushes
and
periodic
dressing
changes
(see Table 26.1). Families require detailed
education on the care and potential com-
plications of CVCs. They should be taught
sterile technique to access the CVC for
blood draws or ﬂushes and to provide exter-
nal care. Frequency of dressing changes may
be dependent on institution policy, type of
CVC, and local factors such as a wet, dirty,
or loose dressing. At all times, the CVC exit
site should be kept dry and clean. Patients
are instructed to protect it during bathing

and not immerse the dressing or exit site in a
bath, hot tub, or pool. Should this occur, the
dressing should be changed immediately
with careful cleansing of the exit site. Ports
require less care, and heparin ﬂushes, which
are required only monthly, are typically per-
formed by the health care team. No dressing
is needed for implantable devices when they
are not accessed. Each institution has a stan-
dardized approach to the care and mainte-
nanceofCVCsthatisfollowedbystaff,family
members, and home health care agencies.
Complications: mechanical
The use of CVCs can result in a number of
short- and long-term complications. Imme-
diate complications related to CVC placement
include malposition, hemorrhage, pneumo-
thorax, chylothorax, arterial cannulation, car-
diac dysrhythmia, and failure to place the line.
Rarely, complications may occur due to the
anesthetic required for surgical placement.
Long-term complications include mechanical
failure, catheter breakage, leakage, and port
extrusion. Mechanical failures have been
reported in up to 10% of patients and may
result in removal of the CVC. Some types of
external CVCs may be repaired if the break is
distal to the catheter exit site. Children with
implanted ports are at risk for the Huber
needle becoming dislodged during infusion,
leading to extravasation with resultant skin
irritation or breakdown. These require careful
periodic assessment.
Complications: infectious
Infectionisthemostcommoncomplicationof
CVCs.Mostcatheter-relatedinfectionsariseby
one of two mechanisms: (1) infection at the
exit site with migration of the pathogen along
the external catheter surface, and (2) contam-
ination of the hub, leading to intraluminal
colonization and consequent seeding of the
pathogen into the circulation (see Chapter 27
for common pathogens and management of
fever in patients with CVCs). Patients with
CVCs require constant attention for pre-
vention and early recognition of infection.
Despite the meticulous techniques used by
health care providers and caregivers to main-
tain sterility, many children with CVCs will
develop a line infection or bacteremia. Infec-
tion is often related to organisms that
are ubiquitous but can lead to true infection
in the immunosuppressed patient (such as
gut and skin ﬂora), or be due to organisms
introduced with venous access or with blood
product or medication/ﬂuid administration.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylo-
coccus aureus, aerobic Gram-negative bacilli,
and Candida albicans most commonly cause
catheter-related bloodstream infection. Addi-
tionally, development of a thrombus in the
catheter may serve as a nidus for infection.
Occasionally, despite best efforts and appro-
priate antibiotic therapy, the line may be
colonized and need to be removed. Recent
techniques for catheter sterilization include
antibiotic and ethanol locks. Additionally,
many manufacturers have created antibacte-
rial substances bonded to the catheters.
Risk factors for CVC infection include
the placement of an external catheter, young
patient age, multilumen catheter, early
placement (i.e., within 2 weeks of diagnosis
of acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]),
stem cell transplant, solid tumor, lack of
perioperative prophylactic antibiotics, high-
intensity protocol, and placement during
periods of neutropenia. These factors must
be weighed against the beneﬁts of early line
placement, type of line placed, and number
of catheter lumens. The relatively higher
infection rate seen with external catheters
favors the use of implanted catheters when
possible.
Approximately 50% of catheter-related
infections occur locally at the exit site, along
238
Chapter 26

the tunneled catheter or as a “pocket” infec-
tion around the implanted reservoir. Skin
irritation may occur with external CVCs
and requires alteration of the prescribed exit
site care and dressing to avoid repeated
irritation, skin breakdown, infection, and
pain. Patients with local catheter infections
typically have local signs and symptoms
with tenderness on palpation, erythema,
purulent drainage, lack of healing, swelling,
and pain. Severely neutropenic patients
may only have pain and tenderness as these
symptoms do not require the presence of
neutrophils. If drainage is present, the site
should be cultured. Tunnel infections are
characterized by a spreading cellulitis along
the subcutaneous tract of long-term cathe-
ters. The catheter should be removed if the
administration of appropriate parenteral
antibiotics does not result in resolution of
the signs and symptoms within 24 to 48
hours. When evaluating a child with fever
and a CVC, palpate along the tunnel to
assess for tenderness or to express drainage.
Pocket abscesses may need to be surgically
drained and packed and almost always
will require removal of the reservoir and
catheter. Site infections with minor exit site
erythema and tenderness are treated with
topical antibiotics and monitored with care-
ful, daily assessment; systemic antibiotics
should be added for clinical worsening, lack
of improvement, or a positive blood culture
from the line. Tunnel and pocket infections
should be treated with both topical and
systemic antibiotics, as well as a daily sterile
dressing change. The patient should be
treated systemically with broad-spectrum
antibiotics providing good Gram-positive
coverage and be monitored for the devel-
opment of an abscess requiring surgical
drainage. The antibiotic regimen may be
altered with culture results, but if the patient
is neutropenic it should include both broad-
spectrum and directed antibiotic therapy.
Site infections provide an opportunity to
review meticulous local CVC management
with the caregivers.
In addition to site infections, coloniza-
tion of the catheter may occur. In this case,
the patient will have repeatedly positive
cultures with the same organism, often
without systemic symptoms of infection.
In cases of colonization, cultures may
become quickly positive and may persist
through appropriate antibiotic therapy. At
times, catheters may be reseeded from dis-
tant sites of occult infection (e.g., cardiac
vegetations, osteomyelitis, deep abscesses).
The CVC should always be considered
the source of infection in a patient who
presents with fever until proven otherwise.
Fever, chills, or hypotension temporally
related to line ﬂushing increase the likeli-
hood of a line infection. Broad-spectrum
empiric antibiotics should be administered
after drawing cultures from each lumen of
the CVC. Persistent bacteremia despite
appropriate
antibiotic
coverage
(>72
hours), signs of sepsis (hypotension, chills,
persistent fever, cool extremities, delayed
capillary reﬁll), or infection with fungus
or water-borne bacteria (e.g., pseudomonas,
stenotrophomonas) warrant CVC removal.
If placement of a new CVC is deemed
necessary, the patient should ﬁrst complete
an appropriate course of antibiotic therapy
allowing for sufﬁcient healing time and
decreasing the risk of subsequent reinfection
of the new CVC.
CVC infection may be overdiagnosed,
resulting in either prolonged antibiotic
administration or unnecessary removal of
the catheter. Differential time to positivity
is a reliable diagnostic technique to differ-
entiate a true line infection from bacter-
emia. Paired blood samples (aerobic and
anaerobic) from a peripheral vein and the
central catheter are obtained and compared
with respect to time to positivity. If the
culture from the catheter turns positive
2 or more hours before the peripheral
Central Venous Catheters
239

culture, this is diagnostic of a catheter-
related infection. A positive differential
time to positivity may not change manage-
ment, although consideration should be
given to the type and duration of systemic
antibiotic therapy, utility of an antimicro-
bial or ethanol lock, and the need for cath-
eter removal. Additional factors include
the type of catheter, prior history of infec-
tion, current neutrophil count, likelihood
of short term recovery, and current che-
motherapeutic regimen. When a speciﬁc
pathogen has been identiﬁed, antibiotic
therapy should be targeted, with additional
broad empiric coverage in the neutropenic
patient (see Chapter 27). The possibility
of an infected catheter-related thrombus
should be considered, and treatment may
also
involve
thrombolytic
agents
or
anticoagulation.
Assessment and management of
catheter-related thrombosis
Venous
thromboembolism
is
another
common complication of long-term CVCs.
The extent of thrombosis may include the
catheter tip (ball-valve clot), the length of
the catheter (ﬁbrin sheath), or the cathe-
terized vessel (e.g., the upper limb with or
without the central vasculature of the
neck or mediastinum). Catheter-related
venous thromboembolism can result in
signiﬁcant
morbidity,
and
subclinical
thrombosis may occur in up to 50% of
patients with CVCs. The risk of thrombosis
is inﬂuenced by catheter location, insertion
technique, catheter kinking or compres-
sion by a mass or other structure, ratio
of the catheter size to the intraluminal
vessel
diameter,
blood
ﬂow
rheology,
genetic predisposition, and administration
of prothrombotic medications or infusions
(e.g., asparaginase and total parenteral
nutrition). Primary thromboprophylaxis
is not currently recommended as standard
practice; however, it may be warranted in
certain
situations
with
documented
increased risk.
Thrombosis
should
be
suspected
in
patients whose catheter does not ﬂush or
draw easily or in the event of suggestive
clinical ﬁndings (pain or swelling in extrem-
ity, prominent vasculature or swelling on
side of neck/chest with CVC, inability to
successfully access an implanted port). It
should be noted that a line that does not
draw or ﬂush might be occluded by the vessel
wall or a valve. Patients suspected of having
a thrombosis should undergo imaging to
conﬁrm this and determine the extent
(see Figure 26.1). Based on the timing of
line dysfunction or symptom development,
the age of the clot can be approximated.
Additionally, pertinent family history of
thrombosis should be sought out to help
guide the necessity of genetic evaluation for
thrombophilia (see Chapter 10). Finally,
environmental and medication prothrombo-
tic factors should be considered (e.g., immo-
bilization, steroids, and other medications).
Treatment of thrombosis may require
thrombolytic therapy, anticoagulation, or
catheter removal. Below are guidelines for
the assessment and treatment of a suspected
CVC-associated thrombus:
* Examine the catheter for any kinks in the
tubing.
* Reposition the patient; ﬂush the CVC
with normal saline (if possible) and again
attempt to withdraw blood. Have the
patient hold their hands above their head,
turn, cough, or hold their breath.
* Attempt a tissue plasminogen activator
(TPA) dwell if the catheter can be ﬂushed:
* Infants <3 months receive 0.25mg
(0.5mL) per lumen; older children receive
0.5 mg (1 mL) per lumen. Dwell should be
administered for 30 minutes.
* After the ﬁrst dwell, attach an empty 3mL
syringe and attempt to withdraw blood. If
240
Chapter 26

successful, obtain blood work and ﬂush line
per protocol. If unsuccessful, instill a second
TPA dwell for an additional 30 minutes.
* If the TPA dwell is unsuccessful, further
workup is required to determine the extent
of thrombus.
* Obtain a chest radiograph to conﬁrm
appropriate line position.
* Obtain
further
imaging
studies
such as a dye study of the line, ultra-
sound with Doppler ﬂow, or CT with
venography to evaluate for thrombosis
location and extent. Assess for sleeve
thrombus, mechanical failure of the
CVC, or migration of the catheter out-
side the vessel.

* If the catheter becomes functional after
administration of systemic TPA, obtain a
follow-up radiographic study to assess for
clot resolution.
* Remove the catheter if the thrombus
cannot be cleared after 24 to 48 hours.
If the thrombus dissolves, or is stabilized
with normal CVC function, determination
should be made as to the current necessity of
the line and risk for recurrent thrombosis.
If the CVC can be safely removed, some
practitioners recommend short-term pro-
phylactic anticoagulation to mitigate the
risk for rethrombosis (usually 6 weeks to 3
months of low-molecular-weight heparin
[LMWH]). If the line needs to be maintained
and the clot has resolved, the patient should
continue on therapeutic LMWH for 3
months and then switch over to prophylactic
LMWH until the line is removed. For the
patient with a stable clot and a functional
CVC,
therapeutic
anticoagulation
with
LMWH should be continued until approx-
imately 3 months after clot dissolution and
then switched to prophylactic anticoagula-
tion until line removal (see Chapter 10 and
Formulary for dosing guidelines). Addition-
ally, if the patient is determined to have a
genetic predisposition to thrombosis based
on family history or a personal history of
previous thromboembolism, a thrombophi-
lia trait workup should be sent (see Chapter
10 for details). If the patient has multitrait
thrombophilia and therefore a higher risk of
rethrombosis, every effort should be made to
remove the CVC once the risk of having an
indwelling line outweighs the beneﬁt (i.e.,
maintenance therapy in the ALL patient).
If the patient on prophylactic anticoagula-
tion develops rethrombosis, management
should be the same as with the initial clot with
systemic low-dose TPA followed by therapeu-
tic anticoagulation with LMWH until clot
dissolution. If the patient is on therapeutic
anticoagulation with clot extension, the CVC
willneedtoberemoved.Incaseswheretheclot

oagulation is recommended for clot stabiliza-

Management
of Fever in the Child
with Cancer
Children with cancer are at an increased
risk for serious bacterial, viral, and fungal
infections. Many factors contribute to this
susceptibility
in
immunocompromised
children. The two most important deter-
minants of susceptibility to bacterial and
fungal infection are the number of circu-
lating neutrophils (absolute neutrophil
count; ANC) and the duration of severe
neutropenia. Other factors include:
* Underlying disease: leukemia, especially
acute
myelogenous
leukemia
(AML),
advanced stage lymphoma, or other meta-
static solid tumors are at higher risk due to
increased therapy intensity.
* Remission status: patients not in remis-
sion are at higher risk.
* Type of therapy with dose- or time-inten-
sive therapies: administration of high-dose
cytarabine and stem cell transplant confer
the highest risk.
* Nutritional status: malnutrition adversely
affects immune function.
* Disruption of protective barriers such as
skin, mucocutaneous tissues, gastrointesti-
nal tract, and exit sites of catheters.
* Defects in humoral immunity related to
therapy, impaired splenic function, or B-cell
malignancies.
* Defects in cellular immunity such as seen
in patients with T-cell malignancies or those
receiving steroids or radiation; persistence
of lymphopenia due to chemotherapy.
* Colonization from endogenous micro-
ﬂora.
* Presenceofindwellingcathetersorshunts.
The ANC is calculated by multiplying the
percentage of neutrophils (segmented neu-
trophils þ bands) by the total white blood
cell (WBC) count.
Example: WBC ¼ 1.0  109/L, segmented
neutrophils ¼ 10%, bands ¼ 10%
ANC ¼ 20%  1.0  109/L ¼ 0.2  109/L
ANC<1.5  109/L is deﬁned as neutropenia
ANC < 1.0  109/L is deﬁned as moderate
neutropenia
ANC < 0.5  109/L represents severe neu-
tropenia
ANC < 0.1 to 0.2  109/L represents pro-
found neutropenia
In general, patients with an ANC of less than
0.5  109/L or those with dropping counts
after chemotherapy are considered severely
neutropenic. The ANC at time of presenta-
tion with respect to the most recent chemo-
therapy gives important information. For

instance, if a child is neutropenic without
recent myelosuppressive therapy, infection
(and less likely relapse of a hematologic
malignancy) should be considered as the
most likely etiology due to marrow suppres-
sion. In general, the expected nadir in ANC
occurs 7 to 14 days from the start of mye-
losuppressive chemotherapy. This timing
should be considered when assessing the
patient and determining the management
plan. Practitioners may also utilize the abso-
lute phagocyte count (APC), which is the
summation of the ANC and absolute mono-
cyte count, in determining the risk of bac-
terial infection as monocytes also possess
bacteria-ﬁghting
ability.
An
increasing
monocyte count is often seen prior to and
often heralds neutrophil recovery.
Fever is deﬁned as a single temperature
of 38.3C (101.0F) or greater, two tem-
peratures of 38.0 to 38.2C (100.4 to
100.9F) within a 24-hour period, or a
temperature of 38.0 to 38.2C (100.4 to
100.9F) persistently for 1 hour, taken in
the axilla, orally, or by tympanic probe.
Generally, oral and tympanic temperatures
are preferred since the axillary temperature
can be affected by outside temperature. Oral
temperatures preferably are taken without
any recent hot or cold oral intake. Once a
fever is documented, it should be consid-
ered as real no matter what the underlying
circumstances are, even if the patient defer-
vesces without any intervention. Patients
who develop a low-grade fever (38.0C to
38.2C) should be monitored without anti-
pyretics to determine if a fever spike will
occur. Rectal temperatures should never be
taken in potentially neutropenic children.
Fever and neutropenia
Every oncology patient who presents with
febrile neutropenia (FN) is considered sep-
tic until proven otherwise. These children
may have fever as their only symptom of
infection. It should be noted that neutro-
penia will not prevent the patient from
having a temperature spike with infection;
one exception is the patient on steroids
(such as in acute lymphoblastic leukemia
[ALL] induction) who may not mount a
fever with an underlying infection. A careful
clinical
examination
is
critical
as
the
patient’s status may change quickly and
dramatically.
Septic shock results from overwhelming
infection
with
microorganisms
in
the
blood leading to central vascular dilation
with resultant circulatory failure and inad-
equate tissue perfusion. Symptoms of septic
shock include hypotension, tachycardia,
tachypnea, clammy extremities (although
can be warm with initial sepsis), decreased
urine output, and deterioration of mental
status. Although septic shock can be seen
with any organism, the usual culprits with
acute and overwhelming sepsis are Gram-
negative rods.
The most common organisms causing
bacteremia and sepsis are:
* Gram-positive: Staphylococci (coagulase-
negative, Staphylococcus aureus including
methicillin-resistant [MRSA]), streptococci
(a-hemolytic) including Streptococcus viri-
dans and S. mitis
* Gram-negative:Enterobacteriaceae(E.coli,
Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Serratia), Pseudomo-
nas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophi-
lia, Acinetobacter sp.
* Anaerobic: Clostridium difﬁcile, Bacter-
oides sp., Proprionobacterium acnes
Other
pathogens
infecting
cancer
patients include:
* Fungi: Candida sp., Aspergillus sp., zygo-
mycetes, cryptococci
* Viruses: Herpes simplex virus (HSV),
varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovi-
rus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus, respiratory
syncytial virus, adenovirus, inﬂuenza, para-
inﬂuenza, human herpesvirus 6

discharge) may represent a source of
infection as neutropenia diminishes clas-
sicinﬂammatorychanges.Pain,however,
is always a concerning ﬁnding and should
be considered a potential clue to site and
source of infection.
2. Laboratory evaluation
a. Complete blood count (CBC) with
manual differential to determine ANC.
b. Blood cultures from each lumen of the
centralvenouscatheter(CVC);peripheral
culture is necessary if the child does not
have a central line or it is unobtainable
from the central line. Controversy still
exists as to utility of a peripheral blood
culture when cultures are taken from the
line as delayed time to positivity between
these two sources can help determine the
existence of a line infection versus bac-
teremia (see Chapter 26). Do not ﬂush
the catheter after labs are obtained in
the patient with a recent history of high
fever, hypotension, chills, or rigors within
1 hour of ﬂushing the catheter, suggestive
of a line infection. See below under Initial
management.
c. Serum chemistries to include electro-
lytes, liver, and renal function studies.
d. Urinalysis and urine culture (no cath-
eter sample for neutropenic patients).
e. Chest radiograph only if the patient
has ausculatory signs or symptoms of
infection or respiratory compromise.
f. If the child has tenderness over the
sinuses, perform diagnostic imaging to
evaluate for sinusitis (plain radiographs
and/or CT).
g. Patients with symptoms of esophagi-
tis should be evaluated for viral or fungal
causes with serologies and culture, if
possible.
h. Cultures and bacterial Gram stain or
fungal stains from suspicious sites such
as the oropharynx, skin breakdown sites,
and catheter sites.
i. If diarrhea is present, send a stool
sample for stool culture, rotavirus, and
C. difﬁcile antigen.
j. In contrast to nononcology patients, a
lumbar puncture (LP) is not routinely
done as part of a serious bacterial infec-
tion evaluation in patients with FN and
an oncologic diagnosis. If an LP appears
clinically
indicated,
evaluation
for
increased
intracranial
pressure
with
appropriate imaging (i.e., head CT)
should be done and the pediatric oncol-
ogy attending notiﬁed prior to the pro-
cedure. An adequate platelet count and
at least near-normal coagulation studies
are also required in advance of the LP.
k. If another implanted device is present
(e.g.,
ventriculoperitoneal
shunt
or
Ommaya reservoir), do not attempt to
obtain a culture without speaking to
the appropriate attending physicians.
Intervention by a neurosurgeon may
be required. It is uncommon for these
devices to be the source of infection if
it has been more than 2 to 4 weeks since
they were inserted.
Initial management
Risk stratiﬁcation models for pediatric
oncology patients with FN to determine
which patients are low risk and could poten-
tially be managed as outpatients and which
are higher risk and should be monitored as
inpatients have yet to be validated and
widely accepted. Adult studies suggest that
patients with predicted time of severe neu-
tropenia of 7 days and no concerning
clinical signs including focal infection such
as pneumonia, new abdominal pain, or
hypotension can be safely managed as out-
patients. With the lack of data in pediatric
patients, we continue to recommend that
parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics be
started immediately and the patient admit-
ted to the hospital. FN is considered an

247

oncologic emergency and all measures
should be taken to ensure prompt evaluation
and treatment, with a goal of 60 minutes
between presentation and the initiation of
antibiotics. Antibiotics should be chosen
based on microbial prevalence and antibi-
otic sensitivity patterns at each institution.
In general, due to the more acute risk from
Gram-negative organisms, broad coverage
for these organisms (including Pseudomo-
nas) should be initiated. Many combina-
tions of antibiotics are effective and accept-
able regimens include:
1. Monotherapy:
Fourth generation cephalosporin (anti-
pseudomonal b-lactam)
Cefepime 150 mg/kg/day intravenous
(IV) divided q8h
Carbapenem
Imipenem 50 mg/kg/day IV divided
q6–8h
Meropenem 60 to 120 mg/kg/day IV
divided q8h
Piperacillin/Tazobactam
Zosyn
240
to
300 mg/kg/day
IV
divided q8h
2. Dual therapy (antipseudomonal b-lac-
tam plus an aminoglycoside):
Ceftazidime 100 to 150 mg/kg/day IV
divided q8h and
Tobramycin 7.5 mg/kg/day IV divided
q8h or 7–9 mg/kg/dose IV daily
Other antibiotics used in speciﬁc circum-
stances (see below) are:
1. Anaerobic drugs:
Clindamycin 40 mg/kg/day IV divided
q6–8h
Metronidazole 30 mg/kg/day (loading
dose 15 mg/kg) IV divided q6h
2. Vancomycin 60 mg/kg/day IV divided
q8h
Patients with AML receiving high-dose
cytarabine (Ara-C) should have vancomy-
cin as part of their empiric regimen in
combination with broad-spectrum coverage
due to the high risk of S. viridans infec-
tion with its accompanying septic shock
and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Cytarabine is known to alter mucosal integ-
rity and allow entry of this organism.
Patients with S. viridans sepsis have a high
rate of morbidity and mortality. They
typically require prolonged hospitalization
following chemotherapy until neutrophil
recovery occurs to allow emergent initiation
of treatment in the event of fever or other
signs of impending shock or sepsis. Other
indications for vancomycin in the empiric
regimen include:
* Presentation with hypotension or other
evidence of shock
* Mucositis due to chemotherapy
* Patients with prior history of a-hemolytic
streptococcus bacteremia
* Catheter site infection or other skin
breakdown
* Patients colonized with resistant organ-
isms treatable only with vancomycin
* Vegetations on echocardiogram
Anaerobic therapy should be considered in
patients
who
have
signiﬁcant
mucosal
breakdown, perianal skin breakdown, peri-
toneal signs, or in cases of typhilitis with
presumed or proven C. difﬁcile infection.
For patients on dual therapy with an
aminoglycoside, trough levels should be
monitored weekly due to the risks of
nephro- and ototoxicity, especially in those
receiving other nephro- or ototoxic drugs
(e.g., vancomycin, furosemide). For patients
on therapy with vancomycin, trough levels
should be monitored for toxicity as well as
medication effectiveness, with goal trough
levels of 10 to 15 mcg/mL. Dose increases
are often required in pediatric patients to
reach these levels. Monitor daily electro-
lytes, ﬂuid balance, renal function studies,
and ensure adequate hydration. Patients
with renal dysfunction should receive renal
248
Chapter 27

dosing with more frequent trough levels to
prevent toxicity.
Any patient that presents with hypoten-
sion, chills, rigors, or fever immediately
following, or within 1 hour, of central
venous catheter ﬂushing should be seen
emergently due to the risk of bacteremia
and septic shock. In our practice, we elect
not to use the central venous line for IV
ﬂuids or medication administration initially
in this situation due to the risk of infusing
a large amount of bacteria into the blood-
stream and worsening the signs of clinical
sepsis. Patients should have central catheter
cultures, placement of a peripheral IV
with peripheral cultures, administration
of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and a ﬂuid
bolus (e.g., NS/LR 20 mL/kg), if necessary.
The central catheter should not be ﬂushed
or utilized until the patient improves clin-
ically with defervescence, resolution of
hypotension, and negative follow-up blood
cultures. If the line cannot be ﬂushed, a TPA
dwell can be attempted; if unsuccessful, the
line will need to be removed (see Chap-
ter 26). It is advisable to give an IV ﬂuid
bolus prior to reusing the catheter in the
event the patient again develops symptoms
of bacteremia with hypotension following
the ﬂush. In the event the initial blood
culture from the catheter is positive, the
clinician will need to decide whether to
remove the catheter or attempt to reuse it
depending on the patient’s clinical condi-
tion and the type of organism that is grow-
ing. Patients that have persistent fever and
Gram-negative organisms may do best with
removal of the line; patients that have defer-
vesced and are looking clinically well can
generally have their line reused and ulti-
mately salvaged.
Modiﬁcation of initial antibiotic
treatment
Patients should be assessed daily for changes
in vital signs, persistence of fever or change in
the fever curve, presence of new symptoms or
signs of infection with a meticulous physical
examination, and results of prior cultures
and diagnostic imaging performed (see
Figure 27.2). The status of catheters should
be assessed (site, function, and concern for
thrombosis). Daily blood cultures and a CBC
with differential should be done on persis-
tently febrile patients. Determination of the
ANC is also important for patients who have
defervesced and have negative cultures to
determine the length of appropriate therapy.
When theneutropenic childbecomesafebrile
(no fever for 24 hours) and cultures are
negative
(obtained
daily
while
febrile),
broad-spectrum coverage should be contin-
ued until there is evidence of adequate mar-
row recovery and an appropriate period of
therapy for any initially positive cultures has
been provided. Resolution of neutropenia is
deﬁned as an ANC of >0.5 109/L and
evidence of bone marrow recovery is an ANC
of >0.2 109/L and rising on 2 consecutive
days. Some practitioners also use an APC of
>0.5  109/L as sufﬁcient evidence of recov-
ery from neutropenia. When the patient no
longer has fever, has negative blood cultures,
and has signs of neutrophil recovery, the
antibiotics may be safely discontinued and
the child discharged, assuming an appropri-
ate treatment length for any positive cultures
has been provided. Should the child have any
local evidence of infection such as diarrhea or
skin breakdown, appropriate therapy should
continue, but in the outpatient setting.
Modiﬁcation should be made to the
initial broad-spectrum antibiotic regimen
if a source of infection is found to explain
the initial fever, or the fever persists for
more than 3 to 7 days. If the source of the
infection is a catheter site with accompa-
nying signs or symptoms of inﬂammation
(discharge,
palpable
tenderness,
local
abscess), vancomycin should be added for
Gram-positive coverage. If the source is
perianal,
gingival,
or
intra-abdominal,
Management of Fever in the Child with Cancer
249

anaerobic coverage should be added to the
regimen (clindamycin, metronidazole, or
meropenem).
Vancomycin is the most effective anti-
biotic against skin ﬂora such as coagulase
negative staphylococci (i.e., S. epidermidis)
as well as mouth ﬂora, most commonly
streptococcal species (S. viridans, Peptostrep-
tococcus).
Vancomycin
is
also
effective
against bacillus nonanthracis species that
can
be
true
pathogens
in
the
immunocompromised
patient.
Finally,
though rarely seen, MRSA should be a
consideration in the very sick patient.
Vancomycin should be used judiciously due
to emerging resistance patterns such as van-
comycin-resistant
enterococcus
(VRE).
Vancomycin should not be part of the
empiric antibiotic regimen unless the insti-
tutional experience and susceptibility pat-
terns require it or there are special circum-
stances (see above).

Protracted fever may signify the presence
of a second or previously untreated infec-
tion. Patients should be reassessed daily for
new signs or symptoms of infection and
appropriate interventions and studies per-
formed.
Antibiotic-induced
colitis
may
occur after any antibiotic. C. difﬁcile over-
growth may be asymptomatic, lead to mild
diarrhea, or may have moderate-to-severe
diarrhea and abdominal pain. The patient
may also develop pseudomembranous coli-
tis with peritoneal signs, mucosal erosions,
and bloody diarrhea. Since C. difﬁcile is a
normal bowel inhabitant, the toxin must
be documented to diagnose this condition.
If oral therapy is possible, vancomycin
(40 mg/kg divided q8h) or metronidazole
(30 mg/kg divided q6h) may be given; in the
patient unable to tolerate oral medications,
IV metronidazole (same as PO dose) should
be given. Abdominal pain may also be due
to infection with aerobic Gram-negative
bacteria, enterococcus (which no cephalo-
sporin covers in vivo), or anaerobes.
If the patient is determined to have a
catheter-associated bacteremia with a spe-
ciﬁc organism, broad-spectrum antibiotics
should be continued with addition of anti-
biotics
as
needed
to
ensure
adequate
coverage of the identiﬁed organism until
sensitivity patterns are reported. If daily
cultures are persistently positive with the
same organism for 72 hours after initiation
of appropriate antibiotics, it will be neces-
sary to remove the catheter. In addition,
several organisms including S. aureus, Pseu-
domonas, B. cereus, Corynebacterium, Myco-
bacterium sp., Stenotrophomonas, and fungi
usually require line removal. General care
measures are as follows:
* Hand washing with clean or sterile gloves
prior to manipulation of CVC.
* Monitor CVC site on a daily basis; change
CVC dressing weekly.
* Assess site for skin infection (including
tunnel infection) with any fever.
* In multilumen devices, the antibiotic
infusion should be rotated among the
lumens as infection may not be limited to
one lumen. If one particular lumen has the
positive blood culture, it is reasonable to
run the majority of the antibiotic through
this lumen.
* Daily blood cultures while febrile or if
growth is present (from each lumen of
CVC), until afebrile and negative cultures
for 3 days.
* Assess cardiac valves for vegetations with
an echocardiogram for repeatedly positive
cultures with Gram-positive organisms.
* If bacteremia persists for more than 3
days of appropriate therapy, the catheter
should be removed.
For patients with a history of multiple
positive cultures or a difﬁcult to eradicate
organism, consideration should be made
for the use of ethanol or vancomycin lock
therapy to possibly prevent the need for line
removal. Ethanol locks should not be used
with polyurethane catheters (PowerLine,
MedComp) as ethanol will damage the
catheter material.
Duration of therapy
When a pathogen has been identiﬁed, its
antibiotic susceptibility pattern must be
determined and appropriate antibiotic cov-
erage provided along with broad-spectrum
coverage until the patient is afebrile and has
evidence of bone marrow recovery. Once
the child is afebrile and the ANC recovers,
antibiotics can be tailored to the speciﬁc
organism for a 10- to 14-day course, with
day 1 being the day of the ﬁrst negative
culture.
Patients that defervesce but do not have
recovery of the ANC should continue on
broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent sec-
ondary infection. Some practitioners may
discontinue antibiotics after 14 days if the
patient continues to be neutropenic but
Management of Fever in the Child with Cancer
251

afebrile, although our general practice is to
continue until count recovery.
Empiric antifungal therapy
When FN persists for 4 to 7 days, empiric
treatment should be broadened to include
fungal prophylaxis. The risk of fungal
infection is directly related to the duration
of neutropenia, which is secondary to the
severity of chemotherapy or radiation
cytotoxicity. Thus, patients undergoing
more intensive therapy such as for AML,
relapsed ALL, and hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation are at highest risk of an
invasive fungal infection. The major caus-
ative fungi are Aspergillus and Candida,
with mortality as high as 30% to 60% with
documented invasive disease. Fungal infec-
tions can be difﬁcult to detect due to the
frequent absence of localizing signs or
symptoms and lack of means of detection
by culture. Prompt diagnostic assessment
and initiation of antifungal empiric therapy
are paramount for improving outcomes in
these patients.
Empiric
antifungal
therapy
prevents
fungal overgrowth in patients with pro-
longed neutropenia. It also provides early
treatment of clinically occult infection.
Clinical trials have found that antifungal
treatment of children with persistent or
recurring fever reduced morbidity and
mortality from invasive fungal disease. This
is especially true in patients with profound
neutropenia not receiving antifungal pro-
phylaxis. The current recommendation is
that high risk groups (i.e., those expected to
have neutropenia >7 days) should receive
antifungal prophylaxis during episodes of
prolonged FN.
A meticulous physical examination,
laboratory assessments, and radiographic
studies in search of deep-seated infections
are also warranted after this 4 to 7 day time
frame. Particular attention should be paid
to the skin examination as it can reveal
fungal nodules. Fungal cultures should be
sent from the blood and urine as well as
any suspicious skin site. In addition, the
patient should have a serum galactoman-
nan performed to screen for Aspergillus
infection. CT imaging of the chest, as well
as imaging of other symptomatic areas,
should be performed. It should be noted
that in the severely neutropenic patient,
areas of infection may not be appreciated
on imaging until neutrophil recovery has
occurred. In these cases, the patient will
generally have continued or new fevers with
count recovery that should alert the clini-
cian to the need for repeat CT imaging
which should include the sinuses, chest,
and abdomen.
Commonly used antifungal agents for
empiric therapy in prolonged FN include:
1. Echinocandins
Micafungin
Prophylaxis 1 to 2 mg/kg IV daily
Treatment 3 to 4 mg/kg IV daily
Caspofungin
Anidulafungin
2. Triazoles
Voriconazole
Posaconazole
3. Amphotericin B
4. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B
The echinocandins have replaced ampho-
tericin B as the empiric antifungal agent of
choice due to their once daily dosing, sig-
niﬁcantly decreased side effect proﬁle, and
broad coverage. Echinocandins are fungi-
cidal to most Candida species and at least
fungistatic against Aspergillus species. They
also have limited activity against Fusarium
species and Zygomycetes. The triazoles are
derivatives of ﬂuconazole with broad-spec-
trum antifungal activity and limited side
effects. Of note, the triazoles are fungicidal
against Aspergillus species. In general, we
utilize
the
echinocandins
as
ﬁrst-line
252
Chapter 27

empiric therapy and consider adjustment in
patients that are worsening clinically or have
signs consistent with Aspergillus infection.
Patients on either an echinocandin or tria-
zole should be monitored closely for hepatic
toxicity; voriconazole may also cause visual
disturbance that is more common in adult
patients. Posaconazole may provide better
coverage against Aspergillus species but is
only available as an oral medication and
clinical trial data are limited in pediatric
patients.
Amphotericin B remains the most widely
active antifungal agent but has generally
been replaced due to its signiﬁcant toxicity
proﬁle, most notably nephrotoxicity and
infusional toxicity. Fever, chills, nausea,
metabolic abnormalities, hypokalemia and
other electrolyte disturbances, and hepatic
toxicity can all occur. In order to treat, and
possibly prevent, some of these complica-
tions, several measures are taken. Patients
with a history of nephrotoxicity may beneﬁt
from receiving pre- and postinfusion NS
boluses
and
diuretics.
Premedications
including
acetaminophen,
diphenhydra-
mine, and meperidine may be given to treat
or prevent acute symptoms related to the
infusion
(fever,
chills,
rigors,
nausea).
Hydrocortisone
can
also
be
added
to
address infusion-related toxicity. Use of
liposomal formulations of amphotericin B
(Ambisome and Abelcet) results in signiﬁ-
cantly fewer adverse events, but they are
much more expensive than amphotericin B.
Viral infection
Immunosuppressed children are able to tol-
erate many viral infections without difﬁ-
culty. However, defects in cellular immunity
predispose them to unusually severe infec-
tions with certain viruses, particularly the
herpes family of viruses. Primary varicella
infection is associated with high morbidity
and mortality. In transplant patients, pri-
mary infection or reactivation with cyto-
megalovirus (CMV) is an important cause
of interstitial pneumonitis, marrow aplasia,
and other infections. Antiviral drugs are
available for a limited number of infections
including herpes simplex virus (HSV), var-
icella zoster virus (VZV), CMV, and inﬂu-
enza and should be utilized in the treatment
of immunocompromised patients. Other
patients may also be candidates for prophy-
laxis (e.g., solid organ transplant patients
and patients with a prior history of infection
on therapy).
Patients with documented infection
with HSV should be treated with IV acy-
clovir (30 mg/kg/day if <12 years; 15 mg/
kg/day for 12 years divided TID for 7 to 14
days). Infection with VZV is potentially life
threatening and therefore chemotherapy
should be stopped while treating with IV
acyclovir (30 mg/kg/day divided TID for 7
to 10 days or until all lesions are crusted and
no new lesions have appeared for 24 to 48
hours). It is important to monitor renal
function and ensure adequate ﬂuid intake
due
to
potential
nephrotoxicity
from
acyclovir.
Patients
with
symptomatic
primary
CMV infection or reactivation can be trea-
ted with ganciclovir (10 mg/kg/day IV
divided q12h for 2 to 4 weeks until resolu-
tion of viremia by polymerase chain reac-
tion). Patients with persistent infection
may require longer therapy or may have
resistant
disease and require alternate
therapy with foscarnet or cidofovir. Of
note, ganciclovir can be myelosuppressive,
whereas foscarnet and cidofovir are quite
nephrotoxic. Concomitant therapy with
intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may
be beneﬁcial especially in the setting of
CMV pneumonitis. Data regarding pro-
phylactic therapy in this setting is lacking,
although once daily dosing can be consid-
ered in patients that complete a course of
Management of Fever in the Child with Cancer
253

antiviral therapy and remain neutropenic
or severely immunocompromised.
Patients who develop inﬂuenza while on
therapy should be treated with neuramini-
dase inhibitors (i.e., oseltamivir for children
1 year of age, twice daily for 5 days) to
reduce symptom duration and severity of
disease. Oseltamivir may also be given as
daily prophylaxis for 5 days to patients that
have been exposed to the virus. If given as
treatment, it is most effective when given
within 48 hours of symptom onset.
Pneumocystis jiroveci
pneumonia
Pneumocystis jiroveci is now considered an
atypical fungus and is a ubiquitous organ-
ism that may cause severe or fatal pneumo-
nitis
in
immunocompromised
patients
(most notably patients with HIV and those
being treated for cancer). Patients typically
develop a rapid onset of fever in association
with tachypnea and other symptoms of
respiratory compromise such as nasal ﬂar-
ing and intercostal retractions. Lung sounds
may be clear and typically patients do not
have rales. Hypoxemia is evident by pulse
oximetry and arterial blood gas. Chest radi-
ography or CT shows an interstitial pattern.
Without appropriate therapy, patients rap-
idly progress to respiratory failure.
Diagnosis is made by demonstrating the
organism by Gomori methanamine silver
stain on a sample obtained by induced spu-
tum, bronchoalveolar lavage, percutaneous
needle biopsy, or open lung biopsy. Patients
who are at risk and present with the classic
signs and symptoms should be treated while
awaiting deﬁnitive diagnosis, given the
rapidity of clinical deterioration.
For documented or highly suspected
infection with P. jiroveci, trimethoprim/sul-
famethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is the treatment
of choice, at a dose based on the TMP
component of 15 mg/kg/day IV divided
q8h for 14 to 21 days. If the patient fails
to respond to TMP/SMX within 72 hours,
or develops this infection while on prior
TMP/SMX prophylaxis with good compli-
ance, initiate therapy with pentamidine,
4 mg/kg IV daily. In patients with moderate
or severe proven infection, concomitant
administration of corticosteroids may be
beneﬁcial with IV methylprednisolone or
prednisone given 2 to 4 times per day for
5 to 7 days, followed by a taper over 1 to 2
weeks.
New sites of infection
New or persistent fever and neutropenia
may be associated with the development
of new sites of infection due to continued
severe
immunosuppression.
Particular
symptoms may provide clues to site and
potential pathogen.
1. Burning retrosternal pain may be esoph-
agitis from Candida sp. or HSV. Cytotoxic
treatment may also cause severe pain due to
mucosal erosions. Empiric micafungin or
acyclovir, or both, may be needed. Esoph-
agitis may also be bacterial, especially as a
result of Gram-positive aerobes.
2. Pulmonary inﬁltrates may be due to
resistant bacteria, Pneumocystis, fungi, or
viruses. Neutropenic patients may not show
evidence of pulmonary inﬁltrates due to
lack of an appropriate local inﬂammatory
response. However, with the recovery of the
ANC, these sites of infection may become
evident. If FN has been less than 7 days,
pulmonary inﬁltrates are very likely to be of
bacterial origin. If the neutropenia persists
for greater than 7 days, the patient is at
particularly high risk for fungal infection.
Bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum
may identify Pneumocystis, viruses, or fungi.

evaluation must be considered. It is impor-
tant to remember that the child may rapidly
become very ill and this decision must be
made expeditiously after discussion between
the oncologist, surgeon, radiologist, pulmo-
nologist, as well as the patient and family.
Other supportive measures
Granulocyte
colony-stimulating
factor
(G-CSF) may be indicated in the setting
of FN; however, there are no speciﬁc stan-
dards for its use. Therapy with 5 mcg/kg/day
subcutaneously is recommended under cer-
tain conditions in which the clinical course
is likely to worsen before the anticipated
marrow recovery (see Chapter 25). Patients
who remain severely neutropenic with life-
threatening infections should receive G-
CSF. Granulocyte transfusions may be con-
sidered in the setting of profound neutro-
penia and sepsis, especially an invasive bac-
terial or fungal infection that is not improv-
ing on appropriate therapy with expected
continuation of profound neutropenia (see
Chapter 5). However, such transfusions
are becoming increasingly more difﬁcult
to obtain.
Fever in the nonneutropenic
oncology patient
The
febrile,
nonneutropenic
patient
remains susceptible to infection secondary
to immune dysfunction and often second-
ary to the presence of a CVC. These patients
should have a careful assessment with his-
tory, physical examination, and pertinent
laboratory studies as in the febrile neutro-
penic patient. Patients with localizing ﬁnd-
ings should have appropriate diagnostic
procedures. Clinical judgment must be uti-
lized to determine the risk for the patient
without an obvious source of infection.
Issues in the social history such as family
reliability, compliance, and ability to travel
to the outpatient center must be factored
into a decision plan. If the patient has
recently received
chemotherapy
and is
expected to reach a nadir in the next few
days, consideration should be given to more
frequent assessment or hospital admission.
As with the neutropenic patient, blood
cultures should be drawn and empiric anti-
biotics initiated. The risk for Pseudomonas
is signiﬁcantly decreased in the patient
without severe neutropenia and therefore
ceftriaxone IV/IM at 50 mg/kg (maximum
2 g) can be given daily while febrile in the
outpatient setting in the otherwise well-
appearing child for at least the ﬁrst 48
hours, while awaiting results of the blood
culture. Hospitalization may be required
in patients who are persistently febrile with
a dropping ANC and in those with a pos-
itive blood culture or the development of
localizing signs.

Acute Pain
Management in the
Inpatient Setting
Pain is a common problem for children with
hematologic or oncologic conditions, as it
can result both from the condition itself and
from its management. A number of studies
have demonstrated that effective pain man-
agement not only increases a patient’s com-
fort level but can also effect long-term
changes in a patient’s pain threshold, and,
in critically ill patients, it has been demon-
strated to improve morbidity and mortality.
Despite this, other studies have demon-
strated that pediatric pain management is
often suboptimal. This results from percep-
tions on the parts of both parents and care
providers that pain is less frequent or less
severe than is the case, or from concerns of
causing dependence or addiction.
The management of chronic pain is a
frequent challenge for pediatric hematologists
and oncologists, but is outside the scope of this
chapter. For pain management at the end of
life, see Chapter 29. For pain management in
patients with sickle cell disease, see Chapter 3.
The World Health Organization
analgesic ladder
In 1986 the World Health Organization
presented
the
analgesic
ladder
as
a
framework that physicians could use when
developing
treatment
plans
for
cancer
pain, paving the way for signiﬁcant im-
provements in its management. Over the
subsequent 25 years, it has undergone much
scrutiny and several modiﬁcations have
been proposed. A recent adaptation is pre-
sented in Figure 28.1.
The cornerstone of the ladder rests on
ﬁve simple recommendations that remain
valid today:
1. The oral form of medication should be
chosen whenever possible.
2. Analgesics should be given at regular
intervals. It is necessary to respect the dura-
tion of the medication’s efﬁcacy and to
prescribe doses at speciﬁc intervals in accor-
dance with the patient’s level of pain. The
dose should be adjusted until the patient is
comfortable.
3. Analgesics should be prescribed accord-
ing to pain intensity as evaluated by a scale
of intensity of pain. The prescription must
be given according to the level of the
patient’s pain and not according to the
medical staff’s perception of the pain.
4. Dosing of pain medication should be
adapted to the individual. The correct dos-
age is one that will allow adequate relief of

pain. The dosing should be adapted to
achieve the best balance between the anal-
gesic effect and the side effects.
5. Analgesics should be prescribed with a
constant concern for detail. The regularity
of analgesic administration is crucial for the
adequate treatment of pain.
It is important to remember that these are
guidelines and that there are situations
where a stepwise approach to pain is not
the best choice for management. For exam-
ple, management of sickle cell vaso-occlusive
crises typically involves early introduction of
step 3 medications without waiting for the
patient to fail step 1 and 2 therapies.
Assessment of pain
The accurate and reproducible assessment
of pain is essential to effective management,
allowing the provider to determine when
intervention is necessary and to more
objectively measure the response to inter-
vention. However, the subjective nature of
pain and the impact of developmental stage
on the best method of assessment have
made its measurement a challenge. As a
result, a variety of pediatric pain assessment
scales have been developed to assist in this
process.
Neonates and infants
The Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS),
developed at the Children’s Hospital of
Eastern Ontario, is a widely used method
of assessing pain in this patient population.
It evaluates a series of six parameters, with a
range of scores between 0 and 7. Scores
above 3 are considered indicative of a pain
level sufﬁcient to require intervention. The
scale is presented in Table 28.1. Its major
limitation is that it may underestimate the
level of pain in infants who are too ill to
respond appropriately or are receiving a
paralyzing agent.

to describe their pain or use an interactive

an alternative similar to the NIPS that allows
the subjective evaluation of pain-related
behaviors by another individual. One of the
more commonly used assessment tools is
the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability
(FLACC) Behavior Scale. Developed at the
University of Michigan as a tool to assess
postoperative pain, it has been shown to
reliably measure pain in a variety of clinical
situations. It is presented in Table 28.2. The
range of possible scores is from 0 to 10,
consistent
with
other
commonly
used
numerical rating scales used for older
children.
School aged and older children
Children 5 years of age and older have been
shown to have the ability to accurately rate
their level of pain using a numerical rating
scale. A commonly used tool is the Wong–
Baker FACES scale, presented in Figure 28.2.
Developed in the early 1980s, it remains one
of the most widely used tools for assessing
pain in both children and adults.
When pain assessment scales are used
appropriately they can be very valuable in
helping the care team know whether their

appropriate or need to be adjusted. How-
ever, there is no “magic number” that indi-
cates when interventions need to be initi-
ated. Studies consistently show that there is
little correlation between a child’s pain score
and their perception as to whether or not
they need pain medication. Therefore, in
situations where patients are likely to have
pain, it is essential to question them regu-
larly regarding their need for medication.
Pain pharmacology
Pain can be subdivided into two categories,
nociceptive and neuropathic. Acute pain in
children is most often nociceptive, and a
variety of drugs can be used to treat this pain.
Much of the information regarding this ther-
apy is empiric, as there are few formal drug
studies for many of these agents, especially in
children less than 12. Nonsteroidal anti-
inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opiates, mus-
cle relaxants, local anesthetics, and tramadol
can be used. Some other adjuvant therapies
can also be utilized, such as psychological
intervention, distraction, and biofeedback.
When treating pain in neonates it is
important to remember that several factors
can modify their response and clearance of
drugs. They have increased body water con-
tent and decreased fat, which can alter drug
distribution. A relative increase in blood
ﬂow to the brain and a somewhat “leaky”
blood–brain barrier can cause a prolonga-
tion of drug effect. Renal clearance of drugs
can be relatively decreased up to 1 year of
age. Hepatic enzymes are initially immature,
but these mature quickly. Children 2 to 6
years of age develop a larger relative hepatic
size for weight and often metabolize drugs
more quickly than younger or older chil-
dren; this can translate to a need for larger
doses of drug given more frequently to
achieve adequate analgesia. Variations in
age, weight, blood ﬂow, and organ function
can all affect effective drug dosing.
Step 1 therapy: nonopioid
analgesics
Drugs that are commonly used for step 1
therapy of pain in children are presented in
Table 28.3. These should be ﬁrst-line therapy
for pain unless the clinical situation dictates
that therapy should begin at a higher step.
The use of NSAIDs in children with can-
cer is generally discouraged due to the com-
mon occurrence of thrombocytopenia in this
population and concern for an increased risk
of bleeding due to an inhibition of platelet
function. However, there have been no large,
controlledtrialsdemonstratingthevalidityof
this concern. Several clinical trials have dem-
onstrated that ibuprofen can safely be used
following dental surgery, tonsillectomy, and
neurosurgery in healthy children and in vitro
data suggest that ibuprofen causes no signif-
icant prolongation of the platelet function
assay PFA-100.

treatment with step 2 agents. In the United
States, the most common agents used are
those that combine acetaminophen with
a weak opioid. These include codeine or
hydrocodone, although there is some dis-
agreement about the inclusion of hydroco-
done
in
the
weak
opioid
category.
Commonly used agents in this category are
presented in Table 28.4.
It is important to remember that the
designation “weak opioid” does not translate
to “without side effects.” The use of codeine
and hydrocodone can cause the same side
effects seen with stronger opioids: respiratory
depression, hypoxia, nausea, vomiting, pru-
ritus, constipation, physical tolerance, and
dependence. Although the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) classiﬁes them as
Schedule III medications, the risks of abuse
and diversion still exist.
Step 3 therapy: strong opioids
Patients not responding to step 2 therapy or
whose condition indicates the need for
stronger pain therapy at the outset are can-
didates for step 3 therapy. All of the med-
ications in this category are strong opioids.
They act by binding to m-receptors in the
spinal cord and central nervous system
(CNS). These receptors are also found
throughout the body, and binding to
peripheral sites accounts for many of the
side
effects
seen
with
opiate
therapy.
Opioids vary both by their duration of
action and by the emotional effect they
produce. Meperidine and oxycodone typi-
cally cause euphoria; conversely, morphine
more commonly causes dysphoria. Equiva-
lent doses of the strong opioids and the
pharmacokinetics of their oral formulations
are presented in Table 28.5.

Chapter 28

Oral starting doses of step 3 medications
are presented in Table 28.6. It is important
to remember that patients with severe
chronic pain will often be on doses much
larger than this due to tolerance. Tactics
such as narcotic substitution can be used to
deal with tolerance or with side effects
resulting from large doses. However, these
steps should be performed under the guid-
ance of individuals who are well versed in
such measures. Transdermal fentanyl has
not been included; practitioners familiar
with its usage should transition patients
to this agent when deemed necessary.
Step 4 therapy
As can be seen in Figure 28.1, step 4 therapy
does
not
introduce
new
medications.
Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps
are listed; this does not refer to short-term
PCA pump use such as following surgery or
to deal with postchemotherapy mucositis
or sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis. Rather, it
refers to long-term, ambulatory PCA pump
use for severe chronic pain. With the
increased availability of highly concen-
trated oral narcotics and novel delivery
systems, the use of home PCA therapy has
declined signiﬁcantly. Additional step 4
therapies include nerve blocks, epidural
injections, and other alternative interven-
tions routinely provided by a specialized
pain service.

with chronic pain, has been clearly demon-
strated in a number of clinical settings.
These include:
* Minimizing postoperative pain and anx-
iety through the use of preoperative inter-
ventions before painful procedures. These
include the explanation of the event in
developmentally appropriate terms, mini-
mizing wait times once the patient arrives in
the operating room, child-friendly waiting
spaces, and cognitive-behavioral therapies
(CBT) such as directed imagery, deep
breathing, and role playing. These interven-
tions are typically provided and coordinated
by the child-life program.
* The use of CBT, relaxation therapy, and
biofeedback to decrease the perception of
pain among children suffering from chronic
pain caused by cancer, headache, and
abdominal pain.
* The use of CBT, relaxation, self-hypno-
sis, biofeedback, and social support groups
to decrease painful episodes and improve
quality of life in patients with sickle cell
disease.
It is vital that child-life workers become
involved with children admitted with a pos-
sible diagnosis of cancer very shortly after
admission. Data indicate that psychological
interventions are most effective in decreas-
ing anxiety related to painful procedures
when initiated before the ﬁrst painful expe-
rience. It is also important to obtain input
from a psychologist early on for children
with conditions causing chronic pain so that
appropriate interventions can be started.

Palliative Care
The World Health Organization deﬁnes
pediatric palliative care as care that “aims
to improve the quality of life of patients
facing life-threatening illnesses, and their
families, through the prevention and relief
of suffering by early identiﬁcation and treat-
ment of pain and other problems, whether
physical, psychosocial, or spiritual.” It is the
active total care of the child’s body, mind,
and spirit, and also involves giving support
to the family. It begins when illness is diag-
nosed,
and
continues
irrespective
of
whether or not a child receives disease-
directed treatment. It requires that health
providers evaluate and alleviate a child’s
physical, psychological, and social distress
at all times during their treatment. To be
effective, it requires a broad multidiscip-
linary approach that includes the family and
makes
use
of
available
community
resources. However, it can be successfully
implemented even if community resources
are limited. Palliative care can and should be
provided in tertiary-care facilities, commu-
nity health centers, and at home.
This deﬁnition contains several concepts
that deserve consideration. It contains the
broadly deﬁned term “life-threatening” that
includes situations in which a cure is pos-
sible, instead of the more limited “life-limit-
ing” that includes only those conditions for
which there is no realistic hope of cure.
There is a role for palliative care for all
children diagnosed with cancer, even those
whose cancers have an excellent prognosis
with appropriate therapy. It also applies to
the large number of children with life-
threatening nononcologic conditions. The
deﬁnition stresses the importance of “early
identiﬁcation and treatment of pain and
other problems.” Palliative care is not syn-
onymous with “end-of-life” care; palliative
care must begin at the time of diagnosis and
continue on throughout the period of dis-
ease-directed therapy. It also must include
many
resources
from
throughout
the
patient’s and family’s range of experience:
physicians, nurses, social workers, psychol-
ogists, spiritual counselors, and a variety of
other support personnel chosen because of
each child’s unique situation. During any
hospitalization, an important responsibility
of the medical team is to ensure that
each child has access to all needed services
and is being supported to the greatest
extent possible.
Individualized care planning
and coordination
At the time of diagnosis, parents and care-
givers of children with life-threatening ill-
ness have two goals: a care-directed goal of

cure and a comfort-directed goal of decreas-
ing suffering. Introducing palliative care
principles early on in the care process is
respectful and supportive of these goals.

in making care decisions for children
undergoing bone marrow transplantation,
the model is useful in helping to deﬁne what
care options are acceptable to the patient and
family given the prognosis and goals of treat-
ment. Key concepts in this model include the
establishment of a close and caring relation-
ship with the patient and family, clarifying
patient and family values and priorities,
determining the goals of care based on the
patient’sandfamily’sunderstandingofprog-
nosis, and allowing them to choose from

available goal-directed treatment options.
From this foundation, the members of the
care team can coordinate the provision of
care to ensure the social, psychological, and
emotional needsofthepatient and family are
addressed at the same time that appropriate
medical care is provided.
End of life care
Despite the tremendous advances made in
the care of children with cancer over the past
50 years, at the present time one in ﬁve
children diagnosed with cancer will ulti-
mately die of their disease. The death of a
child affects the physical and psychological
well-being of family members for the rest of
their lives. Events occurring around the time
of death, both positive and negative, play a
critical role in deﬁning how family members
grieve and ultimately come to terms with
the event. Families who have lost a child
have identiﬁed several needs regarding end-
of-life care. These include the need to have
complete information honestly communi-
cated, to have easy access to essential staff
members who will be supportive, to have
assistance in coordinating necessary ser-
vices, to have their relationship with their
child maintained as much as possible, and to
be allowed to feel that their child’s life and
death has meaning.
Research studies involving pediatric pal-
liative care are limited, but they have iden-
tiﬁed several important shortcomings in the
level of palliative care provided to children.
Several studies have demonstrated a lack of
successful management of pain and other
distressing symptoms. Other studies have
demonstrated that the majority of children
dying of life-threatening diseases die in the
hospital, often in the intensive care unit.
The impact of this outcome on the appro-
priateness of care provided and its effect on
the family’s bereavement process are not
totally clear. Studies have also demonstrated
that signiﬁcant levels of parental dissatisfac-
tion with hospital staff can arise from
confusing, inadequate, or uncaring commu-
nication regarding treatment and prognosis
as well as discrepancies between parents
and care providers in understanding the
terminal condition. When a language bar-
rier exists between family and staff, these
problems are often exacerbated.
Common symptoms at the end
of life
Pain
Parents and caregivers report that their
child’s pain is the symptom they fear most.
A large survey of parents whose children
died of cancer revealed that 75% of them felt
their child suffered pain at the end of life,
but only 37% felt the pain was successfully
managed.
The principles of pediatric pain manage-
ment are presented in Chapter 28 and pain
management at the end of life follows these
same principles. However, it becomes par-
ticularly important to clarify and under-
stand the goals of treatment as elucidated
by the patient and parents. The desire to
maintain alertness and interaction early in
treatment may give way to a desire to keep
the patient comfortable, even if it means the
patient will be more sedated and less aware.
Acceding to the family’s wishes that the
patient not be hooked up to monitors might
outweigh concern that the doses of pain
medications being used could result in
respiratory
depression.
These
decisions
often run counter to what physicians see
as their primary goal of care, to prolong life
as long as possible. Working through some
of these difﬁcult philosophical issues with
the help of a mentor can be essential to
working comfortably and effectively in this
type of setting.

Nausea and vomiting
Nausea and vomiting at the end of life can be
triggered by many different stimuli. A variety
of toxins such as medications and their
metabolites, urea resulting from renal failure,
or metabolic byproducts of hepatic failure
can all stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger
zoneand causenausea.Increasedintracranial
pressure and a variety of emotional and
sensory stimuli can mediate nausea and
vomiting through cortical pathways. The
gastrointestinal (GI) tract can stimulate the
vomiting center in response to local receptor
stimulation caused by obstruction, stasis,
toxins, or drugs. In addition, pharyngeal
stimulation by mucous or mucosal break-
down can also trigger the vomiting center.
A stepwise approach to the management
of nausea and vomiting in the palliative care
setting is outlined in Table 29.1. A key
feature of this approach is to ensure that
the interventions selected are in keeping
with the patient’s and family’s goals of care.
A number of medications can be tried to
control nausea and vomiting. The ideal
agent is one that targets the speciﬁc cause
of the patient’s distress if such an agent can
be identiﬁed. A list of useful medications is
outlined in Table 29.2.
Opioids frequently cause nausea and
vomiting due to a direct effect on the che-
motherapy trigger zone or secondarily to
their effect on GI motility leading to gastro-
paresis and constipation.

Constipation
Constipation often causes pain and distress
for children at the end of life, both physically
and psychologically. Prevention of consti-
pation should therefore be a primary goal of
end-of-life care.
One of the most common causes of
constipation are opioids, which decrease
GI motility and ﬂuid secretion, leading to
hard, dry stools. Unlike other narcotic side
effects, constipation does not seem to
decrease with ongoing use. Patients and
families should be informed ahead of time
about this side effect, as children in severe
pain may not consider regular bowel move-
ments a priority. Once well established,
constipation may require quite aggressive
and unpleasant therapies to correct it.
Other factors that contribute to consti-
pation in terminal patients include poor oral
intake of ﬂuids and food, decreased physical
activity, neurological dysfunction, and intes-
tinal obstruction due to presence of tumor.

atanypointintreatment;institutionalstudies
indicate that it affects as many as 40% of
children with cancer at diagnosis and the pre-
valenceincreasestoashighas70% in children
with advanced stage disease. Early in treat-
ment it is most often a side effect of chemo-
therapy or radiation, or a result of stomatitis,
dysphagia, constipation, pain, or depression.
As the child’s cancer becomes progressive,
it is often a component of the anorexia/
cachexia syndrome, a complex set of central
nervous system (CNS) and metabolic abnor-
malities caused by a combination of tumor
byproducts and host cytokine release.

Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is
rarely useful in the end-of-life setting except
for short-term use in the patient with GI
obstruction.
Fatigue
The National Comprehensive Cancer Net-
work deﬁnes cancer-related fatigue as “a dis-
tressing persistent, subjective sense of physi-
cal, emotional and/or cognitive tiredness or
exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treat-
ment that is not proportional to recent activ-
ity and interferes with usual functioning.”

incapacitating; as such it signiﬁcantly de-
creases health-related quality of life in chil-
dren. While it can exist throughout the entire
period of cancer treatment, fatigue is most
often seen as signiﬁcant as the child’s disease
progresses. In several studies, parents have
identiﬁed fatigue as the most signiﬁcant
symptom that moderately or severely im-
pacted their child’s well-being toward the end
of life. These same studies have also demon-
strated thatitisthesymptommost likelytobe
missed by care providers; fewer than 50% of
children whose parents described them as
suffering highly from fatigue had this docu-
mented in their medical record.
Cancer-related fatigue is more common
and more severe in children with brain
tumors than in those with other cancers.
Pediatric patients tend more often to
associate their feelings of fatigue to sleep
disturbance
or
side
effects
of
therapy
whereas parents are more likely to include
emotions and nutritional status as potential
causes. A recent study suggested that pain
and dyspnea were frequently associated with
fatigue; the authors postulated that opioids
and benzodiazepines, common therapies for
pain and dyspnea, might have signiﬁcantly
contributed to their patients’ fatigue.
In a recent review on the assessment and
management of fatigue and dyspnea in pedi-
atric palliative care, Dr. Christina Ulrich
deﬁned a conceptual model for understand-
ing fatigue in this population. This frame-
work is outlined in Figure 29.2.

have been shown to be effective in adults.
These are outlined in Table 29.4.
Psychosocial and activity-based inter-
ventions have been shown to be quite effec-
tive in adults with cancer-related fatigue;
data in children are lacking. Exercise has the
strongest data regarding its value, but this is
largely in adult cancer survivors suffering
from fatigue after the completion of curative
therapy. Its utility in ameliorating fatigue in
patients near the end of life is less well
established.
Dyspnea
Dyspnea is the term used to describe the
feeling of breathlessness that occurs when
the respiratory system fails to meet the
body’s need for oxygen uptake or carbon
dioxide removal. It occurs under normal
circumstances such as after brisk exercise,
but in pathological conditions it can cause
severe distress. It occurs very frequently at
the end of life, as respiratory failure occurs
very commonly as a terminal event. There-
fore, recognition of dyspnea and its effective
treatment is a key component of end-of-
life care.
Dyspnea can result from either an
increased metabolic demand or an inability
to maintain a normal minute ventilation.
The former can be caused by complications
of the disease or its treatment, such as
infection, metabolic acidosis, or increased
metabolic demands caused by extensive
tumor burden. The latter can result from
conditions such as decreased lung compli-
ance due to tumor, infection, or ﬂuid, or by
other conditions such as interstitial lung
disease, anemia, or fatigue.
It follows that treatment of dyspnea
would involve steps to decrease metabolic
demand or improve the efﬁciency of respi-
ration. However, this can prove to be quite
challenging in practice. It is often difﬁcult to
determine whether the cause of dyspnea is
in fact respiratory or metabolic, and once
discovered, the unwillingness of the patient
or family to accept certain interventions can
create additional challenges for the treat-
ment team.

Appropriate therapies to decrease meta-
bolic demand depend on the cause of the
increased demand. For the patient who
becomes dyspneic with activity, it may be
as simple as recommending that the patient
use a wheelchair instead of walking or
decrease physical activity in other ways.
Increased metabolic demand caused by
infection or inﬂammation can be treated
with aggressive use of antibiotics or anti-
inﬂammatory agents, as long as such ther-
apies are in keeping with the patient’s and
family’s wishes.
Respiratory failure can result from two
general causes: lung parenchymal dysfunc-
tion and respiratory muscle fatigue or fail-
ure. It is important to distinguish between
these, as the treatments are different. An
algorithm for distinguishing between these
causes is presented in Table 29.5. It is
important to note that hypercarbia can be
a late ﬁnding in parenchymal dysfunction
as well.
Treatment
Treatment for dyspnea can be divided into
three general categories: mechanical sup-
port of respiration, support of gas exchange,
and therapies to decrease the sensation of
dyspnea.
Support of respiration
When intubation and mechanical ventilation
are not appropriate or acceptable to the
patient and family, noninvasive positive pres-
sure ventilation (NIPPV) can be useful in
supporting respiration. However, the use of
NIPPV in adult patients who have elected to
forgo intubation or other aggressive respira-
tory support is controversial. Its use in chil-
drenwithcancerisunstudied;therehavebeen
ahandfulofpaperspublishedregardingitsuse
in children with neuromuscular disorders.
From the adult literature, it appears clear
that the most important issue when deciding
on the use of NIPPV to support respiration is
a clear understanding of the goals of therapy
among all involved. In 2007, the Society of
Critical Care Medicine Palliative Noninva-
sive Positive Pressure Ventilation Task Force
published its recommendations on the use
of NIPPV in the palliative care setting.
While intended for adults, the concepts can
be applied to the pediatric care setting as well.
The Task Force proposed a three-category
approach to assist in decision making regard-
ing this technology. An overview of this
approach is presented in Table 29.6.
The key areas of distinction in this model
are goals of care, determination of success,
appropriate endpoints, and response to

failure. It is imperative that each member of
the care team agrees on each of these com-
ponents to avoid confusion and conﬂict
later in the course.
Support of gas exchange
NIPPV can also be used to augment gas
exchange in patients with low lung volumes
in whom the surface area for gas exchange is
reduced and the caliber of the airways is
decreased,
increasing
the
likelihood
of
obstruction. Continuous positive airway
pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure
are useful in situations in which the pressure
necessary to maintain airway patency is too
high to allow for efﬁcient exhalation.
In the setting of respiratory failure with-
out hypercapnia, supplemental oxygen is
the most appropriate intervention to facil-
itate gas exchange. It is often better tolerated
than NIPPV devices, especially by young
children, facilitating pulmonary vasculature
dilatation and inhibiting cerebral artery
dilatation, a frequent cause of headaches.
It is important to remember, however, that
patients with hypercapnic respiratory fail-
ure frequently rely on a “hypoxic drive” to
maintain respiration. Provision of supple-
mental oxygen to these patients can lead to
hypopnea or apnea.
Therapies to decrease the sensation of
dyspnea
In end-of-life settings respiratory failure is
often the ultimate cause of death and the
main goal of therapy is minimizing the
distress resulting from the sensation of dys-
pnea as this occurs. This goal can be
achieved with a combination of pharmaco-
logic and nonpharmacologic therapies.
The two most effective classes of drugs
for minimizing the perception of dyspnea
are opioids and benzodiazepines. Morphine
is the opioid used most often for this pur-
pose, but fentanyl and hydromorphone
(Dilaudid) have been shown to be effective
as well. The dose that is required is lower
than what is commonly used for pain; a
morphine dose of 0.025 mg/kg, or an equiv-
alent dose of fentanyl or Dilaudid, is often
effective in the narcotic-na€ıve child, and an
increase in the dose by 25% will often be
effective in the child already receiving mor-
phine. The dose should then be titrated to
achieve symptom relief, with no set upper
limit. Benzodiazepines can help with the
anxiety associated with dyspnea; lorazepam
0.05 mg/kg (maximum 2 mg) can be given
every 4 to 8 hours for this purpose.
A variety of nonpharmacologic interven-
tions have been shown to decrease the dis-
tress
associated
with
dyspnea.
These
include:
1. Cool air blown on the face
2. Chest wall percussion
3. Relaxation therapy and counseling
4. Proper positioning
5. Limitation of activities
6. Cooler room temperature
7. Avoidance
of
respiratory
irritants
(tobacco smoke and cleaning ﬂuids)
Most experts agree that these work best as an
adjunct to pharmacologic therapy; they are
rarely effective alone.
Conclusion
Unfortunately,
many
questions
remain
about how to best care for children who are
destined to die before they reach adulthood.
These include practical issues such as how to
best manage distressing symptoms such as
those listed above, how to best communicate
with children about the dying process and
involve them in decisions regarding their
care, and how to avoid aggressive end-of-life
therapies that only delay death and prolong
suffering instead of extending life. After the
child’s death,familiesmustcontinue tomove
forward, raising questions about how best to

help them deal with the bereavement that
inevitably accompanies such an event. It is
fortunate that research into these questions
has expanded greatly over the past few years,
and it is likely that answers to these questions
will soon be available in the medical litera-
ture. The children we care for, but cannot
save, deserve no less.
Case study for review
Julie, a 13-year-old girl with widely meta-
static alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma diag-
nosed 6 months earlier continues to have
extensive bony disease, including possible
new metastatic lung lesions. Julie’s treat-
ment has been complicated by chronic
pain and a challenging family situation.
Although Julie lives with her mother, her
father oversees her care. Her parents do not
get along with one another. They frequently
argue and scream in her presence, which
clearly upsets her.
Since diagnosis, her father has adamantly
refused to let caregivers have one-on-one
conversations with Julie. He insists on
remaining the only one to relate to Julie
any
disease-related
information,
as
he
knows her best and can gauge how she will
react. He has stated that Julie need not know
that she will likely die of her disease and he
has forbidden the medical team from dis-
cussing issues related to prognosis.
Julie is to undergo a CT-guided lung
biopsy to determine the nature of the lung
lesions. Her parents state that she is already
anxious enough and do not want the med-
ical team to tell her about the biopsy or the
possibility that her disease has progressed.
Instead, they ask that Julie be told that she is
to be sedated only for a “scan.” Moreover,
should she prove to have new disease, they
do not want Julie to be informed and ask
that her caregivers not discuss end-of-life
matters with her.
Questions
* As Julie’s physician, are you comfortable
with her parents’ approach?
* Should Julie’s parents prevent her from
knowing
information
relevant
to
her
disease?
* How do you reconcile your responsibility
to be forthright with Julie while simulta-
neously being respectful of her parents’
request?
* If you believe that her parents’ approach
is not in Julie’s best interest, how might you
proceed?
* Should children with life-limiting ill-
nesses be involved in end-of-life decisions?
Understanding familial adaptation toward
the dying process is imperative. As health-
care providers, our goal is to anticipate and
identify problems and to assist dying chil-
dren and their families as they adjust to and
cope with the emotional responses, which
are part of the dying process.
Many children, parents, and physicians
are hesitant to discuss death and dying so
that opportunities for planning how to cope
are often missed. Failure to prepare ade-
quately for death can deprive families of the
chance to enjoy what time they have left
with one another.
Each child and family grieve in their own
unique way, determined by personal experi-
ences with death, religious and cultural
backgrounds, and individual makeup.
Dying is a process and all parties need to
learn to live with dying or, as stated by the
American Academy of Pediatrics, “the goal
[of palliative care] is to add life to the
child’s years, not simply years to the child’s
life” [1].
Parents’ natural tendency to protect
their children inﬂuences the amount of
information children receive and the degree
to which they are involved in decision
making about their care [2]. Some parents
feel that by giving their child a choice their
276
Chapter 29

responsibilities are being usurped, while
others perceive including their sick child
in decisions as overly burdensome. For
many parents, the sicker their child, the
more they assume decisional priority and
attempt to minimize, veto, or even preclude
their child from having a role in decisions at
all. Seemingly, such an approach is under-
standable; however, parents need to be
aware of the consequences of not preparing
their children for medical outcomes that are
inevitable, such as anxiety, stress, and
confusion.
Children frequently know more about
their disease than for which they are credited.
Even when kept in the dark by parents
and providers, children often know that
the endpoint of a life-threatening illness is
death [3–5]. As children appreciate certain
facts about their diseases and know that they
are dying, it stands to reason that they should
be involved in decisions about their care so
that they can voice their preferences [6,7].
Therefore, the question we ask ourselves
should not be “should I tell,” rather it should
be “how do I tell?” Increasingly, research
supports the need for direct communication
between parents, physicians, and children
with life-limiting illnesses. This includes dis-
cussions relating to prognosis and even
death [1,2,8,9]. Hinds et al. [10] found that
children with life-limiting cancer between
ages 10 to 20 years were capable of partici-
pating in end-of-life decision making.
Physicians must be aware of the unique
barriers to a child’s ability to participate in
decision making as it relates to the dying
process. The ﬁrst question we must ask is,
“does this child have the ability to understand
that he/she is dying and what dying entails.”
As children mature, their intellectual and
emotional understanding of serious illness
and the prospect of death matures too.
Discussions about death should be honest
and take into consideration the child’s
emotional and developmental level. It is
important to follow the child’s lead [11].
In other words, answer what children ask
and on their terms. Often, rather than being
direct, a child’s question or statement may
be suggestive of something they are uncom-
fortable asking and therefore it is vital to
determine what their underlying intention
is and not to give too much or too little
information or answer the wrong question.
Finally, failure to inform and involve chil-
dren can lead to feelings of isolation and
distress [12].
Ideally, discussions should occur early
and routinely and physicians should reassess
how the child and parents understand the
plan and goals of care. This helps the dying
child and parents make appropriate deci-
sions. Discussions should be in language
that parents and children can understand
and be presented gently, accurately, and
repeatedly. Doing so will help minimize
misunderstandings and defuse conﬂicts.
The challenge is to do so in a way that is
both sensitive and respectful of the child’s,
parents’, and providers’ needs, needs that
are often in conﬂict with one another.
According to the Institute of Medicine
(IOM), “conﬂicts may . . . be productive or
beneﬁcial” [11]. Confronted with a dis-
agreement, parties tend to engage in a more
in-depth discussion allowing for a greater
appreciation of each other’s position, and,
in the process, each side may become more
sensitive to the other’s values and concerns.
Mack et al. [13] surveyed parents of
children with cancer and found that par-
ents rated the quality of care provided by
physicians more favorably when physicians
communicated
directly
with
children
(when appropriate). Similarly, in a survey
of more than 400 Swedish parents of chil-
dren
who
died
of
cancer,
Kreicbergs
et al. [14] found that none of the parents
who spoke with their child about death
regretted doing so, whereas more than
one-quarter of parents who did not speak
Palliative Care
277

with their child regretted not doing so. The
latter parent group had higher levels of
anxiety and depression than parents who
did speak to their children.
Parents are not alone in valuing the
importance
of
direct
communication
between children and physicians. Recent
research has shown that children with can-
cer
consider
direct
communication
between doctors and children more impor-
tant than any other aspect [15]. Nearly 40
years ago, following parental approval,
Nitschke et al. [4] began including children
aged 5 years and older who were near death
from cancer in end-of-life discussions.
They found that the majority of children
and parents found the child’s inclusion a
positive experience. They also reported that
some children from whom information
was withheld experienced fear and isolation
prior to dying.
Conclusions and practical
suggestions
Situations like Julie’s do not lend themselves
to easy solutions. Dishonesty, evading the
question at hand, inconsistencies, and white
lies are to be avoided at all costs. Deception
is difﬁcult to maintain. When the truth is
ultimately discovered, the patient–parent–
physician relationship is often irrevocably
damaged, an unfortunate circumstance in
any situation, but particularly for a child like
Julie who is nearing the end of life. Such
action may lead Julie to withdraw and even
to experience feelings of isolation and fear,
let alone profoundly disrespect her devel-
oping autonomy.
By helping to facilitate, clarify, and
resolve areas of contention, pediatricians
can be extremely helpful. As appreciated by
the IOM, the following steps may be useful:
(1) postpone decisions to allow for time to
think about concerns and to discuss goals,
(2) rather than making deﬁnitive decisions
that
offer
no
room
for
compromise,
consider temporary steps that accommo-
date each party’s goals, and (3) periodically
reevaluate each party’s views concerning
the goals of care and the options to achieve
those goals [11].
Case resolution
Since Julie’s diagnosis, her father has peri-
odically sought the guidance of the unit’s
social worker. Prior to the lung biopsy,
Julie’s father agreed to meet with her
oncologist and the social worker in the
latter’s ofﬁce, a place where he is comfort-
able speaking. Following a brief update by
the oncologist of Julie’s current medical
status, the social worker asked her father
to share his concerns about Julie not being
included in disease-related discussions. Her
father stated that Julie is “just a kid,” and
that it was “his job to protect, and to decide
what is best for her.” He recounted his
limited parental role in Julie’s life prior to
her cancer diagnosis and blamed himself for
not being more present in her life, admitting
that Julie’s illness and likely death “terrify”
him and that he is resolute not to abandon
her again.
The social worker asked Julie’s father
what he believes she knows of her disease
and its prognosis. He replied that Julie
knows she has cancer and that it is
“treatable,” and nothing more. She then
asked if he would allow Julie to join them,
which would permit the oncologist (in his
presence) to answer any questions she may
have about the “scan” and to clarify what
she indeed knows. Hesitant at ﬁrst, he
ultimately
agreed.
After
greeting
and
thanking her for joining them, the oncolo-
gist asked Julie if she has any questions
about the upcoming CT scan. Julie asked
why she has to have another CT when
reevaluation scans, including a chest CT,
were just completed 1 week ago. Directing
her words to the oncologist, Julie asked,
278
Chapter 29

“is something wrong?” Before the oncolo-
gist or her father could reply, Julie stated,
“I’ve been online talking to other kids with
cancer. A few of them said that the only
reason to repeat a scan so soon is to see
if the disease is back.” Without hesitation
and still speaking to her oncologist, Julie
said, “I know that most kids with my kind of
cancer die.”
The social worker encouraged Julie and
her father to speak openly and freely. Ten-
tatively, and with the support of the oncolo-
gist and social worker, they began to speak
to one another and share their respective
concerns and goals. Following their conver-
sation, Julie’s father cautiously agreed to
include Julie in future discussions. The
oncologist assured both Julie and her father
that although he remains hopeful, her dis-
ease is difﬁcult to cure and that she might
indeed die of her cancer. However, the
medical team would continue to treat both
her cancer and her pain, all along adhering
to her and her parents’ wishes.
Successful
care
of
the
dying
child
requires that healthcare providers acknowl-
edge families’ emotions, assure families that
their responses are normal, provide a bal-
anced and honest perspective, and commu-
nicate frequently and consistently.

Chemotherapy Basics
Chemotherapeutic
agents
have
multiple
mechanisms of action and many potential
side effects. In order to be prepared for the
potential complications, we discuss the most
common pediatric agents, their mechanisms
of action, the types of malignancies for which
they are utilized, and ﬁnally, the most likely
side effects. We discuss how best to monitor
for these adverse events, and how to manage
them should they occur. Note that side effects
from chemotherapy are numerous and we
detail some of the more common ones rather
than provide a comprehensive list; further
reading may be required in appropriately
diagnosing and managing a patient. Emeto-
genic potential of common pediatric agents is
included in Chapter 25. The majority of
agents are dosed depending on the patient’s
body surface area (BSA) rather than weight,
especially for patients older than 1 year of
age. Multiple formulas exist for the calcula-
tion of BSA; we prefer the Mosteller formula:

Asparaginase
Asparaginase comes in three forms: L-
asparaginase (Elspar), polyethylene glycol
(PEG)-asparaginase
(Oncaspar),
and
Erwinia (Erwinase). Asparaginase is a nat-
urally occurring enzyme produced by many
microorganisms. In the L- and PEG-aspar-
aginase forms, the enzyme is produced by
Escherichia coli, whereas the Erwinia form
is produced by Erwinia chrysanthemi. PEG-
asparaginase is a modiﬁed form of L-aspar-
aginase with a much longer half-life resulting
from its covalent binding to PEG, allowing
the same therapeutic effect from fewer doses.
Intramuscular asparaginase is the current
standard of care due to concerns about severe
anaphylaxis with intravenous (IV) use; how-
ever,
two
current
Children’s
Oncology
Group (COG) protocols are investigating the
safety and efﬁcacy of IV PEG-asparginase.
Less frequent dosing with PEG-asparaginase
is important for patient comfort and con-
venience
until
intravenous
asparaginase
becomes more widely accepted. Since Erwi-
nia is produced by a different microorgan-
ism, it is immunologically distinct and can be
utilized in patients that have had a hyper-
sensitivity reaction to the E. coli forms.
Mechanism of action
L-asparagine is a nonessential amino acid
that cannot be synthesized by malignant cells
of lymphoid and myeloid origin. Asparagi-
nase depletes L-asparagine from leukemic
cells
by
catalyzing
the
conversion
of
L-asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia.

Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute myelogenous leukemia
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
The most immediate side effect from aspar-
aginase compounds is an allergic reaction
that can range from local irritation to ana-
phylaxis. Patients should be monitored
closely for at least 1 hour after Elspar
injection, and 2 hours following Oncaspar
injection. Based on the level of allergic
symptoms, treatment can range from an
antihistamine such as diphenhydramine to
treatment of anaphylaxis with steroids, an
antihistamine, an H2 blocker (i.e., raniti-
dine), and epinephrine. A common later
side effect is coagulopathy secondary to
decreased synthesis of antithrombin III
(ATIII), ﬁbrinogen, and other clotting fac-
tors. Currently, routine monitoring of ATIII
and ﬁbrinogen and repletion of low levels
are not recommended without clinical
symptoms. Rare side effects that should
be considered include pancreatitis, throm-
bosis, and seizures.
Bleomycin
Bleomycin is obtained as a mixture of
antibiotics
isolated
from
Streptomyces
verticillus.
Mechanism of action
Bleomycin leads to the formation of oxy-
gen-free radicals that cause single-strand
and double-strand DNA breaks. In addi-
tion, bleomycin leads to cellular degrada-
tion of cellular RNA. Bleomycin is cell cycle
speciﬁc, targeting the G2 and M phases, thus
inhibiting cell growth and division, espe-
cially in rapidly dividing cells.
Utilized in
Germ cell tumors
Hodgkin lymphoma
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Bleomycin can cause infusional fever and
chills followed later by mucositis, as well as
pruritus and excoriation leading to hyper-
pigmentation. Raynaud’s phenomenon can
also commonly occur later, especially with
combination chemotherapy. Patients may
occasionally complain of rash, dysgeusia,
and anorexia. Due to the formation of
oxygen-free radicals, patients are at risk for
dose-dependent pneumonitis and rarely
pulmonary ﬁbrosis and therefore should
be monitored with pulmonary function
testing, especially carbon monoxide-diffus-
ing capacity (PFT/DLCO). An anaphylac-
toid-type reaction may also rarely occur.
Cisplatin/Carboplatin
Cisplatin was the ﬁrst of the platinum-based
chemotherapeutic agents. Carboplatin has
less severe side effects, in particular decreased
nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. It is more
myelosuppressive, however.
Mechanism of action
The platinum agents, like the alkylators,
cause interstrand DNA cross-linking. In
addition, they bind to replicating DNA
causing single-strand breaks.

Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Infusional nausea and vomiting are common
as platinum agents have an extremely high
emetogenic potential. This is followed later
by myelosuppression. Electrolyte abnormal-
ities including hypokalemia, hypomagnese-
mia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia are
common and the patient may develop Fan-
coni syndrome (diminished reabsorption of
solutes by the proximal tubule resulting in
hypophosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, and
secondary
hypokalemia).
Nephrotoxicity
and ototoxicity (high-frequency sensori-
neural hearing loss) occur occasionally with
carboplatin but are more common and
severe with cisplatin.
Ototoxicity must be monitored with
serial audiograms during therapy. Due to
the risk of electrolyte abnormalities, chem-
istry panels including magnesium should be
followed daily while receiving platinum-
based therapy. In addition, due to the risk
of nephrotoxicity, the patient’s intake and
output should be followed closely and be
well-matched. If it appears the patient is
developing a negative ﬂuid balance, addi-
tional ﬂuids should be provided. If the
patient develops a positive ﬂuid balance,
mannitol should be used to increase urine
output. Renal function should be moni-
tored closely, as a reduction in the glomer-
ular ﬁltration rate will necessitate a dose
reduction. In general, for pediatric patients
with no previous history of nephrotoxicity,
serum creatinine can serve as a measure of
renal function utilizing the Cockcroft-Gault
equation:

Decrease in the estimated creatinine
clearance should lead to more formal
measurements of the glomerular ﬁltration
rate and likely platinum dose reduction.
Cyclophosphamide/Ifosfamide
Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and ifosfamide
are alkylating agents and structural analogues.
They are related to nitrogen mustard.
Mechanism of action
Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide require
conversion by the hepatic P450 system to
their active form that ultimately leads to
the intracellular release of two compounds,
acrolein
and
phosphoramide
mustard.
Phosphoramide mustard causes interstrand
DNA cross-linking.

Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide com-
monly cause nausea, vomiting, and anorexia
with drug infusion. Myelosuppression, im-
munosuppression, and alopecia are common
later adverse effects. Sterility is dose depen-
dent (greatest with cumulative doses of
cyclophosphamide >7.5 g/m2) and occurs
more commonly in pubertal males (though
prepubertal males and females are also at
risk). Due to the risk of nephrotoxicity,
particularly with ifosfamide, patients should

be well-hydrated prior to and after infusion.
Though the syndrome of inappropriate
diuretic hormone (SIADH) is rare, patients
should be monitored for appropriate urine
output by following their intake and output
as well as urine speciﬁc gravity. Electrolytes
are also routinely followed for hyponatremia.
Iftherearesignsofﬂuidretention,thepatient
should initially be given increased hydration
followed by diuresis with furosemide or
mannitol if hydration is ineffective.
Excretion of acrolein into the urine can
cause hemorrhagic cystitis. The addition of
MESNAforbladderprotectionwhenthecyclo-
phosphamide dose exceeds 1.0g/m2/day has
signiﬁcantly decreased the frequency of this
adverse event. MESNA speciﬁcally binds to
acrolein and other toxic metabolites in the
urine to detoxify them and protect the bladder
wall. The urine should be monitored for the
presence of occult blood during and after in-
fusion and, if positive, should be examined
microscopically. If red blood cells are noted
onmicroscopy,hydrationshouldbeincreased.
Of note, MESNA can cause a false positive test
for ketones on urine dipstick. Finally, metab-
olismofifosfamideleadstoformationofchlor-
oacetaldehyde, a byproduct thought responsi-
ble for nephrotoxicity as well as the neurotox-
icity seen occasionally with ifosfamide (som-
nolence, depressive psychosis, and confusion).
Thiamine prophylaxis may have beneﬁt in a
patient with prior neurotoxicity.
Cytarabine (Ara-C)
Cytarabine,
also
known
as
cytosine
arabinoside or Ara-C (arabinofuranosyl
cytidine), is utilized in the treatment of
hematologic malignancies.
Mechanism of action
Cytarabine is an antimetabolite that inhibits
DNA polymerase. In addition, it is cell
cycle speciﬁc, killing cells during synthesis
(S phase); it therefore speciﬁcally targets
rapidly dividing cells.
Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute myelogenous leukemia
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Cytarabine
commonly
causes
nausea,
vomiting, and anorexia immediately after
infusion. Later, myelosuppression, stomati-
tis, and alopecia are common. Although not
common, the patient should be monitored
for Ara-C syndrome that includes fever,
myalgias, bone pain, malaise, conjunctivitis,
maculopapular rash, and occasionally chest
pain. High-dose IV cytarabine requires pro-
phylaxis with dexamethasone eye drops to
prevent conjunctivitis. A ﬂu-like syndrome
with fever, chills, and rash occurs occasion-
ally with cytarabine; infection must still be
ruled out with bacterial cultures. Streptococ-
cus viridans sepsis and acute respiratory
distress syndrome are possible after high-
dose cytarabine, therefore the addition of
vancomycin with fever or clinical deterio-
ration should be strongly considered. Intra-
thecal (IT) cytarabine similarly can cause
fever, nausea, and vomiting in addition to
headache. More serious and immediate side
effects including arachnoiditis, somnolence,
meningismus, convulsions, and paresis are
rare but should be considered as clinically
indicated.
Dactinomycin (Actinomycin-D)
Dactinomycin is an antibiotic compound
isolated from Streptomyces parvullus, similar
to the anthracycline class.
284
Chapter 30

Mechanism of action
Dactinomycin intercalates with DNA, inhi-
biting RNA and DNA synthesis. In addition,
dactinomycin interacts with topoisomerase,
which is required for DNA replication, and
leads to single-strand DNA breaks.
Utilized in
Soft tissue sarcomas
Wilms tumor
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Infusional nausea and vomiting are com-
mon, followed later by alopecia and mye-
losuppression. Anorexia, fatigue, diarrhea,
and
mucositis
also
occur
occasionally.
Radiation recall can occur in patients who
previously received radiation therapy.
Daunorubicin/Doxorubicin/
Idarubicin
Daunorubicin and doxorubicin are both
anthracycline
antibiotics
isolated
from
Streptomyces species (S. coeruleorubidus and
S. peucetius, respectively). Idarubicin is an
analogue of daunorubicin used less com-
monly in pediatric oncology.
Mechanism of action
Anthracyclines as a group are cytotoxic to
malignant cells due to nucleotide base inter-
calation and cell membrane lipid-binding
activity. Nucleotide intercalation inhibits
replication as well as DNA and RNA poly-
merases. The anthracyclines also interact
with topoisomerase II, which is vital for
DNA replication. Cell membrane binding
affects a variety of cellular functions. In addi-
tion, electron reduction of the anthracyclines
produces free radicals leading to DNA dam-
age and lipid peroxidation. Daunorubicin
differs from doxorubicin structurally as the
side chain terminates in a methyl group
rather than an alcohol. Idarubicin lacks a
methoxy group which increases its lipophi-
licity as compared with other anthracyclines.
Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute myelogenous leukemia
Hepatoblastoma
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Neuroblastoma
Osteogenic sarcoma
Soft tissue sarcomas
Wilms tumor
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Anthracyclines commonly cause nausea and
vomiting with treatment. Due to the color of
the infusion, the patient should be warned
that urine, saliva, tears, and sweat may all
have a pink or red coloring. After treatment,
myelosuppression, alopecia, and mucositis
commonly occur. Due to the production
of free radicals during electron reduction
of anthracyclines, patients are at risk for
dose-dependent cardiotoxicity occurring as
a late ﬁnding. Echocardiographic monitor-
ing is required during and after treatment at
regular intervals based on the total anthra-
cycline dose received as well as concomitant
radiation therapy to the chest. Cardioprotec-
tion with continuous versus rapid infusion as
well as agents such as dexrazoxane remains
controversial and is not yet routinely recom-
mended. Dexrazoxane may have beneﬁt
when patients receive high cumulative doses
of anthracyclines (i.e., 300 mg/m2). Addi-
tionally, anthracyclines provide different
cumulative toxicity, and dose conversion
based on doxorubicin isotoxic dose equiva-
lents must be performed as below:
Doxorubicin: multiply total dose  1
Daunorubicin: multiply total dose  0.833
Epirubicin: multiply total dose  0.67
Idarubicin: multiply total dose  5
Mitoxantrone: multiply total dose  4
Chemotherapy Basics
285

Radiation recall is also a potential rare
complication of anthracyclines when given
after radiation therapy.
Etoposide
Etoposide is derived from podophyllotoxin,
a toxin found in the American mayapple.
Mechanism of action
Etoposide binds to topoisomerase II, which
is vital for DNA replication, leading to DNA
strand breakage. Etoposide is cell cycle spe-
ciﬁc and appears to act mainly on the G2
and S (synthesis) phases, thus targeting
rapidly dividing cells.
Utilized in
Acute myelogenous leukemia
Brain tumors
Ewing sarcoma
Germ cell tumors
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
Neuroblastoma
Osteogenic sarcoma
Soft tissue sarcomas
Wilms tumor
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Infusional nausea and vomiting is common
followed by myelosuppression and alopecia.
Although rare, the patient should be mon-
itored closely for hypotension and anaphy-
laxis during the infusion. In addition to
ﬂuid support, the infusional rate can be
slowed if the patient develops hypotension.
Imatinib (Gleevec)
Imatinib was the ﬁrst successful targeted
drug therapy for oncology patients.
Mechanism of action
Imatinib is a selective inhibitor of the tyro-
sine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL fusion
protein, a product of the Philadelphia chro-
mosome (reciprocal translocation of chro-
mosome 9 and 22) seen mainly in chronic
myeloid leukemia and rarely with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.
Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Philadelphia
chromosome-positive)
Chronic myelogenous leukemia
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Imatinib has multiple potential side effects.
Common immediate effects include ﬂuid
retention, nausea, and diarrhea. Later com-
mon effects include fatigue, muscle cramps,
rash, arthralgias, and myelosuppression.
Irinotecan
Irinotecan is a semisynthetic analog isolated
from
the
plant
alkaloid
Camptotheca
acuminata.
Mechanism of action
Irinotecan in its active form is a potent
inhibitor of topoisomerase I which is vital
for DNA replication. Inhibition of topo-
isomerase inhibits replication and also leads
to DNA damage.
Utilized in
Brain tumors
Hepatoblastoma
Soft tissue sarcomas
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Patients receiving irinotecan can suffer from
cholinergic symptoms including intestinal
hyperperistalsis that can lead to abdominal
286
Chapter 30

cramping and early diarrhea. Patients should
be monitored closely for early diarrhea; if
it occurs loperamide should be given prior
to an anticholinergic (e.g., atropine). Other
cholinergic symptoms that may occur with
drug administration include rhinitis, in-
creased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, dia-
phoresis, and ﬂushing. Common later side
effects include diarrhea, alopecia, transami-
nitis,
neutropenia,
mucositis,
and
hyperbilirubinemia.
Mercaptopurine (6-MP)
Mercaptopurine is a purine analog.
Mechanism of action
Mercaptopurine is converted into several
active metabolites that inhibit RNA and DNA
synthesis. As a purine analog it can also
interfere with purine biosynthesis. Mercap-
topurine is converted to nucleotide metabo-
lites, some of which can lead to DNA toxicity.
Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Mercaptopurine is generally well tolerated,
although myelosuppression occurs com-
monly. Mercaptopurine is usually adminis-
tered at night as patients may occasionally
complain of anorexia, nausea, and vomit-
ing. Many foods can decrease absorption
and therefore administration should be
separated from meals. Diarrhea and an ery-
thematous rash may also occasionally occur.
Methotrexate
Methotrexate was the ﬁrst successful chemo-
therapeutic agent utilized in children after
the observation that folic acid worsened
leukemia and dietary deﬁciency of folic acid
could improve leukemia symptoms.
Mechanism of action
Methotrexate inhibits folic acid by prevent-
ing the reduction of folic acid by the enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase. This inhibition
subsequently limits the synthesis of purines
and DNA. Some of the methotrexate meta-
bolites also lead to DNA damage.
Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute myelogenous leukemia
Brain tumors
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Osteogenic sarcoma
Side effects, monitoring,
and treatment
Because of signiﬁcant enterohepatic circula-
tion of methotrexate, transaminitis is com-
mon. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia may
also occur; therefore, oral doses are generally
given at bedtime. Many side effects of meth-
otrexate are due to delayed clearance after
high-dose IV treatment.Aggressivehydration
and alkalinization of ﬂuids can improve renal
clearance. Drugs including trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole,
penicillin,
nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatories (NSAIDs), and proton
pump inhibitors (PPIs) can competitively
inhibit renal clearance and must be held
during
high-dose
therapy.
Leucovorin
(folinic acid) is used to decrease many of the
toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as
methotrexate. Leucovorin can participate in
metabolic reactions requiring folic acid with-
out the necessity of reduction by dihydrofo-
late reductase which is inhibited by metho-
trexate. This mechanism of action can also
counteract the therapeutic effect of metho-
trexate; therefore, leucovorin should not be
started until 18 to 24 hours after the meth-
otrexate infusion has been completed. For
this reason, patients should be advised to not
Chemotherapy Basics
287

take folic acid supplements during metho-
trexate therapy as this may similarly reduce
efﬁcacy.
Urine pH should be monitored closely
and kept above 7.5 during high-dose ther-
apy to facilitate renal excretion of metho-
trexate. The patient’s intake and output
should also be followed. Methotrexate levels
are usually drawn starting 24 hours after the
infusion is started. Leukemia protocols pro-
vide a methotrexate nomogram that allows
the practitioner to determine if methotrex-
ate levels are declining appropriately or
are in a toxic range requiring an increase
in hydration and leucovorin frequency or
dose. Rarely, renal failure occurs and can
be managed with carboxypeptidase G2.
Toxicity is typically worse after delayed
clearance and includes severe mucositis and
myelosuppression. IT methotrexate often
causes nausea and headache. Arachnoiditis
occasionally occurs and the patient should
be monitored for symptoms including
fever, vomiting, and meningismus. Long-
term cognitive dysfunction and learning
disabilities occasionally occur. Leukoence-
phalopathy and progressive cognitive dete-
rioration rarely occur, especially in adoles-
cents and adults, with high-dose IV meth-
otrexate and accentuated by cranial radia-
tion therapy. Management of patients with
neurotoxicity including seizures, confusion,
ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, speech disor-
ders, and paraparesis is controversial. Prac-
titioners may recommend leucovorin rescue
after future IT doses or replacement with IT
cytarabine, with or without hydrocortisone.
Conclusive evidence is lacking on the use of
dextromethorphan as a neuroprotectant.
Steroids
Dexamethasone and prednisone are the
steroids used most commonly as chemo-
therapeutic agents.
Mechanism of action
Steroids have a variety of actions on the
body. Although not completely understood,
steroids are thought to destroy lympho-
blasts by binding to the cortisol receptor
found on lymphoid cells and speciﬁcally in
large number on lymphoblasts. Steroids are
immunosuppressive and target T-lympho-
cytes, monocytes, and eosinophils. Steroids
may also function by halting DNA synthesis.
Dexamethasone has better central nervous
system (CNS) penetration than prednisone
and has beneﬁt in preventing CNS relapse
in ALL.
Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
Side effects, monitoring, and
treatment
Steroid treatment results in a multitude of
side effects. Common ones include hyper-
phagia,
insomnia,
personality
changes,
adrenal
suppression,
acne,
immuno-
suppression,
and
Cushing’s
syndrome.
Occasional side effects include gastritis,
hyperglycemia, poor wound healing, facial
erythema, striae, thinning of the skin, mus-
cle weakness, osteopenia, and cataracts.
Avascular necrosis of various joints, most
commonly hips, knees, and ankles, occurs
rarely. It is more common in adolescents,
and females are at higher risk. It appears to
occur more commonly with dexametha-
sone than with prednisone. Hypertension
occurs rarely; blood pressure should be
monitored closely in addition to blood
glucose. Patients should be on an H2
blocker (i.e., ranitidine) while receiving
daily steroids to prevent gastritis and peptic
ulcer disease.
288
Chapter 30

Temozolomide
Temozolomide (Temodar) is an oral alky-
lating agent.
Mechanism of action
As with other alkylators, temozolomide
leads to DNA interstrand cross-linking.
Utilized in
Brain tumors
Side effects, monitoring,
and treatment
Temozolomide commonly causes anorexia,
nausea, vomiting, and constipation fol-
lowed by myelosuppression. Occasionally,
temozolomide may cause abdominal pain,
diarrhea, headache, and mucositis. Contin-
uous low-dose (metronomic) therapy may
be
effective
in
some
patients
with
a
decreased side effect proﬁle.
Thioguanine (6-TG)
Like mercaptopurine, thioguanine is an oral
antimetabolite and purine analog.
Mechanism of action
Metabolites of thioguanine interfere with
purine synthesis and DNA replication. The
intercalation of nucleotide metabolites into
DNA also leads to DNA strand breaks.
Utilized in
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute myelogenous leukemia
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Side effects, monitoring,
and treatment
Thioguanine commonly leads to myelosup-
pression and occasionally causes fatigue,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia.
Although rare, the patient should be moni-
toredfortransaminitisaswellassignsofveno-
occlusive disease (now termed sinusoidal
obstructive syndrome) and hepatic ﬁbrosis.
Topotecan
Like irinotecan, topotecan is a semisynthetic
analog isolated from the plant alkaloid
C. acuminata.
Mechanism of action
Topotecan is a potent inhibitor of topo-
isomerase I that is vital for DNA replication.
Inhibition of topoisomerase inhibits repli-
cation and also leads to DNA damage.
Utilized in
Brain tumors
Neuroblastoma
Side effects, monitoring,
and treatment
Topotecan can commonly cause nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, fever, pain
and later myelosuppression, fatigue, and alo-
pecia. The patient should also be monitored
for the occasional ﬁndings of headache, rash,
hypotension, transaminitis, and mucositis.
Vincristine/Vinblastine
Vincristine and vinblastine are alkaloids
isolated from the Madagascar periwinkle
plant
(Vinca
rosea,
now
Catharanthus
roseus) and therefore often referred to as
vinca alkaloids. Vincristine and vinblastine
are structurally identical except for a single
substitution (a formyl group in vincristine is
replaced by a methyl group in vinblastine),
which leads to signiﬁcant differences in their
cytotoxic effects.
Chemotherapy Basics
289

Mechanism of action
The vinca alkaloids bind to microtubules
especially in the mitotic spindle leading to
metaphasearrest,thustargetingrapidlydivid-
ing cells. They have other disruptive cellular
functions that may or may not be related to
their effects on tubulin and microtubules.
Utilized in

Brain tumors
Ewing sarcoma
Hepatoblastoma
Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Langerhans cell histiocytosis
Neuroblastoma
Soft tissue sarcomas
Wilms tumor
Side effects, monitoring,
and treatment
Vinblastine more commonly causes mye-
losuppression, whereas vincristine more
commonly causes neurotoxicity including
constipation and loss of deep tendon
reﬂexes. Both can lead to alopecia. Jaw
pain, peripheral paresthesias, wrist and
foot drop, and abnormal gait occasionally
occur, especially with vincristine. Ptosis,
vocal cord dysfunction, and damage to the
eighth cranial nerve (clinically with dizzi-
ness, nystagmus, vertigo, and hearing loss)
are rare ﬁndings. Vinca alkaloids are vesi-
cants; therefore, extravasation, if it occurs,
can lead to local ulceration (see Chapter 32
for management of extravasation).

Guide to Procedures
Patients with suspected or known oncologic
or hematologic disease undergo procedures
to obtain valuable diagnostic information
and receive certain therapies. Traditionally,
tumor biopsies are performed under general
anesthesia by pediatric surgeons, pediatric
orthopedic oncologists, and pediatric inter-
ventional radiologists. Pediatric hematol-
ogy/oncology physicians and their trained
staff perform lumbar punctures (LPs) to
look for involvement of the cerebral spinal
ﬂuid (CSF) by malignancy and to adminis-
ter intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy. Intrathe-
cal refers to the administration of a drug
directly into the subarachnoid space of the
spinal column. Drugs are administered in
this manner to bypass the blood–brain bar-
rier and therefore be more available for
central nervous system (CNS) directed
therapy. Currently, there are only three
agents licensed for intrathecal chemother-
apy: methotrexate, cytarabine (Ara-C), and
hydrocortisone. Other common procedures
include bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and
biopsy and administration of chemotherapy
via a peripheral vein or Ommaya reservoir.
Bone marrow examination is required for
the diagnosis of leukemia, lymphoma, bone
marrow failure states, evaluation of pancyto-
penia of unknown etiology, suspected storage
diseases, and certain cases of anemia. The
bone marrow produces the cellular elements
of the blood including platelets, red blood
cells, and white blood cells in addition to
the supporting matrix to allow for cell growth
and maturation. Aspirates are routinely
obtained for morphologic as well as immu-
nohistochemical and ﬂow cytometric evalu-
ation in patients with suspected leukemia.
Those with suspected or known solid tumors,
storage diseases, aplastic anemia, or other
marrow failure states require evaluation by
bone marrow biopsy as well. A core section of
the marrow matrix is obtained in order to
assess the suitability of the marrow environ-
ment for growth of normal cellular elements,
the cellularity of the marrow, and the presence
of abnormal cells that may be adherent to the
trabeculae. Samples are typically taken from
more than one site when looking for evidence
of marrow involvement by solid tumors in
order to increase the sensitivity of the test.
Basic principles for performing such
procedures include: (1) ensuring the proce-
dure is indicated for diagnosis, assessment
of response to therapy, or for possible
relapse; (2) ensuring the proper medication
is being administered at the proper time;
(3) providing a safe and sterile environment;
and, (4) obtaining informed consent with
proper documentation. The patient’s med-
ical record should be carefully reviewed
prior to the procedure and the purpose and
nature of the procedure be reviewed with
the patient and family. A discussion should
be held to review anticipated risks and

beneﬁts and documented in the medical
record with the signed informed consent.
All procedures should be performed or
supervised by practitioners with technical
expertise. For patients undergoing anesthe-
sia, a skilled caregiver (i.e., anesthesiologist,
nurse anesthetist, or critical care physician)
should administer the sedation and monitor
the patient. In addition to the practitioners
performing the procedure and sedation,
another skilled caregiver (i.e., nurse or phy-
sician) should be present to assist with
positioning, sterile transfer of chemother-
apy, and general patient care and monitor-
ing. Many centers perform all LPs and
BMAs under deep sedation or anesthesia;
however, some patients prefer to have these
procedures performed awake, or possibly
with mild sedation.
Prior to initiation of the procedure, a
time out should be done to properly identify
the patient (hospital wrist band, medical
record, and labels on medications) and
acknowledge the procedure and informed
consent.
All
materials
and
medications
should be brought into the room and
checked by at least two practitioners. If mul-
tiple medications are to be administered, care
should be taken to avoid an error in admin-
istration by bringing in one drug at a time.
Standardized procedures should be followed
to minimize error. Procedures may be per-
formed in an outpatient or inpatient setting
by individuals who have been properly
trained and supervised. Many teaching hos-
pitals will also provide a training opportunity
for procedures and close supervision by an
experienced practitioner is mandatory.
Lumbar puncture/intrathecal
chemotherapy
Indications
Patients with suspected leukemia or lym-
phoma (staging), history of leukemia or
CNS lymphoma (treatment or assessment
of relapse), CNS malignancy, and therapy
complications related to the CNS, speciﬁ-
cally infection or neurotoxicity (patients
with suspected meningitis, encephalitis, or
change in mental status without evidence of
increased intracranial pressure).
Pretreatment evaluation
1. Review
patient
history
for
use
of
anticoagulants
(should
be
discontinued
with appropriate time interval prior to pro-
cedure), seizures, or other CNS concerns
including prior complications with LPs or
intrathecal chemotherapy. Review of sys-
tems to include history of headaches, altered
mental status, fevers, bleeding, back pain, or
lower extremity weakness.
2. Physical examination should be per-
formed prior to the procedure with special
attention to a focused neurologic evaluation
with assessment for papilledema or other
evidence of increased intracranial pressure
such as high blood pressure, widened pulse
pressure, or altered level of consciousness.
Evaluate vitals and assess for any evidence of
infection or metabolic abnormalities to
ensure safety for anesthesia. Evaluate site
of procedure to assure no localized infection
or skin breakdown.
3. Laboratory parameters must be checked
to conﬁrm that the chemotherapy should be
given (platelet count, absolute neutrophil
count, and hemoglobin). A current meta-
bolic panel and coagulation tests should be
checked as indicated. Patients with moderate
thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 
109/L) may need a platelet transfusion,
although this varies with the skill of the
practitioner and the purpose of the proce-
dure (many practitioners prefer a platelet
count 100  109/L for a diagnostic LP
in suspected or newly diagnosed leukemia).
4. The chemotherapy to be administered
should be checked on the label to ensure
the correct drug, dose, mode of infusion,
292
Chapter 31

and patient identiﬁcation. This should be
compared to the patient’s medical record
and schema sheet to ensure appropriate
timing as well.
Materials
1. Standard LP tray, 10mL sterile syringe for
chemotherapy transfer, 22g spinal needle
(1.5in. for infants, 2.5 in. for older children,
longer needles available as needed for larger
patients), 25 gauge needle for lidocaine injec-
tion if needed, providone iodine and alcohol,
mask, and sterile gloves. A Quincke needle is
the standard needle used for an LP; however,
the pencil point Whitacre needle may be
indicated in patients with prior history of
severe spinal headache (see below under
Post-procedure monitoring).
2. Chemotherapy agent(s) to be adminis-
tered. Errors have occurred in the past with
vincristine being inadvertently administered
intrathecally. This is almost uniformly fatal.
This drug should never be brought into the
room of a patient undergoing an LP with IT
chemotherapy.
Procedure
1. Proper positioning is the key to a success-
ful procedure. The lateral decubitus position
may be used for a sedated or small patient.
The patient should be placed on a ﬁrm bed,
head ﬂexed with chin to chest, and legs
maximally ﬂexed toward the head. Ensure
the hips and shoulders are aligned and the
back is straight. Alternatively, an awake
patient may prefer the sitting position, ﬂexed
forward, and supported by the assistant.
2. Identify the landmark with palpation of
the interspaces. The L4–5 interspace is
located by a perpendicular line at the top
of the iliac crests; either this space or the one
above (L3–4) may be used.
3. Some centers require the person per-
forming the procedure to wear a mask to
prevent infection. Put on sterile gloves and
set up the tray.
4. Prepare the skin surface in a sterile man-
ner with providone iodine solution begin-
ning at the site of puncture, working out-
ward with friction. Repeat for a total of three
scrubs. The skin may then be cleansed with
alcohol. Place a fenestrated drape over the
site and ensure an adequate sterile ﬁeld with
additional drapes as desired.
5. Have the assistant transfer the chemo-
therapy in a sterile manner to the sterile
syringe on the tray. Open all CSF collection
tubes.
6. Administer local anesthetic with preser-
vative-free 1% lidocaine with a 25 gauge
needle, if desired. Awake patients may prefer
application of a topical lidocaine anesthetic
(LMX or EMLA) or ethyl chloride cold
spray. Local anesthesia is not necessary in
the anesthetized patient.
7. Insert the spinal needle into the midline of
the interspace with the bevel up, directed at
a slight (10–20) angle toward the umbilicus.
Ensure the needle is perpendicular to the
surface. Advance the needle; if bony resis-
tance is noted, draw back and reposition. The
less experienced practitioner should check
for CSF ﬂow every 2 to 3 mm by withdrawing
the stylet and looking at the translucent
window hub for visualization of CSF. If
blood is returned, the needle should be
removed and the procedure be reattempted
one interspace higher. The most experienced
practitioner should assume responsibility for
subsequent LPs.
8. Once clear CSF return is established,
rotate the needle 90 counterclockwise
(bevel in transverse plane) for patients in
the lateral decubitus position to increase
rapidity of CSF ﬂow and allow for easier
administration
of
the
chemotherapy.
Patients in the sitting forward position
do not usually need repositioning of the
needle. Obtain the desired amount of
CSF in 2 or 3 collection tubes. Tradition-
ally the volume of CSF withdrawn should
approximate the volume of medication
Guide to Procedures
293

administered. CSF should be collected in
one tube for a chamber count (red blood
cell and white blood cell counts) and a
second tube for cytology (assessment of
morphology). Additional tubes may be
necessary for culture, immunohistochem-
istry, or any special studies such as myelin
basic protein, tumor markers, or research
studies. Glucose and protein are checked
initially for all patients, though not rou-
tinely
for
leukemia
patients
receiving
intrathecal chemotherapy.
9. For intrathecal administration of che-
motherapy,
attach
the
chemotherapy
syringe to the spinal needle, ensuring no
advancement or withdrawal of the spinal
needle and a tight ﬁt to avoid leakage. One
can attempt to withdraw CSF to assure
proper placement (will see a mix in the
syringe) but this may not be possible and
is not necessary. Slowly inject the chemo-
therapy over 1 to 2 minutes. There should
be no resistance.
10. Chemotherapy should not be adminis-
tered when any of the following situations
exist: the spinal ﬂuid is bloody indicating
puncture of a vessel; the patient is moving
not allowing for a safe procedure; the che-
motherapy does not advance easily and
when the syringe is removed, the ﬂow of
CSF has stopped or greatly diminished; the
chemotherapy drug or dose is incorrect; or
the awake patient experiences pain with
injection.
11. Remove the needle. Apply gentle pres-
sure, cleanse as necessary with alcohol, and
place a dry sterile dressing.
12. Assess patient for any adverse effect of
the procedure. Have the patient in the
supine position.
13. Label all CSF tubes and send to the lab.
14. Document the procedure in the medical
record.
15. Follow up with the patient and family as
to the results of the procedure, including
interpretation of the CSF specimens.
Post-procedure monitoring
and complications
1. Observe the patient for 1 hour or until
fully recovered from anesthesia with appro-
priate postanesthesia monitoring. Most cen-
ters direct that patients remain in a supine
position (without head pillow, mild Tren-
delenburg position) for 1 hour post-proce-
dure to minimize spinal headache and assist
with dilution and ﬂow of chemotherapy in
the CSF.
2. Patients should be monitored for signs of
bleeding, pain at site, headache, nausea,
vomiting, or change in neurologic status.
In addition to monitoring for post-procedure
complications, the patient’s cardiovascular
and respiratory status should be monitored
along with frequent vital signs until recovered
from anesthesia.
3. Headache
occurs
following
lumbar
puncture in a small percentage of patients,
primarily adolescents and females. Typi-
cally, onset of headache is within 12 hours
to 5 days of the procedure and is due to a
slow leakage of CSF from the puncture site
(though may not be visible externally).
Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting,
dizziness, neck stiffness, light sensitivity,
and diminished hearing or vision. These
symptoms may be worse in a standing
position.
a. Patients are instructed to take ﬂuids
liberally in addition to caffeine (highly
caffeinated sodas or coffee) with onset of
symptoms and after subsequent LPs.
b. Patients with severe headache or neu-
rologic symptoms should be evaluated
immediately. If a postdural puncture
headache is suspected, treatment is ini-
tiated with caffeine, ﬂuids, and narcotics.
If these steps are ineffective, a dural
blood patch may be performed by an
anesthesiologist to provide immediate
relief.
c. Use of a pencil point spinal needle
(Whitacre) for subsequent LPs should be
294
Chapter 31

considered for these patients. These nee-
dles are designed to spread the dural
ﬁbers and help reduce the frequency and
severity of postdural headaches. They
can be more difﬁcult to use and may
require an introducer to puncture the
skin and soft tissues.
4. Fever may occur following administra-
tion of intrathecal chemotherapy. Some
drugs (e.g., cytarabine) have been impli-
cated in causing fever; however, the patient
should be assessed for presumed infection.
Frequently patients have indwelling central
venous catheters and are receiving other
immunosuppressive
therapy.
Evaluation
should be comprehensive and may include
hospitalization for observation and admin-
istration of intravenous antibiotics.
5. Patients may experience pain or bleeding
at the LP site for several days. The patient
should be evaluated and if experiencing
minor bleeding, be treated with local therapy
(dry sterile bandaging) and pain medication
as needed. Prolonged or heavy bleeding
requires immediate evaluation including
physical examination and imaging.
6. Neurotoxicity may occur related to the
intrathecal medication or related to nerve
damage
secondary
to
the
procedure.
Patients should be evaluated immediately
and intervention be taken as appropriate.
Intra-Ommaya reservoir tap and
injection of chemotherapy
Indications
See Lumbar puncture/intrathecal chemother-
apy. The Ommaya reservoir is an intraven-
tricular catheter with a reservoir implanted
under the scalp that allows for administration
of chemotherapy or other medication directly
into the ventricular system, in addition to
facilitating sampling the CSF. Although they
are placed infrequently, they are useful in the
management of patients for whom it is dif-
ﬁcult to perform LPs for any reason. They are
also used in patients who suffer a CNS relapse
of their leukemia and require frequent
administration of intrathecal chemotherapy.
Practitioners may opt to administer chemo-
therapy in reduced dosing compared to stan-
dard intrathecal dosing (50% to 100% of IT
dosing) or give small daily dosing for up to
4 days (based on the concept of concentration
 time to optimize therapeutic beneﬁt).
Pretreatment evaluation
The same principles apply as in Lumbar
puncture/intrathecal chemotherapy. Patients
are not sedated for this procedure.
Materials
1. Standard LP tray, two 5 mL sterile syrin-
ges for chemotherapy transfer and CSF col-
lection, 25 g butterﬂy needle, mask, razor,
antibacterial soap, 4  4 sterile gauze, pro-
vidone iodine and alcohol, and two sets of
sterile gloves.
2. Chemotherapy agent(s) to be adminis-
tered. Do not bring vincristine into the room.
Procedure
1. The patient is placed in a supine or
sitting position. If needed, the reservoir area
is shaved.
2. Topical anesthesia may be achieved with
lidocaine gels (EMLA or LMX) prior to the
procedure.
3. While wearing a mask and sterile gloves,
the LP tray is set up.
4. Prepare the skin surface overlying the
reservoir site by cleansing with sterile gauze
moistened with an antibacterial soap in a
circular fashion, three times. Change gloves.
Continue with a routine sterile prep with
three providone iodine scrubs and alcohol
wipes. Place a fenestrated drape over the site
and ensure an adequate sterile ﬁeld with
additional drapes as desired.
Guide to Procedures
295

5. Have the assistant transfer the chemo-
therapy in a sterile manner to the sterile
syringe on the tray. Open all CSF collection
tubes.
6. Holding the reservoir ﬁrmly with one
hand, puncture the reservoir site with a
25 g butterﬂy needle. The CSF is allowed
to drip (or is slowly withdrawn) from the
butterﬂy into a sterile tube. The total
volume collected should approximate the
total volume of chemotherapy and normal
saline ﬂush to be delivered. CSF should be
collected in one tube for a chamber count
and a second tube for cytology. Additional
tubes may be necessary for culture, immu-
nohistochemistry, or any special studies
such as myelin basic protein, tumor mar-
kers, or research studies. Glucose and
protein
are
checked
initially
for
all
patients, though not routinely for leuke-
mia
patients
receiving
intra-Ommaya
chemotherapy.
7. The chemotherapy is injected over 2 to
3 minutes. Do not give the chemotherapy if
the CSF is blood tinged.
8. The needle is removed and ﬁrm pressure
is applied to the site for several minutes. A
spot bandage is applied.
9. Assess the patient for any adverse effects
from the procedure.
10. Label all CSF tubes and send to the
lab.
11. Follow up with the patient and family as
to the results of the procedure, including
interpretation of the CSF specimens.
Post-procedure monitoring
and complications
1. Document in the patient’s chart details
of the procedure, chemotherapy adminis-
tered, specimens collected, and the patient’s
status after the procedure.
2. See Post-procedure monitoring for LP
regarding complications such as headache,
fever, bleeding, or neurologic changes.
Bone marrow aspiration
and biopsy
Indications
The purpose of bone marrow aspiration
or biopsy is to obtain tissue for diagnostic
and staging evaluation of malignancies,
marrow inﬁltrative diseases, or marrow
failure states.
Pretreatment evaluation
1. Review of systems including recent ill-
nesses or back pain.
2. Physical examination should be per-
formed prior to the procedure, with vitals
and assessment for any evidence of infection
or metabolic abnormalities to assure safety
for anesthesia. Evaluate site of procedure
to assure no localized infection or skin
breakdown.
3. Routine laboratory studies may include a
complete blood count, chemistries, and
coagulation studies. No speciﬁc platelet
count is necessary for the procedure. The
anesthesiologist will want to ensure an ade-
quate hemoglobin level and be aware of any
metabolic abnormalities.
4. The technician to assist with the marrow
slide preparation should be present at the
start of the procedure with appropriate
materials.
Materials
1. Biopsy tray with providone iodine,
alcohol, 4  4 gauze, 20 mL syringes (2
to 4 depending on samples to be col-
lected), 16 gauge bone marrow aspirate
needle, 11 gauge 4 in. or 13 gauge 3.5 in.
Jamshidi biopsy needle (or similar), 22
to 25 gauge needles, sterile gloves, and
Elastoplast adhesive or other pressure
dressing.
2. EDTA and heparin to anticoagulate sam-
ples, lidocaine 1% for local anesthesia.
296
Chapter 31

Procedure
1. Position patient in a prone or lateral
decubitus position with a small lift under
the hip to accentuate the posterior iliac
crests. Identify the posterior superior iliac
spine. Have assistant secure patient’s posi-
tion. At times, other locations for bone
marrow specimen collection are necessary
(infants, children on ventilators, and so on)
and may include the anterior iliac spine,
tibia, sternum, or other sites.
2. Put on gloves and set up sterile tray.
3. Scrub the site with providone iodine,
applying some friction, beginning at the
site and moving outward, and repeating
for a total of three scrubs. Repeat procedure
with alcohol swabs. Allow to dry and apply
sterile drapes.
4. Administer local anesthetic with a 22 to
25 gauge needle. This is often done in the
sedated patient to minimize post-procedure
discomfort. Local anesthesia is achieved
with lidocaine 1% (2 to 3 mL depending
on size of the patient) injected down to and
including the periosteum.
5. Prepare marrow aspirate and/or biopsy
needles, ensuring the stylets are freely
removable. Prime syringes as per institu-
tional protocol with heparin, EDTA, etc.
Ensure inner side of syringe is coated with
anticoagulant, if being used.
6. Holding skin taught with outstretched
ﬁngers, insert the bone marrow aspiration
needle (with stylet in place) initially at an
angle to the skin and then perpendicular to
the iliac spine once through the skin. With
gradual, controlled pressure and a gentle
twisting motion, insert the needle into the
iliac spine. Once through the cortex, the
needle will “give” as it enters the marrow
space and a crunching sound or feeling may
be appreciated. The stylet should then be
removed, and the needle should remain
ﬁrmly in place. A 20 mL syringe is then
ﬁrmly attached to the hub of the aspiration
needle. Holding onto both the needle and
syringe,
constant
and
strong
pressure
should be applied to draw up marrow into
the syringe. If awake, the patient may expe-
rience a shooting sensation down the legs at
the time of aspiration. Aspirate approxi-
mately 1 to 2 mL of marrow, detach the
syringe carefully, and hand the specimen
immediately to the technician for quick
visual inspection for marrow tissue (fat,
spicules). Once this has been conﬁrmed,
obtain additional marrow as needed with
the other primed syringes. Once complete,
remove the needle. If marrow is not visible
and the sample is thought to represent
peripheral blood, reposition the needle and
reattempt an aspirate.
7. A bone marrow biopsy may be obtained
from the same side and skin puncture site as
the aspirate. The needle should be inserted
into a fresh spot on the iliac spine (although
should utilize the same skin puncture site).
Holding the skin tight, insert the bone
marrow (trephine) biopsy needle (with cut-
ting trocar in place) holding at an angle
until through the skin, then placing perpen-
dicular to the spine and inserting with
strong, controlled pressure until the needle
is ﬁrmly anchored into the cortex. Remove
the trocar and holding the foreﬁnger along
the needle at the desired depth of the core
biopsy (5 to 20 mm depending on size of the
patient), insert the needle with a ﬁrm twist-
ing pressure. The needle is then rocked in
four angles (i.e., sideways as well as up and
down) to break off the core marrow biopsy
sample at the base and then the needle is
removed. The provided push rod (no sharp
edge) is inserted into the sharp end of the
needle and the biopsy is pushed out gently
onto sterile gauze. It is then examined to
ensure that adequate marrow tissue is pres-
ent. If so, it is given to the technician.
8. Apply pressure for several minutes,
cleanse the site with alcohol swabs, and
apply a Band-Aid. If needed, a dry 4  4
folded into quarters may be applied over the
Guide to Procedures
297

Band-Aid with an elastic tape such as
Elastoplast.
9. Assess the patient for any adverse effect
of the procedure.
10. Document procedure(s) in the medical
record.
11. Follow up with the patient and family to
ensure completion of procedure, explana-
tion of any complications, review care of
wound, and follow up on results of studies
done on specimens obtained.
Post-procedure monitoring
and complications
1. Patients may be discharged from the
recovery area after appropriate monitoring
postanesthesia.
2. The pressure dressing, if used, should be
removed after 6 hours and the Band-Aid
after 24 hours. The parents should inspect
the site for evidence of infection, bleeding,
or other drainage. If noted, a practitioner
should be contacted and the site be evalu-
ated. Pain medications including acetamin-
ophen, acetaminophen with codeine, or
occasionally an intravenous narcotic may
be administered for local pain (especially
following biopsy). Patients may feel achy or
bruised for several days following the pro-
cedure. Discomfort can also be alleviated
with a warm pack.
3. Patients may resume normal activities as
desired.
Administration of peripheral
chemotherapy
Indications
Intravenous (IV) chemotherapy may be
given into a central venous catheter (CVC)
or by peripheral vein administration in
patients without a CVC. Many patients may
have had their catheters removed due to
infection, thrombosis, or electively in order
for the patient to resume more normal
activities. In the hands of experienced
practitioners, administration of push intra-
venous chemotherapy is a safe alternative to
the use of a CVC. Vincristine is frequently
administered via peripheral vein in the out-
patient setting during maintenance phases
of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leuke-
mia. Peripheral access should not be used
routinely for infusional chemotherapy due
to the difﬁculty in monitoring and ensuring
continued patency of the IV during infu-
sion. Many chemotherapeutic drugs are
vesicants and may cause signiﬁcant injury
with extravasation (see Chapter 32).
Pretreatment evaluation
1. Review the patient’s chemotherapy reg-
imen to determine what medications are to
be administered and at what dose. The
patient’s height, weight, and total body
surface area are veriﬁed with the dosage
calculations.
2. Ensure that required laboratory criteria
have been met (e.g., absolute neutrophil
count, platelet count, and transaminases)
as directed by the treatment protocol.
3. Complete a physical examination on the
patient and assess the adequacy of veni-
puncture sites.
4. Verify the labels on the syringe(s) of the
drug(s) against the patient’s chart and
orders to ensure accuracy.
5. Prepare the patient for the procedure.
Explain the procedure, taking into account
the patient’s age, developmental status, and
prior experience with the procedure. Elicit
the patient’s help by encouraging him/her to
hold as still as possible. Enlist the assistance
of the parent(s) and staff (including child
life) as needed. Explain each step as you go;
be honest, thorough, and patient. Establish
a routine with each patient; many also like
to have the same practitioner if possible
(conﬁdence boosting).
6. Patients
desiring
topical
anesthesia
should have a topical lidocaine gel (EMLA
or LMX) applied 30 to 60 minutes in
298
Chapter 31

advance of the procedure. This may result in
vasoconstriction and increase difﬁculty of
access in some patients.
Materials
1. Chemotherapy (premixed by pharmacy
in enclosed syringe).
2. 25 g butterﬂy needle, stopcock, alcohol
wipes, gauze (2  2), tourniquet, 10 mL
saline ﬂush, bandage, and gloves.
Procedure
1. Assemble equipment; attach butterﬂy
tubing to stopcock, attach chemotherapy
syringe to right side of stopcock, attach
saline ﬂush syringe to remaining junction
of stopcock, and ﬂush stopcock and butter-
ﬂy with saline.
2. Select an appropriate vein, preferably on
the dorsum of the hand or foot. Ask the
child to assume a comfortable position that
also allows for easy access to the desired
vein. Avoid the antecubital fossae or joint
spaces due to the possibility of deep extrav-
asation of chemotherapy with resultant
injury.
3. Clean the venipuncture site with alcohol
and apply tourniquet. Let air dry or wipe dry
with clean gauze. Insert butterﬂy needle
with bevel pointed up. Advance needle until
blood returns. When blood returns, remove
tourniquet, connect stopcock, and ﬂush
line with 2 to 3 mL of saline.
4. If no sign of inﬁltration occurs (e.g., pain
or swelling) and blood return continues,
administer chemotherapy slowly via IV
push, checking intermittently every 5 to
10 seconds for blood return or swelling.
When
chemotherapy
administration
is
completed, ﬂush with remaining saline.
5. Remove butterﬂy and apply pressure for
1 to 2 minutes with clean gauze. Apply
bandage.
6. Document in the patient’s chart the
indication for and details of the proce-
dure, medication, dosage, site, and any
complications.
Post-procedure monitoring
and complications
If inﬁltration has occurred, see Chapter 32.
Areas that may have sustained tissue dam-
age should not be used for future adminis-
tration of chemotherapy. At times, subclin-
ical burns and scarring may occur and can
appear as hyperpigmented areas.

Treatment of
Chemotherapy
Extravasations
Extravasation is the leakage of an intrave-
nous (IV) drug into the surrounding tissues.
Local reactions from extravasation of a ves-
icant chemotherapy agent can range from
mild pain and erythema to tissue necrosis,
ulceration, and damage to tendons and
nerves. Cytotoxic drugs are classiﬁed as irri-
tants or vesicants (causing blisters), depend-
ing on their potential for local toxicity.
* Extravasation of an irritant drug may
cause an inﬂammatory reaction, with pain,
burning, tightness, or phlebitis at the nee-
dle insertion site or along the vein. Clinical
signs include warmth, erythema, and ten-
derness in the area of extravasation, but
there is no tissue sloughing or necrosis.
Symptoms are typically of short duration
(days)
and
there
are
no
long-lasting
sequelae. An irritant may cause a soft tissue
ulcer if a large amount of concentrated
drug solution is inadvertently extravasated
causing an inﬂammatory reaction; again,
this will not result in persistent tissue
damage.
* Extravasation of a vesicant drug may
cause tissue necrosis with a more severe
or lasting injury. Clinical signs and symp-
toms may be similar to extravasated irri-
tants. Vesicant extravasation may result in
loss of the full thickness of the skin and,
if severe, underlying structures.
The incidence of vesicant extravasation
injury ranges from 0.5% to 6% in peripheral
IV infusions and 0.3% to 4.7% in implanted
venous access port infusions, although real-
istically the incidence is likely higher as
many milder events may not be reported
by patients. Treatment of an extravasation
is determined by the particular chemother-
apy agent involved, although the efﬁcacy of
such therapy may be modest. Prevention is
the key, and every possible measure should
be taken to avoid such a complication. If it
is anticipated that a patient will need fre-
quent or prolonged infusions of vesicants, it
is advisable to place a central venous cath-
eter for safer drug administration. Rarely,
extravasation may occur even with such
a device.
The causes of extravasation are multiple
and largely preventable. Factors that place
children at risk for peripheral IV extravasa-
tion include poor vein selection, multiple
venous punctures to establish a patent
IV, obesity, dehydration, inability to report
pain
at
the
injection
site,
a
moving
patient, and inexperience of the individual

administering the chemotherapy. Risk fac-
tors for extravasation from central venous
catheters include needle displacement, cath-
eter migration, or ﬁbrin sheath formation
and
thrombosis.
Mechanical
occlusions
may be due to thrombus formation, drug
precipitation, and positional catheter occlu-
sion or kinking of the line. Avoidance of
extravasation depends on proper placement
and maintenance of IV access and frequent
monitoring. Recommendations to prevent
extravasation are:
* Venipuncture and placement of the can-
nula or other intravenous access performed
by experienced personnel.
* Vesicants should be administered in
accordance with the manufacturers’ recom-
mendations (e.g., proper dilution and spec-
iﬁed administration time) with proper ver-
iﬁcation and identiﬁcation (patient and
protocol speciﬁc).
* Avoid multiple venipunctures in the same
area. Do not use a vein distal to a recent
venipuncture site as the vesicant may leak
from one of these proximal sites.
* Instruct the patient to avoid movement.
In young children, this may require addi-
tional physical assistance for holding or
coaxing with diversion techniques.
* Never use a previously placed IV access
device; a new IV cannula should be placed
immediately
prior
to
delivery
of
the
medication.
* Choose a large, intact visible vein with
good blood ﬂow.
* Use the smallest needle or cannula pos-
sible for venipuncture. Check the patency of
the device by aspirating blood, as well as
patency of the vein by ﬂushing with the
carrier solution (normal saline), before
administering the medication. Obtain a
blood return prior to, and during, vesicant
administration.
* The intravenous infusion should ﬂow
freely without pressure. The local area
should not swell, become erythematous,
or cause pain. If this occurs, immediately
stop the infusion and attempt to withdraw
any medication in the needle/cannula.
* After infusing the medication, ﬂush the
vein with 3 to 10 mL of the carrier solution.
Do not continue to ﬂush if resistance is met
or a local reaction suggesting a blown vein
occurs.
Each incident of extravasation should be
documented and reported.
Although this complication is frequently
encountered with antineoplastic agents, a
number of other drugs can also act as vesi-
cants if extravasated into the surrounding
tissues. These noncytotoxic drugs include
alcohol, aminophylline, digoxin, nafcillin,
phenytoin, tetracycline, and total parenteral
nutrition. Among cytotoxic drugs that cause
extravasation injury, the anthracyclines are
among the most important, both because of
their widespread use in various chemother-
apeutic protocols and because of their abil-
ity to produce severe tissue damage and
necrosis. The extent of tissue damage
depends on the chemotherapeutic agent’s
binding capacity to DNA.
DNA-binding agents include anthracy-
clines, antitumor antibiotics, platinum ana-
logues, and some alkylating agents. These
drugs cause tissue damage by propagating
lethal DNA crosslinking or strand breaks
caused by free radicals, which lead to cell
apoptosis. As the cells die, the drug is
released and enters undamaged cells. This
further increases the area of damage and
slows healing. Injuries from doxorubicin
may continue for weeks.
Non-DNA-binding antineoplastics (vinca
alkaloids, taxanes, and topoisomerase inhibi-
tors) also function as vesicants by interfering
with mitosis. These agents clear more easily
from extravasation sites and cause less dam-
age than the DNA-binding agents. The tissue
often resembles a chemical burn and heals
more quickly.

Chapter 32

The signs and symptoms of extravasa-
tion may be readily apparent with pain and
erythema although it may take days for the
full extent of the epithelial damage to be
evident. Discoloration and skin induration
may progress with the development of blis-
ters or necrosis and possibly ulceration or
deep tissue injury. Patients may develop
scarring or permanent hyperpigmentation
at the site of drug extravasation. These sites
should not be utilized for subsequent
administration of chemotherapy or place-
ment of an IV device.
Treatment should begin immediately
with discontinuation of the chemotherapy
and cooling or dilution of the site. Initial
treatment includes an attempt to aspirate
the vesicant with a 10 mL syringe. Clinicians
should work quickly to reduce morbidity
and avoid further patient harm. Manage-
ment of nonvesicant extravasation includes
elevation and cooling and does not usually
include the use of pharmacologic therapy.
An exception to the cooling technique is
extravasation with
vinca alkaloids (see
Table 32.1) for which local heat is applied.
For other vesicant extravasations, including
anthracyclines, initial treatment is geared
toward localizing and neutralizing the agent
with cold compresses, thus limiting its
uptake into cells. The placement of extrav-
asation kits that contain syringes and can-
nulas, cold and hot packs, gauze pads, sterile
and chemoprotective gloves, and medica-
tions to treat extravasation in locations
where chemotherapy is administered will
facilitate early treatment (see Table 32.1).
In addition to local care and possible phar-
macologic antidotes, topical hydrocortisone
1% and pain medications may alleviate local
discomfort.

AMPHOTERICIN B
Fungizone, Amphocin
Polyene antifungal
Injection: 50 mg vial
Pregnancy category B
Indications:
Treatment of severe systemic infections and
meningitis caused by susceptible fungi such
as Candida species, Histoplasma capsulatum,
Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus species,
Blastomyces dermatitidis, Torulopsis glabrata,
Coccidioides
immitis,
Mucormycoses,
and
Rhizopus. Also used empirically to treat sus-
pected invasive fungal disease in immuno-
compromised hosts with prolonged fever and
neutropenia. May be given intrathecally or
via bladder irrigation for localized therapy.
Dosage:
Optional test dose: 0.1 mg/kg to a maximum
of 1 mg IV over 20 to 60 minutes
Initial dose: 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/day
The daily dose is increased by 0.25 mg/kg
until the desired daily dose is reached. In
critically ill patients, rapid escalation of
dosing may be needed.
Empiric dose is 0.6 mg/kg/day
Therapeutic dose for conﬁrmed invasive
fungal infection is 0.6 to 1 mg/kg/day. Daily
infusion is over 2 to 6 hours, depending on
the infusion tolerability. Salt loading with
10 to 15 mL/kg of normal saline prior to
each infusion may prevent hypokalemia
and nephrotoxicity. Premedication is fre-
quently needed with acetaminophen and/
or diphenhydramine, and if the patient
experiences rigors, meperidine hydrochlo-
ride may be given. Once therapy has been
established, alternate-day dosing may be
administered at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg/
every other day.
Notes:
Because of the nephrotoxic potential of this
drug, avoidance of other nephrotoxic med-
ications is advised, if possible. Monitor
daily electrolytes, renal and hepatic studies,
and urine output. Common metabolic
abnormalities include hypokalemia, hypo-
magnesemia, and hypocalcemia. Other pro-
blems that may occur are thrombocytope-
nia, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, dyspnea, back
pain, and increases in transaminases and
bilirubin. Common infusion-related toxici-
ties are fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting,
hypotension,
and
headache.

ASPARAGINASE
L-Asparaginase, (Elspar [native or Escheri-
chia coli], Erwinase [Erwinia chrysanthemia])
PEG-asparaginase
(polyethylene
glycol
asparaginase; Oncaspar)
Antineoplastic, results in asparagine deple-
tion in malignant cells
Injection: 10,000 unit vial (Elspar)
10,000 unit vial (Erwinase)
3,750 unit vial (Oncaspar)
Pregnancy category C
Indications:
Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL).CurrentandfuturetrialsforALLtreat-
ment largely incorporate PEG-asparagase
during induction therapy due to an increased
rapid early response compared to the native
form, prolonged half-life, and decreased like-
lihood of developing neutralizing antibodies
during later phases of therapy. Due to the
longerhalf-lifeofthepegylatedform(5.8days
in children compared to 1.24 days with native
and 0.65days with Erwinase),longer intervals
for therapy are suggested. Recent studies have
established safety of the intravenous prepara-
tion, thereby decreasing the pain associated
with intramuscular injection of the drug.
Erwinase has traditionally been utilized if
hypersensitivity develops to the native or
pegylated forms, although its availability may
be limited.
Dosage:
Refer to individual protocol.
Usual dose in ALL of PEG-asparagase is
2500 IU/m2 IV/IM every 2 to 4 weeks
(induction,
delayed
intensiﬁcation,
and
interim maintenance phases).
Dose for native (E. coli) L-asparaginase is
6000 units/m2 IM three times a week for
nine doses. High-dose protocols may give
15,000 to 20,000 IU/m2/dose.
Dose for Erwinia
L-asparaginase is per
protocol.
Maximum 2 mL volume per injection site.
Many patients require multiple injections.
IM administration results in delayed peak
plasma concentration compared with IV
administration.
Patients should be observed in a clinic or
hospitalsettingforatleast1hourafteradmin-
istration to monitor for a hypersensitivity
reaction. Appropriate agents for treatment
ofhypersensitivity shouldbe readily available
(oxygen, epinephrine, antihistamines, intra-
venous steroids) in addition to resuscitative
equipment.
Notes:
Do not give to patients with prior signiﬁcant
pancreatitis associated with asparaginase.
Hypersensitivity to E. coli or pegylated aspar-
aginase necessitates a switch to the Erwinia
form or omission of future doses. Patients
who have had a signiﬁcant hemorrhagic or
thrombotic event should have levels of ﬁbrin-
ogen and antithrombin III checked and may
be rechallenged with future doses if with
improvement in their symptoms and nor-
malization of their laboratory parameters.
Use with caution in patients with hepatic
impairment or in those receiving other hep-
atotoxic drugs. Use with caution in patients
receiving anticoagulation or nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory agents (NSAIDs). Aspar-
aginase may cause hyperglycemia, hyperuri-
cemia, hyperammonemia, hypoﬁbrinogen-
emia, thrombosis, hemorrhage, anaphylaxis,
and hemorrhagic cystitis. Dexamethasone
may alleviate allergic symptoms.

rently being investigated in pediatric pro-
tocols for the treatment of brain tumors,
refractory or recurrent solid tumors, and
neuroﬁbromatosis.
Dosage:
Refer to individual protocol.
15 mg/kg q2 weeks in 28-day cycles as a
single agent or
5 to 10 mg/kg q2 weeks in combination
regimens.
Notes:
Avoid use in patients with recent surgery,
hemoptysis, gastrointestinal or central ner-
vous system bleeding, or any other serious
bleeding. The interval required between
surgery and drug administration to avoid
impairment in wound healing has not been
determined. General recommendation is to
allow 28 days prior to and following major
surgery. Use with caution in patients with
thrombocytopenia. An increased risk of
thromboembolic events have been reported
in combination regimens. May impair fer-
tility and have adverse effects on fetal devel-
opment; adequate contraception must be
used during therapy. May cause infusional
toxicity (discontinue infusion until symp-
toms abate) or proteinuria. May potentiate
cardiac effects of anthracyclines. Discon-
tinue therapy in patients who develop ﬁs-
tulas, hypertensive crisis, encephalopathy,
or nephrotic syndrome.

May be given as continuous IV infusion 15
to 20 IU/m2/day over 24 hours for 3 to 5
days in some protocols.
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to bleomycin. Premedication
with acetaminophen, hydrocortisone, and
antihistamine may decrease infusional tox-
icity. Dose may need to be modiﬁed for
renal or pulmonary toxicity. Monitor renal
function studies and pulmonary function,
including forced expiratory volume in 1
minute, forced vital capacity, and carbon
monoxide diffusion in lungs.

>12 kg: 0.8 mg/kg/dose q6h for 16 doses
over 4 consecutive days
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to busulfan; should not be used in
pregnancy or while nursing. May cause
severe bone marrow suppression. Use with
caution with other myelosuppressive drugs
or radiation. May cause hemorrhagic cysti-
tis. Use with thioguanine may increase
hepatic toxicity. Patients with a known sei-
zure history or those at risk for seizures (e.g.,
sickle cell disease) should be placed on a
prophylactic antiepileptic drug while receiv-
ing busulfan.
Metabolism of busulfan may be inhib-
ited by antifungal agents (azoles), CYP3A4
inhibitors, dasatinib, and metronidazole
leading to increased levels and effect.
Busulfan metabolism may be potenti-
ated by CYP3A4 inducers, deferasirox, and
Echinacea, leading to decreased levels and
effect.
CARBOPLATIN
Paraplatin-AQ, generic
Antineoplastic, alkylating agent
Injection: 50, 150, and 450 mg vials
Pregnancy category D
Indications:
Treatment of pediatric brain tumors, neu-
roblastoma, testicular tumors, relapsed leu-
kemia, and solid tumors.
Dosage:
Refer to individual protocol. Many require
dose calculation using the modiﬁed Calvert
formula to achieve the appropriate area
under the curve for concentration over time
rather than dosing by body surface area. IV
administration over 15 minutes to 1 hour is
less toxic than bolus dosing.
Solid tumors:
400 to 560 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks or per
protocol
Brain tumor protocols:
175 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks, then 2 week
recovery
Dose is adjusted based on suppression of
neutrophil and platelet counts or renal
toxicity
Bone marrow transplant preparative regimen:
500 mg/m2/day for 3 days
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to carboplatin, cisplatin, or other
platinum-containing
compounds.
Ana-
phylaxis may occur within minutes of
administration. May cause hypotension,
electrolyte abnormalities, nausea, hearing
loss, and peripheral neuropathy. Severe
marrow suppression or vomiting may
occur. Reduce dose in impaired renal func-
tion (creatinine clearance <60 mL/min)
utilizing the modiﬁed Calvert formula.
Aminoglycosides
may
increase
serum
levels/effects of carboplatin and augment
ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity; nephro-
toxic drugs may increase renal toxicity of
carboplatin. Avoid concomitant adminis-
tration of topotecan and taxanes.

ister in two divided oral doses per day.
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to cyclosporine (castor oil is an
ingredient in the preparation). May cause
nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, hypomag-
nesemia,
hyperkalemia,
hyperuricemia,
hypertension, hursuitism, acne, gastrointes-
tinal symptoms, tremor, leukopenia, head-
ache, and gingival hyperplasia. Use with
caution with concomitant administration
of other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. amphoter-
icin B, aminoglycosides, tacrolimus, acyclo-
vir, NSAIDs). Requires close monitoring
of renal and hepatic function and frequent
determination of trough levels (drawn just
prior to dose at steady state).

Cyclosporine is a substrate for the
cytochrome P450 3A4 oxidase system.
Drug interactions include ketoconazole,
itraconazole, ﬂuconazole, erythromycin,
and methylprednisolone, which increase
the cyclosporine concentration by inhibit-
ing hepatic metabolism. Cimetidine may
increase cyclosporine concentration. Refer
to the Physicians’ Desk Reference for more
extensive drug interaction information.

soning; used in conjunction with edetate cal-
cium disodium to treat severe lead poisoning.
Dosage:
For severe lead poisoning (lead level 70 mcg/
dL) or encephalopathy:
25 mg/kg/day divided q4h deep IM for a
minimum of 72 hours, may give up to 5
days in severely symptomatic patients. Cal-
cium sodium EDTA should be started at a
dose of 50 mg/kg/day continuous IV infu-
sion immediately after the second dimer-
caprol dose. If symptoms of encephalopathy
persist, a second course of treatment can
begin after a minimum of 2 days of rest
following the initial 5-day course. Therapy
should be continued until the patient is
clinically stable. Once this occurs, a 10- to
14-day period of equilibration should occur
before again measuring the lead level. If the
level remains 70 mcg/dL, another course
of double therapy should be provided.
Less severe lead poisoning (45 to <70 mcg/dL):
Treatment with dimercaprol is not recom-
mended in this situation due to toxicity;
patients should be treated with succimer or
calcium disodium EDTA instead.
Notes:
Do not give to patients with hepatic or renal
insufﬁciency. Do not use in iron, selenium, or
cadmium poisoning. Use with caution in
patients with G6PD deﬁciency (may cause
hemolysis) and peanut sensitivity. Hydrate

Formulary

See Chapter 10 for further guidelines. Some
centers advocate that TPA be given con-
comitantly with enoxaparin in high risk
situations (i.e., large central embolism).
Prophylaxis or treatment with enoxaparin
may continue for prolonged periods depen-
dent on the underlying risks for thrombo-
philia and response to therapy. For those
patients that will be maintained with oral
anticoagulation (e.g., warfarin), 4 to 5 days
of overlap with enoxaparin should be given
in order to achieve a therapeutic interna-
tional normalized ratio (INR).
DVT/TE prophylaxis:
0.5 mg/kg q12h SC
Anti-factor Xa levels do not need to be
followed in patients on prophylactic dosing.
Data is limited but 1 mg/kg once daily dos-
ing can be considered in patients with com-
pliance issues and in those with difﬁculty
giving twice daily SC injections. An insuﬂon
catheter should also be considered.
Note: LMWH may be given IV at the same
dose as SC.
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to enoxaparin or pork products
(derived from porcine intestinal mucosa),
active major bleeding, prosthetic heart valves,
acute heparin-induced (or LMWH-induced)
thrombocytopenia, and recent major surgery
or cerebral hemorrhage. Use of the medica-
tion should be discussed in patients with
religious beliefs which prohibit the consump-
tion of pork products. Do not give to patients
with drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Use
with caution in patients with recurrent gas-
trointestinal ulcers, bleeding diathesis, and
severe renal dysfunction; lower initial doses
should be given to patients with renal insuf-
ﬁciency and failure. Do not use with concur-
rent spinal or epidural anesthesia or lumbar
puncture for chemotherapy. May cause fever,
confusion,
edema,
nausea,
hemorrhage,
hypochromic
anemia,
thrombocytopenia,
and pain/erythema at the injection site.
In case of overdose, protamine sulfate
can be given although the reversal is not
complete as with unfractionated heparin.
1 mg
of
protamine
sulfate
neutralizes
approximately 0.6 to 0.7 mg of enoxaparin.

tain the lowest hemoglobin sufﬁcient to
avoid transfusion, not to exceed 12 g/dL.
Anemia in AZT-treated HIV patients:
100 U/kg SC three times a week; dose range
50 to 4000 U/kg two to three times per week
Anemia in cancer patients:
600 U/kg IV once weekly; dose titrated to
effect (maximum 40,000 U). Do not initiate
therapy at Hgb  10 g/dL; adjust dose to
maintain the lowest Hgb level needed to
avoid transfusions. Adult dose 150 U/kg
Formulary
325

SC three times a week or 40,000 U SC once
weekly.
Anemia of prematurity:
No FDA-approved dosing regimen, a vari-
ety of different doses and schedules have
been used. Utility in decreasing need for
transfusion in VLBW and ELBW infants is
not well-proven.
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to albumin, uncontrolled hyper-
tension, and in newborns with neutropenia.
Use with caution in patients with porphyria
or a history of seizures. May cause headache
and elevated blood pressure. Meta-analyses
have shown that usage leads to a signiﬁcant
increased risk of death, thrombosis, and
serious cardiovascular events in cancer
patients.
Evaluate iron stores (ferritin and total
iron binding capacity [TIBC]) before ther-
apy initiation. Iron supplementation is
recommended unless iron stores are already
in excess.

FILGRASTIM
G-CSF
Neupogen
Blood formation, colony-stimulating factor
Injection: 300 mcg/mL (1, 1.6 mL)
Pregnancy category C
Indications:
Used to decrease the period of neutropenia
and the associated risk of infection in
patients with malignancies receiving mye-
losuppressive chemotherapy associated with
a signiﬁcant incidence (i.e., >20%) of severe
neutropenia. Has been used in zidovudine-
associated neutropenia in human immuno-
deﬁciency virus infected patients and in
patientswithnonchemotherapy-inducedneu-
tropenia (acquired and congenital). Should
be considered in patients with complicated
infection with underlying neutropenia.
Dosage:
Neonates: 5 to 10 mcg/kg IV/SC daily for
3 to 5 days in neutropenia with sepsis
Children and adults: 5 to 10 mcg/kg IV/SC
once daily until absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) is greater than 2 to 10  109/L
(per protocol; given beyond nadir period
7 to 10 days after chemotherapy admini-
stration).
Peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization:
10 mcg/kg SC daily for 4 days before the ﬁrst
leukapheresis
procedure
and
continued
until the last leukapheresis.
Congenital neutropenia:
2.5 to 6 mcg/kg/day SC; titrate dose to
desired ANC to prevent infection.
Idiopathic or cyclic neutropenia:
5 mcg/kg SC once daily; titrate dose to
desired ANC to prevent infection.
Elevation of ANC is usually within 24
hours, though it may be delayed in severe
myelosuppression. Transient increase in
ANC may occur when granulocyte col-
ony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is begun
shortly after completion of chemotherapy;
avoid premature discontinuation.
SC route of administration is preferred due
to prolonged serum levels over IV route.
If used IV and the G-CSF concentration
>15 mcg/mL, add 2 mg albumin/1 mL of
IV ﬂuid to prevent drug absorption in the
IV administration set.
Notes:
Avoid in patients with hypersensitivity to
Escherichia coli derived proteins or G-CSF.
May cause bone pain and increases in uric
acid and lactate dehydrogenase. Do not
administer 24 hours before or after admin-
istration of chemotherapy.

IDARUBICIN
Idamycin, generic
Antineoplastic antibiotic, anthracycline
Injection: 5, 10 mg
Pregnancy category D
Indications:
Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia
(APL), other types of acute myelogenous
leukemia,
and
relapsed
lymphoblastic
leukemia.
Dosage:
Refer to individual protocol.
APL induction:
12 mg/m2/day IV as 4 doses on alternating
days for 8 days
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to idarubicin, severe congestive
heart failure, or cardiomyopathy. Avoid in
preexisting
bone
marrow
suppression
unless the potential beneﬁt warrants the
risk. May need to reduce dosage with
impaired renal or hepatic function. Irrevers-
ible myocardial toxicity may occur as the
cumulative dosage approaches 550 mg/m2
(or 400 mg/m2 with chest irradiation or
concomitant cyclophosphamide adminis-
tration; based on anthracycline dose equiva-
lents, see Chapter 30). This may be an acute
or late effect and monitoring with ECHO or
MUGA and ECG is required per protocol.
Secondary leukemia has been reported.
IFOSFAMIDE
Ifex
Antineoplastic, alkylating agent
Injection: 1 g vial
Pregnancy category D
Indications:
Used in combination with certain other
antineoplastics in the treatment of Hodgkin
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lym-
phoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma, rhab-
domyosarcoma,
Ewing
sarcoma,
and
advanced Wilms tumor.
Dosage:
Refer to individual protocol.
Usual dose is 700 to 1800 mg/m2/day for 5
days every 3 to 4 weeks
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to ifosfamide. Avoid in severe
bone marrow suppression. Use with cau-
tion in impaired renal function; hydrate the
patient prior to administration and ensure
good urine ﬂow (i.e., urine speciﬁc gravity
1.010). Ifosfamide may lead to syndrome
of
inappropriate
antidiuretic
hormone
(SIADH) secretion. Mesna is used for uro-
protection with higher doses to decrease
risk of hemorrhagic cystitis. Urinalysis
should be monitored closely for speciﬁc
gravity and heme. May cause central ner-
vous system toxicity including hallucina-
tion, somnolence, confusion, coma, or
encephalopathy.

has
recovered:
ANC
1.5109/L
and
platelet
count
>100  109/L. If the patient has not recov-
ered following a 2 week rest, consider
discontinuing. May cause severe, dose-
limiting, and potentially fatal diarrhea.
Early diarrhea (during or shortly after infu-
sion) may be accompanied by symptoms of
rhinitis, increased salivation, ﬂushing, mio-
sis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, and abdomi-
nal cramping. Atropine 0.01 mg/kg IV
(maximum dose 0.4 mg) may be used to
prevent or treat symptoms.
Late diarrhea occurs >24 hours after
therapy and can be prolonged leading to
life-threatening dehydration and electro-
lyte imbalance. Treat promptly with loper-
amide until a normal pattern of bowel
movements returns. Antibiotic support
(ceﬁxime or cefpodoxime has been used
in children) as a prophylactic and treatment
measure.
If the patient develops persistent diar-
rhea, ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia,
interrupt or reduce subsequent doses. If
grade 3 (7 to 9 stools/day, incontinence,
and/or severe cramping) or grade 4 (10
stools/day, grossly bloody stool, and/or
need
for
parenteral
support)
diarrhea
occurs, interrupt treatment and reduce sub-
sequent dosing.
May cause severe myelosuppression; halt
for neutropenic fever. Use with caution in
patients with renal or hepatic impairment.

>20 kg: 100 mg
Parenteral administration:
IM: use Z-track technique (deep into upper
outer quadrant of buttock); test dose at
same site using the same method.
IV: infuse test dose over at least 5 minutes
(Dexferrum)
or
30
seconds
(INFeD);
dilute replacement dose in normal saline
(50 to 100 mL) to maximum concentra-
tion of 50 mg/mL and infuse over 1 to 6
hours at a maximum rate of 50 mg/min-
ute. Avoid dilution in dextrose due to an
increased incidence
of

patients with histories of signiﬁcant allergies,
asthma, serious hepatic impairment, preex-
istingcardiacdiseases,andrheumatoidarthri-
tis (may cause an exacerbation of arthritis).
Discontinue oral iron prior to initiating par-
enteral iron. Sweating, urticaria, arthralgia,
fever, chills, dizziness, headache, and nausea
maybedelayed24to48hoursafterlargedoses
of IV administered drug or 3 to 4 days fol-
lowing IM administration. The IV route is
preferred for patients with chronic renal dis-
ease and cancer related anemia (adults).
Agents for treatment of acute anaphylaxis
should be readily available. Adverse events
are much more associated with the high
molecular weight formulation (Dexferrum)
than with the low molecular weight formu-
lation (INFeD). We recommend usage of only
the low molecular weight formulation.
Total-dose infusions have been used
safely and are the preferred method of
administration,
though
not
currently
approved in the United States. Must wait
14 days after a dose for reequilibration if

weekly for three to ﬁve courses.
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to methotrexate, severe renal or
hepatic impairment, or preexisting profound
bone marrow suppression. High-dose meth-
otrexate (>1 g/m2) should not be adminis-
tered to patientswitha creatinine clearance of
less than 50% to 75% of normal. Patients
should receive alkaline ﬂuids to maintain
urine pH of 7 or higher while receiving
high-dose methotrexate. Follow serum levels

per protocol and administer leucovorin res-
cue per protocol; follow methotrexate degra-
dation curve per protocol. Methotrexate has
been associated with acute and severe chronic
hepatotoxicity, severe bone marrow suppres-
sion, and renal failure with delayed clearance,
high-dose administration, concurrent neph-
rotoxicdrugs,orinadequatehydration.Intra-
thecalandparenteraladministrationofmeth-
otrexate have been associated with acute neu-
rotoxicity. Severe dermatologic reactions and
radiation dermatitis have been reported. May
accumulate in ﬂuid collections (pleural effu-
sions, ascites) increasing local toxicity.
Ensure no TMP-SMX, penicillin, NSAIDs,
or PPIs are given until the methotrexate level
is <1  107 M due to competitive excretion
and risk of toxicity secondary to delayed
methotrexate clearance.
Intrathecal drugs should be prepared
and administered separately from other che-
motherapeutic drugs to avoid inappropriate
administration.
Recommend giving patients one pill size
only to avoid accidental overdose with dose
modiﬁcations during maintenance therapy
for ALL.

RASBURICASE
Elitek
Recombinant urate oxidase, uric acid low-
ering agent, antigout agent
Injection: 1.5, 7.5 mg vials
Pregnancy category C
Indications:
Initial management or prevention of hyper-
uricemia in high risk patients with leuke-
mia, lymphoma, or a select group of patients
with solid tumors at risk for tumor lysis
syndrome with initiation of chemotherapy.
Indicated only for short-term use; maxi-
mum of 5 days.
Dosage:
0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose IV over 30 minutes
(round down to nearest 1.5 mg). May repeat
q24h PRN up to 4 additional doses. Admin-
ister until the uric acid is normal and the
patient is stable. Most patients respond to
1 dose.
Give prior to chemotherapy if expected
massive tumor lysis and/or renal involve-
ment/dysfunction (e.g., Burkitt lymphoma
with bulky disease).
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to rasburicase. Contraindicated
in patients with G6PD deﬁciency (may
cause hemolysis) or severe asthma. Methe-
moglobinemia has been reported with
use. May cause vomiting, nausea, fever,
headache, abdominal pain, constipation,
diarrhea, and rash. When measuring serum
uric acid levels, ensure tubes are prechilled
and samples are placed in an ice water
bath and analyzed within 4 hours. Collec-
tion at room temperature may lead to
spuriously low uric acid levels due to con-
tinued degradation by rasburicase in the
sample.
RHD IMMUNE GLOBULIN
WinRho SDF, Rhophylac
Immune globulin
Injection: 600, 1500, 2500, 5000, 15,000 IU

Pregnancy category C
Indications:
Treatment of immune thrombocytopenic
purpura (ITP) in nonsplenectomized RhD-
positive patients; suppression of RhD isoim-
munization in an RhD-negative individual
exposed to RhD-positive blood or during
delivery (or pregnancy) of an RhD-positive
infant (if father known to be RhD-positive
or status unknown).
Dosage:
ITP:
Hemoglobin 10 g/dL: 50mcg/kg IV (250 IU/
kg), administer dose over 3 to 5 minutes
Hemoglobin <10 g/dL: 25 to 40 mcg/kg IV
(125 to 200 IU/kg)
New onset ITP: 75 mcg/kg (375 IU/kg) as a
single dose has been used safely and efﬁca-
ciously in pediatric patients with platelets
20  109/L
Dose frequency is dependent on duration of
response, clinical symptoms, and adverse
effects; may be given q2–4 weeks.
Notes:
Avoid in patients with known hypersensi-
tivity to immunoglobulins or thimerosal
and in patients with IgA deﬁciency. Use
with extreme caution in patients with a
hemoglobin less than 8 g/dL. Adverse events
Formulary
353

associated with administration in ITP in-
clude headache, chills, fever, and reduction
in hemoglobin (resulting from the destruc-
tion of RhD-positive red cells). May inter-
fere with immune response to live-virus
vaccines.
Causes
acute
hemolysis
with
an average hemoglobin decrease of 1.5 to
2 g/dL at 1 week. Do not use in patients with
active bleeding. Current FDA guidelines
strongly recommend that patients be mon-
itored in a health care center for 8 hours
after a dose of RhD immune globulin, with
urinalyses at baseline and 2, 4, and 8 hours
after administration due to risk of severe
hemolysis.
RITUXIMAB
Rituxan
Antineoplastic, monoclonal antibody
Injection: 10 mg/mL
Pregnancy category C
Indications:
Treatment of relapsed or refractory low
grade or follicular CD20 positive, B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma; ﬁrst-line therapy
for diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin lym-
phoma in combination with other che-
motherapeutics; systemic autoimmune dis-
orders including autoimmune hemolytic
anemia and immune thrombocytopenia
purpura; posttransplant lymphoprolifera-
tive disorder; rheumatoid arthritis; refrac-
tory graft-versus-host disease; refractory
systemic lupus erythematosis.
Dosage:
Refer to individual protocol.
Children and adults: 375 mg/m2 IV qweek
for 4 weeks (range 3 to 6 weeks)
Courses may be repeated for treatment of
malignancies or recurrent symptoms with
autoimmune disorders.
Notes:
Rare cases of progressive multifocal leu-
koencephalopathy due to Creutzfeldt–Ja-
kob virus have been reported. Infusional
toxicity is common and primarily avoided
with a slow infusion and premedication.
Most common, infusional toxicity is seen
with the ﬁrst infusion and reactions may
include development of hives, broncho-
spasm, hypoxia, hypotension, pulmonary
inﬁltrates, and respiratory distress syn-
drome. Some reactions have been fatal.
Close monitoring is required for all infu-
sions and appropriate resuscitative medi-
cations and equipment must be close by. In
the case of mild reactions, temporary ces-
sation of the infusion is indicated with
acetaminophen,
diphenhydramine,
and
ﬂuids as indicated. Hydrocortisone may
also be indicated. If symptoms resolve,
reinitiate the infusion at a 50% reduced
rate and monitor closely. Subsequent infu-
sions should run slowly and the patient
should be premedicated. Rituximab should
be discontinued altogether following a life-
threatening reaction. Use with caution in
patients with preexisting pulmonary or
cardiac conditions and in those at risk for
development of tumor lysis syndrome.
Causes immunosuppression. Quantitative
immunoglobulins and speciﬁc antibody
response should be checked prior to and
following treatment with rituximab to
determine if immunoglobulin infusions
might be needed post treatment until
recovery of immune function. Reactivation
of hepatitis B has been noted (mainly in
adult patients); thus, immune status to
hepatitis B virus should be documented.
Although speciﬁc to B-cells, Pneumocystis
jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) infection after
rituximab has been reported; therefore,
patients should receive PCP prophylaxis
for 6 months or until recovery of immune
function is documented.

blood dyscrasias. Discontinue with rash.
May need to be held temporarily in oncology
patients who are on TMP-SMX for PCP
prophylaxis and subsequently develop neu-
tropenia. Numerous drug interactions are
reported. TMP-SMX decreases the clearance
of warfarin and methotrexate, decreases
serum
cyclosporine
concentrations,
and
increases the effect of sulfonylureas, pheny-
toin, and thiopental. Do not give to patients
within 24 hours of receiving high-dose meth-
otrexate and until level is <1  107 M due

Injection: 2, 10 mg/mL
Pregnancy category C
Indications:
Prevention and treatment of hypopro-
thrombinemia caused by anticoagulants or
drug-induced vitamin K deﬁciency; hemor-
rhagic disease of the newborn.
Dosage:
Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn:
Prophylaxis: 0.5 to 1 mg IM within 1 hour of
birth
Treatment: 1 to 2 mg/24 hours IM, SC, or IV
Oral anticoagulant overdose:
Infants and children: 0.5 to 5 mg/dose PO,
IM, IV, or SC (give 5 mg for major bleeding,
0.5 to 2.5 mg for minor bleeding)
Adults: 2.5 to 10 mg/dose PO, IM, IV, or SC
Dose may be repeated 12 to 48 hours after
PO dose or 6 to 8 hours after parenteral dose
Vitamin K deﬁciency (due to drugs, malab-
sorption, or decreased synthesis of vitamin K
by the liver):
Infants and children: 2.5 to 5 mg/24 hours PO
or 1 to 2 mg/dose IM/IV/SC as a single dose
Adults: 2.5 to 5 mg/24 hours PO or 10 mg/
dose IM/SC/IV
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to phytonadione. Antagonizes
action of warfarin. Protect product from
light. Parenteral dosing may cause ﬂushing,
dizziness, cardiac or respiratory arrest,
hypotension, or anaphylaxis. High doses
(10 to 20 mg) in neonates may cause hyper-
bilirubinemia and severe hemolytic anemia.
Monitor prothrombin time (PT), activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT); blood
coagulation factors may increase within 6 to
12 hours after oral dosing and within 1 to 2
hours after parenteral dosing.
VORICONAZOLE
VFEND
Antifungal agent
Injection: 200 mg
Powder for suspension: 200 mg/5 mL
Tablet: 50, 200 mg
Pregnancy category D
Indications:
Treatment of invasive aspergillosis, espe-
cially in immunocompromised patients;
treatment of candidemia in nonneutropenic
patients; deep tissue Candida infections
including esophageal; treatment of serious
fungal infections caused by Scedosporium
apiospermum
or
Fusarium
species
in
patients intolerant or refractory to conven-
tional antifungal therapy.
Dosage:
Limited information on pediatric dosing;
children 12 years of age appear to require
higher dosing than adults.
Children 2 to 11 years: loading dose 6 mg/kg/
dose IV q12h for 2 doses on day 1 followed
by maintenance dose 4 mg/kg/dose IV q12h
362
Formulary

(approximates exposure of adult dose of
3 mg/kg/dose)
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
guidelines: invasive aspergillosis: mainte-
nance dose 5 to 7 mg/kg/dose IV q12h
Children 12 years and adults: loading dose
6 mg/kg/dose IV q12h for 2 doses on day 1;
followed by maintenance dose:
Invasive aspergillosis and other deep tissue
fungal infections: 4 mg/kg/dose IV q12h
Candidemia: 3 to 4 mg/kg/dose IV q12h
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to voriconazole. Use with cau-
tion in patients with known hypersensi-
tivity to azoles; cross-reactivity studies
have not been done. Tablets may contain
lactose and should be used with caution
in patients with lactose intolerance. Avoid
concurrent administration with rifampin,
CYP3A4 substrates, and ergot alkaloids.
Voriconazole
is
metabolized
by
cyto-
chrome P450 enzymes and many drug
interactions
exist.
May
cause
severe
hepatic toxicity, visual changes, cardiac
arrhythmias, auditory hallucinations, and
photosensitivity. May cause fetal harm;
must ensure contraception to avoid preg-
nancy. Use with caution in neonates; oral
suspension contains sodium benzoate, a
metabolite of benzyl alcohol, which may
cause a potentially fatal toxicity. Use with
caution in patients with renal or hepatic
toxicity;
dose
adjustment
may
be
necessary.
WARFARIN SODIUM
Coumadin, Jantoven, generic
Anticoagulant
Tablets: 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.5, 10 mg
Injection: 5 mg
Pregnancy category X
Indications:
Prophylaxis
and
treatment
of
venous
thromboembolic disorders; prevention of
arterial thromboembolism in patients with
prosthetic heart valves or atrial ﬁbrillation;
prevention of death, venous thromboembo-
lism, and recurrent myocardial infarction
(MI) after acute MI.
Dosage:
Infants and children (to maintain an inter-
national normalized ratio [INR] between
2 and 3):
Initial dose: 0.2 mg/kg PO for 1 to 2 days;
maximum dose 10 mg
Maintenance dose: 0.1 mg/kg/24 hours PO
daily; range 0.05 to 0.34 mg/kg/24 hours
(consult published charts based on INR)
Adults: 5 to 10 mg PO daily  2 to 5 days,
adjust for desired INR; maintenance dose
range 2 to 10 mg/day PO
Onset of action is within 36 to 72 hours and
peak effects occur within 5 to 7 days. Mon-
itor INR after 5 to 7 days of new dosage;
high risk patients may require more fre-
quent monitoring.
Usual duration of therapy for ﬁrst venous
thrombotic event is 3 months (depending
on elimination of procoagulant factor and
based on resolution of clot).
Notes:
Do not give to patients with known hyper-
sensitivity to warfarin, severe liver or kidney
disease, uncontrolled bleeding, gastrointes-
tinal (GI) ulcers, status-post neurosurgical
procedures, and malignant hypertension.
Concomitant use with vitamin K may
decrease anticoagulant effect. Concomitant
use with aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂam-
matory
drugs,
or
indomethacin
may
increase warfarin’s anticoagulant effect and
cause severe GI irritation. May cause fever,
Formulary
363

skin lesions, necrosis (especially in protein C
deﬁciency),
hemorrhage,
hemoptysis,
anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
Many drug interactions exist; review all
medications prior to initiation of therapy.
The INR is the recommended test to mon-
itor anticoagulant effect. The absolute INR
desired is dependent on the indication and
has been extrapolated from adults. An INR
of 2 to 3 has been recommended for pro-
phylaxis and treatment of deep vein throm-
bosis, pulmonary emboli, and bioprosthetic
heart valves. Younger children may require
higher dosing. Certain foods and medica-
tions may alter levels and should be
reviewed in detail with the patient. Antidote
is vitamin K and prothrombin complex con-
centrates (PCC; fresh frozen plasma if PCC
unavailable).
