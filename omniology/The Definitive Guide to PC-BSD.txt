Foreword 
PC-BSD first began back in early 2005 with a simple beta release, which only provided a basic graphical 
installer to get a system loaded with FreeBSD 6 and KDE 3. This release was simply to test out the 
functionality of our installer and to begin laying the groundwork for a new method of package 
management for the open source desktop. However, the biggest drive for creating PC-BSD actually 
began in the years prior to the first release, as I had begun to dabble in open source desktops on our 
family computers.  
Our first experience with open source on the desktop was very mixed. Naturally, not all hardware 
would work properly, and after some initial struggles we ended up with some fairly stable systems. 
However, as we began using the systems on a daily basis, we quickly ran into other problems in the area 
of package management that could not be easily solved. By design, the various open source systems 
would simply treat every software package as a part of the core desktop. Thus, when we wished to 
perform updates to a particular application, the software manager would determine which other 
packages on the system needed to be updated to complete the task. While this would usually work 
without a hitch, too often for our comfort something would end up getting changed or broken in a 
(seemingly) unrelated piece of software just from doing something simple such as trying to update a 
small desktop application. 
Because of this experience, I began delving into these problems and eventually came to the 
conclusion that the package managers themselves were not necessarily at fault, but rather the 
underlying designs were the cause of the trouble. I wanted instead to see a system in which applications 
were kept separate from the base operating system, and as a result have far fewer potential points of 
failure. I had been a fan of FreeBSD in the past, and appreciated their clear distinction between their 
base system and the tree of applications (ports). This got me thinking. Why can’t the same idea be 
implemented around a desktop version of BSD? Thus PC-BSD was born.  
At the beginning work was slow, but after the first few beta releases, we began to attract further 
developers who greatly expanded our efforts. The PBI format went through several evolutions in order to 
improve its “self-contained” nature and improve application stability. The latest revisions to the PBI format 
make it possible to offer more complex applications in a self-contained format, including complete 
window managers such as Gnome or XFCE, which was unthinkable at the creation of the standard.  
Now, five years later, PC-BSD has continued to mature and expand its desktop accessibility for 
novices and experts alike. The PBI tool-chain has grown and improved, as have the numbers of 
applications available in the format. New graphical configuration tools have been created to manage 
networking, firewall, users, services, system updating and more. More advanced applications have also 
been offered, such as a Jail Management suite and a Thin-Client Server module. The upcoming release 
of version 8.0 is the culmination of a lot of work by a small but committed team of developers, and ups 
the ante in desktop usability. We are looking forward to continuing work on PC-BSD by making it easier, 
faster, and more stable than ever, and hope you will come along for the ride.

About the Technical Reviewers 
■Sevan Janiyan is based in Brighton, Sussex, in England. He  looks after SMEs in the south east of 
England, consulting on Microsoft Windows Server, Microsoft Exchange, OS X Server, OpenBSD and 
FreeBSD at Venture 37 (www.venture37.com).  
Sevan holds the following certifications: MCSA, MCSE 2000 & 2003, ACSA 10.4, CCENT. He started 
with the BSDs back when FreeBSD 5.0 was released in January 2003 and has since branched out to 
OpenBSD and NetBSD, using the BSDs for much of the infrastructure. He contributes patches to 
Free/Open/NetBSD and he maintains several ports in the FreeBSD tree. 
In his spare time, Sevan likes to DJ and listen to comedy. He keeps a blog at www.geeklan.co.uk. 
■Søren “Xride” Straarup was born in 1978, and hamradio licensed in 1992. 
He has been using FreeBSD since 1998, and has used FreeBSD at work since 
2000, both as sysadmin and developer. Søren became a FreeBSD ports 
committer in 2006. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
■Alexander Erenkov was born in Pripyat, near Kiev (Ukraine). At an early 
age he was evacuated because of the Chernobyl disaster to the city of Kiev, 
where he resides to this day. He graduated in physics and mathematics 
from the Lyceum, going on to attend Kiev Polytechnic Institute, which he 
soon abandoned due to the inconsistency of the training material and 
modern technology at that time. In 2002 Alexander discovered the world of 
open source software, including FreeBSD, as both a user and administrator. 
He used his favorite programming language, Java, to develop web games 
focused on high throughput from 2005 to 2008. After that era ended, 
Alexander began to write and maintain the CRM system for a company that 
sells contextual advertising, devoting his free time to improving the PC-BSD 
operating system. In September 2009, with the help of foreign sponsors, he organized and conducted the 
first FreeBSD/PC-BSD conference in Kiev, Ukraine.  
In 2010, Alexander began providing consulting services on free software and related technologies, 
and is optimistic about the future.

Introduction 
For years, the BSD family of operating systems has been a popular choice for developers and system 
administrators. The BSDs provide well-engineered development processes, secure and stable operating 
systems, well-written documentation, and a license that allows users to freely modify the system to meet 
their needs. However, it was traditionally difficult for a casual computer user to get started using a BSD 
system due to an initially steep learning curve. What was needed was a desktop BSD that allowed users 
to start using the operating system immediately and still allowed them to “peek under the hood” as they 
wanted to increase their knowledge of how things work. 
The PC-BSD project was started in 2005 to address this need and has since matured into a stable, 
feature-rich, and easy-to-use operating system. Its userbase and popularity continue to grow among 
existing BSD users and users who are looking for alternatives to Windows, Mac, or Linux. Just as Ubuntu 
has revolutionized the Linux desktop, PC-BSD has revolutionized the BSD desktop. 
PC-BSD has been designed to appeal to everyone, from casual computer user to the most advanced 
computer hacker. Things “just work,” meaning you don’t have to know how things work just to get them 
to work. Things are also infinitely customizable, where the only limit is literally how much you are 
willing to learn. PC-BSD is also suited to users with special needs—it can be easily customized for users 
with disabilities or users who read languages other than English. 
PC-BSD also provides a vibrant community of end users, translators, writers, and developers. If 
joining an open source community interests you, you’ll enjoy the friendliness, enthusiasm, and 
helpfulness of other PC-BSD users. 
It is our hope that you enjoy the information in this book and learn all kinds of interesting things as 
you read through it. This book is meant to be “done” as much as “read,” and every page contains 
something you’ll want to try out on a system. So, grab a computer, the latest version of PC-BSD, and 
prepare to explore the PC-BSD operating system! 
What You’ll Find in This Book 
The Definitive Guide to PC-BSD is divided into five parts that move the reader from basic to advanced 
tasks. Novice users will benefit from reading the book from the beginning while more advanced users 
can start at the sections that catch their interest. If you come across a technical term you don’t 
understand and it is not explained in that section, it was introduced earlier on in the book. 
Part 1 is meant to get you started with PC-BSD. It provides an introduction to free and open source 
software, the BSD family of operating systems, and how PC-BSD fits into the picture. It then gets you 
started with PC-BSD by showing you how to run a live DVD or install PC-BSD into a virtual environment 
or directly onto your computer, either to run the DVD as a live operating system or to install PC-BSD on 
your system. 
Part 2 allows you to get comfortable with using PC-BSD. Its beginning chapters introduce you to the 
KDE4 desktop, showing you how to customize your desktop and to find the things you need. It also 
shows you how to perform common computing tasks using PC-BSD. Later chapters show you how to 
change and configure every aspect of your operating system. If you’re looking for a reference on “how do 
I?”, this is the section of the book to zero in on. 

■ INTRODUCTION 
xxii 
Part 3 teaches you how to find, install, and manage software on your PC-BSD system. The initial 
chapters introduce you to PC-BSD’s push button installer system that allows even brand-new users to 
safely manage their software. Later chapters introduce more advanced software management systems 
such as the FreeBSD packages system and the FreeBSD ports system. 
Part 4 introduces you to the PC-BSD community and the resources that are available when you need 
help using your PC-BSD system. Users new to the open source way of doing things can learn about 
netiquette and how to effectively use forums, wikis, IRC, and mailing lists. This section of the book 
initially shows you how to get help and its later chapters provide suggestions on how more advanced 
users can give back to the PC-BSD community. 
Part 5 is the most advanced section of the book. Its first chapter shows you how to perform 
advanced tasks such as creating customized installations, setting up a thin client network, and managing 
FreeBSD jails. The last chapter introduces you to the PC-BSD system and PBI development processes 
and shows how developers can assist the PC-BSD community.

Introducing PC-BSD 
Did you ever wish that you could just use your computer without becoming frustrated by the 
experience? How many times have you found yourself asking: why can’t I browse the Internet or use 
email without worrying about viruses? Why can’t I find software that doesn’t crash or freeze my 
computer? Why do I have to rely on a technical friend or family member to keep my system up-to-date? 
Why does software cost so much? Why do I have to become a computer expert just to use a computer?!! 
The good news is: you don’t have to become a computer expert just to use a computer. In fact, you 
don’t even have to spend money on computer software. You can browse the web, use email and social 
networks, create documents and presentations for work or school, play games, watch videos, and listen 
to music using high quality software at no cost.  
Sound too good to be true? The idea takes some getting used to, but by the end of this book you’ll 
wonder why you ever paid for software in the first place. This introductory chapter will very briefly 
describe the origins of free software and introduce you to the PC-BSD operating system. 
A Little History 
Computers and software have been around for over 60 years, so it can be useful to have some historical 
context on why things are the way they are. In the beginning, computers were huge, taking up entire 
floors worth of space, and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Computer manufacturers made their 
money selling hardware and computer users were expected to create their own software. It quickly 
became apparent to users that sharing the software they created with each other provided many 
benefits. It saved everyone from reinventing the same wheel and freed up their time to actually use the 
computer hardware they had invested so much money in. This software sharing evolved into 
associations of users that still exist to this day. Examples include SHARE, created by IBM users in 1955, 
and DECUS (now called the HP User Society), which was created by Digital Equipment users in 1961. In 
the beginning, software was created by users and didn’t cost any money, and sharing communities were 
created by and for people using the same software. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING PC-BSD 
 
4 
Things began to change in the 1970s as lower-cost personal computers were introduced and 
software began to be sold as a product.
1 Over time, users purchasing software became the norm and the 
members of software communities became limited to computer scientists and programmers. 
Free and Open Source Software 
In 1985, a computer scientist at MIT named Richard Stallman became frustrated that software he had 
created through academic research was being sold for profit by companies. In response, he wrote the 
GNU Manifesto
2 and launched the Free Software movement. According to Stallman, software is “free” 
not when it is obtained at no cost, but when it gives the user the following freedoms: 
Free software is a matter of the users’ freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change 
and improve the software. More precisely, it means that the program’s users have the 
four essential freedoms:  
• 
The freedom to run the program, for any purpose (freedom 0).  
• 
The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do 
what you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.  
• 
The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).  
• 
The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements (and 
modified versions in general) to the public, so that the whole community 
benefits (freedom 3). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.  
A program is free software if users have all of these freedoms. Thus, you should be free 
to redistribute copies, either with or without modifications, either gratis or charging a 
fee for distribution, to anyone anywhere. Being free to do these things means (among 
other things) that you do not have to ask or pay for permission.  
The Free Software Definition

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING PC-BSD 
 
5 
Whenever the term “free” is used in this book, it is referring to the above definition of free, not to the 
cost of the software. 
Free software does not include shareware that can only be used at no cost for a limited amount of 
time. Free software does not include demo software that only provides some features and nags you to 
buy the full product in order to access all of the features. Free software does not include spyware or 
trojans, which are meant to harm your computer.  
You are not engaging in software piracy if you download or use free software. Free software has 
already given you the freedom to use and share it with your friends without having to first pay a cost or 
ask for permission. Think of free software as a return to the original days of computers, when users 
shared their programs to help each other use their computers effectively. 
In 1998, a group of free software users decided to create a new term to describe free software. They 
felt a new term was needed so users wouldn’t confuse “freedom” with “no cost.” They coined the term 
“open source” and started the Open Source Initiative
4 to promote its use. While technical users may 
debate the nuances of each term, from a user perspective it is safe to assume that any software that calls 
itself “free/libre” or “open source” allows you to legally download, use, and share it at no cost. 
BSD Software 
Nearly a decade before Richard Stallman wrote his GNU Manifesto, computer scientists at the University 
of California at Berkeley were sharing the changes they were making to the Unix operating system with 
users at other universities. These changes were known as the Berkeley Software Distribution or BSD 
Unix.
5 The changes included a working implementation of TCP/IP, the software that computers still use 
today to access the Internet and files on other computers. 
BSD also pioneered the concept of creating and sharing software over a network. In this way, a 
community of software users could help each other out, even though they all lived in different parts of 
the world. When the users at Berkeley stopped contributing changes to BSD in the early 1990s, the global 
community of users took over and continued development of the operating system. 
One group of users decided to concentrate on making BSD work on many different types of 
computers (the technical term is porting to other computer architectures). They formed the NetBSD 
project in March 1993. NetBSD currently supports 57 architectures,
6 making it the most ported operating 
system in the world and earning it the motto “of course it runs NetBSD!” 
Another group of users decided to concentrate on personal computers and getting as many 
applications as possible to work with the operating system. They formed the FreeBSD project in 
November 1993. As of December 2009, FreeBSD supports over 21,000 applications, all of which are free 
to use. 
A group of NetBSD users decided to concentrate on operating system security and started the 
OpenBSD project in December 1994. OpenBSD includes a number of security features absent or 
optional in other operating systems, and its motto is “Only two remote holes in the default install, in  
a heck of a long time!”

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING PC-BSD 
 
6 
Despite their original focus goals, all of the BSD communities support multiple architectures, 
provide thousands of free applications, and have a reputation for being secure. The BSD communities 
also work closely with each other, and new features created by one project tend to find their way into the 
other projects over time. 
PC-BSD 
In 2005, a FreeBSD user started experimenting with some scripts to make installing and using FreeBSD 
easy for the casual computer user. His goal was to create a no-cost operating system that is so intuitive 
and easy to use, you shouldn’t have to constantly bug your technical friends in order to figure out how to 
do things. The result was PC-BSD, the focus of this book.  
PC-BSD is open source software, meaning that you have been given permission to install, use, and 
share it. PC-BSD has a vibrant community of other PC-BSD users with whom you can share your PC-
BSD experiences, tips, questions and answers. Experienced PC-BSD users can also share their programs 
and add-ons. This book will introduce you to that community and give you the confidence and tools 
you’ll need to help others as you move along the path from casual to experienced PC-BSD user. 
PC-BSD is still FreeBSD under the hood, meaning that existing FreeBSD users have access to all of 
the FreeBSD features they expect. As new versions of FreeBSD are released, so are versions of PC-BSD. 
This means that PC-BSD users benefit from all of FreeBSD’s features as they are introduced. 
Why PC-BSD Instead of FreeBSD?  
PC-BSD is based on FreeBSD, so a natural question arises: “Why use PC-BSD instead of FreeBSD?” 
FreeBSD is a popular open source operating system. It does have a reputation for being better suited 
to technical users than to casual computer users. For example, after installing FreeBSD, the user is left 
with a command prompt and is expected to know how to configure the graphical environment, 
networking and sound, and how to install additional applications. While these tasks are very well 
documented and easy to do (once you know what you’re doing), it does assume that you either know 
what you are doing or have the time to learn. While the learning experience can be very satisfying, it can 
also be frustrating to new users or users who need their computer to “just work” right now. 
No Previous Knowledge Required 
PC-BSD doesn’t require any previous knowledge since the operating system is pre-configured for you. It 
provides an easy-to-navigate desktop, a browser that is connected to the Internet, working sound, 
dozens of installed applications, and an easy way to browse for and install additional software. The first 
time you boot into PC-BSD, you can just start using it. 
Stability and Security 
FreeBSD has a reputation for being a very stable and secure operating system. PC-BSD builds on this 
base by adding several features that make it easy for you to keep your system secure. The installation 
pre-configures the built-in firewall to allow access to the Internet but to prevent other systems from 
damaging your computer. A firewall utility is included should you wish to adjust your firewall settings.  

CHAPTER 1 ■ INTRODUCING PC-BSD 
 
7 
PC-BSD includes a utility that automatically checks for security updates and newer versions of 
software. This application will pop-up when an update is available, describe the update, and provide a 
button for you to install the update. 
Viruses on BSD systems are extremely rare (I have been using BSD daily for over ten years without 
running antivirus software and have never been infected by a virus). PC-BSD does support easy-to-
install antivirus software should you wish to use it. 
Friendly and Helpful Community 
It may seem strange to include community as a feature of an operating system, but once you learn how 
to tap into a community’s resources you’ll realize why community is so important. No operating system 
is perfect. Sometimes an “intuitive” feature doesn’t make sense to you and sometimes things don’t work 
like they should. What do you do if your technical friends aren’t available or don’t know the answer? 
Access to other PC-BSD users from around the world is a valuable resource. Someone else will have 
experienced the same problem and can tell you what they did to fix it. And if the problem turns out to be 
a bug in the software, others in the community can fix the software so it doesn’t happen again. The 
community is also a great place to learn about applications you haven’t tried before and to hang out with 
other PC-BSD users—this can be especially helpful if none of your friends has tried PC-BSD yet. 
The PC-BSD community has a reputation for being friendly and helpful. We’ll offer tips in this book 
on how to introduce yourself to the community and access its resources. 
Best of Both Worlds 
PC-BSD isn’t just for the casual computer user; it is also well suited to existing FreeBSD users. I started 
using PC-BSD after nearly a decade of using FreeBSD as my desktop. I already knew how to configure a 
FreeBSD desktop, but wanted to try PC-BSD’s pre-configured install. I stayed with PC-BSD because I 
liked its additional features. 
For users already familiar with FreeBSD, PC-BSD provides the best of both worlds: a pre-configured 
desktop and FreeBSD. You can still install software using the FreeBSD ports and packages collections,
7 
8 
9 
and you can try PC-BSD’s software installer. You can still keep your software up-to-date using traditional 
tools, and you can try PC-BSD’s update utility. You can still manually configure networking and the 
firewall, and you can try PC-BSD’s graphical utilities. Heck, you can change the desktop and still access 
the PC-BSD graphical utilities through the command line. If you’re a curious power-user like myself, you 
can even turn your PC-BSD installation into a FrankenBSD as you discover all kinds of novel ways to 
integrate FreeBSD with PC-BSD’s features. This book will cover all of these user possibilities, allowing 
the reader to decide whether to use PC-BSD as-is or delve into further experimentation.

Why Not Linux? 
If you’re familiar with free software, you have probably heard of or used Linux before. You may even be 
wondering if PC-BSD is a Linux distro (it is not). PC-BSD aims to allow any user to use FreeBSD on his or 
her computer, much like Ubuntu
10 aims to allow any user to use Linux on his or her computer. Both are 
examples of easy-to-use open source operating systems. 
The answer to the question “why use PC-BSD over a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu?” depends 
upon whom you ask. Some PC-BSD users experience fewer problems using PC-BSD’s software installer 
and update utilities. Some find PC-BSD to be better documented or find the PC-BSD community to be 
more helpful. Some like the PC-BSD desktop better than the Ubuntu desktop. Some like that it is based 
on FreeBSD. So, really, it depends upon whom you ask. 
The real answer may be to try both and to experience each operating system for yourself. Both will 
allow you to use your computer effectively, at no cost. If you’ve used Ubuntu before, keep an open mind 
as you go through this book. PC-BSD will accomplish the same tasks as Ubuntu, but it will do some 
things differently. We’re confident that by the end of this book, you will be among the growing number 
of happy PC-BSD users. 
Summary 
This chapter has introduced you to the concept of free software and the importance of community. It 
has briefly described PC-BSD and the benefits it can provide to the casual computer user as well as more 
experienced FreeBSD and Linux users. 
In the next chapter we will dive right in and demonstrate how to install PC-BSD onto your 
computer.

Installing PC-BSD 
PC-BSD was designed to be easy to install. Even if you’ve never installed an operating system before, the 
default settings provided by the installer will allow for a quick and successful PC-BSD installation. If you 
have a spare computer and a PC-BSD DVD, you can install and start using PC-BSD in under 30 minutes. 
This chapter is designed for both novice and advanced users. If you don’t know what you’re  
doing and are afraid of losing the data on your computer, start with the section “Using the Live DVD” 
later in this chapter. This will enable you to try out PC-BSD without destroying the data on your 
computer. You can then read through the rest of the chapter as you become more comfortable with the 
idea of performing an installation that will replace the current operating system on your computer with 
PC-BSD.  
This chapter discusses all of the possibilities that can occur during an installation. By understanding 
what each setting does, you can decide whether you want to change it or accept the default setting. I will 
let you know if a setting is meant for advanced users or requires additional understanding of how 
computers work. 
This chapter also discusses settings of interest to advanced users who would like to perform an 
installation that doesn’t overwrite the existing operating system. I will show you how to create free space 
for the PC-BSD installation and how to configure a boot manager so multiple operating systems can 
exist on one computer.  
What’s New in PC-BSD 8 
This book was written to PC-BSD version 8.0, which was released in February 2010. Some of the notable 
features of this release include the following: 
New system installer: The system installer was completely rewritten. It now 
enables users to test their keyboard layout and to install FreeBSD or PC-BSD, 
and provides a summary of the installation settings. The back end of the 
installer is scriptable, allowing advanced users to fully customize their 
installations. 
Software Manager: This now includes a software browser, enabling users to 
easily find and install software in the same utility that is used to remove and 
update installed software. 
Life Preserver: PC-BSD now includes an easy-to-use backup utility. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
10 
Nvidia for AMD64: Nvidia GeForce
1 video cards are now fully supported on 
both the 32- and 64-bit versions of PC-BSD. 
Adobe Flash Player 10: As of this writing, 10 is the latest version of Flash, 
meaning you can view any flash content in PC-BSD. 
KDE 4.3.4: As of this writing, this is the latest version of KDE. Chapter 3 
introduces you to the KDE desktop. 
New USB system: The entire USB system was rewritten for FreeBSD 8,
2 making 
it easier to work with USB devices. 
Filesystem support: PC-BSD now supports encrypted filesystems and the ZFS 
filesystem. See the “Disk Setup” section in this chapter for more information 
about selecting a filesystem during installation. 
System Requirements 
To install PC-BSD, you must first determine whether the hardware on your computer meets the 
minimum requirements. If your computer is fairly new (less than 5 years old), it should be fine. If your 
computer is older, double-check that it meets the minimum requirements. I’ll first list the requirements 
and then show you how to find out what hardware is installed on your computer. 
Minimum for PC-BSD Installation 
At a bare minimum, your computer needs to meet the following hardware requirements: 
CPU: Pentium 2 (introduced in 1997) 
Disk space: 10GB of free space 
Memory: 256MB of RAM 
Minimum for FreeBSD Installation 
The FreeBSD installation is meant for advanced users. Existing FreeBSD users should be aware that the 
PC-BSD installer does not allow you to select which FreeBSD distributions to install—for example, User, 
Developer, or Minimal. The minimum requirements listed next are based on the requirements of the 
installer. If you’re looking for a FreeBSD minimal installation on a low-end computer, you should install 
from FreeBSD media instead of the PC-BSD installer. 
Available disk space: 4GB of free space 
Memory: 256MB of RAM

Recommended 
Although the minimum requirements will allow you to install PC-BSD, you can never have too much 
CPU, disk space, or RAM. In fact, the more you have, the better your computing experience. The PC-BSD 
project recommends the following minimum hardware in order to get the most out of PC-BSD: 
CPU: Pentium 4 or higher (introduced in 2000) 
Available disk space: 30GB of free space 
Memory: 512MB of RAM 
Video: Some advanced features such as desktop effects and 3D games require a 
3D video card. PC-BSD supports 3D acceleration on most Nvidia cards and 
some Intel integrated cards. 
Determining Hardware Settings 
There are many utilities available for determining what hardware is installed on a computer. I will 
demonstrate how to use Parted Magic because this open source program can also be used to create free 
space on your computer. How to create free space is discussed in the “Creating Partitions” section at the 
end of this chapter. 
Instructions for downloading and burning Parted Magic to a CD are available from http:// 
partedmagic.com/download.html. After you have the CD, insert it into your CD drive, boot the computer, 
and press the spacebar when you see the menu shown in Figure 2-1. 
 
 
Figure 2-1. Main menu for the Parted Magic CD 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
12 
■ Tip If you don’t see this menu, your computer is not set to boot from its CD drive. You will need to access your 
BIOS
3 and change the boot order
4 so your computer boots from CD first. 
To determine the hardware on your system, press the spacebar when you see the Parted Magic 
menu to stop it from loading. Use your up arrow to highlight the Extras menu and press Enter. Press 
Enter again to start the Hardware Detection Tool (HDT). 
■ Tip Parted Magic also provides a graphical interface to show you your hardware, but that tool may not give you 
all of the information you’ll need about your video card. 
You can now use your up and down arrow keys to highlight entries, and your left and right  
arrow keys to move between menus. Use the right arrow key to expand a menu and the left arrow key  
to go back. 
You should write down the following information: 
Disks ➤ Disk 1: Make note of the size of the disk. If you are planning on 
installing PC-BSD without losing the current operating system(s) on the 
computer, carefully record the Size and Type for each partition. 
Memory ➤ Bank 0: Note the Size. Repeat for each of the listed Banks (the 
number of banks will depend on your hardware). Adding up all of the listed 
sizes will show the total amount of RAM on the computer. 
Processor: If the FSB setting is higher than 66, your CPU meets the minimum 
installation requirements. Also check the X86_64 setting. If it is set to No, you 
must install the 32-bit version of PC-BSD. If it is set to Yes, you must install the 
64-bit version of PC-BSD. 
VESA ➤ VESA Bios: The Vendor and Product will be needed when you select 
your optimal video settings, as seen in the “Post Installation” section at the end 
of this chapter.  
When finished, arrow down to Reboot and remove the CD.

Obtaining PC-BSD 
If you don't have a copy of PC-BSD, you can download and burn your own DVD for free or you can 
purchase a DVD at a nominal cost. This section will demonstrate the available methods for obtaining 
PC-BSD. If you already have a PC-BSD DVD, you can skip ahead to the next section. 
Downloading and Burning a .iso File  
If you want to download and burn your own DVD, the PC-BSD web site (http://www.pcbsd.org) contains 
everything you need to get started. The main page of the web site always indicates which version is the 
“Current Release”, and that is the one that you want to download. Occasionally, the front page will also 
describe a future release that is in its testing phase (we will show you how to participate in testing  
releases in Chapter 12). Unless you are helping the community test a release, you don't want to 
download a testing release; you can spot these as the version name will include the word “beta” or “RC”, 
which stands for release candidate. It will also have a different version number than the one indicated by 
“Current Release”. As of this writing, the current release of PC-BSD is 8.0—the number after the 8 may be 
higher when you go to download the current release. 
To download PC-BSD, click on the Download link at the top of the pcbsd.org web site. You will see 
information similar to that seen in Figure 2-2.

Notice that there are several hyperlinks to choose from. Before downloading anything, determine if 
your computer is 32 or 64 bit, as described in the previous section on “Determining Hardware Settings”. 
You can then choose which file(s) to download. 
If you have a fast Internet connection, download the DVD version that matches your hardware (32 
or 64 bit). The DVD version contains everything you need, but it is a large download—about 4GB. If you 
have a slow Internet connection or a limit on how much you can download, consider downloading the 
CD files instead. These files are a smaller download (about 700MB each), but you will need to download 
both CD #1 and CD #2 to complete the installation, plus CD #3 if you want to install additional software 
during the installation. Advanced users also have the option to download USB and boot-only images. 
■ Note This book will refer to the “PC-BSD DVD”. If you are using CDs instead, you can use them to do everything  
in this chapter except the section on “Using the Live DVD” as the CD version does not contain the live version of 
PC-BSD. 
If you click a hyperlink to start a download, it will indicate the name of the file that will be 
downloaded, its size, and the MD5 sum of the file. The filename will end in .iso, indicating that it is an 
image that is meant to be burned to a CD or DVD media. This means that the CD/DVD drive in your 
computer needs to be writable—it will be marked as CD-RW or DVD-RW, where the W means that it is 
capable of writing. You will also need an application that is designed to write .iso files to media. If you 
have never burned a CD or DVD before, click on the “quick guide” link seen in Figure 2-2 and read the 
section on “Burning the installation CD-ROM/DVD” first. It contains step-by-step instructions for 
burning on Windows, Linux/BSD (Unix), and Mac OSX. 
■ Tip If this seems too complicated, click on the Store link to purchase a DVD, or get a friend to help you burn 
your own. 
If you decide to download a file, click the arrow next to its Download button. This will allow you to 
choose a download site—pick the one that is closest to your geographic region. Once the download is 
finished, you should check that the MD5 sum on the file you downloaded is the same as the MD5 sum 
next to the download link. This will ensure that the file you downloaded is correct. The section entitled 
“Data Integrity Check” in the user guide shows you how to do this for Windows and Linux/BSD. Mac 
OSX users can use the following command at a command prompt: 
 
openssl md5 name_of.iso 
 
Replace “name_of.iso” with the name of the file that you downloaded.  
In the rare event that the md5 is not the same value, this indicates that there was a problem with the 
download. You will need to download the file again, preferably from a different mirror. If you are an 
advanced user, you should email the PC-BSD testing mailing list (described in Chapter 11) so the 
developers can check to see if there is a problem with the file on the download mirror. 
Once you have verified the file's checksum, you can burn the DVD or CD using your favorite burning 
application or the instructions in the user guide. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD

■ Tip The PC-BSD project also gives away thousands of DVDs each year at free software conferences. The main 
page of the pcbsd.org web site lists the location of these conferences in the Upcoming Events section. If a 
conference is near you, drop by the PC-BSD booth to pick up a DVD and talk with people from the PC-BSD project. 
Purchasing PC-BSD 
While PC-BSD is freely available, it does require a bit of work on your part to download and burn a  
PC-BSD .iso file. If you don't want to be bothered with burning your own DVD, have limited Internet 
connectivity, or want to show your support for PC-BSD, consider purchasing a copy. 
If you click the Store link on the pcbsd.org web site, you will see options to Purchase Retail CD 
Package or Other Items. Both options are discussed below. 
Retail CD Package: This option will take you to the PC-BSD page at FreeBSD 
Mall (http://www.freebsdmall.com) where you can purchase the latest DVD of 
PC-BSD, a subscription which will automatically send you a DVD whenever a 
new version of PC-BSD is released, a copy of this book containing the latest 
DVD, or a copy of this book containing the latest DVD in a deluxe boxed set. 
Other Items: This option will take you to the PC-BSD page at Cafepress.com 
where you can purchase items such as t-shirts, stickers, hats, mugs, and 
mousepads. 
Using the Live DVD 
A live DVD
5 enables you to take an operating system for a “test drive” to see whether you like it before 
committing to an installation of the operating system on your computer. It is also an excellent way to 
check whether the operating system understands all of your computer hardware. If it works on the live 
DVD, it will also work when you install the operating system. 
To use the PC-BSD live DVD, insert your PC-BSD DVD into your computer's DVD tray and boot your 
system. When you see the Welcome to PC-BSD menu shown in Figure 2-3, press your spacebar to pause 
the menu. You can then press the number 3 key to boot PC-BSD in Live mode.

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
16 
 
Figure 2-3. PC-BSD boot menu 
You will see a series of text messages on your screen as PC-BSD boots.  
That’s it! After the computer finishes booting, you can use the live environment and skip ahead to 
Chapter 3 to learn more about getting comfortable with using PC-BSD. 
Here are some things to be aware of when using the live DVD: 
• 
Bootup is slower because everything needs to be copied from the DVD to the live 
filesystem.  
• 
Everything mentioned in this book should work from the live DVD. However, any 
changes you make are copied to the live filesystem and will disappear when you 
reboot.  
• 
If you create any files, save them to a USB drive or floppy before rebooting. 
Otherwise, they will disappear.  
• 
The live filesystem is small (about 30MB), so you will need to download or create 
large files on a USB drive. 
• 
If your computer does not have much RAM, you will find the live DVD slower than 
the installed version of PC-BSD. 
• 
Remember: A live DVD is a tool to try out an operating system. If you want to use 
the operating system on a regular basis, you should install it instead. 
Using a Virtual Environment 
A virtual environment allows you to perform an installation into a “virtual” computer. From a practical 
point of view, this means that you can install and use PC-BSD within a window on your existing 
operating system. This installation is virtual because it does not overwrite any of the data on your 
computer and you can continue to use your existing operating system as usual. However, the installation 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
17 
is real in that it allows you to fully use the operating system that was installed into that window, just as if 
it were the only operating system on your computer. 
To perform this bit of magic, you need to first install a virtual computing application. We 
recommend the VirtualBox application because it is free, easy to use, and available for Windows, Mac OS 
X, Linux, and BSD. You can download the Windows, Mac, and Linux versions of VirtualBox from 
www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads. Existing FreeBSD users can install the VirtualBox package or port. 
Existing PC-BSD users can install the VirtualBox PBI by using Software Manager. 
■ Tip In this book, you will learn how to install packages, ports, and PBIs. For now, install the version of 
VirtualBox for your existing operating system. 
After the VirtualBox program has been installed and started, you will need to create a virtual 
machine. This machine contains the settings for the window where you will install PC-BSD. Figure 2-4 
shows the initial VirtualBox screen. 
 
 
Figure 2-4 The Welcome to VirtualBox screen, before creating any virtual machines 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
18 
Click the New icon to start the New Virtual Machine Wizard. Your machine will need the following 
settings to successfully install PC-BSD into it: 
Name: Choose a name that makes sense to you. 
OS Type: Select BSD from the drop-down Operating System menu and keep 
FreeBSD as the version. 
Base Memory Size: Change this number to 256. 
Virtual Hard Disk: Keep the default settings of the boot hard disk and create a 
new hard disk. 
Storage Type: Keep the default of Dynamically Expanding Storage. 
Location: Give the folder a name that makes sense to you and double-check 
that its location is in an area with enough disk space to hold the size of the 
virtual machine. 
Size: This needs to be changed to at least 10GB. 
After you are finished, your new virtual machine will appear, as seen in Figure 2-5. 
 
 
Figure 2-5. Settings for the virtual machine named pcbsd 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
19 
Before installing PC-BSD, there is one more setting that you need to configure. Click the Settings 
icon and highlight the CD/DVD-ROM setting, as seen in Figure 2-6. 
 
 
Figure 2-6. Choosing the installation media for a virtual machine 
Select the Mount CD/DVD Drive check box, which should select the make and model of your drive. 
If you have multiple DVD drives or you have plugged in an external USB DVD drive, use the drop-down 
menu to select the DVD drive you wish to install from. 
If you have downloaded  PC-BSD, you can mount the .iso file directly without having to first burn it 
to a DVD. Select the ISO Image File radio button and use the Browse Folders icon to browse to the 
location where you saved the ISO. When you are finished, click OK to save your changes. 
You are now ready to install PC-BSD into your virtual machine. If you are installing from a DVD, 
insert the DVD disk into the drive you specified earlier. Click the Start button, which will start the virtual 
machine in its own window, as seen in Figure 2-7 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
20 
 
Figure 2-7. Installing PC-BSD within a virtual machine by using VirtualBox 
You can then perform the installation as described in the next section. 
■ Tip Don’t worry, installing into a virtual machine will not affect your current operating system. The installation 
only “exists” within the window of the virtual machine. 
There are a few things you need to be aware of when using PC-BSD in a virtual environment: 
• 
You need to press the Ctrl key on the right side of your keyboard to switch back 
and forth between the virtual machine and the applications running on your 
operating system. For example, if you try to click your mouse or type something 
and nothing happens, press your right Ctrl key to activate your mouse/keyboard 
in that area. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
21 
• 
A virtual environment uses a lot of memory. If your computer does not have much 
RAM, you will need to be patient because everything will be slower. Closing 
unused programs may speed things up for you a bit. 
• 
After you’ve installed an operating system into the machine, you will need to tell 
your virtual machine that you want to boot the operating system, not install it all 
over again. Highlight the virtual machine entry and click Settings ➤ System to 
access the menu seen in Figure 2-8. Highlight the Hard Disk entry in the Boot 
Order section and use the up arrow to move it to the top of the list. 
 
 
Figure 2-8. Selecting which virtual machine device to boot from 
Once installed, PC-BSD can be used as if it were installed on the computer, because the virtual 
machine will save all of your changes. If you plan to download large files, make sure the size of your 
virtual machine is large enough to hold those files. PC-BSD will boot whenever you start the virtual 
machine and will shut down whenever you close the virtual machine. 
Installation  
If you have a spare computer, the best way to use PC-BSD is to install it onto the computer. It will be 
much faster than using the live DVD or a virtual environment. If you don’t care about what is on the 
computer now, you can just install PC-BSD and it will erase everything on the computer so it can use all 
the disk space that came with the computer. 
However, if you need to keep the operating system that is currently on the computer, things get 
more complicated. One solution to make things less complicated is to install PC-BSD onto an external 
USB drive. If the USB drive is plugged in when you run the Parted Magic CD, it will tell you the size of the 
drive. Be sure to select the correct drive from the drop-down menu when you reach the “Disk Setup” 
section of the installation. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
22 
The most complicated way is to install PC-BSD onto the same hard drive as your current operating 
system. If you plan to do this, carefully read the “Advanced Installation” section of this chapter before 
starting the installation, and triple-check that you are installing into the correct partition in the “Disk 
Setup” portion of the installation. 
■ Caution It is important to realize that the default installation assumes that you want to overwrite everything  
on your computer, or that you have an existing partition that contains no data. If you want to keep your existing 
operating system, carefully read the “Advanced Installation” section at the end of this chapter before starting  
the install. 
To start the PC-BSD installation, insert your PC-BSD DVD. This time, don’t press anything when you 
see the Welcome to PC-BSD menu (Figure 2-2), because the default option is to start the installer. If you 
wish to save some time, watch the text messages after the menu and type n when the installer asks 
whether you want to check the integrity of the installer archive. The installer will automatically detect 
your video card and mouse/pointer device. After the installer is loaded, you will see the Welcome & 
Language Selection screen seen in Figure 2-9. 
 
 
Figure 2-9. PC-BSD installer Welcome & Language Selection screen 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
23 
The drop-down Language Selection menu enables you to select your language. 
Each menu in the installer provides three options: Abort (stop the installation and reboot the 
computer), Back (return to the previous screen), and Next (move on to the next screen). When finished 
with this screen, click Next to continue. 
Keyboard Setup 
The next installation screen, seen in Figure 2-10, enables you to select your keyboard model, layout, and 
variant. If you are unsure, just leave the settings as is, because the default settings will work. If you know 
that you want to customize these settings, deselect the Use Default check box. If you have a nonstandard 
keyboard, you can then select your keyboard from the Keyboard Model drop-down menu. If your 
keyboard contains non-English characters, highlight your language in the Preferred Layout menu. If you 
have a Dvorak keyboard, highlight your variant in the Preferred Variant menu. If you modify any of these 
settings, you can test that your settings are correct by typing into the test settings box. If you decide you 
want to go back to the default settings, select the Use Default check box. 
 
 
Figure 2-10. PC-BSD Keyboard Setup screen 
Installation Type 
The next screen, seen in Figure 2-11, enables you to choose what type of installation to perform. In this 
example, the user has selected Network/Internet as the Installation Source. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
24 
 
Figure 2-11. Select Installation Type screen 
To install PC-BSD, you can just accept the default installation type settings and click Next. Here are 
all the possible options: 
Install: This option will format (erase all data) on the disk partition specified in 
the next menu. 
Upgrade: Select this option when a newer version of PC-BSD becomes 
available. Chapter 13 shows you how to upgrade your existing PC-BSD system 
to a newer version. 
Restore: Advanced users can select this option to repair a PC-BSD system by 
returning it to its original settings. This option does not keep your data, 
meaning you have to back it up first. See Chapter 13 for instructions on how to 
restore your system. 
PC-BSD: This option installs PC-BSD. 
FreeBSD: This option can be used by advanced users to install the FreeBSD 
operating system. This installation does not install the X window system, 
meaning there is no graphical user interface. This option assumes that you 
already know (or are willing to learn) how to configure a FreeBSD system. 
DVD/USB: This option uses the inserted DVD to install PC-BSD. 
Network/Internet: This enables advanced users to install over an Ethernet 
network card, as described in the next paragraph. Note that it is quicker to 
install from the DVD. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
25 
If your computer is attached to the Internet via an Ethernet network card, you can install the system 
from a server on the Internet or from a specified server (for example, a server at work or school that has 
been set up for this purpose). If your Internet provider provides your computer with a network address 
automatically (most do), keep the default setting of AUTO-DHCP and click Next. The installer will 
attempt to connect to the Internet and, if successful, will fill in the Select Installation Source screen, seen 
in Figure 2-12, for you. 
 
 
Figure 2-12. The installer has successfully connected to the Internet and selected an installation server. 
The default selection will work. However, if you are connecting to a custom installation server (for 
example, at work), select the Install from Specified Server radio button and enter the settings provided 
by your system administrator. 
Disk Setup 
This screen is meant for advanced users to customize their disk partition layout. If you don’t consider 
yourself to be an advanced user, you should either leave this screen as is, perform the installation on a 
test computer or virtual environment, or get an advanced user to double-check your changes. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
26 
■ Caution The installer assumes that you want to install PC-BSD on your computer and to erase its current 
contents. If this is not your intent, you should do one of the following instead: use the live DVD until you are ready 
to install, find an extra computer to install on, or carefully create and choose a free partition on your hard drive to 
install into. If you decide to go ahead with the installation, make sure you first back up the data on your computer 
that you consider important.  
I recommend that the first time you install PC-BSD (or any other operating system, for that matter), 
you use a computer on which you don’t want to keep any of the existing data. If you become an 
advanced user and want to try out new things, you can try more-complex configurations where you 
dual-boot, meaning the computer has more than one operating system installed. 
Figure 2-13 shows a screenshot of the Disk Setup screen. 
 
 
Figure 2-13. Disk Setup screen 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
27 
The easiest disk layout assumes that you want PC-BSD to take up your computer’s entire hard drive. 
Simply select the Use Entire Disk check box, and the installer will set up everything for you (auto-
partition). Remember, this will remove all data that is currently on that hard drive. 
■ Tip If you forget to select the Use Entire Disk box, you will see this error when you click Next: “The install 
requires a disk/slice with at least 10000MB of disk space.” 
If you are installing PC-BSD onto an external USB drive, select it from the drop-down menu at the 
top of the screen. After a drive is selected, any existing partitions will show in the box under the Use 
Entire Disk check box. Advanced users can select which partition to install into. If you want to keep an 
operating system on one of the partitions, it is important that you select the correct partition to erase 
and install PC-BSD into. Use the partition information you recorded in the “Determining Hardware 
Settings” section to check that you have selected the correct partition. 
■ Caution If you want to install into a specific partition, do not select the Use Entire Disk check box! Instead, 
highlight the desired partition and click Next. 
Advanced users can customize their disk layout by selecting the Customize Disk Setup (Advanced) 
radio button. This will change the screen to the one seen in Figure 2-14. In this screenshot, the user has 
clicked the + button to add a new partition, which is known as a slice. 
■ Tip If you don’t know what a disk partition is, you should stick with the default of Auto Partition. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
28 
 
Figure 2-14. Creating a slice in the customized Disk Setup screen 
When adding a slice (disk partition), you can customize the following: 
Disk/Slice: The names of the entries that appear in this menu depend on 
whether the disk has any existing partitions. If you select the name that does 
not include the letter s followed by a number (ad0 in this example), you are 
configuring the entire disk. If you select a name that includes the letter s 
followed by a number, you are configuring an existing partition. The installer 
will show you the size of the partition and the type of filesystem (for example, 
NTFS, Linux, FreeBSD), which should give you a hint about what is already 
installed on that partition.  
Type: PC-BSD is able to install several types of filesystems. Table 2-1 provides a 
description of each filesystem type available in the Type drop-down menu. If 
you’re not familiar with filesystems, the default value of UFS is fine. 
Mount Point: This indicates the names of the filesystems. Table 2-2 shows the 
most commonly used mount points. 
Size: The size will depend on your needs and the amount of disk space you 
have to work with. Table 2-2 provides some suggestions to get you started. 
Enable Encryption: PC-BSD uses geli
6 to provide encryption on any filesystem 
and mount point, including SWAP, ZFS, and /.

Table 2-1. Filesystem Types Supported by the PC-BSD Installer 
Filesystem Type

UFS 
The Unix File System, which is the default used by PC-BSD.

UFS+J 
Adds journaling.

ZFS 
Filesystem developed by Sun Microsystems that adds a lot of features.
9 
SWAP 
Used on only swap
10 partitions. You need to create one swap partition that is at least 
two times the size of the computer’s RAM.  
 
Table 2-2. Typical Mount Points and Their Sizes 
Mount Point 
Description 
/ 
This mount point, pronounced root, is mandatory as it holds the administrator’s home 
directory as well as the operating system. It should be at least 1024MB (or 1GB). Because 
it can be the only mount point, it can be as large as the entire disk or partition (minus 
space for the swap partition). Most advanced users allocate 1GB to a few GBs for root 
and divide up the disk/partition with other mount points. This enables them to separate 
their data and to make backups and system restores easier. 
/usr 
This is typically where the user home directories and user data are stored and will 
typically take up most of the disk/partition. Some advanced users like to make multiple 
/usr mount points (for example, /usr1, /usr2) to logically divide their data (for example, 
music, video, other data).  
/var 
This is typically where variable data (data that changes often) is stored. Examples 
include log files, print jobs, and unread e-mail. The size of the partition will be larger if 
the system is a logging, print, or mail server. Otherwise, a few GBs is usually sufficient. 
SWAP 
This will be set up for you if you select the SWAP filesystem.

Figure 2-15 shows an example created by clicking the Auto Setup button. By default, the installer 
will create 2GB for /, 1GB for /var, RAM times 2 for SWAP, and the rest of the available space to /usr. The 
same sizes are used if you click the Auto Partition button. 
 
 
Figure 2-15. Default partition sizes created by the installer if you select Auto Setup or Auto Partition 
The final option on this screen is the Install PC-BSD Bootloader check box. Whether you select this 
check box depends on whether PC-BSD will be the only operating system on the computer:  
• 
If PC-BSD will be the only operating system on the computer, leave this check box 
deselected.  
• 
If you will be dual-booting PC-BSD with another operating system, you must 
select this check box so the boot code will be written to disk—this will be needed, 
even if you decide to use another boot manager. 
• 
If you plan to add another operating system later, select this option so the PC-BSD 
boot code is written to disk. 
See the “Booting Multiple Operating Systems” section at the end of this chapter to learn how to 
successfully boot all of your installed operating systems. 
 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
31 
User Creation 
The next screen, seen in Figure 2-16, is used to set the administrative password, set up the primary user 
account, and create any additional user accounts for the system. 
 
 
Figure 2-16. User Creation screen 
The administrator password is also known as the root password or the superuser password. You will 
need to use this password whenever you make a change to the operating system. Throughout this book, I 
will let you know whenever a task requires this password. This screen asks you to input the password 
twice and will tell you if the passwords do not match. It will also force you to create the root password, 
meaning that this text box can’t be left empty. 
The Add User section is for the user who uses the computer most often (probably you). You will 
need to remember the username and password; again, the installer will ask you to type the password in 
twice and will tell you if the values do not match. Advanced users can select their favorite shell from the 
drop-down menu. If you don’t have a favorite shell or don’t know what a shell is, the default value is fine. 
After you have input the user values, click the +Add button to create the user. If the +Add button doesn’t 
work, you have forgotten to fill in one of the fields in the Add User section. 
You can create as many user accounts as you need and should create a separate account for every 
user who will use the computer. If you create multiple accounts, the user who uses the computer most 
often should be created first so that user is first in the list. If you mess up an account, simply highlight it 
in the list, click – Remove, and try again. 
The Auto-Login User check box indicates whether the first user in the list has to type in their 
password when the computer boots up. The default setting allows that user to be logged in 
automatically. This is convenient if you are the only user on the computer and you are not worried  

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
32 
about anyone else starting your computer and seeing your stuff. If you do not like this default, deselect 
this check box so that every time the computer boots up, it will present a login screen that will require 
you to type in your username and password. 
■ Tip The “Login Manager” section in Chapter 7 shows you how to change the auto-login feature if you change 
your mind after the system is installed. 
Date and Time Zone 
This screen, seen in Figure 2-17, enables you to select your time zone from the drop-down menu. Pick 
the city that is closest to your geographic area. This will allow your computer to automatically adjust its 
time whenever daylight savings time starts or stops. 
 
 
Figure 2-17. Date & Time selection screen 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
33 
By default, the Automatic Synchronization with Internet Time Servers (NTP) check box is selected. 
NTP
11 is an abbreviation for the Network Time Protocol, which allows a computer to receive its time from 
a time server on the Internet. Accurate time is needed for some applications (especially those that share 
data over a network) to work properly. You can deselect this check box if you don’t want your computer 
to connect to a time server. 
Optional Components 
The Optional Components screen, seen in Figure 2-18, enables you to select additional software to 
install with the operating system.

arrow to move it to Selected Components. You can use your Ctrl key to select multiple components. If 
you change your mind, you can use the left arrow to move a component back. The components that 
show in the Selected Components list will be installed for you. 
■ Note If you are installing from CD instead of DVD, you will be prompted to insert CD #3 if you select to install 
any additional components. 
Installation Summary 
The Pre-Install Summary screen, seen in Figure 2-19, provides a summary of your selections.  
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
35 
 
Figure 2-19. Pre-Install Summary screen 
The summary indicates the following: 
• 
Whether this is a fresh install, upgrade, or system restore. 
• 
Whether you are installing from a DVD or from a specified network location. 
• 
How the disk will be formatted. You will want to verify that you’ve selected the 
correct hard drive or installation partition and review the size of the partitions that 
will be created. 
• 
Which additional software components will be installed. 
• 
Which user account(s) will be created. 
This screen provides your last chance to go back and change your selections or to Abort the install. 
After you click Next and answer Yes to the “Start the installation now?” message, the specified hard 
drive/partition will be erased and the installation of PC-BSD will begin. During the installation, a 
progress bar, seen in Figure 2-20, will show the progress of the installation.

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
37 
If Something Goes Wrong 
PC-BSD could fail to install on your computer, although that possibility is rare. 
After the installation has started, its progress is written to various logs. The installer also sets up 
several virtual terminals where you can input commands and review the logs. You can access the first 
terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2. Type root at the login prompt to log in to the terminal, and then cd 
/tmp to access the location where the logs are located. 
■ Tip Use Alt+F7 to return to the installation screen. Alt+F3 through Alt+F6 represent the remaining virtual 
terminals. 
The following logs are created in /tmp: 
.pc-sysinstall/pc-sysinstall.log: Everything the installer does gets copied here. 
The error will be at the bottom of this log, and everything that succeeded will be 
before the error. If the install is successful, a copy of this log can be found at 
/pc-sysinstall.log on the newly installed system. 
sys-install.cfg: All of the settings you selected in the installation menus are 
stored here. 
xstartup.log: X is the software that is used to load up the graphical interface.  
If the installer has problems with your video hardware, the error will be in  
this log. 
Advanced users can review the logs to see what went wrong. If the problem is not clear after reading 
the log, skim through Chapter 11, which shows you how to get help. You will want to make a copy of the 
log files so you can include the information other users will need to help you. One method is to e-mail a 
copy of the log to yourself by using the following command, which will send an e-mail with a subject of 
“installation log”:  
 
# cat xstartup.log | /usr/bin/mail -s "installation log" myname@mycompany.com 
 
Replace xstartup.log with the name of the log file you would like to e-mail to yourself and replace 
myname@mycompany.com with your own e-mail address. 
You can also save the log file to a USB thumb drive. After inserting the drive, you can mount it, copy 
the log file, and umount the drive with the following commands. Don’t forget to type in that umount 
command before you remove the thumb drive so PC-BSD knows that you are finished using it. 
 
# mount -t msdos /dev/da0s1 /mnt 
# cp /tmp/xstartup.log  /mnt 
# umount /mnt 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD

Post Installation 
The first time you boot into PC-BSD, the Display Settings screen, seen in Figure 2-22, will prompt you to 
confirm your display settings. Select the name in the drop-down Video Card menu that most closely 
matches the Vendor and Model settings you wrote down for your video card. 
 
 
Figure 2-22. Selecting the video driver and resolution for the newly installed PC-BSD system 
■ Tip The “Determining Hardware Settings” section at the beginning of this chapter describes how to find out 
your video hardware settings if you do not know what video card is installed on the computer. 
You can also change your screen resolution at this time. The resolutions that are available will 
depend on what settings are supported by your video hardware. When finished, click Apply and then OK 
so your settings can be tested. If you like the resolution, click Yes when you see the Confirm Resolution 
screen. If you don’t like the resolution, click No so you can try another resolution. 
■ Tip If you have problems configuring your display settings, use the default Video Electronics Standards 
Association (VESA) settings, which will work but may not provide your favorite resolution. See Chapter 11 to learn 
how to get help for the best settings supported by your video hardware. 
After your resolution has been set, the system will finish booting into PC-BSD. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
39 
■ Tip If you are installing PC-BSD into VirtualBox and have problems setting the resolution, use System Settings 
as described in the “Display” section of Chapter 6. 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed your PC-BSD system! You are ready to move on to 
Chapter 3 to learn how to get comfortable with your new operating system. 
■ Tip If you are connected to the Internet and there are software updates available for your system, you’ll receive 
an informational message on your screen. If you want, skip ahead to the “Software Manager” section of Chapter 8 
to learn more about system updates. 
Advanced Installation 
Creating Partitions 
By default, the PC-BSD installer assumes that you want to either replace the existing operating system 
on the computer or that you have an extra partition that you can install into. If you want to keep your 
existing operating system and it is currently installed into the only partition on your computer, you will 
need to shrink that partition to create some free space that can be used to install PC-BSD. The PC-BSD 
installer will not do this for you, meaning that you will have to use another application for this purpose. 
■ Caution Always back up your data before resizing a partition, just in case! 
What utility you use depends on your current operating system: 
Vista: Use the Disk Management utility and the instructions from 
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Can-I-repartition-my-
hard-disk.  
Mac OS X: Use the Disk Utility and the instructions at 
www.makemacwork.com/resize-disk-partitions.htm. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
40 
Ubuntu: You can install and use
12 gparted with the following commands: 
# sudo apt-get install gparted 
# sudo gparted 
 
You can also use the Parted Magic CD, introduced in the “Determining Hardware Settings” section, 
to create free space. This time, boot with the Parted Magic CD and wait for it to load its graphical 
environment. You can then click the Partition Editor icon on the desktop to display your current 
partition information, as seen in Figure 2-23. 
 
 
Figure 2-23. Resizing a partition by using Parted Magic 
We will use the same example for the rest of this chapter. The computer in this example is currently 
running Ubuntu 8, which has been installed onto the entire hard drive. Ubuntu has created one large 
partition (71.64GB), plus a small extended partition (2.89GB), plus a small swap partition (2GB). 
Right-click the partition you want to resize and select Resize/Move from the menu. Input the 
amount of free space you want to create at the end of the existing partition. Remember, this must be at 
least 10GB (10000MiB) and should be larger if you will be saving a lot of large files in PC-BSD. 
In this example, free space of 20GB was created by inputting 20000 and then clicking in the New 
Size input box. The new partition will show as unallocated after you click the Resize/Move button. To 
save your changes, click the Apply button. A message will ask, “Are you are sure you want to apply the 
pending operations?” Click Apply and wait for the application to indicate that all operations were 
successful. Depending on the size of the drive, this will take a few minutes.  
                                                 
12 Usage instructions are available at http://gparted.sourceforge.net/docs/help-manual/ 
C/gparted_manual.html. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
41 
After the free space is available, it needs to be turned into a partition. To do so, click Partition ➤ 
New, as seen in Figure 2-24. 
 
 
Figure 2-24. Creating a new partition in Parted Magic 
The default settings are fine, because they will use all of the free space and create a primary partition 
(which is necessary for an installation). The filesystem is only temporary because it will be overwritten 
by the PC-BSD installer. If you want, add a descriptive label. Click Add and then Apply. 
Once finished, you can close Partition Editor and click the icon in the lower-left corner to log out. 
Don’t forget to remove the CD after the system starts to reboot. Remember the size of the partition you 
created so you can find it easily in the Disk Setup screen (Figure 2-14) during the PC-BSD installation. In 
this example, it will be displayed as ad0s3:20002MB (Linux native). The number was slightly lower than 
what showed in Parted Magic because of the Round to Cylinders option. 
Booting Multiple Operating Systems 
If you selected to install the PC-BSD boot loader, it will provide a simple menu at boot time that probes 
the type of filesystems (hence, operating systems) installed on the computer. To continue the example 
seen in the previous section, the PC-BSD boot loader menu looks like this: 
 
F1  Linux 
F2 ? 
F3 FreeBSD 
 
F6 PXE 
Boot: F1 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
42 
F1 is the first partition containing Ubuntu. F2 was the small partition created by Ubuntu. F3 is the 
PC-BSD installation. F6 indicates that this computer’s network card supports booting over a network.
13 
The value after Boot indicates which operating system will boot if you don’t make a selection. To make a 
selection, use the key on your keyboard that matches the menu selection; for example, to boot PC-BSD, 
use the F3 key. 
Although PC-BSD will properly probe the partitions, it may or may not be able to load each of the 
listed operating systems. Whether an operating system boots depends on which bootloaders those 
operating systems expect to be loaded from and where their boot info has been written to disk. 
In this example, Ubuntu should boot by typing F1, but it does not because of the way its boot code is 
currently installed. The next section will show how to fix this. 
You should test each operating system in your PC-BSD boot menu to see whether it boots. You will 
need to read the rest of the chapter if an operating system does not boot. You may find that each 
operating system boots, but you would like to try an alternate (different-looking) boot manager. If this is 
the case, see the upcoming “Using the GAG Boot Loader” section. 
If You Prefer GRUB 
Many Linux operating systems, including Ubuntu, use the GNU Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB)
14 
boot loader. If you prefer the GRUB boot loader to the PC-BSD boot loader, or if the PC-BSD boot loader 
won’t boot your Linux operating system, you will need to run the GRUB utility. Insert your Linux DVD 
and select to boot into its live DVD. If your Linux DVD does not have a live DVD option, you can still use 
a live CD such as Knoppix.
15 
We will continue with our Ubuntu example. To boot into the live version of Ubuntu, insert the 
Ubuntu DVD and select Try Ubuntu Without Any Change to Your Computer from the menu. After the 
live DVD has loaded, click Applications ➤ Accessories ➤ Terminal and type the following commands: 
 
# sudo grub 
[sudo password for dru: 
Probing devices to guess BIOS drives. This may take a long time. 
       [ Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported.  For 
         the first word, TAB lists possible command 
        completions. Anywhere else TAB lists the possible 
        completions of a device/filename. ] 
 
grub> root (hd0,     (press tab to see menu) 
 Possible partitions are: 
     Partition num: 0,  filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83 
                                                 
13 The “Thin Client Server” section in Chapter 13 shows you how to boot over a network. 
14 www.gnu.org/software/grub/ 
15 www.knoppix.org 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
43 
     Partition num: 2,  [BSD sub-partitions immediately follow] 
         BSD Partition num: 'a',  Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0xa5 
         BSD Partition num: 'b',  Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0xa5 
         BSD Partition num: 'd',  Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0xa5 
         BSD Partition num: 'e',  Filesystem type unknown, partition type 0xa5 
     Partition num: 4,  filesystem type unknown, partition type 0x82 
 
In our example, Ubuntu is in partition 0, PC-BSD is in partition 2, and partition 4 is the SWAP 
filesystem. Because we want Ubuntu to boot from GRUB, we want to select and set up the 0 partition, 
which contains Ubuntu: 
 
grub> root (hd0,0) 
 
grub> setup (hd0) 
 Checking if "/boot/grub/stage1" exists... yes 
 Checking if "/boot/grub/stage2" exists... yes 
 Checking if "/boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5" exists... yes 
 Running "embed /boot/grub/e2fs_stage1_5 (hd0)"... 16 sectors are embedded. 
Succeeded 
 Running "install /boot/grub/stage1 (hd0) (hd0)1+16 p (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage2 
/boot/grub/menu.1st"... succeeded 
Done. 
 
grub> quit 
 
GRUB is now configured to replace the PC-BSD boot loader menu and properly load Ubuntu. 
However, don’t reboot yet, because you still have to tell GRUB about PC-BSD. Continue on to the next 
section to add PC-BSD to the GRUB boot menu. 
If You Need to Add PC-BSD to GRUB 
In order to add PC-BSD to your current GRUB boot menu, you’ll first need to determine what version of 
GRUB you are using: 
 
# grub - -version 
grub (GNU GRUB 0.97) 
 
Next, add an entry for PC-BSD to the GRUB menu list. This command will open that file in a 
graphical editor:  
 
# sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst 
 
You should see your existing Ubuntu entries toward the end of the file. If this file is empty, check for 
errors in the commands mentioned in the previous section. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
44 
If the operating system is using a version of GRUB less than 2, as seen in our example, add the 
following lines after the last menu entry: 
 
title          PC-BSD 8 
rootnoverify   (hd0,2) 
chainloader    +1  
boot 
 
If the operating system is using a version of GRUB 2 or higher, add these lines instead: 
 
title          PC-BSD 8 
root           (hd0,2,a) 
kernel         /boot/loader 
boot 
 
Reboot the computer and press Esc when you see the GRUB boot loader message. You should now 
be able to boot into either Ubuntu or PC-BSD. 
If You Want to Replace GRUB 
Before adding another boot loader, you need to make sure that a boot sector is written to the Linux 
partition. To do so, find the device name for your Linux partition by running this command while 
booted into Linux: 
 
# sudo fdisk -lu | grep Linux 
/dev/sda1            63     109274129      54637033+     83     Linux 
/dev/sda5    150239943      156296384        3028221     82     Linux swap / Solaris 
 
In our example, Ubuntu Linux is installed on /dev/sda1. To make sure boot code is written on that 
device, use the following: 
 
# sudo grub-install /dev/sda1 
Searching for GRUB installation directory ... found: /boot/grub 
Installation finished. No error reported. 
This is the contents of the device map /boot/grub/device.map. 
Check if this is correct or not. If any of the lines is incorrect, 
fix it and re-run the script 'grub-install'. 
 
(hd0)  /dev/sda 
■ Caution If you don’t install boot code on the Linux partition before installing another boot loader, you may not 
be able to boot your Linux installation! 

CHAPTER 2 ■ INSTALLING PC-BSD 
 
45 
Using the GAG Boot Loader 
There are other boot loaders available that are easier to configure than the PC-BSD or GRUB boot 
loaders. We recommend the Graphical Boot Manager (GAG), which can boot up to nine operating 
systems. It is easy to use, and screenshots are available at http://gag.sourceforge.net/pics.html. 
■ Caution If you are replacing GRUB with GAG, make sure that you follow the instructions in the “If You Want to 
Replace GRUB” section before installing GAG! 
Download GAG,
16 unzip the download, and burn the file named cdrom.iso to a CD. Boot from the 
CD, which will bring up a menu of the following options: 
 
1: Read instructions 
2: Read FAQ 
3: Read license 
4: Install GAG 
5: Uninstall GAG (Restores MBR) 
 
Press 4 to install GAG. Select your keyboard from the keyboard type screen and your language from 
the language screen. In the next screen, press S to set up GAG, and then press A to add your first 
operating system to the boot menu. 
Continuing our example, GAG shows the following partitions: 
 
Key    Partition type 
 A     Boot from floppy 
 B     83h Linux EXT2 
 C     A5h FreeBSD 
 D     82h 
 
In this example, Ubuntu is probed as B, and PC-BSD as C. I’ll press B and type in a description of 
Ubuntu 8. GAG will then give an option to enter a password. If a password is entered, it will be needed 
before GAG will boot Ubuntu. If I just press Enter, GAG won’t require a password. GAG will then provide 
a menu of icons to go with the entry. I’ll select D to choose the Tux penguin. 
I’ll then press A to add the second operating system, press C to select FreeBSD, type in PC-BSD 8 for 
the description, add no password, and press F to select the Beastie icon. 
When you have finished adding all of your operating systems, press H to save your changes to the 
hard disk. You should receive a GAG Installed Successfully message. Press R to return to the main menu, 
and your entries should now show in the boot menu. Remove the CD, and reboot the computer to test 
that you can boot into each of the operating systems.

Summary 
This chapter has shown you how to “test drive” PC-BSD by using the live DVD or a virtual environment. 
It has also covered every aspect of installation, from a default installation to more-complex installation 
scenarios.  

PART   2 
 
 
 
 
Using the  
PC-BSD Desktop

 

C H A P T E R  3 
 
■ ■ ■ 
 
49 
Customizing the Desktop 
Now that you’ve successfully installed PC-BSD, you’ll want to become familiar with your new system. 
Part 2 of this book will show you how to customize your PC-BSD environment, perform common 
computing tasks, and configure every aspect of your system. You’ll discover a lot of cool features as you 
work your way through the chapters in Part 2. These chapters are also handy to refer to whenever you’re 
wondering “How do I do this?” 
KDE4  
PC-BSD version 8.0, the focus of this book, uses the KDE4 (KDE version 4) desktop environment by 
default.  
■ Tip In Windows, the desktop is part of the operating system. This means that you can customize your desktop, 
but you can’t install a different desktop. In open source, the desktop is separate from the operating system, 
meaning you can choose which desktop environment to install and use. PC-BSD pre-installs the KDE desktop for 
you—later in this chapter we’ll show you how to change desktop environments if you decide that you would like to 
try another desktop. 
Like PC-BSD, KDE
1 is a free software project with its own large user community. The goal of KDE is 
to provide a desktop that includes commonly used applications that can be run on computers running 
Linux, BSD, Windows, or Mac OSX. This project wishes to make its software available to anyone, 
including the disabled and those who speak a language other than English.

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
50 
■ Note The reader can find many more resources for using the KDE desktop at the KDE website. We recommend 
the KDE 4.0 Visual Guide.
2 
Because the desktop is separate from the operating system, you may find KDE on other free 
operating systems, such as some versions of Linux. Much of the information found in Part 2 of this book 
also applies to other operating systems running KDE4. However, PC-BSD adds some extra utilities that 
you will not find on other operating systems. As we come across these utilities, we will tell you so that 
you will know which features came with KDE and which are unique to PC-BSD. 
Default Desktop Components 
When you first log into your PC-BSD system, and before you start any of your own customizations, your 
desktop will look similar to Figure 3-1: 
 
 
Figure 3-1. Default KDE desktop on a PC-BSD system 
The KDE desktop has several components: the plasma panel, the plasma workspace, and the plasma 
dashboard. Each component is introduced below.

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
51 
Plasma Panel (Taskbar) 
Along the length of the bottom of your desktop is a gray taskbar, which is known as the KDE4 plasma 
panel, but which is commonly referred to as the taskbar. As seen in Figure 3.1 the default plasma panel 
on a PC-BSD system contains several icons. If you hover your mouse over any icon in the taskbar, you 
will see some information about the application that icon represents. You can click on any icon to open 
its associated application, or right-click the icon to receive a menu of options. 
Working from left to right, the default taskbar contains the following icons: 
Kickoff: In most versions of KDE, this is a white letter K on a blue background. 
On PC-BSD systems, the PC-BSD logo (which looks like a flame) is used instead. 
Kickoff is the KDE application launcher and is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 
Show the Desktop: If you have several windows open, you can click this button 
to quickly minimize all windows. Click the icon again to return the windows to 
the desktop. 
Show the Plasma Dashboard: Click to start the plasma dashboard. Using the 
plasma dashboard is explained in the next section. 
Device Notifier: This icon will notify you when a new device or media, such as 
a USB thumb drive or DVD, is inserted. 
Pager:  This icon looks like four squares, where each square represents a virtual 
desktop. Think of a virtual desktop as an area where you can group the 
applications you have opened in a way that makes sense to you. For example, 
you could use one virtual desktop for gaming and another virtual desktop as 
your productivity area for doing work. Simply click on the squares to switch 
between virtual desktops. 
Digital Clock: Click on the clock to access the multi-year calendar and click 
again to close the calendar. If you right-click the clock and select Digital Clock 
Settings, you can configure its appearance or change the time zone. 
System Tray: This area of the panel is to the left of the digital clock and appears 
to be in its own rectangle. It is preceded by an arrow, which lets you expand the 
system tray to see all of its icons. By default, the system tray contains the 
following icons:  
• 
KMixer: If you click on the speaker icon, you’ll see a slider, which you can 
use to adjust sound volume. You can also hover over the icon and adjust the 
volume with the scroll wheel of your mouse. If you click on the Mixer button 
below the slider, you’ll be presented with more sliders to fine-tune your 
sound settings. 
■ Tip If you have problems with sound in an application, open Mixer ➤ Settings ➤ Configure Channels and check 
all the Show/Hide boxes. Uncheck the Mute boxes and adjust the sliders to see if that fixes the lack of sound.

• 
Klipper: This clipboard tool keeps a history of your copy operations so you 
can paste into other applications. 
• 
PC-BSD Update Manager: This utility is found only on PC-BSD systems 
and is used to keep your operating system and installed applications up-to-
date. It is discussed in detail in Chapter 8. 
• 
KOrganizer: This is KDE’s calendar and reminder utility. KOrganizer 
supports many other features, including integration with KDE’s personal 
information management program (Kontact), journaling, and blogging. To 
learn more about KOrganizer, click on its icon, then press F1 to access the 
KOrganizer Handbook. 
• 
Notifications: Click this icon to receive a list of currently running or 
recently completed jobs, such as file downloads. 
■ Tip To access any application’s Help or Handbook, press F1 from within that application’s window. 
Two icons appear after the system tray: 
Trash: Click this icon to see which deleted files have been saved to the trash 
bin. Trash is discussed further in Chapter 4. 
Plasma: This icon looks like a color palette. It is used to configure widgets, and 
to add additional panels. These are discussed in detail later in this chapter. 
Plasma Workspace 
The area above the plasma panel is known as the plasma workspace. This is the area that users typically 
associate with their desktop wallpaper. By default, the PC-BSD workspace contains four useful icons:  
PC-BSD Official Website: This icon is a handy way to access the PC-BSD 
forums, online documentation, and other resources available from the PC-BSD 
website. We’ll discuss these resources in Chapter 11. 
Ports Console: This icon allows you to install FreeBSD ports and packages. 
Chapters 9 and 10 detail how to use Ports Console. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
53 
Software Manager:  This utility allows you to easily install software and is 
unique to PC-BSD. Individual applications that can be installed using the PC-
BSD’s Software Manager are known as PBIs.
3 How to install PBIs is discussed in 
detail in Chapter 8. 
Users Handbook: Click this link to read the online PC-BSD Users Handbook.  
As you read through Part 2 of this book, you’ll find that the plasma workspace is very customizable.  
Plasma Dashboard 
This component is invisible until you either click the Show the Plasma Dashboard icon in the taskbar or 
press Ctrl+F12. If you have any applications, they, along with the taskbar, will disappear from view and 
your screen will look similar to the one in Figure 3-2. Don’t panic. You can either click anywhere within 
the plasma workspace or press Ctrl+F12 again to return to your previous view.

■ Tip If you don’t see the menu in the upper right-hand corner, click on the plasma icon (the one that looks like a 
color palette).

The Dashboard can be used to add widgets or change folder view settings, both of which are 
described in more detail in this chapter. While these settings can be configured elsewhere, using the 
Dashboard provides an uncluttered workspace for making your changes. 
Customizing the Plasma Panel 
Now that we know what the default desktop looks like, it is time to customize! Figure 3-3 shows a panel 
that has seen several changes. Kickoff has been moved closer to the system tray, 12 application shortcuts 
have been added to the left of Kickoff, and several applications have been opened and minimized—these 
show to the left of the K3B icon. A news reader has been added to the system tray (square orange icon 
next to Kickoff), most of the default system tray applications have been removed, and a calendar widget 
has been added, which shows that the date is currently the 6th.  
 
 
Figure 3-3. Customized plasma panel 
Removing Icons 
To remove an icon, simply right-click it and select Remove this Icon from the pop-up menu. It will 
instantly be removed from the panel. 
To remove an icon from the system tray, right-click it and select Quit. A pop-up message will ask if 
you want to start the application the next time you login. If you select Start, it will disappear now and 
reappear the next time you login. If you click Do Not Start, it will stay out of the system tray. If you click 
Cancel, it will cancel the quit operation and remain in the system tray. 
Adding Icons 
Kickoff can be used to add application icons to the plasma panel. Doing so allows you to quickly access 
your favorite applications. Simply click on the icon in the taskbar to start the application. If you know the 
name of the application you would like to add, type its name into Kickoff. In this example, we’ll add the 
Yahtzee game. 
Click on Kickoff and begin to type the word yahtzee into the Search box. Once Yahtzee appears in 
the menu, right-click its entry in the menu and select Add to Panel as seen in Figure 3-4. An icon will be 
added to your taskbar; click on the icon to start playing Yahtzee. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
55 
 
Figure 3-4. Adding Yahtzee to the plasma panel 
Note that the pop-up menu provides two other options to quickly access the selected application. If 
you select Add to Favorites, Yahtzee will be added to a Favorites menu in Kickoff as seen in Figure 3.5: 
 
 
Figure 3-5. Yahtzee added to favorites 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
56 
If you select Add to Desktop, an icon will be added to your plasma workspace. This is similar to 
creating a desktop shortcut in Windows. 
If you wish, you can add an application in all three places since you are not limited to just one 
choice. 
If you don’t know the name of the application you would like to add but know what type of 
application you want to use, try using Kickoff’s search feature. For example, if you want to burn a CD but 
don’t know which utility to use, type in the search term cd. If you hover over the results, you’ll receive a 
description of the program. Figure 3-6 returns two search results. Hovering over K3b shows that it is 
used for CD and DVD burning. Hovering over KsCD shows that it is a CD player. 
■ Tip Your search results may vary, depending upon which software you installed during or after the installation 
of PC-BSD. 
 
Figure 3-6. Using Kickoff’s search feature to find an application 
If you still can’t find a suitable application, click on Applications within Kickoff and browse through 
the various categories to see if any of the applications look interesting. We’ll show you how to install 
additional applications in Chapter 8. 
Changing Icon Graphic 
To change an icon’s graphic, right-click the icon and select either Icon Settings or Properties from the 
pop-up menu. On the General tab, you’ll see a picture of the icon in the upper left-hand corner. Click on 
the picture to access the Icon Source screen shown in Figure 3-7. The default is to show the icons for 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
57 
Applications. Click on Applications to access the menu to select a different type of icon. If you have a set 
of icons that you have downloaded from elsewhere, click the Other icons button to browse to the 
location where you saved your icons.

Adding Widgets 
A KDE widget, also known as a plasmoid, is a small program that has only one purpose. There are 
widgets that show the time, monitor a laptop’s battery status, or show the current temperature. There 
are several ways to add widgets in KDE: 
• 
Press Ctrl+F12 to access the Dashboard. This will add the widget to the plasma 
workspace. 
• 
Right-click the plasma workspace and select +Add Widgets from the pop-up 
menu. This will add the widget to the plasma workspace. 
• 
Click or right-click the plasma icon in the upper right corner of your screen and 
select +Add Widgets from the pop-up menu. This will add the widget to the 
plasma workspace. 
• 
Click the plasma icon in the plasma panel and select +Add Widgets from the 
menu. This will add the widget to the taskbar. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
58 
■ Tip Widgets can be unlocked (the default) or locked. If widgets are locked, you will see Unlock Widgets instead 
of Add Widgets. Once you click on Unlock Widgets, you can then add a widget using any of the above methods. 
In this example, we’ll add a widget to the taskbar. Figure 3-8 shows the Add Widgets screen with All 
Widgets selected to show additional choices. Note that you can browse through all widgets or select a 
category of widgets to browse. You can also see which widgets are currently running. 
 
 
Figure 3-8. +Add Widget screen 
If you highlight a widget and click Add Widget, its icon will be added to the plasma panel. You can 
then click on the icon in the panel to access the associated application. 
Most widgets have their own configuration settings. Right-click a widget’s icon to access its pop-up 
menu. If you decide that you no longer want the widget in your panel, select the Remove option in its 
right-click menu. 
Installing New Widgets 
Figure 3-8 indicates that is possible to Install New Widgets. If you click on that button, you can choose to 
Download New Plasma Widgets or Install Widget from Local File. If you click on the Download option, 
you’ll see an installer menu similar to Figure 3-9: 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
59 
 
Figure 3-9. Install new widgets 
This menu allows you to sort widgets by Latest, Most Downloads, or Highest Rated. You can also 
enter a search phrase. 
If you prefer, you can use your web browser to search through the hundreds of widgets (plasmoids) 
available from kde-look.org. If you find a plasmoid you like, download it and use the Install Widget from 
Local File menu option to browse to the location where you saved the widget. 
■ Tip Browsing through kde-look.org can become addictive and time consuming! It contains thousands of free 
plasmoids, themes, wallpapers and other eye-candy for your KDE desktop. 
More Panel Settings 
You may have noticed when you clicked on the plasma icon to add a widget that there were several other 
settings, as seen in Figure 3-10: 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
60 
 
Figure 3-10. Additional panel settings 
Moving from left to right then bottom to top, these settings allow you to do the following: 
Screen Edge: Move the position and size of the taskbar. Click on Screen Edge 
and continue to hold down as you drag your mouse to a corner of your screen. 
If you don’t like the new position of the taskbar, drag it to a different corner 
until you find a position you like. You can also use the three slider arrows in the 
bar between the taskbar and the settings to adjust the length of the taskbar. 
Height: Adjust the height of the task bar. Click on Height and continue to hold 
down with your mouse as you increase or decrease the height of the taskbar. 
Increasing the height will also increase the size of any icons, making the taskbar 
easier to read. Adjust until you find a height that works for you. 
+Add Widgets: Add single-use applications as described in the previous 
section. 
Add Spacer: Separate areas of the taskbar. For example, you could separate 
your graphics utilities from your web browsers. Click on Add Spacer and a box 
with two gray lines will appear next to the plasma icon. Click on the box and 
four arrows will appear. Drag the box to the area of the task bar where you’d like 
the space to appear, then click elsewhere to let go of the box. The box will be 
replaced by a space on the taskbar. If you don’t like its position, you can right-
click the space to Remove it and try again. 
Lock Widgets: Prevent taskbar icons from being added or removed. The 
plasma icon  will also disappear, meaning panel settings cannot be modified. 
Simply right-click any icon and select Unlock Widgets when you need to make 
changes to the taskbar. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
61 
If you click on More Settings, you’ll find the following: 
Remove this Panel: If you select this option, you will be asked if you really want 
to remove this panel. If you do, you can add another panel by right-clicking the 
plasma icon in the upper right-hand corner of your screen and selecting +Add 
Panel. However, the new panel will be empty and you’ll have to re-add all of 
your icons and widgets.  
■ Tip If you accidently remove the original panel, you’ll find several of the original icons in the +Add Widgets 
screen. Kickoff is listed as Application Launcher and the virtual desktop pager is listed as Pager. 
Maximize Panel: If after adjusting your task bar it no longer extends to the edge 
of your screen, clicking this option will extend it for you. 
Visibility: Select one of four choices: Windows go below, Windows can cover, 
Auto-hide, or Always visible. The currently selected option will be highlighted 
with a gray bar. For example, in Figure 3-10, Always visible is the current 
visibility option being used. If you select Auto-hide, the taskbar will disappear 
until you hover the mouse near its location. If you select Always visible, the 
section of an open window that is dragged near the panel will disappear. 
■ Note You can configure a window to override the panel’s Always visible setting by right-clicking the window’s 
title bar ➤ Advanced ➤ Keep Above Others. This setting will also keep that window above other open windows.  
Panel Alignment: Select one of three choices: Right, Center, or Left. Changing a 
setting changes the position of the slider arrows used to adjust the placement of 
the taskbar. 
Folder Views 
In KDE, a folder view provides convenient access to the contents of the directories that you use most 
often. A folder view can appear as a movable area that sits on top of your workspace; it is transparent, 
meaning you can still see your wallpaper and other icons underneath the folder view. This section will 
show you how to add folder views to your workspace or panel, configure folder views, add contents to a 
folder view, and customize your folder view settings. 
Adding a Folder View 
In KDE, folder views are widgets. To add a new folder view to your desktop, right-click the plasma 
workspace ➤ +Add Widgets ➤ Folder View ➤ Add Widget ➤ Close. By default, a folder view of your home 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
62 
directory will be created. If you wish the folder to display the contents of a different directory, follow the 
instructions in the section on Configuring Folder Views. 
Adding a Folder View to the Panel  
You can also add a folder view to the plasma panel by clicking on the taskbar’s plasma icon ➤ +Add 
Widgets ➤ Folder View ➤ Add Widget ➤ Close. Again, the default folder view location will be your home 
directory. An icon of a blue folder will be added to your taskbar. To see the contents of the folder view, 
click on the icon. Figure 3-11 shows the contents of the Home folder view from both the plasma 
workspace and the plasma panel. 
 
 
Figure 3-11. Folder view of Home from the plasma workspace and the plasma panel 
Configuring Folder Views 
If you hover your mouse anywhere in a plasma workspace folder view, a toolbar appears on the folder 
view’s right edge.  
■ Tip If the toolbar does not appear, widgets are locked. Unlock widgets to access the toolbar. 
This toolbar contains four icons. Moving from the top down, these icons allow you to do the 
following: 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
63 
Resize: This icon is a square with arrows. Move your mouse while holding 
down on this square until the folder view is the desired size. 
Rotate: This icon looks like a circular arrow. Move your mouse while holding 
down on this icon and the folder view will rotate in either direction. 
Configure: This icon looks like a wrench. Click on the icon to open the Folder 
View Settings seen in Figure 3-12. You can change the directory the folder view 
represents by selecting another directory in the Show a place drop-down menu 
or you can Specify a folder by using the browse for directory icon. 
Remove: The letter X will immediately remove the folder view without asking 
you first. Don’t worry—it is easy to create another folder view if you do this by 
mistake! 
 
 
Figure 3-12. Folder view settings accessed from Configure icon of folder view toolbar 
Adding Contents to a Folder View 
To add an application to a folder view, highlight the application in Kickoff and use your mouse to drag it 
to the folder view. A pop-up menu will ask if you want to copy the application, link a shortcut, or cancel 
the operation. 
If you have created multiple folder views, you can drag and drop any type of icon between folder 
views. Highlight the icon and drag it with your mouse to the other folder view. A pop-up menu will ask if 
you want to move, copy, link, or cancel the operation. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
64 
More Folder View Settings 
Regardless of whether the folder view is on your workspace or panel, if you right-click the folder view 
you will access a menu of further options. These allow you to do the following: 
Create New:  
• 
Folder: Note that this is a subdirectory of the folder view, not another folder 
view.  
• 
Text file: After giving the file a name, double-click on the new file’s icon to 
add text to the file. 
• 
HTML file: After giving the file a name, right-click the new file’s icon to 
Open with Kwrite, if you want to edit HTML tags manually. Alternately, if 
you have an html editor, select Open With from the right-click menu and 
select the editor from your installed applications. If you double-click the 
icon, it will open the HTML file in your web browser. 
• 
Link to Location (URL): type in the URL and give the link a useful name. 
Whenever you wish to go to that website, simply double-click the link icon. 
• 
Link to Application: In the General tab, select an icon and give the link a 
useful name. Then click on the Application tab and use the browse button 
to find the application you wish to create a shortcut to. Once the link is 
created, you can start that application from your folder by double-clicking 
on its icon. This is similar to making a shortcut in Windows. 
• 
Link to Device: This allows you to create a shortcut to the following 
devices: CD-ROM, CDWRITER, camera, DVD-ROM, floppy, hard drive, 
another file system (listed as MO Device in the right-click menu), a remote 
directory on another open source operating system (NFS), and ZIP device. 
Undo: This option allows you to undo your last operation. Note that Ctrl+z 
appears next to this menu item. In KDE, keyboard shortcuts are listed next to 
their function in a menu. In other words, you can also press Ctrl+z to undo your 
last copy operation.  In Chapter 7 we will show you how to create your own 
shortcuts. 
Paste: Ctrl+v will also paste your last copy/cut operation from the clipboard 
into the currently selected file. If you press Ctrl+v multiple times, it will re-paste 
the text each time. 
Icons: This option does not appear in the menu if the folder view is in the 
taskbar. If the folder view is on the plasma workspace, it allows you to 
• 
Sort Icons: By name, size, type, or date. If you uncheck Folders First, 
subdirectories will be sorted with the other files; otherwise, they will be 
listed before files. 
• 
Align to Grid: If this option is unchecked, you can drag your icons 
anywhere and they may become cluttered over time. Checking this box will 
keep the icons neatly aligned. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
65 
• 
Lock in Place: If this option is checked, the icon will always bounce back to 
its original position, even if you try to move it. 
Refresh View: This option can be used to refresh the folder view if you make a 
change that doesn’t immediately show in the view (e.g., add files to a 
subdirectory or edit a file). 
Open with Dolphin: Dolphin is KDE’s explorer utility, similar to Windows 
Explorer or Gnome Nautilus. Dolphin is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 
Folder View Settings: This is another way of accessing the settings available 
from the wrench icon of the folder toolbar. 
Remove this Folder View: This option immediately removes the folder view. 
Folder View or Panel Options: These allow you to do the following. 
• 
+Add Widgets: Another way to add a widget. 
• 
+Add Panel:  Another way to add a panel. 
• 
Run Command: Only available if the folder view is on the plasma 
workspace. It starts KRunner, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 
• 
Lock Widgets: Prevents changes to widgets and panels until Unlock 
Widgets is selected in Desktop Options. 
• 
Lock Screen: Only available if the folder view is on the plasma workspace. It 
prevents access to the desktop unless you unlock the screen using your 
password. This is handy if you need to leave your desktop when other users 
are around. 
• 
Leave: Only available if the folder view is on the plasma workspace. Logout 
of your desktop session. 
• 
Folder View Settings: Only available if the folder view is on the plasma 
workspace. It allows you to set the desktop’s appearance. This is discussed 
in more detail later on in this chapter. 
• 
Panel Settings: Only available if the folder view is on the plasma panel. 
• 
Remove this Panel: Only available if the folder view is on the plasma panel. 
Configuring Windows 
Every application you start in KDE opens in its own window. The top of the window is known as the title 
bar and will contain the name of the application. If you grab the title bar with your mouse, you can drag 
the window to any location in your workspace.  
■ Tip You can also use a folder view’s title bar to move the folder view. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
66 
If you double-click the title bar, the window will maximize, or take up your entire screen. If you 
double-click the title bar again, it will return to its original size. If you hover near a corner of the window, 
a double arrow will appear. You can then use your mouse to resize the window to the desired size. 
By default, a window’s title bar lists the name of the application as its title. To the left of the title is 
the On all desktops button; to the right of the title are the minimize, maximize/restore, and close 
buttons.  Those buttons represent the following functions: 
On all desktops: Allows you to access the window from any virtual desktop. 
The default is to only show the window on the current virtual desktop.  
Minimize: Minimizes the window to the taskbar. Click on the minimized 
window to return it to your workspace. 
Maximize/Restore: Makes the window fullscreen or restores a maximized 
window to its original size. 
Close: Terminates the application. If the application has any unsaved changes, 
such as an editor, it should prompt you to save your changes. 
Advanced Window Options 
You can access many window settings by right-clicking a window’s title bar.  Figure 3-13 shows a listing 
of the Advanced settings. 
 
 
Figure 3-13. Advanced window settings 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
67 
The settings found by right-clicking a window’s title bar allow you to do the following: 
To Desktop: Check which virtual desktops you would like the window to 
appear in. 
Move: Allows you to easily move the window with the mouse. Click the window 
when you are finished to stop the move. 
Resize: Allows you to change the size of the window with the mouse. Click 
when you are finished to stop the resizing. 
Minimize/Maximize: Provides the same function as the minimize/maximize 
icons in the title bar. 
Shade: Hides the window and just shows the title bar. Right-click the title bar 
and uncheck shade to see the window again. 
Advanced: This option includes the following settings. 
• 
Keep Above Others: The window will stay above other windows. This can 
be handy when you are working in one window and need to view 
information from another window. You may have to resize or move your 
windows since the other windows will stay below this window. If you set two 
windows to this setting, click on the window you want to see and it will 
become the top window; click on the other window for it to jump to the top. 
• 
Keep Below Others: This window will always stay below other windows, 
meaning you may have to move or resize it to see its contents. 
• 
Fullscreen: In fullscreen mode, the window’s title bar, all other windows, 
and the panel disappear. A dialog message will remind you to press Alt+F3 
to access the menu settings so you can toggle off fullscreen mode. 
• 
No Border: This mode removes the title bar. Use Alt+F3 to access the title 
bar again. 
• 
Window Shortcut: This allows you to create a shortcut for launching the 
window. If there is currently no shortcut, the shortcut dialog will say None. 
Click on the word None and it will change to the word Input. Type in your 
shortcut (e.g., Alt+d) and the word Input will change to your shortcut. If you 
don’t like that shortcut, click it again and the word will change back to Input 
so you can try again. Be aware that window shortcuts are only for the 
lifetime of the window. When you close the window, the shortcut 
disappears. 
• 
Special Window/Application Settings: These settings are discussed in the 
next section. 
The remaining settings after Advanced include 
Configure Window Behavior: These settings are detailed in a following 
section. 
Close: Provides the same function as the X in the title bar. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
68 
Special Window Settings 
Figure 3-14 shows the menu and informational message you receive when you select a window’s 
Advanced ➤ Special Window Settings or Special Application Settings after right-clicking the window’s 
title bar. 
 
 
Figure 3-14. Special Window Settings or Special Application Settings configuration menu 
You’ll find that there are dozens of settings you can apply that affect only the window or application 
that you are configuring. If a setting looks interesting, check its box. This will activate its Do Not Affect 
drop-down menu of options. Most options deal with when to apply the change and if the change should 
be temporary or permanent. Some settings, such as Position and Desktop, will activate a third column 
where you can either type in a value or select from a list of options. 
If you change a setting, press OK to see if you like the change. If not, simply go back into Special 
Window Settings and try again. 
There are many reasons, besides curiosity, for wanting to change a window’s special settings. As an 
example, have you ever opened a window and wished that it had opened in a different location in your 
workspace or opened at a different size? Special Window Settings allow you to specify exactly where and 
at what size that window will open, either now or permanently.  
Configuring Window Behavior 
Figure 3-15 shows the menu you receive when you right-click a window’s title bar and select Configure 
Window Behavior. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP

Figure 3-15. Configure Window Behavior menu 
This section discusses the configurations available for each option listed in the left frame of this 
menu. 
Desktop Effects 
KDE supports many effects that can transform your computer from merely useful to cool. Effects include 
animating a window when it is opened, minimized, maximized, or closed. Unlike Special Window 
Settings, effects apply to all windows, not just the window that opened the Configure Window Behavior 
menu. This video
4 contains a tour of some of the most popular desktop effects. 
By default, effects are turned on, and if your video card supports it, compositing will be enabled. If 
so, spend some time in the All Effects tab to see which effects appeal to you. To try out an effect, check 
its box. Each effect includes 
• 
a wrench icon, which lets you change its configuration or return it to its default 
configuration. 
• 
an informational icon, which provides a brief description of the effect and contact 
information for the person who created the effect.

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
70 
■ Note Some video cards do not support desktop effects. If compositing is disabled and Resume Compositing 
fails, or if you receive an error message when you press Apply to try out an effect, you’ll need to do some 
homework to see if your video card can be configured to work with desktop effects. See Chapter 11 to learn how 
to get help from the PC-BSD community. 
If you know the name of the effect you would like to enable, type its name into the search bar on the 
All Effects tab to quickly find that effect. Some popular desktop effects include  
Present Windows: Provides an overview of your open windows. Once you have 
enabled this effect, you can arrange all of your open windows side-by-side by 
pressing the top-left corner of the workspace with your mouse or by pressing 
Ctrl+F9. Ctrl+F10 will show the windows from all virtual desktops.  
Desktop Cube Animation: Each virtual desktop is a side of a cube that can be 
rotated to select and switch to a virtual desktop. 
Desktop Grid: Displays all of your virtual desktops or workspaces in a grid so 
you can easily drag windows between virtual desktops or select a virtual 
desktop. Once this effect is activated, Ctrl+F8 shows the grid. The desktop grid 
also supports animations. 
Taskbar Thumbnails: Enables live previews of minimized windows when you 
move the mouse over an entry in the taskbar.  
Translucency: Allows you to see the contents of a window even if another 
window is covering it. This effect supports several configuration settings, such 
as making drop-down menus translucent. 
There are many ways to add animation to window events such as minimizing, closing, or moving. 
Try Explosion, Wobbly Windows, Fall Apart, and Magic Lamp. 
Windows 
This section allows you to configure the look and feel of window titles. It contains two tabs: 
Window Decoration: The appearance of a window’s title bar is controlled by a 
theme. The default theme is Nitrogen. If you click on this word, you’ll see a list 
of other themes. If you select a theme, the bottom of the screen will show you a 
preview of what the title bar will look like. If you then click Apply, you’ll notice 
that all of the title bars in any open windows will change to the new theme. 
Depending upon the theme, there will be several settings that you can change. 
These include the window title border size, where in the title the window’s 
name appears, and whether you want stripes on either side of the window title. 
Buttons: This tab allows you to customize the positions of the window title 
buttons. You can drag and drop to change the order of the buttons and press 
Apply to try out the new button positions. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
71 
Actions  
This section contains two tabs: 
Titlebar Actions: This tab allows you to configure what happens when you 
double-click the title bar (the default is to maximize the window) or roll the 
mouse wheel over the title. You can also configure your mouse buttons to raise 
or lower active and inactive windows.  
Window Actions: This tab allows you to configure how you bring an inactive 
window into focus with your mouse buttons. You can also configure a modifier 
key, such as Alt or Ctrl, to work with your mouse buttons to configure an action 
such as raise or resize the window. 
■ Tip While you can have many windows open on your workspace, only one window is considered active or “in 
focus,” meaning it will accept input. When you click on an inactive window, it comes into focus and becomes the 
active window. Watch the title bar of your windows—depending upon your theme, the title bar of the active 
window will look slightly different from the inactive windows. 
Focus 
This section allows you to configure a delay when you activate a window and provides some controls for 
window switching on multiple virtual desktops. 
Moving 
This section provides the following options for when you move a window: 
• 
Display content in moving windows. 
• 
Display content in resizing windows. 
• 
Display window geometry when moving or resizing. 
• 
Allow moving and resizing of maximized windows. 
It also allows you to set the size of the snap zone. 
Advanced  
This section allows you to do the following: 
Enable hover: When you shade a window (by choosing that option after right-
clicking the title bar) the window disappears and you only see the title bar until 
you un-shade it. If you enable hover before shading a window, the window will 
reappear if you hover your mouse near the title bar.

Placement: Indicates where a window will be placed when it is started. The 
default  Smart option will try to start the window in a section of the workspace 
not occupied by another window. 
Window-Specific 
This section allows you to access the configurations set in the Special Windows Settings, which were 
discussed earlier in this chapter. You can modify or delete the current configurations or add a new 
configuration. 
Configuring Themes and Wallpapers 
If you right-click your workspace and select Folder View Settings, you will see a menu similar to  
Figure 3-16. 
 
 
Figure 3-16. Desktop Settings menu 
The Appearance portion of this menu allows you to set the following: 
Desktop Type: The default type is Folder View, meaning that your desktop will 
look like a traditional desktop, with the contents of your Desktop directory 
showing as icons on your workspace. If you change to Desktop view, the icons 
will disappear. This setting will affect all of your virtual desktops. 
Theme: Several themes are already installed for you. You can select a different 
theme from the drop-down menu. Desktop themes affect the look of panels and

folders and provide a preview of their look. If you click on the New Theme 
button, it will open a window where you can browse and search through 
plasma themes at kde-look.org. 
Wallpaper Type: KDE4 supports different types of wallpapers. Each option will 
show you a preview of the current selection. The configuration options that 
appear depend upon the type of wallpaper you select: 
• 
Color: When selected, click on the Color bar that appears to select the color. 
To create a custom color, click on a colored area in the left-hand square and 
it will show up in the little square next to its HTML value. If you like that 
color, click on Add to Custom Colors. You can also click on the eyedropper 
icon, then click on a color from another window, and save that selection as a 
custom color. 
• 
Virus: When selected, it will let you browse for an image and set an update 
interval and maximum number of viruses. Once you Apply, the wallpaper 
will change to your picture and the viruses will slowly eat it over time. 
• 
Mandelbrot: Allows you to select three colors and the mandelbrot quality. 
• 
Weather: This type of wallpaper gives you a view of the local weather 
anywhere in the US, UK, and Canada. Select the provider, type in a city, and 
click Search to receive a list of matching cities. Once you apply, your 
desktop should change to a picture representing the current weather 
conditions. If it doesn’t, try another city. 
• 
Pattern: Allows you to select from several patterns and to customize the 
foreground and background colors. 
• 
Image: Allows you to browse for an image, and choose its position and a 
border color. Note that the border only shows in certain positions. 
• 
Slideshow: Lets you select a directory of images and configure how often 
the images change. 
• 
Globe:  Lets you choose from several map themes, the type and quality of 
map, and the type of rotation. 
Several of the wallpaper types provide a Get New Wallpapers button to allow you to browse through 
kde-look.org’s wallpapers. If you install a wallpaper, it will be added to the drop-down selection menu 
for that type of wallpaper.  
Switching Desktop Environments 
As you have seen throughout this chapter, KDE is a highly customizable desktop environment with 
many features. While KDE is the default PC-BSD desktop, it is not the only desktop that was installed for 
you.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
74 
There are several reasons for switching desktop environments: 
• 
KDE is resource-intensive and may run too slowly on older computer hardware. 
• 
Some users don’t like all of the bells and whistles provided by KDE and prefer a 
simpler desktop. 
• 
Some users are curious or want to switch desktops “just because they can.” 
You will need to logout in order to switch your desktop. Click Kickoff ➤ Leave ➤ Logout. Once your 
session has ended you’ll see a Welcome to pcbsd login box in the center of your screen. Before typing in 
your username and password, click on the button with three horizontal lines in the lower-left corner of 
the login box. A session type pop-up menu will show you which desktop environments are available to 
log into. The next two sections will demonstrate selecting Fluxbox and TWM from this menu. 
Fluxbox 
Fluxbox
5 is a light-weight desktop that is well suited to older hardware or users who prefer a desktop with 
less eye-candy than KDE. Select Fluxbox from the session type menu, then input your username and 
password to login. Figure 3-17 shows a default fluxbox session. Right-clicking the workspace produced 
the application launcher menu seen in the center of this figure. 
 
 
Figure 3-17. Fluxbox running on PC-BSD

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
75 
The fluxbox taskbar contains fewer icons than the KDE taskbar, but it still provides access to Kmixer, 
Klipper, and the PC-BSD system updater tool. Most of the applications available from a KDE session 
should also work in fluxbox, though you will have to manually start them from the command line if they 
are not listed in the application menu. 
■ Tip If you need to switch your keyboard layout in fluxbox to support your alphabet, see http://fluxbox-
wiki.org/index.php?title=Switch_Keyboard_layout. 
TWM 
If you’d like to try a desktop with absolutely no bells and whistles, select TWM
6 from the session type 
menu.  
■ Tip Unless you select another option in the session type menu when you login, PC-BSD will automatically start 
your last desktop environment. 
Figure 3-18 shows a TWM session.

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
76 
 
Figure 3-18. TWM desktop 
When you first start TWM, all you will see is your wallpaper. Click on the desktop and hold down 
your mouse to see the green rectangular application launcher menu. If you drag your mouse down to 
Xterm, it will start a command prompt for you, but it expects you to drag the new window to the desired 
location. In other words, you’ll see what looks like a grid, which will only turn into the white command 
window after you drag it to a location. As you can see from the limited choices in the application 
launcher menu, TWM is designed for the person who likes to type commands. 
Switching to GNOME 
Open source is known for providing many choices. Some users prefer the GNOME
7 (pronounced gi-
nome) desktop environment. GNOME provides many of the same features as KDE, but uses a different 
layout. Like KDE, GNOME is an open source project with a large community of users. Many Linux 
desktops use GNOME instead of KDE. 
While PC-BSD doesn’t install GNOME for you, it is easy to install and try out GNOME on your PC-
BSD computer. To install GNOME, make sure you are connected to the Internet. Click on the Software 
Manager icon on the Desktop or open Software Manager from Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ System. Once 
you input the administrative password, a Software Browser tab will show the software that is available 
for install. 
                                                 
 
7 See http://gnome.org 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
77 
■ Tip Software Manager is discussed in detail in Chapter 8. 
Type the word gnome into the Search bar, and you should receive search results similar to Figure 3-
19. Note that the size of this PBI is large; like KDE, GNOME is a very feature-rich desktop. 
 
 
Figure 3-19. Using Software Manager to install GNOME 
Click the download icon, then OK to the pop-up message that asks if you want to install GNOME. 
The status of your download will show in the Installed Software tab. When the download is complete, the 
installation of the GNOME PBI will start. Click Next through each of the installation screens to complete 
the install (the meaning of each installation screen is detailed in Chapter 8). Due to its size, it will take 
several minutes for the installation to complete. 
Figure 3-20 shows the informational message you receive after GNOME is finished installing, 
indicating that you need to logout of your KDE session to start using GNOME. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
78 
 
Figure 3-20. Installation of the GNOME PBI is finished. 
To logout of your session, click Kickoff ➤ Leave ➤ Logout. When the login menu appears, click the 
button in the lower-left corner (it has three lines running through it), then select Gnome from the drop-
down menu. Once GNOME is selected, input your username and password to login to a GNOME 
desktop. Figure 3-21 shows a default GNOME session; your desktop may vary if you have customized 
your KDE desktop since GNOME will show any desktop icons that you created in KDE.  
 
 
Figure 3-21. Default GNOME install on PC-BSD 

CHAPTER 3 ■ CUSTOMIZING THE DESKTOP 
 
79 
GNOME provides two taskbar panels, one at the bottom and one at the top of the screen. The 
application launcher is located next to the GNOME foot in the upper left-hand corner. Like KDE, 
GNOME provides its own set of applications, meaning the Application menu will differ significantly from 
Kickoff’s application menu. 
This book does not cover how to use or customize the GNOME desktop. We recommend that 
interested readers refer to the GNOME User Guide.
8 
Other Desktop Managers 
There are literally hundreds of open source desktop managers. Xwinman.org provides a list of the more 
popular desktops, including their descriptions and screenshots. 
As of this writing, PC-BSD provides PBIs for the Enlightenment, KDE3, GNOME, and XFCE desktops. 
The x11-wm category of the FreeBSD ports collection provides nearly 150 desktops. Refer to Chapters 8 
through 10 for detailed instructions on installing PBIs and software from the FreeBSD ports collection. 
■ Note While you can install and run other desktop environments on your PC-BSD system, PC-BSD is optimized 
for KDE4. Most other desktops will not provide icons for PC-BSD specific graphical utilities, meaning you will have 
to access these utilities from the command line. Installing an alternate desktop from the FreeBSD ports collection 
is an exercise best left to power users or users who are experimenting on a test computer or within a virtual 
environment. 
Summary 
This chapter has introduced you to the components of the KDE4 desktop and how you can customize 
these components. It has also described alternative desktop environments for those users who would 
like to try non-KDE4 desktops. 
In the next chapter, we’ll learn how to launch applications using Kickoff as well as how to customize 
Kickoff’s menus.

Getting Around 
In Chapter 3, we spent a fair bit of time customizing the look and feel of your PC-BSD system. In this 
chapter, we’ll get down to work and show you how to find and access your files and applications. We’ll 
include plenty of tricks and tips so you can find what you need quickly and in ways that are intuitive to 
you. 
Dolphin File Manager 
In Chapter 3, you learned how to create folder views to see and access the contents of a directory. But 
how do you get an overview of all of the files and directories on your system?  
KDE4 provides a comprehensive file manager, known as Dolphin. To access Dolphin, click the 
Kickoff icon and select File Manager from the Favorites menu. 
■ Tip Remember, you can also add Dolphin to your desktop or taskbar by right-clicking the word Dolphin in 
Kickoff and selecting Add to Desktop or Add to Panel from the pop-up menu. 
Figure 4-1 provides a screenshot of Dolphin with a file selected. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND  
 
82 
 
Figure 4-1. Dolphin file manager  
Note the red - next to the sometext.txt file, indicating that it is the currently selected file whose 
contents are displayed in the Information panel. 
Directories in Dolphin are represented by the folder icon. If you use your mouse to hover over an 
icon, the Information panel will display its contents and give you some information about the selected 
file or folder. If you double-click an icon, you will either see its contents (if it is a folder) or launch an 
application capable of opening the file. Use the back and forward buttons to navigate between a selected 
folder and its contents.  
Right-clicking an icon will open a pop-up menu with several options. The available options vary 
depending upon whether the icon represents a directory or file, and by type of file. Many of the options 
are intuitive so we will discuss only the ones you may not be familiar with. Here are options for 
directories: 
Open in New Tab: Tabs provide a useful view to focus on a folder’s contents 
and allow you to view several files or folders at once. You can open as many 
tabs as you wish. To close a tab, click on its orange X. 
Add to Places: This will add the directory to the Places panel on the left, 
allowing easy access to that directory. For example, you may find it useful to 
add your Downloads or Music folder if you access these directories often.  
Open with: Allows you to view the contents of a directory or open a file with the 
specified application. If the application you would like to use is not in the list, 
select Other and browse for the application. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND 
 
83 
The following actions are also available: 
• 
Subversion: Subversion allows you to keep up-to-date with a “repository” 
of files on another system. Subversion is discussed in more detail in  
Chapter 15.
1 
• 
Archive/Sign/Encrypt/Decrypt: Chapter 5 will show you how to setup 
encryption keys so you can protect the contents of a folder. You can also 
perform these actions on individual files. 
• 
Open Terminal Here: Will open Konsole so you can type into a command 
prompt. 
• 
Start a Slideshow: Allows you to view the contents of a folder as a 
slideshow. Press Esc to end the slideshow and return to your original screen. 
You should experiment with the Icons, Details, Columns, Preview, and Split buttons to see which 
view you prefer. For example, split view makes it easy to drag and drop contents between folders. 
■ Tip The second column will be empty in Column view until you double-click an icon in the first column. You can 
use your mouse in Details view to change the width of the Name, Size, and Date columns. Right-click that area to 
select from a menu of possible details you can view. 
Dolphin Menu Options 
Dolphin provides additional options through the menus below the title bar. Most of these options are 
intuitive so we will highlight some useful features: 
• 
File ➤ Properties ➤ General will show you how much free space is left on your 
hard drive. 
• 
View ➤ Navigation Bar ➤ Editable Location opens a location bar where you can 
type in the name of the folder/file you would like to view. 
• 
Tools ➤ Find File allows you to search using a variety of factors, such as a file’s 
name, contents, date, size, or owner.

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND  
 
84 
• 
Tools ➤ Show Filter Bar allows you to type in text so you can just view the icons 
matching that text. 
• 
Tools ➤ Compare Files allows you to see if there are differences between two files 
or the contents of two folders. Use Split view to highlight the icons to compare or 
hold down the Ctrl key to select two icons. 
• 
Help ➤ Dolphin Handbook (or F1 while in Dolphin) will show you how to get the 
most out of Dolphin. 
Dolphin Places 
Places allow you to quickly access the data locations you use most frequently. You can right-click  
any folder and select Add to Places. Once a folder is added to Places, it is also added to the Kickoff ➤  
Computer menu, allowing you to quickly access its contents. 
The default Places include Home, Network, Root, and Trash. These are discussed below. 
Home 
By default, Dolphin will present you with the contents of your home folder. When you create your own 
files or folders, you should save them somewhere within your home folder. This makes it easier to find 
and backup your own data. It also prevents you from inadvertently modifying or deleting important files 
needed by the operating system. To create a new file or folder, simply right-click any empty area within 
the Home view and select Create New from the pop-up menu.  
Network 
If there are other computers in your home or work network, this portion of Places allows you to browse 
the resources being shared by those computers. Figure 4-2 shows a screenshot of Network Places. If you 
double-click the Network icon, you will see the computers in your network. If you double-click the 
Samba Shares icon, you’ll see the network’s workgroup; you can browse the workgroup to see which 
network shares are available.  
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND 
 
85 
 
Figure 4-2. Network Places in Dolphin 
If you hover over each icon in Network Places and read the text at the bottom of your screen, you’ll 
see that each shortcut is actually a link to one of these three KIO slave protocols:  
• 
network:/  
• 
zeroconf:/ 
• 
smb:/ 
In KDE, a KIO slave controls one of nearly 50 supported protocols, with each protocol providing 
access to a type of resource. For example, the network KIO slaves seen in Network Places provide quick 
access to resources on different types of networks.  
Another way to take advantage of KIO slaves in Dolphin is to check View ➤ Navigation Bar ➤ 
Editable Location. You can then type in a protocol name to access the associated resource.  
Commonly used KIO slave protocols are listed in Table 4-1. It is worth spending some time typing 
each into Dolphin’s navigation bar to see which protocols are useful to you. Don’t forget to include the :/ 
after the name; for example, with an audio CD in your drive, type audiocd:/ to view the contents of the 
CD (don’t just type audiocd). 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND  
 
86 
Table 4-1. Useful KIO Slave Protocols

All of the protocols listed in Table 4-1 also work if you type them into KDE’s web browser, 
Konqueror. More Konqueror tips are discussed later in this chapter. 
■ Tip Once you have accessed a resource using a KIO slave protocol in Dolphin, if you find it handy, right-click on 
an empty space in its view and select Add to Places to create a shortcut to the resource. 
Adding a Network Folder 
The Add Network Folder in Network Places allows you to create your own network folders. If you 
double-click this icon, you will launch the Network Folder Wizard seen in Figure 4-3. 
 
                                                 
 
2 Samba allows you to access shares on Windows computers. See http://www.samba.org for more information. 
3 The Wikipedia entry for WebDAV provides a good introduction: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webdav. 
4 The Wikipedia entry on zerofconf provides a good introduction: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroconf. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND  
 
88 
 
Figure 4-3. The Add Network Folder wizard 
Select the type of network folder you would like to create and click Next. You will then be prompted 
for further information (such as the address of the server you would like to connect to). This is similar to 
mapping a network drive in Windows, but you are able to connect to a wider variety of network services. 
Root 
In Dolphin, Root Places refers to the root, or beginning, of the operating system’s file system, not to the 
administrative user’s home directory (the administrative user is also known as root). In other words, it 
allows you to see all of your system’s parent folders. Figure 4-4 shows a screenshot of Root Places with 
the Icons view selected. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND 
 
89 
 
Figure 4-4. Root Places in Dolphin 
Most of the folders are system folders, meaning their contents are needed by the operating system. 
You should leave these folders as-is unless you are an administrator and understand the changes you are 
making.  
If you have used Linux before, you probably recognize some of the folder names. However, the 
contents of the folders may be different from what you are used to on your Linux system. man:/hier will 
explain the contents of all of the folders except PCBSD and Programs, which are unique to the PC-BSD 
operating system. Table 1 in the Appendix provides an overview of each folder and indicates which 
folders should be left as-is. 
Trash 
You probably recognize the concept of a trash or recycle bin. By default, any files you delete using 
Dolphin will be placed in Trash and stay there until you empty it. If you click on Trash, you can view 
your recently deleted files. Right-click a file to either Restore it or permanently Delete it, as seen in  
Figure 4-5: 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND

Figure 4-5. Right-clicking a deleted file in Trash Places 
■ Note Any file you delete from the command line does NOT go into Trash, meaning it is instantly deleted. 
You can also access Trash Places by double-clicking the Trashcan icon in your taskbar. If you right-
click the Trashcan icon in the taskbar, you can quickly and permanently delete all of the files in Trash 
Places by selecting Empty Trashcan. Figure 4-6 shows the configuration menu you receive when you 
select Trashcan Settings from the Trashcan icon’s right-click menu.

Konqueror 
Konqueror is KDE’s built-in web browser; it can be accessed from Kickoff ➤ Web Browser. Konqueror is 
much more than just a web browser and has features that allow you to quickly access and manipulate 
files. This section provides some useful tips for using Konqueror. 
The first time you open Konqueror, you will see a screen similar to Figure 4-7. 
 
 
Figure 4-7. Main screen of Konqueror 
The top portion of Konqueror looks like a web browser as it provides a toolbar of icons, a location 
bar where you can type in an Internet URL, and a search bar. The middle section provides links to 
quickly access your Home folder, trashcan, network folders, and your web bookmarks. In other words, 
anything you can do in Dolphin, you can also do in Konqueror. If this is your first time using Konqueror 
(or if you only have used Konqueror for web browsing), take a few minutes and click on the link entitled 
Next: An Introduction to Konqueror. 
You can also access your files using Konqueror’s location bar. Try typing file:/ . If you pause slightly 
after the slash, all of the folders on your system will appear in the scroll-down menu. You can either 
select one, or keep typing. The more you type, the more Konqueror narrows down the folder and file 
names that match the path you have typed. Once you have selected or typed the path to the desired file, 
Konqueror will display it for you using a plugin for an application that understands the file format. For 
example, if you select a text file, Konqueror will display the text and allow you to modify the text. 
Konqueror will add a Save and Save As icon to the toolbar so you can save your changes to the file. If you 
select a graphic, Konqueror will add Zoom icons to the toolbar to assist you in viewing the image. 
Konqueror has been designed to display many types of files and to modify the icons in the toolbar so 
that they make sense for the type of file being displayed. For some file formats, such as Office documents 
or PDF files, Konqueror will open the file in an external program.  

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND  
 
92 
If you explore Konqueror’s menus, you’ll find all kinds of intriguing options that deal with files and 
web browsing. Here are a few examples to get you started: 
• 
If a website gives an error stating that your browser is unsupported, try setting 
Tools ➤ Change Browser Identification to a different value. 
• 
If you have a bunch of tabs open that you aren’t finished with, but you need to 
shutdown your system, click File ➤ Sessions ➤ Save As and give your session a 
name. You can reopen that session later as it will be added to your File ➤ Sessions 
menu. 
• 
To translate a webpage, select the to and from languages from Tools ➤ Translate 
Web Page. 
• 
To see your file system while you browse the Internet, select Settings ➤ Show 
Navigation Panel. You can then drag a download link from the web browser panel 
to a location in the Navigation Panel. Figure 4-8 provides an example of dragging 
the downloadable link labeled English to the Documents directory. Selecting Copy 
Here will download the file associated with the link. You can also view two 
websites simultaneously using the Split View options from the Window menu. 
Click on one of the panes to use the location bar. 
 
 
Figure 4-8. Dragging a download link to Konqueror’s Navigation panel 
We have barely scratched the surface of all of the cool things you can do in Konqueror. Spend some 
time poking about—you may find that you can access anything you want on your PC-BSD system from 
this one utility!

KRunner 
KRunner is a handy way to start applications. Figure 4-9 shows the KRunner interface. While it looks 
quite simple, KRunner has some pretty nifty built-in features. 
 
 
Figure 4-9. KRunner 
Press Alt-F2 to launch KRunner. If you know the name of the application you would like to start, 
type its name into the dialog box. If you’re not sure of the name of the application, start typing a search 
term and KRunner will present you with a list of applications that match, as seen in Figure 4-10. The 
down arrow to the right of the type-in box can be used to scroll through recently launched programs.  
 
 
Figure 4-10. Using KRunner to find an application using a search term 
KRunner isn’t limited to just finding and launching applications. You can also use it as a 
Calculator: Type in your equation using * for multiplication, / for division, + for 
addition, and – for subtraction. Put the = sign before the equation and don’t use 
any spaces. Figure 4-11 shows the result of multiplying 12 and 1024.

Unit converter: Need to convert miles to kilometers? Try typing “100 miles in 
km.” Typing “100 euros in ca” will convert euros to Canadian dollars. KRunner 
supports several types of unit conversions. Try typing the unit that you know 
and KRunner will respond with a list of what it is able to convert to. 
Web shortcut: If you type gg:bsd, KRunner will open a tab in your default 
browser and display Google’s (gg:) results for the search term “bsd.” If you 
prefer to instead see the Wikipedia entry for the term bsd, type wp:bsd. You can 
view other existing web shortcuts and create your own in Konqueror ➤ Settings

“fp:” to Freshport’s search utility (Freshport is discussed in more detail in Chapter 9). Note that the 
Search URI always ends in \{@} as this tells Konqueror to add the search phrase you type after the 
shortcut. After pressing OK, the new shortcut will show up in the Web Shortcuts menu. Don’t forget to 
check its box and press Apply in order to start using the shortcut in KRunner. 
■ Tip If you check the Enable Web shortcuts box, web shortcuts will also work within Konqueror. Otherwise, they 
will only work with KRunner. 
 
Figure 4-13. Creating a new web shortcut for KRunner 
KRunner supports other operations using a plugins system. You can configure which plugins are 
available by clicking on the wrench button on the far left of KRunner. Figure 4-14 shows some of the 
available plugins. If one sounds interesting, click its informational button (to the right of the plugin 
name) to receive a short description of the plugin.

If your system is running slowly, you can use this utility to determine if an application is slowing 
things down. Check out the CPU% column. Things are normal if the number is quite low. If the number 
is very high, that application is slowing your system down. 
■ Tip You can also type ksysguard into KRunner. This will open up a similar window, but will add a System Load 
column, as seen in Figure 4-16.

Launching Applications with Kickoff 
Kickoff, the right flame icon in the far left corner of your taskbar, provides another way to view and 
launch your applications. 
■ Tip In addition to the Kickoff application that was pre-installed in the taskbar panel, there are two Application 
Launcher widgets (Kickoff style and traditional style) and a QuickLaunch widget. Any of these can be added to a 
panel or your plasma workspace. The Quicklaunch widget allows you to quickly launch the applications contained 
in your Favorites. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND

This section will concentrate on the Kickoff style application launcher. Figure 4-17 shows the menu 
you see when you click on Kickoff.  
 
 
Figure 4-17. Kickoff menu 
If you type in a search phrase, Kickoff will display any applications that match by name or 
description.  
The bottom of Kickoff contains five icons: 
Favorites: If you right-click an item in Kickoff, you have the option of adding it 
to your Favorites menu. If you right-click an item in Favorites, you can add it to 
your Desktop or Panel or remove it from Favorites. 
Applications: This utility sorts your installed applications into categories, as 
seen in Figure 4-18. If you click on a category, the menu will slide in the 
direction of the arrow; use the arrows to browse back and forth between a 
category and its list of applications.

functions.  
If you right-click the Kickoff icon, you will access a menu of the following choices: 
Menu Editor: Allows you to customize Kickoff’s categories and which 
applications appear in which categories. This is discussed further in the next 
section. 
Switch to Classic Menu Style: Allows you to view and launch applications 
using the previous KDE style. Figure 4-19 shows the Classic Menu. The top five 
applications (without arrows) represent the past five applications used on this 
system.

switch tabs on hover, show applications by name, and set a keyboard shortcut 
to launch Kickoff. 
Remove this Application Launcher: If you do so, you can re-add the 
Application Launcher widget at a later time. 
■ Tip If you ever lose the PC-BSD flame icon and want to reapply it to Kickoff, use Application Launcher Settings 
➤ Select Icon ➤ Other icons ➤ Browse ➤ /usr/share/skel/.fluxbox/icons/pcbsd.png. 
Menu Editor 
KDE provides the ability to modify the categories and applications that appear in Kickoff. Figure 4-20 
shows a screenshot of Menu Editor, the utility provided for this purpose. Right-click the Kickoff icon to 
open the Menu Editor.

Figure 4-20. Menu Editor utility 
Each of the categories found in Kickoff’s Application panel will appear in Menu Editor’s left frame. 
Click on the arrow next to a category to see its list of applications. If you highlight an application, the 
right frame will activate, allowing you to modify its settings. In Figure 4-20 the KBlocks application in 
Games ➤ Arcade is highlighted. The General tab allows you to configure the following items: 
Name & Description: These are searched whenever you type a search phrase 
in Kickoff, so it can be useful to use descriptions that make sense to you.  
For example, if you have difficulty remembering the name of the software  
used to burn CDs, make sure its description contains “burn” so you can search 
for that term.

versions of an application. 
Command: Power users can add switches to modify a program’s behavior. 
Enable launch feedback: If checked, you’ll see a little bouncy icon while the 
application is starting. 
Place in system tray: This will place an icon for the application in the system 
tray when you open the application.  
Only show in KDE: If checked, the application will show in KDE application 
launchers but not in other desktop environments, such as GNOME. 
The Advanced tab allows power users to configure these items:  
Work path: The location where the application starts. 
Run in terminal: Check this box if you are adding a command line application.  
Run as a different user: Check this box and type in “root” if the application 
needs to start as the super user. 
Current shortcut key: Allows you to set or change the shortcut key to launch 
the application. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ GETTING AROUND 
 
103 
While in Menu Editor, you can cut, copy, paste, or delete any category or application. You can also 
add a new item, submenu, or separator through the menus, icons, or by right-clicking. This allows you to 
customize Kickoff to meet your needs. 
Summary 
This chapter has shown you the many ways you can find files and launch applications within KDE. 
Chapter 5 will further explore the applications available on your PC-BSD system and demonstrate how 
to perform common tasks.

Performing Common Tasks 
Now that you know how to get around your customized desktop, it’s time to start using PC-BSD! In this 
chapter, we introduce you to some of the software that is available for your day-to-day computing needs. 
We also show you how to perform various computing tasks such as encrypting or compressing files, 
importing your data from another system, accessing data on removable drives, configuring a printer, 
and sharing your desktop. 
Which Built-In Application Do I Use? 
If you’ve used only Windows operating systems, it can take some time to get used to the idea of having 
literally thousands of applications at your fingertips, all at no cost to you. For any given task, a choice of 
applications is usually available to suit the needs of any type of user. Some applications are barebones 
with command-line programs that get the job done, whereas others are feature-rich with a snazzy 
looking interface. Several other choices range between barebones and feature-rich. 
You might find that the applications you are used to using and paying for are missing on PC-BSD. 
This doesn’t mean that you can’t use those applications on PC-BSD because you might still be able to 
use them. There is also a good possibility that an equivalent program is already installed or available for 
PC-BSD. In fact, there are probably several equivalent programs available, some of which might even 
contain features not provided by your original program. This is part of the open source experience—
discovering the world of software choices and possibilities available to you. 
PC-BSD installs many useful applications for you. Many start with the letter K, meaning that they 
come with the KDE desktop. These applications can be launched from Kickoff or KRunner. 
■ Note If you use KDE on another operating system, it might include the applications mentioned here, depending 
upon which KDE components are installed with that operating system. 
Many of these applications are intuitive to use. If one sounds interesting, start it and poke about its 
menus. Don’t forget that each application should have its own handbook that is accessible if you click F1 
in the application or go to its Help menu. The application’s handbook is a good reference for learning 
more about how to use the features provided by the program. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
106 
■ Table 2 in the Appendix provides a summary of some of the built-in applications and where you can find them 
in Kickoff ➤ Applications. It also provides a handy reference when you’re wondering which application is available 
to perform a certain task. 
Which PBI Do I Use? 
PC-BSD uses the PBI (Push Button Installer) system to make it easy to find, install, run, and uninstall 
commonly used applications. We demonstrate in detail how to use the PBI system in Chapter 8.  
Table 3 in the Appendix lists some of the most popular software available using the PBI system. If 
you want to install additional software, spend some time perusing the websites listed in this table. You’ll 
probably find what you’re looking for, and the websites contain all of the screenshots, feature lists, and 
documentation you need to get started with using the application. 
■ Tip If you have existing Windows applications you have already purchased, spend some time checking out 
Bourdeaux, Crossover Games, Wine, and Virtual Box, which are listed in Table 3 of the Appendix. If you can’t find 
your favorite Linux application, refer to the “When You Can’t Find Your Favorite Application” section in Chapter 8. 
Windows Equivalents 
If you are used to using the Windows operating system, you might want to know which specific 
applications provide similar functionality to the applications you have been using. If you don’t have time 
to look for software, Table 4 in the Appendix contains a list of software available for the PC-BSD and the 
equivalent application for Windows. 
These equivalents will get you to work on your PC-BSD system in no time. However, we still 
recommend that when you have more time, you look for other equivalents. A lot of great software exists, 
and you might not know what you’re missing! 
Importing Data 
The last consideration when researching which software is best for you is how to get your existing data 
into the new application. Many applications have made it easy for Windows users to migrate their 
existing data. Table 5-1 lists some common data sources and websites that contain instructions about 
how to import that data into the listed application. Note that the data sources listed in this table are in 
formats that need to be imported into the new application, meaning that you can’t just copy the files 
over to your PC-BSD system.

For data that doesn’t need to be imported, several utilities make it easy to drag and drop existing 
files and directories from your old system to your PC-BSD system. If the existing data is on a network 
share, you can use Split View in Konqueror. In Figure 5-1, the user dru opens Konqueror, and then clicks 
Window ➤ Split View Left/Right. She then clicks the Home Folder link in the left frame to show the home 
directory of her PC-BSD system.

The user can now click on the Network Folders link in the left frame, and then click the Samba 
Shares icon to browse for the files to copy over the network. The user simply drags the file to copy from 
one pane to the other. 
■ Tip This chapter assumes that the network share is already configured for you. Chapter 7 demonstrates how to 
create network shares on your PC-BSD system and discusses the basics of Samba shares. 
If the existing data is on a system running SSH, use sftp:// in one of Konqueror’s panes to connect to 
the other system. You can then drag and drop between panes. Figure 5-2 demonstrates a connection to a 
computer with the IP address 192.168.1.105 and the username dlavigne6. Before the connection is 
completed, a pop-up message prompts for the password of the user.

■ Tip SSH is a secure method for transferring files. It is often seen on open-source systems and is what system 
administrators use most often to transfer files. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS

If you have backed up your existing data to an external USB drive, simply plug it into your PC-BSD 
system. It automatically displays in Dolphin’s places. In the example shown in Figure 5-3, the user has 
opened Dolphin and clicked View ➤ Split. She highlighted the left pane and clicked Home, and then she 
highlighted the right pane and clicked Volume (ufs). She can now drag and drop files between her 
computer and the USB hard drive. 
 
 
Figure 5-3. Using Dolphin to copy files between a PC-BSD computer and a USB hard drive 
When finished using the USB drive, don’t forget to right-click the USB media and select Unmount 
Volume (ufs) from the menu before physically unplugging the device. This is the safe way to eject the 
device and to let your PC-BSD system know that you are finished using the USB drive. 
Web Browser 
The rest of this chapter demonstrates how to perform some common tasks on PC-BSD. We start with 
some of the features users expect to see in their web browsers. 
Flash and Java 
Your PC-BSD system comes with Java and the latest version of Flash (as of February 2010, version 10) 
pre-installed and preconfigured for you. Multimedia websites such as Youtube, video.google.com, 
veoh.com, and moviefone.com should work in Konqueror and the Firefox PBI.

■ Note If you happen to come across a website that doesn’t work, see Chapter 11 for instructions on how to get 
help from the PC-BSD forums. 
MS TrueType Fonts 
Your PC-BSD system comes with many pre-installed fonts (these are discussed in Chapter 6). If you 
wish, you can also use Software Manager to install the PBI for MS TrueType Fonts, which adds the 
following fonts to your system: 
• 
Andale Mono 
• 
Arial Black  
• 
Arial (Bold, Italic, Bold Italic)

Files 
Chapter 4 introduced you to the Dolphin File Manager. This section shows you how to encrypt/decrypt 
and compress/uncompress your files, and how to access the contents of the clipboard. 
File Encryption 
When you encrypt and decrypt files, you use something known as a public/private key pair. As the name 
suggests, the public key is made available to others, the private key must be kept secret and available 
only to yourself, and the two keys are related as a pair. Wikipedia provides a good introduction to 
encryption concepts at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography. 
Before you can encrypt or decrypt files, you have to generate a public/private key pair. The next 
section shows you how to do this using KDE’s Gpg Assistant. If you already have a key pair, you can skip 
ahead to the “Encrypting/Decrypting” section. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
111 
Creating a Key Pair for Encryption 
KGpg Assistant can be used to generate your key pair. You can access this application using Kickoff ➤ 
Applications ➤ Utilities ➤ Encryption Tool.  
The Assistant starts with some informational messages as it goes through the process of creating a 
key pair for you. You can accept the default locations for the GnuPG binary and configuration file and 
leave the boxes checked to generate the new key and start KGpg automatically at KDE startup. 
The assistant then opens a tip message and the Key Generation - KGpg menu seen in Figure 5-4. 
 
 
Figure 5-4. Generating a key pair with KGpg 
You can complete this configuration screen as follows. 
Name: Input your first and last name so others know to whom the key belongs. 
Email: Input the email address you would like to associate with the key. 
Comment (optional): This field is optional and can help remind you why you 
use the key. 
Expiration: By default, your key never expires. You can select days, weeks, 
months, or years from the drop-down menu, and then type in the desired value. 
Key size: The larger the key size, the harder it is to bypass the encryption 
provided by the key. You should select the largest key size available. 
Algorithm: Unless you have a reason to change this to RSA, you can use the 
default. 
Expert Mode: Power users can use this button to generate keys at the command 
line. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
112 
■ Tip The KGpg Handbook contains information about each of the menus contained in the KGpg program. You can 
access it by pressing F1 in the program or by selecting Help ➤ KGpg Handbook. 
After you enter the values and click OK, a screen displays where you should type in your passphrase. 
It is important that you choose a passphrase that you can easily remember, but that is difficult for others 
to guess. The passphrase is needed to decrypt your files; if you lose it, you can’t access the contents of 
your encrypted data. If someone else guesses it, he can access your encrypted data. After you input your 
passphrase two times, you will see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 5-5. 
 
 
Figure 5-5. New Key Pair Created - KGpg confirmation screen 
The fingerprint is unique to the key and can be used to determine that you are using the correct key. 
If you send your public key to others, they can use the fingerprint to verify that the key is correct. You 
should either save or print the revocation certificate. If you forget your passphrase or if your private key 
is compromised or lost, the revocation certificate is used to notify others that they should no longer use 
that public key. A revoked public key can still be used to verify signatures made by you in the past, but it 
cannot be used to encrypt future messages to you. It does not affect your ability to decrypt existing 
messages, assuming you remember your passphrase.  
After you click OK, the new key pair displays in the Key Management screen. You’re now ready to 
encrypt and decrypt your files. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS

Encrypting/Decrypting 
Now that you have a key pair, let’s go back to Dolphin. Right-click the file you would like to encrypt and 
select Actions. As seen in Figure 5-6, there are two Encrypt File actions; the first uses the KGpg utility, 
and the second uses the Kleopatra application. We demonstrate both utilities. 
 
 
Figure 5-6. Encrypting file actions in Dolphin 
To encrypt with KGpg, select the first Encrypt File option. KGpg presents the menu seen in Figure  
5-7. Click the Options button to see the possible encryption options. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
114 
 
Figure 5-7. Using KGpg to encrypt a file 
Before highlighting your key and clicking OK, review the options. 
ASCII armored encryption: This does not encrypt the file; instead, it adds an 
encrypted “envelope” that protects the file from getting mangled by email 
programs. If you choose this option, the file will end with an .asc extension. 
Allow encryption with untrusted keys: This option is not needed for encrypting 
your own files in Dolphin. If you are using KGpg to encrypt an email message, 
you need to use the recipient’s public key to encrypt the message so he can use 
his private key to decrypt it. This means that you have to first import the 
recipient’s public key into KGpg; at that time, you will have the option to 
indicate whether or not you trust the key. 
Hide user id: This option is useful only when using KGpg to encrypt email. It 
removes the recipient information; if the wrong recipient receives the email, he 
won’t know the name of the key to use to decrypt the message. 
Symmetrical encryption: This is the option that actually encrypts the message. It 
prompts you to enter your passphrase twice. 
Because your intent is to encrypt the file, select the Symmetrical encryption option. It is up to you to 
keep the ASCII armored encryption option selected or deselect it. If you’re planning on emailing the file, 
it is good to keep this option. If you uncheck this option, the encrypted file will end with a .gpg extension 
instead of an .asc extension. The resulting file will be placed in the same directory and have the same 
name as the original file with the new extension added. 
If you select the second Encrypt File action, the file is encrypted with Kleopatra instead. When 
Kleopatra first starts, it displays a self-test screen; if you don’t want to see this screen, uncheck the Run 
these tests at startup box. Click the Continue button to see the screen in Figure 5-8. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
115 
 
Figure 5-8. Kleopatra encryption manager 
Kleopatra offers the following options. 
Sign and encrypt: This option encrypts the file and proves that it came from you 
(was signed by you). This is useful when emailing a file. 
Encrypt only: This option is similar to the Symmetrical encryption option in 
KGpg. 
Sign only: This option does not encrypt the file, but proves it came from you; 
again, this is useful when emailing a file. 
ASCII armor: This option is similar to the ASCII armored encryption option in 
KGpg. 
Remove unencrypted original: Because this option removes the original file, 
don’t forget your passphrase because you will need it to access the contents of 
the decrypted file. 
After you select your option(s), click Next. The next menu prompts you to highlight the file you plan 
to encrypt. After you do this, you click Next. 
The Recipients menu might seem strange if you are not sending the file to anyone (for example, you 
are only encrypting a file on your hard disk). Think of it this way: you want to be able to access the 
contents of the encrypted file, so you are its recipient. Click the Add Recipient button and highlight the 
recipient’s key (that is, your key) in the Certificate Selection menu. Click OK, and then click Next. You 
can click OK after Kleopatra indicates that your encryption was successful. You should now have a file 
with the same name as the original and a .gpg or .asc extension. If you highlight the encrypted file, 
Dolphin indicates that it is PGP/MIME-encrypted and won’t allow you to preview it in the Information 
panel. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
116 
If you right-click the encrypted file and click the Actions menu, you can choose one of the following 
options. 
Decrypt/Verify File: This action prompts you for a folder to save the decrypted 
file. After choosing the location, click the Decrypt/Verify button. You are 
prompted to enter your passphrase because you can’t decrypt without it. 
View file decrypted: This option is for text files only. Choose this option if you 
want to view the file without saving a decrypted copy. It again prompts you for 
your passphrase. After you enter it, the file opens in an application capable of 
viewing its contents. If you make changes to the file, you have the option of 
saving your changes and re-encrypting the file. 
■ Tip Kleopatra puts a red and white icon in your system tray. Double-click this icon to see the main Kleopatra 
window shown in Figure 5-9. 
 
Figure 5-9. Main screen for Kleopatra encryption utility 
Exporting Your Public Key  
If you sign files or send encrypted emails, you need to export your public key so it is available to the 
recipients of the signed files and emails. You can export your public key using KGpg. Highlight your key 
in the Key Management screen and click the Export Key icon. The menu seen in Figure 5-10 displays.

Figure 5-10. Exporting a public key in KGpg 
■ Tip If you “lose” KGpg, click the arrow to expand your system tray. It is the icon that looks like a yellow lock. 
If you select the Email option and click OK, your default email program (KMail, unless you change 
the default) opens, and the public key is pasted into the body of the email. Simply type in the recipient’s 
address and a subject before sending the email. 
If you want your public key to be available to many recipients, select a Key server from the drop-
down menu and let everyone know which server you use. If recipients go to the URL of the server and 
search for the name associated with the key, they can download your key. Remind recipients to contact 
you to verify the fingerprint so you both know that they have the correct key. 
You can also save your public key to a file and give that file to recipients as they need a copy of your 
public key.

■ Note After your friend has a copy of your public key, she will need to import it into her key management 
software before using your key to verify/decrypt the files and emails you send. 
Compressing Files 
You have probably downloaded or created .zip files. These are examples of compressed files—files that 
have been reduced in size (compressed) either to conserve disk space or to reduce download time. 
Compression utilities are built in to your PC-BSD system, making it easy to work with compressed files. 
Using Ark 
Ark is KDE’s archiving application. Think of an archive as a container holding one or more compressed 
files. When you compress
1 a file, directory, or a number of files, you create an archive.  
You can launch Ark from Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ Utilities ➤ Archiving Tool. 
■ Tip The Ark Handbook provides more usage information for this application. It can be accessed by pressing F1 
in Ark or by selecting Help ➤ Ark Handbook. 
Figure 5-11 shows the menu you see when you click the New icon in Ark.

Figure 5-11. Creating a new archive with Ark 
This menu prompts you to indicate where you want to store the archive, the name of the archive 
you are creating, and the type of compression to use for the files to be stored in the archive. If you share 
or send the compressed files to a user on a Windows system, you can create zip archives. If you and the 
person you share the archive with are familiar with the other file formats, you can select another 
compression method. In the example shown in Figure 5-12, a zip file called test has been created. You 
add files to compress and store inside the archive with the Add File or Add Folder icons. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
120 
 
Figure 5-12. Ark interface for adding files to a new archive 
As you add a file or directory, Ark automatically compresses it in the archive. Ark displays the 
contents of the archive in a tree view (any directories between the selected folder and the root of the 
filesystem are unnamed—you can click through these to expand to the view you want to use). If you 
highlight a file and click Preview, you can view the uncompressed version of the file or list the 
compressed directory’s contents. Use the Extract button to browse to the location where you would like 
to save an uncompressed version of the highlighted file or directory. 
If you download or someone sends you a compressed archive, use the Open button to browse to its 
path. You can then preview and extract the contents of the archive. Table 5-2 summarizes the 
compression formats that Ark supports.

Using Dolphin 
If you right-click a file or directory in Dolphin, the following options for Compress are available. 
As ZIP Archive: This option creates a compressed .zip file with the same name 
as the highlighted selection in the same directory.  
As RAR Archive: This option creates a compressed .rar file with the same name 
as the highlighted selection in the same directory.  
As ZIP/TAR Archive: This option creates a compressed tar.gz with the same 
name as the highlighted selection in the same directory. 
Compress To: This option opens an Ark menu where you can browse to the 
location to save the archive and select which compression method to use in the 
Filter drop-down menu.

If you right-click an existing archive in Dolphin, the following options are available. 
Open with Ark: Allows you to preview the contents of and extract the archive. 
Extract Archive To: This option takes you directly to the Extract screen in Ark 
where you can select the directory to which you want to uncompress the 
contents of the archive. 
Extract Archive Here: This option extracts the archive contained in the 
underlying directory structure. For example, an archive named mystuff.doc.zip 
would be extracted to a folder called Home. That folder would contain dru ➤ 
Documents ➤ mystuff.doc.  
Using the Clipboard  
By default, KDE’s clipboard tool Klipper is placed in your system tray and looks like a small black box on 
a larger box. If you ever remove it from the tray, you can start it from Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ Utilities ➤ 
Clipboard Tool. 
Klipper keeps a history of your copy and cut operations. If you click or right-click Klipper, you can 
see your last seven clipboard items and the following actions: 
Enable Clipboard Actions: This option enables actions that allow you to 
associate an expression with an action. How to configure an action is discussed 
later in this section. 
Clear Clipboard History: Occasionally, Klipper becomes confused if you have 
performed several recent copy operations; clearing the history should get you 
pasting again. 
Configure Klipper: Figure 5-13 shows the Configuration options which are 
discussed next. 
Help: This option launches the Klipper Handbook. 
Quit: Klipper remains in your system tray until you select this option. If you do, 
it asks you if you want Klipper to start the next time you log in.

Figure 5-13. Klipper Configure menu 
The General configuration screen enables you to configure many settings, including how many  
copy operations are saved to the clipboard. If you need to copy and paste images, uncheck the Ignore 
images box. 
The Actions menu enables you to associate actions with regular expressions. Figure 5-14 shows the 
expression and action that will allow you to click a URL in the Clipboard History to open it in Konqueror. 
Note that this action does not work unless the Enable Clipboard Actions box is checked in Klipper.

Figure 5-14. Associating an action with a regular expression in Klipper 
■ Tip Regular expressions are definitely in the realm of power users. If you’ve created an Action that is useful to 
you, share it on the PC-BSD forums so less advanced users can benefit from your expertise. Chapter 11 introduces 
you to the PC-BSD community. 
The Shortcuts tab enables you to view and create shortcuts to the options in the Klipper menu. 
Removable Media 
PC-BSD makes it easy to access the data on removable media as it can automatically notice the new data 
source and make it available to you. This section discusses dealing with CDROMs and DVDs, and USB 
devices such as thumb drives, USB hard drives, and digital cameras. 
CDROM/DVD 
If you insert a data CDROM or DVD disk containing data and wait a second or so, Device Notifier pops 
up and displays the label of the disc. You can click the Device Notifier icon (a blue square with white 
arrows) to remove the notification message. The label representing the disk then displays in the Places 
panel of Dolphin, allowing you to access its data. When you are done, right-click the label in Places, and 
then click Eject. This automatically opens the CD tray so you can remove the media. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
125 
To access the data in Konqueror, type /media into the location bar and double-click the icon 
representing the label name (it should be a blue folder). 
If you insert a music CD and hover over its label in Device Notifier, you will see a screen similar to 
the one shown in Figure 5-15: 
 
 
Figure 5-15. Device Notifier provides the option to play a music CD. 
If you click the Play Audio square, Device Notifier launches the KsCD music player. If you click the 
round icon with an arrow (the Eject button), Device Notifier ejects the CD tray. The entry for the CD 
stays in Device Notifier until the CD is ejected; you can click the Device Notifier icon whenever you 
would like to access its menu. 
If you insert a video DVD and hover over its entry in Device Notifier, it indicates that multiple 
actions are available for the device. Click the entry and select the option to Open with Video Player 
(Dragon Player). 
■ Tip The Appendix contains descriptions of other software that can be used to play music or video. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
126 
Unfortunately, not all DVDs play “out of the box.” This is not a problem with PC-BSD but with the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that “criminalizes production and dissemination of 
technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures (commonly known as digital rights 
management or DRM) that control access to copyrighted works.”
2 This means that the PC-BSD and 
FreeBSD Projects are not allowed to distribute the software that is able to play DVD content that has 
been encrypted by the manufacturer. You will know that your DVD is encrypted if nothing happens 
when you press Play in a computer video player. 
Software capable of bypassing the encryption on DVDs does exist and is known as libdvdcss. Due to 
distribution restrictions, if you decide you want to install this software, you need to compile it yourself 
and assume any legal responsibility for doing so. Chapters 8–10 tell you everything you need to know 
about installing and compiling software. If you think that being denied computer access to DVDs that 
you purchased is unfair, consider speaking to your local political representative or join a digital 
advocacy group such as the EFF (http://www.eff.org). 
USB Devices 
To access data on a digital camera or on a USB thumb or hard drive, insert the USB device and wait a 
second or two until Device Notifier pops up with the label. You can then access the data in both Dolphin 
and Konqueror. When you’re finished, right-click the label name in Dolphin to safely Eject the media 
before removing it.  
Printing 
PC-BSD provides a Printer Configuration module that makes it easy to set up printing on your  
PC-BSD system. It does assume that you know how to physically connect your computer to a printing 
device or to a network and that you have already done so. Depending upon how you choose to connect 
to the printing device, you might have to perform some tasks before you configure your PC-BSD system 
to print. 
Consider how your computer connects to the printer device. 
• 
If your computer is physically cabled to the printer using a USB or printer cable, 
make sure the cable is plugged in and that the printer is turned on.  
• 
If another computer in your network is physically cabled to the printer, check that 
it has been configured to share its printer.  
• 
If you use a network printing device that is not physically cabled to any computer, 
you must first configure the network printing device using the manual that came 
with the device.

After you have verified your connection setup, you can use the PC-BSD Printer Configuration 
module to configure printing for any of these connection scenarios.  
Configuring a Printer 
After you have ensured that you are connected to the printer device either through a cable or a network 
connection, launch the Kickoff ➤ System Settings ➤ Printer Configuration module to install the printer 
on your PC-BSD system. After inputting the administrative password, you will see the initial Printer 
Configuration screen shown in Figure 5-16. 
 
 
Figure 5-16. Printer Configuration system module 
Before adding your printer, click Server Settings to see if the defaults are appropriate for your 
situation. This screen is seen in Figure 5-17.

The settings are 
Show printers shared by other systems: Check this box if the printer device is not 
physically cabled to your computer. 
Share published printers connected to this system: Check this box if you plan to 
share the printer that is physically cabled to your computer with other 
computers on your network. 
■ Tip If there are other computers on your network, don’t forget to check the Shared published printers box so 
other users on the network can print from the computer cabled to your PC-BSD system. 
Allow remote administration: By default, you can administer the printer (for 
example, view the print queue or stop and start the printer) only from this 
computer. This box should be selected only by advanced users who know how 
to secure remote administration connections. 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ PERFORMING COMMON TASKS 
 
129 
■ Caution For security reasons, it is not a good idea to check the box Allow printing from the Internet. Check this 
box only if you really know what you’re doing and have a good reason to do so. 
Allow users to cancel any job (not just their own): By default, users can cancel 
only their own print jobs. Check this box with caution, unless the users in your 
network play nicely together. Note that the administrative user always has 
permission to cancel anyone’s print job. 
Save debugging information for troubleshooting: Check this box if you have 
problems configuring your printer. 
 
After you check the boxes you want to use, click Apply to save your changes. 
If the printer is attached to another PC-BSD or Linux system that has already shared its printer using 
CUPS (Common Unix Printing System, http://www.cups.org), the connection is automatically created 
for you after you check the Show printers shared by other systems checkbox and click Apply. Figure 5-18 
shows an example; in this example, the printer is physically cabled to a Linux system with an IP address 
of 192.168.1.107.

■ Tip If the remote CUPS printer is not automatically found for you, double-check that a firewall is not blocking 
port 631. 
After the remote printer is found, you can highlight the remote printer and skip ahead to  
Figure 5-24. 
If the printer is physically cabled to your computer or is shared by a Windows system, click the New 
Printer ➤ New Network Printer icon to create your printer. Despite the name of the button, it can be 
used to create printers of any connection type, even those cabled to your computer. It will pause for a 
few seconds while it looks for printers attached to your system, and if you configured it to do so, any 
printers available on the network. When it is finished, a screen similar to the one in Figure 5-19 displays.

If You Share Your Printer 
If you checked the box to share your printer, your printer connection will be published to the other 
computers in your network. You need to double check that each computer is capable of printing a test 
page.  
If the other computer runs PC-BSD, Mac OS X, or Linux, open its web browser and type in the URL 
“localhost:631/printers”, as seen in Figure 5-25.

■ Note This assumes that the CUPS has been installed and is running on the Linux system; if it is not, refer to the 
documentation for your Linux system. CUPS starts automatically on PC-BSD systems. 
In this example, the printer running on computer 192.168.1.110 has been found. Click the Print Test 
Page button to verify that printing works over the network. 
If the computer runs Windows, you need to use the Add Printer Wizard on the Windows system. The 
easiest configuration uses IPP (for example, using the IPP Device URI seen in Figure 5-25). How to 
configure an IPP printer varies by the version of Windows. We recommend that you Google “IPP 
Windows” to find a how-to for your version of Windows.

user on another machine. Typically, you do this when another user shows you how to perform a task or 
helps you troubleshoot a problem with your system. 
Click Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ Internet ➤ Desktop Sharing to launch Krfb, KDE’s desktop-sharing 
application. Figure 5-26 provides an example of the invitation information you would give to the person 
with whom you wish to share your desktop. 
 
 
Figure 5-26. Creating a personal invitation in Krfb 
In this example, the Personal Invitation button has been clicked; it generates an invitation 
containing an IP address and port number, a unique password for the connection, and an expiration

help you with your computer. 
After you have created an invitation, it displays in the invitation menu with its creation and expire 
times. If you want to stop an invitation before it expires, highlight it and click Delete. 
■ Note Before your invitee can connect, you need to open the port number (in this case, TCP and UDP port 5900) 
listed in the invitation. See the “Firewall” section of Chapter 7 for instructions on how to open a firewall port.

After your invitee connects to your IP address and port number, a message similar to the one shown 
in Figure 5-27 displays on your desktop. 
 
 
Figure 5-27. Connection request in Krfb 
After confirming (by telephone, for example) the identity of the person trying to connect, decide 
whether or not you want the user to control your keyboard and mouse, and then click the Accept 
Connection button. After you do this, the other person is prompted to input the invitation password. 
After the password is accepted, the user can see your desktop and you can watch as she moves your 
mouse and interacts with your desktop. After she is finished assisting you, she can close the VNC session. 
■ Tip After a session is closed, the user cannot connect again unless you send another invitation. Don’t forget to 
remove the firewall rule for the VNC port and restart your firewall when you are finished! 
Summary 
This chapter introduced you to some of the software available on and for your PC-BSD system. It also 
showed you how to deal with encrypted and compressed files, the Clipboard, and accessing data on 
removable media. 
In Chapter 6, you will learn how to configure the system to best suit your needs by starting with the 
system settings that are accessible to your user account.

User System Settings 
By now, you are probably comfortable enough with your PC-BSD system to start looking under the hood 
at some of your system’s settings. Chapters 6 and 7 will introduce you to the System Settings utility and 
walk you through its configuration modules. These modules allow you to configure every aspect of your 
PC-BSD system’s behavior.  
Chapter 6 will concentrate on the general settings any user is allowed to make. Chapter 7 will 
concentrate on the more advanced settings that are usually performed by the superuser. It should be 
noted that most of the settings found in the Systems Settings utility apply to other operating systems 
running KDE4. We will let you know as we come across the configuration modules that are specific to 
PC-BSD. 
System Settings can be launched from Kickoff ➤ Computer ➤ System Settings, or by typing 
systemsettings & in a command prompt. 
Figure 6-1 shows the System Settings menu on a PC-BSD system. 
 
 
Figure 6-1. System Settings menu 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
140 
■ Note The order of the icons in the System Settings menu may vary depending upon your language settings, but 
the functionality will be the same. 
The System Settings menu is divided into sections, with each section containing icons representing 
a configurable module. This chapter will discuss the modules in the Look & Feel, Personal, and 
Computer Administration sections. Chapter 6 will discuss the Network & Connectivity section as well as 
the sections found in the Advanced tab. 
■ Tip Power users can launch individual modules from the command line. Type kcmshell4 --list to see the list of 
modules with brief descriptions; then type kcmshell4 name_of_module to launch the specified module’s menu. 
Look and Feel 
The modules in this section allow you to change the appearance of your KDE4 desktop. 
Appearance  
Figure 6-2 shows the configuration screen you receive when you double-click the Appearance module.

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
141 
■ Tip Once you’ve entered a configuration module’s menu, click the Overview button in the top-left corner if you 
want to go back to the main System Settings menu. 
You can spend a fair bit of time previewing and trying out the various Appearance options. We’ll 
provide a brief overview of each to get you started: 
Style: A widget style controls the color and look of components such as  
tabs, radio buttons, check boxes, and status bars. Several widget styles are 
installed for you. If you select one from the drop-down menu, you’ll see its 
effect in the Preview pane. If you don’t like the new look after clicking Apply,  
try another style. 
Colors: Several color schemes are installed for you, and you can watch their 
Preview as you go through the menu of choices. The Get New Schemes button 
will connect you to the Color Schemes section of www.kde-look.org so you can 
browse for additional schemes. The rest of the tabs in this section allow you to 
fine-tune the selected color scheme. 
Icons: Several themes control the look of icons that have already been installed 
for you. A preview of each theme is shown above the selection menu. You also 
have the option to Get New Themes from the Icon Themes section of www.kde-
look.org. Use the Advanced tab to control the size of the icons and to configure 
their effect and transparency. 
Fonts: These font settings apply to every application you launch in KDE. You 
can set different fonts and sizes for toolbars, menus, window titles, taskbars, 
and desktops as well as configure your anti-alias settings. If you click Adjust All 
Fonts, it will apply the same font to all settings. If you don’t like that, click Reset. 
If you really mess up your font selections, click Defaults to return to the original 
KDE settings.  
Windows: Several window decoration themes are available for preview. You 
can also decide whether to show window button tooltips (the description you 
see when you hover over a button in a window’s title) and adjust the location of 
the buttons on a window’s title bar. Note that these settings apply to all 
windows. To apply to an individual window, see the Configuring Windows 
section in Chapter 3. 
Splash Screen: When KDE starts, you see several icons bouncing in the middle 
of your desktop as it loads. This screen allows you to change that theme, as well 
as Get New Themes from the Splashscreens section of kde-look.org. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
142 
GTK Styles and Fonts: When graphical applications are created, they use 
something known as a widget toolkit to control the look of the window and its 
buttons. KDE4 applications use the QT toolkit, but many applications, such as 
Firefox and GIMP, use the GTK toolkit. If you find that some application 
windows look “ugly,” see whether they look better to you after selecting another 
style from the drop-down menu. You can also install the Firefox and 
Thunderbird scrollbar fix in this menu. 
Emoticons: Many applications, such as instant messaging and Skype, support 
emoticons. This menu allows you to configure and get new emoticon themes 
from the Emoticons section of kde-look.org. 
Desktop  
This module allows you to configure desktop effects, multiple virtual desktops, screen edge actions, 
screen savers, and launch feedback. Figure 6-3 shows the Desktop settings module. 
 
 
Figure 6-3. Desktop settings module 
Following is an overview of the configuration options available in each of the icons in the left panel: 
Desktop Effects: These were discussed in detail in Chapter 3. 
Multiple Desktops: By default, four virtual desktops are created for you. This 
menu allows you to change and rename the number of virtual desktops. 
Accessing your virtual desktops is discussed in Chapter 3. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
143 
Screen Edges: This configuration screen allows you to enable active screen 
edges. Once activated, your screen edges will support actions such as switching 
between virtual desktops by hovering your mouse near the edge of your screen.  
Screen Saver: Use this menu to select, configure, and test your screensaver. 
There are dozens of built-in screensavers that have been sorted into categories. 
You can choose to start the screensaver after a specified period of inactivity and 
to require a password to stop the screensaver. Advanced Options allow you to 
configure the screen to lock when you hover your mouse over a specified screen 
corner. Additional screen savers are available from the Screensaver section of 
kde-look.org.  
Launch Feedback: This screen allows you to configure the cursor that appears 
while an application is launching. You can also configure the timeout before 
being notified that an application is taking too long to launch. 
■ Tip You can disable the launch feedback cursor for a specific application in Menu Editor in the General tab of 
the application. Menu Editor is discussed in detail in Chapter 4. 
Notifications  
Figure 6-4 shows a screenshot of the Notifications module. 
 
 
Figure 6-4. Notifications module menu 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
144 
In the Applications tab, the Event source provides a drop-down menu to select the specific 
application to configure. Once selected, the configurable actions for that application are displayed in the 
State window of the screen. Select a state to configure which notification you would like to receive. For 
example, if you select PowerDevil ➤ AC adaptor plugged in, you’ll see that the default notification is to 
play the KDE-Sys-App-Positive.ogg file and to show an informational popup message. Click the arrow 
icon next to Play a sound to hear the sound or click the browse icon to select a different sound. You can 
also configure the system to speak a default or customized message.  
■ Note Speech-to-Text must be configured before the system can speak the message. See the Accessibility 
section later on in this chapter for instructions on how to enable and configure this feature. 
The System Bell section allows you to use the system bell instead of system notification. If you check 
this option, you can then set the volume, pitch, and duration of the bell. 
Window Behavior  
This module provides another view of the settings discussed in detail in the Windows Actions section of 
Chapter 3. Figure 6-5 shows the layout of this configuration module.

Personal 
This section of System Settings contains modules to configure your personal, accessibility, and language 
preferences. These settings apply only to your user account, meaning that users sharing the same system 
can use different personal settings. 
About Me  
Figure 6-6 provides a screenshot of this module. 
 
 
Figure 6-6. About Me module 
The Password & User Account section allows you to associate an image with your name that will 
show in the login screen after you use the Leave button to log out or switch user accounts. You can 
browse for an image that KDE will automatically scale for you. This configuration section also allows you 
to change your password; it will prompt you for your current password first. 
The information you provide in the User Information section is used by some programs, such as the 
default user created by KMail.  
Have you ever noticed that bullets appear when you type your password into the login screen? Use 
the At Password Prompt option to configure KDE to show one, three, or no bullets for each character in 
your password. 
The Paths menu is shown in Figure 6-7. You can change the default location that applications search 
through when looking for specific types of files. Any paths you change should remain somewhere within 
your home directory.

Accessibility  
KDE4 provides many configuration options to ease the computing experience for disabled users. The 
KDE Accessibility Project (http://accessibility.kde.org/) provides a good overview of KDE’s 
accessibility features as well as additional resources. 
Figure 6-8 shows the configuration menu for the Accessibility module.  
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
147 
 
Figure 6-8. Accessibility module 
The tabs in the Accessibility panel allow you to configure the following: 
Bell: If you have difficulty hearing the system bell, use a customized bell that 
contains the path to a sound to play. Deaf users can configure a visible bell that 
will either invert or flash the screen. These settings will apply to any configured 
Notifications, as discussed earlier in this chapter. 
Modifier Keys: This menu allows you to enable sticky keys. This is useful if you 
have problems holding down a modifier key (such as Ctrl, Alt, or Shift). Once 
sticky keys are enabled, you can let go of the modifier key and it will remain 
active until you press another key. For example, you can start KRunner by 
clicking Alt, letting go, and then pressing F2 instead of having to press Alt+F2 
simultaneously. This tab also allows you to activate a bell whenever a locking 
key (Caps Lock, NumLock, or Scroll Lock) is toggled on or off. 
Keyboard Filters: This tab allows you to activate and configure slow and 
bounce keys to assist users with limited hand mobility. Slow keys tell the 
computer to ignore unintended keystrokes because there is a configured time 
delay before a keystroke is accepted. Bounce keys tell the computer to ignore 
repeated keystrokes within a set time frame. 
Activation Gestures: This tab allows disabled and nondisabled users to share 
the keyboard during the same session. Sticky and slow keys can be turned off 
after a period of inactivity, and notifications can be configured for when an 
accessibility feature is turned on or off.

The Text-to-Speech module contains the following tabs:  
■ Tip The KTTS Handbook provides a detailed overview of using the text-to-speech subsystem and is available 
from http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeaccessibility/kttsd/index.html. 
General: By default, text-to-speech is disabled. Checking the box to Enable 
Text-to-Speech System will start the KTTSD service for you.  
Talkers: Click the Add button to configure the language and synthesizer used 
by the text-to-speech talker. When selecting the Synthesizer, select either 
Festival Interactive or Festival Lite because FreeTTS is currently not supported. 
While Festival Lite supports only one voice, the Festival talker supports several 
voices.  
 
Figure 6-9 shows the Select voice menu for the Festival synthesizer. Once you select a voice, click 
Test to see whether you like the sound of the voice.

■ Note The KMouth Handbook at http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdeaccessibility/kmouth/index.html 
contains detailed instructions for configuring and using Kmouth. 
Filters: Filters are advanced features that allow you to preprocess the text 
before it is spoken. The Filters section of the KTTS Handbook provides 
examples for creating your own filters. 
Interruption: This tab allows you to set a message or sound to be played before 
and after interruptions (when a spoken warning interrupts the text being 
spoken, for example). 
Audio: This tab allows you to set a location to store audio files. This means that 
KDE will store any text read by the text-to-speech reader as an audio file, 
allowing you to replay it again. Files will have names like kttsd-J-SS, where J is 
the job number and SS is the sentence number.  
■ Caution Audio files can take up a lot of disk space, so take the time to periodically remove the files you don’t 
use. Uncheck the Keep audio files box in the Audio tab to stop file creation. 
Jobs: As seen in Figure 6-10, this screen can be used to speak the contents of 
the Clipboard or a text file. Buttons are provided to navigate to the previous or 
next sentence. When speaking, the contents of the text being spoken will be 
displayed in the Current Sentence panel.

Time & Dates: Here you can select the calendar system, time and date formats, 
and first day of the week. 
Other: Use this tab to select your paper format setting and the metric or 
imperial measuring system. 
The Keyboard Layout section provides tabs allowing you to configure the following: 
Layout: Your current keyboard layout was selected during the PC-BSD install. If 
you want to change it, click the Enable keyboard layouts button to select a 
different keyboard model or layout. 
■ Tip The Kxkb Handbook at http://docs.kde.org/kde3/en/kdebase/kxkb/index.html contains more 
information and examples about the Keyboard Layout tabs. The Enable keyboard layouts button needs to be 
enabled to activate the Switching Options and Advanced tabs. 
Switching Options: By default, the selected layout applies to all applications 
(Global). Use this tab if you want to configure the keyboard layout to affect only 
the current desktop, application, or window. You can also configure shortcuts 
for switching between layouts. 
■ Tip KDE will not let you change some shortcuts, such as Ctrl-Shift and Alt-Shift. If you receive an error 
indicating that your shortcut is not supported by Qt, select another shortcut. 
Advanced: This tab contains hundreds of keyboard behavior options sorted 
into categories. Spend some time browsing the options to see whether any 
interest you. 
 
The Spell Checker section allows you to set the default language for editors that use spellcheck. It 
also provides options to skip uppercase and run-together words. To use spellcheck in an editor, select 
Spelling from its Tools menu. 
Computer Administration  
This section contains modules that allow you to configure items such as the date and time, your display 
and fonts, keyboard and mouse actions, and multimedia. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
153 
■ Note Most of the settings in this section can be modified using your regular user account. However, some 
settings, such as changing the system time, require you to input the administrative password.  
Date and Time  
A screenshot of this module is seen in Figure 6-13. The default settings were selected during the PC-BSD 
install. 
 
 
Figure 6-13. Time and Date module showing Toronto as the current local time zone 
If you check Set date and time automatically, your system will automatically adjust itself by syncing 
with a network time protocol (NTP) server on the Internet. You can select which server to use from the 
NTP server drop-down menu just above the clock.  
Use the single forward and back arrows to scroll through the months in the selected year’s calendar, 
and use the double arrows to scroll through previous and upcoming years. In the clock area, use the up 
and down arrows or your mouse scroll to change the hour, minute, and seconds; or type in the desired 
value. 
Local time zones are listed alphabetically. You can scroll through the list to pick the city closest to 
your geographic area.

Display  
Figure 6-14 shows a screenshot of the Display module. The Size and Orientation settings will vary 
according to the features provided by your video card driver. 
 
 
Figure 6-14. The Display module 
This module allows you to configure the following: 
Size & Orientation: This tab allows you to change the display size (currently 
shown as 1024x768), the refresh rate, and the orientation.  
Power Control: If your laptop display or monitor supports it (most modern 
hardware does), you can check the Enable display power management check 
box and set the standby, suspend, and power off times. 
Gamma: This tab provides sliders for red, green, and blue settings so you can 
calibrate your monitor’s contrast and brightness settings. 
■ Caution Don’t calibrate your monitor unless you know what you are doing. 
Multiple Monitors: If your system has multiple video cards connected to 
multiple monitors, you can use this tab to configure KDE to spread your 
desktop across all of the monitors.

■ Tip The site www.dualmonitorbackgrounds.com/ has a large selection of wallpaper designed for dual 
monitors. To save a wallpaper, right-click its image and select Save Image As from the menu. Chapter 3 contains 
instructions for changing your desktop wallpaper. 
Font Installer  
This module allows you to preview, configure, and add fonts. Figure 6-15 shows a screenshot of this 
module. This system currently has 40 fonts installed. 
 
 
Figure 6-15. Font Installer configuration module 
Expand the arrow next to a font’s name to view which fonts are installed—such as bold, italic, or 
regular. Right-click any font and you will have an option to delete, print, or open it in the font viewer 
application. If you purchase or download a font from the Internet, use the Add button to browse to the 
path in which you saved the font. 
Input Actions 
This module makes it easy for you to configure several useful responses to keyboard input. Figure 6-16 
shows the initial Input Actions menu. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
156 
 
Figure 6-16. Input Actions module 
This menu will change if you select an option in the left panel. Click the Settings button to return to 
the original menu. If you check the Gestures check box, you can associate mouse movements with 
actions. 
Spend some time expanding each category to see which options it provides. If you click an action, 
the comment will provide a brief description. Depending upon the option, it may also provide a trigger 
tab where you can configure a keyboard shortcut and/or an action tab where you can launch a 
command or fine-tune the action.  
An example of a useful Input Action is found under Preset Actions ➤ PrintScreen. The comment 
indicates that this action launches KSnapShot when the PrintScrn key is pressed. You could change the 
application that launches using this action’s Action tab. 
The Edit button ➤ New menu allows you to define your own global shortcuts, window actions, and 
mouse gesture actions. You can also group the actions you create into their own category (for example, 
MyShortcuts) using Edit ➤ New Group. You can save all your Input Actions to a file using Edit ➤ Export. 
You can restore your saved settings to another system or after a new installation using Edit ➤ Import and 
specifying the path to the file you saved. 
Use the Reset button if you decide you want to return your system to the default Input Actions 
settings. 
■ Caution Reset will delete any actions or groups you have created. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS

Keyboard & Mouse 
This module allows you to configure keyboard and mouse behavior as well as keyboard shortcuts. Figure 
6-17 provides a screenshot of this module. 
 
 
Figure 6-17. Keyboard & Mouse configuration module 
This module provides tabs to configure the following: 
Keyboard: If you tend to make mistakes as you type, you’ll want to enable 
keyboard repeat. If you don’t, you will have to press Backspace for every 
character you want to redo. You might have to experiment with the delay (not 
too slow) and the rate (not too fast) to find a speed that works for you when you 
hold down Backspace. If your keyboard has a NumLock section and you use it 
often, configure KDE to activate these keys for you. If you like to hear yourself 
type, adjust the key click volume. 
Mouse: This menu allows you to specify right- or left-handed button order, 
reverse scroll direction, and specify whether a single or a double click opens 
files and folders. You can also preview and install mouse cursor themes, set 
various intervals, and configure the NumPad keys to act as a mouse. 
■ Tip A useful setting for laptops with touchpads is to lower pointer acceleration to about 1.5 and pointer 
threshold to 0 in the Advanced tab of the Mouse panel. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ USER SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
158 
Standard Keyboard Shortcuts: Allows you to view and customize default 
shortcut keys. In Figure 6-18, the Add Bookmark action has been selected. It 
shows that this action is currently using the default shortcut of Ctrl-B. If you 
select Custom, click the None button, which will change to Input. Press the keys 
you want to use for the shortcut, and the Input word will change to show your 
new shortcut. 
 
 
Figure 6-18. Changing a default keyboard shortcut in the Keyboard & Mouse configuration 
module 
Global Keyboard Shortcuts: This section allows you to view and change the 
default shortcuts for specific applications. Click the KDE component scroll-
down menu to select the application to configure. The File drop-down menu 
lets you select from additional component schemes, set all shortcuts in this 
section to none, and remove a component from this menu. A filter bar is 
included if you know which action you want to configure for the selected 
component.  
Figure 6-19 provides a screenshot showing KWin as the currently selected 
component. You might want to spend some time browsing the actions available 
for each component to see whether any shortcuts would be useful to you.

Multimedia  
This module allows you to view the sound card and backend driver being used by the multimedia 
subsystem. If you have multiple sound cards, you can specify their order for each category. For example, 
you can configure the card attached to your speakers for Video and another card attached to your 
headphones for Communication. Otherwise, these settings should “just work” and are typically left as-is.  
Figure 6-20 shows that this PC-BSD system uses an Intel 82801AA AC’97 (snd_ich) sound card.  
■ Tip On PC-BSD (and FreeBSD systems), sound card drivers start with snd_, and the man page for the driver 
name will tell you the type of sound card and the driver’s capabilities. In the previous example, I could type man 
snd_ich in Konsole or man:/snd_ich in Dolphin’s navigation bar or Konqueror.

You can test your sound device by highlighting it and clicking the Test button. If you click the Apply 
Device List To... button, you can see which categories the device is applied to without having to click 
each category individually in the left pane. 
The backend tab is seen in Figure 6-21. The KDE4 multimedia network is known as Phonon and it 
depends on a backend engine to play various audio and video formats. PC-BSD installs the Xine backend 
engine for you. If you are curious about interlacing, its Wikipedia entry

Administrative System Settings 
Chapter 6 concentrated on system configuration settings available to any user. This chapter focuses on 
the system settings usually performed by the administrative user. Many of these configuration modules 
will prompt you for the superuser password.  
We’ll start by finishing up System Settings’ General tab by discussing the modules in the Network & 
Connectivity section, as well as the remaining modules in the Computer Administration section. We’ll 
then move on to the sections in the Advanced tab of System Settings. 
Network and Connectivity 
The modules in this section allow you to configure the built-in firewall, various network settings, 
connections to Windows shares, and your network interfaces. 
Firewall  
This module is specific to PC-BSD and is used to configure the pf
1 firewall. It requires administrative 
access. Figure 7-1 shows the Firewall configuration module. 
■ Caution A firewall affects the security of your operating system. If you are not familiar with TCP/IP ports or 
firewall rules, you should leave your firewall settings as-is. If you want to practice creating firewall rules in order to 
learn more about firewalls, use a test system that does not contain any of your data. 
                                                 
 
1 pf is unique to BSD operating systems. See the pf Guide (http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/) if you want to learn 
more about this firewall. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
164 
 
Figure 7-1. Firewall configuration module 
The General configuration screen allows the firewall to be enabled or disabled at system startup. 
You can tell that the firewall is currently running on this system because the Start button is greyed out. If 
the firewall was not running, the Stop and Restart buttons would be greyed out. If you ever mess up your 
firewall configuration, click the Restore default configuration button to return to the original working 
configuration. If you make a change to your firewall settings, don’t forget to click Restart (or Start) for 
your changes to take effect. 
Figure 7-2 shows the screen for the Exceptions tab.  
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
165 
 
Figure 7-2. Firewall rules in Exceptions tab of Firewall configuration module 
The Exceptions tab provides a graphical interface for viewing, adding, modifying, and deleting 
firewall rules. Each rule (or exception) contains the following information: 
Service: The name of the application affected by the firewall rule. 
Port: The TCP/IP port associated with that service. The file /etc/services 
contains a list of common applications and their default port. 
Policy: Whether that application is allowed to pass through or is blocked by the 
firewall. 
Interface: The BSD name of the network interface. 
Users already familiar with pf can view the underlying configuration file, /etc/pf.conf using Konsole. 
Figure 7-3 shows that configuration file from the same system. It should be noted that /etc/pf.conf 
shows all the underlying firewall rules. The default rules support network address translation (NAT
2), 
allow you to access the Internet and run the ping and traceroute utilities, and accept NetBIOS packets on 
the interface attached to the internal network.

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
166 
■ Tip The default Exceptions show that the NetBIOS ports are open, allowing your computer to share files over a 
Windows or Samba network. Samba is discussed later in this chapter. 
 
Figure 7-3. /etc/pf.conf configuration file showing the same firewall rules 
Power users can change their firewall rules using either the graphical Firewall module or by editing 
/etc/pf.conf directly.  
Figure 7-4 shows the menu that appears if you click Add entry in the Exceptions tab. In this example, 
a firewall rule is being added to allow for incoming Doom connections over TCP port 666 on the em0 
network interface. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
167 
 
Figure 7-4. Adding a firewall rule to allow incoming Doom connections 
When creating a rule, use the drop-down Service menu to select an application by name. You can 
choose to either allow or block connections over the port. Protocol choices are TCP or UDP, and the 
drop-down Interface menu will allow you to select from the interfaces installed on the system. Once you 
press Ok, the rule will be added and will show in /etc/pf.conf.  
■ Note While the new firewall rules will appear, they won’t be used until you restart the firewall.  
Network Settings  
Figure 7-5 shows the Network Settings configuration module. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
168 
 
Figure 7-5. Network Settings configuration module 
■ Caution The menus in this module are for advanced users. Don’t change them unless you have good reason to 
and you have researched your changes. 
The menus within this module allow you to configure the following: 
Proxy: If you need to go through a proxy to access the Internet, your service 
provider or network administrator will tell you which proxy settings you need to 
use. If you’re curious, the Proxies document from 
http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdebase-runtime/kcontrol/proxy/index.html 
gives an overview of each proxy setting. 
Connection Preferences: This menu allows you to change network timeout 
values and enable useful FTP options. It is rare that you would change the 
default values and you should leave them as-is unless you really know what you 
are doing. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
169 
Service Discovery: Service discovery is also known as zeroconf
3 and is designed 
to let a computer configure itself for networking with no user intervention. KDE 
uses Avahi to provide service discovery. It will search the local domain to see 
which resources are available. This screen allows you to add additional service 
discovery domains.  
Sharing  
Figure 7-6 shows the Sharing configuration module which is used to set the default username and 
password for Windows shares. This allows you to browse Windows network shares using Konqueror 
without being prompted for the share username and password. 
 
 
Figure 7-6. Sharing configuration module 
System Network Configuration 
The System Network Configuration module is provided by PC-BSD and understands BSD network 
interface settings. You will need administrative access to change any of the settings in this module.  
                                                 
 
3 Wikipedia provides a good introduction to zeroconf (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroconf). 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
170 
■ Tip Your PC-BSD network settings should “just work.” For example, if you plug in an Ethernet cable or insert an 
external wireless card, its network settings should be automatically configured for you. Should you have a problem 
with a network interface, you can use this module to configure the interface manually. 
Figure 7-7 shows a screenshot of this module. This system contains a RealTek Ethernet card (rl0), a 
firewire (fwip0) interface, a wireless card (wlan0), and the loopback interface (lo0). The IP address for the 
highlighted wireless interface is 10.13.0.13. 
 
 
Figure 7-7. System Network Configuration module showing an Ethernet, firewire, wireless, and loopback 
interface 
■ Tip BSD Ethernet device names differ from Linux. On BSD systems, the interface name is associated with its 
driver; on Linux systems, Ethernet drivers always start with eth. To read the details of a driver, look at the man 
page for the interface name (without the number). In this example, I could type man:/rl into Konqueror to learn 
more about the RealTek driver. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
171 
The Devices tab allows the administrator to view and configure the network interfaces. If you 
highlight an Ethernet, firewire, or loopback interface and click Configure, you have the option of 
obtaining the IP address automatically using DHCP or manually typing in the IP address and subnet 
mask. 
If you highlight a wireless interface and click Configure, in addition to the options mentioned for the 
other interfaces, you have the ability to add, edit, and remove wireless network profiles. The Wireless 
configuration menu is shown in Figure 7-8. 
■ Tip A quick way to access an interface’s configuration is to highlight it and check the Display system tray icon. 
Once in the system tray, you can double-click the icon to open the System Network Configuration module. Hover 
over the icon to get a summary of the interface’s current settings. 
 
Figure 7-8. Configuring a network interface 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
172 
If you click the +Add button, you have the option to scan for available wireless networks. You can 
also choose the appropriate security setting of disabled, WEP, WPA personal, or WPA enterprise
4. Click 
the Configure button in the Network Security section to type in the key required by the wireless network. 
Back to the main menu, the Network Configuration (Advanced) tab will show the DNS server and 
hostname received from a DHCP server. If you are manually configuring the interface, click the Change 
Configuration button so that you can enter the DNS servers, hostname, and default gateway settings. If 
you use PPPoE to connect to the Internet, you can configure the username and password you use to 
connect, as well as select the network interface from a drop down menu. PPPOE also provides check 
boxes to configure an always-on connection and Internet connection sharing. 
Computer Administration 
Chapter 6 covered most of the modules in this section. We finish this section by describing the 
remaining modules. 
Password & User Account 
This module allows the superuser to easily add and remove users, configure who has administrative 
access, and change the administrative password or the password of the selected user. Figure 7-9 
provides a screenshot of this module. 
 
 
Figure 7-9. Password & User Account module 
                                                 
 
4 These settings are needed if security has been configured on the wireless router. Ask your Internet provider or the 
person who set up the wireless configuration settings if you cannot connect to the wireless network. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
173 
In this example, the only regular user account on this system is “dru” and this user has superuser 
access because the Can administrate system check box is checked. The Change Password button can be 
used to reset the user’s password. Because this utility is run as the superuser, you don’t have to know the 
user’s old password in order to change it. 
The Change Admin Password can be used to reset the superuser password. 
The Advanced View button allows you to view and modify all the user accounts and groups on the 
system. Figure 7-10 provides a screenshot with the dru user account selected. 
 
 
Figure 7-10. The Users tab of the Advanced View of Password & User Account system settings module 
This advanced view allows you to change the user’s Full Name, Home Directory, default shell, and 
primary group. 
■ Caution Even the superuser shouldn’t change the settings for the system user accounts unless there is a good 
reason to do so. System user accounts are all the accounts needed by the operating system and are created for 
you. In this example, it is every account except for the dru account. 
The Groups tab allows you to easily create (add) new groups and add or remove members from 
groups. Again, be cautious about changing the settings for system groups—it is recommended that you 
modify only the settings for the groups that you have created. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
174 
Printer Configuration 
This module is used to configure printing on your PC-BSD system. It supports printers that are 
physically cabled to the system, connecting to print shares over the network, and printing to a network 
printer. Using this module to set up printing is discussed in detail in Chapter 5. 
Services Manager 
This module requires the superuser password and is unique to PC-BSD. It allows the administrator to 
control the startup settings of PC-BSD services and to stop or start these services. Figure 7-11 provides a 
screenshot of this module.  
 
 
Figure 7-11. Services Manager configuration module 
■ Tip Later in this chapter, we will discuss Service Manager, which is provided by KDE and shows KDE services.  

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
175 
Each entry in this menu shows the following: 
Service Name: The name of the service. 
Running: Whether the service is currently running or stopped.  
AutoStart: Indicates whether the service is set to start automatically when the 
system boots up. Use the Enable Startup or Disable Startup buttons to change 
the current setting. 
Description: A brief description of what the service does. 
■ Tip Don’t change the startup setting for a service unless you understand what the service does. 
If you highlight a service, the appropriate buttons will activate. For example, if a service is currently 
running, the Stop and Restart buttons will activate. If a service is currently set to start at boot time, the 
Disable Startup button will activate. 
Software & Updates 
This module is unique to PC-BSD and requires superuser privileges to access. Figure 7-12 shows a 
screenshot of this module. 
 
 
Figure 7-12. Software & Updates module 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
176 
How to use this module to install software and to keep your installed applications and operating 
system up-to-date is described in detail in Chapter 8. 
System Manager 
The System Manager module is unique to PC-BSD and requires the administrative password. Figure 7-
13 provides a screenshot of this module. 
 
 
Figure 7-13. System Manager configuration module 
The General tab can be used to view the version of PC-BSD, the version of FreeBSD it is based upon, 
the system’s CPU type and frequency, and the amount of installed memory. The Generate button allows 
you to create a diagnostic report and will prompt you for the name and location of the file to generate. 
This allows you to easily send a file of diagnostic information to a mailing list or another user who is 
helping you to troubleshoot your system. 
The Kernel tab, seen in Figure 7-14, allows you to enable ATAPI DMA mode. This mode is off by 
default as it can cause hardware on some systems to hang. If you feel that the transfer mode on your disk 
drives is less than optimal, you can try checking this box to see whether it makes a difference. If it results 
in system freezes, go back and uncheck the box. You can also reduce the boot delay in this tab. Boot 
delay is how long the system waits for you to select an option from the boot menu you see when the 
system starts up; it is set to 10 seconds by default. It’s probably not a good idea to set a value lower than 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
177 
3 seconds to give you time to select another boot option;
5 for example, if you ever need to go into single-
user mode to repair your system. Finally, the Kernel tab allows a power user who has compiled and 
installed another kernel

Figure 7-15. Task tab of System Manager configuration module 
This tab is divided into two sections. The Ports Console section allows you to fetch the ports tree 
into Ports Console. (Ports Console and the Ports Tree are discussed in detail in Chapters 9 and 10.) The 
System Tasks section allows advanced users to fetch system source and the system ports tree; it is 
discussed in Chapter 14. 
The Misc tab allows you to configure the language used in the system boot screen. The custom 
button allows you to select a custom image to display at boot time. This image will appear as the kernel 
starts to load and will hide the boot messages (you can press any key to leave the image and view the 
boot messages). The image must be in .pcx format; you can use the GIMP or KolourPaint applications to 
create pcx files. 
■ Note .pcx images are not graphic intensive. If you receive an error about the size or color depth of the image 
when you try to add it using the Custom button, that image will not load at boot time. 
Advanced User Settings 
As the name suggests, the modules in the Advanced tab of the System Settings module tend to require 
more configuration knowledge and most require administrative access in order to make configuration 
changes. The Advanced User Settings section contains over a dozen modules dealing with various 
system services and hardware.

Akonadi Configuration 
In KDE, Akonadi is the storage architecture behind the Kontact
7 Personal Information Management 
(PIM) application. A PIM application can be used to manage information such as your calendar, events, 
address book, and bookmarks. Figure 7-16 shows the menu for this configuration module. In this 
example, the Add button was selected. 
 
 
Figure 7-16. Akonadi configuration module 
Akonadi can store personal information from a variety of sources, and this menu is used to add and 
configure these resources. Unfortunately, the documentation on Akonadi is still a work in progress,
8 so 
you might have to resort to trial and error and asking questions within the KDE community. Chapter 11 
describes in more detail how to get help when you are having trouble figuring something out. 
The Akonadi Server Configuration tab will show the database settings. Akonadi uses the MySQL 
database application to store your personal information and preconfigures the database for you. You 
should leave these settings as-is. However, you might find the Test, Stop, and Restart buttons useful if 
you are having problems with the MySQL database. 
                                                 
 
7 See the Kontact User Guide http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdepim/kontact/index.html for more 
information on how to configure and use Kontact. 
8 Start your research at http://pim.kde.org. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
180 
■ Tip If you don’t use Kontact, you can reduce startup time by disabling the Akonadi service by unchecking 
Contacts in KRunner ➤ Plugins. 
Audio CDs 
Figure 7-17 shows the Audio CDs configuration module that is used to set the default settings used by 
applications that play audio CDs. You can override most of these settings in the configuration menus 
provided by a specific CD player application. It should be noted that your audio settings should “just 
work” as-is; this module is for audiophiles who want to tweak their settings. 
 
 
Figure 7-17. The Audio CD configuration module 
The tabs in this module allow you to configure the following: 
General: Specifies the device name of the CD player, whether or not to use 
error correction and to skip on errors, and the encoder priority used when 
ripping CD tracks. 
Names: The track and album information that is displayed by the CD player is 
set in this tab. The default is to show the track artist, track number, and song 
title for each track and the album artist followed by the album title for each 
album. This information is gathered using CDDB, which is discussed later on in 
this chapter. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
181 
MP3 Encoder: Various settings for encoding MP3 files can be set here. A good 
introduction to understanding the terminology used in these settings is at 
http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/10/the-audiofile-understanding-
mp3-compression.ars. 
Ogg Vorbis Encoder: Wikipedia has a good introduction to some of the terms 
used in this tab: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_vorbis. 
Autostart 
KDE allows you to specify which scripts are executed when KDE starts up. PC-BSD comes preconfigured 
with scripts in the Autostart module that set up your system’s network interfaces, check that sound is 
working correctly, and check that the system is up-to-date. Figure 7-18 shows the Autostart 
configuration module. The computer in this example has an Ethernet (em0) network interface which is 
configured to be enabled at KDE startup. The drop-down menu for startstrigi.sh is selected to 
demonstrate that Script Files can be run at KDE startup, KDE shutdown, or before KDE starts up. 
 
 
Figure 7-18. Autostart configuration module showing PC-BSD specific scripts 
If you want your favorite programs, such as Firefox or Akregator, to start with KDE, click Add 
Program and select the program from the menu. Power users can also run their own custom scripts by 
clicking Add Script to browse to the script. The script will be added to the Script File section with its own 
drop down menu to select when the script will be run. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS

CDDB Retrieval 
The Compact Disc Database (CDDB
9) is an Internet database of track information for music CDs. Figure 
7-19 shows the CDDB Retrieval configuration module. CDDB is enabled by default, meaning that track 
information should be available in all your CD playing utilities. 
 
 
Figure 7-19. CDDB Retrieval configuration module 
Two popular databases of CDDB information are MusicBrainz (http://musicbrainz.org) and freedb 
(http://www.freedb.org). freedb supports both the HTTP and CDDB protocols; HTTP is a good default 
because it is allowed through most firewalls. If track information is not available for your favorite CD, 
and freedb is enabled, you can use the Submit tab to configure the e-mail address used to submit the 
track information to the database using a CDDB-aware application such as xmms. Instructions on how 
to submit can be found at the freedb FAQ (http://www.freedb.org/en/faq.3.html#21). 
                                                 
 
9 Wikipedia provides a good introduction to CDDB (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cddb).

Desktop Search 
The Desktop Search configuration module allows you to enable the Networked Environment for 
Personalized, Ontology-based Management of Unified Knowledge (Nepomuk) semantic desktop and the 
Strigi desktop search feature. Nepomuk allows you to tag, rate, and comment your files through Dolphin 
and to browse tagged files in Gwenview. Strigi
10 is a fast desktop search utility.  
The Basic Settings tab, seen in Figure 7-20, allows you to see whether the services are running and to 
enable them if they are not. 
 
 
Figure 7- 20. Desktop Search configuration module 
The Advanced Settings tab can be used to check off the directories you want Strigi to index for your 
searches. Your home directory will already be selected for you.  
Nepomuk is the backend that allows Comments and Tags to appear in the right frame of Dolphin. In 
Figure 7-21, the Downloads folder has been selected. The Add Comment link is no longer seen on the 
right because it has been replaced by a text box containing the comment. A tag of “stuff” was previously 
added, and the user has clicked Change Tags to open the Create New Tag menu. Note that tags also 
allow you to change the icon and to add a detailed description.

Strigi allows this user to type the word stuff in Dolphin’s Search bar and receive search results for 
both the comment and the tag. 
Desktop Theme Details 
Figure 7-22 shows the Desktop Theme Details configuration module. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
185 
 
Figure 7-22. Desktop Theme Details configuration module 
This configuration module allows you to fine-tune your theme settings by theme item. For example, 
the Color Scheme could be Air, while the Panel Background scheme could be Heron, and the Kickoff 
scheme could be Aya. You can get a preview of each scheme by clicking the drop-down menu above the 
Get New Theme button. The Get New Theme button provides easy access to the Plasma Themes section 
of kde-look.org. 
Check the More box if you want to remove a theme or save it to a file. If you don’t like your changes 
and want to return back to the defaults, click the Reset button. 
Device Actions 
KDE4 uses the Solid
11 hardware architecture to control access to hardware devices. Figure 7-23 shows the 
Device Actions module. This module is intended to be used by developers to set conditions to ensure 
that hardware is properly accessed by applications. Unless you are developing an application that 
requires access to hardware, you should leave the settings in this module as-is. 
 
                                                 
 
11 See http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Architecture/KDE4/Solid for a description of Solid. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
186 
 
Figure 7-23. The Device Actions configuration module 
If you highlight an action and click Edit, a menu will open where a developer can view the 
conditions that must be met in order for the selected action to be applied to the device. 
■ Caution Unless you are a developer familiar with the Solid architecture, you should leave the settings as-is. 
Documentation on Solid is still pretty sparse. The curious can learn more about this architecture at 
http://solid.kde.org. 
File Associations 
The File Associations module allows you to configure which applications are used to open files 
according to their file extension. Figure 7-24 shows this module with the image section expanded and 
the .bmp file type selected. In this example, Gwenview is the preferred application, followed by 
KolourPaint and Okular. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
187 
 
Figure 7-24. Viewing the .bmp file association in the File Associations configuration module 
Use the Add button if your favorite application, capable of opening the highlighted extension, is not 
listed. If you highlight an application, you can move it up or down in the Application Preference Order. 
You can also remove applications that you don’t want to associate with the specified file type. 
The Embedding tab can be used to set the default left-click action. You can select one of the 
following: 
• 
Show file in embedded viewer 
• 
Show file in separate viewer 
• 
Use settings for group (where group is the parent group for the file extension) 
• 
Ask whether to save to disk instead 
KDE Resources 
This configuration module allows you to set which locations, or resources, can be used as data sources 
for Contacts, Calendar, Notes, and Alarms. Figure 7-25 shows the possible resources for Calendar. This 
menu was accessed by selecting Calendar from the drop-down menu and clicking the Add button. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
188 
 
Figure 7-25. Adding a Calendar resource in KDE Resources configuration module 
In this example, possible data sources for the Default Address Book containing your personal 
Contacts include KDE’s Akonadi, OpenGroupware, Novell GroupWise, KMail, and OpenXchange. If you 
select a resource, it will attempt a connection to that type of server and will provide a resource settings 
configuration menu so you can select the correct location containing your contacts. You can have 
multiple resources, but only one can be selected as the Standard. 
Spend some time browsing the possible resources for each item—you might be surprised how many 
types of resources are supported! 
■ Note This module assumes that you already understand the possible configurations for the resources you 
select. For example, if you select the Novell Groupwise Server module, it will prompt you for the resource settings 
needed to successfully connect to an existing account on a Groupwise server. 
KDE Wallet 
KDE Wallet is a tool to store your passwords, web form data, and cookies in an encrypted format. The 
first time you enter private information into a KDE utility, it should ask you if you want to store it in your 
KDE wallet. The wallet itself is protected by a password so other users don’t have access to its contents. 
The KDE Wallet configuration module, seen in Figure 7-26, allows you to configure your wallet 
preferences. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
189 
 
Figure 7-26. KDE Wallet configuration module 
The Close Wallet section in the Wallet Preferences tab allows you to configure when the wallet 
closes. Note that once a wallet is closed, you need to input the wallet’s password to reopen it. 
The Automatic Wallet Selection allows you to select which of your wallets to use by default. You can 
store local passwords in a separate wallet from your Internet passwords. If you have never been 
prompted to make a KDE wallet, you can launch the wallet creation wizard by clicking New. You will be 
asked to choose a name for the wallet and then if you want to perform a basic setup (recommended) or 
advanced setup. Figure 7-27 shows the wizard screen after selecting the basic setup. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
190 
 
Figure 7-27. Using the create wallet wizard to set the password on a new wallet 
Once you enter a password and click Finish, the KDE Wallet Service will re-prompt you for the 
password and provide a strength meter for the password. After clicking Create, your new wallet will show 
in the Automatic Wallet Selection drop-down menu. 
The Wallet Manager allows you to view the information stored in your wallets. If you double-click a 
wallet within Wallet Manager, it will prompt you for the wallet password before displaying its contents. 
The Access Control tab within Wallet Manager allows you to view which applications have access to 
the wallet (the list will be empty until an application uses it). If you no longer want to have an 
application use the wallet, you can delete its access here. 
Service Manager 
The Service Manager configuration module, seen in Figure 7-28, allows you to view which KDE services 
are currently running and which are configured to start with KDE. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
191 
 
Figure 7-28. Service Manager configuration module 
If you uncheck a box in Startup Services, that service will no longer be started with KDE. It will, 
however, continue to run in your current KDE session until you highlight it and click Stop. If there are 
services that you know you don’t use, you can reduce KDE’s startup time by not starting those services. If 
you are unsure, you should leave the services as-is. If you mess up your configurations, press Defaults to 
return to the system defaults. 
■ Caution Don’t change the status of a service unless you understand what the service does. 
The Load-on-Demand services are automatically loaded whenever another application requires 
that service. This means that you can’t use this interface to stop or start the services in this section. 
■ Tip Power users can remove an unwanted Load-on-Demand service by editing the X-KDE-Kded-load-on-
demand=true line to =false in the appropriate *.desktop file. These files are located in /usr/local/kde4/share/ 
kde4/services/kded/. Make sure you understand the ramifications before editing a service's *.desktop file. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
192 
Session Manager 
The Session Manager module, seen in Figure 7-29, allows you to configure which icons appear in the 
Kickoff ➤ Leave menu. 
 
 
Figure 7-29. Session Manager configuration module 
If you don’t like receiving the extra 30 seconds confirmation dialog when you click one of the 
options in the Leave menu, uncheck the Confirm logout box. If you uncheck the Offer shutdown options 
box, the Restart and Shutdown options will be removed from the Leave menu. This can be useful if you 
share your computer with others and don’t want them to have access to those options. You can still 
safely restart or shut down the system manually by typing restart or halt at the command line or by 
changing the Default Leave Option to Turn off computer or Restart computer. 
If you have applications running when you leave a session, the On Login section determines 
whether they are restored when you start your next session. If you select Restore manually saved session, 
a Save Session option will be added to the Leave menu, allowing you to decide on a session-by-session 
basis. Once you have saved your session, you can then log out, restart, or shut down the system.  
System 
This section of the System Settings’ Advanced tab provides modules that deal with managing logins to 
scheduling when to run specified tasks. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS

Login Manager 
KDM,
12 the KDE Display Manager, is the software that is used to provide the PC-BSD login screen. The 
Login Manager configuration module, seen in Figure 7-30, allows you to configure various aspects of 
KDM. 
 
 
Figure 7-30. Login Manager configuration module 
The options available in each tab are as follows:  
General: Here you can set the language, theme, color scheme, and fonts used 
by KDM.  
Dialog: If the Use themed greeter box is checked in the General tab, you will 
receive a message indicating that there is no dialog window. If you uncheck that 
box, this tab allows you to create your own greeting and show a logo, a clock, or 
nothing but the greeting. 
Background: Allows you to set the background wallpaper or a slideshow of 
pictures that appear behind the login screen. 
                                                 
 
12 See the KDM Handbook at http://docs.kde.org/stable/en/kdebase-workspace/kdm/index.html for more 
information about configuring KDM. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
194 
Theme: This mode will be disabled unless the Use themed greeter box is 
checked in the General tab. Here you can select and preview preinstalled 
themes. Click Get New Themes to browse for more themes from kde-look.org. 
Shutdown: This tab allows you to configure who is allowed to perform local 
(this computer) and remote (other computers on the network) shutdowns. The 
choices are Everybody, Only Root, and Nobody. By default, Everybody can 
perform a local shutdown and Only Root can perform a remote shutdown. The 
actual commands should be left as is, but you can view which commands are 
used to perform those operations. If you have installed the Grub boot manager, 
change the Boot Manager from None to Grub. Grub is most often seen on 
systems which dual boot with Linux. 
Users: If you want to choose from a list of users when you log in, check any 
usernames that you do not want to appear from the Excluded Users list and 
make sure that the Show list check box is checked. For security reasons, you 
should leave the System UIDs setting as-is; this will prevent the root user and 
system accounts from being used at login time. In the User Images section, you 
can select a user in the drop-down list; then click the icon to select which 
picture appears next to that username. If you prefer the more secure but 
inconvenient setting of manually typing in the username without seeing a list of 
users and their icons, uncheck the Show list check box. 
Convenience: This section comes with a big red Attention Read help warning 
message as changing these settings can affect the security of your system. 
During installation, you were asked if you want the primary user to 
automatically log in. If you change your mind, you can enable or disable that 
option and select the primary user in this tab. You can also check the insecure 
setting of Enable Password-Less Logins and select which users have this ability. 
You can specify which username is pretyped in for you in the Preselect User 
section; options are none, previous, or a specified user account. If the Focus 
password check box is checked, the cursor will place itself in the password type-
in box. You can also choose whether or not to be automatically logged in should 
an X server crash abruptly end your current session.  
PolicyKit Authorization  
PolicyKit
13 is a framework for managing which user level processes are allowed to interact with processes 
running with system privileges. This means that it would be rare for anyone other than a KDE 
application developer to make changes within this configuration module. Any changes should be well 
researched and made at your own risk as they could affect the operation and security of your computer. 
Figure 7-31 shows a screenshot of the PolicyKit Authorization configuration module with some of its 
options expanded.

Power Management 
KDE4 uses PowerDevil to manage laptop power management. The Power Management module, seen in 
Figure 7-32, is used to configure the laptop’s power settings. 
■ Tip If you aren’t running PC-BSD on a laptop, you can prevent the PowerDevil service from starting in System 
Settings ➤ KDE Services. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS

Figure 7-32. Power Management configuration module 
The General Settings tab allows you to configure warning notifications and to assign profiles to 
specific actions. If you click Configure Notifications, you will see the screen in Figure 7-33. For each 
action in the Title column, you can configure a variety of events.

By default, the only profile that shows in the Profile Assignment drop-down menus is the 
performance profile that has been created for you. You can view and edit the default profile as well as 
create your own in the Edit Profiles menu, seen in Figure 7-34. 
 
 
Figure 7-34. Viewing the default performance profile’s settings in Power Management 
This screenshot shows the Actions settings. You can also click the Screen and CPU and System tabs 
toward the bottom of the menu to view and modify their settings. The four icons in the lower-left corner 
of this menu allow you to create a new profile, delete the selected profile, and import or export the 
selected profile. 
The Capabilities menu shows you what PowerDevil thinks your laptop hardware is capable of. A 
screenshot from a laptop is seen in Figure 7-35; your laptop’s capabilities may differ.

Samba 
Samba allows PC-BSD, Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows systems to share files and printers. Samba can 
also allow your PC-BSD system to act as a Windows domain controller or a member of an Active 
Directory domain. Samba uses the smb.conf configuration file to control access to the network’s shared 
resources. The Samba configuration module, seen in Figure 7-36, provides a frontend to this 
configuration file, allowing you to quickly browse and enable the options you need for your network. 
Note that you still need to understand the configuration file to get the most out of the available options. 
■ Note Entire books have been written about Samba because it is a powerful tool with a lot of configuration 
possibilities. We provide only a brief introduction to the configuration tool in this section. To actually understand 
the configurations, you will want to spend some time reading the documentation available from 
http://www.samba.org/. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS 
 
199 
 
Figure 7-36. Samba configuration module 
■ Tip If the options in this module are greyed out, restart the module from Kickoff ➤ Samba Manager. This should 
prompt you for the administrative password. 
PC-BSD creates a MYGROUP workgroup for you; if your system is part of an existing Windows 
workgroup, change this setting to the workgroup’s name. If there are other computers in the same 
workgroup, you can browse the workgroup’s resources by typing smb:/ into Konqueror or Dolphin. You 
should understand the available Security Levels in a Windows network before changing from the default 
setting of User. 
The Shares tab allows you to fine-tune what gets shared in the network. By default, a homes share is 
created for you. If you double-click the share, a very comprehensive Add/Edit Share menu becomes 
available, as seen in Figure 7-37. Remember: change these settings only if you know what you are doing. 
■ Tip You can create additional shares in Dolphin, using the instructions for sharing a folder in the "Installing from 
Another PC-BSD System" section in Chapter 8.

Figure 7-37. Editing a share’s settings in Samba configuration module 
The Printers and the Users tabs are expected to work in a future version of PC-BSD. They will allow 
an administrator to fine-tune the permissions of printer shares and Samba users. 
The Advanced tab, seen in Figure 7-38 literally contains hundreds of Samba options. If what you 
want to configure isn’t in any of the other tabs, it is probably here.

Task Scheduler 
PC-BSD uses the cron service to schedule tasks. cron understands two types of scheduled tasks, or 
crontabs: tasks a user wants to schedule and tasks that are used to maintain the operating system. 
Operating system maintenance tasks are known as system cron. Only the superuser can edit the system 
cron and rarely does so. Users can schedule their own tasks.  
■ Tip Systems that use the cron scheduler read “crontab” files to determine which tasks to run at what time. 
Power users can edit these files directly. Task Scheduler provides an easy to use interface for editing the 
underlying crontab files. 
Figure 7-39 provides a screenshot of Task Scheduler. 
 
 
Figure 7-39. Task scheduler configuration module 
By default, the Personal Cron area will be empty until you add a task. If you click the System Cron 
button, you can view the scheduled operating system tasks. The tasks will be greyed out to remind you 
that you should not modify the system cron. 
To schedule a personal task, click New Task to see the menu shown in Figure 7-40. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM SETTINGS

Figure 7-40. Adding a new task to one’s personal cron 
This menu makes it easy to browse to an application or custom script to run. You can then fine-tune 
which months, days, hours, and minutes the task will run. Note that you can select multiple items. For 
example, you can set the task to run at 1:15 AM as well as 19:15 PM. If you click the Custom Selection 
drop-down menu, you can choose to run the task at the specified time intervals. 
Summary 
This chapter concludes Part 2, which covered every aspect of using PC-BSD. You now know how to 
customize your desktop, find and launch applications, perform common computing tasks, and use all 
the System Settings configuration modules. 
Part 3 concentrates on software: getting it, keeping it up-to-date, and uninstalling it. We’ll start with 
the software management system that is unique to PC-BSD: the push button installer.

Push Button Installer System 
Chapter 5 discussed some of the software that is available to perform common tasks using your PC-BSD 
system. Part 3 of this book will show you all the ways you can find, install, and manage software. This 
chapter covers the Push Button Installer (PBI) system. 
What Is a PBI? 
PBI is the name of the software management system that is unique to PC-BSD. An application that you 
can install using this software management system is also called a PBI. For example, you might see 
references to someone installing the Firefox PBI. If you ever come across a file with a .pbi extension, it is 
an application that can be installed using the PBI software manager. 
As you go through Part 3 of this book, you’ll discover that there are many different ways to install 
software on your PC-BSD system. Whenever possible, you should use the PBI system because it provides 
the following advantages: 
• 
PBI software is easy to install. You simply find the application in Software 
Manager and click it to install. 
• 
PBI software is easy to uninstall using Software Manager. 
• 
Software Manager will tell you when newer versions of your installed applications 
become available and it will allow you to easily upgrade to the new versions. 
• 
PBI software has been pretested to run on PC-BSD, meaning it should “just work.” 
• 
Software Manager ensures that no other applications are affected when you install 
or uninstall PBI software. This means that you won’t accidentally overwrite or 
delete libraries or dependencies needed by the operating system or other 
applications. 
The rest of this chapter demonstrates how to use Software Manager to manage PBIs. 
Software Manager 
To access the PBI system, simply double-click the Software Manager icon on the default Desktop.  

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
206 
■ Tip You can also find Software Manager in Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ System ➤ Software Manager. 
When starting Software Manager, you will be prompted for the superuser password because only 
the administrative account can install software. You also need to be connected to the Internet because 
Software Manager will attempt to connect to the PC-BSD software repository at pbidir.com. Figure 8-1 
shows a screenshot of Software Manager. 
 
 
Figure 8-1. Software Manager 
If the connection to pbidir.com is successful, you will see the available software categories loaded in 
the Software Browser tab. 
Software Manager contains the following tabs: 
Software Browser: Allows you to browse for PBIs. Using its built-in search 
feature is discussed in the following section, “Installing a PBI.” 
Installed Software: Shows you which PBIs are already installed, and allows you 
to update or remove installed PBIs. 
System Updates: Allows you to check for, review, and install operating system 
updates. They are discussed in more detail in the "Update Manager" section 
later on in this chapter. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
207 
Software Manager also provides a Configuration button that contains the following tabs: 
Mirrors: Specifies which PBI server on the Internet to connect to. You can also 
specify a custom mirror if you have created your own web server to host PBIs. 
Software: Allows you to keep a copy of downloaded PBIs after installation. This 
is discussed further in the section titled “Installing from Another PC-BSD 
System.” 
System: Allows you to automatically install available updates. 
Misc: Allows you to specify an alternate temporary directory to store 
downloaded PBIs. 
The next section will demonstrate how to install a PBI using Software Manager. 
Installing a PBI 
The Software Browser tab of Software Manager can be used to browse for and install PBIs. In the 
example seen in Figure 8-2, the user has entered a search phrase of firefox, and the search results show 
that there are two Firefox PBIs available. 
 
 
Figure 8-2. Using Software Manager to search for a Firefox PBI 
If you don’t know the name of the application you want to install or want to get an idea of which 
PBIs are available, you can instead click a software category. In the example shown in Figure 8-3, the 
user clicked the left arrow to return to the software categories screen. The user then clicked the Web 
Browsers category to see which web browsers were available. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM

Figure 8-3. Browsing for software in the Web Browsers category 
If the user clicks an application, they will see more information. Figure 8-4 shows the information 
for the Opera web browser. 
 
 
Figure 8-4. Information about selected PBI 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
209 
Each PBI contains a description, the name of the organization (vendor) that creates the software, its 
rating among PBI users, the number of downloads since the PBI became available, the date the PBI was 
added to the repository, the license the software is released under, the e-mail address of the person who 
created the PBI, and the version number of the PBI. If you want to install the software, click either the 
DOWNLOAD hyperlink or the download icon that contains the green arrow.  
■ Tip PBIs tend to be large because they contain everything needed to run the application. If you have several  
PC-BSD systems in your network, consider downloading the PBIs you need to a shared folder on one system. 
Instructions on how to do so are in the section called “Installing from Another PC-BSD System” later in this 
chapter. 
When you click to install the application, a pop-up message will ask if you want to install the 
selected PBI. Click OK and the Installed Software tab will open, showing the progress of the installation. 
Figure 8-5 shows that the gtkpod PBI is currently downloading.

■ Tip Should the Internet connection fail during the download, the message in the Installed Software tab will 
change to “Download failed! Please try again later.” When you regain your Internet connection, right-click the 
message and select Retry Download to resume the installation. The message will remain until either the 
installation is complete or you use the Remove button to remove it. 
Once the download is complete, the installer will begin, as seen in Figure 8-6. 
 
 
Figure 8-6. Initial screen of PBI installer 
Click Next to continue. The installer will tell you where the application will be installed, how much 
disk space it requires, and how much space is available, as seen in Figure 8-7. 
 
 
Figure 8-7. PBI installer showing amount of disk space needed and available for application installation 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM

Click Next to start the installation. A progress meter will display while it is installing. When finished, 
the PBI will indicate its location in the Kickoff menu, as seen in Figure 8-8, and then will provide you 
with an installation complete message, as seen in Figure 8-9. The default is to start the application when 
the installer exits.

Installing from a DVD 
During the installation, you were asked if you wanted to install any software from the installation DVD. If 
you didn’t install then, but want to now, simply insert the DVD and wait until Device Notifier pops up 
with the label of the DVD. You can then access the contents of the DVD from Dolphin. 
While in Dolphin, click the DVD’s label name in the Places panel. You will find the applications that 
came with the DVD in the extras ➤ PBI folder. Right-click the PBI you want to install and select Open 
with PBI Launcher from the menu. After entering the administrative password, the PBI will install as 
described in the previous section. 
Installing from Another PC-BSD System 
By default, Software Manager will download and install PBIs without permanently saving a copy of the 
downloaded PBI. If you want to save a copy of the PBI so it is available to other PC-BSD systems in your 
network, you will need to change this default. You can do so by clicking the Configuration button in 
Software Manager and then clicking the Software tab, as seen in Figure 8-10. 
 
 
Figure 8-10. Software tab in Configuration button of Software Manager 
Check the box Keep downloaded software in Temporary Directory. The location of that directory is 
in the Misc tab and by default is set to /usr/local/tmp. If you change this default directory to a folder in 
your home directory, you can easily share your PBIs with other PC-BSD users in your network. In the 
Misc tab, click the folder icon next to the Temporary file directory to browse to a folder you want to 
share.  
In Figure 8-11, I highlighted dru’s home directory and then clicked the New Folder button to create 
a new folder called software. Once I click OK, /home/dru/software will show as the new temporary file 
directory. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
213 
 
Figure 8-11. Creating a new directory in the Misc tab to store downloaded PBIs 
To share this directory so it is accessible to other PC-BSD computers in the network, open up 
Dolphin. Click Home in the Places panel; then highlight the software folder. Right-click and select 
Properties from the menu. Click the share tab and then the Configure File Sharing button. You will be 
prompted for the administrative password, and then you will see the menu shown in Figure 8-12. 
 
 
Figure 8-12. Configuring file folder sharing 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
214 
Because the folder you want to share is in your home directory, you can keep the default of Simple 
sharing. Click the Add button to open the Share Folder screen seen in Figure 8-13. You can then browse 
to the folder you want to share (in this example, /home/dru/software).  
 
 
Figure 8-13. Sharing a software folder in Dolphin 
Once the folder is selected, check the box to Share with Samba (Microsoft(R) Windows(R)). This will 
add the Name of the folder—it will be capitalized, and if the original name was greater than eight 
characters, it will be reduced to eight characters. This will allow the folder to be shared with any 
computer that understands Samba. You should leave the Writable box unchecked unless you want other 
computers to be able to add files to this folder. When finished, press OK, and your folder will show in the 
Shared Folders list. 
You can check that your changes worked from Dolphin. Click Network in Places and then Samba 
Shares ➤ Mygroup. You should have an icon with your hostname; in my example, the icon’s name was 
Pcbsd-3228 (Samba Server). If you click that icon, you will see your software folder and its contents. The 
other PC-BSD users in your network should now be able to access your shared folder from Dolphin or 
Konqueror. If they use Konqueror, they can type smb:/ to browse to your group, computer, and shared 
software folder. 
■ Tip We have demonstrated sharing a folder so other PC-BSD users can access your downloaded PBIs. You can 
use the folder-sharing instructions to share the contents of any folder. Your shared folder should be accessible to 
any computer running PC-BSD or any version of Microsoft. 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
215 
Installing from the Temporary Directory 
If you already have a copy of a downloaded PBI saved in the temporary directory, you can install it 
directly from Dolphin without downloading it all over again within Software Manager. You might run 
across this situation if you install a PBI, remove it, and then decide you want to install it again.  
Open up your PBI temporary directory in Dolphin, right-click the PBI, and select Open with PBI 
Launcher from the menu. After typing the administrative password, the PBI installation will proceed as 
usual. 
Removing a PBI 
To uninstall a PBI, highlight it in the Installed Software tab and either right-click and select Uninstall or 
click the Remove button. You will receive a warning asking if you want to remove this application. Once 
you press Yes, the application will be uninstalled, removed from the Installed Software tab, and removed 
from its location in the Kickoff menu. Its entire directory will be removed from /Programs. If the 
application stored data in your home directory, it might ask if you want to remove it when the 
application is uninstalled.  
Updating PBIs 
The Installed Software manager tab in Software Manager can be used to update PBIs whenever a newer 
version becomes available. The Status section will indicate which versions are available. Figure 8-14 
indicates that this system can upgrade from Firefox version 3.5.5 to version 3.5.6.  
 
 
Figure 8-14. Updating a PBI in Software Manager 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
216 
If an update is available, simply highlight the PBI you want to update and click the Update button. It 
will uninstall the old PBI for you and then download and install the newer version. When finished, the 
new version number will show in the Program Name.  
■ Tip If you ever accidentally remove the desktop icon for an installed PBI, right-click the application in the 
Installed Software tab of Software Manager. Click Install Desktop Icons, and it will re-add the icon to your desktop. 
Update Manager 
Update Manager is used to notify you when newer versions of PBIs become available and when patches 
are available for your operating system. The system tray includes an icon for Update Manager. When 
your PBIs and operating system are up-to-date, the icon for Update Manager appears as a green shield 
with a white checkmark. If updates are available, the icon changes to a red shield with a white X. 
If you right-click the Update Manager icon in the system tray, you can do the following: 
Start the Update Manager: Launches Software Manager. You can then use the 
Installed Applications tab to update any PBIs whose status shows that there is a 
newer version available and use the System Updates tab to update the 
operating system, as discussed in this section. 
Check for updates: Causes the icon to change to a green circular arrow as it 
connects to the PC-BSD update server to see whether any updates are available. 
When finished, a pop-up menu will indicate if your system is completely up-to-
date or if updates are available. 
Run at startup: If checked, Update Manager will automatically check for 
updates whenever you start KDE. If unchecked, you can manually check 
whenever you want by clicking Check for updates. 
Quit: This will remove Update Manager from the system tray. You can still 
manually start Update Manager from Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ System ➤ 
Online Update Notifier. 
The System Updates tab of Software Manager is used to install operating system patches. Figure 8-
15 shows that the SSL Security Update is available for a PC-BSD system.  
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
217 
 
Figure 8-15. Installing a system update using Software Manager 
If you highlight the entry, the View Details button will explain the reason for the update. An example 
of an older update is seen in Figure 8-16. 
 
 
Figure 8-16. Viewing the details of a security update 

CHAPTER 8 ■ PUSH BUTTON INSTALLER SYSTEM 
 
218 
To apply the update, check the box next to it or click the Select All button to apply all security 
updates. A progress bar, seen in Figure 8-17, will show you which update is currently being downloaded 
or applied. 
 
 
Figure 8-17. Update progress for a system update 
Some updates will require the system to reboot, and Update Manager will present a pop-up 
message to remind you to reboot for those changes to take effect. Update Manager will not automatically 
reboot for you. This means that you can continue to do other things with your computer while the 
system is being updated, without worrying about losing the data you are currently working on. 
When a PBI Doesn’t Exist 
We mentioned at the beginning of this chapter that the PBI software management system is the best way 
to install applications on your PC-BSD system. While the PBI system offers many of the most popular 
software applications, not every application will have a PBI. If you can’t find a PBI of your favorite 
application, you have a few choices available to you: 
• 
Install its FreeBSD package, as described in Chapter 9. 
• 
Install its FreeBSD port, as described in Chapter 10. 
• 
Ask that someone within the PC-BSD community create the PBI. Chapter 11 
discusses how to ask for help within the community. 
• 
Create the PBI yourself. How to do this is demonstrated in Chapter 12. 
Summary 
This chapter introduced you to PC-BSD’s PBI system. Its Software Manager makes it easy to find, install, 
remove, and update software. The next two chapters will introduce you to FreeBSD’s packages and ports 
collections. Both of these collections allow you to access a much larger collection of software, but also 
require a bit more knowledge on your part.

FreeBSD Packages 
Chapter 8 introduced you to the PBI system of installing and managing software. While this is the 
preferred way to handle software on your PC-BSD system, it is not the only method available to you. This 
chapter will introduce you to FreeBSD packages, the second easiest way to manage software on your PC-
BSD system. Chapter 9 will introduce you to FreeBSD ports, which allow advanced users to customize 
their software installations. 
■ Caution Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 require you to use the command line to manage software. If you prefer to 
use a GUI or don’t have the time right now to learn new commands, use the instructions in Chapter 8 to find, 
install, and manage your software. You can always come back to these chapters later when you have more time 
and want to advance your software management skills. 
What Is the Ports Collection? 
The Internet contains literally hundreds of thousands of free applications. Many can be found at free 
software websites such as Sourceforge.net (which hosts more than 200,000 applications); others, such as 
openoffice.org and gimp.org, have their own websites. Some are stable and well documented; others are 
buggy, and you have to guess how they work. With so much out there to choose from, how do you find 
the software you need and how do you know it will work on your PC-BSD system? 
The FreeBSD Project maintains something known as the ports collection.
1 This is a large collection 
of software that has been “ported” for FreeBSD. In a nutshell, ported means that someone did a fair bit 
of work to make the necessary changes needed for the software to run on FreeBSD. If you’re curious as 
to what is involved, the Porter’s Handbook
2 contains the instructions for making a port. The person who 
makes the port is known as the port’s maintainer. 
                                                 
 
1 See http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports.html for more details. 
2 http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/porters-handbook/ 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
220 
To make sure that all the ports in the ports collection work, the FreeBSD Project uses a build farm 
known as pointyhat.
3 A build farm is a cluster of machines that constantly rebuilds the ports in the ports 
collection. This is important because an application that is known to work can sometimes stop working 
(for example, if a software library it uses changes). Sometimes an application that works on one version 
of FreeBSD won’t work on a newer version of FreeBSD without some modification. Pointyhat will e-mail 
the maintainer if there is a problem with the port until the maintainer fixes the problem. 
The FreeBSD Project is also concerned about software security. It maintains a database of known 
vulnerabilities, known as VuXML,
4 and provides tools you can use to determine if any of your installed 
software is vulnerable. 
The ports collection is the collection of ported software. However, you have two choices in how you 
install an application from the collection. The first choice is to install the package. Think of a package as 
a command-line installer program that knows how to install the application, all its dependencies, and 
any documentation and configuration files associated with the application. The second choice is to 
compile (or build) the port yourself. This chapter concentrates on packages; Chapter 10 will show you 
how to compile a port.  
What Is a Package?  
Like a PBI, a FreeBSD package represents an application that has been pretested for you so that it can be 
easily installed and used on your PC-BSD system (remember, PC-BSD is really FreeBSD “under the 
hood”). Similar to a PBI, a package contains instructions to install everything it needs to work on your 
system. FreeBSD’s package management system allows you to see if newer versions of the package are 
available and provides a way to upgrade or uninstall applications. While the end result is the same, in 
that both the PBI system and the FreeBSD package management system allow you to install and manage 
software, the commands you use to do so are different. The major difference is that the PBI system 
provides a graphical Software Manager, whereas the FreeBSD package system requires you to type 
commands at a command prompt. 
Why Use Packages on PC-BSD?  
If the PBI system provides a graphical Software Manager, why would you want to use a command-line 
system to install software? The most compelling reason is the sheer number of FreeBSD applications 
that are available. As of February, 2010, there are more than 21,000 applications in the FreeBSD ports 
collection, meaning that there is a very good chance that the application you are looking for is available 
as a package. It is also pretty cool that PC-BSD gives you the choice of how you install and maintain your 
software, rather than forcing you to use one software management system.

221 
Finding Packages  
The easiest way to find FreeBSD packages is to point a web browser to http://www.FreshPorts.org, as 
seen in Figure 1. FreshPorts provides an easy-to-use interface to the information available within the 
FreeBSD ports collection. If you’re wondering what software is available to install on your FreeBSD or 
PC-BSD system, FreshPorts is the place to go! 
 
 
Figure 9-1. FreshPorts website 
If you use the Firefox web browser, you can access this website quickly using a FreshPorts search 
plugin available from http://www.searchplugins.net/pluginlist.aspx?q=FreshPorts&mode=title. While 
in Firefox, go to that website and click the I to install the plugin (see Figure 9-2). 
■ Tip There are two Is to choose from. The first one will use the default search engine icon, and the second one 
will install the Beastie icon. If you change your mind about which to install, use the Manage Search Engines menu 
in the Firefox search bar drop-down menu to remove the plugin. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
222 
 
Figure 9-2. Installing the FreshPorts Firefox plugin 
A pop-up Add Search Engine message will ask if you want to Add this plugin. Check the box Start 
using it right away; then press Add. You can then click the drop-down arrow in the search engine bar in 
the upper-right corner of Firefox to select the FreshPorts search utility, as seen in Figure 9-3. To search 
for an application using the plugin, simply type the name of the software into the FreshPorts search bar 
and it will show you the results from FreshPorts.org. 
 
 
Figure 9-3. Firefox search plugin menu showing FreshPorts search plugin 
■ Tip If you don’t use the Firefox web browser, you can still search for software using the Search utility at the 
FreshPorts.org website. 
FreshPorts provides a lot of useful information that can assist you in deciding which software to 
install. If you have no idea where to start and want to get a feel for what software is available, click the 
Categories hyperlink, located about halfway down the page in the right frame. This will show you a view 
of all available software divided into categories, as seen in Figure 9-4. Click a category to browse all its 
applications. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
223 
 
Figure 9-4. Using FreshPorts to browse software categories 
Let’s take a closer look at the type of information that is available for a port within the ports 
collection. Figure 9-5 shows the results from a FreshPorts search for the phrase “dillo”. 
 
 
Figure 9-5. Search results for “dillo” 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
224 
From the output, you can see that dillo is “a fast, small graphical Web browser” and that there are 
three versions available within the ports collection. Version 0.8.6_4 has a skull icon, indicating that it has 
had a known security vulnerability in VuXML. If that vulnerability has not been fixed yet, a package will 
not be available. You can click the skull icon to read details about the vulnerability (click the dillo 
hyperlink in the page that opens up). 
Each FreshPorts entry contains the following information about the software: 
Name: The name of the application, followed by its version number and 
category. Click the magnifier icon to determine whether any other software 
depends upon this application. 
Maintained by: The e-mail address of the person responsible for making sure 
the software works on FreeBSD. Click the magnifier icon to see what other 
applications they are responsible for. 
CVSWeb: Contains the complete history of the application since it first became 
available within the FreeBSD ports collection. CVSWeb will be discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 10. 
Sources: Shows the original source location of the software that was ported, as 
well as the checksums and size of the software source. Note that this is for 
informational purposes because the package system will fetch the software for 
you (that is, you shouldn’t download it yourself). 
Main Web Site: This is the primary site of the application. This website often 
contains screenshots, documentation, and more information about the 
software. 
Distfiles Availability: Shows the availability of the software source for that 
category. This will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 10. 
PortsMon: Shows a report on the status of the FreeBSD port. See 
http://portsmon.freebsd.org for more information about the PortsMon 
project. 
Installation instructions: Provides the commands used to install the software 
using the FreeBSD ports system (discussed in Chapter 10) and the FreeBSD 
packages system (discussed in the “Installing a Package” section of this 
chapter). 
In addition to the information about each port, the FreshPorts website contains lots of other useful 
information. The Latest Vulnerabilities section (in the right frame) can be used to browse through 
software with known existing security vulnerabilities. The Ports section contains hyperlinks to the 
software categories, the list of deleted ports, and the FreshPorts RSS newsfeeds. 
The Statistics section contains graphs; counts for the total number of ported applications; and the 
number of broken, deprecated, and vulnerable applications. It also contains hyperlinks to lists of 
software added within the last 24 or 48 hours, 7 days, fortnight, and month. The FAQ in the This Site 
section includes explanations of packages and ports and descriptions of all the icons used on the 
website. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
225 
Ports Console 
Beginning with version 8, PC-BSD provides a Ports Console utility to use when installing FreeBSD 
packages. An icon for this utility can be found on the desktop. It is also available in Kickoff ➤ Ports 
Console.  
■ Tip Curious power users can read the underlying shell script that sets up the environment for Ports Console in 
/PCBSD/portjail/portjail.sh. 
If you have ever installed packages before on a FreeBSD system, you know that there are several 
pkg_* commands that are used to manage FreeBSD packages. You will use the same commands on a 
PC-BSD system. Never use any pkg_* command directly from a PC-BSD command prompt! Instead, 
always use these commands within PC-BSD’s Ports Console tool. 
■ Caution Just in case you missed the warning in the preceding paragraph, you really don’t want to use any 
commands that start with pkg_ outside of the Ports Console on a PC-BSD system. Ports Console ensures that the 
packages you install and manage don’t interfere with the software already installed with the PC-BSD operating 
system. 
Ports Console provides a safe environment for installing and managing FreeBSD packages. It does 
so by creating a jail
5 that separates the applications you install from the PC-BSD operating system. This 
means that you can install, update, and uninstall all the FreeBSD packages you like, without worrying 
about accidentally deleting applications that are needed by the PC-BSD operating system. This 
separation also means that Software Manager (described in detail in Chapter 8) has no idea which 
FreeBSD packages you have installed. FreeBSD packages will not show up in Software Manager’s 
Installed Software tab and Update Manager will not notify you if new versions of your installed FreeBSD 
packages become available. As you go through this chapter, you’ll learn how to use the command-line 
tools to manage your packages—meaning you can still manage your installed packages; you just won’t 
be doing it with Software Manager. 
When you start Ports Console, it looks like any other Konsole prompt. In reality, you have connected 
to a jail. Take a look at the difference between Figure 9-6 and Figure 9-7. 
 
                                                 
 
5 Wikipedia provides a good introduction and references to FreeBSD jails http://en.wikipedia.org/ 
wiki/FreeBSD_jail.

Figure 9-6. Listing of the / directory in Ports Console 
 
 
Figure 9-7. Listing of the / directory in Konsole 
Notice that the Ports Console is missing the /PCBSD directory, which contains programs used to 
maintain the operating system, and the /Programs directory, which contains the software installed using 
the PBI system. You will see even more of a difference if you try the pkg_info command, as 
demonstrated in Figure 9-8 and Figure 9-9. (Yes, I know I told you never to run a pkg_* command 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
227 
outside of Ports Console—we’ll do it just this once with a view-only command to demonstrate  
the difference.)

Figure 9-9. pkg_info output in Konsole on a default installation of PC-BSD 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
228 
The pkg_info command is used to view which non-PBI applications (e.g., FreeBSD packages) are 
installed. Notice that Ports Console indicates that no packages are installed because we haven’t installed 
any yet. However, if you press your spacebar to scroll through the output of pkg_info within Konsole, 
you’ll see that hundreds of applications were installed with PC-BSD. These are the applications you 
don’t want to mess up. This is why you use Ports Console to maintain that separation between whatever 
software you’re playing with and the software that PC-BSD needs to keep your system humming happily 
along. 
Installing a Package  
Okay, now that we’re in Ports Console, how do we add an application? Let’s return to the dillo example 
we saw at FreshPorts in Figure 9-5. FreshPorts indicates that you can install dillo2 (version 2.1.2_1) using 
the command pkg_add -r dillo2 (the -r means to fetch the remote package from the FreeBSD ports 
collection on the Internet). Double-check that you’re in Ports Console (the title of your window should 
say portjail: csh) and that you are connected to the Internet. Become the superuser with the su 
command and type the pkg_add command, as seen in Figure 9-10. Note that the title bar at the top of 
the screen has changed to portjail: pkg_add, indicating that the package is being fetched. The 
informational messages in the Ports console screen let you know what is happening with the installation. 
 
 
Figure 9-10. Installing the dillo2 package using Ports Console 
When the installation is complete, you will receive your prompt back. 
You probably noticed that dillo requires a lot of additional software, known as dependencies, to 
install and run. pkg_add found and installed all these dependencies for you. This “just works,” thanks to 
the hard work of the maintainer of this port. If you ever want to know who to thank for making a favorite

software application available for your system, check the port’s Maintainer section at FreshPorts. Send a 
thank you e-mail or buy them their beverage of choice if you ever meet them in person to let them know 
that you appreciate their effort. 
If you now repeat the pkg_info command, you’ll get a listing of all the software that was installed, as 
seen in Figure 9-11. 
 
 
Figure 9-11. Viewing the software that was installed with dillo2 
Determining what was Installed 
Now that you have an installed application, you’ll want to use it. pkg_info can be used to determine the 
path to the application. Use the -Lx switch to receive a list of what was installed, and filter your search 
using | grep bin. This tells pkg_info that you’re interested only in the path to the binary (another name 
for the application’s executable). The output indicates that this package installed three binaries, as seen 
in Figure 9-12. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
230 
 
Figure 9-12. Using pkg_info to find the location of the dillo2 binary 
■ Tip Note that I asked pkg_info about dillo, not dillo2. The x in -Lx tells pkg_info to look for a package with the 
specified name (in this case, dillo). By not including the number, pkg_info will search for all versions of dillo and 
will let me know if multiple versions of dillo are installed. 
It’s a good bet that dillo, located in the /usr/local/bin directory is the executable you are looking for. 
You can double-check this with the whatis command. Note that in this example, the original creator of 
the dillo application (not the port maintainer) has not created any documentation (man pages) for the 
dpid or dpidc applications because the whatis command can’t find anything appropriate. To see if any 
documentation was installed at all, I filtered the pkg_info output for the word dpid. The results show 
only the two binaries and a configuration file (config files live in a path containing /etc/). Looks like I’ll 
have to go to the dillo website to see if there is any information at all about these binaries. 
So, how do you start the dillo web browser? The short answer is to type dillo and press Enter. But 
take note of the longer answer: 
• 
Type exit to leave the superuser account. Remember that you install applications 
as the superuser but run them as your regular user account. 
• 
Once you are back to your regular user account, type rehash. If you don’t, your 
shell doesn’t know that you’ve just installed a new application, meaning that it 
won’t find it and will give you a “command not found” error message. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
231 
• 
Occasionally, a binary will be installed outside of the path your shell searches 
when it is looking for an application, so it can start it for you. If this happens, you 
have to type the full path to the binary rather than just the binary name. If you’re 
not sure what your path is, type $PATH to view it. 
• 
Always run the application from Ports Console. 
This last point is a biggie on a PC-BSD system. Because FreeBSD packages are installed into their 
own jail, they are available only from within the jail. This means that they can be started only within 
Ports Console and, for example, can’t be added to the Kickoff menu. If you find yourself installing 
FreeBSD packages because the software you need isn’t available as a PBI, it probably means that there 
should be a PBI for that software. If you’re a power user, consider making the PBI yourself using the 
instructions in Chapter 14. If you’re not confident enough to tackle creating a PBI, see Chapter 11 to 
learn how to interact with the PC-BSD community to see if someone else can create the PBI. 
What to Do if Something Fails 
Packages usually work flawlessly by using the instructions in the previous section. But occasionally 
something goes wrong. Sometimes pkg_add stops with a message saying that it can’t fetch the package. 
Sometimes pkg_add complains that it can’t find a dependency and refuses to finish the installation 
without it. Sometimes the package installs, but you get an error message when you try to run the 
application. 
If pkg_add tells you it can’t fetch the package, double-check that you are the superuser and that the 
pkg_add command FreshPorts told you to use was typed correctly into Ports Console. If you see a typo, 
fix it and try again. If it still won’t fetch, double-check that you’re connected to the Internet by pinging a 
website name. If it still won’t fetch or still refuses to install or run, you’ll have to do a bit of research to 
see what is going wrong. 
Go back to that port’s entry in FreshPorts. Does it have a skull icon or a message indicating that it is 
broken, forbidden, or restricted? If so, there probably isn’t a package available. If you really want that 
version of the software, consider trying to build its port instead. Otherwise, try another version of the 
port or another application that provides similar functionality. 
You can also browse the FreeBSD ports mailing list archives
6 to see if other users are experiencing 
the same problem. If you want to discuss the error on that mailing list, be sure to read the Frequently 
Asked Questions About The FreeBSD Mailing Lists
7 document first so that your e-mail contains all the 
information needed to get a useful response from the mailing list. 
Updating Packages  
Before you can update a package, you have to be aware that there is a newer version to update to. This 
section will show you how to create a customized watch list. We will then show you how to update to the 
newer version.

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
232 
Automatic Notifications with FreshPorts  
While Update Manager won’t tell you when newer versions of FreeBSD packages become available, you 
can configure FreshPorts to send you an e-mail when changes are made to your installed ports. 
To do so, you’ll have to first create an account with FreshPorts. Once you have activated your 
account and are logged in, a Watch Lists section will appear in the right frame of the FreshPorts website. 
Click the Upload hyperlink, which will open the page seen in Figure 9-13. 
 
 
Figure 9-13. Creating a FreshPorts Watch List to be notified of changes to your installed ports 
From within Ports Console, type pkg_info -qoa|more. This will create a list of the ports you have 
installed. Depending on what you have installed, this list may be several pages long. Cut/paste the list of 
ports you see in Ports Console into the Paste box seen in Figure 9-13. Then, return to Ports Console and 
press the spacebar to go to the next page so you can copy/paste its ports. Repeat until you get your 
prompt back in Ports Console. When finished, double-check that your pasted list contains only ports 
(e.g., not the word More); then click the Upload button. You should receive a message that your watch 
list has been updated. You can then configure how often you want to be notified by going back to Watch 
Lists ➤ Report Subscriptions. This page is seen in Figure 9-14. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
233 
 
Figure 9-14. Configuring how often to be notified of changes to your installed ports 
Check the box next to Watch List Notification. If you don’t want to receive a daily e-mail, click Day 
to choose another selection from the drop-down menu. When finished, press the update button at the 
bottom of the page. You’ll now receive an e-mail regarding any changes to your ports at the frequency 
that you configured. 
■ Tip Don’t forget to update your watch list whenever you add new packages. You can choose to replace or 
append (add to) your list. 
Performing the Upgrade 
The easiest way to upgrade to a newer version of a package is to remove the old one first (see the next 
section, “Removing a Package”); then use pkg_add to install the new version. 
Power users can also use the portupgrade application to upgrade all or some of their FreeBSD 
software at once. portupgrade is discussed in detail in Chapter 10. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
234 
Removing a Package  
While pkg_add is used to install (add) FreeBSD software, pkg_delete is used to uninstall (delete) 
FreeBSD software. Figure 9-15 shows an example of uninstalling the dillo package installed earlier. Note 
that this command is run within Ports Console and that you have to become superuser in order to 
uninstall a package. Again, the -x indicates that you have not given the version number of the port, just 
its name. pkg_delete will remove any software containing the name you specify—in this example, any 
software containing “dillo”. 
 
 
Figure 9-15. Using Ports Console and the pkg_delete command to uninstall the dillo package 
In this example, pkg_delete didn’t have any informational messages when it removed the dillo 
package. Sometimes you will see informational messages when you delete a package. You can verify that 
the package did uninstall by running pkg_info, as seen in Figure 9-15. 
pkg_delete will not let you delete a package if another application needs it. Figure 9-16 shows an 
example of this. In this example, dillo is still installed and I tried to uninstall the wget package that 
installed with the dillo package as a dependency. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ FREEBSD PACKAGES 
 
235 
 
Figure 9-16. pkg_delete will not let you uninstall software needed by another application 
If you receive an error message that “no packages match pattern(s)”, double-check that you don’t 
have a typo in your pkg_delete command. If the command looks good, use pkg_info to double-check 
that the package you are trying to uninstall is indeed installed. 
Summary 
This chapter introduced you to the FreeBSD ports collection and demonstrated how to work with 
FreeBSD packages. While FreeBSD packages are fairly easy to work with, they do require you to use 
command-line utilities and to occasionally deal with error messages. The Ports Console provided on 
your PC-BSD system means that you can experiment with FreeBSD packages without worrying about 
messing up the software that came with your operating system. 
The next chapter is definitely for power users as it will show you how to build your own customized 
applications. If that sounds like fun, read on! If it sounds a bit intimidating, skip to Chapter 11, in which 
we will introduce you to the PC-BSD community.

FreeBSD Ports 
Chapter 9 introduced you to Ports Console, which provides a safe environment for installing software 
that has been ported to FreeBSD on your PC-BSD system. Chapter 9 also demonstrated how to find, 
install, and manage FreeBSD packages. Although FreeBSD packages are managed from the command 
line, they are relatively easy to use and are considered the recommended way to install additional 
software that is not currently available within the PBI system. 
This chapter teaches you how to compile and manage FreeBSD ports.
1 This chapter is intended for 
power users who want to customize their software applications. Much of the information in Chapter 9 
applies to this chapter as well. For example, you can use FreshPorts to find the software you would like 
to compile, you still issue all of the commands within Ports Console, and pkg_info will tell you what was 
installed. However, you will use the make command to compile and install FreeBSD ports instead of the 
pkg_add command. 
Package or Port? 
If you’re wondering whether you should install the package or compile a port for a given piece of 
software, you probably want to install the package. If you find yourself compiling ports without passing 
any make targets (that will make more sense as this chapter progresses), you definitely should be 
installing the package instead of compiling the port. Packages provide several advantages over ports: 
• 
They are quick to install. With the exception of very large packages such as KDE or 
GNOME, most packages install in under a few minutes. Depending on the number 
of dependencies and your hardware, the same port may take several hours to 
compile. 
• 
If you aren’t customizing the port, you will end up with the same binary as the 
package would have installed, meaning you needlessly waited longer to install the 
software on your system. 
                                                 
 
1 See www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html for further information 
about managing ports. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
238 
However, at times you do want to install the port, when, for example, the following occur: 
• 
A package is not available. 
• 
You want to compile a binary with a known security vulnerability.  
• 
You want to override a license restriction. For example, the license may allow you 
to compile the binary for personal use but does not allow the FreeBSD project (an 
organization) to distribute the binary package. 
• 
You need to customize the options that are compiled into the binary; this is often 
done with server applications such as Apache or PostgreSQL. 
What is Compiling a Port?  
So what exactly is compiling a port? Software applications are created from source code,
2 or text files 
written in a programming language. Those files are considered human readable, at least for those 
humans who understand the syntax of the programming language used. The source code must be 
converted into a form that the computer understands by using a program known as a compiler; the end 
result is the binary executable of the program. When compiling a FreeBSD port, you use the following 
components: 
• 
The gcc
3 compiler.  
• 
The make
4 program to manage the dependencies that are needed when a binary is 
compiled.  
• 
A Makefile that contains all of the instructions needed to compile the FreeBSD 
port. 
• 
A directory structure, known as the ports tree, containing a subdirectory for each 
port. Each subdirectory includes the port’s Makefile, a working area, any needed 
patches, the post-installation message, the package description, and the 
checksums for the archive containing the source code.  
gcc and make were installed with your PC-BSD system. However, before you can compile any ports, 
you have to install the ports directory structure.

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
239 
■ Caution Remember, all of the commands in this chapter need to be run from Ports Console to ensure that you 
are working within the safe environment of the ports jail. 
Installing the Ports Collection 
To install the ports collection, choose Kickoff ➤ System Settings ➤ System Manager. After inputting the 
administrative password, click the Tasks tab, as seen in Figure 10-1. In the Ports Console section, click 
Fetch Ports Tree. 
 
 
Figure 10-1. Installing the FreeBSD ports collection from System Manager to Ports Console 
Note that this operation will take some time because the ports collection is a very large tar file that 
needs to be downloaded and untarred to /usr/ports. 
 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
240 
What Does a Port Contain? 
This section will familiarize you with the contents and layout of the ports directory structure. After you 
have the ports collection, open Ports Console and become the superuser. Figure 10-2 shows a listing of 
/usr/ports/. 
 
 
Figure 10-2. Contents of /usr/ports/ 
The files and directories highlighted by the yellow square contain the information needed for the 
ports collection to work. If you are interested in the inner workings of the FreeBSD ports process, read 
Mk/bsd.port.mk (the master file used by the ports system). You will also find useful information in man 
ports. 
The remainder of the listing is composed of directories that represent the same categories found at 
FreshPorts. If you list a directory, you’ll find that it contains subdirectories. Each subdirectory represents 
a port that can be compiled, and it contains all of the information needed to compile that port. Figure 
10-3 shows a listing of the /usr/ports/databases/couchdb directory. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
241 
 
Figure 10-3. Contents of a port subdirectory 
This directory contains the following: 
Makefile: Contains the instructions
5 make needs to compile the application. 
distinfo: Contains the MD5 and SHA256 checksums, the size, and the name of 
the archive containing the source code that will be fetched from the Internet. 
For security reasons, the ports system will refuse to fetch an archive that 
doesn’t match the information in this file. 
files: This directory contains patches the software requires to compile. 
pkg-descr: Contains the description of the software. pkg_info
6 -d can also be 
used to display the contents of this file. 
pkg-install: Optional script used during the installation. pkg_info -i can also be 
used to display the contents of this file. 
 
 
 
                                                 
 
5 A Makefile’s contents are described in more detail in www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/porters-
handbook/book.html#MAKEFILE. 
6 man pkg_info is well worth reading. Try each of its switches to discover which are useful to you. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
242 
pkg-message: Optional message (usually containing post-installation 
configuration information) that will be displayed at the end of the installation. 
If you missed the message or wish to reread it, you can find it here. pkg_info -D 
can also be used to display the contents of this file. 
pkg-plist: Contains the paths to the files that are installed with the application. 
/usr/local is assumed to be at the beginning of each path. For example, if the 
file gives a location of bin/couchdb, the actual path is /usr/local/bin/couchdb. 
Let’s compare this information to Figure 10-4, which shows the CVSWeb page for couchdb at 
FreshPorts. 
 
 
Figure 10-4. CVSWeb for /usr/ports/databases/couchdb 
Note that FreshPorts contains the same files, enabling you to research your ports online before 
compiling them. CVSWeb has an added advantage in that it shows the entire history for each file. For 
example, if you click the Makefile link, you will see a history of the Makefile for every version of the port, 
along with the commit messages that indicate which changes were made and when. If you want to see 
only the current Makefile, click on the number in the Rev. (revision) column instead—in this example, 
the Makefile is at revision 1.7. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
243 
make Targets 
To compile a port, simply cd to its subdirectory and type make. Wait until the messages stop, and if all 
goes well, you’ll receive your prompt back without any errors.  
To understand what actually happened and how you can customize what happens, you should 
know a bit about make targets. Targets are the words that follow the make command. The most 
commonly used targets
7 are summarized in Table 10-1. Note that targets are optional but very useful. For 
example, if you just type make, the port will compile, but it won’t install unless you add the install target 
(that is, type make install). 
Table 10-1. Useful make Targets 
Target 
Description 
clean 
make will create a work subdirectory when you compile a port. This target tells make to 
remove that directory before returning your prompt. Use the clean-depends target if you 
also want to clean out the work directory for each dependency. 
config 
Some ports provide a menu of options that enable you to choose which features to compile 
into the application (see Figure 10-5 for an example). Your original selection is saved in a 
subdirectory of /var/db/ports/. If you want to change your selection, use this target to access 
the port’s menu screen. Use the config- recursive target if you want to see all the menus for 
each dependency. 
deinstall If you try to install a port that is already installed, you will receive an error message. Use this 
target first to uninstall the port. For example: make deinstall && make install. 
fetch 
This target downloads the source code and patches for the port but does not compile 
anything. The source code will be saved to /usr/ports/distfiles/. Use fetch-recursive if you 
want to also fetch the source for the port’s dependencies. 
install 
This target tells make to install the files listed in pkg-plist to their locations in /usr/local/. 
This can take some time because they need to be compiled first. 
package 
Creates a FreeBSD package in the current directory (the file will end in .tbz). This is useful if 
you need to install the same software on multiple machines because you have to compile it 
only once. If you would like to compile all of the package’s dependencies as well, use the 
package-recursive target instead. 
 
Figure 10-5 shows the configuration options for /usr/ports/www/apache22. Those options with an 
X will be compiled into the application. Use your arrow key to highlight an option and the Enter key to 
toggle between X and a blank. When finished, use the Tab key to jump to OK and press Enter. 
                                                 
 
7 The complete list of targets is listed in /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk and man ports. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
244 
 
Figure 10-5. Example options menu for the apache22 port 
■ Tip If you run make config-recursive and don’t receive any menus, you might as well save yourself some time 
and install the package because there isn’t anything to customize for that port. 
The TARGETS section of man ports indicates that some targets build upon each other in order. For 
example, make install is equivalent to make config fetch checksum depends extract patch configure 
build install. In other words, if you use a target within that ordered list, it will “automagically” include 
all of the targets that precede it. This means that if you type make config, make will only display the 
port’s options menu, if it exists. It will not fetch or build any source because those targets come after the 
config target. However, if you type make install, make will go through all of the targets, starting with 
config, then fetch, all the way up to install. 
You may have noticed that each category directory also has a Makefile. This means that you could (if 
you had a lot of time) install every port in that category by typing make install. For example, to build all 
www ports, issue the command cd /usr/ports/www && make install. 
■ Tip make reads only the Makefile in the current directory. If there is no Makefile in your current directory, 
make will give the error “make: no target to make.” This means you should cd to the desired directory and try 
again. 
There are make targets that are useful within a category directory or the /usr/ports/ directory itself. 
One is make readmes, which creates a local HTML copy of the specified ports structure. Figure 10-6 
shows the resulting web page from running the make readmes command from the /usr/ports/ directory. 
You can click on each category to see a listing of its ports. 
 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
245 
 
Figure 10-6. /usr/ports/README.html generated from typing make readmes at /usr/ports/ 
Another useful target to use from /usr/ports/ is search. The first time you run make search, you 
may be asked to run make fetchindex first. Figure 10-7 shows the results from running make search 
name=youtube | more from /usr/ports/. 
 
 
Figure 10-7. make search results 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
246 
The name= keyword in this command tells make to search for port names matching your search 
pattern. The search results will show the following: 
Port: The name and version of the port 
Path: The port’s location within the ports directory 
Info: A one-line description of the port 
Maint: The e-mail address of the port’s maintainer 
B-deps: The names and version numbers of the dependencies required to build 
the port 
R-deps: The names and version numbers of the dependencies required to run 
the application compiled by the port 
WWW: The URL to the website for the software 
■ Tip If you are interested in seeing only the Port, Path, and Info sections, use make quicksearch name= 
instead. 
Troubleshooting Errors 
Like packages, ports have been pretested for you and should compile on your system without errors. 
Occasionally you will receive an error message indicating that the port did not compile. If you receive 
the error almost immediately, one of the variables in Table 10-2 is probably set in the port’s Makefile. 
Table 10-2. Makefile Variables You Should Be Aware Of 
Variable 
Description 
BROKEN= 
This line in the Makefile will indicate the reason why the port is considered 
broken. You should probably look for a newer version or another port with 
similar functionality as this port is waiting for the maintainer to fix the problem. 
CONFLICTS= 
The Makefile will indicate which application the port conflicts with. If you 
uninstall the conflicting software, the error will disappear. 
DEPRECATED= 
This won’t stop the compile but will give the message “This port is deprecated; 
you may wish to reconsider installing it.” This typically means that there is a 
newer version of the port that you should be using instead. 
EXPIRATION_DATE= This won’t result in an error, but you should check for this in a Makefile. If this 
line exists, consider another version of the port or a similar port because this one 
will be disappearing soon. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
247 
Variable 
Description 
FORBIDDEN= 
The Makefile will indicate why the port is forbidden. 
RESTRICTED= 
This won’t result in an error, but you should read the message if this line is in the 
Makefile because it may indicate a patent or license restriction that affects your 
use or distribution of the application. 
 
Of course, you can remove the offending variable from the Makefile to force the port to compile, but 
that won’t change the underlying reason for including the variable. 
If you receive a “Couldn’t fetch it - please try to retrieve this port manually into /usr/ports/distfiles/ 
and try again” error, double-check your Internet connection and try again. 
■ Note Ports Console assumes you are running the default pf firewall. If you have disabled pf, you will have to 
type pfctl -ef /etc/pf.conf in Konsole in order to have Internet connectivity within Ports Console. 
If your error does not seem to be connected with the Makefile or Internet connectivity, try googling 
the error message to see if there is a known fix. Or try installing another version of the port. If you’re still 
not having any luck, send an e-mail to the FreeBSD ports mailing list.
8 If this is your first e-mail to the 
list, be sure to read How to Get Best Results from the FreeBSD-Questions Mailing List
9 first as the 
information it contains applies to all of the FreeBSD mailing lists. 
Keeping the Ports Tree Updated 
The ports collection is constantly being updated, with new ports being added daily, broken ports being 
fixed (and sometimes working ports becoming broken), and ports being updated to newer versions of 
the software. The csup utility enables you to sync with the current version of the ports tree whenever you 
wish.
10 In order to use csup, you need a configuration file. A well-commented configuration file is located 
in /usr/share/examples/cvsup/ports-supfile. If this is your first time using csup, take the time to read 
through the comments in the example file because they explain the meaning of each line in the file. 
Figure 10-8 demonstrates a customized configuration file saved as /root/cvs-supfile, as well as the csup 
command used to connect to the specified mirror (in this case, cvsup.FreeBSD.org) to sync the local 
ports tree with the latest release version (RELENG_8) of the ports tree.

Figure 10-8. Using csup and a custom configuration file to update the local ports collection 
Once connected, csup will compare the files on the mirror with your local copy of the ports 
collection and will download only the files that have changed or are missing. 
■ Tip Power users who would like to keep their ports tree updated on a regular basis should consider adding that 
csup -L2 command to their crontab within Ports Console.  
Updating Ports  
If you keep your ports tree up-to-date with csup, you can use the portupgrade application to update 
your installed ports to their latest versions. But first you need to know which ports have newer versions. 
In this section, you’ll create a notification script and then learn how to use portupgrade. 
Creating Your Own Notification Script  
Although PC-BSD’s Software Manager won’t tell you when newer versions of FreeBSD ports or packages 
are available, it is easy to create a custom script to do this for you. First, you should install some useful 
packages by using pkg_add: 
portaudit: Used to compare your installed software to the VuXML database of 
software vulnerabilities. (Chapter 9 discussed VuXML.) 
portupgrade: Used to upgrade both your installed ports and packages to their 
latest versions. 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
249 
Figure 10-9 shows an example script, and Figure 10-10 shows the results of running the script. 
 
 
Figure 10-9. Custom script to determine which software has a newer version available 
 
 
Figure 10-10. Results of running custom script 

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
250 
In this example, none of the installed software has any known security vulnerabilities, as portaudit 
indicates “0 problem(s) in your installed packages found.” If there was a known vulnerability, portaudit 
would have displayed the name of the software and a description of the vulnerability. Two ports, 
however, need upgrading: portaudit and ruby. 
Using portupgrade  
If you have software that needs updating, you can use portupgrade to upgrade it. It doesn’t matter 
whether you installed the software from a package or compiled it from a port—it can still be upgraded. 
Table 10-3 shows the most common switches used with portupgrade. See man portupgrade for a 
description of all available switches. 
Table 10-3. Commonly Used portupgrade Switches 
Switch 
Description 
a 
Upgrade all installed software that has a newer version. Otherwise, specify the name of the 
software to upgrade. 
b 
Make a backup package of the old version. This is very handy should something go wrong 
and you need to revert to the original version. You’ll find the package in 
/usr/ports/packages/All. 
n 
Allows you to do a “dry run” as it creates a report of what would be upgraded without 
actually upgrading anything.  
P 
First tries to upgrade by using a package, meaning the upgrade process will be quicker if a 
package is available. If there is no package, portupgrade will compile the port. 
r 
Also upgrades any software that depends on the software being upgraded. 
R 
Also upgrades any software required by the software being upgraded. 
 
portupgrade switches can be stacked, and order does not matter unless the switch requires that it is 
followed by a variable (add those switches and their variables individually after your stacked switches). 
For example, you can type portupgrade -an instead of portupgrade -a -n. It is recommended that you 
always include -rR to make sure all dependent software is also upgraded. If you don’t, over time you may 
run into dependency issues. It is also recommended that you include -b just in case something goes 
wrong. If you have problems with the new software, use pkg_delete to uninstall the new version and 
pkg_add to install the backed-up package of the original software.  

CHAPTER 10 ■ FREEBSD PORTS 
 
251 
■ Caution Never upgrade a port without first reading /usr/ports/UPDATING to see if there are any known gotchas 
or upgrade hints for that software. Always follow any instructions in this file that apply to the software you are 
trying to upgrade. 
The upgrade process usually goes like this: 
1. 
Use your notification script to get the latest version of the ports tree and ports 
index and to determine which software is vulnerable or has a newer version. 
2. 
Decide whether you want to upgrade all of your outdated software or only a 
specific application. 
3. 
Read /usr/ports/UPDATING to see whether there are any special instructions 
for the software you wish to upgrade. 
4. 
If you have customized configuration files for the software being updated (for 
example, a customized httpd.conf for Apache), make sure you have a backup 
of those files. 
5. 
Run a command such as portupgrade -abrR to upgrade all software, or 
portupgrade -brR name_of_software to upgrade only the specified software. 
Your software upgrade should “just work.” If you run across an error, double-check your Internet 
connectivity, check that you didn’t miss anything in /usr/ports/UPDATING, or try googling the error. 
You can also try waiting a day or so and rerunning csup because sometimes a missing patch will be 
added to the ports tree. On the off chance that the new version doesn’t work, you’ll be glad that you 
saved a backup package of the old version. This last scenario is rare, but it is always best to be safe rather 
than sorry! 
Uninstalling a Port  
To uninstall a port, cd into its directory and type make deinstall. FreshPorts or pkg_info -ox will tell you 
the port’s location in the ports tree.  
Alternately, you can delete the port by using pkg_delete. Either way, you can then use pkg_info to 
verify that the software has been uninstalled. 
■ Caution The pkg_delete command will not let you uninstall software that is required by other applications. 
However, make deinstall will. If you’re worried about inadvertently uninstalling dependencies, use pkg_delete 
instead.

Summary 
This chapter covered the basics of the FreeBSD ports system. Power users seeking additional 
information should read through the resources mentioned in the footnotes of this chapter. This chapter 
also concludes the “Software” section of this book. The next section deals with community, and Chapter 
11 will introduce you to the PC-BSD community.

Getting Help 
At the beginning of this book, we mentioned that PC-BSD is more than an operating system. It is also a 
community of other PC-BSD users who share their tips and tricks, answer questions, and discuss which 
features and applications they want to see added to PC-BSD. In other words, this community of other 
PC-BSD users is an excellent resource when you are looking for help with your PC-BSD system. 
Learning how to effectively interact with a community is a lot like learning how to use your 
operating system. Some things might seem strange at first and you will have to learn some basic skills. 
But as you become more comfortable with how things are done, it becomes easier, and you even start to 
have some fun. And over time you find yourself showing others how to do things. 
This chapter begins by introducing you to netiquette, the rules of the road that will help you get the 
most out of any online community. It will then concentrate on the various resources that are available to 
you through the PC-BSD community. 
What Is Netiquette? 
If you’ve ever been the new kid at a school or a new employee at a large company, you know what it is 
like to be a stranger in an existing community. Somehow you have to introduce yourself, figure out any 
unwritten rules of conduct, learn how to fit in, and discover who your friends are and what authority to 
go to when you need help with something.  
Interacting with an online community, such as the PC-BSD community, is similar, but there are a 
few differences. For one, most of your interactions are online, meaning you rarely (if ever) meet the 
people you interact with in person. Second, community members can live anywhere in the world and 
represent a mix of age, gender, economic and educational backgrounds, and cultures. Third, English is 
not everyone’s first language. Add these factors up and there is opportunity for misunderstood 
communications. For example, was a response rude, written in a hurry, written by someone who  
wasn’t sure how to say a phrase in English, or written by a usually nice person who happened to be 
having a bad day?  
Netiquette
1 is a set of conventions designed to help reduce the number of online 
miscommunications. Just like etiquette teaches you not to talk with your mouth full and not to interrupt 
others while they are talking, netiquette teaches you the proper way to behave and respond when you 
are communicating with others online. 
                                                 
 
1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netiquette 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
256 
Netiquette also reminds everyone how to deal with new people in a community. If you are that new 
person, netiquette helps you to start off on the right foot rather than irritate the other people in the 
community. If you see a new person, netiquette reminds you to welcome them and get them oriented so 
that they can start to fit in. 
While every community will have its own set of conventions, there are some universal rules of 
netiquette, including the following: 
Use the proper method of communication: Every community provides 
multiple ways for members to communicate with each other. Some 
communication methods are very technical and formal, while others are 
informal and chatty. It is your job to figure out which is which and to 
communicate using the expected tone and technical level. This chapter 
introduces you to all the PC-BSD communication channels and what you can 
expect from each. 
Do your homework before posting a technical question: If you have a 
problem with your system, there is a very good chance that someone else has 
already asked the same question and received the answer. In an online 
community, all these questions and answers are saved on the Internet, so you 
should research your question first.  
Don’t be rude: No one wants to deal with a rude person, and you don’t want to 
inadvertently be rude. If a community has a set of rules they ask you to read 
before asking a question
2 and you don’t follow those rules, you are being rude. 
Rude questions are usually ignored, but sometimes they get a nasty answer in 
reply. If this is happening to you, check your original question. 
Be helpful: People do not want to be ignored, especially when they are looking 
for help. If you see an unanswered question that you know the answer to, 
respond.  
Don’t assume malice: If you see a nasty response, don’t send a nasty reply. 
That type of interaction can escalate badly into something known as a flame 
war.
3 Perhaps the original response was misunderstood; if you think that is the 
case, privately ask the person if they meant to be rude. Perhaps the original 
response was from a troll
4 trying to stir up trouble. In that case, the best 
response is to ignore it. 
Report inappropriate behavior: Occasionally someone will post a sexist or 
racist remark that is intended to hurt others. The best response is to send the 
details to a leader within the community. The leader will contact the person 
privately to see whether the remark was intentional and will remove that person 
from the community, if necessary.

4 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
257 
 
Keep these rules in mind whenever you participate in any online community. 
Now that you know some netiquette, let’s see what resources are available within the PC-BSD 
community. 
PC-BSD Forums  
Probably the best place for a new user to start is at the PC-BSD forums. The forums don’t require you to 
install any additional software because they are accessed using your web browser. They make it easy to 
search for an answer, ask a question, and answer a question. Additionally, there are many forums to 
choose from, ranging from nontechnical and informal to very technical and informative.  
The PC-BSD forums are located at http://forums.pcbsd.org, as seen in Figure 11-1.  
 
 
Figure 11-1. PC-BSD forums 
The forums are categorized and described on the main forums page. If you are brand new to 
forums, take a moment to read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) in the upper-right corner. If you 
have a specific question you need answered, use the Search hyperlink in the upper-right corner to see 
whether an answer is already available. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
258 
The forums are categorized as follows: 
General: These forums are suited to anyone. They include nontechnical forums 
such as Announcements (in which new PC-BSD versions and promotions are 
announced), The Lounge (in which you can discuss just about anything), and 
forums in which you can share your PC-BSD–related pictures and screenshots. 
They also contain technical forums aimed at users, in which you can ask 
general questions, learn new tips and tricks, and read various how-to guides. 
PC-BSD Software: These forums are for everything related to PBIs. If you’d like 
to see your favorite software turned into a PBI, add it to the Package Wishlist. 
There are also forums in which you can see which PBIs are ready for testing and 
which have been approved. If you have problems with a PBI, check out the 
Other PBI Discussion forum. 
Support: This is the first place to look if you’re having problems with your PC-
BSD system. There are forums that deal with installation or problems with 
FreeBSD. Advanced users can post and review installation or general bug 
reports. If you find that something doesn’t work like it should, take a look at the 
Usage Bug Reports forum. 
Hardware Support: If you’re having problems with your video card, sound, 
networking, removable media, or laptop, you’ll find that each has its own 
forum. There is also a General Support forum for miscellaneous hardware 
issues. 
Development: Chapter 12 will discuss in more detail how you can get involved 
in the development of PC-BSD. There are forums for those who want to assist in 
the creation of PBIs, Documentation, Translations, the PC-BSD Installer, 
Bluetooth Manager, or who are interested in general programming of the PC-
BSD operating system. Any user can contribute their Feature Requests. 
International: Contains forums in which you can discuss PC-BSD in Spanish, 
French, or German. 
Think of a forum as a discussion area that contains a list of discussions (also known as topics). 
Anyone can read or search a discussion. If you register and log in, you can also add (or post) to an 
existing discussion or start a new discussion. 
If you click a category, you will see the topics in that category with the most recent listed first, as 
seen in Figure 11-2. 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
259 
 
Figure 11-2. Most-recently-discussed topics in the PC-BSD Announcements forum 
Each discussion has a topic title, the username of the person (author) who started the topic, the 
number of replies and views, the name of the user who last responded to the topic, and the date of the 
last response. Click the topic title to view the entire discussion, including all the replies. 
Before replying to or starting a new topic, it is recommended that you spend some time reading the 
topics in the forums that interest you. This will give you a good idea of the tone used in each forum. 
You’ll also get to see which types of questions get good answers and which get ignored—knowing this 
can help you to write better questions when asking for help. 
Creating or Responding to a Post 
Before posting a question, search the forums first. There is a very good chance that your question has 
already been answered. If you find that someone has already asked the question but did not get an 
answer, reply to the same post, indicating that you have the same problem, and if appropriate, add any 
additional information that will help others diagnose your problem. There are a few things to keep in 
mind before creating a post: 
Choose a descriptive topic name: A topic name such as “HELP ME!!!!” will not 
get a useful answer for several reasons. One, using all caps is known as shouting 
and is considered to be rude. Two, readers will assume that you if you haven’t 
taken the time to come up with a good topic name, you also haven’t bothered 
to research your problem. A topic name that lists the error message, such as “no 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
260 
dump device defined”, makes the topic easy to find for other users who are 
experiencing the same error message. If there’s no particular error, use a 
descriptive topic name such as “will PC-BSD install on a Thinkpad T42 
laptop?”. Again, this will make it easier for other users who are wondering the 
same thing to find the topic. 
Include the necessary information: This will show others that you have taken 
the time to do your homework before asking the question. It will also give them 
context so that they can understand your problem and offer an appropriate 
answer. 
To create a new discussion (e.g., ask a question), look for the category that best matches the topic of 
your discussion. Click the category name and then the New Topic button. To reply to an existing 
discussion, click the Reply button within the discussion. You have to be logged in to perform these 
functions and will be prompted for your username and password if you are not. If you don’t have a 
username yet, click the Register hyperlink to create one so you can log in. Figure 11-3 provides a 
screenshot of what you see if you click New Topic within the General Questions forum. 
 
 
Figure 11-3. Posting a new topic to the General Questions forum 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
261 
Type your descriptive topic name in the Subject area and the message itself into the Message body 
section. The controls around the Message body area allow you to select the font color, provide buttons 
for formatting text, and display the available emoticons
5 (smilies).  
■ Tip Emoticons can be useful to let people know your intent if it is not obvious from the text; if you are making a 
joke, for example. However, they should be used sparingly, especially in a formal or very technical forum because 
they might detract from your text and irritate some users. 
Several advanced options are also available for your post. They are described in detail in the phpBB 
User Guide;
6 phpBB is the software used by the PC-BSD forums. It is a good idea to preview your post to 
double-check for typos and ensure that it includes all the information other users need. If you need to 
save a draft of your post while you further research your question, click Save. The post won’t actually be 
posted to the forum until you click Submit. 
User Control Panel 
Once logged in, extra hyperlinks will be added to the top of the forums page, as seen in Figure 11-4. 
 
 
Figure 11-4. Extra settings for a logged-in user

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
262 
The User Control Panel, located in the upper-right corner, is seen in Figure 11-5. 
 
 
Figure 11-5. User Control Panel at the PC-BSD forums 
You should review the Options panel on the left side; it allows you to configure and view the 
following: 
Overview: Allows you to view and remove your subscriptions and bookmarks. 
You will find links that allow you to subscribe to or bookmark a forum or topic 
near the New Topic button within the forum or topic. If you subscribe, you will 
be notified whenever there is an update to the forum or topic you have 
subscribed to. This can be very handy if you ask a question and are waiting for 
an answer. Bookmarks won’t notify you when there is a change, but they are a 
handy way to quickly access topics that you find useful. If you have a message 
that you saved as a draft or if you have uploaded any files, you can also access 
them here. 
 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
263 
Profile: Here you can control what other users see when they click your 
username. You can add your contact information, provide text (known as a 
signature) that will show at the bottom of all your posts, add your avatar (the 
image associated with your username), and change your e-mail address or 
password. 
Board preferences: Here you can configure whether other users are allowed to 
contact you as well as how you want posts to be displayed in your browser. 
Private messages: Provides an area in which you can e-mail other forum users. 
Usergroups: Allows you to view which group(s) you belong to.  
Friends & Foes: If you add another user to your friends list, you can quickly 
verify their online/offline status and send them a direct message from User 
Control Panel. If you add a foe, any of their forum posts will be hidden  
from you.  
PC-BSD Wiki  
The PC-BSD wiki is another source of information and is available at http://wiki.pcbsd.org. Figure 11-6 
shows a snapshot of this site. 
 
 
Figure 11-6. PC-BSD wiki 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
264 
Consider the wiki as a read-only source of documentation that has been divided into general User 
Documentation and more advanced Developer Documentation. If you didn’t find what you were 
looking for on the PC-BSD forums, the information might be located here. The listed topics do contain 
useful information and are well worth reading. You can also use the search box to search for specific 
keywords. 
While it is possible to create a login account in order to modify the wiki contents, only members of 
the documentation team should do so. If you are interested in helping with PC-BSD documentation, 
Chapter 12 will show you how to introduce yourself and work with the documentation team.  
■ Caution Don’t make a change unless you are familiar with wiki formatting (described in the User’s Guide link at 
the bottom of the page) and you have first discussed the edits with the PC-BSD documentation team. 
PC-BSD IRC Channel  
What do you do if you need an answer right away or want to talk to someone in “real time” instead of 
waiting for someone to respond to a forum post? You can try using the PC-BSD
7 Internet Relay Chat 
(IRC) channel. Just as forums are divided into categories, IRC provides areas in which it is appropriate to 
talk about a subject with other people who are interested in that subject. Similar to forums, some areas 
are very technical while others are more informal. 
IRC Fundamentals  
IRC uses several components:  
• 
Servers, located somewhere on the Internet. PC-BSD uses the servers located at 
Freenode.net. 
• 
A client application, installed on your system. Clients can be graphical or 
command-line–based. A list of PC-BSD IRC clients is available at http://pbidir. 
com/bt/category/chat-im. A list of FreeBSD IRC clients is available at 
www.freshports.org/irc. 
• 
An IRC nick (username). This is the name that represents you on the IRC network, 
so it should create the impression you want to make, especially if you plan to 
participate in formal or highly technical channels. For example, “dlavigne” is 
probably a more useful nick than “xenawarriorprincess” or “iluvmypoodle”. 
 
 
                                                 
 
7 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
265 
• 
An IRC channel. Think of a channel as a virtual room where users interested in 
that topic can chat with each other. The PC-BSD channel is called #pcbsd. 
• 
IRC commands. These are listed at 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_commands. 
If you are new to IRC, consider starting with a graphical IRC client because it will allow you to use 
IRC right away without having to learn the syntax of the IRC commands first. The next section will 
demonstrate the use of the Pidgin client. 
Configuring Pidgin for IRC 
Pidgin
8 is an easy-to-use, graphical client that supports many chat protocols. It can be installed as a PBI, 
as described in Chapter 8. Figure 11-7 shows the screen you see the first time you start Pidgin and click 
the +Add button to add an IRC account. 
 
 
Figure 11-7. Pidgin welcome screen 
Click AIM to access the drop-down Protocol menu. Select IRC and it will automatically fill in the 
correct server name of irc.freenode.net.  
                                                 
 
8 www.pidgin.im/ 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
266 
■ Tip Pidgin supports many chat protocols such as Google Talk, MSN, and Yahoo Messenger. You can add the 
account information for each type of chat network in which you want to participate. 
Type in the username and password that you want to use for your nick. If you check the Remember 
password box, you won’t have to type your password every time you start Pidgin. Once you click +Add, 
Pidgin will connect to and log you into Freenode. A Buddy List window will open, indicating your status, 
an Accounts window will show your account information, and a Conversation window will open with a 
message from NickServ. These are seen in Figure 11-8. 
■ Tip NickServ is the nickname service bot that IRC uses to register nicknames. 
 
Figure 11-8. Buddy List, Accounts, and Conversation windows in Pidgin 
In this example, the drulavigne account is connected to (Available) the Freenode network, but 
NickServ indicates that this is not a registered nick. It is a good idea to register your nick because some 
channels will not let you join the conversation with an unregistered nick. You also won’t be able to chat 
directly with another user until you register your nick. To register your nick, reply to NickServ by typing 
the following command into the Conversation window: /msg nickserv register password email. 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
267 
Replace password with the password you want to use and email with your e-mail address. NickServ 
will reply with a message indicating that instructions to activate your nick have been sent to that e-mail 
address and that you have a day to complete your registration before your temporary registration 
expires. 
Participating in the Channel 
Once you are connected, you will want to chat with someone other than NickServ. You do so by joining a 
channel. In the Buddy List window, click Buddies ➤ Join a Chat. To join the PC-BSD channel, type 
#pcbsd into the Channel bar and press Enter or click the Join button.  
■ Tip The # is important. If you forget to put it at the beginning of the channel name, your command will fail and 
you will see a “No such channel” error message. 
If you want the channel to show in your Buddy List window, use Buddies ➤ +Add Chat instead. This 
menu provides an extra option of autojoining the channel when you open Pidgin. If you don’t select 
autojoin, you can join the chat at any time by clicking its name in your Buddy List. Both menus provide a 
Room List button which will list all available channels on Freenode. If one interests you, right-click it to 
either Join or Add it to your Buddy List. 
Once you’ve joined a channel, a new tab with the channel name will appear in the Conversation 
window, as seen in Figure 11-9. You can join as many channels as you want, and each will appear in its 
own tab. To leave a channel, simply close the tab by clicking the x in the tab. 
 
 
Figure 11-9. #pcbsd channel in the Pidgin Conversation window 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
268 
Most channels have a welcome message that might indicate which topics are suitable as well as any 
resources that new channel users should be aware of. The PC-BSD welcome message reminds you that 
you should check the wiki first if you’re looking for the answer to a commonly asked question.  
The Conversation window is divided into several sections: 
Left pane: Contains the conversation. By default, each comment in the 
conversation begins with the nick of the person who wrote it and the time it was 
posted. You can use the scroll bar to scroll through the conversation. Use 
Conversation ➤ Clear Scrollback if you want to erase the conversation so far. 
Right pane: Displays the number of users in the channel and their nicknames. 
If your nick is registered, you can double-click another user’s nick to start a 
private conversation (also known as a direct message [DM]) in a new tab. Right-
click the name to send them a file, ignore them, get information about their 
nick, or add them to your Buddy List. 
■ Caution It is considered rude to DM a person who does not know you. If you have a question and don’t know 
anyone in the channel, introduce yourself and ask if anyone has a moment to help you. 
Bottom pane: This is where you type your message. It won’t appear in the 
conversation window until you press Enter. 
■ Tip If you’re pasting an error message, paste only a line or so at a time. If you paste too much information at 
once, the server will kick you out of the channel. 
It’s not a bad idea to lurk (watch the conversation without responding) in a new channel to get a feel 
for how chatty the channel is and the tone of most conversations. If the channel is quiet, introduce 
yourself. You might find that you already “know” some of the users from the PC-BSD forums; you might 
also make some new friends. 
The Pidgin application is quite customizable. You can toggle logging, sounds, formatting toolbars, 
and timestamps off or on in the Options menu of the Conversation window. The Tools menu in the 
Buddy List contains Plugins and Preferences menus with many more options. The Pidgin User Guide
9 is

PC-BSD Mailing Lists 
Mailing lists provide another way to interact with other users. Some users are more comfortable using e-
mail and prefer mailing lists to online forums. Other users prefer to have messages arrive in their inbox 
rather than having to search the forums. You’ll often find that when you google a question, the answer is 
found on a mailing list. A mailing list is simply a list of users—when a user on the list sends an e-mail to 
the list, everyone gets a copy. 
The PC-BSD community has several mailing lists at www.pcbsd.org/content/view/22/29/. Like the 
PC-BSD forums, each mailing list is designed for specific discussion topics: 
Announcements: A read-only list that informs you when new versions of PC-
BSD become available. 
General: A general discussion list for topics that don’t match any of the other 
mailing lists. 
Support: If you have a specific problem you need help with, this is the list to ask 
your question. 
Translations: The list translation team members use to discuss their 
translation work. 
PBI Developers: The list PBI developers use to discuss their PBI work. 
Documentation Contributors: The list documentation team members use to 
discuss documentation changes. 
Developers: The list PC-BSD developers use to discuss their work. 
Beta Testers: Anyone interested in testing beta
10 versions of PC-BSD should 
report the errors they come across here. 
If you click a mailing list name, you will get more information about the list, as seen in Figure 11-10.

Figure 11-10. Information page for PC-BSD General mailing list 
Each list’s information page contains the following sections: 
About: Provides a description of the topics that are suited to this mailing list. If 
you’re unsure, take a look at the list’s Archives to read its discussions—this will 
give you an idea of the appropriate tone and discussion topics for this list. 
Using: Tells you what e-mail address to use when sending a question to the list. 
Subscribing to: This is where you subscribe to the list. By default, you will 
receive a separate e-mail for every post to the list. If you prefer to have all the 
day’s discussions sent in one e-mail, click the Yes button to receive the daily 
digest. 
If you subscribe to the list, an automated e-mail will be sent to the e-mail address you indicated, 
asking you to confirm your subscription request. Once you confirm, another e-mail will be sent, 
indicating that you are now subscribed. This e-mail contains useful information about the list and 
instructions on how to send an e-mail to the list, change your subscription options, or unsubscribe. 
When sending an e-mail to the list, remember to use a useful subject line and to include enough 
information in the message so that other users can help you. Mailing lists have their own netiquette that 
might vary from list to list, so you should read the list’s archives first to get a good feel for what is 
considered acceptable. For example, some lists consider it rude if you write your reply at the beginning 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP

of the previous e-mail (this is called top posting
11). When replying, you should leave enough of the 
original e-mail (this is called quoting) in place so other users know what you are replying to. However, it 
is considered rude to quote a very long e-mail only to add a few words at the bottom. When in doubt, 
watch how others reply to e-mail and make note of what someone else did wrong when another user 
complains about the way they replied to an e-mail. 
Documentation  
The previous sections described several methods of receiving help from the community by interacting 
with other users using the various PC-BSD communication methods. This section describes more-
passive methods of finding the documentation you need. 
PC-BSD FAQ and Knowledge Base 
The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document for any community is always a good document to 
read. As the name suggests, it contains answers to the questions that users ask most frequently. A 
knowledge base is a larger collection of FAQs and other useful information. 
■ Tip FAQs are created to save repeat questions on communication channels. Don’t expect a helpful (or even 
polite) reply if you ask a question that is already answered in the FAQ. Doing so is the equivalent of asking “where 
is the bathroom?” while standing next to a flashing neon sign pointing to the bathroom. It’s embarrassing for you 
and irritating to others. 
The PC-BSD FAQ and Knowledge Base is located at http://faqs.pcbsd.org. Figure 11-11 shows the 
results of clicking the Show all categories hyperlink in the left frame of this website.

If you’re simply browsing for interesting information, read through the entries in the categories that 
interest you. If you’re searching for the answer to a specific question, try using the Search bar. If you’re 
considering asking a question on a forum or mailing list, double-check that it isn’t answered here first. 
PC-BSD Users Handbook  
PC-BSD also provides a Users Handbook that shows you how to accomplish common tasks using PC-
BSD. It is located on the Internet at http://wiki.pcbsd.org/index.php/PC-BSD_Users_Handbook. An icon 
was installed on the desktop so you can quickly access this website. Figure 11-12 shows a screenshot of 
the PC-BSD Users Handbook.

Figure 11-12. PC-BSD Users Handbook 
Reading the Users Handbook is an excellent way to learn new skills. You can sit down and read 
through it like a book, or skip to the sections that interest you at the moment. 
FreeBSD Resources 
Since PC-BSD is FreeBSD under the hood, you can also tap into the wide range of resources that are 
available to FreeBSD users. The FreeBSD Handbook, available at www.freebsd.org/handbook, is the best 
place to start as it demonstrates how to do almost anything on FreeBSD.  
You might also be interested in these other FreeBSD resources: 
FreeBSD FAQ: The FAQ is available at ww.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-
1/books/faq. 
FreeBSD mailing lists: These are listed at 
www.freebsd.org/community/mailinglists.html. 
FreeBSD forums: These can be found at http://forums.freebsd.org. 
 

CHAPTER 11 ■ GETTING HELP 
 
274 
FreeBSD IRC channels: Information about the channels can be found at 
www.freebsd.org/community/irc.html. 
FreeBSD social networks: A variety of FreeBSD-related social networking sites 
are listed at www.freebsd.org/community/social.html. 
Most of the information for FreeBSD also applies to PC-BSD systems. However, some things, such 
as the installer program, are different. If you are unsure whether you should try something you learned 
about from a FreeBSD resource on your PC-BSD system, ask on an appropriate PC-BSD forum, IRC 
channel, or mailing list. 
KDE User Guide 
Because KDE is the default desktop for PC-BSD, you might also find the KDE documentation found at 
http://docs.kde.org/ to be useful. That page provides links to the KDE User Guide and FAQ and 
provides a search function for searching through KDE documentation. Figure 11-13 provides a 
screenshot of the documentation website.

275 
If you click a KDE software package in the left pane (e.g., kdeadmin), it will list all the utilities 
associated with that package. If you click the name of the utility, you can read its guide to learn how to 
get the most out of that KDE utility. KDE comes with a lot of utilities and functionality, so you can spend 
a lot of time here learning how to get the most out of your desktop! If you learn something useful that 
you haven’t seen posted on the forums, consider adding a topic to share your discovery with other PC-
BSD users. 
Community Sites 
If you speak German and want to interact with other users in your native language, check out the 
German-specific community at www.pc-bsd.de. 
Commercial Support 
While this chapter has focused on community, commercial support is still available for PC-BSD through 
iXsystems, http://www.ixsystems.com. Based in the heart of Silicon Valley, iXsystems is a BSD-friendly 
server and storage manufacturer that resulted from an employee buyout of the hardware assets of BSDi, 
the corporation that developed and distributed BSD/OS, the commercial variant of BSD Unix. iXsystems 
has been producing FreeBSD-certified servers and storage solutions in a state-of-the-art production 
facility since the early 1990s. In addition to being a huge proponent for the FreeBSD operating system, 
iXsystems is the corporate sponsor of the PC-BSD operating system, runs the FreeBSD Mall
12, and offers 
Professional Enterprise Support for FreeBSD and PC-BSD.  
iXsystems provides incidental and packaged services, from installation support to system 
configuration to application support. The Support Team helps users set up secure home networks and 
provides assistance with the KDE Desktop Environment as well as with advanced system functions.  
The iXsystems Professional Support Team can also help organizations run PC-BSD with the peace of 
mind of having a fully supported operating system at great savings over closed sourced alternatives. 
From setting up a thin client server to network administration to software development, the experienced 
professionals at iXsystems are available to meet all your organizational needs. 
Summary 
This chapter introduced you to the many resources available to you when you need help with your PC-
BSD system. It also introduced you to the PC-BSD community of users. 
The next chapter will demonstrate ways in which you can become more actively involved within the 
PC-BSD community.

Getting Involved 
Chapter 11 introduced you to the various sources of help within the PC-BSD community. New users 
often start out slowly by reading the various forums and occasionally posting a new topic when they 
have a question they can’t find an answer to. Over time, as you become more familiar with the 
community and how to do things on your PC-BSD system, it is natural to find yourself getting more 
involved. 
This chapter will introduce a variety of ways that anyone can use to give back to the PC-BSD 
community. While reading through this chapter, keep in mind the netiquette you learned in Chapter 11. 
How You Can Help 
It is a common misconception to think that you don’t have anything to contribute, especially if you are 
still learning how to use PC-BSD yourself. You don’t have to be a “guru” or know how to write source 
code to get involved and to help others within the PC-BSD community. Your life experience, what you 
know about PC-BSD so far, and your unique combination of skills and talents are useful to others. A 
community is made out of people, and every person has something to contribute. The more people that 
get involved, the more vibrant the community, and the more the software evolves to meet the needs of 
the people within that community. 
This chapter suggests some of the more common ways to contribute back to the PC-BSD 
community. We suggest ways that are suited to both the novice and more experienced users. We haven’t 
thought of everything, so if you have a good idea not listed here, be sure to bring it up on a FreeBSD 
forum, mailing list, or IRC channel. Better yet, just do it! 
Submitting Feature Requests 
Even if you don’t consider yourself to be a technical user, you still have thoughts about what would be 
useful on your PC-BSD system. Maybe a specific application isn’t available as a PBI, or you find that a 
specific feature is missing or could be improved upon.  
When submitting an application or a feature request, keep in mind that implementing your request 
will require work on the part of another person. This should not deter you, but it should remind you to 
help make the other person’s work as easy as possible. In other words, research your request first and 
give other users all the information they need to understand your request and possibly implement it. 
Chapter 11 introduced you to the PC-BSD forums and how to post to a forum. Two of the forums are 
useful here: Feature Requests and Package Wishlist (discussed in the following sections). 

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
278 
Adding to the Package Wishlist 
Before creating a new topic on the Package Wishlist forum, go through the following checklist for the 
software you want to see made available to PC-BSD users: 
Search pbidir.com: Does a PBI already exist? If so, do you need a newer 
software version? 
Search FreshPorts.org: Does a FreeBSD package/port already exist? If so, you 
want to ask if anyone can convert it to a PBI. 
Search forums.pcbsd.org: Has anyone else made a request yet? If so, you 
should respond to that post after reading any of the previous responses. 
If a topic doesn’t already exist, make sure that your new topic includes the name of the software in 
the subject line so other users can find it easily. Your new forum message should include the following 
information: 
Indicate if a PBI already exists: If so, include the reasons why you need a 
newer version. For example, does the new version introduce new functionality 
that you need, or does the old version have a serious security vulnerability? 
If there is no PBI, indicate if a port/package already exists: It is easier for 
someone else to make the PBI from an existing port/package. Your message 
should also include the URL to the website for the application, a brief 
description of what the software does, and any reasons why you think a PBI 
would be useful to you and other PC-BSD users. 
Requesting a Feature 
If your feature request deals with the operating system, rather than a missing software application, you 
should create a new topic on the Feature Requests forum instead. Don’t forget to search 
forums.pcbsd.org first to see whether someone else has already started a topic. If a topic already exists, 
reply to that topic. If there isn’t a similar topic, create a new topic with a descriptive subject line so other 
users can find your request. 
Some things to keep in mind if you make a feature request: 
Don’t take it personally if no one responds: It might just mean that no one 
else finds that feature useful at this time. Feature implementers might also be 
busy working on a new release of PC-BSD and don’t have time to look at feature 
requests right now. If the feature is important to you, consider discussing it on 
the #pcbsd IRC channel. 
It is okay if others disagree: What is a feature to one person might seem like a 
waste of time and resources to another. Keep the rules of netiquette in mind if 
someone disagrees with your request. And don’t assume that this means that 
your feature won’t be implemented. Sometimes having multiple points of view 
helps in the design of a feature that meets the needs of a wider group of users. 
Don’t assume a feature is too “small” to ask for: Useful features that are 
trivial to implement are often implemented quickly. The developer gets to feel a 
sense of accomplishment and other users end up benefitting from your original 
request. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
279 
Don’t assume a feature is too “big” to ask for: Some features take a lot of 
design work and development time to implement correctly. However, they also 
offer great satisfaction to the developer who tackles the implementation. These 
types of requests often get a response of “great idea” with some sort of timeline 
of when it is realistic to expect the feature to be ready for testing. You can also 
help to test the feature and how to do so is discussed later in this chapter. 
Not all features get implemented: Sometimes there are legal or technical 
restrictions that prevent the feature from being added. Sometimes the feature is 
a great idea, but no one has the time to develop the implementation at this 
time.  
Some features do get implemented: What would be useful to you is often also 
useful to other PC-BSD users. Often developers think “that’s a great idea, why 
didn’t I think of that before?” and are happy to implement the new 
functionality. And you never know if you never ask. 
Submitting Bug Reports 
A software bug
1 occurs when an application acts in an unexpected or incorrect way. Examples include 
receiving an error message when you launch an application or having an application hang when you 
access one of its menu items. 
Before submitting a bug report, use Google to research the problem first. Bugs are fixed by 
developers and they need a way to keep track of which bugs have already been reported, which are being 
worked on, and which have been fixed. Sometimes in order to fix some PC-BSD bugs, something needs 
to be fixed in the underlying FreeBSD operating system or in the KDE desktop. This means that 
information about your bug is probably located outside of the PC-BSD forums, and possibly even 
outside of the PC-BSD community.  
In order for developers to fix a bug, they have to be able to re-create it so they can figure out what 
causes the bug and what exactly needs to be fixed. Occasionally a bug is not a bug at all, but a user error. 
Don’t be embarrassed if this turns out to be the case—in reality, you have still uncovered a 
documentation or design bug. Obviously, if the interface is not intuitive enough to prevent errors, the 
design needs to be improved, or some form of documentation needs to be added to the FAQ or 
knowledge base. If you’ve managed to come across the error, chances are many other users have as well, 
and perhaps they did not have the time or know-how to report the error. 
There are several ways to report a bug. Which method you choose will depend upon your technical 
level and the communication methods you are comfortable with. Regardless of the method you use, 
make sure your message about the bug includes information on how to re-create the bug. If your 
research shows that other users or developers have discussed the bug and its possible fixes, include 
those links in your message.

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
280 
Using the Forums 
The PC-BSD forums contain three forums that deal with bugs: General Bug Reports, Startup/Installation 
Bug Reports, and Usage Bug Reports. It is a good idea to skim through these forums first to get a good 
idea of how others write bug reports and to see which topics belong in which bug forum. You’ll note that 
each forum includes a topic reminding you to search the knowledge base first before posting. Other 
points to keep in mind: 
Explain how to re-create the problem: This should be at the beginning of your 
post because the first thing a developer will do is try to re-create the problem to 
figure out what is causing it. 
If possible, determine if the problem is with PC-BSD, FreeBSD, or KDE: 
Sometimes you can tell from your research; for example, if the bug is being 
discussed on a KDE mailing list, the problem is with KDE, not PC-BSD. 
Sometimes it might be difficult to figure out the underlying source of the  
bug. When in doubt, post on the PC-BSD forum first and be prepared to  
repost to a FreeBSD or KDE forum if a developer indicates that the bug report 
belongs there. 
■ Tip The forum topic “If you see bugs that are KDE or FreeBSD-specific”
2 contains links for posting FreeBSD or 
KDE bug reports. 
Using the Mailing Lists 
If the bug is specific to a PBI, you can post your bug report on the PBI-bugs mailing list. Instructions for 
this list are at http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/pbi-bugs. 
Another mailing list, designed for developers who fix bugs, is Trac-bugs at 
http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/trac-bugs. This is an automated mailing list that sends out 
an e-mail whenever a bug is reported using the trac
3 bug reporting system. Trac is discussed in more 
detail in the next section. 
Using trac 
Trac is software that allows software projects to track their software bugs. Users can submit bug reports 
that are automatically given a ticket number and added to the database of known bugs. Developers can 
report on their progress as they work on fixing the bug. Once the bug is fixed, the ticket is closed. Anyone 
can search the database to see which bugs have been reported and which have been fixed.

The ticket contains the following: 
Summary: This is a descriptive subject to assist other users in finding the bug 
report. 
Description: Include how to re-create the problem/feature here, as well as any 
other details needed to assist the developer in fixing the problem. 
Type: Indicate whether the ticket is a bug report (defect) or feature request 
(enhancement). 
Milestone: Select the version of PC-BSD you are using. Developers who are 
creating new features might pick a version that has not been released yet. 
Version: Select the version of PC-BSD you are using.  
Cc: Leave this as-is so a copy of the report is sent to the trac-bugs mailing list. 
Assign to: Leave this empty because it will be filled in when a developer is 
assigned to fix the bug. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
283 
Priority: Indicate whether the bug/feature is of major or minor importance. 
Typically only developers tag a bug as critical. 
Component: Read through the list of components and pick the one that most 
closely matches the part of the operating system that is affected by the 
bug/feature. 
Keywords: These will be picked up by the search engine so include two or three 
words that you would find useful to search for and find your ticket. 
Attached Files: If possible, include a screenshot or copy/paste of any error 
messages in a separate file. The description should be a short descriptive 
paragraph describing the bug/feature—all the necessary details should be in 
the attached file. 
Before submitting the ticket, use the Preview button. Pretend you are someone else reading the 
ticket—does it contain all the information you would need to understand the problem? When finished 
your review, click Create Ticket to submit it to the database. It will now show under View Tickets. 
The main page of the PC-BSD trac site also contains hyperlinks to the following: 
Roadmap: You can view the tickets and their progress for the upcoming release 
of the operating system.  
Source code: Source code for the operating system. Source code is discussed in 
more detail in Chapter 14. 
The main page also contains links to submitting bug reports for HAL,
4 FreeBSD’s version of KDE, 
KDE, and useful information for developers who want to assist the PC-BSD project. 
Testing Prerelease Builds and PBIs 
By the time an operating system is “released” (i.e., a new version becomes available), many developers 
and users have already tested all the new features to ensure they work as expected. This testing phase is 
called a beta
5 period. When the software is just created and hasn’t been well tested, it is called an alpha 
period. Obviously, the more people who can test new features as they are created and who can retest 
bugs after they are fixed, the better the final release. You don’t have to be a developer to participate in an 
alpha or beta period. You just have to be willing to spend some time trying out new features and writing 
up good reports that explain any errors you come across so they can be fixed by developers. 
■ Tip If you are a developer, you can submit fixes using the PC-BSD trac system.

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
284 
Information useful to PC-BSD beta testers is available in the testing mailing list at http://lists. 
pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo/testing. Begin by looking at the most recent archives—this will tell you 
what version is currently being tested and where to download the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) image to the alpha or beta version.  
■ Tip Beta ISOs tend to be large (at least 2GB), so it is best to have a fairly fast and reliable Internet connection. 
Once you have the beta version, install it on a test system or virtual environment and then start to 
play with it. One approach is to try doing your regular tasks and see if you come across any problems. 
Another approach is to systematically start going through all the menus to see whether anything is 
missing or produces an error. As you find errors, post a message to the testing mailing list. Remember  
to research the error first (to see whether anyone else has already reported it), use a descriptive subject 
line, explain what you did that caused the error, and describe the error and/or cut and paste the error 
message. 
If you prefer to test PBIs instead of the operating system, there is a “PBIs ready for test” forum at 
forums.pcbsd.org. You might want to subscribe to this forum to be notified whenever a new PBI is ready 
to be tested.  
■ Tip PBIs do not get added to pbidir.com until after they have been tested by users. This helps to ensure that 
new users won’t experience any problems when they install a PBI. 
When a PBI developer finishes creating or updating a PBI, a new message is posted to this forum. 
The message will indicate where you can download a copy of the PBI to test. You can speed up the 
process of a PBI going from testing to final availability by volunteering to test the PBI. Install the PBI, try 
accessing all its menus, and perform some of its functions. If you come across any problems, reply to the 
original post. If the PBI works flawlessly for you, still reply to the post and indicate so in your message. 
Join the Translation Team 
If you speak and write a language other than English, consider joining the PC-BSD translation team. This 
team’s efforts help to open up PC-BSD to a whole new group of users who otherwise would not be able 
to access the operating system because they understand a language other than English. The gateway 
containing links useful to PC-BSD translators is located at http://translations.pcbsd.org. Members of 
the translation team work on the following: 
Localization: The process of translating an operating system’s menus and 
messages into another language. 
Document translation: Translation of existing documents, such as the PC-BSD 
User Guide, from English to another language. 
 

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
285 
These tasks are discussed in the following sections. 
Localizing PC-BSD 
The PC-BSD translation community uses the Pootle
6 application to manage translations. Pootle is short 
for PO-based Online Translation/Localization Engine because it uses translation PO files that end in the 
.po extension. The syntax for .po files can take some time to learn—fortunately, Pootle provides an easy-
to-use, browser-based editor that allows you to concentrate on translating rather than spending time 
learning file syntax. 
The PC-BSD Pootle installation, seen in Figure 12-3, is located at http://Pootle2.pcbsd.org.

Each language that is being translated has its own hyperlink in the Languages section. 
■ Tip If the language you want to translate is not listed, send an e-mail to the PC-BSD translations mailing list 
requesting that the language be added. 
If you click a language, you will see the statistics for that language. Figure 12-4 shows the resulting

In order to translate a menu, you need to first register an account and then log in using the links at 
the top of the page. The first time you log in, you will be prompted to change options where you can set 
up your user interface language, the number of rows you want to see in translate and view modes, and 
the languages you want to translate. The language(s) you select will be added to your home page so you 
can quickly access your translation project(s). 
Once you are logged in, you can begin to translate files. Figure 12-5 shows the interface seen by 
clicking the CrashHandler.po file in the French ➤ pcbsd folder.

Figure 12-5. Translating a block of text using PC-BSD Pootle 
Each possible block of words to be translated appears in Pootle’s translation editor. If you click the 
number next to a block of text, an Edit link will appear. In this example, the number 5 has been clicked to 
open the editor for this block of menu text. The translator can now type in the translation and then press 
Submit to save the translated text. 
■ Note The fuzzy checkbox indicates that another translator should still verify the accuracy of the translation. It is 
a good idea to keep this box checked when adding a translation. 
Translating Documentation 
While Pootle is used for localization of PC-BSD menus, translating existing documentation is discussed 
on the Translations forums at forums.pcbsd.org. Check this forum first to see which documents are 
currently being translated. If you want to start work on a document that isn’t currently being translated, 
start a new topic on this forum.

Contributing Documentation 
If English is your native language, you can also contribute new documentation. Here are some 
suggestions to get you started: 
Add a new topic to the Tips & Tricks forum: Have you done something cool 
with your PC-BSD system that isn’t listed in this forum? Or have you found a 
neat trick that other users might find useful? Start a new topic describing your 
tip or trick. 
Add a new topic to the Guides forum: Have you discovered how to perform a 
task that isn’t part of the PC-BSD Users Handbook? Clear instructions on how 
to perform the task would make a great new topic for this forum. 
Join the docs mailing list: Have some good ideas about documentation? The 
people on this mailing list are also interested in documentation. 
Start a blog about PC-BSD: Looking for a good blog idea? Consider blogging 
about your experience with PC-BSD and the things you learn along the way. 
Already write for a column or magazine? If so, see if they are interested  
in publishing an article about PC-BSD or describing how to do something in 
PC-BSD. 
■ Tip There is a magazine specific to BSD
8 which is always looking for writers. 
Review the PC-BSD Knowledge Base and FAQs: Add documentation that you 
think is essential but missing. 
Add to the PC-BSD wiki: Remember to discuss your edits first on the docs 
mailing list. 
Contribute Artwork or Videos 
PC-BSD provides several venues for contributing different types of media that other users might find 
cool or useful. You can do the following:

Submit pictures to the PC-BSD Community Pictures forum: Have pictures 
from a PC-BSD conference booth or of users using PC-BSD? Start a new topic 
and tell others where they can find the pictures. 
Submit screenshots to the PC-BSD Screenshots forum: Let others see 
screenshots of your custom desktop or of PC-BSD running a cool application. 
Upload videos: The PC-BSD users Ning group
9 has an area where you can 
upload videos of PC-BSD presentations, interviews, and how-tos. You have to 
sign up to join the community first. 
If you have other art or design ideas, bring them up in a suitable forum. For example, you could offer 
to create PC-BSD brochures to hand out at conferences, create designs for stickers, or discuss T-shirt 
design ideas. The possibilities are endless! If it’s cool to you, chances are it will be cool to other PC-BSD 
users as well. 
Conferences 
Until you’ve had an opportunity to attend a BSD or free software conference
10 (like a LinuxFest), you 
have no idea how valuable and personally satisfying it is to meet other users who are also interested in 
the PC-BSD operating system. Often you will have the chance to meet people that you have chatted with 
on IRC or whose forum posts you have read. You might also get to meet some of the people who develop 
PC-BSD, write its documentation, or work on a translation team. But don’t just take our word for it—if 
you have a chance to attend a conference in your area or in a city you are able to travel to, attend the 
conference and see for yourself. 
As an Attendee 
If this is your first conference, don’t worry if the scheduled talks sound too advanced. You will still get 
something interesting out of each talk, even if you don’t understand everything the speaker is talking 
about. The real value of a conference is the “in between talks” time. This is where you get to chit chat 
with other attendees, find out what they are doing, and meet new friends. Here are some tips to keep in 
mind when attending a conference: 
Bring your business cards and keep a pen handy: If you don’t have any and 
can’t afford to buy some, create your own cards containing your name and e-
mail address using Open Office
11 and print them onto business card paper that 
is available from most office supply stores. Swapping business cards is a great 
way to have the contact details for the new people you will meet. When 
                                                 
 
9 http://pcbsdusers.ning.com 
10 @bsdevents on Twitter posts the times and locations of upcoming conferences that will have BSD talks or booths. 
11 www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000428 has a nice how-to for creating business cards. 

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
291 
someone hands you a card, take a moment to write a note on the back so you 
remember who they are when you get back home. 
Don’t be shy: If it’s your first conference, you probably don’t know anyone—
yet. That will change quickly once you start talking to people. If you have to, 
muster up the courage to introduce yourself to a few people. BSD users tend to 
be a friendly bunch, so it shouldn’t take too many introductions to get the ball 
rolling. If you have a cool T-shirt or hardware device, bring it with you; people 
will come over and introduce themselves to you! 
Don’t dismiss the conference if you don’t have the money to pay: While 
many conferences are free or have a minimal registration fee, others might be 
out of your price range or you might not have the money to travel to the 
conference location. See the next two sections if either applies to you. 
As a Speaker 
Being a speaker at a conference is a great way to attend a conference. You get to tell other people about 
the interesting things you are doing, and other attendees can benefit from your experience. Having a PC-
BSD talk at a non-BSD conference is also a good way to spread the word about PC-BSD and to give users 
of other operating systems an opportunity to learn more about PC-BSD. 
Every conference has a Call for Papers (CFP) where anyone is invited to submit an idea for a talk. 
Check the conference website a few months before the conference date to find out the guidelines and 
submission due date for the CFP. Read the guidelines and ask yourself if any of the suggested topics 
apply to what you are doing with PC-BSD. Depending upon the focus of the conference, many CFPs are 
looking for nondeveloper talks where those with other skills can discuss what they are doing and how 
others can get involved. Examples of possible talk ideas include the following: 
Translations: What is it like to be a member of a translation team? How do you 
get started in translating documentation? How is Pootle used to assist a 
translation team? 
Using PC-BSD: As an end user in a corporate environment, at a school or 
volunteer organization, useful tips and tricks, migrating from other operating 
systems, things that are different from Windows or Linux or Mac, and so on. 
Running XYZ application on PC-BSD: Describe how you install and use an 
application such as a database, gaming system, server software, or Windows 
application on PC-BSD. 
PC-BSD for FreeBSD, Windows, Linux, or Mac users: If you have experience 
with another operating system, explain how PC-BSD differs and any tricks you 
had to learn when you started using PC-BSD. 
When submitting a talk proposal, double-check that your submission follows the submission 
guidelines. Most conferences will pay a speaker’s registration fee but you should check to see if the 
conference also assists in travel costs or if speakers are responsible for their own travel.  
If your talk gets accepted, spend some time creating and practicing your slides. Ask yourself: “If I 
were listening to this talk, what would I like to learn?” Find out how long the talk is expected to last; most 
talks last 40 minutes with 10 minutes afterward for questions. Practice your timing—if you have too 
many slides, you will be rushing at the end or won’t have enough time left over for questions. If you 
don’t have enough content or rush through your talk, you will be done in 15 minutes and will be left 
wondering what to do with the rest of the time. If possible, practice in front of friends or family members 

CHAPTER 12 ■ GETTING INVOLVED 
 
292 
and have them tell you if you are talking too fast, mumbling, or are making distracting gestures or 
sounds. 
Attendees will be interested in what you have to say and will want to know where to get a copy of 
your slides. If possible, upload your slides to your website, blog, or a slide sharing website such as 
SlideShare
12 before the conference. Include your contact e-mail address and the URL to your slides in the 
last slide and leave that slide up as you answer questions at the end of your talk. 
As a Volunteer 
If you are too shy to be a conference speaker, have trouble introducing yourself to people at conferences, 
or don’t have the money to pay for the conference registration fee, an excellent idea is to volunteer to 
help out at the conference. Every conference needs volunteers to perform such activities as setting up 
the wireless network, helping at the registration desk, stuffing conference bags, acting as lunch monitor, 
and providing attendees with directions. Being a volunteer is a low-key, no-pressure way to meet other 
people because they will be coming to you for help.  
Volunteering to organize and help out at a PC-BSD booth is another way to meet people while 
spreading the word about PC-BSD. This is especially useful at non-BSD conferences such as LinuxFests. 
Most Linux users have already heard of or have used BSD and are usually interested in talking about or 
trying out PC-BSD. If you are organizing a PC-BSD booth, contact @bsdevents on Twitter if you need 
help getting swag or other volunteers for the booth. @bsdevents will also help spread the word about 
your booth. 
Summary 
This chapter offered many practical ideas for becoming more involved within the PC-BSD community. I 
hope that you will try out the ideas that interest you and that you have fun doing so.  
The next section of this book deals with ways advanced users can get the most out of their PC-BSD 
system.

Advanced Tasks 
This chapter will introduce you to some of the more advanced tasks you can perform on your PC-BSD 
system. We’ll discuss backups and snapshots, system upgrades and repairs, scripted and automated 
installations, virtualization using jails, creating a thin client network out of older hardware, and some of 
the command-line utilities unique to PC-BSD. 
Backups 
There are many ways to back up files and directories that are important to you. We offer some 
suggestions for what is available on your PC-BSD system. When deciding which backup solution to use, 
consider the following: 
• 
How much data do you need to back up? Is it just a few files or directories, or 
gigabytes’ worth of data?  
• 
Where is the data? Is it all in one directory or scattered throughout your system? 
• 
Where are you going to put the backup? On a USB drive, CD/DVD disk, another 
system? 
• 
How often does your data change? Is it a big deal if you lose a change? 
• 
Are you comfortable with command-line tools or do you prefer a GUI backup 
system? 
If you are comfortable with using command-line tools, your PC-BSD system comes with many of the 
traditional Unix backup utilities: tar, cpio, pax, and dump.
1 After creating the backup archive, you could, 
for example, use sftp:// in Konqueror to drag and drop the backup to another system that is running an 
ssh server. Or, you could scp the backup to another host from within Konsole. 
                                                 
 
1  www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/backup-basics.html provides an introduction to 
these tools and the Internet has many how-tos if you are looking for examples. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
296 
If you need to back up only a few files on an as-needed basis, you might find it easiest to use 
Dolphin. For example, you could plug in a USB drive or thumb drive and use your mouse to drag and 
drop the files you want to back up onto the drive. 
There are also PBIs available for backup solutions. Users already familiar with Bacula
2 can install the 
Bacula Bat PBI to interact with the Bacula Director daemon. Bacula is a feature-rich backup system that 
might be overkill on one computer but makes a comprehensive backup solution for a network of 
computers. If you’re interested in learning more about Bacula, start with the Bacula Concepts and 
Overview Guide
3 to see if it is the right solution for you.  
If Bacula seems too intimidating and you are looking for a graphical backup utility, consider 
installing and using the KBackup PBI. The next section will demonstrate creating a backup using 
KBackup. 
KBackup 
KBackup is designed to make it easy to back up files to a folder on a system, or to an external USB thumb 
drive or hard drive. Figure 13-1 shows a screenshot of KBackup’s main screen.

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
297 
Simply check the box next to each file or directory that you want to back up. If you check a directory, 
it will automatically check the box for each of its subdirectories and files. You can uncheck any files or 
subdirectories that you don’t want to include in the backup. After making your selections, use the 
browse folder icon to specify the folder in which to save the backup. If you have a USB drive plugged into 
the system, you can select that drive as the backup location. Be sure to double-check first (e.g., within 
Dolphin) that the backup directory or drive has sufficient space to hold the backup. 
■ Caution Don’t save the backup in a folder that you are backing up! You also need write permission to the 
backup folder. 
After selecting what to back up and which folder to back up to, click the Start Backup button. You 
can watch the backup progress because the file names will appear in the window as they are backed up. 
If you see any messages in the Warnings box, you probably do not have permission to back up the 
specified file or directory. 
KBackup will give you a message when the backup is complete. Your backup will have a name that 
begins with backup_ followed by the date and time, and ending with a .tar extension.  
■ Note At the time of this writing, KBackup did not provide a restore button, though this functionality might be 
included in the PBI you installed. If it is not, please refer to the backup resource mentioned in footnote 1 for 
instructions on how to restore a .tar file. 
Life Preserver 
Starting with version 8, PC-BSD provides the Life Preserver utility for backing up your entire system 
using rsync and ssh. While it is common to use rsync and ssh for backups, it usually takes some time to 
install and configure all the software needed for this type of backup solution. Fortunately, PC-BSD has 
already done all the work for you—you only need to have enough disk space to hold your backups. 
■ Note rsync and ssh need to be running on the computer that will hold the backups. Because PC-BSD already 
sets this up for you, we recommend using another PC-BSD system as the computer to back up to. If you plan to 
back up to a computer running another operating system, you will need to research how to install and set up rsync 
and ssh on that system. 
Life Preserver is found in Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ System ➤ Life Preserver. Because this utility will 
back up all the data on your computer, it will ask you for the administrative password when you start this 
program. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
298 
When you first run this utility, it will present you with an empty Life Preserver screen. Click File ➤ 
New Preserver to launch the wizard shown in Figure 13-2.

Simply type in the IP address of the system to hold the backups, and the username and TCP port 
used to ssh to that system. Click Next to configure the scheduling of the backups. That screen is seen in 
Figure 13-4. 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS

Figure 13-4. Configuring the backup schedule in Life Preserver 
After selecting your schedule, click Next and then click Finish. Life Preserver will test the connection 
to the specified host, and if successful, your new “preserver” will now show as an entry in the main 
menu. You can change your preserver’s settings by right-clicking its entry and selecting Edit, as seen in 
Figure 13-5. 
 
 
Figure 13-5. Editing a preserver’s backup schedule 
You can manually create a backup any time by clicking the Start button. We recommend that you 
manually run the first backup, verify the amount of disk space needed to complete that backup (as 
discussed in the next paragraph), and then schedule subsequent backups for a time when the host 
system is not that busy. The Last Backup column will show you the date and time of the last backup and 
indicate whether or not it was successful.  

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
300 
Because Life Preserver backs up the entire system, backups can take a long time and require a lot of 
disk space. It is well worth your while to take a closer look at the contents of /PCBSD/lifePreserver, 
which include the following: 
conf/rsync-excludes: The full pathnames to any directories that do not need to 
be included in your backups should be added to this file; this will significantly 
reduce backup time and the size of the backups. 
preservers/$/last-result: Where $ represents the name of a preserver you have 
created; this file contains the status and time of the last backup.  
preservers/$/logs: Contains the backup logs that are named according to the 
time and date; if a backup fails, check the error messages at the end of the 
associated log file. You might want to watch the log of your first backup with 
“tail -f” to ensure that you aren’t backing up unnecessary data; if you are, add 
the unneeded pathnames to rsync-excludes. 
scripts: Directory containing the scripts used by Life Preserver; advanced users 
can read these to see how Life Preserver works or include them in their own 
scripts. 
 
On the system hosting the backups, completed backups will be found in the life-
preserver/subdirectory of the home directory of the user you configured in Figure 13-3. There will be a 
directory for each backup, up to the amount you specified in Figure 13-5. The latest backup will be 
copied to the current directory that will contain all the directories and files that were backed up—that is, 
they won’t be in an archive format, making it easy to review and access the backed-up files. If you need a 
file, you can simply copy it from the backup server or you can use Life Preserver’s restore utility.  
In Figure 13-6, the user has right-clicked a successful backup and selected Restore from the right-
click menu. In this example, there is only one backup stored on the host server; if there were multiple 
backups, the user could select which backup to restore.

System Snapshots 
If you’re interested in backing up an entire file system, consider taking a file system snapshot.  
■ Tip Need more information about file systems or the differences between UFS and ZFS? Check out 
www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/file systems.html. 
A file system snapshot is an exact replica of a file system at the time the snapshot is taken. 
Depending upon its size, the resulting snapshot file can be saved to backup media such as DVDs, 
magnetic tapes, or USB drives. It can also be treated as a file system image, allowing you to mount and 
explore the contents of the snapshot. Think of a snapshot as a picture of the entire file system at a given 
point in time. 
The command you use to take the snapshot depends upon whether the partition is using the UFS or 
the ZFS file system. You can find more information about UFS file system snapshots at 
www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/snapshots.html. You can find more information 
about ZFS file system snapshots at http://wiki.freebsd.org/ZFSQuickStartGuide.  
Figure 13-8 demonstrates creating a UFS snapshot on a PC-BSD system. 
 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
302 
 
Figure 13-8. Creating a UFS file system snapshot 
In this example, the mount command was used to determine which UFS file systems were currently 
mounted. On this system, /dev/ad0s1a is mounted on / and a memory disk (/dev/md0) is mounted on 
/tmp. A snapshots directory was created in /var to hold the snapshot. The mksnap_ffs command was 
used to take a snapshot of the / file system. The date command was used to generate a snapshot name 
containing the current day, month, and year. Note that the backtick is used on both sides of the date 
command. The resulting snapshot size is quite large and will always be the size of the file system, 
regardless of how much data it holds. In other words, a 74 GB file system containing 1 GB of data will 
have a snapshot size of 74 GB. 
■ Caution If you decide to script the creation of file system snapshots on a regular basis, make sure that you 
have enough disk space to store the snapshots. UFS supports only 20 snapshots per file system, so your script will 
also need to remove older snapshots to stay under that maximum limit. 
In order to mount the snapshot, you need to create a block device first, using the mdconfig
4 
command. Figure 13-9 provides an example in which mdconfig is used to attach the snapshot to a 
memory disk. Because the previous mount command indicated that md0 was already in use, /dev/md2 
was selected (-u 2) as the memory device to use. 
                                                 
 
4 See man mdconfig for more information about this command and its switches. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
303 
 
Figure 13-9. Mounting a UFS file system snapshot 
The output of the mdconfig command indicates that the snapshot is read only. Once mounted, the 
contents and size of the snapshot were displayed using the ls and df commands. 
■ Tip If you ever receive a “Device busy” error when using mdconfig, specify a different number because the 
requested memory device is already in use.  
Even though the snapshot is read only, you can still copy its contents, making it a possible backup 
solution. It can also be handy if you ever need to see the “state” of a file system at a given point in time 
(for example, if you want to track the history of file changes from day to day or you are investigating 
suspicious file system activity). 
Upgrading PC-BSD 
The PC-BSD installer provides an option to upgrade to a newer version of PC-BSD. If you want to 
upgrade, download or purchase the latest DVD from the Download page of pcbsd.org. 
■ Caution Before performing an upgrade, back up the data that is important to you to another hard drive or 
computer. Important data usually includes your home directory and any customized configuration files that you 
have created outside of your home directory. 
When a newer version of PC-BSD is released, consider whether you want to upgrade to the newer 
version or install the new version from scratch. An upgrade will not reformat your PC-BSD partition(s) 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
304 
and it retains some of the operating system’s original configuration files. The advantage of an upgrade is 
that all your data and most of your customizations should be retained for you—though it is an excellent 
idea to back up your data anyway, just in case. Some people prefer to start from scratch by installing the 
new version, which reformats the PC-BSD partition(s). This starts you off with a clean operating system 
and assumes that you will restore your data from a backup onto the new operating system. 
■ Tip The /PCBSD/pc-sysinstall/conf/exclude-from-upgrade file contains a list of the files and directories that 
remain intact during an upgrade. See the “Custom Installation” section later on in this chapter for more 
information about this file. 
If you decide to upgrade, insert the DVD for the new version into the DVD drive and boot the 
computer to start the installation program, as described in Chapter 2. In the screen shown in Figure 13-
10, choose the Upgrade button. 
 
 
Figure 13-10. Using the installer to perform an upgrade or restore 
As seen in Figure 13-10, the installer will find your existing installation. Highlight the installation 
and press Next to continue. The installation will skip to the Optional Components screen (refer to Figure 
2-18) so you can select which applications to install with the upgraded version of the operating system. 
You can then continue through the remaining installation screens, as described in Chapter 2. 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
305 
Restoring PC-BSD 
PC-BSD’s installer provides an option to restore your PC-BSD system from an existing Life Preserver 
backup. To restore the system, start the installation using the DVD for your current version of PC-BSD. 
This time, select the Restore button, as seen in Figure 13-11. 
 
 
Figure 13-11. Performing a restore from the PC-BSD installer 
Input the same IP address and username you used when creating your preserver; then press Next. 
The installer will connect to the backup server and a pop-up menu will allow you to select the backup 
you want to restore from. Highlight the desired backup and press the Select button. You can then 
proceed through the rest of the installation screens as described in Chapter 2. 
■ Tip You will need a full system backup to perform a system restore. If you choose to customize what gets 
backed up with Life Preserver (as described earlier in this chapter), perform at least one full backup and store it in 
area where it will not get erased by Life Preserver. 
Single User Mode 
If you have messed up a file that is preventing your system from booting properly, you can use single 
user mode to repair that file. Single user mode is a partial boot of the system. It will not load the network 
or any graphical utilities. However, it does provide complete access to the files on the system without 

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS 
 
306 
needing to know the superuser password (real handy if you ever forget the superuser password and need 
to reset it). 
To access single user mode, boot the system and watch the startup messages. When you see the 
Welcome to PC-BSD! screen, press 4 to select the “Boot PC-BSD in single user mode” option. 
■ Tip If this screen goes by too fast for you to make your selection, reboot and press the spacebar to pause the 
selection timer.  
After selecting single user mode, the system will continue to boot. When finished, you will see a 
message saying “Enter full pathname of shell or RETURN for /bin/sh:” After pressing Enter, you will be 
in the Bourne shell. 
By default, single user mode will mount all your filesystems as read only, meaning that you can’t 
edit the file you want to fix. Once you have a shell, type /sbin/mount -a -o rw to remount all the 
filesystems as read-write. You can now use the vi or ee editor to fix the typo in the file. After saving your 
changes, type Exit to leave single user mode and continue booting the system. 
Using /rescue 
Your PC-BSD system provides a /rescue directory, which contains the applications considered necessary 
for repairing the operating system. Consider these tools as a last resort if the commands in /bin and 
/sbin fail to work in single user mode. This situation is very rare, but it is possible that a command you 
need to use (such as mount or vi) has become corrupt or was accidentally deleted. Read through man 
rescue before using any of the commands in /rescue as it explains all the things that you need to be 
aware of.  
If your system really is that mucked up, you should probably consider doing a restore or re-install of 
the operating system using PC-BSD’s installer. If you have important data that has not been backed up 
yet, back it up first because it will be lost during the restore or re-install. 
■ Tip If you can’t boot the system, perform the backup in single user mode. While you won’t be able to back up to 
the network in single user mode, you can still store the backup on a mounted USB drive. 
Custom Installation 
Starting with version 8, PC-BSD provides a series of scripts and configuration files that allow you to 
create your own custom installation. Even if you don’t decide to use the scripts or change the 
configuration files, reading through them will give you a better understanding of how the PC-BSD 
installer works and what it is capable of doing. Everything you need can be found in the /PCBSD/pc-
sysinstall directory.  

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS

The /PCBSD/pc-sysinstall/ directory contains the following directories and files: 
backend: Directory containing Bourne shell scripts, one for each function in 
the installation program, as well as the startautoinstall.sh script, which is 
used to start an automated installation. 
backend-query: Directory containing Bourne shell scripts for probing 
hardware, software components, and available languages. 
components: Directory containing a subdirectory for each available software 
component. Each subdirectory contains a component.cfg configuration file and 
installation script for that software. 
conf: Directory containing a list of available languages (avail-langs), files to 
exclude from an upgrade (exclude-from-upgrade), a directory of license texts, 
and configuration options for pc-sysinstall (pc-sysinstall.conf). 
doc: Contains files controlling the text seen when you type pc-sysinstall help. 
examples: Contains pcinstall.cfg.* configuration examples for the following 
types of installs: gmirror, network install, restore, rsync, upgrade, and zfs. It also 
contains the pc-autoinstall.conf file, which contains the configuration for an 
automated install. 
pc-sysinstall: The script that provides the backend for performing system 
installations. It is read by both the GUI installation program and any custom 
installs that you create. 
Custom Configuration with pcinstall.cfg 
The pcinstall.cfg file is read by the installer. If you want to create a customized installation, copy  
an appropriate sample configuration file from the examples directory to /PCBSD/pc-
sysinstall/pcinstall.cfg, and review it to see if you want to edit any of its variables. Table 13-1 
contains a description of the variables that can be used in this configuration file. Note that the table is in 
the order that the variables appear, rather than alphabetical order.

Run a command on the live file system. 
 
Before customizing pcinstall.cfg, it is highly recommended that you first read /PCBSD/pc-
sysinstall/examples/README. This file contains a more complete description of how and when to use 
each variable. If you make any changes to the pcinstall.cfg file, double-check your changes for typos. 
While the installer will do a basic sanity check, it won’t notice if you mistype a hostname or IP address. 
Starting a Custom Install 
Once you have a customized configuration file, the pc-sysinstall script can be used to start a custom 
installation. This script controls the backend of the PC-BSD installation program. The beginning of this 
script contains some user-editable configuration variables in which you can set an alternate path to pc-
sysinstall and its components. You should leave the rest of the file as-is. Feel free to read through it to 
get a better understanding of the installation process.

In this example, the customized mycustom_pcinstall.cfg file was moved to the name expected by 
the installer: /tmp/pc-sysinstall.cfg. The pc-sysinstall utility was then run with the start-autoinstall 
option. Once the word install is typed in, the installer will parse the custom configuration file and install 
the system according to that file’s variables.  
Rolling Your Own ISO 
If you want, you can also create your own installation DVD that contains your customized configuration 
file. If this interests you, read through /PCBSD/pc-sysinstall/examples/pc-autoinstall.conf first 
because a customized version of that file will need to be added to the /boot/ directory of the DVD. 
Follow these steps to create your custom installation DVD: 
1. 
Insert a PC-BSD DVD and wait for it to become available in Dolphin. 
2. 
Create a new folder. 
3. 
Drag the DVD to your new folder to copy its contents into the folder. 
4. 
Copy /PCBSD/pc-sysinstall/examples/pc-autoinstall.conf to the boot/ 
directory in your new folder. 
5. 
Edit boot/pc-autoinstall.conf to meet your requirements. 
6. 
Copy your customized pcinstall.cfg to the new folder. 
You are now ready to see whether your custom DVD works. The following command will burn the 
DVD on the fly, meaning that it will not save a copy of an .iso file to your hard disk: growisofs -Z 
/dev/cd0 -J -R -no-emul-boot -b boot/cdboot -iso-level 3. Run the command from within your new 
folder. 
To instead create an ISO that you can then burn at your leisure, use this command: mkisofs -V 
mycustomPCBSD -J -R -b boot/cdboot -no-emul-boot -o custompcbsd.iso.  
Once you have a DVD, boot it on a test system to see whether the installation proceeds according to 
your customizations. 
■ Tip Using a rewritable DVD media is useful when testing a customized DVD.

Jail Management with The Warden  
FreeBSD provides a mechanism, known as a jail,
12 which allows one physical computer to act as multiple 
virtual computers. Each jail contains a copy of the operating system, its own user accounts, and 
whatever applications you want to install in the jail. The system that created the jail is known as the host, 
and you can install as many jails on that host as you have disk space to support. 
Creating jails can be useful if you need to provide services to multiple clients. For example, a 
company that provides web hosting can give each customer a jail containing their own web and mail 
server. Rather than having to buy a separate computer for each customer, one machine can host 
multiple jails. The reason why it is called a jail is because an application installed into a jail is not 
allowed to “break out” and affect the other jails or the operating system running on the host machine. 
So, if an application within a jail is exploited, it will affect only that one jail. 
There are many reasons to create a jail. Some examples include the following: 
• 
A classroom in which each student gets their own jail to practice their exercises. 
• 
A test environment when you are learning how to build kernels, set up databases, 
configure web or mail servers, or practice firewall rules. 
• 
You want to install different versions of the same application within different jails. 
• 
You want to study software viruses without negatively affecting your main 
operating system. 
On FreeBSD, jail creation and management is command-line based. While the commands are well 
documented,
13 it can take a bit of time to prepare the host system for the jails and to create the jails. PC-
BSD provides a graphical environment that prepares the jail environment for you and makes it easier to 
create, stop, and start jails. It is called TheWarden and is available as a PBI. There is a PC-BSD mailing 
list for TheWarden
14 as well as a wiki page.
15 
■ Note If you did not install TheWarden during installation, you can still do so using a PC-BSD DVD. Use Dolphin 
to navigate the contents of the inserted DVD; you’ll find the PBI in extras ➤ PBI.

Once installed, you can start TheWarden from Kickoff ➤ Applications ➤ System ➤ TheWarden. After 
entering the administrative password, the main menu of TheWarden will open. Figure 13-13 shows the 
Create new jail menu, which can be accessed from File ➤ New Jail. 
 
 
Figure 13-13. Creating a new jail in TheWarden 
Input an IP address that isn’t currently being used by your operating system or another jail. You can 
either accept the default hostname or input a unique hostname. If you plan to build kernels inside the 
jail, check the Include system source box. If you plan to compile ports within the jail, check the Include 
ports tree box. If you don’t check the box for Start jail at system boot, you will have to start the jail 
manually from TheWarden after the system boots. 
■ Tip If you check to include the source or the ports tree within the jail, make sure that they are installed on the 
host system. You can install on the host system from the System Tasks – Advanced Users Only section of Kickoff 
➤ System Settings ➤ System Manager ➤ Tasks.  
Once you click Create, the Setup Users menu will open and prompt you to create an administrative 
password for the jail, and the username and password for the primary user of the jail. Remember, the jail 
is considered to be a virtual computer with its own superuser and user accounts. After inputting the 
password information and pressing Save, a Creating Jail menu will open showing the progress of 
building the jail. Creating the jail will take a few minutes, especially if you have selected the source or 
ports check boxes, because the world, source, and ports  
will be installed into the new jail. Once the jail-creation process is finished, you’ll receive a Success! 
message and can close the menu. Your new jail will now show in TheWarden’s main menu as seen in 
Figure 13-14.

Figure 13-14. List of current jails in TheWarden 
The Autostart column indicates that this jail will automatically start at system bootup. However, the 
jail still needs to be manually started in order to access its contents. You can do so by right-clicking the 
jail and selecting Start this jail from the menu, which will change the jail’s Status to Running. 
To access the jail, ssh to its IP address.  
Once you have logged in to the jail, you can do anything (at the command line) that you would 
normally do on a FreeBSD system. For example, you can install software using packages or ports, 
configure services, or compile a new kernel
16. 
The jail’s right-click menu contains these entries: 
Start/Stop this Jail: Changes the jail’s current status to running or stopped. A 
jail’s contents are not available while it is stopped. 
Toggle Autostart: Determines whether the jail will start automatically when the 
computer starts. Disabled means it will not.

Install Inmate into jail: An inmate is a server environment that has been 
preconfigured for you and saved as a .wit file. Search for the term inmate in 
Software Manager to find which inmate PBIs are available. Examples of inmates 
include an Apache, MySQL, and PHP (AMP)
17 and a Joomla
18 environment. Once 
you have installed the PBI for an inmate, browse to the location of its .wit file to 
install it into the specified jail. Once the inmate is installed into the jail, run 
pkg_info inside the jail to see what software was installed. 
View installed packages: Shows the output of pkg_info so you can quickly 
view what software is installed within the jail. It will also indicate if any inmates 
are installed. 
Export jail to .wdn file: Creates a full, compressed copy of the jail. This file can 
be imported, using the File menu, allowing you to migrate the jail to another 
system. It can also be imported on the same system, in order to clone (create an 
identical copy of) an existing jail with a new IP address. Creating the .wdn might 
take some time, especially if you have source, ports, or a lot of data in the jail.  
Delete jail: Removes the jail and all its contents from the host system. If any 
data in the jail is important, back up that data or export the jail first. 
The Jails menu contains a Configuration option in which you can modify the network interface, 
directory that holds the jails, and temporary directory used by TheWarden. A screenshot of this menu is 
seen in Figure 13-15.

management on your PC-BSD system or want a better understanding of how TheWarden works, take 
some time to read through The Warden script; it is well commented and contains several useful 
examples. 
Thin Client Server 
PC-BSD allows you to set up a network of thin clients
19 with a PC-BSD system acting as the thin client 
server. In a thin client network, all the work is done on the server—the rest of the machines connect to 
the server in order to access data and to run applications. This allows you to make the most out of older

CHAPTER 13 ■ ADVANCED TASKS

hardware because the client machines themselves can have a small (or no) hard drive, a minimum 
amount of memory, and an older CPU. The server machine should have sufficient hard drive space, 
memory, and CPU in order to support the clients that will connect to it. 
A thin client server needs the following components: 
DHCP server: As a thin client boots up, it will receive an IP address from the 
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. 
NFS server: Stores the data that is accessible to the thin clients. 
TFTP server: Contains an operating system environment for the thin client to 
use. This allows computers with no hard drives to still access the thin client 
server. 
The thin client does not require any software, but it does need a network card that understands 
PXE
20 (most network cards made in the past 10 years do). You can check by accessing the BIOS utility
21 on 
the thin client computer. The BIOS menu will include an option that controls startup. Access that menu; 
if it contains any entries for a network or a list of network cards to boot from, that computer is capable of 
acting as a thin client. You should change the boot priority order on the thin client computer so that the 
network card is listed first.  
PC-BSD provides a thin client server PBI and a wiki entry
22 to get you started. The PBI sets up the 
DHCP, NFS, and TFTP servers for you—meaning that your thin client network should “just work.” 
During the installation of the PBI, a pxeboot user will be created with a default password. You should 
immediately change this password using the command passwd pxeboot. If the computer has multiple 
network cards, it will ask you which card you want to use. Select the card that is used to connect to the 
thin client computers in your network. After the PBI is finished installing, it will prompt you to reboot 
the computer so all the changes can take effect.  
To test your setup, make sure that the thin client computer’s BIOS is set to boot from the network. 
Boot the client and watch its startup messages. You should see messages indicating the name of the 
computer’s PXE boot software and that it is trying to initialize and establish the link. If the link fails, 
double-check that you have selected the correct network interface and that its network cable is plugged 
in correctly. If the connection is successful, you’ll see messages as the client receives an IP address and 
the operating system loads. After a few minutes, you should be presented with a login screen. After 
logging in, you should see your usual desktop environment.  
■ Tip Create a unique user account for each thin client user on the thin client server.

From the users’ perspective, everything should look the same. In reality, everything users see is 
happening on the server. If users create or edit any files, they are doing so on the server system because 
the hard drive is not being used at all on the thin client system. The hardware requirements on the server 
will depend upon the number of thin clients that connect at the same time. It should be noted that 
should the thin client server or the thin client network become unavailable, none of the thin clients will 
be able to access data until the server and the network are back up. 
PC-BSD–Specific Scripts and Programs 
An excellent way to get a better understanding of how your operating system works is to read the scripts 
that come with the operating system. This gives you behind-the-scenes insight into which commands 
are run when the operating system starts, is shut down, as well as how some of the commands that came 
with the operating system work. Most scripts contain comments (which start with #) to explain what the 
script itself or a certain command within the script does. You might find some of the scripts useful 
enough to include within your own scripts. Most will work at the command line even if you have ssh’d 
into a PC-BSD system or are using a minimal desktop on your PC-BSD system. To run a script, give the 
full path to the script; if you are in the same directory as the script, put a ./ in front of the script’s name. 
■ Caution Make sure that you understand what a script does before running it manually. If you are unsure, 
consider running it on a test system first. 
Table 13-3 provides a description of the subdirectories and scripts contained in /PCBSD/Scripts/. 
Many of these scripts are used by the Software Manager and System Manager programs. Others set up

13-17 shows an example of a file listing of this directory from a system running PC-BSD version 7.1.

The file name for each update indicates the date (in day/month/year format) the update became 
available as well as a name describing what the update addresses. Each update ends in an .upd 
extension. The files contain information about the update, including the URL to the patch and the URL 
containing the details of what the patch does. 
PC-BSD also contains commands unique to the PC-BSD operating system. Because these are binary 
applications instead of than scripts, you can’t just read their contents. However, if you type strings 
command-name|more, you might still be able to find some comments that provide a bit more insight 
into the inner workings of the command. 
Table 13-5 summarizes the command-line utilities and remaining scripts that are unique to  
PC-BSD.

Description 
/PCBSD/bin/CrashHandler-bin 
Tells PC-BSD how to handle an application crash. 
/PCBSD/bin/PBIdelete 
Removes a PBI. 
/PCBSD/bin/PBReg 
Allows you to interact with PC-BSD’s registry. (This is discussed in 
more detail in the next section.) 
/PCBSD/bin/SoundError 
Tells PC-BSD what to do when it cannot get sound working. 
/PCBSD/bin/pdm 
Script that controls the graphical login manager. 
/PCBSD/bin/rerunXsetup.sh 
Script that reruns the Display Setup Wizard. 
Mini-Registry 
 
PC-BSD provides a command-line registry.
23 Similar to the registry on a Windows system, the PC-BSD 
registry is used to store keys and their values. Because it is command-line–based, it can be used by shell 
scripts. Because it uses QT libraries, any QT (e.g., KDE) application can also access the information 
stored in the registry. The registry itself is located in the text file /root/config/PCBSD.conf; a quick skim 
through this file shows that it is used by Software Manager and some PBIs. If you run pbreg without any 
arguments, it will print its usage instructions (see Figure 13-18).

Figure 13-18. Running pbreg with no arguments 
The get, set, and rem commands can be used to refer to variables within the registry. As a simple 
example, consider a portion of a script that toggles between GUI and command modes. It could be 
written this way: 
 
# Check if the GUI is enabled 
if [ "`pbreg get /MyApp/enableGui`" = "true" ] 
then 
   # disable the GUI 
   pbreg set /MyApp/enableGui false 
fi 
 
Uses for the registry are limited only by the script writer’s imagination. Because real-world usage 
examples are currently in short supply, consider adding a how-to to the PC-BSD forums, explaining how 
you use pbreg in a script. Your experience will be invaluable to others. 
Summary 
This chapter allowed you to take a closer look at some of the inner workings of your PC-BSD system. It 
has also given you a better appreciation that there are many ways to perform a task, such as a backup or 
an installation. The deeper you dig into the programs and configurations that came with your system, 
the more you will find ways to perform tasks in ways that better meet your needs. There is always 
something new to be discovered and improved upon! 
The next chapter will build upon these explorations even further and introduce you to ways in 
which you can contribute your own improvements and discoveries.

Becoming a Developer 
Chapter 12 introduced you to some of the areas any PC-BSD user can explore to contribute to the PC-
BSD community. This chapter covers more advanced forms of contribution that typically require 
programming skills. If you are a programmer, taking programming in school and looking for 
opportunities to practice your skills, or if you are interested in learning more about how the PC-BSD 
operating system and push button installer applications (PBIs) are developed, this chapter is for you. 
We begin by describing the PC-BSD release engineering process and the resources available to 
developers to give you an idea of what to expect. If you have limited programming knowledge, you can 
still successfully complete the tasks found in the section on "Converting a FreeBSD Port Using PBI 
Builder."  
PC-BSD Release Engineering Process 
Any large software project needs a set of guiding principles and processes. Ideally, a project’s processes 
are documented so new developers know what to expect. Processes are meant to address how the 
software project manages its code development, answering questions such as: 
• 
Where is the source code located? Is it browsable? Is it downloadable?” 
• 
Who is allowed to make (commit) changes to the source code? Are changes 
monitored or checked by other developers? 
• 
Can a committer make a change anywhere in the code base or are committers 
given write permission to only certain sections of the code? 
• 
How often are new changes tested against the entire code base? If a commit 
breaks something, who is alerted and who fixes the problem? 
• 
Are commits made against the current released version of the software or to a 
testing version that has not been released yet? 
• 
Who determines what features should go into the next software release? 
• 
Are there any rules governing what style of code developers are expected to use? 
• 
How often are new versions of the software released? 
• 
How long are older versions of the software maintained for security patches? 

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
326 
The rest of this section provides an overview of how PC-BSD manages its development process. 
■ Tip It is useful to remember that PC-BSD is based on FreeBSD and closely follows FreeBSD’s set of processes 
that are documented in the FreeBSD Release Engineering
1 document. 
The code base for PC-BSD is kept in a subversion server, and trac provides browse and search 
mechanisms for the code base. Chapter 12 introduced you to the PC-BSD trac system. PC-BSD’s code 
base is divided into branches, with each branch representing a different version of the software. Figure 
14-1 shows the branches for the “pcbsd” code base from versions 1.4 to 7.1.1.

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
327 
New commits are made against trunk, which represents the current version that hasn’t been 
released yet. Figure 14-1 was taken before the release of PC-BSD 8, meaning that version 8 was the trunk 
version at that time. 
After a version is released, it is moved from trunk to a new version number in branches, and a new 
trunk is created for the next expected version. It is rare for a commit to be made against a released 
version because it is considered to be released (or finalized).  
trunk and each branch version are divided into modules, which allow developers to follow and 
commit to the modules that interest them. Most modules contain the source files and configurations for 
a PC-BSD utility. The modules for trunk (version 8.0 before it was released) are seen in Figure 14-2 and 
briefly described in Table 14-1.

Security patches are not stored on the trac server because they are usually based on the FreeBSD 
security advisory system.
3 Every PC-BSD security patch installed by Update Manager contains the URL 
to the associated security advisory.  
■ Tip You can also view each available, ignored, and installed system patch for your system in 
/PCBSD/SystemUpdater/system-updates/. 
As changes are committed to the PC-BSD code base, an email containing the details of the change is 
automatically sent to the Commits mailing list.
4 Browsing through that list’s archives gives you a good 
idea of the changes made to the PC-BSD code base.

As the trunk version of PC-BSD gets closer to being released, installable versions of the operating 
system are periodically released to the Testing mailing list.
5 As described in Chapter 12, everyone is 
encouraged to install and try the testing version and to report any bugs so that developers can fix them. 
This helps to ensure that when the new version is released, it has been tested on many different types of 
hardware and is as bug-free as possible.  
System Developer Resources 
In addition to the resources mentioned in the previous section, the following resources are available to 
programmers interested in contributing to the development of the PC-BSD operating system. 
• 
Dev
6 mailing list: For general development discussion. This is where features are 
planned and discussed. 
• 
Development team:
7 In addition to the contact information for each team member, 
this page lists which development tasks are needed for system development and 
translation, quality assurance, PBI development, PBI quality assurance, 
documentation, web development, and system administration. It also lists who to 
contact if you are interested in helping in one of these areas. 
• 
Development Guidelines:
8 Discusses naming conventions, indentation, 
internationalization support, documentation, and licensing.  
If you are interested in PC-BSD system development, you should also take the time to familiarize 
yourself with the following documentation because PC-BSD is based on FreeBSD and KDE. 
•

Getting System Source  
Anyone can browse and download any portion of the PC-BSD code base. If you are interested only in a 
few files, you can use your browser to download them from the trac server. If you would like to follow the 
changes being made in an entire branch while keeping the files you have downloaded “in sync” with the 
changes on the subversion server, you should use the svn utility to “check out” (download) the files you 
need. 
Your PC-BSD system comes with the svn utility installed, and the Getting Source guide
12 contains 
instructions for downloading all the branches, trunk only, or a specified branch. svn comes with a lot of 
options; following are the ones developers use most often. 
• 
svn co: Checks out the specified directory. It creates a directory of the same name 
in your current working directory. For example, if you check out the repository 
using the command “svn co svn://svn.pcbsd.org/pcbsd,” a directory named 
“pcbsd” is created that contains everything you see under “pcbsd” on the trac 
server. You should see a list of files as they are copied. If you receive a message 
similar to “Checked out revision 5487,” your copy is identical to the one on the 
trac server. 
• 
svn up: Updates your already downloaded copy so that it contains all the files on 
the trac server. Always run this command in the directory name that matches the 
directory you would like to sync with. 
• 
svn help: Lists all the possible commands. If you add help to a command, it shows 
its usage (for example, svn help co). 
Only PC-BSD committers are able to make changes to the code on the trac server. If you have 
created code patches, submit them using the methods described in Chapter 12. Over time, the 
community gets to know you and your development style. If you submit many useful patches, don’t be 
surprised if you are asked whether you would like to have a commit bit, the term used to signify that you 
now have the necessary permissions to upload your changes directly to the code base.  
PC-BSD committers are also able to use the following svn commands. 
• 
svn add: Adds the specified file to the code base 
• 
svn rm: Removes the specified file from the code base 
• 
svn ci: Checks in (uploads) your changed files to the code base 
Overview of PBI Development Process 
The previous sections describe the development process for the PC-BSD operating system. This section 
concentrates on the development process for PBIs. 
                                                 
 
12 http://trac.pcbsd.org/wiki/GettingSource 

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
332 
PBIs are stored on the PC-BSD Project’s official PBI build servers (http://pbibuild.pcbsd.org and 
http://pbibuild64.pcbsd.org). Every Monday through Friday night, each server checks and builds the 
PBIs that meet any of these criteria:  
• 
The PBI is newly added.  
• 
The PBI’s underlying FreeBSD port has been updated.  
• 
The PBI committer sets a configuration value indicating that the PBI should be 
rebuilt. 
If the build of a PBI fails, an email is automatically sent to the Pbibuild mailing list.
13 The email 
contains the last 50 lines of the build log, which should include the error message. The full build log can 
be downloaded from the PBI build server. Figure 14-3 shows a screenshot from the build server, which 
indicates that the astro/googleearth build has failed. 
 
 
Figure 14-3. Build failure for astro/googleearth on the PBI build server 
To access the build log, click the hyperlink for the failed PBI, in this case astro/googleearth. The 
build log has a .bz extension, which indicates that it has been compressed. You can uncompress the file 
using the bunzip2 command that came with your PC-BSD system.

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
333 
The configuration information used for building a PBI is known as a module. PBI modules are 
created by the PBI maintainer. The next section demonstrates how to create a PBI module. You can 
browse through all the modules at http://trac.pcbsd.org/browser/pbibuild/modules. Browsing 
through the modules can be helpful if you are stuck building a PBI or aren’t sure how to modify a PBI’s 
configuration files and want to see how other PBI developers handled their module’s configuration. Two 
tools are available for creating a PBI. The recommended method is to use PBI Builder
14 when a FreeBSD 
port already exists. If a FreeBSD port does not exist, PBI Creator
15 can be used to create the PBI. PBI 
Builder is recommended for several reasons, including: 
• 
Most of the development work has already been done for you by the person who 
ported the software to FreeBSD. 
• 
PBI Builder is fairly straight-forward to use, meaning anyone with a bit of time and 
patience should be able to create a PBI. 
• 
PBI Builder creates a sandbox environment for building the PBI. This means that 
you don’t have to create an environment on a separate build computer, it won’t 
harm your computer, and the resulting PBI has everything it needs to work on a 
PC-BSD system. 
• 
PBI Builder enables you to create the module files understood by the PBI build 
server. After it is on the PBI build server, your PBI automatically updates whenever 
the underlying FreeBSD port changes. 
• 
The PBI build server sends out an automatic email message and generates a build 
log if your PBI ever fails to build. 
In contrast, PBI Creator isn’t recommended for several reasons, including: 
• 
It requires you to create your own clean build system, which means you want to 
use a separate computer (or virtual environment) that needs to be returned to a 
default PC-BSD install for every PBI that is built. 
• 
It requires you to manually populate your build environment with the application 
source and dependencies (PBI Builder automatically does this for you).  
• 
There are more than 21,000 FreeBSD ports, which means there is already plenty of 
software waiting to be built using PBI Builder.

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
334 
• 
If you are using PBI Creator because no FreeBSD port exists, you get to do all the 
porting work. Depending upon the size of the application, the number of its 
dependencies and what assumptions were coded into the software (for example, 
expected paths, libraries, devices, and so on), this work can range from trivial to 
really hard and time consuming to far exceeds your coding knowledge. We 
recommend that if you do all of the work required to port the software, you should 
submit the port to the FreeBSD ports collection and then use PBI Builder to 
convert the port to a PBI. This enables the ported software to be used by both 
FreeBSD and PC-BSD users and enables the resulting PBI to take advantage of the 
benefits provided by the PBI build server. 
For these reasons, this chapter demonstrates only how to use PBI Builder. If you would like to tackle 
porting software to a FreeBSD port, work your way through the FreeBSD Porter’s Handbook.
16 
After a PBI is created, it needs to be tested by others before it is added to the PBI build server and 
made available for download at pbidir.com. This helps to ensure the quality of the software available to 
PC-BSD users and provides a check that the developer didn’t miss anything when creating the PBI.  
Anyone can test a PBI. Feedback regarding a PBI should be sent to the Pbi-dev mailing list. This list 
should also be used if you ever find a bug in a PBI that is already available at pbidir.com so the developer 
can fix the bug.

developers, including:

335 
Converting a FreeBSD Port Using PBI Builder 
Chapters 9 and 10 introduced you to FreeBSD ports and packages and gave some insight into the work 
port maintainers go through so that the package and port “just work.” PBI Builder simplifies the process 
of converting an existing FreeBSD port into a PBI, which means anyone can create a PBI without 
needing much (if any) previous development experience. If you have a bit of time to spare, like to learn 
new things, and are interested in seeing as much software as possible available to the PC-BSD 
community, try your hand at creating a PBI with PBI Builder. The more PBIs that are available, the better 
it is for everyone because it ensures that even brand new PC-BSD users can safely install the software 
they need and keep it up to date.  
Information about and the download for PBI Builder can be found at http://www.pcbsd.org/ 
content/view/45/30/. PBI Builder is a command-line utility that requires you to edit a few configuration 
variables that are used when the PBI is built. PBI Builder automates the entire build process: the creation 
of the build sandbox, fetching the source for the port and all its dependencies, building everything that is 
needed, and converting the results into the PBI. 
PBI Builder uses a large archive that contains the system source and world environment used by PC-
BSD. It provides all the libraries needed to ensure that the resulting PBI works on the version of PC-BSD 
that matches the version of PBI Builder.  
■ Tip The file /pbi-build/docs/HOWTO-MODULES is well worth reading because it fully explains all the files 
contained in the archive and the PBI creation process. If you’re curious about what commands are executed when 
building a PBI, read through the scripts in /pbi-build/scripts/. You can also find some examples in /pbi-
build/docs/module-examples. 
Building Your First PBI 
Before building your PBI 
1. 
Check that a PBI for that software doesn’t currently exist at pbidir.com or 
pbibuild.pcbsd.com. 
2. 
Check that the Pbi-dev mailing list isn’t currently testing a PBI for that 
software. 
3. 
Check to see if a module already exists at 
http://trac.pcbsd.org/browser/pbibuild/modules. 
4. 
Search for the software at freshports.org. Some of the FreshPorts details for 
that software come in handy when you configure your PBI module. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
336 
5. 
Download and untar the PBI Builder archive according to the instructions in 
the “Using the PBI Builder”
21 document. 
Now that your system is ready for building PBIs, download the PBI module template. 
 
# cd /pbi-build/modules 
# fetch http://www.pcbsd.org/files/templates/module-template.tgz 
# tar xvzf module-template.tgz 
 
Create a directory structure for your module that represents the port’s category and name. Copy the 
contents of the template directory to your new directory. We use the example of creating a module 
named /pbi-build/modules/irc/conspire. 
 
# mkdir -p irc/conspire 
# cp -R template/* irc/conspire/ 
# ls -F irc/conspire 
build.sh        kmenu-dir/      overlay-dir/    preportmake.sh 
copy-files      mime-dir/       pbi.conf 
 
Most PBIs can be successfully built after modifying a few lines in pbi.conf and kmenu-dir/0mymenu. 
This section shows you how to make those changes, and the next section demonstrates more advanced 
configurations. 
To successfully configure your module, you must modify the following variables in the  
pbi.conf file. 
• 
PROGNAME: The name of the PBI. This should be the same name as the FreeBSD 
port. Don’t include the version number unless there is already another PBI for a 
different version. 
• 
PROGWEB: The Main Web Site URL for the port as listed at Freshports. 
• 
PROGAUTHOR: Most software is maintained by a project rather than an individual. 
Examples of suitable values are The Mozilla Foundation (for firefox) or the BitchX 
team (for bitchx).  
• 
PROGICON: At Freshports, check the pkg-plist in the CVSWeb for the port to find 
the path to the png file representing the icon for the application. If there is more 
than one, look for the png with the same name as the port. If there is no png for the 
software, check the software’s website to see if it has an icon image. If there is an 
image available, download the image, convert it to png if it is in another format, 
save the png to the module’s overlay-dir directory, and provide only the name of 
the png. 
• 
PBIPORT: The full path to the port to be built. 
                                                 
 
21 http://wiki.pcbsd.org/index.php/Using_the_PBI_Builder 

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
337 
Here is an example of the changes made to /pbi-build/modules/irc/conspire/pbi.conf: 
 
# Program Name 
PROGNAME="conspire" 
 
# Program Website 
PROGWEB="http://confluence.atheme.org/display/CON/Home" 
 
# Program Author 
PROGAUTHOR="Conspire Team" 
 
# Default Icon (Relative to overlay-dir) 
# Please only use PNG files for the program icon 
PROGICON="share/pixmaps/conspire.png" 
 
# FreeBSD Port we want to build 
PBIPORT="/usr/ports/irc/conspire" 
 
Next, you must modify the first three variables in kmenu-dir/0mymenu. 
• 
ExePath: The path to the executable that should start when the application is 
launched. You can find the correct path name at Freshports. Click the CVSWeb 
link for the port, and then click the pkg-plist. The binary has “bin” somewhere in 
the path. If there are multiple binary paths, select the binary that seems the most 
reasonable name for the application. 
• 
ExeIcon: The same path you used in PROGICON= in pbi.conf. This allows the icon 
to show in the KDE menu. 
• 
ExeDescr: A short (2–3 words) description that shows up in the KDE menu. 
The example for /pbi-build/modules/irc/conspire/kmenu-dir/0mymenu looks like this: 
 
ExePath: bin/conspire 
ExeIcon: share/pixmaps/conspire.png 
ExeDescr: IRC Client 
 
When you finish making your changes, ensure that the system is connected to the Internet because 
you require connectivity to build the underlying port. 
You’re now ready to cd into the /pbi-build directory and start the pbibuld.sh script. Include the 
name of the module you wish to build. If you don’t provide any arguments, the script builds every 
module that exists in the modules directory. The script provides some messages as the build progresses, 
as seen in the following example: 
 
# cd /pbi-build 
# ./pbibuild.sh irc/conspire 
Running portsnap to update ports tree 
Starting module traversal... 
Copying /pbi-build/buildworld to /pbi-build/pbisandbox 
Copying /pbi-build/ports to /pbi-build/pbisandbox/usr/ports 
Starting build of irc/conspire 
Rebuilding module irc/conspire...

Found preportmake.sh, running it... 
Running port build... 
SUCCESS! Build finished for irc/conspire 
# 
 
If you want to watch the details of the build process, you can monitor the build log using “tail -f 
/pbi-build/outgoing/irc/conspire/build.log” and substitute the pathname for your PBI. 
Although the PBI build process is completely automated and should just work, it does take time. The 
amount of time depends upon the size of the application, the number of dependencies, and the speed of 
your build system. 
When the build is finished, you receive your prompt back and the PBI is placed in a subdirectory of 
/pbi-build/outgoing/ with the same name as the module you built. In this example, the PBI is found in 
/pbi-build/outgoing/irc/conspire/conspire4.0.35-PV0.pbi. 
Advanced Module Configuration 
Most PBIs can be built by simply modifying the variables mentioned in the previous section. This section 
provides an overview of the more advanced configurations that are possible through modifying the other 
variables and files that come with the modules template. 
• 
build.sh: This script is run after all the files have been copied to the PBI’s 
directory and can contain any commands you wish to run at that time. The PBI 
Module Builder Guide
22 provides an example that modifies the version number. 
• 
copy-files: It is rare to need this file, but you can use it to modify where certain 
files get populated to. 
• 
kmenu-dir/0mymenu: The variables in this file control how the application appears 
in the KDE menu. Table 14-2 provides a description of each variable. 
• 
mime-dir/00mymime: Some applications require their MIME types to be listed to 
work correctly. See the PBI Module Builder Guide for usage examples and gotchas. 
• 
overlay-dir/: PBI builder automatically populates all the files needed by the PBI, 
according to the underlying port’s instructions. If you have an additional file you 
would like to include (for example a README for the PBI) or a customized 
graphic, include it here. You can also customize the PBI scripts that came with this 
directory but should only do so if you have a good reason to make the change. 
• 
pbi.conf: Table 14-3 summarizes the remaining variables in this file. 
• 
preportmake.sh: Allows you to execute commands needed for the port to build 
properly. See the PBI Module Builder Guide for an example.

Table 14-2. Variables that Control a PBI’s Appearance in the KDE Menu 
Variable 
Description 
ExePath 
The path to the application’s executable as listed at Freshports. 
ExeIcon 
The path to the application’s icon as listed at Freshports or the name of the custom 
icon you have created in overlay-dir/. 
ExeDescr 
A brief description of the application. 
ExeNoDesktop 
Set to 0 if you want a desktop icon and to 1 if you don’t.  
ExeNoMenu 
Set to 0 if you want an icon in the KDE menu and 1 if you don’t. 
ExeRunRoot 
Some applications require superuser access to run correctly. Set this to 1 to require 
the user to enter the administrative password when the application launches. 
ExeRunShell 
Set to 0 if the application should run in a GUI and set to 1 if the application is 
command-line based and should be executed in a Konsole session. 
ExeNotify 
Set to 0 to disable the bouncy application loading icon and set to 1 to enable it (the 
preferred setting). 
ExeLink 
Set to 1 to open the ExePath value in Konqueror, and set to 0 to launch the ExePath 
value as an executable. 
ExeWebLink 
If the ExePath value is an URL, set to 1 to open the URL in Konqueror; otherwise, 
leave it set as 0. 
ExeTaskbar 
Places application in system tray; this feature is currently unimplemented. 
ExeOwndir 
0 places the application name in top level directory of KDE menu, 1 places the 
application name in its own directory under the category indicated by ExeKdeCat, and 
2 places the application name in the category indicated by ExeKdeCat. 
ExeKdeCat 
Set to one of the category names listed in Kickoff ➤ Applications. 
 
If you right-click Kickoff and select Menu Editor, you can see the settings that come with every 
application in the KDE menu. Comparing the General and Advanced tab of an application should give 
you a better understanding of the effect that the variables in Table 14-3 have on the KDE menu. Figure 
14-4 shows a screenshot for the installed conspire PBI.

Table 14-3 briefly describes the remaining variables that can be set in pbi.conf. 
Table 14-3. Remaining Variables for pbi.conf 
Variable 
Description 
PBIVERSION= 
Enables you to override the PBI version if the build fails to automatically  
detect it. 
PROGLIBS= 
Leave at AUTO; otherwise, you have to manually populate the PBI’s directory. If 
you need to override a file that is populated, use copy-files instead. 
PBIUPDATE= 
Leave as-is as needed by the PBI build server. 
OTHERPORT= 
If you want to include another port in your PBI (besides the dependencies listed 
in the port’s Makefile), add its category and portname; this is useful for 
applications that have additional plugins or skins that are available as separate 
ports. 
MAKEOPTS= 
Enables you to pass make targets that are used when the PBI is built; Chapter 10 
discusses targets. 
BUILDKEY= 
Committers can temporarily change this number to force the build server to 
rebuild the PBI. 

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
341 
Variable 
Description 
PBIDISABLEFONTLINK= 
Use this if you want to use the application’s internal fonts instead of the system 
fonts. 
PBIKEEPGL= 
Use this to use the applications internal libGL libraries instead of the system 
libraries. 
PBIPRUNE* 
Several prune variables allow you to keep include directories, python files, perl 
files, or doc files that were created during the PBI build. 
BUILDINMATE= 
Uncomment this line if you are building an inmate file instead of a PBI. 
INMATEVER= 
Uncomment and set a version number for the inmate; increment the number 
for each later version. 
Troubleshooting 
As long as there isn’t a problem with the underlying FreeBSD port and assuming you have followed all of 
the steps in the section on “Building your First PBI,” PBI Builder should just work. If the build fails, 
double-check Freshports to confirm that the port isn’t broken, forbidden, or restricted. 
If the port looks fine, check the error message that appeared when you received your prompt back. 
It contains the number of the script that failed. The 2.1 in the following example indicates that /pbi-
build/scripts/2.1.startmake.sh failed. Any script with a lower number is successful, and any script 
with a higher number has not run yet. 
 
ERROR: 2.1 Build failed of irc/conspire!!!  
 
When PBI Builder exits, it compresses the log of the PBI build process, so you need to uncompress it 
with the bunzip2 command. Take the time to go through the build log, starting at the end, because this is 
where the error occurred. Usually, the problem is obvious from the error. If it is not, work your way 
backwards to see what happened successfully before the error occurred. If the error indicates that the 
port build was unable to fetch a required file, double-check your Internet connectivity. 
After you resolve the error, remove the .lock file and rerun buildpbi.sh. The build starts over again 
to ensure that your sandbox environment is clean. 
If you are stuck, send an email to the Pbi-dev mailing list that includes the error and enough 
contextual information to enable other developers to help you figure out what went wrong. 
Testing and Submitting Your PBI 
After you have a PBI, you want to test it yourself before making it available for others to test. From 
Dolphin, navigate to your PBI, right-click it, and select Open with PBI Launcher. The PNG for your PBI 
should show in the PBI’s icon within Dolphin. As the PBI installs, check the initial installation screen to 
ensure that the Vendor (PROGAUTHOR variable) and URL (PROGURL variable) are displayed correctly. 
After the PBI is finished installing, start the application to make sure that the correct binary starts. After 
the application launches, try out all the screens in the program to make sure that nothing is missing and 

CHAPTER 14 ■ BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
 
342 
none of the menus causes the application to crash. Finally, find your PBI in Menu Editor, and make sure 
that all the desired features show for the KDE menu. 
If you find a typo or need to fix a configuration file in your module, you don’t have to rebuild the 
underlying port. Simply run /pbi-build/scripts/3.makepbi.sh after making your configuration change. 
This rerolls the PBI so you can test your changes. 
■ Tip pbibuild.sh creates a clean environment every time it runs. This means that it removes everything that 
was previously built and starts over again. If your build successfully finished, you don’t have to rebuild to reroll the 
PBI with your new configurations. You can save a lot of time by running the 3.makepbi.sh script. 
When you are satisfied that your PBI works correctly, create a compressed archive of its directory. 
The following example creates a compressed archive named /conspire.tar.bz2. 
 
# cd /pbi-build/modules/irc 
# tar cvf /conspire.tar 
# bzip2 /conspire.tar 
 
Upload the archive to a publicly available server. If you don’t have a server of your own, contact the 
leader of the PBI development team
23 for credentials to the PBI ftp server. After the PBI is uploaded, send 
an email to the Pbi-dev mailing list.
24 Your email should include a subject line of “submit module 
category/portname” (for example, submit module irc/conspire). The body of the email should contain 
the location where testers can download the archive for the module to build and test it. 
Summary 
This chapter discussed the most advanced tasks you can perform on your PC-BSD system, including 
those that enable you to contribute software back to the PC-BSD community so other users can benefit 
from it. 
We cover a lot of ground in this book. It is our hope that you enjoyed learning more about the PC-
BSD operating system and that this book is a handy guide you refer to often. We also hope that you have 
as much fun reading and using it as we had writing it!

Reference Tables 
The tables in this appendix provide a handy reference. 
Table A-1 describes the contents of each folder that is installed on the root of the PC-BSD filesystem. 
You will see these folders if you click the Root folder in Dolphin. Most of these folders are system folders, 
and should be left as-is where indicated in the table. If you want to create files on your PC-BSD 
computer, create them in your Home folder. Never delete or modify a file in a system folder unless you 
know what you are doing. 
Table A-1. Description of PC-BSD default directories 
Folder 
Description 
bin 
Stores user programs that came with the operating system. You should leave this directory 
as-is. 
boot 
Stores the files the operating system needs to load. You should leave this directory as-is. 
compat 
Provides the files that Linux programs need to run. You should leave this directory as-is. 
dev 
Contains information your operating system needs to access hardware devices. Note that 
you rarely, if ever, have to install drivers on PC-BSD; if you do, they will not go here. You 
should leave this directory as-is.  
etc 
Contains configuration information needed by the operating system. You should leave this 
directory as-is. 
home 
Contains home directories, one for each user on the system. Users should store their own 
files somewhere in their home directory. 
lib 
Contains libraries needed by the programs that came with the operating system. You should 
leave this directory as-is. 
libexec 
Contains libraries needed by the programs that came with the operating system. You should 
leave this directory as-is.

DVD. 
mnt 
Used by some programs to provide access to data on other filesystems. 
PCBSD 
Contains the programs, scripts, and configuration files that are unique to PC-BSD. 
proc 
Contains information about running processes. Each subdirectory is a number that 
represents the ID of a running process. 
Programs

information it needs to run. The associated subdirectory will be removed for you when you 
uninstall the PBI. Chapter 8 discusses PBIs in detail. 
rescue 
Contains the programs needed to rescue a system. Chapter 13 will show you how to repair a 
PC-BSD system. 
root 
The home directory for the super (administrative) user. 
sbin 
Contains programs installed with the operating system that only the super (administrative) 
user can run. 
tmp 
Contains temporary files used by the operating system and programs. 
usr 
Contains the user applications, as well as their libraries and configuration files, which aren’t 
considered essential to the operating system. 
var 
Contains files which vary (change often) such as system logs and print jobs. 
 
Table A-2 describes which KDE applications are available to perform common tasks. The tasks have 
been sorted in alphabetical order to make them easier to find. For each task, the name of the application 
is given. If you type the name of the application into the search bar at http://docs.kde.org, you can read 
the Guide for that application. Additionally, if you press F1 while in the application, it should also open 
up its Guide. You will find all the locations in the Table in Kickoff ➤ Applications. 
In addition to the applications mentioned here, you will find dozens more in the Development, 
Education, and Games categories of Kickoff ➤ Applications.

Table A-3 lists some popular open source applications that are available as PBIs. They are again 
organized by alphabetical task. The website for each application is listed if you want to research the 
program's capabilities before installing the PBI.  
If you want to install any of the applications listed in Table A-3, be sure to install them using the 
Software Manager utility described in Chapter 8. Not only is this the easiest way to install the application 
but it also guarantees that the program has been pretested to work on PC-BSD. It provides the added 
benefit that PC-BSD will let you know whenever a newer version of the application becomes available.
