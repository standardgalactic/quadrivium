Journalizing and Posting 
 Transactions
Campus Advantage (CA) provides a comprehensive range of 
 student residential services in the following areas: management, 
development, acquisition, and consulting. It specializes in the 
 creation of modern, full-service facilities that are secure, private, 
and equipped with all of the tools that today’s students need for 
success. Its  communities are no-hassle alternatives to dorm living 
with full dining service options. CA has facilities across the country, 
but each student residence refl ects the unique identity of the school 
and community it serves.
As with all businesses, CA relies on an accounting system to 
maintain a record of transactions from the source document 
through the preparation of the trial balance and fi nancial state-
ments. In this chapter, we discuss source documents, the chart of 
accounts, and the process used to journalize and post transactions. 
And, just in case an error is made, we address how to fi nd and 
 correct errors.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter should 
enable you to:
LO1  Describe the flow of data 
from source documents 
through the trial balance.
LO2  Describe the chart of accounts 
as a means of classifying 
financial information.
LO3  Describe and explain the 
purpose of source documents.
LO4  Journalize transactions.
LO5  Post to the general ledger 
and prepare a trial balance.
LO6  Explain how to find and 
correct errors.
COLEONG/DREAMSTIME
Each chapter opens with 
a colorful image and a 
description of a real com-
pany. By reading the open-
ing description, you will 
find out why it’s important 
to master the information 
that is covered in the chap-
ter. The openers can help 
you visualize how account-
ing is used in the business 
world and, therefore, 
why it’s known as the 
“language of business.” 
Add Some Color to Your Learning!
Throughout the text, you will be introduced to many important terms and types of accounts. To help you learn 
the different terms and types of accounts, we have coded many of them using the following color key in Part 1:
Capital
Liabilities
Assets
Drawing
Revenues
Expenses
Income Summary (Net Income/Net Loss)
Contra-Assets

Preface
LEARNING OBJECTIVES CONNECT THE CHAPTER 
COVERAGE FROM BEGINNING TO END
By paying attention to the Learning Objectives, you can focus on what is important. The Learning Objectives appear 
in many places throughout the chapter. Here’s where you will find the Learning Objectives (LOs):
CHAPTER OPENER PAGE
The first page of the chapter lists all 
of the Learning Objectives for the 
chapter.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter
should enable you to:
LO1  Prepare financial statements 
with the aid of a work sheet.
LO2  Journalize and post closing 
entries.
LO3  Prepare a post-closing trial 
balance.
LO4  List and describe the steps 
in the accounting cycle.
MARGINS
When the chapter is presenting 
coverage for a certain Learning 
Objective, the LO is stated at the 
beginning of the section.
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The work sheet prepared in Chapter 5 supplies most of the information needed to 
prepare an income statement, a statement of owner’s equity, and a balance sheet. The 
statements and work sheet columns from which they are derived for Jessie Jane’s 
Campus Delivery Service are shown in Figures 6-1 and 6-2.
As you refer to the financial statements in Figures 6-1 and 6-2, notice the place-
ment of dollar signs, single rulings, and double rulings. Dollar signs are placed at the 
top of each column and beneath rulings. Single rulings indicate addition or subtraction, 
and double rulings are placed under totals. Notice that each statement heading con-
tains three lines: (1) company name, (2) statement title, and (3) period ended or date.
LO1 Prepare financial 
statements with the 
aid of a work sheet.
KEY POINTS TO REMEMBER
At the beginning of the Self-Study 
section, each Learning Objective is 
stated along with the most impor-
tant information covered in the 
chapter. 
LO1 Prepare financial statements with 
the aid of a work sheet.
The work sheet is used as an aid in preparing:
 
1. adjusting entries,
 
2. financial statements, and
 
3. closing entries.
The following classifications are used for accounts reported on 
the balance sheet.
 
• 
 Current assets include cash and assets that will be con-
verted into cash or consumed within either one year or 
the normal operating cycle of the business, whichever is 
longer. An operating cycle is the time required to purchase 
supplies and services and convert them back into cash.
 
• 
 Property, plant, and equipment, also called plant assets 
or long-term assets, represent assets that are expected to 
serve the business for many years.
 
• 
 Current liabilities are liabilities that are due within either 
one year or the normal operating cycle of the business, 
whichever is longer, and that are to be paid out of current 
assets.
 
• 
 Long-term liabilities, or long-term debt, are obligations 
that are not expected to be paid within a year and do not 
require the use of  current assets.

A BROADER VIEW
Payroll Fraud—Paying for Ghosts
A supervisor at Haas Transfer Warehouse embezzled $12,000 
from the company by collecting paychecks for former 
employees. When an employee left the company, the super-
visor continued to submit a department time report for the 
employee. This caused a paycheck to be generated for the 
“ghost” employee. The supervisor then simply kept this pay-
check when others were distributed to actual employees.
This fraud shows the importance of two procedures that 
appear in this chapter: (1) a time card, plastic card, or badge 
should be used for each employee to keep an accurate record 
of time worked and (2) payment by direct deposit or electronic 
funds transfer to the employee’s bank is a good internal 
control.

Ch. 1—We have added brief 
coverage of International 
Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) and forensic 
accounting.
Forensic Accounting.
• 
 Forensic accounting is a rapidly growing segment of 
accounting practice. It includes fraud detection, fraud prevention, litigation 
 support, business valuations, expert witness services, and other investigative 
activities. Public accounting firms offer forensic accounting services, but foren-
sic accountants also work for insurance companies, banks, law enforcement 
agencies, and other organizations. By meeting certain requirements, and passing 
the Certified Fraud Examiner exam, a forensic accountant may earn a Certified 
Fraud Examiner (CFE) designation.
The adjustment for merchandise inventory is done in two steps. 
1.   Remove the beginning inventory from the merchandise inventory account by 
making the following entry:

Preface
Ch. 5—Journal entries for 
the adjusting entries are 
now shown with T account 
presentations; chapter con-
tent presentation has been 
revised to cover posting of 
adjusting entries before work 
sheet coverage—this makes 
skipping work sheet cover-
age easier for those wanting 
to do so; for those using the 
work sheet, we enhanced 
the linkage between work 
sheet adjustments and adjust-
ing entries. In the appendix, 
graphs have been added to 
the depreciation method 
examples to assist visual 
learners.

Ch. 11—Impact of sales dis-
counts has been added to the 
gross profit coverage.
In a more realistic situation, we must compute net sales and cost of goods sold, in 
order to compute gross profit. Multiple steps are involved. To illustrate, we use three 
of the four new accounts described in Chapter 10, the four new accounts described in 
this chapter, and the merchandise inventory balances. Assume that Northern Micro 
has the following sales, purchases, and merchandise inventory balances for the year 
ended December 31, 20--:
 
Sales 
$201,500
 
Sales returns and allowances 
1,200

Figure 11-7 uses these balances to compute net sales, net purchases, cost of goods 
sold, and gross profit. The following four steps in computing gross profit are labeled 
in the figure:

Quite possibly the easiest-to-understand learning program on the market, this text-
book, with accompanying software, teaches students all the aspects of computerized 
accounting and the operating procedures for all Windows-based programs at the 
same time. The software was designed to be very similar to the commercial software 
packages used in business, which will help students hit the ground running when 
they get that first real job. With its updated design and improved directions, stu-
dents won’t become overwhelmed with the program.

Accounting is the language of business. You must learn this language to understand the impact 
of economic events on a specifi c company. Common, everyday terms have very precise meanings 
when used in accounting. For example, you have probably heard terms like asset, liability, rev-
enue, expense, and net income. Take a moment to jot down how you would defi ne each of these 
terms. After reading and studying Chapter 2, compare your defi nitions with those developed in 
this text. This comparison will show whether you can trust your current understanding of account-
ing terms. Whether you intend to pursue a career in accounting or simply wish to understand the 
impact of business transactions, you need a clear understanding of this language.
THE PURPOSE OF ACCOUNTING
The purpose of accounting is to provide financial information about the current 
operations and financial condition of a business to individuals, agencies, and organiza-
tions. As shown in Figure 1-1, owners, managers, creditors, and government agencies 
all need accounting information. Other users of accounting information include cus-
tomers, clients, labor unions, stock exchanges, and financial analysts.
LO1 Describe the purpose 
of accounting.
FIGURE 1-1 Users of Accounting Information
USER
INFORMATION NEEDED
DECISIONS MADE BY USERS
Owners—Present and future
Company’s profitability and current financial 
 condition.
If business is good, owners may consider making addi-
tional investments for growth. If business is poor, they 
may want to talk to management to find out why and may 
consider closing the business.
Managers—May or may not own 
business
Detailed measures of business performance.
Managers need to make operating decisions. How much 
and what kinds of inventory should be carried? Is business 
strong enough to support higher wages for employees?
Creditors––Present and future
Company’s profitability, debt outstanding, 
and assets that could be used to secure 
debt.
Should a loan be granted to this business? If so, what 
amount of debt can the business support, and what inter-
est rate should be charged?
Government Agencies—National, 
state, and local
Company’s profitability, cash flows, and overall 
financial condition.
The IRS will decide how much income tax the business 
must pay. Local governments may be willing to adjust 
property taxes paid by the business to encourage it to stay 
in town.
THE ACCOUNTING PROCESS
Accounting is a system of gathering financial information about a business and report-
ing this information to users. The six major steps of the accounting process are analyz-
ing, recording, classifying, summarizing, reporting, and interpreting (Figure 1-2). 
Computers are often used in the recording, classifying, summarizing, and reporting 
steps. Whether or not computers are used, the accounting concepts and techniques 
are the same. Information entered into the computer system must reflect a proper 
 application of these concepts. Otherwise, the output will be meaningless.
LO2 Describe the accounting 
process.

Analyzing
• 
 is looking at events that have taken place and thinking about how they 
affect the business.
Recording
• 
 is entering financial information about events into the accounting 
system. Although this can be done with paper and pencil, most businesses use 
computers to perform routine record-keeping operations.
Classifying
• 
 is sorting and grouping similar items together rather than merely keep-
ing a simple, diary-like record of numerous events.
Summarizing
• 
 is the aggregation of many similar events to provide information 
that is easy to understand. For example, a firm may buy and sell baseballs during 
the year. Summarizing provides information on the total baseballs bought and 
sold and the change in the number of baseballs held from the beginning to the 
end of the period.
Reporting
• 
 is telling the results. In accounting, it is common to use tables of num-
bers to report results.
Interpreting
• 
 is deciding the meaning and importance of the information in various 
reports. This may include ratio analysis to help explain how pieces of information 
relate to one another.
GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING 
PRINCIPLES (GAAP)
Soon after the stock market crash of 1929, the federal government established the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The purpose of this government agency 
is to help develop standards for reporting financial information to stockholders. The 
SEC currently has authority over 12,000 companies listed on the major stock 
exchanges (New York, American, and NASDAQ). It has the power to require these 
firms to follow certain rules when preparing their financial statements. These rules are 
referred to as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
Rather than developing GAAP on its own, the SEC encouraged the creation of a 
private standard-setting body. It did so because it believed the private sector had better 
access to the resources and talent necessary to develop these standards. Since 1973, 
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has filled this role. In developing 
accounting standards, FASB follows a specific process and relies on the advice of many 
organizations. When an accounting issue is identified, the following steps are fol-
lowed:
1. The issue is placed on FASB’s agenda. This lets everyone know that the Board 
plans to develop a standard addressing this issue.
2. After researching an issue, FASB issues a discussion memorandum. This 
document identifies the pros and cons of various accounting treatments for 
an event.
3. To gather additional views on the issue, the Board will often hold public 
hearings around the country. Interested parties are invited to express their 
opinions at these hearings.
LO3 Define GAAP and 
describe the process 
used by FASB to 
develop these 
principles.

4. Following these hearings, the Board issues an exposure draft. This document 
explains the rules that FASB believes firms should follow in accounting for 
this event.
5. After considering feedback on the exposure draft, the Board issues a final 
statement of financial accounting standards (SFAS).
Throughout this process, many parties participate by testifying at public hearings 
or by sending letters to the Board explaining why they agree or disagree with the pro-
posed standard. These parties include the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants (AICPA), the American Accounting Association (AAA), the Institute of 
Management Accountants (IMA), the Financial Executives Institute (FEI), corporate 
executives and accountants, representatives from  the investment community, analysts, 
bankers, industry associations, and the SEC and other government agencies. Clearly, 
FASB considers the views of a wide range of parties. By doing so, it maximizes the 
likelihood of developing and gaining acceptance of the most appropriate accounting 
and disclosure requirements.
The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issues accounting standards 
followed by many firms in countries outside the United States. These are called 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). In recent years, the IASB and 
FASB have worked together to try to minimize the differences in these standards. 
These standards may eventually converge into one set of standards used around the 
world.
THREE TYPES OF OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES
One or more persons may own a business. Businesses are classified according to who 
owns them and the specific way they are organized. Three types of ownership struc-
tures are (1) sole proprietorship, (2) partnership, and (3) corporation (Figure 1-3). 
Accountants provide information to owners of all three types of ownership 
 structures.
LO4 Define three types of 
business ownership 
structures.
The largest corporations 
in the United States 
are known as the 
“Fortune 500.”
Most businesses in the 
United States operate as 
sole proprietorships or 
partnerships. However, 
corporations earn the 
highest amount of revenue.
SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP
A sole proprietorship is owned by one person. The owner is usually called a proprietor. 
The proprietor often manages the business. The owner assumes all risks for the busi-
ness, and personal assets can be taken to pay creditors. The advantage of a sole pro-
prietorship is that the owner can make all decisions.
PARTNERSHIP
A partnership is owned by more than one person. One or more partners may manage 
the business. Like proprietors, partners assume the risks for the business, and their

assets may be taken to pay creditors. An advantage of a partnership is that owners 
share risks and decision making. A disadvantage is that partners may disagree about 
the best way to run the business.
CORPORATION
A corporation is owned by stockholders (or shareholders). Corporations may have 
many owners, and they usually employ professional managers. The owners’ risk is 
usually limited to their initial investment, and they often have very little influence on 
the business decisions.
TYPES OF BUSINESSES
Businesses are classified according to the type of service or product provided. Some 
businesses provide a service. Others sell a product. A business that provides a service 
is called a service business. A business that buys a product from another business to 
sell to customers is called a merchandising business. A business that makes a product 
to sell is called a manufacturing business. You will learn about all three types of 
businesses in this book. Figure 1-4 lists examples of types of businesses organized by 
activity.

types of businesses by

Even small businesses like those that provide guided horse-

systems. Proper records must be maintained for the cost of 
the horses, feed, food served, tour guides’ salaries, and office 
expenses. Without this information, the company would not 
know how much to charge and whether a profit is made on 
these trips.

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN ACCOUNTING
Accounting offers many career opportunities. The positions described below require 
varying amounts of education, experience, and technological skill.
ACCOUNTING CLERKS
Businesses with large quantities of accounting tasks to perform daily often employ 
accounting clerks to record, sort, and file accounting information. Often, accounting 
clerks will specialize in cash, payroll, accounts receivable, accounts payable, inventory, 
or purchases. As a result, they are involved with only a small portion of the total 
accounting responsibilities for the firm. Accounting clerks usually have at least one 
year of accounting education.
BOOKKEEPERS AND PARA-ACCOUNTANTS
Bookkeepers generally supervise the work of accounting clerks, help with daily 
accounting work, and summarize accounting information. In small-to-medium-sized 
businesses, the bookkeeper may also help managers and owners interpret the account-
ing information. Bookkeepers usually have one to two years of accounting education 
and experience as an accounting clerk.
Para-accountants provide many accounting, auditing, or tax services under the 
direct supervision of an accountant. A typical para-accountant has a two-year degree 
or significant accounting and bookkeeping experience.
ACCOUNTANTS
The difference between accountants and bookkeepers is not always clear, particularly 
in smaller companies where bookkeepers also help interpret the accounting informa-
tion. In large companies, the distinction is clearer. Bookkeepers focus on the processing 
of accounting data. Accountants design the accounting information system and focus 
on analyzing and interpreting information. They also look for important trends in the 
data and study the impact of alternative decisions.
Most accountants enter the field with a college degree in accounting. In fact, since 
many states require 150 credit hours to sit for the CPA exam, many students are also 
earning a master’s degree in accounting before entering the profession. Accountants 
are employed in public accounting, private (managerial) accounting, and governmen-
tal and not-for-profit accounting (Figure 1-5).

Public Accounting
Public accountants offer services in much the same way as doctors and lawyers. The 
public accountant can achieve professional recognition as a Certified Public 
Accountant (CPA). This is done by meeting certain educational and experience 
requirements as determined by each state and passing a uniform examination prepared 
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Many CPAs work alone, while others work for local, regional, or national 
accounting firms that vary in scope and size. The largest public accounting firms in the 
United States are known as the “Big Four.” They are Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, 
and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Services offered by public accountants are listed below.
Auditing.
• 
 Auditing involves the application of standard review and testing pro-
cedures to be certain that proper accounting policies and practices have been 
followed. The purpose of the audit is to provide an independent opinion that the 
financial information about a business is fairly presented in a manner consistent 
with generally accepted accounting principles.
Taxation.
• 
 Tax specialists advise on tax planning, prepare tax returns, and repre-
sent clients before governmental agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service.
Management Advisory Services.
• 
 Given the financial training and business experi-
ence of public accountants, many businesses seek their advice on a wide variety of 
managerial issues. Often, accounting firms are involved in designing computerized 
accounting systems.
Forensic Accounting.
• 
 Forensic accounting is a rapidly growing segment of 
accounting practice. It includes fraud detection, fraud prevention, litigation 
 support, business valuations, expert witness services, and other investigative 
activities. Public accounting firms offer forensic accounting services, but foren-
sic accountants also work for insurance companies, banks, law enforcement 
agencies, and other organizations. By meeting certain requirements, and passing 
the Certified Fraud Examiner exam, a forensic accountant may earn a Certified 
Fraud Examiner (CFE) designation.
In 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was passed by Congress to help improve 
reporting practices of public companies. The act was in response to accounting scan-
dals at firms like Enron, WorldCom, Cendant, Xerox, and others. Key provisions of 
SOX are listed below.
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was created to 
• 
enforce SOX rules and regulations. The PCAOB also has authority to set audit-
ing standards for public company audits and to perform inspections of auditing 
firms.
External auditors are required to report on the effectiveness of a public company’s 
• 
accounting procedures.
Auditing firms are prohibited from offering many nonaudit services to their public 
• 
audit clients.
Auditing firms must rotate audit partners off audit engagements every five years.
• 
The CEO and CFO must personally certify that the financial statements are 
• 
accurate.
It is difficult to guarantee that information provided in financial statements is always 
complete and accurate. These measures are a step in the right direction. If our economy 
and financial markets are to function properly, information provided in financial state-
ments must be reliable.
ACCOUNTS  
PAYABLE MANAGER
Responsible for all activ-
ities in the accounts pay-
able function. Ensures 
timely payments of ven-
dor invoices and expense 
vouchers and maintains 
accurate records and 
control reports. Reviews

reports and accounts 
payable register to ensure 
accuracy. May require 
a bachelor’s degree in a 
related area and at least 
7 years of experience in 
the field. Familiar with 
a variety of the field’s 
concepts, practices, and 
procedures. Relies on

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Private (Managerial) Accounting
Many accountants are employees of private business firms. The controller oversees the 
entire accounting process and is the principal accounting officer of the company. 
Private or managerial accountants perform a wide variety of services for the business. 
These services are listed below.
Accounting Information Systems.
• 
 Accountants in this area design and implement 
manual and computerized accounting systems.
Financial Accounting.
• 
 Based on the accounting data prepared by the bookkeepers 
and accounting clerks, accountants prepare various reports and financial state-
ments and help in analyzing operating, investing, and financing decisions.
Cost Accounting.
• 
 The cost of producing specific products or providing services 
must be measured. Further analysis is also done to determine whether the prod-
ucts and services are produced in the most cost-effective manner.
Budgeting.
• 
 In the budgeting process, accountants help managers develop a finan-
cial plan.
Tax Accounting.
• 
 Instead of hiring a public accountant, a company may have its 
own accountants. They focus on tax planning, preparation of tax returns, and 
dealing with the Internal Revenue Service and other governmental agencies.
Internal Auditing.
• 
 Internal auditors review the operating and accounting control 
procedures adopted by management to make sure the controls are adequate and 
are being followed. They also monitor the accuracy and timeliness of the reports 
provided to management and to external parties.
A managerial accountant can achieve professional status as a Certified Management 
Accountant (CMA). This is done by passing a uniform examination offered by the 
Institute of Management Accountants. An internal auditor can achieve professional 
recognition as a Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) by passing the uniform examination 
offered by the Institute of Internal Auditors.
Governmental and Not-for-Profit Accounting
Thousands of governmental and not-for-profit organizations (states, cities, schools, 
churches, and hospitals) gather and report financial information. These organizations 
employ a large number of accountants. Since these entities are not profit oriented, the 
rules are somewhat different for governmental and not-for-profit organizations. 
However, many accounting procedures are similar to those found in profit-seeking 
enterprises.
JOB OPPORTUNITIES
Job growth in some areas will be much greater than in others. Newspaper advertise-
ments often indicate that accountants and accounting clerks are expected to have 
computer skills. Computer skills definitely increase the opportunities available to you 
in your career. Almost every business needs accountants, accounting clerks, and 
bookkeepers. Figure 1-6 shows the expected growth for different types of businesses. 
Notice that growth will be greatest in health care services. Chapters 2 through 9 
 introduce accounting skills that you will need to work in a service business, like 
health care. Chapter 10 begins the discussion of merchandising businesses. Accounting 
for manufacturing businesses is addressed in the last chapters of the book.
Figure 1-7 shows the expected demand for accounting skills. A 12.5% increase in 
demand is expected for bookkeeping, accounting, and auditing clerks. These types of 
CONTROLLER
Responsible for direct-
ing an organization’s

and initiatives. Prepares 
financial reports and 
presents findings and 
recommendations to top 
management. Requires a 
bachelor’s degree and at 
least 15 years of direct 
experience in the field. 
Typically requires a CPA. 
Usually reports to top 
financial officer or CEO.

FIGURE 1-6 Expected Growth
The growth in the number of new jobs from 2006 to 2016 will vary according to industry. The major area of growth 
will be in health care services. Businesses providing educational, health care, and professional/business services 
are expected to have the strongest employment growth. Moderate growth is expected in merchandising 
businesses and state and local governments. Employment in manufacturing and the federal 
government is expected to decline. Total employment for all industry sectors will increase 10.4%.

Regardless of the type of career you desire, writing skills are important in business 
and your personal life. Becoming a good writer requires practice and a strategy for the 
process used to prepare memos, letters, and other documents. On pages 12, 13, and 
14, Ken Davis offers an excellent approach to managing your writing. Take a moment 
to read Ken’s tips. Then, practice his approach by completing the writing assignments 
as you finish each chapter.

Here’s a secret: the business writing that you and I do—the writing that gets the world’s work done—requires no special 
gift. It can be managed, like any other business process.
Managing writing is largely a matter of managing time. Writing is a process, and like any process it can be done efficiently 
or inefficiently. Unfortunately, most of us are pretty inefficient writers. That’s because we try to get each word, each sen-
tence, right the first time. Given a letter to write, we begin with the first sentence. We think about that sentence, write it, 
revise it, even check its spelling, before going on to the second  sentence. In an hour of writing, we might spend 45 or 50 
minutes doing this kind of detailed drafting. We spend only a few minutes on overall planning at the beginning and only a 
few minutes on overall revising at the end.
That approach to writing is like building a house by starting with the front door: planning, building, finishing—even 
washing the windows—before doing anything with the rest of the house. No wonder most of us have so much trouble 
writing.
Efficient, effective writers take better charge of their writing time. They manage their writing. Like building contractors, 
they spend time planning before they start construction. Once construction has started, they don’t try to do all of the 
finishing touches as they go.
As the following illustration shows, many good writers break their writing process into three main stages: planning, draft-
ing, and revising. They spend more time at the first and third stages than at the second. They also build in some “manage-
ment” time at the beginning and the end, and some break time in the middle. To manage your writing time, try the 
following steps.

At the MANAGING stage (perhaps two or three minutes for a one-hour writing job), remind 
yourself that writing can be managed and that it’s largely a matter of managing time. Plan your 
next hour.
At the PLANNING stage (perhaps 20 minutes out of the hour):
 1. Find the “we.” Define the community to which you and your reader belong. Then ask, 
“How are my reader and I alike and different?”—in knowledge, attitudes, and circumstances.
 2. Define your purpose. Remember the advice a consultant once gave Stanley Tool executives: 
“You’re not in the business of making drills: you’re in the business of making holes.” Too 
many of us lose sight of the difference between making drills and making holes when we 
write letters and memos. We focus on the piece of writing—the tool itself—not its purpose. 
The result: our writing often misses the chance to be as effective as it could be. When you’re 
still at the planning stage, focus on the outcome you want, not on the means you will use to 
achieve it.
 3. Get your stuff together. Learn from those times when you’ve turned a one-hour home-im-
provement project into a three- or four-hour job by having to make repeated trips to the 
hardware store for tools or parts. Before you start the drafting stage of writing, collect the 
information you need.
 4. Get your ducks in a row. Decide on the main points you want to make. Then, make a list or 
rough outline placing your points in the most logical order.
At the DRAFTING STAGE (perhaps 5 minutes out of the hour):
 5. Do it wrong the first time. Do a “quick and dirty” draft, without editing. Think of your 
draft as a “prototype,” written not for the end user but for your own testing and improve-
ment. Stopping to edit while you draft breaks your train of thought and keeps you from 
being a good writer. (Hint: If you are writing at a computer, try turning off the monitor 
during the drafting stage.)
At the BREAK STAGE (perhaps 5 minutes):
 6. Take a break and change hats. Get away from your draft, even if for only a few minutes. 
Come back with a fresh perspective—the reader’s perspective.
At the REVISING STAGE (perhaps 25 minutes):
 7. Signal your turns. Just as if you were driving a car, you’re leading your reader through new 
 territory. Use “turn signals”—and, in addition, but, however, or, therefore, because, for 
 example—to guide your reader from sentence to sentence.
 8. Say what you mean. Put the point of your sentences in the subjects and verbs. For example, 
revise “There are drawbacks to using this accounting method” to “This accounting method 
has some drawbacks.” You’ll be saying what you mean, and you’ll be a more effective 
 communicator.
 9. Pay by the word. Reading your memo requires work. If your sentences are wordy and you 
are slow to get to the point, the reader may decide that it is not worth the effort. Pretend 
you are paying the reader by the word to read your memo. Then, revise your memo to make 
it as short and to the point as possible.
10. Translate into English. Keep your words simple. (Lee Iacocca put both these tips in one 
“commandment of good management”: “Say it in English and keep it short.”) Remember 
that you write to express, not impress.

11. Finish the job. Check your spelling, punctuation, and mechanics.
Finally, at the MANAGING STAGE again (2 to 3 minutes):
12. Evaluate your writing process. Figure out how to improve it next time.
By following these 12 steps, you can take charge of your writing time. Begin today to manage your 
writing. As a United Technologies Corporation advertisement in The Wall Street Journal admon-
ished, “If you want to manage somebody, manage yourself. Do that well and you’ll be ready to 
stop managing and start leading.”

Analyzing Transactions: The 
Accounting Equation
At Rob’s Bike Courier Service in Fort Collins, Colorado, Rob 
believes “less is more.” His small company doesn’t “have a fl eet of 
vehicles, just some pretty cool bicycles.”  His mission is providing 
successful bike delivery service, perfect for both traditional busi-
ness delivery services and residential errands. Since January of 
2005, Rob’s Bike Courier Service has been the alternative to gas-
powered vehicle delivery. Thus, besides great rates and friendly, 
reliable service, Rob off ers earth-friendly service.
Currently, he delivers wholesale bagels from a mid-town baker 
to several downtown coff ee shops.  He does the same for another 
pastry chef.  Rob also picks up recycling materials and will go to a 
customer’s home to fi x fl at bike tires and make repairs.  
Though his company is small, Rob still needs an accounting 
system to maintain records of his business transactions and to 
prepare fi nancial statements. Currently, he uses Quickbooks®, an 
accounting program used by many small companies. In Chapters 2 
through 6, we learn how to account for a service business like Rob’s 
by using an example of a similar company: Jessie Jane’s Campus 
Delivery Service.

The entire accounting process is based on one simple equation, called the accounting equation. 
In this chapter, you will learn how to use this equation to analyze business transactions. You also 
will learn how to prepare fi nancial statements that report the eff ect of these transactions on the 
fi nancial condition of a business.
THE ACCOUNTING ELEMENTS
Before the accounting process can begin, the entity to be accounted for must be 
defined. A business entity is an individual, association, or organization that engages in 
economic activities and controls specific economic resources. This definition allows the 
personal and business finances of an owner to be accounted for separately.
Three basic accounting elements exist for every business entity: assets, liabilities, 
and owner’s equity. These elements are defined below.
ASSETS
Assets are items that are owned by a business and will provide future benefits. 
Examples of assets include cash, merchandise, furniture, fixtures, machinery, buildings, 
and land. Businesses may also have an asset called accounts receivable. This asset rep-
resents the amount of money owed to the business by its customers as a result of 
making sales “on account,” or “on credit.” Making sales on account simply means that 
the customers have promised to pay sometime in the future.
LIABILITIES
Liabilities represent something owed to another business entity. The amount owed 
represents a probable future outflow of assets as a result of a past event or transaction. 
Liabilities are debts or obligations of the business that can be paid with cash, goods, 
or services.
The most common liabilities are accounts payable and notes payable. An account 
payable is an unwritten promise to pay a supplier for assets purchased or services 
received. Acquiring assets or services by promising to make payments in the future is 
referred to as making a purchase “on account,” or “on credit.” Formal written prom-
ises to pay suppliers or lenders specified sums of money at definite future times are 
known as notes payable.
OWNER’S EQUITY
Owner’s equity is the amount by which the business assets exceed the business liabili-
ties. Other terms used for owner’s equity include net worth and capital. If there are no 
business liabilities, the owner’s equity is equal to the total assets.
The owner of a business may have business assets and liabilities as well as nonbusi-
ness assets and liabilities. For example, the business owner probably owns a home, 
clothing, and a car, and perhaps owes the dentist for dental service. These are personal, 
nonbusiness assets and liabilities. According to the business entity concept, nonbusiness 
assets and liabilities are not included in the business entity’s accounting records.
If the owner invests money or other assets in the business, the item invested is 
reclassified from a nonbusiness asset to a business asset. If the owner withdraws money 
or other assets from the business for personal use, the item withdrawn is reclassified 
from a business asset to a nonbusiness asset. These distinctions are important and 
allow the owner to make decisions based on the financial condition and results of the 
business apart from nonbusiness activities.
LO1 Define the accounting 
elements.
LEARNING KEY
Pay close attention to the defini-
tions for the basic accounting 
elements. A clear understanding 
of these definitions will help you 
analyze even the most complex 
business transactions.
LEARNING KEY
The business entity’s assets and 
liabilities are separate from the 
owner’s nonbusiness assets and 
liabilities.

the money came from to buy the assets.
When two elements are known, the third can always be calculated. For example, 
assume that assets on December 31 total $60,400. On that same day, the business 
liabilities consist of $5,400 owed for equipment. Owner’s equity is calculated by sub-
tracting total liabilities from total assets, $60,400 – $5,400 = $55,000.

THE ACCOUNTING EQUATION
The relationship between the three basic accounting elements—assets, liabilities, and 
owner’s equity—can be expressed in the form of a simple equation known as the 
accounting equation.

accounting equation.
A BROADER VIEW
Assets and the Cost 
of Products We Buy
Next time you buy something, think of all the assets a compa-
ny needs to produce that product. If the product comes from a 
capital-intensive industry, one that requires heavy investments 
in assets, the company must price the product high enough 
to cover the cost of using the assets and replacing them when 
they wear out. For example, Procter & Gamble recently report-
ed that the cost of property, plant, and equipment used for 
operating purposes came to over $38 billion.

ANALYZING BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS
A business transaction is an economic event that has a direct impact on the business. 
A business transaction almost always requires an exchange between the business and 
another outside entity. We must be able to measure this exchange in dollars. Examples 
of business transactions include buying goods and services, selling goods and services, 
buying and selling assets, making loans, and borrowing money.
All business transactions affect the accounting equation through specific accounts. 
An account is a separate record used to summarize changes in each asset, liability, and 
owner’s equity of a business. Account titles provide a description of the particular type 
of asset, liability, or owner’s equity affected by a transaction.
Three basic questions must be answered when analyzing the effects of a business 
transaction on the accounting equation. These questions help address the steps in the 
accounting process discussed in Chapter 1.
1. What happened?
Make certain you understand the event that has taken place.
• 
2. Which accounts are affected?
Identify the accounts that are affected.
• 
Classify these accounts as assets, liabilities, or owner’s equity.
• 
3. How is the accounting equation affected?
Determine which accounts have increased or decreased.
• 
Make certain that the accounting equation remains in balance after the trans-
• 
action has been entered.

transactions.

EFFECT OF TRANSACTIONS ON THE 
ACCOUNTING EQUATION
In Chapters 2 through 6, we will focus on learning how to account for a business 
similar to Rob’s Bike Courier Service, discussed in the chapter opener. In these chap-
ters, we will focus on Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service. By studying Jessie’s busi-
ness transactions and accounting techniques, you will learn about business and 
accounting. A major advantage of studying accounting is that it helps you learn a great 
deal about business.
As explained above, we must first understand the economic substance of events. 
Then, we must determine how that information is entered into the accounting system.  
If Jessie does not understand the economic events affecting her delivery business and 
their impact on the accounting equation, the events will not be correctly entered into 
the accounting system.
Each transaction affects at least two accounts and one or more of the three basic 
accounting elements. A transaction increases or decreases specific asset, liability, or 
owner’s equity accounts. Assume that the following transactions occurred during June 
20--, the first month of operations for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service.
Transaction (a): Investment by owner
An Increase in an Asset Offset by an Increase in Owner’s Equity. Jessica Jane opened 
a bank account with a deposit of $2,000 for her business. The new business now has 
$2,000 of the asset Cash. Since Jessie contributed the asset, the owner’s equity element, 
Jessica Jane, Capital, increases by the same amount.
LO4 Show the effects of 
business transactions 
on the accounting 
equation.
Remember, capital does 
not mean cash. The cash 
is shown in the cash 
account.
LEARNING KEY
If transactions are entered cor-
rectly, the accounting equation 
always remains in balance.
Transaction (b): Purchase of an asset for cash
An Increase in an Asset Offset by a Decrease in Another Asset. Jessie decided that the 
fastest and easiest way to get around campus and find parking is on a motor scooter. 
Thus, she bought a motor scooter (delivery equipment) for $1,200 cash. Jessie 
exchanged one asset, cash, for another, delivery equipment. This transaction reduces 
Cash and creates a new asset, Delivery Equipment.

Transaction (c): Purchase of an asset on account
An Increase in an Asset Offset by an Increase in a Liability. Jessie hired a friend to 
work for her, which meant that a second scooter would be needed. Given Jessie’s lim-
ited cash, she bought the dealer’s demonstration model for $900. The seller agreed to 
allow Jessie to spread the payments over the next three months. This transaction 
increased an asset, Delivery Equipment, by $900 and increased the liability, Accounts 
Payable, by an equal amount.
Transaction (d): Payment on a loan
A Decrease in an Asset Offset by a Decrease in a Liability. Jessie paid the first install-
ment on the scooter of $300 [see transaction (c)]. This payment decreased the asset, 
Cash, and the liability, Accounts Payable, by $300.

EXPANDING THE ACCOUNTING 
EQUATION: REVENUES, EXPENSES, 
AND WITHDRAWALS
In the preceding sections, three key accounting elements of every business entity were 
defined and explained: assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity. To complete the explana-
tion of the accounting process, three additional elements must be added to the discus-
sion: revenues, expenses, and withdrawals.
Revenues
Revenues represent the amount a business charges customers for products sold or 
services performed. Customers generally pay with cash or a credit card, or they 
promise to pay at a later date. Most businesses recognize revenues when earned, 
even if cash has not yet been received. Separate accounts are used to recognize dif-
ferent types of revenue. Examples include Delivery Fees; Consulting Fees; Rent 
Revenue, if the business rents space to others; Interest Revenue, for interest earned

Chapter 2          Analyzing Transactions: The Accounting Equation

on bank deposits; and Sales, for sales of merchandise. Revenues increase both assets 
and owner’s equity.
Expenses
Expenses represent the decrease in assets (or increase in liabilities) as a result of a 
company’s efforts to produce revenues. Common examples of expenses are rent, 
salaries, supplies consumed, and taxes. As with revenues, separate accounts are used 
to keep the accounting records for each different type of expense. Expenses are 
“incurred” as
assets are consumed (such as supplies), or 
• 
services are provided (by employees, for example) to the business.
• 
The two main purposes of recognizing an expense are (a) to keep track of the 
amount and types of expenses incurred and (b) to show the reduction in owner’s 
equity. Again, an expense can cause a reduction in assets or an increase in liabilities. 
Wages earned by employees is a good example. 
If paid, the expense reduces owner’s equity and an asset, Cash. 
• 
If not paid, the expense reduces owner’s equity and increases a liability, Wages 
• 
Payable.
Either way, owner’s equity is reduced.  If total revenues are greater than total 
expenses for the period, the excess is the net income, or net profit, for the period. On 
the other hand, if total expenses are greater than  total revenues for the period, the 
excess is a net loss for the period.

$900 
Revenues 
$ 300
Expenses

Expenses

Net income 
$400 
Net loss 
$(200)
The owner can determine the time period used in the measurement of net income 
or net loss. It may be a month, a quarter (three months), a year, or some other time 
period. The concept that income determination can be made on a periodic basis is 
known as the accounting period concept. Any accounting period of 12 months is 
called a fiscal year. The fiscal year frequently coincides with the calendar year.
Withdrawals
Withdrawals, or drawing, reduce owner’s equity as a result of the owner taking cash 
or other assets out of the business for personal use. Since earnings are expected to 
offset withdrawals, this reduction is viewed as temporary.
The accounting equation is expanded to include revenues, expenses, and with-
drawals. Note that revenues increase owner’s equity, while expenses and drawing 
reduce owner’s equity.
LEARNING KEY
It is important to remember that 
expenses do not always reduce 
cash and revenues do not always 
increase cash right away.

EFFECT OF REVENUE, EXPENSE, AND 
WITHDRAWAL TRANSACTIONS ON 
THE ACCOUNTING EQUATION
To show the effects of revenue, expense, and withdrawal transactions, the example of 
Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service will be continued. Assume that the following 
transactions took place in Jessie’s business during June 20--.
Transaction (e): Delivery revenues earned in cash
An Increase in an Asset Offset by an Increase in Owner’s Equity Resulting from 
Revenue. Jessie received $500 cash from clients for delivery services. This transac-
tion increased the asset, Cash, and increased owner’s equity by $500. The increase 
in owner’s equity is shown by increasing the revenue account, Delivery Fees, by 
$500.

A Decrease in an Asset Offset by a Decrease in Owner’s Equity Resulting from an 
Expense. Jessie rents a small office on campus. She paid $200 for office rent for June. 
This transaction decreased both Cash and owner’s equity by $200. The decrease in 
owner’s equity is shown by increasing an expense called Rent Expense by $200. An 
increase in an expense decreases owner’s equity.

Transaction (h): Delivery revenues earned 
on account
An Increase in an Asset Offset by an Increase in Owner’s Equity Resulting from 
Revenue. Jessie extends credit to regular customers. Often, delivery services are per-
formed for which payment will be received later. Since revenues are recognized when 
earned, an increase in owner’s equity must be reported by increasing the revenue 
account. Since no cash is received at this time, Cash cannot be increased. Instead, an 
increase is reported for another asset, Accounts Receivable. The total of Accounts 
Receivable at any point in time reflects the amount owed to Jessie by her customers. 
Deliveries made on account amounted to $600. Accounts Receivable and Delivery 
Fees are increased.

Revenue is recognized when it is 
earned even though cash is not 
received.

several months. Since they will generate future benefits, the supplies should be recorded 
as an asset. The accounting equation will show an increase in an asset, Supplies, and

Accounting for a Service Business
Transaction (j): Payment of insurance premium
An Increase in an Asset Offset by a Decrease in an Asset. Since Jessie plans to graduate 
and sell the business next January, she paid $200 for an eight-month liability insurance 
policy. Insurance is paid in advance and will provide future benefits. Thus, it is treated 
as an asset. We must expand the equation to include another asset, Prepaid Insurance, 
and show that Cash has been reduced.
LEARNING KEY
Both supplies and insurance are 
recorded as assets because they 
will provide benefits for several 
months.

With business increasing, Jessie hired a second employee and bought a third motor 
scooter. The scooter cost $1,500. Jessie paid $300 in cash and will spread the remain-
ing payments over the next four months. The asset Delivery Equipment increases by 
$1,500, Cash decreases by $300, and the liability Accounts Payable increases by 
$1,200. Note that this transaction changes three accounts. Even so, the accounting 
equation remains in balance.

Transaction (k): Cash receipts from prior

An Increase in an Asset Offset by a Decrease in an Asset. Jessie received $570 in cash 
for delivery services performed for customers earlier in the month [see transaction (h)]. 
Receipt of this cash increases the cash account and reduces the amount due from cus-
tomers reported in the accounts receivable account. Notice that owner’s equity is not 
affected in this transaction. Owner’s equity increased in transaction (h) when revenue 
was recognized as it was earned, rather than now when cash is received.
As shown in transactions 
(i), (j), and (k), transactions 
do not always affect both 
sides of the accounting 
equation.

Transaction (m): Payment of wages
A Decrease in an Asset Offset by a Decrease in Owner’s Equity Resulting from an 
Expense. Jessie paid her part-time employees $650 in wages. This represents an addi-
tional business expense. As with other expenses, Cash is reduced and owner’s equity 
is reduced by increasing an expense.

Transaction (n): Deliveries made for cash 
and on account
An Increase in Two Assets Offset by an Increase in Owner’s Equity. Total delivery fees 
for the remainder of the month amounted to $1,050: $430 in cash and $620 on 
account. Since all of these delivery fees have been earned, the revenue account increases 
by $1,050. Also, Cash increases by $430 and Accounts Receivable increases by $620. 
Thus, revenues increase assets and owner’s equity. Note, once again, that one event 
impacts three accounts while the equation remains in balance.

Figure 2-1 shows a summary of the transactions. Use this summary to test your 
understanding of transaction analysis by describing the economic event represented by 
each transaction. At the bottom of Figure 2-1, the asset accounts and their totals are 
compared with the liability and owner’s equity accounts and their totals.
Transaction (o): Withdrawal of cash from business
A Decrease in an Asset Offset by a Decrease in Owner’s Equity Resulting from a 
Withdrawal by the Owner. At the end of the month, Jessie took $150 in cash from the 
business to purchase books for her classes. Since the books are not business related, 
this is a withdrawal. Withdrawals can be viewed as the opposite of investments by the 
owner. Both owner’s equity and Cash decrease.
LEARNING KEY
Withdrawals by the owner are 
reported in the drawing account. 
Withdrawals are the opposite of 
investments by the owner.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Three financial statements commonly prepared by a business entity are the income 
statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. The transaction information 
gathered and summarized in the accounting equation may be used to prepare these 
financial statements. Figure 2-2 shows the following:
1.  A summary of the specific revenue and expense transactions and the ending 
totals for the asset, liability, capital, and drawing accounts from the accounting 
equation.
2.  The financial statements and their linkages with the accounting equation and 
each other.
Note that each of the financial statements in Figure 2-2 has a heading 
 consisting of:

THE INCOME STATEMENT
The income statement, sometimes called the profit and loss statement or operating 
statement, reports the profitability of business operations for a specific period of time. 
Jessie’s income statement shows the revenues earned for the month of June. Next, the 
expenses incurred as a result of the efforts made to earn these revenues are deducted. 
If the revenues are greater than the expenses, net income is reported. If the expenses 
are greater than the revenue, a net loss is reported.
By carefully studying the income statement, it is clear that Jessie earns revenues 
in only one way: by making deliveries. If other types of services were offered, these 
revenues would also be identified on the statement. Further, the reader can see the 
kinds of expenses that were incurred. The reader can make a judgment as to whether 
these seem reasonable given the amount of revenue earned. Finally, the most impor-
tant number on the statement is the net income. This is known as the “bottom 
line.”
THE STATEMENT OF OWNER’S EQUITY
The statement of owner’s equity illustrated in Figure 2-2 reports on these activities for 
the month of June. Jessie started her business with an investment of $2,000. During 
the month of June, she earned $1,250 in net income and withdrew $150 for personal 
expenses. Jessie’s $2,000 original investment, plus the net increase of $1,100, results 
in her ending capital of $3,100.
Note that Jessie’s original investment and later withdrawal are taken from the 
accounting equation. The net income figure could have been computed from infor-
mation in the accounting equation. However, it is easier to simply transfer net 
income as reported on the income statement to the statement of owner’s equity. 
This is an important linkage between the income statement and statement of 
 owner’s equity.
If Jessie had a net loss of $500 for the month, the statement of owner’s equity 
would be prepared as shown in Figure 2-3.

OVERVIEW OF THE ACCOUNTING PROCESS
Figure 2-4 shows the three basic phases of the accounting process in terms of input, 
processing, and output.
Input.
• 
 Business transactions provide the necessary input.
Processing.
• 
 Recognizing the effect of these transactions on the assets, liabilities, 
owner’s equity, revenues, and expenses of a business is the processing function.
Output.
• 
 The financial statements are the output.
LO6 Define the three 
basic phases of the 
accounting process.
GUIDELINES FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.  Financial statements are prepared primarily for users not associated with the company. To make a good 
impression and enhance understanding, financial statements must follow a standard form with careful 
attention to placement, spacing, and indentations.
2.  All statements have a heading with the name of the company, name of the statement, and accounting 
 period or date.
3.  Single rules (lines) indicate that the numbers above the line have been added or subtracted. Double rules 
(double underlines) indicate a total.
4. Dollar signs are used at the top of columns and for the first amount entered in a column beneath a ruling.
5.  On the income statement, some companies list expenses from highest to lowest dollar amount, with 
 miscellaneous expense listed last.
6.  On the balance sheet, assets are listed from most liquid to least liquid. Liquidity measures the ease with 
which the asset will be converted to cash. Liabilities are listed from most current to least current.
Most firms also prepare a 
statement of cash flows. 
Given the complexity of 
this statement, we will 
postpone its discussion 
until later in this text.
THE BALANCE SHEET
The balance sheet reports a firm’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity on a specific 
date. It is called a balance sheet because it confirms that the accounting equation 
has remained in balance. It is also referred to as a statement of financial position or
statement of financial condition.
As illustrated in Figure 2-2, the asset and liability accounts are taken from the 
accounting equation and reported on the balance sheet. The total of Jessie’s capital 
account on June 30 could have been computed from the owner’s equity accounts 
in the accounting equation ($2,000 – $150 + $2,150 – $900). However, it is simpler 
to take the June 30, 20--, capital as computed on the statement of owner’s equity 
and transfer it to the balance sheet. This is an important linkage between these two 
statements.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES Key Points to Remember
LO1  Define the accounting elements.
The three key accounting elements are assets, liabilities, and 
owner’s equity. Owner’s equity is expanded in L04 to include 
revenues, expenses, and drawing.
LO2  Construct the accounting 
equation.
The accounting equation is:
Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity
LO3  Analyze business transactions.
Three questions must be answered in analyzing business 
transactions:
 
1.  What happened?
 
2.  Which accounts are affected?
 
3.  How is the accounting equation affected?
LO4  Show the effects of business 
transactions on the accounting 
equation.
Each transaction affects at least two accounts and one or 
more of the three basic accounting elements. The transactions 
described in this chapter can be classified into five groups:
 
1.  Increase in an asset offset by an increase in owner’s equity.
 
2.  Increase in an asset offset by a decrease in another asset.
 
3.  Increase in an asset offset by an increase in a liability.
 
4.  Decrease in an asset offset by a decrease in a liability.
 
5.  Decrease in an asset offset by a decrease in owner’s equity.
LO5  Prepare and describe the 
purposes of a simple income 
statement, statement of owner’s 
equity, and balance sheet.
The purposes of the income statement, statement of owner’s 
equity, and balance sheet can be summarized as follows:

CHALLENGE PROBLEM
In this chapter, you learned about three important financial statements: the income 
statement, statement of owner’s equity, and balance sheet. As mentioned in the 
margin note on page 34, most firms also prepare a statement of cash flows. Part of 
this statement reports the cash received from customers and cash paid for goods and 
services.
REQUIRED
Take another look at the Demonstration Problem for Damon Young’s “Home and 
Away Inspections.” Note that when revenues are measured based on the amount 
earned, and expenses are measured based on the amount incurred, net income for 
the period was $4,165. Now, compute the difference between cash received from 
customers and cash paid to suppliers of goods and services by completing the form 
This problem challenges you 
to apply your cumulative 
accounting knowledge to 
move a step beyond the 
material in the chapter.
✓ Cash difference: $2,165

Chapter 3
The Double-Entry Framework
Tired of receiving spam e-mail messages? Or, are you worried 
about your computer picking up a virus? Businesses have the same 
concerns. Computer viruses can cause serious fi nancial damage to 
a business. In response to demand for e-mail security,  AppRiver 
was founded in April of 2002 to provide simple, yet powerful 
e-mail security solutions to businesses of any size. The company is 
based in Gulf Breeze, Florida, and maintains multiple data centers 
at secure locations in the United States and Europe. AppRiver’s 100 
employees protect more than 35,000 customers around the world 
from spam, viruses, and Internet pollution.
Just as e-mail security is important to you in your personal life 
and to businesses, the same can be said about accounting. A solid 
understanding of fi nancial accounting will help you manage your 
personal fi nances and help you understand business transactions 
in your professional life. In this chapter, you will learn about the 
double-entry framework used by businesses to enter transactions 
into an accounting system. You could use the same concepts for 
your personal transactions or for a business you might start. 
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter
should enable you to:
LO1  Define the parts of 
a T account.
LO2   Foot and balance a
T account.
LO3  Describe the effects of 
debits and credits on 
specific types of accounts.
LO4  Use T accounts to analyze 
transactions.
LO5  Prepare a trial balance and 
explain its purposes and 
linkages with the financial 
statements.

The terms asset, liability, owner’s equity, revenue, and expense were explained in Chapter 2. 
 Examples showed how individual business transactions change one or more of these basic 
accounting elements. Each transaction had a dual eff ect. An increase or decrease in any asset, 
liability, owner’s equity, revenue, or expense was always accompanied by an off setting change 
within the basic accounting elements. The fact that each transaction has a dual eff ect upon 
the accounting elements provides the basis for what is called double-entry accounting. To 
understand double-entry accounting, it is important to learn how T accounts work and the role of 
debits and credits in accounting.
THE T ACCOUNT
The assets of a business may consist of a number of items, such as cash, accounts 
receivable, equipment, buildings, and land. The liabilities may consist of one or more 
items, such as accounts payable and notes payable. Similarly, owner’s equity may con-
sist of the owner’s investments and various revenue and expense items. A separate 
account is used to record the increases and decreases in each type of asset, liability, 
owner’s equity, revenue, and expense.
The T account gets its name from the fact that it resembles the letter T. The three 
major parts of an account are as follows:
1. the title,
2. the debit, or left side, and
3. the credit, or right side.
The debit side is always on the left, and the credit side is always on the right. This 
is true for all types of asset, liability, owner’s equity, revenue, and expense accounts.
BALANCING A T ACCOUNT
To determine the balance of a T account at any time, simply total the dollar amounts 
on the debit and credit sides. These totals are known as footings. The difference 
between the footings is called the balance of the account. This amount is then written 
on the side with the larger footing.
In Chapter 2, the accounting equation was used to analyze business transactions. 
This required columns in which to record the increases and decreases in various 
accounts. Let’s compare this approach with the use of a T account for the transactions 
affecting cash. When a T account is used, increases in cash are recorded on the debit 
side and decreases are recorded on the credit side. Transactions for Jessie Jane’s 
Campus Delivery Service are shown in Figure 3-1.

DEBITS AND CREDITS
To debit an account means to enter an amount on the left or debit side of the account. 
To credit an account means to enter an amount on the right or credit side of the 
account. Debits may increase or decrease the balances of specific accounts. This is also 
true for credits. To learn how to use debits and credits, it is best to focus on the 
accounting equation.

LIABILITIES AND OWNER’S EQUITY
Liabilities and owner’s equity are on the right side of the equation. Therefore, increases 
are entered on the right (credit) side, and decreases are entered on the left (debit) side.
THE OWNER’S EQUITY UMBRELLA
Owner’s equity includes four types of accounts: Owner’s Capital, Revenues, Expenses, 
and Drawing. Expanding the accounting equation helps illustrate the use of debits and 
credits. Since these accounts affect owner’s equity, they are shown under the “umbrella” 
of owner’s equity in the accounting equation in Figure 3-2.

FIGURE 3-2 The Accounting Equation and the Owner’s Equity Umbrella
OWNER’S CAPITAL
The owner’s capital account, Jessica Jane, Capital, in Figure 3-2 reports the amount 
the owner has invested in the business. These investments increase the owner’s equity 
and are credited to the owner’s capital account.
DRAWING
Withdrawals of cash and other assets by the owner for personal reasons decrease 
owner’s equity. Withdrawals could be debited directly to the owner’s capital account. 
However, readers of financial statements want to know the amount of withdrawals for 
the accounting period. Thus, as shown in Figure 3-2, withdrawals are debited to a 
separate account, Drawing.
REVENUES
Revenues increase owner’s equity. Revenues could be recorded directly on the credit 
side of the owner’s capital account. However, readers of financial statements are inter-
ested in the specific types of revenues earned. Therefore, specific revenue accounts, like 
Delivery Fees, Sales, and Service Fees, are used. These specific accounts are credited 
when revenue is earned.
EXPENSES
Expenses decrease owner’s equity. Expenses could be recorded on the debit side of the 
owner’s capital account. However, readers of financial statements want to see the types 
LEARNING KEY
You could credit the owner’s capi-
tal account for revenues and debit 
the capital account for expenses 
and withdrawals. However, this is 
not a good idea. Using specific 
accounts provides additional infor-
mation. Remember: An increase 
in an expense decreases owner’s 
equity.

of expenses incurred during the accounting period. Thus, specific expense accounts are 
maintained for items like rent, wages, advertising, and utilities. These specific accounts 
are debited as expenses are incurred.
NORMAL BALANCES
A normal balance is the side of an account that is used to increase the account. Thus, 
the normal balances for the accounts illustrated in Figure 3-2 are shown with a “+” 
sign. Since assets are debited for increases, these accounts normally have debit 
 balances. Liability and owner’s capital accounts are credited for increases; thus, 
these accounts normally have credit balances. Since expense and drawing accounts 
are debited for increases (reducing owner’s equity), these accounts normally have 
debit balances. Finally, revenue accounts are credited for increases (increasing 
owner’s equity); thus, these accounts normally have credit balances. A summary of 
normal balances is provided in Figure 3-3.

TRANSACTION ANALYSIS
In Chapter 2, you learned how to analyze transactions by using the accounting equa-
tion. Here, we continue to use the accounting equation, but add debits and credits by 
using T accounts. As shown in Figure 3-4, the three basic questions that must be 
answered when analyzing a transaction are essentially the same but are expanded 
slightly to address the use of the owner’s equity umbrella and T accounts. You must 
determine the location of the account within the accounting equation and/or the 
owner’s equity umbrella. You must also determine whether the accounts should be 
debited or credited.
LO4 Use T accounts to 
analyze transactions.
LEARNING KEY
If you have a debit, you must 
always have at least one credit. 
If you have a credit, you must 
always have at least one debit.

DEBITS AND CREDITS: ASSET, LIABILITY, 
AND OWNER’S EQUITY ACCOUNTS
Transactions (a) through (d) from Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service (Chapter 2) 
demonstrate the double-entry process for transactions affecting asset, liability, and 
owner’s equity accounts.
As you study each transaction, answer the three questions: (1) What happened? 
(2) Which accounts are affected? and (3) How is the accounting equation affected? 
The transaction statement tells you what happened. The analysis tells which accounts 
are affected. The illustration shows you how the accounting equation is affected.
Transaction (a): Investment by owner
Jessica Jane opened a bank account with a deposit of $2,000 for her business 
(Figure 3-5).
Analysis. As a result of this transaction, the business acquired an asset, Cash. In 
exchange for the asset, the business gave Jessica Jane owner’s equity. The owner’s 
equity account is called Jessica Jane, Capital. The transaction is entered as an increase 
in an asset and an increase in owner’s equity. Debit Cash and credit Jessica Jane, 
 Capital for $2,000.
1. What happened?
 
Be sure you understand the event that has taken place.
2.  Which accounts are affected?
 
Once you understand what happened, you must:
 
• Identify the accounts that are affected.
 
• Classify these accounts as assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, revenues, or expenses.
 
•  Identify the location of the accounts in the accounting equation and/or the owner’s equity 
umbrella—left or right.
3. How is the accounting equation affected?
 
• Determine whether the accounts have increased or decreased.
 
• Determine whether the accounts should be debited or credited.
 
•  Make certain the accounting equation remains in balance after the transaction has been 
entered.
 
 
(1) Assets = Liabilities + Owner’s Equity.
 
 
(2) Debits = Credits for every transaction.

Transaction (b): Purchase of an asset for cash
Jessie bought a motor scooter (delivery equipment) for $1,200 cash (Figure 3-6).
Analysis. Jessie exchanged one asset, Cash, for another, Delivery Equipment. Debit
 Delivery Equipment and credit Cash for $1,200. Notice that the total assets are still 
$2,000 as they were following transaction (a). Transaction (b) shifted assets from cash 
to delivery equipment, but total assets remained the same.
TransacƟ on (c): Purchase of an asset on account
Jessie bought a second motor scooter on account for $900 (Figure 3-7). Recall from 
chapter 2 that “on account” means Jessie will pay for the asset later.
Analysis. The asset, Delivery Equipment, increases by $900 and the liability, Accounts 
Payable, increases by the same amount. Thus, debit Delivery Equipment and credit
Accounts Payable for $900.

Notice that for transactions (a) through (d), the debits equal credits and the 
accounting equation is in balance. Review transactions (a) through (d). Again, identify 
the accounts that were affected and how they were classified (assets, liabilities, or 
owner’s equity). Finally, note each account’s location within the accounting equation.
DEBITS AND CREDITS: INCLUDING 
REVENUES, EXPENSES, AND DRAWING
Transactions (a) through (d) involved only assets, liabilities, and the owner’s capital 
account. To complete the illustration of Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service, the 
equation is expanded to include revenues, expenses, and drawing. Remember, revenues 
increase owner’s equity and are shown under the credit side of the capital account. 
Expenses and drawing decrease owner’s equity and are shown under the debit side of 
the capital account. The expanded equation is shown in Figure 3-9.

Credits 
increase 
the 
capital 
account. Revenues increase capi-
tal. Thus, revenues are shown 
under the credit side of the capital 
account. Debits decrease the capi-

reduce owner’s equity. Thus, they 
are shown under the debit side of 
the capital account.
Transaction (e): Delivery revenues earned in cash
Jessie made deliveries and received $500 cash from clients (Figure 3-10).

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Transaction (f): Paid rent for month
Jessie paid $200 for office rent for June (Figure 3-11).
Analysis. Rent Expense increases and Cash decreases. Debit Rent Expense and credit
 Cash for $200.
A debit to an expense account increases that expense and decreases owner’s equity. 
Notice that the placement of the plus and minus signs for expenses is opposite the 
placement of the signs for owner’s equity. Note also that expenses are located on the 
left (debit) side of the owner’s equity umbrella.
Transaction (g): Paid telephone bill
Jessie paid for telephone service, $50 (Figure 3-12).
Analysis. This transaction, like the previous one, increases an expense and decreases 
an asset. Debit  Telephone Expense and credit Cash for $50.

Transaction (h): Delivery revenues earned 
on account
Jessie made deliveries on account for $600 (Figure 3-13).
Analysis. As discussed in Chapter 2, delivery services are performed for which pay-
ment will be received later. This is called offering services “on account” or “on credit.” 
Instead of receiving cash, Jessie receives a promise that her customers will pay cash in 
the future. Therefore, the asset, Accounts Receivable, increases. Since revenues are 
recognized when earned, the revenue account, Delivery Fees, also increases. Debit 
 Accounts Receivable and credit Delivery Fees for $600.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Review transactions (e) through (h). Note the following:
Expense and revenue transactions do not always affect cash.
• 
The debits equal credits, and the accounting equation is in balance after each 
• 
transaction.
Upcoming transactions (i) and (j) both involve an exchange of cash for another 
asset. As you analyze these two transactions, you may wonder why prepaid insurance 
and supplies are assets while the rent and telephone bill in transactions (f) and (g) are 
expenses. Prepaid insurance and supplies are assets because they will provide benefits 
for more than one month. Jessie pays her rent and her telephone bill each month so 
they are classified as expenses. If Jessie paid her rent only once every three months, she 
would need to set up an asset account called Prepaid Rent. She would debit this 
account when she paid the rent.
Transaction (i): Purchase of supplies
Jessie bought pens, paper, delivery envelopes, and other supplies for $80 cash 
(Figure 3-14).
Analysis. These supplies will last for several months. Since they will generate future 
benefits, the supplies should be recorded as an asset. An asset, Supplies, increases, and 
an asset, Cash, decreases. Debit Supplies and credit Cash for $80.

A BROADER VIEW
Supplies—Asset or Expense?
When businesses buy office supplies from Staples or other 
suppliers, the supplies are initially recorded as assets. This 
is done because the supplies will provide future benefits. 
Those still remaining in inventory at the end of the accounting 
period are reported on the balance sheet as assets. Supplies 
actually used during the period are recognized as an expense 
on the income statement. We will discuss how to account for 
the expense in Chapter 5.

Transaction (j): Payment of insurance premium
Jessie paid $200 for an eight-month liability insurance policy (Figure 3-15).
Analysis. Since insurance is paid in advance and will provide future benefits, it is 
treated as an asset. Therefore, one asset, Prepaid Insurance, increases and another, 
Cash, decreases. Debit Prepaid Insurance and credit Cash for $200.

FIGURE 3-16 Transaction (k): Cash Receipts from Prior Sales on Account
Transaction (k): Cash receipts from prior sales on account
Jessie received $570 in cash for delivery services performed for customers earlier in the 
month [see transaction (h)] (Figure 3-16).
Analysis. This transaction increases Cash and reduces the amount due from customers 
reported in Accounts Receivable. Debit Cash and credit Accounts Receivable $570.
As you analyze transaction (k), notice which accounts are affected and the loca-
tion of these accounts in the accounting equation. Jessie received cash, but this 
transaction did not affect revenue. The revenue was recorded in transaction (h). 
Transaction (k) is an exchange of one asset (Accounts Receivable) for another asset 
(Cash).
As you analyze transactions (l) through (o), make certain that you understand 
what has happened in each transaction. Identify the accounts that are affected and the 
locations of these accounts within the accounting equation. Notice that the accounting 
equation remains in balance after every transaction and debits equal credits for each 
transaction.

Transaction (l): Purchase of an asset on credit 
making a partial payment
Jessie bought a third motor scooter for $1,500. Jessie made a down payment of $300 
and spread the remaining payments over the next four months (Figure 3-17).
Analysis. The asset, Delivery Equipment, increases by $1,500, Cash decreases by 
$300, and the liability, Accounts Payable, increases by $1,200. Thus, debit Delivery 
 Equipment for $1,500, credit Cash for $300, and credit Accounts Payable for $1,200. 
This transaction requires one debit and two credits. Even so, total debits ($1,500) 
equal the total credits ($1,200 + $300) and the accounting equation remains in 
 balance.

Proﬁ les in 
Accounting
Maria Giorgio graduated with an associ-
ate degree in accounting with honors 
from The College of Westchester.  After 
working as an intern at Rosenberg, 
Chesnov & Co., LLP, she became the 
assistant manager of the company’s New 
York Office on 5th Ave.   Maria has found 
that working in a CPA firm exposes her 
to every aspect of accounting from tax 
to audit. Because she enjoys account-
ing so much, she is in the process of 
furthering her education.   In addition, 
she thrives on the interpersonal daily 
experiences at the office and has found 
that you can be a people person and an 
aspiring CPA too.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Transaction (n): Deliveries made for cash 
and credit
Total delivery fees for the remainder of the month amounted to $1,050: $430 in cash 
and $620 on account (Figure 3-19 on the next page).
Analysis. Since the delivery fees have been earned, the revenue account increases by 
$1,050. Also, Cash increases by $430 and Accounts Receivable increases by $620. 
Note once again that one event impacts three accounts. This time we have debits of 
$430 to Cash and $620 to Accounts Receivable, and a credit of $1,050 to Delivery  
 Fees. As before, the total debits ($430 + $620) equal the total credits ($1,050) and the 
accounting equation remains in balance.
Transaction (o): Withdrawal of cash from business
At the end of the month, Jessie withdrew $150 in cash from the business to purchase 
books for her classes (Figure 3-20 on the next page).
Analysis. Cash withdrawals decrease owner’s equity and decrease cash. Debit Jessica 
Jane, Drawing and credit Cash for $150.
Withdrawals are reported in the drawing account. Withdrawals by an owner are 
the opposite of an investment. You could debit the owner’s capital account for with-
drawals. However, using a specific account tells the user of the accounting information 
how much was withdrawn for the period.

Accounting for a Service Business
SUMMARY OF TRANSACTIONS
In illustrating transactions (a) through (o), each T account for Jessie Jane’s Campus 
Delivery Service shows a balance before and after each transaction. To focus your atten-
tion on the transaction being explained, only a single entry was shown. In practice, this 
is not done. Instead, each account gathers all transactions for a period. Jessie’s accounts, 
with all transactions listed, are shown in Figure 3-21. Note the following four items:
1.  The footings are directly under the debit (left) and credit (right) sides of the 
T account for those accounts with more than one debit or credit.
2. The balance is shown on the side with the larger footing.
3.  The footing serves as the balance for accounts with entries on only one side of 
the account.
4.  If an account has only a single entry, it is not necessary to enter a footing or 
 balance.

THE TRIAL BALANCE
Recall the following two very important rules in double-entry accounting:
1.  The sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits. 
At least two accounts are affected by each transaction. This rule is so important 
that many computer accounting programs will not permit a transaction to be 
entered into the accounting system unless the debits equal the credits.
2. The accounting equation must remain in balance.
In illustrating the transactions for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service, the equal-
ity of the accounting equation was verified after each transaction. Because of the large 
number of transactions entered each day, this is not done in practice. Instead, a trial 
balance is prepared periodically to determine the equality of the debits and credits. 
A trial balance is a list of all accounts showing the title and balance of each account. 
By totaling the debits and credits, their equality can be tested.
A trial balance of Jessie’s accounts, taken on June 30, 20--, is shown in  Figure 3-22. 
This date is shown on the third line of the heading. The trial balance shows that the 
debit and credit totals are equal in amount. This is proof that (1) in entering  transactions 
(a) through (o), the total of the debits was equal to the total of the credits, and (2) the 
accounting equation has remained in balance.
A trial balance is not a formal statement or report. Normally, only the accountant 
sees it. As shown in Figure 3-23, a trial balance can be used as an aid in preparing the 
financial statements.

and explain its 
purposes and linkages

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Key Points to Remember
LO1 Define the parts of a T account.
The parts of a T account are:
 
1. the title,
 
2. the debit or left side, and
 
3. the credit or right side.
LO2  Foot and balance a T account.
Rules for footing and balancing T accounts are:
 
1.  The footings are directly under the debit (left) and credit 
(right) sides of the T account for those accounts with more 
than one debit or credit.
 
2. The balance is shown on the side with the larger footing.
 
3.  The footing serves as the balance for accounts with entries 
on only one side of the account.
 
4.  If an account has only a single entry, it is not necessary to 
enter a footing or balance.
LO3  Describe the effects of debits 
and credits on specific types of 
accounts.
Rules for debits and credits. (See illustration below.)
 
1.  Assets are on the left side of the accounting equation. There
fore, increases are entered on the left (debit) side of an asset 
account and decreases are entered on the right (credit) side.
 
2.  Liabilities and owner’s equity are on the right side of the 
accounting equation. Therefore, increases are entered on the 
right (credit) side and decreases are entered on the left (debit) 
side.
 
3.  Revenues increase owner’s equity. Therefore, increases are 
entered on the right (credit) side and decreases are entered 
on the left (debit) side.
 
4.  Expenses and drawing decrease owner’s equity. Therefore, 
increases are entered on the left (debit) side and decreases 
are entered on the right (credit) side.

LO4  Use T accounts to analyze 
transactions.
Picture the accounting equation in your mind as you analyze 
transactions. When entering transactions in T accounts:
 
1. The sum of the debits must equal the sum of the credits.
 
2. At least two accounts are affected by each transaction.
 
3.  When finished, the accounting equation must remain in 
balance.
LO5  Prepare a trial balance and explain 
its purposes and linkages with the 
financial statements.
A trial balance shows that the debit and credit totals are equal. A 
trial  balance also can be used in preparing the financial statements.

CHALLENGE PROBLEM
 
Your friend Chris Stevick started a part-time business in June and has been keeping her 
own accounting records. She has been preparing monthly financial statements. At the 
end of August, she stopped by to show you her performance for the most recent month. 
She prepared the following income statement and balance sheet:
 
 
Balance  
End of 
Beginning
Income Statement 
Sheet 
Month

Revenues 
$500 
Cash 
$600 
$400
 
Expenses 
 200 
Capital 
600 
400
 
Net income 
$300
 
 Chris has also heard that there is a statement of owner’s equity, but she is not famil-
iar with that statement. She asks if you can help her prepare one. After confirming that 
she has no assets other than cash, no liabilities, and made no additional investments in 
the business in August, you agree.
REQUIRED
1. Prepare the statement of owner’s equity for your friend’s most recent month.
2. What suggestions might you give to Chris that would make her income statement 
more useful?
This problem challenges you to 
apply your cumulative accounting 
knowledge to move a step beyond 
the material in the chapter.

Journalizing and Posting 
 Transactions
Campus Advantage (CA) provides a comprehensive range of 
 student residential services in the following areas: management, 
development, acquisition, and consulting. It specializes in the 
 creation of modern, full-service facilities that are secure, private, 
and equipped with all of the tools that today’s students need for 
success. Its  communities are no-hassle alternatives to dorm living 
with full dining service options. CA has facilities across the country, 
but each student residence refl ects the unique identity of the school 
and community it serves.
As with all businesses, CA relies on an accounting system to 
maintain a record of transactions from the source document 
through the preparation of the trial balance and fi nancial state-
ments. In this chapter, we discuss source documents, the chart of 
accounts, and the process used to journalize and post transactions. 
And, just in case an error is made, we address how to fi nd and 
 correct errors.

The double-entry framework of accounting was explained and illustrated in Chapter 3. To 
 demonstrate the use of debits and credits, business transactions were entered directly into T 
 accounts. Now we will take a more detailed look at the procedures used to account for business 
transactions.
FLOW OF DATA
This chapter traces the flow of financial data from the source documents through the 
accounting information system. This process includes the following steps:
1.  Analyze what happened by using information from source documents and the 
firm’s chart of accounts.
2. Enter business transactions in the general journal in the form of journal entries.
3. Post these journal entries to the accounts in the general ledger.
4. Prepare a trial balance.
The flow of data from the source documents through the preparation of a trial 
balance is shown in Figure 4-1.
LO1 Describe the flow 
of data from source 
documents through 
the trial balance.

THE CHART OF ACCOUNTS
You learned in Chapters 2 and 3 that there are three basic questions that must be 
answered when analyzing transactions.
1. What happened?
2. Which accounts are affected?
3. How is the accounting equation affected?
To determine which accounts are affected (step 2), the accountant must know the 
accounts being used by the business. A list of all accounts used by a business is called 
a chart of accounts.
The chart of accounts includes the account titles in numeric order for all assets, 
liabilities, owner’s equity, revenues, and expenses. The numbering should follow a 
consistent pattern. In Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service, asset accounts begin with 
“1,” liability accounts begin with “2,” owner’s equity accounts begin with “3,” revenue

SOURCE DOCUMENTS
Almost any document that provides information about a business transaction can 
be called a source document. A source document triggers the analysis of what hap-
pened. It begins the process of entering transactions in the accounting system. 
Examples of source documents are shown in Figure 4-3. These source documents 
provide information that is useful in determining the effect of business transactions on 
specific accounts.
In addition to serving as input for transaction analysis, source documents serve as 
objective evidence of business transactions. If anyone questions the accounting records, 
these documents may be used as objective, verifiable evidence of the accuracy of the 
accounting records. For this reason, source documents are filed for possible future 
reference. Having objective, verifiable evidence that a transaction occurred is an 
important accounting concept.
LO3 Describe and explain 
the purpose of source 
documents.
accounts begin with “4,” and expense accounts begin with “5.” Jessie uses three-digit 
numbers for all accounts.
A chart of accounts for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service is shown in Figure 
4-2. Jessie would not need many accounts initially because the business is new. 
Additional accounts can easily be added as needed. Note that the accounts are 
arranged according to the accounting equation.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
THE GENERAL JOURNAL
A day-by-day listing of the transactions of a business is called a journal. The purpose 
of a journal is to provide a record of all transactions completed by the business. The 
journal shows the date of each transaction, titles of the accounts to be debited and 
credited, and the amounts of the debits and credits.
A journal is commonly referred to as a book of original entry because it is here that 
the first formal accounting record of a transaction is made. Although many types of 
journals are used in business, the simplest journal form is a two-column general journal 
(Figure 4-4). Any kind of business transaction may be entered into a general journal.
A two-column general journal is so-named because it has only two amount col-
umns, one for debit amounts and one for credit amounts. Journal pages are numbered 
in the upper right-hand corner. The five column numbers in Figure 4-4 are explained 
in Figure 4-5.

Date
The year is entered in small figures at the top of the column immediately below the column heading. The year is repeated
only at the top of each new page. The month is entered for the first entry on the page and for the first transaction of the month.
The day of the month is recorded for every transaction, even if it is the same as the prior entry.  
Column
Description
The Description or Explanation column is used to enter the titles of the accounts affected by each transaction and to provide
a very brief description of the transaction. Each transaction affects two or more accounts. The account(s) to be debited are 
entered first at the extreme left of the column. The account(s) to be credited are listed after the debits and indented. 
The description should be entered immediately following the last credit entry with an additional indentation.
Column
Posting Reference
No entries are made in the Posting Reference column during journalizing. Entries are made in this column when the debits
and credits are copied to the proper accounts in the ledger. This process will be explained in detail later in this chapter.
Column
Debit Amount
The Debit amount column is used to enter the amount to be debited to an account. The amount should be entered on the 
same line as the title of that account.
Column
Credit Amount 
The Credit amount column is used to enter the amount to be credited to an account. The amount should be entered on the
same line as the title of that account.

JOURNALIZING
Entering the transactions in a journal is called journalizing. For every transaction, the 
entry should include the date, the title of each account affected, the amounts, and a 
brief description.
To illustrate the journalizing process, transactions for the first month of operations 
of Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service will be journalized. The transactions are listed 
in Figure 4-6. Since you analyzed these transactions in Chapters 2 and 3, the journal-
izing process should be easier to understand. Let’s start with a close look at the steps 
followed when journalizing the first transaction, Jessie’s initial investment of $2,000.
LEARNING KEY
A journal provides a day-by-day 
listing of all transactions com-
pleted by the business.
LEARNING KEY
When journalizing, the exact 
account titles shown in the 
chart of accounts must be used. 
Refer to the chart of accounts 
in Figure 4-2 as you review the 
entries for Jessie Jane’s Campus 
Delivery Service.

The journal entries for the month of June are shown in Figure 4-7. Note that 
the entries on June 25 and June 30 affect more than two accounts. Entries requiring 
more than one debit and/or one credit are called compound entries. The entry on 
June 25 has two credits. The credits are listed after the debit, indented and listed 
one under the other. The entry on June 30 has two debits. They are aligned with the

The journal provides a day-by-day record of business transactions. To determine the 
current balance of specific accounts, however, the information in the journal must be

Chapter 4          Journalizing and Posting Transactions 
95
A complete set of all the accounts used by a business is known as the general 
ledger. The general ledger accumulates a complete record of the debits and credits 
made to each account as a result of entries made in the journal. The accounts are num-
bered and arranged in the same order as the chart of accounts. That is, accounts are 
numbered and grouped by classification: assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, revenues, 
and expenses.
GENERAL LEDGER ACCOUNT
For purposes of illustration, the T account was introduced in Chapter 3. In practice, 
businesses are more likely to use a version of the account called the general ledger 
account. Figure 4-8 compares the cash T account from Chapter 3 for Jessie Jane’s 
Campus Delivery Service and a general ledger account summarizing the same cash 
transactions.
A four-column general ledger account contains columns for the debit or credit 
transaction and columns for the debit or credit running balance. In addition, there are 
columns for the date, description of the item, and posting reference.
The Item column is used to provide descriptions of special entries. For example, 
“Balance” is written in this column when the balance of an account is transferred to 
a new page. In addition, “Correcting,” “Adjusting,” “Closing,” or “Reversing” may 
be written in this column when these types of entries are made. Correcting entries 
are described later in the chapter. Adjusting, closing, and reversing entries are illus-
trated in Chapters 5, 6, and 15, respectively.
The Posting Reference (Post. Ref.) column is used to indicate the journal page 
from which an entry was posted, or a check mark (✓) is inserted to indicate that no 
posting was required.
As shown in Figure 4-8, the primary advantage of the T account is that the debit 
and credit sides of the account are easier to identify. Thus, for demonstration purposes 
LEARNING KEY
While the journal provides a day-
by-day record of business trans-
actions, the ledger provides a 
record of the transactions entered 
in each account.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
and analyzing what happened, T accounts are very helpful. However, computing the 
balance of a T account is cumbersome. The primary advantage of the general ledger 
account is that it maintains a running balance.
Note that the heading for the general ledger account has the account title and an 
account number. The account number is taken from the chart of accounts and is used 
in the posting process.
POSTING TO THE GENERAL LEDGER
The process of copying the debits and credits from the journal to the ledger accounts 
is known as posting. All amounts entered in the journal must be posted to the general 
ledger accounts. Posting from the journal to the ledger is done daily or at frequent 
intervals.
To illustrate the posting process, the first journal entry for Jessie Jane’s Campus 
Delivery Service will be posted step by step. There are five steps in the process of post-
ing each debit and credit. First, let’s post the debit to Cash (Figure 4-9).
LEARNING KEY
The general ledger account is 
similar to the T account, but makes 
it easier to maintain a running 
 balance.
LEARNING KEY
Posting is simply the process of 
copying the exact dates and 
 dollar amounts from the journal 
to the ledger.

In the ledger account:
STEP 1  Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column. Enter the year, “20--,” 
the month, “June,” and the day, “1,” in the Date column of the cash 
account.
STEP 2  Enter the debit. Copy the $2,000 debit to Cash in the journal to the Debit 
column of the ledger. Since this is not a formal financial statement, dollar 
signs are not used.
STEP 3  Enter the balance of the account. Enter the $2,000 balance in the Balance 
columns under Debit. (If the balance of the account is zero, draw a line 
through the Debit and Credit columns.)
STEP 4  Enter the journal page in the Posting Reference column. Enter “J1” in the 
Posting Reference column since the posting came from page 1 of the journal.

The Item column is left blank, except for special reasons such as indicating the 
beginning balance, adjusting, correcting, closing, or reversing entries.
In the journal:
STEP 5  Enter the ledger account number in the Posting Reference column. Enter the 
account number for Cash, 101 (see chart of accounts in Figure 4-2 on page 
88), in the Posting Reference column of the journal on the same line as the 
debit to Cash for $2,000.
Step 5 is the last step in the posting process. After this step is completed, the 
posting references will indicate which journal entries have been posted to the 
ledger accounts. This is very helpful, particularly if you are interrupted during 
the posting process. The information in the Posting Reference columns of the 
 journal and ledger provides a link between the journal and ledger known as a 
cross-reference.
Now let’s post the credit portion of the first entry (Figure 4-10).

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
THE TRIAL BALANCE
In Chapter 3, a trial balance was used to prove that the totals of the debit and credit 
balances in the T accounts were equal. In this chapter, a trial balance is used to prove 
the equality of the debits and credits in the ledger accounts. A trial balance can be 
prepared daily, weekly, monthly, or whenever desired. Before preparing a trial balance, 
all transactions should be journalized and posted so that the effect of all transactions 
will be reflected in the ledger accounts.
The trial balance for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service shown in Figure 4-13 
was prepared from the balances in the general ledger in Figure 4-12. The accounts are 
listed in the order used in the chart of accounts. This order is also often used when 
preparing financial statements. In Chapter 2, we pointed out that many firms list 
expenses from highest to lowest amounts. Some firms list expenses according to the 
chart of accounts, which is the method we will follow.
LEARNING KEY
The chart of accounts determines 
the order for listing accounts in the 
general ledger and trial balance. 
This order may also be used when 
preparing financial statements.

FIGURE 4-13 Trial Balance
Even though the trial balance indicates that the ledger is in balance, the ledger can 
still contain errors. For example, if a journal entry was made debiting or crediting the 
wrong accounts, or if an item was posted to the wrong account, the ledger will still be 
in balance. It is important, therefore, to be very careful in preparing the journal entries 
and in posting them to the ledger accounts.

FINDING AND CORRECTING ERRORS 
IN THE TRIAL BALANCE
Tips are available to help if your trial balance has an error. Figure 4-14 offers hints for 
finding the error when your trial balance does not balance.
LO6 Explain how to find 
and correct errors.
1.
Double check your addition. Review balances to see if they are too large or small, relative to other
accounts, or entered in the wrong column.
2.
Find the diﬀerence between the debits and the credits.
a.
If the diﬀerence is equal to the amount of a speciﬁc transaction, perhaps you forgot to post the
debit or credit portion of this transaction.
b.
Divide the diﬀerence by 2. If the diﬀerence is evenly divisible by 2, you may have posted two
debits or two credits for a transaction. If a debit was posted as a credit, it would mean that one
transaction had two credits and no debits. The diﬀerence between the total debits and credits
would be twice the amount of the debit that was posted as a credit.
c.
Divide the diﬀerence by 9. If the diﬀerence is evenly divisible by 9, you may have committed a
 
slide error or a transposition error. A slide occurs when debit or credit amounts “slide”a digit
 
or two to the left or right when entered. For example, if $250 was entered as $25: 
 
$250
$25
=
$225
$225
÷
  9
=
$25
The diﬀerence is evenly divisible by 9.
A transposition occurs when two digits are reversed. For example, if $250 was entered as $520:
$520
$250
=
$270
$270
÷
  9
=
$30
Again, the diﬀerence is evenly divisible by 9.
FIGURE 4-14 Tips for Finding Errors in the Trial Balance
If the tips in Figure 4-14 don’t work, you must retrace your steps through the 
accounting process. Double check your addition for the ledger accounts. Also trace all 
postings. Be patient as you search for your error. Use this process as an opportunity to 
reinforce your understanding of the flow of information through the accounting 
system. Much can be learned while looking for an error.
Once you have found an error, there are two methods of making the correction. 
Although you may want to erase when correcting your homework, this is not accept-
able in practice. An erasure may suggest that you are trying to hide something. You 
should use the ruling method or make a correcting entry instead.
RULING METHOD
The ruling method should be used to correct two types of errors.
1. When an incorrect journal entry has been made, but not yet posted.
2.  When a proper entry has been made but posted to the wrong account or for the 
wrong amount.
When using the ruling method, draw a single line through the incorrect account 
title or amount and write the correct information directly above the line. Corrections 
should be initialed by someone authorized to make such changes. This is done so the 
source and reason for the correction can be traced. This type of correction may be 
made in the journal or ledger accounts, as shown in Figure 4-15.

CORRECTING ENTRY METHOD
If an incorrect entry has been journalized and posted to the wrong account, a correct-
ing entry should be made. For example, assume that a $400 payment for Rent Expense 
was incorrectly debited to Repair Expense and correctly credited to Cash. This requires 
a correcting entry and explanation as shown in Figure 4-16. Figure 4-17 shows 
the effects of the correcting entry on the ledger accounts. Generally, “Correcting” is 
written in the Item column of the general ledger account.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
LO2  Describe the chart of accounts as 
a means of classifying financial 
information.
The chart of accounts includes the account titles in numeri-
cal order for all assets, liabilities, owner’s equity, revenues, and 
expenses. The chart of accounts is used in classifying information 
about transactions.
LO3  Describe and explain the purpose 
of source documents.
Source documents trigger the analysis of business transactions 
and the entries into the accounting system.
LO4  Journalize transactions.
A journal provides a day-by-day listing of transactions. The journal 
shows the date, titles of the accounts to be debited or credited, and 
the amounts of the debits and credits. The steps in the journalizing 
process are as follows:
 
1. Enter the date.
 
2. Enter the debit. Accounts to be debited are entered first.
 
3.  Enter the credit. Accounts to be credited are entered after 
the debits and are indented one-half inch.
 
4.  Enter the explanation. A brief explanation of the transac-
tion should be entered in the description column on the 
line following the last credit. The explanation should be 
indented an additional one-half inch.
LO5  Post to the general ledger and 
prepare a trial balance.
The general ledger is a complete set of all accounts used by the 
business. The steps in posting from the general journal to the gen-
eral ledger are as follows:
In the general ledger:
 
1. Enter the date of each transaction.
 
2. Enter the amount of each debit or credit in the Debit or 
Credit column.
 
3. Enter the new balance.
 
4.  Enter the journal page number from which each transac-
tion is posted in the Posting Reference column.
In the journal:
 
5.  Enter the account number to which each transaction is 
posted in the Posting Reference column.
The trial balance provides a check to make sure the total of all debit 
balances in the ledger accounts equals the total of all credit balances 
in the ledger accounts.
LO6  Explain how to find and correct 
errors.
Errors may be found by verifying your addition, by dividing the 
difference between the debits and credits by 2 or 9, and by retrac-
ing your steps through the accounting process. Use the ruling 
method or the correcting entry method to correct the error.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
You are a public accountant with many small business clients. During a recent visit to 
a client’s business, the bookkeeper approached you with a problem. The columns of 
the trial balance were not equal. You helped the bookkeeper find and correct the error, 
but believe you should go one step further. Write a memo to all of your clients that 
explains the purpose of the double-entry framework, the importance of maintaining 
the equality of the accounting equation, the errors that might cause an inequality, and 
suggestions for finding the errors.

CHALLENGE PROBLEM
Journal entries and a trial balance for Fred Phaler Consulting follow. As you will note, 
the trial balance does not balance, suggesting that there are errors. Recall that the 
chapter offers tips on identifying individual posting errors. These techniques are not 
as effective when there are two or more errors. Thus, you will need to first carefully 
inspect the trial balance to see if you can identify any obvious errors due to amounts 
that either look out of proportion or are simply reported in the wrong place. Then, you 
will need to carefully evaluate the other amounts by using the  techniques offered in the 
text, or tracing the journal entries to the amounts reported on the trial balance. (Hint: 
Four errors were made in the posting process and  preparation of the trial balance.)

Adjusting Entries and 
the Work Sheet
Floyd’s 99 Barbershops was founded in 2001 and currently 
has 350 employees. The company generates over $15 million 
in revenues annually. Floyd’s 99 is a contemporary full-service 
barbershop/hair-care concept off ering haircuts, coloring, styling, 
and shaves. In a setting where Hard Rock meets haircuts, custom-
ers listen to custom designed Floyd’s 99 Radio, watch TV, surf the 
internet, and get a signature shoulder massage and hot lather 
neck shave all as a part of their overall haircut experience. About 
80% of Floyd’s 99 customers are male. The company has an aggres-
sive expansion program and requires that franchisees be able to 
immediately fund and open three to fi ve branches. Headquartered 
in Greenwood Village, Colorado, Floyd’s 99 has shops in nine states, 
primarily Colorado, California, and Texas. Over half of the current 
40 locations are corporately owned, and the rest are franchise 
owned.
As a rapidly growing company, Floyd’s 99 uses the accrual basis of 
accounting, which requires making end-of-period adjusting entries. 
In this chapter, you will learn why adjusting entries are important, 
how they are made, and how they aff ect the fi nancial statements. 
In addition, you will learn how to use a work sheet to help in the 
preparation of adjusting entries and the fi nancial statements.

Up to this point, you have learned how to journalize business transactions, post to the led-
ger, and prepare a trial balance. Now it is time to learn how to make end-of-period adjustments 
to the accounts listed in the trial balance. This chapter explains the need for adjustments and 
illustrates how they are made with or without the use of a work sheet.
END-OF-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS
Throughout the accounting period, business transactions are entered in the accounting 
system. These transactions are based on exchanges between the business and other 
companies and individuals. During the accounting period, other changes occur that 
affect the business’s financial condition. For example, equipment is wearing out, prepaid 
insurance and supplies are being used up, and employees are earning wages that have 
not yet been paid. Since these events have not been entered into the accounting system, 
adjusting entries must be made prior to the preparation of financial statements.
The matching principle in accounting requires the matching of revenues earned 
during an accounting period with the expenses incurred to produce the revenues. This 
approach offers the best measure of net income. The income statement reports earn-
ings for a specific period of time, and the balance sheet reports the assets, liabilities, 
and owner’s equity on a specific date. Thus, to follow the matching principle, the 
accounts must be brought up to date before financial statements are prepared. This 
requires adjusting some of the accounts listed in the trial balance. Figure 5-1 lists rea-
sons to adjust the trial balance.
LO1 Prepare end-of-period 
adjustments.
 
Chapter 5          Adjusting Entries and the Work Sheet
131
Transactions are entered as 
they occur throughout the 
year. Adjustments are made 
at the end of the accounting 
period for items that do not 
involve exchanges with an 
outside party.
1. To report all revenues earned during the accounting period.
2.  To report all expenses incurred to produce the revenues earned in the accounting period.
3.  To accurately report the assets on the balance sheet date. Some assets may have been used up
during the accounting period.
4.  To accurately report the liabilities on the balance sheet date. Expenses may have been incurred
but not yet paid.
FIGURE 5-1 Reasons to Adjust the Trial Balance
Generally, adjustments are made and financial statements prepared at the end of a 
12-month period called a fiscal year. This period does not need to be the same as a 
calendar year. In fact, many businesses schedule their fiscal year-end for a time when 
business is slow. In this chapter, we continue the illustration of Jessie Jane’s Campus 
Delivery Service and will prepare adjustments at the end of the first month of opera-
tions. We will focus on the following accounts: Supplies, Prepaid Insurance, Wages 
Expense, and Delivery Equipment.
LEARNING KEY
Matching revenues earned with 
expenses incurred to produce 
those revenues offers the best 
measure of net income.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
SUPPLIES
During June, Jessie purchased supplies consisting of paper, pens, and delivery enve-
lopes for $80. Since these supplies were expected to provide future benefits, Supplies, 
an asset, was debited at the time of the purchase. No other entries were made to the 
supplies account during June. As reported on the trial balance in Figure 5-2, the $80 
balance remains in the supplies account at the end of the month.
As supplies are used, an expense is incurred. However, it is not practical to make 
a journal entry to recognize this expense and the reduction in the supplies account 
every time someone uses an envelope. It is more efficient to wait until the end of the 
accounting period to make one adjusting entry to reflect the expense incurred for the 
use of supplies for the entire month.
A BROADER VIEW
Adjusting Entries
Are adjusting entries important? The Walt Disney Company 
and Mattel, Inc., probably think so. The Walt Disney Company 
granted Mattel, Inc., the right to make and sell toys based on 
Disney characters. In return, Mattel agreed to make payments 
to Disney as the toys were sold. One of the issues in a court case 
was whether Mattel should have made an adjusting entry when 
it fell behind on these payments. The entry would have been:
Royalty Expense 
17,000,000
 
Accounts Payable (Disney) 
17,000,000
This adjusting entry would have reduced Mattel’s fourth-
quarter earnings for that year by more than 15%. Following 
an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
Mattel eventually agreed to make an adjustment to later 
financial statements.

LEARNING KEY
Since it is not practical to make a 
journal entry for supplies expense 
each time supplies are used, one 
adjusting entry is made at the 
end of the accounting period.
LEARNING KEY
By making an adjusting entry 
that debits Supplies Expense and 
credits Supplies, you are taking 
the amount of supplies used 
out of Supplies and putting it in 
Supplies Expense.

At the end of the month, an inventory, or physical count, of the remaining supplies 
is taken. The inventory shows that supplies costing $20 were still unused at the end of 
June. Since Jessie bought supplies costing $80, and only $20 worth remain, supplies 
costing $60 must have been used ($80 – $20 = $60). Thus, supplies expense for the 
month is $60.
Since $60 worth of supplies have been used, Supplies Expense is debited and 
Supplies (asset) is credited for $60. This entry is illustrated in Figure 5-3 in T account 
and general journal form. Thus, as shown in Figure 5-4, supplies with a cost of $20 
will be reported as an asset on the balance sheet and a supplies expense of $60 will be 
reported on the income statement. The adjusting entry affected an income statement 
account (Supplies Expense) and a balance sheet account (Supplies).
PREPAID INSURANCE
On June 18, Jessie paid $200 for an eight-month liability insurance policy with cover-
age beginning on June 1. Prepaid Insurance, an asset, was debited because the insurance

policy is expected to provide future benefits. The $200 balance is reported on the trial 
balance. As the insurance policy expires with the passage of time, the asset should be 
reduced and an expense recognized.
Since the $200 premium covers eight months, the cost of the expired coverage for 
June is $25 ($200 ÷ 8 months). As shown in Figure 5-5, the adjusting entry is to debit 
Insurance Expense for $25 and credit Prepaid Insurance for $25. Figure 5-6 shows 
that the unexpired portion of the insurance premium will be reported on the balance 
sheet as Prepaid Insurance of $175. The expired portion will be reported on the 
income statement as Insurance Expense of $25.
WAGES EXPENSE
Jessie paid her part-time employees $650 on June 27. Since then, they have earned 
an additional $50, but have not yet been paid. The additional wages expense must 
be recognized.
Since the employees have not been paid, Wages Payable, a liability, should be 
established. Thus, Wages Expense is debited and Wages Payable is credited for $50 in

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
DEPRECIATION EXPENSE
During the month of June, Jessie purchased three motor scooters. Since the scooters 
will provide future benefits, they were recorded as assets in the delivery equipment 
account. Under the historical cost principle, assets are recorded at their actual cost, in 
this case $3,600. This cost remains on the books as long as the business owns the 
asset. No adjustments are made for changes in the market value of the asset. It does 
not matter whether the firm got a “good buy” or paid “too much” when the asset was 
purchased.
The period of time that an asset is expected to help produce revenues is called its 
useful life. The asset’s useful life expires as a result of wear and tear or because it no 
longer satisfies the needs of the business. For example, as Jessie adds miles to her scoot-
ers, they will become less reliable and will eventually fail to run. As this happens, 
depreciation expense should be recognized and the value of the asset should be 
reduced. Depreciation is a method of matching an asset’s original cost against the 
revenues produced over its useful life. There are many depreciation methods. In our 
example, we will use the straight-line method.
Let’s assume that Jessie’s motor scooters have estimated useful lives of three years 
and will have no salvage value at the end of that time period. Salvage value (also called 
scrap value, or residual value) is the expected market value or selling price of the asset 
at the end of its useful life. The depreciable cost of these scooters is the original cost, 
less salvage value, or $3,600. It is this amount that is subject to depreciation. Let’s also 
assume that a full month’s depreciation is recognized in the month in which an asset 
is purchased.
The depreciable cost is spread over 36 months (3 years × 12 months). Thus, the 
straight-line depreciation expense for the month of June is $100 ($3,600 ÷ 36 months).
LEARNING KEY
The historical cost principle is 
an important accounting con-
cept. Assets are recorded at their 
actual cost. This historical cost 
is not adjusted for changes in 
market values.
To learn about other 
 depreciation methods, 
see the appendix to this 
chapter.
Depreciation expense is 
based on estimates of  
 useful lives and salvage 
values.

Estimated Useful Life
36 months
When we made adjustments for supplies and prepaid insurance, the asset accounts 
were credited to show that they had been consumed. Assets of a durable nature that 
are expected to provide benefits over several years or more, called plant assets, require 
a different approach. The business maintains a record of the original cost and the 
amount of depreciation taken since the asset was acquired. By comparing these two 
amounts, the reader can estimate the relative age of the assets. Thus, instead of credit-
ing Delivery Equipment for the amount of depreciation, a contra-asset account, 
Accumulated Depreciation—Delivery Equipment, is credited. “Contra” means oppo-
site or against. Thus, a contra-asset has a credit balance (the opposite of an asset) and 
is deducted from the related asset account on the balance sheet.
As shown in Figure 5-9, the appropriate adjusting entry consists of a debit 
to Depreciation Expense—Delivery Equipment and a credit to Accumulated 
Depreciation—Delivery Equipment. Note the position of the accumulated deprecia-
tion account in the accounting equation. It is shown in the assets section, directly 
beneath Delivery Equipment. Contra-asset accounts should always be shown along 
with the related asset account. Therefore, Delivery Equipment and Accumulated 
Depreciation—Delivery Equipment are shown together.
LEARNING KEY
Depreciable assets provide ben-
efits over more than one year. 
Therefore, the historical cost of 
the asset remains in the asset 
account. To show that it has 
been depreciated, a contra-asset 
account is used.

The same concept is used on the balance sheet. Note in Figure 5-10 that 
Accumulated Depreciation is reported immediately beneath Delivery Equipment as a 
deduction. The difference between these accounts is known as the book value, or 
undepreciated cost, of the delivery equipment. Book value simply means the value car-
ried on the books or in the accounting records. It does not represent the market value, 
or selling price, of the asset.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
The cost ($3,600) remains unchanged, but the accumulated depreciation has 
increased to $200. This represents the depreciation that has accumulated since the 
delivery equipment was purchased ($100 in June and $100 in July). The depreciation 
expense for July is $100, the same as reported for June. Depreciation expense is 
reported for a specific time period. It does not accumulate across reporting periods.
If financial statements are prepared at the end of the year, December 31, 20--, 
the results for the seven months of operations would be presented as shown in 
Figure 5-12. Depreciation expense for the year is $700 ($100 × 7 months), and 
the accumulated depreciation would be the same because this is the first year of 
operation.
EXPANDED CHART OF ACCOUNTS
Several new accounts were needed to make the adjusting entries. New accounts are easily 
added to the chart of accounts, as shown in Figure 5-13. Note the close relationship 
between assets and contra-assets in the numbering of the accounts. Contra-accounts 
carry the same number as the related asset account with a “.1” suffix. For example, 
Delivery Equipment is account number 185 and the contra-asset account, Accumulated 
Depreciation—Delivery Equipment, is account number 185.1.
POSTING ADJUSTING ENTRIES
Adjusting entries are posted to the general ledger in the same manner as all other 
entries, except that “Adjusting” is written in the Item column of the general ledger. 
Figure 5-14 shows the posting of the adjusting entries. The posting reference numbers 
are inserted as each entry is posted.

THE WORK SHEET
A work sheet pulls together all of the information needed to enter adjusting entries and 
prepare the financial statements. Work sheets are not financial statements, are not a 
formal part of the accounting system, and are not a required part of the accounting 
process.  However, many accountants prepare them because they are very helpful in 
planning the adjustments and preparing the financial statements.  Ordinarily, only the 
accountant uses a work sheet. For this reason, a work sheet is usually prepared in 
pencil or as a computer spreadsheet.  As computer use has become more common, the 
term “spreadsheet” is often used in place of “work sheet.”
THE 10-COLUMN WORK SHEET
Although a work sheet can take several forms, a common format has a column for 
account titles and 10 amount columns grouped into five pairs. The work sheet format 
and the five steps in preparing the work sheet are illustrated in Figure 5-15 on page 
142A. As with financial statements, the work sheet has a heading consisting of the 
name of the company, name of the working paper, and the date of the accounting 
period just ended. The five major column headings for the work sheet are Trial 
Balance, Adjustments, Adjusted Trial Balance, Income Statement, and Balance Sheet.

Chapter 5          Adjusting Entries and the Work Sheet 
141
PREPARING THE WORK SHEET
Let’s apply the five steps required for the preparation of a work sheet to Jessie Jane’s 
Campus Delivery Service.
STEP 1  Prepare the Trial Balance. As shown in Figure 5-16 on page 142B, the first 
pair of amount columns is for the trial balance. The trial balance assures the 
equality of the debits and credits before the adjustment process begins. The 
columns should be double ruled to show that they are equal.
 Note that all accounts listed in the expanded chart of accounts are included 
in the Trial Balance columns of the work sheet. This is done even though some 
accounts have zero balances. The accounts with zero balances could be added 
to the bottom of the list as they are needed for adjusting entries. However, it 
is easier to include them now, especially if preparing the work sheet on an 
electronic spreadsheet. Listing the accounts within their proper classifications 
(assets, liabilities, etc.) also makes it easier to extend the amounts to the 
proper columns.
STEP 2  Prepare the Adjustments. As shown in Figure 5-17 on page 142C, the second 
pair of amount columns is used to prepare the adjusting entries. Enter the 
adjustments directly in these columns. When an account is debited or cred-
ited, the amount is entered on the same line as the name of the account and 
in the appropriate Adjustments Debit or Credit column. A small letter in 
parentheses identifies each adjusting entry made on the work sheet.

ADJUSTMENT (d):
Depreciation on the motor scooters is recognized.
 
 
Debit 
Credit
Depreciation Expense—Delivery Equipment 
100
 
Accumulated Depreciation—Delivery Equipment 
 
100
When all adjustments have been entered on the work sheet, each column should 
be totaled to assure that the debits equal the credits for all entries. After balancing the 
columns, they should be double ruled.
LEARNING KEY
For adjustments (a), (b), and (d), 
we are simply recognizing that 
assets have been used. When 
this happens, the asset must be 
decreased and an expense rec-
ognized. Note that the reported 
amount for delivery equipment 
is reduced by crediting a contra-
asset.
LEARNING KEY
Adjustment (c) recognizes an 
economic event that has not 
required an actual transaction 
yet. Employees earned wages, but 
have not been paid. The adjust-
ment recognizes an expense and 
a liability.

142 
PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
STEP 3  Prepare the Adjusted Trial Balance. As shown in Figure 5-18 on page 142D, 
the third pair of amount columns on the work sheet is the Adjusted Trial 
Balance columns. 
When an account balance is not affected by entries in the Adjustments 
• 
columns, the amount in the Trial Balance columns is extended directly to 
the Adjusted Trial Balance columns. 
When affected by an entry in the Adjustments columns, the account bal-
• 
ance to be entered in the Adjusted Trial Balance columns increases or 
decreases by the amount of the adjusting entry.
For example, in Jessica Jane’s business, Supplies is listed in the Trial 
Balance Debit column as $80. Since the entry of $60 is in the Adjustments 
Credit column, the amount extended to the Adjusted Trial Balance Debit 
column is $20 ($80 – $60).
Wages Expense is listed in the Trial Balance Debit column as $650. Since 
$50 is in the Adjustments Debit column, the amount extended to the Adjusted 
Trial Balance Debit column is $700 ($650 + $50).
After all extensions have been made, the Adjusted Trial Balance columns 
are totaled to prove the equality of the debits and the credits. Once balanced, 
the columns are double ruled.
STEP 4  Extend Adjusted Balances to the Income Statement and Balance Sheet 
Columns. As shown in Figure 5-19 on page 142E, each account listed in the 
Adjusted Trial Balance must be extended to either the Income Statement or 
Balance Sheet columns. The Income Statement columns show the amounts 
that will be reported in the income statement. All revenue accounts are 
extended to the Income Statement Credit column and expense accounts are 
extended to the Income Statement Debit column.
The asset, liability, drawing, and capital accounts are extended to the 
Balance Sheet columns. Although called the Balance Sheet columns, these 
columns of the work sheet show the amounts that will be reported in the bal-
ance sheet and the statement of owner’s equity. The asset and drawing 
accounts are extended to the Balance Sheet Debit column. The liability and 
owner’s capital accounts are extended to the Balance Sheet Credit column.
STEP 5  Complete the Work Sheet. To complete the work sheet, first total the Income 
Statement columns. If the total of the credits (revenues) exceeds the total of 
the debits (expenses), the difference represents net income. If the total of the 
debits exceeds the total of the credits, the difference represents a net loss.
The Income Statement columns of Jessie’s work sheet in Figure 5-20 on 
page 142F show total credits of $2,150 and total debits of $1,135. The differ-
ence, $1,015, is the net income for the month of June. This amount should be 
added to the Debit column to balance the Income Statement columns. “Net 
Income” should be written on the same line in the Account Title column. If the 
business had a net loss, the amount of the loss would be added to the Income 
Statement Credit column and the words “Net Loss” would be written in the 
Account Title column. Once balanced, the columns should be double ruled.
Finally, the Balance Sheet columns are totaled. The difference between the 
totals of these columns also is the amount of net income or net loss for the 
accounting period. If the total debits exceed the total credits, the difference is 
net income. If the total credits exceed the total debits, the difference is a net 
loss. This difference should be the same as the difference we found for the 
Income Statement columns.
LEARNING KEY
The Balance Sheet columns show 
the amounts for both the bal-
ance sheet and the statement of 
owner’s equity.
LEARNING KEY
In the Balance Sheet columns 
of the work sheet, total debits 
minus total credits equals net 
income if greater than zero and 
equals net loss if less than zero.

JOURNALIZING ADJUSTING ENTRIES FROM 
THE WORK SHEET
Keep in mind that the work sheet simply helps the accountant organize the end-of-
period work. Writing the adjustments on the work sheet has no effect on the ledger 
accounts in the accounting system. The only way to change the balance of a ledger 
account is to make a journal entry. Once the work sheet has been completed, simply 
copy the adjustments from the work sheet to the journal, as shown in Figure 5-23.

METHODS OF ACCOUNTING: CASH, MODIFIED 
CASH, AND ACCRUAL
The accrual basis of accounting offers the best matching of revenues and expenses and 
is required under generally accepted accounting principles. GAAP financial statements 
prepared using the accrual method are particularly important when major businesses 
want to raise large amounts of money. Investors and creditors expect GAAP financial 
statements and generally will not invest or make loans without them.
However, many small professional service organizations are not concerned with 
raising large amounts of money from investors and creditors. These organizations 
include CPAs, doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers, and architects. Since these organi-
zations do not need to prepare GAAP financial statements, they often use the cash or 
modified cash basis. If one of these organizations needs to borrow money from a bank 
that requires GAAP financial statements, an accountant can convert the financial 
statements to the accrual basis.
Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when earned. 
Revenues are considered earned when a service is provided or a product sold, regard-
less of whether cash is received. If cash is not received, a receivable is set up.
The accrual basis also assumes that expenses are recorded when incurred. 
Expenses are incurred when a service is received or an asset consumed, regardless of 
when cash is paid. If cash is not paid when a service is received, a payable is set up. 
When assets are consumed, prepaid assets are decreased or long-term assets are depre-
ciated. Since the accrual basis accounts for long-term assets, prepaid assets, receivables, 
and payables, it is the most comprehensive system and best method of measuring 
income for the vast majority of businesses.

Under the cash basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when cash is received 
and expenses are recorded when cash is paid. This method will provide results that are 
similar to the accrual basis if there are few receivables, payables, and assets. However, 
as shown in Figure 5-24, the cash and accrual bases can result in very different mea-
sures of net income if a business has significant amounts of receivables, payables, and 
assets.

The modified cash basis 
is the same as the accrual 
basis, except receivables 
and payables are not 
 recognized for revenues and 
operating expenses.
A third method of accounting combines aspects of the cash and accrual methods. 
With the modified cash basis, a business uses the cash basis for recording revenues and 
most expenses. Exceptions are made when cash is paid for assets with useful lives 
greater than one accounting period. For example, under a strict cash basis, if cash is 
paid for equipment, buildings, supplies, or insurance, the amount is immediately 
recorded as an expense. This approach could cause major distortions when measuring 
net income. Under the modified cash basis, cash payments like these are recorded as 
assets, and adjustments are made each period as under the accrual basis. Liabilities 
associated with the acquisition of these assets are also recognized.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Although similar to the accrual basis, the modified cash basis does not account for 
receivables or for payables for services received. Thus, the modified cash basis is a 
combination of the cash and accrual methods of accounting. The differences and 
similarities among the cash, modified cash, and accrual methods of accounting are 
demonstrated in Figure 5-25.

If all businesses were the same, only one method of accounting would be needed. 
However, businesses vary in their need for major assets like buildings and equipment, 
the amount of customer receivables, and payables to suppliers. For example, if a busi-
ness were rather small with no major assets, receivables, or payables, it would be 
simpler to use the cash basis of accounting. In addition, under these circumstances, the 
difference in net income under the accrual and cash bases of accounting would be 
small. Most individuals fit this description and use the cash basis on their tax 
returns.
Businesses with buildings and equipment, but few receivables and payables, might 
use the modified cash basis. Again, the accounting would be a little simpler and differ-
ences between net income computed under the modified cash and accrual bases would 
be small. Finally, businesses with buildings and equipment, and receivables and pay-
ables, should use the accrual basis of accounting to achieve the best matching of 
 revenues and expenses.

    LEARNING KEY
The shaded areas in Figure 5-25 show that sometimes the modified cash basis is the same as the 
cash basis and sometimes it is the same as the accrual basis. For some transactions, all methods 
are the same.

LO1 Prepare end-of-period 
adjustments.
End-of-period adjustments are necessary to bring the general 
ledger accounts up to date prior to preparing financial statements. 
Reasons to adjust the trial balance are as follows:
 
1. To report all revenues earned during the accounting period.
 
2.  To report all expenses incurred to produce the revenues 
during the accounting period.
 
3.  To accurately report the assets on the balance sheet. Some 
assets may have expired, depreciated, or been used up 
during the accounting period.
 
4.  To accurately report the liabilities on the balance sheet 
date. Expenses may have been incurred, but not yet paid.
LO2  Post adjusting entries to the 
general ledger.
Adjusting entries are posted to the general ledger in the same 
manner as all other entries, except that “Adjusting” is written in 
the Item column of the general ledger.
LO3  Prepare a work sheet.
Steps in preparing the work sheet are as follows:
 
1. Prepare the trial balance.
 
2. Prepare the adjustments.
 
3. Prepare the adjusted trial balance.
 
4.  Extend the adjusted account balances to the Income 
Statement and Balance Sheet columns.
 
5.  Total the Income Statement and Balance Sheet columns 
to compute the net income or net loss.
LO4  Describe methods for finding 
errors on the work sheet.
Tips for finding errors on the work sheet include the following:
 
1. Check the addition of all columns.
 
2.  Check the addition and subtraction required when 
extending to the Adjusted Trial Balance columns.
 
3.  Make sure the adjusted account balances have been 
extended to the appropriate columns.
 
4.  Make sure that the net income or net loss has been added 
to the appropriate columns.
LO5  Journalize adjusting entries from 
the work sheet.
The adjustments are copied from the work sheet to the journal. 
The last day of the accounting period is entered in the Date col-
umn and “Adjusting Entries” is written in the Description column.
LO6  Explain the cash, modified cash, 
and accrual bases of accounting.
Cash Basis—Record revenues when cash is received and expenses 
when cash is paid.
Accrual Basis—Record revenues when earned and expenses as 
incurred.
Modified Cash Basis—Same as accrual, except no accounts 
receivable and no accounts payable for operating expenses.

general ledger accounts after making all end-of-period adjustments.
adjusting entries (131) Journal entries made at the end of an accounting period to 
reflect changes in account balances that are not the direct result of an exchange 
with an outside party.
Balance Sheet columns (142) The work sheet columns that show the amounts that 
will be reported in the balance sheet and the statement of owner’s equity.
book value (137) The difference between the asset account and its related accumu-
lated depreciation account. The value reflected by the accounting records.
cash basis of accounting (145) A method of accounting under which revenues are 
recorded when cash is received and expenses are recorded when cash is paid.
contra-asset (136) An account with a credit balance that is deducted from the 
 related asset account on the balance sheet.
depreciable cost (136) The cost of an asset that is subject to depreciation.

several years. Examples include buildings and equipment.
salvage value (136) The expected market value of an asset at the end of its useful 
life.
straight-line method (136) A depreciation method in which the depreciable cost is 
divided by the estimated useful life.
undepreciated cost (137) The difference between the asset account and its related 
accumulated depreciation account. Also known as book value.
useful life (136) The period of time that an asset is expected to help produce 
revenues.
work sheet (140) A form used to pull together all of the information needed to 
enter adjusting entries and prepare the financial statements.

(b) Unexpired insurance on July 31, $420.
(c) Depreciation of office equipment, $325.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
Delia Alvarez, owner of Delia’s Lawn Service, wants to borrow money to buy new lawn 
equipment. A local bank has asked for financial statements. Alvarez has asked you to 
prepare financial statements for the year ended December 31, 20--. You have been 
given the unadjusted trial balance on page 171 and suspect that Alvarez expects you 
to base your statements on this information. You are concerned, however, that some 
of the account balances may need to be adjusted. Write a memo to Alvarez explaining 
what additional information you need before you can prepare the financial statements. 
Alvarez is not familiar with accounting issues. Therefore, explain in your memo why 
you need this information, the potential impact of this information on the financial 
statements, and the importance of making these adjustments before approaching the 
bank for a loan.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Information for year-end adjustments is as follows:
(a) Office supplies on hand at year-end amounted to $100.
(b) On January 1, 20--, Williams purchased office equipment that cost $18,000. It 
has an expected useful life of 10 years and no salvage value.
(c) On July 1, 20--, Williams purchased computer equipment costing $6,000. It has 
an expected useful life of three years and no salvage value. Assume that Williams 
computes depreciation to the nearest full month.
(d) On December 1, 20--, Williams paid a premium of $600 for a six-month insur-
ance policy.
REQUIRED
1. Prepare the work sheet for the year ended December 31, 20--.
2. Prepare adjusting entries in a general journal.
CHALLENGE PROBLEM
Your friend, Diane Kiefner, teaches elementary school and operates her own wilderness 
kayaking tours in the summers. She thinks she has been doing fine financially, but has 
never really measured her profits. Until this year, her business has always had more 
money at the end of the summer than at the beginning. She enjoys kayaking and as long 
as she came out a little ahead, that was fine. Unfortunately, Diane had to dip into her 
savings to make up for “losses” on her kayaking tours this past summer. Hearing that 
you have been studying accounting, she brought a list of cash receipts and expenditures 
and would like you to try to figure out what happened.

When asked for more details on the expenditures and the kayaking gear that you saw 
in her garage, Diane provided the following information:
Expenditures were made on the following items:
Brochures used to advertise her services (Diane only 
used about 1/4 of them and plans to use the 
remainder over the next three summers.) 
$1,000
Food for trips (nothing left) 
2,000
Rent on equipment used by kayakers on trips 
3,000
Travel expenses 
4,000
A new kayak and paddles (At the beginning of the summer, 
Diane bought a new kayak and paddles. Up to this time, 
she had always borrowed her father’s. Diane expects to 
use the equipment for about five years. At that time, she 
expects it to have no value.) 
3,500
A trial balance based on this information follows. As you will note, Diane’s trial 
balance is not consistent with some of the concepts discussed in this chapter.

In Chapter 5, we introduced the straight-line 
method of depreciation. Here, we will review 
this method and illustrate three others: 
sum-of-the-years’-digits; 
double-declining-
balance; and, for tax purposes, the Modified 
Accelerated Cost Recovery System. For all 
illustrations, we will assume that a delivery 
van was purchased for $40,000. It has a five-
year useful life and salvage value of $4,000.
STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD
Under the straight-line depreciation method, 
an equal amount of depreciation will be taken 
each period. First, compute the depreciable 
cost by subtracting the salvage value from the 
cost of the asset. This is done because we 
expect to sell the asset for $4,000 at the end 
of its useful life. Thus, the total cost to be rec-
ognized as an expense over the five years is 
$36,000, not $40,000.
LO1 Prepare a depreciation 
schedule using the 
straight-line method.

Next, we divide the depreciable cost by the expected life of the asset, five years.
When preparing a depreciation schedule, it is often convenient to use a deprecia-
tion rate per year. In this case, it would be 20% (100% ÷ 5 years of life). Figure 5A-1 
shows the depreciation expense, accumulated depreciation, and book value for each 
of the five years.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
SUM-OF-THE-YEARS’-DIGITS
Under the sum-of-the-years’-digits depreciation method, depreciation is determined by 
multiplying the depreciable cost by a schedule of fractions. The numerator of the frac-
tion for a specific year is the number of years of remaining useful life for the asset, 
measured from the beginning of the year. The denominator for all fractions is deter-
mined by adding the digits that represent the years of the estimated life of the asset. 
The calculation of the sum-of-the-years’-digits for our delivery van with a five-year 
useful life is shown below.
LO2 Prepare a depreciation 
schedule using the 
sum-of-the-years’-
digits method.
A depreciation schedule using these fractions is shown in Figure 5A-2.

DOUBLE-DECLINING-BALANCE METHOD
Under the double-declining-balance depreciation method, the book value is multiplied 
by a fixed rate, often double the straight-line rate. The van has a five-year life, so the 
straight-line rate is 1 ÷ 5, or 20%. Double the straight-line rate is 2 × 20%, or 40%. 
The double-declining-balance depreciation schedule is shown in Figure 5A-3. Note 
that the rate is applied to the book value of the asset. Once the book value is reduced 
to the expected salvage value, $4,000, no more depreciation may be recognized.
LO3 Prepare a depreciation 
schedule using the 
double-declining-
balance method.
MODIFIED ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY SYSTEM
For assets purchased since 1986, many firms use the Modified Accelerated Cost
Recovery System (MACRS) for tax purposes. Under this method, the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) classifies various assets according to useful life and sets depreciation rates 
for each year of the asset’s life. These rates are then multiplied by the cost of the asset. 
Even though the van is expected to have a useful life of five years, and a salvage value 
of $4,000, the IRS schedule, shown in Figure 5A-4, spreads the depreciation over a 
six-year period and assumes no salvage value.

purposes using the

Cost Recovery System.

LEARNING KEY
Double means double the straight-
line rate. Declining-balance means 
that the rate is multiplied by the 
book value (not depreciable cost)

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
LO1  Prepare a depreciation schedule 
using the straight-line method.
Under straight-line depreciation, an equal amount of deprecia-
tion is taken each period. Depreciation expense for each year is 
computed as follows:
Cost – Salvage Value  = Depreciable Cost/Expected Years of Life 
= Depreciation Expense per Year
LO2  Prepare a depreciation schedule 
using the sum-of-the-years’-digits 
method.
Under the sum-of-the-years’-digits method, the depreciable cost 
is multiplied by a fraction. The fraction consists of the following:
Remaining Years of Life Measured from the Beginning of the 
Current Year
Sum-of-the-Years’-Digits
If an asset has a life of three years, the sum-of-the-years’-digits is 
equal to:
3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Depreciation would be computed as follows:
Year 1: 3/6 × Depreciable Cost
Year 2: 2/6 × Depreciable Cost
Year 3: 1/6 × Depreciable Cost
 LO3  Prepare a depreciation schedule 
using the double-declining-balance 
method.
Under this method, the book value (the declining balance) is 
multiplied by a fixed rate, often double the straight-line rate.
LO4  Prepare a depreciation schedule 
for tax purposes using the Modified 
Accelerated Cost Recovery System.
Under this method, the IRS provides the depreciation rates to 
be applied to the cost of the asset. Simply multiply the rate pro-
vided by the IRS by the cost of the asset.
KEY TERMS
double-declining-balance depreciation method (177) A depreciation method that 
recognizes depreciation each year by multiplying a rate (typically double the 
straight-line rate) by the book value of the asset.
Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) (177) A depreciation method 
in which rates determined by the IRS are multiplied by the cost of the asset to 
determine depreciation expense for the year.
straight-line depreciation method (175) A depreciation method that recognizes an 
equal amount of depreciation each year.
sum-of-the-years’-digits (176) If an asset has a five-year life, the sum-of-the-years’-
digits is computed as follows: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15.
sum-of-the-years’-digits depreciation method (176) A depreciation method that rec-
ognizes depreciation each year by multiplying a fraction by the depreciable cost. 
The numerator of the fraction is the remaining life of the asset, measured from 
the beginning of the year. The denominator is the sum-of-the-years’-digits.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter
should enable you to:
LO1  Prepare financial statements 
with the aid of a work sheet.
LO2  Journalize and post closing 
entries.
LO3  Prepare a post-closing trial 
balance.
LO4  List and describe the steps 
in the accounting cycle.
Financial Statements and 
the Closing Process
Indy Express Band is central Indiana’s premier variety band. It of-
fers a popular mix of musical styles from Top 40 to Big Band. The 
eight-piece band is led by Greg Imboden, fronted by Cozette Myers, 
driven by a three-piece horn section, and backed by a tight rhythm 
section.  The Indy Express Band is perfect for a wedding reception, 
corporate function, conference event, dinner dance, or charity ball.  
Members of Indy Express Band have provided music for entertain-
ers such as Jay Leno, Rod Stewart, Natalie Cole, Dionne Warwick, 
and Al Jarreau.  
In addition to playing at Jessie Jane’s wedding and other 
events, the band generally performs on New Year’s Eve, the same 
day many businesses prepare closing entries. In this chapter, we 
complete the accounting cycle by demonstrating how to make 
closing entries and prepare the Post-Closing Trial Balance.

The work sheet, introduced in Chapter 5, is used for three major end-of-period activities:
1. journalizing adjusting entries,
2. preparing fi nancial statements, and
3. journalizing closing entries.
This chapter illustrates the use of the work sheet for preparing fi nancial statements and closing 
entries. In addition, the post-closing trial balance is explained and illustrated. All of these activities take 
place at the end of the fi rm’s fi scal year. However, to continue our illustration of Jessie Jane’s Campus 
Delivery Service, we demonstrate these activities at the end of the fi rst month of operations.
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The work sheet prepared in Chapter 5 supplies most of the information needed to 
prepare an income statement, a statement of owner’s equity, and a balance sheet. The 
statements and work sheet columns from which they are derived for Jessie Jane’s 
Campus Delivery Service are shown in Figures 6-1 and 6-2.
As you refer to the financial statements in Figures 6-1 and 6-2, notice the place-
ment of dollar signs, single rulings, and double rulings. Dollar signs are placed at the 
top of each column and beneath rulings. Single rulings indicate addition or subtraction, 
and double rulings are placed under totals. Notice that each statement heading con-
tains three lines: (1) company name, (2) statement title, and (3) period ended or date.
THE INCOME STATEMENT
Figure 6-1 shows how the Income Statement columns of the work sheet provide the 
information needed to prepare an income statement. Revenue is shown first, followed 
by an itemized and totaled list of expenses. Then, net income is calculated to double 
check the accuracy of the work sheet. It is presented with a double ruling as the last 
item in the statement.
The expenses could be listed in the same order that they appear in the chart of 
accounts or in descending order by dollar amount. The second approach helps the 
reader identify the most important expenses.
THE STATEMENT OF OWNER’S EQUITY
The Balance Sheet columns of the work sheet provide most of the information needed 
to prepare a statement of owner’s equity. Figure 6-2 shows that Jessie’s capital account 
balance and the drawing account balance are in the Balance Sheet columns. Be careful, 
however, when using the capital account balance reported on the work sheet. This 
account balance is the beginning balance plus any investments made during the period. 
Recall that Jessie’s beginning capital balance was zero. During June, she made an 
investment of $2,000. Thus, as reported previously, the beginning balance on the state-
ment of owner’s equity must be zero with the $2,000 reported as an investment during 
June. The net income for the month can be found either on the work sheet at the 
bottom of the Income Statement (see Figure 6-1) and Balance Sheet columns or on the 
income statement itself. With these items of information, the statement of owner’s 
equity can be prepared.
LO1 Prepare financial 
statements with the 
aid of a work sheet.
Multiple columns are used 
on the financial statements 
to make them easier to 
read. There are no debit 
or credit columns on the 
financial statements.
LEARNING KEY
The owner’s capital account in the 
general ledger must be reviewed 
to determine if additional invest-
ments were made during the 
accounting period.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
THE BALANCE SHEET
As shown in Figure 6-2, the work sheet and the statement of owner’s equity are used 
to prepare Jessie’s balance sheet. The asset and liability amounts can be found in the 
Balance Sheet columns of the work sheet. The ending balance in Jessica Jane, Capital 
has been computed on the statement of owner’s equity. This amount should be copied 
from the statement of owner’s equity to the balance sheet.
Two important features of the balance sheet in Figure 6-2 should be noted. First, 
it is a report form of balance sheet, which means that the liabilities and owner’s equity 
sections are shown below the assets section. It differs from an account form of balance 
sheet in which the assets are on the left and the liabilities and owner’s equity sections 
are on the right. (See Jessie’s balance sheet illustrated in Figure 2-2 on page 32 in 
Chapter 2.)
Second, it is a classified balance sheet, which means that similar items are grouped 
together on the balance sheet. Assets are classified as current assets and property, plant, 
and equipment. Similarly, liabilities are broken down into current and long-term sec-
tions. The following major balance sheet classifications are generally used.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Current Assets
Current assets include cash and assets that will be converted into cash or consumed 
within either one year or the normal operating cycle of the business, whichever is 
longer. Examples include cash, accounts receivable, supplies, and prepaid insurance. As 
shown in Figure 6-3, an operating cycle is the period of time required to purchase sup-
plies and services and convert them back into cash.

FIGURE 6-3 Operating Cycle
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment, also called plant assets or long-term assets, represent 
assets that are expected to serve the business for many years. Examples include land, 
buildings, and equipment.
Current Liabilities
Current liabilities are due within either one year or the normal operating cycle of the 
business, whichever is longer. They will be paid out of current assets. Accounts payable 
and wages payable are classified as current liabilities.
Long-Term Liabilities
Long-term liabilities, or long-term debt, are obligations that are not expected to be 
paid within a year and do not require the use of current assets. A mortgage on an office 
building is an example of a long-term liability. Jessie has no long-term debts. If she did, 
they would be listed on the balance sheet in the long-term liabilities section immedi-
ately following the current liabilities.
ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS BY THE 
OWNER (REVISITED)
If the owner of a business made additional investments during the accounting period, 
the owner’s capital reported in the Balance Sheet columns of the work sheet represents 
the beginning balance plus any additional investments made during the accounting 
period. If this amount were used as the beginning balance on the statement of owner’s 
equity, it would not equal the ending balance from last period and would create confu-
sion for those comparing the two statements. In addition, the statement would not 
reflect all of the activities affecting the owner’s capital account during the period.
Thus, we must also review the owner’s capital account in the general ledger to get 
the information needed to prepare the statement of owner’s equity. Figure 6-4 illus-
trates this situation for another business, Ramon’s Shopping Service. The $5,000 bal-
ance of July 1, 20--, in Ramon Balboa’s general ledger capital account is used as the 
beginning balance on the statement of owner’s equity. Note that this is also the ending 
balance on June 30, 20--. The additional investment of $3,000 made on July 5 and 
posted to Balboa’s general ledger capital account is reported by writing “Investments 
during period” on the line immediately after the beginning balance. The beginning

balance plus investments during the period equals the total investment by the owner 
in the business and is the amount reported in the Balance Sheet columns of the work 
sheet. From this point, the preparation of the statement is the same as for businesses 
without additional investments.

THE CLOSING PROCESS
Assets, liabilities, and the owner’s capital account accumulate information across 
accounting periods. For example, the cash balance at the end of one accounting period 
must be the same as the cash balance at the beginning of the next period. Thus, the 
balance reported for Cash is a result of all cash transactions since the business first 
opened. This is true for all accounts reported on the balance sheet. For this reason, they 
are called permanent accounts.
Revenue, expense, and drawing accounts accumulate information for only a spe-
cific accounting period. When preparing the financial statements, only revenues, 
expenses, and withdrawals for this year should be reported. Revenues, expenses, and 
withdrawals from prior years should not be included in this year’s financial statements. 
Similarly, this year’s revenues, expenses, and withdrawals should not be included in 
next year’s financial statements. Thus, at the end of the fiscal year, these accounts must 
be closed. The closing process gives these accounts zero balances so they are prepared 
to accumulate new information for the next accounting period. Since these accounts 
are closed at the end of each period, they are called temporary accounts. 
LO2 Journalize and post 
closing entries.
LEARNING KEY
Permanent accounts contain the 
results of all transactions since 
the business started. Their bal-
ances are carried forward to each 
new accounting period.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
The accounting records are closed “as of” December 31, or another fiscal year-
end chosen by the business. The actual adjusting entries, closing entries, and finan-
cial statements are generally prepared several weeks after the official closing date. 
However, it is important to include all transactions occurring prior to year-end in 
the current year’s financial statements. Similarly, transactions taking place after 
year-end must be included in the next year’s financial statements. Improper timing 
of the recognition of transactions taking place around the end of the year can have 
major effects on the reported profits. For example, some businesses have been 
found to “leave the books open” for a few days to include a major sale, or other 
profitable transactions, that actually took place after the end of the fiscal year. 
Thus, proper treatment of transactions taking place around the end of the year is 
carefully monitored by auditors.
The closing process is most clearly demonstrated by returning to the accounting 
equation and T accounts. As shown in Figure 6-5, revenue, expense, and drawing 
accounts impact owner’s equity and should be considered “under the umbrella” of 
the capital account. The effect of these accounts on owner’s equity is formalized at 
the end of the accounting period when the balances of the temporary accounts are 
transferred to the owner’s capital account (a permanent account) during the closing 
process.
The four basic steps in the closing process are illustrated in Figure 6-5. As you 
can see, a new account, Income Summary, is used in the closing process. This 
account may also be called Expense and Revenue Summary. This temporary 
account is used to close the revenue and expense accounts. After closing the reve-
nues and expenses to Income Summary, the balance of this account is equal to the 
net income. This is why it is called Income Summary. Income Summary is opened 
during the closing process. Then it is closed to the owner’s capital account. It does 
not appear on any financial statement. The four steps in the closing process are

Temporary accounts contain infor-
mation for one accounting period. 
These accounts are closed at the 
end of each accounting period.
The income summary 
account is not really needed 
for the closing process. 
Revenue and expense 
accounts can be closed to 
the owner’s capital account. 
One benefit of using the 
income summary account is 
that its balance before closing 
to the capital account equals 
the net income or net loss for 
the period. Thus, it can serve 
as a check of the accuracy 
of the closing entries for 
 revenues and expenses.

STEPS IN THE CLOSING PROCESS
STEP 1  Close Revenue Accounts to Income Summary. Revenues have credit balances 
and increase owner’s equity. Therefore, the revenue account is debited to 
create a zero balance. Income Summary is credited for the same amount.
STEP 2  Close Expense Accounts to Income Summary. Expenses have debit balances and 
reduce owner’s equity. Therefore, the expense accounts are credited to create a 
zero balance. Income Summary must be debited for the total of the expenses.
STEP 3  Close Income Summary to the Owner’s Capital Account. The balance in Income 
Summary represents the net income (credit balance) or net loss (debit balance). 
If net income has been earned, Income Summary is debited to create a zero bal-
ance, and the owner’s capital account is credited. If a net loss has been incurred, 
the owner’s capital account is debited and Income Summary is credited to create 
a zero balance. Figure 6-6 shows examples for closing net income and net loss.
Dashes are entered on the 
debit and credit sides of the 
T accounts to indicate a 
zero balance.

STEP 4  Close Drawing to the Owner’s Capital Account. Drawing has a debit balance 
and reduces owner’s equity. Therefore, it is credited to create a zero balance. 
The owner’s capital account is debited.
Upon completion of these four steps, all temporary accounts have zero balances. 
The earnings and withdrawals for the period have been transferred to the owner’s 
capital account. Closing entries for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service, in T account 
form, are illustrated in Figure 6-7.
JOURNALIZE CLOSING ENTRIES
Of course, to actually change the ledger accounts, the closing entries must be journal-
ized and posted to the general ledger. As shown in Figure 6-8, the balances of the 
accounts to be closed are readily available from the Income Statement and Balance 
Sheet columns of the work sheet. These balances are used to illustrate the closing 
entries for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service, in general journal form. Remember: 
Closing entries are made at the end of the fiscal year. Closing entries made at the end 
of June are illustrated here so you can see the completion of the accounting cycle for 
Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service. Like adjusting entries, the closing entries are 
made on the last day of the accounting period. “Closing Entries” is written in the 
Description column before the first entry and no explanations are required. Note that 
it is best to make one compound entry to close the expense accounts.
LEARNING KEY
The owner can make withdrawals 
from the business at any time, as 
long as the assets are available. 
These withdrawals have nothing 
to do with measuring the prof-
itability of the firm. Thus, they 
are closed directly to the owner’s 
capital account.

POST THE CLOSING ENTRIES
The account numbers have been entered in the Posting Reference column of the jour-
nal to show that the entries have been posted to the ledger accounts illustrated in 
Figure 6-9. Note that “Closing” has been written in the Item column of each account 
to identify the closing entries. Zero account balances are recorded by entering dashes 
in both the Balance Debit and Credit columns.
Computer programs post the 
closing entries to the owner’s 
capital account automatically.

Once the closing entries are posted, 
the general ledger capital account 
balance will agree with the amount 
reported on the balance sheet.
POST-CLOSING TRIAL BALANCE
After posting the closing entries, a post-closing trial balance should be prepared to 
prove the equality of the debit and credit balances in the general ledger accounts. The 
ending balance of each general ledger account that remains open at the end of the 
year is listed. Remember: Only the permanent accounts remain open after the closing 
process is completed. Figure 6-10 shows the post-closing trial balance for Jessie’s 
ledger.
Note that all amounts reflected on the post-closing trial balance are the same as 
reported in the Balance Sheet columns of the work sheet except Drawing and Owner’s 
Capital. Drawing was closed. Owner’s Capital was updated to reflect revenues, 
expenses, and drawing for the accounting period.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
A BROADER VIEW
Importance of Earnings to the Stock 
Market
Investors in the stock market pay close attention to earnings 
reported on the income statement. This information is so 
important that corporate officials often announce expected 
earnings before the financial statements are actually distrib-
uted to the public. If the announcement is different from what 
investors are expecting, the price of the stock may go up or 
down. For example, when Aetna, a leader in the managed 
health care industry, warned that earnings would be about 
27% lower than expected by stock analysts, its stock price fell 
more than 10%.
FLUXFOTO/ISTOCKPHOTO.COM
THE ACCOUNTING CYCLE
The steps involved in accounting for all of the business activities during an accounting 
period are called the accounting cycle. The cycle begins with the analysis of source 
documents and ends with a post-closing trial balance. A brief summary of the steps in 
the cycle follows.
STEPS IN THE ACCOUNTING CYCLE
During Accounting Period
STEP 1  Analyze source documents.
STEP 2  Journalize the transactions.
STEP 3  Post to the general ledger accounts.
End of Accounting Period
STEP 4  Prepare a trial balance.
STEP 5  Determine and prepare the needed adjustments on the work sheet.
STEP 6  Complete an end-of-period work sheet. 
STEP 7  Journalize and post the adjusting entries.
STEP 8   Prepare an income statement, a statement of owner’s equity, and a balance 
sheet.
STEP 9  Journalize and post the closing entries.
STEP 10 Prepare a post-closing trial balance.
Steps 4 through 10 in the preceding list are performed as of the last day of the 
accounting period. This does not mean that they are actually done on the last day. The 
accountant may not be able to do any of these things until the first few days (some-
times weeks) of the next period. Nevertheless, the work sheet, statements, and entries 
are prepared as of the closing date.
LO4 List and describe the 
steps in the accounting 
cycle.
LEARNING KEY
Properly analyzing and journaliz-
ing transactions is very important. 
A mistake made in step 1 is car-
ried through the entire accounting 
cycle.

SELF-STUDY
LO1 Prepare financial statements with 
the aid of a work sheet.
The work sheet is used as an aid in preparing:
 
1. adjusting entries,
 
2. financial statements, and
 
3. closing entries.
The following classifications are used for accounts reported on 
the balance sheet.
 
• 
 Current assets include cash and assets that will be con-
verted into cash or consumed within either one year or 
the normal operating cycle of the business, whichever is 
longer. An operating cycle is the time required to purchase 
supplies and services and convert them back into cash.
 
• 
 Property, plant, and equipment, also called plant assets 
or long-term assets, represent assets that are expected to 
serve the business for many years.
 
• 
 Current liabilities are liabilities that are due within either 
one year or the normal operating cycle of the business, 
whichever is longer, and that are to be paid out of current 
assets.
 
• 
 Long-term liabilities, or long-term debt, are obligations 
that are not expected to be paid within a year and do not 
require the use of  current assets.
LO2  Journalize and post closing 
entries.
Steps in the closing process are:
 
1. Close revenue accounts to Income Summary.
 
2. Close expense accounts to Income Summary.
 
3. Close Income Summary to the owner’s capital account.
 
4. Close Drawing to the owner’s capital account.

PART 1 
Accounting for a Service Business
Thus far, we have discussed three financial 
statements: the income statement, the state-
ment of owner’s equity, and the balance 
sheet. A fourth statement, the statement of 
cash flows, is also very important. It 
explains what the business did to generate 
cash and how the cash was used. This is 
done by categorizing all cash transactions 
into three types of activities: operating, 
investing, and financing.
TYPES OF BUSINESS 
ACTIVITIES
Cash flows from operating activities are related to the revenues and expenses reported 
on the income statement. Examples include cash received for services performed and 
the payment of cash for expenses.
Investing activities are those transactions involving the purchase and sale of long-
term assets, lending money, and collecting the principal on the related loans.
Financing activities are those transactions dealing with the exchange of cash 
between the business and its owners and creditors. Examples include cash received 
from the owner to finance the operations and cash paid to the owner as withdrawals. 
Financing activities also include borrowing cash and repaying the loan principal.
Figure 6A-1 provides a review of the transactions for Jessie Jane’s Campus 
Delivery Service for the month of June. The transactions are classified as operating, 
investing, or financing, and an explanation for the classification is provided.
LO1 Classify business 
transactions as 
operating, investing, 
or financing.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this appendix should 
enable you to:
LO1  Classify business transactions 
as operating, investing, or 
financing.
LO2  Prepare a statement of cash 
flows by analyzing and cat-
egorizing a series of business 
transactions.
    LEARNING KEY
Lending money to another entity is an outflow of cash from investing activities. The collection 
of the principal when the loan is due is an inflow of cash from investing activities. Borrowing 
cash is an inflow from financing activities. Repayment of the loan principal is an outflow from 
financing activities.

Financing
Cash received from the owner is an inflow from financing
activities. Don’t be fooled by the word “invested.”From the
company’s point of view, this is a way to finance the business.
Purchases of long-term assets are investments.
This transaction will not affect the main sections of the 
statement of cash flows. (This is a noncash investing and 
financing activity.)
Repayments of loans are financing activities.
Cash received as a result of providing services is classified as an
operating activity.
Cash payments for expenses are classified as operating activities.
Cash payments for expenses are classified as operating activities.
This transaction will not affect the statement of cash flows.
Cash payments for expenses are classified as operating activities.
Most of these supplies were used up. Those that remain will be
used in the near future. These are not long-term assets and, thus,
do not qualify as investments.
Cash payments for expenses are classified as operating activities.
Prepaid Insurance is not considered a long-term asset and, thus,
does not qualify as an investment.

operating activity.
Purchases of long-term assets are investments. Only the $300
cash paid will be reported on the statement of cash flows.

SUMMARY OF

JANE’S CAMPUS DELIVERY SERVICE
TYPE OF
TRANSACTION
EXPLANATION
FIGURE 6A-1 Summary of Transactions for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service
PREPARING THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS
The classifications of the cash transactions for Jessie Jane’s Campus Delivery Service 
are summarized in the expanded cash T account shown in Figure 6A-2. Using this 
information, we can prepare a statement of cash flows. As shown in Figure 6A-3, the 
heading is similar to that used for the income statement. Since the statement of cash 
flows reports on the flow of cash for a period of time, the statement is dated for the 
month ended June 30, 20--.
LO2 Prepare a statement 
of cash flows by 
analyzing and 
categorizing a series of 
business transactions.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The main body of the statement is arranged in three sections: operating, investing, 
and financing activities. First, cash received from customers is listed under operating 
activities. Then, cash payments for operating activities are listed and totaled. The net 
amount is reported as net cash provided by operating activities. Since this is the main 
purpose of the business, it is important to be able to generate positive cash flows from 
operating activities.
The next two sections list the inflows and outflows from investing and financing 
activities. Debits to the cash account are inflows and credits are outflows. Note that 
there was an outflow, or net use of cash, from investing activities resulting from the 
purchase of the motor scooters. In addition, cash was provided from financing activities 
because Jessie’s initial investment more than covered her withdrawal and the payment 
on the loan. These investing and financing activities are typical for a new business.

Chapter 6 Appendix          Statement of Cash Flows
219
The sum of the inflows and outflows from operating, investing, and financing 
activities equals the net increase (or decrease) in the cash account during the period. 
Since this is a new business, the cash account had a beginning balance of zero. The 
ending balance is $370. This agrees with the net increase in cash of $370 reported on 
the statement of cash flows.
This appendix introduces you to the purpose and format of the statement of cash 
flows. Here, we classified entries made to the cash account as operating, investing, or 
financing. These classifications were then used to prepare the statement. Businesses have 
thousands of entries to the cash account. Thus, this approach to preparing the statement 
is not really practical. Other approaches to preparing the statement will be discussed in 
Chapter 23. However, the purpose and format of the statements are the same.
LEARNING KEY
To prove the accuracy of the 
statement of cash flows, com-
pare the net increase or decrease 
reported on the statement with 
the change in the balance of the 
cash account.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Key Points to Remember
LO1  Classify business transactions as 
operating, investing, or financing.
The purpose of the statement of cash flows is to report what 
the firm did to generate cash and how the cash was used. 
Business transactions are classified as operating, investing, 
and financing activities.
Operating activities are those transactions related to the 
revenues and expenses reported on the income statement.
Investing activities are those transactions involving the pur-
chase and sale of long-term assets, lending money, and col-
lecting the principal on the related loans.
Financing activities are those transactions dealing with the 
exchange of cash between the business and its owners and 
creditors.
LO2  Prepare a statement of cash flows by 
analyzing and categorizing a series of 
business transactions.
The main body of the statement of cash flows consists of 
three sections: operating, investing, and financing activities.

Accounting for Cash
H2O Audio was founded in 2003 and has its home offi  ce in San 
Diego, California. Its key products are waterproof headphones, 
armbands and cases, and headsets designed to enable swimmers, 
surfers, and divers to use their iPods underwater. H2O sells its mer-
chandise online, in major electronics stores such as Best Buy, and 
in many outdoor and sports shops throughout the United States. 
The company started quite small, but its revenues increased from 
$440,000 in 2004 to $4 million in 2008, for a growth of over 800% 
in just four years.
Two of the challenges for a company growing as fast as H2O 
Audio are managing and protecting its cash. H2O has multiple 
checking accounts, receives cash receipts from multiple sources, 
and makes cash payments for many diff erent bills. The company 
must have clear procedures and complete and accurate records 
in order to properly control cash and to plan for future needs. In 
this chapter, you will learn some of the ways to manage this critical 
business asset.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter should 
enable you to:
LO1  Describe how to open and 
use a checking account.
LO2  Prepare a bank 
reconciliation and related 
journal entries.
LO3  Establish and use a petty 
cash fund.
LO4  Establish a change fund and 
use the cash short and over 
account.

CHECKING ACCOUNT
The key documents and forms required in opening and using a checking account are 
the signature card, deposit tickets, checks, and bank statements.
OPENING A CHECKING ACCOUNT
To open a checking account, each person authorized to sign checks must complete and 
sign a signature card (Figure 7-1). The bank uses this card to verify the depositor’s 
LO1 Describe how to open 
and use a checking 
account.
Cash is an asset that is quite familiar and important to all of us. We generally think of cash as the 
currency and coins in our pockets and the money we have in our checking accounts. To a business, 
cash also includes checks received from customers, money orders, and bank cashier’s checks.
 Because it plays such a central role in operating a business, cash must be carefully managed 
and controlled. A business should have a system of internal control—a set of policies and pro-
cedures designed to ensure proper accounting for transactions. For good internal control of cash 
transactions, all cash received should be deposited daily in a bank. All disbursements, except for 
payments from petty cash, should be made by check.

signature on any banking transactions. The taxpayer identification number (TIN) is 
the depositor’s social security number or employer identification number (EIN). This 
number is shown on the card to identify the depositor for income tax purposes. An 
EIN can be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service.
MAKING DEPOSITS
A deposit ticket (Figure 7-2) is a form showing a detailed listing of items being depos-
ited. Currency, coins, and checks are listed separately. Each check should be identified 
by its ABA (American Bankers Association) Number. This number is the small frac-
tion printed in the upper right-hand corner of each check (see Figure 7-5 on page 233). 
Part of this number also appears in magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) code 
on the lower left side of the front of each check. The code is used to sort and route 
checks throughout the U.S. banking system. Normally, only the numerator of the frac-
tion is used in identifying checks on the deposit ticket.
The depositor delivers or mails the deposit ticket and all items being deposited to 
the bank. The bank then gives or mails a receipt to the depositor. The deposit also can 
be made after business hours by using the night depository provided by most banks. 
The deposit is put in a locked bag, which is placed in a secure drawer or chute at the 
bank, for processing the following morning.
ENDORSEMENTS
Each check being deposited must be endorsed by the depositor. The endorsement con-
sists of stamping or writing the depositor’s name and sometimes other information on 
the back of the check, in the space provided near the left end. There are two basic types 
of endorsements.
1.  Blank endorsement––the depositor simply signs the back of the check. This 
makes the check payable to any bearer.
2.  Restrictive endorsement––the depositor adds words such as “For deposit,” “Pay 
to any bank,” or “Pay to Daryl Beck only” to restrict the payment of the check.
Businesses commonly use a rubber stamp to endorse checks for deposit. The check 
shown in Figure 7-3 has been stamped with a restrictive endorsement.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
AUTOMATED TELLER MACHINES
Most banks now make automated teller machines (ATMs) available at all times to 
depositors for making deposits or withdrawals. Each depositor has a plastic card 
(Figure 7-4) and a personal identification number (PIN). The depositor inserts the card, 
keys in the PIN, indicates whether the transaction is a withdrawal or a deposit, and 
enters the amount. The machine has a drawer or door for the withdrawal or deposit.
Most ATMs are now on a system such as Cirrus that allows noncustomers to use 
other ATMs in both the United States and foreign countries. There are also “cash 
machines” that supply only cash and do not take deposits. These are often found at 
airports and convenience stores.
It is important for the depositor to keep an accounting record of ATM withdraw-
als and deposits. This is done on the check stub or register described in the following 
section, and with an appropriate journal entry.
FIGURE 7-3 Restrictive Endorsement
Postage stamps can be 
purchased at some ATMs. 
For deposits, some ATMs 
can provide an image of any 
checks being deposited.

WRITING CHECKS
A check is a document ordering a bank to pay cash from a depositor’s account. There 
are three parties to every check.
1. Drawer––the depositor who orders the bank to pay the cash.
2. Drawee––the bank on which the check is drawn.
3. Payee––the person being paid the cash.
Checks used by businesses are usually bound in the form of a book. In some check-
books, each check is attached to a check stub (Figure 7-5) that contains space to record 
all relevant information about the check. Other checkbooks are accompanied by a small 
register book in which the relevant information is noted. If a financial computer soft-
ware package is used, both the check and the register can be prepared electronically.
Note that the check stubs in Figure 7-5 contain space to record amounts depos-
ited. It generally is a good idea also to indicate the date of the deposit, as shown on 
check stub No. 108.
Use the following three steps in preparing a check:
STEP 1 Complete the check stub or register.
STEP 2 Enter the date, payee name, and amount on the check.
STEP 3 Sign the check.
Payee

Drawer
FIGURE 7-5 Checks and Check Stubs
It is sometimes necessary 
to void a check. Proper 
procedures for doing so 
are to tear off or deface the 
signature box and to file the 
voided check numerically 
with the canceled checks.

FIGURE 7-6 Bank Statement
Beginning balance

An amount added
An amount subtracted
The check stub is completed first so that the drawer retains a record of each check issued. 
This information is needed to determine the proper journal entry for the transaction.
The payee name is entered on the first long line on the check, followed by the 
amount in figures. The amount in words is then entered on the second long line. If the 
amount in figures does not agree with the amount in words, the bank usually contacts 
the drawer for the correct amount or returns the check unpaid.
The most critical point in preparing a check is signing it, and this should be done 
last. The signature authorizes the bank to pay cash from the drawer’s account. The 
check signer should make sure that all other aspects of the check are correct before 
signing it.
BANK STATEMENT
A statement of account issued by a bank to each depositor once a month is called a 
bank statement. Figure 7-6 is a bank statement for a checking account. The statement 
shows the following:
1. The balance at the beginning of the period.
2. Deposits and other amounts added during the period.
3. Checks and other amounts subtracted during the period.
4. The balance at the end of the period.
The payee and amount 
 written in words should 
be followed by something, 
such as a line, to make it 
difficult to alter the payee or 
the amount.
LEARNING KEY
The check should not be signed until 
the check signer has verified that all 
aspects of the check are correct.

With the bank statement, the bank normally sends the following to the 
depositor:
1.  Canceled checks––the depositor’s checks paid by the bank during the period. 
The bank may send the checks themselves, “imaged” sheets showing only the 
faces of the checks, or simply a listing of the checks on the bank statement.
2. Any other forms representing items added to or subtracted from the account.
It is increasingly common 
for banks to return only a 
listing of checks with the 
bank statement. A check 
“image” can be obtained by 
making a special request to 
the bank.

RECONCILING THE BANK STATEMENT
On any given day, the balance in the cash account on the depositor’s books (the book 
balance) is unlikely to be the same as that on the bank’s books (the bank balance). This 
difference can be due to errors, but it usually is caused by timing. Transactions gener-
ally are recorded by the business at a time that is different from when the bank records 
them.
DEPOSITS
Suppose there are cash receipts of $600 on April 30. These cash receipts would be 
recorded on the depositor’s books on April 30, and a deposit of $600 would be sent 
to the bank. The deposit would not reach the bank, however, until at least the follow-
ing day, May 1. This timing difference in recording the $600 of cash receipts is illus-
trated in Figure 7-7. Notice that on April 30, the balances in the depositor’s books and 
in the bank’s books would be different.

CASH PAYMENTS
Similar timing differences occur with cash payments. Suppose a check for $350 is writ-
ten on April 30. This cash payment would be recorded on the depositor’s books on 
April 30 and the check mailed to the payee. The check probably would not be received 
by the payee until May 3. If the payee deposited the check promptly, it still would not 
clear the bank until May 4. This timing difference in recording the $350 cash payment 
is illustrated in Figure 7-8. Notice once again that on April 30, the balances in the 
depositor’s books and in the bank’s books would be different.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
REASONS FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BANK 
AND BOOK BALANCES
When the bank statement is received, the depositor examines the records to identify 
the items that explain the difference between the book and bank balances. This process 
of bringing the book and bank balances into agreement is called preparing a bank 
reconciliation.
The most common reasons for differences between the book and bank balances 
are the following:
1.  Deposits in transit. Deposits that have not reached or been recorded by the bank 
before the statement is prepared.
2.  Outstanding checks. Checks issued that have not been presented to the bank for 
payment before the statement is prepared.
3. Service charges. Bank charges for services such as check printing and processing.
4.  Collections. Collections of promissory notes or charge accounts made by the 
bank on behalf of the depositor.
5.  Not sufficient funds (NSF) checks. Checks deposited by the depositor that are 
not paid because the drawer did not have sufficient funds.
6. Errors. Errors made by the bank or the depositor in recording cash transactions.
STEPS IN PREPARING THE BANK 
RECONCILIATION
Use the following three steps in preparing the bank reconciliation:
STEP 1 Identify deposits in transit and any related errors.
STEP 2 Identify outstanding checks and any related errors.
STEP 3 Identify additional reconciling items.
Deposits in Transit and Related Errors
Follow these steps:
STEP 1  Compare deposits listed on the bank statement with deposits in transit on 
last month’s bank reconciliation. All of last month’s deposits in transit 
should appear on the current month’s bank statement.
STEP 2  Compare the remaining deposits on the bank statement with deposits listed in 
the accounting records. Any deposits listed in the accounting records but not on 
the bank statement are deposits in transit on the current bank reconciliation.

Chapter 7          Accounting for Cash 
237
STEP 3  Compare the individual deposit amounts on the bank statement and in the 
accounting records. If they differ, the error needs to be corrected.
Outstanding Checks and Related Errors
Follow these steps:
STEP 1  Compare canceled checks with the bank statement and the accounting 
records. If the amounts differ, the error needs to be corrected.
STEP 2  As each canceled check is compared with the accounting records, place a 
check mark on the check stub or other accounting record to indicate that the 
check has cleared.
STEP 3  Any checks written that have not been checked off represent outstanding 
checks on the bank reconciliation. This includes outstanding checks from 
last month’s bank reconciliation that have not yet cleared.
Additional Reconciling Items
Compare any additions and deductions on the bank statement that are not deposits or 
checks with the accounting records. Items that the bank adds to the account are called 
credit memos. Items that the bank deducts from the account are called debit memos. 
Remember that a depositor’s account is a liability to the bank. Thus, a credit memo 
increases this liability; a debit memo reduces the liability. Any of these items not appear-
ing in the accounting records represent additional items on the bank reconciliation.
ILLUSTRATION OF A BANK RECONCILIATION
A general format for the bank reconciliation is shown in Figure 7-9. Not every item 
shown in this illustration would be in every bank reconciliation, but this format is 
helpful in determining where to put items. A bank reconciliation form also can be 
found on the back of most bank statements. Some banks also include a reconciliation 
form on their Web site.
Some banks pay interest on 
checking account balances. 
This reconciling item would 
be handled in the same 
manner as a bank credit 
memo.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
To illustrate the preparation of a bank reconciliation, we will use the Maple 
Consulting bank statement shown in Figure 7-6. That statement shows a balance of 
$1,748.09 as of November 21. The balance in Maple’s check stubs and general ledger 
cash account is $2,393.23. The three steps described on page 236 were used to identify 
the following items, and the reconciliation in Figure 7-10 was prepared.
1.  A deposit of $637.02 recorded on November 21 had not been received by the 
bank. Maple has received the funds but the amount has not yet been counted by 
the bank. This deposit in transit is added to the bank statement balance.
2.  Check numbers 219, 224, and 227 are outstanding. The funds have been dis-
bursed by Maple but have not yet been paid out by the bank. The amount of 
these outstanding checks is subtracted from the bank statement balance.
3.  Check number 214 was written for $18.98 but was entered on the check stub 
and on the books as $19.88. This $0.90 error is added to the book balance 
because $0.90 too much had been deducted from the book balance.
4.  Maple made an ATM withdrawal of $100.00 on November 13 for personal use 
but did not record the withdrawal on the books. The bank has reduced Maple’s 
balance by this amount. Thus, this amount is deducted from the book balance.
5.  The bank returned an NSF check of $200.00. This was a check received by 
Maple from a customer. The bank has reduced Maple’s balance by $200.00, but 
Maple has not yet recorded it. This amount is deducted from the book balance.
6.  The bank service charge was $1.80. The bank has reduced Maple’s balance by 
this amount, but Maple has not yet recorded it. This amount is deducted from 
the book balance.

JOURNAL ENTRIES
Only two kinds of items appearing on a bank reconciliation require journal entries.
1. Errors in the depositor’s books.
2. Bank additions and deductions that do not already appear in the books.
LEARNING KEY
Journal entries are needed to 
correct errors in the books and 
to record bank additions and 
deductions that are not in the 
books.
Note the four items in the lower portion of the bank reconciliation in Figure 7-10. 
A journal entry always is required for each item in this book balance portion of the 
bank reconciliation. The four journal entries for Maple Consulting are shown below, 
using entry numbers matching those noted in Figure 7-10.
The $0.90 item is an error in the accounting records that occurred when the 
check amount was incorrectly entered. Assume the $18.98 was in payment of an 
account payable which had been incorrectly debited for $19.88. The entry to cor-
rect this error is as follows:

The $100.00 ATM withdrawal has been deducted from Maple’s account by the 
bank. Maple has not yet recorded the withdrawal. Maple withdrew the funds for 
personal use, so the following journal entry is required:

The $200.00 NSF check is a deduction by the bank for a check deposited by 
Maple that proved to be worthless. This amount must be deducted from the book 
balance. Assuming the $200.00 was received from a customer on account, the follow-
ing journal entry is required:

ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER
Electronic funds transfer (EFT) uses a computer rather than paper checks to complete 
transactions with the bank. This technique is being used increasingly today. Applications 
of EFT include payrolls, social security payments, retail purchases, mortgage pay-
ments, and the ATM transactions described earlier in the chapter.
Heavy use of EFT can present a challenge in preparing bank reconciliations. Many 
of the documents handled in a purely manual environment disappear when EFT is 
used. Bank accounts are just one of many areas where computers require accountants 
to think in new ways. Regardless of what system is used, the key point to remember 
is that the accounting records must be correctly updated.
Figure 7-11 contains a detailed list of items that require journal entries.

Fraud—A Real Threat to Small Business
Every two years, the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners 
(ACFE) surveys its members on the occupational fraud they 
have investigated during the preceding two years. The most 
recent survey showed that 40% of the frauds occurred in 
private companies. In addition, the median loss suffered by 
small businesses was $200,000. The most commonly cited 
factor that allowed the fraud to occur was a lack of adequate 
internal control. And 85% of the asset misappropriation cases 
involved theft or misuse of cash.
These survey findings show the importance of the kinds of 
internal controls over cash described in this chapter and the 
appendix.

THE PETTY CASH FUND
For good control over cash, payments generally should be made by check. 
Unfortunately, payments of very small amounts by check can be both inconvenient 
and inefficient. For example, the time and cost required to write a check for $0.70 to 
mail a letter might be greater than the cost of the postage. Therefore, businesses cus-
tomarily establish a petty cash fund to pay for small items with cash. “Petty” means 
small, and both the amount of the fund and the maximum amount of any bill that can 
be paid from the fund are small.
ESTABLISHING A PETTY CASH FUND
To establish a petty cash fund, a check is written to the petty cash custodian for the 
amount to be set aside in the fund. The amount may be $50.00, $100.00, $200.00, or 
any amount considered necessary. The journal entry to establish a petty cash fund of 
$100.00 would be as follows:

Petty Cash is an asset that is listed immediately below Cash on the balance sheet.
The custodian cashes the check and places the money in a petty cash box. For 
good control, the custodian should be the only person authorized to make payments 
from the fund. The custodian should be able to account for the full amount of the fund 
at any time.
MAKING PAYMENTS FROM A PETTY CASH FUND
A receipt called a petty cash voucher (Figure 7-12) should be prepared for every pay-
ment from the fund. The voucher shows the name of the payee, the purpose of the 
payment, and the account to be charged for the payment. Each voucher should be 
signed by the custodian and by the person receiving the cash. The vouchers should be 
numbered consecutively so that all vouchers can be accounted for.

Accounting for Cash and Payroll
PETTY CASH PAYMENTS RECORD
When a petty cash fund is maintained, a formal record is often kept of all payments 
from the fund. The petty cash payments record (Figure 7-13) is a special multi-column 
record that supplements the regular accounting records. It is not a journal. The head-
ings of the Distribution of Payments columns may vary, depending upon the types of 
expenditures.
The petty cash payments record of Maple Consulting is shown in Figure 7-13. 
A narrative of the petty cash transactions shown in Figure 7-13 is as follows:
Dec. 1  Maple issued a check for $200.00 payable to Tina Blank, Petty Cash 
Custodian. Blank cashed the check and placed the money in a secure cash 
box.
    A notation of the amount received is made in the Description column of the 
petty cash payments record. In addition, this transaction is entered in the journal 
as follows:

REPLENISHING THE PETTY CASH FUND
The petty cash fund should be replenished whenever the fund runs low and at the end 
of each accounting period, so that the accounts are brought up to date. The amount 
columns of the petty cash payments record are totaled to verify that the total of the 
Total Amount column equals the total of the Distribution columns. The amount col-
umns are then ruled as shown in Figure 7-13.

The information in the petty cash payments record is then used to replenish the 
petty cash fund. On December 31, a check for $178.80 is issued to the petty cash

Note two important aspects of the functioning of a petty cash fund.
1.  Once the fund is established by debiting Petty Cash and crediting Cash, no 
further entries are made to Petty Cash. Notice in the journal entry to replenish 
the fund that the debits are to appropriate expense accounts and the credit is 
to Cash. Only if the amount of the fund itself is being changed would there 
be a debit or credit to Petty Cash.
2.  The petty cash payments record is strictly a supplement to the regular account-
ing records. Because it is not a journal, no posting is done from this record. 
A separate entry must be made in the journal to replenish the fund and update 
the expense accounts.
LEARNING KEY
Once the petty cash fund is 
established, an entry is made to 
Petty Cash only if the amount of 
the fund is being changed.

THE CHANGE FUND AND CASH SHORT AND OVER
 Businesses generally must be able to make change when customers use cash to pay for 
goods or services received. To do so, generally it is a good idea to establish a change 
fund. A change fund is a supply of currency and coins kept in a cash register or cash 
drawer for use in handling cash sales.
ESTABLISHING AND OPERATING THE CHANGE FUND
The journal entries for establishing and maintaining a change fund are very similar to 
the ones just used for petty cash. To establish a change fund of $200.00 on June 1, the 
following entry would be made:
LO4 Establish a change 
fund and use the 
cash short and over 
account.

At the end of the day, cash received during the day is deposited, but the change fund 
is held back for use the following business day. For example, if cash of $1,250.00 was 
received on June 3 for services provided, the cash drawer would contain $1,450.00, as 
follows:
Change fund 
$   200.00
Cash sales 
1,250.00
Total cash on hand 
$1,450.00
The $1,250 would be deposited in the bank, and the following journal entry would be 
made:
Notice the additional similarity between the change fund and the petty cash fund. 
Once the change fund is established by a debit to Change Fund and a credit to Cash, 
no further entries are made to the change fund. Only if the amount of the change fund 
itself is being changed would there be a debit or credit to Change Fund.
CASH SHORT AND OVER
An unavoidable part of the change-making process is that errors can occur. It is 
important to know whether such errors have occurred and how to account for 
them.
Businesses commonly use cash registers with tapes that accumulate a record of the 
day’s receipts. The amount of cash according to the tapes plus the amount of the 
change fund can be compared with the amount of cash in the register to determine any 
error. For example, assume a cash shortage is identified for June 19.
Change fund 
$    200.00
Receipts per register tapes 
963.00
Total 
$1,163.00
Cash count 
1,161.00
 Cash shortage 
$        2.00
Similarly, assume a cash overage is identified for June 20.

Receipts per register tapes

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
We account for such errors by using an account called Cash Short and Over. 
In T account form, Cash Short and Over appears as follows:
Cash Short and Over
Shortage (Expense)
Overage (Revenue)
The register tapes on June 19 showed receipts of $963.00 and the change fund 
was $200.00, but only $1,161.00 in cash was counted. The journal entry on June 19 
to record the revenues and cash shortage (remember that we hold back the change 
fund) would be as follows:
18
June
19
Cash
9 6 1 00

Cash Short and Over
2 00

20
    Service Fees

21
        Record service fees and cash shortage
21
The entry on June 20 to record the revenues and cash overage (holding back the 
change fund) would be as follows:
23
June
20
Cash
8 1 5 00

The cash short and over account is used to accumulate cash shortages and over-
ages throughout the accounting period. At the end of the period, a debit balance in the 
account (a net shortage) is treated as an expense. A credit balance in the account (a net 
overage) is treated as revenue.

DEMONSTRATION PROBLEM
Jason Kuhn’s check stubs indicated a balance of $4,565.12 for Kuhn’s Wilderness Outfitters on March 31. This 
included a record of a deposit of $926.10 mailed to the bank on March 30, but not credited to Kuhn’s account 
until April 1. In addition, the following checks were outstanding on March 31:
No. 462 
$524.26
No. 465 
$213.41
No. 473 
$543.58
No. 476 
$351.38
No. 477

LO2  Prepare a bank reconciliation and 
related journal entries.
The most common reasons for differences between the book 
and bank cash balances are as follows:
 
1. Deposits in transit
 
2. Outstanding checks
 
3. Bank service charges
 
4. Bank collections for the depositor
 
5. NSF checks
 
6. Errors by the bank or the depositor
Three steps to follow in preparing a bank reconciliation are as 
follows:
 
1. Identify deposits in transit and any related errors.
 
2. Identify outstanding checks and any related errors.
 
3. Identify additional reconciling items.
Only two kinds of items on a bank reconciliation require jour-
nal entries.
 
1. Errors in the depositor’s books.
 
2.  Bank additions and deductions that do not already 
appear in the books.
LO3  Establish and use a petty cash fund.
Two important aspects of the functioning of a petty cash fund 
are as follows:
 
1.  Once the fund is established, subsequent entries do not 
affect the petty cash account balance, unless the size of 
the fund itself is being changed.
 
2.  The petty cash payments record is supplemental to the 
regular accounting records. No posting is done from 
this record.
LO4  Establish a change fund and use the 
cash short and over account.
A change fund is established by debiting Change Fund and 
crediting Cash. Cash shortages and overages are accounted for 
using the cash short and over account. A debit balance in this 
account represents expense; a credit balance represents revenue.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
The bank statement showed a balance of $5,419.00 as of March 31. The bank state-
ment included a service charge of $4.10 with the date of March 29. In matching the 
canceled checks and record of deposits with the stubs, it was discovered that Check 
No. 456, a payment on account to Office Suppliers, Inc., for $39.00 was erroneously 
recorded on the stub as $93.00. This caused the bank balance on that stub and those 
following to be $54.00 too small. It was also discovered that an ATM withdrawal of 
$100.00 for personal use was not recorded on the books.
Kuhn maintains a $200.00 petty cash fund. His petty cash payments record 
showed the following totals at the end of March of the current year:
Automobile expense 
$ 32.40
Postage expense 
27.50
Charitable contributions expense 
35.00
Telephone expense 
6.20
Travel and entertainment expense 
38.60
Miscellaneous expense 
17.75

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
The current month’s bank statement for your account arrives in the mail. In review-
ing the statement, you notice a deposit listed for $400.00 that you did not make. It 
has been credited in error to your account.
Discuss whether you have an ethical or legal obligation to inform the bank of the 
error. What action should you take?
ETHICS CASE
Ben Thomas works as a teller for First National Bank. When he arrived at work 
on Friday, the branch manager, Frank Mills, asked him to get his cash drawer out 
early because the head teller, Naomi Ray, was conducting a surprise cash count for 
all the tellers. Surprise cash counts are usually done four or five times a year by the 
branch manager or the head teller and once or twice a year by internal auditors. 
Ben’s drawer was $100.00 short and his reconciliation tape showed that he was in 
balance on Thursday night. Naomi asked Ben for an explanation, and Ben immedi-
ately took $100.00 out of his pocket and handed it to her. He went on to explain he 
needed the cash to buy prescriptions for his son and pay for groceries and intended 
to put the $100.00 back in his cash drawer on Monday, which was pay day. He also 
told Naomi that this was the first time he had ever “borrowed” money from his cash 
drawer and that he would never do it again.
1. What are the ethical considerations in this case from both Ben’s and Naomi’s 
 perspectives?
2. What options does Naomi have to address this problem?
3. Assume Naomi chooses to inform the branch manager. Write a short incident 
report describing the findings.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
In Chapter 7, we introduced the concept of 
internal control and provided some exam-
ples of good internal control over cash 
transactions. Here, we examine internal 
control in greater depth.
We do the following:
 Explain why internal control has 
1. 
achieved greater importance today.
 Identify the key components of inter-
2. 
nal control.
 Give examples of internal control over 
3. 
cash receipts.
 Describe internal control of cash pay-
4. 
ments using a voucher system.
IMPORTANCE OF INTERNAL CONTROL
To be successful, management must have adequate control of the operations of the 
business. For example, the records of business activities must be reliable and timely, so 
that management has the information it needs to take necessary actions. The assets of 
the business must be known and protected. Employees must follow the rules and pro-
cedures defined by management. Accurate information must be available to report to 
owners, lenders, and regulatory bodies, such as the IRS. Without good internal control, 
it simply would not be possible to effectively and efficiently run a business.
The importance of strong internal control for managing a business has been 
known for years. But in 2002, the importance of internal control was raised to a whole 
new level. In July 2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). SOX applies 
to all publicly held companies––companies whose stock is traded on the major stock 
exchanges. Section 404 of SOX requires these companies to report annually on the 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. For decades, these corpora-
tions have been required to provide audited financial statements. Now, they must also 
report on the quality of their internal control system. Figure 7A-1 provides an example 
of management’s Section 404 report for Microsoft.
One of the interesting effects of SOX is how widely its rules are being felt. 
Officially, SOX applies to all publicly held companies and their external auditors. But 
SOX is causing many other companies and managements to look closely at the quality 
of their internal controls. The logic is simple: if internal controls are so important for 
publicly held companies, they probably deserve attention in other companies as well. 
Clearly, internal controls are a hot topic today.

KEY COMPONENTS OF INTERNAL CONTROL
Internal control is really important. So what exactly do we mean by internal control? 
Both the concept and attempts to define it have existed for many years. For our pur-
poses, the following is a good definition:
Internal control is a system developed by a company to provide reasonable assurance 
of achieving (1) effective and efficient operations, (2) reliable financial reporting, and 
(3) compliance with laws and regulations.
Several internal control frameworks have been developed that are consistent with this 
definition. The most widely accepted framework in the United States contains the fol-
lowing five components:
Control environment
• 
Risk assessment
• 
Control activities
• 
Information and communication system
• 
 Monitoring processes
• 
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
The control environment is the policies, procedures, and attitudes of the top manage-
ment and owners of the business. It is often referred to as the “tone at the top.” It includes 
the organization structure, management’s philosophy and operating style, integrity and 
ethical values, and commitment to competent, trustworthy employees. The control envi-
ronment provides the foundation for all other components of internal control.
LO2 Define internal control 
and describe its key 
components.
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management [of Microsoft] is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over ﬁnancial reporting for the company. Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our ﬁnancial reporting for external purposes
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal 
control over ﬁnancial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reﬂect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for
preparation of our ﬁnancial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures 
of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable 
assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a 
material effect on our ﬁnancial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is not intended to provide absolute 
assurance that a misstatement of our ﬁnancial statements would be prevented or detected.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over ﬁnancial 
reporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management 
concluded that the company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2008.
There were no changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the quarter ended June 30,
2008 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
ﬁnancial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of
June 30, 2008; their report follows.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
RISK ASSESSMENT
Risk assessment is management’s process for identifying, analyzing, and responding to 
its business risks. All businesses face various and changing risks from both external 
and internal sources. These risks include error and fraud. As part of the risk assessment 
component of internal control, management must deal with these risks. For example, 
if a business sells products like computers that are affected by rapid technology 
changes, its marketing and inventory plans should carefully guard against obsolete 
inventory. If a business has high employee turnover, its employee screening and train-
ing programs should be very thorough and up to date. If a business is growing rapidly, 
it should regularly review its internal controls to see that they fit the size and activities 
of the business.
CONTROL ACTIVITIES
Control activities are the policies and procedures established to help management meet 
its control objectives. Control activities can be classified in various ways. Four types 
of control activities are particularly important for our purposes.
1. Segregation of duties
2. Authorization procedures and related responsibilities
3. Adequate documents and records
4. Protection of assets and records
 
Segregation of duties means that:
 
1.  Different employees should be responsible for different parts of a transac-
tion; and
 
2.  Employees who account for transactions should not also have custody of 
the assets.
For example, one employee should be responsible for ordering goods and another 
employee should be responsible for issuing the check to pay for them. One employee 
should be responsible for recording the purchase of goods and another employee 
should be responsible for receiving and placing the goods in inventory. This segrega-
tion of duties provides a built-in check by one employee on another. One employee 
cannot obtain goods for personal use without being caught by another employee.
Authorization procedures and related responsibilities means that every business 
activity should be properly authorized. In addition, it should be possible to identify 
who is responsible for every activity that has occurred. For example, to acquire new 
equipment, a signed document should authorize the purchase. After the purchase is 
made, this signed document shows who is responsible for the action.
Adequate documents and records means that accounting documents and records 
should be used so that all business transactions are recorded. For example, every pur-
chase that occurs should be supported by a document. These documents should be:
prenumbered,
• 
used in sequence, and
• 
subsequently accounted for.
• 
In this way, the business can be sure that it has made a record of each transaction.
Protection of assets and records means that assets and records should be physi-
cally and logically protected. For assets, this generally means physical protection. Some 
examples are vaults for cash, securities and precious gems, or secure storage rooms 
for inventory. For records, this can mean storing journals, ledgers, and key documents

in physically secure locations. In computerized systems, both physical and logical 
 protection are needed. Passwords are a common form of logical protection of data files 
and processing programs.
INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION 
SYSTEM
The information and communication system is the set of procedures, processes, and 
records used to initiate, process, record, and report the business’s transactions. In addi-
tion, the system accounts for the related assets and liabilities. Typically, the system has 
several subcomponents for different business processes, such as:
sales,
• 
cash receipts,
• 
purchases, and
• 
cash payments.
• 
The journals and ledgers we learned to use in the previous chapters would be part of 
an information and communication system.
MONITORING PROCESSES
Monitoring processes are the methods used by management to determine that controls 
are operating properly, and that the controls are modified in response to changes in 
assessed risks. Figure 7A-2 provides some examples of such processes. Monitoring can 
be part of the ongoing activities of the business or a separate process. One ongoing 
activity could be comparisons of financial reports with expectations. If financial reports 
differ from expectations, it could indicate internal control failures. Follow-up on cus-
tomer complaints regarding account balances might also uncover internal control 
weaknesses. The most common form of separate process is the work of the internal 
audit department. Internal auditors evaluate the design of the internal control system 
in light of the business risks. They also perform specific tests to determine whether 
internal controls are operating properly. If a business is not large enough to have an 
internal audit department, these responsibilities must be assumed by top management.
INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER CASH RECEIPTS
The main purposes of internal controls over cash receipts are to make sure that
all cash received by the business is recorded in the accounts, and
• 
the cash is promptly deposited in the business bank account.
• 
The exact form of some of these controls will vary depending on whether the cash is 
received directly from customers for sales, or is received by mail as a collection on 
account. Some of the key internal controls are shown in Figure 7A-3 and described in 
the following paragraphs.

internal controls over 
cash receipts.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
If cash is received directly from customers, the use of a cash register or terminal 
with a printed receipt is essential. Only authorized employees should be allowed to 
operate the register. The register should generate an internal record of all transactions 
entered, including a total of cash receipts. This amount should be reconciled with the 
actual cash (and checks) in the register drawer. Any differences greater than a small 
amount to allow for errors in making change should be investigated. All cash receipts 
should be deposited daily in the business bank account. The total deposited and the 
total cash receipts according to the register should be reconciled and any differences 
investigated.
If cash is received as collections on account, the mail room should be supervised 
and employees who handle the cash (checks) should have no access to the accounting 
records. One reason for separating the handling of cash from the accounting records 
is to prevent lapping. Lapping means stealing cash received on account from one cus-
tomer and hiding the theft by applying the cash received on account from another 
customer to the first customer’s account. For example, assume customer A sends a 
check for $500 as a payment on account and that the employee keeps the $500 for 
him/herself. This causes customer A’s account to be in error by $500. So when cus-
tomer B makes a $500 payment on account, the employee applies this cash receipt to 
customer A’s account. The dishonest employee must continue lapping the accounts 
receivable in this manner to continue to conceal the theft.
When the mail is opened, a remittance list should be prepared showing all amounts 
received and from whom they are received. Checks should be immediately endorsed 
“For deposit” to the business bank account.
The remittance list is sent to the accounting department for use in recording the 
collections in the journal and ledgers. The cash is sent to the cash receipts department to 
deposit in the business bank account. The total of the remittance list and the amount of 
the bank deposit should be independently verified and any differences investigated.
An additional internal control common to both systems described above is the 
independent monthly preparation of a bank reconciliation. Procedures for preparing 
the bank reconciliation are described in Chapter 7. The cash receipts, cash payments,

and beginning and ending balances per bank and per books must be reconciled. The 
reconciliation should be prepared by employees who have no access to cash. Any dif-
ferences should be investigated.
Many businesses have multiple bank accounts and transfer cash among them. 
When there are multiple bank accounts, it is possible to overstate the cash balance by 
engaging in kiting. Kiting consists of recording a transfer of cash into one bank 
account in the current period, but not recording the transfer out of another bank 
account until the following period. For example, assume a $1,000 check is written on 
bank account A on June 30, but not recorded as a cash payment until July 1. This 
check is deposited in bank account B and recorded as a cash receipt on June 30. By 
recording the transaction in this manner, the cash balance in both bank accounts 
includes the $1,000 at June 30. The total cash balance is thus overstated by $1,000 on 
June 30.
One of the reasons internal controls over cash are so important is that they help 
businesses manage their cash resources. Naturally, it is important to plan to have suf-
ficient cash to meet current obligations. But it is also important not to allow too much 
cash to lie idle. Management should carefully monitor and plan for its cash needs. 
Strong internal controls help with this process.
INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER CASH PAYMENTS
The main purpose of internal controls over cash payments is to make sure cash is paid 
only for goods and services received by the business, consistent with its best interests. 
To achieve this objective, controls are needed from the beginning of the process of 
acquiring goods and services through the payment of cash for those goods and ser-
vices. An effective way to do so is with a voucher system.
VOUCHER SYSTEM
The three control activities described above can be combined to control cash payments 
by using a voucher system. A voucher system is a control technique that requires every 
acquisition and subsequent payment to be supported by an approved voucher. A 
voucher is a document which shows that an acquisition is proper and that payment is 
authorized.
THE PURCHASING PROCESS
Figure 7A-4 is a simplified illustration of how the purchasing portion of a voucher 
system operates. An authorized person or department prepares a purchase requisition 
to indicate the need for goods. The purchasing department reviews and approves the 
purchase requisition and prepares a purchase order to send to the supplier. When the 
goods are received, a receiving report is prepared. A copy of each of these documents 
is sent to the vouchers payable section in the accounting department.
When the purchase invoice arrives, it is compared with the purchase requisition, 
purchase order, and receiving report. If the purchase invoice is
for the goods ordered (purchase requisition and purchase order),
• 
at the correct price (purchase order),
• 
and for the correct quantity (receiving report),
• 
then a voucher like the one in Figure 7A-5 on page 273 is prepared. This is the first 
key control provided by the voucher system. If any aspect of the purchase is improper, 
it will be caught when the voucher is prepared.
LO4 Describe selected 
internal controls over 
cash payments and 
the use of a voucher 
system.

LEARNING KEY
The voucher system contains ele-
ments of internal control such as 
segregation of duties, authoriza-
tion to order the goods and pre-
pare the voucher, and accounting 
procedures that require prenum-
bering and accounting for the 
supporting documents.
The front of the voucher usually shows the voucher number, date, supplier, and 
what was purchased. The back indicates the accounts to be debited and the payment 
date, check number, and amount.
After the voucher is prepared and approved, it is entered in a special journal called 
a voucher register. A voucher register is used to record purchases of all types of assets 
and services.
After the voucher is entered in the voucher register, the voucher and supporting 
documents (purchase requisition, purchase order, receiving report, and purchase 
invoice) are stapled together. This “voucher packet” is then filed in an unpaid vouchers 
file, normally by due date. Alternatively, vouchers can be filed by supplier name. Filing 
by due date is preferred because this helps management plan for cash needs. It also 
helps ensure that vouchers are paid on the due date and cash discounts are taken.
The completed voucher provides the basis for paying the supplier’s invoice on the 
due date. This is the second key control provided by the voucher system. No payment 
may be made without an approved voucher.
Notice how three of the four control activities that are part of an internal control 
system can be seen in this system.
Duties are segregated
• 
 because different employees order, receive, and record the 
purchases.
Authorization
• 
 is required to order the goods and to prepare the voucher.
The 
• 
documents and records include purchase requisitions, purchase orders, receiv-
ing reports, and vouchers that are prenumbered and accounted for. This means 
that every recorded purchase is supported by the following five documents:
 
1. Voucher
 
2. Purchase invoice
 
3. Receiving report
 
4. Purchase order
 
5. Purchase requisition
This provides management with strong assurance that purchasing activities are prop-
erly controlled.

THE PAYMENT PROCESS
Figure 7A-6 on page 274 is a simplified illustration of the payment process when a 
voucher system is used. On the due date, the voucher is pulled from the unpaid vouch-
ers file. The voucher is given to the person responsible for preparing and signing checks 
(the cashier in this illustration). The cashier reviews each voucher and supporting 
documents to see that the expenditure is proper. The cashier then prepares and signs 
the check and sends it to the supplier. It is important for internal control that no check 
be prepared without a supporting voucher and that the check be mailed as soon as it 
is signed.
Ordinary checks may be used to make payments, but under the voucher system, 
voucher checks often are used. A voucher check is a check with space for entering data 
about the voucher being paid. Figure 7A-7 on page 274 shows a voucher check used 
to pay Voucher No. 111 (Figure 7A-5).
The voucher check has two parts:
1. The check itself, which is similar to an ordinary check, and
2. An attached statement, which indicates the invoice being paid and any deductions.
In addition, the voucher check stub identifies the voucher number being paid.
LEARNING KEY
For good internal control of cash 
payments, it is important for the 
check to be mailed as soon as it 
is signed.

After the voucher has been paid, the cashier completes the “Payment” information 
and approval on the back of the voucher. The voucher and supporting documents are 
then canceled to indicate payment. The canceling can be done with a rubber stamp, by 
perforating, or by simply writing “paid” on all relevant documents. This prevents a 
voucher from being processed again to create a duplicate payment. The canceled 
voucher and supporting documents are then returned to the vouchers payable section. 
The canceled voucher is used to record the payment of the voucher in the voucher 
register. The voucher and supporting documents are then filed either numerically or by 
supplier in a paid vouchers file. In either case, the numerical sequence should be 
accounted for to identify possible missing or duplicate vouchers.
A copy of the check is used to enter the payment in a check register. A check reg-
ister is a special journal used to record all checks written in a voucher system. This 
completes the payment process using the voucher system.
This appendix provides an introduction to internal control concepts and proce-
dures. We have focused on cash here, but internal controls are important in every area 
of the business. Internal controls can be a very complicated subject, particularly in 
dealing with computerized operations. More thorough analysis of internal controls is 
a subject for a more advanced text.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES Key Points to Remember
LO1  Explain the importance of 
internal control.
Internal controls help assure management that it has reliable records 
to run the business and prepare needed reports. In addition, SOX 
requires publicly held companies to report annually on the quality of 
their internal control system.
LO2  Define internal control and 
describe its key components.
Internal control is a system developed by a company to provide 
reasonable assurance of achieving (1) effective and efficient opera-
tions, (2) reliable financial reporting, and (3) compliance with 
laws and regulations. The key components are as follows:
• 
Control environment
• 
Risk assessment
• 
Control activities
• 
Information and communication system
• 
Monitoring processes
LO3  Describe selected internal 
controls over cash receipts.
If cash is received directly from customers, a cash register should be 
used. The record of cash receipts per the register should be recon-
ciled with the actual cash in the drawer. If cash is received by mail, a 
remittance list should be prepared and sent to accounting. The checks 
should be endorsed immediately “For deposit” and sent to the cash 
receipts department for deposit in the bank. The remittance list and 
bank deposit should be independently reconciled.
LO4  Describe selected internal 
controls over cash payments and 
the use of a voucher system.
Every acquisition and subsequent payment should be supported by an 
approved voucher. The voucher should be supported by a purchase 
requisition, purchase order, receiving report, and purchase invoice. 
On the due date, checks are written only for approved vouchers, and 
vouchers and supporting documents are canceled to prevent reuse.

Payroll Accounting: Employee 
Earnings and Deductions
Intechra provides computer hardware, software, and database disposal 
and recycling services. The company has grown rapidly in response 
to environmental and privacy concerns about the use of IT assets. 
Founded in 2004, Intechra has already become the largest electronics 
life cycle management company in the United States. The company 
currently recycles more than 200,000 units per month. With more than 
600 employees, it off ers both on-site services and secure transport of 
assets to its locations. The recycling function provides companies with 
value recovery for used IT products. And this enables other users to 
acquire name-brand computer equipment at greatly reduced prices. 
Consistent with environmental concerns, the entire recycling operation 
is performed under a zero-landfi ll policy for e-waste.
A company such as Intechra requires a variety of employees—from 
highly technical to basic materials handling staff —with very diff erent 
rates of pay. For legal and operating effi  ciency reasons, a company 
must accurately track and control its payroll costs. It needs to know 
not only what to pay its people, but also what taxes to withhold from 
their wages. In this chapter, you will learn how to identify and account 
for payroll expenses for multiple employees.

281
EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS
Not every person who performs services for a business is considered an employee. An 
employee works under the control and direction of an employer. Examples include 
secretaries, maintenance workers, salesclerks, and plant supervisors. In contrast, an 
independent contractor performs a service for a fee and does not work under the con-
trol and direction of the company paying for the service. Examples of independent 
contractors include public accountants, real estate agents, and lawyers.
The distinction between an employee and an independent contractor is important 
for payroll purposes. Government laws and regulations regarding payroll are much 
more complex for employees than for independent contractors. Employers must deduct 
certain taxes, maintain payroll records, and file numerous reports for all employees. 
Only one form (Form 1099) must be filed for independent contractors. The payroll 
accounting procedures described in this chapter apply only to employer/employee 
relationships.
EMPLOYEE EARNINGS AND DEDUCTIONS
Three steps are required to determine how much to pay an employee for a pay period:
1. Calculate total earnings.
2. Determine the amounts of deductions.
3. Subtract deductions from total earnings to compute net pay.
SALARIES AND WAGES
Compensation for managerial or administrative services usually is called salary. A 
salary normally is expressed in biweekly (every two weeks), monthly, or annual terms. 
Compensation for skilled or unskilled labor usually is referred to as wages. Wages 
ordinarily are expressed in terms of hours, weeks, or units produced. The terms 
“salaries” and “wages” often are used interchangeably in practice.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay overtime at 1½  
times the regular rate to any hourly employee who works over 40 hours in a week. 
Some companies pay a higher rate for hours worked on Saturday or Sunday, but this

employees and 
independent 
contractors.
LO2 Calculate employee 
earnings and 
deductions. 
The only contact most of us have with payroll is receiving a paycheck. Few of us have seen the 
large amount of record keeping needed to produce that paycheck.
 Employers maintain complete payroll accounting records for two reasons. First, payroll costs are 
major expenditures for most companies. Payroll accounting records provide data useful in analyz-
ing and controlling these expenditures. Second, federal, state, and local laws require employers to 
keep payroll records. Companies must accumulate payroll data both for the business as a whole 
and for each employee.
 There are two major types of payroll taxes: those paid by the employee and those paid by the 
employer. In this chapter, we discuss employee taxes. In Chapter 9, we address payroll taxes paid 
by the employer.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
is not required by the FLSA. Some salaried employees are exempt from the FLSA rules 
and are not paid overtime.
COMPUTING TOTAL EARNINGS
Compensation usually is based on the time worked during the payroll period. 
Sometimes it is based on sales or units of output during the period. When compensa-
tion is based on time, a record must be kept of the time worked by each employee. 
Time cards (Figure 8-1) are helpful for this purpose. In large businesses with computer-
based timekeeping systems, plastic cards or badges with special magnetic strips or bar 
codes (Figure 8-2) can be used. Employees use the cards to clock in and out at 
terminals with card readers. For increased security, these terminals also are available 
with fingerprint readers.

Saturday, and twice the regular rate for hours on Sunday. Kuzmik’s total earnings for 
the week ended December 19 are computed as follows:
40 hours  $12 
$480

Salaried employees who are not exempt from the FSLA rules may also be entitled 
to premium pay for overtime. If this is the case, it is necessary to compute the regular 
hourly rate of pay before computing the overtime rate. To illustrate, assume that Linda 
Swaney has a salary of $2,288 a month plus 1½ times the regular hourly rate for hours 
in excess of 40 per week. Swaney’s overtime rate of pay is computed as follows:
$2,288  12 months

There are 52 weeks in each 
year but not 4 weeks in 
each month. That is why 
monthly salaries must be 
annualized in order to 
determine the hourly rate.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
DEDUCTIONS FROM TOTAL EARNINGS
An employee’s total earnings are called gross pay. Various deductions are made from 
gross pay to yield take-home or net pay. Deductions from gross pay fall into three 
major categories:
1. Federal (and possibly state and city) income tax withholding
2. Employee FICA tax withholding
3. Voluntary deductions
Income Tax Withholding
Federal law requires employers to withhold certain amounts from the total earnings 
of each employee. These withholdings are applied toward the payment of the employ-
ee’s federal income tax. Four factors determine the amount to be withheld from an 
employee’s gross pay each pay period:
1. Total earnings
2. Marital status
3. Number of withholding allowances claimed
4. Length of the pay period
Withholding Allowances. Each employee is required to furnish the employer an 
Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate, Form W-4 (Figure 8-3). The marital 
status of the employee and the number of allowances claimed on Form W-4 determine 
the dollar amount of earnings subject to withholding. A withholding allowance exempts 
a specific dollar amount of an employee’s gross pay from federal income tax withhold-
ing. In general, each employee is permitted one personal withholding allowance, one 
for a spouse who does not also claim an allowance, and one for each dependent.

A withholding certificate completed by Ken Istone is shown in Figure 8-3. Istone 
is married, has a spouse who does not claim an allowance, and has two dependent 
children. On line 5 of the W-4 form, Istone claims four allowances, calculated as 
follows:
Personal allowance

Spouse allowance

Allowances for dependents

Wage-Bracket Method. Employers generally use the wage-bracket method to deter-
mine the amount of tax to be withheld from an employee’s pay. The employee’s gross 
pay for a specific time period is traced into the appropriate wage-bracket table pro-
vided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). These tables cover various time periods, 
and there are separate tables for single and married taxpayers. Copies are provided in 
Circular E—Employer’s Tax Guide, which may be obtained from any local IRS office 
or at the IRS Internet site.
Portions of weekly income tax wage-bracket withholding tables for single and 
married persons are illustrated in Figure 8-4. Assume that Ken Istone (who claims 4 
allowances) had gross earnings of $545 for the week ending December 19, 20--. The 
amount to withhold for Istone is determined by using the following steps, as shown in 
Figure 8-4 for married persons (on page 287):
1. Find the row for wages of “at least $540, but less than $550.”
2. Find the column headed “4 withholding allowances.”
3. Where the row and column cross, $11.00 is given as the amount to be withheld.
For state or city income taxes, withholding generally is handled in one of two 
ways: (1) forms and tables similar to those provided by the IRS are used or (2) an 
amount equal to a percentage of the federal withholding amount is withheld.
Employee FICA Tax Withholding
The Federal Insurance Contributions Act requires employers to withhold FICA taxes 
from employees’ earnings. FICA taxes include amounts for both Social Security and 
Medicare programs. Social Security provides pensions and disability benefits. Medicare 
provides health insurance.
Congress has frequently changed the tax rates and the maximum amounts of earn-
ings subject to FICA taxes. For this text, we assume the Social Security rate is 6.2% 
on maximum earnings of $106,800. The Medicare rate is 1.45% on all earnings; there 
is no maximum.
To illustrate the calculation of FICA taxes, assume the following earnings for 
Sarah Cadrain:
 
 
Earnings
 
Pay Period 
Week  
Year-to-Date
 
Dec. 6–12 
$2,000 
$106,140
 
Dec. 13–19 
$1,660 
$107,800
For the week of December 6–12, FICA taxes on Cadrain’s earnings would be:
 
Gross Pay  
×  
Tax Rate  
 
=  
Tax
 
$2,000 
 
Social Security 
6.2% 
 
$124.00
 
 
 
Medicare 
1.45% 
 
   29.00
 
 
 
 
 
 
$153.00
A large number of IRS 
publications and forms can 
be found at the IRS Web 
site: http://www.irs.gov
LEARNING KEY
1. Find the row for wages.
2.  Find the column for withhold-
ing allowances.
3.  Find the amount where they 
cross.
When the Social Security 
program was established in 
1937, the tax was 1% on 
earnings up to $3,000 per 
year!

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
During the week of December 13–19, Cadrain’s earnings for the calendar year 
went over the $106,800 Social Security maximum by $1,000 ($107,800 – $106,800). 
Therefore, $1,000 of her $1,660 earnings for the week would not be subject to the 
Social Security tax.
 
Year-to-date earnings 
$107,800
 
Social Security maximum 
 106,800
 
Amount not subject to Social Security tax 
$    1,000
The Social Security tax on Cadrain’s December 13–19 earnings would be:
 
Gross pay 
$1,660.00
 
Amount not subject to Social Security tax 
 1,000.00
 
Amount subject to Social Security tax 
$    660.00
 
Tax rate 
    6.2%
 
Social Security tax 
$    40.92
Since there is no Medicare maximum, all of Cadrain’s December 13–19 earnings 
would be subject to the Medicare tax.
 
Gross pay 
$1,660.00
 
Tax rate 
   1.45%
 
Medicare tax 
$   24.07
The total FICA tax would be:
 
Social Security tax 
$40.92
 
Medicare tax 
 24.07
 
Total FICA tax 
$64.99
For the rest of the calendar year through December 31, Cadrain’s earnings would be 
subject only to Medicare taxes.
Voluntary Deductions
In addition to the mandatory deductions from employee earnings for income and 
FICA taxes, many other deductions are possible. These deductions are usually volun-
tary and depend on specific agreements between the employee and employer. Examples 
of voluntary deductions are:
1. U.S. savings bond purchases
2. Health insurance premiums
3. Credit union deposits
4. Pension plan payments
5. Charitable contributions
COMPUTING NET PAY
To compute an employee’s net pay for the period, subtract all tax withholdings and 
voluntary deductions from the gross pay. Ken Istone’s net pay for the week ended 
December 19 would be calculated as follows:
Gross pay 
 
$545.00
Deductions:
 
Federal income tax withholding 
$11.00
 
Social Security tax withholding 
33.79
 
Medicare tax withholding 
7.90
 
Health insurance premiums 
 10.00
Total deductions 
 
  62.69
Net pay 
 
$482.31
If you use computer software, 
such as Microsoft® Excel, to 
create a payroll register, you 
may notice a column or row 
that is off by a penny or two. 
Usually, this occurs in the 
Social Security and Medicare 
tax calculations. These are 
not errors. They are simply 
differences caused when 
rounding numbers to the 
nearest penny.

PAYROLL RECORDS
 Payroll records should provide the following information for each employee:
1.  Name, address, occupation, social security number, marital status, and number 
of withholding allowances
2. Gross amount of earnings, date of payment, and period covered by each payroll
3. Gross amount of earnings accumulated for the year
4. Amounts of taxes and other items withheld
Three types of payroll records are used to accumulate this information:
1. The payroll register
2. The payroll check with earnings statement attached
3. The employee earnings record
These records can be prepared by either manual or automated methods. The illus-
trations in this chapter are based on a manual system. The forms and procedures 
illustrated are equally applicable to both manual and automated systems.
PAYROLL REGISTER
A payroll register is a form used to assemble the data required at the end of each 
payroll period. Figure 8-5 on pages 290 and 291 illustrates Westly, Inc.’s payroll 
register for the payroll period ended December 19, 20--. Detailed information on 
earnings, taxable earnings, deductions, and net pay is provided for each employee. 
Column headings for deductions may vary, depending on which deductions are 
commonly used by a particular business. The sources of key information in the 
register are indicated in Figure 8-5.
Note four important things about Westly’s payroll register: 
1.  The first $106,800 of earnings of each employee is subject to Social Security tax. 
The Cumulative Total column, under the Earnings category, shows that Sarah 
Cadrain has exceeded this limit during the period. Thus, only $660 of her earn-
ings for this pay period is subject to Social Security tax, as shown in the Taxable 
Earnings columns. 
2.  There are two Taxable Earnings columns: Unemployment Compensation and 
Social Security. Only one of these columns (Social Security) is needed to deter-
mine employee taxes. Both columns are shown here because they are a standard 
part of a payroll register. The Unemployment Compensation column is needed 
to determine this payroll tax on employers. The Social Security column is needed 
to determine both employee and employer Social Security taxes. The two 
employer taxes (Unemployment Compensation and Social Security) are 
discussed in Chapter 9.
3.  Regular deductions are made from employee earnings for federal income tax 
and Social Security and Medicare taxes. 
LO3 Describe and prepare 
payroll records.
U REVU
Complete U REVU-1 on page 303 to test your basic understanding of LO2.
A good example of a 
deduction column that could 
be added is State Income 
Tax. In the payroll register in 
Figure 8-5, the column could 
be inserted immediately after 
Federal Income Tax.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
4.  Voluntary deductions are made for health insurance and United Way contribu-
tions, based on agreements with individual employees.
After the data for each employee have been entered, the amount columns in the 
payroll register should be totaled and the totals verified as follows:
Regular earnings 
 
$5,143.00
Overtime earnings 
 
   692.00
Gross earnings 
 
$5,835.00
Deductions:
Federal income tax 
$476.00
Social Security tax 
299.77
Medicare tax 
84.61
Health insurance premiums 
46.00
United Way 
  40.00 
   946.38
Net amount of payroll 
 
$4,888.62
In a computerized accounting system, the payroll software performs this proof. An 
error in the payroll register could cause the payment of an incorrect amount to an 
employee. It also could result in sending an incorrect amount to the government or 
other agencies for whom funds are withheld.
PAYROLL CHECK
Employees may be paid in cash or by check. Data needed to prepare a paycheck for each 
employee are contained in the payroll register. In a computer-based system, the  paychecks 
and payroll register normally are prepared at the same time. The employer furnishes an 
earnings statement to each employee along with each paycheck. Paychecks with detach-
able earnings statements, like the one for Ken Istone illustrated in Figure 8-6, are widely 
used for this purpose. Before the check is deposited or cashed, the employee should 
detach the stub and keep it.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
In many cases, the employee does not even handle the paycheck. Rather, payment 
is made by direct deposit or electronic funds transfer (EFT) by the employer to the 
employee’s bank. The employee receives only the earnings statement from the check 
indicating the deposit has been made. Payment by check or direct deposit provides 
better internal accounting control than payment by cash.
EMPLOYEE EARNINGS RECORD
A separate record of each employee’s earnings is called an employee earnings record. 
An employee earnings record for Ken M. Istone for a portion of the last quarter of the 
calendar year is illustrated in Figure 8-7 above.
The information in this record is obtained from the payroll register. In a computer-
based system, the employee earnings record can be updated at the same time the 
payroll register is prepared.
Istone’s earnings for four weeks of the last quarter of the year are shown on this 
form. Note that the entry for the pay period ended December 19 is the same as that 
in the payroll register illustrated in Figure 8-5. This linkage between the payroll 
register and the employee earnings record always exists. The payroll register pro-
vides a summary of the earnings of all employees for each pay period. The earnings 
record provides a summary of the annual earnings of an individual employee.
The earnings record illustrated in Figure 8-7 is designed to accumulate both quar-
terly and annual totals. The employer needs this information to prepare several 
reports. These reports will be discussed in Chapter 9.
ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE EARNINGS 
AND DEDUCTIONS
 The payroll register described in the previous section provides complete payroll data 
for each pay period. But the payroll register is not a journal. We still need to make a 
journal entry for payroll.

The numbered amounts in the payroll register column totals thus provide the basis 
for recording the payroll. If the employee paychecks are written from the regular bank 
account, the following journal entry is made:

Payroll Fraud—Paying for Ghosts
A supervisor at Haas Transfer Warehouse embezzled $12,000 
from the company by collecting paychecks for former 
employees. When an employee left the company, the super-
visor continued to submit a department time report for the 
employee. This caused a paycheck to be generated for the 
“ghost” employee. The supervisor then simply kept this pay-
check when others were distributed to actual employees.
This fraud shows the importance of two procedures that 
appear in this chapter: (1) a time card, plastic card, or badge 
should be used for each employee to keep an accurate record 
of time worked and (2) payment by direct deposit or electronic 
funds transfer to the employee’s bank is a good internal 
control.

Employee paychecks also can be written from a special payroll bank account. 
Large businesses with many employees commonly use a payroll bank account. If Westly 
used a payroll bank account, it first would have made the following entry on December 
19 to transfer funds from the regular bank account to the payroll bank account:

Then, the payroll entry shown above would be made, except that the credit of 
$4,888.62 would be to Payroll Cash rather than Cash.
If a payroll bank account is used, individual checks totaling $4,888.62 are written 
to the employees from that account. Otherwise, individual checks totaling that amount 
are written to the employees from the regular bank account.
Notice two important facts about the payroll entry. First, Wages and Salaries 
Expense is debited for the gross pay of the employees. The expense to the employer is 
the gross pay, not the employees’ net pay after deductions. Second, a separate account 
is kept for each deduction.
The accounts needed in entering deductions depend upon the deductions involved. 
To understand the accounting for these deductions, consider what the employer is 
doing. By deducting amounts from employees’ earnings, the employer is simply serving 
as an agent for the government and other groups. Amounts that are deducted from an 
employee’s gross earnings must be paid by the employer to these groups. Therefore, a 
separate account should be kept for the liability for each type of deduction.
To help us understand the journal entry for payroll, let’s use the accounting equa-
tion to examine the accounts involved. The seven accounts affected by the payroll 
entry above are shown in the accounting equation in Figure 8-8.
LEARNING KEY
Wages and Salaries Expense is 
debited for the gross pay. A sep-
arate account is kept for each 
earnings deduction. Cash is cred-
ited for the net pay.

WAGES AND SALARIES EXPENSE
This account is debited for the gross pay of all employees for each pay period. 
Sometimes separate expense accounts are kept for the employees of different depart-
ments. Thus, separate accounts may be kept for Office Salaries Expense, Sales Salaries 
Expense, and Factory Wages Expense.

EMPLOYEE INCOME TAX PAYABLE
This account is credited for the total federal income tax withheld from employees’ 
earnings. The account is debited for amounts paid to the IRS. When all of the income 
taxes withheld have been paid, the account will have a zero balance. A state or city 
income tax payable account is used in a similar manner.

PAYROLL RECORD-KEEPING METHODS
You probably noticed that the same information appears in several places in the 
payroll records—in the payroll register, paycheck and stub, and employee earnings 
records. If all records are prepared by hand (a manual system), the same informa-
tion would be recorded several times. Unless an employer has only a few employees, 
this can be very inefficient. Various approaches are available to make payroll 
accounting more efficient and accurate.
Both medium- and large-size businesses commonly use two approaches for payroll 
record keeping: payroll processing centers and electronic systems. A payroll processing 
center is a business that sells payroll record-keeping services. The employer provides 
the center with all basic employee data and each period’s report of hours worked. The 
processing center maintains all payroll records and prepares each period’s payroll 
checks. Payroll processing center fees tend to be much less than the cost to an employer 
of handling payroll internally.
An electronic system is a computer system based on a software package that per-
forms all payroll record keeping and prepares payroll checks. In this system, only the 
employee number and hours worked need to be entered into a computer each pay 
period, as shown in Figure 8-9. All other payroll data needed to prepare the payroll 
LO5 Describe various 
payroll record-keeping 
methods.
SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE TAXES PAYABLE
These accounts are credited for (1) the Social Security and Medicare taxes with-
held from employees’ earnings and (2) the Social Security and Medicare taxes 
imposed on the employer. Social Security and Medicare taxes imposed on the 
employer are discussed in Chapter 9. The accounts are debited for amounts paid 
to the IRS. When all of the Social Security and Medicare taxes have been paid, 
the accounts will have zero balances.

records can be stored in the computer. The computer uses the employee number and 
hours worked to determine the gross pay, deductions, and net pay. The payroll register,

LEARNING OBJECTIVES Key Points to Remember
LO1  Distinguish between employees 
and independent contractors.
Employees work under the control and direction of an employer. 
Independent contractors perform a service for a fee and do not 
work under the control and direction of the company paying for 
the service. Payroll accounting procedures apply only to employees, 
not to independent contractors.
LO2  Calculate employee earnings and 
deductions.
Three steps are required to determine how much to pay an 
employee for a pay period:
 
1. Calculate total earnings.
 
2. Determine the amounts of deductions.
 
3. Subtract deductions from total earnings to compute net pay.
Deductions from gross pay fall into three categories:
 
1. Income tax withholding
 
2. Employee Social Security and Medicare taxes withholding
 
3. Voluntary deductions
Four factors determine the amount to be withheld from an 
employee’s gross pay each pay period:
 
1. Total earnings
 
2. Marital status
 
3. Number of withholding allowances claimed
 
4. Length of the pay period
SELF-STUDY
The same inputs and outputs are required in all payroll systems. Even with a com-
puter, the data required for payroll processing have to be entered into the system at 
some point. The outputs—the payroll register, paychecks, and employee earnings 
records—are basically the same under each system.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
LEARNING OBJECTIVES Key Points to Remember
LO3  Describe and prepare payroll 
records.
The payroll register and the employee earnings record are linked. 
The payroll register provides a summary of earnings of all 
employees for each pay period. The earnings record provides a 
summary of the annual earnings of an individual employee.
LO4  Account for employee earnings 
and deductions.
The totals at the bottom of the columns of the payroll register 
provide the basis for the journal entry for payroll.
Amounts withheld or deducted by the employer from employee 
earnings are credited to liability accounts. The employer must 
pay these amounts to the proper government groups and other 
appropriate groups.
LO5  Describe various payroll record-
keeping methods.
In a manual payroll system, the same information needs to be 
recorded several times. An electronic payroll system is much 
more efficient.
DEMONSTRATION PROBLEM
Carole Vohsen operates a pet grooming salon called Canine Coiffures. She has five employees, all of whom are 
paid on a weekly basis. Canine Coiffures uses a payroll register, individual employee earnings records, a journal, 
and a general ledger.
The payroll data for each employee for the week ended January 21, 20--, are given below. Employees are paid 
1½ times the regular rate for work over 40 hours a week and double time for work on Sunday.

Sheila Martinez is the manager of the Shampooing Department. Her social security number is 500-88-4189, and 
she was born April 12, 1969. She lives at 46 Darling Crossing, Norwich, CT 06360. Martinez was hired September 
1 of last year.
Canine Coiffures uses a federal income tax withholding table. A portion of this weekly table is provided in 
Figure 8-4 on pages 286 and 287. Social Security tax is withheld at the rate of 6.2% of the first $106,800 earned. 
Medicare tax is withheld at the rate of 1.45%, and city earnings tax at the rate of 1%, both applied to gross pay. 
Garriott and Parker each have $14.00 and DeNourie and Martinez each have $4.00 withheld for health insurance. 
DeNourie, Martinez, and Shapiro each have $15.00 withheld to be invested in the groomers’ credit union. Garriott 
and Shapiro each have $18.75 withheld under a savings bond purchase plan.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
The minimum wage originally was only 25 cents an hour. Today it is $7.25 an hour. 
Assume that Congress is considering raising the minimum wage again and your U.S. 
representative is asking for public opinion on this issue. Write a letter to your represen-
tative with arguments for and against a higher minimum wage.
ETHICS CASE
Maura Lowe is a payroll accountant for N & L Company. She prepares and processes 
the company’s payroll on a weekly basis and has been at N & L for only three months. 
All employees are paid on Friday. On Wednesday afternoon, Simon Lentz, one of the 
company’s top sales associates, asks Maura to not take out any payroll deductions 
from his pay this week. He explains that he is short of cash and needs the full amount 
of his gross salary just to put food on the table and make his past-due car payment. 
He promises Maura that she can catch up on the deductions over the next month. The 
deductions include employee income tax, Social Security tax, Medicare tax, and health 
insurance premiums.
1. Is Simon’s request of Maura ethical? Why or why not?
2. If this were the first pay period of the year and Maura agreed not to take out 
deductions from Simon’s pay, what effect would this have on the liabilities 
section of the balance sheet?
3. Write a short paragraph from Maura to Simon explaining how omitting deduc-
tions from a pay period will cause errors in the company’s financial statements.
4. In small groups, discuss what action Maura should take regarding Simon’s 
request.
MASTERY PROBLEM
 
Abigail Trenkamp owns and operates the Trenkamp Collection Agency. Listed on the 
following page are the name, number of allowances claimed, marital status, informa-
tion from time cards on hours worked each day, and the hourly rate of each employee. 
All hours worked in excess of 40 hours for Monday through Friday are paid at 1½  
times the regular rate. All weekend hours are paid at double the regular rate.
Trenkamp uses a weekly federal income tax withholding table (see Figure 8-4 on 
pages 286 and 287). Social Security tax is withheld at the rate of 6.2% for the first 
$106,800 earned. Medicare tax is withheld at 1.45% and state income tax at 3.5%. 
Each employee has $5.00 withheld for health insurance. All employees use payroll 
deduction to the credit union for varying amounts as listed.

Payroll Accounting: Employer 
Taxes and Reports
As competition has become more global, many challenges to busi-
nesses have developed. Learning how to function in many diff erent 
languages and cultures is one of these challenges. Lingualinx is a full-
service translation company that off ers help with language issues. 
Founded in 2002, Lingualinx has offi  ces in the United States, the United 
Kingdom, France, and China. It hires qualifi ed professional linguists 
with skills tailored to provide services in more than 100 languages. 
Some examples of its capabilities include simple text translation, simul-
taneous interpretation, sign language, copywriting, and even Braille 
production. It can also provide on-site language instruction classes.
Lingualinx faces the same kinds of payroll issues as Intechra, the 
company described in the introduction to Chapter 8. But Lingualinx 
would face the added challenge of employees in multiple countries, 
so it would need to know the regulations in each location. In addition, 
you will learn in this chapter that employers must account for not just 
employee wages and taxes but also employer taxes. The complexity of 
payroll accounting is a major reason why many businesses hire an out-
side company to manage their payroll. You will also learn about two of 
these payroll service companies in this chapter’s “A Broader View.”
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter should 
enable you to:
LO1  Describe and calculate 
employer payroll taxes.
LO2  Account for employer 
payroll taxes expense.
LO3  Describe employer 
reporting and payment 
responsibilities.
LO4  Describe and account for 
workers’ compensation 
insurance.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES
Most employers must pay FICA, FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act), and SUTA 
(state unemployment tax) taxes.
EMPLOYER FICA TAXES
Employer FICA taxes are levied on employers at the same rates and on the same earn-
ings bases as the employee FICA taxes. As explained in Chapter 8, we are assuming 
the Social Security component is 6.2% on maximum earnings of $106,800 for each 
employee. Since there is no maximum on the Medicare component, this tax is 1.45% 
on all earnings.
The payroll register we saw in Chapter 8 is a key source of information for com-
puting employer payroll taxes. That payroll register is reproduced in Figure 9-1. The 
Taxable Earnings Social Security column shows that $4,835 of employee earnings 
were subject to Social Security tax for the pay period. The employer’s Social Security 
tax on these earnings is computed as follows:
LO1 Describe and calculate 
employer payroll taxes.
The taxes we discussed in Chapter 8 had one thing in common—they all were levied on the 
employee. The employer withheld them from employees’ earnings and paid them to the govern-
ment. They did not add anything to the employer’s payroll expenses.
 In this chapter, we will examine several taxes that are imposed directly on the employer. All of 
these taxes represent additional payroll expenses. You will see that the total cost of employees 
includes not only wages but also payroll taxes and benefi ts such as vacation and sick pay.

SELF-EMPLOYMENT TAX
Individuals who own and run their own business are considered self-employed. These 
individuals can be viewed as both employer and employee. They do not receive salary 
or wages from the business, but they do have earnings in the form of the business net 
income. Self-employment income is the net income of a trade or business run by an 
individual. Currently, persons earning net self-employment income of $400 or more 
must pay a self-employment tax. Self-employment tax is a contribution to the FICA 
program. The tax rates are double the Social Security and Medicare rates (12.4% +

Social Security and Medicare taxes. Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business, 
contains helpful information for self-employed persons.
EMPLOYER FUTA TAX
The FUTA (Federal Unemployment Tax Act) tax is levied only on employers. It is not 
deducted from employees’ earnings. The purpose of this tax is to raise funds to admin-
ister the combined federal/state unemployment compensation program. The maximum

amount of earnings subject to the FUTA tax and the tax rate can be changed by 
Congress. The current rate is 6.2% applied to maximum earnings of $7,000 for each 
employee, but employers are allowed a credit of up to 5.4% for participation in state 
unemployment programs. Thus, the effective federal rate is commonly 0.8%.
Gross FUTA rate 
6.2%
Credit for state unemployment taxes 
5.4%
Net FUTA rate 
0.8%
To illustrate the computation of the FUTA tax, refer to Figure 9-1. The Taxable 
Earnings Unemployment Compensation column shows that only $300 of employee 
earnings were subject to the FUTA tax. This amount is low because the payroll period 
is late in the calendar year (December 19, 20--). It is common for most employees to 
exceed the $7,000 earnings limit by this time. The FUTA tax is computed as shown in 
Figure 9-2.

EMPLOYER SUTA TAX
The SUTA (state unemployment tax) tax is also levied only on employers in most 
states. The purpose of this tax is to raise funds to pay unemployment benefits. Tax 
rates and unemployment benefits vary among the states. A common rate is 5.4% 
applied to maximum earnings of $7,000 for each employee. Most states have an 
experience-rating system to encourage employers to provide regular employment to 
workers. If an employer has very few former employees receiving unemployment com-
pensation, the employer qualifies for a lower state unemployment tax rate. If an 
employer qualifies for a lower state rate, the full credit of 5.4% would still be allowed 
in computing the federal unemployment tax due.
Refer to the payroll register in Figure 9-1. As we saw with the FUTA tax, only 
$300 of employee earnings for this pay period are subject to the state unemployment 
tax. The tax is computed as shown in Figure 9-3.
State unemployment tax 
rates and maximum earn-
ings amounts vary greatly. 
Current rates range from 
5.4% to 11%. Maximum 
earnings amounts are 
$7,000 to $35,700.

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES
Now that we have computed the employer payroll taxes, we need to journalize them. 
It is common to debit all employer payroll taxes to a single account—Payroll Taxes 
Expense. However, we usually credit separate liability accounts for Social Security, 
Medicare, FUTA, and SUTA taxes payable.
JOURNALIZING EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES
The employer payroll taxes computed in the previous section can be summarized as 
follows:
Employer’s Social Security tax 
$299.77
Employer’s Medicare tax 
84.61
FUTA tax 
2.40
SUTA tax 
  16.20
Total employer payroll taxes 
$402.98
These amounts provide the basis for the following journal entry:

The steps needed to prepare this journal entry for employer payroll taxes are:
STEP 1  Obtain the total earnings and taxable earnings amounts from the Earnings—
Total and Taxable Earnings columns of the payroll register. In this case, total 
earnings were $5,835; Social Security taxable earnings were $4,835; and 
Unemployment Compensation taxable earnings were $300.
STEP 2  Compute the amount of employer Social Security tax by multiplying the 
Social Security taxable earnings by 6.2%.
STEP 3  Compute the amount of employer Medicare tax by multiplying total earnings 
by 1.45%.
STEP 4  Compute the amount of FUTA tax by multiplying the Unemployment Taxable 
earnings by 0.8%.
STEP 5  Compute the amount of SUTA tax by multiplying the Unemployment Taxable 
earnings by 5.4%.
STEP 6  Prepare the appropriate journal entry using the amounts computed in 
steps 2–5.

These are the same liability accounts used in Chapter 8 to record the Social Security

ited when the taxes are paid to the IRS. When all of the Social Security and Medicare 
taxes have been paid, the accounts will have zero balances.

A separate liability account entitled FUTA Tax Payable is kept for the employer’s 
FUTA tax. This account is credited for the tax imposed on employers under the 
Federal Unemployment Tax Act. The account is debited when this tax is paid. When 
all of the FUTA taxes have been paid, the account will have a zero balance.

TOTAL PAYROLL COST OF AN EMPLOYEE
It is interesting to note what it really costs to employ a person. The employer must, of 
course, pay the gross wages of an employee. In addition, the employer must pay pay-
roll taxes on employee earnings up to certain dollar limits.

PART 2 
Accounting for Cash and Payroll
To illustrate, assume that an employee earns $26,000 a year. The total cost of this 
employee to the employer is calculated as follows:
Gross wages 
$26,000
Employer Social Security tax, 6.2% of $26,000 
1,612
Employer Medicare tax, 1.45% of $26,000 
377
State unemployment tax, 5.4% of $7,000 
378
FUTA tax, 0.8% of $7,000 
     56
$28,423
Thus, the total payroll cost of employing a person whose stated compensation is 
$26,000 is $28,423. Employer payroll taxes clearly are a significant cost of doing busi-
ness. Employer-paid medical insurance and pension plans can further increase total 
payroll costs.

REPORTING AND PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Employer payroll reporting and payment responsibilities fall into six areas:
1. Federal income tax withholding and Social Security and Medicare taxes
2. FUTA taxes
3. SUTA taxes
4. Employee Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2)
5. Summary of employee wages and taxes (Form W-3)
6. Employment eligibility verification (Form I-9)
FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING AND SOCIAL 
SECURITY AND MEDICARE TAXES
Three important aspects of employer reporting and payment responsibilities for fed-
eral income tax withholding and Social Security and Medicare taxes are:
1. Determining when payments are due
2. Use of Form 8109, Federal Tax Deposit Coupon
3. Use of Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return
When Payments Are Due
The date by which federal income tax withholding and Social Security and Medicare 
taxes must be paid depends on the amount of these taxes. Figure 9-5 summarizes the 
deposit rules stated in Circular E––Employer’s Tax Guide. In general, the larger the 
amount that needs to be deposited, the more frequently payments must be made. For 
simplicity, we will assume that deposits must be made 15 days after the end of each 
month.

reporting and payment

Form 8109
Deposits may be made using either the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System 
(EFTPS) or Form 8109. The EFTPS is an electronic funds transfer system for making 
federal tax deposits. Any taxpayer whose deposits in the prior year exceeded $200,000 
is required to use this system. Deposits other than EFTPS are made at an authorized 
commercial bank using Form 8109, Federal Tax Deposit Coupon (Figure 9-6). The 
Employer Identification Number (EIN) shown on this form is obtained by the 
employer from the IRS. This number identifies the employer and must be shown on 
all payroll forms and reports filed with the IRS.

Form 941
Form 941, Employer’s Quarterly Federal Tax Return, must be filed with the IRS at the 
end of the month following each calendar quarter. This form reports the following 
taxes for the quarter:
1. Employee federal income tax withheld
2. Employee Social Security and Medicare taxes withheld
3. Employer Social Security and Medicare taxes
A completed form for Westly, Inc., for the first quarter of the calendar year is 
shown in Figure 9-7. Instructions for completing the form are provided with the form 
and in Circular E.
FUTA TAXES
Federal unemployment taxes must be calculated on a quarterly basis. If the accumu-
lated liability exceeds $500, the total must be paid to an authorized commercial bank. 
The total is due by the end of the month following the close of the quarter. If the liabil-
ity is $500 or less, no deposit is necessary. The amount is simply added to the amount 
to be deposited for the next quarter. FUTA taxes are deposited using either EFTPS or 
Form 8109 (Figure 9-6).
Assume that an employer’s accumulated FUTA tax liability for the first quarter of 
the calendar year is $508. The employer would use Form 8109 to deposit this amount 
on April 30. The journal entry for this transaction would be as follows:

SUMMARY OF EMPLOYEE WAGES AND TAXES
Employers send Form W-3, Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statements (Figure 9-11), 
with Copy A of Forms W-2 to the Social Security Administration. Form W-3 must be 
filed by February 28 following the end of each taxable year. This form summarizes the 
employee earnings and tax information presented on Forms W-2 for the year. Information 
needed to complete Form W-3 is contained in the employee earnings records.
EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION
Every employee hired after November 6, 1986, must complete Form I-9, Employment 
Eligibility Verification. The purpose of this form is to document that each employee is 
authorized to work in the United States. The employee completes Section 1 of the form 
and provides the employer with evidence of the employee’s identity and authorization 
to work. The employer completes Section 2 of the form indicating what evidence the 
employer examined.
Form I-9 is not filed with any government agency. Instead, it must be retained by 
the employer and made available for inspection if requested by the Department of 
Homeland Security or the Department of Labor.
SUMMARY OF TAXES, REPORTS, AND PAYMENTS
Keeping track of the many payroll taxes can be a challenge for an employer. 
Figure 9-12 summarizes the various employee and employer taxes we have dis-
cussed in Chapters 8 and 9. Figure 9-13 shows a calendar that highlights the due 
dates for the various reports and deposits. The calendar assumes the following 
for an employer:
1.  Undeposited FIT (federal income tax) and Social Security and Medicare taxes of 
$2,500 at the end of each quarter and less than $50,000 during the lookback period.
2. Undeposited FUTA taxes of more than $500 at the end of each quarter.
3. SUTA taxes deposited quarterly.

The combination of payroll taxes, reports, deposit rules, and due dates can make pay-
roll accounting rather complex. In fact, this is a major reason why small businesses 
often hire an accountant or an outside company to handle payroll.
Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return and accompanying documents, and, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
they are true, correct, and complete.

Dealing with Payroll Complexity—Let 
Someone Else Do It
A common way for both small and large businesses to deal with 
the complexity of payroll reports, deposit rules, and due dates 
is to hire an outside company to handle the payroll. Payroll 
processing companies have combined payroll expertise with 
the power of computers to create a major business enterprise 
based on the efficient and effective provision of payroll services.
The extent to which businesses use outside companies to 
handle payroll can be seen in the two largest payroll process-
ing companies: Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) and 
Paychex, Inc. ADP has operations in 26 countries, provides payroll services to 585,000 clients (500,000 in the United States), 
and has revenues of $9 billion. Paychex has 100 locations nationwide, provides services to 572,000 clients, and has revenues 
of $2 billion. These companies prepare employee paychecks, journals, and summary reports; collect and remit funds for 
federal, state, and local payroll taxes; and file all required forms with government taxing authorities.

WORKERS’ COMPENSATION INSURANCE
Most states require employers to carry workers’ compensation insurance. Workers’ 
compensation insurance provides insurance for employees who suffer a job-related 
illness or injury.
The employer usually pays the entire cost of workers’ compensation insurance. 
The cost of the insurance depends on the number of employees, riskiness of the job, 
and the company’s accident history. For example, the insurance premium for workers 
in a chemical plant could be higher than for office workers. Employers generally 
obtain the insurance either from the state in which they operate or from a private 
insurance company.
The employer usually pays the premium at the beginning of the year, based on the 
estimated payroll for the year. At the end of the year, after the actual amount of payroll 
is known, an adjustment is made. If the employer has overpaid, a credit is received 
from the state or insurance company. If the employer has underpaid, an additional 
premium is paid.
To illustrate the accounting for workers’ compensation insurance, assume that 
Lockwood Co. expects its payroll for the year to be $210,000. If Lockwood’s insur-
ance premium rate is 0.2%, its payment for workers’ compensation insurance at the 
beginning of the year would be $420.

LO2  Account for employer payroll 
taxes expense.
Employer payroll taxes include FICA, FUTA, and SUTA taxes. 
These taxes represent additional payroll expenses of the 
employer. The journal entry for payroll taxes is as follows:
The steps to be followed in preparing this journal entry are as 
follows:
1. Obtain the total earnings and taxable earnings amounts 
from the Earnings––Total and Taxable Earnings columns 
of the payroll register.
2. Compute the amount of employer Social Security tax by 
multiplying the Social Security taxable earnings by 6.2%.
3. Compute the amount of employer Medicare tax by 
multiplying total earnings by 1.45%.
4. Compute the amount of FUTA tax by multiplying the 
Unemployment Taxable earnings by 0.8%.
5. Compute the amount of SUTA tax by multiplying the 
Unemployment Taxable earnings by 5.4%.
6. Prepare the appropriate journal entry using the amounts 
computed in steps 2–5.
LO3  Describe employer reporting and 
payment responsibilities.
Employer payroll reporting and payment responsibilities fall 
into six areas.
1.  Federal income tax withholding and Social Security 
and Medicare taxes
2. FUTA taxes
3. SUTA taxes
4. Employee Wage and Tax Statement (Form W-2)
5. Summary of employee wages and taxes (Form W-3)

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
The director of the art department at an advertising company, Wilson Watson, wants to 
hire new office staff. His boss tells him that to do so he must find in his budget not only 
the base salary for this position but an additional 30% for “fringe benefits.” Wilson 
explodes: “How in the world can there be 30% in fringe benefits?” Write a memo to 
Wilson Watson explaining the costs that probably make up these fringe benefits.
ETHICS CASE
Bob Estes works at Cliffrock Company in the central receiving department. He unpacks 
incoming shipments and verifies quantities of goods received. Over the weekend, Bob 
pulled a muscle in his back while playing basketball. When he came to work on 
Monday and started unpacking shipments, his back started to hurt again. Bob called 
the human resources department and told them he hurt his back lifting a package at 
work. He was told to fill out an accident report and sent to an orthopedic clinic with 
a workers’ compensation form. The doctor at the clinic told Bob not to lift anything 
heavy for two weeks and to stay home from work for at least one week.
1. Is Bob entitled to workers’ compensation? Why or why not?
2. What effect will Bob’s claim have on Cliffrock Company’s workers’ compensa-
tion insurance premium?
3. Write a short memo from the human resources department to Cliffrock 
Company’s employees explaining the purpose of workers’ compensation.

CHALLENGE PROBLEM
 
Payrex Co. has six employees. All are paid on a weekly basis. For the payroll period 
ending January 7, total employee earnings were $12,500, all of which were subject to 
SUTA, FUTA, Social Security, and Medicare taxes. The SUTA tax rate in Payrex’s state 
is 5.4%, but Payrex qualifies for a rate of 2.0% because of its good record of provid-
ing regular employment to its employees. Other employer payroll taxes are at the rates 
described in the chapter.
REQUIRED
1. Calculate Payrex’s FUTA, SUTA, Social Security, and Medicare taxes for the week 
ended January 7.
2. Prepare the journal entry for Payrex’s payroll taxes for the week ended January 7.
3. What amount of payroll taxes did Payrex save because of its good employment 
record?

Accounting for 
Sales and Cash Receipts
In recent years, we have seen increasing concern about how 
our actions aff ect the environment. Planet Shoes is an example 
of a young company whose business refl ects this concern. Planet 
Shoes is an online shoe retailer specializing in eco-friendly shoes. 
It markets vegan shoes, shoes made from recycled chemicals, and 
a number of name brands such as Birkenstock, Clarks, Geox, and 
New Balance. At checkout, it even off ers the option of carbon-free 
shipping and shoe recycling. And it donates 1% of its sales to envi-
ronmental organizations.
Operating from Waltham, Massachusetts, Planet’s revenues 
have grown from $541 thousand to $5.9 million in only 10 years. 
Planet must have a good system to manage and account for its 
high volume of sales. In addition, since all of its sales are via the 
Internet, it must know how to handle credit card sales. In this chap-
ter, you will learn how to account for sales transactions, including 
credit card sales.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

enable you to:
LO1  Describe merchandise 
sales transactions.
LO2  Describe and use mer-
chandise sales accounts.
LO3  Describe and use the 
accounts receivable 
ledger.

MERCHANDISE SALES TRANSACTIONS
A sale is a transfer of merchandise from one business or individual to another in 
exchange for cash or a promise to pay cash. Sales procedures and documents vary 
greatly, depending on the nature and size of the business.
RETAILER
Retail businesses generally sell to customers who enter the store, select the merchan-
dise they want, and bring it to a salesclerk. The salesclerk enters the sale in some type 
of electronic cash register that generates a receipt for the customer. A copy of the 
receipt is retained in the register. Most registers can print a summary of the day’s sales 
activity, like the one in Figure 10-1. This summary can be used to journalize sales in 
the accounting records.
LO1 Describe merchandise 
sales transactions.
Over the last nine chapters, we have learned how to account for a service business. We are now 
ready to consider accounting for a diff erent kind of business—merchandising. A merchandising 
business purchases merchandise such as clothing, furniture, or computers, and sells that mer-
chandise to customers. For example, Planet Shoes buys shoes from vendors and manufacturers 
and sells them to its customers online.
 This chapter examines how to account for the sale of merchandise using the accrual basis of 
accounting. We will learn how to use four new accounts and a subsidiary ledger.
A retailer such as Planet 
Shoes makes all sales online. 
For Web-based transactions, 
companies use electronic 
forms that are similar to the 
paper documents described 
in this chapter.

WHOLESALER
Figure 10-3 shows how the wholesaler plays a different role than the retailer in the 
marketing chain. Retailers usually sell to final consumers, whereas wholesalers tend to 
sell to retailers. This causes the wholesale sales transaction process to differ, as shown 
in Figure 10-4.
FIGURE 10-3 Marketing Chain
Manufacturer
Wholesaler
Retailer
Consumer
Customers commonly mail or fax written orders to buy merchandise from whole-
salers. When the customer purchase order arrives, the customer name and items being 
ordered are determined. Since wholesalers typically make sales on account, credit 
approval is needed. Three copies of a sales invoice are then generated. One is sent to 
In a computerized system, 
customer orders can be 
submitted electronically. 
Even the credit approval 
process can be handled by 
the computer.
An additional document often created as evidence of a sale in a retail business is 
a sales ticket (Figure 10-2). One copy of the sales ticket is given to the customer, and 
the other copy is sent to accounting.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
CREDIT MEMORANDUM
Both retailers and wholesalers sometimes have customers return goods or seek price 
reductions for damaged goods. Merchandise returned by a customer for a refund is 
called a sales return. Price reductions granted by the seller because of defects or other 
problems with the merchandise are called sales allowances. When credit is given for 
merchandise returned or for an allowance, a credit memo is issued for the amount 
involved. This document gets its name from the same debit and credit concepts you 
learned in Chapter 3. It is called a credit memo because the customer’s account receiv-
able is credited to reduce the amount the customer owes. One copy of the credit memo 
is given to the customer and one copy is sent to accounting. Figure 10-6 shows a credit 
memo issued by Northern Micro for merchandise returned by a customer.

MERCHANDISE SALES ACCOUNTS
 To account for merchandise sales transactions, we will use four new accounts:
1. Sales
2. Sales Tax Payable
3. Sales Returns and Allowances
4. Sales Discounts
The position of these accounts in the accounting equation and their normal balances 
are shown in Figure 10-7.
SALES ACCOUNT
The sales account is a revenue account used to record sales of merchandise. The 
account is credited for the selling price of merchandise sold during the period.

Chapter 2. It is a general ledger account. The “Customer” name is for the customer’s 
account in the accounts receivable ledger. This ledger is explained later in this chapter.
SALES TAX PAYABLE ACCOUNT
Most states require retailers to collect sales tax on sales to final consumers. When sales 
tax is imposed on merchandise sold, a separate account for Sales Tax Payable is kept. 
This is a liability account that is credited for the taxes imposed on sales. The account 
is debited for sales taxes paid to the proper taxing authority or for sales taxes on mer-
chandise returned by customers. A credit balance in the account indicates the amount 
owed to the taxing authority for taxes collected.

The debit to Accounts Receivable indicates that the amount owed by customers to 
the business has increased. Since the buyer has accepted the merchandise and promised 
to pay for it, revenue is recognized by crediting Sales. Sales Tax Payable is credited 
because the amount of sales tax owed to the taxing authority has increased.
SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ACCOUNT
Sales Returns and Allowances is a contra-revenue account, which has a debit balance 
and is deducted from the related revenue account. Sales returns and sales allowances 
are debited to this account. As shown in Figure 10-8, this account is reported as a 
deduction from Sales on the income statement. Returns and allowances are debited to 
a separate account rather than directly to Sales so that the business can more readily 
keep track of this activity.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Note carefully the parts of this entry. Sales Returns and Allowances is debited for 
the amount of the sale, excluding the sales tax. Sales Tax Payable is debited separately 
for the sales tax on the original sale amount. Accounts Receivable is credited for the 
total amount originally billed to Chang.
SALES DISCOUNTS ACCOUNT
Some businesses offer cash discounts to encourage prompt payment by customers who 
buy merchandise on account. When credit is tight and businesses are short of cash, it 
is particularly important to convert accounts receivable into cash as soon as possible. 
Prompt collection of accounts receivable also reduces the risk that those receivables 
will become uncollectible. Some possible credit terms are shown in Figure 10-9.
Another type of discount 
sometimes offered between 
businesses is a trade 
discount. This discount is 
explained in Chapter 11.
FIGURE 10-9 Credit Terms

MEANING
To the seller, cash discounts are considered sales discounts. Sales Discounts is a 
contra-revenue account to which cash discounts allowed are debited. Like Sales 
Returns and Allowances, this account is reported as a deduction from Sales on the 
income statement, as shown in Figure 10-10.

Figure 10-11 shows how (1) a sale on account followed by (2) collection with a 
cash discount affects the accounts receivable, sales, and cash accounts.
If any merchandise has been returned, the sales discount is calculated on the sale 
amount after deducting the return. For the above sale for $100, if $30 of merchandise 
had been returned, the discount on the remaining $70 collection would be 2% × $70 = 
$1.40. The journal entry for the collection is:

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
If there is a sales tax, the discount is calculated on the sale amount excluding the 
sales tax. Assume merchandise is sold for $100 plus 5% sales tax (5% × $100 = $5), 
with credit terms of 2/10, n/30. At the time of the sale, the following entry is made:

POSTING SALES TO THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE LEDGER
After all posting to the general ledger is completed, the accounts receivable, sales tax 
payable, and sales accounts in the general ledger are up to date. But at this point, 
Northern Micro has no complete record of the account receivable from individual 
customers. To run the business properly, Northern Micro needs this information.
A common approach to keeping a record of each customer’s account receivable is 
to use an accounts receivable ledger. This is a separate ledger containing an individual 
account receivable for each customer. It is called a subsidiary ledger. A summary 
accounts receivable account called a controlling account is still maintained in the gen-
eral ledger. The accounts receivable ledger is “subsidiary” to this account. If there are 
many customer accounts, it is good practice to assign each customer an account 
number. The subsidiary ledger accounts are kept in either alphabetical or numerical 
order, depending on whether customer accounts are identified by number. Figure 10-14 
shows part of the accounts receivable ledger for Northern Micro.
Figure 10-14 illustrates the use of the accounts receivable ledger for Northern 
Micro’s April 4 and 10 sales transactions. The accounts receivable ledger is posted

from the journal daily so that current information is available for each customer at all 
times. Note that including the individual customer name after Accounts Receivable in 
each journal entry helps in the posting process. Several steps are used to post from the 
general journal to the accounts receivable ledger, as shown in Figure 10-14.
In the accounts receivable ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance column.
STEP 4  Enter the journal page number from which each transaction is posted in the 
Posting Reference column.

    LEARNING KEY
When an accounts receivable ledger is used, the Posting Reference column in the general journal 
can serve two purposes. (1) The account number is inserted to indicate the general ledger account 
has been posted. (2) A slash (/) and a check mark (✓) can be inserted to indicate the accounts 
receivable ledger account has been posted.
The accounts receivable ledger also can be posted from the source document used 
to make the general journal entry. For example, Sales Ticket No. 134C (see Figure 10-2) 
could be used to post that sale to Brenda Myers’ account in the accounts receivable 
ledger. In this case, 134C would be inserted in the Posting Reference column of her 
account.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Note the relationship between the general journal, accounts receivable ledger, and 
general ledger. Entries in the general journal are posted to the general ledger and 
accounts receivable ledger. After the posting of the accounts receivable ledger and the 
general ledger is completed, the total of the accounts receivable ledger balances should 
equal the Accounts Receivable balance in the general ledger. Remember, the accounts 
receivable ledger is simply a detailed listing of the same information that is summa-
rized in Accounts Receivable in the general ledger.
SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES
If a customer returns merchandise or is given an allowance for damaged merchandise, 
a general journal entry is required. On May 5, Susan Chang returned two printer 
cartridges costing $40 plus $2 sales tax (Figure 10-6, page 357). Figure 10-15 shows 
the general journal entry, general ledger posting, and accounts receivable ledger post-
ing for this transaction.
The general journal entry is made in the usual manner. The general ledger is posted 
using the same five steps as were illustrated for sales transactions in Figure 10-13. 
The accounts receivable ledger is posted using the five steps below, as illustrated in 
Figure 10-15.
In the accounts receivable ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance column.
STEP 4  Enter the journal page number from which each transaction is posted in the 
Posting Reference column.
In the journal:
STEP 5  Enter a slash (/) followed by a check mark (✓) in the Posting Reference col-
umn of the journal for each transaction that is posted.
CASH RECEIPTS
Like sales transactions, cash receipt transactions occur frequently in most businesses.  
Three common types of cash receipts from sales are collections on account, cash sales, 
and bank credit card sales. 
Collections on Account 
Sales on account lead to cash receipts, which are entered in the general journal. For 
example, assume that Northern Micro receives cash from Enrico Lorenzo for Sale No. 
133C on April 14. The transaction is recorded in the general journal as follows:
LEARNING KEY

able ledger balances must equal

Bank Credit Card Sales 
An increasing amount of sales today are made using bank credit cards. In fact, con-
sider Planet Shoes, the company in the chapter introduction. Planet operates totally 
online, so virtually all of its sales would be by bank credit card. Bank credit card sales 
are similar to cash sales because the cash is available to the business as soon as an 
electronic deposit is made at the end of the day. The credit card company makes the 
electronic deposit to the merchandiser’s bank account for the gross amount of credit 
card sales less a processing fee. The fee is based on the gross amount of the sale, includ-
ing the sales tax. Thus, on a sale of $100 plus sales tax of $5, the credit card fee at 4%

JOURNALIZING CASH RECEIPTS
To illustrate the journalizing and posting of cash receipts transactions, we continue to 
use Northern Micro. Assume the following cash receipts transactions related to sales 
occurred during April 20--. (To simplify the illustration, cash sales and bank credit 
card sales for the month are summarized as single transactions at the end of the 
month.)
 
Apr. 14 
Received cash on account from Enrico Lorenzo for Sale No. 133C, $1,596.
 
20 
Received cash on account from Brenda Myers for Sale No. 134C, $462.
 
28 
Received cash on account from Edith Walton for Sale No. 105D, $1,029.
 
30 
Cash sales for the month are $3,600 plus tax of $180.
 
30 
 Bank credit card sales for the month are $2,500 plus tax of $125. Bank credit card 
expenses on these sales are $100.
These transactions are entered in a general journal as shown in Figure 10-16.
A BROADER VIEW
Is This Sale for Real?
U.S. businesses lose billions of dollars annually because of 
credit card fraud and bad checks. To reduce credit card fraud, 
cashiers should do two things: (1) Watch the customer sign 
the credit card slip and match it to the signature on the card. 
(2) Obtain an approval code on all credit card transactions. To 
reduce bad check losses, cashiers should accept only a driver’s 
license as identification. They should compare the picture with 
the customer, watch the check being signed, and match the 
check signature with that on the driver’s license.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
SCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE
At the end of the month, all postings to Accounts Receivable in the general ledger and 
to the accounts receivable ledger should be complete, as shown in Figure 10-18. At this 
point, the Accounts Receivable balance in the general ledger should equal the sum of 
the customer balances in the accounts receivable ledger.
To verify that the sum of the accounts receivable ledger balances equals the Accounts 
Receivable balance, a schedule of accounts receivable is prepared. This is an alphabetical 
or numerical listing of customer accounts and balances, usually prepared at the end of the 
month. Note that customers whose account balance is zero are not included. The schedule 
of accounts receivable for Northern Micro as of April 30 is illustrated in Figure 10-19.
This schedule is prepared from the list of customer accounts in the accounts receiv-
able ledger. The total calculated in the schedule is compared with the balance in 
Accounts Receivable in the general ledger. Note that the $14,331 total listed in the 
schedule equals the Accounts Receivable balance shown in Figure 10-18. If the sched-
ule total and the Accounts Receivable balance do not agree, the error must be located 
and corrected. To find the error, use the following procedures:
STEP 1 Verify the total of the schedule.
STEP 2 Verify the postings to the accounts receivable ledger.
STEP 3 Verify the postings to Accounts Receivable in the general ledger.
LO4 Prepare a schedule of 
accounts receivable.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES Key Points to Remember
LO1  Describe merchandise sales 
transactions.
A merchandising business buys and sells merchandise. Retailers generally 
make sales in the store. Important accounting documents are cash register 
tapes and sales tickets. Wholesalers generally ship merchandise to retailers. 
A key accounting document is the sales invoice. When customers return 
merchandise or obtain price adjustments, a credit memo is issued.
LO2  Describe and use merchandise 
sales accounts.
Four accounts are used in accounting for merchandise sales 
transactions.
1. Sales
2. Sales Tax Payable
3. Sales Returns and Allowances
4. Sales Discounts
LO3  Describe and use the accounts 
receivable ledger.
To post sales transactions to the general ledger, use these five steps.
In the general ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2  Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit 
column.
STEP 3  Enter the new balance in the Balance columns under Debit or 
Credit.
STEP 4  Enter the journal page number from which each transaction is 
posted in the Posting Reference column.
In the journal:
STEP 5  Enter the ledger account number in the Posting Reference 
column of the journal for each transaction that is posted.
An accounts receivable ledger is a separate ledger containing an indi-
vidual account receivable for each customer. To post sales transac-
tions to the accounts receivable ledger, use these five steps.
In the accounts receivable ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2  Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit 
column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance column.
STEP 4  Enter the journal page number from which each transaction is 
posted in the Posting Reference column.
In the journal:
STEP 5  Enter a slash (/) followed by a check mark (✓) in the Posting 
Reference column of the journal for each transaction that is posted.
To post cash receipts transactions to the general ledger, use these 
five steps.
In the general ledger account:
STEP 1  Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2  Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or 
Credit column.
STEP 3  Enter the new balance in the Balance columns under Debit or 
Credit.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
You and your spouse have separate charge accounts at a local department store. When 
you tried to use your card last week, you were told that you were over your credit 
limit. This puzzled you because you had paid the entire account balance several weeks 
ago. When the monthly statements arrived yesterday, the error was clear. The store had 
credited your payment to your spouse’s account.

392 
PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Your account was treated as over the limit, and the store charged you interest 
on the unpaid balance. You suspect that part of the problem is that you and your 
spouse use the same last name (Morales) and have similar first names (Carmen and 
Carmelo).
Write a letter to the store requesting correction of your accounts and suggesting a 
way to identify your accounts so that this error does not happen again.
ETHICS CASE
Wholesale Health Supply sells a variety of medical equipment and supplies to retailers. 
When a new retailer is approved for credit, one of the criteria is that the retailer must 
have been in business for at least six months. Good Earth Foods placed a large order 
with Wholesale Health Supply and requested credit terms. Wholesale Health Supply 
faxed a credit request form to Good Earth Foods, and the buyer at Good Earth Foods 
faxed the completed form back to Wholesale Health Supply. Robin Sylvester, the sales 
manager at Wholesale Health Supply, saw the credit application and noticed Good 
Earth Foods had only been in business for two months. Thinking she might lose the 
order if Good Earth Foods wasn’t extended credit, Robin authorized the shipment. She 
figured by the time the credit department rejected the application, Good Earth Foods 
would have received the order and the vice president would override the rejection to 
keep a new customer. Robin was sure that everything would turn out alright.
1. 
Do you think Robin’s decision to ship the order was unethical? Why or why not?
2. 
What would you have done if you were in Robin’s position?
3. 
 Write a memo from the credit department manager to Robin Sylvester explaining 
the reasoning behind requiring a new credit customer to be in business for at 
least six months.
4. 
In small groups, discuss ways to prevent a situation like this from happening.

the price of the cage which satisfied Warkentin.

Accounting for Purchases 
and Cash Payments
In Chapter 10, we heard about Planet Shoes, the company whose 
eco-friendly shoes refl ect a concern about the environment. Inno-
var Environmental is a diff erent kind of company that addresses 
environmental issues in a totally diff erent way. Innovar provides 
services to enable government and businesses to become green 
through construction and renovation. Its projects include lead 
paint, asbestos, and mold abatement; facilities demolition; site 
enhancements; green construction; natural disaster recovery; stor-
age tank removal, and more.
Innovar was founded in 2000 and is based in Littleton,  Colorado. 
It has benefi ted from the nationwide interest in going green, 
increasing its revenues in a recent four-year period by 400%, to $6.1 
million. You might recall that one of Planet Shoes’ biggest challeng-
es was accounting for its high volume of sales activity. In contrast, 
Innovar has far fewer but larger sales transactions. Its challenge is 
accounting for the many purchases of items used in its major con-
struction and renovation projects. In this chapter, you will learn how 
to account for purchases transactions, including various discounts, 
freight charges, and the return of items to the manufacturer.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter should 
enable you to:
LO1  Define merchandise 
purchases transactions.
LO2  Describe and use 
merchandise purchases 
accounts and compute gross 
profit.
LO3  Describe and use the 
accounts payable ledger.
LO4  Prepare a schedule of 
accounts payable.

MERCHANDISE PURCHASES TRANSACTIONS
In everyday language, purchases can refer to almost anything we have bought. For 
a merchandising business, however, purchases refers to merchandise acquired for 
resale. These are the goods a business buys for the sole purpose of selling them to its 
customers.
Purchasing procedures and documents vary, depending on the nature and size of 
a business. For example, in a small business, the owner or an employee might do the 
buying on a part-time basis. In a large business, there might be a separate purchasing 
department with a full-time manager and staff. In addition, the procedures and docu-
ments used can be affected by whether purchases are made on account or for cash.
The flowchart in Figure 11-1 shows some of the major documents used in the 
purchasing process of a merchandising business. In discussing the purchasing process, 
we will assume that the business makes purchases on account and has a purchasing 
department.
LO1 Define merchandise 
purchases 
transactions.
Chapter 10 demonstrated how to account for sales in a merchandising business. This chapter 
continues the study of the merchandising business by examining how to account for merchan-
dise purchases. We will learn how to use four new accounts and another subsidiary ledger.
FIGURE 11-1 Purchasing Process Documents
Purchase Requisition

PURCHASE REQUISITION
A purchase requisition is a form used to request the purchase of merchandise or other 
property. Any authorized person or department can prepare this form and submit it 
to the purchasing department. Figure 11-2 shows a purchase requisition used by 
Northern Micro. One copy of this form is sent to the purchasing department, one goes 
to the accounting department, and one is kept by the department that prepared the 
 requisition.
PURCHASE ORDER
The purchasing department reviews and approves the purchase requisition and pre-
pares a purchase order. A purchase order is a written order to buy goods from a spe-
cific vendor (supplier). Figure 11-3 shows a purchase order prepared by Northern 
Micro based on the purchase requisition in Figure 11-2. One copy of the purchase 
order is sent to the vendor to order the goods, one goes to the accounting department, 
and one copy is kept in the purchasing department. Other copies may be sent to the 
department that prepared the purchase requisition and to the receiving area.
When purchase orders are 
submitted electronically, 
signals are sent to the 
vendor and the accounting 
and purchasing departments 
at the same time.
In a computerized system, 
companies use electronic 
forms that are similar to the 
paper documents described 
in this chapter.

RECEIVING REPORT AND PURCHASE INVOICE
When the merchandise is received, a receiving report indicating what has been received 
is prepared. The receiving report can be a separate form, or one can be created from 
the vendor’s purchase invoice. Figure 11-4 shows a vendor invoice on which a rubber 
stamp has been used to imprint a type of receiving report. The receiving clerk has 
indicated on the form the date and condition of the goods received.
An invoice is a document prepared by the seller as a bill for the merchandise 
shipped. To the seller, this is a sales invoice, as explained in Chapter 10. To the buyer, 
this is a purchase invoice. Figure 11-4 shows an invoice sent by TTA Products to 
Northern Micro for the goods ordered with the purchase order in Figure 11-3.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
The accounting department compares the purchase invoice with the purchase 
requisition, purchase order, and receiving report. If the invoice is for the goods ordered 
and received and the correct price, the invoice is paid by the due date.
This is an example of good internal control. The procedure helps ensure that the 
business pays only for goods it ordered and received, and at the correct price.
CASH AND TRADE DISCOUNTS
Notice that the invoice in Figure 11-4 shows terms of 2/10, n/30. These are the same 
credit terms discussed in Chapter 10. A discount is available if the bill is paid within 
the discount period. The only difference is that we are now looking from the buyer’s 
point of view rather than the seller’s. We will see how to account for these discounts 
later in the chapter.
Another type of discount, called a trade discount, is often offered by manufactur-
ers and wholesalers. This discount is a reduction from the list or catalog price offered 
to different classes of customers. By simply adjusting the trade discount percentages, 
companies can avoid the cost of reprinting catalogs every time there is a change in 
prices. Trade discounts are usually shown as a deduction from the total amount of the 
invoice. For example, the invoice in Figure 11-5 includes a trade discount of 10%. The 
amount to be entered in the accounting records for this invoice is $756, the net 
amount after deducting the trade discount of $84. Trade discounts represent a reduc-
tion in the price of the merchandise and should not be entered in the accounts of either 
the seller or the buyer.
We need to be careful in computing the cash discount when an invoice has both 
cash and trade discounts. The cash discount applies to the net amount after deducting 
the trade discount. For example, the cash discount and amount to be paid on the 
invoice in Figure 11-5 would be calculated as follows:
Gross amount 
$840.00
Less 10% trade discount 
  84.00
Net amount 
$756.00
Less 2% cash discount 
  15.12
Amount to be paid 
$740.88
FIGURE 11-4 Purchase Invoice
LEARNING KEY
Purchases and sales subject to 
trade discounts should be record-
ed in the accounting records at 
the net amount after deducting 
the trade discounts.

2. Purchases Returns and Allowances
3. Purchases Discounts
4. Freight-In
The position of these accounts in the accounting equation and their normal bal-

PURCHASES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ACCOUNT
Purchases Returns and Allowances is a contra-cost (or contra-purchases) account, 
which has a credit balance and is deducted from the related cost account. Purchases 
returns and purchases allowances are credited to this account. It is reported as a 
deduction from Purchases on the income statement to compute net purchases (see 
Figure 11-7 on page 407).

Purchases returns and allowances are similar to the sales returns and allowances 
we discussed in Chapter 10. We are simply looking at returns and allowances from the 
buyer’s point of view. If merchandise is returned to a supplier, or the supplier grants a 
price reduction because of defects or other problems with merchandise purchased, 
Purchases Returns and Allowances is credited.
If merchandise that was purchased on account for $200 is defective and is returned 
to the supplier, the following entry is made:

is as follows:

Note the parts of this entry. Accounts Payable is debited for $100, the full amount 
of the invoice, because the entire debt has been satisfied. Cash is credited for only $98 
because that is all that was required to pay the debt. The difference of $2 ($100 – $98) 
is credited to Purchases Discounts, which represents a reduction in the purchase price 
of the merchandise. That is why Purchases Discounts is deducted from Purchases on 
the income statement.
This approach to 
accounting for purchases 
discounts is known as 
the “gross-price method.” 
The “net-price method” is 
described in the appendix.
FREIGHT-IN ACCOUNT
Freight-In is an adjunct-purchases account used to record transportation charges 
on merchandise purchases. It is added to net purchases on the income statement to 
compute cost of goods purchased (see Figure 11-7).
A BROADER VIEW
Cash Management—Those Discounts 
Matter
If a business makes a $2,000 purchase on account, with terms 
of 2/10, n/30, the available discount is only $40 ($2,000 × 0.02). 
On the surface, this seems unimportant, like “small change.” But 
take a closer look. If the business does not pay $1,960 ($2,000 – 
$40) within 10 days, it must pay $2,000 within 30 days. This 
means that the business would pay $40 for the use of $1,960 
for 20 more days. If we assume a 360-day year, the approximate 
annual interest rate for using the $1,960 for 20 days is 36%. 
The innocent looking 2% 
cash discount represents a very 
high rate of interest. If a business 
regularly misses cash discount 
opportunities, the annual dollar 
cost can be substantial. For sound 
cash management, take advan-
tage of discounts.

In Chapter 17, we discuss 
how to compute inter-
est. There you will learn to 
 compute the exact interest 
rate.

Transportation charges are expressed in FOB (free on board) terms that indicate 
who is responsible for paying the freight costs. FOB shipping point means that trans-
portation charges are paid by the buyer. FOB destination means that transportation 
charges are paid by the seller. FOB terms also tell us who owns the inventory and who 
should count it in their inventory account. Under FOB shipping point, the buyer owns 
the inventory as soon as it is shipped and should count it in inventory. Under FOB 
destination, the seller owns the inventory until it is delivered to the buyer and should 
count it in inventory.
When the terms are FOB shipping point, either the freight charges will be listed 
separately on the purchase invoice or a separate freight bill will be sent. Assume 
Northern Micro receives an invoice for $400 plus freight charges of $38. The entry for 
this purchase is as follows:

Assume instead that Northern Micro receives an invoice for $400 for the same 
merchandise, shipped FOB shipping point. Northern Micro then receives a separate 
bill from the transportation company for $38. These two transactions are entered as 
follows:
When the terms are FOB destination, generally no freight charges appear on the 
purchase invoice. The buyer simply records the purchase at the amount of the invoice. 
The freight-in account is not used in recording this purchase.
COMPUTATION OF GROSS PROFIT
An important step in determining net income for a merchandising business is the cal-
culation of its gross profit. Gross profit (also called gross margin) is the difference 
between net sales and cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold (also called cost of mer-
chandise sold) is the difference between the goods available for sale and the ending 
Net purchases

inventory. It indicates the cost of the goods sold during the period. Gross profit pro-
vides very important information. It tells management the amount of sales dollars 
available to cover expenses, after covering the cost of the goods sold.
As a simple example, gross profit is computed as follows:
Net sales 
$8,400
Cost of goods sold 
 5,300
Gross profit 
$3,100
In a more realistic situation, we must compute net sales and cost of goods sold, in 
order to compute gross profit. Multiple steps are involved. To illustrate, we use three 
of the four new accounts described in Chapter 10, the four new accounts described in 
this chapter, and the merchandise inventory balances. Assume that Northern Micro 
has the following sales, purchases, and merchandise inventory balances for the year 
ended December 31, 20--:

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
POSTING PURCHASES TO THE GENERAL 
LEDGER
Purchases transactions are posted from the general journal to the general ledger in the 
same manner as was illustrated for sales in Chapter 10. The following steps are used, as 
indicated in Figure 11-9 for Northern Micro’s April 4 and 8 purchases transactions:
In the general ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance columns under Debit or Credit.
STEP 4  Enter the journal page number from which each transaction is posted in the 
Posting Reference column.
In the journal:
STEP 5  Enter the ledger account number in the Posting Reference column of the 
journal for each transaction that is posted.
Other purchases transactions would be posted in the same manner.
POSTING PURCHASES TO THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE LEDGER
The Purchases and Accounts Payable resulting from merchandise purchases on 
account are now up to date in the general ledger. A record can be kept of the amount 
owed to each supplier by using an accounts payable ledger. This is a separate ledger 
containing an individual account payable for each supplier. It is similar to the accounts 
receivable ledger we saw in Chapter 10. A summary accounts payable account called

a controlling account is maintained in the general ledger. The accounts payable ledger 
is “subsidiary” to this account. If there are many supplier accounts, it is a good practice 
to assign each supplier an account number. The subsidiary ledger accounts are kept in 
either alphabetical or numerical order, depending on whether the supplier accounts are 
identified by number.
Figure 11-10 illustrates the use of the accounts payable ledger for Northern 
Micro’s April 4 and 8 purchases transactions. Note that the individual vendor name 
follows accounts payable in each journal entry affecting Accounts Payable.The follow-
ing steps are used to post from the general journal to the accounts payable ledger, as 
shown in Figure 11-10:
In the accounts payable ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance column.
STEP 4  Enter the journal page number from which each transaction is posted in the 
Posting Reference column.
In the journal:
STEP 5  Enter a slash (/) followed by a check mark (✓) in the Posting Reference 
column of the journal for each transaction that is posted.

A three-column account form 
is commonly used for supplier 
accounts. Only one balance 
column is needed because 
the normal balance is a credit. 
If a debit balance occurs, the 
amount may be bracketed.
LEARNING KEY
When an accounts payable ledger 
is used, the Posting Reference col-
umn in the general journal serves 
two purposes. (1) The account 
number is inserted to indicate the 
general ledger account has been 
posted. (2) A slash (/) and a check 
mark (✓) are inserted to indicate 
the accounts payable ledger 
account has been posted.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Note the relationship between the general journal, accounts payable ledger, and 
general ledger. All general journal entries are posted to both the general ledger and the 
accounts payable ledger. After the posting of the accounts payable ledger and general 
ledger is completed, the total of the accounts payable ledger balances should equal the 
Accounts Payable balance in the general ledger.
PURCHASES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES
If a buyer returns merchandise or is given an allowance for damaged merchandise, a 
general journal entry is required. Assume that on May 4, Northern Micro returns 
$200 of merchandise to Televax, Inc. These goods were part of a purchase made on 
April 23. Figure 11-11 shows the general journal entry, general ledger posting, and 
accounts payable ledger posting for this transaction.
The general journal entry is made in the usual manner. The general ledger is posted 
using the same five steps as were illustrated for purchases transactions in Figure 11-9. 
The accounts payable ledger is posted using the following five steps, as illustrated in 
Figure 11-11:
In the accounts payable ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance column.
STEP 4  Enter the journal page number from which each transaction is posted in the 
Posting Reference column.
In the journal:
STEP 5  Enter a slash (/) followed by a check mark (✓) in the Posting Reference col-
umn of the journal for each transaction that is posted.

To verify that the sum of the accounts payable ledger balances equals the Accounts 
Payable balance, a schedule of accounts payable is prepared. This is an alphabetical or 
numerical listing of supplier accounts and balances, usually prepared at the end of the 
month. Figure 11-15 shows the schedule of accounts payable for Northern Micro as 
of April 30. Note that suppliers whose account balance is zero are not included.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
MANAGING YOUR WRITING
You are working as a summer intern at a rapidly growing organic food distributor. Part 
of your responsibility is to assist in the accounts payable department. You notice that 
most bills from suppliers are not paid within the discount period. The manager of 
accounts payable says the bills are organized by vendor, like the accounts payable 
ledger, and she is too busy to keep track of the discount periods. Besides, the owner has 
told her that the 1% and 2% discounts available are not worth worrying about.
Write a memo to the owner explaining why it is expensive not to take advantage 
of cash discounts on credit purchases. In addition, suggest a way to file (organize) sup-
plier invoices so that they are paid within the discount period.
ETHICS CASE
Bob’s Discount Auto Parts receives a cash discount of 2% from Auto Warehouse if it 
pays an invoice within 10 days. Bob, the owner, consistently sends payments 15 to 20 
days after receiving the invoice and still deducts the amount of the discount. Last week, 
Bob received a call from Auto Warehouse reminding him that in order to get the dis-
count, an invoice must be paid within 10 days. When Bob received the next invoice, he 
dated the check exactly 10 days from the date of the invoice but didn’t mail the check 
for another week. The receivables manager from Auto Warehouse called Bob and again 
reminded him that the check should be mailed by the 10th day in order to receive the 
2% discount. When Bob received the next invoice, he mailed it on time but post-dated 
the check for the following week.
1. Are Bob’s attempts to extend the discount period unethical?
2. What alternatives can Auto Warehouse take to prevent Bob’s Discount Auto 
Parts from stretching the discount period?
3. Write a short note from Auto Warehouse to Bob’s Discount Auto Parts 
explaining cash discounts and credit terms.
4. In small groups, make a list of the advantages and disadvantages of offering cash 
discounts.

NET-PRICE METHOD
In this chapter, purchases were recorded 
using the gross-price method. Under this 
method, purchases are recorded at the 
gross amount, regardless of available cash 
discounts. An alternative approach to 
accounting for purchases is the net-price 
method. Under this method, purchases are 
recorded at the net amount, assuming that 
all available cash discounts will be taken.
RECORDING WITH THE NET-PRICE METHOD
To compare the gross-price and net-price methods, reconsider the purchase for $100 
on account, with credit terms of 2/10, n/30, on page 403. At the time of the purchase, 
the following entries are made under the two methods:

method of recording 
purchases.
LO2 Record purchases and 
cash payments using 
the net-price method.

Special Journals
If you are an active health and fi tness enthusiast, you might already 
know of NewHealth Nutrition, perhaps through its nutraplanet.com 
Web site. NewHealth Nutrition was founded in 2001 in Fayetteville, 
Georgia. In 2004, after a slow start operating from a traditional 
storefront, the company began selling on the Internet and the busi-
ness took off . In the last four years, sales have quadrupled to more 
than $4 million.
NewHealth Nutrition sells a wide array of sports nutrition and 
health supplements. Many are targeted at bodybuilding, but its prod-
uct categories include amino acids, carbohydrates, cardiovascular sup-
port, fat burners, herbs, joint support, and many others. Its products 
tend to be priced in the $13−$70 range. Most of the sales for a com-
pany like this probably would be for relatively small dollar amounts. 
This means the volume of transactions to generate annual sales of 
$4 million would be huge. NewHealth Nutrition would need a way to 
record all of this activity that is more effi  cient than the methods we have 
seen in Chapters 10 and 11. In Chapter 12, you will learn about a more 
effi  cient way to record transactions. In the “A Broader View Feature,” 
you will see how computer software can add even greater effi  ciency.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter should 
enable you to:
LO1  Describe, explain the 
purpose of, and identify 
transactions recorded in 
special journals.
LO2  Describe and use the sales

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
SPECIAL JOURNALS
A special journal is a journal designed for recording only certain kinds of transactions. 
A special journal can be created for almost any kind of transaction. The types of special 
journals a business uses should depend on the types of transactions that occur most 
frequently for a business. The more transactions of a specific type that occur, the more 
likely a special journal of that type would be useful for the business.
The primary purpose of using special journals is to save time journalizing and 
posting transactions. In a general journal, we recorded transactions by writing the 
account names, debit and credit amounts, and an explanation for each transaction on 
several lines in the journal. In contrast, most transactions are entered in a special jour-
nal on a single line, with the debit and credit amounts indicated in special columns 
provided for each account. This enables substantial time saving. The posting process 
also is more efficient. Using the general journal, each transaction is posted separately 
to the appropriate general ledger accounts. With a special journal, summary postings 
of column totals are made to appropriate accounts on a periodic basis.
Of course, even if a business uses special journals, there still is a need for a general 
journal. For example, transactions that occur infrequently, and adjusting and closing 
entries, usually are recorded in the general journal.
Four special journals commonly used by businesses are as follows:
Sales journal
• 
Cash receipts journal
• 
Purchases journal
• 
Cash payments journal
• 
Figure 12-1 identifies the types of transactions recorded in each of the four special 
journals and the general journal. You might find it helpful to refer back to Figure 12-1 
as the four special journals are introduced in this chapter.
LO1 Describe, explain 
the purpose of, and 
identify transactions 
recorded in special 
journals.
Chapters 10 and 11 demonstrated how to account for sales, cash receipts, purchases, and cash 
payments in a merchandising business. We also saw how to use accounts receivable and accounts 
payable ledgers to keep track of individual customer and supplier accounts. In this chapter, we 
continue to study how to account for sales, cash receipts, purchases, and cash payments, but our 
objective is to fi nd a way to be more effi  cient. We will learn how to use four special journals that 
enable us to achieve this objective.
LEARNING KEY
The special journals and general 
journal are books of original entry. 
Each transaction is recorded in 
only one of these journals.

In the following sections, we will examine the journalizing and posting process using 
each of the four special journals.
SALES JOURNAL
A sales journal is a special journal used to record only sales of merchandise on account. 
To illustrate the journalizing and posting of sales transactions in the sales journal, we 
use the following five sales transactions for Northern Micro from Chapter 10.
LO2 Describe and use the 
sales journal.
 
Apr.  4 
Made Sale No. 133C on account to Enrico Lorenzo, $1,520, plus $76 sales tax.

Made Sale No. 134C on account to Brenda Myers, $440, plus $22 sales tax.
 
18 
Made Sale No. 105D on account to Edith Walton, $980, plus $49 sales tax.
 
21 
Made Sale No. 202B on account to Susan Chang, $620, plus $31 sales tax.
 
24 
Made Sale No. 162A on account to Heidi Schwitzer, $1,600, plus $80 sales tax.
The general journal entries for these five transactions are shown in Figure 12-2.

FIGURE 12-2 Sales Entered in General Journal
Notice that each of these five entries involved the same three accounts. The same 
account titles were recorded five times. Similarly, to post these entries to the general 
ledger, five separate postings would be made to each of the three accounts, a total of 
15 postings.
These transactions can be recorded more efficiently by using a sales journal. To 
illustrate, reconsider the five sales made on account by Northern Micro. They are 
entered in the sales journal in Figure 12-3. The sales journal provides separate columns 
for Accounts Receivable Debit, Sales Credit, and Sales Tax Payable Credit, the three

accounts used repeatedly in the general journal in Figure 12-2. A sale is recorded in 
the sales journal by entering the following information:
1. Date
2. Sale number
3. Customer (to whom sold)
4. Dollar amounts
There is no need to enter any general ledger account titles, since they appear in the 
column headings.
Remember that sales 
returns and allowances are 
recorded in the general 
journal, as illustrated in 
Chapter 10, not in the 
sales journal.

This chapter illustrates a 
manual accounting system. 
With a computerized sys-
tem, journals/ledgers can be 
updated simultaneously when 
a transaction is entered. (see 
A Broader View on p, 450).
The sales journal in Figure 12-3 is designed for a company, like Northern Micro, 
that charges sales tax. For a wholesaler or any other company that does not charge 
sales tax, a sales journal like that in Figure 12-4 would be sufficient. In this case, there 
is only a single amount column headed Accounts Receivable Debit/Sales Credit. With 
no sales tax, the Accounts Receivable Debit and Sales Credit amounts are identical for 
each sale. Thus, only a single column is needed.

Step 1 is the main difference 
in posting the sales journal 
to the general ledger. The 
remaining steps 2–6 are 
essentially the same as 
steps 1–5 used to post 
from the general journal.
POSTING FROM THE SALES JOURNAL
Posting from the sales journal also is very efficient. Each general ledger account used in 
the sales journal requires only one posting each period. Figure 12-5 illustrates the gen-
eral ledger posting process for Northern Micro’s sales journal for the month of April.
The following steps are used to post from the sales journal to the general ledger 
at the end of each month, as indicated in Figure 12-5:
In the sales journal:
STEP 1  Total the amount columns, verify that the total of the debit column equals 
the total of the credit columns, and rule the columns.
In the ledger account:
STEP 2 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 3  Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.

STEP 4 Enter the new balance in the Balance columns under Debit or Credit.
STEP 5  Enter the initial “S” and the journal page number in the Posting Reference 
column.
In the sales journal:
STEP 6  Enter the ledger account number immediately below the column totals for 
each account that is posted.
As we saw in Chapter 10, Northern Micro also needs a record of the accounts 
receivable from individual customers. Figure 12-6 illustrates the use of the accounts 
receivable ledger. The accounts receivable ledger is posted daily so that current 
information is available for each customer at all times. The following steps are used to 
post the sales journal to the accounts receivable ledger, as shown in Figure 12-6:

In the accounts receivable ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance column.
STEP 4  Enter the initial “S” and the journal page number in the Posting Reference 
column.
In the sales journal:
STEP 5  Enter a check mark (3) in the Posting Reference column of the journal for 
each transaction that is posted.
The accounts receivable ledger also can be posted from the source document used 
to make the sales journal entry. For example, sales ticket #134C (see Figure 10-2) 
could be used to post that sale to Brenda Myers’ account in the accounts receivable 
ledger. In this case, 134C would be inserted in the Posting Reference column of her 
account.
Note the relationship between the sales journal, accounts receivable ledger, 
and general ledger. All individual entries in the sales journal are posted to the 
accounts receivable ledger. The totals of all entries in the sales journal are posted to the 
general ledger accounts. After the posting of the accounts receivable ledger and 
the general ledger is completed, the total of the accounts receivable ledger balances 
should equal the Accounts Receivable balance in the general ledger.
If the accounts receivable 
ledger is posted daily and 
the general ledger is posted 
at the end of the month, the 
accounts receivable ledger 
total will equal the general 
ledger Accounts Receivable 
total only at the end of the 
month.
LEARNING KEY
The total of the accounts receiv-
able ledger balances must equal 
the Accounts Receivable balance 
in the general ledger.

CASH RECEIPTS JOURNAL
A cash receipts journal is a special journal used to record only cash receipts transac-
tions. To illustrate its use, we continue with the transactions of Northern Micro. 
Northern Micro’s cash receipts journal for the month of April is shown in Figure 12-7, 
with the following transactions:
LO3 Describe and use the 
cash receipts journal.
 
Apr. 14 
Received cash on account from Enrico Lorenzo for Sale No. 133C, $1,596.
 
20 
Received cash on account from Brenda Myers for Sale No. 134C, $462.
 
28 
Received cash on account from Edith Walton for Sale No. 105D, $1,029.
 
30 
Made cash sales for the month of $3,600 plus tax of $180.

 Made bank credit card sales for the month of $2,500 plus tax of $125. Bank credit 
card expenses on these sales are $100.
 
30 
Received cash for rent revenue, $600.

Borrowed cash from the bank by signing a note, $3,000.
Northern Micro’s cash receipts journal provides separate columns for Accounts 
Receivable Credit, Sales Credit, Sales Tax Payable Credit, Bank Credit Card Expense 
Debit, and Cash Debit. These are the accounts most frequently affected by Northern

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Micro’s cash receipts transactions. In addition, a General Credit column is provided 
for credits to any other accounts affected by cash receipts transactions.
A cash receipt is recorded in the cash receipts journal by entering the following 
information:
1. Date
2. Account credited (if applicable)
3. Dollar amounts
The Account Credited column is used for two purposes.
1.  To identify the customer name for any collection on account. This column is 
used whenever the Accounts Receivable Credit column is used.
2.  To enter the appropriate account name whenever the General Credit column is used.
The Account Credited column is left blank whenever the entry is for cash sales or 
bank credit card sales.
The cash receipts journal in Figure 12-7 is designed for a company like Northern 
Micro, which charges sales tax, makes bank credit card sales, and offers no cash dis-
counts. For a wholesaler that does not charge sales tax, makes no bank credit card 
sales, and offers cash discounts, a cash receipts journal like the one in Figure 12-8 
would be used. Recall that a special journal should be designed with column headings 
for frequently used accounts. Thus, the cash receipts journal in Figure 12-8 has no 
Sales Tax Payable Credit or Bank Credit Card Expense Debit column. Instead, a Sales 
Discounts Debit column is provided. In this way, the common cash receipts transac-
tions of the wholesaler can be easily and efficiently recorded.

ing of cash receipts.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
PURCHASES JOURNAL
A purchases journal is a special journal used to record only purchases of merchandise 
on account. To illustrate the journalizing and posting of purchases transactions in 
the purchases journal, we continue with the transactions of Northern Micro. The fol-
lowing five purchases on account are from Chapter 11:

As we saw with sales transactions, these purchases transactions can be recorded 
efficiently in a special journal, in this case a purchases journal. To illustrate, the five 
purchases on account of Northern Micro are entered in the purchases journal in 
Figure 12-11. Northern Micro’s purchases journal has a single column for Purchases 
Debit/Accounts Payable Credit, the two accounts used repeatedly when these

A BROADER VIEW
Improving Efficiency—The Power of 
Computerized Bookkeeping
In this chapter, we see many examples of the ways in which 
special journals can make the bookkeeping process more 
efficient. Yet, these efficiency gains pale by comparison with 
the power of computerized bookkeeping. By means of a single 
keyboard entry, journals, general and subsidiary ledgers, 
customer and supplier accounts, periodic financial reports, 
and more can be updated. You can even pay bills when due 
electronically as part of the system.
 Some good examples of computerized bookkeeping soft-
ware are Peachtree® and QuickBooks®. Both of these software 
packages utilize the one entry-many reports feature. The user 
makes entries using the keyboard; then the system tracks the 
effects on the financial status of the business. The software can 
analyze accounts receivable and accounts payable, process 
payroll, print checks, and track expenses by vendor and revenues 
by customer. It can also produce income statements and 
balance sheets. It is even possible to customize the programs 
to match different business types.

 transactions are recorded in a general journal. A purchase is recorded in the purchases 
journal by entering the following information:
1. Date
2. Invoice number
3. Supplier (from whom purchased)
4. Dollar amount
There is no need to enter any general ledger account titles, since they appear in the 
column heading.
The purchases journal in Figure 12-11 is designed for a company like Northern 
Micro, whose suppliers generally pay freight charges. For a company that frequently 
pays freight charges as part of the purchase price of merchandise, a purchases journal 
like the one in Figure 12-12 would be used. In this case, there are three columns: 
(1) Purchases Debit, (2) Freight-In Debit, and (3) Accounts Payable Credit.
Remember that purchases 
returns and allowances are 
recorded in the general 
journal, as illustrated in 
Chapter 11, not in the 
purchases journal.

POSTING FROM THE PURCHASES JOURNAL
Each general ledger account used in the purchases journal requires only one posting 
each period. Figure 12-13 illustrates the general ledger posting process for Northern 
Micro’s purchases journal for the month of April.
The following steps are used to post from the purchases journal to the general 
ledger at the end of each month, as indicated in Figure 12-13:
In the purchases journal:
STEP 1 Total and rule the amount column.
In the general ledger account:
STEP 2 Enter the date in the Date column.
STEP 3 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 4 Enter the new balance in the Balance columns under Debit or Credit.
STEP 5  Enter the initial “P” and the journal page number in the Posting Reference 
column.
Step 1 is the main difference 
in posting the purchases 
journal to the general ledger. 
The remaining steps 2–6 
are essentially the same as 
steps 1–5 used to post the 
general journal.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
In the purchases journal:
STEP 6  Enter the Purchases and Accounts Payable account numbers immediately 
below the column total.
To maintain a record of the amount owed to each supplier, an accounts payable 
ledger is used. Figure 12-14 illustrates the use of the accounts payable ledger. The fol-
lowing steps are used to post from the purchases journal to the accounts payable 
ledger daily, as shown in Figure 12-14:
In the accounts payable ledger account:
STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance column.
STEP 4  Enter the initial “P” and the journal page number in the Posting Reference column.
In the purchases journal:
STEP 5  Enter a check mark (✓) in the Posting Reference column of the journal for 
each transaction that is posted.
After the posting of the accounts payable ledger and general ledger is completed, 
the total of the accounts payable ledger balances should equal the Accounts Payable 
balance in the general ledger.

If the accounts payable 
ledger is posted daily and 
the general ledger is posted 
at the end of the month, the 
accounts payable ledger 
total will equal the general 
ledger Accounts Payable 
total only at the end of the 
month.

CASH PAYMENTS JOURNAL
A cash payments journal is a special journal used to record only cash payments trans-
actions. To illustrate its use, we will record the cash payments transactions of Northern 
Micro. Northern Micro’s cash payments journal for the month of April is shown in 
Figure 12-15. Five types of cash payments transactions are shown as follows:
1. Payment of an expense (April 2)
2. Cash purchase (April 4)
3. Payment of an account payable (April 10 and 24)
4. Payment of a note payable (April 14)
5. Withdrawal by the owner (April 22)
LO5 Describe and use the 
cash payments journal.

FIGURE 12-15 Northern Micro Cash Payments Journal
Northern Micro’s cash payments journal provides separate columns for Accounts 
Payable Debit, Purchases Debit, Purchases Discounts Credit, and Cash Credit. These 
are the accounts most frequently affected by Northern Micro’s cash payments transac-
tions. In addition, a General Debit column is provided for debits to any other accounts 
affected by cash payments transactions. For good internal control over cash payments, 
all payments (except out of petty cash) should be made by check. Therefore, the cash 
payments journal also includes a Check No. column.
A cash payment is recorded in the cash payments journal by entering the following 
information:
1. Date
2. Check number
3. Account debited (if applicable)
4. Dollar amounts
The Account Debited column is used for two purposes:
1.  To identify the supplier name for any payment on account. This column is used 
whenever the Accounts Payable Debit column is used.
2.  To enter the appropriate account name whenever the General Debit column 
is used.
Note that the column is left blank if the entry is for cash purchases.
LEARNING KEY
Use a cash payments journal to 
streamline journalizing and post-
ing of cash payments.

Posting from the Cash Payments Journal
The cash payments journal is posted to the general ledger in two stages, as illustrated 
in Figure 12-16. First, on a daily basis, the individual amounts in the General Debit

amount columns are posted.
To post the General Debit column, on a daily basis, the following steps 
are used:

STEP 1 Enter the date of the transaction in the Date column.
STEP 2 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 3 Enter the new balance in the Balance columns under Debit or Credit.
STEP 4  Enter the initials “CP” and the journal page number in the Posting 
Reference column.
In the cash payments journal:
STEP 5  Enter the ledger account number in the Posting Reference column for each 
account that is posted.
To post the other amount columns, at the end of the month, the following steps 
are used:
In the cash payments journal:
STEP 6  Total the amount columns, verify that the total of the debit columns equals 
the total of the credit columns, and rule the columns.
In the general ledger account:
STEP 7 Enter the date in the Date column.
STEP 8 Enter the amount of the debit or credit in the Debit or Credit column.
STEP 9 Enter the new balance in the Balance columns under Debit or Credit.

each account that is posted.
STEP 12  Enter a check mark (✓) in the Posting Reference column for the cash pur-
chases, and immediately below the General Debit column.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
You have a part-time job as a bookkeeper at a local office supply store. The accounting 
records consist of a general journal and general ledger. The manager is concerned about 
efficiency and feels that too much time is spent recording transactions. In addition, 
there sometimes is difficulty determining the amount owed to specific suppliers. The 
manager knows you are an accounting student and asks for your suggestions to 
improve the accounting function.
Write a memo to the manager describing how to increase efficiency and accuracy 
by using different accounting records.
ETHICS CASE
Judy Baresford, the store manager of Comfort Futons, noticed that the amount of time 
the two bookkeepers were spending on accounts receivable, accounts payable, and cash 
receipts was increasing due to the store’s increase in sales. A friend of Judy’s who is also 
a store manager suggested that she might want to have some special journals designed 
that would reduce the amount of work involved in the day-to-day bookkeeping at her 
store. Judy approached Jon Fortner and Sue Stavio, the bookkeepers, and asked them

to come up with a proposal for special journals. During lunch, Jon told Sue he thought 
designing special journals would be a lot of work and it was not in his job description. 
Sue told him not to worry because she would just copy pages of special journals from 
her accounting textbook and they could submit these journals as their own design. Jon 
liked the idea and they agreed to meet the next night, scan the journals into Word, and 
submit them to Judy the following morning.
1. Do you think Sue’s suggestion is unethical? Why or why not?
2. In using the generic special journals from Sue’s accounting textbook, what pos-
sible problems can you foresee?
3. If you were Judy, how would you respond to Sue and Jon’s “plan”?

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter should 
enable you to:
LO1  Explain the impact of 
merchandise inventory on 
the financial statements.
LO2  Describe the two principal 
systems of accounting for 
merchandise inventory—the 
periodic system and the 
perpetual system.
LO3  Compute the costs allocated 
to the ending inventory and 
cost of goods sold using 
different inventory methods.
LO4  Estimate the ending inventory 
and cost of goods sold by 
using the gross profit and 
retail inventory methods.
Accounting for 
Merchandise Inventory
With 11,000 employees serving 2 million customers weekly, 
Marsh operates 99 Marsh Supermarkets and fi ve O’Malia’s Food 
Markets in Indiana and Ohio. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Marsh 
also has 41 pharmacy locations, the largest pharmacy chain based 
in the state of Indiana. Known for its use of technology, Marsh has 
the distinction of being the fi rst grocery store in the world to use 
electronic scanners to ring up purchases.
As you walk through a grocery store, have you ever wondered 
what the store paid for each item? It would be nice to know which 
items are “good buys” and which are “overpriced.” What happens 
when management pays diff erent amounts for identical products 
on the shelf? In this chapter, you will learn how merchandising 
fi rms determine which items were sold and which remain. That is, 
how they determine the cost of the goods sold and the cost of the 
goods remaining on the shelves at the end of the year.

For a merchandising business, the cost of goods available for sale ($100) during the 
accounting period must be divided between cost of goods sold ($70) and ending mer-
chandise inventory ($30). In Chapter 11, the costs assigned to these accounts were 
provided. In this chapter, you will learn how to determine the dollar amounts assigned 
to cost of goods sold and ending merchandise inventory. In Chapter 14, we will illus-
trate the end-of-period adjustments required to bring the cost of goods sold and 
merchandise inventory accounts up to date to reflect their proper balances.
THE IMPACT OF MERCHANDISE INVENTORY 
ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A company’s ending inventory must be reported accurately. An error in the reported 
inventory will cause errors on the income statement, statement of owner’s equity, and 
balance sheet. In addition, since this year’s ending inventory becomes next year’s begin-
ning inventory, financial statements for the following year will also contain errors.
Figure 13-1 illustrates the impact of an error in the ending inventory. The first pair 
of columns presents partial financial statements when the ending inventory is correct. 
For this illustration, sales, cost of goods sold, and operating expenses are assumed to 
be the same for 20-1 and 20-2. Thus, the same net income of $30 and beginning and 
ending merchandise inventories of $20 are reported for both years.
The second pair of columns in Figure 13-1 illustrates the effects of understating 
the ending inventory. Understating the ending inventory for 20-1 by $5 causes the cost 
of goods sold to be overstated by $5 and net income to be understated by $5. Since 
net income is reported on the statement of owner’s equity, Erv Bultman’s capital on 
December 31 is understated by $5. The understated capital also appears in the owner’s 
equity section of the balance sheet. The understated ending inventory is reported in the 
current assets section of the balance sheet.
Even if the ending inventory for 20-2 is accurately reported, we still have a problem 
with the income statement. Since the ending inventory for 20-1 was understated, the 
beginning inventory for 20-2 is understated also ($15 instead of $20). This error causes 
cost of goods sold to be understated by $5 and net income to be overstated by $5.
LO1 Explain the impact of 
merchandise inventory 
on the financial 
statements.
In Chapters 10 and 11, you learned how to account for the purchase and sale of merchandise. One 
of the major reasons for keeping accounting records is to determine the net income (or net loss) of 
a business. A major component of net income is the gross profi t. In Chapter 11, you learned how 
to compute gross profi t. An abbreviated form of this calculation is shown below.
LEARNING KEY
If the ending inventory for 20-1 is 
understated, net income for 20-1 
is understated and net income 
for 20-2 is overstated.
The terms goods and 
merchandise mean the 
same thing and are used 
interchangeably.
This year’s ending inventory 
becomes next year’s 
beginning inventory.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
At this point, we can see that this inventory error “washes out” over the two-year 
period. The understated net income for 20-1 is offset by overstated net income in 20-2. 
Thus, Bultman’s capital account as of December 31, 20-2, is reported accurately on 
the statement of owner’s equity and balance sheet at $160. Assuming no future inven-
tory errors, the financial statements for 20-3 and thereafter will be correct.
The third pair of columns in Figure 13-1 illustrates the effects of overstating the 
ending inventory in 20-1. This causes net income to be overstated in 20-1 and under-
stated in 20-2. As previously discussed, these errors “wash out” by the end of 20-2. 
Thus, Bultman’s capital account is correct in the 20-2 financial statements.
It is very important to have an accurate count and valuation for the ending 
inventory. Since errors in the ending inventory have a direct effect on net income for 
the period, managers may be tempted to manipulate this amount to achieve a desired 
result: to either increase net income to make the company look good, or decrease net 
income to reduce taxes or smooth earnings. For this reason, observing and verifying 
the ending inventory is an important aspect of an external auditor’s job.

TYPES OF INVENTORY SYSTEMS: PERIODIC 
AND PERPETUAL
The two principal systems of accounting for merchandise inventory are the periodic 
and the perpetual systems. Entries made for inventory transactions under these sys-
tems are illustrated in Figure 13-2. Chapter 11 illustrated the periodic inventory 
system. As shown in Figure 13-2, under the periodic inventory system, no entries are 
made to the merchandise inventory or cost of goods sold account during the year. 
Thus, the balance in the merchandise inventory account is based on the physical count 
of inventory taken at the end of the last accounting period. The merchandise inventory 
and the cost of goods sold for the current period are not determined until the end of 
the current accounting period, when a physical inventory is taken. At that time, the 
following formula is applied to calculate cost of goods sold.
Beginning Inventory (based on last year’s ending physical count)
+   Net Purchases (account balance at end of this year)
=   Cost of Goods Available for Sale
–   Ending Inventory (based on this year’s ending physical count)
=   Cost of Goods Sold (for this year)
Adjusting entries are needed at the end of the fiscal year to update the merchandise 
inventory account and cost of goods sold. These entries are illustrated in Chapter 14.
LO2 Describe the two 
principal systems of 
accounting for 
merchandise 
inventory—the 
periodic system and 
the perpetual system.
LEARNING KEY
Under the periodic inventory sys-
tem, the ending inventory and 
cost of goods sold are determined 
at the end of the accounting 
period, when a physical inventory 
is taken.
LEARNING KEY
Under the perpetual inventory 
system, cost of goods sold and the 
amount of merchandise inventory 
on hand are continually updated 
as merchandise is bought and 
sold.

6. Paid for merchandise costing $100. The supplier
 
granted a 2% discount for prompt payment.
3. Sold merchandise on account, $80.
 
The cost of the merchandise was $50.
As shown in Figure 13-2, under the perpetual inventory system, entries are made 
to the merchandise inventory and cost of goods sold accounts as transactions take 
place during the accounting period. The merchandise inventory account is debited for 
the cost of all goods purchased, including freight charges, and credited for the cost of 
all goods sold. In addition, this account is debited when customers return merchandise 
and is credited when suppliers grant returns, allowances, and discounts. Thus, the bal-
ance of the account represents the cost of goods on hand at all times. The cost of goods 
sold account is debited when merchandise is sold and credited when customers return 
merchandise. Thus, the balance of the account reflects the cost of goods sold at any 
point during the accounting period. No year-end adjusting entry is necessary as long as 
the physical inventory agrees with the amount reported in the merchandise inventory 
account. In Chapter 14, we will illustrate the proper adjustment if this is not true.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
ASSIGNING COST TO INVENTORY AND COST 
OF GOODS SOLD
To determine the cost of goods sold and ending inventory, it is important to understand:
1. the purpose of a physical inventory,
2. the specific calculations used under the periodic and perpetual systems, and
3. the role of the lower-of-cost-or-market rule.
TAKING A PHYSICAL INVENTORY
Under the periodic system, the goods on hand at the end of the period are counted to 
allocate merchandise costs between sold and unsold goods. This process is called 
taking a physical inventory. A physical inventory is also important under the perpetual 
system. It verifies that the amount of merchandise actually held agrees with what is 
reported in the accounting records.
Taking a physical inventory can be a sizable task. Frequently, it is done after regu-
lar business hours. Some companies even close for a few days to take inventory. The 
ideal time to count the goods is when the quantity on hand is at its lowest level. A fiscal 
year that starts and ends at the time the stock of goods is normally at its lowest level 
is known as a natural business year. Such a year is used by many businesses for 
accounting purposes.
Various procedures are followed in taking an inventory to be sure that no items 
are missed and that no items are included more than once. Frequently, persons taking 
inventory work in pairs: one counts the items and the other records the information. 
Usually, this information is entered on a special form called an inventory sheet, like the 
one illustrated in Figure 13-3. The inventory sheet has columns for recording the 
description of each item, the quantity on hand, the cost per unit, and the extension.
LO3 Compute the costs 
allocated to the ending 
inventory and cost

Even under the perpetual 
inventory system, there will 
be differences between 
the actual inventory on the 
floor and the amount on the 
books. These differences 
are the result of breakage, 
spoilage, and theft. Thieves 
rarely yell “Debit Loss 
Due to Theft and credit 
Merchandise Inventory” as 
they attempt to leave the 
store with merchandise 
under their coats.

Chapter 13          Accounting for Merchandise Inventory
491
Only goods that are the property of the company should be included in a physical 
inventory. Two special situations that require care to determine ownership are 
(1) goods held for sale on consignment and (2) goods in transit. Sometimes one busi-
ness will try to sell merchandise for another business or individual on a commission 
basis. This is called selling goods on consignment. Goods held on consignment remain 
the property of the shipper (consignor). They should not be included in the inventory 
of the company holding the goods (consignee).
To determine whether goods in transit at year-end should be included in inventory, 
we must know the FOB (free on board) terms. If goods are shipped FOB shipping 
point, the buyer pays for shipping and the goods belong to the buyer as soon as they 
are shipped. If goods are shipped FOB destination, the seller pays for shipping and the 
goods belong to the seller until they are received by the buyer.
After calculating the quantities of goods owned at the end of the period, the 
proper cost must be assigned to the inventory. In addition to the purchase price, we 
include delivery costs (freight-in), insurance, and, occasionally, storage fees. Therefore, 
cost means all necessary and reasonable costs incurred to get the goods to the buyer’s 
place of business.
If all purchases of the same item were made at the same price per unit, computing 
the cost of the ending inventory would be simple. We would multiply the number of units 
by the cost per unit. In a world of changing prices, however, identical items are purchased 
at different times and at different costs per unit. Of the goods available for sale, how do 
we decide which units were sold and which units remain on the shelf? As shown in 
Figure 13-4, this decision affects the income statement and balance sheet. The following 
four inventory methods have become generally accepted for answering this question:
1. Specific identification
2. First-in, first-out (FIFO)
3. Weighted-average
4. Last-in, first-out (LIFO)
These methods may be applied under the periodic or perpetual inventory systems.
A BROADER VIEW
The “Magic Wand” at Wal-Mart
At any given time, a typical Wal-Mart discount store has more 
than 70,000 standard items in stock. Every item must be 
inventoried and replenished in a timely way to avoid having 
too much or too little stock. Wal-Mart associates have the aid 
of the “Magic Wand,” a handheld computer, linked by a radio-
frequency network to in-store terminals. These high-tech 
devices provide up-to-the-minute information on inventory on 
hand, upcoming deliveries, and stock at Wal-Mart distribution 
centers.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
THE PERIODIC INVENTORY SYSTEM
Specific Identification Method
When each unit of inventory can be specifically identified, the specific identification 
method can be used. To use this method, inventory items must be physically different 
from each other, or they must have serial numbers. Examples include cars, motorcy-
cles, furniture, appliances, and fine jewelry. When a unit is sold, its cost is determined 
from the supplier’s invoice. Unless computerized, this method is practical only for busi-
nesses in which sales volume is relatively low and inventory unit value is relatively 
high. Otherwise, record keeping becomes expensive and time consuming.

Of the 200 units sold during the period, the bicycle serial numbers show that 30 
were from the beginning inventory, 50 were from the first purchase, 60 were from the 
second purchase, and 60 were from the last purchase. The cost of goods sold and the 
cost of inventory at the end of the period are determined as shown in Figure 13-5.
First-In, First-Out (FIFO) Method
Another widely used method of allocating merchandise cost is called the first-in, first-
out, or FIFO, method. This costing method assumes that the first goods purchased 
were the first goods sold. Therefore, the latest goods purchased remain in inventory.
Whenever possible, a business will attempt to sell the older goods first. This is par-
ticularly true of businesses that sell perishable items or merchandise that may become 
obsolete. Grocery stores, fresh fruit stands, and computer software businesses are good 
examples. These businesses must rotate their stock forward. They pull the oldest bread,

milk, fruit, and vegetables to the front of the shelves and try to sell all copies of the 
current software before a new version arrives. FIFO costing is, therefore, widely used 
because it often follows the actual movement of goods. It assumes that the oldest units 
have been sold and the newest or freshest units are in the ending inventory.
Applying FIFO to the bicycle inventory data, the cost of goods sold and the cost 
of inventory at the end of the period are determined as shown in Figure 13-6.

Note that the 50 items on hand at the end of the period are considered to be those

FIFO costing is widely used because businesses have used this method for a long 
time. Accountants are reluctant to change a long-followed method of accounting when 
such a change would affect the comparability of their income calculations over a period 
of years. Consistency based on comparability is an important accounting principle.
Weighted-Average Method
Another method of allocating merchandise cost is called the weighted-average method, 
or average cost method. This costing method is based on the average cost of identical 
units.
LEARNING KEY
The consistency principle of 
accounting suggests that a busi-
ness should use the same ac -
counting techniques from year 
to year.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Consider the bicycle inventory data again. The average cost of identical units is 
determined by dividing the total cost of units available for sale ($16,500) by the total 
number of units available for sale (250).
$16,500 (cost of units available for sale)  =  $66 weighted-average cost per unit
         250 (units available for sale)
The cost of goods sold and the cost of the end-of-period inventory are calculated 
as follows:
Cost of goods sold 
200 units @ $66  =  $ 13,200
Cost of ending inventory 
 50 units @ $66  =      3,300
Total 
250 units 
$ 16,500
There is a logical appeal to the weighted-average method of allocating cost 
between goods sold and goods on hand. In this example, one-fifth (50) of the total 
units available (250) were unsold. The weighted-average method assigns one-fifth 
($3,300) of the total cost ($16,500) to these goods.
Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) Method
A fourth method of allocating merchandise cost is called the last-in, first-out, or LIFO, 
method. It assumes that the sales in the period were made from the most recently 
purchased goods. Therefore, the earliest goods purchased remain in inventory.
This physical flow is associated with businesses selling products that are not per-
ishable or likely to become obsolete, and may be difficult to handle. Imagine a large 
barrel of nails at a lumberyard. Customers take nails from the top of the barrel. When 
the supply gets low, new nails are simply piled on top of the old ones. There is no need 
to rotate the nails from the bottom to the top of the barrel.
Applying LIFO to the bicycle inventory data, the cost of goods sold and the cost 
of inventory at the end of the period are determined as shown in Figure 13-7.

Note that the 50 units on hand at the end of the period are considered to be the 
40 units in the beginning inventory plus 10 of the units from the first purchase.
The LIFO method has been justified on the grounds that the physical movement 
of goods in some businesses is actually last-in, first-out. This is rarely the case, but the 
method has become popular for other reasons. One persuasive argument for the use 
of the LIFO method is that it matches the most current cost of items purchased against

the current sales revenue. When the most current costs of purchases are subtracted 
from sales revenue, the impact of changing prices on the resulting gross profit figure 
is minimized. In the opinion of many accountants, this is proper and desirable.
Another reason for the popularity of the LIFO method is its effect on income 
taxes. When prices are rising, net income calculated under the LIFO method is less 
than net income calculated under either the FIFO or the weighted-average method. 
Since the net income amount under LIFO is less, the related income tax will be less. 
The reverse would be true if prices were falling. However, periods of falling prices over 
the past two centuries have been few and brief.
Opponents of the LIFO method contend that its use causes old, out-of-date inven-
tory costs to be shown on the balance sheet. The theoretical and practical merits of 
FIFO versus LIFO are the subject of much professional debate.
Physical Flows and Cost Flows
Of the four inventory costing methods described, only the specific identification cost-
ing method will necessarily reflect cost flows that match physical flows of goods. Each 
of the other three methods—FIFO, weighted-average, and LIFO—is based on assumed 
cost flows. The assumed cost flows are not required to reflect the actual physical move-
ment of goods within the company. Any one of the three assumed cost flow methods 
could be used under any set of physical flow conditions. For example, a fresh fruit 
stand with an actual FIFO flow of inventory may use LIFO for accounting purposes. 
Similarly, a supplier of building materials that sells nails, lumber, and sand off the top 
of the pile may use FIFO even though the physical flow of goods is LIFO. 
Comparison of Methods
To compare the results of the four inventory methods, let’s assume that the 200 bicycle 
units in our example were sold for $18,000. Figure 13-8 contrasts the ending inven-
tory, cost of goods sold, and gross profit under each of the four methods.
Although LIFO is accept-
able under U.S. GAAP and 
many U.S. companies use 
this method for financial 
reporting and tax purposes, 
it is not permitted under 
International Financial 
Reporting Standards.
LEARNING KEY
The inventory method used does 
not have to match the physical 
flow of goods.

FIFO
During periods of rising prices, we can observe the following: LIFO generally 
produces the highest cost of goods sold, lowest gross profit, and lowest ending inven-
tory. Since the most recent units purchased are assumed to have been sold, the most 
recent costs are matched against revenues and this provides the best measure of gross 
profit and net income. After all, the units sold must be replaced at current prices. 
However, under LIFO, the first units purchased are assumed to remain in inventory 
(FISH: First-In, Still Here). This means that units purchased many years ago may 
remain in the ending inventory. These dollar amounts are likely to have little meaning 
when measuring the firm’s performance or financial health.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
FIFO generally produces the lowest cost of goods sold, highest gross profit, and 
highest ending inventory. Since the last units purchased are assumed to be in ending 
inventory, these most recent costs provide the best inventory measure on the balance 
sheet (LISH: Last-In, Still Here). However, under FIFO, the first units purchased are 
assumed to have been sold. This means that somewhat older prices are used to com-
pute cost of goods sold and gross profit than under LIFO. Thus, these measures are 
somewhat less useful than those computed under LIFO.
The weighted-average inventory method produces measures between LIFO and 
FIFO. The specific identification method will produce measures based on the actual 
units sold.
The Internal Revenue Service requires the use of the same inventory method for 
tax and financial reporting purposes. Since LIFO generally produces the highest cost 
of goods sold, lowest gross profit, and lowest tax liability, many firms use the LIFO 
inventory method to minimize federal income taxes. The tax dollars saved are then 
available for other purposes.
As discussed earlier, keep the following in mind when selecting the inventory 
method to be used by a business:
1.  The physical flow of the inventory does not need to match the flow assumed by 
the inventory method.
2.  The consistency principle requires that the same accounting methods be followed 
from period to period. Although it is acceptable to make changes, it is not 
appropriate to switch back and forth from FIFO to LIFO based on the desire to 
maximize or minimize earnings for a given year.
THE PERPETUAL INVENTORY SYSTEM
Under the perpetual inventory system, a continuous record is maintained for the 
quantities and costs of goods on hand at all times. The general ledger account for 
Merchandise Inventory under such a system is somewhat like the account for Cash. It 
provides a chronological record of each addition (purchase) and subtraction (sale). The 
balance of the account at any time shows the cost of goods that should be on hand.
When perpetual inventory records are kept, the merchandise inventory account in 
the general ledger is usually a controlling account. A subsidiary ledger is maintained 
with an account for each type of merchandise. These accounts are often recorded on 
cards or in computer files. As shown in Figure 13-9, the subsidiary accounts are 
designed to handle additions and subtractions and determine the new balance after 
each change. Goods sold usually are assigned cost on either a FIFO, moving-average, 
or LIFO basis. Procedures for applying the FIFO method in a perpetual inventory 
system are similar to those illustrated for a periodic system. The first merchandise 
purchased is treated as the first merchandise sold. The illustration in Figure 13-9 is 
based on the FIFO method. The specific techniques used to apply the moving-average 
and LIFO methods in a perpetual system are more complicated. They are illustrated 
in the chapter appendix.
LOWER-OF-COST-OR-MARKET METHOD 
OF INVENTORY VALUATION
It is a well-established tradition in accounting that gains should not be recognized 
unless a sale has occurred. If the value of an asset increases while it is being held, no 
formal entry of the gain is made on the books. On the other hand, if an asset’s value 
declines while it is being held, it is generally considered proper to recognize a loss. This 
is in keeping with the accounting practice of conservatism, which states that when in 
doubt, the lower asset value and net income measure should be used. Thus, we should 
never anticipate gains, but we should always anticipate and account for losses.
LEARNING KEY
In periods of rising prices, LIFO 
produces the lowest net income 
and FIFO produces the highest 
net income.
LEARNING KEY
A controlling account and sub-
sidiary ledger are maintained for 
inventory in much the same way 
as for accounts receivable and 
accounts payable.

The accounting practice of 
conservatism states that when in

As applied to inventory, conservatism means that if the value of inventory declines 
while it is being held, the loss should be recognized in the period of the decline. The 
purpose of the lower-of-cost-or-market method is to recognize such losses on the 
income statement and to report the lower inventory valuation on the balance sheet.
In applying the lower-of-cost-or-market method, “cost” means the dollar amount 
calculated using one of the four inventory costing methods. “Market” means the cost 
to replace the inventory. It is the price in the market in which goods are purchased by 
the business—not the price in the market in which they are normally sold by the busi-
ness. The lower-of-cost-or-market method assumes that a decline in the purchase 
(replacement) price of inventory is accompanied by a decline in the selling price. In this 
sense, a decline in the purchase (replacement) price signals a decline in the value of the 
inventory.
To illustrate the lower-of-cost-or-market method, assume the following end-of-
period inventory data for three items:
 
Recorded

The illustration shows two ways to calculate the lower-of-cost-or-market. First, the 
lower-of-cost-or-market method can be applied to the total inventory. This involves 
comparing the $24,000 total cost with the $23,500 total end-of-period market value. 
Under the second approach, the method is applied to each item in inventory. This

Accounting for a Merchandising Business
involves comparing the $24,000 total cost with the $22,500 lower-of-cost-or-market 
value determined by comparing cost with market value for each item. Either approach 
is acceptable, but the one chosen should be applied consistently across periods.
The difference between the cost and market value is considered a loss due to hold-
ing inventory. Normally, it is charged to an account such as Loss on Write-Down of 
Inventory. For example, based on application of the method to the total inventory in 
the previous illustration, a $500 loss ($24,000 − $23,500) is recognized as follows:

cost of goods sold if the amounts are small.

ESTIMATING ENDING INVENTORY AND COST 
OF GOODS SOLD
Many businesses prepare monthly or quarterly financial statements. To do this, the 
business must estimate the inventory at the end of the month or quarter and the cost 
of goods sold for the period. This is not a problem for businesses using the perpetual 
inventory method. Although these amounts need to be verified by a physical inventory 
at the end of the year, the unverified amounts are generally reliable estimates and can 
be used for these “interim” statements.
Businesses using the periodic inventory method must use other methods to estimate 
the ending inventory and cost of goods sold. Two generally accepted methods are the 
gross profit method and the retail inventory method.
GROSS PROFIT METHOD OF ESTIMATING INVENTORY
Under the gross profit method, a business’s normal gross profit (net sales − cost of 
goods sold) is used to estimate the cost of goods sold and ending inventory. To illus-
trate the gross profit method, assume the following data with respect to Groomer 
Company:
Inventory, start of period 
$80,000
Net purchases, first month 
$70,000
Net sales, first month 
$110,000
Normal gross profit as a percentage of sales 
40%
The estimated cost of goods sold for the month and the estimated merchandise 
inventory at the end of the month would be determined as shown in Figure 13-10.
This calculation is appropriate only if the firm’s normal gross profit as a percent-
age of net sales has been relatively stable over time. This type of calculation also can 
be used to test the reasonableness of the amount of inventory that was computed on 
the basis of a physical count. A large difference between the two amounts might indi-
cate a mistake in the count, a mistake in the costing of the items, or a marked change

in the gross profit rate. The gross profit procedure also can be used to estimate the cost 
of an inventory that was destroyed by fire or other casualty.
RETAIL METHOD OF ESTIMATING INVENTORY
Many retail businesses, such as department and clothing stores, use a variation of the 
gross profit method to calculate cost of goods sold and ending inventory. The proce-
dure used, called the retail method of inventory, requires keeping records of both the 
cost and selling (retail) prices of all goods purchased. This information can be used to 
estimate cost of goods sold and ending inventory, as shown in Figure 13-11.

LO1  Explain the impact of merchandise 
inventory on the financial 
statements.
The cost of goods available for sale during the accounting period 
must be divided between the cost of goods sold and the ending mer-
chandise inventory. Cost of goods sold is reported on the income 
statement and used to determine the gross profit for the period. The 
ending merchandise inventory is reported as a current asset on the 
balance sheet. Figure 13-12 illustrates the allocation of cost of goods 
available for sale into cost of goods sold and ending inventory.

LO2  Describe the two principal 
systems of accounting for 
merchandise inventory—the 
periodic system and the 
perpetual system.
There are two systems of accounting for merchandise.
Periodic Inventory System
1. The purchases account is debited for the cost of all goods purchased.
2. The sales account is credited for the selling prices of all 
goods sold.
3. At the end of the accounting period, a physical inventory is 
taken, and the following formula is applied to calculate cost 
of goods sold:
  Beginning Inventory (last year’s ending physical count)
 +  Net Purchases (account balance at end of this year)
 =  Cost of Goods Available for Sale
 –  Ending Inventory (this year’s ending physical count)
 =  Cost of Goods Sold (for this year)
Perpetual Inventory System
1. The merchandise inventory account is debited for all purchases.
2. The cost of goods sold account is debited, and the merchan-
dise inventory account is credited for all sales.
3. Thus, the merchandise inventory account provides a running 
balance of the goods on hand.
LO3  Compute the costs allocated to 
the ending inventory and cost 
of goods sold using different 
inventory methods.
One of the following four inventory methods is generally used to 
determine the costs assigned to the goods sold and ending inventory:
• 
Specific identification
• 
FIFO: first-in, first-out
• 
Weighted-average
• 
LIFO: last-in, first-out

LO3  (concluded)
The actual physical flow of inventory does not have to match the 
method used. During periods of rising prices, LIFO produces the 
lowest net income, and FIFO produces the highest net income.
LO4  Estimate the ending inventory and 
cost of goods sold by using the 
gross profit and retail inventory 
methods.
Firms using the periodic inventory method often need to estimate 
their inventory. Two methods are used for this purpose.
• 
Gross Profit Method—The firm’s normal gross profit as a 
percentage of net sales is used to estimate cost of goods sold 
and ending inventory in three steps.
1. Compute the cost of goods available for sale.
2. Estimate cost of goods sold by deducting the normal 
gross profit (net sales  normal gross profit as 
percentage of net sales) from net sales.
3. Estimate the ending inventory by deducting cost of 
goods sold from the cost of goods available for sale.
• 
Retail Inventory Method—The firm’s ratio of cost-to-retail 
prices of goods available for sale is used to estimate ending 
inventory and cost of goods sold in five basic steps:
1. Compute the cost of goods available for sale at cost and retail.
2. Compute the ending inventory at retail by subtracting 
sales at retail from goods available for sale at retail.
3. Compute the cost-to-retail ratio by dividing the cost of 
goods available for sale by the retail value of the goods 
available for sale.
4. Estimate the cost of ending inventory by multiplying the 
ending inventory at retail (step 2) by the cost-to-retail ratio.
5. Estimate cost of goods sold by:
a. multiplying sales at retail by the cost-to-retail ratio, or
b. subtracting the estimated ending inventory from the 
cost of goods available for sale.

Accounting for a Merchandising Business
REQUIRED
1. Calculate the total amount to be assigned to cost of goods sold for the fiscal year 
and ending inventory on October 31, 20-2, under each of the following periodic 
inventory methods:
(a) FIFO
(b) LIFO
(c) Weighted-average cost (round calculations to two decimal places)
2. Assume that the market price per unit (cost to replace) of Fialka’s inventory 
on October 31, 20-2, was $29. Calculate the total amount to be assigned to 
the ending inventory on October 31, 20-2, under each of the following 
methods:
(a) FIFO lower-of-cost-or-market
(b) Weighted-average lower-of-cost-or-market
3. Assume that a fire destroyed Fialka’s store and all inventory on October 31, 
just prior to taking a physical inventory. Thus, Fialka must estimate the end-
ing inventory and cost of goods sold. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 
20-2, net sales of $134,000 were made. The normal gross profit rate is 40%. 
Use the gross profit method to estimate the cost of goods sold for the fiscal 
year ended October 31, 20-2, and the inventory on October 31, 20-2.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
KEY TERMS
average cost method (493) See weighted-average method.
conservatism (496) The accounting practice of conservatism states that we should 
never anticipate gains, but always anticipate and account for losses. As applied 
to inventory, conservatism means that if the value of inventory declines while it is 
being held, the loss should be recognized in the period of the decline.
consignee (491) The company holding the merchandise of another business to be 
sold.
consignment (491) Goods that are held by one business for sale but that are owned 
by another business.
consignor (491) The owner of the merchandise that is held by another business.
consistency (493) The principle that states that a business should use the same 
accounting methods from period to period. This improves the comparability of 
the financial statements over time.
cost (497) In applying the lower-of-cost-or-market method, cost means the dollar 
amount calculated using one of the four inventory costing methods.
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method (492) A method of allocating merchandise cost 
which assumes that the first goods purchased were the first goods sold and, 
therefore, that the latest goods purchased remain in inventory. 
gross profit method (498) A method of estimating inventory in which a business’s 
normal gross profit percentage is used to estimate the cost of goods sold and 
ending inventory.
in transit (491) Goods that are in the process of being shipped between the seller 
and the buyer.
inventory sheet (490) A form used for recording inventory items. It has columns for 
recording the description of each item, the quantity on hand, the cost per unit, 
and the extension.
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method (494) A method of allocating merchandise cost 
which assumes that the sales in the period were made from the most recently 
purchased goods. Therefore, the earliest goods purchased remain in inventory.
Loss on Write-Down of Inventory (498) This account is debited when the market 
value (replacement cost) of the inventory is below cost when applying the lower-
of-cost-or-market method of inventory valuation. It is reported on the income 
statement as an expense.
lower-of-cost-or-market method (497) An inventory valuation method under which 
inventory is valued at the lower-of-cost-or-market value (replacement cost).
market (497) In applying the lower-of-cost-or-market method, market means the 
cost to replace the inventory. It is the prevailing price in the market in which 
goods are purchased—not the prevailing price in the market in which they are 
normally sold.
natural business year (490) A fiscal year that starts and ends at the time the stock of 
goods is normally at its lowest level.
periodic inventory system (489) Under this system, the ending inventory and cost of 
goods sold are determined at the end of the accounting period, when a physical 
inventory is taken.
perpetual inventory system (489) Under this system, the merchandise inventory and 
cost of goods sold accounts are updated when merchandise is bought and sold.
physical inventory (490) A physical count of the goods on hand.

retail method (499) A variation of the gross profit method that is used by many 
retail businesses, such as department and clothing stores, to estimate the cost of 
goods sold and ending inventory.
specific identification method (492) A method of allocating merchandise cost in 
which each unit of inventory is specifically identified.
weighted-average method (493) A method of allocating merchandise cost based on 
the average cost of identical units. The average cost of identical units is deter-
mined by dividing the total cost of units available for sale by the total number of 
units available for sale.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
Most major grocery chains have optical scanning devices at the checkout stands and 
they certainly reduce the time required to check out. What benefits do they provide to 
the business? Next time you go to the grocery store, take a few minutes to chat with 
the manager. Ask the manager to describe the benefits of the scanning devices over the 
old machines that required the clerk to key in each purchase. Pay particular attention 
to the linkage between the scanning devices and the inventory systems. Be sure to ask 
whether the grocery store is on a periodic or perpetual system.
After your visit, write a memo to your instructor describing the benefits of the 
scanning devices and how they are linked with the inventory system.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
ETHICS CASE
Electronics, Inc., is a high-volume, wholesale merchandising company. Most of its 
inventory turns over four or five times a year. The company has had 50 units of a par-
ticular brand of computers on hand for over a year. These computers have not sold and 
probably will not sell unless they are discounted 60 to 70%. The accountant is carrying 
them on the books at cost and intends to recognize the loss when they are sold. This 
way, she can avoid a significant write-down in inventory on the current year’s financial 
statements.
1. Is the accountant correct in her treatment of the inventory? Why or why not?
2. If the computers cost $1,000 each and their market value is 40% of their cost, 
journalize the entry necessary for the write-down.
3. In a short paragraph, explain what is meant by conservatism and how it ties in 
with the lower-of-cost-or-market method of accounting for inventory.
4. In groups of three or four, make a list of reasons why inventories of electronic 
equipment might have to be written down.

3. In addition to taking a physical inventory on December 31, Tiller decides to 
estimate the ending inventory and cost of goods sold. During the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 20-2, net sales of $100,000 were made at a normal gross 
profit rate of 35%. Use the gross profit method to estimate the cost of goods sold 
for the fiscal year ended December 31 and the inventory on December 31.
CHALLENGE PROBLEM
Bhushan Company has been using LIFO for inventory purposes because it would 
prefer to keep gross profits low for tax purposes. In its second year of operation 
(20-2), the controller pointed out that this strategy did not appear to work and 
suggested that FIFO cost of goods sold would have been higher than LIFO cost of 
goods sold for 20-2. Is this possible?

In Chapter 13, you learned how to apply the 
LIFO and weighted-averge inventory methods 
under the periodic inventory system. Recall 
that all calculations under the periodic system 
are done at the end of the accounting period. 
Under the perpetual system, costs are com-
puted every time merchandise is purchased and 
sold. These costs are used to maintain a run-
ning record of the cost of goods sold to date 
and the balance of inventory on hand.
PERPETUAL LIFO
When using the perpetual LIFO inventory 
method, every time inventory is purchased a new 
layer is formed. When inventory is sold, we assume that the most recently purchased 
layer is sold first. As those units are used up, units are taken from the next most recently 
purchased layer. To illustrate, let’s assume that Phaler’s Fishing Supplies has the follow-
ing beginning inventory, purchases, and sales of one type of bobber during the month 
of June. Note that the beginning inventory also has layers based on the prices paid in 
earlier periods.

BI: Beginning Inventory
As shown in Figure 13A-1, the beginning inventory of 200 units forms Phaler’s 
first three layers of inventory. The purchase on June 4 forms a fourth layer (300 units 
@ $1.50 = $450). At this point, Phaler has a total of 500 units at a total cost of $650. 
On June 20, Phaler sells 400 units. Under perpetual LIFO, we assume that the 
300 units purchased on June 4 are sold first, followed by 20 that cost $1.20 each and 
80 units that cost $1.00 each from the beginning inventory. The cost of goods sold on 
June 20 is $554. The cost of the inventory on hand is $96. At this point, Phaler 
has 100 units remaining from the beginning inventory.
On June 30, Phaler purchases 100 units at $1.80 each. This forms a new fifth 
layer (100 @ $1.80 = $180). This layer is added to the two layers remaining from the 
beginning inventory for a total of 200 units at a total cost of $276 of inventory on

PERPETUAL MOVING-AVERAGE
When using the perpetual moving-average inventory method, every time inventory is 
purchased a new average cost per unit is calculated. When inventory is sold, the most 
recent average cost is used to measure cost of goods sold and the remaining inventory 
on hand. To illustrate, let’s look again at the purchases and sales of Phaler’s Fishing 
Supplies for the month of June.

As shown in Figure 13A-2, a new average cost is calculated each time a purchase 
is made. The average cost of the June 1 beginning inventory is shown as $1.00 ($200 
cost/200 units). To compute the average cost after buying more inventory on June 4, 
we take the cost of the inventory on hand ($200 + $450 = $650) and divide by the 
number of units on hand (200 + 300 = 500). Thus, the average cost of the inventory 
on hand on June 4 is $1.30 per unit. To compute the cost of the 400 units sold on June 
20, multiply the 400 units by $1.30 to get the cost of goods sold of $520. The remain-
ing cost of the inventory on hand is $130 ($650 – $520). The number of units on hand 
is reduced to 100 (500 – 400).
On June 30, 100 additional units are purchased. This increases the units on hand 
to 200 (100 + 100) and the cost of the inventory on hand to $310 ($130 + $180). 
Dividing the cost of the inventory on hand by the number of units on hand provides 
a new moving-average cost of $1.55 ($310 ÷ 200). If Phaler makes another sale before 
buying additional units, this average cost will be used to compute the cost of goods 
sold and determine the cost of the inventory remaining on hand. Note that selling 
inventory does not change the moving-average cost. This is because the units are being 
removed at the most recent average cost.
When using the moving 
average inventory method, 
it is best to do the calcula-
tions on a calculator or 
computer spreadsheet. 
Carry each calculation out 
to the number of decimal 
places allowed by the 
technology used. This will 
reduce rounding errors.

Adjustments and the Work Sheet 
for a Merchandising Business
The Scranton/Wilkes-Barre (Pa.) Yankees are the Class AAA affi  liate 
of the New York Yankees. They play in the North Division of the Inter-
national League with the Buff alo Bisons, Ottawa Lynx, Pawtucket 
Red Sox, Rochester Red Wings, and Syracuse Chiefs. The franchise 
was founded in 1989 when the Maine Guides moved to Pennsylvania. 
From 1989 to 2006, the team was the Class AAA International League 
affi  liate of the Philadelphia Phillies known as the Red Barons. 
The team is managed by Mandalay Sports Entertainment, which 
also operates several other Minor League teams. The Yankees play at 
PNC Field, which was built on Montage Mountain between Scranton 
and Wilkes-Barre and has a capacity of 10,310, including luxury suites 
with indoor and outdoor seating. It opened in 1989. 
Often, we are expected to pay in advance for goods and services. 
This is true for season tickets for sporting events like the Scranton/
Wilkes-Barre Yankees, magazine subscriptions, or tickets for popu-
lar operas or rock concerts. In return, we expect to receive the goods 
or services. In this chapter, you will learn proper accounting for cash 
receipts received in advance, which are known as unearned revenues.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
Careful study of this chapter should 
enable you to:
LO1  Prepare an adjustment for 
merchandise inventory 
using the periodic 
inventory system.
LO2  Prepare an adjustment 
for unearned revenue.
LO3  Prepare a work sheet for a 
merchandising business.
LO4  Journalize adjusting 
entries for a merchandising 
business.
LO5  Prepare adjusting journal 
entries under the perpetual 
inventory system.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
ADJUSTMENT FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORY: 
PERIODIC INVENTORY SYSTEM
 As discussed in Chapter 13, under the periodic inventory system when merchandise 
inventory is purchased, the purchases account is debited and Cash or Accounts 
Payable is credited. When inventory is sold, Cash or Accounts Receivable is debited 
and Sales is credited. Figure 14-1 provides a review of these entries.
LO1 Prepare an adjustment 
for merchandise 
inventory using the 
periodic inventory 
system.
In Chapters 10 through 13, we learned how to account for the day-to-day transactions of a 
merchandising business. In this chapter, we focus on end-of-period adjustments and the prepara-
tion of the work sheet. Finally, in Chapter 15, we will complete the accounting cycle by preparing 
fi nancial statements and closing entries.
A work sheet for a merchandising business is similar to the work sheet prepared for a service 
business (Chapter 5). It is used to prepare adjustments for supplies, prepaid insurance, wages 
earned but not paid, depreciation, and other necessary year-end adjustments. A merchandising 
business must also make an adjustment to properly report the amount of merchandise inventory 
held at the end of the accounting period. While revisiting the work sheet, we will also introduce a 
new adjustment for unearned revenue.
Note that the merchandise inventory account is not debited or credited in either of 
these entries. Since sales and purchases have taken place during the year, the beginning 
balance of the merchandise inventory account no longer provides an accurate measure 
of the inventory held at the end of the year. Thus, an adjustment must be made. For 
other assets, like prepaid insurance, we would simply make an adjustment for the 
change in the asset account. We do not follow this procedure for merchandise inventory. 
The adjustment for merchandise inventory is done in two steps. 
1.   Remove the beginning inventory from the merchandise inventory account by 
making the following entry:
 
 
Income Summary 
old
 
 
 
Merchandise Inventory

2.   Enter the ending inventory in the merchandise inventory account by making the 
following entry:

Chapter 14          Adjustments and the Work Sheet for a Merchandising Business 
525
As discussed in Chapter 13, the quantity of inventory on hand at the end of the 
accounting period is determined by taking a physical count of the goods on hand. The 
cost of these goods is determined by using FIFO, LIFO, or another inventory method. 
Of course, this year’s ending inventory becomes next year’s beginning inventory. 
To illustrate the adjustment for merchandise inventory, let’s assume that Ponder’s 
Bike Parts had a beginning merchandise inventory of $25,000. During the year, the 
entries shown in Figure 14-1 were made as merchandise was purchased and sold. At 
the end of the accounting period, a physical inventory of the merchandise determined 
that merchandise costing $30,000 was still on hand.
To appreciate the reason for the different adjustment process, recall the discussion 
in Chapter 13 of how the beginning and ending inventories are used when computing 
cost of goods sold. As shown in the bottom portion of Figure 14-2, the beginning 
inventory is added to purchases to compute cost of goods available for sale. The 
          Purchases Returns & Allow.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
ending inventory is subtracted from cost of goods available for sale to compute cost 
of goods sold.
Many firms use the work sheet to prepare financial statements. Thus, all of the 
information needed to compute cost of goods sold should be readily available in the 
Income Statement columns of the work sheet. To provide this information, we need an 
adjustment technique that results in the beginning inventory being extended into the 
Income Statement Debit column so it can be added to purchases. Further, we need the 
ending inventory extended into the Income Statement Credit column so it will be sub-
tracted when computing cost of goods sold. As shown in Figure 14-2, this can be 
accomplished in two steps by using the income summary account.
STEP 1  The beginning inventory ($25,000) is removed by crediting Merchandise 
Inventory. Income Summary is debited because this amount is used in the 
calculation of cost of goods sold and net income.
STEP 2  The ending inventory ($30,000) is entered by debiting Merchandise 
Inventory. Income Summary is credited because this amount is also used in 
the calculation of cost of goods sold and net income.
Note that the debit and credit adjustments made to Income Summary are extended 
into the Adjusted Trial Balance and Income Statement columns. This is the only time 
individual figures, rather than the net amount, are extended on the work sheet. It is 
done in this case because the individual amounts are needed for the calculation of cost 
of goods sold on the income statement (beginning inventory + purchases – ending 
inventory = cost of goods sold). Note, also, that all of the information needed to com-
pute cost of goods sold is readily available in the Income Statement columns of the 
work sheet.
LEARNING KEY
Both the debit and credit amounts 
on the income summary line are 
extended to the Income Statement 
columns.

ADJUSTMENT FOR UNEARNED REVENUE
Some businesses require payment before delivering a product or performing a service. 
Examples include insurance companies, magazine publishers, apartment complexes, 
college food services, and professional sports and theater companies that sell season tickets. 
The cash received in advance is called unearned revenue. Since the cash has been received 
in advance, the company owes the customers the product or service, or must refund their 
money. Thus, unearned revenue is reported as a liability on the balance sheet.
To illustrate, let’s assume that Brown County Playhouse sells season tickets for five 
plays produced throughout the year. Tickets sell for $10 for each play ($50 for a 
season ticket) and a maximum of 1,000 seats can be sold for each play. For  simplicity, 
let’s assume that all shows sell out during the first week that season tickets are  available 
for sale. As shown below and in Figure 14-3, the sale of the tickets would be recorded 
as follows:
LO2 Prepare an adjustment 
for unearned revenue.
LEARNING KEY
Remember, under the accrual 
basis of accounting, revenue is 
recorded when earned regardless 
of when cash is received.

To prepare financial statements following production of the third show, an adjust-
ing entry is needed to recognize that $30,000 ($10  1,000 seats  3 shows) in ticket 
revenue has been earned. To do this, the following adjusting entry is made:

EXPANDED CHART OF ACCOUNTS
Let’s take a look at where the new accounts for a merchandising business fit into a 
chart of accounts. Recall that the chart of accounts follows the form of the accounting 
equation (assets = liabilities + owner’s equity + revenues – expenses). A chart of 
accounts for Northern Micro is provided in Figure 14-4. Note the classification of the 
new accounts introduced in Chapters 10 and 11 for a merchandising firm.
Merchandise Inventory is listed as a current asset. Since Northern Micro sells 
subscriptions to a computer magazine that it produces, Unearned Subscriptions 
Revenue is listed as a current liability, and Subscriptions Revenue is listed as a revenue. 
Sales Returns and Allowances and Sales Discounts are contra-revenue accounts. 
Recall, however, that Northern Micro does not offer sales discounts.
Purchases, Purchases Returns and Allowances, Purchases Discounts, and Freight-In 
are used to compute cost of goods sold. Thus, they are listed under this heading. 
Purchases Returns and Allowances and Purchases Discounts are often called contra-
cost accounts or contra-purchases accounts.
Interest Expense is classified as “Other Expenses” instead of being listed under 
Operating Expenses. This is because it represents the expense of obtaining money 
to do business, rather than an expense directly associated with operating the 
business.

STEP 5  Total the Income Statement and Balance Sheet columns to compute the net 
income or net loss.
The work sheet format and the five steps taken when preparing the work sheet 
are illustrated in Figure 14-5. Note that the new accounts introduced for a merchan-
dising firm and the unearned revenue account are highlighted so that you can see their 
proper placement and extensions. (The abbreviation BI stands for beginning inven-
tory; EI stands for ending inventory.) Pay particular attention to the extension of 
Income Summary. Both the debit and credit amounts for this account must be 
extended.

A BROADER VIEW
The Importance of Inventory
Note the important role of the ending inventory in the calculation 
of cost of goods sold in Figure 14-2. If the ending inventory is over-
stated for any reason, net income will also be overstated. Given this 
important relationship, auditors observe and verify the accuracy of 
the physical inventory. However, unethical managers, desperate to 
improve profits, have on occasion found ways to mislead auditors.
 In one case, managers overstated inventory counts for items 
that the auditors had not physically verified. In another case, 
auditors found a barrel whose contents had been valued by 
management at thousands of dollars. It actually contained floor 
sweepings. Finally, there was a case where management called 
the auditor, the day after the inventory audit, to report that 
additional inventory had arrived and should be included in the 
inventory count. The auditor never verified that the inventory 
was real. It turned out to be a scam that helped the company 
double its reported profits for the year. These unfortunate events 
highlight the reason auditors must exercise great care when 
conducting an inventory audit.

ADJUSTMENTS FOR NORTHERN MICRO
Before preparing a work sheet for Northern Micro, let’s review the preparation of 
adjustments in T account form. Figure 14-6 provides year-end adjustment information 
for Northern Micro. Figure 14-7 shows adjusting entries based on this information. 
The unadjusted balances for these accounts were taken from Northern Micro’s trial 
balance.
PREPARING A WORK SHEET FOR 
NORTHERN MICRO
Let’s prepare a work sheet for Northern Micro following the five steps illustrated in 
Figure 14-5.
STEP 1  In Figure 14-8, the Trial Balance columns are completed by copying the bal-
ances of all accounts from the general ledger (not shown).
STEP 2  In Figure 14-9, the adjustments are entered. These entries are exactly the 
same as those made in T account form in Figure 14-7.
STEP 3  In Figure 14-10, extensions are made to the Adjusted Trial Balance columns. 
Note that both the debit and credit amounts for Income Summary are 
extended.
STEP 4  In Figure 14-11, the Adjusted Trial Balance amounts are extended to the 
Income Statement and Balance Sheet columns.
STEP 5  In Figure 14-11, the work sheet is completed by totaling the Income 
Statement and Balance Sheet columns. The difference between the debits 
and credits for each pair of columns represents the net income or 
net loss.

FIGURE 14-13 Entries for Periodic and Perpetual Inventory Systems
As discussed in Chapter 13, the perpetual inventory system does not eliminate the 
need for taking physical inventories. The perpetual records must be compared with the 
physical inventory to discover and correct any errors or losses of merchandise from 
theft, breakage, or spoilage. If a difference is found between the physical count and the 
amount in the perpetual inventory records, the records must be corrected by an adjust-
ing entry. Some firms use Cost of Goods Sold to make this adjustment. A preferable 
approach is to use an account called Inventory Short and Over. For example, if the 
book balance is $3,840 and the physical count shows $3,710 worth of merchandise, 
the $130 shortage would be entered as follows:

the accuracy of the inventory 
records.
debited and Cash or Accounts Payable is credited. When inventory is sold, two entries 
are made.
1. Cash or Accounts Receivable is debited and Sales is credited.
2. Cost of Goods Sold is debited and Merchandise Inventory is credited.
A comparison of the entries under the periodic and perpetual inventory systems is 
provided in Figure 14-13.
If Inventory Short and Over has a debit balance, the account is listed with other 
expenses on the income statement. If it has a credit balance, the account is listed with 
other revenues on the income statement.
Using a separate account, Inventory Short and Over, makes it easier for manage-
ment to track inventory problems associated with errors, theft, breakage, and spoilage.

Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Further, it removes these items from the calculation of cost of goods sold and provides 
a better measure of the gross profit on sales.
A business that sells a wide selection of low-cost goods may not find it practical 
to keep a perpetual inventory. In contrast, a business that sells a few high-cost items 
(cars, fine jewelry, stereo equipment) can maintain such a record without incurring 
excessive processing costs. The increasing use of computers and optical scanning 
devices at the point of sale has enabled more businesses to switch from the periodic to 
the perpetual inventory system.

LO1  Prepare an adjustment for 
merchandise inventory using the 
periodic inventory system.
Extra care is required for the end-of-period adjustment for mer-
chandise inventory and the related extensions on the work sheet. 
The two-step adjustment process used on the work sheet is 
shown below. This technique is used so that all of the information 
required to compute cost of goods sold on the income statement is 
provided in the Income Statement columns of the work sheet.

Some firms receive cash before providing a service or selling a 
product. The cash received in advance is considered a liability, 
unearned revenue, until earned. The adjusting entry to recognize 
that unearned revenue has become earned is as follows:

DEMONSTRATION PROBLEM
Aaron Patton owns and operates Patton’s Bait Shop and Boat Rental. A year-end trial balance is shown on the next page.
Year-end adjustment data for Patton’s Bait Shop and Boat Rental are as follows:
(a and b) A physical count shows that merchandise inventory costing $15,000 is 
on hand as of December 31, 20--.
(c) Supplies remaining at the end of the year, $200.
(d) Unexpired insurance on December 31, $300.
(e) Depreciation expense on the building for 20--, $2,000.
(f) Depreciation expense on the store equipment for 20--, $1,500.
(g) Wages earned but not paid as of December 31, $225.
(h) Unearned boat rental revenue as of December 31, $1,000.
LO3  Prepare a work sheet for a 
merchandising business.
Steps to follow when preparing a work sheet are as follows:
 
1. Prepare the trial balance.
 
2. Prepare the adjustments.
 
3. Prepare the adjusted trial balance.
 
4.  Extend the adjusted trial balance amounts to the Income 
Statement and Balance Sheet columns.
 
5.  Total the Income Statement and Balance Sheet columns 
to compute the net income or net loss.
LO4  Journalize adjusting entries for a 
merchandising business.
The work sheet is a useful tool when preparing end-of-period adjust-
ments and financial statements. Remember: The work sheet is NOT 
a formal part of the accounting system. Adjustments made on the 
work sheet must be entered in a journal and posted to the ledger.
LO5  Prepare adjusting journal entries 
under the perpetual inventory 
system.
Under the perpetual inventory system, the cost of goods sold and 
merchandise inventory accounts are updated whenever merchan-
dise is purchased or sold. Thus, the firm knows how much inven-
tory should be on hand at any given point in time. However, the 
balance of the merchandise inventory account must be verified 
with an actual physical count of the inventory before issuing 
financial statements. If there is a difference, an adjusting entry is 
made. If the balance in the inventory account is greater than the 
physical count, the following entry is made:
    Inventory Short and Over     xxx
        Merchandise Inventory       xxx
If the balance in the inventory account is less than the physical 
count, the following entry is made:
    Merchandise Inventory       xxx
        Inventory Short and Over      xxx

BALANCE AND ADJUSTING ENTRIES The partial work sheet shown on page 559 
is taken from the books of Diamond Music Store, a business owned by Ned Diamond, 
for the year ended December 31, 20--.
REQUIRED
1. Analyze the work sheet and determine the adjusted trial balance and the adjust-
ing entries by working backward from the Income Statement and Balance Sheet 
columns.
2. Journalize the adjusting entries in a general journal.
3. Prepare the cost of goods sold section of the income statement for Diamond 
Music Store.
MANAGING YOUR WRITING
A friend of yours recently opened Abracadabra, a sportswear shop specializing in 
monogrammed athletic gear. Most merchandise is special ordered for customers. 
However, a small inventory is on hand. Your friend does not understand why a physi-
cal inventory is necessary before preparing the financial statements. She knows how 
much she paid for all merchandise purchased. Why not simply use this amount for cost 
of goods sold? After all, it has been paid for. Write a brief memo explaining the purpose 
of the physical inventory and why she should not use the cost of purchases as cost of 
goods sold.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
ETHICS CASE
Jason Tierro, an inventory clerk at Lexmar Company, is responsible for taking a 
physical count of the goods on hand at the end of the year. He has been performing 
this duty for several years. This year, Jason was very busy due to a shortage of person-
nel at the company, so he decided to just estimate the amount of ending inventory 
instead of doing an accurate count. He reasoned that he could come very close to the 
true amount because of his past experience working with inventory. Besides, he was 
sure that the sophisticated computer program that Lexmar had just invested in kept an 
accurate record of inventory on hand.
1. What is your opinion of Jason’s reasoning?
2. If Jason underestimates the dollar amount of ending inventory, what effect will it 
have on net income for the current accounting period?
3. Write a short paragraph explaining why a physical inventory should be taken at 
least once a year.
4. In groups of three or four, make a list of possible reasons that the actual ending 
inventory might not agree with the ending inventory according to a computer 
system.
MASTERY PROBLEM
 
John Neff owns and operates Waikiki Surf Shop. A year-end trial balance is provided 
on page 561. Year-end adjustment data for the Waikiki Surf Shop are shown below.

CHALLENGE PROBLEM 
 
Block Food’s, a retail grocery store, has agreed to purchase all of its merchandise from 
Square Wholesalers. In return, Block receives a special discount on purchases. Over 
recent months, Square noticed that purchases by Block had been falling off. At first, 
Square simply thought that business might be down for Block and was hopeful that 
their purchases would pick up. When business with Block did not return to a normal 
level, Square requested financial statements from Block. Square’s records indicate that 
Block purchased $300,000 worth of merchandise during 20-1, the most recent year.
This problem challenges you to 
apply your cumulative accounting 
knowledge to move a step beyond 
the material in the chapter.

Chapter 14 Appendix         Expense Method of Accounting for Prepaid Expenses
563
THE EXPENSE METHOD
Under the expense method of accounting for 
prepaid expenses, supplies and other prepaid 
items are entered as expenses when purchased. 
Under this method, we must adjust the accounts 
at the end of each accounting period to record 
the unused portions as assets. To illustrate, let’s 
assume that the following entry was made 
when office supplies were purchased:
4
Office Supplies Expense
4 2 5 00
4
5
      Cash
4 2 5
00
5
6
            Purchased office supplies
6
In the next section, we will illustrate the proper adjusting entry when using the 
expense method.
ADJUSTING ENTRIES UNDER THE EXPENSE METHOD
Office Supplies Expense was debited for a total of $425 during the period. An inven-

Accounting for a Merchandising Business
Let’s consider another example of the use of the expense method. The following 
entry was made for the payment of $6,000 for a three-year insurance policy:

13
            Paid insurance premium

At the end of the first year, one-third of the premium has expired and two-thirds 
remains. Thus, $2,000 for insurance expense should be reported on the income state-
ment and $4,000 in prepaid insurance should be reported on the balance sheet. The 
following adjusting entry is made:
15
Prepaid Insurance

As shown in the T accounts below, after this entry is posted, the prepaid insurance 
account has a debit balance of $4,000. The insurance expense account has a debit 
balance of $2,000.

The asset and expense methods of accounting for prepaid expenses give the 
same final result. In the asset method, the prepaid item is first debited to an asset 
account. At the end of each period, the amount consumed is debited to an expense 
account. In the expense method, the original amount is debited to an expense account. 
At the end of each accounting period, the portion not consumed is debited to an 
asset account.
LO1  Use the expense method of 
accounting for prepaid expenses.
Under the expense method, an expense account is debited when 
prepaid items are acquired.
LO2  Make the appropriate adjusting 
entries when the expense method 
is used for prepaid expenses.
At the end of the accounting period, an asset must be recog-
nized for the amount of the prepaid item remaining. The expense 
account must be credited so that the ending balance represents 
the amount of the item consumed.

Financial Statements and 
Year-End Accounting for 
a Merchandising Business
“woot” was originally a truncated expression commonly used by play-
ers of Dungeons and Dragons for “Wow, loot!” “Woot, Inc.,” is an online 
store, founded in 2003, that focuses on “selling cool stuff  cheap.” The com-
pany is known for its honest item descriptions and limited customer ser-
vice. For example, the Web site explains that the company doesn’t take 
calls because its 100 employees are busy fi nding new products and ship-
ping orders. Further, don’t try to return something until all other options 
have been exhausted. If you want cheap prices, don’t expect great ser-
vice. This candor is refreshing, but we suspect they will help you out if you 
need it. The company claims profi tability is anticipated by 2043. “By then 
we should be retired; someone smarter might take over and jack up the 
prices.” Clever, but with revenues increasing from $2.3 million to $117.4 
million over a recent three-year period, we suspect the company is doing 
just fi ne. Probably the most unique characteristic of this merchandiser is 
that it sells only one product each day. It is available from 12:00 A.M. until 
sold out, or 11:59 P.M., when a diff erent product is posted. Missed a cool 
product? Too bad. You can’t buy yesterday’s item. 
Though clearly unique, this business must perform year-end account-
ing in the same manner as other retailers. In this chapter, you will learn how 
Woot and other merchandising fi rms prepare fi nancial statements, compute 
fi nancial ratios to evaluate performance, and prepare closing and reversing 
entries. No matter how unique, businesses must follow similar accounting 
procedures so that profi tability and fi nancial health can be compared across 
years and with other companies.

THE INCOME STATEMENT
As you know, a primary purpose of the work sheet is to serve as an aid in preparing 
the financial statements. Figure 15-1 shows the completed work sheet for Northern 
Micro. We will use it to prepare financial statements.
The purpose of an income statement is to summarize the results of operations 
during an accounting period. The income statement shows the sources of revenue, 
types of expenses, and the amount of the net income or net loss for the period. Two 
forms of the income statement commonly used are the single step and the multiple 
step. The single-step income statement lists all revenue items and their total first, fol-
lowed by all expense items and their total. The difference, which is either net income 
or net loss, is then calculated. A single-step income statement for Northern Micro is 
illustrated in Figure 15-2.
The use of the work sheet to prepare a multiple-step income statement is illus-
trated in Figure 15-3. This type of income statement is commonly used for merchan-
dising businesses. The term “multiple-step” is used because the final net income is 
calculated on a step-by-step basis. Gross sales is shown first, less sales returns and 
allowances and sales discounts. This difference is called net sales. (Many published 
income statements begin with the amount of net sales.) Cost of goods sold is sub-
tracted next to arrive at gross profit (sometimes called gross margin).
Operating expenses are then listed and subtracted from the gross profit to com-
pute income from operations (sometimes called operating income). Operating expenses 
are directly associated with providing the primary goods and services of the business. 
Some companies divide operating expenses into the following subcategories.
Selling expenses. These expenses are directly associated with selling activities. Examples 
include:
Sales Salaries Expense
• 
Sales Commissions Expense
• 
Advertising Expense
• 
Bank Credit Card Expense
• 
Delivery Expense
• 
Depreciation Expense—Store Equipment and Fixtures
• 
LO1 Prepare a single-step 
and multiple-step 
income statement 
for a merchandising 
business.
The fi rst six chapters of this text illustrated the accounting cycle for a service business. In this 
chapter, we complete the accounting cycle for a merchandising business.
 In Chapter 14, we prepared the year-end work sheet and adjusting entries for Northern Micro. 
In this chapter, we will prepare fi nancial statements, look briefl y at fi nancial statement analysis, 
and demonstrate closing and reversing entries.

Although the formats for the 
single-step and multiple-step 
income statements are different, 
the reported net income is the 
same.
By showing other revenues 
and other expenses sepa-
rately, it is possible to show 
income from operations. This 
makes it easier for the reader 
to see how the business is 
doing in its main activity.

THE STATEMENT OF OWNER’S EQUITY
The statement of owner’s equity summarizes all changes in the owner’s equity during 
the period. It includes the net income or loss and any additional investments or with-
drawals by the owner. These changes result in the end-of-period balance shown on this 
statement and the balance sheet.

To prepare the statement of owner’s equity for Northern Micro, two sources of infor-
mation are needed: (1) the work sheet, and (2) Gary Fishel’s capital account (no. 311) in 
the general ledger. The work sheet (Figure 15-1) shows net income of $22,650 and 
withdrawals of $20,000 during the year. Fishel’s capital account (Figure 15-4) shows a 
beginning balance of $104,400. An additional $10,000 was invested in the business in 
February of the current year. The statement of owner’s equity for Northern Micro for 
the year ended December 31, 20--, is shown in Figure 15-5.
BALANCE SHEET
The use of the work sheet to prepare a report form classified balance sheet is illustrated 
in Figure 15-6. The balance sheet classifications used by Northern Micro are explained 
below.
CURRENT ASSETS
Current assets include cash and all other assets expected to be converted into cash or 
consumed within one year or the normal operating cycle of the business, whichever is 
longer. The operating cycle is the length of time generally required for a business to 
buy inventory, sell it, and collect the cash. This time period is generally less than a year. 
Thus, most firms use one year for classifying current assets. In a merchandising busi-
ness, the current assets usually include cash, receivables (such as accounts receivable 
and notes receivable), and merchandise inventory. Since prepaid expenses, such as 
unused supplies and unexpired insurance, are likely to be consumed within a year, they 
also are reported as current assets.

balance sheet.

Cash
FIGURE 15-6 Using a Work Sheet to Prepare a Report Form Classified Balance Sheet
Current assets are listed on the balance sheet from the most liquid to least liquid. 
Liquidity refers to the speed with which the company can convert the asset to cash. 
Cash is the most liquid asset and is always listed first. Notes Receivable, Accounts 
Receivable, and Merchandise Inventory often follow it on the balance sheet.
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Assets that are expected to be used for more than one year in the operation of a busi-
ness are called property, plant, and equipment. Examples include land, buildings, office 
equipment, store equipment, and delivery equipment. Of these assets, only land is

permanent; however, all of these assets have useful lives that are comparatively long. 
Typically, assets with longer useful lives are listed first.
The balance sheet of Northern Micro shows Land, Building, and Store Equipment. 
Land is not depreciated. Accumulated depreciation amounts are shown as deductions 
from the costs of the building and store equipment. The difference represents the unde-
preciated cost, or book value, of the assets. This amount less any salvage value will be 
written off as depreciation expense in future periods.
CURRENT LIABILITIES
Current liabilities include those obligations that are due within one year or the normal 
operating cycle of the business, whichever is longer, and will require the use of current 
assets. As of December 31, the current liabilities of Northern Micro consist of Notes 
Payable, Accounts Payable, Wages Payable, Sales Tax Payable, Unearned Subscriptions 
Revenue, and the portion of Mortgage Payable that is due within the next year.
LONG-TERM LIABILITIES
Long-term liabilities include those obligations that will extend beyond one year or the normal 
operating cycle, whichever is longer. A common long-term liability is a mortgage payable.
A mortgage is a written agreement specifying that if the borrower does not repay 
a debt, the lender has the right to take over specific property to satisfy the debt. When 
the debt is paid, the mortgage becomes void. Mortgage Payable is an account that is 
used to reflect an obligation that is secured by a mortgage on certain property.
OWNER’S EQUITY
The permanent owner’s equity accounts reported on the balance sheet are determined 
by the type of organization. The accounts for a sole proprietorship, a partnership, and 
a corporation differ. Northern Micro is a sole proprietorship and reports one owner’s 
equity account, Gary L. Fishel, Capital. The balance of this account is taken from the 
statement of owner’s equity. Partnerships are illustrated in Chapter 19 and corpora-
tions are discussed in Chapters 20 and 21.
The current portion of long-
term debt, the amount due 
within one year, is reported 
as a current liability. The 
remainder is reported under 
long-term liabilities.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS
Both management and creditors are interested in using the financial statements to 
evaluate the financial condition and profitability of the firm. This can be done by 
making a few simple calculations.
BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS
Recall the following:
1.  Current assets include cash, items that will be converted to cash, and items that 
will be consumed within one year.
2. Current liabilities are obligations that will require the use of current assets.
Thus, the difference between current assets and current liabilities represents the amount 
of capital the business has available for current operations. This is called working capital.
Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities

financial ratios.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
The balance sheet in Figure 15-6 shows that Northern Micro has current assets of 
$54,000 and current liabilities of $19,450. Thus, the working capital at year end is 
$34,550 ($54,000  $19,450). This amount should be more than adequate to satisfy 
current operating requirements.
Two measures of the firm’s ability to pay its current liabilities are the current ratio 
and quick ratio. The formulas for calculating these ratios are as follows:
=
=
=
=
=
=

Current Liabilities
$19,450
2.8 to 1
Quick Ratio

$35,000
Current Liabilities

1.8 to 1
Northern Micro’s current ratio of 2.8 to 1 is quite high, which indicates a favorable 
financial position. The traditional “rule of thumb” has been that a current ratio should 
be about 2 to 1, but many businesses operate successfully on a current ratio of 1.5 to 
1. Although a rule of thumb is helpful, it is better to compare an individual company 
to industry averages, which are available in most public libraries or on the Internet.
Quick assets include cash and all other current assets that can be converted into cash 
quickly, such as accounts receivable and temporary investments. Temporary investments 
are discussed in more advanced textbooks. The balance sheet in Figure 15-6 shows total 
quick assets of $35,000 ($20,000 in cash + $15,000 in accounts receivable). This pro-
duces a quick ratio of 1.8 to 1. Quick assets appear to be more than adequate to meet 
current obligations. The traditional rule of thumb has been that a quick ratio should be 
about 1 to 1, but many businesses operate successfully on a quick ratio of 0.6 to 1.
INTERSTATEMENT ANALYSIS
Interstatement analysis provides a comparison of the relationships between selected 
income statement and balance sheet amounts. A good example of interstatement 
analysis is the ratio of net income to owner’s equity in the business. This ratio is known 
as return on owner’s equity.

The statement of owner’s equity in Figure 15-5 shows that the owner’s equity of 
Northern Micro was $104,400 on January 1 and $117,050 on December 31. The net 
income for the year of $22,650 is 20.5% of the average owner’s equity. A comparison 
of this ratio with the return on owner’s equity in prior years should be of interest to the 
owner. It may also be of interest to compare the return on owner’s equity of Northern 
Micro with the same ratio for other businesses of comparable nature and size.
A second ratio involving both income statement and balance sheet accounts is a 
measure of the time required to collect cash from credit customers. This financial 
measure is often computed in two ways. The accounts receivable turnover is the 
number of times the accounts receivable “turned over,” or were collected, during the 
accounting period. Of course, a higher number indicates that cash is collected more 
quickly. This ratio is calculated as follows:
LEARNING KEY
Ratio analysis is most informative 
when the ratios are compared 
with past performance and with 
those of similar businesses.
Information on industry 
averages is available in 
various publications from 
Dun & Bradstreet, Standard 
& Poor’s, and Moody’s.

The average collection period is calculated by dividing the number of days in the 
year (365) by the rate of turnover to determine the number of days credit customers 
take to pay for their purchases. Northern Micro’s customers are taking about 42 days.
365 days ÷ 8.8 = 41.5 days
Comparing the average collection period with a business’s credit terms offers an 
indication of whether customers are paying within the terms. If Northern Micro 
allows credit terms of n/45, an average collection period of 41.5 days would suggest 
that customers are paying on a timely basis.
A third ratio involving both income statement and balance sheet accounts is the rate 
of inventory turnover. This is the number of times the merchandise inventory turned 
over, or was sold, during the accounting period. This ratio is calculated as follows:
=
Inventory Turnover
Cost of Goods Sold for the Period
Average Inventory
If inventory is taken only at the end of each accounting period, the average inven-
tory for the period can be calculated by adding the beginning and ending inventories 
and dividing their sum by two. Northern Micro’s turnover for the year ended 
December 31 is computed as follows:
Cost of goods sold for the period

Net credit sales is generally 
not reported in the financial 
statements. Use net sales, 
instead. As long as the pro-
portion of cash and credit 
sales is reasonably stable over 
time, this ratio will provide a 
reasonable measure of the 
business’s ability to collect 
receivables in a timely manner 
from year to year.

PART 3 
Accounting for a Merchandising Business
The average days to sell inventory can be computed by dividing the number of 
days in the year (365) by the inventory turnover. For Northern Micro, it takes about 
two months.
365 days ÷ 5.1
71.6 days
=
The higher the rate of inventory turnover, the smaller the profit required on each 
dollar of sales to produce a satisfactory gross profit. This is because the increase in the 
number of units sold offsets the smaller amount of gross profit earned per unit. For 
example, grocery stores have a very small gross profit on each item sold, but make up 
for this with a rapid inventory turnover. Other types of businesses, jewelers for exam-
ple, need a high gross profit on each item because their inventory turnover is quite 
slow. Evaluations of Northern Micro’s rate of inventory turnover would require com-
parison with prior years, other companies, or its industry.

CLOSING ENTRIES
Closing entries for a service business were illustrated in Chapter 6. The process is 
essentially the same for a merchandising business. All revenues and expenses reported 
on the income statement must be closed to Income Summary. Then, the income sum-
mary and drawing accounts are closed to the owner’s capital account. Keep in mind, 
however, that a few new accounts were needed for a merchandising business. These 
include Sales Returns and Allowances, Sales Discounts, Purchases Returns and 
Allowances, and Purchases Discounts. Since these are temporary accounts reported on 
the income statement, they also must be closed. The easiest way to complete the clos-
ing process is by using the work sheet to prepare the closing entries in four basic steps, 
as illustrated in Figures 15-7 and 15-8.
LO5 Prepare closing entries 
for a merchandising 
business.
THE CLOSING PROCESS FOR A MERCHANDISING BUSINESS
STEP 1 All income statement accounts with credit balances are debited, with an offsetting credit to Income
 
Summary. 
STEP 2 All income statement accounts with debit balances are credited, with an offsetting debit to Income
 
Summary. 
STEP 3 The resulting balance in Income Summary, which is the net income or loss for the period, is transferred to
 
the owner’s capital account. 
STEP 4 The balance in the owner’s drawing account is transferred to the owner’s capital account.

FIGURE 15-9 Post-Closing Trial Balance
The post-closing trial 
balance must be prepared by 
taking the balances from the 
general ledger accounts. It 
should not be prepared from 
the balances on the work 
sheet. Using the general 
ledger accounts makes 
sure that all adjusting and 
closing entries were entered 
and posted correctly.
POST-CLOSING TRIAL BALANCE
A trial balance of the general ledger accounts taken after the temporary owner’s equity 
accounts have been closed is called a post-closing trial balance. The purpose of the 
post-closing trial balance is to prove that the general ledger is in balance at the begin-
ning of a new accounting period, before any transactions for the new accounting 
period are entered. It should also confirm that all temporary accounts have zero 
balances. Figure 15-9 shows a post-closing trial balance for Northern Micro.
A BROADER VIEW
Who Cares About Tracking 
Financial Ratios?
Tracking a business’s average collection period for receivables can 
help investors avoid making poor investments. Take the case of 
Kendall Square, a supercomputer maker. In an effort to increase 
sales and profits, Kendall Square recognized large amounts of 
revenues that had not actually been earned. Since no cash was 
received for these sales, accounts receivable increased dramati-
cally (by 57%). Similarly, the average collection period increased 
to 157 days. Large increases in the average collection period 
should warn potential investors that something might be wrong. 
What happened at Kendall Square? Over $10 million of sales on 
account was never collected. This was equal to almost half of 
the revenues reported for the year. When eventually discovered, 
Kendall Square’s stock price fell from $24.25 to $2.28 a share.

REVERSING ENTRIES
Numerous adjusting entries are needed at the end of the accounting period to bring 
the account balances up to date for presentation in the financial statements. Although 
not required, some of these adjusting entries should be reversed at the beginning of the 
next accounting period. This is done to simplify the recording of transactions in the 
new accounting period. As its name implies, a reversing entry is the reverse or opposite 
of the adjusting entry.

To see the advantage of using reversing entries, let’s consider the effect of reversing 
Northern Micro’s adjusting entry for wages earned, but not paid, at the end of the year. 
Figure 15-10 shows that accrued wages on December 31 were $450. These wages are for 
work performed by the employees on the last three days of the accounting period ($150 × 
3 = $450). The employees will be paid on Friday, January 2, the normal payday.
Note that the adjusting and closing entries are the same, regardless of whether a 
reversing entry is made. However, the reversing entry on January 1 has an impact on 
the entry made when the employees are paid. Without a reversing entry, the payment 
on January 2, 20-2, must be split between reduction of the wages payable account for 
wages earned in 20-1 and Wages Expense for wages earned in 20-2. With a reversing 
entry, the bookkeeper simply debits Wages Expense and credits Cash, as is done on 
every other payday. Thus, the likelihood of error is reduced. Reversing entries are par-
ticularly important in large businesses where the individual recording the entry for 
wages may not even know what adjusting entries were made.
Not all adjusting entries should be reversed. To determine which adjusting entries 
to reverse, follow this rule: Except for the first year of operations, reverse all adjusting 
entries that increase an asset or liability account from a zero balance.
Except for the first year of operation, merchandise inventory, and contra-assets 
like accumulated depreciation, will have existing balances. Thus, they should never be 
reversed. The adjusting entries for Northern Micro are shown in Figure 15-11. Note 
that only the adjustment for accrued wages is reversed in Figure 15-12.

entries.

LO5  Prepare closing entries for a 
merchandising business.
The four steps in the closing process for a merchandising busi-
ness are as follows:
STEP 1  All income statement accounts with credit balances are 
debited, with an offsetting credit to Income Summary.
STEP 2  All income statement accounts with debit balances are 
credited, with an offsetting debit to Income Summary.
STEP 3  The resulting balance in Income Summary, which is the 
net income or loss for the period, is transferred to the 
owner’s capital account.
STEP 4  The balance in the owner’s drawing account is trans-
ferred to the owner’s capital account.
LO6  Prepare reversing entries.
Use the following rule to determine which adjusting entries to 
reverse:
Except for the first year of operations, reverse all adjusting 
entries that increase an asset or liability account from a zero balance.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
A friend of yours has the opportunity to invest in a small business. She has come to you 
for advice on how she might determine whether this would be a good investment. In 
particular, she is concerned about how long it takes to sell the merchandise and collect 
receivables. Draft a memo suggesting various ratios that should be computed to evalu-
ate the business’s profitability, ability to pay its current obligations, and time required 
to sell inventory and collect receivables.

one of his first clients. Louise employs a bookkeeper, Martha Halling, who does the 
daily journal entries and prepares a year-to-date trial balance at the end of each month. 
Martha gives the December 31 trial balance to a CPA to make the adjustments and 
generate the financial statements. As Brian was looking through Louise Michener’s 
books, he noticed two things. First, in each of the last three years, a different CPA had 
prepared the financial statements. Second, the amount shown on the December 31 trial 
balance for miscellaneous expense was quite high this year compared to prior years. 
Brian called Martha to find out if she knew why miscellaneous expense had such a high 
balance. Martha’s response was “I just do what Louise tells me to do. If she wants to 
charge personal expenses to the company, it’s none of my business.”
1. What should Brian do?
2. How might Brian’s decision affect Martha? Has Martha done anything 
unethical?
3. Write a short letter from Brian to Louise explaining why personal items should 
not be charged to a business.
4. In small groups, discuss the ethical responsibilities of an accountant relating to a 
client’s books.

Module          Accounting for a Professional Service Business: The Combination Journal
619
Professional service businesses include law, den-
tistry, medicine, optometry, architecture, engi-
neering, and accounting. As discussed in Chapter 
5, many small professional service businesses do 
not need to prepare financial statements in strict 
compliance with generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP). This is because they don’t 
need to raise large amounts of money from 
investors or creditors who expect GAAP finan-
cial statements. Thus, many of these businesses 
use the modified cash basis. This simplifies the 
accounting process and provides results similar 
to the accrual basis if receivables and payables 
are minimal. If at some point GAAP financial 
statements are needed, an accountant can con-
vert the modified cash basis statements to the 
accrual basis which is required under GAAP.
Small professional service businesses 
may also use a combination journal as the 
book of original entry, instead of a general 
journal, or special journals (illustrated in 
Chapter 12). The purpose of this module is to 
illustrate accounting for a professional service 
business using the modified cash basis of accounting and a combination journal.
THE MODIFIED CASH AND ACCRUAL BASES 
OF ACCOUNTING
The modified cash and accrual bases of accounting are the same except for three types 
of events. The accounting differences for these three events are shown in Figure M-1. 
First, expenses for services received are not recorded until paid. Thus, accounts payable 
is not used under the modified cash basis for services received. Second, under the 
modified cash basis, accrued expenses are not recognized. Examples of accrued

between the modified 
cash and accrual bases 
of accounting.

Module 
Accounting for a Professional Service Business: The Combination Journal
expenses include wages that were earned by the employees, but not yet paid, and inter-
est expense that has been incurred, but not yet paid. Thus, no end-of-period adjusting 
entries are made for these types of events. This means that other records must be used 
to maintain information on amounts owed for wages, interest, and other expenses. 
Typically, these bills are filed chronologically by due date.
Finally, under the modified cash basis, revenues from services performed on 
account are not recorded until cash is received. Thus, no accounts receivable are 
entered in the accounting system. This means that other records must be used to main-
tain information on amounts owed by clients and patients. These records generally 
include an appointment record and a client or patient ledger record. These records are 
illustrated in Figures M-2 and M-3.
The modified cash basis 
is the same as the accrual 
basis, except receivables 
and payables are not rec-
ognized for revenues and 
operating expenses.

ACCOUNTING FOR A PROFESSIONAL 
SERVICE BUSINESS
The appointment record, shown in Figure M-2, is used to schedule appointments and 
to maintain a record of the services rendered, fees charged, and payments received. It 
also serves as a source document for the patient ledger records, shown in Figure M-3, 
which show the amount owed by each client or patient for services performed. A copy 
of this record may also be used for billing purposes.
LO2 Describe special 
records for a 
professional service 
business using the 
modified cash basis.
THE COMBINATION JOURNAL
The two-column general journal illustrated in Chapter 4 can be used to enter every 
transaction of a business. However, in most businesses, there are many similar transac-
tions that involve the same account or accounts. Cash receipts and payments are good 
examples. Suppose that in a typical month there are 30 transactions that result in an 
increase in cash and 40 transactions that cause a decrease in cash. In a two-column 
general journal, this would require entering the account Cash 70 times, using a journal 
line each time.
A considerable amount of time and space is saved if a journal contains special 
columns for cash debits and cash credits. At the end of the month, the special columns 
for cash debits and credits are totaled. The total of the Cash Debit column is posted 
as one amount to the debit side of the cash account and the total of the Cash Credit 
column is posted as one amount to the credit side of the cash account. Thus, instead 
of receiving 70 postings, Cash receives only two: one debit and one credit. This method 
requires much less time and reduces the risk of making posting errors.
If other accounts are used frequently, special columns can be added for these 
accounts. General Debit and General Credit columns are used for accounts not 
affected by many transactions. A journal with such special and general columns is 
called a combination journal.
Many small professional enterprises use a combination journal to record business 
transactions. To demonstrate the use of a combination journal, let’s consider the 
medical practice of Dr. Ray Bonita. Bonita uses the modified cash basis of accounting. 
The chart of accounts for his medical practice is shown in Figure M-4. The transac-
tions for the month of June, his first month in practice, are provided in Figure M-5.
LO3 Describe and use a 
combination journal to 
record transactions of

business.

(Debit), and Office Supplies (Debit). Special columns were set up for these accounts 
because they will be used frequently in this business. Other businesses might set up 
special columns for different accounts depending on the frequency of their use. Of 
course, General Debit and Credit columns for transactions affecting other accounts are 
also needed.
JOURNALIZING IN A COMBINATION 
JOURNAL
The following procedures were used to enter the transactions for Bonita for June:
General Columns
Enter transactions in the general columns in a manner similar to that used for the 
general journal. Look at the entry for June 5 in Figure M-6.
(a)  Enter the name of the debited account (Office Furniture) first at the extreme left 
of the Description column.
(b)  Enter the amount in the General Debit column.
(c)  Enter the name of the account credited (Accounts Payable––Bittle’s Furniture) on 
the next line, indented.
(d)  Enter the amount in the General Credit column.
General and Special Accounts
Some transactions affect both a general account and a special account. Look at the 
entry for June 1 in Figure M-6.
(a) Enter the name of the general account in the Description column.
(b) Enter the amount in the General Debit or Credit column.
(c)  Enter the amount of the debit or credit for the special account in the appropriate 
special column.
Enter all of this information on the same line.
Special Accounts
Many transactions affect only special accounts. Look at the entry for June 6 in 
Figure M-6.
(a) Enter the amounts in the appropriate special debit and credit columns.
(b) Do not enter anything in the Description column.
(c)  Place a dash in the Posting Reference column to indicate that this amount is not 
posted individually. It will be posted as part of the total of the special column at 
the end of the month. (The posting process is described later in this chapter.)
Description Column
In general, the Description column is used for the following:
(a) To enter the account titles for the General Debit and General Credit columns.
(b)  To identify specific creditors when assets are purchased on account (see entry for 
June 5).
 
 Note: For firms using the accrual basis of accounting, this column also would be 
used to identify specific customers receiving services on account (accounts receiv-
able) and specific businesses that provided services on account (accounts payable).
LEARNING KEY

(c)  To identify specific creditors when payments are made on account (see entry for 
June 22).
(d)  To identify adjusting, closing, and reversing entries.
(e)  To identify amounts forwarded. When more than one page is required during an 
accounting period, amounts from the previous page are brought forward. In this 
situation, “Amounts Forwarded” is entered in the Description column on the 
first line.
PROVING THE COMBINATION JOURNAL
At the end of the accounting period, all columns of the combination journal should be 
totaled and ruled. The sum of the debit columns should be compared with the sum of 
the credit columns to verify that they are equal. The proving of Bonita’s combination 
journal for the month of June is shown at the bottom of Figure M-6 on page 623.
POSTING FROM THE COMBINATION JOURNAL
Accounts debited or credited in the general columns are posted individually through-
out the month in the same manner followed for the general journal. A different pro-
cedure is used for special columns. Figure M-7 describes the procedures to follow in 
posting from the combination journal.
Portions of the combination journal in Figure M-6 and general ledger accounts for 
Cash, Office Furniture, Accounts Payable, and Medical Fees are shown in Figure M-8 
to illustrate the effects of this posting process. Note that the individual debits and 
credits in the General columns are posted individually throughout the month. Only the 
totals of the Special columns are posted at the end of the month.
To see the advantages of posting a combination journal compared with the general 
journal, simply compare the accounts in Figure M-8 with the same accounts in 
Chapter 4, Figure 4-12. Note the number of postings required for the general journal 
and combination journal.

GENERAL COLUMNS
Since a combination journal is being used, enter “CJ” and the page number in 
each general ledger account’s Posting Reference column. Once the amount has 
been posted to the general ledger account, the account number is entered in the 
Posting Reference column of the combination journal. Accounts in the general 
column should be posted daily. The check marks at the bottom of the General 
Debit and Credit columns are entered at the end of the month and serve as a 
reminder that these totals should not be posted.
SPECIAL COLUMNS
1.  Post the totals of the special columns to the appropriate general ledger 
accounts.
2.  Once posted, enter the account number (in parentheses) beneath the 
column and “CJ” and the page number in each general ledger account’s 
Posting Reference column.
LEARNING KEY
Amounts in the General column 
are posted individually. Only the 
totals of the special columns are 
posted.

Clearly, using the combination journal can be quite efficient.
DETERMINING THE CASH BALANCE
The debits and credits to Cash are not posted until the end of the accounting 
period. Therefore, the cash balance must be computed when this information is 
needed. The cash balance may be computed at any time during the month by taking 
the beginning balance and adding total cash debits and subtracting total cash cred-
its to date. Figure M-9 shows the calculation of Bonita’s cash balance on June 15.
PERFORMING END-OF-PERIOD WORK FOR 
A PROFESSIONAL SERVICE BUSINESS
Once the combination journal has been posted to the general ledger, the end-of-
period work sheet is prepared in the same way as described in Chapter 5. Recall 
that financial statements are prepared and end-of-period work is normally per-
formed at the end of the fiscal year. For illustration purposes, we will perform these 
activities at the end of Bonita’s first month of operations.
PREPARING THE WORK SHEET
Bonita’s work sheet is illustrated in Figure M-10 on page 629. Adjustments were made 
for the following items:
(a) Medical supplies remaining on June 30, $350.
(b) Office supplies remaining on June 30, $100.
(c) Prepaid insurance expired during June, $500.
(d) Depreciation on office furniture for June, $200.
(e) Depreciation on medical equipment for June, $300.
PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Since this is the first month of Dr. Bonita’s medical practice, we know the beginning 
balance of owner’s equity is zero. We also know the $50,000 balance in the capital 
account on the work sheet is the result of his investment during June. With this infor-
mation, we can prepare the financial statements directly from the work sheet. In future 
periods, the balance of the capital account on the work sheet will reflect the beginning 
balance plus any additional investments. Thus, we will need to examine Bonita’s capi-
tal account for investments made during the period and report those separately on the 
statement of owner’s equity. Bonita's financial statements are illustrated in Figure 
M-11 on page 630.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
Key Points to Remember
LO1  Explain the differences between 
the modified cash and accrual 
bases of accounting.
As shown below, there are three basic differences between the 
modified cash and accrual bases of accounting.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MODIFIED CASH AND ACCRUAL BASES OF ACCOUNTING
EVENT
ACCRUAL BASIS
MODIFIED CASH BASIS
Expenses
  Bills for services received, 
but not yet paid.
Expense
  Accounts Payable
No entry.
(Record when paid.)
  Wages earned by employees, 
but not yet paid.
Wages Expense
  Wages Payable
No entry.
(Record when paid.)
Revenues
  Services provided on account.
Accounts Receivable
  Professional Fees
No entry.
(Record when cash is received.)
LO2  Describe special records for a 
professional service business 
using the modified cash basis.
Special records are required for a professional service business 
using the modified cash basis. Since accounts receivable are 
not entered in the accounting system, other records must be 
maintained to keep track of amounts owed by clients and 
patients. These records generally include an appointment record 
and a client or patient ledger record.
LO3  Describe and use a combination 
journal to record transactions of 
a professional service business.
A combination journal is used by some businesses to improve the 
efficiency of recording and posting transactions. It includes gen-
eral and special columns. The headings for a typical combination 
journal for a doctor’s office are shown below.
LO4  Post from the combination 
journal to the general ledger.
Rules for posting a combination journal are as follows:
1.  Amounts entered in the general columns are posted 
individually to the general ledger on a daily basis.
2.  The totals of the special columns are posted to the general 
ledger at the end of the month.
LO5  Prepare a work sheet, financial 
statements, and adjusting and 
closing entries for a professional 
service business.
The work sheet, financial statements, adjusting entries, and 
closing entries are prepared in the same manner as discussed 
in Chapters 5 and 6. Remember, however, that under the 
modified cash basis, adjustments are made only for prepaid 
items and depreciation of plant and equipment.

MANAGING YOUR WRITING
 
Your friend is planning to start her own business and has asked you for advice. In 
particular, she is concerned about which method of accounting she should use. She has 
heard about the modified cash and accrual methods of accounting. However, she does 
not really understand the differences. Write a memo that explains each method and the 
type of business for which each method is most appropriate.

Accounting for a Professional Service Business: The Combination Journal
ETHICS CASE
 
Nancy Bowles, the owner of Bowles Services, a sole proprietorship, rushed into the 
office late Monday morning carrying a deposit receipt from the bank. Upon handing the 
receipt to Sarah, the accountant, she instructed her to debit Cash and credit Professional 
Fees for the full $10,000. When Sarah examined the source document, she saw that the 
cash had come from the account of Richard Bowles, Nancy’s father. Nancy explained 
to Sarah that she was applying for a bank loan and needed to “show that her company 
earned more year-to-date income than it actually had.” Nancy used the rationale that 
the company would earn at least $10,000 in revenue during the next few months but 
the financial statements the bank required were as of the end of this month.
1. Does Nancy’s explanation make sense? Is it ethical?
2. How should this transaction be entered in Bowles Services’ books? Does it mat-
ter whether the modified cash basis or accrual basis of accounting is used?
3. Make a written list of all the consequences Nancy might face as a result of 
recording this transaction as a debit to Cash and a credit to Professional Fees.
4. Break up into groups of two and role play Nancy’s and Sarah’s point of view in 
this situation.
MASTERY PROBLEM
John McRoe opened a tennis resort in June 20--. Most guests register for one week, 
arriving on Sunday afternoon and returning home the following Saturday afternoon. 
Guests stay at an adjacent hotel. The tennis resort provides lunch and dinner. Dining

seuse, physical therapist, and athletic trainers are on call to assure the proper combina-
tion of diet and exercise. The chart of accounts and transactions for the month of June 
are provided below. McRoe uses the modified cash basis of accounting.

was for consulting fees earned in May, but received in June.
2. Consulting fees earned in June, but to be received in July, $2,000.
3. Supplies on hand at the beginning of June amounted to $500. All purchases of 
supplies are made on account. Supplies purchased during June, $1,000. At the 
end of June, $600 worth of supplies remained unused.
4. Paid cash on account to suppliers during June, $800. $200 of the $800 was for 
purchases of supplies made in May.
5. Wages paid to an assistant, $2,000. Of this $2,000, $300 had been earned in May. 
In addition, the assistant earned $500 in June, which will be paid next month.
