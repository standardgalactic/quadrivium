Foreword
At some point in an indeterminate future historians will argue about how 
it came to pass that towards the end of the twentieth century and a lit-
tle way into the twenty-first, otherwise intelligent people claimed that the 
Internet was entitled to sit, indeed according to them optimally should sit, 
outside the ordinary discourse of public policy making and law making. 
Governments, Parliaments, Senates were held to be if not exactly completely 
redundant then certainly as being of limited use when grappling with both 
the challenges and the opportunities which this singular and exciting tech-
nology was starting to present.
Having fought in some cases for centuries to curb the previously un-
accountable powers of Princes by establishing democratic institutions which 
could bring them to book or force them to act in ways which were more ac-
ceptable to the majority, somehow the idea got around that we the people 
should now repose greater trust in the benign operation of large corpora-
tions. Even in those countries where politicians are not universally loved 
and admired, to many this seemed like a much less appealing alternative.
Governments and legislators have a unique obligation to be forever 
watchful of the wider public interest. This is not an obligation they can 
resign from or have removed simply because something comes along that 
is new or difficult. Yet the arrival of the Internet in our midst undoubtedly 
did create novel demands on the machinery of government. It did make it 
necessary to look for better designs for the policy and law-making processes 
which impact upon it. Joseph Savirimuthu’s landmark book maps out the 
early efforts to do that. Moreover, Savirimuthu writes with an elegance and 
lucidity which should broaden the book’s appeal well beyond the commu-
nity of lawyers, child care professionals and law enforcement officers who 
are likely to be among the first to buy it.
As I have suggested, some did and still do argue that Governments should 
absent themselves completely from the stage. If there was ever the mer-
est sliver of a possibility such a techno-libertarian vision might become a 
reality, which I doubt, it quickly foundered. The cases which Savirimuthu 
discusses in this book are all the proof anyone needs to show that the crea-
tors of the Internet had not fully thought through key aspects of their pro-
ject. The unborn historians referred to earlier will owe Savirimuthu a great 
debt for bringing together the evidence in the way he has.
The men and women who put together the Internet had no notion it 
would end up in the bedrooms of 11-year-olds in Birmingham and Benin. It 
would have filled them with horror and given pause for more than a little 
thought if they ever imagined their invention would completely transform

xx Foreword
and hugely expand “the market” for child pornography. The possibility 
that by building Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) 
they would be paving the way for even one man to locate, kidnap, rape and 
murder a single child would have propelled some to abandon computer sci-
ence altogether and take up flower arranging. Yet all this has happened and 
much besides. The facts are assembled and documented with great care and 
precision by Savirimuthu, not as a ghoulish catalogue or an indictment but 
as a scholarly call for us all to do better.
The Internet grew up in and burst out of the small and trusting world 
of the Academy. It had tootled along for years as an aid to research and 
communication within communities which, originally, typically were small 
enough and intimate enough, if not exactly for everyone to know everyone, 
at least to have a shared ethos that allowed a sense of a self-governing col-
lective responsibility to emerge. Even as private companies started to dis-
cover the value of e-mail and FTP servers in the 1980s we were still a long 
way from the sort of Internet we have today.
The development of the web in the early 1990s changed everything. It 
heralded the arrival of a new, heterogeneous, gigantic clientele, including 
in its midst enormous numbers of children and young people. But the same 
notions of independence from officialdom and authority persisted, particu-
larly among old hands. “We didn’t need Government to get us here and we 
definitely don’t need them now.” In fact, a large part of the funds which 
paid for the early research which paved the way for the Internet was pro-
vided courtesy of different though mainly American taxpayers, but let that 
pass.
Could the Internet have been constructed in a different way which would 
have avoided or reduced its potential to do the kind of evil I have outlined 
and which Savirimuthu analyses? Absolutely. Does it matter that it wasn’t? 
Probably, but we are where we are. We all have to deal with it now. The 
Internet is an egregious example of the doctrine of unforeseen and unin-
tended consequences.
The Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
has interesting parallels. The benefits of that revolution were and remain 
overwhelming. Few would renounce them. It was not deliberately designed 
to pollute rivers and poison the air or generate greenhouse gases in a way 
which would eventually threaten to extinguish all life on Earth. Eventually 
we caught on to the downside and began to take steps to address it.
The benefits of the Internet to society in general and in this case to chil-
dren and young people in particular likewise are immeasurable. It is hard to 
find anyone who wants to turn the clock back completely even though daily 
we read how the technology has led not only to the assaults on children 
which Savirimuthu describes, but also to a host of other antisocial behav-
iours such as identity theft, breaches of national security, fraud, invasions 
of privacy and so on. Few if any of these crimes are in and of themselves

Foreword xxi
wholly new but the Internet has recast and promoted them on a completely 
new scale. Why are things allowed to continue in this way? Can’t someone 
tell someone else to put it right?
Here is where the special circumstances surrounding the Internet force-
fully rear their head. Governance. A key theme in Savirimuthu’s book.
Famously the Internet is borderless and can collapse time and space. Yet 
it expresses itself in tangible ways, inside national jurisdictions within par-
ticular time zones. This can raise fiendishly difficult questions both about 
whose law applies and how and by whom it might be enforced. The role the 
Internet plays in much of modern social, economic and political life and, in 
this context, the fact that children are in the middle of the mix adds greatly 
to the sensitivities and tensions.
Henry Kissinger was once supposed to have said “Who do you call to speak 
to Europe?” Even if the words never actually passed his lips this remains a 
powerful metaphor. “Who do you call if you want to speak to the Internet 
industry?”
In the beginning when one spoke about “the Internet industry” it gener-
ally meant only Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the companies providing 
basic connectivity to cyberspace. Pretty obviously ISPs are still massively 
important players. Without them there would be no gateway. They hold 
basic information about users’ activities, information which is often essen-
tial to law enforcement investigations or other legal processes.
Today other kinds of online service providers have come to dominate the 
value chain and public perceptions of what the Internet now is. Some of the 
largest, best known, most successful and important online businesses have 
only a marginal or no involvement at all in providing direct connections to 
the Internet. They range from giants such as Facebook and Google through 
to hundreds of thousands of small businesses perhaps being run by individ-
uals in their spare time from their garage, kitchen table or university dorm.
Hardware manufacturers produce ever more inventive and interesting 
ways of going online. Some of these have a particular appeal to children and 
young people. Sony, Nintendo, Xbox, Nokia, Samsung and Apple constitute 
a major part of the modern ecology of the Internet.
Out of this latticework grew an expectation that private-sector actors 
needed to embrace a larger set of responsibilities. Around the globe a range 
of self-regulatory and co-regulatory models emerged, sometimes supported 
or led by legislation and sometimes not, but all specifically designed to 
address the interests of children and young people as Internet users. How 
well they are working is discussed with great perceptiveness by Savirimuthu. 
He provides us with a roadmap and an incisive commentary.
As we survey the terrain of governance we see that one of the key global 
institutions responsible for the ongoing overall management of the Internet, 
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), has 
no direct representation from any Governments or any inter-Governmental 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

xxii Foreword
agencies on any of its decision-making bodies although it does have a 
Government Advisory Committee which provides both with an oppor-
tunity to air their views on matters within ICANN’s remit.1 Standards bod-
ies such as the Internet Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web 
Consortium have persons associated with them who work for Governments 
or Governmental agencies but the narrow, essentially technical nature of 
the remits of those bodies limits any scope for influencing a broader policy 
agenda.
This lack of a single point of accountability or reference creates distur-
bances and eddies which at times have spilled over into evident frustra-
tion at the lack of responsiveness to what many national Governments feel 
are their legitimate concerns. The final communiqué of the 2011 G8 meet-
ing made express references to the position of children and young people 
as Internet users and as potential victims of trafficking or abuse medi-
ated through the Internet. For all that was said at the time about President 
Sarkozy’s alleged grandstanding by bringing such issues to the G8 meeting 
and making so much of them, the very fact that many of his points were 
accepted and reflected in the final communiqué was very telling.
The abuse of anonymity is at the root of many of the Internet’s enduring 
problems. A paedophile or someone wishing to exchange child abuse images 
would be more constricted or limited in what they could do if reliable strong 
authentication was required before they could sign on or swap files. But any 
attempt to deal with an issue like anonymity which is seen to have been 
inspired by a political institution such as a Government not unnaturally 
raises concerns.
Similarly if a Government advocates the use of technical tools, for ex-
ample, filters to block access to age-inappropriate material, might they in 
truth be preparing the way for a bigger deployment of filtering which had 
an ideological or other kind of illiberal edge to it? To put it another way, do 
Governments invoke the language of child protection as a cover for an un-
stated political agenda which might threaten human rights?
Against that it has to be asked if Internet companies on occasion play 
on and perhaps even play up these fears? Again, to state the proposition 
slightly differently, do otherwise hard-headed capitalist enterprises some-
times adopt the altruistic language of human rights as a convenient foil to 
help them ward off demands by Governments to put more resources into 
things which, as they see it, make it harder to make a profit?
Often consumers are asked to put their faith not in Governments but in 
the operation of the market. That might have something going for it as an 
argument if there was any sign that the markets in question worked at all 
efficiently. However, it is self-evident that while several Internet companies 
have been spectacularly successful in getting people to sign up for their 
services and spend money with them, they have failed, not completely but 
still on a monumental scale to ensure their customers understand how their

Foreword xxiii
products works or what they should do to use them safely. Can’t the same 
magic and sparkle that delivered one also be turned on to deliver the other? 
If not, why not? The word “proportionality” usually gets an airing about 
now but, like beauty, proportionality is in the eye of the beholder.
My own view is that it is very much in the longer-term interests of the 
Internet itself and in particular of the companies that currently dominate 
it for Governments to be fully convinced that their legitimate concerns 
for the welfare of their citizens, perhaps particularly in relation to chil-
dren and young people, are taken seriously and are acted upon reasonably 
promptly. Otherwise there is a very great likelihood that not-so-eventually 
Governments will conclude that Internet businesses are taking unfair ad-
vantage of the lack of any specific legislative or other body which could 
hold them to account more directly. This will lead to the further and rapid 
fragmentation of the Internet as different jurisdictions produce a variety of 
locally grown solutions.
To some extent this is already happening. A number of countries have 
introduced laws and regulations which they feel better suit their cultural, 
legal and political traditions because their local “branches” of the Internet 
industry have not come forward voluntarily to respond in what was con-
sidered an appropriate way. Savirimuthu documents many examples in an 
accessible style which many non-lawyers will greatly appreciate.
The key point, though, is that for all the examples that can be pointed to 
of local laws and regulation that might exist now, many more Governments 
have refrained from such radicalism in the belief that a co-operative 
approach will be better for everyone. Should faith in voluntary co-operation 
finally be shown to be a fruitless path, a proliferation of new national or re-
gional laws and regulations will quickly follow.
In The Doctor’s Dilemma, written in 1911, George Bernard Shaw famously 
observed that all professions are conspiracies against the laity. What he meant 
was that groups of people who congregate around particular disciplines, be 
they carpenters or astrophysicists, tend to develop ways of working, and 
above all ways of describing what they do when they are working, which are 
more or less deliberately designed to separate themselves from everyone else. 
Maybe this does not matter very much if you work in a discrete or narrow 
space but it matters a very great deal if, as with the Internet, your canvass 
is pervasive and global. Savirimuthu’s book will have great value in helping 
non-techies and non-experts everywhere to understand the nature of the 
challenges. If, as we might reasonably hope, this leads to better-informed 
decision-making on the part of companies and Governments, children and 
young people on every continent will be in a much better place.

On 3 February 2009, it was reported by the Attorney General for Connecticut 
that 90,000 registered sex offenders were found on MySpace, a social net-
working site (Office of the Attorney General, 2009). Following the disclosure 
of the information, a press release issued by the Attorney General claimed 
that the presence of convicted sex offenders on the social networking site 
was evidence of
MySpace’s monstrously inadequate counter-measures. MySpace must 
purge these dangerous offenders now – and rid them for good. Social 
networking sites must be barred as playgrounds for predators – a very 
real threat exposed by the response to our subpoena … Law enforcement 
officials know the reality: children are solicited every day on line. All too 
often, they fall prey. Technology companies and social networking sites 
must do more – and do it now. Blaming the victim is appalling and out-
rageous. (Ibid., 2009)
Promoting trust and confidence in the online environment continues to be 
at the forefront of governments’ online child safety governance strategies. 
At the heart of the ever-present concerns of parents and educators are the 
risks children are inevitably exposed to when using the Internet and com-
munication technologies like mobile phones, laptops, online games and so-
cial networking sites (Web 2.0 technologies) when interacting with peers, 
online communities and social media (Ito, 2008). The popularity of these 
communities for children demonstrates how Web 2.0 technologies shape 
the way individuals now interact with information, acquire knowledge, 
consume entertainment and view their lifestyle choices (Benkler, 2006). It 
is perhaps more accurate to say that convergence now creates new spaces for 
children to use the technological affordances and equip them with tools 
which can be used to define their lives, identities, audiences and relation-
ships (Fox, 2008). Online child safety governance has to address a complex 
task: balancing empowerment and protection issues raised by children’s

access to and use of Web 2.0 technologies. To paraphrase the opening obser-
vation of the EC Green Paper – policy decisions now have the potential to 
shape the way Web 2.0 technologies and social media are delivered to and 
consumed by children (European Commission, 1996b,c). An imbalance in 
online child safety governance has immediate and long-term consequences – 
the overreaching of protective and precautionary impulses can undermine 
children’s autonomy and privacy. Conversely, indifference, apathy and ig-
norance can result in children exposing themselves and their peers to ser-
ious harm and abuse. Getting the balance right is an immense challenge. 
As Fish J. observed in his opening passage in the Supreme Court of Canada 
hearing in R v Legare (2009), the threats posed to children are embedded in 
network structures and information flows:
The Internet is an open door to knowledge, entertainment, communica-
tion – and exploitation ... Shielded by the anonymity of an assumed online 
name and profile, they aspire to gain the trust of their targeted victims 
through computer “chats” – and then to tempt or entice them into sexual 
activity, over the Internet or, still worse, in person. (paragraphs 1–2)
Human-centred computing and mobile computing networks make it diffi-
cult to ascertain the identity of the participants children are connected with 
or the invisible audiences connected with them (Casey, 2004: 11). Digital 
information by its nature can be easily stored, reproduced, manipulated and 
disseminated without the owner’s knowledge or consent. Mobile and com-
munication technologies provide new avenues through which children are 
exposed to such harms. Individuals and criminal organised gangs now use 
Web 2.0 technologies to engage in the commercial and sexual exploitation of 
children on a worldwide basis. For example, in the Canadian case of HMTQ 
v Bock (2010), the offender connected to a peer-to-peer (P2P) network to not 
only view child pornography content made available by other users but the 
technological affordances also made it easier for him to share his own collec-
tion of pictures and videos with a global audience. In R v Costello (2011), the 
offender used communication platforms like chat rooms and instant mes-
saging (IM) communication to transmit indecent material to minors with 
the intention of procuring victims to engage in sexual activity, contrary to 
the anti-sexual grooming provisions in the Commonwealth and Queensland 
legislation. Phoebe Prince, a 15-year-old teenager, committed suicide after 
being victimised by peers through text messages and postings on her social 
network account (Boston Globe, 2010). Patchin and Hinduja, in their study 
of 2,423 profiles on young adolescents on MySpace, noted the risk-prone 
behaviour engaged in by many of them – posting of personal information, 
images and inappropriate content (Patchin and Hinduja, 2010a: 197–216). 
Policymakers, as a consequence, now have to contend with risks which 
are not readily visible (Van Asselt, 2005; Jasanoff, 1993). To commentators 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Introduction 5
like Smedinghoff, the safety issues encountered in this area of policymaking 
are not unique or exceptional (Smedinghoff, 2008). He is right in suggest-
ing that multiple online services and a wide array of communication media 
platforms create never-ending security problems of integrity, authenticity 
and reliability (ibid., 19–22; OECD, 2002a). The wide range of platforms 
for communication, the ease with which information about children can 
be obtained, the relative low costs for creating, storing and disseminating 
content and the targeting of potential child victims by online users present 
policymakers with some hard questions regarding the appropriate mix of 
direct State intervention, industry self-regulation and individual assumption 
of personal responsibility. This is hardly a message that policymakers, par-
ents and educators would like to hear – particularly as Web 2.0 technologies 
continue to be celebrated in glowing terms. Web 2.0 technologies present 
society with a Faustian bargain. The benefits derived from human-centred 
computing also bring with it risks of children being exposed to threats and 
vulnerabilities (OECD, 2002b). The heightened regulatory activity and anx-
iety about perceived threats facing children in the online environment can-
not be disassociated from the role played by the media in shaping public 
perceptions about the online threat landscape – a testament perhaps to the 
consequences of living in a post-modern risk society (Beck, 1992a). The 
Attorney General’s reaction is perhaps not an unconventional one. It is also 
based on some common myths: the online environment is less secure than 
the offline environment, the safety of children cannot be ensured without 
a fundamental change in the technical infrastructure and children are less 
than capable in managing online risks as opposed to offline risks.
Online child safety continues to be a topic that extends beyond the legal 
domain – children, parents, educators, child welfare organisations and in-
dustry are now regarded as having important roles to play in this area of 
public policy (UN, 2006a). There are some indications that policymakers 
are beginning to understand how creative use of governance strategies can 
promote and strengthen the rights of children, in particular, those regard-
ing the freedom to develop and live without fear of violence (Livingstone 
and Haddon, 2009b). In fairness, policymakers are now increasingly draw-
ing on research and evidence from a number of sources when responding 
to the governance challenges raised by children’s exposure to Web 2.0 tech-
nologies (Lenhart et al., 2007a; ACMA, 2009a). Attempts to use the law to 
enforce legal norms against those using Web 2.0 technologies to distribute 
illegal or inappropriate content and misusing technologies to solicit minors 
for sexual gratification and sexual activity and to victimise peers would 
appear to have been far from a perfect response to the concerns about chil-
dren’s safety in the online environment. Neither will the enactment of 
more child safety laws and increased surveillance of children and their on-
line activities magically transform the spaces children inhabit into idyllic 
settings (Jenkins, 2003: 205–21). Many of the governance challenges facing

6 Online Child Safety
policymakers, particularly in the use of the agency of the State in enforcing 
its criminal law, can be traced back to decentralised network infrastructures 
and the indeterminate properties of digital information, which make detec-
tion and prosecution difficult (Casey, 2004).
Online child safety governance: Mapping the issues
What is online child safety governance?
The phrase “online child safety governance” can be described as a process 
whereby various stakeholders now coordinate their activities to promote 
trust and confidence in children’s interaction with individuals and social 
media. For the purposes of this study, the term “governance” will be used 
as a counterpoint to regulation by “government” in the sense of describing 
the process by which three groups of stakeholders engage in the participa-
tory and decision-making processes: (i) those who make the technologies; 
(ii) those who make consumption of the technologies and services available; 
and (iii) those who consume the technologies and services. The viability of 
a Multi-Stakeholder Internet Governance strategy (MSIG) is very much an 
outcome of the regulatory paradox where
on the one hand, Europeans want [politicians and institutions] to find 
solutions to the major problems confronting our societies. On the other 
hand, people increasingly distrust institutions and politics or are simply 
not interested in them. (European Commission, 2001: 3)
This approach illustrates how safeguarding children also coheres with the 
strategy of enhancing trust and confidence in their use of Web 2.0 tech-
nologies through dialogue and consultation with civil society (European 
Commission, 2010e: 15–16). The term “children” will correspond with 
the definition provided by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(UNCRC), namely, individuals who are below the age of 18 years. In this 
book, the focus will be primarily on the activities of young adolescents, who 
are within the age group of 13 and 18. With regard to the phrase “online 
child safety”, it will have been observed that there is no comprehensive def-
inition. At best, we can view the phrase as a term of art used to describe the 
context in which risks and threats to the safety and well-being of minors 
are encountered (Palfrey et al., 2008). The Online Safety Technical Working 
Group (OSTWG) adopts a similar view of the phrase “online child safety” by 
emphasising the safety implications resulting from children’s consumption 
of interactive technologies and social media (OSTWG, 2010: 4). The Byron 
Report also noted that many of the risks encountered by children should 
not be seen as being unique or exceptional to the online environment 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Introduction 7
(Byron, 2008: 5). For example, even though peer victimisation through the 
use of mobile phones or online interactive technologies may suggest that 
children are exposed to greater risks, this perception may be due to the fact 
that many of the offline risks experienced by children are migrating to the 
online environment as communication technologies become mainstream 
in their daily lives (ibid., 2008: 6). We can, however, agree that online child 
safety policymaking comprises a “diverse set of issues that are directly or 
indirectly related to the physical or psychological well-being of children 
who use digital media” (Gasser et al., 2010: 6). More specifically, these issues 
originate from the difficulties faced in establishing the nature of electronic 
communications, verifying the identity of the participants and controlling 
the flows of communications.
Mapping online child safety issues
It is also important to be mindful of the contingent nature of the issues 
arising from children’s consumption of and exposure to Web 2.0 technolo-
gies and social media, since the risks encountered are also influenced by 
factors like the characteristics of the minors and national and regional varia-
tions. The results of the three-year European Union (EU) Kids Online Project 
(Project) serve as a timely reminder of the need to keep these characteristics in 
mind when developing policy responses to online safety issues (Livingstone 
et al., 2009b). The national reports from the 21 European countries who 
participated in the Project highlighted the effects of variations in cultural 
attitudes towards adolescent sexuality, risks and parenting on the strategies 
relied upon by policymakers (Livingstone et al., 2009c: 25–127, 140, 148). To 
summarise, the term “online child safety” for the purposes of this study can 
be understood as addressing three categories of information risks faced by 
children – content, contact and conduct – as noted in Table 1.1.
The Australian Government’s Consultative Working Group on Cybersafety 
(CWG), which is an initiative of its Cybersafety Plan, also appears to map 
the information risks in a similar vein: cyberbullying; inappropriate use of 
one’s own or others’ personal information; exposure to and creation of in-
appropriate content, gaming addiction and sexual predation (CWG, 2010: 
13–15). It may be useful to keep in mind that there may be considerable 
overlaps between actors and information risk categories, and that some of 
the online activities may be “risk-prone” (e.g. email communications and 
posting of information online) whilst other activities may be the outcome 
of children engaging in “risky behaviour” (e.g. sexting, accessing self-harm 
and suicide websites) (ITU, 2010b: paragraph 78).
This book will adopt the “contact”, “content” and “conduct” risks termin-
ology used by the Project with a view to exploring the governance issues 
raised by children’s interaction with the Internet and other communication 
technologies and the policies, measures and strategies adopted in response. 
As the Project clearly shows, what is regarded as coming within a high-

risk category or as an at-risk individual may not necessarily be regarded as 
such in another country (Livingstone et al., 2009a, b). This is one of many 
problems that may be faced by those who attempt to provide a compre-
hensive account of all the online risks encountered by children. From a 
child protection perspective, a review of the literature from the EU Safer 
Internet Programme (SIP), and consultation processes in Canada, Australia, 
the United Kingdom and the United States, suggests that this classification 
of risks and harms can provide a focal point for governance strategy and de-
velopment of policies and measures to deal with these – peer victimisation, 
exposure to illegal or inappropriate content and sexual solicitation. In this 
study, online child safety governance will be approached from four vantage 
points: the ongoing and emerging legal and investigatory challenges posed 
by Internet-related contact, content and conduct risks; the transborder and 
jurisdictional complexities for regulating Internet sexual abuse and harm; 
the interaction between civil society and industry and the role of education 
and safety awareness campaigns as governance instruments.
A number of commentators have examined the regulatory and child 
protection issues within the discrete domains of peer victimisation, sexual 
grooming and child pornography and increased our understanding of 
online child safety (Shariff, 2008; Hinduja et al., 2009; Akdeniz, 2008; 
Ost, 2009). Akdeniz, in his review of the institutional and regulatory 
responses, seems less than convinced that great inroads have been made 
into disrupting the market for the creation, distribution and consump-
tion of child abuse content (Akdeniz, 2008: 278–81). Peer victimisation,

which is the subject of Shariff’s scholarly work, places the focus on the 
need to confront the problems at source (e.g. schools) and argues that 
the legal system should be engaged in a similar process and attend to the 
unique features of technology-mediated violence (Shariff, 2008: 186). Ost 
views many of the conundrums surrounding the role of the criminal law 
in grappling with online sexual predators as being rooted in conceptions 
of children that perpetuate moral panics and reactive policymaking (Ost, 
2009). One of the purposes in writing this book is to assess the extent to 
which the governance challenges these authors allude to can be explained 
in part by our ongoing preoccupation with the need to maintain order 
and certainty, particularly in the lives of children, by virtue of living in 
a risk society (Beck, 1992a,b). The Internet and communication technolo-
gies appear to erode the dominant roles previously played by parents and 
educators in socialising children (Castells et al., 2007: 161). There is an 
evolving networked sociability, which is creating new outcomes to the 
way children develop, socialise and conduct their relations with family, 
educators, peers and society and consequently
leads both to an individual-centered network, specific to the individual, 
and to peer-group formation, when the network becomes the context of 
behavior for its participants. (ibid., 2007: 144)
Accordingly, the problems of application and compliance in relation to en-
hancing the safety of children must address this “crisis of the patriarchal” 
framework that continues to provide the mainstay of childhood (ibid., 2007: 
143). The emerging MSIG model best reflects the reconfiguration of the or-
ganisational and regulatory milieu, mirrored in continued efforts directed 
in extending the standards and principles enshrined in the UNCRC to all 
multiple stakeholders in the “information chain”. What is unclear is how 
commitment to these values is to be articulated and extended to the various 
contexts and settings that technological affordances make possible. These 
aspects receive very little coverage in the accounts by commentators who 
focus on the strategic role of legal instruments and policy instruments as 
techniques for regulating online behaviour. Paradoxically, the effectiveness 
of the legal rules and norms will depend on developing mechanisms that 
ensure that its standards and principles are fully understood and complied 
with by all participants in the “information chain” – those who make the 
technologies, those who consume technology and those who make consump-
tion of the technologies possible. Indeed, it can be hypothesised that the 
varying competences, knowledge and understanding displayed by children 
in network publics and their management of information credibility may 
be relevant to the issue of targeting appropriate safety messages to different 
age groups and abilities (Flanagin et al., 2010).

10 Online Child Safety
The drivers of online child safety policymaking
We cannot fully appreciate the complexity of online child safety governance 
without an understanding of the diverse factors driving the policy responses 
and the standard setting agenda pursued by a number of stakeholders (OECD, 
2004). The policy issues raised, and the responses to them, will incorporate a 
comparative dimension, using primarily the United Kingdom and countries 
like the United States, Canada, Australia, where appropriate, to highlight the 
emerging role of MSIG strategies in addressing some of the shortcomings 
of national legal systems. As an introduction to the theme of governance – 
which is developed more fully in later chapters – some understanding of the 
drivers of online child safety will help us engage more critically with existing 
international and national policymaking efforts.
The child, the family and the State
The child’s safety and its development continue to be associated with the 
paradigm of the family and the State. These two institutions have long 
assumed the custodial role of children; the evolving patriarchal framework 
has provided a fertile ground from which child safety and well-being issues 
and policies are formulated and implemented. One of the perennial issues 
encountered in this area is the constitutional and practical limits on the 
circumstances when the State can intervene in matters relating to a child’s 
safety and well-being (Archard, 2004). The State, for example, has overall 
control over the way families and organisations like schools, the private 
and the public sector and voluntary organisations discharge their obliga-
tions towards children (Fortin, 2009). Parents continue to be regarded as 
having an important role in the development and nurturing of children 
(Livingstone, 2004a; ACMA, 2007). As the Supreme Court stated in Morse 
v Frederick (2007), both schools and parents have an important role in edu-
cating children and preparing them for their participation in society:
Through the legal doctrine of in loco parentis, courts upheld the right of 
schools to discipline students, to enforce rules, and to maintain order. 
Rooted in the English common law, in loco parentis originally governed 
the legal rights and obligations of tutors and private schools ... “One of 
the most sacred duties of parents, is to train up and qualify their chil-
dren, for becoming useful and virtuous members of society; this duty 
cannot be effectually performed without the ability to command obedi-
ence, to control stubbornness, to quicken diligence, and to reform bad 
habits... The teacher is the substitute of the parent; ... and in the exercise 
of these delegated duties, is invested with his power.” (2007: 2631–2)
Historically, the benchmark for assessing, developing and implement-
ing child protection policies is the child’s best interests. As Baroness Hale

observed in R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment and Others 
(Respondents) Ex Parte Williamson (Appellant) and Others (2005):
Children have the right to be properly cared for and brought up so that 
they can fulfil their potential and play their part in society. Their par-
ents have both the primary responsibility and the primary right to do 
this. The state steps in to regulate the exercise of that responsibility in 
the interests of children and society as a whole. (2005: paragraph 72)
The best interests of the child principle provides a flexible standard that 
has been used as a foundation for policies and measures aimed at balancing 
the protective and welfare elements with those of the child’s right to au-
tonomy, privacy and self-determination (European Commission, 2011b). It 
will be observed that many governments demonstrate their commitment to 
these values as evidenced by States’ voluntary subscription to the UNCRC –
Article 3 of the UNCRC makes clear that States have a responsibility in en-
suring that children’s physical and emotional integrity are safeguarded. The 
online environment does not alter these guiding principles or for that mat-
ter the role of the State and parents in fulfilling their obligations in any 
fundamental respect. Safeguarding children from sexual harm and abuse 
in the online environment is one of the four priority areas identified by 
governments in 2002 at the 27th Special Session of the General Assembly 
on Children (Pinheiro, 2006).
Ongoing tensions
As we seek to fulfil our responsibilities towards children, we need to also 
acknowledge the complex relations between the State and families, the 
imprecise boundaries between childhood and adulthood (Madge et al., 
2007: 13) and the impact of the media on the role of adults in their rela-
tions with children (Prout, 2005: 118–25). The solutions proposed by 
policymakers and regulators to safeguard children cannot be easily disen-
tangled from the way society has traditionally constructed children and 
their role in society and which has placed the Judiciary in an invidious 
position (FCC v Pacifica Foundation (1978); Turner Broadcasting System v 
FCC (1994)). Buckingham highlights the presence of not dissimilar ten-
sions, when television and video games became the staple sources of chil-
dren’s entertainment and lifestyle choices (Buckingham, 2007: 76–7). It is 
not only the content of the broadcasts or media that raise parental anx-
ieties and fears; well before the emergence of the Internet and ubiquitous 
computing, even public spaces populated by children were problematised 
(Jenkins, 2003: 26–30; Valentine, 2004: 27). Our traditional preoccu-
pation with children’s safety and well-being continue to be shaped by 
cultural views of childhood and the resulting tensions have never been 
fully resolved. Furedi, like many scholars who examine the sociology of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

12 Online Child Safety
childhood, characterises risk-averse attitudes as indicative of our ambiva-
lence towards children and the quest for embedding certainty, security 
and order in their lives (Furedi, 2001). Many of the protective and precau-
tionary impulses regarding children’s exposure to illegal or harmful con-
tent, victimisation by peers and sexual solicitation seem familiar. These 
impulses, it should be said, do not discriminate between managing risk 
and uncertainty (Van Asselt et al., 2006; Knight, 1921). Consequently, 
online child safety discourse appears to focus on addressing the likely 
effects of risks materialising rather than those encountered by children 
(Van Asselt et al., 2009). History also reminds us that many of the risk 
identification and assessment approaches that have been touted by poli-
cymakers and authorities have not been infallible (BBC, 2009b, 2010b). 
We know, of course, that despite the well-intentioned efforts of parents, 
educators and lawmakers, children still continue to be one of the groups 
in society who are most vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation (UN, 
2006b). Victimisation by peers still continues to be the bane of many 
children, notwithstanding the many educational and public awareness-
raising campaigns devoted to eradicating this form of deviancy (UN, 
2006a). For more than a decade now, these same safety messages about 
contact, content and conduct risks and spaces where they have been 
located (i.e. playgrounds, school, shopping malls, churches and homes) 
are being extended to the spaces inhabited by children in network publics 
(Valentine, 2004). For many, the relevance of these safety messages is seen 
as being reinforced through media reports of the threat landscape cou-
pled with attitudes towards children’s competence and resilience. Stories 
about online child predators scouring the Internet, teenagers using the 
Internet without parental supervision (BBC, 2009c, 2010a) and risks to 
children from exposure to illegal and inappropriate images on websites 
(BBC, 2009a) continue to be given prominence by the media and schools 
(Grant, 2009). The magnification of children’s online activities and socie-
ty’s fascination with their daily online existence has a negative aspect, in 
that it tends to fuel a culture of constant regulatory and parental scrutiny 
over children’s access to and use of the Internet. Consequently, digital 
technologies accentuate the tensions that have always existed in the way 
the family and the State have been expected to fulfil their obligations 
towards children. Enhancing the safety of children is of strategic policy 
importance since it prepares them to assume their roles in society as indi-
viduals and as citizens (Bethel School District v Fraser (1986)). It is worth 
remembering that the scope of the best interests of the child principle 
may become divisive particularly where the views of young adolescents 
relating to the privacy of their online interactions, choices and decisions 
diverge from, for example, those of the State, and parents (or carers) (JS v 
Bethlehem School District (2002)).

Introduction 13
Structure of the book
Online Child Safety: Law, Technology and Governance directs its focus on the 
governance challenges raised by the problems of ascertaining the integrity, 
authenticity and reliability of information flows and network infrastruc-
tures for our attitudes towards risks facing children and strategies for en-
hancing their safety in the online environment. It also seeks to understand 
the governance challenges facing policymakers and articulates the signifi-
cance of emerging trends in the way compliance with child safety norms 
are defined, communicated and enforced. It is often said that the law’s role 
in this area, particularly through the identification of the rules governing 
acceptable behaviour, has now to be revised in view of the complexity of 
managing a diverse array of online service providers, applications, and users 
(Benkler, 2006). This is true, but the significance of the growing visibility 
of legal standards and the increasing emphasis on the role and continued 
relevance of UNCRC standards and principles by policymakers and gov-
ernance should not be underestimated. More importantly, it is not an ex-
aggeration to say that the evolving governance model is well upon us as we 
witness a range of online child safety policies, strategies and measures being 
pursued at domestic, regional and international levels, which cohere with 
the standards and principles embedded in the UNCRC. An understanding 
of these developments will help provide some clarity and understanding of 
the MSIG model for safeguarding children. It is beyond the scope of this 
book to engage in a detailed examination of the cultural, legal, techno-
logical and political dimensions of child protection. The topics chosen for 
this book have been deliberately confined to three areas – online sexual 
grooming, child pornography and peer victimisation – and primarily situ-
ated within the context of England and Wales, so that the governance chal-
lenges and responses can be identified and evaluated against those taking 
place in other jurisdictions. The narrowness of the focus should also enable 
us to better reflect the online child safety responses to the issues raised by 
children’s interaction with the Internet and communication technologies. 
Online child safety policymaking is both an intriguing and a distinctive 
area of study, since most democratic societies adhere to the idea that its 
regulations are premised on promoting the best interests of children (UN, 
2006b; WSIS, 2005). Although the subject of children’s rights and the soci-
ology of childhood and child sexual abuse has been the subject of extensive 
scholarly deliberation and commentary, there has been very little consid-
eration of the way networks and digital information, as pointed out pre-
viously, create a trust deficit which consequently implicates all non-State 
actors and civil society in the “information chain”.
The basic argument of the book is that if the strategy of creating sustain-
able governance models is to be realised, a number of policy objectives will 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

14 Online Child Safety
have to be pursued in tandem. First, we need to enable children, parents and 
educators to manage, as far as possible, the online risks and safety issues at 
source. Second, whilst it is true that the law is often reactive, in a global and 
decentralised environment, we need to think more creatively about how 
best legal standards and principles can be extended to the various actors in 
the “information chain” so that child safety norms can be embedded into 
the architecture of the Internet and interactive technologies without com-
promising the benefits that the end-to-end principle make possible (Lessig, 
2004). As commentators like Benkler make clear, software applications and 
tools can be used to enforce standards and principles:
The idea is simple to explain, and distinct from a naïve determinism. 
Different technologies make different kinds of human action and inter-
action easier or harder to perform. All other things being equal, things 
that are easier to do are more likely to be done, and things that are harder 
to do are less likely to be done. All other things are never equal ... tech-
nology sets some parameters of individual and social action. It can make 
some actions, relationships, organisations, and institutions easier to 
pursue, and others harder. (Benkler, 2006:17–18)
Finally, there is a clear need to maintain a perspective when approach-
ing the risks associated with children’s interaction with the Internet and 
communication technologies. It needs to be recognised that in many cases 
children navigate the online environment free of harm or abuse (Byron, 
2010). A number of research policy documents and legal scholars have sub-
jected topics like child pornography, peer victimisation and online sexual 
solicitation to doctrinal analysis. This book concentrates less on the doc-
trinal reach of the criminal laws safeguarding children or the normative 
foundations of non-State actors’ participation and regulatory techniques. It 
instead focuses on how the legal rules and judicial interventions together 
with other regulatory measures provide an overarching strategy aimed at 
extending standards and principles that enhance the safety of children in 
the online environment. Too often legal rules and its institutions are viewed 
as inadequate. Some conversely argue that legal rules have to be extended 
in dealing with the commercial and sexual exploitation of children in the 
online environment (Ost, 2009). Others have pointed to the shortcomings 
in the criminal law in curbing the problem of online peer victimisation 
and distribution of pornographic user-generated content amongst minors 
(Shariff, 2008; Akdeniz, 2008). Online child safety provides an invaluable 
case study of how society as a whole can or should respond to the signifi-
cance of the trust deficit for policymaking and regulatory efforts. One con-
clusion reached in this study is that online child safety governance is not a 
technical or legal problem. Rather, it is in essence a problem of developing 
and coordinating MSIG strategies aimed at reducing the trust deficit that

Introduction 15
threatens to undermine confidence in children’s ability to manage risks as 
they gain access to and use the Internet. Online Child Safety: Law, Technology 
and Governance offers one perspective of society’s response to governance 
challenges in this area of child protection policymaking. It is also alert to 
the fact that child protection policies have as one of its aims the better 
management of online risks – the process of re-examining child safety and 
security policies and measures also tell us something about how we as a so-
ciety view, construct and direct our efforts in managing risks in the age of 
modernity. Indeed, the incident outlined at the start of this chapter seems 
to suggest that at the root of the governance challenges facing policymakers 
is our preoccupation with risks and the processes and mechanisms through 
which society and its institutions attempt to manage them. Law is now only 
one policy instrument for defining the standards and principles governing 
individuals behaviour – indeed, it is becoming apparent from the consider-
able work done by working groups and commissions in the United Kingdom, 
the EU, the United States and Australia that MSIG strategies can and should 
be used to secure compliance with legal norms as well as extend it to those 
spheres of human activity that the law has struggled to regulate (e.g. peer 
victimisation and the growing practice of sexting).
This book consists of eight chapters. Chapter 2 examines children’s en-
gagement with the Internet and interactive technologies, and attempts to 
situate the risks encountered by children within the context of the architec-
ture of the Internet. Attempts to understand child protection policymaking 
must at a minimum reflect an awareness of the architecture of the Internet 
and more crucially the significance of our responses to living in the risk 
society (Beck, 1992a; Giddens, 1990). More specifically, the significance of 
the architecture of the Internet for the three risks that concern parents, 
educators and law enforcement will be explained in the light of societal 
preoccupation with them: online sexual solicitation, exposure to illegal or 
inappropriate content and peer victimisation. The premise here is that in 
seeking to understand online child safety governance as a case study of 
the role of MSIG as a legal standard setting and compliance framework, 
we need to address two related matters. First, we need to consider the sig-
nificance of convergence between technology and youth culture. Second, 
we need to recognise the extent to which the design characteristics of the 
Internet can be said to implicate the way we now conceptualise risk and 
which influences the policy choices, strategies and responses (Giddens, 
1991: 123–4; Beck, 1992a: 24). One reason why enforcement and securing 
compliance with legal standards appears to be problematic is that the free 
flow of information and the difficulties of authentication and verifiability 
result in security vulnerabilities operating at different levels and contexts 
(i.e. networks, virtual worlds, mobile phones, social networking sites and 
IM) (Casey, 2004). Understanding the role and limits of the law can also 
be hampered in part by societal attitudes towards risks encountered by 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

16 Online Child Safety
children. The chapter concludes with an analysis of the rhetorical signifi-
cance of concepts like “risk” and “child safety”, and describes ways through 
which discourses on online child safety not only compel responses from 
policymakers and the law but also reflects evolving parenting and societal 
attitudes towards children. Notwithstanding the tensions and rhetoric sur-
rounding child protection, the design constraints imposed by the Internet 
have an added significance, namely, in influencing decisions taken by law 
enforcement in pre-empting risks and investigating and prosecuting offend-
ers engaged in the sexual exploitation of children. Indeed, one of the issues 
raised in this chapter is the influence of legal standard setting techniques 
and UNCRC principles within the MSIG framework.
Chapter 3 looks at some of the legal and investigatory processes that aim 
to protect children from three particular risks: online sexual grooming, 
child pornography and peer victimisation. The principal regulatory tech-
nique, which forms the focus of this chapter, is the use of the criminal law 
to proscribe these forms of conduct. An account will be provided of its key 
rules and principles. A comparison will be made with some of the devel-
opments taking place in Australia, the United States and Canada. Often, 
when issues of managing risk and promoting trust are encountered, the 
real challenges are not so much to do with the substantive rules but the 
application of these to varying contexts and the evidentiary and investi-
gatory challenges faced by law enforcement. More importantly, given that 
the prosecution of individuals of a crime involves, by definition, a criminal 
act as having taken place (or shown to be imminent), the chapter suggests 
that, increasingly, information awareness programmes, greater collabor-
ation with the law enforcement authority and industry engagement play an 
important role in online child safety policymaking. Chapter 4 considers the 
rationales for rules on extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction. Harmonisation 
of jurisdiction rules has been put forward as an attractive solution, but this 
is far from being a straightforward process. The chapter concludes that the 
process of engaging sovereign nations in producing a global commitment 
towards harmonising child safety rules and norms is not as easy as it might 
first be thought, particularly as many of the child protection issues also 
have political, cultural and socio-economic dimensions. Online child safety 
governance is now a global phenomenon. As Web 2.0 technologies become 
an integral part of children’s education, entertainment and interaction 
with peers, it seems right that governance strategies be directed towards 
extending the standards and principles in the UNCRC to all stakeholders at 
the national, regional and international level. The next three chapters can 
be regarded as an attempt to sketch this emerging governance landscape. 
Chapter 5 identifies some of the major developments taking place within 
three spheres of policymaking: the UN, the EU and the Council of Europe. 
Particular importance is given to the SIP, emphasising the role political 
actors can play in extending standard setting rules and norms amongst the

Introduction 17
various stakeholders in the MSIG framework. Chapter 6 introduces a much-
neglected topic in the area of online child safety – the governance aspects of 
the interaction between the State, civil society and the private sector at the 
national, regional and international level. Increasingly, the opening up of 
public deliberative and participatory platforms for interaction between the 
State, private sector and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) has led to 
non-State actors and civil society engaging in productive dialogues culmin-
ating in the identification of clear strategies for promoting compliance with 
child safety norms and practices in the online environment (OECD, 2010b). 
From a policymaking perspective, these interactions illustrate how the con-
verging spaces for governance cohere with the standard setting agenda of 
the law (in its expectation of acceptable standards of behaviour towards 
children) and the UNCRC. The insights gleaned are developed further in 
Chapter 7, which examines the role and value of media literacy as a legit-
imate standard setting measure in online child safety policy. Indeed, media 
literacy has been regarded as an invaluable policy tool in enabling children 
to better manage risks in the online environment. The chapter explores the 
concept of media literacy and argues for the need to calibrate our under-
standing of this measure with the dynamics of network publics and ethical 
challenges these communities raise for all stakeholders. The particular issue 
that this chapter highlights and leaves unresolved is that relating to the way 
children are now to be supported in addressing citizenship and ethical chal-
lenges that emerge when participating in network publics or consuming 
social media. As Ohler correctly observes, our concern with children’s inter-
action with Web 2.0 technologies needs to be set within a broader discourse 
to “balance the connections and the disconnections offered in digital com-
munity and to develop a personal ethical core” (2010: 4). Chapter 8 con-
cludes by summarising the key themes and arguments and assesses their 
significance for our understanding of online child safety and the evolving 
MSIG framework for public policy.

What do news stories of criminal prosecution of individuals involved in on-
line paedophile rings, obligations on social networking services providers to 
address parental anxieties surrounding sexual predatory behaviour on net-
work publics and the Summit on Bullying hosted by the White House have in 
common? A number of possible answers can be given to this question. One an-
swer may be that it reflects our consciousness about the disorientating features 
of technology (Ohler, 2010: 77–90). The misuse of technologies taps into our
primal forces that have been with us for thousands of years. These “forces 
of the cave,” ... range from fearing predators, seeking food and shelter, 
and nurturing our children to protecting our mate and trusting fellow 
tribe members. (Dertouzos, 2001: 211)
Another answer might be that these are all responses to the way network 
infrastructures and information flows distribute risks. These incidents also 
illustrate how politicians, the mass media, law, industry and society con-
struct and respond to these risks (Garland, 2003). The events do not of course 
tell us about growing societal preoccupation with enhancing the safety of 
children in the online environment or even what it is about Web 2.0 tech-
nologies and children’s interaction with them that bothers us. Neither do 
they hint at the burdens increasingly shouldered by the State, child wel-
fare organisations, law enforcement, parents and children in managing the 
security risks accompanying their risk-prone activities (e.g. emails, use of 
search engines and participation in network publics). The need to be seen 
to respond to risks in itself becomes a preoccupation of many parents and 
the communities in which they live. The US President’s call for a commu-
nity response in dealing with one pernicious threat faced by children is 
emblematic of a perennial dilemma for those living in a risk society. “Risks”, 
as Ulrich Beck defines it, is a “systematic way of dealing with hazards and

insecurities induced and introduced by modernization itself” (1992a: 21). 
This chapter has two objectives. First, it seeks to explain and integrate the 
salient aspects in Beck’s ideas about the risk society into online child safety 
discourse. In undertaking the task, an attempt will be made to identify 
how ideas of risk manifest themselves in the online child safety govern-
ance sphere of policymaking, rule development and discourse. Second, this 
chapter lays the foundation for the subsequent discussions on the standard 
setting role of law and the extension of its rules, values and norms to all 
stakeholders with the aim of creating a culture of safe and responsible use 
of Web 2.0 technologies and social media.
Living in the “risk society”
An overview
Beck identifies risk as a focal point in his study of the impact of the inter-
action between the State, industry and science on society in late modernity. 
In Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity, he offers us a grand theory, depict-
ing the impact of techno-economic developments on society. He postu-
lates that the risk society is a “catastrophic society” where “averting and 
managing” risks become norms rather than exceptions (Beck, 1992a: 24). 
In focusing on the concept of risk, Beck, unlike Marx or Weber, is not par-
ticularly interested in addressing the class and economic implications of the 
capitalist system of production (Lupton, 1999: 1–7). For him, the capitalist 
modes of wealth creation and distribution not only produce increased ben-
efits and new opportunities for prosperity and development but they also 
generate negative or destructive outcomes – the logic of wealth creation, 
he suggests, sets in operation processes by which risks are not only created 
but they are also distributed to individuals across society. The ideological, 
technological, economic and political imperatives, which sustain the logic 
of wealth creation, produce risks that leave no part of society untouched. 
Beck concludes that advances in technology and science now pose society 
with a governance dilemma, since we can no longer be concerned
exclusively with making nature useful, or with releasing mankind from 
traditional constraints, but also and essentially with problems resulting 
from techno-economic development itself. (Beck, 1992a: 19)
How society addresses this dilemma is in essence the “risk society” thesis 
and very much a part of the challenges confronted by the MSIG framework 
used to address online child safety issues. Indeed, it is a dilemma that con-
fronts policymakers grappling with the services, products and activities that 
result from the convergence of networks, communications and information 
(OECD, 2004). The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), in its 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

20 Online Child Safety
Geneva Declaration of Principles, expressly regards the protection and pres-
ervation of children’s right as an important priority in the development 
of information and communication technology (ICT) applications and op-
eration of services (WSIS, 2003). Paragraph 90 of the Tunis Agenda for the 
Information Society states that the pursuit of economic growth through ICT 
should also incorporate “regulatory, self-regulatory, and other effective pol-
icies and frameworks to protect children and young people from abuse and 
exploitation through ICTs into national plans of action and e-strategies” 
(WSIS, 2005). The Adolescent Declaration to End Sexual Exploitation empha-
sises that without appropriate regulatory responses, the threats posed to 
children are likely to be endemic
the continuing high level of sexual exploitation of children and adoles-
cents in States in all regions, and at the increase in certain forms of sexual 
exploitation of children and adolescents, in particular through abuse of 
the Internet and new and developing technologies, and as a result of the 
increased mobility in travel and tourism. (WC III, 2008: paragraph 2)
A failure to respond to risks in a balanced and principled way has undoubted 
implications for the safety and well-being of individuals and trust generally. 
As the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
noted in its policy document, trust is
one of the central channels through which social identities are con-
structed in late modernity. Trust is fragile. Typically it is created rather 
slowly, but it can be destroyed in an instant by a single mishap or mistake. 
Once trust is lost, it can take a long time to rebuild. In some instances, 
lost trust may never be regained. (OECD, 2003)
Risks, reflexive modernisation and individualisation
The globalisation of risk with the resulting examination of the governance 
responses of the State and its institutions for wealth creation is a familiar 
trope in the discourse on modernity (Lupton, 1999; Beck, 1992a; Giddens, 
1990). We will deal with the globalisation of risk in Chapter 6. For present 
purposes, we need to highlight two other insights from Beck’s “risk society” 
thesis: the techno-economic advances which lead to the emergence of risks 
and individual and institutional preoccupation with redressing the uncer-
tainty created by its pervasiveness in society (Jarvis, 2007; Giddens, 1991). 
The emphasis on techno-economic advances is central to Beck’s vision of 
the “risk society” since it allows him to distinguish natural hazards from 
those categories of risks he regards as man-made (Beck, 1992a: 98). Man-
made risks, he suggests, are generated by the logic of wealth creation, and 
these include pollution, unemployment, accidents in the work environ-
ment and breakdown in family and class structures. Sexual exploitation

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 21
and abuse of children is not a natural hazard but society’s preoccupation 
with child safety issues can be treated as part of Beck’s risk paradigm since 
the regulatory State continues to be one of the proponents in developing 
responsive regulatory systems (Hood et al., 2001: 4). As Hood, Rothstein 
and Baldwin remark on the decision by the State to release paedophiles ex-
offenders released from custody:
What is new about this risk is the degree of recognition and public dis-
cussion it has attracted over recent decades ... [the] risks presented by 
released paedophile offenders are of high political and media salience 
across much of the developed world. Within the UK, that salience con-
trasts markedly with a lower, albeit growing, level of public attention 
and concern about child sexual abuse within the home by close family 
members. (Ibid., 2001: 41)
Faced with the generative nature of risks created by the logic of wealth 
creation, governments, institutions and individuals are faced with the pro-
spect of being overcome by these negative consequences (ITU, 2009d). Beck 
argues that society in late modernity is unable to desist from establishing 
control and reducing the uncertainty that actual (or potential) risks cre-
ate. However, it may be more accurate to say that government intervention 
here has to do with fostering public trust and confidence in demonstrating 
its ability to manage risks. We see Beck’s ideas resonate, for example, in 
the security developments following the atrocities of the terrorists attacks 
in the United States and London, concerns about nanotechnologies, mad 
cow disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the anxieties re-
volving around the increasing sexualisation of young people and release 
of ex-sex offenders into the community (Wilkinson, 2001; Handmer et al., 
2007; Papadopoulos, 2010; Hood et al., 2001: 41–2). Society’s desire and 
need for certainty and control is manifest in the way governments now 
assume the role as managers of risk through the development of rules and 
mechanisms for identifying, monitoring and responding to a wide range 
of risks (Lofstedt, 2005). Individuals and institutions in society engage in 
what Beck terms as reflexive modernisation; society preoccupies itself with 
managing risks and becomes constantly dependent on mechanisms which 
lead to risks being audited, expert advice being sought when formulating 
policies and measures and regulations being designed to promote com-
pliance with legal standards and obligations (ITU, 2010b; OECD, 2003). 
There are a number of examples even in the sphere of safeguarding chil-
dren from commercial sexual exploitation that bring to mind the politi-
cisation of risk and the process of reflexive modernisation taking place. For 
example, at the World Congress III against Sexual Exploitation of Children 
and Adolescents (WC III), it was noted that over 129 governments had 
adopted and ratified the Optional Protocol and an increasing number of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

22 Online Child Safety
countries were ratifying the Child Prostitution and Child Pornography 
and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention 182, the 
CPC Convention and Cybercrime Convention (WC III, 2008: paragraph 
1). Additionally, a number of countries have prioritised online child safety 
issues in their national strategies, agendas and plans (ibid., 2008: paragraph 
3). We can infer from the politicisation of risk the increasing role played 
by politicians and civil society in driving forward child safety agendas and 
risk-based modes of reasoning and policymaking activity (Beck, 1992a: 
155–63). For Beck, these are the prime examples of risk becoming increas-
ingly secularised and politicised. Risks (and their management) also be-
come very much an important part of public consciousness, particularly 
as the media provides an increasingly influential avenue through which 
risks are defined and communicated to a wide audience. Unsurprisingly, 
in the area of online child safety, the media attention tends to be focused 
on the extreme edges of technological misuse or “worse-case scenarios” 
(e.g. online paedophile rings, suicide, self-harm, exposure to pornography 
and peer victimisation). Such is the anxiety that is generated that “we 
are left to wonder what else happens in the largely invisible world of the 
infosphere” (Ohler, 2010: 141). Managing risk in modernity becomes a re-
flexive process where the development of prudential and precautionary 
measures is seen as an ongoing process where the agency of political insti-
tutions becomes prominent in governance since
questions of the development and employment of technologies (in the 
realms of nature, society and the personality) are being eclipsed by ques-
tions of the political and economic “management” of the risks of ac-
tually or potentially utilized technologies – discovering, administering, 
acknowledging, avoiding or concealing such hazards with respect to spe-
cially defined horizons of relevance. The promise of security grows with 
the risks and destruction and must be reaffirmed over and over again to 
an alert and critical public through cosmetic or real interventions in the 
techno-economic development. (Beck, 1992a: 19–20)
These last references to the “promise of security”, the need for affirmation, 
and a public highly attuned to risks and the “cosmetic” nature of some of 
the interventions have a lasting impact on the sense in which “risk-based” 
regulation is understood: the distinction between actual and perceived risks 
becomes blurred and consequently contributes to society’s continued anx-
iety about managing risks. Increasingly, the governance question is framed 
not in terms of whether online risks facing children should be regulated but 
what risk-based systems facilitate deliberative and participatory processes 
that enable the child safety policies and standards to be attained without 
compromising public trust (Graham, 2010: 244–5). The latter is particu-
larly relevant as information networks and Web 2.0 technologies are seen 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 23
as producing risks and benefits that affect certain groups of individuals in 
society disproportionately. One reason for the “irrationality” of individual’s 
responses to risks in society, sometimes characterised as “moral panics”, is 
that techno-economic developments also transform structures and systems 
that have previously been regarded as frameworks for security and stability 
(i.e. welfare state, agrarian society, feudal structures). The transition from 
“industrial” to the “risk society” and the resulting loss in public trust and 
confidence in the State and its institutions is seen as leading to individuals 
assuming a greater role in managing their own safety and well-being (Beck, 
1992a: 101; 1992b: 127–37). As Beck points out:
Risk Society begins where tradition ends, when, in all spheres of life, we 
can no longer take traditional certainties for granted. The less we can rely 
on traditional securities, the more risks we have to negotiate. The more 
risks, the more decisions and choices we have to make. (Beck, 1998: 10)
The individualisation of risk subjects everyone in society to turbulence 
and social conflicts in varying degrees (Beck, 1992a: 134–5). The central 
point here is not that late modernity creates more risks, rather the changes 
wrought by technological advances create conditions, which lead to an indi-
vidual’s heightened awareness of risks and the quest for effective responses 
(Giddens, 1991: 123–4).
The emerging MSIG strategy
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in its 2009 Report 
highlighted the rapid penetration of ICTs across societies (ITU, 2009a). 
Individuals and organisations now have access to not only a range of in-
formation but also a wealth of computing applications. These develop-
ments have not escaped the attention of policymakers and governments. 
For example, under the Digital Agenda for Europe, electronic communica-
tions are seen as a necessary medium for creating a sustainable and inclu-
sive economy (European Commission, 2010a). It is expected that broadband 
technology and online services will be made available to all Europeans by 
2013 (European Commission, 2010b). Many homes now have access to 
online networks and the availability of multimedia services is now trans-
forming the way information is accessed (ACMA, 2009a). Under Canada’s 
Economic Action Plan, $225 million was provided to Industry Canada to 
increase broadband connectivity to areas not currently served (Government 
of Canada, 2011). The US National Broadband Plan views the networked 
economy as critical to improving domestic economic and social conditions 
and global competitiveness (FCC, 2011). The networked economy is seen as 
central to providing businesses, organisations and individuals with consid-
erable opportunities, but these flows of networked information also bring 
with it vulnerabilities and threats that undermine trust and confidence

24 Online Child Safety
(Garland, 2003; Giddens, 1991). These threats and risks are not immedi-
ately identified since they exist in multiple communication platforms and 
in environments of collapsing national and international boundaries. The 
transition to a risk society also has important consequences for the way risks 
generated have now to be managed. For example, governments now have to 
assess, manage and regulate risks in society (Beck, 2002). Individuals in so-
ciety, for example, are also vested with the responsibility for managing their 
affairs as traditional insurance and social infrastructures for maintaining 
cohesion are gradually loosened. The distinctive features of online safety 
risks are that the “producers”, “managers” and “protesters” of risks are in 
effect the State, the ICT industry and, indirectly, educators and parents who 
make the products and services available to children (Van Asselt et al., 2009: 
360). This characterisation is important since many of the stakeholders 
assume an important role in the governance process and make decisions on 
the risk management strategies to be adopted. At the high level of regulatory 
theory a number of developments have taken place, which have undoubted 
implications for the way policymakers think about online child safety gov-
ernance issues. In Canada, a policy document was produced to look at the 
effects of risk-based regulation (Government of Canada, 2004). Others have 
defined the risk-based governance in terms of the barriers to developing in-
novative regulatory responses. Policymakers in the European Commission 
highlighted the role of the precautionary principle as a touchstone for man-
aging risks in conditions of uncertainty (European Commission, 2000). 
With children’s increased exposure to Web 2.0 technologies, policymak-
ers have also framed responsive risk governance in terms of worst-case sce-
narios – peer victimisation, children meeting sexual predators, exposure 
to illegal and age-inappropriate content and children accessing self-harm 
and suicide websites. These risks are understandably difficult to quantify 
and, consequently, provide the justification for pursuing reflexive regula-
tory strategies and measures. The reflexive responses underscore the height-
ened awareness of the scale and complexity of managing risks and anxiety 
and the need to ensure that risk management becomes an ongoing policy-
making priority. There is concern that such anxieties, if left unchecked, may 
lead to overregulation or result in policymakers targeting individuals or 
organisations to assume responsibility for managing these risks (Sunstein, 
2007). From a governance perspective, prioritising the regulatory agenda 
becomes a legitimate objective. For example, in response to the growing 
concerns about the impact of online security threats on user trust and con-
fidence, the Australian government has undertaken a series of studies with 
the aim of identifying priority areas for risk management (ACMA, 2009c,d). 
Governments now regard encouraging parents and educators to supervise 
closely the activities of children aged 5–7 as a legitimate child safety ob-
jective (ITU, 2009b,c). Broadcasters, the Internet industry, Internet service 
providers (ISPs) and online service providers are encouraged to implement 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 25
design, technological and educational solutions (ITU, 2009d). Policymakers 
are provided with statistical indicators of risk-prone activities and risk-prone 
behaviours, which identify areas for regulatory activity and policymaking 
(ITU, 2009e). Consequently, we end up subscribing to the
mean world syndrome [which] says that, because of the media’s attrac-
tion to reporting the worst in human nature, people think the world is 
much more violent and dangerous than it actually is. It is certainly more 
dangerous than how most of us experience it. (Ohler, 2010: 143)
It follows from the preceding discussion that the resulting institutionalisa-
tion of risk now brings into the regulatory landscape non-State actors. ISPs, 
online service providers, mobile phone operators and NGOs are regarded as 
having important obligations and roles in online child safety governance 
(Klinke, 2009: 403–4). The Byron Report neatly encapsulates the signifi-
cance of the individualisation of risks facing children by its three govern-
ance objectives:
Reduce Availability – Reduce the availability of harmful and inappro-
priate content, the prevalence of harmful and inappropriate contact and 
the conduciveness of platforms to harmful and inappropriate conduct.
Restrict Access – Equip children and their parents to effectively man-
age access to harmful and inappropriate content, avoid incidences of 
harmful and inappropriate contact and reduce harmful and inappro-
priate conduct.
Increase Resilience – Equip children to deal with exposure to harmful and 
inappropriate content and contact, and equip parents to help their chil-
dren deal with these things and parent effectively around incidences of 
harmful and inappropriate conduct by their children. (Byron, 2008: 62)
Accordingly, as will be discussed in subsequent chapters, the responsibility 
for assessing and communicating risks will be directed at sector-specific 
industries (e.g. social networking sites, computer manufacturers, mobile 
phone providers, and ISPs). The gradual widening of the channels for risk 
management and allocation brings into the multi-stakeholder governance 
model a range of regulatory techniques for managing risks: private and 
public law, insurance and codes of practice. Even though Beck’s thesis 
is not without its critics, his contribution, however, is important for our 
understanding of how and why risk-based regulation has become a de-
fining characteristic in online child safety governance. We will examine 
some of the dynamics of risk-based governance systems in Chapter 7. The 
first matter to be considered is the extent to which the end-to-end design 
principle creates the techno-economic and social conditions that lead to

policymakers defining the roles and obligations of the stakeholders within 
the MSIG framework.
Children, Web 2.0 technologies and social media
Even though this is not a book about the protocols and architecture of the 
Internet, some appreciation of its function and design principles is neces-
sary if we are to begin to understand the relationship between the logic 
of information flows, the new channels for risk distribution and anxieties 
about children’s safety and well-being and the attainment of the three gov-
ernance objectives. To this end, the discussion will address three aspects in 
turn: the design and architecture of communication technologies, conver-
gence between youth culture and technology and the policy implications 
arising from the interaction between the technical infrastructure and de-
sign, online security threats and risks and governance challenges.
Design principles and the architecture of the Internet
The Internet is first and foremost a complex network of computers. The ori-
ginal designers of the Internet were not concerned with providing virtual 
worlds, social networking sites, web streaming or email services (Castells, 
1997). Their challenge was to develop protocols that allowed networks to 
connect with each other (Berners-Lee et al., 2000). As Werbach makes clear:
Unlike traditional communications networks, the Internet does not pro-
vide a particular kind of service. Its designers set out not to deliver con-
tent, but to interconnect networks (hence the name Inter-net). Neither 
services offered nor physical infrastructure nor geographic location de-
termine whether something is part of the Internet. (2002: 47)
This extract highlights two particular aspects with regard to the interaction 
between the architecture of the Internet and its design principles. First, the 
design principles and architecture can be likened to providing engineers 
and programmers with tools and a medium through which information can 
be disseminated across networks and represented as text, images and sound. 
The fundamental design principles shaping much of the work undertaken 
by these individuals in creating a technical communications infrastructure 
were those of interoperability, decentralisation and non-discrimination – 
the information space was to be an environment that was capable of being 
accessed by anyone, from any country and from any computer or commu-
nication device (Berners-Lee, 2000: 37; Table 2.1). As we will discover later, 
the technological affordances and the channels through which informa-
tion flows can now be accessed owe much to the priority given to design 
rather than security principles (Dertouzos, 2001: 209). Security principles, 
like those relating to confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and availability, 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 27
are concerned with managing the flow of information so that the right in-
formation is made available to the right persons, at the right time and at the 
right place (OECD, 2002a).
The design principles are reflected in the “protocols” now used by online 
intermediaries and mobile phone companies to provide users with oppor-
tunities to exchange information, and view or experience social media on 
a variety of platforms (Lane, 2008). “Protocols” are rules, which enable 
networks to connect with each other. The Internet is in essence based 
on a number of protocols known as the Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Accordingly, the adoption of protocols ena-
bles files to be transferred, emails to be sent and information in all forms 
to be stored and disseminated. The TCP/IP protocols can be categorised 
into four functional groups or layers, which enable users to exchange 
content over networks (Table 2.2). These relate to Content, Application, 
Transport, Internet protocol, Link and Physical properties like cables and 
wires (Solum et al., 2004).
Second, many of the innovations and developments that we see today 
(i.e. Smartphone, portable media devices and multimedia communication 
platforms) can be traced back to the design principles and the architecture 
of the Internet (OECD, 2008a). The development of software applications 
and ready availability of broadband connectivity has contributed greatly to 
the emergence of a vibrant communication ecosystem (ITU, 2009a; OECD, 
2010a). P2P file-sharing technologies, voice over Internet protocols (VOIP), 
wireless connectivity, mobile applications, cloud computing and next gen-
eration mobile phones enhance economic and social activities by enabling 
individuals and organisations to access, create, store and distribute infor-
mation. Social networking sites like Facebook, Bebo and MySpace enable

information to be freely accessed, exchanged and created. It is hard not to 
notice that at the core of the Internet and the evolution of Web 2.0 tech-
nologies is the belief that innovation, creativity and freedom of expression 
thrive best in an environment of free markets, entrepreneurial endeavour 
and minimal State intervention (Benkler, 2006). As Zittrain recalls:
From its start, the Internet was oriented differently from the proprietary 
networks and their ethos of bundling and control. Its goals were in some 
ways more modest. The point of building the network was not to offer a 
particular set of information or services like news or weather to custom-
ers, for which the network was necessary but incidental. Rather, it was to 
connect anyone on the network to anyone else. It was up to the people 
connected to figure out why they wanted to be in touch in the first place; 
the network would simply carry data between the two points. (2008: 27)

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 29
It is not an exaggeration to say that without the four functional layers and 
its underpinning design principles, we would not have seen the acceleration 
of a networked society comprising online intermediaries, network operators 
and commercial product manufacturers (OECD, 2010a). Neither, it should 
be said, would the absence of the functional layers have created the neces-
sary incentive structures for the ICT industry, online services providers and 
mobile operators to make available products and services which mirrored 
consumers’ need for immediacy, intimacy, community and information 
(Lane, 2008: 5–7).
The advances in communication technologies and the ubiquity of com-
puting represent an important paradigm shift in the way the logic of sustain-
ing information flows frames economic, technological and cultural activity 
(Castells et al., 2007). Mobile phones, for example, now come packaged with 
software applications, widgets, and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) 
that have standard web technology components to enable users to engage 
with the others in online environment (Lane, 2008). One study forecasts 
not only the growth of mobile social networks but it is also expected that 
this trend will culminate in transforming the way individuals in society 
will interact and communicate (ibid., 2008: 15). The OECD Working Party 
on Telecommunication and Information Services Policy observed that “[c]
onvergence in electronic communications is bringing together industries in 
the communications area which were previously viewed as separate in both 
a commercial and technological sense, and which have quite distinct regu-
latory traditions and arrangements” (OECD, 2004: 5).
Convergence in broadcasting, telecommunication and entertainment 
impacts a wide range of economic and social activities. Consequently, gov-
ernments and regulators continue to be alert to the public interest issues 
raised by the ubiquitous computing environment (Schewick, 2010: 20–2, 
37–8). Many child safety issues are increasingly linked to the governance 
implications arising from the ICT industry and online services providers 
leveraging the capabilities of networks and telecommunications. Children’s 
consumption of new technologies now provides a catalyst for a whole 
range of technical issues confronting online intermediaries, the Internet 
Engineering Task Force and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
(WGIG, 2005). From a child protection perspective, the interaction between 
children’s consumption habits and the individualisation of risks has also led 
to a re-examination of how risks can be better managed by the ICT industry 
and related online service providers (WSIS, 2003). With the convergence 
of the broadcasting and telecommunication sectors, and the emergence of 
new online services providers, risk-based regulation efforts continue to be 
directed at promoting sector-specific assessments, standard setting initia-
tives and improving compliance (ITU, 2009d; WSIS, 2005). This process of 
reflexive modernisation is depicted in the technical literature as the end-
to-end arguments. In a highly influential paper written in the early 1980s, 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

30 Online Child Safety
the question of how applications should be incorporated into the technical 
infrastructure of the Internet was addressed, with the recommendation that 
the application-level functions be built into the high levels, rather than the 
lower levels of the system on the basis that
the function in question can completely and correctly be implemented 
only with the knowledge and help of the application standing at the end-
points of the communications system. Therefore, providing that ques-
tioned function as a feature of the communications systems itself is not 
possible. (Saltzer et al., 1984: 278)
The allocation of specific applications and services away from the core of the 
system were seen as reducing the demands on the lower-level system and 
ensuring efficiency, reliability and flexibility gains (Blumenthal et al., 2001: 
71). Despite the seeming elegance and simplicity of the end-to-end argument, 
the premise is clear: the logic of information flows is seen as requiring, if 
not compelling, the end points (i.e. those who make the technology to be 
consumed, those who make consumption of online services and technology 
possible and those who consume the technology and services) to assume ul-
timate responsibility for managing and allocating responsibility for risks. For 
example, under the end-to-end principle, the architecture of the Internet in 
effect vests the responsibility for managing risks, to varying degrees, with the 
various participants in the information chain. Recall that the applications 
are situated at the core of the Internet’s technical infrastructure, and, conse-
quently, the functional layers do not discriminate as to the type of content 
being sent and neither do the information flows make the characteristics of 
the senders and recipients immediately discernible to end users. The end-to-
end principle, as originally formulated, can also be seen as reflecting an ideo-
logical preference for limited State intervention, with market rules and norms 
being seen as appropriate instruments for regulating the telecommunications 
and broadcasting industry. The debates that we now witness in online child 
safety governance regarding the role of online intermediaries involves, in 
essence, an argument about how the negative consequences of information 
flows are to be managed by the existing framework for regulating telecom-
munication services across network infrastructures and content that can be 
accessed from these platforms. For example, mobile phones and Smartphones 
now incorporate a bundle of software applications into their hardware. The 
aim of these measures is to provide consumers with a wide range of services 
and access opportunities. With these benefits, and mindful of the end-to-
end principle, mobile and online content service providers are now vested 
with the responsibility of ensuring that the information accessed through 
their products and services correspond with national content standards and 
policies (ITU, 2009d). The end-to-end principle also confronts policymakers 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 31
with difficult choices regarding the outcomes of managing the uncertain 
nature of convergence, the speed and scale of convergence and the individu-
alisation of risks (OECD, 2004:14). Risks in short are now socialised and en-
gender a continued process of reflexive modernisation as part of the MSIG 
strategies in the area of regulatory policy, national coordination and legisla-
tive activity (ITU, 2009e).
The digital natives’ landscape
The exponential growth of the Internet is transforming the way individu-
als, and in particular children, now interact with communication tech-
nologies and social media (Negroponte, 1995: 200–2). Commentators 
like Livingstone and Bovill have remarked on the significance of the grow-
ing convergence between youth culture and technology (Livingstone, 
2003b; Bovill et al., 2001). These technologies have become an integral part 
of children’s daily lives and activities (ACMA, 2009b; Ipsos Mori, 2009). 
The European Commission’s Safer Internet Plus Programme has funded projects 
examining the online experiences of children from 21 Member States 
(European Commission, 2011b: 9). The EU Barometer Surveys in 2005 and 
2008 showed that in 2005, 70 per cent of 6- to 17-year-olds in the countries 
were using the Internet (Eurobarometer, 2005, 2008). By 2008, this number 
had increased to 75 per cent, with the finding that 60 per cent of children 
aged between 6 and 10 years were online. Another view of convergence is 
that communication technologies now enable individuals to interact with 
each other without the traditional constraints of time, distance and space. 
Ubiquitous and mobile computing now free individuals from the traditional 
physical constraints associated with interaction and consumption of social 
media (Castells et al., 2007: 127–46). As Ito remarks, technological affordances 
allow children to take full advantage of participating in network publics and 
negotiate their identities (Ito et al., 2008). Children aged 5 to 12 years not only 
spend an increasing amount of their leisure activity online but they also use a 
range of media platforms to access information, play games and interact with 
their peers (Staksrud et al., 2010). The Office of Communications (OfCom) 
noted that during the past five years there has been a gradual transform-
ation in the way young children interact with social media and technology 
(OfCom, 2009). Growing interoperability at the application or device levels 
and the consolidation of telecommunications, media and entertainment have 
contributed to this shift in children’s engagement with technology and their 
environment. Similar trends have been noted in developed economies out-
side the EU, including America, Canada and Australia. In the Digital Futures 
Report 2010, consumption of the Internet and communication technologies 
by Americans was shown to increase as the age decreased (Centre for Digital 
Futures, 2010). In an extensive study examining the online behaviours of 
children (grades 4 to 11) in Canada, between 2003 and 2005, communication

technologies were found to be well and firmly embedded in children’s daily 
lives:
Young people, on the other hand, do not see the Net as a distinct entity or 
environment. It is simply one more space in which they live their lives – 
connecting with friends, pursuing interests, figuring out what it means 
to be a teenager and a grown up. (Media-Awareness, 2005)
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) identified similar trends in its 
study Children’s Participation in Cultural and Leisure Activities (ABS, 2009). It 
was found that Internet use and frequency of use also increased with age. 
For example, during April 2008–09, 96 per cent of young adolescents (aged 
12–14) accessed the Internet, in contrast to only 60 per cent of five- to eight-
year-olds; Internet access was now available to children at home, school and 
elsewhere (79 per cent), and the activities for which the Internet were used 
included education (85 per cent), playing online games (69 per cent) and 
downloading music (47 per cent).
Design, cultural convergence and the genres of participation
What is “cultural convergence”?
Terms like the “digital generation”, “mobile youth” and “digital natives” form 
very much a part of popular discourse on children and their interaction with 
new technologies (Rideout et al., 2007). In essence, these terms attempt to 
capture a radical transformation in children’s interaction with their environ-
ments in contemporary society (Prout, 2005; James et al., 1998). At a basic 
level, “convergence” in the age of mobile computing can be viewed as the 
coming together of information, media and communication. Convergence 
can also be viewed more expansively (Jenkins, 2006). As many commenta-
tors have pointed out, Web 2.0 technologies are imbued with social and cul-
tural meanings (Benkler, 2006). According to Jenkins, convergence
represents a paradigm shift – a move from medium-specific content 
toward content that flows across multiple media channels, toward the 
increased interdependence of communications systems, toward multiple 
ways of accessing media content, and toward ever more complex rela-
tions between top-down corporate media and bottom-up participatory 
culture. (2006: 243)
Jenkins’ description frames the discourse on network publics and techno-
logical affordances well. There is of course a “qualitative change in users’ 
experience of everyday life ... [which results in a] ... technosocial sensibility” 
(Castells et al., 2007: 141). Cultural convergence can also be represented in 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 33
another way. Benkler observes that participatory cultures deviate from the 
norm of hierarchical and centralised models for coordinating interactions 
and a key aspect of this improvement
has been the technical–organizational shift from an information envir-
onment dominated by commercial mass media on a one-to-many model, 
which does not foster group interaction among viewers, to an informa-
tion environment that both technically and as a matter of social practice 
enables user-centric, group-based active cooperation platforms of the kind 
that typify the networked information economy. (Benkler, 2006: 357)
Childhood in 2012 is lived in spaces created by information networks. 
Children’s use of mobile phones, the meanings attributed to the building of 
extensive “friend” lists and the use of social network profiles as tools for self-
presentation and admission into online communities are manifestations of 
what life in a networked society means for individuals, particularly children 
(ibid., 356–8). The role of Web 2.0 technologies in enhancing children’s 
autonomy has also marked an important shift in what Senft describes as 
a growing culture of gossip, self-branding and sexual display as leitmotifs 
of children’s fascination with new technologies, social media and celebrity 
culture (Senft, 2008). Cultural convergence also shapes the way children 
engage and participate in these environments – not as passive actors but as 
autonomous individuals with their own identities, preferences and values 
(Herring, 2008: 71–92). There is perhaps a sense of a new sociability where 
children now exercise their newfound autonomy through “consumerism, 
faddish trends, cultural identity, peer-group formations, relationship with 
existing social institutions” (Castells et al., 2007: 142) Creative uses of tech-
nologies have been used to promote civic participation and critical media 
literacy skills (Goldman et al., 2008: 185–206). Mobile phones now embed 
these preferences and tastes so as to enable children to enjoy and experience 
a range of social and cultural opportunities. A study, focusing on the lives 
of children aged between 8 and 18, found that ownership of mobile phones 
and Smartphones amongst this group of consumers is on the rise (Rideout 
et al., 2010). For many children, mobile phones open up opportunities for 
engaging with their communities, participating in support networks, and 
entertainment (Ling, 2008: 43, 58, 77). Teenagers use mobile phones for tex-
ting, taking pictures and accessing online content. “Cultural convergence”, 
according to Stald, has elevated the wisdom of peer participatory cultures 
and norms:
Because of the always there, always on status of the mobile and the pace 
of exchange of information, and because the mobile is the key personal 
communication device for so many young people, it becomes important 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

34 Online Child Safety
in establishing social norms and rules and in testing one’s own position 
in relation to the peer group. (Stald, 2008: 143–64)
Her findings correspond very much with the ongoing work by Ling on 
mobile phone use. In his research, Ling rejects any suggestion that mobile 
phone use is “exceptional” or novel; rather, he sees the mobile phone as a 
tool through which ritual social interactions and social bonding take place 
(Ling, 2008). Communication technologies are instruments for expression, 
cultural interaction and identity experimentation (Stern, 2007). In her 
study involving the use of communication technologies by adolescent girls, 
Stern noted that IM tools were not simply tools for transmitting informa-
tion or content but that they were also utilised to create communities and 
establish norms of behaviour. There is also a sense, in reviewing the studies 
from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Pew Internet & American Life, 
that young children view interactive technologies as private communica-
tion spheres where intrusions by parents and other persons are kept to a 
minimum (Rideout et al., 2010; Lenhart et al., 2008). Social networking, re-
gardless of whether it takes place on a mobile phone or personal computer, 
is the digital equivalent where children
hang out, jockey for social status, work through how to present them-
selves, and take risks that will help them to assess the boundaries of the 
social world. They do so because they seek access to adult society. Their 
participation is deeply rooted in their desire to engage publicly. (boyd, 
2007: 137)
Finally, convergence allows individuals to engage with information, con-
tent and users anytime and anywhere – the de-centralisation of networks of 
communication infrastructure also creates new spaces for communication 
and interaction (and one which as a consequence erodes the dominant roles 
of parents and educators and leads to the blurring of the boundaries be-
tween childhood and adulthood).
Convergence, participatory cultures and genres of participation
Convergence can also be said to represent a cultural phenomenon comprising 
not only of participation but also a whole range of activities, which include 
interaction, formation of relationships, identity expression, community sup-
port, and engagement in creative activities (Livingstone, 2005a; Table 2.3).
Discussion forums, IM and social networking sites now provide children 
with opportunities to form communities and engage with their peers and 
persons they meet online (Livingstone, 2008b). Many social networking 
sites have taken advantage of the design and architectural principles to cre-
ate innovative features on their platforms, by incorporating video, chat and 
IM facilities. Identity expression, experimentation and peer acceptance are 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 35
very much in evidence in the way children use these sites to interact with 
each other. Disclosure of information is regarded as part of the process of 
gaining access to online communities and interacting with others. For ex-
ample, social network sites allow users opportunities to disclose a range of 
personal information – identity, age, gender, and address. The decision to 
disclose personal information like screen names, preferences and contact 
details may be based on a number of factors: the perception of relative safety 
of the online communication platform, opportunities to make friends and 
share similar interests, identity experimentation, anonymity, the accessi-
bility of tools for managing risks and the absence of parents and educators 
in these communication spaces (Lenhart and Madden, 2007c). Social net-
working sites also fulfil the need of users to define their communities and to 
be connected with others. Consequently, search directory services provide 
individuals with opportunities to seek out friends and lifestyle interests. 
Identity and sexual experimentation is also very much a part of the network 
sociability, and the transition from adolescence into adulthood. To some 
children, the anonymised and disintermediated environment provides 
them with an opportunity to experiment with different persona and life-
style experiences. Others use the online environment to seek assistance and 
support from their peers (Livingstone et al., 2011). Whilst chat and IM cre-
ate invaluable spaces for social interaction and learning, the Youth Internet 
Safety Survey 2 reported that children were also using communication plat-
forms and tools to assert their autonomy and identity by engaging in discus-
sions about sexual preferences and lifestyles (Mitchell et al., 2007c).

in the networked society, contains three important lessons for risk-based

governance. First, the very same activities, which are celebrated by Web 2.0 
enthusiasts, are regarded as potentially risk-prone activities, even though 
these may not be readily quantifiable (Asselt et al., 2006). Second, the fram-
ing of the “risk-prone” behaviour will inform online child safety governance 
policymaking and strategies (Mitchell et al., 2007a,b). Third, social construc-
tions of childhood will influence the expansion of the precautionary prin-
ciple to address not only risks but the resulting “uncertainties” surrounding 
children’s risk-prone behaviour, and perhaps confirm the politicised nature of 
online child safety governance (James et al., 1997). The latter is of particular 
relevance as politicians and law enforcement may respond to public concerns 
about the effects of particular harms and risks by seeking the private sector to 
communicate and justify their risk management strategies and responses.
It may be useful to spend some time reflecting on how Web 2.0 tech-
nologies and affordances lead to businesses and industry becoming “risk 
producers” and agents in the distribution and individualisation of risk (Van 
Asselt et al., 2009: 359–60; Table 2.4). In a highly competitive environment, 
the business models of social network providers like Twitter, Facebook and 
MySpace and the mobile phone industry recognise the value of innovation. 
Online service providers and manufacturers of new technologies align their 
services with the needs of their users. For example, mobile phone operators

now ensure that their services and devices “avoid overcrowding or creating 
overly complex user interfaces” (Lane et al., 2008).
Mobile phones continue to be packaged with software applications which, 
allow users to send SMS texts and take photographs with ease. Virtual worlds 
have become popular online environments for many children. These are 
applications that leverage the architecture of the Internet and provide users 
with an online environment. Users of these applications can interact with 
each other through a persona, known as avatars, and communicate through 
the use of text and icons. Virtual worlds have also expanded to provide users 
with entertainment and games, which can involve a large number of players 
not confined to any particular geographical locality. In a recent report it was 
stated that more than $1.38 billion was invested in 87 virtual goods-related 
companies. According to the Virtual World Management (now Engage Digital 
Media), there are over 200 youth-oriented virtual worlds (which includes 
those which are planned or in active development).1 The figures show an 
increase, when compared with 150 virtual worlds in 2008. The growth area 
appears to be in the market for children with three sub-categories represent-
ing the age groups 7 and below, 8 to 12 and 13 and above. Some examples 
of virtual worlds for children include Club Penguin, Webkinz, Barbie Girls, 
Moshi Monsters, Lego Universe and Adventure Rock. The demographics of 
these sites suggest that the reasons children access these sites are not dissimilar 
to those we have seen in other mobile social networking environments (Lim 
et al., 2010). Children are provided with tools to enable them to participate 
in communities, share interests and make friends, develop their identity and 
create user-generated content (Jackson et al., 2009; Marsh, 2010).
In summary, the logic of network infrastructures and information flows 
illustrate the democratic, developmental and social opportunities that 
Web 2.0 technologies make possible. These are evident in three areas. First, 
technological affordances create new spaces for communication. Second, 
communication tools are imbued with social and cultural meaning and 
these are reflected in the way users negotiate social norms, relationships 
and their individual identities. Finally, children can exercise their new-
found autonomy, which may not be hindered or governed by parental rules 
and norms. Integrity, reliability and authenticity are assumed to be the ne-
cessary pre-requisites for engagement, affirmation and self-validation. Web 
2.0 technologies provide society, and children in particular, greater choices 
and opportunities. More significantly, in the light of Beck’s risk society, the 
expanding networked society now has in place the necessary conditions, 
which enable risks to be distributed, communicated and individualised. 
Individualisation also brings with it a heightened awareness of the risks 
that are generated from engagement with digital content and network pub-
lics. More importantly, as children now discover their newfound autonomy, 
it is important to note that they still continue to engage in these activities 
within a patriarchal society, which considers them to be vulnerable, risk-

prone and which, crucially, defines the rules within which these freedoms 
are to be enjoyed (Castells et al., 2007: 146–7). In the next section we will 
identify the different dimensions of risks, how these are related to Web 2.0 
technologies and its implications for child protection policymaking.
Online child safety: The individualisation of risks, 
reflexive modernisation and insecurity
The unexceptional nature of online child safety
Palfrey and Gasser stress that the online environment does not raise any novel 
safety or child protection issues – indeed, they argue that parents’ and educa-
tors’ perceptions of the online environment as being more dangerous could be 
attributed to their lack of familiarity with the Internet infrastructure and com-
munication technologies (Palfrey et al., 2008). Whilst not averse to informed 
parenting and rule making, the authors stress that many of the online risks 
and threats have their offline equivalents and the root causes for contact and 
conduct risks are “poor judgment, a lack of concern for the well-being of oth-
ers, human depravity, mental illness, and so forth” (ibid., 2008: 98).
Policymakers are, however, confronted with an unenviable conundrum 
when faced with assertions like these (ITU, 2010). Regulating the commu-
nications and broadcasting industry is challenging at the best of times, 
given the volume and reach of many of the risk-prone activities (e.g. email, 
SMS text, online gaming, social networking) that make children particu-
larly susceptible to online threats. Risk-prone activities include not only the 
amount of time children spend online but also those risks which emerge 
from their engagement with technological affordances and social media 
(Lenhart, 2007). The ABS in its 2009 Children's Participation in Cultural 
and Leisure Activities (CPCLA) Survey reported that 2.7 million children 
aged 5 to 14 years (7 per cent) used the Internet (ABS, 2009). Their on-
line activities included educational activities (85 per cent) and playing on-
line games (69 per cent). These activities are also related to their exposure 
to online risks or suggestive of their tendency to engage in risky online 
behaviours. In this same study, an estimated 3 per cent of children who 
accessed the Internet reported experiencing online safety incidents (e.g. ap-
proximately 72,000 children). Three per cent of children who have mobile 
phones (28,000 children) reported similar negative experiences. Sixty-five 
per cent of teenagers have been contacted by online users not in their peer 
group (Lenhart et al., 2007a: 35), and 31 per cent have “friends” whom they 
have never met, 34 per cent use the sites to make new friends (ibid., 2007a: 
32), 4 per cent of mobile-owning children from the age of 12–17 have sent 
provocative or nude images of themselves via SMS text (Lenhart, 2009: 5) 
and 13 per cent of teens have received threatening or aggressive email, in-
stant message or text messages (Lenhart et al., 2007b: 3). The Eurobarometer 
2007 Survey also reported similar experiences by children in the age groups 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 39
9–10 and 12–14 (Eurobarometer, 2007). Online child safety governance has 
to address the child protection issues emerging from children as users/con-
sumers and the risks generated by misuse of network infrastructure and 
communication technologies (Brenner, 2010). The online environment 
creates incentives for behaviour that we ordinarily would not encounter in 
the offline environment. Yar points to the exceptional nature of the “social 
interactional features of the cyberspace environment” which contributes 
to the growth of illegal activity and vulnerabilities (2006: 12). This is per-
haps misconceived. At best, the online environment can be seen to raise 
intractable problems of policing and enforcing domestic laws and regula-
tions (Brenner, 2010, 163–76). What perhaps distinguishes networked com-
munications and information flows from their real space equivalents are 
the speed, scale and frequency with which deviant criminal activity can 
be perpetrated and the compliance issues they generate for national legal 
systems. However, it should be said that even though the risks are unex-
ceptional, they are essentially invisible and their materialisation uncertain 
(Van Asselt et al., 2009: 360–1). How we identify, assess and respond to risks 
is a perennial problem for designing effective risk-based regulation proc-
esses. The significance of the rhetoric of “safety” and its relationship with 
Beck’s “risk society” is explored more fully below.
The logic of information flows and the individualisation of risks
Digital spaces are now seen as threats to children’s safety and well-being. 
Network structures and information flows provide a new context where so-
ciety becomes preoccupied with managing risks. Mobile phones and social 
networks are regarded as tools for victimising peers, chat rooms can now 
be misused by adults to solicit minors and P2P software programmes en-
able individuals to seek out illegal content stored on networked repositories 
with a global reach. Web 2.0 technologies are regarded by organised crim-
inal gangs as enabling them to undertake their activities without detection 
by law enforcement (Tarissan et al., 2009). Often, this can be done across 
transnational borders and without regulatory oversight (GAO, 2003). As 
noted previously, communication networks now create multiple opportun-
ities for misuse and numerous access points through which children can be 
exposed to harm. Not only can a child be exploited through a number of 
access points (e.g. mobile phones, email, IM, virtual worlds, online games 
and social networking sites) but the abuse or exploitation of a child victim 
can also be relayed live to other observers for their sexual gratification or the 
impact can be significantly intensified by making the content or incident ac-
cessible to everyone with an Internet access (e.g. sexting and cyberbullying). 
It is this sheer complexity of the networks of information flows and the prob-
lems of managing risks and uncertainty that exacerbates the problems of 
policing and the difficulties faced in securing compliance with national laws 
and rules. Information flows are seen as contributing to the growing feeling 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

40 Online Child Safety
that the networked society generates risks that cannot be easily managed and 
controlled. Some continue to view the characteristics of networks and infor-
mation as the cause of social disorder and uncertainty “reminiscent of the 
wild, wild West” (Chisholm, 2006: 75) Policymakers have responded to the 
growing anxiety by adopting managerial strategies like identifying the “risk 
categories” as well as the activities that expose children to unacceptable risks 
to their safety and well-being. Accordingly, studies have been undertaken 
to help inform policymakers, law enforcement, parents and educators about 
the relationship between children’s online activities and incidents encoun-
tered in these environments. Managing risk and uncertainty involves a pro-
cess of generating surveys, studies, reports and research. The EU Kids Online 
Project is an apt example of one reflexive modernisation activity where em-
pirical surveys and studies are regarded as an appropriate basis for promoting 
informed decision-making and formulation of policies (Table 2.5).
Even as a general overview of the nature of the online child safety gov-
ernance challenge, this taxonomy provides us with a snapshot of Beck’s risk 
society – risk, reflexive modernisation and individualisation of risks. It also 
illustrates a potential dilemma for governance strategy since a scientific ap-
praisal of the risks is not readily possible as the likely materialisation of the 
harm is uncertain until a series of causal behaviours are engaged in. For ex-
ample, faced with media and law enforcement reports of the threats posed 
by online sexual predators, policymakers take the view that the potential 
risk under conditions of uncertainty must be avoided by implementing rules 
and precautionary norms (e.g. privacy rules, filtering software, parental con-
trol rules and children being encouraged not to speak with strangers). The

globalisation of risk-based regulation is also evident in the reflexive processes 
in play in countries like Australia, Canada, the United States and Member 
States in the EU, who have also undertaken similar mapping exercises with 
the aim of grounding their responses in empirical work. The focus of the child 
protection surveys is frequently directed at the relationship between chil-
dren’s access to the Internet and the likelihood of their increased exposure 
to online risks (Livingstone and Haddon, 2009b; AMF, 2009; Eurobarometer, 
2006). In Canada a comprehensive study was conducted seeking to identify 
the attitudes, expectations and practices of children and young Canadians 
regarding their use of the Internet (Media Awareness, 2005). The study – 
Young Canadians in a Wired World Phase II, Trends and Recommendations – con-
firms the growing consensus amongst researchers and policymakers across 
the world that as the Internet and communication technologies become an 
integral part of children’s lives, there will be an increase in their exposure 
and potential vulnerability to online safety incidents (2005: 5). The study 
also revealed that children (grades 8 and 9) encountered a number of sites 
with violent (28 per cent) or sexually inappropriate (32 per cent) content 
(2005: 17). Children, in this study, indicated that they did not actively search 
for websites with adult chat (91 per cent), only 16 per cent admitted search-
ing for pornography, and boys were more likely than girls to seek out sites 
with violent or offensive content (2005: 18). These findings from Canada 
also correspond very much with the findings made by the Kaiser Family 
Foundation’s Generation M2 regarding children’s media consumption hab-
its (Rideout et al., 2010; OSTWG, 2010; ACMA, 2010a). In its studies of 
media consumption habits and trends amongst children and their families, 
the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) noted the 
close correspondence between media penetration in society and children’s 
increased exposure to online safety risks (ACMA, 2010a). The findings also 
provide a context for thinking about the governance options and the nature 
of the measures to be adopted within the MSIG framework. A brief account 
of the three risks, which are mediated through networks and information 
flows will now be provided, and these are online sexual solicitation, illegal 
and inappropriate content and peer victimisation.
Online sexual solicitation
Web 2.0 technologies provide individuals with new avenues through which 
children can be targeted and lured into sexual activity without detection by 
parents or educators. Crucially, in online sexual solicitations, the offender 
aims to develop a foundation of trust with the child victim (CEOP, 2010a). 
Olsen observes that individuals targeting potential victims aim to identify
three categories of characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable 
to a predator’s lure: personality traits and emotional traits, behavioral 
patterns, and dysfunctional family dynamics. (Olson, 2007: 238)
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

42 Online Child Safety
Olsen is quick to add that the existence of these characteristics does not invari-
ably lead to a meeting or abuse. The problems in establishing the identity of 
online participants and the ease with which some adults have used social en-
gineering techniques to solicit minors for sexual activity have raised concerns 
about the security of these communication platforms for children. For ex-
ample, in R v Newman (2010), the offender set up false identities in chat rooms 
accessed by young people with the aim of identifying prospective victims. In 
R v Asplund (2010), the offender had at his disposal a wide range of communi-
cation tools (e.g. mobile phones, SMS text messages and the Internet)
to feed into and gratify his sexual titillation and fantasies with a long term 
view of having her submit to sexual activity with him ... demonstrated by 
his use of the Internet to persuade her to send him photos of a highly 
intimate and sexual nature, by his access to resources to shower her with 
money and bombard her with communications, by his toying and ma-
nipulative Internet exchanges earlier referred to. (2010: paragraph 7)
Apart from the risk of children meeting their online contacts “face-to-face”, 
it is also becoming apparent that a number of offenders use chat rooms and 
IM to engage in discussions with children about sexual matters as a way of 
self-gratification and grooming a child for non-contact sexual activity. These 
“hit and run” tactics have been particularly noticeable with the emergence of 
webcams. Online sexual solicitation can be broadly understood as the pro-
cess by which a sender aims to procure a child to engage in sexual activity or 
other forms of sexual gratification. This can include flirtation as well as more 
explicit forms of sexual activity (McQuade et al., 2008). Online sexual solicita-
tion is one of the major parental concerns and source of anxiety and distress. 
In Australia, over 47 per cent of the parents in a survey expressed fears about 
their children talking to strangers (ACMA, 2009b: 75). In a recent study, it 
was pointed out that children received most online sexual solicitations from 
their peers or individuals from the age groups of 18 and 21 (ISTTF, 2008:14). 
The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) highlighted a 
rise in reports about grooming activity in online environments frequented by 
children (CEOP, 2009). The report notes that CEOP investigations increased 
from 20 per cent in 2006/7, 40 per cent in 2007/8 to 48 per cent in 2008/9 
(CEOP, 2009: 8–12). It is also apparent, as the study conducted at the Crimes 
against Children’s Research Centre points out, that one in five minors tend 
to be solicited online (Finkelhor et al., 2000; Wolak et al., 2006). There are 
a number of explanations for online solicitations of young children in par-
ticular. Adults, with an interest in young children can, for example, come into 
contact with children without an actual meeting in a physical environment. 
Social networking sites provide a range of facilities for gathering information 
(Kim-Kwang, 2009). Public directories on social networking sites contain a 
wealth of information, which are set out under various headings – groups, 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 43
age, name, email, location and gender. Profile information, comment and 
dialog tools and syndication feeds Really Simple Syndication, for example, 
provide offenders with mechanisms for monitoring their victims and gather-
ing any new information uploaded by them. The task of identifying targets 
and gathering information about potential victims begins with perpetrators 
accessing directories on social networking sites and participating in chat 
rooms frequented by children (Kontostathis et al., 2010). For example, de-
pending on the privacy settings of the child and those on the child’s network 
of friends, the acceptance of the offender as a friend on the social networking 
site will give the individual immediate access to the child’s posts and profile 
pages. Most online sexual solicitations with children take place after an of-
fender has gathered all the information about potential victims and assessed 
their amenability to being approached. The Provincial Court of Nova Scotia, 
in the trial of R v Randall (2006), was told that the accused logged into Internet 
chat rooms and scanned the profiles and communications before identifying 
his potential child victims. In R v Gajjar (2008), the offender used chat rooms 
on the Internet entitled “Family Sex” to engage in grooming activity. Online 
forums like these involve participants being favourably disposed towards 
sexually graphic communications. The offender in Tector v R (2008) used a 
pseudonym to send emails and text messages to persuade the victim to en-
gage in sexual activity and even provided financial inducements. In R v Dragos 
(2010), the offender met the complainant on an Internet chat room called 
Habbo Hotel. This communication platform is designed to enable its users to 
discuss the sale of items of furniture for hotel rooms, and socialise with each 
other. The accused and the complainant used webcams to engage in non-
contact sexual activity and communicated frequently through MSN. In all 
these instances, offenders tended to exploit the fact that electronic communi-
cations do not require face-to-face contact, and their belief that children were 
unlikely to disclose these interactions to parents or educators (Livingstone et 
al., 2011). Webcams have also been used by individuals to record live images 
of children, which were subsequently stored, distributed or uploaded onto a 
website. In some cases, offenders have used images or conversations involving 
children they have been conversing with to coerce them into engaging in 
non-contact sexual activity, or arrange a face-to-face meeting. Malware have 
been used to allow individuals gain unauthorised access to a child’s computer 
system, buddy lists, and webcams. On July 2010, a hacker broke into a child’s 
computer, and gained remote access to the webcams of 150 girls (Deutsche 
Welle, 2008). Recently, a 25-year-old man coerced a 11-year-old girl to engage 
in acts of indecency in front of her webcam (Chong, 2010). He recorded these 
acts and threatened to release the images on the Internet unless she complied 
with his requests. According to the CEOP,
there is also a marked trend of the use of webcam streaming chat sites, 
enabling offenders to interact either through instant messages and/or 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

44 Online Child Safety
webcam to share previously captured footage or live-time images of abuse 
of children in their care. (Selgren, 2010)
It is not always the case that adults seduce young adolescents (R v Grout 
(Phillip) (2011)). Some children lie about their ages or even pretend to be 
older than they actually are, so that they can engage in non-contact sexual 
activity with persons they meet online. Many children, it seems, are at ease 
with interacting with strangers online (Wolak et al., 2008: 342–3). Wolak, 
Finkelhor and Mitchell point to the findings from a survey which show 
that young children also use the freedom and anonymity offered by Web 
2.0 technologies to gain the necessary sexual experience and confidence, 
which can later be used by them to develop relationships in the offline en-
vironment (Wolak et al., 2006). In a study by Finkelhor, Mitchell and Wolak, 
if was found that 7 per cent of the children interviewed engaged in sexual 
conversations with strangers in chat rooms (Finkelhor et al., 2000). Some 
children have been known to engage in the practice of setting up ‘jailbait 
webcams’ where teenagers create profiles on websites, with links offering 
sex shows and photographs for financial reward. The accounts also sug-
gest why children’s online activities generate so much anxiety and concern 
notwithstanding the fact that for the majority of children who do not like 
unsolicited sexual attention simple measures can be adopted to deal with 
such situations (Wolak et al., 2006). The task of making accurate risk assess-
ments is also complicated by the fact that children’s online interactions 
with strangers cannot be invariably depicted as harmful. In an important 
study funded by the European Commission, it was found that 30 per cent 
of their sample of Internet users formed a friendship with someone they 
had met online (Livingstone et al., 2005a). Eight per cent of them had met 
the person face-to-face. The majority of these meetings were positive, and 
where face-to-face meetings did take place, the child concerned often took 
a friend or parent with them, or told someone where they were going in ad-
vance. In a report issued by the Internet Safety Technical Task Force (ISTTF), 
it was noted that non-technology-mediated sex crimes against children out-
weighed those perpetrated through the Internet (ISTTF, 2008: 10). These 
accounts of the risk-prone nature of children’s online activities illustrate the 
difficulties faced by parents and educators in making a proper assessment 
about how best to manage threats posed by online sexual solicitation as the 
traditional visual and safety cues are not present in electronic interactions.
Illegal or inappropriate content
Children and young people now have increased opportunities to access illegal 
or inappropriate content (Ybarra, et al., 2005; Table 2.6). Communication 
platforms provided by Smartphones, video game and PlayStation consoles 
(e.g. Nintendo Wii or Sony PlayStation) can now be used by children to access 
a wide range of content without parental oversight (European Commission, 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 45
2011a: 52, 57). We can categorise problematic content that children can 
access or be exposed to into those that are illegal (e.g. child abuse content) 
and those which are inappropriate or harmful (e.g. pro-anorexia, bulimia 
and dating websites). In many countries there are content classification 
schemes which define the subject matter that can be made available to a 
general audience and those which are illegal. Children’s access to and use 
of the Internet can lead to potentially harmful or age-inappropriate content 
being accessed either deliberately or inadvertently. A number of websites 
hosting adult content do not provide effective age-verification controls – 
most websites providing such content only provide a notice requiring the 
visitor to verify that they are of an age where access to adult content is per-
missible. Search engine operators like Google or Yahoo provide tools which 
enable individuals to access adult material, images and videos. A number of 
websites also host user-generated content, which can be accessed for free, 
and do not have effective age-verification tools. The lack of effective age-
verification controls is confirmed by surveys and reports (Livingstone et al., 
2005a; Ybarra et al., 2005).
OfCom found that around 16 per cent of children aged 8 to 15 encoun-
tered inappropriate or violent content when using Web 2.0 technologies 
(2006: 45). A survey of children aged 9 to 10 and 12 to 14 across 29 coun-
tries found that children had either encountered violent or pornographic 
websites or harmful content (Hargrave, 2009: 8). This is a finding that is 
also mirrored in national reviews undertaken in countries like the United 
States and Australia (OSTWG, 2010: 14–16; ACMA, 2009b: 43). The studies 
did, however, indicate that children regarded encounters with problematic 
content as being of less concern than, for example, harms caused by mal-
ware and viruses. The 2008 Eurobarometer Survey revealed that over 65 
per cent of parents feared that their children may be exposed to sexual or 
violent content or images of an explicit nature (Eurobarometer, 2008: 5). 
Children’s exposure to inappropriate and harmful content is an important

online child safety issue. Many children reportedly use the Internet to 
access inappropriate and harmful content like self-harm and suicide (Royal 
College of Psychiatrists, 2010: 52). What concerns educators and parents is 
that whilst a number of websites provide children with invaluable assist-
ance, there is some evidence of certain websites normalising the practice 
of self-harm and suicide (Whitlock et al., 2006; Hargrave et al., 2006). More 
worryingly, it has been reported that children are increasingly accessing in-
formation from online pro-eating disorder and self-harm communities (Fox 
et al., 2005: 944–71). Self-harming behaviour, for example, is now regarded 
as a major public health problem (Hawton et al., 2005: 891–4). The Royal 
College of Psychiatrists also reported that 4 in 1,000 people in the United 
Kingdom have harmed themselves (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2010). 
Children as young as eight years old have been found to harm themselves 
and adolescent girls were more likely than boys to engage in the practice 
(Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2010: 31). One in five schoolchildren with a 
history of self-harming first discovered about self-harm from material they 
accessed online (Whitlock et al., 2006). It also appears that without timely 
intervention those children who are most at risk or vulnerable are likely to 
accept the accuracy and reliability of the information presented to the det-
riment. There is also particular concern with regard to children’s access to 
racist or xenophobic material on websites, since it is felt that consumption 
of such content could encourage prejudice, reinforce stereotypes and even 
incite bullying or other forms of peer victimisation (Ray et al., 2001). In 
addition to these concerns other technological affordances like emails, IM 
and social networking sites now provide individuals with another medium 
for engaging in race- or gender-related abuse (Defeis, 1992; Blumenfeld et al., 
2010). The Byron Report advocated the use of education and regulatory 
mechanisms (e.g. codes of practice) to reduce the availability of harmful 
and offensive content (Byron, 2004: paragraph 4.34–43). Interestingly, the 
Report did not regard the requirement that web hosts remove material about 
harmful behaviours from their sites as a sustainable risk management re-
sponse (ibid.: paragraph 4.33). One recurring view is that the public interest 
would not be served by blocking access to such content since “[b]anning 
such content risks driving vulnerable young people away to more obscure 
sites” (Byron, 2008: paragraphs 4.35–36) Even if the UK government did de-
cide to make access to inappropriate content unavailable to children, these 
are likely to provoke objections from industry on the ground that the puta-
tive harms are more effectively addressed by educators and parents through 
the provision of relevant safety information and tools. In addition to this, 
it should be noted that technical solutions like filtering and blocking have 
undoubted limitations as a content regulatory mechanism. In a recent 
study funded under the SIP it was reported that many Internet filters did 
not adequately regulate the various forms of age-inappropriate or harmful 
content found on social networking sites, chat rooms and blogs (European 
Commission, 2011a).

Peer victimisation
There is general consensus that communication technologies now bring to 
the forefront increased opportunities that mobile phones and the Internet 
provide for victimisation (Lenhart, 2007). Bullying can, for example, take 
place through texts, emails, mobile phones or on social networking sites. Acts 
of coercion include the unauthorised distribution of texts and embarrassing 
images of children and film clips of victims being subjected to assaults, 
known as “happy slapping”. Private information posted online have also 
been copied and distributed without the owner’s consent, with the aim of 
causing distress. In a recent study undertaken in Iowa, United States, it was 
found that transgender bullying was quite common amongst young adoles-
cents (Blumenfeld et al., 2010). Blumenfeld and Cooper noted that lesbian, 
gay, bisexual and transgender individuals were increasingly subjected to 
victimisation by peers on social networking sites and other communica-
tion platforms (2010: 2–10). We should also add to this category of victims 
children who are disabled or who have particular learning difficulties (TK v 
New York City Department of Education (2011)). A three-year study in Australia 
noted an increase in peer victimisation (Cross, 2009). This study was com-
missioned by the Australian government amidst growing anxieties over the 
use of communication technologies to engage in “covert bullying” and the 
findings confirm growing concerns shared by policymakers in many coun-
tries about the scale of peer victimisation and its impact on victims and 
perpetrators (see Table 2.7).
In their studies on children’s use of technologies Hinduja and Patchin sug-
gest a close correspondence between increased consumption of Web 2.0 tech-
nologies and the rise in children’s exposure to victimisation and, in a number 
of cases, participation in the deviant activity (see Tables 2.8 and 2.9).
These communication platforms are also venues where peer victimisation 
is encountered (Kowalski et al., 2007; Patchin et al., 2010a,b). Consequently,

the misuse of technologies and departure from social or ethical norms to 
humiliate and cause maximum upset illustrates how such activities can es-
calate into child protection issues.
Framing the risk facing children is in itself a complex endeavour. For 
example, in TK (2010), the peer victimisation activities included the mak-
ing of prank phone calls to the victim and drawings depicting the victim 
in a negative light. At the recent White House Conference on Bullying 
Prevention, over 40 per cent of the educators and support staff surveyed 
reported that bullying was a major problem in their schools (White House, 
2011). Cyberbullying has been described as a type of conduct where
someone repeatedly uses the Internet or a mobile phone to deliberately 
upset or embarrass somebody else. It is intended to harm others and can 
include sending mean or nasty words or pictures to someone over the 
Internet or by mobile phone. (ACMA, 2009c: 63)
Another view is that cyberbullying involves a
repeated or sustained pattern of intentional cyber-attacks that causes dis-
tress and is directed against a specific student or group ... [it can ] also be a 
multi-faceted or multi-step campaign of humiliation or hostility that causes 
distress and is directed against a specific student or group. (AMF, 2009: 4)

50 Online Child Safety
The absence of a settled meaning or understanding of the term makes 
it difficult to frame the problem, and more often than not can lead to 
safety measures and strategies that adopt a managerial approach to risk 
management – “delete offensive texts and emails”, “do not upload in-
formation on websites” and “mobile phones should not be used during 
school hours”. The rise in bullying, particularly through the use of Web 
2.0 technologies, cannot be simply attributed to the existence of a legal 
and policy vacuum (Shariff, 2009) or to the fact that new technologies 
enable children to express their aggression (Hinduja et al., 2009). In their 
study, Ybarra and Mitchell highlight the close relationship between on-
line and offline bullying (Ybarra et al., 2004). In some instances, it was 
found that those who were victims in the offline environment used the 
online environment to redress the power and social balance when inflict-
ing distress on their perpetrators (Patchin et al., 2006; Ybarra et al., 2007). 
In one survey, 56 per cent of the online aggressors claimed to have been 
the subject of offline victimisation (Ybarra et al., 2004). Interviews com-
missioned by ACMA reported that a child’s exposure to peer victimisation 
incidents also showed a marked increase with the age of the child (ACMA, 
2009c: 66).
Technology-mediated victimisation has three features that incentivise 
“an overt, intentional act of aggression towards another person online” 
(Ybarra et al., 2004: 1038) or “wilful and repeated harm inflicted through 
the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices” (Hinduja 
et al., 2009: 5). These are the anonymity that the bully leverages to vic-
timise an individual; the viral nature of the victimisation (i.e. many to one) 
and the lack of visibility in the consequences of the victimisation. Swearer 
highlights a number of risk factors that contribute to bullying and victim-
isation: individual risk factors (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic status, eth-
nicity and religion), peer-group risk factors (e.g. homophily and deviancy), 
school risk factors (e.g. educators’ attitudes, school architecture, belonging, 
academic and social engagement) and family risk factors (e.g. violence in 
family, family upheavals) (Swearer et al., 2010).
The media spotlight on peer victimisation has elevated bullying into 
public and political consciousness. Such is the gravity with which peer 
victimisation is viewed that the White House was moved to convene a 
Conference on Bullying Prevention. Interestingly, the First Lady remark’s 
illustrates the close interplay between heightened public anxiety, parents’ 
individualisation of fears for their children’s well-being and the media’s def-
inition of the problem:
I want to thank all of you for joining us here today to discuss an issue 
of great concern to me and to Barack, not just as President and as First 
Lady, but as a mom and a dad. And that is the problem of bullying in our 
schools and in our communities ...

As parents, this issue really hits home for us. As parents, it breaks our 
hearts to think that any child feels afraid every day in the classroom, or 
on the playground, or even online. It breaks our hearts to think about 
any parent losing a child to bullying, or just wondering whether their 
kids will be safe when they leave for school in the morning.
And as parents, Barack and I also know that sometimes, maybe even a lot 
of the time, it’s really hard for parents to know what’s going on in our 
kids’ lives ... 
But parents aren’t the only ones who have a responsibility. We all need 
to play a role – as teachers, coaches, as faith leaders, elected officials, and 
anyone who’s involved in our children’s lives. And that doesn’t just mean 
working to change our kids’ behavior and recognize and reward kids who 
are already doing the right thing. It means thinking about our own be-
havior as adults as well. (White House, 2011).
Many of the observations made by Beck resonate in this excerpted speech – 
heightened anxiety, risks generated by information flows, children viewed 
as being vulnerable to risks as well as being perpetrators of online safety 
incidents and the need for risk management strategies. This is not to say 
that efforts to combat peer victimisation are not being made (Olweus, 2007; 
Sampson, 2002; Mencap, 2007). The public health model, which regards 
targeted interventions and support, creating appropriate school culture of 
respect and civility, social skills training, monitoring and engagement with 
parents and the community as a governance strategy, is an important step 
towards creating a “whole-school/community” approach to bullying pre-
vention (Chamberlain et al., 2010).
Managing insecurity (anxiety) and reflexive modernisation
Risk is conspicuous even though Web 2.0 technologies and network publics 
appear on the surface to involve nothing more than participatory genres and 
cultures of self-presentation and identity experimentation. Questions about 
how we manage risks the way we do, the evidence informing the conclusions 
drawn from the relationship between technology and risks, the assumptions 
we make about children’s use of media and the evolving role of parent-
ing cultures are very much a part of living in the risk society (Beck, 1999). 
Buckingham is right when he alludes to children being regarded as natural 
subjects for regulatory oversight, since “assumptions about who these other 
people are – and, in this case, about what ‘childhood’ is, or should be” (2000: 
104). The threat of technology-enabled crime has given rise to a growing 
demand for strategies for prevention and control, particularly in the area of 
online child exploitation. Mazzarella regards societal safety concerns borne 
out of interest in children’s immersion in communication technologies as 
indicative of cultural attitudes towards children – a body of individuals re-
quiring constant supervision and monitoring (2007: 46–7).

Two further observations need to be made with regard to the process of re-
flexive governance in the area of online child safety. First, risk-taking behav-
iour amongst children is conceptualised in negative terms whether it is in 
virtual worlds, social networking sites or network publics. It is readily assumed, 
for example, that children’s exposure to potential (or perceived) contact and 
non-contact risks results from their willingness to disclose personal identifi-
able information online, their immaturity and lack of understanding about 
the nature of the risks. It is true that one of the consequences of being con-
nected with communication networks is that everyone is potentially at risk, 
even though paradoxically, it is unlikely to be experienced by all individuals. 
Interestingly, children’s online activities and use of Web 2.0 technologies 
are singled out and described as “risk-prone behaviours” (ITU, 2010b: 16). 
It is important to acknowledge that many children who are solicited online 
by adults do not arrange to meet them. Social networking sites, chat and 
IM platforms have tools to block and report unwanted contact. Recently, 
Facebook created a social abuse reporting mechanism for individuals to alert 
their “friends” about potential abusive or inappropriate activity. Ironically, 
rather than demonise activities and behaviours as “risk-prone”, it should also 
be remembered that it is through the norms of sharing and engagement that 
a community of networked sociability can be leveraged to reinforce civility 
and respect. The integration of civic responsibility and appropriate behav-
iour norms through design solutions in effect allocates to children some of 
the responsibility for policing the networked community. In viewing all on-
line activities as “risk-prone” or “risky” it has been suggested that we may 
attach little importance to the value of positive risk taking in promoting 
good decision-making skills, developing resilience and enhancing children’s 
ability to respond to online incidents in a safe and responsible manner. One 
is also inclined to agree with Gill, when he suggests that curbing a child’s 
ability to take reasonable risks may be counterproductive and have the un-
intended effect of leading them to engage in more dangerous and unsuper-
vised activity (Gill, 2007: 15–16). Second, the culture of reflexive governance 
has also led to the institutionalisation of risk management. The State has an 
obvious role in allaying public fears and concerns, as suggested by the former 
Home Secretary David Blunkett:
Public protection, particularly of children and the most vulnerable, is this 
Government’s priority ... But sexual crime, particularly against children, 
can tear apart the very fabric of our society. It destroys lives and commu-
nities and challenges our most basic values. (Home Office, 2002: 5)
In a House of Commons Select Committee hearing, the following obser-
vation was made about the technology and its implications for parents:
However, anyone who regularly watches television or reads the press is 
likely to have become aware of growing public concern in recent months 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 53
at the Internet’s dark side: the easy availability of hardcore pornography, 
which people may find offensive, the uploading by ordinary people of 
film of real fights, bullying or alleged rape, or the setting up of websites 
encouraging others to follow extreme diets, or self-harm, or even commit 
suicide. In particular, there is increasing anxiety among parents about the 
use of social networking sites and chatrooms for grooming and sexual preda-
tion. (House of Commons, 2008: 7) (my emphasis)
As a broad statement of intent, these observations appear to overstate both 
the context and experiences of many children and consequently advocate 
the need for greater protection and oversight of children’s online activities. 
Management of theoretical risks rather than those encountered by children 
becomes the focal point of the precautionary approach to child safety gov-
ernance. Crucially, the difficulties in assessing the scale of the risks, the use 
of risk-based regulation to require shifts in behaviour of all stakeholders (in-
cluding children) and the trade-offs involved also illustrate the challenges 
and potential objections that may be encountered under the MSIG model of 
institutional design and governance (Hood et al., 2001: 181–4).
Children’s risk-prone activities, individualisation of risks and moral panics
Safeguarding children in the online environment can be viewed as mobilis-
ing cultural attitudes towards children and risks – the individualisation of 
risks leads to risk management techniques focusing on perceived and actual 
threats (Giddens, 1991: 198). Policymaking forums at national, regional and 
supranational levels now adopt risk-based regulatory strategies, which en-
gage industry, experts and other stakeholders in identifying and assessing 
the risks faced by children. Holmes has questioned the imbalance in online 
child safety debates (Holmes, 2007). The Byron Report is singled out for 
magnifying the risks faced by children in the online environment rather 
than emphasising good online behaviour and appropriate computer use 
practices (Holmes, 2009: 1175). Risk discourse manifests itself in a number 
of ways in child protection policymaking. McAlinden, for example, high-
lights how media construction of sex offenders contributed to legislative 
responses to regulating sex offenders (2007: 11). Gerbner articulated similar 
discourses about children’s safety and well-being being compromised by 
their exposure to television (Gerbner et al., 1976). It has been suggested that 
anxieties surrounding children are also magnified by the disproportionate 
emphasis placed by both the media and policymakers on the threat land-
scape. A “moral panic”, according to Stanley Cohen, is when a
condition, episode, person or group of persons emerges to become defined 
as a threat to societal values and interests; its nature is presented in a styl-
ized and stereotypical fashion by the mass media; the moral barricades 
are manned by editors, bishops, politicians and other right-thinking 
people. (1972: 1)

54 Online Child Safety
The concerns raised by the Attorney General’s press release (noted at the start 
of Chapter 1) could be regarded as addressing a “condition”, “episode” and 
a “group of persons” which pose threats to children’s safety and well-being. 
Online service providers, parents and educators, according to the definition 
of a “moral panic”, would seem now to be the digital equivalent of “bishops” 
and “right-thinking” individuals. The media reporting could also be seen 
as one example of risks facing children being presented in a “stylized and 
stereotypical fashion” (Ungar, 2001; Garland, 2008). The law enforcement 
response in relation to the presence of online sexual predators and potential 
threats for children is depicted as legitimating the elevation of safeguard-
ing children as a social and moral obligation on all adults and businesses 
in society. The risk-based regulation model extends to corporate stakehold-
ers – social networking sites and mobile phone providers now become the 
focal points for allocating blame and responsibility (Critcher, 2008). The 
mischaracterisation of the precautionary principle will only serve to deflect 
“from the truth and thus simply makes it more difficult to figure out what 
we should do to effectively address the situation” (Ohler, 2010: 144). The 
European Commission was clear in its Communication that
[t]he precautionary principle, which is essentially used by decision-mak-
ers in the management of risk, should not be confused with the element 
of caution that scientists apply in their assessment of scientific data. 
(European Commission, 2010: 3)
Determining what is a proportionate policy response continues to prove 
to be an ongoing challenge since the construction of risks and their align-
ment with child abuse and victimisation evoke strong emotive reactions 
(Ostertag, 2010). Increased regulatory interventions tend to fuel rather than 
allay concerns. This is hardly surprising since
the government in many ways reinforces adult perceptions of risk to chil-
dren by reacting to public and media pressure rather than responding 
to evidence. This can mean that policies that reflect and reproduce risk 
anxiety rather than reflecting a proper, informed evaluation or appraisal 
of the real dangers facing children. (Madge et al., 2007: 22)
Public anxiety and concerns leading to moral panics pose considerable prob-
lems for policymakers (Goode, et al., 1994). McAlinden regards the cycle 
of moral panic as reconstructing social reality, resulting in perceived risks 
being transformed into a discourse about a society “full of sexual predators” 
(2007: 11). The process of “constructing a social problem” has a more im-
mediate relevance – it leads to a cycle of, what Beck regards as, heightened 
anxiety and public expectation that policymakers respond to the critical ten-
sions raised by children’s exposure to Web 2.0 technologies (Hawkins et al., 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 55
1983). Taking the MySpace incident, which opened the discussion in the 
book as an example, very little weight or importance was attached by the 
Attorney General to the practical question of whether the online services 
provider had taken appropriate and reasonable measures in enhancing the 
safety of its products and services. Without MySpace’s due diligence pro-
tocols, 90,000 registered sex offenders would not have been identified in 
the first place. The Sentinel SAFE software, which is funded and developed 
by MySpace, cross-references the information of its 130 million users with 
the national database of known registered sex offenders. By focusing on 
the uncertainty generated by the presence of the registered sex offenders, 
risk management becomes inseparable from managing uncertainty – conse-
quently, it seems that in the absence of absolute proof that uncertain risks 
are eradicated, social networking sites are to be viewed as unsafe for chil-
dren (Ungar, 2001: 273). The press release also contributes to increased pre-
occupation with managing uncertainty, as it appears to imply the existence 
of an ideal or appropriate risk management response. A recent illustration 
of the uncertain boundaries between moral panics and legitimate risk man-
agement governance can be seen in the claim made by CEOP to have made 
the online environment safer, following the adoption by social networking 
sites and a number of online service providers and ISPs of the ClickCEOP 
reporting button (CEOP, 2009: 15). Without overstating the obvious, if this 
claim holds true, it is difficult to see why the same could not be said for the 
efforts made by MySpace or Facebook in adopting the proactive measures 
that they have. Accordingly, as risk is pervasive in society, and is accentu-
ated by networks and information flows
fear of crime is a particularly apt discourse within the modernist quest 
for order since the risks it signifies, unlike other late modern risks, are 
knowable, decisionable, (actionable), and potentially controllable. In an age 
of uncertainty, discourses that appear to promise a resolution to ambiva-
lence by producing identifiable victims and blameable villains are likely 
to figure prominently in the State’s ceaseless attempts to impose social 
order. (Holloway et al., 1997: 265)
As Fortin points out, policymakers struggle to find an appropriate balance 
when designing systems to manage complex and intractable issues (Fortin, 
2010: 586–7, 590–1). By way of conclusion to this chapter, it may be useful 
to assess how the crossover between moral panics, risks and governance 
takes shape in evolving parental cultures.
Evolving parental cultures in a risk-averse society
For many parents and educators, the Internet and mobile technology are 
seen as increasing children’s vulnerability and exposure to inappropriate 
content, sexual exploitation and peer victimisation (OfCom, 2006; Table 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

56 Online Child Safety
2.10). The findings from the Eurobarometer Survey, noted below, can be 
used to illustrate Beck’s central ideas about living in the risk society, in par-
ticular for evolving parental cultures (Eurobarometer, 2008).
Risk anxiety is particularly noticeable in relation to online sexual solicita-
tion (60 per cent) and exposure to sexual and violent content (65 per cent), 
but does not appear to be particularly high in relation to peer victimisation 
(54 per cent) or exposure to age-inappropriate or harmful content (55 per 
cent). Parents anxieties about children being sexually victimised or exposed 
to sexually explicit content is not new – it should also be noted that it is 
not entirely clear whether the Internet accentuates these anxieties. Another 
interesting finding relates to the number of parents who indicated that they 
were not really worried about online sexual solicitation (36 per cent), ex-
posure to sexual and violent content (31 per cent) or exposure to age-inap-
propriate or harmful content (41 per cent). It seems that parental anxieties 
were much higher in cases where they did not use the Internet themselves, 
in contrast to those who did use the Internet (2008: 30). Additionally, 
where low scores were highlighted, it is unclear from the survey whether

parents were in effect underestimating the realities of children’s experiences 
(Livingstone et al., 2011; Table 2.11).
Whilst parents adopt different safety enhancing strategies, the findings 
show that greater control tends to be exercised over the child’s Internet use – 
these findings can be interpretated in one of two ways. First, parents with 
greater ICT competence and knowledge of the safety issues appear to engage 
more fully with a child’s online activities. Second, the lack of supervision 
could be attributable to a number of factors (e.g. level of ICT competence, 
limited awareness of the risks or trust in children’s online activities). The 
findings from the Flash Barometer Survey also correspond with a similar 
study undertaken by ACMA in 2010:
Parents of 8 to 11 year olds reported that they became increasingly con-
cerned about cybersafety issues because their children were now at an 
age where being online was an integral part of their school education and 
their social life. (ACMA, 2010b: 7)
Another way of interpreting the Flash Eurobarometer findings is to view 
the survey results as illustrations of the way the logic of information flows 
contributes to the convergence of risk anxiety, constructions of childhood 
and parenting cultures. Youn has noted a number of mediatory strategies 
adopted by parents when socialising their children to the risks surround-
ing Internet activity (2008: 362–88). Parents, for example, view their role 
in establishing rules on Internet use at home as an integral aspect of their 
social and moral responsibilities towards children. Those who have a better 
understanding of the scale and extent of the risks may tend to supervise 
and monitor children actively. Parents with younger children may be more 
protective and consequently co-surf or check on their child’s online activ-
ities (Mesch, 2009). McCarty remarks that as parents acquire information 
of their child’s perceived online risky behaviours, it may also lead to more 
active parental oversight (McCarty et al., 2011: 169–74).
The characterisation of children’s lives as being more risky than those of 
adults has also resulted in a discernible shift in the way parents view the 
responses expected from them. This is a view expressed by Knaak, who has 
argued that the ideology of risk has contributed to evolving social norms 
that surround the role of parents in managing risks encountered by children 
at home, school and elsewhere (Knaak, 2009). It is, for example, noticeable 
that many parents justify purchasing mobile phones for their children on 
the grounds of ensuring the child’s safety and allaying parental anxieties 
(Haddon, 2002: 118). The move away from the “bedroom” culture (e.g. chil-
dren using computers in the privacy of their bedrooms) is also indicative 
of the evolving parental views that children’s exposure to risks can only be 
minimised in spaces where they can be monitored (Haddon, 2002). Knaak 
makes an interesting observation, namely, that responsible parenting is now 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Regulating Risks and Web 2.0 Technologies 59
viewed very much through the lens of institutional and regulatory processes 
for managing risks (Knaak, 2009). There is also a noticeable trend in the way 
anxieties about managing risks also lead to greater intervention by industry 
and government in creating a safer environment for children (ITU, 2008a, 
2009d,e). Strategies to promote trust and confidence continue to be merged 
with discourses on empowerment and responsible parenting. Parents are 
not regarded as passive actors, as risk management become institutional-
ised; there is an expectation that they be seen to take an active part in the 
daily online and offline lives of their children. These developments can at 
a very abstract or theorised level be seen as impressing on adults in society 
that a child’s well-being and safety is best assured within an institutional 
framework of defined rules on monitoring computer use and instilling risk-
averse behaviour (Hier, 2003). Networks and information flows have led 
to a gradual weakening in parental authority and control over children 
(Lamborn et al., 1993). In some cases, as Web 2.0 technologies accelerate the 
“de-traditionalisation” of the social paradigm, parents now seek to bolster 
their trust by turning to their own experiences, media accounts of threat 
levels and assessments made by experts and institutions (Hier, 2003). For 
example, ACMA, like many regional and national institutions, continues to 
assist parents in discharging their ethical and social obligations by raising 
their awareness of online safety issues (ACMA, 2010b: 1). This view of the 
role of institutions in shaping parenting cultures can be regarded as another 
example of living a risk society where
the parent is construed as unable to risk-manage effectively without pro-
fessional “support”. Cultural norms ... thus construct the “good/respon-
sible mother” as the mother who is alert to the manifold risks posed to 
her child(ren) by contemporary society, and considers it her job to man-
age these risks through reference to expert opinion. (Lee, 2008: 469)
It is also an illustration of how the patriarchal framework within society 
continues to negotiate the disruptive tendencies of Web 2.0 technologies.
Conclusions
One reason that “online child safety” continues to dominate policymaking 
is that it has rhetorical purchase for a number of child welfare and polit-
ical entities. The claims that reporting mechanisms have saved a number of 
children does not address some of the crucial normative issues at stake when 
risks are “institutionalised” and filtering and blocking are seen as value free. 
It is therefore not surprising that appeals to policymakers, parents, educa-
tors and law enforcement that the fears and anxiety should be kept in per-
spective continue to go unheeded. The main focus has been directed at the 
interplay between design, convergence and risks and its significance for the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

60 Online Child Safety
policy choices governments, regulators, and industry have to grapple with. 
This is a considerable challenge made all the more complicated by the fact 
that our preoccupation with online sexual predatory activity, exposure to 
illegal or harmful content and peer victimisation cannot be easily disentan-
gled from societal constructions of childhood and discourse on risks and 
safety. The chapter has provided some examples and reasons why this might 
be the case. Whilst it is true that childhood is politicised and construc-
tions of the “victim” child continue to define much of how we think about 
societal obligations to children, this chapter has identified an equally im-
portant dimension – how increased risk consciousness can be influential in 
shaping institutional and parental responses towards children’s safety and 
well-being. It is important to recognise how such constructions of risks can 
shape the way safety responses like monitoring, surveillance and restric-
tions on children’s access to and use of Web 2.0 technologies become opera-
tive norms in the networked society. Beck’s insights and of those who have 
examined the impact of “risk consciousness” on parenting cultures reveal 
some of the governance implications arising from the discourse on risk and 
its significance for childhood in the networked society. We need to keep 
these considerations in mind since the architecture and the design princi-
ples that led to the exponential growth of the Internet continue to provide 
the critical infrastructure for economic and social activity (OECD, 2010a: 
38; Schewick, 2010: 387). As policymakers aim to respond to the governance 
challenges, we need to be equally mindful that these developments, even in 
the domain of the criminal law, are
set against the backdrop of a heightened sense of risk consciousness, 
“the new etiquette” of caution, fear and danger has distanced itself 
from judgments about what is morally proper or acceptable, becoming 
transposed into discourses of safety, security and communal living ... To 
put this succinctly, as anxieties endemic to the risk society converge 
with anxieties contained at the level of community, we should expect a 
proliferation of moral panics as an ordering practice in late modernity. 
(Hier, 2003: 19)

Overview
As traditional methods for harming and abusing children become increas-
ingly mediated through Web 2.0 technologies, a new dimension emerges for 
online child safety governance. Convergence has now made possible new 
avenues through which harms can be perpetrated against children. Difficult 
policy issues still have to be confronted as policymakers and regulators grap-
ple with the dilemma of using the criminal law, in an environment where 
enforcement, rather than the application of its substantive rules, is proving 
to be a problem (Luüders et al., 2009). Additionally, the ramifications of an 
expanding child protection agenda for civil liberties and innovation are still 
uncertain (Lindsay et al., 2008). Policymakers and law enforcement are also 
having to deal with the issue of whether the criminal law should be used 
in cases where children become the offenders – sexual solicitation of other 
minors, hacking into social network profiles, posting hateful messages or de-
facing websites and distributing self-generated nude images of themselves. Is 
the criminal law outdated and unresponsive, or does living in a risk society 
require policymakers to reassess how we approach the strategies for extend-
ing legal standards and rules to an increasingly connected and “always-on” 
society? Indeed, it is a particularly relevant question to ask when reflect-
ing on how the criminal law addresses these tensions either through direct 
State intervention or indirectly through the MSIG framework. These matters 
provide the background to the chapter, which is the legal and evidentiary 
issues emerging from the use of the criminal law in managing risks in three 
areas of online child safety governance: online sexual grooming, exposure to 
obscene content (with particular emphasis on child pornography) and peer 
victimisation. I integrate into the analysis an account of the key substan-
tive criminal law rules to highlight its role and shortcomings when address-
ing the regulatory challenges in this area of child protection policymaking. 
Finally, some caveats may be necessary with regard to the discussion that 
follows. This chapter does not rehearse or critique the reports or scholarly

works undertaken by researchers in this field (Akdeniz, 2008; Shariff, 2009; 
Brenner, 2010; Kerr, 2009). Neither does this chapter review the role of crim-
inal law in virtual worlds (Lastowka, 2010). Even though these and other 
works provide some useful insights on the challenges posed by Web 2.0 tech-
nologies to the criminal law, the task undertaken in this chapter is delib-
erately narrowed to a consideration of three specific forms of online child 
safety incidents/risk-prone activities. The aim of the discussion is to reflect 
the nuances of online child safety governance with regard to the stand-
ards and principles the criminal law aims to uphold and, more specifically, 
examine the extent to which Web 2.0 technologies can be said to undermine 
its ability to promote certainty, order, trust and confidence. The governance 
challenge for law and its ability to secure compliance with its standards and 
principles lies at the core of the evolving MSIG framework aimed at confront-
ing parental anxieties resulting from the vulnerabilities children face in an 
environment of de-centralised networks and information flows. Secondly, 
the coverage of these areas will be conducted against the background of the 
national legal system in England and Wales. Where appropriate, references 
will be made to relevant legislation, case law and materials from Australia, 
the United States and Canada, noting that some caution should be exercised 
when making comparisons between the approaches in these jurisdictions, 
given that governments ground their legal and policy responses on their 
“legal traditions, approaches, techniques (e.g. direct regulation vs. self- or 
co-regulation), and law enforcement practices” (Gasser, et al., 2010: 10). The 
differences in legal traditions and policy responses do not detract from the 
tasks undertaken in this chapter. The implications of these rules for eviden-
tiary investigations and online intermediary liability will also be identified 
and explained.
Preliminary observations
As many commentators have pointed out, the criminal law is one means 
through which the State establishes rules and standards of conduct expected 
from its citizens. The role of the State in defining the types of conduct and 
harms where penal sanctions are justified has a public interest dimension 
(Muncie, 2001). Beck’s works on living in the risk society also remind us 
that criminal law is not immune to the way assumptions are made about 
who, when and how legal and moral obligations are imposed on individuals. 
Even self-help is seen as being consistent with the normative foundations of 
the criminal law (Gardner, 1996: 116–17). With regard to child protection, 
however, there have long been tensions regarding the way the criminal law 
targets particular harms, conduct and interests but leaves scope for indi-
viduals to assume responsibility for their own actions (Lacey, 2007: 251). 
Whilst the criminal law has been unequivocal in its prohibition of serious 
forms of commercial sexual exploitation, the evolution of this branch of

public law also illustrates that social and ethical conceptions of responsi-
bility, autonomy and risks continue to present courts and policymakers with 
difficult choices regarding the boundaries of criminal responsibility and li-
ability. These tensions also lie at the core of child protection policymaking 
emerging from technology-mediated harms (e.g. peer victimisation), identi-
fying strategies for regulating the broadcasting and online services industry 
and assessing the role of the law in securing compliance with its standards 
and rules. From a policy perspective, the legal standards provided by the 
criminal law provide a principled framework through which the duties, 
obligations and social norms for maintaining public order in society can be 
identified. It does this by defining the types of prohibited conduct and the 
penalties accompanying violations of its standards and obligations (Goold 
et al., 2007). Ashworth identifies one of the central preoccupations of the 
criminal law as being to “prohibit behaviour that represents a serious wrong 
against an individual or against some fundamental social value or institu-
tion” (Ashworth, 2004: 1). These observations are also very much in line 
with the standards and principles in the UNCRC, in particular Articles 19, 
34 and 37. The criminal law is one instrument through which children can 
be safeguarded from all forms of violence and exploitation (Articles 19 and 
34) and “inhuman or degrading treatment” (Article 37). Securing compli-
ance with the law is made more complex when we recall that the traditional 
model of law enforcement relies on there being a nexus between the crim-
inal act and the territorial space (Brenner, 2004). Crimes which are medi-
ated through technology tend to be categorised in any one of three ways:
  (i)  Offences against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of com-
puter data and systems;
 (ii)  Computer-related offences; and
 (iii) Content-related offences.
Online sexual solicitation or grooming, for instance, is an example of a 
“computer-related offence”, whilst distribution of illegal material (e.g. child 
pornography) would clearly give rise to a “content-related offence”. Hacking 
into a child’s user account with a social networking site and altering data 
would be an example of an act which is held to impair the integrity of the 
computer system. As highlighted previously, the EU Kids Online project indi-
cated that as children’s exposure to the Internet increased, it also resulted in 
an increase in their exposure to some specific online safety incidents – in-
advertently viewing harmful or inappropriate content, becoming victims of 
online harassment, intimidation and bullying and being solicited by stran-
gers for sexual activity (Hasebrink et al., 2009). Though rare, children have 
also been known to meet online contacts for sexual activity.
When contemplating the role of the criminal law in enhancing the safety 
of children, it may be important to also bear in mind the significance of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

64 Online Child Safety
the distinction between their risk-prone activities and risky activities (Table 
3.1). The former is concerned with children’s engagement with technological 
affordances that expose them to online incidents and risks, whilst the latter 
is concerned with children’s risky behaviours as participants or perpetra-
tors (ITU, 2010b: 16–20; Livingstone et al., 2009b). As an example, a recent 
survey highlighted that teenagers (13- to 17-year-olds) posted personal in-
formation, or engaged in communications with strangers, assuming that 
they were invulnerable (Cox Communications, 2010: 9). The Eurobarometer 
2007 and EU Kids Online II 2011 surveys also illustrate the correspondence 
between children’s online activities and their exposure to online safety 
incidents and experiences (Eurobarometer, 2007; Livingstone et al., 2011). 
It should, however, be borne in mind that such distinctions can be used to 
characterise any activity undertaken by a child in both the offline and on-
line environments.
Online child safety governance: Key principles of the 
criminal law
Before considering the extent to which the principles and standards 
enshrined in the UNCRC are reflected in existing criminal laws, four key 
points should be borne in mind. First, it is a fundamental principle of the 
criminal justice system that prosecution provide relevant and admissible 
evidence showing that the offender committed the offence for which he 
is being charged, beyond all reasonable doubt. Second, it follows from this 
that before a defendant can be charged with a crime, the conduct must be

proven to be one, which is described by the law as constituting an offence. 
A failure on the part of prosecution to prove the existence of any one of the 
elements of the offence to the requisite standard of proof will lead to the 
offender being acquitted. Indeed, the requirement for the prosecution to es-
tablish each element of the offence will circumscribe the types of incidents 
when the law is unlikely to intervene. One can infer that this self-imposed 
constraint on the State’s penal authority is consistent with the public policy 
objective that individuals in society also assume some responsibility for 
their well-being. The much publicised prosecution of US v Lori Drew (2009) 
is one example of the complex balances maintained by the criminal law be-
tween State intervention and individual self-help. The facts can be briefly 
recounted. The accused was an adult who set up an account in MySpace 
and assumed the fictional identity of a 16-year-old under the name of “Josh 
Evans”. A photograph of a boy was posted on this site to provide credence to 
the identity assumed. The accused used the pseudonym whilst engaging in 
conversations with Megan. They began to flirt with each other. Sometime 
later, “Josh” informed Megan that he was moving away, and a week later 
said that “the world would be a better place without her in it” (2009: 452). 
Megan committed suicide after reading this message. The tragic death of 
Megan attracted great media attention and public outrage over the conduct 
of the accused. The relevant state law provides that for an accused to be 
found liable for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress the 
following elements must be established: the defendant is shown to have 
acted with intent or was reckless; the conduct must be regarded as extreme 
or outrageous; the conduct must be the cause of extreme emotional distress. 
It is not entirely unexpected that during the first trial, the jury was unable 
to agree as to whether the accused had the requisite mental state of mind, 
namely, to inflict emotional distress either intentionally or by being reck-
less as to the consequence. An attempt was then made to charge the accused 
for a lesser offence of computer misuse. Under the provisions of § 1030 of 
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, it is an offence to access a computer 
without authorisation, or the conduct is regarded as exceeding authorisa-
tion and obtaining information from a computer if carried out in further-
ance of a crime or tortuous act. This attempt proved unsuccessful. The court 
cited with approval, dicta in Kolender v Lawson:
The void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the 
criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can 
understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not en-
courage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. (2009: paragraph 11)
The court concluded that the accused could not be regarded as having com-
mitted a crime on the grounds of violating a website’s terms of reference 
alone; to do this it was observed by the court would have amounted to 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

66 Online Child Safety
an unwarranted extension of the scope of the Act and would criminalise 
many users, including Megan, who had herself used a false age to register an 
account on the site. One reading of this case is that the court adopts a highly 
juridical and technical approach to the issues raised. Another view is that the 
decision illustrates the balance the criminal law sometimes appears to make 
between protection and self-help principles; the ruling in this case indicates 
that beneath the linear and formalistic rules, the criminal law has never 
been entirely comfortable with intervening in situations where the obliga-
tions to be assumed by individuals are not capable of being defined clearly 
or where there is an expectation that individuals assume some responsibility 
for the actions they take (Morse, 1999: 267–70). Third, it is an incontrovert-
ible principle that the person charged is innocent until proven to be guilty 
of the offence for which he is being charged (R v G Lighting (2009); R v Gibson 
(2009); R v Pearson (2009)). Consequently, prosecution need to provide rele-
vant and admissible evidence, which demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt 
that the accused engaged in the crime for which he has been charged. The 
accused can effectively say nothing and require prosecution to prove the 
allegations against him. This was the case in R v Ashby where the accused 
refused to admit to being in possession of indecent images of children on his 
laptop (2009). The accused sold a laptop computer to an individual. Some 
time after having purchased the laptop, the individual started experiencing 
difficulties with the machine and brought it to a shop for repairs. During the 
course of the repair work, a technician inadvertently came across a file con-
taining indecent images of children on the laptop. The police were alerted, 
and the investigations which followed eventually led to the accused being 
traced and charged with possession of child pornography. During the inter-
view, the accused denied any knowledge of being in possession of indecent 
images contained on the laptop, and refused to answer any of the questions 
posed to him. The accused was successfully prosecuted when evidence was 
subsequently produced which indicated his guilt for the offence charged. 
Fourth, unlike the civil law, in criminal prosecutions, the offences under 
consideration in this book require the accused to possess the requisite state of 
mind in respect of the elements of the offence for which he is being charged. 
The type of mental element which leads to culpability will depend on the 
construction of the criminal offence. The mental element may include “in-
tent”, “recklessly”, “wilfully”, “maliciously”, or “reasonable belief” (Feinberg, 
1987: 31). In judicial proceedings, the meanings to be attached to a particular 
mental element will depend on the applicable judicial precedent to the spe-
cific facts before the court (Feinberg, 2003: 3–7).
In the next section, an account will be provided of the role of the crim-
inal law in dealing with contact, content and conduct risks, the substantive 
elements of those offences and the significance of the allocation of the risks 
for the way society and individuals are expected to assume responsibility in 
managing them.

Online sexual solicitation
Virtual worlds, social networking sites, mobile phones and chat rooms pro-
vide new avenues through which children can be exposed to individuals 
seeking to exploit them for sexual activity (Jewkes, 2010). The public policy 
concerns informing the enactment of laws criminalising online sexual ex-
ploitation and abuse of children can be gleaned from the observations made 
in the following House of Representatives report:
With the advent of ever-growing computer technology, law enforce-
ment officials are discovering that criminals roam the Internet just as 
they roam the streets. While parents strive to warn their children about 
the dangers outside of the home, they are often unaware of the dangers 
within – on the World Wide Web. “Cyber-predators” often “cruise” the 
Internet in search of lonely, rebellious or trusting young people. (House 
of Representatives, 1998: 680)
These fears are rooted in the fact that de-personalised communications 
increase children’s exposure to online safety incidents like online sexual 
solicitation. The absence of face-to-face contact enables individuals to cre-
ate false personas or provide misleading information about themselves and 
their interests with the aim of seducing children. As previously noted, social 
networking sites like Facebook, MySpace and Bebo make available techno-
logical affordances, which can be used for both legal and illegal purposes. 
Article 23 CPC Convention makes it clear that online sexual solicitation is 
a violation of the child’s rights to be protected from such abuse. It provides 
a benchmark for legislation in many countries. Article 6 of the Proposed 
Directive requires Member States to enact legislation criminalising the use 
by an adult of ICT to solicit a child who has not attained the age of sexual 
consent under national law, for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity 
(European Commission, 2010e). The legislative changes made to the Sexual 
Offences Act (SOA) 2003 in England and Wales (and similar reforms for 
Scotland and Northern Ireland) anticipate many of the proposed recom-
mendations in the Proposed Directive. More specifically, Article 6 of the 
Proposed Directive envisages the creation of a new offence of solicitation of 
children for sexual offences. It is targeted at an adult’s misuse of the Internet 
and other communication technologies like mobile phones, IM and email 
to solicit minors. Unlike Section 15 of the SOA 2003, the Proposed Directive 
regards a single communication undertaken with the goal of engaging in 
sexual activity with a child as being sufficient to give rise to criminal li-
ability (European Commission, 2010e: Articles 7 and 5(6)). The public policy 
issues raised by children’s exposure to online sexual solicitation have been 
mirrored by parallel legislative activity in many jurisdictions: Provision (2) 
in Article 205 of the Criminal Code (the Czech Republic), Article 240a of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

68 Online Child Safety
the Penal Code (the Netherlands), Article 227–24, of the Penal Code (France) 
(Davidson et al., 2011). Countries like Singapore and New Zealand have also 
amended their laws to reflect the threats posed to children by adults using 
ICTs (e.g. Section 376E of Penal Code (Singapore), Section 131B of the Crimes 
Amendment Act 2005 No. 41, Public Act). It is worth noting in passing that 
signatories to the CPC Convention also undertake to enact “necessary le-
gislative or other measures” to criminalise solicitation of minors for sexual 
purposes (Article 23).
Before looking at three specific legislative attempts which criminalise on-
line sexual solicitation, a brief account of attempts to construct the nature of 
sexual grooming may be helpful in understanding their relevance for gov-
ernance strategies, particularly for the deterrent role of the criminal law.
Sexual grooming laws not only delineate the standards of behaviour 
expected from individuals towards children but its provisions also iden-
tify the types of conduct, which if entered into will give rise to criminal 
liability. This latter aspect is important, since the clearer the prohibited 
conduct, the easier it is for law enforcement to investigate and prosecute an 
offender of the relevant crime. Davidson’s definition of sexual grooming 
aims to capture the dynamics of the offending characteristics by describing 
the criminal activity in terms of
a process of socialisation during which an offender seeks to interact with 
the victim (and sometimes the victim’s family), to share their hobbies 
and interests and to become a part of their life, in order to prepare them 
for abuse. (Davidson et al., 2011: 4)
O’Connell, on the other hand views, the act of sexual grooming as 
comprising
a course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give 
a reasonable person cause for concern that any meeting with a child aris-
ing from the conduct would be for unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2003)
Like Davidson and O’Connell, Gillespie views sexual grooming as a rela-
tional activity involving a child who
is befriended by a would-be abuser in an attempt to gain the child’s con-
fidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive 
activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a 
child. (Gillespie, 2002: 411)
Finally, in a recent review of sexual grooming literature it has been pointed 
out that the above definitions do not capture the way a number of individu-
als engaged in sexual grooming direct their attention towards individuals 
other than the child (Craven et al., 2006). Sexual grooming is regarded as 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 69
embracing a wider range of deceptive conduct, which include “self-groom-
ing”, “grooming the environment and significant others” and “grooming 
the child” (Craven et al., 2006). Sample studies have shown the tendency of 
some offenders to “self-groom” themselves and thereby justify the sexual 
solicitation and abuse of children (Howitt et al., 2007: 469–86). Whilst there 
are doubts about the weight to be accorded to offenders’ accounts of deci-
sions to “groom” or make contact with children, it does highlight that some 
individuals appear to be motivated solely by the need to gratify their fanta-
sies rather than use the online communications as a prelude to an eventual 
meeting (Quayle et al., 2003: 93–106). This last aspect raises some inter-
esting issues about the doctrinal, investigatory and prosecution challenges 
faced when apprehending individuals for engaging in voyeuristic conduct 
for sexual gratification purposes (Feinberg, 2003: 137; Section 8 of the SOA 
2003; R v Grout (Phillip)). The question regarding the acts which constitute, 
for example, “an intention to incite” a child aged 13 to engage in sexual 
activity via a webcam can be problematic. The accused in R v Grout (Phillip) 
engaged in a webcam conversation with a child, and during the interaction 
asked her to reveal her bra and then subsequently suggested that she also 
take off her clothing. The child refused to comply with the last request. It 
is clear from this account why Lord Justice Aikens felt that there was insuf-
ficient evidence to warrant a claim that there was “sexual activity” by the 
mere act of revealing a bra strap or for that matter to charge the accused 
for inciting a child to engage in sexual activity (paragraphs 43–7). Can or 
should the criminal law penalise such individuals by the mere fact that 
the revelation of a bra strap would constitute a form of sexual gratifica-
tion (Feinberg, 2003: 23)? Sexual grooming as a process of deviant criminal 
behaviour comprises a number of characteristics which pose complicated 
normative issues-deception, gaining the cooperation or trust of the child or 
adults who have responsibility for the child and de-sensitisation. None of 
this would appear to be readily apparent when we depict sexual grooming 
as simply involving a “process by which a person prepares a child, signifi-
cant adults and the environment for the abuse of this child” (Craven et al., 
2006: 297). This description does serve the purpose of at least highlighting 
acts, which include inciting a child to engage in sexual activity as a prelude 
to a face-to-face meeting. This move away from “offender” characteristics to 
the dynamic process of victim identification and the strategies adopted by 
perpetrators in de-sensitising children is particularly instructive in helping 
us come to terms with the complex dimensions of the grooming process. 
Attempts have also been made to model the cycle of victimisation that dis-
tinguishes sexual grooming from other types of interaction between adults 
and children. The “precondition model” developed by Finkelhor identifies 
four steps in the cycle leading to abuse: a motivated perpetrator, overcoming 
the inhibitions through rationalisation and justification, overcoming the 
external constraints or barriers to gain access to the child and, finally, redu-
cing the child’s resistance to engaging in sexual activity (Finkelhor, 1984; cf. 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

70 Online Child Safety
Howells, 1995: 201–14). Brackenridge, on the other hand, proposes a three-
step process describing sexual exploitation generally (see Table 3.2).
Ward, Louden, Hudson and Marshall provide an elaborate nine-step 
model, which aims to establish a causal link between the perpetrator’s psy-
chological and social profile, the conditions for planning and access, the 
priming of the victim culminating in the sexual abuse which leads to a 
grounded insight into the process of grooming (Ward et al., 1995). It is fair to 
say that these models vary in terms of emphasis but they do offer an insight 
into the spectrum of activities that begin with the factors motivating the 
entry into a trust relationship by the perpetrator with the targeted victim 
before steps are taken in preparing a child for sexual self-gratification. We 
can use the framework provided by O’Connell in teasing out the issues to 
be grappled with by the law. O’Connell’s six-step grooming cycle illustrates 
how this process evolves from the initial contact to the eventual sexual ac-
tivity (O’Connell, 2003; Table 3.3).
Three particular observations could be made with regard to the signifi-
cance of the process of grooming for the way the criminal law frames the 
relevant legal and evidentiary issues. First, since online sexual grooming 
involves a process where the progress from each stage to the next is not easy 
to discern, conduct must be shown to clearly engage the substantive law. It 
is important to keep this in mind when ascertaining whether the criminal 
law is wanting in its ability “to protect children” (Gillespie, 2002: 411). As 
O’Connell (2003) and, more recently, Bryce note:
The friendship and relationship forming stages are similar to those of 
the development of other online friendships, and involve the offender

approaching and befriending the young person, and encouraging them 
to discuss their life in order to initiate friendship. (Bryce, 2010: 330)
Second, it does not always follow that the “victim selection” stage will 
progress to a “relationship formation” or actual “sexual” stage. One reason 
why that might happen is that the offender may have already obtained 
his sexual gratification at this stage (Attorney General’s Reference (No. 28 
of 2010) (2010)). Alternatively, it could also be that the offender may have 
decided that the risks of detection outweigh the gratification derived or 
the child may have taken steps to block all unwanted contact. Third, the 
time lapse between each stage may vary depending on a number of varia-
bles – motivations of the offender, opportunity and location of the victim 
and offender. Consequently, we may have to accept the observation of the 
Court of Appeal in PDA v R (2008) that grooming “is not a term of art but 
connotes something along the lines of steps taken by the offender to per-
suade, or prepare, or encourage, the object of sexual attention to partici-
pate in sexual activity” (2008: paragraph 8). More generally, both offline 
and online grooming of children are not linear socialisation processes 
that come within a pre-determined time frame, and which can add to 
the complications in detecting or investigating sexual grooming activity 
(Mitchell et al., 2007c). Whilst the criminal law defines the substantive

elements of the offence which justifies legal intervention, O’Connell’s 
identification of the “risk assessment” stage has another significance, 
namely, that it alerts vigilant parents/law enforcement to the possibility 
of other motivations held by the person communicating with the child in 
the online environment and enables early intervention (i.e. “where is your 
computer”, “let us keep this secret to ourselves”, “can we talk privately” 
and “I hope your parents don’t mind you spending so much time on the 
computer”). Whilst the earlier stages in the six-step cycle aim to develop 
a level of trust, the progression in the communications can be seen as 
providing important cues that a more intimate and sexual aspect to the 
relationship is likely to emerge. Finally, these depictions of the cycle of 
victimisation can be used to develop preventative intervention measures 
and programmes as envisaged by Article 20 of the Proposed Directive.
United Kingdom: Section 15 of the SOA 2003
Section 15 of the SOA 2003 (as amended by the Criminal Justice and 
Immigration Act 2008, Section 73(a)) can be seen as a legitimate govern-
ance response aimed at enhancing the safety of children in both the online 
and offline environment. The rationale underpinning this prudential le-
gislation is to ensure that a child who has been rendered vulnerable is not 
subsequently harmed by an actual meeting with the offender or in a non-
contact situation encouraged to engage in sexually inappropriate conduct 
which may go undetected by parents or not reported owing to the child’s 
embarrassment or shame. It should be noted that unlike the provision in 
the Proposed Directive, the offence could be committed through the use of 
electronic and non-electronic communication technologies. Section 15 is 
an inchoate offence. Attempts to rely on rules on incitement or even con-
spiracy run the risk of promoting greater controversy and debates on when a 
child can be deemed to be competent to provide consent in respect of sexual 
activity with adults (cf. Gillespie, 2002). For the purposes of the SOA 2003, 
the law on sexual grooming applies to adults who engage in sexual solici-
tation of children aged below 16. There must be communications with the 
minor on at least two occasions which lead to an actual meeting or result in 
the offender (A) travelling with the intention of engaging in sexual activity. 
The section also provides A with a defence; reasonable belief that the child 
is 16 years old or above. It should be borne in mind that the legal age for 
consenting to sexual activity varies according to the jurisdiction and the 
type of child sexual abuse and exploitation crimes charged. For example, 
the age of consent to sexual activity in England and Wales is 16, but exploit-
ative activity like child pornography is 18. In Spain the age of consent is 14, 
and in Philippines it is 19. In Australia most jurisdictions stipulate the age 
of consent as 16, but South Australia and Tasmania have a higher threshold 
of 17 (Griffith et al., 2007: 30). In the United States, the age limit of 18 
years applies to both online sexual solicitation and child pornography. The 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 73
UNCRC and the CPC Convention recommend that the threshold be raised 
to 18 years of age, so that all children are provided with the maximum legal 
protection possible.
Whilst adults and society may have a view about children communicating 
with strangers, particularly in an online environment, the law’s response is 
more measured. When the question whether the criminal law is violated 
is posed, the sexual grooming activity is formalised in the following man-
ner: is the individual an adult? Is B a child aged 16 years old or above? Have 
there been at least two communications? Has A met B, arranged to meet B 
or travels with the intention of meeting B, which if done would amount to 
a “sexual offence”? Is there cause for A to have believed that B was 16 years 
old? Such is the seriousness with which sexual grooming is viewed that an 
individual convicted under the offence can face imprisonment of at least 10 
years. Prosecutions for grooming have generally been successful, and many 
of the cases heard on appeal are to do with sentencing, which is not the 
focus in this chapter.
In cases where offenders have been convicted, prosecution have been able 
to discharge their legal and evidentiary burdens: the existence of a series of 
communications between the offender and the victim (i.e. email and text 
messages), the offender knew that he was dealing with a minor, there was 
incriminating evidence of an intention to commit a sexual act with the 
child and the offender has either met the child or travels with the intention 
of meeting the child with the object of engaging in sexual activity. In R v 
Luis Cotilla (2009), the offender contacted an individual (“Charlotte 12”) 
in a chat room entitled “No Adults”. He initiated contact with Charlotte 
12 via an IM facility. The conversations initiated by the offender assumed 
sexual overtones, during which time he expressed his intention to have 
sex with Charlotte 12 and proceeded to describe the intended activity in 
graphic detail. A meeting was subsequently arranged and the offender was 
arrested when he turned up at the pre-arranged venue. In R v CB (2010), the 
offender contacted one of the girls on the social networking site Facebook. 
He sent her a message requesting her to become his “friend”. The girl added 
his name to her site. The offender’s profile indicated his date of birth as 14 
December 1992. They communicated with each other via the IM facility on 
Facebook and the conversations eventually turned to sexual matters. The 
girl showed the offender’s messages to her classmate and they both entered 
into conversations with the offender on Facebook. The offender met with 
the girls at a pre-arranged venue. No sexual activity was, however, engaged 
in during this and at another pre-arranged meeting. These matters came to 
light when the girl complained to her mother, who then alerted the police. 
The offender was convicted under Section 15(1) of the SOA 2003. The fact 
that no sexual activity occurred was held not to be a defence to convic-
tion under this section. The case of R v Mohammad (2006), even though 
not strictly an online sexual grooming incident, serves to illustrate the

74 Online Child Safety
pre-emptive value of Section 15. The offender in this case was a security 
guard on a building site. Local schoolgirls regularly hung around this site, 
and it transpires that some of them approached the offender and engaged 
him in conversations. During one of these meetings, the offender was intro-
duced to the complainant, aged 13. Both the offender and the complainant 
developed a friendship and they subsequently exchanged telephone num-
bers. Over a three-month period, the relationship between the offender 
and the complainant progressed to an intimate level. At the trial of the 
offender, no evidence was produced of sexual activity having taken place 
between the complainant and the offender. The offender was, nevertheless, 
convicted for abduction and the offence of meeting with a child following 
sexual grooming. Following an appeal on the sentence handed down by 
the trial judge the Court found no reason to disagree with the decision that 
the accused was guilty under Section 15 of the SOA 2003. It is particularly 
interesting to note that the court held the intervention by law enforcement 
to be timely as the girl (who was in foster care) was deemed to be vulnerable 
to being socialised into accepting that sexual activity with the offender 
as a natural part of their friendship (2006: paragraph 13). It should also 
be made clear that even though the process of sexual grooming may not 
be advanced sufficiently to warrant a Section 15 prosecution, it does not 
preclude law enforcement from charging the individual with other sexual 
offences against minors if appropriate. For example, a perpetrator could be 
prosecuted for non-contact offences like causing a child to watch a sexual 
act, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity or engaging in a sexual 
activity in the presence of a child. R v H (2010) is an apt illustration of 
the alternative charges that may be made against an offender suspected 
of grooming a child for sexual activity. The perpetrator, in the course of 
grooming a child, committed a series of sexual offences, namely, those of 
engaging in sexually obscene behaviour, causing or initiating a child to 
engage in sexual activity contrary to Section 10(1) of the SOA 2003 and 
having indecent photos of a child contrary to Section 1(1) of the Protection 
of Children Act (PCA) 1978. The defendant’s modus operandi was to wait in 
a car parked close to a phone booth. When girls aged 12 to 15 passed by, he 
rang the phone from his mobile. On occasions when the girls did answer 
the phone, he engaged in conversations and obtained their mobile phone 
numbers. He offered the girls payment and gifts when they responded to 
his sexual requests.
The criminal law does not absolve an adult from adhering to its stand-
ards even when the suggestion to engage in sexual activity is initiated by 
the child. A case that highlights the standards of behaviour expected from 
adults is R v Walker (2007). The accused worked in a public library, and 
entered into conversations with four girls at the venue. The girls were below 
the age of 16 years. As their friendships developed, the girls initiated a meet-
ing with the accused at his flat. On one occasion at the flat, the accused was

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 75
invited to kiss one of the girls, and the invitation was accepted. The accused 
then proceeded to kiss the other girls and as the evening progressed, the 
parties engaged in several overt sexual activities. The accused was convicted 
not only of meeting a child consequent to sexual grooming (Section 15 of 
the SOA 2003), but also for the offences of causing or inciting a child to 
engage in sexual activity (Section 10 of the SOA 2003); engaging in sexual 
activity in the presence of a child (Section 11 of the SOA 2003) and sexual 
activity with a child (Section 9 of the SOA 2003).
How does the online environment affect the standard setting role of the 
criminal law, particularly where the interactions between the parties are 
mediated through ICTs and affordances? This is a relevant question with 
regard to the application of the law where the parties, as a general rule, do 
not have face-to-face interactions. For example, an adult may pretend to be 
a minor and register false details on a social networking site to gain access 
to children within this age group. Some children may be unaware of these 
risks or may themselves deliberately conceal their ages with the aim of mak-
ing contact with adults. R v Costi (2006) illustrates the protective role of 
Section 15(1) of the SOA 2003 in the online context. The offender in this 
case engaged in a conversation with a girl, aged 14, in an Internet chat room. 
He told her that he was aged 20 years, and the complainant informed him 
that she was aged 12. At the offender’s request, the complainant exposed 
herself on her webcam and masturbated herself. Following these activities, 
the offender arranged to meet up with the girl and sent his photograph to 
her. He did not turn up for the pre-arranged meeting. The girl informed 
her mother, who in turn contacted the police. The offender was charged 
and convicted on one count of causing or inciting a female child under 
16 to engage in sexual activity (Section 10 of the SOA 2003) in addition to 
Section 15(1) of the SOA 2003. Clearly, the interactions, the extent of the 
non-contact sexual activity and the plan to meet the child at a pre-arranged 
venue were deemed to be sufficient for the court to hold that the grooming 
offence had been committed. Some may argue that the offence is not widely 
constructed, and consequently recourse should be had to Sections 14 or 62 
of the SOA 2003. Section 14 of the SOA 2003 provides that a person is guilty 
of the offence of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex 
offence, but only if two conditions are met:
 (i)  he intentionally arranges or facilitates something that he intends to 
do, and
(ii)  doing it will involve the commission of an offence under any of 
Sections 9 to 13.
In addition to Section 14, Section 62 of the SOA 2003 provides that an of-
fender can be prosecuted if he does an act which is regarded as being more 
than merely preparatory to the commission of the offences under Part 1 of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

76 Online Child Safety
the legislation (Section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and R v Jones 
(2007)). On this line of reasoning, an appropriate charge of attempting to 
commit a Section 15 offence could be considered if the accused had commu-
nicated to the child details of the meeting place (Shivpuri). Two points should 
be noted by way of response to these claims. First, Section 15 of the SOA 2003 
creates an inchoate offence and permits intervention even in cases where the 
accused does not carry out the intention to arrange or facilitate the carry-
ing out of relevant child sex offences. Should an individual terminate the 
relationship at step 3 (i.e. O’Connell’s cycle of victimisation) it appears that 
Section 15 of the SOA 2003 would have fulfilled its deterrent role. Second, 
Section 62 of the SOA 2003 may appear to be an attractive proposition, until 
we recognise that the early intervention permitted by Section 15 is concerned 
with attempts to engage in some form of sexual activity with a child. To sug-
gest otherwise would be tantamount to holding that one can be prosecuted 
for attempting to commit an inchoate offence – whatever that might entail. 
A more immediate and relevant concern is whether the absence of knowledge 
that the accused knew he was interacting with a minor is relevant for the 
purposes of the legislation. It is an issue that has been addressed by courts in 
a number of jurisdictions. As a general rule, in the offline world there is no 
real difficulty in determining the circumstances when an adult should be put 
on notice – wilful blindness is not a basis for running the defence of reason-
able belief that the child was 16 years old or above. The question of whether 
the offender entertained a reasonable belief that a child was 16 years of age 
or older is a question of fact and is a matter for the jury. Some indication as 
to how such online interactions can be brought within the ambit of the SOA 
2003 can be inferred from the Attorney General’s Reference (No. 29 of 2008) 
R v D (2008). The complainant met the offender (aged 19) in an Internet chat 
room. The complainant stated her age on her chat room profile as 20, even 
though she was only aged 11. The offender believed the complainant to be 20 
years old. As their online relationship progressed, sexually explicit messages 
were exchanged, and at the request of the offender, the complainant sent 
him a nude photograph of herself. Some time later, the complainant revealed 
her true age to the offender. Despite the disclosure of this fact, the offender 
continued to communicate with the minor. They subsequently met but did 
not engage in penetrative sex. The complainant later informed her parents 
about the offender, and the police were subsequently alerted. The offender 
was arrested and charged with various offences under the SOA 2003. The 
court accepted evidence showing that the complainant was complicit in the 
online interactions and meetings. The court, however, held that an adult was 
put on notice of potential criminal liability as soon as he was made aware that 
the individual he was dealing with was a minor:
The basic problem in this case is that the law exists, not only to protect 
children from the baleful, damaging influence of adults with a sexual

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 77
interest in children, but also because the law acknowledges the reality 
that some children, even children as young as 11 years of age, need pro-
tection from themselves. (2008: paragraph 35)
It may be useful to briefly examine the parallels between Section 15 of the 
SOA 2003 similar substantive provisions in jurisdictions like the United 
States, Canada and Australia and jurisdictions like in the United States, 
Canada and Australia.
The United States: 18 USCA § 2422
The relevant anti-sexual grooming Federal Law can be found in 18 USCA  
§ 2422. For example, under § 2422 (a) a person who “knowingly persuades, 
induces, entices, or coerces any individual who has not attained the age of 
18 years, to engage in prostitution or any sexual activity” will be prosecuted. 
When prosecuting an offender for the offence under § 2422 (b) it must be 
shown that the individual has used a communication tool and has “know-
ingly” persuaded, induced, enticed or coerced an individual below the age 
of 18 to engage in sexual activity or prostitution. The section does not pre-
scribe the presence of two communications and like the Proposed Directive 
(Article 6) requires evidence indicating some form of communication which 
indicates enticement, inducement, persuasion or coercion. Additionally, the 
protection is afforded to all children below the age of 18 years.
There are two issues raised by the anti-grooming provision that could be 
explored here: is there a need for the accused to entice a “real child” and what 
is the scope of the “reasonable belief” defence? Some answers to the issues were 
provided in US v D’Amelio (2009). The offender engaged in an online conversa-
tion with a child (“MaryinNYC1991”) in an America Online (AOL) chat room. 
Mary’s online personal profile indicated that she was 12 years old. The perpet-
rator engaged in a wide range of sexual discussions both online and over the 
telephone, and he subsequently met with Mary (a female police officer). The 
offender was charged and successfully prosecuted under § 2422 for enticing 
a minor. The Court held that the online and offline communications repre-
sented a “single course of conduct – one designed, under the Government’s 
theory of the case, to gain the trust of a child and convince her to meet the de-
fendant in person, so he could lure her into a secluded place for the purpose of 
engaging in sexual conduct” (Id. 243). The Court ruled that the absence of an 
actual victim was not fatal to a conviction if evidence produced showed that 
the offender believed he was enticing a minor to engage in criminal sexual 
activity and took preparatory steps to induce a minor to engage in sexual ac-
tivity. Another example of how the criminal law can be used to deter individu-
als from engaging in such forms of sexual exploitation activity is US v Cote 
(2007). The offender in this case entered a chat room named “# O!!!!!!!!! young-
girlsex”. The chat room was set up as a fantasy forum for young girls and those 
who loved them. Whilst in the chat room, the offender met “lil’mary” (Mary)
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

78 Online Child Safety
and he managed to persuade her to enter into a private conversation in a sep-
arate chat room. Mary described herself as “14f chgo” (14-year-old female 
from Chicago). Cote sent Mary a photograph of himself. Mary replied to his 
email and sent a picture of a young blonde on a bicycle. They then engaged 
in a series of conversations of both a sexual and graphic character. Eventually, 
the conversation turned to organising a face-to-face meeting in Chicago. The 
accused was charged and convicted under § 2422 (b) as he was deemed to 
have satisfied all the elements of the offence including that concerning his 
knowledge of the age of the victim. The attempt to rely on the defence of mis-
taken belief (since he was actually dealing with a police officer) was rejected. 
The Court held that § 2422 created an inchoate offence, and consequently, 
the only legal issue to be addressed was whether the “defendant specifically 
intend to induce, entice or coerce a minor” (2007: 687). Two observations can 
be made. First, the court made it clear that the inchoate offence did not require 
an actual child to have been solicited – for a crime to be committed under 
the section, prosecution had to adduce evidence showing that the accused, 
in doing what he did, believed that he was dealing with a minor. Second, an 
accused will be deemed to have “knowingly” induced or enticed a minor if his 
actions were founded on knowledge and awareness of the consequences of his 
conduct, and that the outcome was not the result of mistake or accident. This 
last aspect was addressed in US v Myers (2009). The accused entered an Internet 
chat room and met a user (“stephanieboyd1994”) who described herself as a 
14-year-old female. During one of the chat room conversations an oversight 
led to stephanieboyd1994’s screen name being changed to “Kim Wilson”. The 
accused appeared not to have noticed the change and continued to engage 
with Kim Wilson as he had with stephanieboyd1994. The following is an ex-
tract of the conversation between the two parties after the inadvertent change 
in the screename:
Todd Myers: 
So I can come down like next Tuesday if you wanna see me
Kim Wilson: 
k
Kim Wilson: 
What time?
Todd Myers: 
Well is there anyway you can be home alone all day?
Kim Wilson: 
I can skip [school] if your 4 real
Todd Myers: 
Yes I am
Todd Myers: 
Will u be home all day alone?
Kim Wilson: 
Can be
The conversation then turned to graphic accounts of the anticipated sexual 
encounter, during which time Kim’s (and not stephanieboyd1994’s) age was 
introduced. The following day the offender travelled to meet Kim at the 
pre-arranged destination. Whilst on the way to the venue he sent a series of 
texts to Kim. The offender was arrested at the pre-arranged venue and was 
found with condoms and a digital camera. During the trial the offender

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 79
claimed that at all times he knew that the person he was chatting with in 
the chat room was not a minor. The Court had to address two issues at the 
trial – entrapment and the offence of knowingly enticing a minor for sexual 
activity. We will focus on the latter issue for the purposes of the present 
discussion. The Court held that from a review of the chat logs there was 
very little suggestion that the offender was disinclined to engage in sexual 
activity with a minor had the opportunity presented itself. Particular refer-
ence was made to the fact that the offender met Stephanie in a romance chat 
room, that he was aware a minor was involved and that he was disposed 
to engaging in sexually explicit conversations. Notwithstanding that the 
second chat conversation was with an individual using the pseudonym – 
Kim, rather than stephanieboyd1994 – the offender was found to have initi-
ated the discussions about engaging in sexual activity and was the person 
who initiated the discussion regarding a face-to-face meeting, despite being 
informed that Kim was a minor. When viewed together with a four-minute 
video sent to Kim, of himself engaging in acts of sexual self-gratification, 
the Court concluded that a reasonable jury would have found that there was 
an attempt to entice a minor to engage in sexual activity.
Australia: Various territorial competences
Another jurisdiction where the criminal laws have been instrumental in 
dealing with online sexual solicitation is Australia. It is worth pointing out 
that in Australia, the Commonwealth, States and Territories assume respon-
sibility for child sexual abuse and exploitation at varying levels of involve-
ment. As a general rule, in relation to child sexual abuse and exploitation 
issues, States and Territories assume a direct role in dealing with incidents 
at a domestic level. The Commonwealth’s responsibility covers the offences 
that take place across all Australian jurisdictions and beyond. An individual 
can be effectively charged for grooming or grooming-related offences under 
Commonwealth, State and Territory legislation (Griffith et al., 2007: 36; 
Kim-Kwang, 2009: 50–1). The use by law enforcement of sting operations 
is a good example of securing compliance with appropriate standards of be-
haviour towards children in the online environment. Like the case in Myers 
(discussed previously), in R v Gedling (2007) the offender attempted to argue 
that prosecution was under a legal and evidentiary burden to prove beyond 
reasonable doubt that he knew that the person he was communicating with 
was a “child” or that he did not have an honest and reasonable belief and, 
consequently, that he communicated with the intent to procure a child to 
engage in, or submit to, sexual activity contrary to Section 63B(3)(a) of the 
Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935. This attempt by the defence to re-
define the substantive elements of the offence was rejected by the Court. 
Judge Millsteed stated unequivocally that the substantive elements of the 
offence did not include disproving the offender’s honest and reasonable be-
lief, nor the requirement of proving that the offender knowingly procured a 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

80 Online Child Safety
real “child” below the legal age of consent to engage in or submit to sexual 
activity. He suggested that the imposition of these substantive requirements 
on prosecution “would undermine Parliament’s intention to protect chil-
dren from sexual exploitation through the Internet and other mediums of 
communication” (paragraph 53).
Section 218A of the Criminal Code 1899
Section 218A(1) creates two specific offences. First, the use by an adult of 
electronic communications with the intent to procure a person under the 
age of 16 years, or a person the adult believes is under the age of 16 years, to en-
gage in a sexual act, either in Queensland or elsewhere. A child is regarded 
as being procured when a person is knowingly enticed or recruited for the 
purposes of sexual exploitation (section 218A(1)). Non-contact sexual acts 
are sufficient to trigger the relevant section. Section 218A(9) provides the 
offender with a defence to a charge under this provision if evidence shows 
that he believed on reasonable grounds that the person was at least 16 years 
old. Section 218A(8) creates a rebuttable presumption where evidence is 
provided
that the person was represented to the adult as being under the age of 16 
years, or 12 years, as the case may be, is, in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, proof that the adult believed the person was under that age.
It is critical, however, for the offence under Section 218A(1) that prosecu-
tion discharges its legal and evidentiary burdens with regard to the age of 
the person. It is not open to a judge to direct a jury on the basis of the re-
buttable presumption under Section 218A(8), thereby absolving prosecution 
from establishing that the offender intended to procure a person whom he 
believed to be below 16 years of age. This point was further elaborated by 
the Supreme Court of Queensland in R v Shetty when it stated that “s 218A(8) 
does not alter the position that the jury must be satisfied that the accused 
had the belief essential to establish a contravention of s 218A(1)” (2005: 
paragraph 26).
The Crimes Act 1990 (ACT)
The communications which are deemed to constitute violations of the crim-
inal law include those which aim to procure or incite the child to engage in 
sexual activity (Section 66), acts which are preparatory to the offender en-
gaging in sexual activity with the child and depravation or corruption of the 
child through exposure to indecent or illegal material. For example, Section 
66(1) of the Crimes Act 1990 (ACT) criminalises the use of the Internet and 
interactive technologies like email, chat rooms, SMS messages and audio-
visual web streaming technology to “suggest to a young person that the 
young person commit or take part in, or watch someone else committing 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 81
or taking part in, an act of a sexual nature”. The rationale for criminalis-
ing this type of conduct, as observed previously, is aimed at assisting law 
enforcement in preventing the child from being groomed for actual abuse 
or exploitation. Unlike Section 15 of the SOA 2003 this provision does not 
stipulate the number of communications that should have been entered 
into before the criminal law intervenes. Additionally, the use of the word 
“suggest” appears to provide law enforcement with the flexibility in draw-
ing on a range of communications, which extend the scope of the conduct 
prohibited by the criminal law. Liability can arise as soon as the prohibited 
communication is made to a minor below the age of 16 years. The con-
sent of the minor to the suggestion or the agreement to receiving the ma-
terial either directly or by accessing from a separate source is not a defence 
(Section 66(4)).
In New South Wales, for example, Section 66EB creates offences of pro-
curing and grooming a child for unlawful sexual activity. “Grooming” 
is deemed to take place as soon as an adult “engages in any conduct that 
exposes a child to indecent material or provides a child with an intoxi-
cating substance, and (b) who does so with the intention of making it easier 
to procure the child for unlawful sexual activity with that or any other 
person” (Section 66EB(3)). In R v Asplund, Kenneth (2010), the offender used 
an Internet chat room to initiate a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl 
whose online profile was “Aussie Girl”. The District Court held that the 
graphic sexual conversations and the exchange of indecent material (both 
suggestive and explicit) through mobile phone and SMS/multimedia was 
evidence of “his fantasies of sexual activity with Aussie Girl, morphed into 
an intention to have sexual intercourse with her in one or more of the forms 
that that term is used in the Crimes Act 1900” (paragraph 12).
The Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995
The Commonwealth Criminal Code 1995 provides another example of the 
role of the criminal law in enabling law enforcement to intervene at the 
earliest possible opportunity when steps are taken to engage a child in sexual 
activity. Section 474.25 specifically states that the use of a carriage service to 
“groom” a minor below 16 years of age is a criminal offence. The substantive 
elements of the offence are the use by the sender (18 years of age) of a car-
riage service to transmit a communication to the person; communication 
sent with the intention of making it easier to procure the person to engage 
in sexual activity with the sender and the individual being someone who 
is, or who the sender believes to be, under 16 years of age. Procurement can 
take place where an individual embarks on a course of conduct to entice 
or recruit a minor for the purposes of sexual activity. Section 474.25A also 
creates the offence of using a carriage service to transmit indecent commu-
nication to person under 16 years of age or who the sender believes to be 
under 16 years of age. An “indecent” communication is to be determined by 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

82 Online Child Safety
reference to the standards of ordinary people. The section also applies where 
the child engages in sexual activity with other persons as a consequence of 
the encounter with the offender. In relation to both offences under the sec-
tion, there is a general defence available to the offender; to avoid a criminal 
prosecution, the offender must offer evidence showing that the presence 
of the child was inadvertent and that there was no intention to “derive 
gratification from the presence of the child during that activity” (Section 
474.25A (4)). The offender can avoid the charge if he shows that he believed 
that the child was not under the age of 16 years. The offence of grooming 
seems to be worded in a way that makes prosecution relatively easier. The 
Explanatory Memorandum, for example, states that Sections 474.26–9 aim 
to deal with preparatory steps undertaken by adults to exploit children for 
their sexual gratification (Table 3.4).
Canada: Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c. C-46
Finally, policymakers in Canada have also enacted legislation criminal-
ising online sexual solicitation of minors. “Luring a child” is a criminal 
offence and the relevant law is contained in Section 172.1 of the Criminal 
Code, RSC 1985. Unlike the United Kingdom, the age threshold in Canada 
for consenting to sexual activity is 18 years. There are three age-related 
offences under Section 172.1. First, a person is deemed to have commit-
ted an offence if a computer system is used to communicate with a minor 
who is or who the accused believes is under the age of 18 years old, for 
the purpose of engaging, enticing or procuring sexual activity with that 
minor. Second, where the person is under the age of 16, the use of the 
Table 3.4 Prosecutions and charges in Australia
Before 2007, there were 130 prosecutions for online procuring, grooming and 
exposure offences in Australia.
Between 2008 and 2009, there were
•  two Summary (Charges) and 18 Indictable (Charges) under Section 474.26 
Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) – Using a carriage service to procure persons under 
16 years of age and
•  five Summary (Charges) and 15 Indictable (Charges) under Section 474.27 
Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) – Using a carriage service to “groom” persons under 
16 years of age (CDPP 2010).
Over 150 people were reportedly charged in the financial year 2008–09 with online 
child sex exploitation offences (AFP, 2010, Millar, 2010), and the Commonwealth 
Director of Public Prosecutions also reported prosecuting an increasing number 
of offences involving the online exploitation of children in the financial year 
2008–09 (CDPP, 2010).

communication system to facilitate the commission of acts of indecency 
like exposure to a person of that age, committing an act of bestiality or 
inciting a person of that age to engage in that act, or abducting a person 
of that age, will result in an offence under this section. Finally, where the 
minor is below the age of 14 years, the use of the communication system 
for the specific purpose of facilitating the commission of a specified sec-
ondary offence – that is, abduction or one of the sexual offences mentioned 
in Section 172.1(1)(c) with respect to that person (e.g. invitation to sexual 
touching under Section 152), is deemed to be an offence. In R v Legare (2009) 
the accused was charged and prosecuted for luring a minor under Section 
172.1(1)(c). The offender in this case communicated with the complainant 
in a private online chat room on two occasions. The complainant was 12 
years old at the time of the online interactions. The conversations were of a 
sexual nature, with both parties expressing their desire to engage in sexual 
activity with each other. Both parties did not reveal their true ages during 
these conversations. The accused claimed that he was 17 years old, whilst 
the complainant said she was 13 years of age. They continued to have con-
versations of a sexual nature and the complainant gave the accused her 
phone number. The accused in turn gave her details of his home address. 
During a telephone conversation he expressed his wish to perform oral sex 
on her. There was no actual meeting between the complainant and the of-
fender. When the accused was prosecuted for luring, two arguments were 
put forward as defence – first, that there had been no arrangement made to 
meet the child; and, second, that there had been no intention to lure the 
child as set out in Section 172.1(1)(c). The accused maintained that his sole 
intention and purpose at all times was to only “talk dirty”. The trial judge 
accepted these arguments. Mr Justice Agrios went so far as to admonish 
prosecution’s attempt in arguing that the conversations entered into by 
the accused was in itself evidence of an inchoate offence being committed; 
accordingly he regarded the communications as nothing more than a form 
of “intimate communication [and that] ... some individuals never intend to 
meet the children, but rather intend only to ‘talk dirty’, so to speak. The 
wording of the legislation is clear: the communication must be ‘for the pur-
pose of facilitating the commission of an offence’ “ (R v Legare (2006) para-
graph 11). This line of reasoning appears to distinguish between conduct 
attracting legal censure and those which can be viewed as nothing more 
than what some in society might characterise as morally reprehensible 
conduct. In construing the provisions of Section 172.1(1) (c) as he did, Mr 
Justice Agrios was also making it clear that the formal mechanisms of the 
criminal law could not be used to penalise conduct not expressly prohib-
ited. The court held that it was disingenuous for the prosecution to suggest 
that the building of the trust relationship was capable by itself from being 
regarded as evidence of a crime being committed. On appeal to the Alberta 
Court of Appeal, this part of the court’s ruling was reversed. The Court of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Appeal characterised Mr Justice Agrios’s reasoning as being influenced by 
his view that the legislation required luring to have actually taken place (R 
v Legare (2008)). According to the Court of Appeal, such a construction of 
Section 172.1(1)(c) was overly narrow and overlooked the mischief that the 
Legislature had intended to address. The Court of Appeal concluded that 
it was sufficient if the communications were of a nature designed to gain 
the acquiescence of the child to engage in the secondary conduct set out 
in Section 152. This characterisation of the anti-sexual grooming provision 
appears to attach much greater weight to the risks posed to children from 
adults contacting them online, the sexual nature of the conversations and 
the real possibility that sexual activity might have taken place had the op-
portunity presented itself:
The communication involved sexual dialogue about sexual activity in-
volving them. A trier of fact might find that there was a process of seduc-
tive sexualization and exploitation of the child in the communication 
which would facilitate the commission of an offence under s.151 or s. 152 
with respect to that child and that such facilitation was the respondent’s 
purpose. It is to be borne in mind that the offence under s. 151 or s. 152 
was not particularized in this count. A trier of fact might infer that the 
purpose of the respondent was to facilitate an offence under s. 152 which 
could occur over the Internet. ((2008) paragraph 66)
Indeed, the Court of Appeal seems to regard the “relationship”, “risk assess-
ment” and “sexual” stages as indivisible. Following an appeal by the accused, 
the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with the decision by the Alberta Court 
of Appeal (R v Legare (2009)). The unanimous view of the Supreme Court was 
that the communications between the offender and the victim came within 
the conduct prohibited by Section 172.1(1)(c) since
in this context, “facilitating” includes helping to bring about and making 
easier or more probable – for example, by “luring” or “grooming” young 
persons to commit or participate in the prohibited conduct; by reducing 
their inhibitions; or by prurient discourse that exploits a young person’s 
curiosity, immaturity or precocious sexuality. (2009: paragraph 28)
The case of R v RJS (2010) offers an illustration of the court’s response when 
faced with arguments that the accused was merely engaging in role play or 
that the person was an adult, not a minor. The latter is an argument often 
raised by an accused when charged following a sting operation, which was 
the case here. The accused engaged in sexual conversations with a police of-
ficer who assumed the fictional identity of a 13-year-old child. The observa-
tions of the Court make clear the respective legal and evidentiary burdens 
assumed by the prosecution and defence:
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 85
If I believe the evidence of the accused that he did not believe he was online 
with a minor having these sexually explicit conversations that included an 
invitation to touching, I must acquit the accused. That is not the case. I do 
not accept the evidence of the accused. (2010: paragraph 58)
It is always open for the defence to suggest reasonable belief or, as is the case 
here, that the accused did not believe that he was dealing with a child. It is, 
however, a question of fact, whether in the light of the evidence presented 
that this is an inference which can be legitimately drawn. The approach 
adopted in Legare and RJS illustrates the courts’ awareness of the way adults 
use online communication to express their sexual preferences and even re-
enact their fantasies. However, in both these cases, the courts also seem to 
be indicating that adults need to demonstrate that additional steps have 
been taken to verify that they were not interacting with minors. The im-
position of these legal obligations correspond with the recognition that the 
criminal law has as one of its goals the protection of
young girls against their own immature sexual experimentation and 
to punish much older men who take advantage of them. (R v Mansfield 
(2005) paragraph 19)
Before concluding the discussion on online sexual solicitation, reference 
should also be made to Section 123 of the SOA 2003. An application can 
be made by the police to the magistrates for a “Risk of Sexual Harm Order” 
(RSHO), if there is evidence that an individual has on at least two occasions 
communicated with a child, where sexual matters formed part of the ex-
change. Before an order can be granted, the magistrates must be presented 
with evidence showing that the alleged communications did in fact take 
place and that the grant of the order against the offender is necessary for the 
purpose of protecting children generally or any child from harm. This order 
significantly broadens the scope of the child protection objective of the SOA 
2003. As part of the application, an assessment has to be made of the risk 
an offender is likely to pose to children generally other than the immediate 
child concerned. Given the expansive nature of the order and the discretion 
vested in magistrates, the legislators have imposed some limitations on the 
circumstances when Section 123 applications could be made. For example, 
the police must demonstrate that the child concerned was under the age 
of 16 and that the communication was of a sexual nature. A communica-
tion is sexual if it refers to sexual activity or if a reasonable person would 
regard the description or image sent as being of a sexual nature (Section 
124(6)). One difficulty that may arise in obtaining an RSHO under Section 
123 stems from the references in Section 124(6) and (7) to the exclusion 
of the motives of the individual sending an image or communication that 
relates to sexual activity. The requirement of an objective assessment does 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

86 Online Child Safety
not correspond, for example, with the models of sexual grooming activity; 
the latter gives weight to both context and motive as being an integral aspect 
of assessing the criminality of the communications between the offender 
and the object of his sexual gratification. Surely, the process of reducing 
the child’s inhibitions to sexual activity does not necessarily have to begin 
with explicit descriptions of sexual acts or images of pornographic activity. 
We can, for example, imagine an instance where an online sexual predator 
engages in innocuous communications with a child based on information 
uploaded on the social network account.
Obscene content and child pornography
Search engines, IM, emails, social networking sites and mobile phones now 
provide children with potentially unrestricted access to adult pornography, 
age-inappropriate content like violent online games and literature. Access 
to illegal or harmful content is regarded as accelerating the sexualisation 
of children (Papadopoulos, 2010). Premature sexualisation is felt to in-
crease children’s susceptibility to self-victimisation (e.g. sexting) or increase 
children’s exposure to violence (or pressure to conform with sexual stere-
otypes), sexual grooming and have long-term developmental and psycho-
logical consequences (Sacco, 2010). The ready availability of all forms of 
sexual and age-inappropriate content can also desensitise children to the 
harmful aspects of such material and create addictive behaviours (Quayle, 
2010, 2011). Bryant suggests that increased exposure can also lead to shaping 
and transforming children’s attitudes towards sexual activity, intimacy and 
sexual violence in society (Bryant, 2009: 3–8). Policymakers are also rightly 
concerned that children are now using Web 2.0 technologies to manipulate 
adult pornographic images to victimise peers, or using these tools to engage 
in invasions of privacy or to distribute images taken in locker rooms and 
other venues without regard to the privacy or sensitivities of these indi-
viduals (Powell, 2009). In 2009 the software security provider Symantec 
reported that the words “sex” and “porn” were the most searched words 
by minors, particularly amongst younger children (Norton Online Family, 
2009). Content which is deemed to be inappropriate or potentially harmful 
to children is regulated by the ICT industry or broadcasting and entertain-
ment industries. In the United Kingdom, such issues are addressed by bodies 
like the OfCom Content Board (Section 12(1) of the Communications Act 
2003), the Independent Mobile Classification Body, the British Broadcasting 
Corporation (BBC), the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) and the 
Authority for Television on Demand. Criminal sanctions are applicable to 
illegal content like child abuse images, adult content that violates the ob-
scenity laws, racist materials and terrorism content (R v Sheppard and Whittle 
(2010) and racially inflammatory content posted online. The Internet 
Watch Foundation (IWF) 2010 report also found that child abuse images 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 87
were depicting children of very young ages and the violence increasing in 
severity (IWF, 2010b).
There are a number of rationales informing the role of the criminal law in 
this area of child protection. These include the need to protect children from 
being exploited by those engaged in the Commercial Sexual Exploitation of 
Children (CSEC) industry, the adverse effects on children from inadvertent 
exposure and the threats posed to children by the creation and distribution 
of child abuse content. It is, however, unclear whether there is a relation-
ship between possession of child pornography and actual abuse of children 
(Quayle, 2010). In R v Sharpe (2001) the Court held that
possession of child pornography increases the risk of child abuse. It 
introduces risk, moreover, that cannot be entirely targeted by laws pro-
hibiting the manufacture, publication and distribution of child pornog-
raphy ... Only by extending the law to private possession can these harms 
be squarely attacked. (2001: paragraph 94)
In some instances, individuals distort the seriousness of the exploitation 
by viewing the creation of child abuse images as an acceptable form of be-
haviour. In R v Grant (2009) the offender sought to justify the nude photos 
showing the sexual organs of his four-year-old foster child as ““cute” behav-
iour of a child playing freely” (paragraph 15). Content management strat-
egies in terms of reducing the ready availability and supply of illegal content 
as well as ensuring that children do not access inappropriate content have 
become a priority for policymakers (Livingstone et al. 2011; ACMA, 2009d). 
Increased broadband access and the ready availability of online sexual con-
tent have made policing and enforcing the laws on obscenity (and pornog-
raphy) a logistical challenge. Optenet, a global IT security company, found 
that pornographic content constituted 37 per cent of the overall online con-
tent on websites (Optenet, 2010). It appears from this study that the volume 
and range of content as well as the platforms for accessing such content 
have been steadily rising. Adult content on the Internet was deemed to have 
increased by 17 per cent in the first quarter of 2010, when compared with 
the same time period in 2009. The Director of the Child Protection Projects 
at Optenet remarked on the way children’s increasing use of the Internet 
for games, entertainment and online interaction also contributes to their 
potential exposure to age-inappropriate and harmful content. It was noted 
that there was a “growing trend for online role-playing games to encourage 
negative behavior, by rewarding violent and brutal activities within the on-
line games” (Optenet, 2010).
Indeed, one of the consequences of the end-to-end principle is that con-
tent control through filtering software operates at either the server or the 
user level. Consequently, where the harmful or violent content is not clas-
sified or not covered by the “block list”, these can be accessed through 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

88 Online Child Safety
numerous communication platforms and devices. There are a number of 
legislative rules governing the management of content deemed to pose risks 
to the safety and well-being of children. We will briefly identify and explain 
some of the most common obligations imposed by the law in respect of il-
legal and adult content deemed to be obscene (in so far as they are relevant 
to online child safety governance).
Obscene Publications Act 1959 and 1964
One example of the standard setting role of law in relation to content man-
agement has been the imposition of legal obligations on individuals and 
industry to avoid publishing and distributing content contrary to the pro-
visions of the Obscene Publications Act (OPA) 1959 and 1964. The strategy 
here is a simple one – access to such content can be reduced if the law can 
be used to deter individuals from engaging in the prohibited activity. It 
should, however, be pointed out that digital content cannot be “reduced” 
in the sense that electronic data by nature is a permanent record, which 
can be stored, manipulated, reproduced and disseminated across networks. 
Consequently, the criminal law not only attempts to deter individuals from 
creating new illegal content but it also attempts to prohibit individuals from 
accessing, distributing and possessing existing content. In the remainder of 
this section, we will consider the principal issues raised by the role of the 
law in minimising children’s likely exposure to illegal content.
Possession of obscene content is not a criminal offence, only its publi-
cation, supply, distribution and importation would be caught by the Act 
(Section 2 of the OPA). The fact that obscene content is now accessed via 
the Internet or mobile communication technologies does not prevent the 
application of the OPA. The passing of the Criminal Justice and Public Order 
Act 1994, Section 168(1) and Schedule 9, now subjects online content to 
the OPA. Digital images stored on a computer, which can either be accessed 
through subscription or be freely available on networks, are also covered by 
the Act (R v Sheppard and Whittle (2010)). The type of media that will consti-
tute an “article” for the purposes of the OPA will include any media, which 
contains or embodies matter that can be read or viewed as sounds or film 
(Section 1(2)). Compact discs, memory sticks and videocassettes would also 
be regarded as an “article” for the purposes of Section 1(2) (A-G’s Reference 
(No. 5 of 1980) (1980), R v Fellows, R v Arnold (1997)). Every act of download-
ing the content will constitute an act of publication (R v Waddon (2000). 
The use of “thumbnail” images or text on websites is regarded as an act of 
publication. In R v Perrin (2002), Kennedy LJ stated that publication means 
“the making available of preview material to any viewer who may chose to 
access it” (paragraph 22). In Perrin, the accused published an obscene article 
on a web page. This web page also had a trailer, which provided a preview 
of its contents. The fact that the obscene content is only available on a sub-
scription basis is unlikely to be analogised as a form of “private possession”.

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 89
Ownership, possession or control of obscene content with the aim of mak-
ing a gain from its subsequent distribution would also amount to a violation 
of the criminal law (R v Levy (2004)). The criminal law also continues to 
play an important in ensuring that those who are in the business of pub-
lishing or distributing material contrary to the provisions of the OPA 1959 
are prosecuted. Recently, in R v John Snowden (2009), the accused was pros-
ecuted and convicted under Section 1(2) of the OPA. The police seized DVD 
copying computer equipment and 2,840 pornographic DVDs involving a 
range of obscene content (e.g. animals, urination and coprophilia). These 
materials were found to be in his possession with a view to “publication for 
gain” (Section 2(1) of the OPA). In the digital environment, an electronic 
transmission of obscene articles will now constitute an act of publication. 
The fact that an individual has not seen or accessed the content will not pre-
vent it from being regarded as a form of publication. The legal prohibition 
of publishing obscene content is undoubtedly a curb on the rights to an 
individual’s freedom of expression. Article 10 of the European Convention 
on Human Rights (ECHR) provides that the right to freedom of expression 
shall include the “freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart infor-
mation and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of 
frontiers”. However, Article 10(2) also recognises that curbs on this freedom 
may be necessary in a democratic society “for the prevention of disorder or 
crime, for the protection of health or morals, protection of the reputation or 
rights of other”. In Handyside v UK (1976), it was held that the OPA was not 
incompatible with Article 10(1) as the protection of morals in a democratic 
society was a legitimate aim under Article 10(2).
The final issue to be addressed is the legal characterisation of the con-
tent that is deemed to be obscene. The OPA does not provide a statutory 
definition regarding the type of content that will be regarded as obscene. 
This is ultimately left to the jury to determine. The law, however, provides 
a benchmark by requiring individuals and industry to take into account 
the effect of the publication on the audience likely to be exposed to the 
content. Unlike the offence of sexual solicitation, which focuses on the con-
duct to be sanctioned, the OPA focuses on the effect of the publication on 
persons likely to read or access the content. More specifically, the law will 
regard content as being “obscene” if its publication will tend to deprave and 
corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, 
to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it (Section 1(1) of 
the OPA). One construction of this term is that the content must be of a 
character which will tend “to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are 
open to … immoral influences, and into whose hands a publication of this 
sort may fall” (per Cockburn J in R v Hicklin (1868): 371). Notwithstanding 
the relativity of the term “obscene” it is generally accepted that content 
which is likely to encourage children to commit sexual offences or is likely 
to deprave or corrupt would be covered by the legislation (e.g. simulating 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

rape, graphic mutilation and sadomasochism). Lord Reid observed in Knuller 
(Publishing, Printing and Promotions) Ltd v DPP (1973) that the words “de-
prave” and “corrupt” could be viewed as synonymous and should not be 
construed narrowly to mean sexual or moral depravation (at 456). In John 
Calder (Publications) Ltd v Powell (1965) it was held that the definition of “ob-
scenity” was not limited to publications on sex. This case involved the pub-
lication of a book recounting the life (or a fictitious one) of a drug addict in 
New York. Lord Parker CJ agreed with the decision reached by the Justices, 
namely, that the contents of the book had a tendency to deprave and cor-
rupt and that its negative aspects were outweighed by its possible merits. 
In R v Calder & Boyars Ltd (1969), the Court of Appeal was faced with the 
prospect of adjudicating on the issue of whether a book intended to provoke 
shock and disgust contravened Section 2(1) of the OPA. The Court of Appeal 
was of the view that in any jury direction it was not appropriate for a judge 
to describe obscene content in terms of making “a person behave badly or 
worse than he otherwise would have done, or to blur his perception of the 
difference between good and bad” (ibid: 168). Lord Wilberforce indicated 
in DPP v Whyte (1972) that the OPA was not concerned with addressing 
the effect of the publication taken as a whole on those who are wholly in-
nocent but also those who are less innocent and likely to become addicted 
to the content (paragraph 863B). The ensuing uncertainty regarding the 
nature and scope of “obscene content” perhaps explains why there have 
been very few successful prosecutions under the OPA (R v Anderson (1972)). 
The inherent ambiguity of the phrase also creates problems for parents and 
educators since the criminal law does not prohibit individuals accessing in-
appropriate or potentially harmful content, which is not obscene.
Protection of Children Act 1978
Apart from establishing standards governing the creation and distribu-
tion of obscene content, the law takes a more forceful approach with re-
gard to indecent content comprising minors (Table 3.5). The principal legal 
instrument in England and Wales governing such forms of content is the 
PCA 1978. The UK law does not, however, provide a statutory definition of 
“child pornography”. It may very well be that in the future judges may be 
inclined to adopt a canon of construction that adheres to its Treaty commit-
ments and the measures under the Proposed Directive. Article 2(b) of the 
Proposed Directive expands the scope of “child pornography” in some not-
able respects. First, child pornography content comprises any material that 
visually “depicts” a child in the act of engaging in real or simulated sexually 
explicit conduct. Article 2 does not draw a distinction between a “real”, 
“pseudo” or “virtual” child. Under the Framework Decision 2004/68, child 
pornography was defined narrowly in terms of a “real child” or “realistic 
images of a non-existent child”. The clarification of the type of content that 
would now be considered to be child pornography should promote greater 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 91
consistency in the application and enforcement of national laws in this area. 
In passing, it could be suggested that the phrase “sexually explicit conduct” 
can be understood along the lines defined under the US Federal Law 18 USC 
§ 2256, to include not only any sex act but also lascivious exhibition of the 
genitals or pubic area of any person. Whether a particular image or descrip-
tion would be regarded as such is a matter for the trier of fact. In US v Dost 
(1986) it was observed that six factors could be used to determine whether 
the exhibition of the genitals or pubic area was “lascivious”: (1) whether 
the focal point of the picture is on the minor’s genitals or pubic area; (2) 
whether the setting of the picture is sexually suggestive; (3) whether the 
minor is depicted in unnatural poses or inappropriate attire considering the 
minor’s age; (4) whether the minor is fully or partially clothed or is nude; 
(5) whether the picture suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage 
in sexual activity; and (6) whether the image is intended to elicit a sexual 
response in the viewer ((1986) 828, 832).
Second, content will be regarded as child pornography even if the 
person depicted is not a child. The content will be deemed to be illegal 
if the person concerned is engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit 
conduct, or if the sexual organs of the person appearing to be a child 
is depicted for primarily sexual purposes. Finally, the Proposed Directive 
also covers content created through software tools or technologies, which

depicts “realistic images of a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct 
or realistic images of the sexual organs of a child, regardless of the actual 
existence of such child, for primarily sexual purposes”. The governance 
challenges in policing and enforcing legal standards and norms are con-
siderable. The US House of Representatives report indicated that the com-
mercial sexual exploitation industry is a multi-billion industry (House of 
Representatives, 1998: 1–2).
Section 1 of the PCA focuses on an “indecent photograph” of a child. 
Under the section, it is an offence to possess an indecent photograph of 
a person under 18, whether or not they look older than they actually are. 
Section 45(2) of the SOA 2003 amends Section 7(6) of the PCA 1978, which 
now defines a “child” as a person below the age of 18. These changes have 
been introduced to reflect the government’s commitment to its various 
international obligations, including those under the UNCRC and the 
European Framework Decision. Before the amendment, the relevant age 
was 16. The question whether the child is below the age of 18 years is one 
of fact and will require an objective assessment of the image deemed to be 
illegal (R v Land (1998)). With regard to the practice of “sexting” (see later), 
Section 1A of the PCA states that the making or possession of a photograph 
of a child over 16 is not an offence if at the time of the charge the accused 
and the child were either married or cohabiting. Recent amendments to 
the legislation also reflect the role of the criminal law in keeping abreast 
of emerging trends in the supply of and demand for extreme pornography. 
The UK government, for example, made amendments to the principal pro-
visions dealing with this category of content in Section 1 of the PCA 1978 
and Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act (CJA) 1988. Whilst it reasonably 
clear that the law criminalises activities like the creation, possession and 
distribution of indecent images of real children being sexually exploited, 
advances in technology and software tools have also led to a proliferation 
of computer-generated images which depict children in the act of being 
sexually abused. In a number of instances, graphics software have been 
used to copy photographs of women and men from the adult entertain-
ment industry and these in turn have been manipulated so that the images 
appear to depict to a viewer minors engaged in sexual activity. It could be 
argued that as these are images of adults, the standards under child pro-
tection legislation should not be applied in this context, as images of real 
children are not used. As we can see from both Article 2 of the Proposed 
Directive and Section 1 of the PCA, such an argument will not be open as 
a defence to the charge under the legislation. It is true that one of the justi-
fications traditionally offered in criminalising the production and posses-
sion of indecent images of children is the harm perpetrated on the children 
during the creation of the images and the subsequent trauma inflicted on 
them as they either live with the knowledge of the abuse or regard sexual 
exploitation as a normal part of childhood. The so-called “tarts and vicars”

defence, will similarly be unavailable, following the amendments intro-
duced by Section 160(4) of the CJA 1988, which addresses child sexual 
exploitative activities involving “pseudo-photographs” of a child. “Pseudo-
photograph” for the purposes of the legislation will include images, whether 
made by computer graphics or otherwise howsoever, which appear to be 
a photograph (Gillespie, 2010). The extension of legal standards to cover 
“pseudo-photographs” would seem to be consistent with the protective role 
of the criminal law. As the preamble to the PCA 1978 makes apparent, the 
aim of child protection legislation is to prevent the exploitation of chil-
dren by making indecent photographs of them; and to deter and penalise 
those engaged in the distribution, showing and advertisement of such in-
decent photographs. In R v Harrison (2007), Cranston J remarked that the 
policy behind the Act was clear, namely, to reduce or eliminate demand 
for the type of content which contributed to normalising the exploitation 
and degradation of children. A “pseudo-photograph” will be regarded as 
one form of normalising the commercial sexual degradation of children 
“if the impression conveyed by a pseudo-photograph is that the person 
shown is a child”. It is the dominant impression conveyed that is the key to 
determining whether the pseudo-photograph is one, which comes within 
the scope of the PCA 1978. The fact that some of the physical characteris-
tics of the child in the pseudo-photograph are those of an adult will not 
prevent the photograph from contravening Section 7(8) of the PCA 1978. 
What is covered under the term “pseudo-photograph” can be problematic, 
particularly where the child’s age in the fictional depiction creates only an 
impression but not a dominant one. Except in the clearest of cases where 
the fictional depiction is one of pre-pubescent children, it is difficult to see 
law enforcement using these new legislative reforms to full effect. Once it 
has been determined that the photograph is an indecent image of a child 
covered by the 1978 Act, the exploitative activities which are criminalised 
include publication, distribution, taking and possession with a view to dis-
tributing such content.
Elements of the offence
Prosecution has the legal and evidentiary burden in respect of the following 
elements for each type of offence:
a. The defendant deliberately and/or knowingly either made, took, or per-
mitted to be taken, distributed or showed indecent photographs or pseu-
do-photographs, or possessed them with a view to their being distributed

A “photograph” will now include films, or a copy of a photograph or film, 
computer data and any form of video recording. In R v Fellows (2007), the 
Court of Appeal adopted a purposive construction to the 1978 Act when it 
held that a “photograph” would include images or data stored on a computer 
disc. Following the amendment introduced by Section 84 of the Criminal 
Justice and Public Order Act 1994 the definition of photograph will include 
“data stored on a computer disc or by other electronic means which is cap-
able of conversion into a photograph”. The question whether the photo-
graph is indecent, as noted above, is a matter for the jury (R v Owen (1988), R 
v Graham-Kerr (John) (1988)). The latter case illustrates the difficulties some 
judges have previously encountered when directing juries on this issue. The 
accused was charged with taking indecent photographs of a minor contrary 
to Section 1(1)(a) of the PCA 1978. The facts leading to the charge can be 
briefly recounted. The public baths, which provided the setting for the inci-
dent, was used by a naturist organisation for a private event not open to the 
public. The accused at some stage during this event approached the parents 
of the complainant, informing them that he was a swimming instructor 
and offered to teach the child to swim. The parents consented to this. There 
was no ill motive or impropriety, and nothing untoward took place during 
the swimming instruction. The organisers of this event also had in place an 
official photographer for those who wished to have their photos taken. The 
accused obtained the parents’ permission to have a photograph taken by 
the official photographer, and some were indeed taken. However, without 
obtaining separate consent from the parents, the accused proceeded to take 
some frontal and rear photographs of the child. One question that emerged 
before the trial was whether the circumstances leading to the taking of the 
photograph were relevant and hence admissible evidence. The trial judge 
ruled that these factors were indeed relevant and therefore admissible, in-
cluding the motive of the accused when taking the photos. Following this 
ruling, evidence based on the accused’s answers to the police during inter-
view regarding his motives when taking the photograph of the children 
were admitted and more specifically the following exchange was recounted 
in court:
‘ “Q. Do you find (the boy) particularly attractive? A. Yes.” A little later: 
“Q. Do you receive or enjoy sexual gratification by taking or looking at 
such photographs? A. Yes.” ’ (1988: 1000)
The accused was convicted and appealed. Stocker LJ cited with approval the 
decision of the Court in R v Stamford (John David) (1972) when ruling that 
the trial judge’s admission of extrinsic evidence was erroneous. The Court 
of Appeal stated that the question whether the photograph was indecent 
had to be determined objectively, and could not include a consideration of 
whether “right-thinking people would regard as indecent, the motivation 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

of the original taker” (1988: 1104). In R v O’Carroll (2003) it was stressed 
that the image had to be looked at objectively when determining whether 
it was in fact indecent. It should not be based on the subjective opinions 
of the jury (R v Stephen Neal (2011)). Furthermore, in R v Oliver and Others 
(2002) the Court of Appeal noted that “neither nakedness in a legitimate 
setting, nor the surreptitious procuring of an image, gives rise, of itself, to 
a pornographic image” (paragraph 10). This would appear to be the current 
position of UK law (R v Murray (Arthur Alan) (2004)). Finally, in R v Nicklass 
(Karl Christopher) (2006), it was made clear that the test of indecency should 
not be equated with “contemporary standards and modesty and privacy” 
(paragraph 12).
The issue of when an individual is deemed to be “making” an indecent 
image has been the subject of judicial deliberations. One view is that the 
requirement of “making” an indecent image is satisfied if the individual is 
deemed to have produced or brings a photograph into existence. The pro-
hibited conduct will also extend to individuals who develop negatives. In R 
v Bowden (2000) the Court of Appeal held that in view of the policy behind 
the law, downloading an image from the Internet would also constitute the 
act of “making” an image. The accused in this case was a teacher, who was 
charged with downloading indecent images of children from the Internet. 
These images were stored on a computer disc and printed out on paper. The 
Court of Appeal observed that
the words “to make” must be given their natural and ordinary mean-
ing. In this context this is “to cause to exist; to produce by action, to 
bring about” (Oxford English Dictionary). As a matter of construction 
such a meaning applies not only to original photographs but, by virtue 
of Section 7, also to negatives, copies of photographs and data stored on 
computer disk. (2000: 444)
This approach can be justified on the grounds that the criminal law aims 
to enforce its child protection goals by seeking to deter individuals from 
fuelling the market for supply and consumption of indecent photographs 
of children or printing them. Additionally, the opening of an attachment 
in an email containing a child’s photograph would be construed as “mak-
ing” for the purposes of the Act (R v Smith, R v Jayson (2002)). In the joined 
appeals of R v Smith and R v Jayson (2000) the Court of Appeal elaborated on 
the scope of the offence of “making” an indecent image of a child. In this 
case, evidence was produced showing that the accused browsed a number 
of child pornography websites, and in the process downloaded images from 
the browser, which enabled these to be viewed on the computer screen. The 
Court of Appeal held that a deliberate act of accessing content constituted 
a “making” of these images (2000: paragraph 33). The issue of what consti-
tutes “possession” in respect of materials downloaded from websites and 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

96 Online Child Safety
stored on a computer may raise doubts as to the scope of the type of con-
duct, which can be sanctioned by the law. When determining whether an 
individual can be held liable for being in possession of illegal child abuse 
material, the law requires prosecution to prove that the accused was in con-
trol or in custody of the relevant content (R v Porter (2006)). It is not open 
to a court, however, to invite a jury to draw an adverse inference by the 
mere fact that the accused was in possession of a computer which con-
tained the prohibited image (R v James McNamara (1988)). Evidence must be 
produced, for example, which shows that the accused was aware of the ex-
istence of the illegal images on his computer (Atkins v DPP, Goodland v DPP 
(2000)). As the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) stated in R v Ping Chen 
Cheung (2009), it is incumbent on prosecution to show not only the fact 
that the accused was in physical possession or control of the computer 
which had the offending item but that he had knowledge of the existence 
of the indecent images of children on the machine. The question of what 
constitutes relevant culpable knowledge was considered in Atkins v DPP 
(2000), where the accused was charged, amongst others, with the offence of 
being in “possession” of child pornography. The accused had saved in-
decent child abuse images from sites that he had visited onto a directory in 
his computer. The computer programme automatically saved images from 
other websites the accused had visited in the temporary Internet cache. An 
important feature of online browsing is that the browser automatically 
stores the information in a temporary cache of recently viewed documents. 
When an individual wishes to revisit the site, the browser accesses the in-
formation in the temporary cache to speed up the connection to the web-
site. This document folder is only emptied when it becomes full. The 
accused was charged for possession of these contents under the PCA 1978. 
Law enforcement retrieved the illegal content through a forensic process 
and submitted these as incriminating evidence. One question addressed by 
the High Court on an appeal was whether the images retrieved through the 
forensic process could be regarded as evidence of the accused being in pos-
session of indecent images of children. The defence argued that to hold the 
accused liable for possession would be tantamount to regarding constructive 
notice of the functioning of the computer’s temporary Internet cache (i.e. 
automatically storing the indecent images from the websites he visited) as 
being sufficient to ground criminal liability. Consequently, it was suggested 
that without direct knowledge, the accused should not be found liable for 
possessing indecent child abuse images at the time of the charge. The High 
Court appears to have accepted this argument – the offence of possession 
cannot be committed if an accused has no knowledge of the temporary 
cache storing these images. It seems from this ruling that visiting websites 
which contain child abuse images would not be sufficient for a charge of 
possession under the Act. If the lack of awareness regarding the availability 
of the images being accessed from the temporary folder could prove 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 97
decisive, the same could not be said, however, with regard to being in pos-
session of child sexual abuse material received as an attachment via email. 
In R v Smith and R v Jayson (2002), the first accused’s “inbox” contained an 
email with attachments containing indecent photographs of children. The 
accused argued that the email containing the attachment was unsolicited 
and that his viewing of the contents was inadvertent. Prosecution disputed 
this claim and offered supporting circumstantial evidence disclosing an 
email exchange between the first accused and an unidentified email cor-
respondent where indecent images were being solicited. The court held that 
the first accused was correctly charged and convicted under the offence of 
making an indecent image of a child, contrary to Section 1(1)(a) of the 1978 
Act, or being in possession of the indecent image contrary to Section 160(1) 
of the 1988 Act, as he was deemed to have known the likely content in the 
attachment to the email (2002: paragraph 20). R v Harrison (2007) raises an 
interesting issue relating to the circumstances when an accused can be held 
to be in possession of indecent images of children. The accused was con-
victed of possessing indecent photographs of a child below the age of 16. 
The appellant admitted that he visited pornographic websites and was 
aware that these sites contained “pop ups” of illegal images. He, however, 
claimed that he was not aware that the images from the “pop ups” would 
be stored on his computer’s hard drive. The Court of Appeal did not accept 
this line of argument nor the evidence adduced in support his claim. 
Interestingly, it seems that the offence of possession will be committed if 
evidence is offered, which shows that the accused knew about the auto-
matic “pop up” activity when accessing the pornographic website and was 
aware that by accessing these sites there was a likelihood that these images 
would be stored on the computer. One final issue remains to be considered: 
can an accused be convicted for possession of indecent child abuse content 
stored in the “recycle bin”, when these are deleted prior to being charged 
under the PCA? One view is that the deletion of the files prevents the 
accused from being able to access the content and therefore should not be 
found guilty for being in possession of the indecent images of children. A 
competing argument offered is that the deletion of the files should not 
make a significant difference to a successful prosecution if the illegal con-
tent can still be accessed from the hard drive albeit by someone using 
sophisticated retrieving technology. These arguments formed the basis of 
the issues addressed in R v Porter (2006). The accused was charged with a 
number of counts of possessing indecent images of children, and, rather 
curiously, with possession of material that had been deleted on the day the 
computer was seized by law enforcement. The Court of Appeal’s ruling sug-
gests that such issues can be addressed by providing answers to three ques-
tions. The first question that has to be determined is whether the accused 
has physical possession in the sense of having custody and control over the 
contents. Second, if the answer to this question is that he has no control, 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

98 Online Child Safety
because these have been deleted and emptied from the recycle bin, the 
accused will not be regarded as being in possession of illegal content. Third, 
if, the content is within his control, and he can reproduce these images on 
his screen, reproduce a copy or distribute the content that will be regarded 
as evidence of possession. The question whether the accused is deemed to 
be in possession of illegal content is a question of fact and ultimately one 
which the jury is competent to determine. When addressing this matter, it 
is open to a jury to take into account all these factors including the specific 
knowledge and expertise of the accused. It should be noted that it is incum-
bent on prosecution to discharge its legal and evidentiary burdens. In R v 
Rowe (2008) the Court of Appeal overturned the conviction of an accused 
for being in possession of deleted indecent images of children from his 
computer. The police seized 20 floppy discs from the appellant’s bedroom. 
Eight of these discs contained a large number of deleted files containing 
such images. The other discs contained movie files and child abuse images. 
Files deleted from a floppy disc continue to occupy the storage space until 
they are replaced by subsequent use. The accused argued that the prosecu-
tion had failed to discharge its evidentiary burden of proving that he know-
ingly possessed deleted indecent images of a child contrary to Section 
160(1) of the CJA 1988. The Court of Appeal held that for an accused to be 
liable for possession of these images, knowledge or even the lack of it was 
relevant to criminal liability under the legislation. As these issues and their 
significance to the question of knowledge were not brought to the atten-
tion of the jury, the earlier convictions for these offences were quashed. In 
R v Collier (2004) it was made clear that on a charge for possessing an in-
decent photograph of a child, contrary to Section 160 of the CJA 1988, an 
accused should not be prevented from putting before the jury his defence 
that he had not seen the indecent photograph of a child, nor had he any 
reason to suspect that the content was an indecent photograph of a child.
These cases illustrate judicial awareness of the process by which indecent 
images, sound and text can now be created, accessed and possessed via Web 
2.0 technologies. We should, however, note by way of conclusion to this 
part of the analysis the three defences to charges brought under Section 
160(1). Where a person is charged with the offence of possession, it shall be 
a defence for him to prove (Section 160(2)):
that he had a legitimate reason for having the photograph [or pseudo-
(a) 
photograph] in his possession; or
that he had not himself seen the photograph [or pseudo-photograph] 
(b) 
and did not know, nor had any cause to suspect, it to be indecent; or
that the photograph [or pseudo-photograph] was sent to him without 
(c) 
any prior request made by him or on his behalf and that he did not keep 
it for an unreasonable time.
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 99
For example, the “legitimate reason” defence could be relied upon in a case 
where a police officer responsible for the investigation of child pornography 
is required as part of the evidence gathering process to assume possession 
of the illegal photograph or pseudo-photograph. This defence may also ex-
tend to organisations like the IWF, which may, in the process of managing 
and operating hotline services combating the creation and distribution of 
images of child abuse, come into possession of such content.1 It is, however, 
not open to an individual to access or download illegal child abuse images 
on the grounds of pursuing general research. In Atkins v DPP (2000), Simon 
Brown LJ stated that what constitutes a “legitimate reason” is ultimately a 
question of fact depending on the legitimacy of the research and
whether the defendant is essentially a person of unhealthy interests in 
possession of indecent photographs in the pretence of undertaking re-
search, or by contrast a genuine researcher with no alternative but to 
have this sort of unpleasant material in his possession. (2000: 257)
As the Court of Appeal in R v Porter (2006) observed, it would be surprising 
if Parliament intended to subject an individual to the strictures of the crim-
inal law if after receiving an unsolicited image of child abuse content as 
an attachment in an email, the individual inadvertently views the content 
and deletes it without taking any further measures to ensure its complete 
removal (paragraph 18).
It is worth mentioning briefly three other developments which will con-
tinue to ensure that the child protection objectives under the OPA and the 
PCA 1978 keep pace with developments in technology.
Tracings
The first development concerns the application of the 1978 Act to tracings 
or drawings. It will have been noted that the focus of the 1978 Act has long 
been on “photographs”. Section 69 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration 
Act 2008 now extends the definition of photographs to include a tracing or 
other image, whether made by electronic or other means. The tracing must 
be one which is derived from the whole or part of a photograph or pseudo-
photograph (or a combination of either or both). Data stored on a computer 
disc or by other electronic means which is capable of being converted into a 
tracing is also covered. Software tools now enable individuals to create and 
manipulate high-resolution and three-dimensional drawings of fictitious or 
virtual images of pre-pubescent girls and boys. The most common type of 
activity that leads to the offence being committed is one where an individual 
traces an outline of a photograph onto a tracing paper, and the tracing is then 
transferred onto a real piece of paper, with the drawing being coloured. There 
has been some uncertainty regarding the issue of whether tracing and its 
derivatives which also involved the creation of morphed images comprising 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

100 Online Child Safety
features from children and adults could be regarded as a “photograph” under 
the PCA 1978. When charging a person for this offence, it is incumbent on 
prosecution to show that there is a nexus between the image and the photo-
graph or pseudo-photograph involving a child. Additionally, it must be shown 
that the image is a tracing. Under the current legislation, it would appear that 
freehand drawings are excluded. An individual can, however, raise the de-
fence that he did not know that the image downloaded was a “tracing”.
Prohibited images of children
With the coming into force of Section 62 of the Coroners and Justice Act 
2009 on 6 April 2010, possession of prohibited images of children will 
amount to a criminal offence, irrespective of how the images are created. 
The following elements constitute the offence under Section 62:
a. the person must be in possession of a prohibited image of a child.
b. the image must be pornographic. An image is “pornographic” if it is of 
such a nature that it must reasonably be assumed to have been produced 
solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal. Whether the image 
is pornographic is a question of fact, and consequently a matter for the 
jury to determine. Legitimate works of art, literature or science would 
seem to be excluded.
c. the image is prohibited. The category of images include those which focus 
solely or principally on a child’s genitals or anal region, or portrays the en-
gagement of sexual activity either with or in the presence of a child
and
d. is grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character.
This section creates a discrete offence from those prohibited images and 
content already covered by the OPA and the PCA 1978. Section 65(2), which 
is the definitional provision, states that an “image” includes
a moving or still image (produced by any means), or
(a) 
data (stored by any means) which is capable of conversion into an image 
(b) 
within paragraph (a).
For the purposes of Section 62 an image does not include an indecent photo-
graph, or indecent pseudo-photograph, of a child. References to an image 
of a person and an image of a child include references to an image of an 
imaginary person and imaginary child, respectively.
Extreme pornography
The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 makes two important 
inroads into the growing use of the Internet to disseminate extreme forms 
of pornography (Murray, 2009). First, Section 63 identifies specific types of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 101
pornographic material, which are now to be regulated by the criminal law. 
Second, Section 71 amends the OPA 1959 by increasing the maximum pen-
alty for offences under that Act from three years’ imprisonment to five years’ 
imprisonment (Ministry of Justice, 2009). The original proposals to regulate 
the possession of extreme pornographic material was in part influenced by 
the proliferation of material like necrophilia, bestiality and violence which 
even though were hosted abroad were found to be accessed and distributed 
in the United Kingdom via the Internet. The publication and distribution 
of such content was in many ways rendering the regulatory mechanisms 
put in place under the OPA 1959 redundant (McGlynn et al., 2007, 2009a). 
Consequently, reform of the 1959 Act was seen as being long overdue, and 
the amendments introduced by the 2009 Act will serve to ensure that pos-
session of extreme pornography is now a prohibited act (Henry et al., 2010). 
When prosecuting an individual for this possession offence, the following 
three elements must be shown to be present:
a. image is pornographic;
b. image is grossly offensive, disgusting, or otherwise of an obscene char-
acter; and
c. image portrays in an explicit and realistic way, at least one of a number 
of acts (e.g. depictions of hanging, suffocation, mutilation of breasts or 
genitals or an act involving sexual interference with a human corpse).
Some prosecutions have been already been made under this Act. In R v Derek 
Arnold Wakeling (2010) the accused was convicted for being in possession of 
extreme pornography, which included material involving bestiality within 
Levels 4 and 5 of the Oliver guidelines. In R v Thomas John C (2010) the 
accused was prosecuted for possessing extreme pornography. The materials 
found in his possession included movies involving adults, horses and dogs 
engaging in various forms of sexual activity. In the Australian case of R v 
Gent (2005) an accused was convicted under its child pornography legis-
lation for importing material which included children being subjected to 
sadomasochistic penetration. This form of child abuse content would also 
be covered by this new piece of legislation.
From a sentencing perspective, the Court of Appeal in R v Oliver and Others 
(2002) expressed the view that it was desirable to indicate whether the pho-
tographs downloaded by the offender were photographs or pseudo-photos. 
Possession and downloading of computer-generated pseudo-photographs 
and the making of such images are regarded as being of a lower level of ser-
iousness than, for example, those cases involving the possession or making 
of photographic images of real children. The range of indecent images of 
children circulating on the Internet undoubtedly create legal and practical 
difficulties in assessing whether the criminal law is violated. The Combating 
Paedophile Information Networks in Europe (COPINE) project developed a 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

102 Online Child Safety
classification system which helps rate the various types of child pornography 
content. The COPINE Scale has ten levels, with each level depicting images 
of child in varying degrees of sexuality. The premise in the taxonomy rating 
system is that differentiating child pornography from other forms of sexual-
ised images of the child cannot be understood through legal definitions or 
judicial deliberations. When reviewing the images of child abuse material 
under the COPINE project, the team of researchers attempted to understand 
the nature of such content, the motivations leading to their creation, col-
lection and distribution by individuals. To put it another way, the COPINE 
project team concentrated on the particular sexual characteristics and fea-
tures that made them attractive to adults with a sexual interest in children. 
There is general acceptance that an understanding of the psychological fac-
tors leading to the consumption of particular forms of child abuse content 
over others can assist regulatory and therapeutic strategies (Lanning, 1992; 
Kincaid, 1998; McCabe, 2000). Consequently, the COPINE Scale aims to 
bridge the content with the particular needs and expectations of adults who 
collect the material (Quayle, 2010: 354–8). As Taylor, Holland and Quayle 
note, an overemphasis on legal categorisations tends to “deflect attention 
away from a more discriminating analysis of the photographs themselves, 
and the relationship between the child, the photographer, the photograph 
and the user (2001: 97; Table 3.6).
This typology has not been fully accommodated by the legal system. This 
is understandable, given the premise informing the COPINE rating scale. 
When classifying pornographic material, prosecution use the “Oliver scale”, 
from R v Oliver and Others (2002). The five-point classification is derived 
from the proposals made by the Sentencing Advisory Panel, which now 
advises the Sentencing Guidelines Council. According to the guidelines, for 
example, an accused involved in the making of or trading or distributing 
of material at Levels 1 to 3 will attract a two-year custodial sentence, with 
sentence ranging from one to four years (Table 3.7).
The Oliver scale was developed to reduce any potential legal uncertainties 
or disputes regarding the images that would now be the subject criminal 
law sanctions.
Other jurisdictions
We may briefly consider some of the case law and prosecutions in other 
jurisdictions, which also highlight the similarity of the policy responses 
and the standard setting function of their criminal laws.

plicated by the fact that the First Amendment regards free speech as the

presumptive rule. Attempts to enact statutes aimed at regulating content 
deemed to be illegal or harmful to children must not overreach the rights 
available to all citizens (Reno v ACLU (1997); Ginsberg v New York (1968)) 
The First Amendment, however, does not protect obscene speech that is 
deemed to offend fundamental notions of decency. “Obscene material” 
was described as material “which deals with sex in a manner appealing to 
prurient interest” ((1957) 476, 487) In Miller v California (1973) Mr Chief 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

104 Online Child Safety
Justice Burger set out some basic guidelines for the trier of fact, when deter-
mining the standard of review:
(a) whether “the average person, applying contemporary community 
standards” would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the 
prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently 
offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state 
law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, art-
istic, political, or scientific value. (413 US 15, 24)
With regard to child pornography, the relevant Federal Law brings within 
its scope all visual depictions of a minor engaging in sexually explicit con-
duct (18 USC § 2256 (2008)). These depictions include all forms of media 
used to represent the prohibited image (e.g. photograph, video, computer-
generated image or picture). Obscene visual representations of the sexual 
abuse of children do not obtain First Amendment protections. In Roth v 
United States (1957) it was held that the free flow of information, which is 
based on the liberal ideal of promoting exchange of ideas and individual 
autonomy, could be circumscribed where the material was found to be ob-
scene, lewd, lascivious or filthy. That said, the three guidelines provided in 
Miller v California (1973) also make clear that appropriately drafted content 
regulation would not infringe the free speech rights of its citizens. For ex-
ample, following the decision of the Supreme Court in the United States in 
New York v Ferber (1982) it was observed that the law criminalising porno-
graphic depictions of real children below the age of 16 did not contravene

In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court reflected the growing 
public unease over the way children’s physical and emotional well-being 
were potentially being compromised by those who sought to exploit them 
for sexual purposes. Justice White also emphasised the need to clearly de-
fine the conduct to be prohibited, so that individuals understood that the 
law only criminalised those “works that visually depict sexual conduct by 
children below a specified age” (458 US 747, 763). These constraints on First 
Amendment were seen as both justified and necessary since
the distribution of photographs and films depicting sexual activity by 
juveniles is intrinsically related to the sexual abuse of children in at least 
two ways. First, the materials produced are a permanent record of the 
children’s participation and the harm to the child is exacerbated by their 
circulation. Second, the distribution network for child pornography must 
be closed if the production of material which requires the sexual exploit-
ation of children is to be effectively controlled. (458 US 747, 759)
This approach to combating the problem of child pornography is also 
very much apparent in the decision reached in Osborne v Ohio (1990). The 
Supreme Court had to determine if a curb on the individual’s expectation 
of private possession of child pornography was an infringement of his First 
Amendment rights. It was held that if the problem posed by child porn-
ography to the well-being of children was to be addressed, there was not 
only a need to disrupt the creation and distribution markets but laws were 
also needed to deter individuals from gaining possession of such material 
in the first instance. That said, the Courts have also been mindful that le-
gislative attempts to curb child pornography should not unjustifiably curb 
free speech entitlements under the constitution. One example of legislative 
overreaching was the Child Pornography Prevention Act (CPPA) of 1996. In 
Free Speech Coalition v Reno (1997) the extension of the definition of “child 
pornography” under the 1996 Act to cover images of fictional and morphed 
images of minors were seen as overbroad and unconstitutional. In Ashcroft 
v Free Speech Coalition (2002) Justice Kennedy, whilst accepting the legit-
imate role of the State in criminalising child pornography, did not regard 
its powers as extending to the prohibition of depictions of children, which 
included computer-generated images. To do so, it was argued, would bring 
within the remit of child protection laws a “[r]enaissance painting depicting 
a scene from classical mythology, a ‘picture’ that “appears to be, of a minor 
engaging in sexually explicit conduct”. (535 US 234, 241). Child protection 
legislation regulating child pornography should not, it appears, crimin-
alise youthful-looking adults seeking to engage in their lawful activities. 
It was also felt that computer-generated images of children in themselves 
did not constitute the type of images that attracted criminal sanctions 
since these “images do not involve, let alone harm, any children in the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

production process” (ibid., 241). Additionally, in Free Speech Coalition, the 
criminalisation of material that had been pandered as child pornography, 
regardless of whether it was the case in fact, was deemed to be overbroad. 
In view of the ruling as to the unconstitutional elements of the CPPA, the 
Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children 
Today (PROTECT) Act in 2003 was passed to remedy these deficiencies. The 
PROTECT Act in 2003 can be viewed as the most recent legislative attempt 
to overcome some of the problems faced by law enforcement in prosecuting 
cases on child pornography, in particular, where computer technology is 
used to create child sexual abuse images that also disguised real images of 
abused children. It appears that prior to the enactment of the PROTECT 
Act 2003 prosecutions were not brought in a number of cases owing to the 
difficulties faced by law enforcement in producing evidence that the visual 
images depicted were those of real rather than fictional children. Under the 
PROTECT Act 2003, any person who
knowingly ... advertises, promotes, distributes, or solicits ... any material 
or purported material in a manner that reflects the belief, or that is 
intended to cause another to believe, that the material or purported ma-
terial is, or contains – (i) an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging 
in sexually explicit conduct; or (ii) a visual depiction of an actual minor 
engaging in sexually explicit conduct. (18 USC § 2252(a)(3)(B))
In US v Williams (2008), the Supreme Court pronounced that the provisions 
criminalising the possession and distribution of material pandered as child 
pornography did not encroach into the First Amendment protections. Even 
though there was a majority decision in favour of this finding, the dissent-
ing opinion of Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg agreed, does sug-
gest that the boundaries between protected and unprotected speech will 
continue to dominate much of the debate that surrounds the subject of vir-
tual child pornography (553 US 285, 323–5).
However, obscene content involving children is covered by the criminal 
law. In US v Whorley (2008) the accused was charged with knowing, send-
ing and receipt of 20 obscene emails and downloading of obscene Japanese 
anime cartoons contrary to 18 USC § 1462. The emails described in graphic 
detail a range of sexual activities between children and adults including 
incest and sexual abuse. The 20 cartoons depicted pre-pubescent children 
engaged in explicit sexual activity with adults. Following his conviction the 
accused argued that § 1462 was unconstitutional on the grounds of being 
vague, that possession of obscene content was protected, that § 1462 did 
not apply to text communications and that § 1466A(a)(1) was unconstitu-
tional and could not apply to cartoons. The Court, however, observed that 
the right to mere possession of obscene content within the privacy of one’s 
home did not extend to an expectation of a right to receive, transport or 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 107
distribute such content on interstate commerce. Accordingly, 18 USC § 1462 
regulates and prohibits the use of interstate commerce to move, send or 
receive obscene content. § 1462(a) covers any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or 
filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion picture film, paper, letter, writing, 
print, or other matter of indecent character. Both the text and the cartoons 
were held to be within the scope of the formulation of “obscenity” by the 
Supreme Court in Miller v California (1973).
The criminal law now prohibits the creation and distribution of extreme 
forms of child abuse images, which are obscene and indecent, regardless of 
whether they are real or fictional. In the United States, a comic book col-
lector was charged and convicted for importing and possessing Japanese 
manga books, which contained illustrations of child sex abuse and besti-
ality (Kravets, 2009).
Australia
There have been a number of legislative enactments in Australia and deci-
sions reached by the courts in the States/Territories. At the Commonwealth 
level, content regulation is overseen, for example, by classification restric-
tions and child pornography legislation (Griffiths et al., 2007: 31–4). ACMA 
administers the rules and laws relating to radio, television and Internet con-
tent. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992, for example, sets out the licence 
conditions for the broadcasting industry. A series of mandatory programme 
standards for children (Children’s Television Standards 2009, Broadcasting 
Services (Australian Content) Standard 2005) and industry codes of prac-
tice ensure that age-appropriate content are clearly designated as such. In 
2007, ACMA formulated a set of age-restricted content rules (commercial 
MA15+ content and R18+ content) either hosted in Australia or provided 
from Australia (Lindsay et al., 2008). These rules are set out in the Restricted 
Access System Declaration of 2007. The rules apply to content service pro-
viders who make their content available via a carriage service (i.e. Internet, 
mobile phones and SMS services).
With regard to child pornography legislation, the issues faced by poli-
cymakers and law enforcement mirror many of those we have already dis-
cussed. Possession, distribution and creation of child pornography content 
are activities that give rise to criminal prosecutions. Additionally, the legis-
lation also addresses evolving forms of child abuse material and consump-
tion practices that are facilitated by the Internet. As with the rulings and 
enactments we have considered above, issues regarding the definition of 
the “child” and the substantive elements of the offence of engaging in child 
pornography are equally pertinent to the matters addressed in Australia. 
There are some issues worth highlighting. Given the number of jurisdic-
tions in Australia, the definition of a “child” for the purposes of child porn-
ography legislation varies. New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia 
and Western Australia regard 16 years as the age threshold. The Australian 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

108 Online Child Safety
Capital Territories, Northern Territories, Victoria and Tasmania adopt 
the higher age threshold (i.e. 18 years) as recommended by the Optional 
Protocol. Clearly, policymakers and law enforcement will have to take into 
account these age differences when individuals are found to have accessed 
or downloaded content from jurisdictions where the age threshold is lower. 
The presumption of legality/illegality is something that will become an 
issue as law enforcement aims to curb the prevalence of child pornography 
content accessed over the Internet. The definition of child pornography is 
also widely constructed. The Commonwealth Criminal Code, for example, 
sets the age threshold of a child for the purposes of child pornography at 
18 years and “child pornography material” is described as material that 
depicts, describes such a person who is or appears to be under 18 years old 
or a representation of the person engaged in or appears to be engaged in a 
sexual pose or sexual activity (Section 473.1 (a)(b)). The material must have 
as its dominant characteristic the depiction for a sexual purpose: (i) a sexual 
organ or the anal region of a person who is, or appears to be, under 18 years 
of age; or (ii) a representation of such a sexual organ or anal region; or (iii) 
the breasts, or a representation of the breasts, of a female person who is, or 
appears to be, under 18 years of age; in a way that reasonable persons would 
regard as being, in all the circumstances, offensive (Section 473.1(b). The 
use of the words, “representation”, “description” and “depiction” is also in-
dicative of the potential reach of the legislation, namely, in covering audio, 
text and visual representations of child pornography content (Griffith et al., 
2008: 24–5). Another piece of legislation that adopts an expansive defin-
ition of child pornography content is the Crimes Act 1900. Section 91FA of 
the Crimes Act 1900 (New South Wales Consolidated Acts) regards a “child” 
as a person under the age of 16 years and “child abuse material” comprises 
material that “depicts” or “describes” in a way that reasonable persons re-
gard as being offensive (Section 91 FB). The legislation also covers three cat-
egories of material, including those which depict or describe a person (who 
is or appears to be or implied to be a child) “as a victim of torture, cruelty 
or physical abuse”, “engaged in a sexual pose or sexual activity (whether or 
not in the presence of other persons)”, or the private genitalia of a person 
who is or appears to be a child. Material which has been manipulated so as 
to make the person “appear” to be a child will also be construed as child 
abuse material. Pseudo-child abuse photographs, virtual child pornography 
and digital manipulations of “adult pornography” which create the appear-
ance of the child will now be covered by this enactment. The Act provides 
for limited defences, which absolve the individual of liability for innocent 
production, dissemination or possession (Section 91HA). The absence of 
any mention of accessing illegal content would seem to be an obvious over-
sight, in view of the fact that criminalising access will also make inroads 
to the creation and distribution of child abuse content. In Gibson v Evans 
(2008) the offender was charged with the offence of being in possession of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 109
child pornography content under Section 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
The issue before the court was whether access to child abuse content via a 
hyperlink, as opposed to such images being saved on the computer, could be 
deemed to be possession. The court held that the intentional act of access-
ing websites containing child pornography was an act of possession “within 
the meaning of s 91H(3) if they happen to be displayed, although it might 
be fleeting” (2008: paragraph 7).
The test for determining whether the material is a form of “child abuse 
material” is that of the “community” standard, namely:
(2) whether reasonable persons would regard particular material as being, 
in all the circumstances, offensive, include:
 (a)  the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted 
by reasonable adults, and
 (b)  the literary, artistic or educational merit (if any) of the material, 
and
 (c)  the journalistic merit (if any) of the material, being the merit of the 
material as a record or report of a matter of public interest, and
 (d)  the general character of the material (including whether it is of a 
medical, legal or scientific character) (Windeyer, J. in Crowe v Graham 
(1969) 121 CLR 375).
Finally, Section 62 (of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935) includes 
another set of materials within the scope of child pornography:
(a) that
 
(i) describes or depicts a child engaging in sexual activity; or
 
(ii)  consists of, or contains, the image of a child or bodily parts of a 
child (or what appears to be the image of a child or bodily parts of a 
child) or in the production of which a child has been or appears to 
have been involved; and
(b) that is intended or apparently intended –
 
(i) to excite or gratify sexual interest; or
 
(ii)  to excite or gratify a sadistic or other perverted interest in violence 
or cruelty.
Obviously, whether content can be said to “excite or gratify sexual interest” 
is a question of fact and one which involves an objective assessment being 
made by the jury. It would appear to bring in a wide range of erotica con-
tent under Level 1 of the Oliver scale, which arguably could be created to 
pander to particular audiences (see US v Knox (1991)). The focus appears to 
be not so much on whether the child consciously aims to excite or gratify 
sexual interest but given the context of the legislation which applies “to 
the conduct of children, lasciviousness is not a characteristic of the child 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

110 Online Child Safety
photographed but of the exhibition which the photographer sets up for an 
audience that consists of himself ... [and like-minded individuals]” (US v 
Wiegand (1987) 1239, 1244).
Generally, these legislative enactments, notwithstanding the different 
age groups and use of differing terminology (i.e. child abuse, child pornog-
raphy), will undoubtedly enhance the ability of law enforcement to pros-
ecute offenders engaged in the creation and distribution of extreme child 
pornography, particularly those aimed at exciting or gratifying sadistic 
or violent interests. The law in this area is still evolving and some defin-
itional and jurisdictional issues will have to be addressed (e.g. the varying 
age groups of the “child”, “excite or gratify sexual interest”, the current 
status of “sexting” and the appropriateness of criminalising unauthorised 
distribution of “up-skirt” images via mobile phones and the Internet). It is 
unclear whether child pornography laws are the appropriate medium for 
addressing children’s inappropriate use of Web 2.0 technologies (see later 
discussion). Griffiths and Simon leave open this issue in the light of the rul-
ing in DPP v Drummond (2008) which treats covert “up-skirt” filming of a 
minor’s underwear and related areas as a form of child pornography, rather 
than an invasion of an individual’s privacy (Griffiths and Simon, 2008: 16). 
The magistrate in this case regarded the particular image as being contrary 
to the community standards of decency, and seems to have attached par-
ticular weight to the motive and surreptitious nature of the offender’s con-
duct ((2008) paragraphs 20–30).
Finally, the potential for using the criminal law to prohibit the use of 
computer graphic software to create child abuse images and indecent 
drawings of children has recently been the subject of legal proceedings in 
Australia. McEwen v Simmons (2008) provides another illustration of the 
amenability of the criminal law to addressing the challenges posed by new 
technologies. The accused was charged with offences of possessing child 
pornography contrary to Section 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) 
and with using his computer to access child pornography material con-
trary to Section 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (the 
Code). The material subject of the offences comprised fictional cartoon 
characters from the televised animated series The Simpsons. The accused 
accessed content on a website which depicted the adult and child charac-
ters from the television series engaging in various sexual acts, with their 
genitalia being clearly identified before downloading selected images onto 
his computer. The principal issue addressed by the court was whether a 
fictional cartoon character could be deemed to be a person, and, more 
significantly, a “child” for the purposes of the “possession” and access 
offences. The court acknowledged that there was a distinction between 
acts undertaken by an actual human being and those depicted by a fic-
tional or imaginary person. Counsel for the accused attempted to suggest 
that no offence could be committed where the subjects of the work were 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 111
fictional cartoon characters. To hold otherwise, it was suggested, would be 
tantamount to regarding depiction of violence in video games and com-
ics as harms perpetrated against real individuals (paragraph 5). The court 
rejected the use of these analogies and was particularly scathing of the 
defence which attempted
to suggest that the distinction [between actual and imaginary depiction] 
is merely one of degree. This is quite wrong. Such an approach would 
trivialise pornography that utilised real children and make far too culp-
able the possession of representations that did not. Of course, the use 
of the imaginary material to groom children would make its possession 
more serious. (Ibid.)
The court held that fictional drawings of persons could be regarded as child 
pornography, even though they were not realistic representations of human 
beings. It was sufficient, in the court’s view, that the fictional representa-
tion was that of a human being and was recognised as such. The fact that 
no specific human being was depicted, it would seem to follow from this 
reasoning, may not be relied upon as a defence to prosecution for child 
pornography. This approach obviously stands in marked contrast to the ob-
servation in Ashcroft v Free Speech Coalition:
The Government submits further that virtual child pornography whets 
the appetites of pedophiles and encourages them to engage in illegal con-
duct. This rationale cannot sustain the provision in question. The mere 
tendency of speech to encourage unlawful acts is not a sufficient reason 
for banning it. The government “cannot constitutionally premise legisla-
tion on the desirability of controlling a person’s private thoughts”. (535 
US 234, 253 (2002))
Canada
The position in Canada with regard to prosecuting individuals for mak-
ing, possessing and distributing illegal child abuse images is not dissimilar 
to the regulatory responses we have already discussed. The leading case of 
R v Sharpe (2001) characterised the juridical question facing the Supreme 
Court as one of whether criminalisation of the possession of child porn-
ography was consistent with the constitutional right of Canadians to free 
expression. In framing the subject of child pornography in these terms, the 
court attempted to address, at least, the then perception of a conflict be-
tween the rights to free expression and the right of children to be protected 
from harm. The accused was charged with one count of illegal possession 
under Section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c. C-46, and an-
other count of possession for the purposes of distribution or sale under s. 
163.1(3) of the Criminal Code. In the lower court, Mr Justice Shaw ruled 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

112 Online Child Safety
that Section 163.1(4) was unconstitutional on the basis that it unjustifiably 
intruded into the privacy of an individual ((1999) paragraphs 49–50). The 
Court of Appeal (1999) on a narrow majority of 2 to 1 upheld the trial judge’s 
conclusion. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeal seems to have 
attached particular prominence to what it regarded as mere possession of 
child pornography for private purposes (which should not be criminalised) 
and other activity like making and distributing such content (which should 
be criminalised). One could legitimately query whether such a distinction is 
defensible; the market for child pornography is defined very much by sup-
pliers and distributors meeting the needs of its audience of consumers who 
seek access to such content in both private and public domains. Not surpris-
ingly, the Supreme Court (2001) held that the right to free expression was 
not absolute and could be qualified in order to protect the underlying values 
served by prohibiting the possession of child pornography. The propositions 
at stake were neatly encapsulated in the following dicta:
Just as no one denies the importance of free expression, so no one de-
nies that child pornography involves the exploitation of children. The 
links between possession of child pornography and harm to children are 
arguably more attenuated than are the links between the manufacture 
and distribution of child pornography and harm to children. However, 
possession of child pornography contributes to the market for child 
pornography, a market which in turn drives production involving the 
exploitation of children. Possession of child pornography may facilitate 
the seduction and grooming of victims and may break down inhibitions 
or incite potential offences. Some of these links are disputed and must be 
considered in greater detail in the course of the s. 1 justification analysis. 
The point at this stage is simply to describe the concerns that, according 
to the government, justify limiting free expression by banning the pos-
session of child pornography. ((2001) paragraph 28)
By setting out the public interest issues at stake both for and against the 
prohibition of child abuse content, the Supreme Court was at pains to avoid 
the overreaching of child pornography legislation into those private spheres 
where individuals may keep a diary recounting their sexual fantasies and 
encounters (ibid., paragraph 59). This ruling reflects, as in the United States, 
the continued tensions between free speech and child protection laws 
(McGlynn et al., 2009b). It also indicates that civil libertarian claims of the 
provenance of free speech should not be overstated and instead should take 
into account the concerns of the criminal law in addressing five harms to 
children resulting from possession of child pornography:
(1) child pornography promotes cognitive distortions; (2) it fuels fanta-
sies that incite offenders; (3) prohibiting its possession assists law enforce-
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 113
ment efforts to reduce the production, distribution and use that result in 
direct harm to children; (4) it is used for grooming and seducing victims; 
and (5) some child pornography is produced using real children. (Ibid.: 
paragraph 86)
It is perhaps fair to say that since the ruling in R v Sharpe (2001), the legal 
basis upon which individuals are made liable for “possession” of child porn-
ography appear to be reasonably well settled (R v LM (2008); R v Morelli 
(2010)). There are some refinements which should be noted by way of com-
pleteness. For example, in R v RD (2010) the Court of Appeal for British 
Columbia stated that the law regarding possession of child pornography 
did not apply to images viewed on the computer screen. It concluded that 
if an accused was to be found liable for accessing child pornography con-
tent, something more than the fact of it being saved automatically by the 
computer onto its hard drive was required (paragraphs 32–8). Canada’s 
Criminal Code contains a series of provisions criminalising the creation, 
publication, transmission, possession, and accessing of child abuse content 
(Section 163.1 of the Criminal Code). Canada’s Bill C-2, an Act to amend 
the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons), 
and the Canada Evidence Act reflect the Government’s continuing commit-
ment towards strengthening the protection of children from violence and 
sexual abuse. The Government established a National Strategy to Protection 
from Sexual Exploitation on the Internet. The National Child Exploitation 
Coordination Centre (NCECC), which is part of the Canadian Police Centre 
for Missing and Exploited Children (CPCMEC), is the law enforcement arm 
of the National Strategy. The Centre was set up in response to growing par-
ental and public concerns raised by children’s access to and use of Web 2.0 
technologies. Bill C-2 is one governance response to enhancing the safety 
of children in the online environment. The preamble notes that this enact-
ment reflects Canada’s commitment to the standards and principles under 
the UNCRC, and in particular its obligation to protect children from all 
forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, following its ratification of 
the Optional Protocol. Bill C-2 also resolves some of the issues raised by 
Sharpe (2001), namely, the types of material that can now be characterised 
as “child pornography” (s163.1); these can now include
(c) any written material whose dominant characteristic is the description, 
for a sexual purpose, of sexual activity with a person under the age of 18 
years that would be an offence under this Act; or
(d) any audio recording that has as its dominant characteristic the de-
scription, presentation or representation, for a sexual purpose, of sexual 
activity with a person under the age of 18 years that would be an offence 
under this Act.
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

114 Online Child Safety
There is now no requirement for written content to counsel or advocate 
sexual activity. Courts can also take into account aggravating factors when 
sentencing offenders (e.g. child abuse content created for commercial and 
sexual exploitation) (Section 163.1(4.3)). Additionally, the defence of “art-
istic merit or an educational, scientific or medical purpose” is now replaced 
with a more limited defence, namely, “legitimate purpose related to the ad-
ministration of justice or to science, medicine, education or art; and does 
not pose an undue risk of harm to persons under the age of eighteen years” 
(Section 163.1(6)). Consequently, the replacement of the “artistic merit” 
defence with that of the offender having a “legitimate purpose” imposes 
an objective two-step test. Finally, the amendments also keep abreast of 
the misuse of Web 2.0 technologies, and criminalise acts like those of the 
offender in DPP v Drummond (Section 162(1)). The prohibited acts are not 
only limited to the “surreptitious” observation in circumstances giving rise 
to a reasonable expectation of privacy, in any one of three situations iden-
tified but also to the knowing distribution of such material or possession of 
material knowingly obtained in violation of Section 162(1) (Section 162(4)). 
There is a defence of “public good” against prosecution under Section 162 
(Sections 162(6) and (7)). Bill C-2 also makes it easier for child victims to 
assist in the investigation and prosecution of individuals for child porn-
ography offences. It remains to be seen whether the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms may be relied upon at some stage in the future to challenge the 
constitutionality of the “legitimate interest” defence and the inclusion of 
“fictional” depictions of children within the definition of child pornog-
raphy. It could be said that given the pernicious nature of child pornog-
raphy, it may be constitutionally acceptable to require individuals to prove 
that they have a legitimate interest and that the works show a “public 
good”. Fundamentalists may take a different view, but it completely ignores 
the growing need for a balance to be struck between speech and protection 
concerns.
One final observation should be made with regard to the applicability 
of the rules on the distribution and possession of child pornography when 
these are undertaken via P2P file software downloaded onto the computer. 
There have been a number of successful prosecutions, particularly in the 
United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, which show that child 
pornography laws extend to the misuse of P2P technologies for accessing 
and distributing illegal content. In R v Gary Palmer (2009) the accused was 
prosecuted for a range of offences under the PCA including counts on dis-
tributing 856 indecent photographs and in receipt of 712 such images whilst 
using the file-sharing site LimeWire. The decision of the Supreme Court of 
Queensland in R v Carson (2008) provides another illustration of the way 
existing provisions in child pornography legislation could be used to regu-
late the use of P2P file-sharing software for distributing illegal child abuse 
content. The accused was charged with two counts of possession of 11,816 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

child exploitation files downloaded from the LimeWire file-sharing software 
and distribution of 2,483 child exploitation files stored on his computer’s 
“shared folder” which were available for downloading by other LimeWire 
users. It was contended that the offender did not “actively” send any files to 
others, that he did not engage in any commercial exchange of files and that 
there was no evidence that anyone had actually accessed the files on his 
folder. The critical point emphasised by the Court was that in doing what 
he did, the accused had facilitated the ability of other users of file-sharing 
software to gain access to a large repository of child exploitation material 
from his computer. The Court demonstrated a good understanding of the 
file-sharing software, and in particular its awareness of the way P2P file-
sharing programmes can be misused by individuals to make illegal content 
available to like-minded individuals:
The applicant’s submissions overlook the reality of modern day infor-
mation dissemination ... Indeed on one level, the distribution of material 
through a file sharing program such as LimeWire may be seen as par-
ticularly pernicious because it provides ready world-wide access within a 
system designed to facilitate proliferation of the material, while offering 
a degree of anonymity to the distributor. (paragraph 36)
Sexting: Child pornography?
Finally, one child protection issue that has emerged in recent times concerns 
the practice amongst some children and young adolescents in taking sexu-
ally explicit photographs of themselves. Even though there is no one def-
inition of “sexting”, the National Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned 
Pregnancy (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)) 
offers an acceptable description, which is regarded as involving the prac-
tice of
youth writing sexually explicit messages, taking sexually explicit photos 
of themselves or others in their peer group, and transmitting those 
photos and/or messages to their peers. (NCMEC, 2009)
This practice is part of a broader trend of individuals, more particularly 
adolescents, using the Internet and social media to express their identities 
and status amongst their peers. Whilst the practice of children taking semi-
nude or provocative photographs in itself, for example, through the use a 
Polaroid camera is not new, the convergence between the self-presentation 
culture and mobile technologies (e.g. mobile phones) has contributed to 
the media and policy focus on sexting (Lenhart, 2009; Senft, 2008). The 
Proposed Directive leaves Member States with the flexibility in the way its 
criminal laws are used to address consensual activities of this nature be-
tween minors (European Commission, 2010e, recital 7). Under US Federal 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

116 Online Child Safety
Law, no distinction is made by 18 USC § 2256(8) between child pornog-
raphy content generated by minors and adults. It is generally accepted that 
an adult who persuades or induces a minor to take sexually explicit photo-
graphs should be prosecuted under the sexual offences legislation. Failure 
by prosecution to establish the substantive elements of the offence can be 
fatal, as seen in the case of US v Broxmeyer (2010). The accused was a 36-year-
old field hockey coach, and was convicted on two counts of producing child 
pornography, contrary to 18 USC § 2251(a), and possession of child porn-
ography under 18 USC § 2252A(a)(5)(B). Under Federal law, § 2251(a), pros-
ecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt the following elements of the 
offence for producing child pornography: (a) the victim was below the age 
of 18 years old; (b) the defendant persuaded, used, induced or enticed the 
minor to take part in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing 
a visual depiction of that conduct; and (c) the visual depiction was produced 
using materials that been transported in interstate or foreign commerce. 
The accused was convicted in the District Court for the Northern District 
of New York on production of child pornography. On appeal, he challenged 
successfully the legal basis of his conviction with regard to the sufficiency 
of evidence provided by prosecution under § 2251 (b). The Court of Appeal 
stressed that if the conviction for production of child pornography was to 
be upheld, evidence had to be produced by prosecution proving a causal 
link between the acts of the accused and the decision by the minor to take 
the two sexually explicit photographs of herself. The Court found there was 
no evidence that the accused in fact “induced” the minor to take the sexu-
ally explicit photographs. It is clear, however, that had the accused in fact 
solicited or persuaded the minor to send him nude images of herself, the 
offence would have been committed.
With regard to the practice of sexting between minors, there is some de-
gree of ambivalence regarding the appropriateness of using child pornog-
raphy laws to prosecute children. A study carried out by Girlfriend magazine 
showed that 40 per cent of the 588 Australian teenage girls that participated 
in the study had been asked to take semi-nude or sexually explicit images 
of their bodies (Battersby, 2008). In the United States, a study involving 
653 teenagers found that 20 per cent had engaged in sexting (National 
Campaign, 2008). In the United Kingdom, a recent survey amongst young 
adolescents showed that 40 per cent of the respondents indicated that they 
knew friends who engaged in sexting (Phippen, 2009). Twenty-seven per 
cent of the respondents indicated that sexting was a common practice 
amongst their peer group. Over 56 per cent of the respondents observed 
that in a number of instances the images and videos were distributed be-
yond the immediate recipient without the express consent of the parties 
concerned. Sexting raises undoubted governance issues since electronic 
images or information can be disseminated to a wide audience, be manipu-
lated and even used to harass, intimidate or bully the person whose image 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 117
is on the photograph. According to the NCMEC, the practice implicates a 
number of individuals: the person whose image is displayed in the photo-
graph, the person who takes the photograph, the persons who distribute 
the photographs and, finally, the persons who receive and distribute the 
photographs. It is worth recalling that by uploading photographs onto a 
social networking site or taking pictures on a webcam or mobile phone, 
permanent electronic records are made of the images and that these can be 
easily distributed across the Internet and other communication tools like 
emails, mobile phones and sites like YouTube.
In the United Kingdom, the various participants in the sexting chain can 
be prosecuted if the images satisfy the substantive elements of the OPA and 
the PCA legislation. For example, the question of whether a visual image 
taken by a minor is indecent will be determined by reference to the jury’s 
determination of whether the photograph offends “currently accepted 
standards of decency; and indecency must always be judged in the light of 
time, place and circumstances” (R v Flynn (2010) paragraph 30). Technically, 
the practice of sexting will automatically trigger the actus reus of the fol-
lowing elements of the PCA 1978 – making, distribution and possession 
offences. There is also the question whether the content of the photographs 
will meet the threshold stipulated by the provisions in the PCA 1978 and, fi-
nally, whether the discretion should be exercised for or against prosecuting 
the young individuals.
The appropriateness of using child pornography legislation to curb sex-
ting has been the subject of judicial comment in Miller v Mitchell (2008). The 
context for this legal action is particularly significant. In 2008, the District 
Attorney of Wyoming County in Pennsylvania was presented with evi-
dence of three teenagers engaging in sexting. Officials in the Tunkhannock, 
Pennsylvania School District, discovered a number of male students trad-
ing in allegedly sexually explicit images of a number of teenage girls over 
their mobile phones. It is not entirely clear what decisions were taken in 
respect of the individuals found to have made these images. Students in 
Tunkhannock High School were, however, informed that those found in 
possession of inappropriate images of minors could be prosecuted under 
State law for possession or distribution of child pornography, or for offences 
relating to the criminal use of a communication facility for such activity. 
A group of students whose images were found on their mobile phones were 
presented with two options: (1) participate in an education programme or 
(2) face criminal prosecutions. Some of the photographs deemed to be child 
pornography included girls shown from waist up wearing white opaque 
bras, a girl posing provocatively in a bathing suit and finally a photograph 
of a girl wrapped in a white, opaque towel, just below her breasts, appearing 
to have just had a shower. The parents instituted a § 1983 action against 
the District Attorney, alleging no probable cause and that the threats of 
potential charges contravened the minor’s First Amendment rights. James 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

118 Online Child Safety
Munley J. granted the order for a preliminary injunction. The rejection 
of the District Attorney’s subsequent appeal to the Court of Appeal has 
been regarded as illustrating the inappropriateness of prosecuting minors 
under child pornography laws (Pavia, 2011). Concerns have been expressed 
in Australia regarding the use of child pornography laws to prosecuting 
minors engaged in sexting, in view of the proposed reforms to the Crimes 
Legislation Amendment (Sexual Offences against Children) Bill 2010 (para-
graphs 3.32–6).2 Section 474.27A, which is the relevant provision of the 
Bill, requires the following elements to be satisfied: (1) a carriage service 
has been used to transmit a communication between the sender and a re-
cipient; (2) the communication includes material that is indecent; (3) the 
recipient is someone who is or who the sender believes to be below the age 
of 16 years; and (4) the sender is at least 18 years of age. Sexting, however, 
raises an important public policy issue, namely, whether the criminal law is 
an appropriate mechanism for deterring the practice as between young ado-
lescents. It could be argued that the criminal law should not be extended 
to this practice, since sexting involves voluntary acts of children grappling 
with their identities and sexuality (Sacco, 2010). It is, however, worth not-
ing an important point highlighted by the Senate Legal and Constitutional 
Affairs Legislation Committee, when it observed that3
while the committee acknowledges that the practice [of sexting] may be 
undesirable, it agrees with arguments that young people engaged in such 
behaviour should not be exposed to the grave consequences and stigma 
that attach to allegations of, and convictions for, child sexual offences. 
(paragraph 3.55)
It is a view that is mirrored in the guidance issued by the Crown Prosecution 
Service (CPS) to prosecutors when deciding whether the public interest 
is best served by instigating criminal prosecutions against young adults 
engaged in such forms of behaviour. Accordingly, with regard to photo-
graphs, which are deemed to be “indecent” images of minors, the PCA 
1978 provides a limited defence in relation to an image which relates to 
a child aged 16 or 17 years – where the parties were married or lived to-
gether in an enduring loving relationship the production and exchange 
of images between them would not constitute a violation of the criminal 
law. Clearly, in the type of sexting practices reported by the media or sur-
veys as taking place between minors, these exceptions are unlikely to be 
relevant. That said, it is not always the case that prosecution will invari-
ably follow from the making, distribution or possession of images which 
may technically be within the scope of the child pornography legislation. 
For example, Section 474.27A or Section 1 of the 1978 Act could be con-
strued more narrowly; the prosecutorial discretion would not be exercised 
in favour of using the criminal law to intervene where the particular user-
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 119
generated sexual content is shown not to have been produced by coercion 
or exploitation. There is a plausible argument for holding that sexually 
explicit images exchanged between consenting young adults should not 
be criminalised – notwithstanding our view of the moral soundness or 
appropriateness of such conduct. There is, however, another aspect to the 
governance issues raised by the practice of sexting, particularly where 
user-generated images of children are distributed or published to third 
parties, as a form of “sexy” communications via mobile phones or posted 
on profile pages on social networking sites. Legislation dealing with child 
pornography and indecent photographs containing pictures of minors 
were drafted to protect children and those who are less than mature from 
being sexually or commercially exploited by adults, and also to protect 
children from the reputational harm that may result as a direct conse-
quence of their actions (Sacco, 2010). Clearly, if the images taken by chil-
dren come within the type of prohibited conduct and are subsequently 
uploaded onto websites or distributed among peers there may be a case for 
saying that the public interest is served in bringing prosecutions. This is a 
dilemma that is unlikely to be readily resolved by the criminal law, as the 
following observation from Lord Falconer in the debates in Parliament 
makes clear:
Our overriding concern is to protect children, not to punish them un-
necessarily ... Where sexual relationships between minors are not abusive, 
prosecuting either or both children is highly unlikely to be in the public 
interest; nor would it be in the best interests of the children involved. 
(Hansard, 2003: column 1176)
This is true but it may, however, be recalled that in New York v Ferber (1982) 
the Supreme Court was at pains to stress the compelling reasons justi-
fying the restriction on First Amendment rights, namely, the safeguard-
ing of the physical, psychological and emotional well-being of the child. 
Sexting could be seen as being “intrinsically related to the sexual abuse 
of children” in the sense of perpetuating a culture of self-victimisation 
and commodification of children as objects of sexual interest (458 US 747, 
758). In AH v State (2007) it was held that the State did have a compelling 
interest in regulating the practice of sexting. The 16-year-old in this case 
emailed nude photographs of herself to her 17-year-old boyfriend. Wolf J 
noted that
prosecuting the child under the statute in question is the least intrusive 
means of furthering the State’s compelling interest. Not prosecuting the 
child would do nothing to further the State’s interest. Prosecution ena-
bles the State to prevent future illegal, exploitative acts by supervising 
and providing any necessary counseling to the child. (2007: 236)
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

120 Online Child Safety
In State v ARS (1996) the District Court of Appeal of Florida for the First 
District held that there was a compelling interest in State intervention even 
in a minor–minor situation, to protect the “minor from the sexual activity 
itself for reasons of health and quality of life” (1996: 1387). At the core of 
the controversy surrounding the practice of sexting is the extent to which 
the State and/or parents can or should intervene in children’s expectations 
of their right or freedom to express their identities and autonomy (In re 
Gault, 387 US 1, 17). Whilst it is uncontroversial that parents or the State 
should intervene in cases of child abuse or where there are risks of exposure 
to illegal content, it is less than clear whether regulating the practice of 
sexting per se offends a child’s rights to privacy and freedom of expression 
(Tinker v Des Moines Independent Community School District (1968); Roper v 
Williams (2005)). It is not surprising that in view of the difficult moral, so-
cial and legal issues raised by the practice of sexting that a balanced gov-
ernance response has been advocated. Sexting, it is suggested, should not be 
seen purely as a law enforcement problem. The Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC), in accordance with its governance remit under the Broadband Data 
Improvement Act of 2008, has directed its efforts in raising the awareness 
of parents and educators so that these adults could mediate the activities 
of children (FTC, 2010a). Children need to be made fully aware of the rep-
utational harms and legal ramifications of the practice; the transmission 
of texts and images of provocative or sexually explicit nature may result 
in their violation of pornography and obscenity laws, in addition to ex-
posing them to peer victimisation (Logan v Sycamore Community School Bd. 
of Education (2011)). Jessica Logan committed suicide after nude pictures 
of her (from the neck down) were distributed amongst students. A timely 
response is also needed, as there are long-term developmental, social and 
career implications that accompany convictions under child pornography 
laws – imprisonment and requirements to register under the sex offender 
rules (Lenhart, 2009: 10). A number of legislatures have been at the fore-
front of revising existing laws or introducing new laws to deal with the prac-
tice of sexting. In 2011, at least 18 states in the United States have directed 
their efforts towards enacting a legislative framework which requires dis-
trict education boards and schools to implement online child safety policies 
aimed at educating young children about the risks of sending images of 
minors engaged in lewd or sexually explicit activity, and also reminding 
children and their parents of the consequences of violating school policies 
prohibiting sexting. The Pennsylvania General Assembly, for example, has 
proposed a House Bill 2189 which amends its criminal code to deal with 
the offence of dissemination of prohibited materials by minors through the 
use of mobile phones and other communication technologies. The South 
Carolina General Assembly has introduced a Bill creating an offence of sex-
ting. Children between the ages of 12 and 18 years who transmit to an-
other minor a visual or other content depicting himself or another in a state

of sexual activity or sexually explicit nudity will be subject to a fine and 
will be required to undergo an educational programme. Completion of the 
programme and payment of the fine will lead to the misdemeanour being 
expunged from the individual’s record.
Peer victimisation: Bullying, harassment 
and stalking
Peer victimisation is a major online child safety issue in most countries. 
Internet, mobile phones and social media can now be used to bully, harass 
and stalk victims (Chamberlain et al., 2010). The standard setting role of 
the criminal law with regard to protecting children from all forms of peer 
victimisation corresponds with the United Kingdom’s international obliga-
tions under a number of conventions and instruments. For example, Article 
3 of the ECHR (which have been enacted into the UK Law by virtue of the 
Human Rights Act 1988) provides that no one should be subject to “in-
human or degrading treatment”. Article 28(2) of the UNCRC requires States 
to “take all appropriate measures to ensure that school discipline is admin-
istered in a manner consistent with the child’s human dignity and in con-
formity with the present Convention”. Articles 37 and 19 of the UNCRC 
elaborate the extent of the State’s and by proxy the School’s responsibility. 
Many of the laws which cover bullying, assaults, harassment and stalking 
can be used to address the safety and security concerns raised by technol-
ogy-mediated victimisation. Most countries have in place legislation that 
requires schools to implement measures which create a safe environment 
for pupils (House of Commons, 2011; DCSF, 2008). For example, Section 
61 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires schools to 
ensure that measures are in place to prevent all forms of bullying among 
pupils. The Act also requires each governing body to review its policy on 
bullying annually. Schools also owe a duty of care towards pupils (175 of 
the Education Act 2002 and Education and Inspections Act 2006 (EIA, 
2006)). A failure to discharge the obligation to take reasonable safety and 
security measures towards protecting pupils can lead to schools and Local 
Educational Authorities being subjected to actions for breach of statutory 
duty or the common law tort of negligence. Educators can also utilise their 
powers under the 2006 Education Act to discipline pupils who engage in peer 
victimisation both off and on school premises (DCSF, 2008). Significantly, 
the liability of schools is subjected to the test of whether reasonable steps 
have been taken to provide pupils with a safe and secure environment (Cox 
v State of New South Wales (2007)). The imposition of the standard of rea-
sonableness makes it clear that the duty does not extend to eliminating all 
forms of risks and harms to pupils (Geyer v Downs (1977)). In Bradford-Smart 
v West Sussex County Council Judge LJ giving the judgment of the Court of 
Appeal made this observation:
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

122 Online Child Safety
Any school has to have sensible disciplinary policies and procedures if it 
is to function properly as a school at all ... But in order to hold the school 
liable towards a particular pupil, the question is always whether the school 
was in breach of its duty of care towards that pupil and whether that breach 
caused the particular harm which was suffered. (2002: paragraph 38)
As observed previously, bullying and other forms of victimisation in the on-
line environment can manifest itself in physical, emotional and psychological 
effects on the victim (Office of the Children’s Commissioner, 2006). Where 
online victimisation is different from non-electronic forms of bullying is the 
speed, scale and devastating effects on victims targeted by peers. During the 
last few years there have been increasing media reports of the rise in peer vic-
timisation through the use of new communication technologies. Technology-
mediated victimisation can be relentless and the consequences fatal. Growing 
concerns about the impact of cyberbullying on children’s safety and well-
being has led to calls for the New South Wales administration to respond 
swiftly (Jones, 2009). The 2008 Eurobarometer Survey highlighted the scale 
of parental concerns about electronically mediated victimisation; 54 per 
cent of European parents expressed concerns about their children being bul-
lied online (Eurobarometer, 2008). As cases like Lori Drew (2009) make clear, 
unless the acts of victimisation come within the existing categories of crimes 
no criminal prosecution will be possible. Any redress for the harms suffered 
will require the individual to pursue the claims under the civil law (Cox v State 
of New South Wales; TK; Logan). In the remainder of this Section I identify 
some responses of the criminal law in addressing the risks posed by peer vic-
timisation, namely, the Offences against the Persons Act 1861, the Malicious 
Communications Act (MCA) 1988, Section 127 of the Communications Act 
2003 and the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. The discussion concludes 
with a brief examination of the significance of the alternative strategies for 
the MSIG model.
Offences against the Person Act 1861
The protection afforded to an individual with regard to his physical bodily 
integrity has been an established principle under the common law and 
Article 8 of the ECHR (Table 3.8). Unauthorised disclosures of private infor-
mation and acts which interfere with the individual’s safety and well-being 
are examples of infringements to the right to respect for private life and 
correspondence.
Clearly, where online peer victimisation extends to offline physical 
attacks or sexual violence, the law has mechanisms for addressing the harm 
suffered by an individual. Common law assault is a term used to describe 
those acts which cause an individual to apprehend imminent unlawful con-
tact. For a common law offence to be committed, two requirements must 
be met. First, the accused must cause the victim to apprehend imminent 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 123
and unlawful force. Second, the accused must be shown to have intended 
or be regarded as being reckless to the consequence of the act (Savage and 
Parmenter (1992)). A text threatening violence when a student is making 
his way to school could be seen as an example of an “imminent” threat. 
The fact that the threat does not materialise is not relevant (Longdon v DPP 
(1976)). In addition to the common law offence of assault, individuals have 
also been charged with the offence of battery (Fagan v MPC (1976); Collins v 
Wilcock (1984)). The Offences against the Person Act (OAPA) 1861 envisages 
that any act or omission which results in a person being put in fear of his or 
her bodily integrity can be liable for an assault. An individual on summary 
conviction for an assault occasioning actual bodily harm can be imprisoned 
for a term not exceeding six months (Section 39 of the CJA 1988). Under 
Section 47 of the 1861 Act, an individual can be convicted for any assault 
occasioning actual bodily harm. There are two requirements to this statu-
tory offence, which on indictment can result in a five-year imprisonment 
term. First, the accused must be shown by his actions (or omissions) to have 
caused actual bodily harm to the victim. Second, it must be shown that the 
accused intended or was reckless as to the assault or battery (R v Ireland, R 
v Burstow (1998)). In R v Donovan (1934) “actual bodily harm” was regarded 
as comprising any harm or injury calculated to interfere with the health or 
comfort of the victim. There are limits to the potential liability of schools in 
this respect. In Webster v Ridgeway Foundation School (2010) the perpetrators 
of an assault on a pupil by his peers and non-pupils on school premises were 
prosecuted under Section 18 of the OAPA. The victim in this case suffered 
a brutal attack leaving him with serious head injuries inflicted by a non-
pupil. It is quite important to also note the view adopted by the Court with 
regard to the question of whether the victim could seek compensation from 
the school for these injuries. As Nicol J makes plain:
I consider that it would be fair, just and reasonable to conclude that to 
some extent, at least, the school had a duty to take reasonable care to safe-
guard and protect Henry from attack by outsiders. ((2010, paragraph 119)
Table 3.8 Article 8 of the ECHR
Article 8
1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and 
his correspondence.
2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of 
this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a 
democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the 
economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, 
for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and 
freedoms of others.
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

124 Online Child Safety
According to this line of reasoning, it would seem reasonable to infer that 
whilst it is important for schools to discharge their duties towards pupils, it 
is perhaps a step too far to suggest that the criminal law should invariably 
intervene when children are subjected to criticisms or unkind comments (R 
v Ireland (1998); R v Morris (1998)). There is also a real concern that extend-
ing the reach of the criminal law to prosecute all forms of conflicts be-
tween peers or the use of exclusion orders would be tantamount to adopting 
a “zero tolerance policy”, which may unwittingly act as a disincentive for 
individuals to report bullying incidents to authorities (House of Commons, 
2011; Sampson, 2002: 24).
Malicious Communications Act 1988
One frequent question raised by schools and parents is whether malicious 
or unpleasant comments posted on a victim’s social networking account 
or distribution of false or unkind information about the victim can be the 
subject of criminal sanctions. For an actionable communication, Section 1 
of the MCA 1988 must be satisfied. The section states that any person who 
sends to another person a letter, electronic communication or article of 
any description which conveys a message which is indecent or grossly of-
fensive; a threat or information which is false and known or believed to be 
false by the sender or any article or electronic communication which is, in 
whole or part, of an indecent or grossly offensive nature is liable if his pur-
pose, or one of his purposes, in sending it is that it should cause distress or 
anxiety to the recipient or to any other person to whom he intends that it 
or its contents or nature should be communicated (Connolly v DPP (2007)). 
The MCA gives a wide definition to the meaning of “electronic commu-
nication” and these include instant messages, texts, emails and any audio 
or video communication. The MCA is sufficiently flexible to address three 
types of malicious communications which children may be vulnerable to 
when using Web 2.0 technologies like email, IM and other communica-
tion tools:
1. Indecent or grossly offensive communication
When determining if the communication is indecent or grossly offensive a 
court will consider whether the communication offends the ordinary stand-
ards of decency and propriety (R v Stanley (1965)). A communication will 
be deemed to be “obscene” if on an objective assessment it is found to be 
shocking, lewd or indecent (R v Anderson (1972); R v Straker (1965)). Issues 
regarding the obscenity or indecency of the communication are left to the 
jury to determine (R v Stamford (1972)). It is not enough to show that the 
communication is merely offensive. Following DPP v Collins (2006), it was 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 125
made clear that the message must be grossly offensive, and whether that is 
the case will depend on the standards of a democratic multi-racial society.
2. Threats via email or texts are also covered by the Act.
As noted previously, it is an offence to send any form of electronic com-
munication (R v Solanke (1969); R v Williams (1986)). Section 1(2) of the Act 
does provide the person sending the communication with a defence. The 
provision states that a person shall not be found guilty if a threat was made 
to reinforce a legal demand and the sender had reasonable grounds for be-
lieving that he could send the email.
3. Sending information which is false and known or is believed to be false 
with the intention of causing anxiety or distress is also an offence under 
the MCA.
It is relevant to note here that information which could be viewed as “fair 
comment” or postings on websites which recount certain aspects of a pri-
vate relationship or sexual encounters which is not lewd or grossly of-
fensive but is calculated to cause embarrassment would fall outside this 
legislation.
In Connolly v DPP (2007) the accused was convicted of sending graphic 
photographs of aborted foetuses to pharmacies supplying contraceptive 
pills. The Court held that the conviction of the accused for sending an art-
icle which was indecent or grossly offensive did not abridge the rights under 
the Human Rights Act 1998, namely, Sections 9 and 10. Dyson LJ noted that 
the terms indecent and grossly offensive did not have a unique meaning for 
the purposes of the 1998 Act ((2007) paragraph 10).
Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003
The enactment of Section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 ensures 
that the types of activity covered by the MCA 1988 are similarly covered, 
where the communications take place through a public electronic com-
munications network. This section criminalises two particular types of 
conduct. First, Section 127(1) criminalises messages or other matter sent 
through public electronic communications networks which are grossly of-
fensive, or can be regarded as being of an indecent, obscene or menacing 
character. Any person who also causes such message or matter to be sent 
will be prosecuted under this section. Second, messages sent by public elec-
tronic communications network, which the sender knows to be false, or 
causes such a message to be sent; or persistent use of a public electronic 
communications network for the purpose of causing annoyance, incon-
venience or needless anxiety to another will constitute an offence under 
this Act. In both instances, on summary conviction, the perpetrator can

126 Online Child Safety
be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six months or fined (not exceeding 
Level 5). A “public electronic communications network” is defined as an 
electronic communications network provided wholly or mainly for the pur-
pose of making electronic communications service that is provided so as to 
be available for use by members of the public. It is important to make clear 
that the section only applies to the use of a communications network and 
service that have been provided and funded by the public. Section 127(1), it 
should be noted, aims to balance the rights to private life and the rights to 
freedom of expression enshrined in Articles 8 and 10 of the Human Rights 
Act 1998, respectively. The leading case is DPP v Collins (2006). The accused 
made a number of phone calls which were grossly offensive to the office of a 
Member of Parliament. Racially offensive telephone messages were also left 
by the accused. At first instance, the Leicestershire Justices dismissed the 
charges on the grounds that although the words used (i.e. “Wogs”, “Pakis” 
and “Black Bastards”) were offensive they were not of a gross nature. Lord 
Bingham observed that, unlike Section 1 of the MCA, Section 127 did not 
criminalise communications which individuals find annoying or offensive. 
The question whether a message is “grossly offensive” is one of fact and 
based on the “standards of an open and just multi-racial society, and that 
the words must be judged taking account of their context and all relevant 
circumstances” (paragraph 9). Furthermore, Section 127(1) will be triggered 
as soon the communication has been sent. This can be contrasted with 
Section 127(2) where there is explicit reference to the requirement of proof 
relating to the unlawful purpose and knowledge of the sender of the mes-
sage. Lord Bingham was, however, keen to emphasise that some degree of 
culpability must be evidenced. As Lord Carswell made it clear, the essence 
of Section 127(1) is “whether reasonable persons in our society would find it 
grossly offensive” (2006: 21).
Protection of Harassment Act 1997
New communication technologies allow individuals to repeatedly target 
their victims through mobile phones, emails and social networking sites. 
For the conduct to amount to harassment, the following elements in Section 
1, Protection of Harassment Act (PHA) 1977, must be established:
1. There must be a course of conduct. In other words, a single act or com-
munication would not suffice. Section 7(3) states that a “course of con-
duct” must, in relation to a single person, involve conduct on at least two 
occasions in relation to that person. For example, in Lau v DPP (2000) it 
was held that where there was an interval between the first and the se-
cond act, both acts would not be regarded as a course of conduct. Where 
the interval between each act is not significant, the court may take the 
view that the incidents are sufficiently linked to constitute a course of 
conduct. In Kelly v DPP (2003), the offender left three messages in the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 127
victim’s voice mail. These three messages were left within a space of five 
minutes. The court held that the communications constituted a course of 
conduct. The “course of conduct” requirement will also be satisfied if the 
perpetrator sends an SMS text on one occasion and then follows up with 
an email or physical exchange. Finally, it needs to be shown that there 
is a link between each corresponding act before there can be said to be 
a “course of conduct”. In Pratt v DPP (2001) Latham LJ stated that pros-
ecuting authorities should be hesitant about using this particular offence 
in circumstances ... where there are only a small number of incidents. 
They should ensure that what they are seeking the court to adjudicate 
upon can properly fall within the category of behaviour which is behav-
iour causing harassment of the other, not merely that there have been 
two or more incidents (paragraph 12).
2. The course of conduct must constitute harassment. According to the Home 
Office, a course of conduct which alarms the victim or causes the victim 
distress will satisfy this requirement (Home Office, 2001). In Majrowski v 
Guy’s and St Thomas’s NHS Trust (2007), Lord Birkenhead noted that the 
Act was aimed at all forms of harassment wherever it occurs but noted 
that a distinction needed to be made between the upset and annoyances 
encountered in dealings with people and those which warrant the im-
position of criminal liability (paragraph 30). In Esther Thomas v News 
Group Newspapers Limited, Simon Hughes (2001), Lord Phillips ventured to 
suggest that a much higher threshold was needed for prosecutions under 
this legislation:
There are many actions that foreseeably alarm or cause a person dis-
tress that could not possibly be described as harassment. It seems to 
me that Section 7 is dealing with that element of the offence which is 
constituted by the effect of the conduct rather than with the types of 
conduct that produce that effect.
The Act does not attempt to define the type of conduct that is capable 
of constituting harassment. “Harassment” is, however, a word which 
has a meaning which is generally understood. It describes conduct tar-
geted at an individual which is calculated to produce the consequences 
described in Section 7 and which is oppressive and unreasonable. (para-
graphs 29–30)
3. The accused must know or ought to know that the conduct amounts to 
harassment. Under Section 1(1)(b) if an accused knows that his actions 
constitute harassment, this requirement will be met. The section also 
provides an alternative, where an objective test can be applied. For ex-
ample, a defendant’s lack of awareness that his actions were harassing the 
victim will not be a defence if any reasonable person would regard the 
conduct as harassment. In R v Colohan (2001) it was stated that the rea-
sonable person test would not include the particular characteristics of the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

128 Online Child Safety
accused. The accused in this case sought to argue that his course of con-
duct was reasonable in view of the fact that he was diagnosed as a schizo-
phrenic. This argument was rejected by the court on the grounds that 
permitting such an interpretation into the construction of the statute 
would prevent the PHA from achieving its primary purpose, namely, to 
give protection to victims of harassment. An accused convicted under 
the PHA faces six months’ imprisonment or a fine. Where the accused 
has been convicted for the offence in Section 4, which is the course of 
conduct causing another fear that violence would be used against the 
victim, the maximum term of imprisonment is five years or a fine (cf. 
Sections 1(2) and 4(4)).
It is well-known that many victims of crimes and witnesses find the 
criminal justice system intimidating, burdensome and slow. With the ex-
ception of blatant cases of abuse and victimisation, children tend to be 
reluctant to report incidents of online bullying and victimisation to par-
ents or educators – uncertainty or lack of awareness as to their legal rights, 
embarrassment, and fear of parental or peer disapproval (Chamberlain et 
al., 2010). One major drawback in using the criminal law to address the 
problems of peer victimisation is that in many instances, a prosecution is 
unlikely to be launched without the victim providing or obtaining rele-
vant and admissible evidence in support of the claims. The absence of a 
“course of conduct” or evidence produced showing that the communica-
tion was fair comment or regarded as not being “grossly” offensive are just 
some of the difficulties victims face in satisfying the legal and eviden-
tiary threshold. Peer victimisation through the use of Web 2.0 technolo-
gies may appear to upset the traditional balance struck in the provisions 
made by the criminal law. Some take the view that the criminal should 
intervene. Others regard the use of the criminal law as an inappropriate 
response when the harm perpetrated on the victim is not regarded as 
coming within existing rules on assault, harassment or malicious com-
munications (Sampson, 2002). As the Anti-Bullying Alliance noted in its 
submission to the Select Committee on Behaviour and Discipline in Schools:4
Bullying behaviour can be complex and difficult to manage. There are 
times where access to specialist intervention is vital–such as with cases 
of sexual bullying. There may also be a need for particular support for 
children who are vulnerable to bullying, or who have been damaged 
by bullying–and similarly there may be a need for ongoing interven-
tion for children who display bullying behaviour ... Evidence suggests 
that it is more beneficial to involve those agencies whose primary role 
is to address disruptive behaviours rather than generic agencies like 
the police.

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 129
Technology-mediated victimisation is just the latest series of deviant be-
haviour which can impair the emotional well-being of victims. Cases like 
Tinker v Des Moines Independent Community SD (1969), Bethel School District 
No. 403 v Fraser (1986), Beussink v Woodland R-IV SD (1998), Morse v Frederick 
(2007) and JS v Blue Mountain (2007) underscore the view that problems of 
ill-discipline and disregard of appropriate civil conduct and behaviour are 
not easily accommodated within the criminal justice system (cf. civil meas-
ures under Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003: R v Katinas (Paul) (2010)). As Lord 
Birkenhead seems to imply in Majrowski v Guy’s and St Thomas’s NHS Trust 
(2007), individuals need to muster their own resources for self-help and re-
silience when dealing with the irritations, unpleasantness and annoyances 
that result from interacting with people, and that courts “are well able to rec-
ognise the boundary between conduct which is unattractive, even unreason-
able, and conduct which is oppressive and unacceptable” (paragraph 30).
Of course, where victimisation involves a course of conduct amounting 
to harassment, there are sound reasons why Parliament has regarded that it 
is in the public interest to prosecute individuals who have embarked on the 
prohibited conduct on at least two occasions (under the MCA) or engaged in 
anti-social behaviour. None of this helps children particularly as
the day-to-day adverse affects of bullying in damaging educational op-
portunities to students are as real as they are unnoticed ... [and] ... is a 
problem that affects the school performance, emotional well-being, 
mental health, and social development of school children. (TK, 2011: 6)
The Tellus4 Survey reported that two-fifths of the children surveyed had 
been bullied at least on a weekly basis, and that disability, age and ethnicity 
were often seen as contributory factors (Chamberlain et al., 2010: 36–7). 
Mencap noted an increase in the victimisation of individuals with a learn-
ing disability. Eight of out of ten children with learning disabilities have 
been the subject of bullying incidents (Mencap, 2007). The Schools Health 
Education Unit surveyed young lesbian, gay, bisexual people about their 
experiences in school and found that over 65 per cent of the respondents 
had been the target of bullying (Hunt et al., 2007). Pupils are entitled to 
protection under the Equality Act 2010, which requires schools and educa-
tors to take positive steps in preventing all forms of victimisation, harass-
ment and discrimination. In practical terms, the Equality Act 2010 requires 
education service providers to adopt reasonable measures which safeguard 
pupils from all forms of victimisation, including those related to disability, 
gender, sexual orientation, race and religion. More disconcerting is the fact 
that pupils are now being excluded from schools for engaging in a range 
of misconduct. The recent data for “exclusions” show that there were 50 
exclusions for bullying, 20 exclusions for racist abuse and 110 exclusions 
for sexual misconduct (DfE, 2010). Exclusions for persistent disruptive

130 Online Child Safety
behaviour in primary schools were now averaging 200 in primary schools 
and 1,710 in State-funded secondary schools (DfE, 2010). In view of the fact 
that incidents of peer victimisation tend to be under-reported, there is much 
to be said for developing and enforcing acceptable standards of behaviour 
by schools in collaboration with law enforcement and local education au-
thorities. Education providers in the United States and the United Kingdom, 
for example, have a statutory obligation to implement governance meas-
ures to promote the safety and well-being of pupils by eradicating peer vic-
timisation. For example, § 32261(g) of the Californian Code makes explicit 
that peer victimisation of any form and perpetrated by Web 2.0 technolo-
gies will result in disciplinary sanctions. The Washington Revised Code (§ 
28A.300.285) was enacted to deal with the limitations of existing criminal 
laws prohibiting peer victimisation and the varying successes of anti-har-
assment policies adopted by school districts. § 28A.300.285 aims to provide 
parents and students greater assurances regarding the safety protocols to be 
followed by all students; all education authorities are required to enforce 
the public interest in enabling students to learn and develop in a learning 
environment without fear of violence, intimidation and bullying. The State 
of Georgia has passed legislation requiring educational and school boards to 
adopt measures for enforcing safety rules and norms. For example, § 20–2-
751.4 deals with bullying taking place within the school, at school-related 
events or activities and at designated school bus stops. Unlike the provi-
sions contained in the criminal legislation the aim of these anti-bullying 
enactments (and like the one below) is to compel educators to adopt propor-
tionate and timely responses to peer victimisation. Schools in England and 
Wales are required under the Education Act 2002 to demonstrate that they 
have implemented anti-bullying policies (e.g. whole school policies dealing 
with the reporting and investigation of bullying incidents, supporting vic-
tims, equipping staff with bullying management strategies, and communi-
cating to staff and students the acceptable standards of behaviour required 
of them). The Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) Guide 
Safe to Learn has been adopted by many schools (DCSF, 2007). The Guide 
advocates a “whole school” multi-stakeholder governance approach, which 
embeds the principles of equality, Personal, Social, Health and Economic 
Education (PHSE) and citizenship curriculum, respect and non-discrimina-
tion into its action plan (Tippett et al., 2010: 85–90). A number of schools 
have adopted proactive anti-bullying strategies and measures (Howard 
et al., 2010: 158–60). For example, Saint Cecilia’s RC Infant and Nursery 
School in Liverpool organises home visits to families of children in the new 
intake, implements a playground buddy scheme and has set up a school 
council overseeing student welfare and well-being issues. The Woodside 
Community Primary in Dudley has anti-bullying strategies and support 
schemes involving all its staff and pupils. The Peatmoor Community 
Primary in Swindon has adopted similar schemes and provides an effective 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 131
auditing and recording system for bullying incidents. It also makes avail-
able adult mediation services to its pupils. Finally, the Beavers Community 
Primary in Hounslow is a UN International Children’s Emergency Fund 
(UNICEF)-accredited Rights Respecting School. It provides a buddy scheme, 
has a value-based curriculum and equips children with conflict manage-
ment skills.
It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness 
of all these positive measures aimed at reducing the level of peer victimisa-
tion experienced by children. That said, these policies could be regarded as 
proactive measures aimed at embedding extra-legal standards and mecha-
nisms to complement the overarching regulatory framework provided by 
the criminal law. These proactive interventions are significant in that they 
now create obligations which local board of education authorities must 
comply with. For example, schools will now be required to make clear to 
all students the type of conduct which is now prohibited and the sanctions 
that accompany violation of school policies. Students and parents of stu-
dents are expected to be notified of these rules and the information is to be 
included in student and parent handbooks. Teachers and school employees 
are also required to alert the school principal if they have credible infor-
mation that a pupil may be the possible target of bullying. Most important 
of all, schools will be required to demonstrate that they now take peer vic-
timisation seriously by developing procedures for counselling, reporting, 
investigating and disciplining. These anti-bullying enactments facilitate the 
creation of a MSIG framework, which enable schools to develop policies, 
measures and strategies that will create a toxic-free learning environment 
(New York Education Law, §§ 10–17 (2010)). The extension of the acceptable 
behaviour rules and norms both during school and after school hours is a 
clear recognition that as Web 2.0 technologies become an integral part of 
children’s lives, there are significant opportunities for deviancy and victim-
isation to be perpetrated. Finally, the sanctions for violating school policies 
prohibiting bullying – counselling, parental/teacher intervention, suspen-
sion or exclusion – are preferable where clear violations of the criminal law 
have not taken place.
Some general comments can be offered by way of conclusion with regard 
to the interaction between criminal law rules and norms on the one hand 
and the role of schools in promoting greater awareness amongst children 
about their rights and responsibilities in managing their online and off-
line interactions on the other. First, the uncomfortable or uneasy truth, for 
those who view the First Amendment rights or the Judiciary as being ob-
structive, is that the criminal law does not provide sanctions for all forms 
of unpleasant speech (as noted above). This is probably a reflection of the 
balance the criminal law attempts to strike between the instances where 
State intervention is deemed to be necessary and those situations where 
there is an expectation that organisations, schools, parents and individuals 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

132 Online Child Safety
develop effective strategies for managing risks encountered by children in 
their daily lives. This is one reading of the various pieces of legislation and 
measures noted above. These developments also seem to be in line with the 
balance struck between protected and unprotected speech. Indeed, the rules 
outlined in each of the areas of legislation correspond with the observations 
made by Supreme Court in Tinker v Des Moines Independent Community School 
District (1969). Mr Justice Fortas indicated that curbs on students expecta-
tions to express their ideas and thoughts need to be based on more than a 
“desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany 
an unpopular viewpoint” (393 US 503, 509). He emphasised that a student’s 
freedom of expression was not absolute, and that in appropriate circum-
stances curbs imposed must be supported by demonstrable evidence indi-
cating that other more important values in the education setting would be 
compromised (ibid). Where such evidence is forthcoming, limits on an indi-
vidual’s freedom of expression has been sanctioned by the courts. In Morse v 
Frederick (2007) a student alleged that his First Amendment rights had been 
violated by a ten-day suspension meted to him following his waving of a 
banner promoting drug use at an off-campus, school-approved activity. In 
holding that there was no violation of the student’s First Amendment rights, 
the Supreme Court stressed that a failure to act would have undermined the 
school policy prohibiting illegal drug use and would have sent conflicting 
signals to students at this event. Second, the reference to demonstrable evi-
dence showing a causal link between the conduct and the harm suffered 
suggests that alternative strategies need to be pursued which ensure that 
a child’s learning environment continues to be free from harassment and 
discrimination. Third, it may very well be that schools, parents and law en-
forcement could work together to augment the existing legal standards by 
focusing on those activities which continue to cause considerable anxiety 
amongst children and which can impair their ability to take full advan-
tage of the educational and development opportunities offered in school. 
It has already been remarked previously that schools have a legal basis for 
proscribing conduct which can materially and substantially undermine the 
proper conduct of educational activities.
Online intermediary: Filtering and liability issues
Before examining the principal regulatory framework that defines the scope 
of an online intermediary’s responsibility for safeguarding children in re-
lation to exposure to illegal or inappropriate content, under the Electronic 
Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, it should first be noted that there is no 
disagreement that illegal content should be blocked by ISPs and online ser-
vice providers. Just as in the offline environment, many will agree that chil-
dren should not have access to illegal and adult content. It does not come as 
a surprise that children’s access to illegal or age-inappropriate content has 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 133
re-ignited the well-documented debates on mandatory filtering of illegal 
and harmful content (House of Commons, 2007–8). ISPs and online service 
providers are seen as increasing children’s exposure to such content through 
the networks, communication platforms and services they make available. 
Kleinschmidt describes the relations between ISPs (broadly defined) and 
online users as founded on the performance of three functionalities: access, 
hosting and consumption (2010: 332). The reference by Kleinschmidt to a 
contractual nexus has a wider significance. First, it foreshadows the con-
tractual, technical and regulatory measures that underpin the strategies for 
mediating contact, content and conduct risks. Second, increasingly chil-
dren’s exposure to the risk-prone activities will require policymakers to also 
identify the context and levels in which each online intermediary can be 
expected to discharge its responsibilities as part of a MSIG strategy. Finally, 
when addressing content regulation and liability issues we need to also keep 
in mind that the online environment is now very much a conglomeration 
of services, markets and industries in the telecommunication, broadcasting 
and entertainment sector. Businesses like AOL, BT, Vodafone and O2, for 
example, provide voice, data and broadband Internet access packages to cus-
tomers. A number of online intermediaries may provide nothing more than 
a communications infrastructure and system capabilities – for example, indi-
viduals can through subscription or membership upload content for storage 
or distribution. Other online intermediaries enable individuals to generate 
their own content or engage in a wide range of interactions with anyone 
with an Internet access (e.g. Facebook, MySpace and blogs). Increasingly, 
the growing market in entertainment and online gaming has resulted in 
a proliferation of online intermediaries making available software applica-
tion and online multimedia communication platforms for individuals to 
play games, post videos and watch movies. Mobile phone providers, online 
gaming sites and social networking sites not surprisingly provide an array 
of services, including software applications, voice and network facilities. 
Despite the range of developments in new media and entertainment, it is 
safe to say that offline laws dealing with obscenity and child protection 
laws continue to be amenable to the issues raised by the use of the Internet 
to access, create, and store illegal and inappropriate content. In this context 
it should be noted that the BBFC has long adopted classification schemes 
that have informed the strategies adopted by online service providers and 
services in managing the flows of content across their networks or services. 
The current categories adopted by the BBFC are U, PG, 12A, 12, 15 and 18. 
Works which are rated “18” albeit legal are deemed to be unsuitable for 
children as they contain strong violence, frequent use of strong language 
and scenes of sexual activity and/or sexual violence. Individuals below the 
age of 18 years are not permitted to view or purchase films or videos of 
works rated at “18”. The “15” category films cover a wide range of “grown 
up” issues and have in the past included sexual activity, paedophilia, rape, 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

134 Online Child Safety
incest and genocide (e.g. Little Children, The Woodsman, Doubt, Sex and 
the City and Schindler’s List) (BBFC, 2011). The body classifies films on be-
half of Local Authorities in this country, who in turn license cinemas under 
the Licensing Act 2003. One of the conditions for licensing cinemas under 
the 2003 Act is that admission of children below the age of 18 years is to 
be restricted in accordance with the classification recommendations of the 
BBFC or the licensing authority. The Video Recordings Act 1984 provides 
the BBFC with the power to classify video works which are released as video 
recordings. Works within its terms of reference include films, video games 
and television programmes which are supplied on formats like tape, disc or 
other device capable of storing electronic data. Apart from videos, which 
are specifically exempted, all works must be classified by the BBFC. It is an 
offence to offer to supply unclassified material on video or DVD contrary to 
the provisions of the Video Recordings Act 1984. “Video on demand” con-
tent regulation in the United Kingdom is now overseen by the Association 
for Television on Demand (ATVOD). Increasingly, as video works are dis-
tributed in alternative formats (e.g. downloads or streaming) a voluntary 
classification scheme is provided under BBFC.online. The general principles 
of facilitating public access to a wide range of works and informed decision-
making are, however, qualified in three main respects. First, the BBFC will 
not classify material if it either is in conflict with the law or has been pro-
duced through the commission of a criminal offence. Second, the BBFC may 
require selected parts of the work to be cut, if it is to be made available for 
screening in cinemas or distributed in a video or DVD format (e.g. moral 
harm, desensitising a viewer to the effects of violence, glorifying abuse, en-
couraging unhealthy fantasies amongst children) (cf. R (on the application of 
British Board of Film Classification) v Video Appeals Committee (2008)). Third, 
the BBFC may intervene to recommend a re-classification, if the material is 
likely to be viewed as unacceptable to general public opinion (e.g. filthy lan-
guage may be deemed inappropriate for “12” rating). As a public authority, 
the BBFC aims to ensure that “regulated works” do not infringe child pro-
tection laws like the PCA 1978 and the OPA 1959 and 1964. 
Content regulation issues can arise in a number of ways. For example, by 
virtue of Section 1(1)(b) of the PCA 1978, an online intermediary can be 
prosecuted for displaying indecent photographs (or pseudo-photographs), 
for being in possession of such contents or for facilitating access to others. 
Section 1(1)(d) of the PCA also makes it an offence to publish or cause to be 
published any advertisement likely to be understood as conveying that the 
advertiser distributes or shows such indecent photographs (or pseudo-photo-
graphs), or intends to do so. ISPs and newsgroups need to be on the alert for 
hosting discussion groups and forums which imply that they are a repository 
or venue for those with prurient interests in children or extreme pornography. 
Whilst it is understandable that online intermediaries can and should play 
an important part in reinforcing existing standards and laws, it would not 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 135
have gone unnoticed that regulating content which may be age-inappropri-
ate or potentially viewed as harmful is more problematic (R (on the application 
of British Board of Film Classification) v Video Appeals Committee (2008) – 
“classification with regard to Manhunt 2”). Many filtering strategies and 
liability rules attach particular importance to parents and educators deter-
mining the appropriateness of content for viewing by minors. One thing is 
clear: content regulation and legal standards and rules have been extended 
across a number of online service providers and bring within the child 
protection remit a diverse range of content, multimedia communication 
platforms and services. For example, in pursuance of obligations entered 
under the Cybercrime Convention and its protocols, guidelines have been 
provided to enable law enforcement and ISPs to coordinate their activities. 
ISPs make efforts to minimise the use of their services by third parties for 
criminal activities and report suspected criminal activity taking place on 
their communication platforms. ISPs rely on filtering software to regulate 
online content. For example, software is used to block or filter content by 
the use of blocklists. These blocklists may comprise blacklisted websites, IP 
addresses and Internet addresses (URLs). Some online service providers use 
deep packet inspection technology to filter illegal content like child abuse 
and child pornography. The filtering technology can be used to monitor 
all forms of online traffic and information requests (e.g. search engines, 
websites, emails and downloading of content). Many ISPs and online service 
providers automatically filter information security threats and illegal con-
tent. Finally, as will be noted later, requests from law enforcement author-
ities to block and filter racist, hate and other illegal content are usually acted 
upon quickly by ISPs, mobile phone providers and social networking sites.
As can be seen from this brief account, filtering already operates at the net-
work, product and search levels. The end-user interface is also provided with 
blocking and filtering functionalities. Online service providers increasingly 
provide users, including parents and educators, with software tools to assist 
them in determining the type of content that be accessed and viewed by chil-
dren. The age and content classification categories, for example, provided by the 
BBFC and Pan European Games Industry (PEGI) equip parents with informa-
tion so that decisions regarding children’s access to online entertainment and 
computer games are consistent with safeguarding children’s safety and well-
being norms. In a recent survey it was suggested that many providers of games 
in eighteen European countries were incorporating child protection norms 
and principles into their practices (ISFE, 2010). Compliance with these codes is 
seen as minimising children’s exposure to illegal or inappropriate user-gener-
ated content or adult website URLs. Parents, for example, are also provided with 
information relating to age-appropriate and content categories (e.g. violence, 
nudity, drug use, inappropriate language and discrimination). Additionally, like 
the BBFC, many online service providers provide parents with “extended clas-
sification information” so that they have a better understanding of the issues

which informed the classification decisions. In passing, it should be noted 
that the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission 
(CRTC) does not regulate content on the Internet. Even though ISP filtering 
is not mandatory, the governance framework with regard to the regulation of 
content consists of a combination of national laws, industry codes of practice 
(i.e. Canadian Association of Internet Providers “Code of Conduct”), use of 
content filtering software and contractual terms (i.e. “Acceptance Use Policy”). 
The Project “Cleanfeed Canada” involves a MSIG approach comprising the 
Canadian Coalition against Internet Child Exploitation (CCAICE), a group 
which includes Cybertip.ca, ISPs, federal and provincial governments and law 
enforcement. Participating ISPs include major service providers like Bell, MTS 
allstream, TELUS, SaskTell, Rogers, Videotron, SHAW and Aliant. The content 
filtering process involves the creation and use of a regularly updated block-
list of national and foreign-based URLs which contain child abuse images. 
These are made available to participating ISPs, who automatically filter the 
content without any end-user intervention. Project “Cleanfeed Canada” does 
not, however, maintain a log of traffic accessing the sites; ISPs, as is the case in 
countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, are not law 
enforcement agencies and filtering software is not regarded as a law enforce-
ment tool. In Australia, the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (as amended) 
now subjects online intermediaries to regulatory oversight by ACMA. ACMA is 
responsible for monitoring the broadcasting, Internet and commercial content 
service industry (Section 5). It also undertakes investigations into reports from 
the public about illegal, prohibited or offensive online content, including those 
from the Internet and mobile phones. Prohibited content for the purposes of 
the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) is defined by clause 20 of Schedule 
7 if they come within the restricted content classification system adopted 
in this country. In 2007 ACMA drafted new rules, set out in the Restricted 
Access System Declaration 2007. The existence of fines for non-compliance 
with industry standards and codes of practice provides a sufficient incentive 
for removing illegal content online in particular (Coroneos, 2008). As online 
intermediaries make audiovisual media increasingly accessible through multi-
media platforms a number of technological measures and codes of practice 
have been adopted.
The rules on filtering and liability of these online service providers attempt 
to balance market innovation and child protection goals (McCarthy, 2010). 
To this end, policymakers have increasingly shown a preference for a MSIG 
strategy whereby online intermediaries assume a primary role in developing 
measures and policies that enhance the safety of children when using their 
services and communication platforms (ITU, 2009d,e; Dutton et al., 2007). 
Akdeniz, in his review of the role of ISPs in this area of governance, advo-
cates a more temperate approach since overregulation may have “a chill-
ing effect on the development of the Internet” (2008: 231). There has been 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 137
a preference amongst policymakers to require industry to develop online 
child safety measures that minimise children’s exposure to contact, con-
tent and conduct risks. Some have expressed serious concerns about recent 
calls for ISPs to monitor and regulate online activity and communications. 
The frameworks favoured by EU policymakers comprises “hard” and “soft” 
law measures (e.g. laws and codes of practice). Many online intermediaries, 
national regulatory bodies and organisations now form part of the INHOPE 
network as part of the child protection MSIG policymaking strategy. Within 
the INHOPE network of hotlines, 26 European countries now work with law 
enforcement in removing illegal content found in the online environment. 
Additionally, the move towards self-regulation by the industry can be seen 
in part as a direct response to avoiding additional layers of regulatory inter-
vention. Internet service providers and intermediaries like mobile phone 
and content providers, social networking sites in particular, are already sub-
ject to a range of industry-wide standards and regulations. The European 
Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Young Teenagers and Children has as one of 
its goals the implementation by mobile phone providers of technical and 
regulatory processes aimed at reducing the availability and supply of illegal 
content in the online environment. In 2009, major social networking site 
services providers subscribed to a set of principles aimed at empowering 
parents, educators and children in managing online risks. These develop-
ments will be addressed in more detail in Chapters 6 and 7. Apart from a 
situation where an information services provider actively engages in the 
hosting, making or distribution of obscene or child abuse content, most on-
line intermediaries within the EU adhere to the legal obligations set out in 
the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC.
The principal framework regarding the liability issues of online information 
services providers is that set out in Articles 12–15 of the Electronic Commerce 
Directive 2000/31/EC. As the preamble to the EC Directive indicates:
The exemptions from liability established in this Directive cover only 
cases where the activity of the information society service provider is 
limited to the technical process of operating and giving access to a com-
munication network over which information made available by third 
parties is transmitted or temporarily stored, for the sole purpose of mak-
ing the transmission more efficient; this activity is of a mere technical, 
automatic and passive nature, which implies that the information society 
service provider has neither knowledge of nor control over the informa-
tion which is transmitted or stored. (paragraph 42)
Online intermediaries can only lay claim to immunity if they bring their 
actions within a limited range of defences. The defences apply to informa-
tion or intermediary service providers. An “information society service” is

defined in terms of any “service normally provided for remuneration, at a 
distance, by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including 
digital compression) and storage of data, and at the individual request of a 
recipient of a service” (Art 2(a) of the Directive 2000). For example, where an 
information service provider is deemed to be a “mere conduit” in the provi-
sion of Internet access or provides transmission services, that provider will 
not be liable for illegal information transmitted but only if three conditions 
have been met. First, it must be shown that the provider had not initiated 
the transmission. Second that the provider did not have a part to play in the 
selection of the receiver of the transmission. Finally, that the provider did 
not assume any editorial role in the information transmitted. Under Article 
13, no legal liability arises for the online information services provision in 
the absence of any interference in the communication, or if the provider
acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information it has 
stored upon obtaining actual knowledge of the fact that the information 
at the initial source of the transmission has been removed from the net-
work, or access to it has been disabled, or that a court or an administra-
tive authority has ordered such removal or disablement. (Article 13(e))
Whilst this automatic storage process will not trigger infringement mecha-
nisms, a court order or notification from an administrative authority, in 
accordance with the legal rules of the Member State, can be relied upon to 
require a service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement. Article 
14 addresses the situation where online intermediaries provide individuals 
and organisations with online facilities that enable them to store informa-
tion. As a general rule, the online intermediary is not liable for information 
stored on the website of the recipient of the service if the following condi-
tions are met:
(a) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or in-
formation and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts or 
circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is appar-
ent; or
(b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts exped-
itiously to remove or to disable access to the information.
In Godfrey v Demon Internet Ltd (1999) the failure by an ISP to act exped-
itiously after being notified of a possible defamatory posting being trans-
mitted from its servers was deemed to give rise to civil liability. Of course, 
if the recipient of the service is acting under the authority of the online 
intermediary or if the service provider controls a website where content is 
uploaded different considerations may apply. In Kaschke v Gray (2010) Stadlen 
J declined to grant a summary judgment in favour of an information service 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 139
provider with regard to a defamatory posting on a website controlled by it, 
since it was unclear whether the provider could demonstrate that it came 
within the hosting exemption. Additionally, the Article permits Member 
States’ legal systems to enact procedures where a service provider could be 
required to terminate or prevent an infringement, either through removing 
or disabling access to information. To minimise potential exposure to legal 
liabilities, most members of the Internet Service Providers Association 
(ISPA) adopt a “notice and take down” policy. More controversially perhaps 
is Article 15, which states that online intermediaries are under no general 
obligation to monitor content. This exemption extends to online intermedi-
aries and clearly has governance implications (e.g. there is no incentive to 
being proactive and monitoring illegal or harmful communications since 
this would result in the immunity being lost). However, paragraph 2 does 
provide a limited avenue for Member States to create mechanisms and pro-
cedures whereby information society service providers can be required to re-
port to competent public authorities of alleged illegal activities undertaken 
by recipients of their services or identification of these recipients. These and 
related matters will be elaborated further in our discussion in Chapter 6. 
One criticism often made in relation to the 2000 Directive is that the “mere 
conduit” defence paradoxically prevents hosts of websites and online com-
munication services who are best placed to deal with the type of illegal 
or inappropriate content before it is accessed by the individual from doing 
so. The effect of Articles 13 and 14 is that online intermediaries would be 
excluded from the immunity these provisions make available, should steps 
be taken to monitor online activity. In Bunt v Tilley (2006) Eady J held that 
the imposition of legal liability on an ISP would depend on there being dem-
onstrable evidence of awareness of personal responsibility being assumed. 
Clearly, Article 13 presupposes the absence of knowledge as a condition pre-
cedent to the “mere conduit” defence, whilst Article 14 obligates hosting 
service providers to remove content or disable access to the services upon 
notification.
In the United States, 47 USCA § 230 deals with the position of online 
intermediaries liability for third party’s actions. Section 230(c), for example, 
states that a provider or user of an interactive computer service shall not 
be treated as “the publisher or speaker of any information provided by an-
other content provider”. For the purposes of the Act, § 230 (f) (2) defines an 
“interactive computer service” as “any information service, system, or access 
software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users 
to a computer server”. As a general rule the owner and operator of a social 
networking website is not regarded as an information content provider, and 
consequently can rely on the provisions under the Act as defence to civil 
and criminal actions (Cubby v CompuServe (1991); Stratton Oakmont, Inc. v 
Prodigy Services Co (1995); Zeran v AOL (2002) 159). In Doe v MySpace Inc 
(2007) an attempt by a parent to hold the social networking site liable for 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

140 Online Child Safety
the harm suffered by her daughter was unsuccessful. The minor in this case 
met an online sexual predator on the social networking site. He lured her to 
an offline meeting and assaulted her. The Court held that the online inter-
mediary was not an information content provider and consequently the 
civil suit against MySpace failed (2007: 850). The Court also observed, obiter, 
the plaintiff’s claims to be unwarranted, particularly as the child “lied about 
her actual age to bypass the age requirement and then violated MySpace’s 
express rules by giving out her personal information” (2007: 850).
§ 230(1) regards Internet service providers and social networking sites as 
“interactive computer service providers” and consequently they would not 
be treated as publishers or speakers of any information transmitted on their 
communication networks or services. § 223 provides online intermediaries 
with defences to criminal prosecutions arising from a third party’s misuse 
of the communication networks and services to post, request or engage in 
any communication which is obscene, or child pornography, or used with 
intent to harass or victimise another individual. An online intermediary 
will not be found to have violated the provisions for hosting obscene child 
pornography or facilitate harassment by virtue of
providing access or connection to or from a facility, system, or network 
not under that person’s control, including transmission, downloading, 
intermediate storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are 
incidental to providing such access or connection that does not include 
the creation of the content of the communication. (§ 223(e)(1))
However, this defence is not available if the online intermediary is found 
to be complicit in the act of creating or shown to be engaged in knowing 
distribution of communications in violation of the statutory provisions. 
Under Federal Law, information service providers are under an obligation 
to report any information they obtain which indicates the violation of 
child pornography laws to CyberTipline at the NCMEC as soon as reason-
ably possible (42 USC 13032). In passing, it should be observed that many 
schools and libraries assume the role of “online gatekeepers” by utilising 
blocking and filtering technology to regulate the content that is accessed 
by children at these venues. In the United States, the Children’s Internet 
Protection Act (CIPA) provides a regulatory framework which addresses 
concerns about children’s exposure to illegal or inappropriate content 
when accessing the Internet on school and library computers. In United 
States v. American Library Association (2003) it was held that the use of filter-
ing software on computers in public libraries accessed by children did not 
abridge the free speech provisions. The use of such software was regarded 
as being consistent with the public interest in preventing children from 
accessing materials harmful to them from these terminals. Some legisla-
tures in the United States now require Internet service providers to provide 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 141
filtering software to prevent transmission of harmful content to minors fol-
lowing a request from a consumer (Utah Code § 76–10-1231). Obligations 
also extend to the provision of a hyperlink to online sites, which provide 
free filtering software (Tex. Bus. & Comm. Code §§ 35.101 to 35.103), and 
to make available parental monitoring and filtering services and software 
(Nev. Rev. Stat. § 603.100 to 603.170). We can see similar trends taking place 
in other jurisdictions where legislation and codes of practice are used to 
create a flexible co-regulatory governance framework. One example is the 
Canadian Criminal Code, C-15A, which has been amended by Criminal 
Law Amendment Act 2001. Section 164.1(1) provides that if a judge is satis-
fied by information on oath that there are reasonable grounds for believing 
that an online intermediary has illegal content on its computer system, 
which can be accessed by third parties, a custodian of the computer system 
order can be issued to
(a) give an electronic copy of the material to the court;
(b) ensure that the material is no longer stored on and made available 
through the computer system; and
(c) provide the information necessary to identify and locate the person 
who posted the material.
In terms of future governance strategies or likely legal intervention regard-
ing the role of online intermediaries, a debate needs to be had with regard 
to the availability of the “immunity” harbours for online services provid-
ers like social networking sites and mobile and content service providers 
like YouTube, Facebook and MySpace (APPCG, 2009: 5) One issue raised in 
the report published by All Party Parliamentary Communications Group 
(APPCG) was whether sites, which enabled users to create, store and dis-
tribute user-generated content, should be expected to exercise greater care 
and vigilance. There have been concerns expressed by parents and educa-
tors that social networking sites and portals hosting user-generated content 
should be permitted to rely on the “mere conduit” defence when users of its 
services post malicious or harmful content. The ISPA UK takes a different 
view and suggests that there is a legitimate distinction to be made between 
the deployment of filters at a network level to capture child abuse content 
and the need for a proactive role being advocated in other cases (e.g. file 
sharing and inappropriate postings). According to Virgin Media:
questions about when and how ISPs should act to deal with different 
types of traffic are as much to do with ensuring that we maintain cus-
tomer confidence and opinion. The public’s attitude towards manage-
ment of their on-line behaviour is far from consistent. When it comes to 
issues of child protection, or racist or terrorist websites, there is almost 
universal agreement that ISPs should take action. However in a number 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

142 Online Child Safety
of other areas, there is far from unanimous agreement on the lengths to 
which ISPs should act. (APPCG, 2009: paragraph 42)
That the law should discourage “good Samaritans” may seem to be sur-
prising, as the following response by the Children’s Charities Coalition on 
Internet Safety to the House of Lords Select Committee notes:
the Directive threatens to punish the responsible company that wants to 
engage proactively to do the right thing, and it rewards the provider who 
is happy just to sit back and wait to be told there is a problem. Again, that 
cannot be right. (House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, 
2007–8: 25).
Evidentiary considerations
As voice, data and video signals become the medium through which online 
criminal activity take place, law enforcement authorities increasingly turn 
to communications data and intercept evidence as part of their investiga-
tion strategy. Under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, 
the interception of any communication of a person in the United Kingdom 
must be consistent with the rule of law (Rotaru v Romania (2000); Liberty v 
UK (2008); Iordachi v Moldova (2009)). In Liberty v UK (2008) the European 
Court of Human Rights made it clear that interception of communications 
must take into account an individual’s human rights, in particular Article 
8 of the ECHR. The enactment of RIPA 2000 is believed to have addressed 
some of the shortcomings of the previous law. Certain public authorities, 
including law enforcement authorities, are permitted to acquire communi-
cations data from Communication Service Providers (CSPs). The procedures 
for accessing the communication data are subject to the safeguards provided 
in RIPA and the Code of Practice. “Communications data” comprises the 
“who”, “when” and “where” of a communication session (Interception of 
Communications Commissioner, 2010: 7). The request for communications 
data can be made to CSPs and ISPs. Public authorities made 525,130 requests 
to these organisations for the year ending December 2009. This number was 
an increase from the request made in the previous year (504,073), and it is in 
large part attributed to police forces investigating Internet-related criminal 
activity, and consequently require access to communications data (ibid., 
2010: 8). It is beyond the scope of this work to engage in an assessment of 
the RIPA. Instead, the focus will be on the nature of digital information and 
the use of entrapment by law enforcement in prosecuting individuals for 
child sex offences.
Digital evidence increasingly plays an important part in linking an of-
fender to the crime. Casey describes digital evidence as “any data stored 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 143
or transmitted using a computer that support or refute a theory of how an 
offense occurred or that address critical elements of the offense such as in-
tent or alibi” (Casey, 2004: 12). The evidence comprises information stored 
on, received or transmitted by an electronic device, which can be used 
for investigation (Carrier et al., 2003). The evidence can also include the 
history of MSN messages, the sending and receipt of web-based emails, IP 
addresses, access logins and the “sent folder”, all of which can help investi-
gators link the suspect to the crime scene. Without real evidence of crimes 
having taken place online, the allegations and complaints can descend to 
assessing the probative value of one person’s word against another. Digital 
evidence can help minimise potential problems in prosecuting individu-
als for engaging in activities like online sexual solicitation, possession and 
distribution of illegal content and engaging children in non-contact sexual 
activity (Casey, 2004: 96–100). The absence of relevant and admissible data 
can prevent the court acceding to the prosecution’s claim that a crime had 
been committed. For example, in R v Grout (Phillip) (2011) the accused was 
charged with the offences of engaging a child in sexual activity and in-
citing the child to engage in sexual activity. The facts can be summarised. 
Following a complaint made to the police in relation to text messages of a 
sexual nature being sent by the accused to a minor, the former was inter-
viewed. The allegations made by the complainant were put to him and on 
the advice of his solicitor, the accused refused to answer any further ques-
tions. The accused was subsequently arrested and his computer and mobile 
phone were searched. Following the investigation, and in particular after 
the collection of the digital evidence, law enforcement discovered that the 
available text and MSN conversations between the parties could not be 
used to support the allegation regarding the accused’s violation of child 
sex laws. There were two reasons for the difficulties faced by prosecution. 
First, the accused’s computer had been re-formatted before the arrest, and 
consequently the history of the entire MSN conversations linking him to 
the allegations made by the complainant were unavailable. Second, the dif-
ficulties were further compounded by the fact that the accused had previ-
ously deleted all the text messages he had sent to the complainant. It should 
have been apparent then, from the type and quality of evidence gathered, 
that if the accused was to be prosecuted successfully for the offences under 
Section 8(1) of the SOA 2003, something more than the complaint would 
have been required. Instead, prosecution decided to present the available 
evidence to the jury. The absence of incriminating digital evidence proved 
fatal to the claim that the appellant had caused the complainant to engage 
in “sexual activity” or for that matter, the lack of any such evidence estab-
lishing incitement under Section 8(1). This case merely serves to illustrate 
the particular characteristics of digital evidence that can leave prosecution 
open to defence objections to both its relevance and its use in court.
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

144 Online Child Safety
With regard to digital evidence generally, questions regarding its authenti-
city, integrity and confidentiality may be grounds for rendering potentially 
incriminating evidence of online criminal activity seized from computers 
and websites inadmissible (R. c. Boudreau-Fontaine (2010); US v Comprehensive 
Drug Testing II (2010); US v Runyan (2001)). Consequently, as the Locard 
Exchange Principles (Table 3.9) show, it is important for prosecution to en-
sure that the integrity and authenticity of evidence linking the victim and 
suspect to the crime scene are not called into question or that its seizure 
does not violate the latter’s constitutional or human rights.
The rules on admissibility and the processes for collecting, preserving 
and presenting digital evidence must be borne in mind during any investi-
gation and prosecution phase (Walden, 2010: 604–6; Miller, 2003: 119). 
Carrier views digital evidence as comprising an important part of an inves-
tigation where the aim of the investigation is to identify, collect and ana-
lyse evidence that will enable questions about particular events or the 
criminality of the suspect’s activities to be constructed (Carrier, et al., 2006). 
Digital evidence now provides law enforcement with additional sources of 
information during the investigation process. For example, the offender’s 
online sexual activities with regard to a minor in R v KJ Butcher (2009) only 
came to light when the parents stumbled on these communications on 
their child’s computer. Following a search of the child’s computer, law en-
forcement discovered a series of incriminating evidence linking the of-
fender to the crimes for which he was subsequently convicted. The data 
provided by the ISP showed that the computer owned by the offender was 
used to communicate with the child at the relevant times when the conver-
sations were deemed to have taken place, and that the offender was the

person engaging in the conversation which formed the substance of the 
charge. Other evidence extracted from the child’s computer included logs 
of chat room conversations, messages which disclosed the making of sev-
eral sexual overtures to the child (e.g. asking her to show her breasts via the 
web camera, which she acceded to, and discussions relating to the purchase 
and use of sex aids) and a series of communications attempting to persuade 
her to meet him for sexual activity. The communications also revealed that 
the accused was aware that the girl was a minor. The evidence gathered 
from both the computer and the child led to the accused being charged 
and convicted of causing or inciting M, a child under 13 years, to engage in 
sexual activity contrary to Section 8(1) of the SOA 2003, and causing or 
inciting a child to engage in sexual activity contrary to Section 10(1) of the 
SOA 2003. The computer can also provide valuable information of the 
“crime scene” or even indicate if the accused was the person who commit-
ted the crime using the computer. For example, in respect of a charge for 
possessing child pornography, images found on an accused’s hard drive can 
be regarded in effect as constituting the crime scene (e.g. possession), and 
the evidence gathered in accordance with the principles on collection and 
preservation can be treated as relevant and admissible incriminating evi-
dence (US v Tucker (2002)). In US v Reniger (2010), the ISP, Cox Communications 
was served with an administrative subpoena compelling a court-authorised 
disclosure of the account details of the user whose IP address was found to 
be making available child pornography content to other P2P users. It is, 
however, important that prosecution establish that the accused is guilty of 
the crime for which he is being charged. In US v Beatty (2009) the accused 
was charged for possession and distribution offences relating to child sexual 
images contrary to 18 USC §§ 2252(a)(2) and 2252(a)(4)(B), respectively. The 
accused was identified through his IP number when using a Gnutella file-
sharing network. IP addresses are useful signifiers of location. After further 
investigation, the accused was traced to his home address and a search war-
rant was obtained to search his premises and computer. The accused’s com-
puter was found to contain hundreds of illegal content involving children. 
However, failure to provide evidence linking the accused to the alleged 
offences can be fatal. In R v Lamb (2010) prosecution charged the accused 
for one count of making available child pornography content via the 
LimeWire software programme, contrary to Section 163.1(3) of the Criminal 
Code. Evidence was produced showing that a shared folder from the 
accused’s IP address at certain specified times made available the illegal 
content and that the alleged activities could only have taken place on his 
computer. When the computer was seized from the accused’s premises, it 
was found that the Port and GUID numbers matched the LimeWire 
 programme from the particular installation. Crucially, the illegal content 
was not found in the shared folder of the accused’s computer and prosecu-
tion was unable establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

146 Online Child Safety
accused who made the child pornography content available on the day in 
question. It appears that the accused’s computer was not password protected 
and that it could have been accessed and used by other persons living in the 
same residence. In other investigations, failure to obtain digital data in the 
form of history and chat logs prevented the successful prosecution of an 
accused. For example, in Paul Savage v R (2010) the Court of Appeal in the 
Supreme Court of Victoria held that three counts of committing an in-
decent act with or in the presence of a child under the age of 16 had to be 
quashed on the grounds that the evidence gathered from the mobile phones 
of a number of complainants and those of the suspect were insufficient to 
amount to evidence of offences having been committed. The Internet and 
communication technologies can also introduce a number of complications 
into the process of detecting, investigating and prosecuting offences against 
children. A report issued in 2009 by Statistics Canada pointed to the logis-
tical and technological challenges facing law enforcement in Canada when 
investigating and prosecuting Internet child luring incidents (Laughlin 
et al., 2009). The report covered investigations spanning the years 2006 and 
2007. From the 464 cases of Internet child luring considered, it was found 
that 64 per cent of the incidents reported were not solved. Individuals can 
make use of anonymising software in chat rooms to make sure that conver-
sations remain private. Additionally, access to content on the computer can 
be prevented by the use of encryption technology. The scale of the chal-
lenge facing law enforcement should not be underestimated. Collecting 
and preserving digital evidence can also pose obstacles during an investiga-
tion – portable storage devices containing valuable information can be 
removed from the crime scene or even concealed in file registries (Kerr, 
2005: 537–40). Where encryption protections have been used by an of-
fender, the process of gathering digital evidence may require the investi-
gating team to ascertain whether the access restrictions relate to the 
user-resource level or those operating at software-network level (Walden, 
2007: 282–3). Depending on the access protection controls adopted, the in-
vestigating officer may have to approach the offender, the organisation or 
the commercial online services provider to gain access to relevant digital 
evidence (US v Wayerski (2010)). In R v J (2009) the user-level access protec-
tion employed by the offender meant that law enforcement needed to only 
obtain a search warrant to gain access to the incriminating material on the 
computer. Difficulties may, however, be encountered where the informa-
tion stored online or being transmitted is protected by encryption tech-
nology and/or located in servers outside the national jurisdiction. An 
example of the former situation can be seen in R v Mara (2009). The accused 
was part of an online group trading in child exploitation content. The tech-
nical challenge faced by law enforcement in this case emerged from the fact 
that the content traded in by the group was posted in newsgroups in binary 
files and hence could not be viewed by those who did not have an access

“key”. The “keys” were changed frequently and embedded an additional 
three levels of security (i.e. changing nicknames, changing newsgroup loca-
tion, changing file extensions both manually and through an automated 
software programme specifically created for the purpose of avoiding detec-
tion by law enforcement). Law enforcement was, however, successful in 
gathering evidence of the accused having used his computer to access and 
transmit child abuse content from the Internet as well as recording indecent 
images of a child on designated dates, contrary to the provisions in Section 
474.19(1) of the Criminal Code (Commonwealth), and Sections 210(1)(f) 
and (3) of the Criminal Code (Queensland), respectively. Had law enforce-
ment not infiltrated the group, crucial evidence incriminating the accused 
would have been missed. Where the investigation involves the distribution 
of child pornography material on newsgroups and P2P sites, law enforce-
ment has to collect and preserve a range of evidence (e.g. evidence of con-
nection to the remote server, the IP addresses which are in plain view and 
deemed to be providing access to the illegal content, the jurisdiction in 
which the client is based, and activities associated with the distribution of 
the illegal content) (Liberatore et al., 2010). Law enforcement authorities 
now set up specialised units to equip personnel with relevant investigatory 
techniques and skills. For example, crime scene technicians are trained to 
secure, collect and preserve evidence gathered at the crime scene. These are 
crucial processes owing to the fact that digital evidence can be easily 
manipulated, deleted from folders or concealed within folders in encrypted 
hard drives. To minimise the difficulties encountered by law enforcement, 
specialist forensic computing training is provided and guidelines are pro-
vided for collecting and gathering digital evidence. Section 49 of the RIPA 
also assists the investigation process; law enforcement can compel an of-
fender to disclose usernames and passwords so that information stored on 
the computer can be accessed. However, the powers to compel disclosure 
are not unlimited. In R v S and Another (2008), it was held that the powers 
conferred by Section 49 of the RIPA permits disclosure of “any protected 
information”, which includes “any electronic data which, without the key 
to the data (a) cannot, or cannot readily, be accessed, or (b) cannot, or can-
not readily, be put into an intelligible form”. When making an application 
to the judge for this power, Section 49(2) of the RIPA requires, for example, 
some evidence to be offered in support for the view that the person is in 
possession of a key to the protected information or that disclosure of the 
information is necessary for securing the effective exercise or proper per-
formance by the public authority of its statutory power or duties. The two 
offenders in this case declined to comply with the disclosure notices on the 
grounds that the request violated their privilege against self-incrimination. 
The court held that disclosure of the “keys” of itself did not constitute “self-
incrimination” as the privilege only applied to the contents protected by 
the encryption software (paragraph 24).

Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) 1984 contains some key provi-
sions that govern the investigation, collection and gathering of evidence. It 
is not uncommon for offenders to claim that incriminating digital evidence 
obtained from searches of premises and seizure of the contents exceeded 
the authority granted in the warrant or that the evidence relied upon by 
the prosecution constituted hearsay (R v Miah and Another (2011)). Where 
the evidence is found on the computer or portable digital storage devices, 
guidance for the collection, gathering and processing of data is set out in 
the Association of Chief Police Officers’ (ACPO) Guide (see later discussion). 
It is usual in cases involving complaints about sexual activity with chil-
dren for the police to obtain a search warrant to search the premises of the 
accused and the surrounding area so that crucial evidence is not concealed, 
altered, destroyed or removed. A Justice of the Peace may, on an applica-
tion for a search warrant, grant the request if he has reasonable grounds 
for believing that there is relevant material on the premises which is likely 
to be of substantial value to the investigation of the offence and will be 
admissible as evidence in the trial (Section 8 of PACE 1984; Power-Hynes 
and another v Norwich Magistrates’ Court and another (2009)). In R (on the 
application of Glenn & Co (Essex) Ltd) v Revenue and Customs Commissioners 
(2010), it was held that the power to demand for inspection of documents 
included information stored on a computer or other storage device. Under 
Section 8(1) PACE, “material” which can be seized under a search warrant 
will include a computer and its hard disc (R (on the application of Faisaltex 
Ltd) v Preston Crown Court (2008)). Additionally, a warrant can be drafted to 
permit personnel with technical expertise to accompany the investigating 
officer conducting the search (Section 16 PACE 1984). The warrant can 
also specify that computers, webcams, videos and related communication 
and storage devices will be the subject of the search and seizure operation 
(Section 19 PACE 1984; R (on the application of H) (2009) paragraph 79; cf. 
Redknapp and Another v Commissioner of the City of London Police and Another 
(2008)). A police officer has a general power to seize materials found on 
premises if there are reasonable grounds for believing that it is evidence in 
relation to an offence which he is investigating or any other offence. In re-
lation to computer and digital evidence, the material seized can be imaged 
or copied (Cowan v Condon (2000); PACE, Code B). The evidence gathered 
from the computer, cameras, mobile phones or media storage devices (e.g. 
images) are treated as “real” evidence (DPP v McKeown (1997)). However, evi-
dence which purports to incorporate human statements can be regarded as 
hearsay (R v Wood (1982); Section 115 CJA 2003). More generally, most juris-
dictions not only exclude digital evidence on the grounds of hearsay but 
also render similar fact evidence inadmissible. For example, if the evidence 
produced does nothing more than show that the accused, from his previous 
criminal conviction, is the type of person who has committed the offence 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 149
for which he is now being tried, that evidence may be excluded (R v Morelli 
(2010); HML v the Queen, SB v the Queen, OAE v the Queen (2008) HCA 16, R v 
H (1995), Section 78(1) PACE 1984; cf. Sections 101(1)(d) and 107 CJA 2003). 
Prosecution’s use of evidence gathered during the investigation phase can 
also be challenged on the grounds of hearsay or that the constitutional 
rights of the accused have been infringed. For example, in the United States 
the law governing electronic evidence in criminal investigations is prin-
cipally found in the jurisprudence on Fourth Amendment and statutory 
privacy laws (Kerr, 2010). It is of particular interest to note the observation 
made in the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in US v Comprehensive 
Drug Testing II (2010). The ruling suggested the need for a defined set of 
protocols, which ensured that searches undertaken by law enforcement au-
thorities did not overreach the rights of the accused (at 1119). Under the 
plain view exception to the Fourth Amendment, law enforcement can seize 
relevant incriminating evidence if access gained to the venue was legal 
at the first instance and the evidence seized was readily apparent (Kerr, 
2005). Both US v Mann (2010) and US v Williams (2010) appear not to have 
been inclined to restrict the ability of law enforcement to gathering rele-
vant incriminating evidence under the plain view exception to the Fourth 
Amendment (Ohm, 2011). In Williams (2010) a search warrant executed for 
a harassment charge was deemed not to preclude the licence authorising 
law enforcement to access files in the computer; following the search, a 
large volume of child abuse images was found in the computer. In Mann, the 
approach adopted suggests that ordinary approaches to the constitutional 
boundaries of search procedures may have to take into account the fact 
that computer files may be mislabelled or concealed within the directory to 
evade identification by law enforcement (2010: 782). The Court rejected the 
accused’s argument that law enforcement exceeded the authority provided 
by the search warrant to gather evidence of voyeurism by accessing files 
which contained child pornography (2010: 781). It may be interesting to ex-
plore briefly the position in Canada. Evidence seized in contravention of an 
accused’s constitutional rights under Sections 8 and 10(b) of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter) can be rendered inadmissible. 
As a general rule, a search is reasonable if it is conducted in accordance 
with the rule of law (R v Stillman (1997); R v Collins, (1987)). In R v Boudreau-
Fontaine (2010) the Court of Appeal held that derivative evidence gathered 
from a computer seized during an unlawful arrest was rightly held by the 
trial judge to be inadmissible on the grounds of a series of violations of the 
accused’s rights – the absence of any reasonable grounds for arresting the 
accused and searching the computer, the act of compelling the accused to 
hand over the username and password information and the disregard of 
the accused’s right to not self-incriminate himself. The accused was sitting 
in his car when he was approached by two police officers. He was asked 
to produce some identification and these were subsequently checked from 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

the patrol car’s onboard computer. The search results indicated that the 
accused had been previously charged with a number of offences including 
the distribution of child pornography and was on probation. As part of the 
probation order the accused was prohibited from accessing the Internet. 
There was some uncertainty whether the accused was in fact accessing the 
Internet when approached by the police officers. Notwithstanding their 
doubts, the accused was arrested and a search warrant was then issued 
to permit seizure of the contents in his car, which included the laptop. 
Based on evidence gathered from the computer and the unlawful search, 
the accused was subsequently charged with possession of child pornog-
raphy and in breach of his probation order. The Court of Appeal made 
clear that for a seizure to be lawful, the items to be made the subject of the 
warrant had to be specifically described (2010: paragraph 50). As Doyon 
JA observed:
In the present case, we are not faced with minor violations. They are ser-
ious ... Rather, they are repeated violations of several Charter rights. The 
officers knew, or should have known, that their actions were contrary to 
the Charter. (2010: paragraph 59)
Principles of electronic-based evidence
A number of principles have been developed to ensure that relevant elec-
tronic-based evidence is not challenged on the grounds of its integrity and 
authenticity being compromised (see table below). The ACPO Good Practice 
Guide for Computer-Based Electronic Evidence now provides law enforcement 
with guidance to ensure that the best available evidence is presented in 
court (Tables 3.10 and 3.11).
Accordingly, the aim of gathering, recovering and presenting the evi-
dence is to demonstrate to the court that the integrity of the evidence 
has not been impaired from the time these came into the possession of 
the police (Ferraro et al., 2005). In online grooming or peer victimisation 
incidents on social networking sites, given that many conversations are 
engaged in these environments using possibly different computers and 
devices, piecing together a case narrative from chat rooms, history or log 
of the conversation from computers, laptops and mobile phones is a com-
plex and time-consuming process (Beebe et al., 2005). If appropriate, the 
ISP of both parties would be contacted to identify dates and time when 
the offences were deemed to be committed. Finally, the forensic lab will 
also have to testify that standard procedures were complied with to ensure 
that the integrity of the data was not compromised (Carrier et al., 2003). 
Ultimately, we need to keep in mind the goal of the digital investigation 
process – to enable a decision to be made as to whether legal prosecution 
should follow.

Table 3.10 Principles of electronic-based evidence
Principle 1
No action taken by law enforcement agencies or their agents should change data held 
on a computer or storage media which may subsequently be relied upon in court.
Principle 2
In circumstances where a person finds it necessary to access original data held on a 
computer or on storage media, that person must be competent to do so and be able 
to give evidence explaining the relevance and the implications of their actions.
Principle 3
An audit trail or other record of all processes applied to computer-based electronic 
evidence should be created and preserved. An independent third party should be 
able to examine those processes and achieve the same result.
Principle 4
The person in charge of the investigation (the case officer) has overall responsibility 
for ensuring that the law and these principles are adhered to.

Table 3.11 ACPO Principles
Application of ACPO Principles
Principle 1 in ACPO’s guide is important as it ensures that the gathered evidence 
is preserved and not altered or modified. Relevant evidence would include the 
laptops, relevant removable media like external drives, modems, USB or memory 
sticks, digital cameras, documentation and printed media, and mobile phone. 
Additionally, by switching off the laptops and isolating them from any router, 
modem or network, this will ensure that the evidence on the hard drive is not 
altered, deleted or manipulated by remote access. Access to usernames and 
passwords is important to ensure that forensic examination can be conducted 
expeditiously.
Principle 2 is important in ensuring that the right personnel, procedures and 
venues are used to examine the digital evidence. Procedures for accrediting 
forensic experts, and standardizing mechanisms for collection, gathering and 
presenting digital evidence are covered in ACPO’s guide. Additionally, the ISP of 
both parties should be contacted and relevant data of communications between 
the two parties examined.
Principle 3 is met where photographs are taken of the crime scenes, the laptops and 
any other visible evidence from the screen. A log of actions taken in respect of the 
laptops and the crime scene should be maintained. 
Principle 4 advises the investigating officer to ensure that personnel appointed in 
seizing and examining the evidence are trained personnel.

on this P2P network. The results correspond with similar criminal activity 
in other P2P networks. In a study of paedophile activities on the Internet, 
Latapy focused on paedophile activities on eDonkey, a well-known file-shar-
ing software (Latapy, 2009). Using simple honeypot portals, it was reported 
that over a 32-day period, 24 distributed honeypots were advertising four 
files, and over 110,049 IP addresses were identified and 28,007 distinct files 
noted.
Sting operations and entrapment
Policing the Internet poses its own set of challenges, as criminal activity 
can take place in various communication venues – usenet, bulletin boards, 
Internet relay chats, discussion groups, mailing lists, social networking sites 
and virtual worlds. Until their eventual detection and prosecution, groups 
like Candyman, W0nderland Club and Marcy used multiple communication 
platforms for engaging in the commercial and sexual exploitation of chil-
dren (Krone, 2005a,b). In 2007, a global paedophile ring was disbanded after 
law enforcement successfully infiltrated this group (Moore, 2007). Police 
sting operations enable law enforcement to deter and prosecute offenders 
for violating national laws (Casciani, 2011). For example, the Queensland 
police launched a Task Force Argos to investigate grooming activities in on-
line chat rooms (The Age, 2010). Police sting operations involve the use of 
deception by law enforcement to catch potential offenders (US v Williams 
(2010)). In relation to online solicitation activities by adults, a sting oper-
ation will involve a police officer acting as a potential victim. By pretend-
ing to be a child, the undercover officer aims to collect relevant evidence 
as part of the investigation (High, 2005). The decision to launch a police 
sting operation can result from a complaint made by a minor regarding

an online sexual solicitation incident. Alternatively, law enforcement may 
target particular venues in the online environment where paedophiles and 
other criminals are likely to operate (e.g. chat rooms and social networking 
sites). One legal issue that invariably arises in relation to the use of police 
sting operations is the fine distinction between pre-emptive deterrent police 
activity and State-induced breach of the criminal law. Courts in the United 
States have considered the issue of entrapment in relation to police stings 
carried out in the online setting. Entrapment is a substantive defence in 
the US federal courts. In Sherman v US (1957) it was held that the presump-
tion of “legislative intent” meant that Congress could not have intended its 
statutes to be enforced by luring innocent persons into committing crimes. 
In the United Kingdom, as in Australia, entrapment is not a substantive de-
fence (R v Sahin (2000)). It is not open to an accused to use entrapment as 
a defence to a criminal charge by claiming that he was induced to commit 
the crime by the police. That said, a court might, however, stay the pro-
ceedings if the conduct of the police was seen to be an abuse of process. It 
is also a course advocated in Canada, following the Supreme Court ruling 
in R v Mack (1988). The Supreme Court stressed that if the accused was not 
engaged in criminal activity, the opportunity provided by the police offic-
ers to commit the crime will be a form of entrapment justifying a stay in 
the proceedings. The burden of proof is on the accused who alleges an abuse 
of process in the form of police entrapment. Justice Lamer stressed that an 
abuse of process can arise from one of two acts. First, where the authorities 
provide an accused with an opportunity to commit an offence without any 
prior evidence that the accused was already engaged in criminal activity. 
Second, even if there was reasonable suspicion or the authorities were acting 
in the course of a bona fide inquiry their conduct will be deemed to be an 
abuse of power if the accused is actively induced to committing the offence 
for which he has been charged. The distinction between “random virtue 
testing” (which may be an abuse of process) and a query pursuant to “a bona 
fide investigation” is important (R v Holland (2011); R v Juneja (2010)). For ex-
ample, an unsolicited email to the accused offering to purchase child porn-
ography could be seen as an example of “random virtue testing” if there is 
no reasonable suspicion that the email address or website was being used 
to distribute child pornography. An example of a bona fide investigation 
would be for a law enforcement officer who has infiltrated an online child 
sex ring to enquire about the availability of live streaming of child sexual 
abuse media or victims for sex tourism activity. Even though there may be 
no “specific” evidence that the individual approached was engaged in sex 
tourism or live streaming of child sexual abuse, the inquiry would appear to 
be a bona fide attempt in investigating the commission of criminal acts (R 
v DGF (2010)). With regard to the position in the United Kingdom, the lead-
ing case for entrapment is the House of Lords ruling in R v Sang (1980). In R 
v Sang, the Law Lords ruled that relevant admissible evidence could not be 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 155
simply excluded on the grounds that the methods employed by the police 
were unfair or unlawful. Section 78 PACE 1984 now reverses the decision 
regarding the admissibility unfairly obtained evidence. The statutory provi-
sion provides that a court has the residual discretion to exclude evidence on 
which the prosecution proposes to rely if, having regard to all the circum-
stances, the admission of the evidence would have such an adverse effect on 
the fairness of the proceedings that it ought not be admitted. This is not dis-
similar to the approach adopted in Australia following rulings in Ridgeway 
v the Queen (1995) and R v Thomas (2006). The present procedural rules gov-
erning the admissibility of evidence can be found in the Evidence Act 2008, 
Sections 135–8. The High Court in Ridgeway (1995) suggested that in cases 
where entrapment is shown to be present, the trial judge has the discretion 
to exclude evidence from the investigation, if the methods employed were 
found to be unlawful or improper ((1995) paragraphs 14–18). Police con-
duct which induces a state-created crime (e.g. entrapment) is viewed by the 
Judiciary as being unacceptable and improper. As Lord Nicholls indicated in 
R v Loosely (2001):
It is simply not acceptable that the state through its agents should lure 
its citizens into committing acts forbidden by the law and then seek to 
prosecute them for doing so. That would be entrapment. That would 
be a misuse of state power, and an abuse of the process of the courts. 
(paragraph 1)
In deciding whether conduct amounts to a state-created crime, consider-
ation is given to all the circumstances of the case and whether the conduct 
of the police or other law enforcement agency was so seriously improper as 
to bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It is sometimes assumed 
that any evidence resulting from Internet sting operations will give rise to 
claims of entrapment and consequently may be excluded under Section 78 
of PACE 1984. This is a misleading view of the law as it currently stands in 
the United Kingdom. In R v Looseley (2001), Lord Nichols cited with approval 
the observation of Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ in R v Smurthwaite (1994) that 
Section 78 did not displace the common law rule that entrapment does not 
of itself provide a defence. Consequently, when faced with evidence gath-
ered from an Internet police sting which is used to charge the accused with 
a crime, the judge may now make an assessment, in the light of the con-
duct and exchange between the undercover officer and the accused, whether 
the offender was enticed to commit a crime that he would not otherwise 
have committed, the methods employed, the nature of the offence and the 
officer’s role in obtaining the evidence. The Court of Appeal in Jones (2007) 
provides another illustration of how English courts approach issues of ad-
missibility when faced with defence claims that the admission of the evi-
dence gathered through the use of sting or covert investigation strategies 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings that 
it ought to be excluded. The police commenced investigations after being 
informed by a journalist that an anonymous individual had scribbled graffiti 
messages on toilet doors in trains. These messages aimed to entice children 
for sexual activity. One example of a message placed by the accused was as 
follows:
wanted for sex, girls from 8 to 13, text only [mobile telephone number]
A journalist contacted the number and received a text requesting the fol-
lowing information: her age, whether she was a virgin, her willingness to 
perform oral sex and a named picture of herself. The journalist informed 
the police, who then launched a sting operation. The undercover officer pre-
tended to be a young girl by the name of “Amy”, aged 12. Amy contacted the 
offender and was then requested to provide the information that was previ-
ously requested from the journalist. A meeting was arranged but it was one 
where the offender failed to turn up. The accused subsequently commenced 
communications with Amy during which time he indicated the sexual acts 
he would be engaging with her. The accused was arrested and charged for a 
range of offences under the SOA 2003. Of particular interest here is the court’s 
response to the accused’s claim that the proceedings had to be stayed on the 
grounds that the use of entrapment was an abuse of police powers. On appeal 
against conviction, Thomas LJ stressed that covert policing operations should 
not incite an accused to commit an offence (2007: paragraph 23). The key 
point here is the Court of Appeal’s observation that police covert operations 
in this case did not go beyond responding to the information requested by 
the accused. We can infer from this observation that had the police instigated 
the communications (e.g. approaching the accused and indicating that Amy 
was available for sexual activity) there may have been an arguable case of en-
trapment. It is also clear, as confirmed by the approach of the Court of Appeal 
in R v Jones, that a balance has to be struck between the public interest in pros-
ecuting individuals who entice minors for sexual activity and the competing 
public interest in protecting individuals from unlawful or unfair police ac-
tivity (A-G’s Reference (No. 3 of 1999) (2001) at 590 per Lord Hutton).
Sting operations have been employed in the United States to detect those 
who misuse the Internet to persuade or induce minors to engage in sexual 
activity (The People v Karampal Singh (2010); Jacobson v US (1992); US v Brand 
(2006). In US v Orr (2010) the accused was convicted under the provisions of 
18 USCA § 2422 (a) and (b) – using an interstate commerce to attempt to per-
suade or induce a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity. The accused 
appealed on the grounds that he was entrapped. An affirmative defence of 
entrapment requires an accused to adduce the relevant standard of proof 
with regard to two elements: (1) the crime was induced by law enforcement; 
and (2) the accused lacked the disposition to engage in criminal conduct. The

Online Sexual Grooming, Obscene Content, Peer Victimisation 157
accused engaged in a series of online conversations with a person whom he 
assumed was a woman, a mother with two daughters. These conversations 
took place in a chat room, which hosted conversations on “Fetishes”. The 
accused used the screen name “master_corpos1” and the women had the 
username “jenmomam”. The accused intimated that he had been training 
his 12-year-old stepdaughter to perform sexual acts and inquired whether 
“jenmomam” was training her girls. He then suggested his willingness to 
help train her and her daughters. During the conversation, he persuaded 
her to move to Michigan with her children so that they could become his 
sexual slaves. The accused then proceeded to purchase some train tickets for 
all three of them. Unknown to the accused, “jenmomam” was in fact a po-
lice officer conducting an online undercover investigation into child sexual 
exploitation. At the trial the accused did not rely on the defence of entrap-
ment but sought to raise the judge’s failure to deal with the defence as a 
ground for appeal. The Court concluded that any attempt to rely on the de-
fence of entrapment would not have been successful since the accused had 
demonstrated, during the entire conversation, a commitment to train the 
two minors for sexual purposes and continued to maintain the view until 
his arrest. It was also held that the accused could not provide any evidence 
showing that law enforcement had in fact employed extraordinary pressure 
or made extraordinary promises indicative of an inducement to engage in 
criminal activity. We can contrast this covert policing operation with that 
in US v Poehlman (2000), where the undercover officer played an important 
role in turning the accused’s original purpose of seeking sex with adults to 
that of engaging in sexual activity with minors. As the court noted:
An improper inducement goes beyond providing an ordinary oppor-
tunity to commit a crime. An inducement consists of an opportunity 
plus something else – typically, excessive pressure by the government 
upon the defendant or the government’s taking advantage of an alterna-
tive, non-criminal type of motive. ((2000), 692, 701)
In US v Curtin (2006) the accused was charged with travelling across state 
lines with intent to engage in a sexual act with a minor, in violation of 18 
USC § 2423(b), and using an interstate facility to attempt to persuade a 
minor to engage in sexual acts, in violation of 18 USC § 2422(b). The court 
observed that the general tenor of the communications between law en-
forcement and the accused was one where the latter was clearly motivated 
by a desire to initiate a minor into the world of adult sex. The ruling in US v 
Ross (2010) provides another illustration of the effectiveness of sting opera-
tions, which comply with due process measures; the accused was charged 
with the offence of attempting to entice a minor for sexual activity (18 USCA 
§ 2422(b)). The accused had Internet chats, email exchanges and phone calls 
with a person whom he believed to be a minor. He travelled to a location

he thought was her home. His attempt to raise the defence of entrapment 
failed because there was no inducement provided by the undercover police 
officer. These cases illustrate a paradox in the use of sting operations and 
its continued relevance to issues of admissibility – on the one hand that 
individuals should be held accountable for their actions; and on the other 
that individuals should not be improperly induced into committing crim-
inal acts by the mere fact that they may be thought to have a tendency or 
disposition to commit criminal acts (Feinberg, 2003: 62).
Conclusion
This chapter has described and explained how the criminal law responds 
to contact, content and conduct risks resulting from children’s consump-
tion of Web 2.0 technologies and social media. The analysis undertaken – 
namely, the role and response of the criminal law in promoting trust and 
confidence – illustrates many of the governance challenges posed by digital 
information and the end-to-end architecture for policymakers, law enforce-
ment, parents, educators and children. Some examples and case illustrations 
were also provided to highlight the legal and evidentiary issues as well as 
the forensic significance of using digital evidence in prosecuting individuals 
for violating child sexual abuse and exploitation laws. The deployment of 
covert and sting operations and investment in Hi-Tec Crime units for inves-
tigating, collecting and presenting digital evidence will continue to play an 
important role in enhancing the safety of children in the online environ-
ment. One conclusion reached in this chapter is that the judicial interpret-
ation of its national laws and the successful investigation and prosecution of 
individuals found to have used Web 2.0 technologies to engage in child sex 
offences suggest that criminal law standards and rules can be extended to 
this new context of child protection policymaking. It is fair to say that the 
substantive rules put in place by governments are satisfactory (President’s 
Working Group on Unlawful Conduct on the Internet, 2000). It has been 
shown that the problem facing policymakers is not so much to do with the 
application of its laws (though the extension of its laws beyond its national 
boundaries will continue to pose a challenge). One of the challenges facing 
policymakers in this area of governance is to assess how best the responsi-
bility for implementing and enforcing existing legal standards and rules can 
be extended across the various stakeholders. Recognition of the limited role 
of the State and constraints on its ability to police and enforce its laws may 
re-energise efforts towards better coordinating MSIG strategies at national 
and international levels. Issues like content regulation and those resulting 
from other risk-prone activities may also require educators and parents to 
be more aware of their obligations and the extra-legal strategies that can be 
employed when assisting children to use the Internet in a safe and respon-
sible manner (Case, 95–9).

Overview
Cyberspace creates the impression of a space where multiple sovereign 
nations can assume jurisdiction whilst at the same time States find them-
selves struggling to enforce their criminal laws beyond their national bound-
aries (Perrit, 1996). The ease with which the Internet now enables individuals 
to procure children to engage in sexual activity, the difficulties in detecting 
and investigating online sexual exploitation, the lack of harmonised laws 
and the varying degrees of skill and expertise of law enforcement units ex-
acerbate the feeling that this borderless and decentralised environment is 
incapable of being governed. Edwards laments the difficulties in assessing 
the effectiveness of national laws in disrupting the creation and distribution 
of illegal content and asserts somewhat inaccurately that “being seen to be 
‘doing something’ about child pornography on the Internet remains a polit-
ical imperative for most governments” (Edwards, 2010: 630). It is important, 
however, not to overstate the impact of the Internet on the applicability of 
existing jurisdictional principles and rules. Although there is increased po-
tential for using the Internet and communication technologies to engage 
in the commercial and sexual exploitation of children across geographical 
boundaries, this chapter argues that the online environment does not intro-
duce any additional jurisdictional challenges that had not been encountered 
previously. Before we can identify the nature of the jurisdiction challenges 
facing policymakers and law enforcement and their significance for child 
protection, an account will be provided of the basic principles governing 
the ability of States and its courts to assume jurisdiction over criminal acts, 
which have extra-territorial dimensions. An explanation will be provided 
of the rules that govern the decision by a State to either assert or decline 
jurisdiction over criminal acts both within its national boundaries and be-
yond. In the second part, the chapter will look at some of the principal legal 
instruments enacted by governments to deal with the extraterritorial crim-
inal jurisdiction issues. Finally, an assessment will be made as to whether

the online environment raises any significant governance challenges that 
require additional or novel regulatory approaches to resolving transborder 
criminal activities relating to the commercial and sexual exploitation of 
children. One conclusion reached is that many countries now take the view 
that online child safety governance requires a global response. The efforts 
made in reducing the jurisdictional and investigatory barriers suggest that 
international treaty instruments and informal cooperation measures may 
serve as an appropriate regulatory response to the transborder dimensions 
of online child sexual exploitation activity.
Criminal jurisdiction: Background
The concept of criminal jurisdiction
It is a general principle in international law that States have jurisdiction 
over acts taking place within their territorial boundaries. “Jurisdiction”, 
as is often stated, is concerned with the exercise of legislative, adjudica-
tive and enforcement powers of a State over persons, property or events 
(Akehurst, 1972–3). The jurisdiction to prescribe refers to the power of a 
State to enact laws and rules that govern the activities of persons or the 
interests of persons in things within its territorial boundaries and beyond. 
Adjudicative jurisdiction on the other hand is a term used to describe 
the authority of the State in subjecting persons or entities to judicial or 
administrative processes. Accordingly, this term describes the power, for 
example, of courts to adjudicate over persons or things. Finally, the jur-
isdiction to enforce is concerned with the State’s authority to enforce 
compliance with its laws and regulations. The power to enforce laws or 
punish individuals for non-compliance can be executed through its judi-
cial mechanisms or other administrative or executive procedures (Estey, 
1997). In the event, for example, of an individual committing a crime in 
the United Kingdom but then fleeing to Australia, an application will be 
made to the destination country to have the offender extradited to face 
trial for the offences charged in the requesting State (Liangsiriprasert v USA 
(1991); Treacy v DPP (1971)). One view of the exercise of sovereign rights 
with regard to jurisdiction is that States do not enforce their laws outside 
their territory unless the conduct or activities come within the rules per-
mitting them to do so under a Convention or the exercise of sovereign 
power beyond its territorial boundaries is seen as being consistent with 
customary international law or sovereign rights to self-determination 
(Knox, 2010: 351). The presumption against extraterritoriality is derived 
from the idea that since national laws are territorial, considerations of 
comity warrant legislative, executive and even judicial restraint (Estey, 
1997: 178–80). That said, States have in a number of instances extended 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 161
the reach of their laws for pragmatic or political reasons in areas like intel-
lectual property and national security (Lowe, 1985, 732). Extraterritorial 
legislation can be regarded as either a puzzling contradiction or a “paradox 
of a world of multiple, sovereign authorities” (Desautels-Stein, 2008: 514). 
Within the context of criminal jurisdiction, the exercise by a State of its 
powers to prescribe, adjudicate and enforce its laws and punish offenders 
is regarded as being consistent with international law norms. As Berman 
correctly observes, criminal jurisdiction involves the exercise of “powers 
over people, so powers over individuals themselves (including their lib-
erty), over their property, and over their activities” (Berman, 2003: 3). 
Whilst tribunals like the International Criminal Court have jurisdiction 
over particular areas like humanitarian law, national courts in the main 
assert jurisdiction over criminal law violations, which they can legitim-
ately investigate and prosecute. A State can assume jurisdiction over crim-
inal acts that take place within its territory, or in cases where there is a 
transborder element that a sufficient connection exists between the con-
duct complained of and its laws (R v Smith (Wallace Duncan) (No. 4) (2004)). 
As Lord Reid indicated in Treacy v DPP (1971):
There is a strong presumption that when Parliament, in an Act applying 
to England, creates an offence by making certain acts punishable it does 
not intend this to apply to any act done by anyone in any country other 
than England. Parliament, being sovereign, is fully entitled to make an 
enactment on a wider basis. (1971: 537)
The following principles determine the State’s authority to subject offenders 
to the criminal jurisdiction of its laws relating to the sexual exploitation of 
children:
Territoriality Principle
Active Personality Principle
Passive Personality Principle
Protective Principle
Universality Principle
Territoriality Principle
This is a fundamental principle governing criminal jurisdiction as recog-
nised in the Island of Palmas Case:
Sovereignty in the relations between States signifies independence. 
Independence in regard to a portion of the globe is the right to exer-
cise therein, to the exclusion of any other State, the functions of a State. 
(RIAA II 829, 838)
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

162 Online Child Safety
According to the principle of territoriality, criminal acts taking place within 
the territory of a sovereign State are subject to the laws of the land. For ex-
ample, a foreign national can be charged for crimes under the SOA 2003 if 
he or she has engaged in criminal acts in this jurisdiction. In such an in-
stance, the identity or nationality of the perpetrator or victim will not be 
relevant to the issue of whether a State’s assertion of jurisdiction over the 
incident is legitimate. It is the nexus between the acts and the place where 
the event in question takes place that will determine the basis upon which 
the State is able to assume jurisdiction (R v Smith (Wallace Duncan)(No. 4) 
(2004)). With many countries now concluding bilateral treaties which 
permit cooperation between law enforcement authorities, or subscribing to 
Conventions which aim to harmonise substantive and procedural rules for 
prosecuting crimes with a transborder element, the jurisdictional barriers 
to investigating and prosecuting individuals for crimes committed overseas 
are not as onerous as they once were (Hirst, 2003).
Active Personality Principle
A State’s authority to assume criminal jurisdiction over its nationals can in 
certain circumstances extend beyond its territory, where elements of the 
crime are held to have taken place both within its territorial boundaries 
and beyond (Hirst, 2003; R v Libman (1985); Treacy v DPP (1971)). To avoid 
any uncertainty with regard to a State’s ability to act extraterritoriality, 
statutory enactments make explicit reference to the existence of such a 
power. There are, for example, statutory provisions relating to extraterri-
torial criminal jurisdiction governing piracy (Section 2 Piracy Act 1837), 
war crimes (Section 1 Geneva Conventions Act 1957), hostages (Section 1 
Taking of Hostages Act 1982), hijacking (Sections 1, 2 or 6 Aviation Security 
Act 1982), terrorism (Terrorism Act 2000) and torture (Section 134 CJA 
1988). Within the context of this study, the exercise of a State’s jurisdic-
tion over the acts of its nationals in overseas countries, like the SOA 2003, 
Crimes Legislation Amendment (Child Sex Tourism Offences and Related 
Measures) Bill 2007 and PROTECT Act 2003, would be examples of legis-
lation attempting to address a problem of national and global concern 
(Lavers, 2006: 68).
Passive Personality Principle
The issue of whether the nationality of a child sexual abuse victim should 
determine the assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction is hotly debated 
(Beaulieu, 2008: 4–6; G8, 2007; cf. Hirst, 2003: 29–36). The most frequent 
argument offered against the assertion of extraterritorial jurisdiction is that 
the State’s legitimate interests lie in respect of regulating the activities of its 
citizens (Lavers, 2006). This conception of the territorial principle is based 
on a model of a nation State that is concerned with the acts of its citizens 
and conduct taking place within its geographical boundaries rather than 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 163
activities taking place in another State (Keitner, 2011: 56–8);  the premise 
here being that the conduct engaged in by the national in the overseas 
country does not have an adverse or harmful effect within national’s State 
(Treacy v DPP (1971)). However, in the final upshot the jurisdictional issues 
may turn on the construction of the particular legislative enactment (R v 
Manning (1998) 461, 476).
Protective Principle
The rationale for the protective principle is that States have the inalienable 
authority to exercise jurisdiction over persons or events situated in another 
jurisdiction when an act taking place outside its territory has or is likely to 
have an adverse effect on its security or interests (R v Abu Hamza (2006)). 
Clearly, the extent to which this principle applies will depend on the nature 
of the criminal activity concerned (Hirst, 2003: 115). As seen above, in re-
lation to the extraterritorial reach of the laws, conduct like piracy, hijack-
ing and terrorism are activities which can be included within the scope of 
the protective principle. In cases where jurisdiction is asserted, there is a 
close relationship between the protective principle and the “effects” test 
employed by States to justify the assumption of jurisdiction over an act that 
has taken place outside its territory (US v Tollman (2008)).
Universality Principle
According to the Princeton Principles on Universal Jurisdiction, a State 
may assert jurisdiction over a person notwithstanding the absence of 
any connecting factor, solely on the grounds of the nature of the act con-
cerned (Sadat, 2001: 241–64). Universal jurisdiction for present purposes is 
described as “criminal jurisdiction based solely on the nature of the crime, 
without regard to where the crime was committed, the nationality of the 
alleged or convicted perpetrator, the nationality of the victim, or any other 
connection to the state exercising such jurisdiction” (Princeton University 
Program in Law and Public Affairs, 2001). Consequently, a State can assert 
criminal jurisdiction beyond its territorial boundaries, if the nature of 
the crime is such that it justifies the exercise of its sovereign authority 
(Colangelo, 2009: 881–926). The prosecuting State can as a consequence 
subject the individual to the machinery of the criminal law without regard 
to the place where the acts were deemed to have taken place or the nation-
ality of the perpetrator concerned (Fry, 2002: 174). This exercise of State au-
thority is subject to a number of due process safeguards – the requirement 
that the exercise of that authority is by a “competent and ordinary judicial 
body”, the recourse to formal extradition hearings to ascertain whether 
an extraditable crime has been committed by the extraditable person and 
that the appearance of this person before a court of law in the requesting 
State does not violate established “international norms and standards on 
the protection of human rights” (Akyol v DPP Zwole Lelystad Netherlands 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

164 Online Child Safety
(2010); Wenting v High Court of Valenciennes (2009)). For example, under 
the Geneva Conventions Act 1957, individuals can be prosecuted for war 
crimes committed outside the United Kingdom (Commissioner of Police for 
the Metropolis and Others, Ex Parte Pinochet (2001); R (on the application of 
Krstic) v Secretary of State for Justice (2010)). With regard to the assertion of 
State sovereign powers, previously the consent of the Attorney General or 
CPS was not required in an application to issue a summons or warrant; 
the applicant merely needed to furnish evidence that an offence has been 
committed by the accused. The Ministry of Justice has recently announced 
that this procedure would now be reviewed (Hansard, 2010). Even though 
crimes against children are not regarded as being within the scope of the 
Universality Principle, signatories to the UNCRC, Cybercrime and CPC 
instruments undertake to implement key principles and rules into their 
national legal systems. Consequently, the criminalisation of particular 
forms of exploitative activity is seen as a basis for States to assume juris-
diction over a number of conduct or result crimes (e.g. child pornography, 
sexual solicitation and sex tourism). Individual States can assume juris-
diction even in situations where nationals have engaged in crimes against 
children in foreign jurisdictions. For example, under the CPC Convention, 
signatories can implement measures in national legislation which remove 
the substantive and procedural obstacles to prosecuting individuals for 
engaging in serious sexual offences abroad against foreign nationals (e.g. 
double criminality). Subscribers to the CPC Convention agree to “take the 
necessary legislative or other measures to establish jurisdiction over the 
offences established in accordance with this Convention, in cases where an 
alleged offender is present on its territory and it does not extradite him or 
her to another Party, solely on the basis of his or her nationality” (Article 
25). One recent example of a national court assuming jurisdiction over 
foreign nationals in relation to the commercial and sexual exploitation 
of children is the successful prosecution of two Swedish nationals for en-
gaging in human trafficking and online live web streaming pornography 
operations on the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines (SMH, 2011). 
The Cybercrime Convention is another example of an instrument creating 
a multilateral framework for regulating crimes mediated through ICTs. 
Countries subscribing to this Convention use its provisions as a framework 
for enacting legislation dealing with child pornography and other forms 
of sexual abuse of children. Like the CPC Convention, potential jurisdic-
tional conflicts can, for example, be avoided with regard to prosecuting 
perpetrators engaged in CSEC in a destination country since each signatory 
assumes an obligation to “adopt such legislative and other measures as may 
be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when 
committed intentionally and without right” (Article 9(1)) Access to digital 
evidence located in a foreign jurisdiction can be enhanced as each party to 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 165
the Cybercrime Convention undertakes to implement legislative or other 
measures, which empower competent authorities to search or access:
a. a computer system or part of it and computer data stored therein; and
b. a computer-data storage medium in which computer data may be stored 
in its territory. (Article 19(1))
Where the commission of a child sex offence permits multiple States juris-
diction over the matter, parties are encouraged to coordinate their activities 
“with a view to determining the most appropriate jurisdiction for prosecu-
tion” (Article 22(5)). The Cybercrime Convention aims to reduce the op-
portunities for perpetrators to engage in forum shopping as Article 22(3) 
stipulates that parties shall adopt “such measures as may be necessary to es-
tablish jurisdiction” and that parties “cooperate with each other ... through 
the application of relevant international instruments on international co-op-
eration in criminal matters” (Article 23). These Conventions can be broadly 
seen as reflecting growing consensus amongst the international community 
that certain forms of sexual and commercial exploitation of children should 
be treated as crimes regardless of where they are committed.
Implications for investigation and prosecution
Jurisdiction rules are of direct relevance to the ability of a legal system to 
implement its child protection laws when there is a transborder dimension. 
Differences in the substantive laws on child pornography, the age of consent 
and the legal definition of a “child” can undermine investigatory and pros-
ecution efforts in holding a potential offender to account, if national laws 
do not cover sexual offences committed against children in another juris-
diction (Berman, 2002: 311–23). Indeed, it is not uncommon for nationals 
prosecuted for engaging in child sex offences with a transborder dimension 
to raise issues regarding the court’s jurisdiction or the applicability of the 
criminal laws to conduct taking place in another jurisdiction. It is argued 
that varying legal definitions of the age of consent can complicate investi-
gation and prosecution decisions (Taylor et al., 2003: 83).
Even though the CPC Convention defines a “child” as “any person under 
the age of 18 years” (Article 3(a)), Article 18 permits States to “decide the 
age below which it is prohibited to engage in sexual activities with a child” 
(Article 18(2)). Even varying approaches to the way crimes are defined can 
hinder attempts to prosecute a child sex offender (Podgor, 2004; Graham, 
2000). Article 20(3) of the CPC Convention permits parties to define the age 
threshold and the types of prohibited conduct. These differences may have 
a bearing when attempts to have an offender extradited flounder on the 
grounds that the act concerned is not regarded as a crime in the responding/
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

166 Online Child Safety
destination State. The double criminality rule may prevent the responding 
State from treating the offence as an “extraditable crime”. One could en-
visage a situation where a requesting State, which criminalises all forms of 
pornography, seeks to have an offender extradited from the United States 
for distributing pseudo-photographs of a virtual child in the former jur-
isdiction. Under US Federal Law, the possession of pseudo-photographs of 
children per se is not a criminal offence, unless these are regarded as contra-
vening the child pornography legislation or the obscenity test under Miller 
v California (1973). Broadly, supranational and international policy instru-
ments do provide an opportunity for States to overcome the potential prob-
lems that may arise from the transborder dimensions of child sex offence 
by harmonisation (Beaulieu, 2008). The Proposed Directive is one example 
of the use of regulatory instruments to harmonise child protection laws 
within EU Member States.
As a child protection measure, the ability of a State to investigate and 
prosecute citizens engaged in child sex offences in overseas jurisdictions 
has some advantages (Hirst, 2003). For example, States can now launch 
prosecutions, should the destination country not have sufficient law en-
forcement resources or expertise in investigating and prosecuting child sex 
offenders from the home country. Second, the legislation can also be pre-
emptive in the sense that law enforcement in the home country can now 
make a timely intervention before the offender travels abroad to meet the 
child (or conversely, where an arrangement is made for the child to travel 
to the home country of the offender. US v Seljan (2007) is not only an ex-
ample of the application of the nationality principle but it also serves to 
highlight how potential victims can be safeguarded by pre-emptive meas-
ures undertaken in the home jurisdiction where extraterritorial laws have 
been enacted. The accused in this case was a US national who was charged 
and convicted for a range of offences involving sexual misconduct with 
children based in the Philippines. He was stopped when he attempted to 
board his flight and subsequently arrested and prosecuted for a number of 
child sex offences; evidence was gathered showing that he was attempt-
ing to travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor 
contrary to 18 US §§ 2423(b) and (e), enabled law enforcement to make a 
timely intervention and apprehend the offender. Finally, the ability of a 
State to enforce its criminal laws extraterritorially corresponds with one 
of the justifications of the criminal law, which is to deter its nationals 
from engaging in criminal acts albeit in destination countries (R v Klassen 
(2008); Mody, 2001).
Two principles continue to proscribe the extraterritorial reach of national 
laws: (i) double criminality (ii) and double jeopardy. As noted previously, 
the use of bilateral treaty arrangements and supranational child protec-
tion instruments minimise the impact of these rules (see later). With regard 
to the latter, the principle non bis in idem espouses the ideal of fairness in 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 167
criminal proceedings (Connelly v DPP (1964)). As the Advocate General Ruiz-
Jarabo Colomer indicated in his Opinion:
The decisive factor is not whether the right to impose a penalty is exercised 
under one legal system or under several legal systems, but that in order 
to know whether an act may be punished more than once, the person ex-
ercising the power to impose the penalty, must ascertain whether, with 
the various penalties, the same legal principles are being protected or 
whether, on the contrary, the values which are being protected are differ-
ent. (Cases C-187/01 and C-385/01: paragraph 56)
In essence, the principle provides that a person who has been prosecuted for 
a criminal offence in one jurisdiction should not be subjected thereafter to 
multiple prosecutions in other jurisdictions for the same offence (Abelson, 
2009: 1–38). The rationale for this rule, albeit the claims that victims of 
crimes are equally deserving of consideration by the criminal justice system, 
is the respect for humanity and dignity of individuals, particularly those 
prosecuted for serious crimes (Fletcher, 2003a: 581). Before the principle can 
be applied in the accused’s favour, it must be shown that the proceedings 
were conducted in good faith and that the judgment reached by the judicial 
or relevant body was consistent with international norms and principles 
of due process. One effect of this principle is that a national returning to 
his country cannot be prosecuted for the same crime on the grounds of 
acquittal or that the sentence meted by the overseas court was lower than 
the punishment handed down in the country of residence. In Bohning v 
Government of the United States of America (2006), the appellant sought to 
challenge an extradition request from the United States on the grounds that 
in view of the specific provisions in Section 80 of the Extradition Act 2003, 
his extradition would violate the rule against double jeopardy. The appellant 
travelled to the United Kingdom from the United States and attempted to 
engage in sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl who lived in Birmingham. 
Following his arrest, his laptop was seized and incriminating evidence was 
subsequently discovered. The evidence included over 10,000 images depict-
ing sexual abuse of children and babies; emails and chat conversations be-
tween the appellant and girls (including the minor in Birmingham). The 
appellant was charged with 20 counts of child sex offences, including pos-
session of indecent material, distribution of an indecent photograph of a 
minor and publication of an article, contrary to the provisions under the 
PCA 1978 and the SOA 2003. Crucially, when drafting the indictment, 
prosecution ensured that the offences with which the appellant was being 
charged did not traverse those charges which were pending against him in 
the United States. Following the appellant’s conviction and his serving of a 
custodial sentence, the US government sought his extradition for offences 
coming within a number of categories which were not the subject of the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

168 Online Child Safety
charges in the United Kingdom: (i) incitement of B and two other young 
girls, one resident in the United Kingdom and the other in the United States, 
to commit acts of indecency; and (ii) distribution and possession charges 
in respect of the material that had been found on the laptop. The Court 
of Appeal agreed that an offender could not be prosecuted twice for the 
same crime (paragraph 21). It, however, held that the double jeopardy rule 
did not prevent prosecution for separate offences, which arose out of the 
same facts (e.g. incitement), or to offences, which could have been but were 
not charged (ibid.). Consequently, the Court ruled that the extradition of 
the appellant did not violate the double jeopardy rule. The application of 
this rule in respect of an individual’s acquittal of crimes outside the United 
Kingdom must now be reconsidered in the light of the reforms introduced 
by Part 10 of the CJA 2003 (Fletcher, 2003b). Sections 75–9 of the 2003 
Act enable persons acquitted for “qualifying offences” to be retried where 
new and compelling evidence has emerged (R v A (2008)). Section 75 makes 
clear that Part 10 applies to acquittals. There are a number of points to be 
borne in mind with regard to re-trials of individuals acquitted of child sex 
offences in jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom. The first thing to be 
noted is that amendments to the scope of the double jeopardy rule only 
apply to serious offences regarded as “qualifying”. Murder, manslaughter 
and rape are obviously included within this category. Acquittals in relation 
to offences involving sexual activity with a minor, however, will be deemed 
to be “qualifying” but only in the limited situation where the victim is 
below 13 years. This age restriction has obvious investigatory implications 
since it leaves those victims above the age threshold not only vulnerable 
to further sexual exploitation but also without any legal redress. Second, 
even if the age threshold is satisfied, an application has still to be made 
to the Court of Appeal for a ruling on whether the acquittal in a foreign 
court is a bar to a re-trial. This application to the Court of Appeal can only 
be made with the written consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
Consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions will only be forthcoming 
if the prosecutor can demonstrate that the public interest will be served 
for the application to proceed, that the re-trial would not be inconsistent 
with the United Kingdom’s obligations as a Member of the EU under Article 
31 or 34 of the Treaty on EU relating to the principle of ne bis in idem and 
that “there is new and compelling evidence against the acquitted person in 
relation to the qualifying offence”. The public interest requirement, for ex-
ample, is unlikely to be met under Section 79, if there has been substantial 
media coverage of the incident, which is likely to make a fair trial less than 
probable, and the relative length in period between the alleged commis-
sion of the offence and the prospective re-trial is deemed to be excessive. 
Other considerations which may be relevant when determining the public 
interest issue will include the likelihood of the investigating officer or pros-
ecutor adducing the new evidence during the earlier proceedings had they

Transborder Challenges 169
acted with due diligence or expedition. The burdens on law enforcement 
in discharging its obligations are considerable. The requirement for “com-
pelling new evidence” could include DNA evidence, fingerprint or other 
incriminating evidence and new witnesses to the offence. In R v A (2008) 
the court held that new and compelling evidence must not only be relevant 
and admissible but it must be regarded as highly probative of the offender’s 
guilt of the qualifying offence. Evidence of a confession obtained by unfair 
or improper means and if shown not to be substantial or highly probative 
would be a bar to an application to have the case re-tried (R v Whittle (Barry 
Gordon) (2010)).
Another principle that has implications for the successful investigation 
and prosecution of individuals found to have engaged in sexual offences 
against children in foreign jurisdiction is the double criminality rule. The 
rationale for the double criminality rule stems from the adherence to the 
principle – nulla poena sine lege – that there should be no punishment without 
law. Its application in extradition proceedings seems to be based on consid-
erations of policy or political expediency (Griffith et al., 2005). According to 
the double criminality rule, a UK national can only be extradited to face 
prosecution in the home country if the conduct engaged in during a visit to 
an overseas country is deemed to be a crime in both the home and the over-
seas country. The entry into bilateral treaties and conventions can modify 
the application of the double criminality rule and consequently ensure that 
offenders will have fewer opportunities for challenging extradition requests 
(Canada (Attorney General) v Leamont (2010). In the United Kingdom, the pre-
vious law which adopted the principle of double criminality for child sex 
offences committed by British citizens abroad has now been replaced by 
amendments introduced under the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 
2008, Section 72(1). Following these amendments, British nationals or those 
who are resident in the United Kingdom can now be prosecuted for sex 
offences committed abroad against anyone, even though the age thresholds 
in destination countries may be much lower than those in the United 
Kingdom (R v Penner (2010)). The substantive rules for age-specific offences 
will still continue to apply if these offences are committed abroad. These 
developments are also consistent with the provisions for harmonising child 
protection laws under the Council of Europe’s Cybercrime Convention 
(paragraph 33). Countries acceding to the Convention now prosecute 
offenders perpetrating crimes against children in destination countries 
(Smith et al., 2004; XYZ v Commonwealth (2005)). Reference should also be 
made to the obligations entered into by States under the UNCRC and the 
Optional Protocol. Under Article 3(4) of the Optional Protocol, “each State 
Party shall take measures, where appropriate, to establish the liability of 
legal persons for offences” and to adopt measures that enhance transborder 
detection, investigation and prosecution of individuals engaged in CSEC 
(Article 10(1)). There is some evidence of countries taking their 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

170 Online Child Safety
responsibilities towards eradicating CSEC seriously. Recently, a Memorandum 
of Understanding was concluded between Thailand and Cambodia to re-
form their laws and adopt necessary measures to prevent trafficking of chil-
dren and women in particular (Article 8 MOU). The Bilateral Cooperation for 
Eliminating Trafficking in Children and Women and Assisting Victims of 
Trafficking conforms with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Conventions on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international 
human rights instruments. Another example of the standard setting role of 
the UNCRC can be seen in the amendments introduced by the Australian 
government to its Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 (1995 Criminal 
Code). The broad effect of the amendments would be to reduce the substan-
tive and procedural obstacles facing law enforcement in prosecuting 
Australian nationals who plan to travel overseas to engage in sexual activity 
with minors below the age of 16, as a result of engaging in grooming or 
conducting procurement activities whilst in Australia (Section 272.15). In R 
v ONA (2009), the Court of Appeal in Victoria (Australia) stated that attempts 
to challenge the constitutionality of Section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 
(Cth) or suggest that there was a legitimate distinction between persons 
who travelled overseas with the aim of engaging in sexual activities with 
minors and those who formed such an intention after arrival in the destin-
ation country were unfounded, and failed to recognise the growing social 
and political consensus regarding child sex activities like sex tourism. Child 
sex tourism (CST) can be described as “the sexual exploitation of children 
by offenders who travel away from their home in order to have sexual con-
tact with children” (Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, 2010). 
The UN defines CST as “tourism organized with the primary purpose of fa-
cilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child” 
(UN, A/50/456, paragraph 54). CST is a growing industry – and Web 2.0 
technologies enable individuals to publicise its services (ECPAT, 2008). 
Cybercafés, mobile phones, blogs and websites are some of the technologies 
used to identify locations, collect information of potential victims and book 
flights and accommodation in a foreign country (ECPAT, 2010: 38). With 
increased broadband access and Internet connectivity being made available 
in most tourist destinations, individuals can now access materials and even 
contact victims through mobile phones, chat rooms and IM (ECPAT, 2010: 
45–8). As Neave JA stated unequivocally, the enactment of legislation crimi-
nalising CST is designed to “provide a real and enforceable deterrent to the 
sexual abuse of children outside Australia by Australian citizens and resi-
dents” (2009: paragraph 54). Like many of the enactments we have consid-
ered earlier, the Crimes Amendment Act 1995 is another illustration of 
children’s rights norms and values setting the standards for legislative ac-
tivity. New Zealand has also reviewed its national child protection laws. 
Under Section 144A of the Crimes Act 1961, it is now an offence to engage 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 171
in any sexual activity with a child, which if done in New Zealand would be 
a crime. Additionally, under Section 144C of the 1961 Act, it is also an 
offence to assist or encourage others to travel overseas for the purpose of 
having sex with minors or to promote sex tours. Prohibited acts would now 
extend to booking tickets and reserving accommodation, organising trans-
port to overseas destinations and producing advertising and promotional 
literature relating to child sex tours. Recently, a New Zealand national was 
found to have engaged in these activities and was prosecuted for facilitating 
CST (OCEANZ, 2010). The activities of the accused were subject to an under-
cover operation by the Police Online Child Exploitation across New Zealand 
(OCEANZ) unit. Sex tourism is a subset of a more general global problem of 
human trafficking (Meredith, 2010). Human trafficking of minors has been 
a long-standing issue (ECPAT, 2008). It has been described as a “modern 
phenomenon with ancient roots” (King, 2008: 369). It is beyond the scope 
of this chapter to undertake an examination of this area of child protection 
save for one example, which can be provided to illustrate the transborder 
issues resulting from the interaction between human trafficking and sex 
tourism. § 230.25 of New York’s anti-trafficking legislation, for example, 
holds businesses to account if they provide “travel-related services knowing 
that such services include or are intended to facilitate travel for the purpose 
of patronizing a prostitute, including to a foreign jurisdiction and regardless 
of the legality of prostitution in said foreign jurisdiction”. In People v Barabash 
(2006), the accused operated a tourism services business in New York under 
the name of Big Apple Oriental Tours (BAOT). Trips to Philippines were pro-
vided and “tour guides” were procured to bring the tourists to venues where 
women were available to have sex for money. Evidence was offered showing 
that the tour guides provided the tourists with specific instructions on how 
to engage in sexual activity with women for money. More importantly, the 
price of the package tour included the costs for having sex. These sums of 
money were alleged to have been forwarded to tour guides in the Philippines 
so that the women who engaged in sexual activity with the tourists con-
cerned were paid for the services rendered. The absence of evidence proving 
the complicity of the proprietors proved to be fatal to the prosecution for 
this specific offence. Finally, two additional examples of extraterritorial le-
gislation which reflect governments’ attempts to punish those engaged in 
abusing children through sexual exploitation can be provided. These are 
Section 7(4.1) of Criminal Code in Canada and the United States’ PROTECT 
Act 2003. Parts of the PROTECT Act 2003 incorporate the obligations under 
the Optional Protocol (18 USC §§ 2422–3) which was acknowledged to be 
the case in US v Frank (2007). The PROTECT Act 2003 does not apply retro-
spectively, as was noted by the court in US v Jackson (2007). In US v Bianchi 
(2010), the offender was prosecuted under 18 USC § 2423(c) for engaging in 
illicit sexual conduct in Moldova. The offender in this case engaged in the 
practice of travelling to foreign destinations with the aim of meeting and 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

172 Online Child Safety
engaging in sexual activity with young boys. Between the periods of 
December 2003 and March 2005, the offender travelled to poverty-ridden 
areas in Moldova and Romania to engage in sexual activity with minors. 
The value and significance of extraterritorial legislation cannot be overem-
phasised. Another example of how obligations assumed under international 
conventions are mirrored in the adjudicative jurisdiction process is R v 
Klassen (2008). A Canadian national was prosecuted and convicted for 
importing child sex abuse material into the country. The Supreme Court 
held that the exercise of its extraterritorial legislation was consistent with 
Canada’s obligations assumed under the Optional Protocol, namely, to “take 
such measures as may be necessary to establish its jurisdiction ... [w]hen the 
alleged offender is a national of that State or a person who has his habitual 
residence in its territory” (Article 4(2)(a)) (paragraph 56). Any other con-
struction of the Criminal Code, according to the Supreme Court, would 
have been a derogation of its responsibilities as a sovereign State and as a 
Party to the Conventions protecting children from commercial and sexual 
exploitation:
The universal principle reflects Canada’s commitment under the 
Convention and the Optional Protocol to contribute to the suppression 
of the “significant” “widespread” and “continuing” exploitation of “par-
ticularly vulnerable groups,” but within the limitations of both prescrip-
tive (and adjudicative) jurisdiction and the nationality principle. ((2008) 
paragraphs 97)
Jurisdictional issues can also arise when an individual engages in criminal 
activity on websites located in another jurisdiction. It should be noted, 
however, that existing jurisdictional principles could be adapted to meet 
objections raised by an offender in respect of the competence of a court in 
adjudicating over a matter with a transborder element. In R v Sheppard & 
Whittle (2010), the court was faced with a situation where the appellants 
had posted racially inflammatory material on a website which was hosted 
on a server located in California. Publication of such content breaches the 
criminal laws in the United Kingdom, and arguably protected by free speech 
jurisprudence under the Federal Laws in the United States. The court held 
that the location of the web servers did not prevent the accused from being 
held accountable under UK criminal laws since the online materials were 
accessible to nationals in this jurisdiction. Consequently, the nationality 
principle was applied to subject the offender to the UK criminal laws.
Notwithstanding the enactment of extraterritorial legislation by coun-
tries like Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, 
the transborder nature of child sexual exploitation or abuse activities 
can pose a number of practical investigatory and procedural challenges 
(Perrin, 2010). Prosecution rates are notoriously low and these can be 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 173
attributed in part to the lack of visibility (as the offences take place abroad) 
(Cotter, 2009). NGOs ascribe the low prosecution rate to the lack of pri-
ority given by States to the commercial and sexual exploitation of children 
from less developed economies, in particular to the growing problem of 
CST (Beaulieu, 2008; Healy, 1995). Not surprisingly, public policy concerns 
about the CSEC continue to be expressed with growing regularity in na-
tional and regional child protection forums (West, 2000). In a published 
report, ECPAT regarded the lack of progress made in protecting vulner-
able children from its citizens a “national shame” (2006: 8). At the inter-
national expert meeting on combating CST it was noted that “[v]ery few 
child sex tourists are arrested, tried and sentenced” (ECPAT, 2009: 1). The 
visibility and detection challenges may be compounded by individuals 
meeting up with minors in the most innocuous of venues like public areas, 
hotel lobbies or the homes of the child victims (ECPAT, 2008). Even if in-
formation relating to the nationality of the individual has been obtained, 
the lack of awareness by the general public of the mechanisms for report-
ing suspicions of criminal activity engaged in by foreign travellers and the 
lack of trained law enforcement authority in these countries hinder proper 
investigation and prosecution of child sexual exploitation offenders (High, 
2005). For example, offenders have been known to work as volunteers in 
developing countries assisting in education, health and other care projects, 
as a way of evading detection by authorities. In US v Perlitz (2010) the of-
fender worked as a volunteer to assist “street children” and concealed his 
activities from staff at the organisation for over a decade.
Some efforts have been made by destination countries to deal with 
the problem of sex tourism. Countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and 
Sri Lanka have implemented regulatory measures criminalising CST and 
human trafficking activities. Even though Thailand does not have spe-
cific legislation dealing with CST offences, some enactments passed by the 
legislators do criminalise activities that come within the sphere of CSEC. 
For example, the Measures in Prevention and Suppression of Trafficking in 
Women and Children Act, BE 2540 (1997), now provide law enforcement 
greater investigation powers to curb offences relating to human trafficking 
of women and children (Section 5). Under Section 7 of the Prevention and 
Suppression of Prostitution Act, B.E. 2539 (1996), any person or entity found 
to have advertised or make known to the general public “in a manner appar-
ently indicative of importunity or solicitation for the prostitution of him-
self, herself or another person” can be imprisoned for a maximum of two 
years. Section 10 also subjects parents or persons who have responsibility 
for a minor below the age of 18 years to criminal prosecution for conniving 
in the child sex offences under Section 9. Prostitution and human traffick-
ing, particularly involving children below 18 years, are criminalised in Laos 
(Articles 131–4). In Vietnam, legislation has been passed amending provi-
sions in its Penal Code (No-37/2009/QIII2). Article 115 criminalises sexual 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

174 Online Child Safety
activity with children below the age of 16. The amended Article 119 now 
criminalises “trafficking in humans” and Article 120, clause 2, is replaced 
with “against more than one child”. Finally, in Sri Lanka, the Penal Code 
(Amendment) Act, No. 16 of 2006, inserted some important provisions into 
its legislation, notably Sections 360E (soliciting a minor below the age of 18 
years) and 360C (trafficking).
Given the complexity of gathering relevant information, governments 
have begun to work closely with NGOs and child welfare organisations in 
foreign destinations. ECPAT continues to play an invaluable role in policing 
destinations frequented by individuals engaged in CST, and undertakes edu-
cation and awareness-raising programmes and lobbying initiatives (ECPAT, 
2010: 60–5). It has also established invaluable networks with law enforce-
ment authorities from various countries like Australia, the United Kingdom, 
Canada, France, and the United States. In addition to detecting and iden-
tifying child sexual abuse activity in countries like Bangkok, Cambodia, 
and regions in Eastern Europe and South America, the decision to charge 
and prosecute a national in the country of residence is not as straightfor-
ward as might initially appear. One should not, for example, underestimate 
the difficulties in obtaining relevant and credible evidence that satisfies the 
rules on admissibility in countries like the United States and the United 
Kingdom. Law enforcement in countries where the victim resides may not 
have the resources or possess the skills or expertise in dealing with incidents 
of child sexual abuse. The gathering of physical and medical evidence of 
victims after the abuse may also be a problem if there are inadequate facil-
ities and insufficiently trained personnel. Cultural and economic factors 
may also affect decisions to prosecute. Family members may be reluctant 
to provide evidence incriminating the offender or may have been complicit 
in the commercial sexual exploitation of the child (Garrard, 2006). Victims 
who are subject to sexual abuse and exploitation by foreign nationals may 
not come forward to give evidence against the offenders for fear of repris-
als (US v Bianchi (2007)). Rules on hearsay and the thresholds regarding the 
types of evidence that may be received by the court have implications for 
decisions to prosecute. Another potential barrier to prosecuting individuals 
for engaging in CSEC is the requirement that the victim provide testimony 
in person either by attendance at the trial or through a live video link. 
Finally, without cooperation from the relevant authorities in the destin-
ation country, gathering relevant evidence and witnesses can impose con-
siderable logistical challenges in terms of time, expertise and resources. In 
relation to the United Kingdom, the advice given by the CPS to prosecutors 
and investigators in the United Kingdom is that on receipt of the report of 
alleged child sex offences committed by UK nationals in the destination 
country, law enforcement should arrange with their counterparts to ascer-
tain the best course of action (CPS, 2009). Where multi-jurisdictional ele-
ments are found to be present there may be practical reasons for not having 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 175
the national prosecuted in the home country: the appropriateness of having 
the crime prosecuted in the place where the victims reside, the likelihood of 
prosecution succeeding should the case be heard in the foreign courts, the 
availability of testimony from victims and witnesses, where there are lan-
guage differences, the lengthy process in having the testimonies translated 
into the English language, the availability of extradition and the benefits 
of separate trials. Requests for search and seizures of computers or servers 
located in foreign jurisdictions may take considerable to be processed. We 
have seen, however, that these obstacles are not insurmountable. The use of 
extraterritorial legislation and ratification of the Optional Protocol and the 
Cybercrime Convention can minimise the impact of the dual criminality 
rule on investigation and prosecution procedures. As the House Report lead-
ing to the enactment of the precursor to the PROTECT legislation noted:
There would be no need for a sex tourism statute if foreign countries 
successfully prosecuted US citizens or resident aliens for the child sex 
crimes committed within their borders. However, for reasons ranging 
from ineffective law enforcement, lack of resources, corruption, and 
generally immature legal systems, sex tourists often escape prosecution 
in the host countries. It is in those instances that the United States has 
an interest in pursuing criminal charges in the United States. (House of 
Representatives, 2002: 3)
Reference should also be made to one of the outcomes to the G8 Justice 
and Interior Ministers’ meetings in 2007 and 2008 which provide the 
requisite political impetus in assisting law enforcement to investigate 
and prosecute nationals engaging in the sexual exploitation of children 
abroad. The Ministerial Meeting adopted a paper – “G8 Experience and 
Recommendations: Implementation of Extraterritorial Jurisdiction for Sex 
Crimes against Children” (G8, 2008). Two recommendations from this docu-
ment are of particular relevance in this context. First, it was made clear then 
that the principle of dual criminality should not prevent the prosecution of 
nationals engaging in sexual activity with children abroad, if the underlying 
sexual activity would have been an offence had it taken place in the home 
jurisdiction. Furthermore, it was also stressed that if the destination country 
sets the age of sexual consent lower than that of the home country, or if 
the legislation does not adequately deal with child prostitution, prosecutors 
should not be hampered from prosecuting their nationals and permanent 
residents who sexually abuse children. This is quite an important point. For 
example, with the exception of Section 15 of the SOA 2003, if a UK national 
engages in sexual activity with a child in the destination country, the fact 
that the age of consent in that jurisdiction was 14 years would now not be 
a defence. Additionally, the application of the double jeopardy rule and the 
limited inroads made by Part 10 of the CJA 2003 should be noted. Whilst 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

176 Online Child Safety
the ECPAT report (Beaulieu, 2008) has been overtaken by some positive le-
gislative developments, the central concerns about enforcing child protec-
tion laws in foreign jurisdictions against nationals of the home country are 
still relevant; more specifically, governments could do more to curb, deter 
and prosecute their nationals for exploiting and sexually abusing minors. It 
is important for destination countries which have a thriving sex tourism in-
dustry to enact legislation that defines the scope of sexual offences against 
children and to support law enforcement efforts in investigating and pros-
ecuting offenders. CSEC still continues to be a problem in many tourist 
destinations. For example, NGOs claimed that resorts in Sri Lanka continue 
to attract both locals and tourists (US Dept of State, 2010a). Lack of fund-
ing in raising awareness is seen as contributing to the exploitation of chil-
dren for sex in the country. It was suggested that South Africa was proving 
a popular destination for individuals seeking sexual activity with minors 
(US Dept of State, 2010b). This claim has been denied by the South African 
government. Russia too has been identified as a destination for sex tourism 
(US Dept of State, 2010c). Finally, sex tourism has been a particular problem 
for emerging tourist destinations like Madagascar (US Dept of State, 2010d). 
The growth of the tourism industry and the impact of the financial and eco-
nomic crises on nationals have been seen as contributing to the problem of 
sex tourism in this country (US Dept of Labor, 2009).
In view of some of the jurisdictional constraints facing law enforcement 
in prosecuting transborder crimes, there has been a noticeable trend in the 
development of regional and international policing and information sharing 
networks (see later discussion in this chapter). For example, law enforcement 
agencies increasingly rely on covert operations to identify and investigate 
nationals suspected of engaging in the practice of CST. The US Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE), for example, continues to expend 
its efforts in prosecuting US citizens engaged in sexual activity with minors 
in countries in the Far East like Thailand and Cambodia. ICE coordinates 
its investigations from its office in Seattle, which has links to the agen-
cy’s offices in Bangkok and the Cambodian National Police, Anti-Human 
Trafficking and Child Protection unit. Much of its powers are derived from 
the PROTECT Act 2003, which enables the agency to enforce Federal Laws 
safeguarding children in overseas countries from the sexual predatory activ-
ities of US citizens. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000 also pro-
vides an additional set of provisions, which can be used to deal with child sex 
trafficking. In the Operation named Twisted Traveler, information provided 
to ICE law enforcement authorities by NGOs and the Cambodian govern-
ment led to three Americans being arrested for engaging in sexual activity 
with minors in Cambodia (FBI, 2009). Two hundred suspected paedophiles 
were arrested by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) following a three-year 
investigation, which involved collaboration with national law enforcement 
agencies like CEOP, ICE, the European Police Office (EUROPOL) and the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 177
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (AFP, 2011). In R v Cafferata, 2008 YKTC 
93, the accused was identified as one of a number of Canadians who sub-
scribed to child pornography websites. The identification was part of an 
international child pornography investigation, known as Project Emissary, 
which began in the United States with Canadian involvement. For complete-
ness a brief overview of some of the positive measures aimed at overcoming 
the investigation and prosecution obstacles in child sexual abuse cases with 
a transborder dimension will be provided. These are mutual legal assistance 
(MLA), information exchange between judicial and law enforcement author-
ities, and extradition.
Mutual legal assistance
The Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 replaces the United 
Kingdom’s MLA legislation, contained in Part 1 of the Criminal Justice 
(International Co-operation) Act 1990. This Act implements the MLA provi-
sions of the Schengen Convention and more particularly the Convention 
on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Article 1 of the Convention pro-
vides that Contracting Parties undertake to afford each other, in accord-
ance with the provisions of this instrument, the widest measure of mutual 
assistance in proceedings with regard to offences the punishment of which, 
at the time of the request for assistance, falls within the jurisdiction of the 
judicial authorities of the requesting Party (Rackow et al., 2010). MLA is 
a mechanism made available to law enforcement and prosecutors to ob-
tain information and assistance from their counterparts in another juris-
diction (Rantsev v Cyprus (2010); Pati, 2010). Within the EU, the policy for 
promoting free movement of European citizens has led to a corresponding 
focus by policymakers in developing mechanisms for greater cooperation 
between law enforcement authorities and mutual recognition of decisions 
taken by judges in national legal systems of member states (Sepper, 2010). 
Requests for mutual assistance are understandably subject to a number of 
formal mechanisms. For example, requests have to be made by competent 
judicial authorities to their counterparts. The types of mutual assistance pro-
vided include requests to receive witness or expert testimony via a televised 
or video link, executing letters rogatory, controlled deliveries and conduct 
of surveillance operations on behalf of the requesting judicial authority. 
Responses to requests can, however, take time and delays can undermine 
the pace of investigation and in some instances have seriously undermined 
prosecutions. For example, a prosecution against a British national failed 
after Gloucestershire police’s request to extend the time period for gathering 
and collecting evidence was turned down at the Bristol Crown Court on 15 
June 2010 (Beddoe, 2010). On a separate matter, it should be noted that the 
operation of MLA and extradition procedures will have to be re-examined 
within the context of the EU in the light of the anticipated reforms under 
the Proposed Directive (European Commission, 2010e).

UK Central Authority for the Exchange of Criminal Records
The UK Central Authority for the Exchange of Criminal Records (UKCA-
ECR) provides an important information sharing service to Member States. 
The unit was established under the 2005 EU Council Framework Agreement. 
Member States inform each other of convictions of their nationals to other 
EU Member States. The information that is received is translated and placed 
in a database known as the PNC. Member States can serve requests seeking 
information of criminal records of other nationals in the EU. The type of in-
formation that can be the subject of the notification process as well as the re-
quest includes information about accused, suspects, victims and witnesses.
Extradition
“Extradition” is the process whereby a person is surrendered to a requesting 
State for criminal prosecution (Ayaz v Italy (2010)). In New Zealand v Johnston 
(2011), the court reiterated the point that extradition hearings are not con-
cerned with the merits of the case against the person against whom the re-
quest for release has been made. Individuals can be extradited from foreign 
countries on the basis of an agreement reached between the two countries 
following a request to transfer the accused so as to enable the individual to be 
prosecuted in the national court. In US v Clark (2006), the offender was found 
to have engaged in sexual activities with minors in Cambodia. His activities 
were investigated by an NGO – Action Pour Les Enfants – whose role is to 
rescue children who have been sexually exploited by non-Cambodians. The 
Cambodian National Police investigated the complaint made by the NGO 
and subsequently charged him. The US government had the offender extra-
dited after the Cambodian government acceded to the request. In Ayaz (2010) 
the court rejected the accused’s appeal against his extradition to the request-
ing State (Italy) for child sex offences deemed to have taken place in Italy. 
The court held that his extradition did not violate the double jeopardy rule, 
since the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) did not cover the type of conduct 
for which he was originally sentenced in the United Kingdom. Extradition 
procedures within the EU have been speeded up with the introduction of 
the EAW (Herlin-Karnell, 2010: 824–35). The EAW was introduced by the 
Framework Decision and incorporated into UK law when the Extradition Act 
2003 came into force at the beginning of 2004 (Council of the European 
Union, 2004a,b). A request to have a suspect or accused extradited from a 
Member State will follow if the competent judicial authority concludes at 
the extradition hearing that the offence for which the EAW has been issued 
relates to an extraditable offence, that the bars to extradition are not pre-
sent and that the extradition does not violate the individual’s rights under 
the ECHR (Iwinski v Poland (2011); R (on the application of HH) v Westminster 
City Magistrates’ Court (2011)). One additional matter is worth raising here. 
Framework Decision, 2002/584/JHA, replaces the application of the double 
criminality rule with regard to the offence of sexual exploitation of children

and child pornography (Council of the European Union, 2004a,b). It is suffi-
cient with regard to offences like child pornography and sexual exploitation 
of children, if these are crimes in the issuing Member State for which there 
is a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least 
three years. The enactment of the Policing and Crime Act 2009, in particular 
Part 6, needs to be noted, since it amends the Extradition Act 2003. Sections 
67 and 68, for example, aim to expedite requests for extradition made under 
the Schengen Information System. Articles 3 and 4, however, preserve the 
double jeopardy rule (Ayaz (2010)). The Framework Decision does incorporate 
some safeguards for the individual who is the subject of the EAW, including 
those relating to consent and legal representation. Clearly, where there are 
reasons to show that the grant of extradition will result in the accused being 
subject to torture or degrading treatment on the grounds of gender, race or 
nationality, reassurances need to be obtained that the ends of justice will 
be served, should the extradition request be granted (Coleiro v Malta (2010); 
Janovic v Lithuania (2011)).
Extraterritorial legislation: The solution?
As conventions, treaties and protocols relating to the protection of children 
from sexual abuse and exploitation gain wider acceptance, it is becoming 
apparent that national legal systems are responding to the governance chal-
lenges posed by transborder criminal activity mediated through Web 2.0 
technologies. Many States now subscribe to the standard setting framework 
of instruments like the UNCRC and the Optional Protocol. Extraterritorial 
legislation is only one mechanism through which individuals engaging in 
sexual offences against children in overseas jurisdictions abroad can be pros-
ecuted by law enforcement authorities in national legal systems. Increasingly, 
as information communication technologies are used to mediate the com-
mission of offences against children, information sharing, bilateral treaty 
arrangements and codes of practice now provide a more robust approach to 
governance. To address some of the policing and enforcement issues raised 
by CST, the support of the tourism industry has also been enlisted.
The Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual 
Exploitation in Travel and Tourism
The Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation 
in Travel and Tourism (the Code) was developed as part of the collaborative 
venture between the tourism industry and ECPAT. Signatories to the Code, 
consisting of tour operators, travel organisations, travel agents, hotels, 
undertake to observe the following measures:
To establish an ethical policy regarding CSEC.
1. 
To train the personnel in the country of origin and travel destinations.
2. 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

180 Online Child Safety
To introduce a clause in contracts with suppliers, stating a common re-
3. 
pudiation of CSEC.
To provide information to travellers by means of catalogues, brochures, 
4. 
in-flight films, ticket-slips, home pages, and so on.
To provide information to local “key persons” at the destinations.
5. 
To report annually.
6. 
These principles also adhere closely to the expanding concept of child 
safety governance, which now integrate the obligations under Article 
34 UNCRC and the World Tourism Organisation’s Code (European 
Commission, 1996a: 3). The European Commission has recently ener-
gised its efforts in creating a more coherent policy towards eliminating 
CST in its Proposed Directive (European Commission, 2010e). Under the 
Proposed Directive, Member States will be expected to align their national 
laws with the standards and principles of the CPC Convention and amend 
their rules on jurisdiction “to ensure that child sexual abusers or exploit-
ers from the European Union face prosecution even if they commit their 
crimes outside the European Union, in particular via so-called sex tour-
ism” (ibid.: paragraph 9).
Conclusion
It is possible to identify the principles applicable to a State's exercise of its 
jurisdictional authority. First, States have jurisdiction over criminal acts tak-
ing place within their territory. This jurisdiction extends to criminal acts of 
foreign nationals within its territory. Second, States have jurisdiction over 
its nationals. Third, where a crime has a transborder element, more than 
one State may have jurisdiction over the event in question. Consequently, 
the presumptive rule in many national legal systems is that its criminal 
jurisdiction will not have extraterritorial application unless there are spe-
cific provisions, which permit courts to assert jurisdiction over activities 
that take place beyond the geographical boundaries (Section 72 of the SOA 
2003). 
Criminal jurisdiction and online child sexual 
abuse and exploitation
Framing the problem: The exceptional nature of jurisdiction rules
From a criminal jurisdiction perspective, the Internet is not necessarily 
a phenomenon that poses fundamentally new legal issues or questions. 
Those who view cyberspace as a distinct environment posing complex 
jurisdictional challenges point to the case La LigueContre Le Racisme Et 
L’AntisemitismevYahoo! (2001). The case has generally been regarded as 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 181
epitomising the jurisdictional conflicts that can be created by online ac-
tivities. We should however recall that a sovereign State always has juris-
diction over criminal acts taking place within its territorial boundaries. 
Neither is the extension of these rules to online activity to be regarded 
as inconsistent with long-established jurisdiction principles (R v Sheppard 
& Whittle (2010)). Both rulings illustrate that existing jurisdiction prin-
ciples continue to apply in the online environment. For example, juris-
dictional issues can arise with regard to the publication of illegal content 
on websites. In the United Kingdom, the OPA 1959 makes it an offence to 
“publish” an obscene article or to have an obscene article for publication 
with the aim of commercial gain (Section 2 of the OPA 1959). Publication 
on the Internet would raise potential jurisdictional issues along the lines 
encountered in R v Sheppard & Whittle (2010). In both Perrin (2002) and 
Fellows and Arnold (1997), the judicial view appears to be that the act of 
making available and the potential accessibility of the content within 
the national jurisdiction would be sufficient to hold the offender liable. 
The use of file-sharing software to access, distribute and download child 
abuse content via file-sharing software, albeit its transnational dimen-
sions, is still amenable to jurisdictional principles and rules. For example, 
the question may arise as to whether there can be a “public place” where 
the crimes in question are said to take place on websites. R v Sheppard & 
Whittle (2010) provides one possible response to this question. Another 
can be found in the Indecent Displays (Control) Act 1981; a website 
would be deemed to be a place where the public “have or are permitted 
to have access (whether on payment or otherwise)” (Section 1(3)). The 
fluid nature of information flows is not regarded as curtailing the ability 
of courts to assume jurisdiction. In US v Lynn (2011) the offender was 
charged with a number of offences for receiving, distributing and pos-
sessing child pornography contrary to 18 USCA § 2252(a)(2), 2252(a)(4)
(B). The use of file-sharing software to download visual depictions of 
child pornography was corroborated by evidence showing that the con-
tent had been accessed in Washington and London, and consequently 
satisfied the interstate commerce element. We have previously noted that 
Section 72 of the SOA (2003) allows the courts to subject UK nationals 
to its laws even if sexual offences have transborder dimensions. In R v 
Penner (2010) the offender appealed his convictions for making indecent 
photographs of children,The offender was a Canadian national, and one 
of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether the indecent images 
found on his computer were made in the United Kingdom. The Court of 
Appeal hypothesised that had there been an issue as to whether the child 
abuse content was downloaded outside United Kingdom, prosecution 
would have been able to rely on Section 72 of the SOA 2003. This statu-
tory provision prevents an offender from using the transborder nature of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

182 Online Child Safety
the crime as a defence to prosecution in the United Kingdom, as long as 
it is shown that the act of downloading the photographs is an offence in 
both jurisdictions (paragraph 15).
Why do we hear that cybercrimes are undermining these principles? 
Brenner has suggested that
[c]ybercrime challenges the principles law and has traditionally used to 
determine when a nation has jurisdiction to prohibit certain conduct 
and to sanction those who engage in the prohibited conduct. (Brenner, 
2006: 189)
Those who regard the decentralised characteristics of the Internet as under-
mining criminal jurisdiction principles make two assumptions that can be 
questioned. First, that the transnational character of the Internet somehow 
transforms the character of online activities from their offline versions. 
Second, those existing jurisdictional principles which emerged in a defined 
time period are somehow outdated in the online environment. These 
assumptions would appear to hold true, as Brenner suggests, when one con-
siders the transnational harms resulting from the Love Bug virus (ibid.). The 
virus was unleashed from the Philippines and impaired many computers 
across the globe. Brenner is right to claim that events like the criminal act 
of unleashing malicious code as having a number of consequences for the 
ability of a State to assert its criminal jurisdiction beyond its territory. Two 
additional points need to be noted, however. First, transborder criminal ac-
tivity may be problematic if countries have different substantive and pro-
cedural criminal laws. Second, a particular conduct occurring in a foreign 
jurisdiction harming citizens of other nationalities can give rise to multiple 
countries asserting jurisdictions. It is true that theoretically the global reach 
of the Internet will lead to questions regarding the application of laws and its 
reach – but these are neither novel issues nor do the issues raised pose insur-
mountable difficulties for judges in determining the application of jurisdic-
tion rules and its criminal laws (R v Sheppard & Whittle (2010); cf. Justin Paul 
Savage v R (2010)). A more relevant line of inquiry would be to begin with a 
consideration of the difficulties in securing compliance with national child 
protection laws when the Internet is used to engage in the sexual exploit-
ation of children and related activities (Hersh, 2001: 1831). What this line 
of inquiry suggests is that in an environment of de-centralised networks 
and information flows, national legal systems will continue to face inves-
tigatory challenges due to different legal rules applying to the protection 
of children, difficulties faced in identifying criminal activity or problems 
encountered with collecting digital evidence stored on servers or websites 
hosted in various jurisdictions. The difficulties faced in respect of the latter, 
as Wall observes, stem from the fact that information networks reduce the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 183
risks of detection and accountability (Wall, 2007: 119–26). Indeed, the scale 
of the deviant activity cannot be disassociated from the fact that Web 2.0 
technologies now make available to individuals opportunities to explore pri-
vately their sexual desires without fear of being detected by national law en-
forcement authorities (Quayle et al., 2002). Additionally, there are numerous 
ways of concealing online identities and engaging in criminal activities (e.g. 
registering domain names with false information, encryption, anonymisa-
tion tools and services, providing false details when setting up accounts on 
social networking sites). Another governance concern is the increased use by 
criminal organisations of the Internet to share illegal content and support 
child sexual abuse activities. The media spotlight on the discovery of the 
global child pornography network following Operation Cathedral and the 
prosecution of its members illustrate that information security governance 
is an ongoing process. This investigation involved the efforts of High Tech 
Units in tracking the activities of individuals from 14 countries engaged in 
child pornography. The W0nderland Club’s activities were highly organ-
ised and the group’s leaders vetted membership into this group. The servers 
which were used by the group were frequently moved to avoid detection by 
law enforcement, and the leadership was clearly well versed with adopting 
state-of-the-art encryption and security protocols. Identifying the demand 
and supply channels in the Internet is a complex, resource-intensive process 
(Baartz, 2008; Grabosky, 2007a). The IWF in its recent report highlighted 
the growing demand for child sexual abuse content from a global audience 
(IWF, 2010b). In one instance a website which briefly hosted child sexual 
abuse content (before being taken down) received requests from 25,000 in-
dividual IP addresses worldwide. These requests were also received from mo-
bile Internet accounts and gaming platforms.
Time to re-think the traditional law enforcement model?
In the light of what has been discussed it is apparent that the commer-
cial sexual exploitation offences mediated through decentralised networks 
and electronic media require regulatory responses which effectively address 
the nuances of technology-mediated criminal activity (Dandurand et al., 
2007). It has been suggested that crimes mediated through technology have 
exposed the limitations of current crime control strategies. Unlike offline 
crimes, online criminal activity has a number of features that raise poten-
tial barriers to investigation and prosecution (Brenner, 2004). Brenner iden-
tifies three features which render regulating online criminal activity more 
problematic (2010: 39–47). First, the offender and victim are unlikely to be 
present in the same physical space and time. For example, many of the off-
line sexual crimes against children require the offender and the victim to 
be within proximity of each other. Second, cybercrimes may involve mul-
tiple offenders engaging in child sexual exploitation offences from multiple 
venues and using varied communication platforms. Child pornography 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

184 Online Child Safety
rings have been known to provide live web streaming shows of children 
being sexually exploited to a global audience, whilst facilitating private on-
line bulletin boards and chat rooms. Third, online criminal activity does 
not display the physical cues that define much of regular offline criminal 
activity.
Law enforcement and policing
The Internet enables criminals to avoid the reach of national law enforce-
ment authorities by the expedient use of remote servers and vetting those 
accessing their services (Grabosky, 2007a). In addition to the ease with 
which detection can be avoided, the digitalisation of content also poses 
challenges for policing and investigation. As was noted in Chapter 3, decen-
tralised communication networks, mobile computing and broadband tech-
nology make available new avenues through which illegal content can be 
accessed (Grabosky, 2007b: 145–61). Advances in multimedia technologies 
and platforms enable child abuse and illegal content to be easily created, 
stored, reproduced and accessed (R v Jewell and Gramlick (1995)). The vol-
umes of evidence that law enforcement have to process also make the in-
vestigation and prosecution task burdensome (Smith et al., 2004: 128–30). 
In Saddler v R (2009) the offender was charged and convicted of offences 
relating to possession of child pornography contrary to Section 91H(3) of 
the Crimes Act 1900. As part of the process for framing the charge and pro-
viding supporting relevant and admissible evidence, law enforcement had 
to process 45,000 images, many of which were stored in portable media 
devices and external hard drives. The offender in Hitchen v R (2009) was 
found to be in possession of 729,000 child pornographic images and 2,700 
video files depicting child pornography. These cases illustrate some of the 
challenges facing law enforcement as they attempt to investigate and frame 
the indictment appropriately. P2P networks, bulletin boards, chat rooms 
and websites now provide new channels and opportunities for evading 
detection by law enforcement. The anonymity and convenience commu-
nication technologies provide has also contributed to the rise in demand 
for child sexual abuse content (Harrison, 2006). Sexual grooming can now 
be conducted privately, and the interactions between the perpetrator and 
victim be web-streamed easily across the Internet to like-minded individ-
uals in the deviant community. Until his arrest, the offender in R v Lee 
(2010) was found to have downloaded onto his computer child pornography 
from file-sharing programmes. Most file-sharing programmes like “eMule” 
and “LimeWire” permit users to make contents available on a shared folder 
to other users of the programme from anywhere in the world and at any-
time when the computer is switched on (R v Johannson (2008)). Email and 
IM now enable individuals to engage in other forms of child sexual ex-
ploitation and abuse – human trafficking and sex tourism. The Canadian 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 185
Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) reported that the Internet continues to 
be used by criminal organisations to coordinate their activities (CSIS, 2007; 
FBI, 2008). Finally, communication networks enable users to connect with 
others, access and create content, exchange and share information and re-
inforce their deviant values (R v Hopps (2010), paragraphs 26–30). It is this 
scale of misuse of Web 2.0 technologies for hosting, accessing, communi-
cating and exchanging information and the commercial gains derived as a 
consequence that has led to the Internet and communication technologies 
becoming a popular medium for organised criminal activity (Kim-Kwang, 
2009). Online paedophile rings, for example, leverage the decentralised net-
work structure of the Internet and fuel the market for CSEC. These organ-
ised groups operate subscription services for IRC web streaming of live child 
sexual abuse (ibid., 2009: 281). Additionally, Kim-Kwang is right to conclude 
that policing and enforcing online criminal activities are beyond the cap-
abilities of individual national legal systems (2009: 282). Online child sex 
rings use specific Internet relay channels and P2P file-sharing networks to 
enable their members to create and distribute child sexual abuse content as 
well as produce literature which provides like-minded individuals with strat-
egies and techniques for avoiding prosecution for child sex offences (Baartz, 
2008). Access to these groups is tightly controlled through the adoption of 
secret vetting protocols. In a recent investigation, a global child pornog-
raphy network was found to have had more than 12 million hits on its web-
site from 170 countries (AFP, 2009). In R v Hopps (2010) the witness for the 
Crown, who was a member of the RCMP and ICE, noted that over 50,000 
individuals were engaged in the global trade in child pornography and that 
legitimate company servers were hijacked to peddle the content (paragraphs 
34–7). Law enforcement operations with particular expertise in high-tech 
crimes have noted an increase transborder criminal activity (AFP, 2008). In 
the United States, child abuse images are increasingly depicting very young 
children and increasing violence. Since 2010, the hotline Cybertips received 
175,000 reports of online child pornography; between 1996 and 2007, there 
was an increase in child exploitation cases; prosecutions for child pornog-
raphy cases between 1994 and 2006 rose to 82 per cent; and there was a cor-
relation between child pornography and contact offences (HRC, 2011: 6).
These depressing findings should not lead us to assume that the challenges 
facing national legal systems and law enforcement require additional legis-
lation. In recent years a number of law enforcement bodies have directed 
their strategies towards developing and improving their investigative skills 
and intelligence with the aim of disrupting online commercial and sexual 
exploitation channels. As indicated in Chapter 3, the online environment 
also provides “digital trails” which can assist law enforcement. In T v the 
Queen (2011), the incriminating evidence used to prosecute the offender 
for possession of child abuse content was found on his computer, memory

186 Online Child Safety
stick and other digital portable storage devices. When commercial sexual 
exploitation activities are reported, the decision to prosecute and even the 
ability to prosecute will be influenced by three factors: relevant legislative 
authority; availability of evidence and intelligence sharing. In some respects 
the online environment creates “digital trails” which are particularly use-
ful for law enforcement when investigating child sexual exploitation inci-
dents. Some of the investigative techniques used to bring offenders before 
the courts are nothing more than good examples of law enforcement adopt-
ing appropriate investigation strategies, networking and coordination with 
other national policing agencies or organisations (see below). In R v Collins 
(2011) the offender was traced via the telephone which was used to access the 
website for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. 
In R v Parnell (2004) the accused was convicted of the crimes of attempted 
incitement to commit buggery, and attempted incitement to an act of gross 
indecency with a male under the age of 16. Unknown to the accused, the Sri 
Lankan authorities had intercepted his email. On his return to England, the 
accused was arrested and prosecuted under Section 2 of the Sexual Offences 
(Conspiracy and Incitement) Act 1996.
Policing networks
INTERPOL
This organisation has as its mission the prevention or combating of inter-
national crime by facilitating cross-border police cooperation, and supports 
and assists all organisations, authorities and services.1 As part of its work, the 
International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) assists law enforce-
ment in investigating and prosecuting individuals and organisations for 
crimes against children. One important contribution made by INTERPOL is 
the provision of trained investigators with access to the International Child 
Sexual Exploitation image database (ICSE DB) via a secure communication 
network. The database is funded by the European Commission and has 
received the backing of the G8. The INTERPOL Child Abuse Image Database 
(ICAID) was created in 2001 and now has over 520,000 images submitted by 
36 Member States. Two examples can be provided to highlight the value of 
the database and information sharing policies as effective child protection 
measures. The first concerns two young girls, aged 9 and 11 years, who were 
sexually abused and filmed. A video of the abuse was found in Australia, 
where authorities requested the assistance of the INTERPOL General 
Secretariat to identify the language spoken and hence possibly the location 
of the victims. Following a lengthy investigation coordinated by INTERPOL, 
the child victims were located in Belgium and rescued. Their father and the 
abuser were subsequently arrested. The individual filming the abuse was 
traced to Italy and subsequently arrested. The second involves an investi-
gation undertaken by a Canadian police officer who discovered a number
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Transborder Challenges 187
 of child abuse images. He approached INTERPOL to conduct some forensic 
image analysis. During the image analysis, an officer noted that some of the 
background items including the computer keyboard pointed strongly to the 
abuse images being made in Spain. The subsequent investigation led to the 
uncovering of a child rapist network operating in Spain and the identifica-
tion and rescue of a further seven victims below the age of four years.
CIRCAMP
Apart from INTERPOL, COSPOL Internet Related Child Abuse Material 
Project (CIRCAMP) provides invaluable organisational support to law en-
forcement authorities investigating online child sexual exploitation.2 The 
overall aim of the CIRCAMP network is to combine the resources of and im-
prove coordination between law enforcement agencies in Europe. According 
to CIRCAMP, eleven Member States (Norway, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, 
France, Ireland, Malta, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands, UK) are now taking part 
in a law enforcement project aimed at preventing access to child sexual abuse 
material. CIRCAMP also cooperates and shares information with non-EU 
Member States and these now include Switzerland and New Zealand.
EUROPOL
EUROPOL is another organisation which supports law enforcement agen-
cies in the EU Member States.3 As criminals become more organised and 
skilled in evading detection by law enforcement through the use of sophis-
ticated technologies and payment mechanisms, EUROPOL aims to support 
law enforcement agencies in Member States by providing intelligence ana-
lysis, by training of law enforcement and facilitating information sharing. 
A number of its services are directly relevant to enhancing the effectiveness 
of national law enforcement agencies in relation to CSEC. For example, 
to ensure that law enforcement and judges have the requisite skills and 
knowledge, EUROPOL organises an annual training course “Combating the 
Sexual Exploitation of Children on the Internet” focusing on the legal, in-
vestigatory and evidentiary issues in this regard. This training course is also 
made available to law enforcement agencies around the world. It is envis-
aged that by creating such a forum, greater awareness and understanding of 
the investigation and enforcement strategies to address technology-enabled 
crimes can be promoted, investigators can share their experiences and prac-
tices and networks for ongoing and future collaboration and coordination 
of law enforcement efforts can be improved. Since 2001, EUROPOL has 
used the Analytical Work File (AWF) to support investigations undertaken 
by Member States in dealing with criminal activity relating to the sexual 
exploitation of children. In 2007, the AWF was used to coordinate and sup-
port investigations undertaken under Operation Koala, which involved 29 
countries within and outside the EU. Over 400 suspects were identified, 
and from the resulting investigation around 100 child sex offenders were 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

arrested. EUROPOL has a number of strategic arrangements with organisa-
tions outside the EU. The agreements include exchanging specialist know-
ledge, disseminating strategic intelligence, production of general situation 
reports, sharing of information on investigative procedures and crime pre-
vention methods, participation in training activities as well as providing 
advice and support in individual investigations. An example of the latter 
can be in seen in the agreement EUROPOL has with Australia. Its contact 
point is the AFP. One of the areas for cooperation involves the “trade in 
human beings”, which covers the “subjection of a person to the real and 
illegal sway of other persons by using violence or menaces or by abuse of 
authority or intrigue, especially with a view to the exploitation of prosti-
tution, forms of sexual exploitation and assault of minors or trade in aban-
doned children”.
VGT
The Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT) comprises national law enforcement agen-
cies coordinating their resources and intelligence to protect children from 
online child abuse.4 The VGT was set up in 2003 to deal with the global rise of 
online child sexual exploitation activity. The current membership of the VGT 
include EUROPOL, the AFP, CEOP, the Italian Postal and Communication 
Police Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the US Department of 
Homeland Security, INTERPOL, the Ministry of Interior for the United Arab 
Emirates and New Zealand Police. The VGT enables investigations to be better 
coordinated and facilitates information sharing at regional and international 
levels. To date more than 200 commercial child sexual abuse websites have 
been dismantled. The VGT engaged in an international investigation known 
as Operation Basket. It commenced investigations as far back as 2006 follow-
ing intelligence provided by the United States Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement investigation. An important part of the investigation involved 
the identification of the criminal organisation coordinating the commer-
cial exploitation of online child sexual abuse content. During the course of 
the investigation over 30,000 customers from 132 countries were identified. 
Law enforcement authorities around the world including the Netherlands, 
Germany, the Czech Republic, Belarus and Italy collaborated with the VGT. In 
addition to engaging with law enforcement activity, the VGT now works with 
over 96 countries to assist them in drafting UNCRC compliant laws.
CEOP
CEOP, the UK law enforcement agency, continues lead child safety issues in 
the United Kingdom. It recently reported the dismantling of a paedophile 
network on the social networking site Facebook (CEOP, 2010b). The UK na-
tional, Ian Green, was the subject of an international operation known as 
Operation Ocean. The High Tech Operations Unit of the AFP provided CEOP 
with intelligence regarding the activities of an individual in the United

Kingdom who was coordinating the making and distribution of thousands 
of child abuse images. Green used the anonymity the Internet provides to 
create false Facebook profiles, group accounts and email addresses to down-
load and distribute child sexual abuse images and then proceeded to share 
these on his home page. CEOP managed to infiltrate this network despite 
the efforts of Ian Green to screen and monitor individuals who gained entry 
into the private groups on Facebook. Ian Green pleaded guilty to a range 
of offences under the PCA 1978 and for breaching his terms under the Sex 
Offenders Register. The AFP National Manager Commander Neil Gaughan 
observed that
policing in this social networking environment is a challenge, but the 
co-operation during this operation demonstrates that international law 
enforcement is united in a global fight against online child exploitation 
material. (CEOP, 2010b)
Project Safe Childhood
In the United States, the Project Safe Childhood initiative was devel-
oped to combat child exploitation and abuse.5 It was launched by the 
Department of Justice in 2006 and led by the United States Attorneys’ 
Offices and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity 
Section. In 2010, as part of an ongoing investigation, prosecutions 
were brought against an individual for transporting child pornography 
through an Internet bulletin board. At least 36 subscribers were found 
to have used this facility to trade in thousands of images and videos of 
child pornography. This case is particularly relevant to the discussion 
regarding the strategic significance of coordinating policing networks at 
a global level. This was an international investigation known as the Lost 
Boy online bulletin board. The investigation was launched in collabor-
ation with international law enforcement agencies and it culminated in a 
number of individuals being prosecuted for a wide range of child exploit-
ation offences. It was claimed that the Lost Boy network comprised mem-
bers from the United States, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany 
and New Zealand.
FCACP
Increasingly, law enforcement has expanded its investigation strategies by 
engaging with the banking sector and online intermediaries to disrupt the 
misuse of Web 2.0 technologies for commercial and sexual exploitation of 
children activities. In recent years, the Financial Coalition against Child 
Pornography (FCACP), comprising major banks, credit card companies, 
electronic payment networks, third-party payments companies, and online 
services companies, have provided invaluable support to law enforcement 
efforts in disrupting the growing commercial child sexual exploitation

industry.6 The European arm of the FCACP (European Financial Coalition 
(EFC)) was set up, partly in response to NGO and public concerns about 
the growth in commercial child sexual abuse websites.7 FCACP has a global 
presence and networks with national law enforcement authorities across 
the world. This strategic development is largely the product of intelligence 
information obtained by law enforcement indicating that the child abuse 
industry was using the online environment to channel its funds and de-
velop alternative payment mechanisms to avoid detection. The activities 
of the FCACP are coordinated by the NCMEC, which has a hotline for re-
ceiving anonymous reports about the websites engaging in commercial 
sexual exploitation – CyberTipline. A number of web hosting companies 
have also supported these efforts. For example, GoDaddy.com, which is 
one of the largest hosting companies in the world, collaborates with the 
FCACP. Recently, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation compiled a 
code of practice to establish due diligence standards members can use in 
the merchant application and verification protocols to detect child por-
nographers and prevent them from using the online payment channels to 
fund their practices. The “Internet Merchant Acquisition and Monitoring 
Best Practices for the Prevention and Detection of Commercial Child 
Pornography” can be seen as an illustration of how legal standards and 
principles governing the protection of children from commercial and 
sexual abuse can be extended to businesses. The guidance provides due 
diligence protocols, which can be used to process merchant applications 
and verify the accounts to ensure that these platforms do not provide an 
avenue for profiting from child pornography.
An international cybercrime treaty
In the light of the above discussion, it is not entirely clear whether reforms 
of the principles applicable to extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction will have 
a significant impact, when compared with, for example, efforts directed to-
wards funding and supporting current governance measures like informa-
tion sharing, promoting collaboration between NGOs, law enforcement and 
the financial sector, and assisting communities and ethnic minorities who 
are particularly vulnerable to commercial and sexual exploitation. In view 
of the benefits in creating a safer online environment for children through 
greater cooperation and collaboration between law enforcement agencies 
and prosecuting authorities nationally, regionally and globally, there is an 
emerging view that national efforts to secure compliance with child pro-
tection laws would be better served by countries subscribing to a global 
treaty (Dandurand, et al., 2007). These views are now being canvassed in 
different forums. At the Twelfth UN Congress on Crime Prevention and 
Criminal Justice a working paper prepared by the Secretariat explored 
the possibility of establishing a global convention on cybercrime.8 Some

doubt might be expressed as to whether an additional treaty may be what
is required presently. The Cybercrime Convention, which came into force 
in 2004, involved six years of negotiation. It has been acceded to or rati-
fied by 30 countries. Forty-seven countries have signed the Convention. 
The United Kingdom, Canada, Russia, Japan and Australia have yet to ratify 
the Convention.9 Of those who have ratified it, 15 countries have indicated 
reservations to certain parts of the Convention. This Convention, as will be 
discussed in the next chapter, covers, amongst other crimes, the substantive 
and procedural rules on child sexual abuse images. Even though a global 
convention holds out the promise of a new standard setting framework, as 
anyone who has followed the progress of the Cybercrime Convention, and 
the reservations placed by signatories, will attest, obtaining global agree-
ment on promoting judicial and law enforcement cooperation on topics like 
child pornography, prostitution and human trafficking is unlikely to be a 
straightforward matter.
Conclusion
Extraterritorial legislation has an important role in managing the trans-
national issues raised by nationals engaging in commercial and sexual 
exploitation of children in foreign jurisdictions. One conclusion reached 
is that the substantive “jurisdictional” challenges raised by the conver-
gence in broadcasting, telecommunications and social media are not 
as problematic as might appear at first blush, when compared with, for 
example, the investigatory challenges facing law enforcement at this 
present time. In an environment of decentralised communication net-
works, where information can be easily created and distributed at a speed 
and scale that is unparalleled in history, it may be true to say that the 
“traditional mechanisms of international cooperation, including letters 
rogatory, mutual assistance and other formalities with roots in the 19th 
century and earlier, are ill-suited” (Smith et al., 2004: 120). The Internet 
now makes it easier for individuals to engage in criminal activities from 
jurisdictions which either do not have effective policing resources or do 
not have laws protecting children from abuse and sexual exploitation. 
From a legal point of view the Internet does not impose any new sub-
stantive challenges to extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction principles. It 
has also been shown that the Internet can make the task of investigating 
and prosecuting offenders much easier, as law enforcement organisations 
share intelligence with each other. Information sharing, greater collabor-
ation with the banking sector, NGOs, ISPs and the use of sting operations 
can significantly enhance the prosecution of child sexual abuse and ex-
ploitation offenders even when criminal deviants misuse de-centralised 
network structures and information flows.

Overview
Safeguarding children from sexual harm and abuse is a global phenom-
enon. The MSIG framework consists of an expanding regulatory landscape 
of laws, treaties and conventions and involves a range of stakeholders and 
interests. The globalisation of risks, including those relating to the CSEC, 
has also resulted in harmonisation efforts and cooperation at national, re-
gional and international levels (OECD, 2009). The UN and its institutions, 
the EU and the Council of Europe now provide important platforms for 
mobilising online child safety governance strategies and policymaking. The 
aim of this chapter is to reflect on some of the significant institutional gov-
ernance responses to combating child sexual exploitation and abuse. It is 
not the intention to undertake a comprehensive analysis of these responses 
but, rather, the focus will be on the contributions these institutions make 
in defining the standards and principles which provide the benchmark 
for the MSIG policymaking activity (ITU, 2008b). The chapter has three 
parts. The first part describes the policymaking role of the UN within the 
framework provided by the UNCRC and highlights some of the principal 
regulatory and policy developments which continue to inform the way gov-
ernments and stakeholders now approach online sexual exploitation and 
abuse of children. The second part considers the important role of the EU, 
with particular reference to the SIP. The final part describes the significance 
of the increasing contributions by the Council of Europe in this area of 
policymaking.
The United Nations and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child
In May 2002, the UN hosted a Special Session of the UN General Assembly 
on Children (UN, 2002). The goal of the Special Session was to provide 
delegates with an opportunity to review the progress made since the World

Summit for Children in 1990. At the sixty-first session, a follow-up report 
to the Special Session of the General Assembly on children was presented 
(UN, 2006b). In this report, the General Assembly was informed that over 
140 and 118 countries had signed the UNCRC and the Optional Protocol, 
respectively. One hundred and forty-six countries have now ratified the ILO 
Convention 138, whilst another 161 countries ratified the ILO Convention 
No. 182. The 2006 Study on Violence against Children is only one of many 
child protection initiatives undertaken by the UN and its organisations 
(UN, 2006a). It is an important study since it provides one of the most com-
pelling accounts of the violence and abuse inflicted on children across the 
world. Its conclusions are both poignant and timely particularly as there 
is now growing momentum in encouraging governments to renew their 
commitments to promoting children’s rights within their jurisdictions. 
These are important developments. Accession to international obligations is 
viewed as a prelude to signatory countries demonstrating their commitment 
towards enhancing the welfare and development of children in their na-
tional plans. Increasingly, safeguarding children from violence is regarded 
as an important limb in the Millennium Development Goals within the UN 
Development Assistance Framework. The UN’s commitment to children’s 
rights is well-known and the Special Session can be viewed as an appropriate 
illustration of how child protection governance strategies can evolve from 
the interplay between the UN, governments and civil society. The UNCRC, 
which lies at the core of the issues relating to children’s safety and well-
being, draws many of its central principles and norms from the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights 1948. In the General Assembly Resolution, the 
UNCRC, its provisions and other human rights instruments were regarded 
as standard setting instruments. It is generally recognised that the realisa-
tion of the rights under the UNCRC would be dependent on States’ willing-
ness to cooperate and provide mutual assistance (Articles 4 and 28(3)). The 
preamble to the UNCRC regards children as beneficiaries of all fundamental 
human rights.1 The key provisions of the UNCRC relevant to the subject of 
sexual exploitation of children are as follows. First, the Convention rights 
and obligations are owed only to a “child”, who for the purposes of the 
UNCRC is any person below the age of 18 years (Article 1). Clearly, this is 
an important provision, as the substantive rights under the UNCRC do not 
extend to individuals beyond this age group. However, it should be noted 
that a number of countries have stipulated the legal age of the child at 16 
years or even lower. This has obvious implications for the level of protection 
accorded to children in areas like online sexual solicitation, CST and child 
pornography. Second, States are vested with a number of obligations towards 
children, which is perhaps an acknowledgement that children live in a pol-
itical, legal and social environment where institutions ultimately decide on 
issues that concern their development, safety and well-being. Third, chil-
dren are envisaged as enjoying civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

rights. These are described as “protection rights”, “participation rights” and 
“survival and development rights”. Children who have particular needs or 
who are vulnerable are regarded as meriting additional protection. There 
are four principles which inform the standard setting role of the UNCRC: 
non-discrimination; the best interests of the child being a primary consid-
eration in all decisions concerning children; the right to survival and devel-
opment and respect for the views of the child. There have been considerable 
attempts made in integrating the human rights discourse into the subject 
of children’s rights and an assessment of their normative foundations is be-
yond the scope of the book (Fortin, 2010).
Safeguarding children against violence is a fundamental principle in 
child protection. Article 19 of the UNCRC provides that States “take all ap-
propriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures” to 
protect children from all forms of violence. The UN continues to play an 
important role in addressing the scale of violence against children, in par-
ticular, by drawing attention to the commercial and sexual exploitation of 
children in society. States are urged, for example, to protect children from 
these forms of violence by taking “all appropriate national, bilateral and 
multilateral measures” (Article 34, UNCRC). Article 34 encapsulates much of 
the thinking that regards safeguarding children from violence as a human 
right and anticipates an important role for international, regional and na-
tional cooperation (Table 5.1).
The UNCRC also provides a framework where States voluntarily assume 
the obligation to realise the rights of children in society. The overriding 
principle is set out in Article 3, which elevates the best interests principle as 
a primary consideration for all actions concerning children. Signatories to 
the UNCRC commit themselves to furthering the best interests of the child

when formulating policies or taking decisions which have a direct or indirect 
bearing on children (Alston, 1994). The aim of Article 3 is to provide gov-
ernments and adults in society with a benchmark against which their inter-
actions with children and their decisions can be evaluated. Furthermore, 
the wording in Article 3 suggests that even if the child’s best interests were 
determined, it is not decisive of the outcome to any action taken by public 
or private entities since other considerations may have to be taken into 
account. It is not surprising to discover that there is no comprehensive def-
inition of what “best interests” might mean (Freeman, 2007). This is under-
standable, since the determination what is a child’s best interests will need 
to be carefully considered alongside the obligations traditionally vested in 
the family in determining matters affecting the child’s development, safety 
and well-being. This has not stopped attempts being made to articulate the 
scope of the principle. Some have suggested that it is misleading to think 
of “children’s rights”, since children are incapable of determining what is 
in their best interests (Purdy, 1994: 223–41). A common-sense view that 
certain limits be imposed specially on children would resonate very much 
with parents and educators (ibid., 1994: 224). Others have a more funda-
mental objection to the concept of children’s rights (O’Neill, 1988: 445–63). 
O’Neill’s objection can be traced back to the belief that children are not of 
the same category of groups of individuals where the recognition of rights 
is regarded as an instrument through which individuals can be freed from 
oppression (ibid., 1988: 461). Of course, we can take issue with the view 
that children should not be beneficiaries of rights on the basis that they are 
dependants rather than an oppressed group. O’Neill’s thesis could, how-
ever, be viewed as emphasising the role of social norms in enhancing the 
relational aspect in the interactions that children have with their parents. 
Children, according to her, have a fundamentally different relationship with 
society and more specifically their parents (1988: 456–9). Her arguments 
about the central role of parents in providing children with an appropriate 
environment through which they can realise and develop their abilities and 
be nurtured raise a wider and well-discussed issue, the arguments about 
paternalism and autonomy (Fortin, 2010: 19–29). It is important to stress 
that notwithstanding the arguments about how we should view children 
and the way the enjoyment of their rights are realised in society, there is 
unlikely to be any disagreement that we should “take children’s rights more 
seriously” (Freeman, 1992: 53). According to Freeman, the discourse on chil-
dren’s rights is compatible with societal understanding and expectation that 
whilst we should acknowledge that a child is an autonomous human being 
it does not foreclose interventions deemed necessary to safeguard its health 
and well-being (ibid., 1992: 67–8). Eekelaar has framed the autonomy/pro-
tection debate in terms of the interests that the law has or ought to uphold 
in the area of public policies which affect children (Eekelaar, 1986). One 
is inclined to agree with his characterisation of the debate. In tracing the

emergence of the concept of children’s rights in societies, he alerts us to 
instances where the law has, ironically, had to intervene not only in cases of 
violence and abuse towards children, but it has also, in extreme cases, had 
to curb the protective impulses that motivated many of the actions of lov-
ing and caring individuals (ibid., 1986: 162). The Safeguarding Vulnerable 
Groups Act 2006 illustrates the role of law in implementing vetting proto-
cols that protect children from coming into close contact with certain cat-
egories of individuals deemed to pose risks to their safety and well-being. 
When approaching the subject of children’s rights, Eekelaar argues that we 
need to do two things. First, we need to articulate the interests, which can 
be made the subject of policymaking – basic, developmental and autonomy 
(ibid., 1986: 170). Second, given that children may not necessarily be in a 
position to make informed decisions, Eekelaar suggests that it is
necessary therefore to make some kind of imaginative leap and guess 
what a child might retrospectively have wanted once it reaches a pos-
ition of maturity. In doing this, values of the adult world of the indi-
vidual adults will inevitably enter. This is not to be deplored, but openly 
accepted. It encourages debates about these values. (Ibid.)
A “basic interest” would be what we regard as core interests without which 
the developmental or autonomy interests cannot be fully realised. Basic 
interests are those which ensure that the child’s physical, emotional and 
intellectual integrity is protected. Developmental interests will consist of 
those which a child can expect from society to enable it to maximise its 
innate abilities. Finally, autonomy interests could involve a child’s expect-
ation of its “freedom to choose his own lifestyle and to enter social relations 
according to his own inclinations uncontrolled by the authority of the adult 
world” (ibid., 1986: 171). According to Eekelaar the autonomy interest is 
subordinated to other interests, and he accepts that the interplay of each 
of the interests may in some contexts result in conflicts involving the State 
and parents. He uses the example of the case of Gillick v West Norfolk and 
Wisbech Area Health Authority to highlight an issue of contemporary rele-
vance – the right of a child to make mistakes (1986: 182). The conflict in 
this case originated from a circular issued by the Department of Health and 
Social Security which stated that although it was desirable for a child to seek 
parental advice about contraception, a child under 16 could seek counsel-
ling and treatment with a doctor instead. On the specific issue of whether a 
child below the age of 16 had the capacity to give valid consent, the House 
of Lords by a bare majority ruled in favour of the child’s autonomy interests 
(1986: 180).
To conclude this brief discussion of the best interests principle, it should 
be apparent that just as the end-to-end principle raises profound questions 
about how States should now address the governance challenges posed by 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 197
technology-mediated offences against children, the best interests principle 
also raises policy issues regarding the basic, developmental and autonomy 
interests that ought to guide policymakers, parents and educators seeking 
to enhance the safety of children in the online environment. Some of these 
policy issues are already being encountered as policymakers attempt to deal 
with children’s behaviour on network publics, “sexting” and access to “in-
appropriate” content. More specifically, in adapting legal, technological and 
social norms to the online environment, we in turn have to assess how 
best each of the interests can be balanced (e.g. access to content, develop-
ment, social relations, expression and identity formation) when children 
and adults may have different expectations of how the former should man-
age their online activities. As children’s rights become mainstream in pol-
icymaking activity and discourse, concerns about the encroachment into a 
child’s autonomy will no doubt figure in tussles between parents and chil-
dren, particularly as the former (as purchasers of mobile phones and com-
puters) will define the ground rules for access and use of these technologies 
(Castells et al., 2007: 147). With ever-increasing convergence between tech-
nology and mobile computing culture, parents and children have to wrestle 
“more often than not, the perceptions of threat are exaggerated in narrative 
accounts from both media coverage and interpersonal channels” (Castells et 
al., 2007: 114). The parallels between the protection/autonomy concerns on 
the one hand and Beck’s “risk society” and the individualisation of risk on 
the other are difficult to ignore.
One way by which States demonstrate their commitment to children’s 
safety and well-being is through the development and implementation of 
policies, procedures and legislation, which provide the foundation “for the 
full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up 
in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and under-
standing” (UNCRC, 1989), the emphasis here being that whichever settings 
or contexts children find themselves in, there is an expectation that policy-
makers must, as a minimum, ensure that the basic and developmental inter-
ests are accommodated without undermining a child’s ability to engage and 
participate in society. Additionally, it is also recognised that the opportun-
ities for development, participation and enjoyment of human rights can be 
impaired if appropriate legal safeguards are not available to protect chil-
dren’s physical and emotional integrity. The key point to note here is the 
particular role of the State in creating a regulatory framework that enables 
all individuals in society to understand and comply with the established 
standards and principles.
Committee on the Rights of the Child
Clearly, some mechanism needs to be in place to ensure that the obligations 
assumed by the signatories under the UNCRC are complied with. The role 
of the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) is particularly relevant 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

here. Article 43 can be seen as one practical response towards creating a 
framework through which issues regarding the scope and implementation 
of the UNCRC by signatories can be addressed. The CRC consists of a body 
of experts who monitor and review the implementation by States of their 
obligations undertaken under the UNCRC. By acceding to the UNCRC, 
States agree to subject efforts made to comply with the obligations assumed 
under the UNCRC to scrutiny by the CRC. There are a number of benefits 
in having this regulatory oversight mechanism. Such a process, for instance, 
not only increases the likelihood of compliance but it also ensures that par-
ticular problems or issues regarding the implementation of the UNCRC 
that are specific to a particular culture or country can be identified and 
addressed. States are required to ensure that the reports submitted by them 
demonstrate clearly the relationship between the specific policies and meas-
ures implemented and the Convention obligations. A State submitting a re-
port can, for example, identify the measures it has put in place to protect 
and promote the rights of the child. It may also be that the report will 
set out information regarding the steps already being taken to advance the 
safety and well-being of children. Finally, the report provides States with an 
opportunity to highlight particular problems encountered when fulfilling 
its obligations under the UNCRC. The CRC normally convenes three ses-
sions per annum and publishes its findings in the form of comments on 
the issues raised by the report. An additional part of the CRC’s remit is 
the monitoring of States’ compliance with the obligations assumed under 
the two Optional Protocols to the UNCRC. The CRC also releases into the 
public domain its “General Comments” – which consists of its interpret-
ation of human rights provisions and thematic issues. This communication 
serves to clarify particular aspects of the UNCRC or even identify matters 
that States and individuals need to have in mind when formulating govern-
ance responses affecting children. For example, in 2009, the CRC issued a 
General Comment No. 12, which addressed the paradoxical character of the 
legal and social status of children, and emphasised the fact that whilst chil-
dren may not possess the autonomy of adults, States still had to regard them 
as legitimate subjects of rights (CRC, 2009). This General Comment sup-
ported the findings of the Secretary-General’s 2006 Study on Violence against 
Children, and stated that children’s views should be obtained or be given due 
weight in all aspects of managing their safety. Additionally, it was felt that 
a child’s “right to be heard” had an important place in the formulation of 
governance strategies and measures (ibid., 2009: paragraph 120). One prac-
tical issue that is often raised in the reporting process is whether States have 
taken “all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures” in 
accordance with their undertakings under the UNCRC. This is a particularly 
important issue when determining a State’s compliance with its obligations 
under the UNCRC. According to the CRC, in its General Comment No. 
5, governments need to undertake a two-stage process when determining 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 199
compliance with their obligations under the UNCRC (CRC, 2003: paragraph 
1). First, when implementing the measures necessary for the realisation of 
the rights, a State is required at the first instance to engage with all stake-
holders, including children. During this period of engagement, not only 
has the State to seek the views of the stakeholders, but it is also required to 
demonstrate that its domestic legislation is compatible with both the let-
ter and the spirit of the UNCRC and, more crucially, that these rules are 
being appropriately enforced. Second, when States submit their reports to 
the CRC, there is an expectation that the actions taken to comply with the 
UNCRC are clearly described and evidenced. The forms of evidence that can 
be offered include measures like campaigns and educational programmes 
which raise children’s and the public’s awareness of the UNCRC, dissemin-
ating the deliberations of the CRC and its Reports widely within the State, 
designating budgets and resources to establish children’s representative 
groups and centres, creating opportunities for children’s participation in 
policymaking and giving due weight to their views and concerns, enacting 
legislation which enables children’s interests to be taken into account (i.e. 
health and education) and integrating child impact assessments into any le-
gislative, policy or budgetary decisions. For example, the setting up of youth 
panels in online child safety policymaking is one illustration of the role of 
the SIP in embedding UNCRC standards and values amongst its Member 
States. Clearly, since many of the online child safety policies, for example, 
impact children, it is only right that they should have a say in the measures 
adopted to enhance their safety. By subjecting States to scrutiny from the 
CRC and, indirectly, to the electorate, it is also felt that greater awareness 
and understanding of UNCRC obligations will in itself provide States with 
the necessary incentive to be seen to be complying with its undertakings. 
The CRC also plays an important role in entering into a dialogue with the 
State during the reporting process by highlighting areas of good practice as 
well as recommending areas where specific attention is required.
It is encouraging to find that States have generally been responsive to the 
recommendations made by the CRC. Some illustrations can be provided by 
way of conclusion to the discussion on the work of the CRC. For example, 
following the dialogue during the consideration of the periodic reports, the 
United Kingdom informed the CRC that it would be withdrawing its reser-
vations to Articles 22 and 37(c) of the Convention and indicated that it also 
planned to ratify the Optional Protocol before the end of 2008 (CRC, 2008a). 
The Optional Protocol was in effect ratified on 20 February 2009. The CRC 
has previously indicated in its Concluding Observations based on the reports 
submitted by the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland that the principle 
of the best interests of the child was not being adequately reflected in all 
legislative and policy matters affecting children, especially in the area of 
juvenile justice, immigration and freedom of movement and peaceful as-
sembly (CRC, 2008b). The then government responded by making available 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

200 Online Child Safety
on its website its views regarding the steps to be taken in response to the 
Committee’s conclusions. During this meeting, broader issues regarding the 
government’s commitment were also addressed together with the problem 
of media’s negative portrayal of children. The CRC also took the oppor-
tunity to make clear that “welfare” and “best interest” were not synonymous 
(CRC, 2008b: paragraph 23). In its 49th Report the CRC reiterated the need 
for the United Kingdom to ratify the CPC Convention, and increase efforts 
towards integrating the best interests of the child principle in “all legislative 
and policy matters affecting children, especially in the area of juvenile 
justice, immigration and freedom of movement and peaceful assembly” 
(CRC, 2010: 64). Even though the recommendations have no legal force, 
States continue to implement the measures proposed by the CRC. Australia, 
for example, amended its Criminal Code by inserting new child pornog-
raphy and child abuse offences. The new offences now ensure that individu-
als using the Internet to access, transmit, or produce illegal content with the 
intention of placing it on the Internet will now be prosecuted (CRC, 2005b: 
97). After welcoming the efforts made by the State, the CRC also drew atten-
tion to its concerns about “the exposure of children to violence, racism and 
pornography, especially through the Internet” (CRC, 2005a: paragraph 33). 
Concrete recommendations made by the CRC assist States in guiding their 
implementation strategies. In response to the recommendations made by 
the CRC, ACMA initiated a series of studies and policy reviews aimed at pro-
moting greater awareness of online safety issues and policies (e.g. filtering, 
media literacy and redress mechanisms) (ACMA, 2009b,c,d). Indeed, we see 
not dissimilar strategies being pursued by policymakers in the United States, 
Canada, the United Kingdom and other Member States in the EU in review-
ing national legislation and MSIG strategies. Additionally, following the 
assurances given to the CRC regarding Australia’s accession and ratification 
to the Optional Protocol, the government fulfilled its undertaking on 8 
January 2007 (2005a: paragraph 78–9). We should also note the role of the 
Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography in making visible the issues meriting the attention of policy-
makers. The Special Rapporteur’s mandate is to investigate the exploitation 
of children around the world and to submit reports to the General Assembly 
and the Commission on Human Rights. The Human Rights Council (HRC) 
passed a resolution providing the Special Rapporteur with an additional 
mandate to analyse the cultural and economic factors contributing to 
CSEC, to identify and promote best practices in combating this problem 
(HRC, 2007). In 2004, the then Special Rapporteur drew the attention of 
the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights to the scale 
of the prevalence of child pornography materials on the Internet and the 
lack of legislation dealing with this type of material, which prompted con-
certed international efforts to address the growing problem of CSEC 
(Commission on Human Rights, 2004). The Special Rapporteur also

International Cooperation and Policymaking 201
highlighted the important role of the CRC, when examining the reports 
submitted by governments on the implementation of the Optional Protocol; 
particular reference was made to its role in promoting a common under-
standing of the definition of pornography so that all signatories could ad-
here to common standards and principles (Commission on Human Rights, 
2004: paragraph 119). Whilst there is a lack of consistency in the legal def-
inition of “child pornography” or variance in the age for consenting to 
sexual activity, many of the concerns regarding the contact and content 
risks are gradually being addressed at national and regional platforms (2004: 
paragraphs 122–9). Anyone engaged in the creation, distribution and pos-
session of child abuse material would be prosecuted (European Commission, 
2010e, 2011b). A number of States have in place legislation that criminalises 
online sexual solicitation of minors. ISPs have developed monitoring and 
information sharing practices designed to reduce online access to illegal 
content. We also have specialised law enforcement units that deal with on-
line safety and security. There are, however, areas identified by the Special 
Rapporteur which still require ongoing international consensus and collab-
oration (e.g. age of the “child”, criminalising possession of “pseudo-child 
abuse images” and defining the scope of “child pornography”). Additionally, 
the efforts to disrupt the supply and demand for CSEC continue to be a con-
cern (ECPAT, 2009). In 2006, the Special Rapporteur noted that there was a 
need for governments and policymakers to develop effective preventative 
strategies which targeted the demand for CSEC (Commission on Human 
Rights, 2006). This is a difficult area of governance, and the eradication of 
demand has been described as “a complex and multifaceted phenomenon” 
(ibid., 2006: paragraph 119). We have previously discussed some of the gov-
ernance responses with regard to CSEC but the findings continue to be rele-
vant to online child safety governance even to this day (ibid., 2006: 
paragraph 122). Whilst empowerment can lead to a reduction of CSEC, in 
many cases their eradication continues to be problem since the conditions 
which enable the demand to be met are deeply rooted in social structures of 
poverty, social inequality, armed conflict and even forced economic migra-
tion (ibid., 2006: 121). In 2009, the Special Rapporteur focused on the 
prevalence of child abuse images in the online environment (HRC, 2009a). 
The report reinforces many of the recommendations set out by the previous 
Special Rapporteur and those produced by World Congresses on CSEC. 
Significant differences in the definition of a “child” and “child pornog-
raphy” were seen as hampering law enforcement efforts in prosecuting 
offenders. Some countries regarded the age of consent to sexual activity as 
defining the boundary between child pornography and those which were 
not (ibid., 2009a: paragraph 55). A number of countries did not have legis-
lation that addressed virtual pornography or did not distinguish between 
erotica and child pornography (ibid., 2009a: 56–7). There are obvious limits 
to these fact-finding missions. In a report submitted to the HRC, the Special
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

202 Online Child Safety
Rapporteur informed the Government of India about some serious allega-
tions surrounding child trafficking and police involvement in undermining 
the investigation and prosecution of offenders (HRC, 2009b: 40–9). 
Unfortunately, the Government of India did not provide a response to the 
allegations (ibid.). These reports, it should be said, are invaluable both in 
terms of raising public awareness to the various forms of CSEC and in 
appealing to the collective interests of States in dealing with the problem at 
the domestic and international level.
Optional Protocol on the sale of children, 
child prostitution and child pornography
The Optional Protocol is relevant to establishing standards and principles, 
particularly in relation to curbing the creation, production, distribution 
and consumption of illegal child abuse content. On 25 May 2000, at the 
54th session of the General Assembly of the UN, the Optional Protocol 
was adopted and opened for signature by any State that was a party to the 
Convention or had signed it. The use of children for commercial sexual ac-
tivity and abuse has long attracted condemnation from society (O’Connell 
et al., 2001). It is true that Articles 32 and 33 of the UNCRC reflect the con-
sensus that children should be provided protection from particular forms 
of commercial and sexual exploitative activities. There are some important 
qualifications, two which can be highlighted here. The inclusion of min-
imum age requirements for “economic exploitation and from performing 
any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s edu-
cation, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, 
moral or social development” can exclude a number of children and ac-
tivities. Additionally, ascertaining a State’s full compliance with both the 
wording and the spirit of the obligations assumed under the Convention is 
not a straightforward process as it may involve traversing into areas of social 
and economic policy (Article 32(2)).
Like the UNCRC, accession to the Optional Protocol illustrates yet again 
the growing recognition by many States of their ongoing role and respon-
sibility towards protecting children and promoting their rights. The prac-
tical significance of subscribing to this instrument can be stated briefly. 
Ratification of the Optional Protocol helps States clarify the types of con-
duct that can be made the subject of criminal sanctions and identify applic-
able substantive and procedural standards for governance. For example, the 
Optional Protocol attempts to overcome the uncertainties surrounding the 
types and forms of child sexual exploitation that can legitimately be made 
the subject of a State’s obligations in this area of child protection by identi-
fying areas where public intervention is warranted. Any “act or transaction 
whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons to another 
for remuneration or any other consideration” will be prohibited (Article 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 203
2(a)). “Child prostitution” is defined as the use of a child in sexual activities 
for remuneration or any other form of consideration (Article 2(c)). Arguably, 
“sex tourism” would be covered, particularly where there is a commercial 
aspect to the supply of children to travellers from overseas for sexual ac-
tivity. Signatories under the Optional Protocol undertake to pass criminal 
laws which prohibit acts relating to the representation of a child engaged 
in real or simulated sexual activities or any representation of the sexual 
parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes (Articles 3(1)(c) and 2). States 
which sign the Optional Protocol are also expected to undertake all ne-
cessary steps towards strengthening international cooperation and imple-
menting measures to investigate, prosecute and punish offenders (Article 
10). The engagement of the CRC, as noted previously, in respect of States’ 
implementation of the Optional Protocol is designed to provide assurances 
that proper reporting mechanisms are in place, that compliance is given pri-
ority by States and that any emerging issues and difficulties are addressed 
in a timely manner. In its report on the 48th session, the CRC noted that 
it had received 43 initial reports under the Optional Protocol (CRC, 2009: 
paragraphs 14–22). In considering the initial report from the United States 
with regard to the Optional Protocol, the CRC acknowledged the contribu-
tion made by the Innocence Lost Initiative in combating child prostitution 
in the country (CRC, 2009: 47). Other measures regarded by the CRC as 
good practice included the enactment of the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Act 2000 (which enhanced the investigation and prosecution of individuals 
engaged in child sexual exploitation) and its re-authorisations in 2003 and 
2005, the PROTECT Act of 2003, which expanded its extraterritorial crim-
inal jurisdiction to prosecute State party’s citizens committing sex crimes 
against children abroad and the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety 
Act, passed in 2006, which increased penalties for child sex offenders and 
eliminated the statutes of limitations for criminal offences against children. 
These measures adopted by the United States, more generally, can also be 
regarded as examples of timely and proportionate governance responses to-
wards the practice of CSEC. Interestingly, the CRC also recommended in its 
report that the United States needed to better target its resources towards 
child trafficking and collection of data (King, 2008). The CRC was particu-
larly “concerned that a focus on sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography is still lacking” (ibid: 50). This is an aspect that was also noted 
by the Special Rapporteur following a fact-finding mission to the United 
States in 2010 (HRC, 2011). Various stakeholders represented to the Special 
Rapporteur that “commercial sexual exploitation is a highly profitable in-
dustry, coupled with a low risk of conviction for abusers, and there is a pool 
of vulnerable children at risk of being used in such practices” (ibid., 2011: 
paragraph 12). Finally, another example of the standard setting outcomes in 
CRC engagement with States can be seen in its consideration of the report 
submitted by Korea. The CRC reported that the strategies for combating CST 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

204 Online Child Safety
were hampered by the lack of a coherent plan and adequate funding (CRC, 
2009). The State was encouraged to work closely in partnership with the 
tourism industry, NGOs and civil society organisations (ibid., 2009: 63). It 
was also observed by the CRC that there were inadequate steps taken by the 
State in raising the awareness of the general public and engaging with chil-
dren in relation to their awareness and understanding of the risks posed by 
the Internet and other mobile communication technologies (ibid.).
To conclude, it suffices to acknowledge the extent of the obligations States 
voluntarily assume by subscribing to international obligations like those in 
the Optional Protocol and UNCRC and their willingness to engage with the 
CRC in adapting their legal and social infrastructures accordingly.
Other UN Agencies and organisations
By way of completeness, two other contributions from the UN should also 
be mentioned. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 
(UNESCO) is an agency which promotes collaboration among nations 
through education, culture, sciences and communication. It does not 
undertake projects which are overseen by the CRC but it has an indirect 
impact through educational programmes aimed at enhancing children’s 
media and ICT literacy skills. This subject will be covered in more de-
tail in a later chapter. UNESCO now collaborates with the International 
Telecommunications Union and the UNDP. On 21 December 2001, the UN 
General Assembly adopted the resolution (A/RES/56/183) which endorsed 
the organisation of the WSIS. UNESCO has hosted an Expert Meeting on 
Sexual Abuse of Children, Child Pornography and Paedophilia on the Internet in 
1999 and shortly thereafter, on 20 September 2005, an awareness-raising 
round table on “Safety of children on the Internet” was organised jointly 
by the Russian Federation’s National Committee for UNESCO’s Information 
for All Program and Microsoft Corporation Russia and CIS branch. These 
meeting opportunities have two particular benefits. First, the events pro-
vide an important mechanism for raising public awareness of this area of 
child protection policymaking. Second, these communication platforms en-
able stakeholders from civil society and the private sector to exchange ideas 
and develop collaborative partnerships and strategies with each other.
Second, the UNICEF, ECPAT, the NGO Group for the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child together with the Government of Brazil recently 
launched the WC III in Rio de Janeiro on 25–28 November 2010. The aim 
of this conference was to provide delegates with an opportunity to review 
the progress made since the previous Congress in dealing with all forms of 
sexual exploitation and the emerging governance challenges facing stake-
holders. More generally, the World Congress provides a platform where the 
private and public sector, together with representatives from governments 
and law enforcement, review their strategies for promoting international 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 205
collaboration aimed at protecting children from sexual exploitation and 
abuse. Each World Congress has made some notable contributions towards 
the debates on online child safety governance. For example, the 1996 First 
World Congress against CSEC, which was held in Stockholm, brought to the 
attention of governments the scale and organised nature of CSEC (Newell, 
2008). This Congress has been regarded as “seminal in breaking the taboo 
of CSEC and the silence permeating CSEC” (Muntarbhorn, 2001). At the 
Stockholm Congress, the delegates issued a declaration and an agenda for 
action, signalling both their commitment to the principles enshrined in 
the UNCRC and their resolve in strengthening international commitment 
in creating appropriate regulatory mechanisms to “put an end to the com-
mercial sexual exploitation of children worldwide” (CSEC World Congress, 
1996: paragraph 13). Following the meeting in Stockholm, the CRC par-
ticipated in the open-ended working group looking at various aspects of 
the draft Optional Protocols (CRC, 1996). At least 34 governments had pro-
duced national strategies for dealing with CSEC with a further 26 in the 
process of developing national action plans (NGO Group, 2001). The Second 
World Congress in 2001 was held in Yokohama. At this Congress, delegates 
from more than 134 countries were presented with national strategies for 
combating child sexual abuse from 100 governments. The report from the 
General Rapporteur – Professor Vitit Muntarbhorn – noted the growth in 
the CSEC industry, in particular the national and transnational traffick-
ing of children for sexual purposes (Muntarbhorn, 2001). The Stockholm 
and Yokohama Congresses affirmed the role and value of the UNCRC. 
Additionally, the Yokohama Congress reiterated many of the commitments 
and action plans highlighted in Stockholm. Finally, the WC III in Brazil 
identified five themes, which also highlights the multi-dimensional aspects 
of child sexual abuse: new dimensions of sexual exploitation; legal and en-
forcement; inter-sectoral policies; the private sector and corporate social re-
sponsibility and international cooperation. Following the extensive review 
of national and international responses to CSEC in the World Congress, the 
participants were unanimous in their call for governments to adopt and 
enforce national laws protecting children from commercial sexual exploit-
ation (ECPAT, 2009). Some of the principal recommendations include the 
development of a model law and guidance for national governments, the 
need for States to make greater use of the General Comments by the CRC on 
all forms of child sexual exploitation and related abuse, the value derived 
from involving children in the governance process, the need to encourage 
countries to ratify the various international instruments in this field and 
efforts to be made in reducing the number of reservations made on ratifica-
tion and developing mechanisms for securing compliance. In essence, the 
central message appears to be that States need to be responsive to the risks 
facing children in society, particularly from technology-mediated sexual ex-
ploitation and abuse. The involvement of the FCACP at the WC III Congress 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

is significant particularly as the “commercial exploitation of children” in-
dustry is heavily reliant on financial institutions, credit card payment and 
merchant third-party payment companies for sustaining its economic and 
commercial viability (Hecht, 2008: 98).
Finally, to conclude this section regarding the efforts made by the UN 
in this area, a brief mention should be made of the UN Secretary-General’s 
2006 Study on Violence against Children. The study undertakes a systematic 
approach in examining the scale of violence suffered by children in society, 
with particular input from children. The decision to undertake the study 
can be traced back to work commenced by the CRC during 2000 and 2001 
(CRC, 2000, 2001a,b). During the general discussion days, which focused 
on the violence suffered by children in society generally, the Committee 
recommended that the Secretary-General be requested by the UN General 
Assembly to conduct an in-depth global study on violence against children. 
The Committee emphasised that the study
should lead to the development of strategies aimed at effectively prevent-
ing and combating all forms of violence against children, outlining steps 
to be taken at the international level and by States to provide effective 
prevention, protection, intervention, treatment, recovery and reintegra-
tion. (UN Secretary General, 2001)
Some of the findings in the study resonate with the issues covered in this 
book. First, that the Internet and communication technologies increased 
children’s exposure to risk of sexual exploitation and abuse from peers and 
adults (UN Secretary General, 2006: paragraph 80). Second, that new tech-
nologies make “sex tourism” both accessible and affordable to an unpre-
cedented audience in a scale and level never experienced (UN Secretary 
General, 2006: paragraph 77). Third, that the mass media contributes to 
children’s exposure to risks of sexual exploitation since they “sometimes 
portray as normal or glorify violence, including violence against children, 
in print and visual media including television programmes, films and video 
games” (UN Secretary General, 2006: paragraph 80). The Secretary-General 
recommended that countries continue in their efforts to combat the use of 
the Internet and communication technologies in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of children and peer victimisation, engage parents, carers and 
children in media literacy and awareness-raising initiatives, encourage in-
dustry to promote design and standard setting efforts for child protection 
and increase the deterrence and punitive role of criminal laws (ibid., 2006: 
paragraph 114).
The above account of the role of the UN demonstrates the enormity of 
the online child safety governance challenge and the critical need for a 
MSIG strategy in responding to the many risks and threats encountered by 
children. It is not unreasonable to conclude that the UN regards its role as 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 207
elevating the need for policy responses in promoting child welfare and de-
velopment. Its institutional processes and agencies continue to encourage 
and support governments in their efforts to strengthen and promote chil-
dren’s rights. Within the context of online child safety policymaking, the 
EU and the Council of Europe have been instrumental in efforts to main-
stream children’s rights and child protection matters. A summary of these 
efforts will now be provided.
The European Union
The Treaty of Lisbon requires the EU to promote policies and measures 
which protect the rights of the child. It will be recalled that children’s rights 
are already part of the EU discourse on human rights (e.g. Article 24 of the 
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU). It remains to be seen how the 
obligation to respect children’s rights under the Charter will extend to chil-
dren’s interaction with the Internet in the light of the fact that the 27 EU 
countries are also signatories to the UNCRC. There is no disguising the fact 
that in the post-Lisbon constitutional landscape, child welfare and devel-
opment will continue to be at the forefront of the “Europe 2020” strategy 
(European Commission, 2010b). The European Commission (Commission) 
has provided leadership in the area of online child safety governance in 
terms of both formulating policies and ensuring their widespread accept-
ance and implementation by Member States. In this regard, particular pri-
ority continues to be given to the use of legal instruments to enforce child 
safety norms, requiring all Member States to create appropriate regulatory 
and incentive frameworks which promote a culture of safe and responsible 
use of Web 2.0 technologies and impressing on all stakeholders to ensure 
that their measures and policies continue to be relevant.
The EU governance landscape comprises a patchwork of policy commu-
nications, Directives, Conventions, national legislation, industry practices 
and awareness-raising initiatives (European Parliament, 2009). What fol-
lows is a brief account of the standard setting policies and measures. We 
can begin by noting that the trend towards establishing a coherent govern-
ance framework, for example, can be located in the emphasis placed by the 
Commission in engaging all stakeholders, at varying levels of involvement, 
with the task of promoting and embedding safe and responsible Internet 
use and principles. The SIP was developed to address the unique challenges 
posed by the Internet and communication technologies for Member States’ 
ability to enforce laws regulating illegal and harmful content (European 
Commission, 1996b,c). A number of measures relevant to enhancing the 
safety of children have been implemented across Member States – block-
ing and filtering solutions, interception strategies and establishment of hot-
lines. Many of these measures also mirror those adopted by policymakers 
in other jurisdictions (ITU, 2009b, 2010b). The Green Paper issued by the 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

208 Online Child Safety
Commission also mapped some nascent ideas regarding the involvement of 
the private sector in the SIP (European Commission, 1996c). The standard 
setting agenda, at least with regard to enhancing children’s safety, can also 
be seen in the development of programmes which broadened the strategies 
and measures used to enhance safety with the support of the ICT, broad-
casting and telecommunications industry. The priority for the EU even to 
this day appears to be to encourage greater cooperation amongst all stake-
holders, promote sharing of best practices and create incentives for self-
regulation. The Commission’s initiatives in respect of child safety over the 
past decade could be viewed as an attempt to achieve two goals – first, to 
encourage innovation in the audiovisual and information services sector; 
and, second, to reassure parents and children that media and services can be 
accessed and utilised without fear of exposure to illegal or harmful content. 
From the accounts provided above, the SIP can be regarded as providing 
an institutional setting for the MSIG framework at the EU level whereby 
the obligations and responsibilities are allocated to various stakeholders, 
with the Commission and Member States assuming the role as “risk manag-
ers” (Eurobarometer, 2006, 2007, 2008). The industry rather than the State 
is as a consequence regarded as having an important role in developing 
technological and content monitoring solutions relating to blocking and 
filtering child pornography and hate content (King, 2009). The overarching 
SIP framework enables policymakers to keep pace with emerging threats 
posed to children. It was felt that since the first Action Plan, the strategies 
for promoting Internet safety had to continuously respond to the govern-
ance issues raised by the growing convergence between social media and 
communication platforms. Between 1999 and 2004, the rapid growth in 
the digital economy and spread of communication technologies led to a 
reassessment of the strategies needed to achieve the objectives of the Safer 
Internet Plus Programme (European Commission, 2009a). In its proposal, 
the Commission noted that the emergence of broadband and growing 
processing power and storage capacity of computers and the ready avail-
ability of mobile computing would contribute to increased demand and 
supply of illegal content (European Commission, 2004). The Safer Internet 
Plus Programme was extended to include mobile and broadband content 
accessed through different online technologies, like chat rooms, instant 
messages, P2P technologies and online games (European Commission, 
2006b, 2008). The objectives of the Safer Internet Plus Programme have 
not altered in any fundamental respect; the focus remains on combating 
illegal and inappropriate/harmful content, promoting a safer environment 
and raising public awareness (European Commission, 2010e; EU SIP, 2009). 
The European Parliament’s contribution to the online child safety govern-
ance initiative should also be acknowledged (European Parliament, 2004). 
During the deliberations the European Parliament urged those implement-
ing the Safer Internet Plus Programme to direct their regulatory measures 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 209
towards developing design and information literacy solutions (European 
Parliament, 2009). The inclusion of software and product manufacturers in 
child safety governance has always been regarded as a necessary governance 
strategy; the industry was encouraged to provide users with all relevant in-
formation (i.e. rating systems and quality labels) so that children, parents 
and educators could make informed decisions on how best to manage online 
risks (Eurobarometer, 2007). Additionally, greater emphasis has been placed 
in engaging sector-specific industries as part of the online safety standard 
setting agenda (European Parliament and Council, 2006).
The emerging governance strategy is both reflexive and fluid and is very 
much evident in the general thrust of the recommendations and Directives 
passed in the EU and the activities pursued under the two SIPs. The impetus 
driving the child-centred policies, particularly the Safer Internet 2009–13 
programme and the Proposed Directive, reflects an evolving understand-
ing of the benefits of co-regulation, which involves the participation of all 
stakeholders approaching common goals in safeguarding children, under-
pinned by established standards and principles (European Commission, 
2011e). This understanding can also be found in the 2006 Communication, 
which stressed that EU’s strategies for children corresponded with the EU’s 
and its Member States’ commitments concluded at regional and inter-
national levels, including the ECHR, the UNCRC and its Optional Protocols 
and the UN Millennium Development Declaration (European Commission, 
2006a). The Commission has now published its Action Plan that reiterates 
its continued commitment towards promoting and strengthening children’s 
rights (European Commission, 2011b; cf. Eurochild, 2011). This is again an-
other example of regional governance strategies mirroring the standards 
and principles set out in instruments like the UNCRC. Article 3(5) of the 
Lisbon Treaty, for example, whilst emphasising the values of respect and 
dignity makes clear that the protection of human rights, in particular the 
rights of the child, is to be promoted by the EU. The revised Treaty on the 
Functioning of the European now vests in the European Parliament and the 
European Council powers to adopt measures combating child sexual abuse 
and exploitation (European Commission, 2011b: 10–11).
The specific references in the Commission’s Agenda for the Rights of the 
Child to protecting children from all forms of violence reflect the standard 
setting value of provisions in the UNCRC, in particular Article 19, which 
requires signatories to the Convention to promote the right of the child to 
be free from the risk of violence in a variety of settings – homes, schools 
and public places. The importance attached to harmonisation and the 
need to maintain existing regulatory frameworks under review reflect 
the growing convergence in the standard setting agenda in national, re-
gional and supranational initiatives. An example of this can be seen in the 
Proposed Directive, which was issued by the European Commission in 2010 
(European Commission, 2010e). The policymaking efforts appear to have 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

210 Online Child Safety
been influenced by some of the issues identified in previous chapters, in 
particular concerns raised with regard to the reluctance of victims to report 
sexual abuse, the frustration expressed by law enforcement in investigating, 
prosecuting and punishing those engaged in child sexual exploitation and 
abuse, the barriers posed by jurisdictional principles like double criminality 
and double jeopardy, the inconsistencies in legal definitions of some of the 
more serious sexual offences and the prevalence of sex tourism. Accordingly, 
the implementation of the provisions in the Proposed Directive should 
address regulatory shortcomings in five main areas, which will only be 
summarised here. First, all serious forms of child sexual abuse and exploit-
ation not covered by EU legislation would now be criminalised. These are 
“child sexual abuse”, “sexual exploitation”, “child pornography”, and “so-
licitation of children for sexual purposes”. A “child” is said to be any one 
below the age of 18 but Member States can reduce the age when children 
can be deemed to consent to sexual activity. “Child pornography” will now 
cover not only children below the age of 18 years but also any material that 
visually depicts “any person appearing to be a child, or realistic images of a 
non-existent child, engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct”. 
It is not without significance that the definition of child pornography also 
extends to any depiction for primarily sexual purposes of the sexual organs 
of a child, or of any person appearing to be a child or of realistic images of a 
non-existent child, which would also be deemed to be “child pornography”. 
Article 4 will now regulate non-visual depiction of children. Member States 
are also required to criminalise the production, distribution, dissemination 
or transmission of child pornography. The act of offering, supplying or mak-
ing available child pornography is to be treated as an offence. Those who 
knowingly obtain access to child pornography by any information system 
would also be prosecuted for child pornography offences. “Child prostitu-
tion” is also identified as a serious form of sexual exploitation under Article 
3. The term is understood as meaning the use of a child for sexual activity 
where money or other form of consideration is given or promised in exchange 
for the child’s sexual services. An offence will be committed where a person 
recruits or coerces a child into prostitution or engages in sexual activities 
with a child, where recourse is made to child prostitution. It is no defence to 
a charge for committing an offence of child prostitution for the accused to 
show that the consideration or promise was made to a third party rather than 
to the child. Those profiting from or exploiting a child for prostitution would 
also be committing an offence. Article 3 also regards recruiting or coercing 
a child to engage in pornographic performances as a form of sexual exploit-
ation. A “pornographic performance” means an exhibition in front of a live 
audience, which can be either online or offline. The act of recruiting or co-
ercing a child to engage in real or simulated sexually explicit conduct or live 
exhibitions of the sexual organs of a child for primarily sexual purposes are 
to be treated as crimes. The Article also regards those knowingly attending 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 211
pornographic performances involving the participation of children as com-
mitting a criminal offence. These provisions are likely to be relevant in deal-
ing with the increased use of live web streaming by the commercial and 
sexual exploitation of children industry. There are two limbs to Article 6. 
First, acts which are deemed to be abetting, aiding or inciting the offences 
under Articles 2–5 will be criminalised. Attempts to commit the offences 
in Articles 2–4 are also criminal offences. Article 6(3) now expressly deals 
with those engaged in the practice of facilitating the travel of nationals from 
Member States to engage in activities covered by Articles 2–5; the activities 
to be criminalised include
(a) the dissemination of materials advertising the opportunity to commit 
any of the offences referred to in Articles 2 to 5;
(b) the organisation of travel arrangements with the purpose of commit-
ting any of the offences referred to in Articles 2 to 5.
Second, transborder investigation and collection of evidence for prosecution 
will be simplified, particularly where the commission of the offence takes 
place in multiple jurisdictions. Under Article 12(1) decisions to commence 
an investigation into an alleged child sexual offence need not now be based 
on a report or an accusation made by the victim. The interests of the victim 
are further highlighted in Articles 14 and 15. NGOs have long urged govern-
ments and law enforcement to consider the interests of child victims of hor-
rific sexual exploitation, and, more importantly, the necessity of requiring 
an investigation or prosecution to be dependent on a complaint being made 
by the victim (Quayle et al., 2008: 90–1). Even if the victim has withdrawn 
her statements, it is conceivable that permitting investigation or prosecu-
tion would serve the public interest if sufficient evidence were available to 
convict the accused. At the last resort, use could be made of video testimony 
from the child, subject to the usual safeguards on hearsay and rules on ad-
missibility. Article 12(3) also requires Member States to clarify the scope of 
the confidentiality rules imposed by the law on professions who have con-
tact with children that may prevent them from reporting suspected child 
protection offences to the appropriate authority. One question that needs to 
be considered is whether there is any real or significant difference between 
Article 12(3) and (4) – since they both appear to appeal to an individual’s 
civic and moral obligation to report suspected child offences. It should be 
noted that some legislatures outside the EU have already implemented man-
datory reporting of child pornography obligations. For example, the House 
Bill 2463 in Oregon, US, now requires processors of photographic images 
and computer technicians to report child pornography. In 2009, Ontario 
enacted a new Child Pornography Reporting Act, which makes it a crim-
inal offence not to report suspected child pornography. Third, EU nation-
als who travel abroad to commit sexual offences against children will now

be subject to national extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction. In the previous 
chapter we examined some of the rules on extraterritorial criminal jurisdic-
tion in Australia, Canada and the United States. Article 13 aims to resolve a 
number of procedural and jurisdictional obstacles addressed in Chapter 4. 
There is a clear recognition amongst EU policymakers that Member States 
can and should avail themselves of extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction in 
cases where there are multi-jurisdictional elements. Article 13(2) attempts 
to remove the possible issue of “where” the crime is deemed to have been 
committed when the Internet or other communication devices are used in 
CSEC. Where a national from a Member State commits a child sexual abuse 
in another country, the application of its extraterritorial criminal jurisdic-
tion should not be made conditional on the acts being a criminal offence 
at the place where they were deemed to have taken place (Article 13(3)). 
The removal of the double criminality rule is also consistent with Article 
4 of the Optional Protocol. In relation to crimes, where organised gangs 
are involved, Member States are encouraged to cooperate with the aim of 
prosecuting the accused in one Member State if possible. Where there is 
uncertainty or disagreement about the best course to take, Member States 
are advised to refer to the “Eurojust Guidelines” or any instrument or mech-
anism within the EU in order to facilitate cooperation between their judicial 
authorities and promote better coordination of actions. The Article sets out 
some factors which should inform the decision-making process: the nation-
ality of the accused, the place where the crimes or offences were committed, 
the origin of the victims and the place where the accused was discovered 
or arrested. Fourth, victims’ interests will now be accommodated to ensure 
that they do not suffer additional stress and trauma in having to give evi-
dence in criminal proceedings. Article 15 requires Member States to put in 
place processes which centre on the victim’s best interests. For example, 
following a report or complaint, experts will now be under an obligation 
to conduct the interviews expeditiously. As far as possible, the interview 
should be conducted in premises designed or adapted for this purpose. An 
adult or legal representative, preferably chosen by the child, should accom-
pany the child victim. The “Eurojust Guidelines” recommends that in mat-
ters relating to child protection, reference should be made to the principles 
in the UNCRC and CPC Convention (e.g. General Comment 12 CRC/C/
GC/12; General Comment 13 CRC/C/GC/13). Of particular relevance to pol-
icymakers in Member States in this context is the recommendation made 
by the HRC that child-sensitive community-based and legal mechanisms be 
adopted (HRC, 2011: 5). Fifth, Article 16 addresses the problem of recidivism 
by restricting offenders from accessing the Internet. Individuals convicted 
of serious child sexual offences identified in the Proposed Directive will 
now be subject to an assessment of the risks to re-offending or dangers they 
may pose to society. In a press release, leading NGOs issue indicated their 
approval of the Proposed Directive:
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 213
The Commission’s proposal brings the existing legislation closer in line 
with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the 
Council of Europe’s Convention on the Protection of children against 
sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. (NSPCC, 2009)
One provision that remains to be addressed is Article 21, which deals with 
content regulation mechanisms. This Article as presently drafted is hardly 
a model of clarity. The Explanatory Note states, however, that where 
Member States are unable to remove the webpages they need only take the 
necessary measures, which can include non-legislative steps. Countries like 
Belgium, Finland, Ireland and the United Kingdom, for example, adopt a 
voluntary filtering scheme. With regard to the United Kingdom, reports 
from the public regarding websites hosting child abuse content are passed 
to the IWF. If the IWF views the content as illegal, it makes a request to the 
ISP to have the page blocked to users in the United Kingdom. There are ju-
dicial safeguards built into the orders granted to block websites suspected 
of hosting or disseminating child pornography. Attempts in the United 
States to impose a mandatory filtering or blocking obligation have been 
challenged on constitutional grounds. In Australia, there is a co-regulatory 
model governing filtering and blocking. Schedule 5 of the Broadcasting 
Services Act 1992 and the Internet Industry Codes of Practice define the 
measures ISPs are expected to implement to protect the general public 
from illegal content. There is an “opt-in” filtering framework. ACMA can 
require a content service provider or ISP to remove or block access to pro-
hibited content. It is worth recalling that the previous Council Framework 
Decision regarded Member States as having direct responsibility for imple-
menting substantive and procedural rules regarding access to illegal con-
tent (Council of the European Union, 2004b). No reference was made to 
the obligations of Member States for direct intervention in blocking il-
legal content like child pornography. The Working Party on Substantive 
Criminal Law has previously called for a proportionate response on this 
issue (Council of the European Union, 2001: 3). At the first Working Group 
meeting, a number of Member States expressed reservations regarding their 
obligation to impose blocking measures. As a result of the meeting, the 
European Parliament proposed an amendment to the Council text which 
attempts to diffuse some of the political and ideological controversy (EDRI, 
2011). Reference should also be made to the observation made by Advocate 
General Cruz Villaló n in Scarlet Extended v Socié té  belge des auteurs composi-
teurs et é diteurs (Sabam) (2011) that the deployment of mandatory filtering 
measures could arguably encroach into users’ expectation of privacy to 
their communications and protection of personal data which are protected 
under the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This aside, the SIP aims to in-
crease communities’ and stakeholders’ understanding and awareness of 
responsibilities for enhancing children’s online safety. Two examples can

be provided. First, the Safer Internet Forum, for example, is an annual con-
ference organised under the SIP. Some of the topics covered in the annual 
conference over the years included promoting online safety in schools, 
addressing the impact of convergence and online sexual abuse, sharing 
industry practices relating to the use of labelling and age-verification tools 
and developing safety strategies on social network sites. Second, the EU 
has continued to support the Safer Internet Day campaign since its incep-
tion in 2004. This campaign is seen as an awareness raising opportunity 
for children, parents, educators and society generally (INSAFE, 2009, EU 
SIP, 2009). Many of the aims to be achieved by promoting these initiatives 
complement other measures developed by the EU (e.g. promoting safer use 
of online technologies, increasing public awareness of risks and precau-
tions and reducing the amount of illegal content being distributed online). 
The recent SIP efforts include targeting potentially harmful conduct like 
peer victimisation and “grooming”. Finally, policymakers also recognise 
that children and their parents should be integrated into the MSIG frame-
work. Media literacy and education campaigns are increasingly directed at 
assisting these groups of individuals (see later discussion on media literacy 
in Chapter 7).
Council of Europe
The Council of Europe has 47 member countries and is based in Strasbourg. 
Its primary mission is to develop and promote the rule of law throughout 
Europe. It has passed a number of standard setting instruments which have 
direct relevance for child protection. The ECHR, which led to the estab-
lishment of the European Court of Human Rights, allows individuals to 
apply to this Court where their fundamental rights have been violated. The 
European Social Charter (ESC) is another instrument aimed at securing an 
individual’s social and economic rights. There is a monitoring body, known 
as the European Committee on Social Rights, which ensures that States 
comply with the ESC. The Committee of Ministers and the Parliamentary 
Assembly are vested with statutory powers and have over the years adopted 
a number of recommendations and resolutions regarding children’s rights. 
These instruments do not have binding force but they are persuasive and 
are relied upon when developing policies in the States. Finally, accession to 
the Conventions is not limited to Member States. Requests for accession to 
the Council of Europe Conventions are also received by States outside the 
European Community. In the remainder of the section a brief account will 
be provided of two main Conventions, with particular emphasis on their 
standard setting significance for enhancing the safety of children in the 
online environment.
Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against 
Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse CETS No. 201
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 215
The Treaty opened for signature on 25 October 2007. It is open to all 
Member States, non-Member States, by the EU, and for accession by other 
non-Member States. The CPC Convention came into force on 1 July 2010. 
Thirty-two countries have signed the CPC Convention and 7 have ratified 
it. The European Commission has described the CPC Convention as consti-
tuting the “highest international standard for protecting children against 
sexual abuse and exploitation to date”, with the Optional Protocol as the 
main international standard on a global scale (European Commission, 
2010e). Subscribers to the CPC Convention are expected to adhere to three 
of its main objectives. First, to prevent and combat sexual exploitation 
and sexual abuse of children. Second, to protect the rights of child victims 
of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. Third, to promote national and 
international cooperation against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of 
children. These commitments again indicate the widespread acceptance 
by many signatories of the need to prioritise child protection and develop 
(and review) strategies for enhancing their safety. The CPC Convention 
covers various forms of child sexual abuse and this instrument is the 
culmination of its three-year programme Building a Europe for and with 
Children. The Council’s Children’s Strategy for 2009–11 is consistent with 
the fundamental values and principles of the CPC Convention, with one 
of its goals being to eradicate all forms of violence against children.2 There 
are a number of features in the CPC Convention that mirror the issues pre-
viously discussed in the Proposed Directive, the UNCRC and the Optional 
Protocols. Chapter II, for example, deals with measures that aim to prevent 
all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children. States are 
regarded as having a critical role in implementing the necessary legisla-
tive or other measures. These can include raising the safety and media 
literacy levels of the public, parents, educators, carers and children. The 
obligation to safeguard children also extends to the responsibility of the 
State for dealing with recidivism by repeat and potential offenders. The 
CPC Convention advocates a MSIG approach. Chapter III emphasises the 
value of involving professionals from across the public and private sector 
to promote information sharing and exchange at national and regional 
level (i.e. education sector, health sector, social services law enforcement 
and judicial authorities). According to the Explanatory Note issued by 
the Council, it is hoped that the offences set out in Articles 18–23 will 
promote greater harmonisation of laws amongst signatories and prevent 
criminals from engaging in sexual activity with children in jurisdictions, 
which may have lenient sentences or rules. Additionally, increased har-
monisation is expected to reduce problems that may be posed by the prin-
ciple of dual criminality and promote mutual assistance efforts between 
Member States. Article 20 deals with the offence of child pornography. The 
Explanatory Note shows that the drafters of the CPC Convention recog-
nise the increasing ways technology can be used to exploit and victimise 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

216 Online Child Safety
children. For example, the phrase “sexually explicit conduct” extends to 
real or simulated acts in relation to all forms of sexual activity. States can 
also reserve the right not to criminalise the conduct identified in para-
graph 1.a and e to the production and possession of pornographic ma-
terial, which consists exclusively of simulated representations or realistic 
images of a non-existent child. Interestingly, the exemption also extends 
to user-generated content created by children and possessed by them, but 
only where it is made with their consent and used solely for their own pri-
vate use. The latter exception is a reference to the growing practice of sex-
ting amongst children and young adolescents. The reservation in the case 
of the former is more controversial on the grounds that this exception may 
be falling below the standards previously set out in the Proposed Directive, 
which was overwhelmingly endorsed by leading NGOs. Article 25 and 
Chapter VI contains many of the approaches to jurisdiction, investigation, 
treatment of victims and prosecution advocated in the Proposed Directive. 
Chapter IX deals with provisions aiming to promote and enhance inter-
national cooperation. In cases where Member States do not have mutual 
assistance treaty arrangements or are in the process of negotiating agree-
ments, Article 38, paragraph 3, allows for requests for assistance and extra-
dition to be dealt with promptly. It should be noted that the Council of 
Europe has also made available regulatory instruments that serve the pur-
pose of expediting the investigatory and information sharing objectives of 
law enforcement. The European Convention on Extradition (ETS 24), the 
European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (ETS 30) 
and the two Additional Protocols to Extradition and Mutual Assistance 
serve as a reminder that timely intervention is critical to safeguarding po-
tential victims and prosecuting offenders.
Convention on Cybercrime CETS No. 185
The Convention on Cybercrime came into force in 2004 and is regarded 
as an important instrument for promoting international cooperation, par-
ticularly in relation to combating sexual exploitation and abuse of chil-
dren. The Cybercrime Convention can be seen as another governance 
response to the difficulties faced by national legal systems in policing the 
Internet and prosecuting criminal activity mediated through technology 
(Putnam/Elliott (2001)). A number of countries that signed the Cybercrime 
Convention have also drafted national legislation reflecting their commit-
ments assumed under this instrument. In a working paper prepared for the 
UN Secretariat it was noted that the Cybercrime Convention provides a “set 
of principles for developing a legal framework for international cooperation 
in cybercrime investigations” (UN Secretariat, 2010). As noted previously, 
the Cybercrime Convention has provisions dealing with the offence of 
child pornography and sets out the procedural aspects of investigating and 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 217
prosecuting individuals and organisations for child pornography (Gercke, 
2006). Article 9 criminalises the exploitative activities discussed previously 
(e.g. producing, offering, distributing and possession). To ensure that the 
Cybercrime Convention obtains support from as broad a range of States 
with their own political and cultural needs, Article 9 permits each Party 
a right not to apply, in whole or in part, paragraphs 1, sub-paragraphs d. 
and e, and 2, sub-paragraphs b. and c. Like Article 9, Chapters II and III 
aim to facilitate greater harmonisation and cooperation between Parties. 
For example, Chapter II aims to promote standard setting processes in-
volving the collection, preservation and presentation of digital evidence. 
Chapter III provides a framework for cooperation in the form of mutual 
assistance and extradition requests. To ensure consistency in the approach 
adopted in other Council of Europe treaties, Chapter IV of the Cybercrime 
Convention contains clauses which mirror many of the standard provisions 
found in those agreements. It will be observed that the Convention does 
not deal with other content-related offences like xenophobic or racist ma-
terial (Gercke, 2009). The Council of Europe subsequently drafted the First 
Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime. In the Explanatory 
Report to this Protocol, it was pointed out that some countries would not 
have subscribed to the Convention, in view of the free speech implications 
resulting from the criminalisation of racist propaganda content.3 There is 
no doubt that the Convention continues to play an important role in pro-
moting a global strategic response towards eradicating the commercial and 
sexual exploitation of children. The provisions provide a framework which 
defines core principles which can inform national policymaking and legis-
lative activity (Gercke, 2008; Callanan et al., 2008).
A key governance question remains: can we do better? Despite the various 
global initiatives in promoting international cooperation and harmon-
isation, the scale of criminality does not appear to be receding (ECPAT, 
2005). It may be thought if more countries subscribed to the Cybercrime 
Convention and other treaties seeking to protect children from sexual 
harm and abuse, that the scale and volume of the threats could be bet-
ter managed. As discussed previously, many countries have yet to ratify 
the Cybercrime Convention. Others do not have the resources to imple-
ment and monitor the effectiveness of their laws (UN Secretariat, 2010: 
paragraph 33). Whether the challenges facing the continued role and ef-
fectiveness of the Cybercrime Convention could be overcome through 
the enactment of a Global Cybercrime Treaty is an issue that was noted 
in the previous chapter (UN Secretariat, 2010: ibid.). More importantly, 
the standard setting instruments that currently exist already introduce 
significant improvements into the way commercial and sexual offences 
are now being investigated and prosecuted. The Conventions and instru-
ments identified in this and preceding chapters show the widespread rec-
ognition by States of the importance of enacting legislation, which sets 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

218 Online Child Safety
out the conduct to be prohibited and the obligations of all stakeholders 
to minimise children's exposure to the risks of of technology-enabled 
crimes.
Conclusion
The developments highlighted in this chapter illustrate the distinctive 
nature of online child safety governance, with its decentralised contexts 
and processes involving a number of online service providers, the ICT 
industry and the telecommunications sector coordinating their activities 
and collaborating with each other. It is not uncommon to find policymak-
ers in various countries, regional and international forums developing pol-
icies and strategies aimed at coordinating governance efforts on a range of 
issues and policies (e.g. Internet and mobile phone use, network and access 
filtering and use of hotlines) (ACMA, 2009a,b). Online safety and security 
is also becoming an area of national policy. Reference has already been 
made to reports commissioned by governments in the United Kingdom, 
Australia and the United States on online child safety. Safety issues are 
now an important item on the Internet Governance Forum, convened at 
the UN Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis (November 
2005). The Declaration of Principles Building the Information Society: A global 
challenge in the New Millennium reiterates the global commitment to safe-
guarding children (WSIS, 2003: paragraphs 11 and 59). These expressions 
of policy intent illustrate some of the ways children’s rights norms and 
the recommendations in the UN Study on Violence against Children help 
articulate the principles and values informing the role and functions of 
various stakeholders within the MSIG framework (Klein, 2004). The regu-
latory developments and initiatives promoted in the EU reflect a new 
commitment and confidence in its ability to forge partnerships and cre-
ate incentives for all stakeholders to adopt the benchmark standards and 
principles provided by the UNCRC and the CPC Convention in particular. 
The governance strategies are very much in keeping with the thrust of 
the UN 2006 Study on Violence against Children, which is to safeguard chil-
dren from all threats of violence. The need to ground policy responses 
on research, and increasing policymakers understanding of children and 
their parents/carers’ actual use of technology is a welcome development. 
It is a development that has the endorsement of researchers and prac-
titioners across the EU and the United States. One view of these devel-
opments is that online child safety governance is rightly regarded as a 
priority for national and international standard setting efforts (Gallagher, 
2009). It may be somewhat harsh to suggest that a government’s public 
pronouncements regarding its prioritisation of safeguarding children are 
nothing more than the rhetorical flourishes of self-serving bias (Maduro, 
2007). That said, it would perhaps be more accurate to say that since 1999 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

International Cooperation and Policymaking 219
considerable progress has been made in safeguarding children in the on-
line environment. Even though many of the Conventions, treaties and 
policies are of a general nature, they do reflect a growing recognition that 
as Web 2.0 technologies become the primary medium for communication 
and interaction, the situation for children will worsen without timely and 
effective intervention (ITU, 2010b: 9). In the next chapter, we will con-
sider some examples of how these instruments and legal standards pro-
vide an important framework for enhancing the safety of children in the 
online environment.

An overview
Whilst governments have an undoubted role to play in shaping child pro-
tection policy, increasingly, it is in the outcome of the interactions between 
governments, NGOs, voluntary organisations and industry where the tan-
gible results of the policymaking debates and collaborations will emerge in 
homes, schools and communities (Dutton et al., 2007). The question of how 
civil society, the private sector and the State respond to the transnational 
character of the threats facing children is a complex and challenging one 
(Giddens, 1990). It is not possible to do justice to the many issues raised 
by this question, nor is it possible to undertake a detailed examination of 
the role of NGOs and the industry in enhancing the safety of children at 
the domestic and regional level. That said, the neglect of these interactions 
in current online child safety policymaking justifies, at the very least, an 
attempt made to describe their significance for MSIG (Falk, 1995; Grugel, 
2003). Indeed, the increasing role of civil society in this area of child pro-
tection has contributed to the creation of a new climate for children’s rights 
advocacy and development of collaborative transnational networks. To this 
end, the work of the UN and its related organisations, and the engagement 
of stakeholders in the three World Congresses and the SIP, demonstrates 
an important paradigm shift in the way transnational actors and civil so-
ciety appear to assume responsibility for policing the online environment 
and enforcing child safety norms through the adoption of extra-legal strat-
egies (ECPAT, 2009). Consequently, to understand online child safety gov-
ernance, we cannot limit our focus to the efforts of law enforcement or 
legislation enacted by States. It is only by understanding the contributions 
made by non-State actors that we can gain some useful insights into the piv-
otal role of the MSIG strategy in enabling States to fulfil their national and 
international commitments towards children. Two questions will provide 
the focal point for this chapter. There is a particular need for everyone con-
cerned in online child safety to have some understanding as to why NGOs,

Alternative Strategies

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 221
voluntary organisations and the private sector have increasingly become 
key actors in the online safety regulatory landscape. The second question 
relates to identifying the processes which enable children’s rights princi-
ples and legal standards to become an integral part of the evolving MSIG 
framework. The chapter will begin with a brief account of the relationship 
between modernity, civil society and the State in relation to the protection 
of children from online sexual exploitation and abuse. It then integrates 
some of the insights offered by commentators like Ulrich Beck and Anthony 
Giddens, first introduced in Chapter 2, into the activities of some of the key 
international, regional and national organisations and explains their signifi-
cance for the emerging MSIG model for safeguarding children in the online 
environment (Beck, 1992; Giddens, 1991). The final part of the discussion 
considers some of the self- and co-regulatory models of good governance 
being used to enhance the safety of children in the online environment. 
The chapter concludes with the observation that the MSIG model repre-
sents an apt example of reflexive modernisation (Ayres et al., 1992). How we 
measure the effectiveness of this model will be an ongoing area of tension 
in online child safety policymaking (Eurochild, 2011).
Preliminary observations
There is at least at one level a noticeable desire amongst States and organisa-
tions to promote better rule making and governance in relation to children’s 
exposure to potential risks and threats in the online environment. The policy 
reviews undertaken in the United Kingdom, Australia, the United States and 
Canada show an increasing willingness by States and international institu-
tions to promote greater collaboration and cooperation amongst the various 
stakeholders (Hoffman, 2005). These developments may be explained in 
terms of neo-liberal approaches to governance; others who take a pragmatic 
outlook of transnational governance may be inclined to suggest that the 
rhetoric of good governance and efficient rule making is a reflection of the 
impact of globalisation on the ability of nation states to respond to domestic 
public policy issues in an effective and timely manner (Hann et al., 1996: 1; 
Long et al., 2009: 107–22). Even though States are seen as the primary polit-
ical actors responsible for enacting regulations, it is generally acknowledged 
that their ability to secure compliance with rules and laws has diminished 
considerably over the past half century with the emergence of transnational 
non-State actors (Hall et al., 2002). Some view the emergence of these trans-
national actors in global governance as an important aspect of democratisa-
tion (Bexell et al., 2010; Benkler, 2006). Others are a little more circumspect 
and suggest that the diminution in the role of the State as perhaps tilting 
the balance in favour of the private sector and its economic interests. That 
said, the increasing role of civil society organisations in providing a coun-
tervailing force should not be underestimated (Schewick, 2010; Bexell et al., 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

222 Online Child Safety
2010: 87; Beck, 2000; Baker et al., 2004). Hoffman, whilst accepting that 
governance is a contested concept, regards the redistribution of the roles 
and responsibilities between the State, the private sector and civil society 
within the context of the Internet “as an open-ended, collective process of 
searching which aims to fill a global ‘regulatory void’ both conceptually and 
institutionally in a legitimate way” (Hoffman, 2005: 2). Notwithstanding 
these perspectives about governance, one thing is clear – the erosion of the 
boundaries between broadcasting, telecommunications and entertainment 
poses us with some interesting insights into the way modernity brings into 
play non-State actors and institutional structures, processes and options for 
policymaking (Beck, 1997: 38; Golding, 2000; Porter, 2002).
Civil society, state and modernity
The capitalist framework for wealth creation and its international institutions 
provide an important backdrop to the way the Internet has now brought 
into the public spotlight the risks, threats and uncertainties surrounding 
children’s exposure to social media and technology (Beck, 1992a,b). The 
opening up of online child safety policymaking to non-State actors is one 
example of how governance frameworks increasingly provide platforms for 
engagement with a wide range of stakeholders from the industry and civil 
society (Giddens, 1990). Like Giddens, we can regard these developments as 
indicative of a cultural attitude towards institutionalisation of the lifeworld. 
He uses the term “modernity” in a very specific sense, and refers to
the institutions and modes of behaviour established first of all in post-
feudal Europe, but which in the twentieth century increasingly have be-
come world-historical in impact. (Giddens, 1991: 14–15)
This multi-faceted lifeworld consists of an array of actors, measures and 
policies at national, regional and supranational fora in addressing the risks 
faced by children’s exposure to Web 2.0 technologies. The symbols of mod-
ernity are also very much in evidence: disintermediated interactions, the 
regulatory space becoming populated by the private sector and civil society, 
the dispersion of rule making amongst transnational institutions and actors 
at different fora (i.e. individualisation of risks) and the emergence of re-
flexive regulatory systems aiming to reduce risk and uncertainty.
The concept of civil society
There are a number of descriptions applied to the concept of civil society. 
For example, the concept can be used as a shorthand way of distinguish-
ing the activities of community groups and NGOs from those traditionally 
ascribed to political institutions and systems (Keane, 1988, 2003). Another 
would be to emphasise its normative and instrumental characteristics which 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 223
entails the “management of society that is ‘bottom up’ rather than ‘top 
down’ and that involves the struggle for emancipatory goals” (Kaldor, 2003: 
142). In both accounts, the descriptions and attributes only provide a par-
tial account of the essence of the concept. As many observers have noted, 
the civil society concept has long been a feature of democratic systems. 
Popular activism, public protests, human rights advocacy and even collab-
orative decision-making have been associated with orthodox conceptions 
of civil society (Keane, 1998). The ambivalence surrounding the concept of 
civil society may be due to its ahistorical character and the role played by 
political, cultural and legal traditions in shaping our understanding of the 
concept (Ehrenberg, 1999). For present purposes, the following description 
of civil society will be adopted, which is
an intermediate associational realm between state and family populated 
by organisations which are separate from the state, enjoy autonomy in 
relation to the state and are formed voluntarily by members of society to 
protect or extend their interests or values. (White, 2004: 10)
This description attaches emergent properties within the concept of civil so-
ciety, which can be usefully employed to depict the MSIG model for online 
child safety. It can be used to describe the mobilisation of various stakehold-
ers into groups, from different parts of the world, each pursuing collective 
goals and values. The emergence of civil society as a response to govern-
ance issues with a public interest dimension is not a modern phenomenon 
(Becker, 1994). Its role in child protection is suggestive of an ideal type or-
ganisation comprising communities, volunteers and activists who are not 
constrained territorially and have increasingly taken a leading role in ur-
ging policymakers and industry to comply with established legal, treaty and 
convention obligations towards children (Beck, 1992a). Their increasing role 
in the discourse on online child safety policymaking at domestic, regional 
and supranational level provides an important counterpoint to the formal 
political and legal responses to issues like the CSEC. Civil society has an 
important role in terms of holding both governments and the private sector 
to account as well as raising public awareness of the key issues and concerns 
faced by children, parents and educators (ECPAT, 2008). One example of 
a thriving civil society community can be seen in the range of delegates 
from not-for-profit organisations participating in the WC III. It is probably 
accurate to say that these organisations pursue collective goals, with their 
raison d’être being defined by the normative foundations of human rights 
conventions like the UNCRC and its two Optional Protocols. The European 
NGO Alliance for Child Safety Online (eNASCO), which seamlessly weaves 
17 children’s rights NGOs from across the EU into a network node working 
for a safer online environment for children, is another example of civil so-
ciety being mobilised to advance children’s rights issues and policies. The

use of the concept of civil society does not imply that organisations coming 
within this category have objectives that are fundamentally at odds with 
those of the private sector or the State (Held, 1995). Indeed, the very nature 
of a MSIG framework consisting of various State and non-State actors across 
the spectrum of society suggests the existence of shared aims between the 
participants (Dutton et al., 2007: 71). To be sure, we have already seen in 
previous chapters the extent to which the State, civil society and the pri-
vate sector have complementary goals in relation to safeguarding children. 
Consequently, the challenge for policymakers lies not only in coordinating 
the activities but also in finding solutions to any resulting tensions that may 
hinder the broad governance objectives in safeguarding children (Bexell et 
al., 2010: 87). The integration of the FCACP into the MSIG framework can 
be seen as a necessary strategy since other stakeholders are least able to dis-
rupt the financial channels which sustain the CSEC. From a multi-layered 
governance perspective, it becomes imperative that policymakers determine 
how best the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders can be allocated 
efficiently and fairly. We will consider later how some of these interactions 
result in the convergence of governance strategies and responses (Beck, et 
al., 1994). For the moment, we can turn to the significance of the institu-
tions of capitalism and internationalisation of institutions for civil society 
participation and private sector engagement in online child safety policy-
making (Jobert et al., 2008).
The state, transnational actors and globalisation
The shift in political autonomy and rule making has been attributed to three 
parallel developments: the gradual decline in the role of the nation state in 
the face of global institutions like the IMF and the World Bank; the emer-
gence of transnational corporations and the growing influence of NGOs 
(Berlie, 2009: 12). No one is likely to disagree with the fact that globalisation 
has led to the emergence of the phenomena where the State is now only one 
of a number of actors engaged in standard setting and governance activities. 
What interests us here is the relationship between the logic of the capitalist 
system of wealth creation on the one hand and the governance issues and 
difficulties raised by the globalisation of risks as a consequence on the other 
(Ohmae, 1990, 1995; Castells, 1997). Castells, for example, views the result-
ing phenomenon of complex interdependence as the product of the “global-
isation of core economic activities, by globalisation of media and electronic 
communication, and by globalisation of crime” (Castells, 1997: 244). Whilst 
we may question whether the interconnected nature of economic, techno-
logical and cultural activities accelerated the erosion of the pivotal role of 
States, it is the child safety governance significance of these new dimensions 
of convergence that interest us at this moment (Hall et al., 2002). Castells’ 
point is pertinent to the extent that it highlights an important feature of 
modernity, namely, the intensification of the globalisation of systems of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 225
wealth creation, which also leads to institutions and organisations now hav-
ing to manage the negative effects of network infrastructures and informa-
tion flows (Beck, 1992a). Castells provides us with a powerful example of 
modernity, which chimes well with online child safety policymaking. He 
observes the ever-increasing commoditisation of children as sexual objects 
resulting from growing media coverage of child sexual abuse and exploit-
ation, the increasing poverty and the breakdown in family infrastructures 
and the globalisation of “markets for everything, and from everywhere to 
everywhere, whether it be organized sex tours or audiovisual distribution 
of pornographic material worldwide” (Castells, 1998:160). Quayle, Loof and 
Palmer highlight in their report that young adolescents are complicit in the 
culture of commoditisation but through self-victimisation (Quayle et al., 
2008: 63). Techno-economic advances also create new channels for misuse 
and risk distribution as seen in the case of R v Morelli (2010). The offender 
was convicted for possession of child pornography contrary to Section 
163.1(4) of the Criminal Code. What is particularly instructive, within the 
context of Beck’s view of capitalist systems generating risks, is the offender’s 
use of new technologies and the Internet to create illegal content and le-
verage the communication platforms for CSEC (e.g. Usenet, websites, social 
networking sites and file-sharing software programs) (FCACP, 2008). The 
vignettes above demonstrate the complex risk milieu of modernity that is 
now being replicated across deviant communities across the world. There 
is in this sense a market “for everything and everywhere” (Castells, 1998: 
150). Consequently, the resulting public anxieties have been mirrored in 
a number of responses. NGOs continue to demand that the State and ICT 
industry fulfil their social and moral obligations towards children. New 
collaborations target the CSEC industry. The inclusion of the FCACP into 
the MSIG is just the latest in a series of reflexive responses aiming to dis-
rupt the payment channels sustaining the CSEC industry. As reports point 
to the growth in the child abuse images industry policymakers have also 
increased their efforts in mobilising a global response to risk management – 
the harmonisation of rules protecting children from CSEC, use of policing 
networks and industry engagement (OECD, 2008b, 2009; IWF, 2010b). The 
traditional State-directed form of risk regulation has evolved to include 
new governance arrangements, which emphasise deliberation, participa-
tion and frequent use of risk assessment strategies (European Commission, 
2001b). One final observation can be made about the role of market rules 
and norms in the production of risks. Risks are distributed unevenly and 
another aspect of modernity is the measures and strategies developed to 
reduce societal anxiety and fears. For example, the threats posed to chil-
dren with the growth of sex tourism and the rise in demand for child abuse 
materials often involve victims from developing countries and those at the 
lower end of socio-economic class structures (ECPAT, 2009). Indeed, as the 
World Congress III reports from Rio illustrate, the growth of transnational 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

226 Online Child Safety
criminal activity, the emergence of deviant cultures, the rise of sex tourism 
and child pornography serve as apt reminders of the “invisible hand” seek-
ing to impose its own perverse logic on societies, economies and individuals 
least able to respond to the risks (ECPAT, 2008: 76–81). The continuing im-
pact of Web 2.0 technologies on communities least able to address the risks 
are uncertain, but the locations for future commercial exploitation are not 
difficult to glean since
[b]y the year 2015, half of the world’s online population will reside in 
two countries: China and India. The take up of digital technology in 
Asia over the coming decade will be nothing short of dramatic. In all 
probability, the growth of online commerce will follow a parallel trend. 
This will provide unprecedented numbers of potential victims and pro-
spective offenders. (Grabosky, 2007b: 157)
There are three points to be noted with regard to the significance of “techno-
logical innovations” for evolving online child safety governance clusters. 
First, the governance processes are embedded in the logic of capitalist sys-
tems of information flows and exchange. Economic objectives will be pur-
sued alongside social and cultural objectives (see Table 6.1).
Second, advances in communications can also lead to a “creative de-
struction” of governance strategies and measures. Third, since the “risk 
society” creates winners and losers, responding to the threats becomes a 
preoccupation of policymakers and organisations at national, regional and

made to highlight the significance of some of the online child safety clus-
ters within the MSIG framework.
The regulatory domain of online child safety
The emerging network of MSIG (non-State actors)
A cursory examination of the directories from the Child Online Protection 
Division of the ITU and the Family Online Safety Institute provides us with 
a snapshot of how non-state actors continue to organise themselves in the 
converging governance space in the age of modernity (Djelic et al., 2006; 
Berlie, 2009; Table 6.2).

The broad reach of the network of non-State actors is striking. Some rea-
sons can be provided for the emergence of non-State actors in this sphere of 
governance. One explanation would be that the Internet has provided NGOs 
with a new communicative space for engaging with a wide audience. The 
policies and initiatives pursued by governments can be subject to increased 
scrutiny, child safety information can be uploaded on websites and blogs and 
information and ideas can be easily located through the use of search engines 
and RSS services (Longford et al., 2007). The strategies adopted by civil society 
and NGOs in disseminating their online child protection proposals have also

increased their visibility and presence (Nelson et al., 2008: 2–3, 27). NGOs 
seek to frame their activities in terms of requiring the private sector and gov-
ernments to fulfil their legal and UNCRC or treaty commitments towards 
children. Networking with major international human rights NGOs also 
enhances their influence (Scholte, 2002; Bexell et al., 2010). The formation of 
international alliances provides NGOs with the widest possible access to ex-
pertise, resources and audiences. NGOs continue to play an active role in the 
online child safety consultation process. The Save the Children organisation 
makes regular representations at national, regional and international sum-
mits. Childnet International, a UK-based charity, uses its domestic and inter-
national networks to promote public awareness of online safety issues and has 
produced a number of education resources relating to peer victimisation. It 
was also one of the first members of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety 
(UKCCIS). Whilst Childnet has a domestic and regional presence, this organ-
isation has an international limb in its child advocacy activities. Childnet 
has worked with ACMA and the Child Health Promotion Research Centre 
(CHPRC) at the Edith Cowan University (ECU) in Perth in contributing to 
online safety educational and awareness raising programmes for children. We 
have already seen the positive response of civil society organisations and the 
private sector in the SIP. These are trends which can be found replicated in 
other jurisdictions (OSTWG, 2010; ACMA, 2009a,b,c). The Canadian Centre 
for Child Protection (CCCP), which is a charity focused on promoting the 
safety of children, has actively promoted public awareness activities and edu-
cation programmes on personal safety. It has two initiatives which involve col-
laboration with industry. For example, in partnership with TELUS, the Centre 
created a website aimed at promoting parents’ and children’s awareness of the 
potential risks accompanying the use of mobile phones and the steps that can 
be taken to manage these risks or prevent them from arising in the first place.1 
The website also has a mechanism through which mobile phone users can 
report online sexual abuse to the national hotline – Cybertip.ca. The Centre 
has also worked with the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association 
to create a website – textED.ca – aimed at educating children and young 
persons about responsible use of texting technology. In the United States, 
Congressional Hearings provide various stakeholders with an opportunity to 
bring particular issues to the attention of legislators (US Senate Committee, 
2010). The Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety of the 43rd Parliament 
in Australia received 147 submissions from individuals and organisations on 
a range of online security and safety issues affecting children’s use of the 
Internet and Web 2.0 technologies.2 Non-State actors also use other avenues 
for mainstreaming child welfare and rights issues. Forums like the WSIS cre-
ate opportunities for civil society to engage with industry and governments 
(including those from developing countries) in the governance process (WSIS, 
2005: Item 65). The creation of the Internet Governance Forum as part of the 
Tunis Agenda envisages a forum for cooperation and engagement which “will 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

230 Online Child Safety
be multilateral, multi-stakeholder, democratic and transparent” (WSIS, 2005: 
Item 73). Finally, the issues raised by contact, conduct and content risks also 
become the focal point of civil society activism (ASIL, 2007). Indeed, one has 
only to look at the sheer volume of online child safety awareness content cre-
ated by NGOs to appreciate why policymakers and States have been keen to 
engage with civil society.
Regulatory opportunities and constraints
As Web 2.0 technologies and communication networks transform the 
market and social environment, good governance is now seen as an indis-
pensable objective by policymakers and the private sector (OECD, 2004). 
Techniques like self-regulation and co-regulation are regarded as legitimate 
alternatives to State-directed regulation, particularly as these make possible 
flexible horizontal and vertical decision-making structures (OECD, 2010a,b). 
These processes have been regarded by some as a pragmatic response which 
involves roles and responsibilities being allocated to all stakeholders in the 
“information chain” (Cave et al., 2008: 1–8; Fisher, 2010). The allocation 
of these responsibilities does not come free of tensions that  already exist 
amongst the stakeholders regarding the implementation of child safety 
measures. As noted in Chapter 2, the end-to-end principle has shaped much 
of our thinking about governance and more specifically the options and 
strategies for content regulation and the Internet sector generally. The prin-
ciple of non-intervention, which has contributed to the emergence of the 
Internet as a social and technological phenomenon, is the product of vi-
sionary policymaking and what Cerf described in his testimony as “policy 
judgment rested on an existing regulatory framework that allowed open 
and non-discriminatory access to the Internet” (US Senate Committee, 
2006). In a report issued by the Working Group on Internet Governance it 
was noted that any governance arrangements must take into account the 
design principles that contributed to its creation and continued social and 
economic growth (WGIG, 2005: 24). Interestingly, Mueller’s observation 
that Internet governance is a matter for its regulatory institutions and not 
state-mandated commands should not be taken to mean that policymakers 
are marginalised in regulatory decisions (Mueller, 2010: 11). NGOs continue 
to lobby policymakers, industry and the technical community to re-think 
the neo-liberal assumptions in the end-to-end principle (Klinke et al., 2006). 
This uncompromising stance was very much in evidence in the submission 
made recently by eNASCO to the FTC in the United States:3
Above all we need to stop thinking about the Internet as if it were, essen-
tially, an adult medium for which special (meaning “irritating”) provi-
sions need to be made to take account of the fact that children will use it 
from time to time. Children and young people are a large, persistent and 
permanent group of Internet users.

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 231
However, creating “risk-free” zones through the deployment of cyber-equiv-
alent safety measures and tools pose social costs on society and industry 
(Kuperman, 2008: 219–20; WGIG, 2005: 9). Kelly suggests that an over-
emphasis on safety concerns may stall technological innovation since when 
“it comes to risk aversion, we are not rational. We select which risks we want 
to contend” (Kelly, 2010: 248). Notwithstanding the tensions that surround 
Internet governance, five key regulatory principles inform the MSIG standard 
setting process. The measures adopted are expected to be (i) transparent; (ii) 
accountable; (iii) proportionate; (iv) consistent; and (v) targeted (Department 
of Business, Information and Skills, 2009). These principles are used to frame 
risk-based decision-making which aims to promote trust and confidence and 
its corollary – reduce children’s exposure to risks (Fisher, 2010). For example, 
transparency in the methods or measures adopted by social networking sites 
can promote trust and confidence if the information communicated relates 
to the steps that are being taken to identify and minimise children’s needless 
exposure to conduct, contact and content risks. Consistency in the applica-
tion of standards not only promotes certainty but also allows individuals to 
order their activities accordingly. The principle of accountability requires that 
online service providers in particular assume responsibility for the safety and 
well-being of individuals who use their products and services in accordance 
with reasonable standards of care. One benefit in using these principles, as 
opposed to legislation, within the ICT industry is that they enable online ser-
vice providers to make operational decisions on how risks are to be managed, 
communicated and even allocated to its users (Hood et al., 2001: 3). Industry 
standards for network security, Internet protocols and domain names practices 
also help define the way online safety incidents can be managed operation-
ally. The role of the State in this context is to determine what constitutes an ac-
ceptable level of risk to be borne by both online intermediaries and users (e.g. 
EC Directive 2000/EC/31). Adherence to the principles of proportionality and 
efficiency also ensure that governance strategies are sustainable and scalable.
Managing the transition from “industrial” to a “networked” environment 
is challenging on two fronts (Hood et al., 2001). First, policymakers have to 
confront the consequences of “the spontaneous appearance of qualitatively 
different systems and mechanisms” and consequently find it “necessary to 
‘rewire’ the speed, efficiency and effectiveness of global governance” (Cave 
et al., 2007: 30). Second, the idea that Internet norms and values should con-
tinue to prevail regardless of the harmful consequences is not an easy one to 
defend (Bohman, 1996; Knight et al., 1997). As the extract from eNasco cited 
above makes plain, the question of what constitutes an effective risk man-
agement policy and strategy will be a constant source of arguments about 
regulatory capture and fairness in decision-making processes (Dahl, 1989: 
305–6). That said, the evolving online child safety regulatory landscape, 
which emphasises governance rather than regulation by government, is, 
however, encouraging. A number of policy reviews have also recommended 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

232 Online Child Safety
the benefits of adopting the MSIG strategy for enhancing the safety of chil-
dren in the online environment (OSTWG, 2010; ISTTF, 2009; ACMA, 2009d; 
Table 6.3). It is not uncommon to find policymakers integrating deliberative 
and participatory risk management processes into sector-specific activities 
(e.g. mobile phones, social networking sites and online games), which seek 
to create a coherent risk management framework in measures like
a. Information Security Awareness
b. Online Safety Design Solutions; and
c. Parental Controls
Online intermediaries and mobile service providers now incorporate 
measures enhancing the safety of children in the online environment; these 
are significant obligations and need to be considered alongside intermedi-
aries’ response to “notice and take down” requests, filtering and blocking of 
illegal or problematic content.
There are four observations to be made. First, there is no “ideal” risk-based 
model or technique of regulation. Indeed, there are advantages and disadvan-
tages in adopting direct, self- and co-regulatory strategies. Second, the use of 
a risk-based approach can be used to operationalise strategies and measures 
based on evidence of risks actually encountered by children or in its delib-
erative constitutive sense of prudential management principles (Fisher, 2010: 
48–50). Third, policymakers need to make available incentive mechanisms 
which will encourage online intermediaries and service providers to promote 
socially valuable outcomes. Finally, managing a globalised networked economy 
requires governments to engage with various stakeholders and define the ac-
ceptable levels of risks users should be expected to bear in their daily online 
interactions and use of Web 2.0 technologies and services (Sunstein, 2005).

Managing risks and complexity: A reflection
The management of risk is a complex endeavour. The governance challenges 
encountered when broadcasting was “new technology” are not dissimilar to 
those faced by policymakers in safeguarding children in the online environ-
ment (Fleming, 1996; Marsden, 1999). Controlling the content of informa-
tion broadcasted, whether on the Internet or analogue environment, requires 
a balance to be struck between “communication or freedom of expression” 
rights and the need to protect children and vulnerable groups from illegal 
content and age-inappropriate online video games (European Commission, 
2008; Fisher, 2009). With the emergence of the Internet and the conver-
gence of protocols, communications can now be transmitted through VOIP 
and Internet protocol television (IPTV) and standard setting activities now 
extend to these modes of communication and information flows. As the 
recent arguments regarding blocking obligations only make clear, the use 
of technology to secure compliance with legal rules and norms is a double-
edged sword since it has the potential to erode the distinct boundaries of 
legislative, executive and judicial powers (Cave et al., 2007: 21).
The proliferation of illegal and age-inappropriate content on the Internet 
has intensified the pressures on the ICT industry and online service provid-
ers and created tensions amongst the stakeholders. These tensions have not 
been alleviated. The IWF noted the increased volumes of illegal content 
now found on the Internet (IWF, 2010b). These findings mirror those also 
found by the Canadian Child Exploitation Center in 2009 (see Table 6.4).
The domain name system continues to be abused by individuals and 
organisations engaged in CSEC (CCCP, 2009; IWF, 2010b; Table 6.5).

Center (2009)

234 Online Child Safety
The examples in Table 6.5 illustrate just some of the ways the logic of in-
formation flows introduce a degree of complexity and speed into the way 
issues and roles of governments, the private sector and civil society have 
to be reassessed and redefined, since in “a slower world, the blind forces 
of evolution could be relied on to adjust business and political models to 
meet such economic, political, cultural and environmental challenges” 
(Cave et al., 2007: 30). The transformation in the public and private sector 
engagement in online child safety governance reflects in one respect the 
way “systems” operate. Cherry and Bauer use complexity theory to high-
light the difficulty in developing sustainable policies in an environment 
of complex adaptive systems (Cherry et al., 2004). They suggest that the 
nature of complex systems and the unpredictability of such systems create 
problems for policy prescriptions based on outcomes rather than processes. 
Consequently, managing risk in an environment of decentralised and com-
plex network infrastructures eludes customised governance prescriptions in 
view of the range of stakeholders participating in the policymaking and 
deliberative process.
There are three particular responses to risk management in the age of 
modernity. First, policymakers seeking to develop and implement child pro-
tection policies now have to address the unintended and disruptive conse-
quences resulting from those who seek to evade its rules through the use of 
encryption technologies, P2P networks and websites from locations that are 
outside the reach of national law enforcement authorities. Second, a more 
immediate policy challenge is to facilitate the process where international 
standards and principles for safeguarding children can be better coordi-
nated within the MSIG framework. Third, as policymakers increasingly turn 
to legal, technical and educational solutions to promote safety norms, they

cannot ignore moral hazards that may accompany precautionary and pru-
dential risk management strategies (Van Asselt, 2005).
The MSIG model
What the preceding discussions highlight is not only the complex dynamics 
of MSIG but that the management of online risks to the various contexts 
and multimedia platforms will require
the development and application by Governments, the private sector and 
civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, 
decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution 
and use of the Internet. (WGIG, 2005: 3)
The very intricacies of governance and the emotive nature of the issues raised 
by sex tourism, child pornography and online sexual grooming should alert 
us to the fact that we cannot neatly package governance polices or regard 
one regulatory technique as overcoming moral hazard issues and risk gener-
ated by poor decision-making skills. As Ayres and Braithwaite observe:
Good policy analysis is not about choosing between the free market and 
government regulation. Nor is it simply deciding what the law should 
proscribe ... It is this mix, this interplay, that works to assist or impede 
solution of the policy problem. (1992: 3)
Critically, the move from managing offline to online risks has led two para-
digmatic shifts in risk governance:
First, science is increasingly needed to make these risks “visible”. Theories, 
models and sophisticated measurements are needed where our senses 
fall short. Accordingly, the role of science has partly shifted from calcu-
lating hazards faced by people to assessing potential dangers that we do 
not experience. Second, current risk assessment is increasingly future-
oriented. The main question has shifted from one of “what has happened 
in the past” (probability) as a basis for risk assessment to one of “what 
may happen in the future” (possibility). Accordingly, risk assessment is 
increasingly affected by all kinds of uncertainties pertaining to future 
developments that cannot be ignored. (Van Asselt et al., 2009: 362)
The UK approach
The United Kingdom continues to regard self- and co-regulation as appro-
priate regulatory strategies for online child safety. One practical benefit in 
using codes of practice as a governance strategy in relation to hotlines, mo-
bile phone and content providers and social networking sites is that they vest 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

236 Online Child Safety
in sector-specific businesses and industries the responsibility for developing 
and implementing risk management and risk communication decisions, with 
relevant government oversight. Additionally, given that parental and chil-
dren’s concerns may be related to age-inappropriate and culturally sensitive 
online content, the law provides an overarching regulatory framework leav-
ing online service providers some degree of flexibility in the way they de-
ploy technical and design solutions and risk communication measures. For 
example, online service providers are encouraged to make available parental 
software control tools and relevant information to users like parents, educa-
tors and children to help them identify content and services that are exclu-
sive to adults only. The UK government, like many others, has focused on 
creating appropriate structures to encourage businesses and the ICT industry 
to undertake an ongoing assessment and review of the policies and meas-
ures adopted, with State-mandated measures at one end of the regulatory 
spectrum and standard setting reporting processes and codes of practice by 
non-State and corporate actors on the other end (OfCom, 2008a,b). The IWF 
can be seen as an apt example of how concerns about some online risks can 
be operationalised and devolved to parties best able to manage them (IWF, 
2008, 2010a). Interestingly, managing children’s exposure to illegal content 
and minimising availability of such content are regarded as important on-
line child safety governance objectives.4 The IWF is funded by the Internet 
industry and the EU and has a diverse membership of around 100 members, 
which include Internet service providers, mobile operators and content ser-
vice providers, search engine operators, social networking sites, IT and soft-
ware companies and online payment companies. The IWF also works closely 
with the UK government, law enforcement authorities both in the United 
Kingdom and abroad and international organisations like INHOPE. The IWF 
fulfils an important role in the creation, distribution and consumption of 
child abuse content and child sexual abuse material. Its remit involves the 
reporting of criminal online content to the police and operates the “notice 
and take down” process. The “content” comprises child sexual abuse images 
hosted online anywhere in the world; adult content regarded as criminally 
obscene and hosted in the United Kingdom; content inciting racial hatred 
which is hosted in the United Kingdom and non-photographic child sexual 
abuse images hosted in the United Kingdom. The last category was included 
into the remit of the IWF following a request made by the Ministry of Justice 
in 2009. Sections 62–9 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 now include non-
photographic visual depictions of child sexual abuse in the form of computer-
generated images within its category of prohibited content. The IWF is not 
purely a UK “notice and take down” issuing body for child sexual abuse con-
tent. The organisation makes available to the UK Internet industry and on-
line service providers a twice daily updated list of websites which host illegal 
images of children, advertisements and links to the content. The UK Internet 
industry subscribes to the Code of Practice for Notice and Takedown of UK Hosted

Content. This document serves as a standard setting tool. It describes the re-
sponsibilities assumed by ISPs for ensuring the safety and security of its cus-
tomers with regard to exposure to illegal online content. The expectation 
that members comply with the obligation to implement appropriate measures 
in response to notices suggest that policymakers recognise that there is no 
perfect security solution. The guidance provided by the Code is advisory in 
nature and describes the obligations in a manner which can be reasonably 
understood and complied with. For example, Appendix 2 defines policies that 
members need to adopt when hosting newsgroups. The IWF also advises ISPs 
not to carry newsgroups that are normally regarded as promoting or linking 
to content of a paedophilic nature. Finally, to assist companies, IT and HR and 
legal professionals, the IWF provides these professionals with relevant and 
appropriate information aimed at raising their awareness of the precise scope 
of the organisation’s authority and remit, the law on child sexual abuse and 
the mechanisms for reporting and measures which ensure compliance with 
legal standards and rules. The focus on due diligence implies that not only 
is security governance an ongoing process that demonstrating compliance 
with industry standards is an important governance measure. that members 
are able to demonstrate compliance with industry’s standards. Updating of 
keywords and phrases used to locate sexual abuse content online to members 
allows ISPs to adopt responsive measures aimed at minimising the availability 
of and accessibility to such content. The work undertaken by the IWF has an 
impact at the regional and international level. Foreign-based ISPs and hosts 
of websites use the information provided by the IWF to reduce the number 
of portals where child sexual abuse content are located. The IWF also notifies 
national and international news providers and ISPs of cases involving online 
newsgroups which host and advertise child sexual abuse content. Finally, the 
IWF provides its staff and partners with best practice guidelines relating to 
the collection and processing of potentially illegal indecent images of child 
sexual abuse. To avoid potential prosecution under the PCA, a Memorandum 
of Understanding was concluded between the CPS and the ACPO.5 The aim 
of the Memorandum is to facilitate good governance in terms of collabor-
ation and information sharing between those engaged in collecting, investi-
gating and prosecuting offences relating to the creation and distribution of 
child abuse images. The continued importance of the IWF needs to be seen in 
its ability to balance societal expectations that risks be managed on the one 
hand and industry’s recognition that early identification of the problems and 
the steps to be taken are critical to securing compliance with their obligations 
and responsibilities on the other.
The Canadian approach
The CRTC is an independent organisation responsible for the regulation and 
supervision of the Canadian broadcasting and telecommunications systems. 
It reports to the Minister of Canadian Heritage who in turn is accountable 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

238 Online Child Safety
to Parliament. Whilst the CRTC works to ensure that its citizens can gain 
access to the Internet through their telephone service, its remit does not 
extend to regulating online content.6 The Canadian Association of Internet 
Providers (CAIP) is a non-profit organisation which represents Internet ser-
vice providers in the country. The Code of Conduct requires all its members 
to observe the laws and cooperate with the law enforcement authority. Its 
value in standard setting and promoting compliance and timely responses 
to threats and risks are very much in line with the points raised with re-
gard to the IWF. Industry regulation is achieved through a mixture of laws 
and best practices.7 The Government of Canada set up a national hotline in 
2004. Cybertip.ca received a five-year funding agreement with Public Safety 
Canada. Its remit is to receive reports from the general public on matters re-
lating to the sexual exploitation of children. The website is owned and oper-
ated by the CCCP. Cybertip.ca works closely with law enforcement partners 
from across the Internet and telecommunications industry. It has a much 
wider role than the IWF in that it is the organisation that also receives reports 
on online sexual exploitation of children.8 The matters that come within its 
remit are child sexual abuse images and material, online sexual grooming 
(luring), child exploitation through prostitution, travelling to sexually ex-
ploit children and child trafficking. Cybertip.ca is a member of INHOPE. 
Cybertip.ca’s processing of reports is not dissimilar to those adopted by 
IWF or other hotlines. For example, following a report, Cybertip.ca assesses 
whether the report is within its remit and cross-references the complaint 
with Canada’s Criminal Code. If a complaint involves a child victim, the 
report is designated as priority and work is undertaken in processing the 
report. The report also draws on web research and makes available relevant 
information which will assist law enforcement in investigating the incident. 
Cybertip.ca undertakes a significant amount of public awareness campaigns. 
For example, to encourage the public to report incidents of child sexual ex-
ploitation, the organisation conducted a campaign across the major states 
in Canada. The campaign “I Reported It” aimed to raise public awareness 
about the crucial role played by individuals in society in reducing online 
child sexual exploitation by reporting incidents to Cybertip.ca. It is perhaps 
reasonable to suggest that the self-regulation approach pursued in Canada 
appears to regard the division of responsibilities as a strategy for addressing 
the problems raised by the ready availability and distribution of illegal con-
tent. For example, the Act respecting the mandatory reporting of Internet child 
pornography by persons who provide an Internet service 2010 provides a regula-
tory framework relating to the reporting duties of persons who provide an 
Internet service to the public if they are informed about an Internet address 
where child pornography may be accessed by the general public or if they 
have reasonable grounds to believe that their Internet service is being or has 
been used to commit a child pornography offence (Section 3).

The Australian approach
ACMA ensures that the communication industry complies with the obli-
gations under the relevant legislation.9 Apart from being a member of 
INHOPE, ACMA also addresses issues relating to the mobile and fixed line 
telecommunications sector. Since the inception of ACMA, the telecom-
munications industry has developed schemes that resemble co-regulation 
in the sense that the non-attainment of the objectives results in interven-
tion by Government regulators (Lindsay et al., 2008). The Communications 
Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Act 2007 creates a content regu-
latory system and has introduced a new Schedule 7 into the Broadcasting 
Services Act 1992. Schedule 7 of the BSA brings within its governance 
framework stakeholders like the Internet industry (e.g. the Internet Industry 
Association Content Services Code) and content service providers (e.g. the 
Restricted Access Systems Declaration 2007) (Lindsay et al., 2008: 31.5). 
Broadly, ACMA’s regulatory oversight covers service providers that are 
“carriers”, “carriage service providers” and “content service providers”. It 
is suggested that the consumer protection policy is balanced by the im-
portance ACMA attaches to promoting innovation and competition in the 
industry. Even though the MSIG strategy aims to provide a coherent and 
principled framework to the regulation of online content, there are diffi-
cult policy issues that remain to be addressed (which are not unique to this 
jurisdiction):
Questions remain about the extent to which it has correctly balanced 
the competing policy objectives in this area. While it is important to en-
sure that children are appropriately protected from unsuitable content, 
it is also important to ensure that adults are free to access content and to 
foster an innovative local content industry. (Lindsay et al., 2008: 31.27)
The co-regulatory strategy is also evident in the regulation of Internet and 
mobile phone content (Schedules 5 and 7 of the BSA 1992). ACMA main-
tains a register of codes of practice and standards made under the relevant 
legislation. One scheme overseen by ACMA relates to the protection of chil-
dren from illegal and inappropriate content. There are codes of practice for 
Internet and mobile content. Breaches of the codes by ISPs or mobile con-
tent providers will constitute a breach of the relevant legislation. For ex-
ample, under the three revised Internet content codes of practice registered 
under Schedule 5 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Schedule 5), ISPs 
and Internet content hosts are required to implement appropriate strategies 
for managing the use of the Internet by minors, to make provision for end 
users’ use of filtering and other content management tools and to provide 
online safety information. In the event of an ISP being deemed not to have 
taken the appropriate measures, ACMA may issue a compliance order, and if 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

this is not acted upon to the satisfaction of the authority, an offence will be 
deemed to have been committed under the legislation.
What is interesting about each of these national approaches to managing 
online risks is the multi-level and distributive characteristics of online child 
safety governance. The central features of collaboration, identification of 
the subject matter for regulatory intervention and participation of State, 
civil society and industry provide a blueprint for MSIG models at regional 
and international levels (Klinke, 2009: 406). Two considerations continue 
to inform the MSIG framework adopted by policymakers from each of the 
jurisdictions considered above. First, since the pace of technological innov-
ation can expose the shortcomings of any national legal system, and its 
rules, codes of practice will continue to be regarded as providing sufficient 
flexibility and adaptability. Second, self-regulation not only enables the in-
dustry to assume direct responsibility for managing consumer concerns and 
needs, but the inclusion of civil society in the deliberative process will en-
sure a measure of democratic participation and accountability.
The business case for collaboration and cooperation
Search engine operators, social networking sites and mobile phone produc-
ers are actively engaged in reassuring policymakers and consumers that their 
products and services meet with consumer and societal expectations of trust 
and confidence. Google, for example, launched its flagship website support-
ing parents and children in their efforts in adopting safe search practices. 
It also provides user with tools which can be used to raise concerns and re-
port problems.10 Facebook, the social networking site, continues to promote 
safe social networking norms.11 It has recently launched a network publics 
type social reporting platform where users are effectively provided with an 
opportunity to develop and promote appropriate social norms within their 
communities. To address the trust deficit that sometimes promotes inse-
curity on social networking sites, design solutions have also been integrated 
into user’s pages to enable them to make visible communications that are 
hurtful or unpleasant, through the use of report or help buttons. This recent 
governance measure can be seen as an attempt to create and sustain a posi-
tive environment for promoting acceptable community norms and values, 
in the light of growing concerns about peer victimisation occurring on so-
cial networking sites (White House, 2011). The social networking site has 
also incorporated Microsoft’s PhotoDNA “hash” technology, which helps 
moderators detect any illegal child abuse images uploaded on its platforms 
(Allen, 2011).
The involvement of the private sector in assuring parents and children 
that reasonable efforts have been taken to ensure the safety of their services 
and products is perhaps another example of how businesses are embra-
cing their social and ethical obligations towards consumers, which include 
children (Carroll et al., 2010). Proactive involvement in child safety can of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 241
course be viewed as a strategy to elevate brand status and avoid public 
criticism (Bhattacharya et al., 2004; Carroll et al., 2010). That said, the re-
sponsiveness of business organisations to consumer expectations regard-
ing their safety can be viewed as being consistent with the stakeholder or 
enlightened shareholder value governance model (Whetten et al., 2002). 
There are two aspects informing this broad view of corporate actors’ atti-
tudes towards Internet governance in this area of child protection. First, 
there is growing public expectation that reasonable online safety meas-
ures be adopted. Many online intermediaries and technology providers, 
for example, continue to emphasise the value and importance of respond-
ing to children and parental expectations that the services and products 
they provide either adhere to or even surpass the safety benchmarks put 
in place by legislation. Second, organisations now increasingly integrate 
child safety norms into their business models. One exposition that advo-
cates these ideas is the “media dependency” theory (Heslin et al., 2008). 
The authors suggest that, and one which is very much in keeping with 
the well-established narrative on corporate social responsibility, promoting 
consumer trust and confidence can enhance product awareness and re-
duce opportunities for adverse reactions that may result from ignoring the 
views of children, parents and policymakers on sensitive issues like access 
to illegal or inappropriate content, online sexual solicitation and peer 
victimisation (Einwiller et al., 2010). It is suggested that in a highly com-
petitive environment it would be perverse if social networking sites and 
mobile phone providers were shown to be lacking sensitivity to parental 
anxieties and fears about the safety of their children (Ball-Rokeach et al., 
1976; Morton et al., 2001). The “media dependency” theory, it should also 
be noted, is premised on the idea that the media provides an important 
channel through which information about risks encountered on social net-
working sites and online safety incidents generally are communicated to 
consumers. The theory suggests that since the private sector is particularly 
sensitive to portrayals of risks associated with their products or services, 
they tend to be particularly proactive in responding to consumer concerns 
and fears (Einwiller et al., 2010). We may be assuming too much about 
the interdependencies that emerge in the realm of online child safety pol-
icymaking between the media, civil society and the private sector. That 
said, the media dependence theory does at least help us recognise how 
and why organisations like Microsoft, Vodafone, Google and the various 
social networking and mobile phone service providers have been proactive 
in demonstrating their commitment towards implementing child safety 
and security measures (Porter, 2006; Carroll, 1991). Their engagement with 
child protection policymaking and development of industry best practices 
correspond with a discernible trend in online child safety policymaking 
activity which “structures, guides and controls human and social activities 
and interactions beyond, across and within national territories” (Djelic 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

242 Online Child Safety
et al., 2006: 6). The governance implications for ICT, mobile computing 
and online service providers are evident. For example, mobile phone and 
content service providers now not only meet the market needs for afford-
able and innovative products and services, but they also address consum-
ers’ safety needs and concerns. It can be said that the relations between 
social networking services providers and their users are also evolving into 
one where values like trust and confidence are seen as an integral part of 
the business–consumer relationship.
The role of civil society in Internet governance
From a constitutional perspective, the private sector and civil society are 
not regarded as political actors, and consequently require appropriate insti-
tutional infrastructures which facilitate their participation and engagement 
in national and international policymaking (Latzer, 2009). Some examples 
can be provided. The deliberations during the Byron Review, the Culture, 
Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry on Harmful Content on the Internet in 
Video Games and the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee on 
Personal Internet Security benefited from views expressed by industry, child 
welfare organisations and researchers from the United Kingdom and beyond 
(Byron, 2008; Culture, Media and Sport Committee, 2008; House of Lords 
Select Committee on Science and Technology, 2007). The US Government’s 
National Telecommunication and Information Administration in pursuance 
of the PROTECT Act 2003 established an OSTWG to review and evaluate the 
efforts made by industry in enhancing the safety of children. The Act speci-
fied that the Working Group must comprise at least 30 members who are rep-
resentatives from the relevant sectors in industry, public interest groups and 
other appropriate groups and Federal agencies (OSTWG, 2010: 1). The move 
to create participative processes and panels of “experts” is also embedded in 
international instruments. For example, Article 9 of the CPC Convention 
views cooperation between civil society, industry and governments as an 
integral part of online child safety governance. The Prague Declaration on 
“Safer Internet for Children”, which was adopted during th e Ministerial 
Conference “Safer Internet for Children – fighting together against illegal 
content and conduct on-line – can be seen as one illustration of the interplay 
between civil society and industry in online child safety standard setting ac-
tivity (Council of the European Union, 2009b). Supranational organisations 
regard engagement with stakeholders as an opportunity for capacity building 
and mainstreaming children rights and protection issues. The OECD contin-
ues to promote the MSIG model. In June 2008, a Ministerial consensus was 
reached indicating that governments had to work with other stakeholders, 
including civil society, the private sector and the Internet technical commu-
nity (OECD, 2008). On 15 April 2009, the OECD and Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) convened a symposium which brought together a wide 
range of participants from civil society with the aim of sharing information 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 243
and best practices on the protection of children.12 The delegates unequivo-
cally endorsed the MSIG model:
[a]lthough approaches may differ from country to country, it is signifi-
cant to involve various stakeholders and to promote international co-
operation between the government and the private sector ... It is also 
important to spark international debate by cooperating with other global 
institutions and fora. (OECD, 2009: paragraphs 21 and 32)
Finally, the EU has long advocated engagement with civil society and the 
private sector. The SIP, for example, provides a platform where stakeholders 
can exchange information about practices in the area of online child safety. 
The EU Kids Online II stakeholders’ forum, for example, invited participation 
from a cross-section of society (e.g. academics, industry child welfare organ-
isations, parent groups and governments) across 21 countries. The strategy 
was adopted with the aim of providing policymakers with recommenda-
tions appropriate to the needs of individual countries (Jorge et al., 2010).
Enhancing trust and reputation in the age of modernity
The widespread engagement by industry in enhancing the safety of children 
eases the burden and responsibility on policymakers to continuously enact 
laws in response to technological advancements and emerging threats. In 
the area of online child safety, social networking sites, ISPs, mobile phone 
and content providers and the telecommunication and broadcasting in-
dustry have adopted a wide range of measures to promote public confidence 
in their products and services. Online service providers and ISPs have also 
shown a willingness to work with law enforcement and policymakers. Many 
social networking sites now have filtering and reporting mechanisms to en-
able risks and problems to be identified. Sites like Facebook and MySpace 
provide users with information on how to seek redress for peer victimisa-
tion and report suspicions of grooming activity or problematic behaviours 
like self-harm and anorexia (Table 6.6).
One consequence of the MSIG approach is the concerted effort made by 
businesses to communicate and justify their risk management processes and 
decisions. Risk management and ongoing dialogue with the various stake-
holders is seen as an important governance strategy. As Jovanic remarks:
Information on the nature and extent of risks and its management is 
fundamental for shaping public opinion and helps to build trust in the 
proposed responses and in those who are entrusted with the mission to 
manage them. (Jovanic, 2010: 290)
Modernity has led to the opening up of a global governance space, which 
has made the adoption of an MSIG framework a necessity. Three reflexive

regulatory responses will be noted here for completeness. First, from a 
business or corporate perspective, promoting trust and confidence in its 
products and services is now very much a part of its standard setting ac-
tivity and business models. Second, the presumptive governance strategy 
appears to be that the formation of alliances with States and civil society is 
a sustainable business strategy providing reciprocal benefits to all stakehold-
ers. Third, notwithstanding the challenges posed by the Internet’s tech-
nical infrastructure, the widespread acceptance of security standards and 
principles by the ICT industry in particular becomes an important aspect 
of online child safety policymaking. Increased media and policy spotlight

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 245
on online child safety issues has no doubt made a significant difference 
in the way the ICT industry and the various online service providers now 
approach child safety issues and more specifically demonstrate their com-
mitment to promoting trust and confidence amongst their users. In add-
ition to the public awareness campaigns, many online service providers 
also use filtering content technologies to deal with illegal and problematic 
content and more general information security threats posed by malware, 
viruses and phishing. Yahoo!, Google, AOL and other online service provid-
ers now make available technological software controls that filter content – 
Safe Search tools, privacy controls to manage the information that can be 
accessed by third parties, abuse reporting mechanisms so that breaches of 
its terms of use are reported and anti-spyware and malware tools. For ex-
ample, AOL has embedded child safety standards into its business model. 
Design solutions have been embedded into the access layer to ensure that 
users can connect to the Internet safely. In addition to the online safety 
educational material and parental control mechanisms, the company also 
incorporates filtering software and safety incident reporting mechanisms 
on its email service and on the services it provides to parents and children. 
British Telecommunications (BT) is another example a company integrating 
child safety rules and norms into its business model (EUROPA, 2007b). It 
offers the company subscribers parental control software and educational 
materials. BT also works closely with the IWF and automatically blocks 
access to websites hosting child sexual abuse content. Google, the search 
engine operator, launched its Family Safety Center on 9 September 2010.13 
The information awareness portal is the culmination of the process of con-
sultation with parents and leading child safety organisations.
Some brief observations can be made with regard to the three governance 
challenges addressed by the Internet industry: first, the integration of child 
safety design and technological principles into business models; second, 
the necessity of translating these principles into meaningful measures and 
processes that end users can understand and, third, compliance with legal 
and industry standards. In respect of the latter, it should be noted that in 
a number of cases, businesses have shown a willingness to exceed current 
legal standards by focusing on the issues raised by consumers, parents and 
NGOs. Initiatives like increasing user awareness of the risks accompanying 
the use of the Internet, mobile phones, search engines and social network-
ing sites; promoting accessibility; the deployment of targeted technical solu-
tions relating to content and contact management and empowering parents 
and educators are now regarded as industry best practices. These responses 
aim to reassure parents and children that the risks attributed to the logic of 
information flows and networks and the nature of digital information can 
be minimised by adopting appropriate and reasonable technological, design 
and informational solutions. We can now turn to the governance responses 
aimed at enhancing the safety of children in two areas – mobile phone and

adopted by them. Unlike statutory rules, which prescribe the prohibited 
conduct, signatories undertake the responsibility for implementing the 
measures that will achieve the goals set out in the Framework. For example, 
mobile phone providers agree to adopt “appropriate” mechanisms to control 
access to illegal or age-inappropriate content. Measures adopted by mobile 
phone providers include the provision of tools and information that enable 
parents to make informed choices on the services and content which can 
be made available to their children. Other measures include the provision 
of filtering solutions and billing control mechanisms. Whilst mobile and 
content providers are provided with flexibility in terms of the classification 
frameworks they adopt, they are, however, encouraged to ensure that the 
standards of review for classifying content are consistent with those pre-
scribed by relevant national legislation and regulations. At a minimum, mo-
bile phone providers are expected to ensure that parents can make informed 
choices regarding their children’s use of mobile phones. The Framework also 
enlists the support of policy makers, trade associations and other organisa-
tions to provide regulatory oversight on the effectiveness and appropriate-
ness of the measures adopted by the mobile phone providers. Safeguards 
are also built into the Framework to ensure that consumers’ privacy and 
freedom to access content are not undermined.15 The protection of chil-
dren’s privacy and the surveillance strategies adopted by online services 
providers including mobile phone operators are areas of governance attract-
ing the attention of child welfare organisations and data protection agen-
cies (Nairn et al., 2009; Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, 2010; 
European Parliament, 2009b, 2010; FTC, 2010a,b). With regard to conduct, 
contact and content risks, mobile providers undertake to adopt or support 
the creation of “notice and take down procedures”, if appropriate legal au-
thorisation is obtained with regard to the removal of illegal content. Finally, 
in addition to the points above, accountability and oversight processes are 
also embedded into the Framework. Safeguarding children is viewed as an 
ongoing process involving in particular the collaboration between mobile 
phone operators, content service providers, law enforcement and parents. An 
annual review process of the measures adopted by individual mobile phone 
providers is undertaken to ensure compliance with obligations assumed 
under the Framework. During the public consultation exercise it was made 
clear that the responsibility for promoting safe use of mobile phones should 
also involve parents, carers and public authorities (European Commission, 
2006a). The integration of these stakeholders into the governance process is 
a clear acknowledgement that good governance involves the participation 
of all stakeholders. Apart from the wider representation this governance 
strategy now makes possible, mobile phone providers are also provided with 
an opportunity to engage in productive dialogue with users and address 
any ongoing or emerging safety concerns in a timely manner. Oversight 
and accountability are achieved in a number of ways. First, the Framework 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

248 Online Child Safety
requires the review process to be undertaken together with European and 
national stakeholders like the European Commission, INHOPE and INSAFE. 
Second, the implementation of the measures by individual Member States in 
the EU is kept under annual review. GSM Europe works with the European 
Commission in monitoring the implementation of the Framework (GSM 
World, 2007). Third, the implementation review reports are published on 
GSM’s website.16 Additionally, the website also has links to national industry 
frameworks and plays an important role in raising awareness of the mobile 
community and the general public to current and emerging online safety 
issues and measures. The development of the Framework is an important 
governance response and there have been three reviews of the perform-
ances of each of the signatories. The latest implementation review covers the 
period January–June 2010. The widespread acceptance of the Framework by 
83 signatory companies across the EU and their implementation in 25 EU 
Member States are welcome developments (GSM Europe, 2010a). In govern-
ance terms, there is in effect an industry network subscribing to safe and re-
sponsible use of mobile phones, which extends to approximately 96 per cent 
of all mobile subscribers in the EU (GSM Europe, 2010b). Since the signing 
of the Framework, there has been a noticeable trend in mobile and content 
providers’ increased willingness to adhere to the obligations assumed under 
the Framework (GSM Europe, 2010b). In the 2009 implementation report, 
many mobile operators have adopted access control and classification sys-
tems (PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2009). For example, 95 per cent of operators 
installed access control mechanisms or were in the process of implementing 
these measures (13 per cent) (ibid., 2009: 2). With regard to classification, 
over 80 per cent of the operators introduced classification systems or had 
policies regulating content accessible to adults only (57 per cent) (ibid.). The 
report also identifies areas where there appears to be a lack of concrete com-
mitments within some national Codes of Practice in relation to discovery of 
illegal child images (as required by clause 14 of the Framework agreement), 
providing customers with mechanisms for reporting concerns (as required 
by clause 6) and reviewing safety standards once developed (as required by 
clause 18).
Some issues are worth exploring. A number of countries appeared to 
comply with clauses relating to access control mechanisms, which included 
age-verification checks at the point of sale or contract but these were not 
consistently implemented. At least 17 operators in the report could not con-
firm that checks were undertaken (GSM Europe, 2010b). The report also 
highlighted the fact that there was no EU-wide regulation that required all 
Member States to ensure that mobile operators and content providers made 
available software, which prevented minors from accessing adult content. 
Countries like the Czech Republic, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Italy and 
the United Kingdom had formal regulations that corresponded with the 
requirements of the Framework (PriceWaterhouseCoopers, 2009: 12). One 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 249
aspect not covered by the Framework related to monitoring the effectiveness 
of the access control mechanisms. Forty-one per cent of the operators indi-
cated that they actively monitored and reviewed the effectiveness of their 
access control mechanisms. Eighty per cent reported that they either moni-
tored the systems or had in place notification systems that enabled prob-
lems to be reported to them. Many operators seemed to be compliant with 
media literacy and awareness raising initiatives (67 per cent) or planned to 
be fully compliant (16 per cent). Some even went beyond the requirements 
of the Framework. Orange UK and Vodafone Czech Republic had been par-
ticularly proactive in raising consumer awareness in respect of a range of 
online safety risks. With regard to mechanisms for reporting complaints 
or child safety incidents, though 28 per cent of the respondents indicated 
that they did not have a designated system for dealing with safety issues, a 
number of them use customer services as a support mechanism. This is not a 
particularly satisfactory response, it should be said. It is in the area of illegal 
content that perhaps concerns are most often raised about industry’s en-
gagement with law enforcement. Even though 28 per cent stated that they 
were non-compliant with clause 13, which required collaboration with law 
enforcement authorities, a number of respondents responded appropriately 
by communicating with INHOPE. The variations in the responses with re-
gard to reporting and blocking or takedown of illegal content can also be 
attributed to differences in national legislation. Finally, the overall impres-
sion of the implementation report was that signatories were adhering to the 
spirit of the Framework, efforts were made to engage and collaborate with 
other stakeholders and codes of practice were kept under review. It should 
also be noted that many of the awareness raising initiatives run by mobile 
operators also reflected contemporary concerns and issues like cyberbully-
ing, “happy-slapping”, theft, illegal file sharing and information security.
A summary can be provided with regard to the third implementation re-
view of the Framework agreement and national implementation reports, 
which were published on June 2010:
(i) Access control mechanisms
The review not only reports that compliance by operators have been high 
but also draws attention to practices that either implement the Framework 
or exceed its standards. For example, Bulgarian operators now restrict mobile 
access to adult content. Access is permitted where age-verification checks 
have been passed (GSM Europe, 2010d: 5). Even where the age-verification 
changes show that the consumer is not a minor, access to adult content is 
only made available through the use of a password. Other access control 
mechanisms involve a screen display showing that content has been blocked 
and the accompanying explanation, the requirement of a pin code to gain 
access to adult or age-inappropriate content and a warning page, with a legal 
disclaimer. The mobile operators in Greece, for example, provide subscribers 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

250 Online Child Safety
with tools by which access control mechanisms can be activated for own-
branded content (GSM Europe, 2010f: 5).
(ii) Classification of commercial content
Classification systems enable subscribers to make informed choices and 
decisions. The activation of access control mechanisms ensures that chil-
dren are not inadvertently exposed to content deemed to be suitable for 
adults only (GSM Europe, 2010f: 6). The operators in Ireland have a more 
robust mobile content classification body (GSM Europe, 2010h: 3). All mo-
bile phone operators are required to enter into a contractual obligation with 
an independent classification body. The remit of this body is to develop a 
framework for classifying commercial content, which is deemed to be un-
suitable for minors. Additionally, mobile phone operators are required to 
ensure that the classification framework adopted by them is consistent with 
the standard of review used in other media; the parties undertake to treat 
content as age restricted where a similar classification has been adopted in 
other media like magazines, films, video and computer games (GSM Europe, 
2010h: 10–11).
(iii) Raising awareness and education
In contrast to the second implementation review, there have been greater 
resources directed at raising awareness and providing parents with relevant 
information and support. In a number of countries, mobile phone opera-
tors engage directly with children and schools. Others, like the Latvian mo-
bile phone operators, collaborate with NGOs in disseminating information 
about safe and responsible use of mobile phones (GSM Europe, 2010i: 2–4). 
The mobile operators in the United Kingdom work closely with organisa-
tions like CEOP and the NSPCC (GSM Europe, 2010j). All mobile operators 
(with the exception of 3UK) in the United Kingdom are involved in the de-
velopment of the Teachtoday website. This portal serves to educate teachers, 
head teachers, governors and other staff about the Internet and its commu-
nication technologies.
(iv) Fighting illegal content on mobile Internet networks
Mobile phone operators with Internet connectivity rely on the list compiled 
by the IWF to block websites hosting illegal content. In the United Kingdom, 
all mobile operators use this blocklist to prevent inadvertent access to il-
legal child abuse content (GSM Europe, 2010j: 12). Mobile phone operators 
tend to comply with legally authorised “notice and take down” requests 
and block access to websites that are on the IWF list of sites hosting illegal 
content like child abuse, racist and obscene images. The mobile operators 
in Slovakia work closely with government authorities, the national safer 
Internet node and NGOs to eliminate illegal child sexual abuse media and 
undertake to facilitate the reporting of such content (GSM Europe, 2010k: 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 251
10). Many operators have also used the Framework to further enhance their 
efforts in promoting children’s safe use of mobile phones. These include 
monitoring and verifying that national Codes of Practice are being imple-
mented, particularly where new products and services have been introduced 
into the market (GSM Europe, 2010g: 9, 16), ensuring that marketing ac-
tivities directed against minors adhere to consumer protection guidelines 
(GSM Europe, 2010h: 24) and promote transparency in the provision of mo-
bile services (GSM Europe, 2010i: 13).
In relation to clause 18, which deals with feedback from stakeholders, the 
prospects look good in relation to the continued role of the Framework as a 
review mechanism. The Hungarian Branch of the International Children’s 
Safety Service whilst commending the efforts made by the mobile opera-
tors in addressing the safety issues, highlighted the need for greater efforts 
to be directed in promoting media awareness of the safety issues and in-
formation literacy (GSM Europe, 2010g: 15). John Carr, from the United 
Kingdom, noted that mobile phone operators needed to address the privacy 
issues raised by the provision of location-based services software for mobile 
phones (GSM Europe, 2010j: 14). He also pointed out that in the United 
Kingdom, bullying through mobile phones was still an area of concern but 
felt that mobile phone operators had been particularly responsive to chil-
dren and parent anxiety. The stakeholder for Bulgaria acknowledged that 
its mobile operators were responsive to the safety concerns of children. It 
was suggested however that mobile operators in this country still needed 
to promote public awareness of online child safety through campaigns and 
education, by participating in co-funding safer Internet initiatives and by 
improving compliance efforts (GSM Europe, 2010j: 14).
In summary, the 2007 European Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Younger 
Teenagers and Children prescribes a set of principles governing mobile 
phone operators and content providers’ relationship with children and 
their parents. They are also expected to work with other stakeholders, in-
cluding child protection organisations, with the aim of promoting the 
safety of children and young persons. There are clear obligations imposed 
on mobile phone and content providers to regulate children’s access to 
content. These providers are expected to support classification frame-
works for commercial content based on applicable national standards and 
rules. Classification of content, whether accessible through telecommu-
nications or not, are required to be consistent with national standards 
regarding decency, appropriateness and legislation. Mobile providers 
are expected to work closely with law enforcement in dealing with il-
legal content (e.g. child sexual abuse images) and are expected to alert 
INHOPE or equivalent authorities when they encounter such content. In 
supporting the efforts of law enforcement, mobile phone providers are 
encouraged to support legally authorised “notice and take down” requests. 
With regard to parental concerns about children’s access to inappropriate

content, the Framework is sufficiently flexible in permitting signatories to 
introduce measures that cater for individual and cultural needs.
MSIG model case study 2: Social networking sites
In 2008, the Home Office Task Force comprising key organisations from 
the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia produced a Good 
Practice Guidance for Providers of Social Networking and Other User Interactive 
Services 2008 (Home Office, 2008). This document was the product of the 
collaborative efforts of government, industry, children’s charities and vol-
untary groups and the law enforcement authority. A similar approach to-
wards developing a unified response to the child safety issues raised by 
emerging interactive services can also be seen in the United States. Some 
of the measures identified in the ISTTF’s Final Report with regard to en-
hancing the safety of children in the online environment provide a useful 
background to understanding the rationale and objectives of the EU Safer 
Social Networking Principles (SSNP) (ISSTF, 2008: Appendix A). The Joint 
Statement on Key Principles of Social Networking Safety identified four areas for 
coordinated action by social networking sites and its stakeholders: (i) the 
allocation of adequate resources to facilitate the continued development of 
online safety tools that are accessible and effective, including online iden-
tity authentication technologies; (ii) the design of safety features on web-
sites so that children's exposure to inappropriate contact and content are 
minimised; (iii) raising awareness about safe and responsible use of online 
services and technologies; (iv) continued cooperation and collaboration 
with law enforcement authorities (ISSTF, 2008: Appendix A, 2–3).
In 2008, the European Commission convened some of Europe’s major 
social networks as well as researchers and child welfare organisations to 
form a European Social Networking Task Force to discuss guidelines for the 
use of social networking sites by children. On 10 February 2009, follow-
ing a public consultation exercise and the setting up of a European Social 
Networking Task Force, a document outlining the governance principles for 
social networking sites provided the basis for an agreement. Twenty of the 
main providers of social networking services signed the agreement, known 
as the Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU (European Commission, 
2009d, 2010d; Table 6.8).
Like the Framework agreement on mobile phones, social network service 
providers undertake to implement reasonable and appropriate measures to 
enhance the safety of children. These obligations are couched in general 
principles, which do not differ in any fundamental respect from the recom-
mendations we have seen in policy reviews undertaken by the Home Office 
and the ISTTF (Table 6.9).
On 9 February 2010, during the Safer Internet Day, the European 
Commission presented the findings of an independent assessment of the 
implementation of the SSNP for the EU. The report is in two parts: Part I and 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu


254 Online Child Safety
Signatories undertake to raise awareness of safety education messages and 
acceptable use policies to users, parents, teachers and carers in a prominent, 
clear and age-appropriate manner. It is important to recognise the rationale 
of this objective, namely, to enable individuals make informed choices 
about the product and services made available on the social networking 
site. The focus on promoting awareness and information literacy is based 
on the premise that risks encountered by children may be causally linked 
to the lack of relevant and accessible information. The emphasis on social 
networking site providers’ obligation to make relevant and accessible infor-
mation available clearly places the onus on them to ensure that their users 
clearly understand the safety and risk management issues. The guidance 
provided in the SSNP mirrors some of the key recommendations made in 
the Home Office Task Force document, namely, those relating to signpost-
ing information about the services and online safety resources in a clear 
and accessible manner and that these are appropriate for various age groups 
between the 13- and 18-years-old category. The reference to providing infor-
mation in a clear and accessible manner should lead to many sites now using 
videos and other media to communicate safety information in a clear and 
effective manner. Under the SSNP, site providers also undertake to clarify 
the boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable behaviour in a way that 
young users can understand.
Principle 2: Work towards ensuring that services are age-appropriate for the 
intended audience.
Compliance with the obligations under this principle aims to address 3 spe-
cific governance challenges: minimise risks of minors accessing age-inap-
propriate content and services, ensuring that underage users do not register 
as users and empowering users. The principle first of all aims to ensure that 
children do not encounter or access age-inappropriate information. Users 
with accounts on social networking sites can access content in a number of 
ways: search directory under the classification categories of interests, users 
within the peer group posting links and photos of inappropriate content. 
Concerns about exposure to inappropriate contact are now addressed at the 
design stage and include the use of default settings to ensure that adults 
do not discover the profiles of users below the age of 18 years through a 
public search directory. Other measures to enhance the safety of children 
on social networking sites comprise those which exclude certain adult or 
age-inappropriate categories from search directories on the sites (i.e. status 
of relationships, body type, orientation and height). In relation to prevent-
ing children from accessing inappropriate content, filtering software (i.e. 
hashing technology) can be used to ensure that children do not upload 
or distribute inappropriate images. Other design solutions include the use 
of blocking technology to prevent minors from accessing age-inappropriate 
advertisements relating to tobacco, alcohol and general classified advertise-
ments intended for an adult audience.

Principles 3, 4 and 6: Empower users through tools and technology; Provide 
easy-to-use mechanisms to report conduct or content that violates the Terms of 
Service; and Enable and encourage users to employ a safe approach to personal 
information and privacy.
There is a degree of overlap between these three principles and those 
considered earlier. The safety objectives in promoting children’s aware-
ness of online risks resulting from engaging with electronic data can be 
further enhanced if tools are also made available to enable children to man-
age online safety incidents in an appropriate manner. Subscribers to the 
SSNP undertake to make available tools to block strangers from contacting 
them, facilitate identity verification for “friend” requests, prevent tagging 
of personal photos, provide greater control over user-generated content and 
empower users to define their audiences (Table 6.10).

256 Online Child Safety
With regard to contact risks, site providers undertake to adopt measures 
that minimise the risks of children being conducted by adults. As noted 
above, the guidance advocates the use of educational material and techno-
logical tools to enable children to maximise the developmental opportun-
ities as well as managing content, contact and conduct risks. Additionally, 
reporting mechanisms and processes for quick responses to complaints 
and concerns can enhance trust and confidence amongst users, parents 
and educators. Many of the solutions implemented in response to the com-
mitments under the SSNP have also been the subject of previous SIP ini-
tiatives (European Commission, 2009a,b). Recently, Facebook launched its 
social reporting facility enabling users to report inappropriate behaviour or 
misuse of content to their friends (Facebook, 2011). These initiatives will in-
creasingly be regarded by others in the industry as setting the benchmarks 
for good governance.
Principles 5 and 7: Respond to notifications of Illegal content or conduct and 
Assess the means for reviewing illegal or prohibited content/conduct
Children and parents will have confidence in managing online safety 
incidents and risks if they can also rely on timely responses to reports of 
illegal content or online safety incidents. The obligation under principle 5 
is informed by the rationale that expeditious investigation of notifications 
of illegal content or abusive conduct can be an effective response in man-
aging and responding to users’ concerns about their safety and well-being. 
The provisions dealing with furthering collaboration with law enforcement 
ensures that potential threats to child victims, where online grooming is 
concerned, can be eradicated and offenders prosecuted. The guidance docu-
ment also offers some practical examples of implementing the moderation 
and review processes. To this end, the work undertaken by the Home Office 
Internet Task Force in 2005 – Good practice guidance for the moderation of 
interactive services for children – is regarded as providing a standard setting 
framework for social networking site providers (Home Office, 2005) (see 
later discussion on “Media Literacy”). Many social networking site provid-
ers demonstrate compliance by using human and/or automated moderated 
tools, filtering software and user-generated reports.
The seven principles under the SSNP provide a framework which allows in-
dividual social networking services providers to address the trust deficit and 
online safety issues that may arise when children access and use their serv-
ices. As discussed in earlier chapters, network publics and the affordances 
provided by new technologies create numerous opportunities for misuse. 
One advantage in having these principles is that they provide a benchmark 
against which social networking services providers’ compliance with these 
obligations can be evaluated. Additionally, the SSNP also provides a flex-
ible governance framework since it allows individual social networking sites 
the opportunity to assess which safety measures are reasonable, appropriate 
and even necessary. For example, sites like YouTube, Flickr and Dailymotion 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Online Child Safety, Civil Society and the Private Sector 257
are essentially communication platforms for users to upload or watch con-
tent like videos and photographs and consequently require reporting and 
design solutions. By way of contrast, Club Penguin and Barbiegirls.com are 
designated sites for children, which may require extensive use of moder-
ating, filtering and age-verification solutions and regular risk assessment 
reports.
Findings of an independent assessment of the implementation of the Safer Social 
Networking Principles for the EU
Subscription to the SSNP in itself will not enhance the safety of children 
or promote trust and confidence in social networking sites. It is important 
that site providers view online child safety governance as an ongoing pro-
cess. Consequently, a mechanism is needed to ensure that subscribers to the 
SSNP are in effect clear as to their obligations – that they continue to take 
reasonable and appropriate measures to safeguard children on their social 
networking sites and have in place mechanisms for reviewing the effective-
ness of their online child safety policies and measures. One way by which 
the EU ensures compliance with the obligations under the SSNP is through 
the conduct of a periodic review. The findings from the periodic review are 
published by the European Commission in a report made available on the 
EU SIP website (Staksrud et al., 2010). In preparing the report, a group of na-
tional researchers, hired by the Commission, visited the sites and assumed 
the role of fictional children aged 11 and 15 years. The information obtained 
by the researchers included those aspects relevant to safeguarding children 
from contact, content and conduct risks: the location of safety information; 
the accessibility of the information and whether it could be easily com-
prehended by a child; empowerment tools like blocking users or declining 
a friend request; pre-approval features for postings of pictures, posts and 
comments on a profile; privacy settings; and the ease with which profiles 
and information of minors on the sites were discoverable on the search dir-
ectory. In addition to this, the researchers also sent a request to the site with 
the aim of assessing the quality and speediness of the response. Twenty-five 
websites were tested, and these included Arto, Bebo, Dailymotion, Facebook, 
YouTube, Xbox Live, Windows Live, MySpace, Piczo, Habbo Hotel, Yahoo! 
Answers and Yahoo!Flickr. Table 6.11 highlights whether the sites are “par-
tially compliant”, “compliant”, “not compliant” or were not tested in rela-
tion to the seven principles under the SSNP.
The Report found that many of the services provided safety informa-
tion for all users, minors, parents and educators (ibid., 2010: 19). The in-
formation provided varied from textual content to audio, photographs and 
video. Generally, the safety and privacy information was easily located, 
with some service providers being particularly proactive whilst in a small 
number of cases the “terms of service” were not easily discovered. However, 
in the case of 15 service providers, information for teachers was unavail-
able. Eleven sites provided information to teenagers that were accessible and

comprehensible; it was felt that more effort was needed to provide young 
children with directed information on risk prevention measures and report-
ing mechanisms (ibid., 2010: 20–1). The Report does not make clear what 
age groups came within the category of “children” and “teens”. In relation 
to the information relating to online risks, most sites provided information 
about online bullying, hate speech, risks associated with divulging personal 
information and dangers of posting inappropriate or suggestive photo-
graphs on profile pages. From the sites tested, it was particularly noticeable 
that a number of service providers had very little or no information about 
the risks posed by sexual solicitation by adults, self-harm and illegal child 
images (ibid., 2010: 22). YouTube was seen as an example of good practice 
in relation to providing easy access to all relevant safety information. Sites 
like Habbo Hotel, Hyves, MySpace, YouTube and Zap provided safety infor-
mation regarded as being accessible to children. Principle 2, which deals 
with age-appropriate services, was regarded as being implemented by most 
services, with information stipulating the age requirements for accessing 
services (ibid., 2010: 24). Many sites used technical and legal mechanisms to 
restrict minors’ access to age-inappropriate information. The reviewers felt 
that more effort could have been made in providing parents with access to 
technological control tools on these sites (ibid., 2010: 25). Age verification 
and authentication of the identity of those registering on social networking 
sites continue to pose a challenge. In a recent survey by Consumer Reports, 
2011 State of the Net Survey, it was found that 7.5 million out of 20 million 
minors from the United States with Facebook accounts were below the age 
of 13 years (Consumer Reports, 2011). Facebook’s registration policy states 
that users must be at least 13 years old. This social networking site provider 
is alleged to remove at least 20,000 underage users each day (Smith, 2011). 
At a hearing before the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety, Facebook 
indicated that it was making considerable efforts in removing underage 
minors on its Australian sites (ABC News, 2011). This is an issue addressed in 
the report made by the examiners under the SSNP. It was reported that out 
of the 20 sites examined, seven applications were registered without email 
verification. In relation to three service providers, which were restricted to 
minors below 11 years of age, sign up was refused, with 17 service providers 
indicating that the refusal was due to age restrictions. The researchers used 
fictional birthday dates to re-register onto sites (i.e. indicating that the child 
was much older) where registration was previously refused on the grounds 
of age restriction. In seven instances, registration was approved by a simple 
change of the birthday date or age (ibid., 2010: 26). Sites like Bebo, Facebook, 
Microsoft XBOX Live and MySpace were held to have effective measures 
implementing age-restriction controls. The researchers found that principle 
3 was not fully implemented by the sites tested. Even though many sites 
made available privacy and related information control settings, the fact that 
these were not set as default meant that some personal information was still

260 Online Child Safety
visible to users and information of minors was still discoverable in user and 
general public directories (ibid., 2010: 27–8). Users in some instances could 
easily post comments on a profile whilst other sites had in place pre-ap-
proval/moderating tools (ibid., 2010: 29). That said, many services provided 
tools which allowed users to delete or remove postings and photographs on 
their own profile. A number of sites provided an alert service to users, noti-
fying them when a picture containing them had been tagged on other peo-
ple’s profiles (ibid., 2010: 31). It seems that sites like Facebook and Myspace 
have made some progress in addressing the requirements under this prin-
ciple. To assess whether the sites tested took users safety concerns seriously, 
the researchers sent the following message: “I am writing to you because 
someone is sending me scary messages. What should I do about this? Please 
help me” (ibid., 2010: 32). The message was sent from the registered profile 
of both a fictional 11-year-old and a 15-year-old child. The lack of an ef-
fective response from the sites could be explained by the fact that most sites 
have a pre-determined procedure for processing assistance and prescribe the 
type of concerns and likely risk management steps to be taken (e.g. bullying, 
grooming, harassment and illegal content). The researchers expressed dis-
appointment that in a number of cases no acknowledgement to the request 
was received. Where links for reporting mechanisms were made available 
on sites it was found that response times varied from 24 hours to one week. 
Thirteen sites did not reply to the message requesting assistance while seven 
responded within 7 hours (ibid., 2010: 33). Google (YouTube), Myspace and 
Microsoft were regarded as examples of best practice in relation to respond-
ing to the underage user. ARTO, Bebo and Facebook were some of the sites 
deemed to have appropriate report mechanisms and found to acknowledge 
reports sent by users (Staksrud et al., 2010: 34). Anecdotal accounts of re-
sponse times suggest that more effort needs to be made by social networking 
site providers in this area. Generally, attempts to ascertain the response and 
reaction times to notices are important since a failure to address concerns 
promptly can often lead to minors being left without support during the in-
terim. Returning to the implementation report, for ethical reasons principle 
5 could not be evaluated, and the researchers could not submit reports of 
illegal content and conduct. Many sites appear to have encouraged users to 
adopt a safe use approach to personal information (principle 6) (ibid., 2010: 
36). Users could use tools to alter their privacy settings and were provided 
information which enabled them to make informed choices and decisions 
about the information they made available about themselves or posted on-
line (ibid., 2010: 37). Bebo, MySpace, Habbo and IRC Galleria were identi-
fied as having exemplary practices. The report noted that more could still 
be done by social networking site providers in publicising how users could 
terminate their accounts (ibid., 2010: 38–9). Finally the researchers relied on 
the self-declarations in establishing the sites implementing principle 7 (as 
was the case for principle 5), owing to ethical considerations.

Both case studies illustrate how the responses of online intermediaries 
and content service providers can help inform and define the way risks are 
identified, processed and managed. The implementation reports also high-
light some unique aspects of online child safety governance. For example, 
the participation of researchers and experts in using social networking sites 
draws attention to the prudential measures that can be adopted at the net-
work, design and educational levels. Within the context of risk assessment 
and management, the findings from the Framework and the SSNP implemen-
tation reviews also illustrate the benefits in providing regulatory oversight 
in the form of “testing” and engagement with the principal stakeholders 
(e.g. children, parents and educators). The fact that great strides have been 
made by mobile phone operators and providers of social networking serv-
ices, for example, in developing technical solutions and communicating the 
online safety risks to parents and children is in part the result of regulatory 
pressure and efforts made by NGOs in highlighting concerns about risks 
associated with these products and services.
Conclusion
This chapter has provided one way of approaching and understanding the 
MSIG framework comprising the State, the private sector and civil society. 
The complexity introduced by the transnational nature of online risks and 
the nature of Internet communication infrastructures necessitates the adop-
tion of flexible and reflexive regulatory strategies that operate at different 
levels and contexts. The use of Beck’s ideas also illustrates how the manage-
ment of risks and the processes for deliberation and participation become 
an important focal point of civil society activism and government concern. 
Increasingly, it seems likely that it is through these interactions that meas-
ures to assess, manage and communicate risks will be identified and inform 
governance policies and strategies. The two case studies illustrate the role 
of the EU in advancing the MSIG model for online child safety. These case 
studies also underscore Beck’s conception of the risk society, particularly in 
view of the complexity in managing convergence and the processes for risk 
management, deliberation and participation involving civil society, industry 
and policymakers. Convergence in technology and social media implicates 
intermediaries who are deemed to be carriers and distributors of illegal con-
tent and these problems will have to be confronted at some stage in the 
immediate future. The “contamination” of the carrier model by those who 
engage in child sexual abuse and commercial exploitation has blurred the 
boundaries between telecommunication and child protection policies on 
the one hand and on the other hand has made domestic and international 
policymaking dependent on the integration of civil society and industry 
into the process of identifying and implementing sustainable solutions 
(Wu, 2004). It is unclear whether the EU and civil society organisations will

continue to accept the age-verification problems or poor responsive times 
as either inevitable or a cost to be borne by minors. The reports furnished 
under the Framework and the SSNP should be cross-referenced with add-
itional findings and reports undertaken in other jurisdictions. It is true that 
the proceduralisation of risk through the development of the Framework 
and SSNP enables policymakers to engage fully with online service provid-
ers and draw on the resources of NGOs who have shown a commitment 
towards undertaking comprehensive scrutiny of risk management processes 
and decisions. There are, however, dangers, particularly in relation to NGO 
involvement in this area of governance that the boundaries between argu-
ments relating to manageable risks and uncertainty can become blurred as a 
consequence. This minor criticism should not detract from the useful con-
tributions made by NGOs in ensuring that the deliberative processes retain 
their democratic credentials. Even though the issues and questions posed 
to both mobile phone and social networking site providers broadly reflect 
the concerns raised by parents and children in the EU, it is fair to say that 
the findings from the two case studies also resonate very much with the 
thrust of current policymakers’ thinking about online child safety govern-
ance in the United States, Canada and Australia. Whilst the issues chosen 
for analysis have been selective, this should not distract us from the central 
message that runs across this book and more importantly which formed the 
focus of this chapter, namely, that without engaging all stakeholders, any 
enterprise aiming to enhance the safety of children in a system that recycles 
risk will prove to be futile and the gains illusory.

Overview
As Web 2.0 technologies and social media become an integral part of chil-
dren’s lives, media literacy is emerging as an invaluable policy response, par-
ticularly for safeguarding children in the online environment (Livingstone, 
2004a,b: 5; Prensky, 2001; cf. NCTE 1975). Targeting media literacy measures 
at children is not new. Before the Internet, educational and media aware-
ness initiatives were relied upon to inculcate in children critical literacy 
skills (Gill, 2007:18–38; Megee, 1997). Media literacy initiatives were also 
seen as helping counteract the negative developmental and psychological 
effects of television programmes and commercial advertising on children 
(Buckingham, 2007: 84–6; Nathanson, 2004). An important premise in 
media literacy policies is that individuals who do not have access to rele-
vant information will be least equipped in managing Web 2.0 technologies 
and online safety incidents in a safe and responsible manner (Rideout et 
al., 2007). This intuition is broadly correct, as is reflected in the import-
ance attached by the European Commission, mobile phone and social net-
working services providers in educating users, children and parents on the 
online safety and security issues (European Commission, 2011b; ECDG, 
2009). This chapter is primarily concerned with understanding the role of 
media literacy with regard to online child safety governance; it emphasises 
some of its key features within the context of converging information and 
social media communication platforms and network publics which have 
practical governance and regulatory implications. Whilst accepting the 
value of informed decision-making as a child protection strategy, the cen-
tral argument pursued in this chapter is that youth culture, network pub-
lics, the affordances of information flows and digital information introduce 
new complications that policymakers cannot ignore. Indeed, the idea that 
media literacy empowers children to better manage online risks should not 
disguise the fact that often it is not the lack of information about Internet 
threats but poor decision-making skills and the absence of ethical norms

that lie at the root of some of the online child safety governance issues 
(James et al., 2008; Thornburgh et al., 2002: 12–13). Recognition of this fea-
ture has important implications for what we can and should expect from 
media literacy programmes (Byrne, 2009).
Preliminary observations
Byron stressed the importance of incorporating media literacy activities 
into policies for enhancing the safety of children in the online environ-
ment (Byron, 2008: 108). Many will agree with this recommendation 
(Buckingham et al., 2007; Burroughs et al., 2009; Eurobarometer, 2007; 
European Commission, 2010c). Children’s exposure to risk-prone activities 
like interactions on social networking sites, emails, virtual worlds and mo-
bile phones introduces a qualitative aspect to the issues online safety educa-
tion and awareness campaigns are meant to address (Byron, 2010). Online 
safety education is now provided to all children across the world where 
Internet connectivity is available (Aqili et al., 2010).
Balancing children’s newfound autonomy with concerns about their 
safety and well-being is a source of considerable tension at home and 
schools where Internet access is available (Castells et al., 2007; Palfrey et al., 
2008; Butterfield, 2010). New technologies, for example, now make chil-
dren’s online activities and interactions less amenable to supervision by par-
ents (Livingstone et al., 2011). Parents and educators are rightly concerned 
about children’s inadvertent exposure to age-inappropriate and harmful 
content (ITU, 2009b; Lenhart et al., 2007b; Hargrave, 2009; Council of the 
European Union, 2009a). Some regard these tensions as emblematic of con-
structions of childhood, where “the child at risk stems from adults’ sense 
of exclusion from children’s digital culture ... [since in] this context, adults 
may experience a sense of losing control, and for understandable reasons” 
(Buckingham, 2007: 85). It is also an observation that illustrates the implica-
tions of living in the risk society for parents, educators and children:
Individualization within modernity entails the almost constant monitor-
ing of risk, which pervades our sense of how to manage ourselves and the 
world. Risks may be produced by social conditions, but we are expected 
to assess and manage them as individuals ... Risks to children are repre-
sented as inherently more grave than risks to adults: it is almost beyond 
debate that we should “protect” children, that any potential risk to chil-
dren should be taken very seriously. As adults we can decide to take risks, 
or to balance risk against pleasure. (Jackson et al., 1999: 88–90)
These views of childhood, autonomy and safety warrant a close examin-
ation of media literacy, as it has obvious implications for our expectations 
of its role and limits within the MSIG framework.

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 265
Media literacy and the discourse on empowerment
What is media literacy?
Media literacy has been described as “the ability to access, understand 
and create communications in a variety of contexts” (OfCom, 2006: 6). 
There are other conceptions of media literacy. The Learning and Teaching 
Scotland Department regards media literacy as incorporating informa-
tion literacy and lifelong skills.1 The Audiovisual Media Services Directive 
adopts a broader view of the concept, which includes “skills, knowledge and 
understanding that allow consumers to use media effectively and safely” 
(European Commission, 2007a: recital 47). More recently, the Commission 
described the ability to access the media in a variety of contexts as im-
portant skills for engaging with Web 2.0 technologies and digital media 
(European Commission, 2007b). O’Neill and Hagen place particular em-
phasis on informed decision-making as an important goal of digital media 
literacy. They suggest that the focus on the “digital” dimension is more ap-
propriate, given children’s disposition towards technological affordances in 
the networked environment. Accordingly, as active participants, children 
“should be equipped with the necessary critical and conceptual tools that 
allow them to deal with, rather than be protected from the media culture 
that surrounds them” (O’Neill et al., 2009: 230). Media literacy has also be-
come a catchphrase for celebrating children’s new autonomy and freedom 
in the age of information networks. Others herald a new phase of citizen-
ship and institutional affirmation of children’s rights in the evolving EU 
constitutional landscape. Media literacy complements the Commission’s 
Agenda for the Rights of the Child in terms of its developmental and partici-
patory potential (European Commission, 2011b: 11). It is a view that has 
been endorsed by Viviane Reding, who regards media literacy as critical 
“for achieving full and active citizenship”.2 It has recently been suggested 
that media literacy embodies a set of functional, critical and social com-
petences (Sonck et al., 2011: 2). These attempts in defining media literacy 
are consistent with approaches by theorists who attempt to construct the 
concept in terms of its participatory, cultural, developmental or protective 
value. Livingstone suggests that media literacy, if it is to have any substance 
or normative content, must involve more than providing individuals with 
access to content – she attaches particular importance to individuals being 
provided with the necessary evaluative and analytical tools that will enable 
them to engage critically with information in its various forms and con-
texts (Livingstone, 2003a). It is not the aim here to map the varying senses 
in which media literacy is understood or attempt to suggest why one def-
inition may be preferable to another. Livingstone’s observations, however, 
merit elaboration in terms of the four functions media literacy is meant to 
serve within the context of children’s behaviours and activities regarded 
as risk-prone (Livingstone, 2005b: 6). First, literacy is regarded as enabling 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

266 Online Child Safety
individuals to gain access to the technologies, information and online serv-
ices. Second, adopting a critical stance towards the content will appreciably 
enhance the individual’s engagement with Web 2.0 technologies and con-
tent. Third, individuals will become active participants in their interaction 
with digital content and technologies. Fourth, though not made explicit, 
individuals will be able to respond to the cultural and ethical challenges 
resulting from participation in network publics.
If the Internet, as some seem to assume, does nothing more than blend 
“old” media into “new” ways of communicating and interacting, then 
the apparent or perceived qualitative differences are perhaps distinctions 
without a difference (Penman et al., 2007). This is not the case in reality, 
since informed decision-making and managing risk-prone activities place 
additional demands on participants in network publics as well as the private 
sector who are the primary providers of the technology and services that 
children now consume (Livingstone et al., 2011: 45–8; Fox, 2008; Ofsted, 
2010). As many observers of network publics have long commented, techno-
logical affordances also require individuals to take into account the reaction 
of visible and invisible audiences to their actions and conduct (Ito et al., 
2008; Hinduja et al., 2008).
Web 2.0, media literacy and public policy objectives
The role of government is particularly important in ensuring that online 
child safety remains an important priority in the governance agenda. As 
countries continue to develop their human and technical infrastructure in 
the digital economy, promoting trust and confidence is seen as playing a 
critical role in national strategies for competitive growth and nation build-
ing (OECD, 2010a: 42; DCMS, 2009: 169–73). There is growing consensus 
that informational illiteracy can undermine the ability of individuals to en-
gage fully with the Internet and reduce the range of cultural, social and eco-
nomic opportunities the networked society makes possible (ACMA, 2009a: 
29; DCMS, 2009: 189–90). This trend towards embedding media literacy 
in national programmes, as noted previously, is evident in many OECD 
economies. Countries have embarked on education and awareness raising 
campaigns (ACMA, 2009a,b; Fujino, 2009, 2007). ACMA, in its review of 
international developments in broadband and communication policy, com-
mented on the significance of the interaction between media literacy, in-
formation security and a country’s competitiveness (ACMA, 2009a: 29–30, 
40). ACMA has undertaken a number of media literacy programmes aimed 
at shaping national policy interventions and regulations for the digital 
economy. Some of its initiatives include the promotion of young persons’ 
use of Web 2.0 technologies and social media, promoting safe and respon-
sible use of digital media and raising general awareness of ICT competences 
and skills (ACMA, 2007, 2009a,b, 2010a). Between 6 and 11 June 2010, 
ACMA hosted a national online security awareness week for all Australians,

including children.3 On 10 May 10 2010, Canada launched a public consult-
ation aimed at formulating a digital economy strategy for Canada.4 A task 
force involving multiple stakeholders will be vested with the responsibility 
for creating a National Digital Literacy Strategy. The National Broadband 
Plan for Connecting America views the development of digital literacy skills 
as a condition precedent for integrating Americans fully into the digital 
economy. These ideas and themes resonate much with the current direction 
in online child safety governance. The OSTWG published its final report 
and emphasised the value of a MSIG strategy towards online safety and 
literacy (OSTWG, 2010: 5). In the United Kingdom, OfCom, which oper-
ates under the authority granted by the Communications Act 2003 to regu-
late the broadcasting and communications sector, is of a similar mind. It 
works with a number of stakeholders from the private and public sector, as 
well as government departments and not-for-profit organisations, in pro-
moting media literacy initiatives in the United Kingdom. The European 
Commission has also been instrumental in driving media literacy policies. 
In 2010, the Commission published its Communication, A Digital Agenda 
for Europe, where the promotion of trust and confidence amongst its citi-
zens was seen as part of a broader strategy towards empowering individuals 
and enabling them to take advantage of the various opportunities provided 
by the digital economy (European Commission, 2010a: 24–5, 2010c,f). The 
Commission has also spearheaded a series of media literacy initiatives, one of 
which includes empowering children and minors in their use of the Internet 
and communication tools appropriately and safely (European Commission, 
2009c). In the report published by the Commission, media literacy was seen 
as having an instrumental role, not least in developing the “critical capaci-
ties” of children and young persons in relation to their use of the Internet 
and communication technologies in all areas of their lives (2009c: 86). In 
the remainder of this chapter, an attempt will be made to describe some of 
the strategies for implementing media literacy policies.
The logic of information flows, media literacy and 
online child safety
Online child safety education and awareness raising initiatives are now 
firmly grounded in national, regional and supranational fora. On 13 
November 2008, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced the 
setting up of the International Telecommunication Union’s Child Online 
Protection (COP) initiative (ITU, 2008b). The COP initiative brings together 
stakeholders from the private and public sector, including UNICEF, the UN 
Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and the UN Institute for 
Disarmament Research. Raising awareness and capacity building are seen 
as critical to promoting and sustaining a culture of safe and responsible 
use of the Internet. The Tunis Commitment affirmed the indivisibility of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

268 Online Child Safety
human rights and regarded access to ICT, information and capacity build-
ing as key to creating an inclusive information society (WSIS, 2005). This 
Commitment has the broad support of governments, the private sector, 
civil society and international organisations in working towards imple-
menting the undertakings set out in the Geneva Declaration of Principles and 
Plan of Action.
There are two models which are used to promote online safety education. 
The first is the “protection/precaution” model, which focuses on the con-
tact, content and conduct risks and the measures to be taken in minimis-
ing exposure to these (Penman et al., 2007). It is quite common in such a 
model for a prescriptive approach to be taken in managing children’s access 
to and use of Web 2.0 technologies (e.g. “acceptable use policies” relating 
to ICT use, technological and design solutions and online safety awareness 
instruction). The emphasis here is on reinforcing the rules for safe and re-
sponsible use of Web 2.0 technologies and digital media. The COP initiative, 
for example, advocates greater parental and educator oversight in managing 
the online activities of very young children. Strategies include communi-
cating the rules for accessing the Internet and utilisation of technological 
safety tools. For older age groups, it is more common to see online safety 
education programmes which adopt the “precaution/evaluative” model. 
Online safety education programmes targeting this age group aim to strike 
a balance between reinforcing protective risk management measures and 
encouraging reflective skills and values; children, educators and schools are 
seen as part of the “whole school” approach towards promoting safe and re-
sponsible use of  communication technologies (Ofsted, 2010; OSTWG, 2010; 
ACMA 2009a,b). This model also attaches particular importance to building 
citizenship and resilience values (see “information security” discussion). A 
variant of the “precaution/evaluative” model is the “child-centric” govern-
ance model that defines the issues to be addressed by parents and educators 
for the age groups 5–7, 8–12 and 13 and above (ITU, 2009b). The guidelines 
deal with strategies and measures that can be adapted to deal with the cul-
tural and developmental needs of children and young people. Broadly, on-
line safety education measures adopted in jurisdictions where children are 
exposed to Web 2.0 technologies strive to uphold the UNCRC and the Tunis 
Commitment regarding the “the role of ICTs in the protection of children 
and in enhancing the development of children” as well as taking steps to 
“strengthen action to protect children from abuse and defend their rights in 
the context of ICTs” (WSIS, 2005: paragraph 24).
Framing the governance challenge for media literacy
It goes without saying that governance strategies and measures aim to en-
sure that children, parents and educators possess functional, information 
security and risk management competences. The qualitative dimension of 
the risks and the nature of digital information have practical implications 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 269
for the delivery of media literacy programmes (ITU, 2009b,c). For example, 
as a result of Web 2.0 technologies being readily accessible and ubiquitous, 
we cannot view safety and security simply in terms of securing and moni-
toring physical spaces inhabited by children, since information flows now 
make possible for risks to be encountered in various contexts (e.g. home, 
school, virtual worlds, and social networking sites) and at different levels in 
the network infrastructure (e.g. game consoles, mobile phones and Internet) 
(Livingstone et al., 2011: 51–2). Consequently, one objective of media lit-
eracy must be to help children make informed decisions about how online 
safety incidents are to be identified and managed. Another objective would 
be to educate children to realise that seeking appropriate assistance from 
responsible adults when needed is a legitimate option. Too often, anecdotal 
evidence suggests that children are fearful of reporting concerns and online 
safety incidents to parents and educators. In short, media literacy measures 
need to accommodate the nuances of engaging with youth culture, digital 
media and Web 2.0 technologies, particularly as mobile computing and in-
formation networks already create considerable challenges for online ser-
vice providers, ISPs and parents in acting as “digital gatekeepers” (Hersh, 
2001). Online monitoring tools and software are far from being infallible 
(European Commission, 2011a). In a recent study released by the European 
Commission under the SIP, it was found that a number of filtering software 
and parental control tools were less than effective on social networking sites 
and blogs (European Commission, 2011a). The study also reported that only 
25 per cent of parents employed content regulation software. Other find-
ings included the shortcomings in regulating age-inappropriate content on 
Smartphones and game consoles. To complicate the governance challenges 
further, studies on the dynamics of network publics and the affordances 
of Web 2.0 technologies also provide us with an understanding of why 
online safety messages may either go unheeded or appear to be ignored 
by children (Byrne, 2009; Livingstone et al., 2008a,b). boyd suggests that 
some children’s exposure to risks were contributed by the fact that they 
did not regard the safety messages as relevant to them or their daily lives 
(boyd, 2008b: 269–73). Some children, it appears, regard parental oversight 
of their online activities as an intrusion into their privacy and freedoms. 
Children’s perception of online safety education and media constructions 
of risks cannot be underestimated. According to the psychological reactance 
theory, individuals faced with curbs on their freedom will experience react-
ance and consequently reassert their choices, which have the effect of di-
luting the effect of the restrictions (Brehm, 1966; Byrne et al., 2011). Online 
safety messages and parental controls when perceived as intrusions may 
result in children developing “work around” strategies like creating false 
social networking site profiles, setting up of multiple email accounts and 
circumventing filtering controls and settings (Dillard et al., 2005; Mitchell 
et al., 2007c). In other instances, children’s misplaced sense of their own 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

270 Online Child Safety
safety and security can contribute to their inadvertent exposure to online 
safety incidents (Cox Communications, 2010). The recent phenomenon of 
sexting illustrates how a combination of all these factors can contribute 
to young adolescents assuming that online safety messages do not apply 
to them. Conversely, even if children do recognise the relevance of online 
safety messages, these may still be resisted (Byrne et al., 2009). As Byrne and 
Hart argue:
Boomerang effects also emerge in media literacy interventions ... that are 
intended to reduce stereotypical attitudes generated from viewing media 
messages may sometimes increase prejudicial responses when compared 
to a control group. (Byrne et al., 2009: 8)
The “boomerang effect” may also provide some explanation for the miscal-
culations by children which expose them to online incidents like peer vic-
timisation and inadvertent exposure to age-inappropriate content in emails 
and websites (Lenhart et al., 2007c). That said, we should resist the impulse 
to view all children’s responses to online safety messages and guidance in 
negative terms. Children may in fact develop their own risk management 
strategies and solutions. According to the recent findings in a EU study 60 
per cent of children who encountered sexual messages online discussed the 
matter with persons other than their parent (Livingstone et al., 2011: 83) 
Notwithstanding the risk-prone nature of many of the online activities, 
children were found to utilise a wide range of risk management tools and 
strategies – defining their audiences through the use of privacy settings, 
blocking unsolicited or unwanted “friend” requests from persons outside 
the peer group, ensuring that only limited number of individuals gain access 
to user-generated content and reporting online safety incidents to respon-
sible individuals and organisations. What this brief account of children’s 
approach to information and online interactions indicates is that framing 
the regulatory problem that media literacy is expected to resolve is not as 
simple as it might first appear. The governance challenges facing media lit-
eracy programme development is further compounded by the fact that the 
benefits of increased accessibility, mobility, replicability and instantaneity 
offer for learning and development can always be abused (Lenhart et al., 
2007c). Accordingly, information security competences (and ethical or citi-
zenship values) need to be seen as a subset of media or digital literacy skills 
(O’Neill et al., 2010: 18). We need, however, to be cautious about engaging 
in any form of technological determinism. As studies regarding children’s 
use of Web 2.0 technologies continue to emphasise – risks arise in differ-
ent contexts and settings and affects children differently (Livingstone et 
al., 2010a, 2011). Given that children also respond and react to risks dif-
ferently (i.e. gender, ethnic minority, special education needs) media lit-
eracy strategies need to avoid the image of all children as invariably coming

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 271
within the category of vulnerable and incompetent individuals (Byrne et al., 
2009). It may very well be that better targeting of children who are likely to 
benefit from specific online safety resilience measures should be regarded 
as a policy priority and resources allocated appropriately in supporting any 
initiatives. It is beyond the purpose of this book or the chapter to address 
the online child safety governance issues that impact those children who 
come within this category of “at risk” individuals (Chamberlain et al., 2010; 
Mencap, 2007; Office of the Children’s Commissioner, 2006).
The interaction between information security literacy and media literacy
For media literacy to fulfil the standards envisaged in the UNCRC and 
the values highlighted in the Tunis Commitment, three areas needed to be 
addressed when deploying a hybrid of “regulators” (e.g. State, industry, civil 
society, parents and educators) and strategies (e.g. mandatory, self- and co-
regulation) (Ofsted, 2010). First, the measures must aim to enhance ICT 
competences and knowledge of Web 2.0 technologies (functional literacy). 
Knowledge and understanding of the tools for using web browsers, instant-
aneous modes of communication and the affordances of Web 2.0 technolo-
gies are a pre-requisite to equipping children with the strategies for risk 
management (ITU, 2009b). Children will not be able to make informed 
decisions about how best risks can be managed in a safe and responsible 
manner if they do not have an understanding of Web 2.0 affordances and 
terminology. Drawing on studies and surveys under the UK Children Go 
Online programme, it was suggested that children do not possess the same 
analytical or evaluative skills with regard to engagement with digital con-
tent, when compared with adults (Livingstone, 2003a,b; Livingstone et al., 
2005a,c). This, it should be noted, is not always related to online safety 
and covers generic media literacy issues. The second matter to be addressed 
is that relating to raising children’s awareness of the nature of digital in-
formation and problems associated with authentication and reliability (in-
formation security literacy). Whilst the promotion of functional literacy 
skills is important, safety and awareness raising strategies need to be seen 
as something more than requiring a technical solution to managing safety 
and online risks. The term “information security literacy” is not used in 
the sense of overcoming a child’s perceived lack of cognitive and develop-
mental ability to critically evaluate online information. We can understand 
“informational security literacy” as a phrase used to denote an awareness 
and appreciation of the particular attributes of Web 2.0 affordances and the 
properties of digital information, which if misused, can potentially expose 
a child and its peers to online safety incidents (Butterfield, 2010). A lack of 
awareness of the functionalities of information networks can, for example, 
lead a child to readily assume that network publics constitute a defined 
audience, until he or she realises that information can be readily accessed, 
replicated and even distributed by and to visible and invisible audiences.

272 Online Child Safety
Disintermediation and anonymity also have important implications for a 
child’s ability to authenticate and verify both the identity of the users the 
child is connected with and those connected with him or her. In a survey com-
missioned by Symantec, Norton Online Family Report 2010, which involved 
9,000 online adults and children in the United States, Canada, the United 
Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, China, Japan, India, Australia 
and Brazil, it was found that media illiteracy and lack of information se-
curity skills were major factors in impairing a child’s ability to manage the 
risks encountered in settings like chat rooms, emails, blogs, search engines, 
gaming sites, virtual worlds and social networking sites (Norton, 2010). The 
release of the findings from the EU report on January 2011 provides some 
important insights into the media literacy skills of children within the 11- to 
16-year-old age group (Livingstone et al., 2011). The survey involved 23,420 
children between the ages of 9 and 16, plus one of their parents and covered 
23 Member States. For the purposes of the issues considered in this chapter, 
we can focus on one aspect of the findings relating to the responses of chil-
dren to the eight digital safety skills deemed to be critical to minimising 
online safety incidents and risks (Table 7.1).

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 273
These eight skills are undoubtedly important and the findings can assist 
policymakers and educators better target the attainment of media literacy 
skills. The differences in the level of digital competences between the 11- to 
12-years-old and the 13- to 15-years-old band should make clear that media 
literacy instruction needs to better engage children and effective strategies 
for measuring outcomes need to be developed. Findings that 28 per cent 
of the children surveyed were not confident in using access control tools 
to differentiate the quality of online content or that 34 per cent of chil-
dren aged 11–12 years did not know how to alter the settings for managing 
disclosure and control of personal information on social networking sites 
need to be addressed through the use of practical exercises drawn from situ-
ations children are likely to encounter in their daily lives and experiences. 
The report concludes that some of the critical and safety skills still need to 
be more robustly embedded in current online safety education programmes 
(Livingstone et al., 2011: 27). The focus on competences like the ability to 
adopt a critical stance on the quality of the information on websites, chan-
ging filtering and privacy settings, blocking unwanted communications and 
identifying safety information online are some of the skills children will 
have to master if they are to better engage with Web 2.0 technologies and so-
cial media confidently and safely. Clearly, education authorities and schools 
need to reassess the delivery, implementation and evaluation of media lit-
eracy programmes in the light of these findings (Livingstone et al., 2011: 
145–6). The Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills 
(Ofsted) will undoubtedly have an important role in auditing progress in 
this sphere of online safety education. It may very well be that more efforts 
will have to be directed at ensuring that parents and educators are equipped 
with the knowledge, skills and confidence in assisting children towards this 
end. Another explanation for these findings could very well be due to the 
fact that online safety education has until now been introduced to children 
far too late; educational interventions aimed at facilitating appropriate be-
havioural changes and attitudes need to be introduced when children first 
engage with Web 2.0 technologies (Livingstone et al., 2011: 145).
Whilst the focus on ICT competences is important, online safety educa-
tion must also address information security literacy issues like the manipu-
lability, replicability and permanence of information. Other issues relate 
to the nature of information networks and the difficulties individuals en-
counter when differentiating between various forms of content. Ethical and 
moral dimensions of online behaviour can also be integrated into media 
literacy programmes (e.g. hacking, illegal file sharing, sexting and cyberbul-
lying). The aim in seeking responses to the information security and eth-
ical issues raised by children’s participation in network publics is to educate 
children, parents and educators about the properties of information net-
works and to encourage them to evaluate technology from the perspective 
of their daily experiences and activities. The discussions generated between

274 Online Child Safety
the child and the parent/educator can also be used to promote an under-
standing of the malleable nature of personal information, and identify the 
power imbalance and information asymmetries implicit in online interac-
tions. As Turkle correctly observes, the view that childhood is a moratorium 
space may need to be re-thought since the permanence of data does not 
readily sit alongside with an online existence “that generates its own elec-
tronic shadow” (Turkle, 2011: 260).
Two additional observations can be made in the light of the findings from 
the EU study. First, the findings regarding a child’s understanding and man-
agement of its privacy need to be approached with some circumspection. 
boyd and Hargittai rightly suggest that young adults’ use of privacy settings 
depends on a number of factors: frequency of use, familiarity, confidence 
with technology and fear (boyd et al., 2010). In their study of young adoles-
cents on Facebook they noted some correspondence between children’s con-
fidence and familiarity with the communication platform and their ability 
in managing information accessed by their target audience. The authors 
also conclude that online service providers do not take into account suffi-
ciently the fact that children who are most vulnerable may be least able to 
make effective use of their privacy settings on their social network accounts 
(boyd et al., 2010). This is true but there is a much deeper issue. Turkle sug-
gests that even though children’s and adults’ perceptions of privacy may 
not necessarily be identical, it does not obviate the need for parents and 
educators to engage children more fully in a wider discussion about how 
technology, privacy, and identity are being “re-wired” by online service pro-
viders (Turkle, 2011: 260–4). With regard to possessing critical skills which 
can assist children in differentiating the quality of information flows, the 
findings from the EU study do not make clear the process by which children 
actually engage with online content. This oversight needs to be rectified. 
One reason why children may inadvertently encounter age-inappropriate 
content from search results is that well-known information retrieval sys-
tems tend to be regarded as badges of credibility and trust (Hargittai et al., 
2010). This “leap of faith” is not unsurprising as Sundar observes that online 
content is now a composite of messages, categories and sources “embedded 
in the numerous layers of online dissemination of content” (Sundar, 2007: 
74). Media literacy strategies must as a consequence start from the premise 
that children (like adults) adopt varying formal and informal content fil-
tering strategies. An understanding of these processes is an important first 
step in supporting children in their attempts to differentiate the quality of 
online content derived from websites and search engine results (Metzger, 
2007). If media literacy awareness initiatives are to attain their objectives, 
these complexities must be confronted, not only by the ICT industry but 
by online service providers. Accordingly, parents and educators need to be 
provided with the training and skills that enable them to understand the 
significance of website design, features and presentation, since these are 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 275
attributes that young adults unconsciously take into account when evaluating 
web content (Hargittai et al., 2010). A child’s assessment of the credibility of 
material found online or its ability to differentiate the quality of online con-
tent can be derived from a wide range of sources and consequently any ef-
fective media literacy programme must reflect an awareness of cues children 
use when determining the credibility of online content in both formal and 
informal settings (Hargittai et al., 2010: 487).
There are a number of benefits in integrating some of the observations 
noted above into existing online safety education and media literacy initia-
tives generally. For example, media literacy strategies can be used to identify 
concrete situations and affordances that are prominent in children’s daily 
activities. Second, an understanding of children’s use and perceptions of 
Web 2.0 opportunities and risks will ensure that children can be equipped 
with the knowledge and support that will enable them to reflect on their 
online activities (Donath et al., 2004). Finally, information security edu-
cation becomes an ongoing and relational activity where children can be 
engaged in a dialogue on not only what the risks are but also how risks arise 
and the rationale of many of the formal and informal rules and norms that 
can promote and sustain a culture of safe and responsible use. Engagement 
and continued dialogue will also ensure that parents and educators will be 
able to fulfil their roles as mediators should concerns arise (Livingstone et 
al., 2011: 150–1). There is evidence from the wealth of information security 
material now made available on websites and those which are distributed in 
schools that the nuances of network publics and technological affordances 
are gradually being understood. Within the United Kingdom, organisations 
like Childnet, Beatbullying and CEOP now make available considerable in-
formation aimed at promoting children’s, parents’ and educators’ aware-
ness of existing and emerging information security risks (CEOP, 2010a). 
CEOP has recently produced educational material introducing children as 
young as five years of age to information security rules and concepts. The 
“Exposed” is one example of an initiative that helps children understand 
the persistence of data and its enduring implications for those engaged in 
the practice of sexting (CEOP, 2011). Complex data protection and privacy 
issues have also been addressed through the animation film – Lee and Kim’s 
Adventure – which reinforce the security implications of the persistence and 
malleability of digital information. These are just two examples of resources 
that are now made available to children and parents – and crucially, for 
educators. The COP initiative has also provided online safety guidelines for 
parents, educators and children, which can be adapted accordingly (ITU, 
2009b). These strategies and measures are increasingly reflected in the 
developments taking place across many jurisdictions including Australia, 
the United States and Canada and Member States in the EU.
One final point with regard to capacity building should be noted here. 
Should children be confused about the information they access online or

276 Online Child Safety
encounter problems with regard to the use of social networking sites, mo-
bile phones or other communications devices, it is imperative that they seek 
assistance from responsible adults (Livingstone et al., 2011: 103–122). Many 
schools and child safety organisations provide information on how chil-
dren can seek assistance or obtain redress. Even though there is evidence 
of children having recourse to peer mediation (i.e. CyberMentors), it is also 
important that measures are put in place which enable parents and educa-
tors to provide support and assistance (mediatory functions). Parents and 
educators have an important role in supporting and sustaining the standard 
setting activities covered in this book (National Foundation for Educational 
Research, 2009). Four reasons can be offered by way of support for inte-
grating parents and educators into the MSIG framework, whilst noting some 
of the shortcomings expressed earlier. The first is that parents and educators 
spend by far the largest proportion of their time with children when they 
are at a developmental and formative phase. Admittedly, one is reliant on 
the child developmental model here in suggesting that adults can play an 
influential role in terms of both mediating ongoing and emerging issues 
encountered by children and promoting a culture of safety and civic re-
sponsibility (O’Neill et al., 2010: 28–30). The role of parental oversight is 
based on the premise that parents’ decisions and actions can have a positive 
impact on children’s online interactions and consumption of Web 2.0 tech-
nologies (Livingstone et al., 2011: 117–18; Byrne et al., 2011). Researchers 
have long studied the strategies employed by parents and educators in medi-
ating children’s use of media (Livingstone, 2007, 2009c; Nathanson, 2004). 
In their survey of techniques adopted by parents in managing the online 
activities of children aged between 12 and 17 years, Livingstone and Helsper 
noted that the use of filtering and monitoring software solutions and social 
strategies like co-use, time and location restrictions varied according to par-
ental styles, familiarity with ICT, age and gender of children (Livingstone 
et al., 2008c, 2009a). Nathanson in a separate survey observed, however, 
that parents with negative conceptions of content screened on television 
were more active in mediating children’s access to such content (Nathanson, 
2002). This is also likely to be true in the case of parents whose view of 
children’s interaction with Web 2.0 technologies are largely informed by 
media stories which sensationalise and magnify online risks and threats 
facing children (Livingstone et al., 2011: 118; Byrne et al., 2011). It is par-
ticularly helpful that online service providers now coordinate their activ-
ities with those of parents and educators by making available filtering and 
monitoring software, and instructional material focusing on specific age 
groups (Livingstone et al., 2011: 148; Eastin, 2008). However, it should be 
noted that finding an effective strategy for engaging parents and carers 
must continue to be an important governance priority. Surveys suggest that 
some parents seem to be unaware of the online safety issues, underesti-
mate the risks faced by their children or are less than confident in using 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 277
online filtering tools and safety measures (Livingstone et al., 2010b: 102–22; 
Livingstone et al., 2011: 111–14). Children also reported that informing par-
ents about past online safety incidents did have some influence on medi-
ation strategies (Livingstone et al., 2011: 116–19). Interestingly, the recent 
findings in the EU study relating to the differences between children and 
their parents’ accounts of the online safety incidents experienced provide 
an insight into the complex interplay between reactance, parent–child me-
diation strategies and children’s reporting of risky behaviour and online 
safety incidents (Livingstone et al., 2011: 66–71, 77–78; Lee et al., 2007; Liau 
et al., 2005, 2008). The study also found that only a quarter of the children 
surveyed found the mediation efforts of parents to be helpful (Livingstone 
et al., 2011: 115). Children in Turkey, Ireland and Bulgaria, for example, 
viewed parental mediation efforts as being overly restrictive when compared 
with experiences reported by children from Hungary and the Netherlands 
(ibid., 2011: 117). A number of possible explanations have been offered for 
these findings – parents lacking relevant ICT competences and knowledge; 
the appropriateness of parental mediation strategies and the availability of 
alternative mediatory and coping strategies (ibid.). Second, by including 
parents and educators in media literacy strategies, this can only serve to en-
sure that these stakeholders have a better understanding of the contexts and 
situations where timely interventions may be needed. Third, parents and 
educators can also provide the ICT industry, child welfare organisations and 
policymakers with insights into the issues and challenges that concern them 
with regard to their experiences and those of their children. The inclusion 
of parents and educators into online child safety governance can also pro-
vide policymakers with an opportunity to better coordinate their strategies, 
so that a principled and coherent approach towards online safety education 
can be delivered. Engaging parents and educators in the process has another 
relevance. Children’s access to the Internet continues to be determined by 
parents and educators, and, consequently, if the broader goal is to ensure 
that children are able to realise the considerable benefits that the Internet 
and its technologies make possible, parents and educators need to have a 
better understanding of Web 2.0 technologies and the cultural dimensions 
of network publics (Livingstone et al., 2009b: 3–11, Castells et al., 2007).
The ecology of media literacy networks
The evolving governance model
Media literacy as a governance strategy towards enhancing the safety of 
children is based on three assumptions. First, the effectiveness of current 
online child safety strategies can be enhanced, if information about the 
risks and threats accompanying the use of the Internet and communication 
tools enables problems to be addressed at source. The unique characteristics 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

278 Online Child Safety
of Web 2.0 technologies and its ready availability require an understand-
ing of the different contexts and levels in which risks may be encountered. 
Second, that access to relevant safety and information security can promote 
trust and confidence. Third, children, parents and educators, at a philo-
sophical or principled level, become part of the MSIG strategy. The emerging 
governance framework for media literacy consists of stakeholders drawn 
from various groups in society and a hybrid of instructional strategies and 
activities aimed at raising the awareness of children, parents and educators. 
One central theme running through debates and discussions on enhancing 
the safety of children is that children, parents and education need to be pro-
vided with information, tools and strategies in helping them make informed 
choices relating to the management of risks and online safety incidents. We 
have already seen the particular role of the EU and the United Kingdom in 
adopting measures aimed at promoting trust and confidence in the use of 
Web 2.0 technologies. The diverse range of strategies, measures and policies 
relating to media literacy prevents us from undertaking a critique of the 
governance approaches across the various jurisdictions. That said, it is clear 
that different stakeholders are actively engaged in addressing the trust and 
confidence issues which can enhance children’s online experiences. Since 
many of the safety and risk concerns emerge from the environment where 
children congregate and the type of technologies that they use – mobile 
phones, virtual worlds, social networking sites and blogs – their status as 
consumers of technologies also has important policy implications for in-
formation services providers, organisations, industry and regulators (Lim 
et al., 2010). The self-regulatory models for raising information awareness 
considered in Chapter 6 leave room for children to assume much greater 
responsibility for managing their online interactions in a safe and respon-
sible manner. It will be recalled that the Byron Review recommended the 
delivery of an e-safety curriculum and the setting up of the UKCCIS (Byron, 
2008: 70). UKCCIS was set up and published its online child safety strategy 
for the United Kingdom. UKCCIS has recently provided a series of industry 
best practice guidelines relating to moderation of interactive chat services 
for children, safe search practices, good social networking principles and 
best practices for chat services, IM and Internet connectivity content and 
hosting.5 The governance strategies noted above are also reflected in online 
child safety policymaking in other jurisdictions (ACMA, 2009b,c). In the 
United States, the OSTWG was established to review the current initiatives 
promoting online safety and make recommendations (2010: 19–29). The 
Report of the Working Group was published on June 2010 and one of its rec-
ommendations was that children should be taught media literacy (OSTWG, 
2010: 32). Media literacy consequently becomes part of the MSIG strategy. 
Many of the initiatives considered in that chapter will not be rehearsed here. 
It is now accepted that the ICT industry and businesses have an important 
role in promoting greater user awareness of their products and services, 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 279
identifying the risks associated with these products and services, describing 
the measures for addressing emerging problems and informing users of their 
legal rights. As noted above, the European Commission has embedded media 
literacy strategies into its policymaking framework (European Commission, 
2006a,b). For example, in developing media literacy initiatives, organisations 
in the Member States must take into account Recommendation 2006/952/
EC, which includes promoting media literacy to teachers, trainers and chil-
dren (European Parliament and Council, 2006). The Council of Europe has 
been proactive, as reflected in the publication of an online version of the 
Internet Literacy Handbook and a guide for  teachers – Through the Wild Web 
Woods (Council of Europe, 2009, 2010).
Media Literacy, empowerment and human rights: A comment
Media literacy can be seen as part of the MSIG strategy on many fronts – en-
abling children to maximise the opportunities that communication tools 
provide for their personal development and lifestyles choices; promoting 
participation with peers and the wider community; facilitating the acquisi-
tion of skills that enable them to become responsible individuals and citi-
zens and laying the foundations for their future engagement in the digital 
economy (Burroughs et al., 2009). Benkler argues that our traditional views 
of media literacy and historically the exclusion of illiterate individuals from 
developmental opportunities can in part be attributed to the dominance of 
centralised, proprietorial industrial models favoured by policymakers and 
educators. He suggests that the transition into the networked information 
economy illustrates how policymaking and interventions by the State, in 
relation to media literacy, mark an important shift in thinking about the 
interaction between digital competence, literacy and human development 
(Benkler, 2006: 14). It must be right that equipping individuals with in-
formation that enhance their ability to access, understand and critically 
evaluate information will facilitate their ability to participate effectively 
in the information society (Burroughs et al., 2009: 156–7; Livingstone, 
2004b). Whether it is “old” or “new” media, literacy has strong normative 
foundations (Reguero et al., 2010). As Jenkins correctly states, “[e]mpower-
ment comes from making meaningful decisions within a real civic context” 
(Jenkins et al., 2009: 12–13).
This is the participatory and democratic ideal, which is also enshrined 
in the Alexandria Proclamation, which emphasises the value of literacy as 
a means through which individuals can realise their potential and en-
gage effectively in their communities and societies.6 Notwithstanding 
the force of the empowerment rhetoric that accompanies online child 
safety governance, there are compelling reasons for circumspection 
(Harris, 2005). The rhetoric of empowerment is never far from debates on 
whether the aim of media literacy should be to protect children from all 
potential harm (Hobbs, 1998). One view is that media literacy should not 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

280 Online Child Safety
be framed purely as binary discourses of “risks” and “protection”. Such a 
strategy, Hobbs suggests, is based on contestable assumptions, namely, that 
the function of media literacy education is to “inoculate” children from 
the negative influences of media (ibid., 1998: 19). In his review of the his-
tory of media education in the United Kingdom, Buckingham notes how 
the gradual democratisation of the curriculum resulted in a corresponding 
move towards protectionism (Buckingham, 1998). Concerns about the in-
fluence of popular culture on children resulted in a culture of inoculating 
students, as noted above, from the harmful or injurious effects of media 
(1998: 36). Even though media educators have since moved on from the 
defensive approach to understanding media, the Internet has re-ignited 
some of these old fears and concerns. It may be ill-advised to draw paral-
lels between previous experiences in media education and emerging on-
line child safety governance strategies. That said, we cannot ignore the fact 
that online safety education is continuously confronted with a number of 
these competing public policy goals (e.g. empowerment, autonomy, sur-
veillance, blocking technology and restrictions on access) (Marx et al., 
2008). Buckingham has advocated going beyond the characterisation of 
the media literacy audience in binary terms of the sophisticated/vulner-
able child and urges policymakers to focus on children’s daily experiences 
and knowledge (1998: 37–8). Equally, media literacy cannot be separated 
from the constitutional dimension, which underpins childhood. The ques-
tion of what is in the child’s best interests has been dealt with previously 
(Fortin, 2006; Choudhry et al., 2005). In that discussion, it was shown that 
the boundaries between what parents and educators regarded as being in 
the best interests was in some circumstances capable of being subjected 
to judicial or extra-legal oversight. The core principle providing the basis 
for media literacy is that communication is a basic human right (O’Neill, 
2010). The United Nation’s Declaration of Human Rights, for example, gives 
particular prominence to the needs of individuals as human beings to de-
velop their abilities, and requires policymakers to ensure that their pol-
icies promote these goals. Children are, of course, not excluded from these 
expectations. If media literacy is to realise its normative ideals, it must at its 
core adhere to some fundamental precepts relating to children’s rights – a 
particularly difficult task given that defining what constitutes age inappro-
priate content or inappropriate behaviour may be culturally dependent and 
made more difficult as ascertaining when childhood begins and ends is 
becoming practically impossible. These practical and legal difficulties also 
implicate our interpretation of the scope of Article 13 of the UNCRC, which 
recognises the child’s right to freedom of expression, and that includes the 
freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, ir-
respective of whether they are oral, in written or in print, in the form of 
art or through any media of the child’s choice. Access to the technologies 
and media is a pre-requisite to facilitating the realisation of this freedom.

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 281
As noted previously, the UNCRC and the Tunis Commitment envisage the 
State and society’s commitment to enabling children develop their abilities 
and potential. More importantly, the Tunis Commitment calls on govern-
ments, the public and private sector and civil society to empower “young 
people as key contributors to building an inclusive Information Society” 
(WSIS, 2005: paragraph 25). Media literacy policymaking, and the strategy 
of empowerment, cannot be viewed outside the social milieu where chil-
dren and their identities are socially constructed. Livingstone suggests that 
whilst the efforts of national media regulators and regional institutions 
like the EU aim to democratise children’s engagement with new commu-
nication technologies and services, she counsels us to look carefully at the 
economic and political imperatives that are currently driving the media 
literacy policy agenda (Livingstone, 2008c: 58). It may very well be the 
case that “smart” regulation and the discourse on “stakeholder” participa-
tion may be the metaphorical “fig leaf” used to clothe the logic of capit-
alist imperatives. The politics of media literacy may be even more complex. 
Gill suggests that interest group politics characteristically tend to dominate 
policymaking and regulatory intervention since “[s]afety regulators, child 
protection and accident prevention agencies will want to see reductions in 
accidents, injuries, cases of abuse and neglect and other types of adverse 
outcome” (Gill, 2007: 82). Interestingly, notwithstanding the intentions of 
governments, civil society and the private sector the strategy reinforcing 
risk aversion is characteristic of “risk protestors” who regard the uncertain 
nature of the harm inherent in children’s risk-prone activities as justifying 
regulatory oversight (Van Asselt et al., 2009: 360).
Media literacy and the online context: An emerging paradigm
Media literacy strategies seem to be hindered by three particular deficiencies:
The first is that it does not address the fundamental inequalities in young 
people’s access to new media technologies and the opportunities for par-
ticipation they represent (what we call the participation gap). The second 
is that it assumes that children are actively reflecting on their media 
experiences and thus can articulate what they learn from their participa-
tion (the transparency problem). The third is that it assumes children, on 
their own, can develop the ethical norms needed to cope with a complex 
and diverse social environment online (the ethics challenge). (Jenkins 
et al., 2006: 16)
We have considered the participatory and transparency aspects in the dis-
cussion above but the reference to the “ethics challenge” accompanying 
children’s engagement with Web 2.0 technologies is of contemporary rele-
vance and can be elaborated by reference to a report issued by the Ofsted 
early in 2010 (Ofsted, 2010). The report was based on a small survey on 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

282 Online Child Safety
how well schools were engaging students with online safety practices. Ofsted 
was asked to evaluate online safety training in schools. Its principal find-
ings can be summarised. First, it was found that most schools had addressed 
the “participation gap” by ensuring that all children had access to ICT fa-
cilities and acquired basic competences. Without access to communication 
technologies and relevant knowledge of how the Web 2.0 system functions, 
building a sound base for promoting confidence is likely to be an uphill 
struggle. Confidence emerges from having both the knowledge and oppor-
tunity to engage with Web 2.0 technologies in a supportive environment. 
Second, many media literacy programmes were found to have adequately 
integrated children’s experiences into the functional skills sessions, en-
suring as a consequence that children were provided with a reflective space 
for engaging with the issues resulting from their participation in network 
publics (“transparency gap”). Finally, the inclusion of well-informed parents 
and educators was seen as creating opportunities where children could be 
engaged in a discussion on the role and place of ethical norms in their inter-
actions with peers and social media (“ethics challenge”). It is not entirely 
clear from the report what addressing the “ethics challenge” entails other 
than creating a framework for deliberative engagement. Before delving into 
this issue some brief comments can be made. Too often, an overemphasis 
on the problems of information asymmetry and the individual’s reluctance 
to intervene in cases of peer victimisation lead to an underestimation of 
the value of engaging children with the responsibilities and ethics chal-
lenges that result from their being part of an online community and culture 
(Livingstone et al., 2005a). Without a basic understanding of the communi-
cation system, the tools for interaction and the ethics challenges faced by 
children, parents and educators cannot begin to understand what it means 
to be safe or how safety can be compromised in various venues and settings 
inhabited by children. For example, Shariff alludes to the importance of 
fostering a collaborative approach to addressing the problems posed by peer 
victimisation and the value of education (2009: 127–56). However, before 
media literacy can be used to promote appropriate and reflective responses 
from children, we need to not only address the deficiencies outlined in the 
extract quoted above but we also have to articulate clearly what being safe 
and responsible means within the cultural environment of network publics. 
Turkle, for example, highlights the way breaches of civic or non-political 
norms are viewed by children as part of
[c]elebrity culture, [which] is all about transgression and rehabilitation. 
(These young people’s comfort with “bullying” their peers is part of 
this pattern – something for which they believe they will be forgiven.) 
(Turkle, 2011: 262)
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 283
Media literacy strategies also have to address the new socialising structures 
that constitute children’s environment of collapsing audiences and contexts 
(Castells et al., 2007: 141; Livingstone, 2008a). Consequently, media literacy 
strategies need to embrace an MSIG approach where
gatekeeping institutions, including local government, schools, libraries, 
and even families broker initial access to technologies, while educators 
and other adults are poised to provide the technical skills that permit a 
basic level of participation and the social and ethical skills that can nur-
ture “good participation”. (James et al., 2008: 42)
This is, however, easier said than done since the role of the Internet as a 
democratising tool has also to be considered within the context of a patri-
archal society (Lankes, 2008: 108). It is not an exaggeration to say that 
managing this transition in the way children now redefine their values 
and norms is a process that will take considerable investment in time and 
thought (Spielhofer et al., 2009; Ipsos, 2009; Ofcom, 2008c, 2009). There 
is a discernible trend, however, towards addressing some or all three chal-
lenges at varying degrees of success. Educators and child welfare advocates 
and policymakers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada 
and Australia focus on the principal risks facing children and the steps 
to be taken. The information awareness strategies display some common 
features: (a) identifying key online safety incidents; (b) categorising audi-
ence and age groups (i.e. children, educators, parents and carers; age and 
gender) and outlining formal and informal redress mechanisms. The Next 
Generation Learning Portal is an example of an information portal pro-
viding parents, educators and children with information about the way 
Web 2.0 technologies can be used both at home and at school, with par-
ticular focus on education.7 The site provides a wide range of information 
for children, parents and educators. It is not limited to online safety edu-
cation, but also highlights some of the benefits in using technology both 
in the home and in classrooms. This site contains useful information on 
how technology can be used in the classroom and provides guidance for 
those who use the Internet when studying at home. Indeed, this is a dom-
inant theme in the “Oh, Nothing Much Report” which is designed to en-
courage parents to engage with children with regard to their day in school.8 
There are links from the site to online safety resources at Thinkuknow.9 
Age-specific materials are grouped into resources for those aged between 
4 and 7, 8 and 10 and 11–16 years. There is also a set of materials for those 
with special educational needs. Sites like the BBC and Childnet continue 
to devote resources aimed at providing parents and children with infor-
mation about online safety. For example, the topics covered on the CBBC

284 Online Child Safety
website include safety tips on gaming, use of chat rooms, social networking 
sites and IM.10 Childnet International has an education portal focusing on 
digital citizenship and provides useful information for parents with older 
children.11 Apart from parents, educators are also provided with resources 
aimed at raising their awareness of online safety issues. The online portal 
Teachtoday aims to provide teachers, head teachers, governors and other 
members of the school workforce with information on new technologies 
and its possible use in schools.12 One by-product in providing members 
of the teaching profession with this resource is to enable them to facili-
tate, support and manage children’s use of the Internet and related tech-
nologies effectively. The Teachtoday site also provides bulletin boards and 
help functions to assist teachers with queries to questions or safety issues 
likely to be encountered in the educational context. The online portal was 
developed as part of a collaborative venture involving industry (e.g. social 
networking sites and mobile phone companies) and the teaching profes-
sion. The B4USurf site adopts a similar approach.13 This portal is aimed at 
young people in the Asian region, in particular Singapore. The programme 
known as the “Cyberwellness Framework” provides a modular series of top-
ics dealing with the threats and opportunities encountered by young per-
sons online. The topics also integrate the cultural values and sensitivities 
of parents and children from this region. The contents of the site are pro-
duced in collaboration with the Business Software Alliance, and the pro-
gramme targets children in the age groups 11–12, 13–16 and 17–19 years. 
There are suggested lesson plans which educators can use. For example, the 
lesson on “Blogging and use of social networking sites” focuses on indi-
viduals’ responsibility for their online behaviour. Media literacy instruction 
includes student participation in developing acceptable use policy for blogs 
and social networking sites. The portal also provides parents with informa-
tion about the “Cyberwellness Framework”. In Australia, there have been 
a series of enterprising initiatives promoting media literacy in relation to 
online safety issues (CWG, 2010).14 Responsibility for implementing gov-
ernment’s policies in this area are devolved to a number of organisations 
including the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital 
Economy (DBCDE) and ACMA. The involvement of these agencies offers 
the benefit of a coherent “joined up” approach towards cybersafety edu-
cation. The Stay Smart Online website, for example, provides a centralised 
information portal for online safety education and a free alert service for 
subscribers. ACMA, whom we have already mentioned previously, launched 
a website, Cybersmart, which provides online users with online safety infor-
mation and advice and also has a presence on YouTube.15 Like many of the 
social networking and child welfare organisations in the United Kingdom, 
the website provides a mechanism for reporting illegal and suspicious ac-
tivities. Australia has its own version of Thinkuknow, which works closely 
with Microsoft, the AFP and ninemsn.16 The CWG also takes soundings

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 285
from the Youth Advisory Group in developing its cybersafety education and 
awareness raising policies. On 16 May 2011, ACMA announced a profes-
sional development programme for its educators (ACMA, 2011). This is a free 
accredited programme aimed at providing educators with a comprehensive 
understanding of children’s engagement with Web 2.0 technologies and 
educators’ obligations in enabling children to manage their online activities 
in a safe and responsible manner. In Alberta, Canada, the Alberta Children 
and Youth Services provides online safety education information for chil-
dren and families. For example, the badguypatrol site (http://www.badguy-
patrol.ca/) is an interactive site which uses play and story narratives to teach 
children aged between 5 and 10 years critical Internet safety skills. Some of 
the issues covered include privacy and the dangers of anonymity. The web-
site http://www.weron2u.ca/ provides teenagers with a granular perspective 
of online risks and threats drawing on actual techniques used by online 
sexual predators and provides an interactive game involving blocking of un-
wanted contacts and true life stories of children who have met online con-
tacts offline. Finally, the Prevention of Child and Youth Sexual Exploitation 
Committee of the Government of Alberta set up a website, http://www.
getwebwise.ca/, aimed primarily at families and provides resources on on-
line child safety. The Media Awareness Network has developed a website, 
Be Web Aware (www.bewebaware.ca), which provides families with relevant 
online safety information. This website was created in collaboration with 
Bell and Microsoft Canada. In Australia, the search engine provider Google 
and the computer software company Microsoft worked closely with govern-
ment and NGOs in providing all stakeholders, including children, parents 
and educators, with online safety education. The social networking site, 
MySpace Australia, delivered an interactive cyberbullying education cam-
paign and competition for Australian high school students in 2009. This 
campaign was hosted jointly with SonyBMG, the Daily Telegraph, Kids Help 
Line and the New South Wales Education Department.
A closer look I: Hector’s World™
One project that encapsulates the role and value in providing parents, edu-
cators and children with relevant and accessible information is the edu-
cation and public awareness programme known as Hector’s World™.17 
Hector’s World™ is an online portal which contains a wide range of learn-
ing resources for children aged 2–9 years. A distinctive feature of this portal 
is its online safety education strategy aimed at providing children, parents 
and educators with relevant online child safety information. More specif-
ically, the strategy of bridging education and entertainment works well 
with the use of animations, interactive multimedia formats, storylines 
and identifiable characters. The site also provides material aimed at en-
couraging parents and educators to reinforce important safety and citi-
zenship rules and values (Butterfield, 2010: 109–19). Most of the resources 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

286 Online Child Safety
provided on the site seem to reflect an understanding of the way chil-
dren learn and engage with the Internet and technology. Hector’s World™ 
has clearly identified learning objectives founded on “core” values, which 
underpin the program for lifelong “digital citizenship”, namely, “respecting 
yourself, respecting others, caring for yourself and caring for your commu-
nity”. “Digital Citizenship” is regarded as bringing together the issues of 
safety, information literacy, media literacy and digital literacy. The media 
and information literacy components aim to promote many of the goals we 
ascribe to “media literacy” – namely, the development of skills required when 
dealing with information and media. “Digital literacy” is concerned with 
providing children with accessible information about the Internet and some 
of its communication and search functions. “Cyber safety” covers contact, 
conduct and content risks and focuses on information asymmetries which 
contribute to a child’s exposure to online safety incidents. This module also 
provides children with an opportunity to draw on their personal experiences 
when reflecting on the problems encountered in differentiating information 
flows (Kolb et al., 2000). For example, there is a short animation storyline in-
volving the disclosure of personal information. Animated characters are used 
to provide a story narrative regarding the dangers of disclosing too much in-
formation and the steps that can be taken to mediate risks (i.e. through the 
use of pseudonym). The subject of cyberbullying (e.g. “You are not alone”) 
is approached in two formats – an interactive video and a music video. The 
narrative storytelling strategy, which situates the subject within a context 
that a child can relate with, is central to reinforcing the safety issues and 
messages. One of the characters (Ming) is bullied when her photo is defaced 
and distributed to others. Hector and his friends note Ming’s state of distress 
and respond in a positive way. An opportunity is provided by a temporary 
pause during the animation, for parents or educators to engage with children 
and seek their thoughts on how Ming might be feeling and ascertain what 
Hector and his friends could do by way of support. The session also intro-
duces children to the way digital images can be manipulated, distributed and 
uploaded onto websites. The other matter that is addressed quite well is the 
provision of clear information on how children can seek assistance should 
they encounter problems. Often children who experience online incidents 
may be embarrassed or anxious about informing their parents or educators. 
This website provides useful information on steps children can take to either 
resolve problems by themselves or seek assistance from responsible adults. 
In building “resilience”, children need to be given the means and oppor-
tunities to take steps in managing and addressing risks they encounter. In 
the episode on cyberbullying, Hector and his friends inform a responsible 
adult. The conduct of Hector and his friends is aimed at instilling in chil-
dren a sense of community and the type of conduct expected from chil-
dren as members of a community. Reference is also made to the actions of 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 287
the “bullies”, and children are encouraged to articulate reasons why such 
forms of behaviour (even though intended as a prank or a joke) may be in-
appropriate. It is quite important, in the context of Hector’s World™, that 
the bullies apologise to Ming for defacing the photo and distributing this 
to others. Hector’s World™ also adopts appropriate narratives for older chil-
dren, with the focus again being directed at raising awareness, encouraging 
the adoption of acceptable social norms and reflection and providing infor-
mation about the mechanisms for redress and grievances. These values also 
correspond very much with the idea of a digital citizen and reinforce the 
important roles that parents and educators can play in inculcating norms of 
safety and responsibility and help them target the right behaviours at a very 
early age in a child’s online experiences.
We can close this discussion by offering a brief snapshot of one model 
that addresses the “participatory”, “transparency” and “ethical” compo-
nents highlighted by Jenkins.
A closer look II: The good play mode, cybermentors and Claire’s story
Good Play is part of the GoodWork® Project which aims to showcase institu-
tions and individuals who produce work that are academically rigorous and 
which are seen as making meaningful social contributions to practitioners. 
The Good Play project is intended to provoke in the inquisitors an informed 
discussion of the “ethical fault lines” that have emerged as a result of chil-
dren’s online experiences and interaction with social media (James et al., 
2008; Jenkins et al., 2009). Whilst media literacy policies ordinarily focus on 
access, understanding, evaluation and creation, the Good Play project views 
the interaction between youth and the Internet in terms of eliciting ethical 
issues from “online conduct that is both meaningful and engaging to the 
participant and responsible to others in the community in which it is car-
ried out” (Jenkins et al., 2009: 15; James et al., 2008: 44). One consequence of 
approaching the ethical issues raised within this framework is that it enables 
participants to adopt a child-centric perspective of interactions in network 
publics and their response to the participatory, transparency and ethical chal-
lenges inherent in their leisure time activities on social networking sites, gam-
ing sites and mobile phones. The challenges can be approached from various 
dimensions – identity, privacy, ownership and authorship, credibility and par-
ticipation (James et al., 2008: 5). The Good Play approach is particularly rele-
vant to media literacy in that it does not adopt a fundamentalist conception 
of safety or responsible use – rather, it aims to foster a dialectic engagement 
between children, parents and educators, which places the child’s develop-
ment, needs, experiences and expectations within the broader environment 
of social and cultural norms and values. Consequently, an expansive view of 
ethics is adopted which includes “respect/disrespect”, “morality/immorality” 
and “individual behavior to role-fulfilment” (James et al., 2008: 7). Values like 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

288 Online Child Safety
respect, tolerance, accountability and civic responsibility figure prominently 
as these are seen as being invaluable to the discourse on children’s understand-
ings of a range of issues – racism, disability, religion, gender and sex. Even 
though it is not possible to do justice to the complex dynamics of this project 
in the summary, we can speculate on the operation of the Good Play method-
ology in one possible situation – peer victimisation on social networking sites. 
The following is a case study adapted from the Beatbullying project:18
Claire had an account on the popular social networking site MySpace. 
Over a period of time Claire built up a network of friends, which included 
classmates from years gone by and which brought her into contact with 
friends of friends. Claire was unsure how it all started, but she discovered 
some posts on her profile page which were critical of her. Things gradually 
worsened – the comments posted on her profiles and photos became more 
vindictive and personal. Some of these postings were subsequently distrib-
uted to other children in Claire’s school. Two months after the negative 
postings started, Claire logged onto her MySpace account and found the 
following message: “I just want you to know what a fat, evil, sadistic cow 
you are. I want to see you to suffer as slow and painful a death as pos-
sible.” The insults covered both her off-school and her on-school activities 
(Beatbullying, 2009).
We can deconstruct this entire episode into the formal language of crim-
inal law rules, or even conduct a media literacy session around this “worse 
case scenario”. The Good Play approach provides a complementary strategy, 
which can be used to situate information security and media literacy con-
cepts within a broader social context, which is alert to the cognitive, moral 
and character development of children:19
Can or should young people be allowed to present their identities for 
public display?
How do we engage with children about the value of feedback, particularly 
on social networking sites?
Are there disadvantages to a child’s emotional well-being and personal 
development, where feedback becomes a primary factor in identity 
formation?
How do we engage with children who may use the anonymity provided 
by the Internet to engage in activities that they ordinarily would not engage 
in offline encounters?
Does computer-mediated conduct like peer victimisation become norms 
as a result of face-to-face mediatory opportunities being absent? Are offline 
bystanders proactive in enforcing acceptable social norms?
What are the implications of Claire’s experience for a school-wide policy 
and who should be engaged in drafting the policy?
Is Claire herself culpable?

Media Literacy and Online Safety Policy Implications 289
These are difficult questions and admittedly do not present us with easy 
answers. This is or has never been claimed to be the goal of the Good Play 
approach since it requires children to
consider their roles in various online contexts, understand the responsi-
bilities that are implied by them, and imagine the larger implications of 
various judgments. (James et al., 2009: 89)
It is not possible to deal with these and the earlier questions posed in any 
meaningful detail, save for the observation that the absence of clearly 
delineated ethical norms and poor decision-making skills lies at the root 
of concerns about children’s exposure to some of the “contact”, “conduct” 
and “content” risks. To be sure, a more robust approach to online safety 
education would require educators to adapt some of the principles from 
the “12 Guiding Principles of Exceptional Character”20 formulated by the 
International Center for Leadership in Education or those developed by 
the Heartwood Institute (“The Seven Universal Ethical Attributes”).21 The 
“Seven Universal Ethical Attributes” (i.e. courage, loyalty, justice, respect, 
hope, honesty and love) can, for example, be adapted to reflect the dilem-
mas faced by children as bystanders to cyberbullying.22 Issues like sexting, 
illegal file sharing of copyright works, peer victimisation and unauthor-
ised hacking can be based on principles like “honesty”, “compassion” and 
“contemplation”. For example, the disintermediated nature of the online 
environment may lead to individuals engaging in acts that they would not 
ordinarily be involved with in the offline environment (and vice versa). 
Conversely, cyberbullying may be prevalent because of the anonymised 
nature of online interactions or the result of the perpetrator or bystander’s 
lack of empathy (Ohler, 2011; Office of the Children’s Commissioner, 2006; 
Chamberlain et al., 2010; Mencap, 2007).
Indeed, it can be said that the Good Play approach embodies to varying 
degrees some if not most of these principles and values when calling on 
parents and educators to reflect on key governance issues raised by ques-
tions like:
How can we “ensure that all students benefit from learning in ways that 
allow them to participate fully in public, community, [creative,] and eco-
nomic life?” How do we guarantee that the rich opportunities afforded 
by the expanding media landscape are available to all? What can we do 
in schools, after-school programs, and the home to give our youngest 
children a head start and allow our more mature youths the chance to 
develop and grow as effective participants and ethical communicators? 
(Jenkins et al., 2009: 117)

290 Online Child Safety
Conclusion
Media literacy and public awareness campaigns will continue to be an im-
portant public policy response to concerns about children’s vulnerability 
to online risks and harms. We should, however, be under no illusion about 
the role and value of media literacy. The premise that raising the aware-
ness of parents and children will enhance the safety of children is valid to 
the extent that we accept that many of the actual risks (e.g. encountering 
unsolicited content which is illegal or inappropriate) or harm encountered 
by children are attributable to the lack of relevant accessible information 
relating to the management of online risks and incidents. More online 
safety education will not necessarily lead to transforming behaviours of 
children and young adolescents. Children will still continue, despite their 
participation in media literacy programmes, to make decisions that adults 
may regard as irresponsible or immature (Byrne et al., 2011). Perhaps, more 
significantly, the discussion has highlighted the value of integrating the 
“ethical fault lines” paradigm into online safety education strategies. We 
cannot, however, ignore that some “mistakes” made by a child can have 
drastic safety and well-being consequences on a scale and intensity never 
previously encountered. That said, we need an honest, responsible and ma-
ture approach towards media literacy. Framing the debate in terms which 
conflate uncertainty with risks can only lead to more calls for surveillance 
and legal and regulatory intervention, which do not necessarily enhance the 
safety and well-being of children (Sampson, 2002). One enduring message 
from the Good Play approach is that media literacy must involve teaching 
and educating children that Web 2.0 technologies bring with them oppor-
tunities, risks and responsibilities (Ohler, 2011).

Safeguarding children in the online environment opens up a new dimension 
for governance – network publics and the affordances of Web 2.0 technolo-
gies expose children to potential vulnerabilities. The need for a coherent and 
principled response from all stakeholders in enhancing children’s safety in 
the online environment received its most high-profile advocate – President 
Barack Obama. The Summit at the White House reiterates an important as-
pect of online child safety governance – we need to continue to develop 
MSIG strategies which enhance the safety of children since the limitations 
on national legal systems are manifest (White House, 2011; Chamberlain et 
al., 2010). If we accept the premise that the law is unable to provide a per-
fect resolution to the threats facing children in an increasingly networked 
society, one rational strategy would be to focus our governance efforts in co-
ordinating the activities of all stakeholders in society and ensure their com-
pliance with established rules and principles. In this closing chapter I wish to 
bring together some key issues and themes highlighted in the book.
Childhood, convergence and the risk society
We now have a wealth of research to draw from with regard to what chil-
dren do online, the technological affordances that increase the range and 
avenues for communication and the resulting safety issues. Numerous 
studies and policy reviews point to children being immersed in Web 2.0 
technologies, and more crucially from a very early age (Berson, et al., 2010; 
ACMA, 2009e). Even though network publics provide children with new 
spheres for development, experimentation, learning and identity forma-
tion, it is also becoming apparent that the idea of Web 2.0 technologies pro-
viding a moratorium space for children to grow up needs to be reassessed 
(Turkle, 2011). Convergence in multimedia technologies and their ready 
accessibility provide children with new spaces for interaction and identity 
formation, which may even accelerate the “disappearance of childhood”. 
It is too early to draw any conclusions as to how best we can harness the

developmental opportunities these technologies make possible whilst min-
imising children’s exposure to the worst excesses of the networked society. 
One thing is already becoming clear – mobile phones, social networking 
sites, virtual worlds and online games are now becoming evocative objects 
for children (Turkle, 2007; Jackson et al., 2009). Turkle has long remarked 
that children now view their online relations and experiences through 
computer screens, artificial personas (avatars) and mobile phones (Turkle, 
1999). These identities and experiences are an aspect of what many have 
come to regard as the second “self” – children now regard the virtual en-
vironment as defining their identities and lives (Livingstone et al., 2011). 
As the “virtual” become inseparable from the daily activities of children, 
Beck’s observations regarding the paradox of the logic of capitalism seems 
all the more poignant – the individualisation of risks leads to society being 
preoccupied with the risks associated with children’s interaction with Web 
2.0 technologies (Beck, 1999). We are also reminded that “[f]or teenag-
ers it is their orientation to online communication that may pose risks as 
much as they open up opportunities” (Livingstone et al., 2011: 106). This 
may be correct – in fairness, it is an observation that is equally true for 
adults as well as children (Turkle, 2011: 260–1; Livingstone et al., 2005b). 
As individuals increasingly regard the Internet as an environment for so-
cialisation and development of their personal relations, their orientation 
towards information flows and affordances will invariably expose them to 
all manner of risks. This is the Faustian bargain we make when we become 
tethered to information networks (Turkle, 2011, 182–6). The tendency to 
regard children as a homogeneous body of individuals that justifies pater-
nalism may be a view that will increasingly be hard to sustain as children 
seek new experiences and opportunities presented by ubiquitous mobile 
computing technologies, with or without parental oversight. Conversely, 
the scale and the irreparable nature of some of the content, conduct and 
contact risks may require a more nuanced approach to safeguarding chil-
dren. In Chapter 2, some reasons were offered to help us understand why 
paternalistic attitudes are pervasive and its significance for the risk-based 
approach to governance explained. As media spotlight continues to sen-
sationalise children’s vulnerabilities – stories of children committing sui-
cides, online sexual grooming, peer victimisation – we need to remind 
ourselves that in our postmodern society, risk management has become 
an important preoccupation of policymakers, and society generally (Fry, 
2009). Online child safety governance, however, poses policymakers with 
formidable challenges since there is a societal expectation that interven-
tions are needed as children are
an especially vulnerable audience – easily influenced and exploited, at 
risk from all sorts of grubby commercial interests, and particularly from 
those who peddle violence and pornography. (Buckingham, 2007: 85)

Concluding Thoughts 293
These expectations are already creating tensions within the MSIG frame-
work on a range of subjects: filtering, age verification, monitoring of online 
content and the boundaries of “content deemed to be inappropriate”. Beck’s 
“risk” thesis provides us with one rhetorical framework for understanding 
the factors motivating our increasing reliance on digital gatekeepers and the 
criminal law in reducing the risks faced by children (Beck, 1998). Risk con-
sciousness is pervasive, and perhaps most clearly illustrated by society’s image 
of the pathological child (Furedi, 1997; Beck, 1992a). One is struck very much 
by the parallels between online child safety discourse and accounts of com-
munity safety initiatives involving the characterisation of youth deviant be-
haviour (e.g. anti-social behaviour), which have attracted the interest of the 
media and the political establishment. It therefore comes as not too much 
of a surprise that children’s online interactions are problematised (e.g. risk-
prone behaviours) and every risk-prone activity is now placed under constant 
scrutiny (ITU, 2010a,b). Online safety is not purely a legal issue but is now 
seen as requiring political, technological and cultural engagement (OECD, 
2008c). The State is now one of a number of actors engaged in managing the 
risks faced by children in the online environment. This departure from an 
era where risk regulation was the province of the State and its institutions is 
a feature of the risk society. As Beck correctly observes:
The sociology of risk reconstructs a techno-social event of its (im)materi-
ality. Where risks are believed to be real, the foundations of business, pol-
itics, science and everyday life are in flux ... The concept of risk reverses 
the relationship of past, present and future. The past loses its power to 
determine the present. Its place as the cause of present-day experience 
and action is taken by the future, that is to say, something non-existent, 
constructed and fictitious. We are discussing and arguing about some-
thing which is not the case, but could happen if we continue to steer the 
same course as we have been. (1997: 137)
This is particularly true. Each chapter in this book can be viewed through 
the lens of Beck’s risk society. Risk is obviously not a new heuristic (Hood 
et al., 2001). However, it is argued that the intersection of technology, 
youth culture and risk has led to traditional discourses on children’s safety 
and well-being being replaced by another discourse – “multi-stakeholder”, 
“governance”, “resilience” and “safety”. Governance now requires all stake-
holders to engage in managing both risks and uncertainty associated with 
technological affordances like chat rooms, mobile phones and social net-
working sites (Ito, 2008). The objectives outlined in the Byron Report (and 
one which is also found in policy reviews across the EU, the United States, 
Canada and Australia) highlight the salience of the politicisation of online 
child safety governance: “risk-prone” activities, “safe” spaces and “risky” 
behaviours (Howitt, 1995; Jenkins, 1997; Buckingham, 2007). Such is the

extent of parents’ anxiety that children are encouraged not to give out 
their personal information and they are constantly reminded through 
the media and online safety awareness initiatives of the dangers of online 
sexual predators, notwithstanding that many children take precautions 
like blocking strangers and use their privacy settings on social network-
ing sites to control third party access to their online communications and 
user-generated content. Indeed, managing uncertainty has become as im-
portant as managing the threats posed by the Internet and its affordances. 
This way of thinking has become so entrenched in contemporary discourse 
that it is hard to imagine that the media, educators and parents were once 
filled with a not dissimilar anxiety about unsupervised children in public 
places and playgrounds (Graham, 2010). It is little wonder that adults and 
children tend to disagree on how best autonomy and security issues are to 
be negotiated (Castells et al., 2007; Byrne et al., 2011). These flows of infor-
mation now constitute the new risk paradigm not in the sense of new haz-
ards but in the intensity in policymaking efforts in managing complexity 
and uncertainty.
New communication technologies and the platforms for engagement re-
configure the way individuals and more particularly children engage in 
these spaces (boyd, 2010: 39–46). One thing is apparent. As children in-
creasingly become tethered to their devices and online environments, 
parents are understandably anxious about their child becoming a victim 
of bullying, being inadvertently exposed to age-inappropriate content or 
groomed by online sexual predators. Policymakers and educators continue 
to be concerned about the corruptive influences of the world beyond the 
school environment and growing reports of covert bullying and deviancy 
(House of Commons, 2011). Convergence, in summary, presents society 
with a complex set of challenges and decisions for child protection pol-
icymaking (Livingstone et al., 2005a; OECD, 2008a). Before we turn to the 
broader question that online child safety governance raises, it is worth not-
ing in passing the findings from the interim report funded by the EU SIP 
(Livingstone et al., 2011). The study also found that even though older chil-
dren tend to encounter more online risks, children can and do take respon-
sibility for managing risks and have developed coping strategies (2010: 106). 
These are not isolated findings – policy reviews undertaken in the United 
States, Canada and Australia report the developing culture of safe and re-
sponsible use amongst children. With regard to the mediation efforts of par-
ents and educators, ACMA, in its ongoing research on children’s use of the 
Internet and social media, concluded that parents were now better equipped 
to manage and support their children’s Internet use (ACMA, 2009b,c). Even 
though the strategies for raising public awareness and engaging industry, 
educators, parents and children are having some effect, it is also clear that 
a number of parents are either ignorant or suffer from apathy with regard 
to online safety matters. The EU Kids Online II Report also produced the

worrying finding that many parents continue to underestimate the on-
line risks actually encountered by their children (Livingstone et al., 2011). 
For example, a number of parents seem to be unaware that their children 
have seen adult content online (inadvertently or otherwise), been subjected 
to peer victimisation or fail to recognise signs of distress resulting from 
the child’s online experiences. Understanding the factors contributing to 
parents’ underestimation of risk is a complex undertaking – media literacy 
strategies can and should be revisited to overcome this regulatory short-
coming to address this.
Policymaking that views children as victims run the risk of viewing the 
best interest principle through the construct of a deficit model of child-
hood – children as passive, vulnerable and incompetent individuals (Gill, 
2007: 15–16). Gill, in his examination of the impact of parental risk aversion 
on children’s development, concluded that such attitudes can inhibit the 
attainment of life-long problem-solving and risk management skills (ibid.). 
He uses the example of media panics created by playground injuries to illus-
trate some of the ways insulating children from such risks can create moral 
hazards. The lack of a balanced perspective to children’s interaction with 
the Internet imposes an onerous burden on the State and its legal system – 
direct State regulation and intervention are not sustainable solutions given 
the ubiquity and mobility of information flows in the networked society 
(Sunstein, 2005, 2007). For many young adolescents an environment in-
creasingly regulated by adults is sometimes viewed with frustration – par-
ticularly as it implies that children cannot be trusted to manage their online 
activities in a safe and responsible manner (Ofsted, 2010). It is important 
that these misgivings about societal reactions to children’s engagement 
with Web 2.0 technologies are not misconstrued. None of the foregoing is 
intended to cast doubts on the need to protect those who are most vulner-
able or deemed to be at risk – commercial and sexual exploitation of children 
is an act which deprives children of their fundamental right to be brought 
up in an environment free from violence (Mencap, 2006; Hunt et al., 2007; 
Beatbullying, 2009). Harassment, bullying and physical and emotional vio-
lence need to be curbed (McLaughlin et al., 2011). Individuals, including 
children, should not be subjected to violence on the grounds of their dis-
ability, race, gender, and religion (Mencap, 2007; Office of the Children’s 
Commissioner, 2006). That said, we should also be wary of transposing fears 
and anxieties nurtured by media sensationalist reporting and avoid reflect-
ing these concerns in the way we react to children’s online activities and 
interactions. There is no risk-free zone either in the offline or in the online 
environments. In making these observations, the long-standing arguments 
about the social construction of childhood must also be borne in mind. In 
fact, it is difficult to disentangle these arguments from debates regarding 
the unique or exceptional nature of the risks that Web 2.0 technologies are 
regarded as creating for children (James, et al., 1997).

296 Online Child Safety
Legal regulation
The criminal law continues to be regarded as an appropriate policy re-
sponse in allaying public anxiety and disquiet about children’s exposure 
to illegal content and online sexual solicitation. The State is seen as play-
ing an important role in protecting its citizens, particularly those who are 
most vulnerable (Ashworth, 2000: 225). Laws governing the distribution 
of images of child sexual abuse images, sexual exploitation of children by 
nationals travelling to overseas countries and sexual activity with minors 
serve to reassure society that individuals who violate these rules will be 
held to account. Admittedly, in some jurisdictions, the criminal laws pro-
tecting children are not enforced effectively, and support for victims is far 
from ideal. These are well-documented problems and occur for a range of
reasons – poor social infrastructures, corruption and lack of skilled law en-
forcement personnel. Much has been made about the Internet and cyber-
space confronting regulators, law enforcement, parents and educators with 
an insurmountable challenge for the ability of the criminal law to protect 
children (ECPAT, 2008). These fears and concerns should, however, be kept 
in perspective – it is worth remembering that many online criminal activities 
originate in offline contexts (Palfrey et al., 2008: 83–106). Two provisional 
observations can, however, be made in this regard. First, many child safety 
concerns expressed in relation to children’s participation in network pub-
lics mirror those encountered in traditional child protection policymaking 
(Madge et al., 2007: 13; Postman, 1983: 80–1). Second, and it is particularly 
true here, parental fears about managing invisible risks and uncertainty 
have elevated the role of the State both as a manager of risks and as an asses-
sor of the levels of risk that children can reasonably be expected to assume 
(Ashworth, 2009: 89; Beck, 1992a: 73; Van Asselt et al., 2009). It is of course 
right that policymakers should continue to assess the applicability of their 
criminal laws in dealing with the criminal acts of its citizens both at home 
and abroad. Mobile computing and communication technologies make pos-
sible new avenues through which children can become victims as well as 
perpetrators of harm and violence. As Chapters 2 and 3 highlighted, the 
fact that online child safety has been viewed as a problem of enforcement 
has perhaps created the impression that criminal law standards and rules 
operate only within a specific regulatory domain – law enforcement, legisla-
tors and courts. As the discussion has shown, the evolving MSIG framework 
illustrates the extent to which adoption of appropriate regulatory strategies 
can lead to a more fluid and timely (if not effective) response to many of 
the governance challenges faced by children in the online environment 
(Dutton et al., 2007). This much is implicit, if one considers the public meet-
ings convened by the House of Lords Select Committee in 2007 – following 
the enquiry into the state of information security it was suggested that soft-
ware manufacturers and Internet service providers can and should assume 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Concluding Thoughts 297
a greater role in enhancing the security of individuals online (House of 
Lords Science and Technology Committee, 2007). The MSIG model can be 
regarded as a timely response, particularly as the rapid pace of technological 
innovations precedes the ability of individuals (particularly children) to 
develop norms of behaviour that help them identify and manage online 
risks (ibid., 2007: paragraph 6.36). The allocation of risk management and 
assessment obligations across the private sector, educators and civil society 
organisations is an acknowledgement that the State cannot be expected to 
regulate risks facing children entirely on its own. For example, the require-
ment that schools and educators now demonstrate their compliance with 
societal expectations that children take advantage of learning and develop-
mental opportunities without fear of victimisation is an important part of 
the standard setting agenda in this area of governance. The use of educators 
and schools to create a culture of safety and security should not be seen as 
a failure of the criminal law or public mistrust in legal rules and norms. To 
be sure, parents, educators and schools can in essence shape children’s use 
of Web 2.0 technologies and inculcate appropriate social norms and atti-
tudes. The governing body within schools is required under Section 88 of 
the Education and Inspections Act 2006 to establish policies which promote 
good behaviour and discipline amongst pupils. Developing appropriate so-
cial norms within schools may also be a preferable solution rather than 
“exclusion” from schools or litigation since “[t]echnology is employed in 
efforts to humiliate, deprecate, or isolate ... the point is to show who has so-
cial power. It’s all about creating and reinforcing hierarchies”.1 One example 
of how schools and other stakeholders can respond in a timely and effective 
way in arresting the pernicious threat posed by peer victimisation to chil-
dren can be gleaned from the recommendations accompanying a study con-
cluded in Australia (Cross et al., 2009). The strategies proposed in the study 
include media literacy and awareness-raising programmes, the promotion 
of civic responsibilities and resilience and engaging parents, educators and 
children. Other risk management strategies include the regulation of mo-
bile phone use, counselling and targeting behavioural issues that lie at the 
root of bullying. In England, the Bottisham Village College adopts a “whole 
school positive culture” policy, which defines the standard of behaviour 
expected of staff and pupils.2 The Marlborough School uses personal devel-
opment curriculum to foster citizenship and equality values amongst staff 
and pupils in promoting a positive learning environment.3
One conclusion reached from the analysis undertaken with regard to the 
role of the criminal law in Chapter 3 is that an approach which charac-
terises children as a homogenous body of vulnerable individuals in need 
of protection runs the real risk of underestimating the complex ways chil-
dren now navigate and manage the affordances made available by Web 2.0 
technologies. In constitutional terms, an indiscriminate approach towards 
implementing child safety policies can undermine or even encroach into a 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

298 Online Child Safety
child’s legitimate expectations of privacy and self-determination. Indeed, 
like Corsaro, we can observe that children’s participation in network pub-
lics is a collective process and not simply a form of socialisation that inter-
nalises “adult skills and knowledge” (1992: 161). In other words, respecting 
children’s fundamental rights without compromising the public interest in 
protecting a child from harm and abuse involves a recognition that
children discover a world which is endowed with meaning and that they 
help to shape and share in their own developmental experiences by their 
interactive responses. (1992: ibid.)
Finally, in practical terms, the real danger accompanying the generalisation 
of children’s vulnerability to online threats is that it perpetuates an ex-
pectation that legal intervention is necessary and perhaps distracts us from 
directing our efforts in identifying and supporting those who are most at 
risk and in need of assistance (Rosen, 2007: 136–8). A related concern is that 
increased regulatory intervention may produce unintended consequences 
like encouraging children to take needless risks or discourage them from 
reporting or seeking assistance when online risks are encountered (Byrne 
et al., 2011).
As we have seen, network infrastructures and digital information pose 
problems for policing and enforcement – equally, these challenges can 
be addressed by adopting strategies and measures which complement the 
role of the law in this area of governance (e.g. codes of practice for so-
cial networking sites and mobile phone operators). And in some instances, 
questions may be legitimately raised as to whether criminalising particular 
forms of behaviour is the most effective governance response. Any attempt 
to extend the reach of the criminal law to cover all forms of peer deviance, 
unhelpfully described as “cyberbullying” or “sexting”, merely serves to ob-
scure both the rationale of the criminal law and the extent to which the 
State can be reasonably expected to intervene in protecting its citizens from 
harms or risks resulting from their daily risk-prone activities. The decision 
by 45 State legislatures in the United States to enact anti-bullying laws re-
quiring schools to work with students, parents, law enforcement and local 
communities would appear to be an appropriate governance response.4 
This situation aside, it is not an exaggeration to say that the decentralised 
architecture of the Internet and the emergence of online services providers 
add to the complexities of policing, investigating and enforcing criminal 
law rules and norms with regard to the commercial and sexual exploit-
ation of children (Kim-Kwang, 2008). According to Jenkins, “[t] he biggest 
single problem facing police is simply recognizing and understanding the 
nature of the child porn world on the Net” (2003: 215). We need not adopt 
a dystopian view of protecting children in the online environment. The 
earlier chapters highlighted instances where law enforcement have used

Concluding Thoughts 299
networked technologies to exchange information with other national au-
thorities, harnessed the anonymity offered by the online environment to 
entrap individuals and gathered incriminating evidence from ISPs (Krone, 
2005b,c). Even in the area of peer victimisation, online incidents which 
otherwise may have gone unreported or unnoticed can now be detected by 
parents reviewing the information stored on message folders on the com-
puter, mobile phones or social networking sites. The examination of inves-
tigatory and evidence gathering techniques in Chapter 3 suggests that the 
very features that promote deviant and criminal activity can be used by law 
enforcement in holding offenders to account. Other strategies adopted to 
minimise exposure to illegal content include modifying the design archi-
tectures of the affordances provided in networked technologies (e.g. hot-
lines, alert buttons and privacy controls) (IWF, 2010b). Technology-aided 
identification of victims in child abuse images and tracing of credit card 
transactions are some of the investigatory tools used by law enforcement 
(ECPAT, 2009: 95).
Policing and enforcing national laws in a networked environment is an 
ongoing problem for information security generally (R v Hopps). The earlier 
chapters identified the strategies adopted by a number of online intermedi-
aries (e.g. IWF, social networking sites and mobile phone providers) in assist-
ing law enforcement. The APPCG conducted an inquiry into the regulation 
of online traffic with particular reference to the role of ISPs. One of the 
issues examined was whether the current self-regulatory model should be 
maintained, modified or replaced. A difficulty often faced when urging ISPs 
to adopt a more proactive stance in modifying the transmission of commu-
nications is the issue raised with regard to the resulting loss of immunity 
provided by Articles 12–14 EC Directive 2000/31. Notwithstanding the im-
munity provisions, and the lengths to which online intermediaries can or 
should be expected to enhance the safety of its consumers, the assumption 
of additional responsibilities on online intermediaries is already under way 
(ITU, 2008b, 2009d). The chapter on the role of the private sector in pro-
moting consumer trust and confidence through the assumption of volun-
tary obligations in protecting children is one such example (OECD, 2010a). 
Ultimately, a balance has to be struck between empowerment and protec-
tion concerns – and more importantly, some further clarification will be 
needed as to what can be legitimately expected from online intermediaries 
in enhancing the safety of children in the online environment (OSTWG, 
2010; ACMA, 2009a,b).
The MSIG model
It has never been so easy for individuals and criminal organisations to gain 
access to children for their sexual gratification or victimise individuals 
(OECD, 2009). The Internet also makes it easier for individuals to engage 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

300 Online Child Safety
in criminal activities from foreign jurisdictions, which either do not have 
effective policing resources or do not have laws protecting children from all 
forms of abuse and sexual exploitation (Grabosky, 2007a,b). One outcome of 
the increasing trend in approximating national laws and the establishment 
of procedures for investigation and collection of evidence (digital or other-
wise) is that these go some way towards minimising the difficulties faced 
by law enforcement in prosecuting individuals, in cases where the crim-
inal activity has transborder dimensions (European Commission, 2010e). 
A number of countries have enacted extraterritorial legislation to prosecute 
those nationals found to have engaged in CSEC in foreign jurisdictions 
(High, 2005). Despite concerns expressed by NGOs about the impediments 
posed by extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction principles, the “jurisdictional 
problem” should not be overstated. In fact, the logistical challenges faced by 
High Tech law units when investigating and processing offences continue 
to be a primary cause of complaint amongst national law enforcement au-
thorities as they attempt to keep pace with online criminal activities. This 
is not to say that reforms to existing criminal jurisdiction principles will 
not be welcome. It is hoped that the Proposed Directive will make a signifi-
cant impact on the day-to-day activities of law enforcement in prosecuting 
individuals for engaging in criminal activity with a transborder element 
(European Commission, 2010e). In the discussion on transborder and inves-
tigatory challenges, it has been shown that the Internet can actually make 
the task of investigating and prosecuting offenders much easier, as law en-
forcement organisations share intelligence with each other. Information 
sharing, greater collaboration with the banking sector, NGOs, ISPs and 
the use of sting operations are some of the notable reflexive governance 
responses.
National laws now have to accommodate the significance of the end-to-
end architecture for the MSIG and risk-based regulatory strategies (Klinke, 
2009; Fisher, 2010; OECD, 2003). The emerging MSIG deliberative and deci-
sion-making processes now draw on experts, researchers and NGOs to iden-
tify optimal risk management strategies at four levels:
The convergence between digital, broadcasting and telecommunication 
1. 
markets and its impact on business models.
The development of regulatory frameworks based on national, sector- 
2. 
and Internet-specific boundaries.
The emergence of contact, content and conduct risks and their signifi-

cance for regulatory options and choices.
National, regional and international policy developments.
4. 
Online child safety, it should be said, is now regarded as part of a broader 
discourse about the obligations of governments and society generally in 
10.1057/9780230361003 - Online Child Safety, Joseph Savirimuthu

Concluding Thoughts 301
ensuring that children grow up in an environment where they are not 
abused or exploited (OECD, 2008c). States have also been active in demon-
strating their support in addressing the threats of sexual violence and abuse 
to children. To this, we should also add the considerable work undertaken 
at the HRC and the UN General Assembly in advocating a rights-based 
approach to children’s rights (ECPAT, 2009). The efforts of civil society 
and the considerable work undertaken by NGOs, the World Congress, the 
European Commission and the Council of Europe, the UN and the OECD 
together with the support of national governments suggest that great strides 
continue to be made in enhancing children’s safety in the online envir-
onment. Reference has been made to the role of the EU on this front and 
the standard setting value of instruments like the CPC Convention, the 
Cybercrime Convention and the UNCRC. Harmonisation of child protec-
tion policies, greater law enforcement collaboration and the extensive work 
undertaken by NGOs now take place at many levels and contexts (European 
Commission, 1996a; European Financial Coalition, 2010b; FCACP, 2008; 
FBI, 2008; Gercke, 2008). The emergence of transnational actors and inter-
national institutional infrastructures for decision-making has three signifi-
cant consequences for online child safety governance. First, State-mandated 
approach to centralised governance is now expanded to include reflexive 
assessments of risks and the formulation of regulatory responses which are 
transparent and capable of being measured for their negative impacts. It is 
particularly relevant to note that the Eurobarometer Surveys on children’s 
experiences of their use of social networking sites and mobile phones are 
increasingly being grounded on evidence of perceived and actual risks 
(Eurobarometer, 2005, 2007, 2008). This phenomenon, as Keohane and Nye 
argue, has opened up the regulatory space, where States frequently engage 
with transnational actors and civil society in debates about governance, 
accountability, transparency and standards (1998: 81–94). Whether and to 
what extent non-State actors exercise the type of influence in defining the 
policy and standard setting agenda in child protection is of course a moot 
point (Strange, 1996). Second, self- and co-regulation are deemed to be the 
default governance strategies, since these are meant to cohere with rational, 
efficient and legitimate approaches to balancing innovation and child pro-
tection issues. Online child safety governance policymaking and strategies 
consequently need to take into account three aspects in current communi-
cations regulatory arrangements: (1) the shift from an industry to a informa-
tion/network-based framework; (2) the existence of a common regulatory 
framework for the carriage of communications services and (3) the regula-
tion of a diverse array of content delivered from multiple venues and com-
munication platforms (OECD, 2004: 17). Third, the collaboration between 
civil society and the private sector is seen very much as an enterprise that 
will promote trust and confidence (ACMA, 2009d; OfCom, 2008a).

302 Online Child Safety
Childhood in the digital world
In the analysis of some of the principal areas of online child safety policy-
making, it was suggested that three goals have to be pursued in tandem – 
equipping children and their carers with appropriate media literacy skills, 
embedding child safety norms in the architecture of the Internet and the 
need to strike a balance between safety and empowerment issues. The Byron 
Report in 2008, the studies in the United States by the ISTTF and the OSTWG 
in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and the three reports on online risk and safety 
in the digital economy published by ACMA in Australia between 2008 and 
2010 have called for an MSIG approach to online child safety policymaking. 
Each report advocates media literacy as an important instrument for enhan-
cing children’s safety. In Chapter 7, it was argued that media literacy initia-
tives need to take into account children’s perspectives of the affordances of 
networked publics, their views on online safety issues and their risk manage-
ment strategies (Livingstone et al., 2011). The Thornburgh Commission may 
have had this aspect very much in mind when it observed that
teaching a child to swim and to exercise good judgment about bod-
ies of water to avoid has applicability and relevance far beyond swim-
ming pools – as any parent who takes a child to the beach can testify. 
(Thornburgh et al., 2002: 224)
There is still quite a lot of work to be done in this respect (Livingstone et al., 
2007). In a recent study it was noted that schools in the United Kingdom 
varied in their approaches towards online child safety (SWGFL, 2010: 1) This 
must be an area of concern – the lack of information security literacy and 
understanding of network affordances can only perpetuate the widening gulf 
between children’s out-of-school experiences and their school activities and 
experiences. Whilst promoting greater awareness of the Internet and the sig-
nificance of its affordances for privacy, identity and security, it should not 
be overlooked that education and promoting children’s awareness of infor-
mation security issues are by themselves insufficient. That said, there are 
two points that need to be highlighted. First, online safety in this context 
is not simply concerned with reducing the information deficit in parents 
and children. Second, developmental issues needed to be taken into account 
(Goswami, 2008; Livingstone et al., 2004, 2011). If we start from the premise 
that children are not passive subjects, the focus of media literacy strategy 
must surely be directed at educating children in the broadest sense of the 
word (Byrne et al., 2009; Livingstone, 2008b). In Chapter 7 we considered 
how media literacy might be conceptualised through the use of an “informa-
tion security” approach and, more importantly, the benefits of integrating 
the framework provided by the Good Play project. By focusing on chil-
dren’s experiences, parents and educators, as online gatekeepers, can use the

Concluding Thoughts 303
Good Play model to promote citizenship values and decision-making skills 
(Smetana, 1995; Ohler, 2010). Younger children, particularly those below 
the age of 13, may need a slightly different policy response (ITU, 2009b,c,d; 
ACMA, 2010b). The approach adopted in Hector’s World™, Cybersmart and 
CEOP’s educational adventure series illustrates how education and ethical 
values can be imparted by simple strategies focusing on children’s experi-
ences of Web 2.0 technologies in their daily lives – there is now a good case 
for introducing online safety and citizenship education to children at a much 
earlier age (Butterfield, 2010; Livingstone et al., 2011; ACMA, 2009f). This is 
not to say that there is a “one size fits all” approach, given the fact that chil-
dren vary across cultures and develop at different levels (Goswami, 2008: 
2–4). The Good Play model, discussed in the previous chapter, provides us 
with one approach that parents and educators can consider when responding 
to the needs and expectations of children in the networked society (Moore, 
2010). Even though older children by nature tend to resent what they per-
ceive as unnecessary adult interference, parents and educators need to think 
more creatively on how best they can mediate and impart appropriate skills 
and social norms to children (Ohler, 2010; Byrne et al., 2011). Admittedly, 
this is not easy, particularly as network publics are increasingly regarded as a 
defining environment for children’s identities and integration into participa-
tory cultures (Livingstone et al., 2011).
Media literacy strategies also remind us of the power imbalance that has 
long defined relations between adults and children in society (Castells 
et al., 2007). Adults are the ultimate arbiters of how and when the Internet 
can be accessed – but constant monitoring and surveillance is not an en-
tirely sustainable strategy, since children can access Web 2.0 technologies 
and social media from a variety of locations. Stories of children using work-
arounds, creating fake accounts in social networking sites with parents 
as their “friends” and accessing inappropriate online content at friends’ 
homes or mobile devices suggest that promoting good decision-making 
skills requires persistence, empathy and commitment. There is something 
more that parents and educators need to do, which is to engage more fully 
with Web 2.0 technologies and grapple with the “ethical fault lines” iden-
tified in the Good Play project. One hesitates in advocating a particular 
parenting style that promotes safe and responsible use, but it is clear that 
more effort needs to be made in engaging parents, since (together with 
educators and children’s peers) they are best placed to make timely inter-
ventions and inculcate appropriate values and practices in their charges 
(Bronfenbrenner et al., 2000).
Conclusion
Society has long struggled with the “childhood” question (Aries, 1973). 
Protective and precautionary impulses that characterise the patriarchal

framework are difficult to overcome. One of the biggest fears of parents is 
that the harms they hear perpetrated on children in the online environ-
ment may be inflicted on their own children. The anxiety faced by all par-
ents is unlikely to come to an end. The end-to-end architecture, the flows of 
information and the collapsing of contexts have reversed the presumptive 
norms defining child protection policies in the pre-Web 2.0 environment. 
Many of the online child safety governance challenges that we see mediated 
through communication technologies arise at two levels. First, those which 
result from the generation of risks from the misuse of Web 2.0 technologies. 
Second, those which can broadly be regarded as resulting from individuals 
ethical choices in response to the disintermediated and anonymous dimen-
sions of online interaction, identity formation and participation. It is safe to 
say that policymakers, educators and parents are still very much in the early 
stages of working out the protective parameters of children’s online and off-
line activities. Enhancing the safety of children in the online environment 
is a particularly formidable challenge and the quest for an effective govern-
ance framework is likely to generate further intense public policy debates 
and arguments (Hersh, 2001). Whatever choices we make about children’s 
engagement with the Internet and the networked environment, we need 
to accept that there is no metaphorical Walden Pond for children.5 Thoreau 
would have been first to admit that had the Internet existed during his time, 
keeping the online and offline lives of individuals separate would have 
required more than signposting – “No (Harmful or Inappropriate Content 
and) Technology beyond This Point”. Information networks now blend 
broadcasting, entertainment and social spaces and lead to collapsing audi-
ences and contexts – we now have the opportunity to equip children with 
the skills and values demanded from Web 2.0 technologies. Perhaps, like 
Kelly, we should be mindful of the First Law of Technological Expectation: 
“The greater the promise of a new technology, the greater its potential for 
harm as well” (Kelly, 2010: 246). A failure to acknowledge this says much 
about living in the risk society and will have implications for the way we 
continue to define childhood and children’s interaction with Web 2.0 tech-
nologies and social media.

1. The CPS and ACPO signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2004. The 
MoU sets out the process by which indecent images of children are to be handled, 
so that the defence under Section 1B of Protection of Children Act 1978 can be 
relied upon. The MoU provides guidance to the Police Service, CPS and others 
involved in the Internet industry, in order to create the right balance between pro-
tecting children and effective investigation and prosecution of offences. Section 
46 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 creates a defence to the offence of “making” 
under the 1978 Act, where a person “making” such a photograph or pseudo-photo-
graph can prove that it was necessary to do so for the purposes of the prevention, 
detection or investigation of crime, or for the purposes of criminal proceedings.
