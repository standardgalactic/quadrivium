Introduction
Autodesk Inventor as a topic of learning is vast, with a wide scope. It is a package of many modules that 
deliver great value to enterprises. It offers a set of easy-to-use tools for designing, documenting, and 
simulating 3D models. Using this software, you can speed up the design process and reduce your product 
development costs.
This book provides a step-by-step approach for users to learn Autodesk Inventor. It is aimed at those 
with no previous experience with Inventor. However, users of previous versions of Inventor may find this 
book useful to learn about the new and enhanced features of Inventor 2018. You will be guided from starting 
an Autodesk Inventor 2018 session to creating parts, assemblies, and drawings. Each chapter explains the 
components with the help of real-world models.
Scope of This Book
This book was written for students and engineers who are interested in using Autodesk Inventor 2018 to 
design mechanical components and assemblies and then create drawings.
This book provides a step-by-step approach for learning Autodesk Inventor 2018. The chapters cover 
the following topics:
• 
Chapter 1 introduces Autodesk Inventor. The user interface and terminology are 
discussed in this chapter.
• 
Chapter 2 takes you through the creation of your first Inventor model. You create 
simple parts.
• 
Chapter 3 teaches you to create assemblies. It explains the top-down and bottom-up 
approaches for designing an assembly. You create an assembly using the bottom-up 
approach.
• 
Chapter 4 teaches you to create drawings of the models created in the earlier 
chapters. You also place exploded views and the part list of an assembly.
• 
Chapter 5 teaches you how to use additional modeling tools to create complex 
models.
• 
Chapter 6 introduces you to sheet metal modeling. You create a sheet metal part 
using the tools available in the Sheet Metal environment.
• 
Chapter 7 teaches you to create top-down assemblies. It also introduces you to 
creating mechanisms by applying joints between the parts.
• 
Chapter 8 teaches you to apply dimensions and annotations to a 2D drawing.
• 
Chapter 9 teaches you to add 3D annotations and tolerances to a 3D model.

CHAPTER 1
Getting Started with Autodesk 
Inventor 2018
This chapter covers the most commonly used features of Autodesk Inventor.
In this chapter, you will do the following:
• 
Understand the Inventor terminology
• 
Start a new file
• 
Understand the user interface
• 
Understand different environments in Inventor
In this chapter, you will learn some of the most commonly used features of Autodesk Inventor.  
In addition, you will learn about the user interface.
In Autodesk Inventor, you create 3D parts and use them to create 2D drawings and 3D assemblies. 
Inventor is feature-based. Features are shapes that are combined to build a part. You can modify these 
shapes individually.

Chapter 1 ■ Getting Started with Autodesk Inventor 2018
2
Most of the features are sketch-based. A sketch is a 2D profile and can be extruded, revolved, or swept 
along a path to create features.
Inventor is parametric in nature. You can specify standard parameters between the elements. 
Changing these parameters changes the size and shape of the part. For example, see the following design of 
the body of a flange before and after modifying the parameters of its features:
Starting Autodesk Inventor

Chapter 2 ■ Part Modeling Basics
18
	
6.	
Press Esc to deactivate the tool.
Adding Dimensions
In this section, you will specify the size of the sketched circle by adding dimensions. As you add dimensions, 
the sketch can attain any one of the following states:
• 
Fully constrained sketch: In a fully constrained sketch, the positions of all the entities 
are fully described by dimensions, constraints, or both. In a fully constrained sketch, 
all the entities are dark blue color.
• 
Under-constrained sketch: Additional dimensions, constraints, or both are needed 
to completely specify the geometry. In this state, you can drag under-constrained 
sketch entities to modify the sketch. An under-constrained sketch entity is displayed 
in black.
If you add any more dimensions to a fully constrained sketch, a message box will appear showing that 
dimension over constrains the sketch. In addition, it prompts you to convert the dimension into a driven 
dimension. Click Accept to convert the unwanted dimension into a driven dimension.
	
1.

CHAPTER 3
Assembly Basics
In this chapter, you will do the following:
• 
Add components to an assembly
• 
Apply constraints between components
• 
Check the degrees of freedom
• 
Check the interference
• 
Create an exploded view of the assembly
Tutorial 1
This tutorial takes you through the creation of your first assembly. You will create the Oldham coupling 
assembly shown here:

Chapter 3 ■ Assembly Basics
54
There are two ways of creating any assembly model.
• 
Top-down approach
• 
Bottom-up approach
Top-Down Approach
In a top-down approach, the assembly file is created first, and components are created in that file.
Bottom-Up Approach
In a bottom-up approach, the components are created first and then added to the assembly file. In this 
tutorial, you will create the assembly using this approach.
Starting a New Assembly File
To start a new assembly file, click the Assembly icon on the Home screen.

Applying Constraints
After adding the components to the assembly environment, you need to apply constraints between them. By 
applying constraints, you establish relationships between components.
	
1.	
To apply constraints, click Assemble ➤ Relationships ➤ Constrain on the 
ribbon.

Chapter 3 ■ Assembly Basics
57
The Place Component dialog appears on the screen.
Different assembly constraints that can be applied using this dialog are given next.

58
Note that if you set the solution to Flush, the faces will point in the same direction.
You can also align the centerlines of the cylindrical faces.

Chapter 3 ■ Assembly Basics
59
Angle applies the angle constraint between two components.

Chapter 3 ■ Assembly Basics
60
The Tangent constraint is used to apply a tangent relation between two faces.

Chapter 3 ■ Assembly Basics
61
The Insert constraint is used to make two cylindrical faces coaxial. In addition, the planar faces of the 
cylindrical components will be on the same plane.

Chapter 3 ■ Assembly Basics
62
The Symmetry constraint is used to position the two components symmetrically about a plane.

CHAPTER 9
Model-Based Dimensioning
Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing
During the manufacturing process, the accuracy of a part is an important factor. However, it is impossible 
to manufacture a part with the exact dimensions. Therefore, while applying dimensions to a drawing, you 
need to provide some dimensional tolerances that lie within acceptable limits. The following figure shows an 
example of dimensional tolerances applied to the drawing:
The dimensional tolerances help you to manufacture the component within a specific size range. 
However, the dimensional tolerances are not sufficient for manufacturing a component. You must give 
tolerance values to its shape, orientation, and position as well. The following figure shows a note, which is 
used to explain the tolerance value given to the shape of the object:

Chapter 9 ■ Model-Based Dimensioning
384
Providing a note in a drawing may be confusing. To avoid this, you can use Geometric Dimensioning 
and Tolerancing (GD&T) symbols to specify the tolerance values to shape, orientation, and position of a 
component. The following figure shows the same example represented with GD&T symbols. In this figure, 
the vertical face to which the tolerance frame is connected must be within two parallel planes 0.08 apart and 
perpendicular to the datum reference (horizontal plane).
Providing GD&T in 2D drawings is a common and well-known method. You can provide GD&T 
information to 3D models as well. The tools available on the Annotate tab of the ribbon help you to add 
GD&T information to 3D models based on universal standards such as ASME Y14.41-2003 and ISO 16792: 
2006. However, you can add GD&T information based on your custom standard as well.
In this chapter, you will learn to use Annotate tools to add GD&T information to the part models. There 
are many ways to add GD&T information and full-define the parts and assemblies. There are few methods 
explained in this chapter, but you need to use a method that is most suitable to your design.
