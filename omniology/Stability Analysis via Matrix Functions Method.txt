STABILITY ANALYSIS OF STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS
4.1 Introduction
The impact estimation of perturbations, both determined and random ones,
is of a great importance for the functioning of real physical systems. There-
fore, it is reasonable to consider systems modeled by stochastic diﬀerential
equations. The present chapter deals with the various types of probabi-
lity stability for the above mentioned type of equations and develops the
method of matrix-valued Liapunov functions with reference to the system of
equations of Kats-Krasovskii’s form [82] and Ito’s form [78]. In the chapter
suﬃcient conditions are formulated for stability and asymptotic stability
with respect to probability, global stability with respect to probability, etc.
The notion of averaged derivative of matrix-valued Liapunov function
along solutions of the system that has the meaning of inﬁnitesimal operator
[34] is crucial in the investigations of this chapter. In a large number of
cases this operator deﬁnes unequivocally a random Markov process that
models the perturbation in the system.
4.2 Stochastic Systems of Diﬀerential Equations in General
4.2.1 Notations
For the convenience of readers we collect the following additional nomen-
clature.
Let Rn be an n-dimensional Euclidean space with norm ·, ∇u = ∂/∂u,
∇uv = ∂2/∂u∂v, where u and v can be either scalars or vectors.
For
instance, if x ∈Rn and v ∈Rm →R, then ∇xv denotes the gradient
of vector v and ∇xxv is a matrix with elements ∂2v/∂xi∂xj, i, j ∈[1, n].

Stability Analysis of Stochastic Systems
Let T = R+ = [0, +∞) and (Ω, A, P) denote a probability space with
probability measure P, deﬁned on the σ-algebra A of ω-sets (ω ∈Ω) in the
sample space Ω. Every A measurable function on Ωis said to be random
variable. A sequence of the random variables designated by {x(t), t ∈T }
is called a random process with parameter value t from T . We designate by
R[T , R[Ω, Rn]] the class of random processes deﬁned on T with the values
in R[Ω, Rn]. Random function x ∈R[[a, b]: R[Ω, Rn]] is called measurable
on the product, provided that x(t, ω) is a function measurable on (A′ × A)
and deﬁned on [a, b] × Ωwith the values in Rn, where A′ designates the
σ-algebra of measurable in the sense of Lebesque sets on [a, b].
For the set A ∈A, P(A) denotes the probability of event A and P(A/B)
means the conditional probability of event A under condition B ∈A. Func-
tion x(t, ω) is called continuous with respect to t ∈[a, b] if

Stability Analysis of Stochastic Systems
Here x ∈Rn, t ∈T (or t ∈Tτ = [τ, +∞), τ ≥0), y(t) is a perturbation
vector that can take the values from Y ⊂Rn for every t ∈T .
We assume that the vector function f is continuous with respect to every
variable and satisﬁes Lipschitz condition in variable x, i.e.
f(t, x′, y) −f(t, x′′, y) ≤Lx′ −x′′
in domain B(T , ρ, Y ): t ∈T , x < ρ, y ∈Y (ρ = const or ρ = +∞)
uniformly in t ∈T and y ∈Y , and is bounded for all (t, y) ∈T × Y in
every bounded domain x < ρ∗(ρ∗= const > 0).
Moreover, we assume that
(4.2.4)
f(t, 0, y(t)) = 0
∀(t, y) ∈T × Y,
i.e. the unperturbed motion of system (4.2.1) corresponds to the solution
x(t) ≡0.
In system (4.2.1) the random perturbation y(t) is considered to be a
random Markov process (see e.g. Doob [31] and Dynkin [34]). Further, two
main types of random Markov functions are under consideration.
Case A. The vector y(t) consists of components ys, s = 1, 2, . . ., r
which are independent of each others pure discontinuous Markov processes,
the transition functions P{y, τ; A, t} of which admit the expansion
P{ys(t + ∆t) ≤β, ys(t + ∆t) = η | ys(t) = η}
= qs(t, η, β)∆t + o(∆t),
(4.2.5)
P{ys(τ) ≡η, t < τ ≤t + ∆t | ys(t) = η}
= 1 −˜qs(t, η)∆t + o(∆t).
(4.2.6)
Here o(∆t) is an inﬁnitesimal value of the highest order of smallness
relatively ∆t, qs(t, η, β) and ˜qs(t, η) are some known functions such that
qs(t, η, ∞) = ˜qs(t, η),
s = 1, 2, . . . , r.
In general we assume almost all realizations ys(t, ω) of random process y(t)
to be piecewise constant functions continuous from the right.
It should be noted that if the set Y = {y1, . . . , yk} is one-dimensional
and ﬁnite, then the representation of functions q(t, η, β) and ˜q(t, η) means
the representation of transition matrix
(4.2.7)
pij(t + ∆t) = q(t, i, j)∆t + o(∆t),
i = j

where pij(t, t + ∆t) is a probability of transition yi →yj during the time
from t to t + ∆t.
The process y(t) is called a homogeneous Markov chain with a ﬁnite
number of states, if q(t, i, j) = ˜q(i, j).
Case B. Vector y(t) is a solution of the generalized diﬀerential Ito equa-
tion (see e.g. Arnold [5] or Gikhman and Skorokhod [42]).
(4.2.8)
dy(t) = a(t, y(t))dt + b(t, y(t))dω(t) +

c(t, y(t), u)˜ν(dt, du)
Besides, a(t, y) and c(t, y, u) are r-component vectors with values in Rr,
y ∈Rr, u ∈Rr, b(t, y) is a r×m-matrix, ω(t) is a standard m-dimensional
Wienner process with independent coordinates, ˜γ(t, A) = ν(t, A) −tλ(A),
γ(t, A) is a Poisson measure in Rr having a compact carrier, Eν(t, A) =
tλ(A), the process ω(t) and the measure ν(t, A) are independent of each
other.
For the existence conditions with only probability 1 and continuous from
the right solution of the equation (4.2.8) see Gikhman and Skorokhod [42].
Following Kats and Krasovskii [82] we shall use the following descriptive
interpretation of the solution of (4.2.1). Let almost every realization y(t, ω)
of a random process y(t) and the initial condition (4.2.2), (4.2.3) generate
completely continuous realization x(t, ω) of solutions to the equation
(4.2.9)
dx
dt = f(t, x, y(t, ω))
lying in the domain B(T , ρ, Y ) and continuable on Tτ = [τ, +∞).
Then, the set of these realizations forms an (n + r)-dimensional ran-
dom Markov process {x(t), y(t)} that will be referred to as the solution of
equations (4.2.1) satisfying conditions (4.2.2) and (4.2.3).
4.2.2.2 Equation of Ito Form. We consider the equation
(4.2.10)
dx = f(t, x)dt + σ(t, x)dy(t),
where t ∈T , xt ∈Rn, f : T × Rn →Rn, σ: T × Rn →Rn×m and
{y(t), t ∈T } is a Markov process with independent increments. The sys-
tem of the equations (4.2.10) is perturbed by two speciﬁc types of stochastic
processes.
Case C. {y(t), t ∈T }
∆= {zt, t ∈T } is a normed m-dimensional Wien-
ner process with independent components.

Stability Analysis of Stochastic Systems
Case D. {y(t), t ∈T }
∆= {qt, t ∈T } is a normed m-dimensional dis-
continuous Poisson process with independent components.
For the physical interpretation of equation (4.2.10) see e.g. Arnold [5],
Kushner [90], et al. Functions f and σ are assumed to be smooth enough
and there exists a separable and measurable Markov process {xt, t ∈T }
satisfying system (4.2.10), that is completely continuous with probability 1.
4.2.3 The Concept of Probability Stability
The notions of probability stability are obtained in terms of Deﬁnitions
1.2.1–1.2.3 by replacement of ordinary convergence x →0, used there,
by various types of the probability convergence (convergence with respect
to probability, convergence in mean square or almost probable stability).
Before we introduce the deﬁnitions let us pay attention to the following.
Let the process y(t) be deﬁned by Ito equation (4.2.8). Moreover, equa-
tions (4.2.1) and (4.2.8) and initial conditions (4.2.2) and (4.2.3) generate
(n + r)-dimensional Markov process {xt, y(t)}.
If x(t0) = 0, then we have with probability 1 that x(t) = 0 for all t ∈T
and, therefore, the vector function {0, y(t)} is a solution of this system. Let
y(t) ∈Y for all t ∈T , and the set D = {0, Y } is a time-invariant set for
the process {xt, y(t)} in the sense that
P{ {x(t), y(t)} ∈D | x(t0) = x0, y(t0) = y0} = 1
for {x0, y0} ∈D.
Similar equality is valid for the processes {x(t), y(t)} generated by pure
discontinuous Markov functions y(t). Therefore, the notion of probability
stability discussed herein is based on the stability of an invariant set, for
instance D = {0, Y }.
Definition 4.2.1. The state x = 0 of the system (4.2.1) is:
(i) stable in probability with respect to Ti if and only if for every t0 ∈Ti
and every ε > 0, and 1 > p > 0 there exists δ(t0, ε) > 0, such that

does not characterize separate realizations of the process {x(t), y(t)}. I.e.
the solution can satisfy the condition (4.2.13), though at the same time
almost all realizations may not leave the domain x < ε (at various
times). Therefore, following Kats and Krasovskii [82] we consider inequality
(4.2.12) instead of (4.2.13).
Remark 4.2.2. The probabilities mentioned in Deﬁnitions 4.2.1–4.2.3
are not speciﬁed in the general case by the ﬁnite dimensional distributions
of the process {x(t), y(t)} and may not exist. However, it is known (see
Doob [31]) that a separable modiﬁcation of the process {x(t), y(t)} can be
considered, having with probability 1 the realization continuous from the
right. In this case all realizations in question have the meaning.
4.2.4 Stochastic Matrix-Valued Liapunov Function
We relate with the system (4.2.1) the stochastic matrix-valued function
(4.2.14)
Π(t, x, y(t)) = [vkl(t, x, y(t))],
k, l ∈[1, s]
where (t, x, y) ∈B and vkl(t, 0, y(t)) ≡0 ∀t ∈T and y ∈Y , and, besides,
vkl(t, ·) = vlk(t, ·) ∀(k = l) ∈[1, s], vkl ∈C(T × Rn × Y, R [Y, R]).
Similar to the determined case (see Chapter 2) the property of having a
ﬁxed sign of matrix-valued stochastic function (4.2.14) is of importance in
the stability investigation of a stochastic system (4.2.1).
The concept of the property of having a ﬁxed sign must correspond to
(1) the property of having a ﬁxed sign of stochastic matrix;
(2) the property of having a ﬁxed sign of scalar stochastic Liapunov
function;
(3) the construction of direct Liapunov method for stochastic systems.

Stability Analysis of Stochastic Systems
To achieve this we act as follows.
Let z ∈Rs and function V ∈C(T × Rn × Y s × Rs, R [Y, R]) be deﬁned
by the formula
(4.2.15)
V (t, x, y, z) = zTΠ(t, x, y(t))z.
In view of Deﬁnitions 2.2.1–2.2.2 we present some deﬁnitions for stochastic
matrix-valued Liapunov function.
Definition 4.2.4. The stochastic matrix-valued function
Π: R+×
B(ρ) × Y →R [Y, Rs×s] is referred to as
(i) positive (negative) deﬁnite, if and only if there exists a time-inva-
riant connected neighborhood N of point x = 0 (N ⊆Rn) and
positive deﬁnite in the sense of Liapunov function w(x) such that
(a) Π is continuous, i.e. Π ∈C(R+ × N × Y, R [Y, Rs×s])
(b) Π(t, 0, y) = 0 ∀t ∈R+ and y ∈Y ;
(c) inf V (t, x, y, z) = w(x) ∀(t, y, z) ∈R+ × Y × Rs;
(sup V (t, x, y, z) = −w(x) ∀(t, y, z) ∈R+ × Y × Rs);
(ii) positive (negative) deﬁnite on S, if and only if all conditions of
Deﬁnition 4.2.4 (i) are satisﬁed for N = S;
(iii) positive (negative) deﬁnite in the whole, if and only if all conditions
of Deﬁnition 4.2.4 (i) are satisﬁed for N = Rn.
Remark 4.2.3. If function Π does not depend on t ∈R+, then in
Deﬁnition 4.2.4 the requirement of function w(x) existence is omitted and
conditions (a)–(c) are modiﬁed, and condition (c) becomes
(c′) V (x, y, z) = zTΠ(x, y)z > 0 ∀(x = 0, z = 0, y) ∈N × Rs × Y ,
(V (x, y, z) < 0 ∀(x = 0, z = 0, y) ∈N × Rs × Y ).
Definition 4.2.5. The stochastic matrix-valued function Π: R+×B(ρ)
×Y →R [Y, Rs×s] is referred to as
(i) positive semi-deﬁnite, if and only if there exist a time-invariant con-
nected neighborhood N of point x = 0 (N ⊆Rn) such that
(a) Π is continuous in (t, x) ∈R+ × N;
(b) Π is non-negative on N : zTΠ(t, x, y)z ≥0 ∀(t, x, y) ∈R+ ×
N × Y .
(c) Π vanishes at the origin zTΠ(t, 0, y)z = 0 ∀(z = 0, y ∈Y );
(ii) positive semi-deﬁnite on R+ × S × Y

uT = (ϕ1(p), ψ1(q), χ1(r)),
wT = (ϕ2(p), ψ2(q), χ2(r))
and A1 = [αkl], A2 = [αkl], H = diag (η1, η2, η2).

from Assumption 4.2.1 into the form
V (t, x, y, η) =

Proposition 4.2.5. If in the bilateral estimate (4.2.20)
(1) the matrix HTA1H is positive deﬁnite (semi-deﬁnite);
(2) the matrix HTA2H is positive deﬁnite;
(3) the condition (1) is satisﬁed and functions ϕ1, ψ1, χ1 are of class

(2) decreasing;
(3) radially unbounded
respectively.

where
˜A1 = HTA1H.
In fact, since (ϕ1, ψ1, χ1) ∈K, then a function

Therefore,

for all (t, x, y) ∈R+ × N0 × Y .
Assertions (2) and (3) of Proposition 4.2.5 are proved similarly.
4.2.5 Structure of the Stochastic Matrix-Valued Function
Averaged Derivative
The averaged derivative, that is computed as in determined case without
integrating system (2.2.1), is analogous to the total derivative of matrix-
valued function for the stochastic system (4.2.1).
Let (τ, x, y) be a point in domain B(T , ρ, Y ).
Definition 4.2.8. Any of the limits

;
where E[ · | · ] is a conditional mathematical expectation, is called an
averaged derivative of stochastic matrix-valued function Π(t, x, y(t)) along
the solution of system (4.2.1) at point (τ, x, y). D∗E[Π] denotes the case,
when D+E[Π] and D+E[Π] are applicable.
The value D∗E[Π] is an averaged value of the stochastic matrix-valued
function Π(t, x, y) derivative along all realizations of process {x(t), y(t)}
initiating from point (x, y) at time τ. If
T +Π =

P{τ, x, y; t, du, dz}Π(t, u, z)
= E[Π(t, x(t), y(t)) | x(τ) = x, y(τ) = y],
where P{· · ·} is a transition function of solution to system (4.2.1) with the
initial conditions x(τ) = x, y(τ) = y, then

The right-side part of (4.2.22) and (4.2.23) is a weak inﬁnitesimal ope-

We shall present the formulas for D+E[Π] computation for various reali-
zations of the random process y(t).
1. Let in the system (4.2.1) the process y(t) be pure discontinuous and be
described by the relations (4.2.5) and (4.2.6). Then dE[Π]

of system (4.2.1) at point (τ, x, y) is computed as

Formula (4.2.30) is valid for the homogeneous Markov processes and
functions V independent of time (see Dynkin [34]) and for the processes
being considered here (see Kushner [90]).
Let Q ⊂Rn be a bounded open set and U = Q × Y
be a set from
which the process {x(t), y(t)} comes out for the ﬁrst time at time τ∗. It is
easy to notice that τm(t) = min {t, τ∗} is a Markov momentum, such that
Eτm(t) < +∞. Therefore, if {x(s), y(s)} ∈U, then

Stability Analysis of Stochastic Systems
The proof of this proposition is similar to the proof of Proposition
2.7.3.
Remark 4.2.5. Actually, the structure of the stochastic matrix-valued
function Π(t, x, y) averaged derivative is established by formula (4.2.33) and
is based on the stochastic SL-function (see Martynyuk [120]). The structure
of the stochastic matrix-valued function Π(t, x, y) averaged derivative is
somewhat diﬀerent provided the stochastic V L-function is applied, i.e.
(4.2.34)
L(t, x, y) = AΠ(t, x, y)b,
where A is a constant s × s-matrix and b is an s-vector.
4.3 Stability to Systems in Kats–Krasovskii Form
In terms of the stochastic matrix-valued function Π(t, x, y) constructed for
system (4.2.1), the criteria of stability with respect to probability are in
form similar to Theorems 2.3.1–2.3.3.

Theorem 4.3.1. Let the equations of perturbed motion (4.2.1) are such
that:
(1) there exists a matrix-valued function Π: R+×B(p)×Y →R[Y, Rs×s]
in the time-invariant neighborhood N ⊆Rn of equilibrium state
x = 0;
(2) there exists a vector η ∈Rs (η ∈Rs
+);
(3) stochastic scalar function (4.2.19) is positive deﬁnite;
(4) the averaged derivative (4.2.25) is negative deﬁnite or negative semi-
deﬁnite.
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of system (4.2.1) is stable with respect to
probability.
Proof. Let arbitrary numbers ε ∈(0, ρ), ρ ∈(0, 1) and t0 ∈R+ be
given. Under the conditions (1)–(2) of Theorem 4.3.1 we have the function
V (t, x, y, η) = ηTΠ(t, x, y)η,
η ∈Rs
(η ∈Rs
+),
that is positive deﬁnite by condition (3) of Theorem 4.3.1. Therefore, a
number ε1 > 0 is found, such that
inf V (t, x, y, η) = ε1
for
t ∈R+,
x ≥ε,
y ∈Y,
η ∈Rs
(η ∈Rs
+).
We designate B(ε) = {(x, y) ∈Rn × Y : x < ε, y ∈Y }.
Let τε be
the time of trajectory (x(t), y(t)) ﬁrst leaving the domain B(ε) and let
τε(τ) = min (τ, τε). We have by condition (4)
(4.3.1)
E[V (τε(τ), x(τε(τ)), y(τε(τ)), η) | x(t0) = x0, y(t0) = y0]
≤V (t0, x0, y0, η).
Now we take δ > 0 so that
(4.3.2)
sup V (t0, x, y0) < pε1
whenever x ≤δ.
The estimates (4.3.1) and (4.3.2) imply
pε1 > V (t0, x0, y0, η) ≥E[V (τε(τ), x(τε(t)), y(τε(τ)), η) | x0, y0]

Proof. Let a number p(H) < 1 be given. Theorem 4.3.1 implies that
under the conditions of Theorem 4.3.2 the equilibrium state x = 0 of
system (4.2.1) is stable with respect to probability.
Therefore, for any
ε ∈(0, ρ) and t0 ≥0 a δ = δ(t0, ε) > 0 can be found such that

Let us show that the number H0 mentioned in conditions of Theo-

We claim that there exists a τ > t0 such that
(4.3.6)
P{x(t0 + τ) < γ1 | x0, y0} > 1 −1

If this is not true, then for trajectory {x(t), y(t)} the inequality

holds, that yields by condition (3) of Theorem 4.3.2
(4.3.7)

Here τα(t) = min (τ ∗, t), where τ∗is a time of trajectory (x(t), y(t)) ﬁrst
leaving the set B1 = {(x, y): γ1 < x < ε, y ∈Y }.
Since the function Π(t, x, y) is positive deﬁnite, the correlation (4.3.7)
can not be satisﬁed. This proves inequality (4.3.6). The estimates (4.3.3),
(4.3.5) and (4.3.6) imply that for arbitrary q > 0 a τ > 0 is found so that

This proves Theorem 4.3.2.
Theorem 4.3.3. Let the equations of perturbed motion (4.2.1) are such
that:
(1) hypotheses (1), (2) and (3) of the Theorem 4.3.1 are satisﬁed for
N = Rn;
(2) the function Π(t, x, y) is positive deﬁnite in the whole and radially
unbounded;
(3) the averaged derivative dE[V ]
dt
is negative deﬁnite in B(T , ∞, Y ).
Then the equilibrium state x = 0 of the system (4.2.1) is stable with respect
to probability in the whole.
A theorem allowing us to ﬁnd asymptotic stability with respect to pro-
bability and stability with respect to probability in the whole on the basis
of negative semi-deﬁnite averaged derivative is considered.

4.4 Stability to Systems in Ito’s Form
4.4.1 Decomposition of perturbed motion equations
We consider a system of the equations with random parameters in the form
(4.4.1)
dω(t) = f(t, ω)dt + σ(t, ω)dξ(t),
where t ∈T , ω ∈Rn, f : T × Rn →Rn, σ: T × Rn →Rn×m, and
{ξ(t), t ∈T } is an independent measurable random Markov process.
Assume that the system (4.4.1) allows decomposition into l intercon-
nected subsystems that can be described by equations in the form
(4.4.2)
dωi =fi(t, ωi)dt + σii(t, ωi)dξi
+ gi(t, ω)dt +
l

j=1
σij(t, ωj)dξj,
i ∈[1, l].
Each interconnected subsystem (4.4.2) consists of the independent subsys-
tem
(4.4.3)
dωi = f(t, ωi)dt + σii(t, ωi)dξi,
i ∈[1, l],
and link functions
(4.4.4)
gi(t, ω)dt +
l

j=1
σij(t, ωj)dξj,
i ∈[1, l].
Here ωi ∈Rni, ω ∈Rn, ω = (ωT

l )T, ξi ∈Rmi, fi : T0 ×
Rni →Rni, σij : T × Rnj →Rni×mj, gi : T × Rn1 × · · · × Rnl →Rni, and
{ξi(t), t ∈T } are independent measurable Markov processes.
We assume on function fi and σii that they satisfy the existence condi-
tion for solutions to subsystems (4.4.3), and link functions (4.4.4) vanish,
if and only if ωj = 0 and ω = 0. Thus, the points ω = 0 and ωj = 0,
j ∈[1, l] are the only equilibrium states of systems (4.4.1), (4.4.2) and
(4.4.3) respectively.

4.4.2 Structure of the Hierarchical Matrix-Valued Function
Averaged Derivative
We construct for subsystems (4.4.3) the functions vii(t, ωi), i ∈[1, l] and for
couples (i, j) of subsystems (4.4.7) the functions vij(t, ωij) (i < j) ∈[1, l].
Let us construct from the above mentioned elements the matrix-valued

Π(t, ω) = [vij(t, ·)],
where Π: T × Rni × Rnj × Y →R[Y, Rl×l].
The function (4.4.9) reﬂects the hierarchy of stochastic subsystems
(4.4.3) and (4.4.7) in the large-scale system (4.4.1).
The application of formula (4.2.27) to systems (4.4.2) and (4.4.6) yields

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Remark 4.4.3. If, in particular, σij(t, ω) = 0 for all i = j, then

adequately the hierarchical dependence of subsystems in large-scale system
(4.4.1).

Assumption 4.4.3. The system (4.4.1) allows ﬁrst and second level
decompositions and

Remark 4.4.4. If for the system (4.4.1) there exist p and q (p < q) ∈
[1, l] for which no free couple (p, q) of (4.4.7) can be found, then we take
vpq(t, xpq) ≡0.

Stability Analysis of Stochastic Systems
Namely, we shall prove the following result.
Theorem 4.4.1. Let the perturbed motion of the equation (4.4.1) are
such that:
(1) {ξ(t), t ∈T } is a normalized Wienner process and σij(t, ω) = 0,
∀(i, j) ∈[1, l];
(2) all conditions of Assumptions 4.4.1–4.4.4 are satisﬁed
(3) the matrix S is
(a) negative semi-deﬁnite;
(b) negative deﬁnite.
Then the equilibrium state ω = 0 of system (4.4.1) is
(a) stable in probability;
(b) asymptotically stable in probability.
Proof. We take the functions vij(t, ·) according to Assumption 4.4.1
and a vector η ∈Rl
+, η > 0. The function (4.4.14) in coordinate form is

Hence
(4.4.19)

is negative semi-deﬁnite for all t ∈T and ω ∈N.
Thus all conditions of Theorem 4.3.1 from Section 4.3 are satisﬁed, and
the equilibrium state ω = 0 of system (4.4.1) is stable in probability.
To verify assertion (b) of Theorem 4.4.1 it is suﬃcient to note that
under condition (3)(b) in the estimate (4.4.18) λM < 0. Then according
to inequality (4.4.19) all hypotheses of Theorem 4.3.2 are satisﬁed and
the equilibrium state ω = 0 of system (4.4.1) is asymptotically stable in
probability.
The Theorem 4.4.1 is proved.
Assumption 4.4.5. The system (4.4.1) allows the ﬁrst and the second
level decompositions and
(1) independent subsystems (4.4.3) possess the property Bj(∞), j ∈
[1, l];
(2) independent couples (i, j) of the subsystems (4.4.7) possess the
property Aij(∞), ∀(i = j) ∈[1, l].
Theorem 4.4.2. Let the perturbed motion of the equations (4.4.1) are
such that
(1) {ξ(t), t ∈T } is a normalized process and σij(t, ωj) = 0 ∀(i, j) ∈
[1, l];
(2) all conditions of Assumption 4.4.5 are satisﬁed;
(3) the conditions of Assumption 4.4.4 are satisﬁed for Ni = Rni,
Ni × Nj = Rni × Rnj with functions ϕi3 ∈KR, i ∈[1, l];
(4) the matrix S is negative deﬁnite.
Then, the equilibrium state ω = 0 of system (4.4.1) is asymptotically stable
in probability in the whole.
Proof. Under the conditions of Assumption 4.4.5 the function (4.4.14)
satisﬁes estimates (4.2.20) and its averaged derivative (4.2.27) satisﬁes in-
equality (4.4.18) where functions ψi3 ∈KR. In consequence of condition (4)
of Theorem 4.4.2 and estimate (4.4.19), dE[V (t, ω)]
dt
is negative deﬁnite for
all t ∈T and ω ∈Rn. Thus, all conditions of Theorem 4.3.3 are satisﬁed
and the equilibrium state ω = 0 of system (4.4.1) is asymptotically stable
in probability in the whole.

Remark 4.4.5. If for the perturbed motion the equations (4.4.1) are

4.5.1 Stochastic Version of the Lefschetz Problem

dq
dt = X(t, 0, q, y(t)) + G(t, p, q, y(t)),
where p ∈Rn1, q ∈Rn2, X ∈C[T0 × Bp, R[Ω, Rn1]], Y ∈C[T0 × Bq,
R[Ω, Rn2]], F ∈C[T0 × B, R[Ω, Rn1]], G ∈C[T0 × B, R[Ω, Rn2]], X, F, Y ,
G vanish if and only if p = 0 and q = 0 respectively.
Assumption 4.5.1. There exist time-invariant neighborhoods Np ⊆

Thus, under conditions (4.5.10) the function (4.5.9) is positive deﬁnite,
and when inequalities (a)–(c) are satisﬁed its averaged derivative (4.5.11)
is negative deﬁnite.
Applying Theorem 4.3.3 we conclude that conditions (4.5.10) and
(a)–(c) are suﬃcient for stability in probability in the whole of the equilib-
rium state p = q = r = 0 of oscillating system (4.5.7).

where u = (∥ω1∥, . . . , ∥ωl∥)T. Under the condition (3) of Theorem 4.5.2 the
averaged derivative (4.5.24) is negative semi-deﬁnite or negative deﬁnite.
According to Theorem 4.3.4 the Theorem 4.5.2 is proved.
4.6 Notes
4.1. General outlines on probability theory and theory of stochastic pro-
cesses can be found in the books by Doob [31], Gikhman and Skorokhod [42],
Dynkin [34], etc. The problems of stochastic stability are presented in a
number of monographs (see e.g. Kushner [90], Arnold [5], Khasminskii [83],
Michel and Miller [143], Ladde and Lakshmikantham [91], etc.). In these
investigations the second Liapunov method is further developed with inter-
esting applications.
4.2. Stochastic system in the form of (4.2.1) is called here the Kats–
Krasovskii form with reference to Kats and Krasovskii [82] where it was
introduced.
Basic deﬁnitions of stochastic stability are formulated as the genera-
lization of Deﬁnitions 2.2.1—2.2.4 from Chapter 2 for stochastic systems.
Stochastic matrix-valued function is introduced according to Martynyuk
[115] and averaged derivative is due to Kats and Krasovskii [82] and Mar-
tynyuk [115].
4.3. Theorems 4.3.1–4.3.4 are due to Martynyuk [115].
4.4. Theorems 4.4.1, 4.4.2 are taken from Azimov and Martynyuk [8]
and Azimov [6].
4.5. Stochastic version of the Lefschetz [100] problem is presented ac-
cording to Martynyuk [115]. Oscillating system (4.5.7) was investigated by
Azimov and Martynyuk [8], and system of automatic control (4.5.14) was
considered by Azimov [7].

SOME MODELS OF REAL WORLD PHENOMENA
5.1 Introduction
This chapter contains several examples of real world phenomena that illus-
trate the versatility and applicability of the matrix-valued Liapunov func-
tions in stability investigation of its equilibrium state.
Section 5.2 deals with mathematical models in population. The neigh-
borhood of the non-trivial equilibrium state is investigated in the general
case for a predator-prey system and estimates of stability, asymptotic sta-
bility and instability domains are found in this section.
In Section 5.3 the model of an orbital astronomical observatory is con-
sidered. Conditions are established under which the whole system is stable
even though its separate subsystem are unstable.
In Section 5.4 we discuss a power system model consisting of N gen-
erators.
General conditions are speciﬁed for asymptotic stability of the
equilibrium state of such a system to be applicable in the case of 3, 5
and 7 generators to obtain the system parameters such that the system
is asymptotically stable, while the method of scalar or vector Liapunov
functions have failed to work herein.
Finally, in Section 5.5 the motion in space of winged aircraft is treated.

analysis. The models are based on certain simplifying assumptions as stated
below.
(1) The density of a species, that is, the number of individuals per unit
area, can be represented by a single variable, when diﬀerences of
age, sex and genotype are ignored.
(2) Crowding aﬀects all population members equally. This is unlikely
to be true if the members of the species occur in clumps rather than
being evently distributed throughout the available space.
(3) The aﬀects of interactions within and between species are instanta-
neous. This means that there is no delayed action on the dynamics
of the population.
(4) Abiotic environmental factors are suﬃciently constant.
(5) Population growth rate is density-dependent even at the lowest den-
sities. It may be more reasonable to suppose that there is some
threshold density below which individuals do not interfere with one
another.
(6) The females in a sexually reproducing population always ﬁnd mates,
even though the density may be low.
The assumptions relative to density dependency and crowding aﬀects
the fact that the growth of any species in a restricted environment must
eventually be limited by a shortage of resources.
5.2.1 Competition
For simplicity, let us ﬁrst consider a two-species community model living
together and competing with each other for the same limiting resources.
Under assumptions (1)–(6), a mathematical model of population growth of
two competing species is described by
(5.2.1)
dx1
dt = x1(a1 −b11x1 −b12x2),
dx2
dt = x2(a2 −b21x1 −b22x2),
where xi is the population density of species i for i = 1, 2 and for i, j =
1, 2, ai, bij are positive constants. These equations are derived from the
Verhulst-Pearl logistic equation
(5.2.2)
dxi
dt = xi(ai −biixi),
i = 1, 2,

Some Models of Real World Phenomena
by including the additional terms −bijxj for i, j = 1, 2 and i = j to
describe the inhibiting eﬀects of each species on its competior. The logistic
equation is best regarded as a purely descriptive equation.
The important features of (5.2.2) are:
(a) The species increase exponentially whenever they are isolated.
(b) They approach their equilibrium without oscillations in the absence
of its competitor.
In (5.2.1), for i = 1, 2 aixi can be interpreted as the potential rate of
increase that the i th species would grow if the resources were unlimited
and intra/inter-speciﬁc eﬀects are neglected. Here ai is the intrinsic rate of
natural increase of the i th species, ai/bii = ki is referred as the carrying
capacity if the i th species. From this (5.2.2) can be written as
(5.2.3)

.
We observe that the per capita growth rate
 dxi

xi will be negative
or positive depending on the population density xi > ki or xi < ki. Thus
the constants ki determine the saturation level of population densities.
5.2.2 Predator-Prey
In the community of competing species, each species inhibits the multiplica-
tion of the other species. In a community of two species in which one species
is a parasite or predator and the other its host or prey, a diﬀerent form of in-
teraction between these two species takes place. The mathematical models
for host-parasite and predator-prey systems are equivalent. Obviously, the
more abundant the prey, the more opportunities there are for the predator
to breed. However, as the predator population grows, the number of prey
eaten by the predator increases.
To formulate the mathematical model
describing the predator-prey interaction between two species, we assume
the following: (a) in the absence of a predator, the prey species satisﬁes
assumptions (1)–(6) and (b) the predator cannot survive without the pres-
ence of prey and the rate at which prey are eaten is proportional to the
product of the densities of predator and prey. Under these assumptions,
a mathematical model describing the predator-prey interaction between a

Some Models of Real World Phenomena
prey and a predator in a given community is given by
(5.2.4)
dx1
dt = x1(a1 −b11x1 −b12x2),
dx2
dt = x2(−a2 + b21x1),
where x1 is prey density and x2 is predator density and a1, a2, b11, b21 are
positive constants.
From the foregoing discussion with regard to the two-species competi-
tion model and the predator-prey model, we can readily generalize to n
interacting species so that the general model is described by
(5.2.5)

j=1
bijxj

,
xi(0) = xi0 ≥0,
where xi is density of the i th species in the community, ai, −bii are positive
constants and bij, i = j, are constants with any sign. Any arbitrary sign
for bij, i = j, allows us a greater ﬂexibility for the interactions between the
i th and j th species in the community. For example, in a competitive model,
bij, bji, i = j, are both negative, while for a predator-prey model, bij, bji,
i = j, are of opposite signs. In a model for commensalism (symbiosis),
bij, bji, i = j, are both positive.
The system (5.2.5) is represented in the vector form
(5.2.6)
dx
dt = X(a + Bx),
x(0) = x0 ≤0
and decomposed into two subsystems
(5.2.7)

Some Models of Real World Phenomena
From (5.2.8) it is easy to conclude that x = 0 is an equilibrium which is
not interesting and so, we must assume that X = 0. In this case (5.2.8)
reduces to
(5.2.9)
a + Bx = 0,
where B is an n by n matrix and a is an n-vector.
We assume that there exists an equilibrium population x∗> 0 as a
positive solution
(5.2.10)
x∗= −B−1a
of (5.2.9). This assumption is consistent with consideration of community
stability. In the case when b has all oﬀ-diagonal elements non-negative,
that is B is a Metzler matrix, then it is known that stability of B implies
x∗> 0.
It is possible to show that for a Metzler matrix B, the quasi-
dominant diagonal condition
(5.2.11)

n

i=1
i=j
di|bij|
with di > 0, is equivalent to saying that −B−1 is non-negative and since
B−1 cannot have a row of zeros, positivity of the vector a implies positivity
of x∗.
If B is a Metzler matrix, then an elegant solution of the problem on
stability of state x∗is obtained by means of the function

Our aim is to establish stability conditions for system (5.2.6) without
assuming matrix B being Metzler. This may be achived by decomposition
of system (5.2.6) with further application of the matrix-valued function.
By means of the Liapunov transformation
(5.2.12)
y = x −x∗
we reduce the system (5.2.7) to the form
(5.2.13)

the following estimates are valid

We have for (5.2.18) the estimate
(5.2.19)
D+V (y, η) ≤uT [C + G(y)] u,

G(y) = [σsj(y)],

Here c11, c22 are maximal eigenvalues of the matrices F11, F22; c12 is the
norm of matrix F12 and σsj(y) is the norm of matrix Gsj, s, j = 1, 2.
It follows from (5.2.18) that

Estimates (5.2.17), (5.2.19) and (5.2.20) yield the following assertion.
Proposition 5.2.1. The equilibrium state x∗of the system (5.2.6) is:
(1) Stable (asymptotically) in the domain Π1 (Π2) if the matrix D1 is
positive deﬁnite and the matrix C is negative deﬁnite.
(2) Unstable in the domain Π3 if the matrices D1 and C∗are positive
deﬁnite.
Proof. The fact that the matrix D1 is positive deﬁnite yields that
the function V (y) if positive deﬁnite for all y ∈Rn
+.
Since the matrix
C is negative deﬁnite, then by estimate (5.2.19) the function D+V (y) is
non-positive in the domain Π1. Hence all conditions of Theorem 2.3.3 are
satisﬁed, and the equilibrium state x∗is stable.
The other assertion of Proposition 5.2.1 follows from Theorem 2.3.7.
5.3 Model of Orbital Astronomic Observatory
According to Geiss, Cohen et al. [40] the orbital astronomic observatory
consists of following blocks:
(1) observatory vehicle
(2) observatory body
(3) compensation system
(4) engine
(5) system of data (error) processing.
The subsystems (1)–(4) are physycal and its states are characterized by
the variables y1, y2, y3 and y4 respectively. Under some assumptions the
mathematical model of the motion control system for the observatory is
described by the equations

System (5.3.13) has a unique equilibrium state (x = 0) ∈R3.
The problem is to establish conditions for asymptotic stability in the
whole of system (5.3.13).
Let us use the algorithm of constructing the hierarchical Liapunov func-
tion (see Martynyuk and Krapivny [124]). The ﬁrst level decomposition of
system (5.3.13) results in the independent subsystems

Martynyuk and Ribbens-Pavella [57].

We introduce the designations
Q = diag (η2

and the matrix D = [dij] the elements of which are expressed via the
elements of matrix Π as follows
dij = πij

,
(i, j) = 1, 2, 3.
Therefore we have
(5.3.35)
S = 1
2(Π + Π
T) = 1
2(QD + DTQ).
The matrix S is negative deﬁnite if and only if the matrix D is an M-
matrix. The matrix D is an upper triangular and dij ≥0 (i, j) = 1, 2, 3,
hence, if dii < 0, then D is the M-matrix. Therefore, the conditions for
matrix S being negative deﬁnite are
(5.3.36)
λM(Gii) + 2νHii rii < 0
∀i = 1, 2, 3.
These are the well-known conditions for the asymptotic stability in the
whole of system (5.3.13).
Let us show conditions (5.3.33), (5.3.34) for the asymptotic stability in
the whole of the system (5.3.13) to be more general than the conditions
(5.3.36).
The conditions (5.3.36) are satisﬁed if λM(Gii) < 0. This means that
the subsystems
(5.3.37)
dxi
dt = Aiixi,
i = 1, 2, 3,
obtained from (5.3.14) must be asymptotically stable.
Therefore, if one of the subsystems (5.3.37) is unstable, the conditions
(5.3.36) are not satisﬁed and the approach based on the vector function
does not work.
Assume the 3rd subsystem from (3.5.37) is unstable, i.e. λM(G33) > 0.
In view of the second level decomposition one of conditions (3.5.33), namely
s33 < 0 becomes
(5.3.38)
η2
3(λM(G33) + 2νH33 r33) + 2η1η3λM(G13)
+ 2η2η3(λM(G33) + 2νH2
33 r33) < 0.

Some Models of Real World Phenomena
It is clear that, if the 3rd subsystem forms asymptotically stable couples
(2, 3) and (1, 3), then λM(G13) < 0 and λM(G23) < 0. This may prove to
be suﬃcient for inequality (5.3.36) to be satisﬁed. However this inequality
may be derived by means of the matrix-valued function only.
Thus, the application of the matrix-valued function and two-level decom-
position yields less strict conditions for the asymptotic stability in the whole
of the system (5.3.13) as compared with conditions (5.3.36) established by
means of the vector Liapunov function.

5.4 Power System Model
The dynamical and structural complexity combined with the high order of
the power system make many methods developed in theory of diﬀerential
equations inapplicable in the investigation of these systems. The method of
Liapunov functions (scalar, vector or matrix) is one of the methods used in
the analysis of stability and the estimation of asymptotic stability domains.
In this section we shall show the application of the matrix-valued Liapunov
function to be advantageous as compared with the results by the vector
Liapunov function.

Considered is the N-machine power system with uniform mechanical damp-
ing λ. The i th machine motion is modeled by the equations

delivered by the i th machine, Ei ∈R is the modulus of the internal voltage,
Yij ∈R is the magnitude of the (i, j)-th element of the reduced admittances
matrix Y , δi ∈R is the absolute rotor angle: δij = δi −δj = δiN −δiN,

Proof. Let the matrix A in estimate (5.4.29) be constructed according
to (5.4.39) and (5.4.40). When inequalities (5.4.41) are satisﬁed, the matrix
A is negative deﬁnite, and by (5.4.40) A = AT. The function V (x, η) =
ηTU(x)η is positive deﬁnite, since Hi = HT
i
is positive deﬁnite, γik > 0
and αij > 0 and the integral terms in (5.4.14) and (5.4.15) are non-negative
in the neighborhood of x = 0. Thus, function V (x, η) for system (5.4.10)
is positive deﬁnite and ˙V (x, η) is negative deﬁnite in the neighborhood of
x = 0 due to inequalities (5.4.41). By Theorem 2.3.3 the equilibrium state
x = 0 of system (5.4.10) is asymptotically stable.

5.4.4 Numerical examples
5.4.4.1 Example.
The proposed algorithm of the power system stability
analysis is applicable to the 3-machine power system considered by Joci´c,
Ribbens-Pavella and ˇSiljak [79]. We admit the following parameter values
for the system (5.4.10):
N = 3;
E1 = 1.017;
E2 = 1.005;
E3 = 1.033;
δ12 = 5◦;
δ13 = 2◦;
δ23 = −3◦;
Y12 = 0.98 × 10−3∠86◦;
Y13 = 0.114∠88◦;
Y23 = 0.106∠89◦;
M1 = M2 = 0.01;
M3 = 2.0.
Treating the third machine as a standard one we get two subsystems. Let
us take the constants λ = 0.3, ε11 = ε21 = 0.06 and ε12 = ε23 = ξ12 =
ξ21 = 0.001. The matrix
ˆA = [ˆaij], deﬁned by formula (5.4.39) is of the
form
ˆA =

−1.1506
1.0814
1.0671
−1.0437

.
The matrix 2A = ˆA + ˆAT satisﬁes conditions (5.4.41) and therefore the
equilibrium state x = 0 is asymptotically stable. It is important to note
that in this case Joci´c, Ribbens-Pavella and ˇSiljak [79] established the con-
ditions of asymptotic stability for λ = 100, ε = 0, 99. In a paper by Shaa-
ban and Gruji´c [164] the asymptotic stability of the system in question was
stated for λ = 0.45, ε11 = ε21 = 0.10.
The asymptotic stability conditions for the equilibrium state x = 0
obtained herein are the least value for the parameters λ and ε.

5.4.4.2 Example. Let in system (5.4.10) N = 4 and the parameter values
are the following (see El-Abiad and Nagappan [35]):
E1 = 1.057/5.7◦,
E2 = 1.152/14.4◦,
E3 = 1.095/2.3◦,
E4 = 1.0/0.1◦,
Y11 = 0.88/ −88.1◦,
Y22 = 0.873/ −83.2◦,
Y33 = 1.014/ −75.5◦,
Y44 = 2.447/ −69, 7◦,
Y12 = 0.124/82.1◦,
Y13 = 0.065/82.4◦,
Y23 = 0.064/88.2◦,
Y24 = 0.655/96.8◦,
Y34 = 0.754/99◦,
Y14 = 0.658/91.1◦;
M1 = 1130,
M2 = 2260,
M3 = 1508,
M4 = 75 350.
Choosing the fourth machine as a standard one we get three subsystems.
For the values λ = 0.8, ε11 = ε21 = ε31 = 0.5 the matrix ˆA (see formula
(5.4.39)) is
ˆA =

satisﬁes the conditions (5.4.41) and therefore,
the state x = 0 of the system is asymptotically stable. Earlier it has been
stated (see Gruji´c and Shaaban [61]) that the asymptotic stability of the
equilibrium state x = 0 of the system takes place provided that λ = 1.0
and ε1 = ε2 = ε3 = 0.60.
Therefore, this case as well the proposed algorithm allows us to establish
the conditions of asymptotic stability for smaller valies of λ and ε.
5.4.4.3 Example. Let in system (5.4.10) N = 7 and the parameter values
are taken following Shaaban and Gruji´c [164]. Taking the seventh machine
as a standard one we get six subsystems. For the values λ = 2.0, εi1 = 0.80,
i = 1, 2, 3; εj1 = 0.85, j = 4, 5, 6, the matrix ˆA (see (5.4.39)) is

rium state x = 0 of the system is asymptotically stable. In the above
mentioned paper by Shaaban and Gruji´c [164] the asymptotic stability of
the equilibrium state was established for λ = 3.0 and εi1 = 0.95, i =
1, 2, . . . , 6. This applies to the smaller values of λ and ε as well as to the
asymptotic stability of the equilibrium state x = 0.
The application of the approach to three–four and seven-machine system
enables us to conclude as follows (see Gruji´c and Shaaban [61]):
(1) We can decrease the value of the parameter λ for which asymptotic
stability of x = 0 of the system is assured (value of λ is decreased
from 100 to only 0.3 for the three-machine system, and decreased by
33% of that in Shaaban and Gruji´c [164] for the four and seven ma-
chine systems). Noting that the smaller value of λ means that the
generator is less damped and that it is more diﬃcult to assure sta-
bility, we can deduce that the developed approach is more powerful
then those developed so far via vector Liapunov functions.
(2) Smaller value of the parameter ε can be assumed and the asymptotic
stability assured by applying the developed approach (value of ε is
assumed to be 85% of that in Shaaban and Gruji´c [164] for the four
and seven machine systems, and it is decreased from 0.10 to only
0.06 for the three-machine system). This essentially means that the
developed approach can lead to larger asymptotic stability domain
estimates.
(3) Using the developed approach, we can decrease the conservativeness
of the decomposition-aggregation method.
(4) The matrix-valued Liapunov function methodology leads to more
adequate scalar Liapunov functions for power systems and simpliﬁes
their construction via the vector Liapunov function concept.
(5) The stability test computation is reduced to only the negative deﬁ-
niteness test of a single elementwise constant aggregation symmetric
matrix. Its dimension is reduced to the number s = N −1 of the
subsystems of an N-machines power system.
5.5 The Motion in Space of Winged Aircraft

the aircraft, moving with ﬁxed absolute value of the velocity, performs a
manouvre with constant load factor. Thus, to the undistrturbed motion

there corresponds constant values of the angles of attack α0 and of side-
slip βo, and angular velocities of pitch ωz0, yaw ωy0 and rotation ωx0.
Their deviations from the perturbed values will be called α, β, ωz, ωy, ωx
respectively. The deviations of the angular velocities of side-slip, yaw and
rotation must not exceed given limits.
We consider the equations of the perturbed motion in the form (see

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

We use the Theorem 2.6.1. In our example N = 2, i.e., there are two
groups of variables (x1, x2, x3) and (x4, x5). We consider the matrix-valued
Liapunov function
U(x) = 1
2 diag [−b2b3x2
1, 2b1b3x2
2, −b1b2x2
3, x2
4, x2
5],
and η ∈R5
+, ηi = 1, i = 1, 2, . . ., 5.
The function
(5.5.5)

is positive deﬁnite, decreasing and radially unbounded.
In view of the
system (5.5.4) the derivative of the function (5.5.5) is
(5.5.6)
DV (x, η) = −b2b3a11x2
1 −b2b3a15x1x5 + 2b1b3a22x2

+ (2b1b3a25 + a52)x2x5 −b1b2a33x2
3
+ (a43 −b1b2a34)x3x4 + a44x2
4 + a55x2
5.
In order to solve our problem we have to ﬁnd the conditions whereby
function (5.5.6) is non-positive with respect to (x1, x2, x3) and negative
deﬁnite with respect to (x4, x5).
The method of ﬁnding these conditions is given by Aminov and Sirazetdi-
nov [3] and is as follows. We equate the derivative DV (x, η) of (5.5.6) to
the function

Some Models of Real World Phenomena
(5.5.7)
W(x) = −(c11x1 + c15x5)2 −(c22x2 + c25x5)2
−(c33x3 + c34x4)2 −(c4x4)2 −(c5x5)2
and, comparing coeﬃcient of like terms of (5.5.6) and (5.5.7), we ﬁnd the
conditions for the existence of the coeﬃcients of function (5.5.7) which are
in fact the required conditions for the function (5.5.6) to be non-positive
with respect to (x1, x2, x3) and negative deﬁnite with respect to (x4, x5).
These conditions are
(5.5.8)
a11 < 0,
a22 < 0,
a33 < 0,
a44 + (a43 −b1b2a34)2
b1b2a33
< 0,
a55 + a2
15b2b3
a11
−(2b1b3a25 + a52)2
2b1b3a22
< 0.
On substituting the values of the coeﬃcients (5.5.3) into inequality (5.5.8)
we obtain the suﬃcient conditions that solve the aircraft space manouvre
problem.

Liapunov functions in the investigation of thise problems is due to ˇSiljak
[167], Gruji´c and Burgat [56], etc.
5.3. The description of the model of an orbital astronomical observa-
tory is taken from Geiss, Cohen et al. [40] and Gruji´c [55]. The results
of investigation of this model are cited following Krapivny supervised by
A. A. Martynyuk. The comparison of the obtained results with those by
Gruji´c, Martynyuk and Ribbens-Pavella [57] has displayed the advantages
of the matrix-valued function application. For other results on the subject
see ˇSiljak [167], Abdullin, Anapolskii et al [1], etc.
5.4.
The results of this section are due to Gruji´c and Shaaban [61].
The scalar Liapunov functions are applied by El-Abiad and Nagappan [35],
Michel, Fouad and Vittal [142]. For the application of vector Liapunov
functions see Pai and Narayana [151], Gruji´c, Martynyuk and Ribbens-
Pavella [57], Gruji´c and Ribbens-Pavella [58], [59], Gruji´c, Ribbens-Pavella
and Bouﬃoux [60], Joci´c, Ribbens-Pavella and ˇSiljak [79], Michel, Nam
and Vittal [144], Shaaban and Gruji´c [164], [165], etc. Matrix-valued Li-
apunov functions are applied by Miladzhanov [145] including the systems
with structural perturbations.
5.5. The results of this section are due to Martynyuk [111] and Aminov
and Sirazetdinov [2].
