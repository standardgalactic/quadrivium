About the Author
Susan Schulherr, LCSW, is a licensed clinical social worker who has had a
private psychotherapy practice in New York City for nearly 30 years. She has
worked with people with eating disorders for over 20 of those years. Her
chapter on treating binge eating disorder appears in the 2005 book, EMDR
Solutions: Pathways to Healing (Shapiro, Norton). Her article, “The Binge–
Diet Cycle: Shedding New Light, Finding New Exits,” was published in Eating
Disorders: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention (1998). She has presented
workshops at the local and national level on eating disorders and on issues 
of weight and eating to both professional and nonprofessional audiences.
Ms. Schulherr is a trained family and couples therapist. She has extensive
experience in the trauma specialty approaches of EMDR and Somatic
Experiencing, each of which she has adapted for the treatment of eating 
disorders.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I owe some particular thank you’s now that this project that once felt so far
off is a reality. For the collaborative outpouring that became the text of this
book, my thanks to the indefatigable editorial staff at Wiley Publishing: Tracy
Boggier, Stephen Clark, Christy Pingleton, and to Misty Rees for her technical
review. For presenting me with the opportunity to participate in the first place,
my special appreciation to literary agent Margot Maley Hutchison from Water-
side Productions, Inc. For concept-to-completion professional feedback and
moral support without which my part in this project would have been impos-
sible, endless gratitude to Nancy J. Napier, LMFT.
I always wish to extend heartfelt thanks to the many clients and others who
have shared their eating disorder stories and struggles with me over the years.
All that you have taught me has made its way into this volume and inspired me
with the possibilities for healing even in the most difficult situations.

Introduction
C
ould this be you? You don’t have much self-confidence (this applies
most often to females, but males are not immune). You’d love to feel in
charge of yourself, your emotions, your life. You’d do anything to be someone
others love and admire. You don’t feel any of these things are true — for you.
Add to this that you live in a culture that tells you the world is yours if you’re
thin. That you, or anyone, can become model-thin (or fat-free buff) if you just
diet and exercise enough.
You may be a little precise or obsessive by nature. And you may have fewer
of the natural brain hormones that buffer most people in life. You may even
have a history of some kind of trauma that you have yet to resolve.
These characteristics are the ingredients for making an eating disorder. Because
you feel vulnerable, an eating disorder is, above all else, the way you struggle
against internal doubts, trying to cope. Dieting is how you try to put together a
sense of control and self-esteem. Bingeing is how you comfort yourself
or respond to the extremes of dieting. You have come to rely on your eating
disorder symptoms so completely that the thought of surrendering them
is terrifying — even when they begin to cause a lot of physical and 
emotional trouble.
If you recognize yourself — or someone you love — in this portrait, you’ve
come to the right book! Although the culture offers plenty to keep an eating
disorder going, the pages that follow supply you with lots of ingredients to
counter those effects from the inside. Or to start you on that path. I describe
the eating disorders from the inside out so you can make sense of what you
or your loved one is experiencing. I tell you about what you need for recov-
ery. I describe the process and personnel of treatment in detail. I advise you
as a family member or other caring person how to help the person you care
about and how to take care of yourself at the same time.
Eating disorders are treacherous. They destroy and even take lives, and they
make sufferers doubt and hate themselves. But the happy news is that the
majority of people who pitch into treatment and stay with it through recov-
ery get better. They go on to think about and engage in other things, become
successful and fulfilled, and leave their eating disorders behind. So can you.

Eating Disorders For Dummies 
About This Book
This book is aimed at helping you recover from your eating disorder (or helping
someone you love recover). I build two big assumptions about what’s necessary
for recovery into the organization of the book:
If you’re aiming at getting better, it helps to understand 
the nature of an eating disorder and how you get one.
The way you think about a problem determines how you try to solve it. For
instance, if you think your eating disorder shows you don’t have enough
willpower to control your eating, you may search for bigger and better ways
to put controls on yourself. If, on the other hand, you understand that your
disorder reflects low self-esteem and problems handling emotions, you can
go to work on improving your life in these areas.
I spend a lot of time going over the ways of thinking and looking at yourself
that make you vulnerable to an eating disorder. I spend at least as much time
describing ways of thinking and behaving that can build inner reserves and
make an eating disorder much less likely. This building process can be exciting
and gratifying at times. But it can be frustrating and slow-going at others.
Knowing what you’re doing and why can help you to keep plugging.
Studies show that people who stay in eating disorder treatment long enough
to build up inner strengths, rather than just manage outer symptoms (like
bingeing or starving), are more likely to get better and stay better.
Getting better means getting treatment.
For most people, recovering from an eating disorder isn’t a self-help operation.
(You can read about the exceptions to this rule in Chapter 12.) You need to
hire experts and invest a lot of yourself and your time in your treatment. I
devote a lot of space to taking you through the treatment process, step-by-
step, from beginning to end. This includes understanding treatment options
and when to choose them, selecting a therapist and other members of your
treatment team, and understanding your own role in the treatment process. I
want you to have the best possible chance of being successful.
If you’re a family member, I go over in detail how to approach the person you
love about treatment. I discuss your role in treatment and how to support
recovery in day-to-day living.
I’ve written Eating Disorders For Dummies so that you can jump in wherever
your interest takes you — you don’t have to read this book from start to
finish. Each section includes references to other parts of the book that have
more information on the subject you’re reading about.

Conventions Used in This Book
Many times in this book, particularly in the treatment sections, I use fictional
people to illustrate a point I’m making. These people represent composites of
people I’ve met and/or worked with over the years. In no case do they repre-
sent real people.
From time to time, I introduce new terms as I explain ideas important to your
understanding of the eating disorders. Mostly I do this when you’re likely to
run into the term elsewhere and it may be helpful for you to know it. Each time
I first use a new term, I italicize it, and usually follow it with an explanation.
Eating disorders are still primarily a female affair. So I make my life, and hope-
fully your reading, easier by using all female pronouns: her, hers, she. That
doesn’t mean I’m not aware that men can develop eating disorders, too. If
you’re a guy, your disorder is just as serious! (See Chapter 15.)
It would have made for easier language to refer to people with anorexia as
anorexics, people with bulimia as bulimics, and so on. I avoid this streamlined
language to make a crucial point: Saying you are a person with an eating disorder
serves as a reminder that there’s more to you, much more, than your eating 
disorder. Also, there’s no reason to assume your disorder is a permanent part of
your identity, the way you do when you say you’re a woman, or a Latina, or
American-born. Saying you’re a person with an eating disorder is more like
saying you have a major illness. Beating your eating disorder may be a big
battle, but your eating disorder is not who you are.
What You’re Not to Read
You’re not to read anything that isn’t crucial to understanding eating disor-
ders and their treatment if you don’t feel like it. Sometimes I add some extra
information that’s a little more in-depth but not essential. I mark all such in-
depth detours with a Technical Stuff icon.
In the same spirit, along the way I offer extra nuggets of information on the
subject you’re reading about tucked away in gray boxes called sidebars. Read
them. Don’t read them. The choice is yours. It won’t make a difference in your
understanding of the subject at hand.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume if you’re reading this, you’re one of the following people:
3
Introduction

 You have or suspect you have an eating disorder: You want to know
there’s hope, get a better handle on your problem, be pointed in the
right direction for treatment, and get a preview of the recovery process.
 You have a family member, friend, or roommate who has an eating
disorder: You want to understand her problem better, know how you
can help, understand treatment options if you’re the parent of a minor,
and get some ideas about support for yourself.
 You’re a professional who works in some way with people with eating
disorders: You need a quick reference and overview to help you understand
the problem and how you can help in your particular role.
If any of these descriptions sound like you, you’ve come to the right book!
How This Book Is Organized
Eating Disorder For Dummies is organized into 5 parts with 27 chapters. What
follows is a description of what you can find in each part.
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-
Consuming World of Their Own
Part I intends to help you really get what eating disorders are about. Chapter
1 gives you the big picture and previews what you find in the rest of the book.
Chapters 2 to 4 introduce you to the three major eating disorders: anorexia,
bulimia, and binge eating disorder. These chapters each come with a question-
naire so you can judge whether you’re at risk for one of these disorders.
Chapter 5 reviews the risk factors that make a person vulnerable to developing
an eating disorder — genes, brain chemistry, family background, personality
characteristics, trauma history, and dieting behavior. In Chapter 6 you can
find out about the physical toll eating disordered behavior takes on your
body. Finally, Chapter 7 describes other psychological disorders that typically
accompany an eating disorder, such as anxiety, depression, addiction, and
compulsive exercise.
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery
and Treatment Options
Part II is your treatment handbook. I start you off with a map of recovery
goals, so you know what you’re aiming at. If you like, you can use the charts I
4
Eating Disorders For Dummies 

provide to map yourself: Where are you now and what would you like to work
on next in relation to each goal?
If you’re just thinking about treatment or want to review the treatment you’re
in, Chapter 9 goes over all your treatment options. This includes treatment
experts and facilities. It also includes a discussion of why you might make
each choice. Chapter 10 helps you pick the approach to individual therapy
that’s right for you. It takes you right inside an imaginary session for each
approach so you can get a feel for what it may be like. Chapters 11 and 12
explore additional options: family, couples, and group therapies; support
groups; medication; and online treatments.
In Chapter 13 I help you think about your own role in using your treatment
team and getting better. I follow this up with a chapter on managing early
stage recovery successfully, including dealing with relapse.
Part III: Eating Disorders 
in Special Populations
This part focuses on special groups in the population who are at high risk for
eating disorders or whose eating disorder risk has been under-recognized. I
highlight special treatment considerations for each group. These groups include
 Men
 Athletes
 Dancers, models, and actors
 Children
 Middle-aged and elderly people
 People who are obese
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families 
and Others Who Care
Part IV is intended to help families and other people who care about someone
with an eating disorder. I write as if you are a parent responsible for a minor
child. But I stop along the way with special advice for others: siblings, partners,
friends, roommates, and so on.
This is a how-to part, covering everything from getting informed to approaching
someone for the first time about their eating disorder to managing life in
recovery in a day-to-day way. The final chapter in Part IV focuses exclusively
on your well-being and what services you may need to support it.
5
Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
This is your at-a-glance part for quick ideas to inspire you or keep you on
track in recovery. Ten don’ts remind you of recovery-interfering thoughts and
behaviors. Ten do’s give you the other side of the coin: ten thoughts and
practices to keep your recovery cooking. Finally, I offer you a glimmer of ben-
efits your recovery may hold in store that probably haven’t occurred to you.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, I use figures in the margins — icons— to quickly point
out the type of information you find in a particular paragraph. Here are the
icons you see, along with a definition of what each one means:
This icon can mean one of two things. It can let you know I’m reviewing
things I’ve gone over in more depth elsewhere. Or it can alert you that the
paragraph contains some really valuable information for you to remember.
When you see the arrow in the target, you know the paragraph contains
practical information for handling your eating disorder.
I place the warning icon next to any paragraph that tells you about situations
or practices that may be harmful to you. I also use it when the paragraph
informs you about ways you could be misled or other times you need to be
on the alert.
This clever-looking guy tells you that the information in the paragraph gets a
little technical, maybe providing a little more than you want or need to know.
It’s okay to skip this paragraph. Reading it isn’t necessary to your under-
standing of the topic.
Where to Go from Here
Eating Disorders For Dummies is written so you can start wherever you want.
You don’t have to read the book in order. If you’re urgent about getting treat-
ment right now, you probably want to start with Chapters 9 to 11. If you’re a
family member, you may want to start with Part IV, which is written for you.
Which chapter you choose depends on whether the person you love is
already in eating disorder treatment or not. If you’re still facing treatment
choices, you’re likely to find Chapter 9 a useful starting place.

Eating Disorders For Dummies 

Part I
Eating Disorders:
An All-Consuming
World of Their
Own

In this part . . .
I
introduce you to eating disorders and explain how
they differ from less-worrisome eating problems. I
describe how increasing pressures on women to achieve
ideal bodies have contributed to a rise in eating disorders
over the last 40 years. I go over the three major eating 
disorders — anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder
(BED) — in detail. I include tools to help you decide
whether you may have one of these disorders or be at risk
for developing one. I discuss the major risk factors that
make a person vulnerable to developing an eating disorder,
including genes, family style, cultural pressures, personal-
ity, and dieting behavior.
I include chapters that tell you how eating disordered
behaviors harm your body and affect your thinking
processes. I also review psychological and behavioral
problems that commonly accompany eating disorders,
such as addiction, compulsive exercise, depression, and
suicidal tendencies. For all of these companion disorders,
I provide tools to help you decide whether they apply to
you (indicating you should seek evaluation and treatment).

Chapter 1
Understanding Eating Disorders
In This Chapter
 Understanding what an eating disorder is
 Finding out why eating disorders have been on the rise
 Seeing a better future through treatment and recovery
T
he term eating disorder sounds like something that refers to somebody
who doesn’t eat right. And, in one sense, it certainly does. Some people
with eating disorders severely under-eat, to the point of risking their health
or their lives. Others repeatedly overeat in extreme ways and may do risky
things to get rid of the calories they’ve taken in. But what’s not right about
the eating is far more complicated than calories and nutrition.
In this chapter you get an overall sense of the eating disorders as physical
and psychological syndromes: What do they look and feel like? Who gets
them? What is an eating disorder doing in a person’s life? How is getting an
eating disorder driven by the culture, and how does that help us understand
people with eating disorders better?
If you have an eating disorder, I tell you what you need to do to find treatment
and get better. This previews Part II of this book, which covers treatments
from soup to nuts. If you are a parent or caregiver to someone with an eating
disorder, I discuss some of the difficulties of your situation. Part IV of this
book, expanding on what I say here, is essentially a how-to section devoted to
caregivers.
Getting a Sense of the Problem
People with eating disorders experience psychological issues and are compul-
sive in their eating habits. These play on each other over time, causing the
eating disorder to become more entrenched. Some of the techniques used to
try to drop a few pounds may lead to bad eating habits. However, if the 
concern about weight becomes obsessive, then the problem moves from
simple dieting to an eating disorder.

10
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own
Eating disorders involve the body and the mind. People with eating disorders
express psychological problems through their behaviors with food. For exam-
ple, someone who is struggling with self-esteem may decide that losing some
weight would make them feel better and be a more appealing person. This
person may try dieting, like many of her friends. But because she starts
depending on dieting and weight loss for a sense of self-esteem, she can’t let
go of them. They become an obsessive focus, and the problem moves from
simple dieting to an eating disorder. Psychological problems that existed
before the eating disorder developed get worse, not better, as a result.
Eating disorders can’t be separated from the culture in which they arise. In
Western society, the overwhelming cultural message is that being thin is best.
As people try to define themselves and what makes them valued members of
the culture, the message to get or stay thin affects behavior such as eating,
dieting, exercise, even cosmetic surgery. It may also affect self-image. I discuss
in this section how these effects can lead to disordered eating habits even for
a great many people who don’t have formal eating disorders. For some people
who are otherwise vulnerable (see “Seeing What’s Behind the Symptoms” in
this chapter and a discussion of risk factors for developing an eating disorder
in Chapter 5), the message that thin is best provides the central principle for
fixing their lives — and an eating disorder can soon follow. (Read “Understanding
the Dramatic Rise in Eating Disorders,” later in this chapter, to find out more
about the development of the “culture of thin.”)
In this section and throughout the book I give you a sense of what eating 
disorder symptoms are about in the belief that a solid understanding is
necessary in order to arrive at the right kinds of solutions. I describe more
about the cultural phenomenon of disordered eating practices, of which
eating disorders represent the extreme end. I also give you a sense of who
gets eating disorders and how many people have them.
Psyching yourself sick
For the person with an eating disorder, weight and eating develop into a
psychological problem as well as a physical one. If you have an eating disorder
you’re constantly preoccupied with your weight and body shape. Your mood
rises and falls with what you see on the scales. You judge your worth as a
person by your weight and your success at dieting. What probably started out
as ordinary dieting has developed into a rigid pattern that has gone seriously
out of control. As time goes on, your eating disorder takes up more and more
space while the rest of your life — friends, family, fun, future — takes up less
and less.
Chances are good that you struggle with other psychological problems as well,
such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or alcohol or drug

abuse problems. These problems, along with factors like personality type,
family background, heredity, and biochemical make-up, may all contribute to
the development of an eating disorder in a particular person.
Becoming more compulsive
The solution seems simple and obvious from the outside looking in. The person
with anorexia must know she’s not close to being fat and that she’ll die if she
keeps this up. The person who binges wants desperately to lose weight — so
can’t she just quit eating so much? A central quality of the eating disorder is the
compulsivity of the symptoms and of the inner drive to be thin. Compulsions are
behaviors that have an “I have to” urgency associated with them — to the point
that the person often no longer feels they are a matter of voluntary control.
(Ever tried to quit smoking?)
Eating disorders versus disordered eating
If you lined up all the people in the United States who eat, you’d have a spec-
trum ranging from Normal Eaters on one end to People with Eating Disorders
on the other. The first thing you’d notice about this spectrum is that not very
many people would be at the Normal Eaters end. Why? In this day and age we
have more food than any society before us. At the same time, modern conve-
niences have cut the need for physical activity to nubbins. And the stresses
of modern living often lead to eating patterns that are bound to make us tip
the scales. Yet, despite all these trends pushing us to become heavier, as a
culture we prefer a slim and fit look. It shouldn’t be surprising that it all adds
up to some strange relationships with food.
Who’s in the middle? Most of the eating spectrum is taken up by people who
don’t have formal eating disorders but who have eating habits and beliefs that
are disordered. Up to 60 percent of adult American women may be disordered
eaters. Examples of disordered eating or beliefs include:
 Cutting out a food group to cut calories
 Eating to manage emotions
 Believing the scales reveal your worth
The more disordered eating behaviors and beliefs you have, the more at risk
you are for developing an actual eating disorder. (You can read more about
eating disorder risk factors in Chapter 5.)
11
Chapter 1: Understanding Eating Disorders

Being at risk for an eating disorder
Precise figures for the numbers of people affected by eating disorders are
hard to come by. People often deny or hide their disorder, and the symptoms
that identify sufferers aren’t always obvious, especially in the early stages.
Estimates indicate that between 5 and 8 million people in the United States
are currently affected by some form of diagnosable eating disorder. Most of
these people are young white women between the ages of 12 and 35 years.
But this typical picture is beginning to shift in some ways:
 Both younger girls and older women are beginning to fill the ranks.
 More and more men are developing eating disorders, perhaps as many
as a million currently in this country.
 Minority girls and women are showing eating disorder rates that often
match those of their white peers.
According to statistics, as many as 70 million people worldwide suffer from
eating disorders. Eating disorders occur at strikingly lower rates in non-
Western, nonindustrialized countries than in Western industrialized ones.
This tips us off that eating disorders have something to do with the culture.
Classifying the Eating Disorders
In upcoming chapters of this book, I go over the many ways an eating disorder
can take shape in the lives of different people. However, three major eating
disorders affect the most people, so they get the lion’s share of attention.
They are anorexia nervosa (usually just called anorexia), bulimia nervosa
(usually called bulimia), and binge eating disorder (BED).
Anorexia nervosa
Usually when people think of eating disorders, the first image that comes to
mind is the emaciated face and body of the young woman with anorexia.
Though actually the least prevalent of the major disorders — anorexia afflicts
about 1 in every 100 people — it was the first to gain widespread public
awareness. Anorexia also grabs our attention because it’s the most dangerous
eating disorder. According to the Academy for Eating Disorders, the risk of
death for a person with anorexia is 12 times higher than that of someone
without an eating disorder.
12
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own

A person with anorexia is terrified of becoming fat — so terrified that the fear
rules everything she does. She believes she’s always on the verge of fatness,
regardless of her actual weight or what anyone else tells her. To guard against
the dreaded outcome, she refuses to eat. The resulting weight loss can put
her health and life in jeopardy. A person with anorexia may also purge like
the people with bulimia I discuss in the next section, and/or she may exercise
compulsively to help her control her weight.
Bulimia nervosa
You could most easily identify the person with bulimia by the behaviors of
bingeing and purging — that is, if you could witness them. These behaviors are
almost always done in secret. Bingeing is eating lots of food in one sitting —
sometimes tens of thousands of calories — often rapidly. Purging is what the
person with bulimia does to get rid of these calories. She may do this by 
vomiting what she’s just eaten, overusing laxatives or diuretics, exercising
excessively, or other methods.
After binge episodes, a person with bulimia feels extremely shamed and
worthless. She’s as preoccupied with avoiding fat as the person with anorexia.
Also like the person with anorexia, she believes her weight determines her
worth. Unlike the person with anorexia, however, chances are good that the
person with bulimia is also dealing with alcohol or drug abuse and with
depression. As many as 3 or 4 in 100 young women in the United States have
bulimia nervosa.
Binge eating disorder (BED)
People with binge eating disorder (BED) binge pretty much like people with
bulimia. And they feel just as bad afterward. But they aren’t driven toward
purging behaviors. More likely, they become engaged in cycling between periods
of bingeing and periods of rigid dieting. For some, this keeps their weight in a
normal range. Other people with BED gain weight and may even become obese.
Estimates are that anywhere from 3 to 8 in 100 people in the United States
have BED. According to a 1998 survey in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine,
as many as 40 percent of the people with BED are men.
Seeing What’s Behind the Symptoms
Eating disorder symptoms are very dramatic. But the real drama lies beneath
the surface, in the hearts and minds of sufferers. While most people enjoy
13
Chapter 1: Understanding Eating Disorders

good food, those with eating disorders become obsessed over food-related
issues. Eating isn’t fun. Weight is the enemy. Strictly controlling eating and
not eating is seen as a magical way to bring order to areas of life that feel out
of control.
Food and weight as the visible focus
Think of the person with an eating disorder as a magician. The magician does
his magic by getting us to look over here, while the real action is over there.
The difference with the eating disorder is that the person who has it is as fix-
ated on her food and weight symptoms as everyone else. And because her
symptoms can cause anything from severe misery to outright physical danger,
those who care have to keep at least one eye on them. But staying focused on
food and weight means never getting to the heart of what an eating disorder is
really about.
Eating disorders as “solutions”
Nobody has an eating disorder for the fun of it. If you’ve developed an eating
disorder, it’s because something hasn’t been working in your life. You’ve
turned to your eating disorder because it seems to help; never mind the terrible
price you’re paying for it.
Sadly, your eating disorder is a vote of no-confidence in your personal ability
to solve problems, manage feelings, or create a life to be proud of. Depending
on your disorder, you’ve discovered that weight loss brings admiration, diet-
ing gives you a sense of control, bingeing provides temporary comfort, or
purging offers a sense of release and relief. Each makes the eating disorder
seem like a powerful and readily available ally.
The tricky thing about eating disorder symptoms is that the more they
appear to solve for you, the more you ask them to solve — and the more you
believe in them as problem-solvers. When a symptom seems to fix so much, it
can achieve a very “dug-in” place in your life.
Seeing the Damage Eating Disorders Do
Eating disorders can take a terrible physical toll. They can also bog sufferers
down in the self-defeating patterns of thinking and behavior that got them
into their disorders in the first place. Having someone with an eating disorder
in your life can leave you feeling helpless, angry, frightened, and exhausted.

Damage to the eating disorder sufferer
Eating disorders are physically dangerous. Anorexia and atypical disorders
that include starving are the most dangerous. Starving can result in damage
to the heart and other major organ systems. Death can follow. Anorexia has
the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric disorder. Starving also impairs
clear thinking and judgment.
Purging as part of bulimia or an atypical disorder can also damage the heart
or other parts of the body. Though mortality rates are low compared to
anorexia, the effects of purging can still be quite serious. (You can read in
detail about the physical effects of the eating disorders in Chapter 6.)
Damage to those around the sufferer
From the time you realize someone you love has an eating disorder to the
time she becomes ready to seek treatment can be a long journey. Those who
care are often left to watch helplessly as the eating disorder sufferer gets
drawn more deeply into her symptoms and potential danger. This is probably
the worst part of caring about someone with an eating disorder. However, an
eating disorder can affect the lives of those around the sufferer in a number
of other ways as well, including:
 Family functioning: Eating disorder symptoms sometimes start to rule
family life. Fear and worry can make it hard to find time for rest or fun.
 Intimacy: It often feels as if the person’s relationship with her eating dis-
order takes priority over other relationships. Secrecy and deceit about
symptoms interfere with feelings of closeness.
 Personal rights and boundaries: Stealing food or money for food and
leaving a messy bathroom or kitchen are just a few of the ways eating
disorder symptoms can infringe on others’ rights.
You can read more about living with someone with an eating disorder in
Chapter 23. Chapter 24 is all about getting help for yourself while you do.
Scoping the Rise in Eating Disorders
Before 1960, few people had heard of anorexia nervosa. By the end of the
decade, it was taking the lives of a shocking number of young women. By the
end of the next decade, bulimia and binge eating disorder were also taking a
toll. At the same time, weight and eating preoccupations began increasing in
the general population, mostly among women.
15
Chapter 1: Understanding Eating Disorders

You might call the eating disorders the scary cousins of the more general cul-
tural trends. Between the early ‘70s and the dawning of the new millennium,
the number of women reporting dissatisfaction with their bodies went from
just under 50 percent — bad enough — to nearly 90 percent.
How cultural forces have taken a toll
In many ways, it takes a village to create an eating disorder. By this I mean that
cultural ideals about the best way to look can deeply affect a person’s self-
image and behavior. Achieving the ideal look is promoted in advertising and
every form of entertainment as the way to purchase your ticket to many of the
rewards society has to offer: admiration, a good mate, perhaps a better job.
In the last 40 years, the ideal look has come to mean, above all else, being
thin and free of body fat. In fact, for women, it has meant becoming thinner
and thinner. According to one study 45 years ago, models — who tell us what
we should look like through media images — were just 8 percent slimmer than
the average woman. Today, they’re 23 percent slimmer than the rest of us.
How have women (and an increasing number of men) responded to these
unreachable images? They’ve dieted. They’ve dieted alone, in groups, in secret,
in public, with or without exercise, with supplements, with fasting . . . the list
goes on. By now, for women, dieting is almost a cultural right of passage. For
some women who don’t feel okay about themselves or their worth, dieting seems
like a solution. When you can’t diet too much and the outcome of your dieting
determines your sense of worth, you have the recipe for an eating disorder.
What makes eating disorders more likely
What happened to make us think that being thin is naturally superior? What
happened to our tolerance for diversity and round edges? Two big things
happened that the culture is still digesting: falling in love with youth and
experiencing the women’s movement.
The quest for youth
The baby boomers began to come of age in the 1960s. They were bound to
have a big effect, if only because there were so darn many of them. Many
believe the fashion trends of this era flowed from the boomers’ new values,
including street fashion over haute couture and a new waif-like look, embod-
ied by the infamous model, Twiggy. The fashion industry took over the waif
look and made it mainstream.
American society not only fell for the boomers’ taste but it also fell for their
youthful energy. If you couldn’t be young, you could at least be youthful-looking.
16
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own

Twiggy-style slimness came to stand for youthfulness. Dieting was the key to
getting there. Fashion magazines began to report not just on clothing but on
how women could perfect their bodies to fit the new trend and look good in
more revealing styles.
Meanwhile, the belief that excess fat is also unhealthy exploded to a new level
during the same period. Increasing weight was linked with increasing risk of
heart disease. The ideal of fitness and its evil twin, fat phobia, became
cemented into the mindset of the youth culture.
The belief developed that anyone who wanted it badly enough could achieve
the new slimness. It sounds so democratic. You can’t easily see the trap in it
when no one is admitting that for many people — apparently the majority —
the ideal is out of reach.
The women’s movement
Up until recently, eating disorders have been mostly a women’s affair. What’s
been different for women during the rise of weight obsessions and eating dis-
orders? The biggest single development has been the women’s movement
and the social changes that followed.
Those who believe a connection exists between eating disorders and the
women’s movement point out that just as women began to break out of narrow
roles and take up more space in society, the culture of thin told them they had
to take up less space, not more. When women wanted to participate in the larger
world, they were encouraged to become preoccupied with counting calories
and the inches on their thighs.
Some see these developments as backlash by that other gender that had the
most to lose as women gained power. They point out, for example, that the
waif look made grown women appear childlike. No threat there. Others
believe women also felt threatened. What if, for all they gained, they just
ended up being rejected as unfeminine and unattractive?
Society still hasn’t figured these issues out. Where are the guidelines for
young women to follow? At a crossroads where neither the young nor the old
have their footing, the path to success promised by the culture of thin
remains seductively simple and clear.
How perceptions are beginning to shift
Are there any glimmers of hope in the 40-year march toward slimmer ideals,
more dieting, and more disordered eating? A few. For example, the modeling
world itself is beginning to look at the negative effect of too-thin standards on
its models. Several manufacturers have started to present their products
17
Chapter 1: Understanding Eating Disorders

with average-sized women. (Read more about these trends in Chapter 17.)
Prevention programs starting with the very young are popping up in class-
rooms and on TV. These programs counter messages that only thinness is
acceptable with positive messages about a variety of body shapes and sizes.
Getting Better Is an Option
Eating disorders don’t usually just go away on their own. But treatment is
available and people get better. The process is neither quick nor easy. In fact,
recovery usually takes a lot longer than people bargain for (though not for-
ever!) For most this means a matter of years rather than weeks or months.
The good news to keep in mind is that it’s doable. And, contrary to what you
may have heard, you don’t need to think of your eating disorder as some-
thing you’re stuck with for life once you have it. Full recovery from an eating
disorder means leaving your symptoms behind and moving onto other things
you’d rather focus on in life. For many, if not most, this is an achievable goal.
Getting help
The process of getting better is composed of two important parts. Engaging
in both parts strongly improves your outlook for long-term recovery. The first
part involves learning how to manage your eating disorder symptoms —
starving, bingeing, purging, and/or dieting. The second part involves working
on internal skills that can make you more effective in life and can help buffer
you from eating disorder relapse in the future.
Your eating disorder affects your body, mind, and spirit. Getting better often
includes some kind of healing work for all three. Creating a treatment team
that includes medical, psychological, nutritional, and other experts to help
you in your journey is typical. If your symptoms are severe or life-threaten-
ing, part of your treatment may need to take place in a protected environ-
ment, such as a hospital or residential treatment center.
Part II of this book is devoted to helping you through the maze of treatment
choices. You can read about which steps you need to take first, who to con-
tact, and how to choose among a variety of treatment approaches. I also
include chapters on how to participate in treatment effectively and how to
deal with relapse.

Emerging developments in treatment
In the early days of discovering anorexia, treatment focused on unraveling
the hidden psychological dynamics holding the symptoms in place. Being
able to see behind the curtain and make sense of things continues to be an
important treatment option. But the last several decades have introduced
treatments that allow you to work directly on reducing symptoms without
having to reflect on their meaning. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) was
the first of these. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) and Thought Field Therapy (TFT)
are two of the more recent additions. (I describe these and other therapies for
eating disorders in detail in Chapter 10.)

Getting Insight into 
Anorexia Nervosa
In This Chapter
 Defining anorexia nervosa
 Identifying key behavioral markers of anorexia
 Seeing the psychological aspects of anorexia
 Finding out whether your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors fit an anorexic profile
L
ike the phantom in The Phantom of the Opera, anorexia nervosa has two
domains: what’s outside for everyone to see and what’s inside, hidden
not only from others but often even from the sufferer herself.
The visible behaviors and outcomes of anorexia are often shocking, except to
people with the disorder. You can easily get lost in the focus on what’s visible
on the outside. But as you discover in this chapter, these behaviors are
driven by an invisible engine of internal distress — and an astonishing level
of determination to overcome that distress through thinness.
If you have anorexia, you may not agree with the part about distress or anything
else in this chapter that describes your emotional reactions. You may feel that
you’re solving what’s distressing in your life with your thinness and ability to
control what you eat. Consider that, in fact, the genius of your anorexia is that it
takes all that internal distress and turns it into one simple external issue: the
daily challenge of avoiding fat and staying thin. Anorexia gives you a feeling
of control when you otherwise feel helpless in life, and it makes you feel
worthwhile when you so often doubt your worth.
This chapter reveals the key behaviors, psychological characteristics, and
physical features that define anorexia. You can begin, if you like, by taking the
questionnaire in the section “Determining Whether You Have Anorexia” at the
end of this chapter, which taps anorexic characteristics.

Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 
Putting Anorexia Nervosa into Words
Anorexia is a severe emotional disorder that impacts your mind and damages
your body through starvation. The hallmarks of anorexia are a fear of fatness
and a refusal to eat. If you have anorexia, you’ve developed a fear of becom-
ing fat that organizes your entire existence. You believe you’re always on the
verge of becoming fat, regardless of your actual weight or what anybody tells
you about how thin you are. You take steps to manage your fear of fatness by
refusing to eat. Food refusal also allows you to feel in control, which is of cen-
tral importance to your sense of well-being. You may also binge and purge
and may exercise compulsively to help control your weight.
Anorexia takes its toll on both your brain and your body. (For more informa-
tion on the ways it affects your body, see Chapter 6.) The physical symptoms
of anorexia are due to starvation. These symptoms include:
 Heart muscle damage
 Heartbeat irregularities
 Low blood pressure
 Kidney damage or failure
 Convulsions, seizures
 Liver damage or failure
 Loss of menstrual periods
 Loss of bone density
 Fertility problems
Anorexia nervosa is a progressive disorder, meaning that, without treatment,
the disorder just gets worse and worse over time. The longer you have
anorexia, the greater your risk of death. This progression is very likely due to
the unique interaction between the mind and the body. The psychological
and physical factors work together to create a tighter and tighter knot to
untie, a prison of distorted thoughts and behaviors:
 Distorted Behaviors: You have psychological features that take on an
increasingly addictive quality — probably feeling more and more vital
for survival — as you become more deeply involved in your eating disorder
and the rituals that accompany it. (See the section “Becoming ritualistic,”
later in this chapter, for more information on ritualistic behavior.)
 Dangerous Thinking: At some point, starvation begins to affect your
brain and impair your thought processes. These effects actually change
your emotions and the way you think. For instance, you may feel
depressed or your need to be a perfectionist may increase. (I discuss
these effects in more detail in Chapter 7.)

Anorexia defined by sufferers
If you have anorexia, it’s desperately important to you to maintain control of
your weight and eating — and, for that matter, anything else you can control
about your life. You like to get everything just right. Being thin, being restric-
tive about eating, and being perfect are how you try to make your world feel
safe. It feels less safe when you think of facing an unknown or hard-to-control
future. Here is how those issues look among different people with anorexia:
Jenny is 8 years old. Her parents are getting a divorce. Everything in her
world is turning upside down. When she thinks about dieting, she’s not
so upset. She’s found something she’s in charge of — what she puts in
her mouth!
Nicole is 13. Her friends talk about nothing but boys, which she finds
stupid and boring. Even though her friends say they’re worried because
she’s so thin, she thinks they’re actually jealous. After all, they’ve all been
dieting, too.
Michelle is 18. She’s just getting out of the hospital where she went when
her weight fell dangerously low. She’s a straight-A student with an athletic
scholarship in track and field, but her parents have told her she can’t go
away to college in the fall if she doesn’t maintain her hospital discharge
weight. She’s had to limit practice to keep her weight up and is afraid
she’ll lose her scholarship.
Polly is 54. Her husband left her last year for his secretary (age 22).
Compulsive dieting and exercise are taking the place of the life she lost
and the future she can’t imagine. Besides, she likes picturing that she’s
thinner than her ex’s new wife.
Marie is 79. Her kids and doctor have just made her leave her home of 45
years and move to this assisted living place. Okay, they won that one, but
they can’t force her to eat the food!
Anorexia defined by professionals
Mental health professionals attempt to establish a basic working agreement
with each other about what constitutes various psychological disorders,
including eating disorders. Controversy abounds, but these agreements, to
the extent that they exist, come together in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), published by the American
Psychiatric Association.
23
Chapter 2: Getting Insight into Anorexia Nervosa

Be sure to notice that, right off the bat, DSM-IV distinguishes anorexia from
any involuntary form of weight loss — such as weight loss resulting from an
illness like tuberculosis or cancer — with the language “refusal to maintain
body weight.”
The following list paraphrases the DSM-IV’s definition of the characteristics
of anorexia:
 Refusal to maintain minimum body weight: Weight loss (or failure to
gain weight during a growth period) leading to a body weight that is less
than 85 percent of the normal minimum weight expected in accordance
with age and height.
 Fat phobia: Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though
you’re underweight.
.
 Body image disturbance: Disturbance in the way in which you experience
your body weight or shape, or basing your self-image on weight.
 Body weight denial: Denial of the seriousness of your current low body
weight.
 Loss of menstrual periods in women: Amenorrhea (the absence of at
least three consecutive menstrual cycles). Note: This criterion doesn’t
apply to girls who haven’t started menstruating, but may still have
anorexia.
The DSM-IV also breaks anorexia out into two basic types:
 Restricting type: During the current episode of anorexia nervosa, you
have not regularly engaged in binge eating or purging behavior. In the
restricting type of anorexia, you rely only on cutting calories, and probably
exercising, to control weight.
 Bingeing/purging type: During the current episode of anorexia nervosa,
you have regularly engaged in binge eating or purging behavior.
In both the restricting and bingeing/purging types of anorexia, starvation is a
key component. But according to Anorexia Nervosa and Related Eating
Disorders (ANRED), Inc. (www.anred.com), as many as half of those who
attempt to starve themselves can’t stick to the starvation regime (it does
totally defy nature!) and become bulimic rather than anorexic. (See Chapter 3
for more on bulimia.)
Others remain anorexic, but add purging — that is, they remain underweight
and continue to starve, but they also resort to the purging techniques more
typically associated with bulimia in order to control their weight. Purging
techniques include vomiting, laxative and diuretic abuse, and/or the use of
enemas. This second group constitutes the binge/purge subtype of anorexia.
Some may actually have binge episodes, but many purge any time they eat
more than their bare-bones regimens allow.
24
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Looking at Anorexia’s Behavioral Traits
If you have anorexia, you probably engage in some or all of the following
characteristic behaviors. Because anorexia is progressive, you can expect all
of these behaviors to become more pronounced or frequent the longer you
have the disorder and don’t seek treatment.
Restricting food intake — severely
The hallmark of anorexia is your refusal to eat, even for basic nutritional
needs, in spite of facing starvation and the risk of death. The official criteria
consider refusal to eat as anorexia when your weight falls below 85 percent of
what is normal for your age and height. 
Your food restricting is mostly in the form of calorie counting. Intake of just a
few hundred calories a day is not unusual. But you may also cut out entire food
groups. Fats, of course, are out. Carbs — that is, starches and sweets — are
almost always out. Anorexic restricting is not just dieting. It’s dieting run amok.
Becoming ritualistic
As anorexia develops, your eating habits get a little more precise. Everything
related to the food you eat (or don’t eat) comes under the strictest control,
and you practice certain rituals related to eating. For example:
 Only certain foods are eaten.
 Foods are eaten only in certain combinations, in a certain order, or in
certain bite sizes.
 You eat on a schedule others find strange, and you usually eat in private.
 You focus excessively on calories. Food accompaniments like condiments
and spices get elevated to food group status because of their low caloric
value.
And, as quirky as it may seem, you are frequently the family chef. Your inter-
est in food has become obsessive and may lead you to pore over recipes and
to shop for and prepare gourmet meals for your family (excluding yourself, or
course, except as a test of your willpower to abstain).
25
Chapter 2: Getting Insight into Anorexia Nervosa

Exercising compulsively
In anorexia, your basic drive in life is toward thinness and away from fat.
Restricting calories is one major means to this end. Burning them up is
another. If you have the restricting type of anorexia, you’re particularly likely
to be obsessively devoted to your exercise routines and any other extra
motion or exertion that will burn up more calories. You probably feel the same
loss of control if you miss your exercise session as you do if you eat more
than you meant to. And you probably exercise excessively, maybe for several
hours a day, even if you’re ill or injured, or your body is what others consider
emaciated.
Feeling hyperactive
As anorexia progresses, you may show a kind of restlessness that seems to
be driven from inside. It goes beyond your weight loss strategy and isn’t
something you can voluntarily control. Researchers think this form of hyper-
activity is probably an outcome of starvation, either in the way starving
affects body chemistry or the way it lowers your core body temperature. The
hyperactivity is thought to be your body’s instinctive response in an attempt
to raise its temperature.
Bingeing — the big blowout
A binge isn’t the amount you eat at the company picnic or even the tub of
popcorn you go through while watching a movie. A bona fide binge involves
taking in as much as 4 to 5 days’ worth of calories within a short period of
time — and feeling desperate about it afterward.
The notion that having anorexia means you’re not hungry is a myth. In reality,
you’re likely to experience constant hunger (not surprisingly) — you’re starv-
ing! What do you do with that hunger? At times, you may do exactly what
your body is screaming at you to do — eat! Bingeing is a normal response to
starvation.
Using laxatives or enemas to atone
In the purging form of anorexia, you take action to get rid of calories when
you believe you’ve eaten too much. Use of laxatives, enemas, or diuretics
(water pills) and self-induced vomiting are common practices.
26
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Purging practices put a severe strain on your body, which is already stressed
to its limits by starvation. The outlook for the purging type of anorexia is
actually a lot hairier than that of restricting anorexia. Getting better is harder
if you purge.
Seeing Anorexia’s Psychological Traits
Your psychological world as a person with anorexia is a fiercely controlled
mini-universe that has come to feel absolutely essential to your psychological
survival. As a vulnerable person you arrive at anorexia’s door feeling com-
pletely inadequate. You don’t know who you are or how you are supposed to
take on the challenges that lie ahead in life. Anorexia offers a retreat from
that forbidding world. But at the same time you believe your control and dis-
cipline will command the world’s admiration.
As anorexia progresses, you, the person with the disorder, become more and
more obsessed with food and dieting. This obsession is part of creating that
controlled mini-universe, a place you can always lose yourself in when real-
life challenges seem overwhelming. In the mini-universe, the terms of success
are pretty much under your control, if you can just keep managing your
hunger. The preoccupations and processes I discuss in the following sections
typically make up the anorexic psychological universe.
Body image disturbance
In crossing over the line from everyday dieting to anorexia, you lose the abil-
ity to see yourself accurately when it comes to weight and body fat. Body
image disturbance is a small pocket of irrationality in an otherwise lucid
human being.
Those who are not anorexic probably can’t comprehend the extent of this
delusion by comparing it to self-critical moments with their own bodies. Even
the most scarily emaciated anorexic person looks in the mirror and sees fat.
She can’t be talked out of it.
Fat phobia
Having anorexia means you are terrified of gaining weight, even when on the
brink of death from starvation. Your conscious thoughts are about how fat
and disgusting you look — or will look, if you eat another forkful.
27
Chapter 2: Getting Insight into Anorexia Nervosa

Just beneath the surface, as you see in a minute, is an enormous fear, in
which you equate fat — any fat — with being out of control of your life alto-
gether. A victory over fat is a victory over feeling powerless.
Self-image based on weight
Like others with eating disorders and, for that matter, a lot of the female pop-
ulation of this country, having anorexia, you confuse your weight with your
worth. If you weigh more than you think you should, nothing else about you
counts.
The difference between people with anorexia and others who sometimes
have these feelings is that for you, the belief is so unshakable that you pursue
dieting beyond any limits the rest of us impose, like starvation and the threat
of death.
Denial of the existence of a problem
Anorexic denial is in that same pocket of irrationality as the body image dis-
turbance, in which you can only see yourself as fat. You deny the existence of
any risky, perhaps deadly, consequences of your condition or behaviors.
Emaciation, chronic hunger, fatigue, numbness, dizziness, and a parade of
other side effects of starvation either don’t exist or don’t matter.
Adolescents, the largest group of anorexic people, aren’t great at seeing the
consequences of their behavior anyway. The psychological urgency of
anorexia and perhaps the physical effects of starvation on the brain just exag-
gerate this already risky life-stage tendency. The death rate for anorexia is
higher than for any other psychological disorder. This is true not only for
adolescents, but for people of all ages. In fact, the death rate from anorexia is
even higher for older people. (See Chapter 19 for more on this.)
Preoccupation with personal control
If anorexia is about anything, it’s about being in control. Or at least feeling in
control. (Being in control and feeling in control are two different things.) As a
person with anorexia, your empire is your body and you exercise your power
by saying no to food and to anyone who wants to make you eat.
What is going on that makes the creation of such an empire feel so impor-
tant? The need to create this kind of empire reflects your feeling of power-
lessness, in part, because you don’t feel in control of your external
28
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

environment. Following are some common ways your external environment
may leave you feeling you have too little control:
 Being a child in a family where parents hold the reins a bit too tight so
it’s hard to stretch and feel personal independence
 Finding yourself among peers who are raring to move on to the next
stage in life and seem, magically, to know exactly how to do it, when you
feel neither eager nor capable
 Being faced with other life transitions for which you feel unready (leaving
home, graduating, becoming sexual, entering the work world, marriage,
and so on)
Perfectionism
As a person with anorexia, you experience a need to get everything right in
order to feel that you’re okay. All of the eating disorders are characterized by
this quality, but it may look a little different in you. In other eating disorders,
perfectionism has more to do with trying to undo rampant feelings of shame.
Although you are certainly struggling with limping self-worth, you have put
your money on being thin and being in control. Your perfectionism is increas-
ingly related to these efforts. Here are some examples:
Jillian has had a perfect day. She’s had 50 calories plus water for break-
fast, 50 calories plus water for lunch and 50 calories plus water for dinner.
She’s climbing up and down the stairs to the basement now to burn off
dinner.
Elissa had a 4.0 average for her first two years in high school. If there
were a way to record all her A+s, she’d have a 4.5 average.
Amanda is a model. She didn’t get the last job she tried out for. She was
sure it was because of her weight. (Amanda wears a size 2.) She fasted
three days before she was next sent out, just to make sure.
Girls with anorexia, in particular, are well-known to have spent their pre-
anorexic careers as the best of children. They are model students who do
everything right. These girls concluded long ago that they have to perform at
extraordinary levels to be valued. Discovering the “empire of thin” allows
them to take their extraordinary powers to a place shared by few others. If
they surrender — even for a moment — to mere human urges for food, it
becomes a harsh reminder of how powerless and ineffective they feel without
their symptoms.
Interestingly, researchers are finding some overlap between anorexic perfec-
tionism and the traits of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) — a syndrome
of need for control, if ever there was one. (Read more about eating disorders
and OCD in Chapter 7.)
29
Chapter 2: Getting Insight into Anorexia Nervosa

Black-and-white thinking
Black-and-white thinking is another characteristic you find in just about
everyone with an eating disorder. When experiences are processed in this
manner, they must be either one way or another, with no gray area in between.
For example, you may think like this:
 I get everything right, or I’m stupid and worthless.
 The first ounce of extra fat puts me on the road to obesity.
 I’m in perfect control of everything, or I’m totally out of control.
This thinking style meshes with your standards of perfection, but it makes
life awfully difficult to live. If you think in this black-and-white way, chances
are you learned it in a family where other members thought in a similar way.
Need for external approval
A constant need for the approval of others describes almost everyone with
an eating disorder. In anorexia, this need often reflects growing up with the
belief that you are valued more for what you do than who you are, or that you
are valued most when you do what others want you to do.
People with these beliefs inevitably become focused outside themselves. That’s
where the information they need — what other people think or want —comes
from. But this reliance on others comes at the expense of knowing themselves
and their own needs. Believe it or not, people are not born with this ability to
know themselves. For most people, it comes about as a result of being nurtured
through the care and interest of others. The person with anorexia who lacks this
nurturing fails to develop the ability to know herself, her needs, her feelings,
her beliefs, and so on, and this void feeds the feelings of powerlessness she
experiences.

Orthorexia nervosa
Orthorexia nervosa is a term coined by Colorado
physician Steven Bratman to describe the
patient who, like a person with anorexia, has
made food and eating an obsession, but for a
different reason. For the orthorexic person, the
obsession is about health and the purity of the
foods eaten rather than calories. As with
anorexia, it can start innocently, usually as a
health quest, and end up with the person’s life
and self-image being controlled by the rules of
pure eating.

Determining Whether You Have Anorexia
If you’re wondering whether your way of eating and thinking fits an anorexic
pattern, you may want to try responding to the following statements.
Keep in mind that this questionnaire is only intended to jiggle your curiosity.
It in no way substitutes for getting a competent diagnosis from a qualified
eating disorders professional.
Instructions: Check each item that feels true or mainly true of you. I tell you
how to score your responses at the end.
1. ❑I’ve recently lost a lot of weight for no known medical cause.
2. ❑I’m terrified of gaining weight.
3. ❑I tend to want to go even lower when I reach a weight-loss goal.
4. ❑I’m afraid that when I eat, I’ll lose control and be unable to stop.
5. ❑I think about food, weight, and calories almost all the time.
6. ❑I keep calories to the minimum to lose weight or avoid gaining weight.
7. ❑I sometimes rely on one or more of the following to lose weight or deal
with overeating: laxatives, water pills, vomiting, or enemas.
8. ❑I feel relieved or more in control when I starve.
9. ❑I allow my weight to determine how I’m going to feel about myself on
any given day.
10. ❑I feel fat, no matter how much other people tell me I’m (too) thin.
11. ❑I wear clothes that hide my weight.
12. ❑I exercise so much to control my weight that some people consider
my workouts to be excessive.
13. ❑I feel anxious if I have to miss any part of my workout.
14. ❑I get upset when people pressure me to eat more or gain weight.
15. ❑I make up reasons to avoid eating with other people.
16. ❑I love to cook for others, but of course I don’t eat any of the food
myself.
17. ❑I have a secret food stash.
18. ❑I’ve noticed one or more of the following physical symptoms:
• ❑Loss of menstrual periods
• ❑Weakness or fatigue
31
Chapter 2: Getting Insight into Anorexia Nervosa

• ❑Low blood pressure
• ❑Dry skin, hair, or nails
• ❑Irregular heartbeat
• ❑Intolerance of cold, especially hands and feet
• ❑Dizziness
• ❑Bruising more easily
• ❑Growth of fine body and facial hair; loss of head hair
19. ❑I often feel I’m not good enough, or that something is missing inside.
20. ❑I feel that getting everything perfect is very important.
21. ❑I’m a “people-pleaser.”
22. ❑I’m very proud of being thin.
23. ❑I’d like myself better — and others would like me better too — if I
were thinner.
Scoring: Give yourself one point for every item you checked, including a
point for each separate item you checked on Item 18.
If you score 12 points or more, you have reason to be concerned. Your feet
are already on an anorexic path. Dealing with your symptoms now is much
better than waiting until you’re farther down the road, when all your symp-
toms are more entrenched and you’re dealing with the physical effects of the
disorder on your body.
If you score 20 points or more, you may well have already developed an
anorexic pattern. Getting diagnosed and seeking out the best treatment
options you can find without delay is extremely important for your health
and emotional well-being. The treatment section of this book (Part II) helps
you do that.

Seeing Inside Bulimia Nervosa
In This Chapter
 Reviewing the patterns of a bulimic profile
 Identifying the signature behaviors of bulimia
 Associating some psychological features with bulimia
 Completing a questionnaire to assess your bulimic tendencies
I
f you have bulimia, you may be a student, a homemaker, an athlete, an
entertainer, an executive — or come from any other walk of life. You 
may come from the suburbs or come from the streets. Your life may appear
well-under-control or be quite chaotic. Yet despite all the ways your life may
look different from the lives of other people with bulimia, in one way your
lives are strikingly similar: You conceal a secret life of bingeing and purging
that constantly demoralizes you and drains you of energy and self-esteem.
In this chapter, I shed light on the secret life of bulimic behaviors so that 
you and the people who love you can better understand what you’re dealing
with. You get a handle not only on the behaviors themselves, but also on the
psychological underpinnings that keep the condition going.
In order to allow you to check your pattern against a bulimic one, I provide 
a questionnaire at the end of the chapter.
Identifying the Many Faces 0f Bulimia
As with just about any illness or disorder, bulimia has no simple black-and-
white definition. It’s a complicated disorder with various faces. To help you
get familiar with the disorder and possibly start down the road to diagnosis,
the following sections present both real-life situations and psychiatric 
definitions that deal with the disorder.

Bulimia is a treacherous disorder that takes its toll on the body and the spirit
of sufferers. (Read more about the physical consequences of bulimia in
Chapter 6.) With chronic purging behavior, the risks you take include the 
following:
 Damage to your heart or heart functioning
 Liver failure
 Kidney failure
 Damage to your esophagus
 Damage to the functioning of your gastrointestinal system (for example,
bloating, constipation, diarrhea)
 Damage to your tooth enamel
Beyond the physical consequences of bulimia are its damaging emotional
effects. Your attempts to calm and soothe yourself with food have turned 
into the monster of out-of-control bingeing. The more you try to bring your
bingeing (and, thus, your weight) under control with purging, the more the
binges seem to occur. These behaviors serve to exaggerate the already-heavy
burden of shame you carry around about yourself and lower your self-esteem
even further.
Bulimia expressed by sufferers
Each of the people you’re about to meet represents a different face of
bulimia. If you’re bulimic (or think you may be), you know these people. You
may not exhibit one of these exact behaviors, but you recognize the experi-
ence of a relationship to food that has gone out of control. Unlike the person
with anorexia who denies that anything is wrong (see Chapter 2), you know
something is dreadfully wrong. In fact, you feel utterly possessed by your
feelings and urges.
Cassy feels overwhelmed with self-loathing and hopelessness after a day
in which she has binged and purged 22 times. The only thing she can
think to do is get really drunk.
MaryAnn, a suburban housewife, tries to scrape the layer of bug spray 
off the cake she threw in the garbage so she can eat it before her kids 
get home.
Nicky has just vomited her dinner in the restaurant’s bathroom, hoping
none of her friends would follow her in. She’s frantically searching her
purse for those darn breath mints.

Bulimia expressed by professionals
Despite differences in lifestyle among people with bulimia, the disorder 
has some pretty clear and common characteristics that allow therapists to
recognize and treat it. Experts rely on the presence of bingeing and purging
behaviors to diagnose bulimia.
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition 
(DSM-IV), published by the American Psychiatric Association, provides 
guidelines that mental health professionals and insurance companies use to
diagnose various psychological disorders. The following list paraphrases
how the DSM-IV defines bulimia:
 Bingeing episodes: Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of
binge eating is characterized by both of the following:
• Eating, in a discreet period of time (within any two-hour period, for
instance), an amount of food that’s definitely larger than most
people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar
circumstances
• A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (a feeling
that you can’t stop eating or control what or how much you’re
eating)
 Purging episodes: Recurrent compensatory behavior in order to 
prevent weight gain after the binge. Behaviors include the following:
• Self-induced vomiting
• Misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications
• Fasting
• Excessive exercise
 Frequency: The binge eating and purging (or other compensatory
behavior) both occur, on average, at least twice a week for three
months.
 Weight equated with worth: Your self-evaluation is unduly influenced
by body shape and weight.
 Bingeing and purging are not related to anorexia: The disturbance
doesn’t occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa. (You
don’t also meet the criteria for anorexia while engaging in bingeing and
purging behaviors.)
The DSM-IV distinguishes between two types of bulimia. The difference
between the two is that one involves purging, while the other doesn’t:
35
Chapter 3: Seeing Inside Bulimia Nervosa

 Purging type: During the current episode, you regularly engage in 
self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.
 Non-purging type: During the current episode, you use other inappropri-
ate compensatory behaviors, such as fasting or excessive exercise, but
you don’t regularly engage in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of 
laxatives, diuretics, or enemas.
Recognizing Bulimia’s Behavioral Traits
A person with anorexia is controlled — especially if she has the restricting
type of anorexia (see Chapter 2). But as controlled as the person with
anorexia is, that’s how out of control a person with bulimia can feel and be.
You struggle to manage your impulses on many fronts, not just with food.
These areas of struggle can include drug abuse, self-injury, stealing (related
to your bulimia), or missing priorities because of your symptoms (see
Chapter 7 for more).
Despite the constant struggle against chaos, you may manage enough of 
your life quite well. No one may be the wiser to your condition because your
symptoms are so well-hidden. Of course, the emotional price for this behav-
ior is enormous. The following sections break down the behavioral features
of bulimia and how the afflicted person can hide them as she spirals out 
of control.
Bingeing — not your ordinary overeating
The word “binge” has become a common expression for any kind of excess
behavior. People talk about bingeing on eating, shopping, watching television,
reading trashy romance novels, and so on. But if you have bulimia, you 
know that ordinary “overdoing it” has no resemblance to what happens when
you enter a binge state, in terms of your behavior or your emotions. The 
following sections detail the binge state of mind and the patterns that
develop out of it.
You may call it a “binge” any time you eat more than you mean to or eat 
some “forbidden” food, but I reserve the term for episodes where you take 
in unusually large amounts of food in a very short period of time. A single
binge may involve tens of thousands of calories. In the binge state, you 
probably prefer carbs and sweets, but you’ll eat anything. Whereas a person
with anorexia may eat plain mustard because it has few calories, you eat it
because you’re up at 3:00 a.m. and that’s all you have left in your fridge. Or
perhaps you want to drive to the all-night deli farthest away from your home
because you’re too embarrassed to go back to the one where you dined 
earlier this evening.
36
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

I use the term binge state because many, if not most, people with bulimia
describe being in some kind of altered state when bingeing. The following
feelings are common in this state:
 You feel as if you’re outside yourself, watching what’s going on.
 You feel numb or anesthetized.
 You feel as if you’re in a zone of unusual calm.
 You feel a constant drumbeat of internal pressure: “I must do this.”
The common thread in these bingeing experiences is the sense that what
you’re doing is outside your voluntary control. You feel as if some other force
has taken over while all your will and good intentions get left by the roadside.
This “I have to” urgency doesn’t come from the food or hunger (unless you’ve
been starving yourself). It comes from what the food is supposed to do for
you: to calm you down or cover up overwhelming emotions. (I go into this in
detail in Chapter 5.)
The binge state probably lasts until your stomach is in pain. Most likely, you
reach some kind of psychological tipping point and shift out of the altered
state — at which time you readily feel the pain in your stomach.
If you’re reading this in support of a bulimic person, you need to understand
just how different out-of-control binge urgency feels from ordinary strong
urges. The people who understand most readily are those with some kind of
addiction — drugs, alcohol, gambling, and so on. In fact, many experts con-
sider eating disorders to be addictions. Whether or not you agree, the urge to
binge certainly has all the irresistible strength of addictive behavior. (To
become more understanding and helpful, turn to Part IV.)
Purging to compensate
If you have bulimia, chances are you feel absolutely frantic and desperate
when you shift out of the binge state. You have to do something about the
food you just ate. Actually, not just something; you have to get rid of it! If
you’re a compulsive exerciser, you have your internal ledger cooking and it
dictates how many miles you have to run or how long you have to spend on
the stairmaster to burn off those calories.
More likely, though, you’ve discovered one of the purging techniques associ-
ated with bulimia (see the section “Bulimia expressed by professionals”).
With these methods, you want to get the calories out of your system pronto.
Here are the most common purge behaviors:
37
Chapter 3: Seeing Inside Bulimia Nervosa

 Vomiting: Vomiting on purpose for the relief it gives you when you’ve
binged is a form of purging. You may do this by sticking your fingers
down your throat until you trigger a gag reflex. Or perhaps you use some
kind of implement to achieve the same end. Many people with bulimia
have engaged in the behavior long enough that they only have to lean
over for the gag reflex to occur. And for all the years of warnings about
the deadly dangers of ipecac syrup (warnings I happily repeat in
Chapter 6), way too many people still rely on this poison to induce 
vomiting in order to purge.
 Laxative and enema abuse: Many people with bulimia prefer to induce
rapid transit through and out of their bowels as a way to rid their bodies
of excess calories. If you use this method, your thinking probably is, 
“If a little is good, more is better.” Some bulimics have been known to
use dozens to hundreds of doses a day of laxatives. (See the sidebar
“What happens when you purge with laxatives?” for a rundown on how
laxatives work in your system.)
 Diuretic abuse: Perhaps you take diuretics (water pills) to lose fluids by
urinating more frequently to achieve the same effect as taking laxatives.
Your bingeing and purging behaviors may be a once-in-awhile thing. Perhaps
you binge and purge predictably at times of stress or as a way to channel
emotion. Or, maybe cycling between bingeing and purging has become part
of your daily living routine.
For many people, bingeing and purging behaviors alternate with periods of
dieting. Maybe you meet with varying success in your dieting efforts. Perhaps
you’re always a little underweight, but not enough to draw attention like a
person with anorexia (see Chapter 2). Maybe you hover around an average
weight or are somewhat above that. You purge when dieting isn’t doing the
job to keep you where you want to be, or isn’t doing it fast enough.
Keeping your bulimia a secret
Unlike the person with anorexia who feels pride in her symptoms (see
Chapter 2), when you have bulimia you feel the need for extreme secrecy:
 You hide both your bingeing and purging behaviors.
 You may hide your binge foods.
 You turn on water in the bathroom to cover up sounds of vomiting.
 You may have a bulimia diary or participate in secret chat rooms.
38
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Bulimic secrecy is driven by shame. If you’re bulimic, you probably feel
shame about not only your symptoms, but also the ordinary flaws you 
live with as a human being. To have your symptoms exposed to the world 
is beyond imagination. In recovery it will be a big relief to learn that 
everyone has the same secrets and you can actually talk about them. (See
Chapters 10 and 11.)
Avoiding situations that involve food
After you’ve binged for awhile and have tried unsuccessfully to stop yourself,
you begin to feel afraid of losing control in any tempting food situation. For
this reason, you may begin to limit your social interactions. For instance, you
may not attend parties or other social situations — graduation gatherings,
company lunches, family reunions — that are likely to have goodies on hand
that you find hard to handle.
This is too bad. If you have bulimia, you already don’t tend to see other
people as safe, so you’re probably avoiding social situations enough as is.
Avoiding them because of food only leaves you home alone more often, out 
of the normal social loop. And this leaves you more vulnerable to bingeing
and purging and more secrecy.
Seeing Bulimia’s Psychological Traits
If you have bulimia, you probably arrived at it with more psychological 
baggage than people with other eating disorders. Your personal history may
involve a lot more disruption, perhaps even trauma. Your past may have 
39
Chapter 3: Seeing Inside Bulimia Nervosa
What happens when you purge with laxatives?
You may or may not be aware of the great irony of
laxative abuse for calorie management: Laxatives
take effect in your large intestine well after most
calorie absorption has already occurred in your
small intestine. Taking laxatives has almost no effect
on the calories in your body. The laxatives remove
water from your colon; any weight loss is the result
of dehydration.
Knowing this, laxative abuse should be history, right?
Unfortunately, you may continue because you like the
feeling of a temporarily flattened tummy. Or perhaps
you maintain a case of denial, the way sufferers of
anorexia do, because you need to feel you can do
something to gain a sense of control. In recovery, 
you learn skills that allow you to feel real control in
your life. Head straight to the chapters of Part II to find
out more.

left you without the basic resources you need to feel good about yourself or
to manage your life. Many companion disorders tend to go with eating 
disorders, like depression, anxiety, and addiction (you can read more about
these in Chapter 7). In addition, the following psychological features tend to
show up over and over again in people with bulimia.
Perfectionism, black-and-white thinking, and a need for external approval not
only are part of your bulimia now, but also probably are traits you had before
you developed bulimia. In Chapter 5, you can read about how these and
other qualities make a person especially vulnerable to developing an eating
disorder. The reason these so-called “vulnerability traits” are important to
know about and understand is that developing greater resiliency in these
areas is a crucial part of your recovery from your eating disorder. I talk about
this more in the chapters of Part II.
Feeling disgust and self-hatred
For almost all sufferers of bulimia, disgust and self-hatred are the predictable
feelings during the aftermath of a binge. Your suffering can be terrible. You
feel that others, if they knew, would be equally disgusted with you, and that
you would be — and should be — excluded from polite society. You feel 
isolated and without comfort in your self-hatred.
Far too many people with bulimia walk around with these feelings all the
time, not just when they binge. For a lot of people with bulimia, these feelings
are the legacy of a history of abuse or neglect. Anything you do wrong threat-
ens to bring the feelings from your background to the crushing foreground.
And here’s a cruel twist: Perhaps you (unconsciously) “hired” your eating 
disorder to help keep feelings of disgust and self-hatred from the past at a
distance. Tragically, your bulimic symptoms just end up producing more of
these difficult feelings.
Equating weight with self-worth
Many people with rocky histories who doubt their own worth tend to grab 
on to the cultural promise of a brass ring for the slim like nobody’s business.
These people equate weight with self-worth. Maybe a demanding and unreal-
istic sports coach, dance instructor, or even parent nudged you along in this
direction.
When you suffer from bulimia, at many times it feels like weight is the only
thing even theoretically under your control — especially when it comes 
to trying to feel good about yourself. This trait shows up in the belief that
nothing else about you matters if you’re not the right weight, so you purge 
40
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

to manage your weight. Most people with this disorder live in mortal fear 
that if they poke around beneath the surface of weight, they’ll find nothing of
worth about themselves. Better, it seems, to stay focused on the weight,
because there’s always the hope of fixing that.
Seeking elusive perfection
In the scenario of bulimia, perfectionism — trying to get everything right — 
is an attempt at protecting your self-image that requires constant vigilance.
When you’re forever feeling worthless, perfectionism is an interesting thing.
The word conjures up a society hostess putting the final touches on a gala
dinner. Whatever it may appear like to others, to a person with bulimia, 
perfectionism is instead a matter of forever trying to dig out of a ditch of
worthlessness.
See if you recognize yourself in either of the following examples:
Patti was at a party last night — her last with this crowd, she was sure.
Right in the middle of the dance floor, she slipped and fell in front of
everyone. She didn’t think she could face anyone again after such a
humiliation.
Lindsey had just been through the worst week of her life. She promised
herself a quiet day on Saturday to catch up at home, nap, and do what
she pleased. But when her good friend, Ana, called to say she was still
blue about the breakup with her boyfriend and wanted company to go
shopping, Lindsey felt she had no choice but to say yes. Aren’t you
always supposed to be available when your friends need you?
Aiming at perfection to achieve worth is a process that you feel you have 
to begin again every day. You never accumulate any self-worth capital with
yourself, nor do you believe you do with others. Every moment in which you
could make a mistake is one in which you could fall back into that ditch of
worthlessness. In the bulimic scenario, perfectionism is a constant struggle.
Limiting your thinking to black and white
If you have a black-and-white thinking style, you tend to see things as all 
one way or all another, with no in-between. You experience events or people,
including yourself, as all good or all bad, all hopeful or all discouraging, all
worthwhile or all worthless, and so on. For example, if you eat more than you
meant to, you’ve ruined everything (so you may as well go ahead and binge).
If you make a mistake, you’re obviously stupid or inept. If you recognize this
rigid thinking style as your own, chances are you learned it in a family where
other members also think in black-and-white ways.
41
Chapter 3: Seeing Inside Bulimia Nervosa

As your eating disorder progresses, this black-and-white thinking style is an
important part of what makes your condition worsen. It leaves you forever on
a narrow ledge of self-esteem from which you can fall for any lapse. If some-
thing doesn’t go exactly as planned (isn’t perfect; see the section “Seeking
elusive perfection”), your world (your emotions) can crumble. Here are some
examples:
 I’m at my goal weight, or I’m gross and disgusting.
 I ate exactly what I intended, or I pigged out.
 My friends approve of me every moment or they hate me.
 I binged and purged again, so I’m worthless.
Needing others’ approval
A need for external approval is a quality you share with many people who
have eating disorders; although how you developed it may differ. In order to
develop trust in your own views, two key ingredients should be present in
childhood:
 Your childhood environment must feel safe enough for you to relax
and focus on yourself. If your environment is in turmoil when you’re
young, coming to know your own thinking, feelings, and opinions is a
luxury you can’t afford. As a practical matter, your focus turns outward
to make sure you’re alert to what your environment may throw at 
you next.
 Your caregivers must support your growing sense of your individual
viewpoint. If your caregivers don’t help you learn to prize your own
views, you don’t learn to prize them either. In fact, you may quit noticing
you even have them! Under these conditions, other people’s opinions
have to fill in for opinions you can’t find or trust in yourself.
You need to feel solid and grounded in yourself as a person. Feeling
secure as an individual can help you withstand social pressures to be
thinner than your body is meant to be.
Feeling overwhelmed by the disorder
If you’ve been around the bulimia block for awhile, you probably feel like the
prospects for ever living another way are remote. You feel exhausted and
overwhelmed from the struggle.
Part of feeling so defeated comes from the sheer urgency behind the symp-
toms. The symptoms of bulimia (bingeing, purging, dieting) always feel urgent.
They have developed to help you manage something that was threatening to
42
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

overwhelm you, such as emotions, current problems, or a history of trauma.
The pressure is bound to feel bigger than you, and that feeling may double if
you bring the wrong game to confront your symptoms. Perhaps in the past
you’ve tried to get the better of the symptoms with willpower — a strategy
that never works with eating disorder symptoms. Unfortunately, you may
think this failure is just more evidence of your inadequacy. It isn’t!
Determining Whether You Have Bulimia
Perhaps you’re wondering if your way of eating and thinking fit a bulimic 
pattern. Well, you can stop wondering and start acting by responding to the
questions in the following list.
Keep in mind, this questionnaire in no way substitutes for getting a 
competent diagnosis from a qualified eating disorders professional (see
Chapter 9).
Instructions: Check each item that’s true or mainly true of you. I tell you how
to score your responses at the end.
1. ❑I think about food, weight, and calories almost all the time.
2. ❑I allow my weight to determine how I feel about myself on any 
given day.
3. ❑I frequently binge (eat huge quantities in a short time period).
4. ❑I frequently binge when I feel bad or overwhelmed.
5. ❑I feel worthless, disgusting, and hopeless after a binge.
6. ❑I regularly use one or more of the following purging methods to lose
weight or compensate for bingeing:
• ❑Laxatives
• ❑Ipecac syrup (to make myself vomit)
• ❑Enemas
• ❑Vomiting
• ❑Colonics
• ❑Water pills
7. ❑I sometimes exercise excessively to avoid weight gain from a binge.
8. ❑I go to great lengths to keep my bingeing and purging a secret.
9. ❑I often diet or fast to try to manage my weight.
10. ❑I’ve stolen money, food, laxatives, or diuretics for bingeing or purging.
43
Chapter 3: Seeing Inside Bulimia Nervosa

11. ❑I’ve missed school or work due to my bingeing and purging.
12. ❑I have one or more of the following psychological symptoms:
• ❑Depression
• ❑Drug abuse (legal or illegal)
• ❑Anxiety or panic
• ❑Alcohol abuse
• ❑Bipolar disorder
• ❑Self-injuring behaviors
• ❑Episodes of feeling disconnected from myself
13. ❑I’ve noticed one or more of the following physical symptoms:
• ❑Irregular menstrual periods
• ❑Weakness and fatigue
• ❑Low blood pressure
• ❑“Chipmunk cheeks”
• ❑Irregular heart beat
• ❑Eroded tooth enamel
• ❑Chronic diarrhea
• ❑Inflamed throat
14. ❑I rarely feel that I’m good enough.
15. ❑I’m a “people-pleaser.”
16. ❑I often feel others are judging me.
17. ❑I’d like myself more — and others would like me better too — if I were
thinner.
18. ❑Bingeing and purging interfere with my relationships with others.
Scoring: Give yourself one point for every item you checked — including a
point for each separate item you checked on Items 6, 12, and 13.
If you scored 16 points or more, you have a lot of indicators of a potential
bulimic pattern. Be advised: Treating the condition now is much easier
than doing so later, when your symptoms have become entrenched.
If you scored 23 points or more, you have strong reason to suspect
bulimia — enough for you to get a sound diagnosis and follow through with
any recommendations for treatment. You can find plenty of practical
advice to get you started in Part II of this book.

inge eating disorder (BED) is the most common of the eating disorders.
BED has been around for quite awhile but has just been coming into 
its own for research and treatment in the last 15 to 20 years. The lines that
define just who and what qualify for the disorder are still a little squishy
around the edges. But the main lines, the ones important for you to know, are
clear. And they’re the subject of this chapter.
If you’re one of the majority of moderate-weight people with BED, you may
have no idea that your use of diets is a central part of your disorder. You find
out how and why this is true in the pages ahead — and how the pattern is
connected to other aspects of who you are that make you vulnerable to an
eating disorder.
You also discover basic differences in the bingeing patterns of moderate-
weight versus obese binge eaters. Taken together with the information you
find about key psychological features of people with BED, you develop a
basic map for what you must work on in recovery (the subject of Part II of
this book).
Defining Binge Eating Disorder
Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by episodes of overeating, fre-
quently to the point of physical pain. Some binge eaters control their weight
by alternating periods of bingeing with dieting, while others gain weight and
become obese. Although the underlying psychological problems and physical

consequences of BED tend to be less severe than those with anorexia or
bulimia, people with the disorder experience intense emotional suffering.
They are as dissatisfied with their bodies as people with other eating 
disorders. And they suffer great anguish, including self-loathing and despair
after binge episodes. In this section I fill out the picture of BED for you by
providing snapshot profiles of individual sufferers and by going over the 
professional definition of the disorder.
Binge eating disorder defined by sufferers
If you have binge eating disorder, you may feel that many aspects of your 
life are basically in order (though you never feel you’re doing well enough at
any of them). If you could only deal once and for all with those pesky extra 15
to 20 pounds! Of course, that would probably mean controlling bingeing
episodes, which you’re sure you could if you just tried hard enough. It just
never feels as if trying hard enough makes any difference. It actually feels as
if you’re totally out of control when you binge and you can’t stop until the
episode has somehow run its course. The disgust and remorse you feel after
a binge is often only alleviated by going on a diet. Here are some profiles of
people who suffer with binge eating disorder:
Joe is a college wrestler. He binges after matches, especially when he
loses. In the off-season, he’s started to binge in response to all kinds of
disappointments.
Tara has been on every diet you ever heard of. She’s the best dieter you
can imagine — for about 2 weeks. Then something snaps and she binges.
After she binges, she cries and calls herself “stupid” and “pig.” At least
there’s always another diet.
Marge has been a weekend binger since she was 20. She grazes her way
almost nonstop from Friday to Sunday night. Now at age 45, she has 50
extra pounds to show for it.
Binge eating disorder defined 
by professionals
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition 
(DSM-IV), published by the American Psychiatric Association, provides the
guidelines used by mental health professionals and insurance companies to
diagnose various psychological disorders.
For those of you who are interested in where binge eating disorder stands 
as an official diagnosis, DSM-IV currently stashes BED in a category of eating
disorders called “not otherwise specified,” while the people who decide
46
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

these things are working on whether to give it equal status with anorexia and
bulimia (the most likely outcome). The following list paraphrases how the
DSM-IV defines binge eating disorder:
 Bingeing: Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating
is characterized by both of the following:
• Eating, in a discrete period of time (for example, within any 2-hour
period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people
would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances
• A sense of lack of control over your eating during the episode (for
example, a feeling that you can’t stop eating or control what or how
much you’re eating)
 Typical aspects of a binge episode: The binge eating episodes are 
associated with three or more of the following:
• Eating much more rapidly than normal
• Eating until you feel uncomfortably full
• Eating large amounts of food when you’re not feeling physically
hungry
• Eating alone because you’re embarrassed by how much you’re
eating
• Feeling disgusted with yourself, depressed, or very guilty after
overeating
 Unlike the anorexic person, the person with BED feels something is
wrong: Marked distress regarding binge eating is present.
 Frequency: The binge eating occurs, on average, at least 2 days per 
week for 6 months. (Note: Current research shows there’s no difference
between once-weekly bingers and those who meet this twice-weekly 
standard.)
 The bingeing isn’t part of anorexia or bulimia: The binge eating is not
associated with the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors
(for example, purging, fasting, or excessive exercise) and does not occur
exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.
Understanding the Behavioral 
Features of Binge Eating
From one point of view, describing the behavioral profile of your binge 
eating disorder is pretty simple. You binge eat, and you do it on a fairly 
regular basis. (You may want to read Chapter 3 for a more detailed descrip-
tion of the binge experience.) However, things are never as simple as they
47
Chapter 4: Understanding Binge Eating Disorder

seem, certainly not with BED. In this section, you find that different sub-
groups binge differently and that one of them bears a surprising connection
to dieting.
Binge eating across the weight spectrum
An interesting thing happens when you zoom in on binge eaters as a group:
Binge behavior looks different across the weight spectrum. Binge eaters 
can be divided into two groups based on weight: those who are of moderate
weight, and those who are obese. Your binge behavior depends to some
extent on which group you fit into:
 How you get into the binge: Dieting, an inhibiting trigger that makes you
want to eat more because you’ve been denying yourself, affects mainly
those in the moderate weight category. (I discuss dieting in greater detail
in the next section.)
Those in the obese category are more likely to be triggered by disin-
hibitors, that is, things that reduce inhibitions, like alcohol consumption,
according to NIH researcher, Susan Yanovski, MD.
Both groups — those who are of moderate weight and those who 
are obese — tend to lose control when confronted with lots of great-
looking food.
 What you do during the binge: Those of moderate weight tend to have
more time-limited bingeing episodes. The binge may last several hours,
but then, like the bulimic person’s binges, it ends.
Yanovski’s findings show that obese people who binge may make the
binge last over the course of a day, “grazing” throughout. (Some people
with bulimia do the same thing. Iron-clad boundaries rarely exist with
eating disorder behaviors; just trends.)
 What happens after the binge: After a binge, those in the obese group
tend to go on about their business. Moderate-weight binge eaters are
more likely, sooner or later, to go on a diet.
The binge/diet cycle
Most of those in the moderate-weight group of people with BED, and perhaps
a number of others all along the BED weight spectrum, get locked into a 
cycle between periods of binge eating and periods of dieting. You may not
even notice the cyclic nature of your pattern. Clues to the cycle you may be
aware of are resolutions like: “I have to be good this time” or the despairing
feeling: “Why can’t I be good?” when the diet ultimately fails. The binge/diet
cycle is so central to your disorder that understanding it is valuable for 
you, those who care about you, and those who want to help you.
48
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Binge/diet cycling is actually just an example of naturally occurring, self-
correcting human cycles. These cycles are like a pendulum that swings all 
the way in one direction, then, in reaction, swings all the way in the other. 
For instance, in fashion, a period of short hemlines is followed by a period 
of long hemlines — and then is followed by another period of short hemlines.
A couple, feeling too distant from one another, looks for ways to be more 
intimate — and then follows this with a period in which they need a little
more distance. An individual holds in her emotions until one day she
explodes, shocking everyone — leading her to be more careful about 
holding in her emotions.
The more the pendulum swings to an extreme in one direction, the more you
correct for it with an extreme swing in the other direction. It’s just human
nature. In the case of bingeing and dieting, the first half of the cycle is usually
pretty easy to see. You correct for the binge phase with a phase of dieting.
Most likely, it takes a series of binges to accumulate the resolve to correct
with a diet. (By way of contrast, the bulimic person’s binge/purge cycle
involves correcting each and every binge.) You may need to take a closer
look to see the second half of the cycle: how bingeing corrects for dieting. 
I walk you through each phase, one at a time.
First, you may relate to the following thoughts that typically come up after 
a binge:
 I’m disgusting.
 I can’t believe I did it again.
 I hate myself.
 I’ll never get better.
Now, here are some typical thoughts you may have in conjunction with the
resolve to start a diet after a period of bingeing:
 This time I’m really going to do it.
 I’m so excited; I’m going to be thin.
 I’m going to feel good again; I’m going to like myself again.
 I’m in control again.
Notice how the resolve itself, before the diet has even started, begins to
repair your mood and spirit. (If you suspect there’s more here to fix than a
diet is capable of, even if dieting were the right remedy, you have a good
instinct. See the next section on psychological features.)
At this point, the way that you diet is likely to match how extreme your
bingeing feels. At first, the diet provides feelings of healing and hopefulness.
You’re fixing the damage you’ve done. But eventually, the diet feels oppres-
sive. The results aren’t fast enough. The results aren’t enough, period. You
49
Chapter 4: Understanding Binge Eating Disorder

think you should probably eat less. You project forward and can’t imagine
going on in this depriving way until you reach your goal weight. The diet that
seemed like your salvation now feels like a tyrant.
The rebellion brews underground until you reach some tipping point. Perhaps
some other kind of trigger (for example, your job, personal stress, or a disap-
pointment) puts you over the top. Or maybe you just hit your own “I’ve had
it!” threshold. The biggest point here is that the pressure you’ve been putting
on yourself to “fix” yourself leaves another part of you screaming for relief.
This part of you experiences the dieting and your expectations of yourself as
every bit as extreme as the binge. So, knowing deep down that you’ll end up
back on a diet anyway, it “corrects” for the extreme of dieting with an extreme
of bingeing: “For just a darn moment, I’ll have whatever I want!” Your dieting
has triggered your next binge!
As happens so often with eating disordered behavior, you probably stumbled
on dieting innocently as a quick way to deal with a few excess pounds. After
all, everybody else did it. But eventually, the self-correcting nature of the
cycle took on a life of its own, making it very difficult to change.
Secrecy
Your secrecy about your bingeing behavior is very similar to that of the
person with bulimia — you’d probably rather die than have anyone see you
binge or guess that you’re doing it. You feel so much shame — that is, a sense
of personal worthlessness — in relation to your bingeing that you even try to
keep strangers, such as food store owners and food delivery people, from
knowing what you’re up to.
Social withdrawal because of “feeling fat”
For people with bulimia, hiding out from social events to avoid food exposure
is often part of a larger picture of more general social avoidance. This tends
to be less true for people with BED. You may have a good social network.
Your social avoidance has more to do with shame when you “feel fat.” You
may see your weight go up and down the scale and tend to isolate yourself
during “up-the-scale” periods.
Part of your treatment involves determining very frankly whether social 
connection is scarier than you’ve been admitting to yourself. You may be
more like the person with bulimia if periods of bingeing and weight gain have
been operating to provide you with a reason to withdraw to safety.
50

Seeing BED’s Psychological Traits
As is the case with all eating disorder sufferers, those with BED typically
experience underlying psychological distress that contributes to the disor-
der. In the following sections, I discuss the psychological features commonly
exhibited by those with BED. Recognizing those features that apply to you is
essential to your recovery.
Disgust about the bingeing 
relieved by dieting
Of all the words people with BED use to describe their feelings about 
themselves following a binge, “disgust” is the most common. It captures 
the terrible sense of shame that goes with bingeing. If you have BED, these
feelings of shame may also be too much a part of your life in general.
As I discuss in the previous section, “The binge/diet cycle,” just the plan of
going on a diet can feel purifying and relieving, and give you the sense that
you’re solidly back in control. Dieting seems like the perfect antidote for the
wretched feelings of disgust you feel toward yourself after bingeing.
Despair about overcoming the disorder
Once you get a sense of that no-exit quality of the binge cycle, you may under-
standably feel that there’s no way out of the disorder. And that’s just the half
of it! Just like everyone with an eating disorder, you rely on your symptoms to
fix things that really do need fixing, such as managing your emotions.
51
Chapter 4: Understanding Binge Eating Disorder
Connecting BED with other 
psychological disorders
A study by eating disorder researchers at Yale
University found that those with BED tended not
to experience the same severity of underlying
psychological issues as people with anorexia or
bulimia, nor as many companion diagnoses, such
as drug addiction or bipolar illness. (This is, of
course, an individual matter.) However, fully one-
third of BED participants showed higher rates of
depression-related symptoms (low mood and
low self-esteem), and right along with those
symptoms, more severe eating disturbances.

The people who brought us something called Brief Therapy introduced the
important idea that most people get stuck in their symptom patterns because
they’re also stuck pursuing wrong solutions — like food to fix your feelings
and dieting to fix yourself! (Turn to Part II to get going with some better 
solutions!)
Self-worth depends on weight
Even though you invest so much in performing at an outstanding level and
showing the best kind of personal character, when all is said and done, you
still feel you don’t measure up unless you’re thin. You may have a sense of
existing outside the bounds of human deservedness when you’re above a
desired weight — and you don’t believe you’ll be welcomed back in until
you’re thin.
Perfectionism
As a sufferer of BED, you’re likely to be one of the most conscientious people
around. But you hardly know it. You’re so demanding of yourself that you
tend to see mainly your mistakes and often see your successes as flukes. Part
of being you includes needing to be perfect and expecting no less of yourself,
yet never being confident that you’re capable of meeting the mark — or 
certain that you want to keep making the effort! The following examples 
represent perfectionist ways of thinking or behaving:
Liz is project manager on her job. Everybody is singing her praises for
the last project. She feels like a phony because she knows all the things
that could have been done to make it really good if they’d only had 
more time.
Carole’s stomach is in a knot. Tomorrow is Mike’s birthday party and she
has no idea what gift to get for him. She prides herself on always getting
exactly the right thing. She can’t stand thinking of Mike’s lukewarm
response (and everybody else’s) to a gift that’s not perfect.
Notice that the way you react to your body and weight is an extension of the
way you live your life more generally. In Part II, you get some ideas on how
you can work on traits such as perfectionism to give you greater immunity 
to your eating disorder.
Black-and-white thinking
Black-and-white thinking is a way of organizing your experiences by seeing
them as all one way or another, with little room for any thoughts in-between.
52
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

This is a thinking style that tends to get handed down in families from one
generation to the next. (Our families teach us how to think about things.) 
The following thoughts are examples of black-and-white thinking:
 I did a perfect job or I failed.
 I maintained my diet exactly or I blew it.
 I’m a perfect size 4 or I’m disgustingly fat.
This trait shows up in the profiles of those with anorexia and bulimia as 
well as those with BED (see Chapters 2 and 3). Black-and-white thinking is a
trait that seems to set you up for the development of an eating disorder in
the first place, meaning you probably thought in black-and-white ways before
you developed BED. You can read more about this in Chapter 5. Finding
“gray” is important to your recovery.
Need for external approval
This trait seems to pop up in just about everybody with an eating disorder. 
It means setting more store in what others think and want than in your own
views and opinions. You aim to please, and you believe others will like you
better if you mirror them or give preference to their wants. This way of think-
ing can reflect a lack of trust in your own internal guidance system, so that
you rely on others to be sure you’re doing the right thing. It may be a pattern
you saw modeled in one or both parents.
You may already be thinking ahead to how this affects your view of your
body. That’s right — the culture gets to tells you how you should look. To feel
secure in yourself and in your place with others, you feel you have to live up
to the cultural standard of thinness.
Some people have called binge eating the “good girl’s way to be bad.” Given
the powerful way bingeing expresses a voice of I want, you might also call it
the people-pleaser’s way to have a self.
Determining Whether You Have BED
The following questions can help you figure out whether your way of thinking
and eating fits the profile for binge eating disorder.
Keep in mind, this questionnaire in no way substitutes for getting a 
competent diagnosis from a qualified eating disorders professional.
Instructions: Check each item that feels true or mainly true of you. I tell you
how to score your responses at the end of the questionnaire.
53
Chapter 4: Understanding Binge Eating Disorder

1. ❑I think about food, weight, and calories almost all the time.
2. ❑I allow my weight to determine how I feel about myself on any given
day.
3. ❑I frequently binge eat (eat huge quantities of food in a short period of
time).
4. ❑When I binge, I feel as if I have no control over what I’m doing.
5. ❑When I binge, I often feel as if I’m outside myself, watching myself, or
in some other way not in my usual state of mind.
6. ❑I frequently binge when I feel bad or overwhelmed or lonely.
7. ❑I feel worthless, disgusting, and hopeless after a binge.
8. ❑I go to great lengths to keep my bingeing secret from other people.
9. ❑I’ve been on every diet there is.
10. ❑My weight goes up and down frequently.
11. ❑When I decide to start another diet, it makes me feel hopeful about
being in control again and getting thin.
12. ❑It’s not unusual for me to start and stop dieting many times in the
course of a year.
13. ❑I’m either following my diet to the letter or I feel I’ve blown it.
14. ❑At some point, every diet begins to feel unfairly difficult — the
rewards are too few; the effort is too great.
15. ❑I’m frequently depressed.
16. ❑I rarely feel that I am good enough.
17. ❑It’s very important to me to get everything perfect.
18. ❑I’m a “people-pleaser.”
19. ❑I often feel others are judging me and finding me wanting.
20. ❑I’d like myself better — and others would like me better too — 
if I were thinner.
Scoring: Give yourself one point for every item you checked.
If you scored 12 or 13 points, you’re showing many warning signs of BED.
Maybe you’re hovering around that line between disordered eating and an
eating disorder. No time like the present to respond!
If you scored 15 points or more, this is strongly suggestive of the binge
eating disorder pattern. Awareness about treating BED is growing. You can
begin finding out about what to do to get well in Part II.

f just one thing caused eating disorders, they would probably be a lot
easier to treat and to prevent. In reality, no single smoking gun exists.
Instead, a variety of risk factors appear to come into play — physical, social,
and psychological — that can pile up to make you increasingly vulnerable. In
this chapter you find out what the most important risk factors are and how
they set you up to develop an eating disorder.
Some of these factors may be familiar to you. You may already have an
inkling that all those skinny images you see in fashion magazines are stoking
your urgency to be thin. Or that an all-or-nothing way of thinking makes you
extra hard on yourself when you diet. Other factors may come as a surprise.
For instance, did you know your brain chemistry could influence you to
starve or overeat?
Eating disorder risk factors range from those over which you have no control
(your genes) to those over which you can develop increasing control (such
as the way you react to your particular family environment or deal with your
emotions). In Part II you get ideas about how to better manage those risk fac-
tors over which you can exercise some control.
Table 5-1 sums up all the risk factors for developing an eating disorder I dis-
cuss in this chapter. Notice that for each risk factor, I indicate whether it is or
isn’t a factor that’s potentially under your control, at least partially or under
certain circumstances. With your eating disorder recovery, as elsewhere in
life, knowing what you can control and what you can’t is extremely useful.
That way you know where to put your energies for getting better!

Looking at Family Traits that May
Influence Eating Disorders
Eating disorder gene studies are in their infancy. What’s more, it’s mighty
hard to separate those personality traits that are inherited from those that
can be attributed to environment — that is, traits that are genetic versus
those you derive from living day-to-day with people who handle life’s 
challenges in a particular way. There’s no blood test to make it all clear.
56
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Further complicating the matter is the fact that some traits appear to team
up genetically, meaning that if you are predisposed to an eating disorder, 
you are also more likely to be susceptible to related conditions, such as
depression or substance abuse. I discuss this in greater detail in the section,
“Co-existing symptoms run in families,” later in this chapter.
Why should you even care? Zeroing in on genetic contributions to the eating
disorders puts researchers in a better position to develop useful medical
treatments. Knowing which traits tend to team up genetically can put your
eating disorder specialists on the lookout for related problems, like depres-
sion, that you may not notice or report. And, for generations after you, 
knowledge about heritability will lead to improved prevention strategies.
Finding out what runs in families
Your family tree may play a significant role in your eating disorder. Eating 
disorders have been found to run in families, as have the traits that make you
more vulnerable to developing an eating disorder. Symptoms that are likely to
co-exist with your eating disorder have family ties as well. I discuss each of
these in more detail in the following sections.
Eating disorders run in families
Researchers have discovered that if somebody in your family has an eating
disorder — or even some kind of disordered eating pattern — you are more
likely to develop an eating disorder yourself. If that somebody is your mother
or sister, your chances are even greater. These findings suggest that your
genes comprise part of the risk picture for developing an eating disorder.
Research further indicates that the genetic connection is strongest for
anorexia. This doesn’t mean, however, that you can inherit anorexia. What
you can inherit are traits that make you more vulnerable to certain eating 
disorders, like anorexia, as I explain in the next section.
Vulnerability traits run in families
Certain personality traits or psychological characteristics are more likely
than others to trigger eating disorders. These characteristics are known as
vulnerability traits because they make those who possess them more vulnera-
ble to developing an eating disorder. These triggers may be personality traits
such as perfectionism or anxiety (see the section “Looking at Your Individual
Vulnerability Traits” for more on these), or hormonal factors that have a 
psychological impact, such as those that affect mood or appetite (I review
these in the section “Zapping the Brain with Hormones”).
57
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

Information from gene studies suggests that families may also show 
clusterings of the genes for these inherited vulnerability traits. Researchers
from Harvard and Michigan State University see in the collective research 
evidence that anorexia and bulimia are two distinct disorders with different
sets of contributing genes. For more on gene clusterings, see the sidebar
“Environment shapes gene expression.”
Co-existing symptoms run in families
Two sets of symptoms that commonly occur along with eating disorders are
also highly likely to be found in the relatives of people with eating disorders:
 Major depression is more likely to be found in people with bulimia and
their relatives than in the general population.
 Substance abuse occurs at an elevated rate among binge eaters and
their relatives.
Co-existing symptoms like depression and substance abuse worsen eating
disorders and make treatment more complicated. Just how these symptoms
relate to the development of eating disorders is a subject I discuss further 
in Chapter 7.
Seeing family patterns that 
may feed eating disorders
Families don’t cause eating disorders in their children any more than they
cause their children to fail at math, write bad poetry, or have hangnails. That
said, certain family styles may provide more fertile soil in which a budding
eating disorder can take root.
Overorganized family style
In an overorganized family, members are likely to feel the safety of pre-
dictability and a strong sense of belonging and unity. The family motto is 
“All for one and one for all.” However, the same conditions make it difficult to
feel okay about personal opinions, feelings, or needs that are different from
the rest of the family’s. When compliance — going along to get along — is
highly prized, gaining a sense of confidence or independence can be hard.
Disagreements feel threatening to the family’s harmonious view of itself, so
members don’t learn how to resolve conflicts. Conflicts remain buried, caus-
ing ripples beneath the unified exterior. Because emotions are not valued,
family members don’t discover how to know and express their unique inner
worlds of opinion, desire, and need.
Although any of the eating disorders can emerge from an overorganized
family, anorexia is the most likely. The anorexic child needs to find ways to
58
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

balance the rewards of connection to her family — which she gets from being
compliant and agreeable — with her needs for a private niche of her own in
which she has final control. Often the symptoms of anorexia not only supply
this private empire, but they also serve to distract everyone from troubles
brewing in other parts of the family, which are more threatening to the family’s
view of itself (for instance, unaddressed marital conflict between the parents).
Overorganized families appear to subscribe to the following beliefs:
 We are one.
 We all do exactly what’s expected of us.
 We never fight.
 We are a family of few words, emotionally speaking.
These beliefs describe a family that
 Prizes togetherness and being alike over privacy and individuality
 Controls members’ behavior within a narrow range
 Strongly avoids conflict
 Discourages expression of emotion
Overorganized families often have difficulty with developmental transitions.
Such transitions call on families to change the way they relate to each other
to allow for a child’s growing abilities. Transitions are not easy for any family.
But they’re particularly tough for overorganized families who tend to be rigid
about their ways of doing things and are, in general, pretty change-phobic.
The transitions that see children into adolescence and into young adult-
hood — the very ones where eating disorders are most likely to pop up — are
especially difficult because they emphasize greater autonomy and separation
in families that have always put togetherness first. Other kinds of transitions
that can strain overorganized families and trigger the onset of an eating 
disorder include
 Entering a new school
 Moving to a new neighborhood or city
 Changing of a parent’s job status, for example, a new schedule,
increased responsibilities, or job loss
 Changing of a parent’s marital status through divorce or remarriage
Underorganized family style
Chaos and unpredictability are the hallmarks of an underorganized family
style. Bulimia may develop as a pattern of coping in an underorganized
family. The dieting that almost always comes first (see “Dieting as the
59
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

Gateway to Eating Disorders,” later in this chapter) initially provides the 
reassurance of rules and structure where everything else is chaotic. Bingeing
enters the scene as a source of predictable comfort and emotional soothing.
When a parent suffers from an addiction, as is often the case in underorga-
nized families, bingeing copies the coping strategy of the addicted parent;
that is, to manage uncomfortable experiences and feelings with something
you swallow.
Like overorganized families, underorganized families really don’t know how
to manage emotions. Eventually the binge/purge cycle replays the emotional
chaos of the family, while at the same time providing a predictable rhythm 
to life. Here are some of the features that can help you recognize an 
underorganized family:
 You never know what will happen next. The underorganized family 
has too little in the way of structure, rules, or guidance. Members can’t
relax into any sense of safety or reliability about the fundamentals of
family life.
 Mom (dad) has her (his) own addiction to worry about. One or both
parents commonly have some kind of active addiction, which, of course,
makes day-to-day life that much more unpredictable.
 You roll from crisis to crisis. Underorganized families aren’t very good
at predicting what’s coming down the pike or preparing for it. This
makes them more vulnerable to the development of crises and they are
less equipped to handle them when they arise.
 Conflict is right out in the open. Lots of it. And underorganized families
don’t particularly know what to do with it, so nothing much gets
resolved.
 You can’t tell who’s in your corner. Members of underorganized fami-
lies have difficulty bridging the distance from one person to another. 
As a result, individuals find it hard to feel emotional support from their
family. Life in an underorganized family can feel lonely.
Shame-based family style
Shame is a sense of personal worthlessness that judges the entire self. 
I provide a closer look at shame when I talk about traits of eating disorder–
prone individuals a little later in this chapter (see the section “Experiencing
shame”). But what about when whole families are organized around the princi-
ple of avoiding shame? These families believe that to make mistakes is to risk
humiliation and to be worthless. Their simple strategy is to be perfect and 
to achieve highly. Every member is expected to contribute their fair share of
perfection and high achievement in order to reflect well on themselves and
the family as a whole. Features of the shame-based family are likely to include
 An emphasis on appearances or looking good to others
 Adherence to the belief that they need to be perfect
60
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

 Adherence to the belief that they are worthless if imperfect
 At least one family member with addictive behavior
 Cycling between phases of peace and phases of addictive loss of control
As you might imagine, these families tend to be pressure cookers. It’s not
unusual for a family member to develop an addiction, which expresses the
impossibility of living up to standards of perfection. Tension-relieving, 
addictive breakouts from these standards are inevitable. People are, after 
all, only human. But since members of a shame-based family don’t accept
their flawed humanness, they must compensate for the addictive breakout
with more perfect behavior. This sets the stage for the next breakout, and so
the cycle continues. The dynamic is the same as that of the binge/diet cycle
(see Chapter 4) and is common in shame-based families. Shame and perfec-
tionism are key contributing factors in all of the eating disorders, so any one
of them may develop in a shame-based family.
A few other family effects
A few other family characteristics have been found to make an eating 
disorder more likely. These characteristics may potentially appear in any 
of the family styles described in the preceding sections. They include
 A parent who is visibly overly concerned about her own weight and
appearance
 A parent with disordered eating behavior
 Too much emphasis, especially negative, on a child’s appearance or
eating habits
 Urging a child to diet or otherwise lose weight
 Using food for reward or punishment
 “Sexualizing” of the family environment; for instance, inappropriate 
comments or disclosures
 Unclear boundaries between mother/father and daughter
Looking at Your Individual Vulnerability
No single risk factor causes an eating disorder. But each of the characteristics
I discuss in this section can make a person more vulnerable to developing 
an eating disorder. Whereas the traits I discuss in the previous sections
derive from families, the traits I cover in this section affect individual thought
processes. The more of these individual characteristics you possess, the
more vulnerable you are to eating disorders.

Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

Managing emotions poorly
One of the primary purposes having an eating disorder serves in your life is
that it helps you to manage emotions. Restricting has the capacity to make
the restrictor feel in control and therefore calm and reassured. Bingeing can
soothe, comfort, calm, and distract. Both restricting and bingeing can numb
and suppress emotions.
Part of feeling sound and stable as an adult is having the confidence to
handle whatever life brings your way. You especially want to know that you
can manage the tough feelings life events might stir up, such as grief, rage,
humiliation, or rejection, as well as the more day-to-day emotions like disap-
pointment, anger, annoyance, worry, sadness, boredom, envy, and so on.
When you don’t know how to stay on an even keel emotionally, you are 
constantly threatened with being overwhelmed. Being overwhelmed means
crossing the line from a state of “I can manage” to a state of “I can’t manage;
this is too much for me.” If you have constructive coping methods already
built in, you can use these resources to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Positive
coping methods can include
 Calling a friend
 Meditating or praying
 Breathing deeply
 Practicing yoga
 Using problem-solving skills
Those who don’t have these skills at their disposal will do whatever it takes
to lower the distress level, even if it’s destructive and causes its own bad 
feelings — including restricting, bingeing, and purging behaviors. Eating dis-
orders supply alternative emotional coping methods. If you haven’t acquired
sufficient skills for managing your emotions, you are at greater risk for 
developing an eating disorder.
Whatever treatment you choose as a way to work on your eating disorder, 
it’s likely to include a big focus on developing emotion management skills. If
you’d like to get a jump-start, turn to Chapter 14.
Having a history of trauma
Trauma refers to any experience that overwhelms a person’s ability to cope
at the time it occurs. Trauma shatters boundaries of self, along with any
sense of personal effectiveness and control. An eating disorder later in life
62
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

can reflect the effects of early trauma. Eating disorder symptoms may repre-
sent an attempt to establish a sense of boundaries and control that was lost in
early trauma.
Because children have fewer coping resources than adults, disturbing life
events can more easily tip them into trauma. If the trauma involves key care-
givers, a child may lose her most important trauma-buffering resource. Trauma
is deeply disruptive to the life course of the person who experiences it (see
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder For Dummies by Mark Goulston [Wiley]). When it
occurs in childhood, it pulls the child out of her normal developmental track —
an excess of energy is required for coping — so trauma can have especially 
far-reaching effects for children.
Researchers find that people with bulimia are the most likely among eating
disordered people to have trauma histories. Those who suffer from bulimia
are especially likely to come from underorganized families (see the earlier 
section, “Underorganized family style,” for more information). These families
are very crisis-prone and often ill-equipped to protect their members from
trauma. They can’t seem to stop potentially traumatic events from occurring,
and, when traumatic events do occur, they can’t support their members
enough to buffer the traumatic effects.
Common types of trauma
The most common sources of trauma reported by bulimic people and those
with other eating disorders include
 Sexual abuse, including incest
 Physical abuse
 Verbal and emotional abuse
 Neglect
 Catastrophic loss
Studies show that people with eating disorders report significantly higher
levels of trauma history than the general population but not more than people
with other psychological disorders. Trauma doesn’t specifically predict an
eating disorder; it increases vulnerability. Other factors, including genes, 
personality, and environment, help determine whether the vulnerability is
expressed as an eating disorder.
Factors that affect the impact of trauma
How greatly will a traumatic experience affect you? It appears to depend on a
number of factors existing at the time of the traumatic event, including
63
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

 Age (the younger you are, the fewer internal resources you have to help
you respond)
 How well or poorly you were functioning when the trauma occurred
 How severe the trauma was
 Whether the trauma was a one-time event or ongoing
 Whether the trauma was inflicted by a family member (that is, someone
you trusted and depended upon) or a stranger
 How well your support system responded if you reported abuse
If you have trauma in your history, you probably have to devote a lot of
energy to keeping it in a separate compartment, out of awareness, so you 
can get on with your life without too much disruption. An eating disorder
often serves this purpose. Food is not only comforting, but it also creates
vivid sensations that help distract your attention. Preoccupation with dieting
can do the same thing. You may be putting distance between yourself and
unmanageable feelings related to trauma by entering the world of the obses-
sive behaviors, emotions, and beliefs that make up your eating disorder. At
the same time, the symptoms are a continuing signal that something just
doesn’t feel right and needs fixing.
Experiencing shame
Most people with eating disorders are struggling with a lot of shame. Much of
it is a reaction to the eating disorder symptoms themselves (such as vomiting
and bingeing — almost always done in secret). But shame often predates the
eating disorder and is one of those experiences that can help make a person
a sitting duck for development of an eating disorder.
Living with shame means living with a chronic sense of personal inadequacy
and chronic fear that your inadequacies will be exposed and that you’ll be
humiliated and unloved. In an actual moment of shame, you judge your total
self and find it worthless. Shame is the state in which you wish the earth
would open beneath you so you could disappear. It includes the belief that
others will judge you the same way you’ve judged yourself, so in your imagi-
nation you have been excluded from society. Shame makes you feel alone and
like an outcast.
If you live with a lot of shame, you probably grew up in a shame-based family
(see the earlier section, “Shame-based family style”) in which at least one
other member, most likely a parent, struggled with shame and didn’t know
what to do with it.
64
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Dieting, with its promise of making you just what society most admires, can
be almost irresistible if you feel like a shamed outcast. Many eating disor-
dered people say that being able to achieve the slim body most other people
in the culture only dream of (or the prospect of achieving it) makes them feel
special or out-of-the-ordinary. It’s a perfect antidote for feeling worthless and
inadequate. Dieting, taken to the nth degree to fix shame, is a well-traveled
path to an eating disorder.
Seeking perfection
Perfectionism is often attempted as a “cure” for shame. You may go to
extremes to get everything right or to avoid mistakes. Or maybe you put a big
effort into keeping up appearances so that the you the world sees will cover
the you underneath that feels so unworthy. The demands can be exhausting
and endless. They can make for a joyless existence in which your personal
needs and desires must take a back seat to your public image.
65
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors
Dissociation
If you binge or purge, you may very well experience
a feeling of being somehow outside yourself, as if in
some kind of numb, altered, or disconnected state,
while the behavior goes on. A state in which, in one
way or another, you have stepped outside your
usual sense of self is a dissociated state.
Dissociation is a method of coping in which our
mind reflexively heads for the awareness exits
when something is coming that we think we can’t
stand. Dissociation is often associated with early
abuse. It makes sense. The younger the child, the
fewer other ways the child has of dealing with such
an overwhelming experience. By adulthood, the
mind can not only be avoiding reminders of the
childhood trauma, but it can now also be using 
dissociation to avoid just about any experience that
feels too intense to manage.
Johan Vanderlinden and Walter Vandereycken, a
Belgian research team, have discovered that
bulimic women who dissociate extensively are
more likely to engage in some kind of self-injury
behavior such as cutting or burning. Pain associ-
ated with these behaviors may serve any of the fol-
lowing purposes, depending on the woman:
 To distract or feel relief from emotional pain
 To cue entry into a dissociated state in order to
avoid some overwhelming experience
 To stimulate body sensation when in a numb or
dissociated state as a way to move out of the
numbness
 To unconsciously reenact abuse or neglect,
this time being in charge of the pain
 To be in charge of current pain, since it seems
unavoidable
 To express body hatred or self-hatred
If you have dissociative symptoms, you need to
work with an eating disorder specialist who is
experienced in working with these symptoms. 
I describe this in more detail in Chapter 10.

The perfectionism “cure” raises some pretty basic questions about your life:
 Am I good enough as I am?
 Am I deserving, even when I’m imperfect?
 Do my own needs matter?
If you’re at risk for an eating disorder, you can’t struggle with these questions
openly. A compliant part of you has already decided the answer to each 
question is “No.” A big part of being perfect is dieting perfectly and being the
perfect size (though people who binge have an interesting way of keeping
protest alive, even if unacknowledged, on these matters. You can hear the
protest in the binge voice of “I want!” You can read more about this in
Chapter 4).
Thinking in black-and-white
With a black-and-white mind-set, there’s no gray area or middle ground in
which a mixture of feelings or experiences can exist, such as basic support
and approval with a few criticisms, momentary gaffes in a basically capable
person, or friends who still love you even if they can’t always be available or
if they disappoint you. Things are all either one way or another, so a drop of
anything negative poisons what’s otherwise fine.
For instance, what happens when you have a bad day? Perhaps your boss,
who is usually supportive, points out some flaws in your work. You may 
feel devastated, but you’re looking forward to getting some feedback (and
comfort) about your day from your best friend. But then you find out that
your friend isn’t available, even though the two of you had talked about 
getting together. On the way home, the heel of your favorite pair of shoes
breaks in the middle of traffic. Hobbling, you stop for an ice cream cone and
then go home with the following thoughts going through your mind:
66
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 
Shame versus guilt
Shame is different from guilt. When you feel guilt,
some behavior, impulse, or thought gets put in the
hot seat, but other parts of you are left off the hook.
In other words, you still have a basically intact self
to deal with guilty feelings. You can think of ways to
set things right with whatever is making you feel
guilty — you can apologize, fix what you broke, be
kinder or more honest next time — and thus repair
your image of yourself. With shame, your entire self
is judged and found unworthy. That’s much harder
to fix.

 My boss thinks I’m a loser. He’ll never give me more responsibility.
 My friend is pulling away. Doesn’t anyone want to spend time with me?
 I’ll never be able to show my face on the corner where I broke my heel
again. Everyone could see what a klutz I am!
 I had the stupid ice cream cone. I’ve blown it now. I’m such a glutton. 
I may as well eat all that ice cream in the freezer as well.
Notice how easily black-and-white thinking can end up in insulting 
conclusions about yourself. I’m a loser. Nobody likes me. I’m a klutz. I’m 
a glutton. This is extremely bad for your mental health! And these personality
generalizations easily slide into black-and-white criticisms about your 
body — the kind that can lead to eating disorders. Extra fat on your thighs
says everything there is to be said about your entire body, your looks in 
general, your personal discipline, and you as a person. (How did that fat get
there in the first place, and why haven’t I gotten rid of it by now? I can’t look 
the way I should. I’m gross. I’m worthless.)
Needing external approval
Some people listen to their own internal guiding voice to make decisions and
form opinions. These people are thought of as centered and self-confident.
Others often don’t seem to be aware of having an internal guiding voice. They
achieve confidence only when they get a seal of approval from others. Their
own voice, should they find it, is either untrustworthy or doesn’t count. If
you need a lot of external approval, here are some ways that pattern may
have developed:
 Growing up in a family whose members are preoccupied with what
others think
 Growing up without enough encouragement for your own opinions and
feelings to be able to develop any confidence in them
 Growing up on a constant diet of criticism
 Growing up in an environment of abuse or neglect (pleasing others
becomes a way to adapt)
Women in this culture receive the message practically from birth that society
will reward them for achieving the correct body size and shape and will shun
them for having the wrong shape.
If you are already vulnerable to trusting outside sources more than yourself
to define what’s right for you, contemporary culture is there to tell you how
you should look and what priority to give it. The message is so strong that
even centered, secure women struggle with it. For approval-seekers, the 
cultural message can be an irresistible road to an eating disorder.
67
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

Avoiding growing up
If you’ve developed an eating disorder as a girl or young woman, you may
have fears about moving on to the next stage of life. Sometimes these are 
conscious fears; other times, not so much. Maybe you are nervous about
social expectations you don’t feel ready to tackle, such as peer relationships
with less parental supervision, dealing with cliques, and so on. Maybe your
fears focus on sexual development and dating. If you are an older teen or
young woman, perhaps your challenges are about separating from your
family and that which is familiar and taking on the responsibilities of the
adult world.
The ability to put on the developmental brakes via an eating disorder is 
particularly obvious with anorexia. Anorexia can seem to roll back time by
giving an anorexic girl a pre-pubertal body. However, even if less obvious, any
of the eating disorders offers a world of more immediate stuff to think about
and pushes the scary stuff of development farther down the road.
While you can certainly arrive at growing-up fears on your own steam, if 
you have them, you are probably also dealing with complications such as 
the following:
 Family members who are also anxious about you growing up and leaving
 A parent or sibling who had serious difficulties with the same transition
 A major loss or life change in the family’s recent past that has reduced
personal and/or family resources to help support this next stage of
growth
Zapping the Brain with Hormones
As you read this, medical scientists are busy trying to figure out whether 
individual brain chemistry may help explain why some people develop eating
disorders while others in the same environment do not. Some interesting
quirks of our brains are showing up from this research, namely, that the very
same brain mechanisms and chemicals that affect our eating and appetite
also regulate the moods and behaviors typical of eating disorders.
If everyone planning on developing an eating disorder would just raise 
their hands, scientists could measure their brain chemicals now, before they
have the disorder. They could then compare these with people who aren’t
planning on having an eating disorder. That way, they could see whether
there are any brain chemicals that create greater risk for these disorders.
68
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Because this kind of foresight exists only in fantasy, the best scientists can do
is to measure brain chemicals of people who already have an eating disorder
and measure them again when these same people are in recovery. This leaves
to guesswork whether unusual levels found when the disorder is still “active”
were there before, influencing the disorder’s development, or whether the
physiological changes produced by starvation, bingeing, purging, or severe or
frequent weight fluctuations made the person’s brain chemistry go haywire.
Tinkering with your mood 
and appetite: Serotonin
If you or anyone you know has been medicated for depression or anxiety, 
you probably know about SSRIs, the medications that allow more of your
body’s natural brain chemical, serotonin, to keep circulating in your system.
The extra circulating serotonin seems to help combat both depression and
chronic anxiety, as well as some other problems that frequently come up 
with eating disorders.
Serotonin is a particular kind of hormone called a neurotransmitter.
Neurotransmitters are brain chemicals used by brain circuits to communi-
cate with different parts of the brain and control our movements, thinking
processes, moods, body states, and other human experiences. Brain circuits
are made up of individual neurons that “talk” to each other by releasing 
neurotransmitters from one neuron to the next, thus communicating the 
circuit’s intentions. When things go wrong in brain circuit communication,
you experience symptoms. Often symptoms can be improved by influencing
neurotransmitter activity with drugs like SSRIs.
Serotonin acts in circuits in many parts of the brain, with different effects
depending upon where it’s acting. Medical researchers at the University of
Pittsburgh have shown a disruption in serotonin’s activity in several groups
of women with eating disorders:
 Women with anorexia and bulimia showed low levels of serotonin
activity. Low serotonin levels, it turns out, are associated with impulsive
behavior. In fact, the lower the serotonin levels of the bulimic women,
the more likely they were to binge and purge.
 Women in recovery from anorexia and bulimia showed the opposite
serotonin abnormality. Their serotonin levels were higher than normal.
Higher serotonin levels are associated with anxiety, perfectionism, 
ritualistic behaviors, and obsessive thinking, characteristics of eating
disordered people that these women still displayed.
69
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

A couple of other things in addition to these findings make researchers 
think serotonin could play an important role in the development of eating 
disorders — and possibly in their cure:
 SSRIs have been helpful in the treatment of bulimia and, to a lesser
extent, in the treatment of anorexia. This makes a pretty strong case for
serotonin levels having something to do with eating disorder symptoms.
 Several of the problems the SSRIs are known to help improve are 
also problems that are associated with the development of eating 
disorders. I mentioned a few already: anxiety, perfectionism, impulsivity,
and obsessive thinking. Others include depression and full-blown 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
 Serotonin suppresses appetite. Abnormal serotonin levels may possibly
contribute to restricting or bingeing behavior.
Carbohydrates, a favorite binge food, are the only suppliers of tryptophan, an
essential building block used to create serotonin in your brain. One theory is
that bingeing on carbs is your brain’s effort to increase serotonin levels and
thus treat itself for depression or anxiety.
Making it feel so rewarding: Dopamine
Dopamine is another neurotransmitter, that is, a chemical messenger in the
brain. One of the many things dopamine does is to modify your experience 
of pleasure. Dopamine may shine a bright light on experiences that give 
you pleasurable feelings. If your brain pays attention and stores these 
experiences, you make better choices about what to repeat in the future.
Reward circuitry of the brain uses dopamine to highlight the experience of a
food’s tastiness. Your brain wants you to remember and do this again! When
a food experience, enhanced by dopamine, makes your reward circuits light
up, it can override signals telling you when you’ve had enough.
70
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 
His serotonin response vs. her serotonin response
According to findings at MIT’s Clinical Research
Center, women start off with lower serotonin levels
in their brains than men. (I know; there’s no justice.)
When a woman goes on a diet, her serotonin-chal-
lenged brain now has to make do with even less,
especially if she’s on a low-carb diet. Without
enough carbs, her body can’t make tryptophan, and
without tryptophan, her brain can’t make more
serotonin. What with serotonin’s mood and
appetite-regulating effects, this will leave her
hungry and crabby at best, possibly depressed.
And what about a guy on the same diet? His sero-
tonin levels — and thus his mood — are relatively
unscathed. This may be another piece of the puzzle
explaining why women are so much more likely to
develop eating disorders than men.

The same researchers who looked at serotonin in people with eating 
disorders have also found that dopamine is working overtime in women
recovering from anorexia. This may sound like it should be a good thing. But
in reality, two important anorexia-related qualities may be compromised by
dopamine overactivity:
 The reward experience of eating: For previously anorexic women, the
ability to take pleasure from eating is diminished.
 Learning from experience: Researchers think having dopamine activity
levels popping in the brain may help explain the denial — that is, not
learning from experience — that is so characteristic of anorexia.
Researchers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York have 
shown that obese people have too few dopamine receptors, brain equipment
dopamine needs to do its job properly. They suspect that obese people may
be overeating in an effort to stimulate the reward experience that people who
have their fair share of dopamine receptors get from a lesser amount of food.
A logical question under investigation is whether eating-disordered bingeing
also reflects having too few dopamine receptors. Of course, the really 
important question is: Can the research findings lead to improved treatment?
A Culture that Breeds Eating Disorders
Eating disorders don’t occur at the same rate in all cultures everywhere.
What ingredients are present in our current culture to make such a potent
brew for the creation of eating disorders?
Succumbing to the media
Most people in the mainstream culture — where eating disorders tend to
develop — get their ideas about how their bodies should look from the
media: magazines, movies, TV, and the like. In particular, the female bodies
they see are 15 to 25 percent smaller than the average woman’s, not to 
mention that these bodies are airbrushed and sculpted to perfection by 
cosmetic surgery. The clothing that is on display is designed for model-thin
bodies, so the average-sized woman is made to feel she is too big to wear
what is fashionable. These images have special clout because they are with
us everywhere and all the time, making these thoroughly abnormal body
types seem ordinary and achievable.
Studies consistently find that interesting things happen when people are
exposed to these images of perfection, besides making them cranky (yes,
really!). Whether male or female, young or old, when people see media
images of ideal-sized models, they are more likely to be unhappy with their
71
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

own bodies, to feel distressed and insecure, and to become motivated to do
whatever it takes (usually dieting and/or exercise) to make themselves look
like these impossible images.
The media has done more than display slender images as the norm. Women’s
magazines, in particular, have actively sold the message that achieving a 
slimmer body will help you achieve a happier, more successful life. Just buy
their magazine or the products inside, and that life is all yours.
Getting slim at any price
Women are especially affected by images of the slim standard because they
know they will be judged by them. Researchers hear from both men and
women that a woman will be sized up first and foremost by her appearance.
Weight may affect a woman’s ability to get a job or to get ahead in it, the
amount of money she makes, or her ability to get a mate. Overwhelmingly,
American women report that they are unhappy with their bodies.
At least when our great-grandmothers were dealing with the fashion in body
shape, there were contraptions to do the job for them — stays, cinches, 
girdles. Not that these were a walk in the park. But a quirk of modern expec-
tations for women is that the fashionable image is no longer a matter of 
hitching things in. The body itself is supposed to be made fashionable (that
is, slim and fit) through personal effort. The result is that fashion is no longer
just fashion; it has become a test that demonstrates an individual’s discipline
and moral character. Your body is supposedly a walking advertisement of
your willingness and ability to be in control of your life generally. (Yikes!)
The marriage of fashion and health messages has only made the stakes
higher. When medical experts advised the government that obesity was a 
disease — some claiming that even an extra 20 pounds could put your health
at risk — a medical blessing was given to the idea that no sacrifice for 
slimness is too great.
Fearing cultural disapproval
Our culture not only saves its rewards and approval for the thin, it makes out-
casts of the obese. Not only do obese people not look the way we think they
should, but study after study shows we also assign all kinds of negative char-
acter traits to them: they have no will power and are lazy, morally weak, unin-
telligent, sloppy, emotionally immature, and sexually maladjusted.
72
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

Training begins very early. Even preschoolers report negative associations
with overweight and obese people. By the time these children are adults,
they are likely to graduate into the culture’s extreme fat phobia. A Yale
University study revealed the sacrifices ordinary adults would be prepared to
make in order not to be fat. Almost half of the people who responded
reported they’d give up a year of life. Another 15 percent would give up ten
years. People would give up having children, eyesight, an arm, or a leg, or be
depressed or alcoholic — any of these would be better than being fat.
After death and torture, the most powerful threat you can hold over anyone
is the prospect of being a social outcast. If you have an eating disorder, you
are likely to respond especially strongly to external standards for approval.
As such, you tend to reflect and magnify the fat phobia of the mainstream cul-
ture and the thin-at-any-price thinking that goes with it. Although it may feel
impossible to you now, developing ways to challenge the culture’s extremes
about body size is an important part of your recovery.
If you have a daughter, she is absorbing media images and the eating disorder
risk that goes with them, more so than boys. You can encourage her to think
about what she’s seeing, rather than just absorb it all uncritically. Depending
on her age, you might ask her the following questions:
 Do the people look like other people she knows?
 What’s the message about weight and appearance?
 Are there examples in her own life that are different from this message?
 Does somebody benefit from selling the message? Who?
By helping her think critically about what she’s seeing and ask questions, you
can help her develop internal buffering from a possible eating disorder in 
the future.
Dieting as the Gateway 
to Eating Disorders
Almost everybody with an eating disorder will tell you it all started with a
diet. However, if you read the other parts of this chapter, you know that
much has already gone on beneath the surface to make an eating disorder
likely. Nevertheless, dieting still seems to be the most frequent “switch” for
setting all the machinery of the disorder into motion.
73
Chapter 5: Eating Disorder Risk Factors

Of all the risky things you can do, think, or feel, dieting is the one that most
strongly predicts an eating disorder will follow. Keep a special alert out for
this risk factor.
Dieting feels like control
Dieting provides the future anorexic person with feelings of personal control,
perhaps for the first time in her life. For the binger, dieting provides “absolu-
tion” for the binge and a sense of regaining lost control. For both, dieting
seems to be the promised road to gaining admiration for her appearance.
What actually happens is that dieting simply leads to more and stricter diet-
ing and eventual starvation for the person with anorexia. And it inevitably
becomes part of the binge/purge cycle for the person with bulimia or the
binge/diet cycle of the person with binge eating disorder.
Dieting increases the risk 
of eating disorders
Just like the other risk factors I discuss in this chapter, dieting doesn’t, 
by itself, cause an eating disorder. It just makes it more likely — a lot more
likely — to happen in an already vulnerable person. For example, Australian
researchers, reporting their findings in the British Medical Journal in 1999, 
discovered that moderate dieters were five times more likely to develop an
eating disorder than non-dieters; “severe” dieters were eighteen times more
likely to develop an eating disorder.
If you are that “already vulnerable person” I refer to, it means you could be
someone who stumbles onto dieting only to find that it seems to fit like a 
key in a lock, fixing other things in your personality or situation that feel bad.
Anything that seems to solve what hurts in people’s lives has enormous 
staying power.
The best possible advice is to avoid dieting if you haven’t started and to stop
immediately if you have. If you are dieting, or even just watching what you
eat, here are some warning signs that you could be headed down the slippery
slope toward an eating disorder:
74

 You are constantly preoccupied with thoughts about dieting.
 You constantly judge yourself by how well you are doing on the diet.
 You are spending less time with others and more time focusing on 
dieting.
 The goal posts keep shifting on how much is enough to lose.
Any of these could be signals that it’s time to get into gear, read the chapters

Deconstructing Your Body 
with an Eating Disorder
In This Chapter
 Understanding the risks of starvation
 Scoping out the damage done through purging
 Turning things around with recovery
You may think that your eating disorder only causes your body to be
bigger or smaller. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Eating disorders 
give rise to a multitude of unpleasant and even downright harmful side effects.
These can include the erosion of tooth enamel, the development of soft,
downy hair called lanugo on your arms or stomach, or even heart failure.
The unhappy truth is that beyond the limits of what you can see, your eating
disorder is having several physical effects on your body, and they aren’t
pretty. Some of these effects, like lanugo, are kind of shocking but not really
dangerous. Others can severely harm your health and even put your life at
risk. Some of the damage done heals as your eating disorder is managed.
Other kinds of damage can cross the line of no-return, leaving you with 
lifelong impairments.
Why is it important to know these things? Awareness is one of your biggest
allies in your recovery. Even a small increase in awareness about the reality of
your disorder is a contribution to getting better.
In this chapter I go over the hazards associated with eating disorders and the
damaging effects they have on your body. Until eating disorders come with
warning labels, your safety depends on you understanding what you’re doing
to your body as you work toward making more self-caring choices.

Disordering Your Body from the 
Inside Out with Starvation
In a popular TV crime show, each episode includes a scene where the view
zooms right inside a body so we can see what actually happened to bring
about the victim’s demise. If the cause of death were starvation, the view
would have to zoom in on multiple sites within the body to reveal the full
effect. So, let’s take that close-up look!
Dehydration: Risking heart 
failure and more
Starving denies your body of more than just the solid food you think makes
you fat; it also robs your body of essential liquid nourishment. All foods con-
tain nutritious fluids that cannot be compensated for by drinking water alone.
Severely limiting the intake of nutrients and fluids over time causes your 
body to become dehydrated. Severely restricting carbohydrates and fats can
also result in dehydration. Dehydration disrupts and reduces the levels of
important minerals called electrolytes, and it affects heart functioning.
Electrolytes are minerals (you recognize their names: sodium, calcium, 
potassium, and others) that dissolve in fluids, creating an electrical charge on
themselves. This electrical charge allows them to act as conductors to help
move materials in and out of body cells as needed. Electrolytes also conduct

Your health is more important than your weight
You may find it hard to believe that the toll your
eating disorder takes on your body matters com-
pared to losing weight — a response that’s a symp-
tom of your eating disorder! You may also find it
hard to take a lot of the information in because it’s
scary, and you’re still in the grips of your disorder.
What to do? I invite you to do three things.
First, stop and imagine ways to support your read-
ing with openness about how the information in this
chapter may apply to you. Maybe you can recall
some other time you stepped up when it was 
difficult to find out about something. Or you may find
it helpful to think of a friend who always makes the
tough stuff a little more bearable.
Next, use this as an opportunity to imagine how it
might feel if you were to start believing your health
matters as much as, or — dare I say it? — more
than your appearance.
Finally, take in only as much as you can. You can
always come back when you’re ready to take in a
little more.

electrical impulses that stimulate muscles to action. Calcium and potassium
are the electrolytes that are in charge of one of my personally favorite 
muscles, the heart, and are critical for stimulating a regular heartbeat.
Electrolyte imbalances can result in sudden cardiac arrest and permanent
heart damage or death. An early symptom of dehydration and an electrolyte
imbalance is irregular heart rhythm. Left untreated, deadly results can follow:
 Heart muscle atrophy: This is your heart wasting away! A weakened
heart has trouble beating. When you rob your body of nutrients, your
muscles can’t rebuild themselves. The heart muscle gets no special
treatment when it comes to starvation.
 Low blood pressure: The body just naturally shifts into a lower gear to
try to conserve energy when you starve it.
 Orthostatic hypotension: You know how sometimes if you stand up too
fast, you get dizzy? This involves a rapid decrease in blood pressure and
in the heart’s heft in pumping out blood. Electrolyte deficiencies affect
the nervous system response that helps the body right itself. This is
okay if you’re otherwise healthy, but it can contribute to a deadly chain
of events in an already weakened heart.
The heart is not the only part of your body that suffers from dehydration.
Other dangerous effects of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances include
 Kidney damage or failure
 Convulsions, seizures
 Liver damage and failure
 Muscle paralysis (can range from weakness to immobility)
Dehydration is especially risky if you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Blood
sugar levels can be thrown off by dehydration. Too much glucose in your
system can have toxic effects on certain body tissues and eventually do
damage to organs such as the eyes or kidneys. Also, because many of the
medications used to control diabetes cause weight gain, diabetic people with
anorexia are frequently tempted to cut back on their use — often with 
disastrous, even deadly, consequences.
Not all the effects of dehydration are life-threatening, but they reduce your
quality of life and they’re not pretty. Here are some of the nonlethal outcomes
you can expect — or may already be experiencing — from cutting calories to
the bone:
 Abdominal bloating
 Inability of your body to increase blood circulation during exercise
 Constipation
79
Chapter 6: Deconstructing Your Body with an Eating Disorder

 Dark circles under your eyes
 Headaches
 Leg cramps
 Swelling in legs and feet (edema)
 Very dry skin
 Weakness, fatigue
Malnutrition: Undermining your 
body’s essential systems
When you deny your body the nutrition it needs through self-inflicted starva-
tion, you make your body malnourished. Malnutrition results from deficien-
cies of essential protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals in your
diet. Even if you can make your body run on fumes for awhile, beneath the
surface damage to systems and the seeds of breakdown are brewing, such as
 Loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea): A starved body produces
fewer of the hormones needed to stimulate menstrual periods.
(Excessive exercise may also be a cause.)
 Fertility problems: You can’t have a baby if you aren’t having your 
periods.
 Loss of bone minerals (osteopenia) or decreased bone density (osteo-
porosis): This increases your risk of bone fracture, probably as a result
of estrogen deficiency, calcium deficiency, or possibly through an excess
of cortisol, the “stress” hormone. (If you binge and purge, bone loss is
worse.)
 Possible immune abnormalities: Studies show that certain members of
the body’s immune “army” aren’t present in starved bodies in the num-
bers needed for an adequate immune response to infectious invaders.
 Multiple organ failure: That’s right; with enough deprivation, all the
organs in your body can close up shop and quit functioning.
80
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 
Re-feeding syndrome
Surprisingly, many of the physical risks of starvation
can also be caused by its treatment. If you re-feed
a very starved person too quickly, especially with a
high carbohydrate load, their electrolytes and fluids
can be thrown out of whack. This may result in
problems for the heart, muscles, and lungs that can
be fatal. The risks of too-rapid re-feeding were first
discovered in treating starved war refugees. You
can read more about re-feeding as a part of 
inpatient hospital care in Chapter 9.

 Stunting of height/growth: The onset of anorexia while the body is still
in the process of growth is of special concern. This is an effect that can
have lifetime consequences.
 Severe cold sensitivity; cold hands and feet: Starvation throws off your
body’s temperature regulator. Also, lack of fat deprives you of the layer
of warmth that’s intended to protect you from cold.
 Growth of down-like body hair (lanugo): Your body is trying to give
itself a coat to warm up! This occurs in almost a third of people with
severe weight loss due to anorexia.
 Easy bruising: Your body can’t heal itself as well as it should without
certain vitamins. Low blood pressure and low weight make the 
effect worse.
 Anemia and pale skin: Anemia is a disorder in which you end up with
too few of the blood cells that carry the oxygen you breathe to tissues
that need it to fuel energy-making processes. Anemia is often caused by
low iron levels.
 Damage to hair, skin, and nails: This is due to vitamin deficiencies
which cause dry, brittle hair and nails; hair loss; and dry skin.
Wearing Your Body Down with Purging
Purging behaviors are the things you do to try to “undo” the calorie-
accumulating effects of a binge or even ordinary eating. (See Chapter 3 
for more on purging.) Purging behaviors include
 Vomiting
 Laxative abuse
 Use of enemas
 Use of diuretics (products that increase urination, also called 
water pills)
When you purge regularly, you dehydrate your body and you cause wear-and-
tear on your body. Dehydration and body wear-and-tear, in turn, each lead to
a host of harmful effects, which I go over in this section.
Robbing your body of fluids
You’re dehydrated when your body takes in fewer fluids than it loses 
and can’t function normally as a result. Starving is one way to become 
dehydrated, but it’s not the only way. Purging behaviors rob your body of
81
Chapter 6: Deconstructing Your Body with an Eating Disorder

fluids and, along with them, essential minerals. Because of resulting mineral
imbalances, you run the risk of a slowed heart rate, heart attack, or heart 
failure. You can read in detail about these and other effects of dehydration in
the previous section, “Dehydration: Risking heart failure and more.”
You need to be aware of the dangers of dehydration due to purging. First,
because you are harming vital organs, some mortality risk is involved. Your
risk isn’t as high as that of the person who starves, but if it’s your mortality,
that probably doesn’t matter to you. Even if your purging isn’t fatal, you 
can still do serious damage to your body. Second, if you both purge and
starve, you’ve got double trouble. Starvation weakens your body so it’s less
equipped to withstand the harmful effects of purging. You’re at greater risk
than the person who purges without starving.
Putting wear and tear on your body
Purging behaviors can also exert serious wear and tear on body parts. The
effects worsen in accordance with how frequently and strenuously you purge
and how weakened your body has become from other effects of your eating
disorder. Some of the most common or worrisome wear-and-tear symptoms
of purging are
 Broken blood vessels in the eyes: From straining to vomit.
 Puffy face: Due to swollen salivary glands.
 Erosion of tooth enamel: From repeated exposure to stomach acid.
 Sore throat; damage to throat or choking: From implements used to
induce vomiting.
 Inflamed, ulcerated, or ruptured esophagus: Due to vomiting. (A torn
esophagus causes shock; a ruptured one requires surgery.)
 Reflux: The valve-like muscle that joins the esophagus to the stomach
can no longer prevent stomach acids from backing up into the esopha-
gus. Regular contact with these acids causes heartburn and can damage
the lining of the esophagus.
 Stomach rupture, erosion, or bleeding: From straining to vomit.
 Inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis): Caused by vomiting or excess laxative
use. The pancreas swells, causing severe abdominal pain, distention, 
and fever.
 Hiatal hernia: From straining to vomit.
 Chronic diarrhea; loss of normal bowel function: From overuse of 
laxatives.
82
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

If you regularly use ipecac syrup to induce vomiting, you may be poisoning
yourself. Ipecac is poisonous to muscle. If you take too much or take it fre-
quently and it accumulates in your system, you run the risk of cardiomyopathy
(that’s wasting away of the heart muscle), cardiac arrest, seizure, coma, or
shock. Just to be completely clear, ipecac can kill you, and suddenly.
Reversing the Effects with Recovery
Happily, most of the physical symptoms of starving yourself improve as your
weight is restored and you return to sound eating and exercise habits. The
unfortunate exceptions to this may be regaining regular menstrual periods
and adequate bone density.
The two are related. Regular menstrual periods and the estrogen levels that go
with them protect you against bone loss. Although most women with anorexia
return to normal menstruation in recovery, about one-fourth of them do not.
(Of course, this also spells potential fertility problems in the future.) Because
of lacking the bone-protective effects of estrogen, adolescents may lose much
bone density during the critical growth period that normally occurs at this
stage of life. Weight gain does not restore lost bone. Medical scientists are
searching for ways to address the problem as you read this.
83
Chapter 6: Deconstructing Your Body with an Eating Disorder
Bulimia creates reproductive mysteries
Two symptoms of the reproductive system, men-
strual irregularity and a disorder called polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS), are associated with
bulimia for unknown reasons. Here’s what’s known
and what’s suspected in each case:
 Menstrual irregularity: As many as half of
women with bulimia have irregular menstrual
periods. A percentage of these women quit
menstruating altogether. The reasons for this
aren’t as clear-cut as with anorexia. You need a
minimum amount of fat to produce the hor-
mones that regulate the menstrual cycle. It
seems that, even though the bulimic woman
isn’t becoming emaciated, the amount of fat
loss associated with frequent dieting, perhaps
along with high stress levels, can be enough to
throw reproductive hormones off balance.
 Polycystic ovary syndrome:PCOS is a disorder
of the hormone system that occurs in 5 to 10
percent of women in their child-bearing years
and is the most common cause of infertility.
Imbalances of the female reproductive hor-
mones, along with the presence of high levels
of male hormones, cause the formation of cysts
on the ovaries. Risk of PCOS appears to be
higher if you have bulimia or BED. The big fluc-
tuations of food intake that occur in these dis-
orders may throw off reproductive hormone
levels. Women with bulimia have also been
found to have high blood insulin levels, which
can affect PCOS. The good news is that as
women with PCOS and bulimia or BED recover
from their eating disorders, PCOS symptoms
also improve.

Here’s good news if you purge: Except for some of the dental damage caused
by vomiting, your body mostly restores itself from the effects of purging as
you find ways to manage your eating disordered symptoms.

Eating Disorders
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on how anorexia affects your brain
 Facing the risk of suicide and finding help
 Evaluating your risk for other psychological disorders
 Recognizing problems with substance abuse and excessive exercising
E
ating disorders rarely travel alone. One or two other disorders are likely
to be hanging around and making trouble when you’ve already got your
hands full with your eating disorder–related problems. Some of these other
disorders, like the eating disorders themselves, involve compulsive behav-
iors, such as substance abuse. Others affect your mood, such as anxiety and
depression. In this chapter you find out what the most common companion
disorders are. You also find questionnaires to help you determine whether
you may have a particular disorder, and I give you some ideas about where to
turn for help.
You may be thinking that the presence of several problems at once means
something is really wrong with you. On the contrary, mood disorders and
addictions commonly accompany eating disorders — you’re not alone. On
the other hand, you may not even be aware of the significance of other 
problems like chronic anxiety or depression — they may just feel like back-
ground noise. The important thing to understand is that these disorders are
treatable, just like your eating disorder.
Just how the eating disorders and co-existing disorders relate to each other
is not completely understood. In this chapter I clarify what is known so you
can see how the total picture of your symptoms makes sense. This also helps
clarify why treatment is a total package, involving all the ways that things just
aren’t going right or don’t feel right. Before you let that overwhelm you, let
me share the good news: Many of the treatment approaches that help with
your eating disorder also help with these companion disorders.

Altering Thoughts and Perceptions
Anorexia produces some effects on your thoughts and perceptions that don’t
occur among the other eating disorders. These effects have consequences:
They make it harder to participate in both your daily life and your recovery.
An important feature of anorexia is that it’s a progressive disorder, meaning
that it gets worse over time. What makes it progressive? In large part it’s 
the effects of starvation. I discuss the effects of starvation on your body in
Chapter 6. But just as your body needs adequate nutrition to function 
properly, your brain does too!
With anorexia, you can’t think straight!
When you starve your brain, the results show up in your thought processes.
You probably attribute these effects to other causes, like personality, fatigue,
depression, or anxiety. You may be surprised to discover that all of the 
following cognitive effects are common to starving brains:
 You’re not as alert; your mind may feel a little dull.
 You have difficulty concentrating.
 You can’t put your thoughts together quite as clearly as in the past.
 Your judgment isn’t as sound.
 Your thinking is less creative and more rigid.
Your world centers on food and weight
When you have an eating disorder, your primary focus in life revolves around
two things: your weight and food. It’s hard to tell just where all the influences
come from that lead you to focus so completely on weight and food in the
early stages of your eating disorder. I consider some of the personality factors
that come into play in Chapter 5. However when that focus leads you to the
point of starvation, your obsession with food is more easily understandable.
A famous study at the University of Minnesota shows that preoccupations
with food and weight are a predictable outcome of prolonged starvation,
even in people without eating disorders. The study placed normal-eating
World War II conscientious objectors on a diet of half their usual calories.
After six months the subjects were
 Thinking and talking about food more or less constantly
 Developing strange food rituals and eating strange food combinations
86
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

 Hoarding food and other objects
 Withdrawing from social connections
 Feeling blah about much of anything besides food
In other words, after six months of semi-starvation, the subjects ended up in
a food-focused world that looked just like that of the average person with
anorexia. These negative effects can be reversed by providing the brain with
the food it needs.
Recognizing Other Disorders 
That Require Treatment
If you have an eating disorder, you’re very likely to have one or more com-
panion psychological disorders. The presence of other psychological disor-
ders makes your life more difficult and requires treatment in order for you to
get better. Exactly how these companion disorders and eating disorders are
related isn’t known. Some may have slid in on the same genes. Some may
have been there before your eating disorder and made you more vulnerable
to developing it. (See Chapter 5 for more information on eating disorder risk
factors.) It may be years or decades before the connections are understood.
What’s important for you to know now is that these disorders are treatable,
and getting the proper diagnosis and treatment for any that you suffer from
can speed your overall recovery.
Considering suicide
Suicide is often described as a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
Many factors line up to make life’s problems feel overwhelming and unen-
durable to certain people under certain conditions. Additional factors make
some people more likely than others to act on these feelings. The temporary
feelings that lead to suicide can be treated. But the at-risk person has to be
identified in order for treatment to take place and for an unnecessary tragedy
to be prevented.
If you think you may be at risk for becoming suicidal or are already having
suicidal thoughts, take steps immediately to get help. See the sidebar, “Steps
to take if you’re feeling suicidal,” for direction on where to turn.
Who’s most at risk?
Suicidal feelings, attempts, and completed acts occur more frequently among
some groups of people than others. If any of the following characteristics
apply to you, you may be at greater risk:
87
Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders

 You have a mood disorder. Mood disorders, such as major depression,
dysthymia (a less severe type of depression), other forms of depression,
and bipolar disorder make you more susceptible to suicidal thoughts.
 You’re female. This simple fact of gender means that you’re more likely
to attempt suicide (probably because women have a higher rate of mood
disorders). Men, however, are more likely to succeed at their suicide
attempts.
 You’re impulsive. This often describes people with bulimia, bipolar 
disorder, and substance or alcohol abuse problems. Being impulsive
means you’re more likely to act on suicidal feelings.
 You have a family history of depression and/or suicide. This can
include previous generations.
 You have a personal history of suicide attempts. Having made 
an attempt before seems to lower the threshold for making another
attempt.
Suicide and eating disorders
Eating disorders don’t, by themselves, cause you to become suicidal. Risk for
suicidal thoughts and behavior are impossible to disentangle from your
increased risk for depression and/or history of trauma. (You can read about
depression later in this chapter in the section “Dealing with depression: Both
cause and consequence.” I discuss trauma effects in Chapter 5.) The most
important thing for you to know is that if you have anorexia, your chances of
surviving a suicide attempt may be diminished because of the way starvation
weakens your body.
Moving toward suicide
People who are contemplating suicide tend to progress from lower to higher
levels of commitment to the idea. (You can move up and down levels many
times as well, depending on your circumstances.) With each increasing level
of commitment comes a greater risk of suicide, so being frank with yourself is
important in assessing your personal risk. The following are common stages
of becoming suicidal, from lowest to highest in terms of risk:
1. Passing thoughts or urges: You may have fleeting thoughts of ending
your own life, but you quickly dismiss them.
2. Predisposing events and feelings: Mood disorders like depression
and/or anxiety may predispose you to suicidal thoughts. If a particularly
negative event or string of events occurs to boot, such as a loss or a
humiliating experience, your feelings may go from bad to unbearable. At
this point, the mood disorder and the bad experiences may be making
each other worse.
88
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

3. More enduring thoughts or urges: You may have obvious thoughts of
ending your life or more direct ones, such as the belief that you’re no
good to anyone. Your feelings start to focus on the hopelessness of your
situation — it seems as though nothing you or anyone else can do will
make things better.
4. Suicidal intention and planning: You start doing things to let go of life:
putting your affairs in order, leaving “goodbye” messages for people,
giving away possessions. You also take action to give yourself the means
to suicide, such as hoarding medication. This kind of thinking and plan-
ning begins to spin a kind of isolating cocoon around you. It’s important
to know that your thought processes and judgment are probably quite
distorted by this stage.
5. Passive suicidal activity: Many people who either are unaware of their
own suicidal intentions or are standing undecided at the threshold will
engage in dangerous activities that could take the suicidal action for
them. This may include reckless driving, having unprotected sex, or
hanging out in dangerous places.
6. Actual activity to carry out a plan: You put your previous plan into
motion and actually attempt to commit suicide.
Working on your suicidal feelings when your commitment to the idea is at a
low level is less harrowing than when your risk is high. That makes it an
excellent idea to acknowledge these feelings early on and take action to get
treatment before things get worse. This is particularly true if you are in one
or more of the risk categories listed above. The questionnaire in the following
section may also help you determine whether you’re at risk.
Questionnaire: Are you at risk for suicide?
Place a check mark in the boxes next to the statements in the following lists
that reflect your feelings or apply to you. When you respond to the state-
ments, keep the following in mind:
 Thought and action statements are listed according to increasing risk.
 Action statements indicate a higher level of risk than thought statements.
Risky thoughts and feelings:
❑I can’t stand the situation/pain/feelings I’m in any longer.
❑I don’t deserve to live.
❑I see no hope for a better future.
❑I feel my family and friends would be better off without me.
❑My death will make them all sorry.
❑Death feels like a welcome relief.
89
Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders

Risky actions:
❑I’ve been withdrawing from social contact.
❑I’ve been using alcohol or drugs more than usual.
❑I’ve been engaging in reckless and dangerous activities.
❑I’ve written a will or left other instructions about my death.
❑I’ve been giving my belongings away.
❑I’ve written a suicide note.
❑I’ve acquired or begun to acquire the means to kill myself.
Overdoing it: OCD
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is officially listed in the American
Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
among anxiety disorders, but it has it has its own distinct profile and is more
common in people with eating disorders. If you have OCD, you’re plagued by
repeated distressing thoughts and the need to repeat certain ritual behaviors.
According to a study led by researchers from the Universities of Pennsylvania
and Pittsburgh, 40 percent of people with eating disorders also have OCD. (In
the general population, only about 2 to 3 percent of people have OCD.) A
genetic link involving similar brain chemistry appears to exist between the
two disorders.
Too much is never enough
OCD involves too much thinking — the obsession — and too much doing —
the compulsion. Obsessive thoughts, images, or impulses intrude into 
everyday life despite your best efforts to ignore them or make them go away.
Thoughts can involve doing harm to others, harming yourself (by way of
injury, contamination, victimization), sexually distressing content, religious
content, and so on. Obsessive content is senseless — which isn’t news to you
if you have obsessions. But this awareness doesn’t get rid of them or make
them any less upsetting to you.
Compulsions are behaviors (such as hand washing) or mental acts (such as
counting) that you feel you must repeat to ward off the obsessive experience
that you dread. Not being able to perform the compulsive activity is likely to
make you feel very anxious.
Obsessions and compulsions tend to gobble up more and more of your life —
sometimes hours a day — if OCD goes untreated. The symptoms serve to pre-
vent awareness of real issues that may be too upsetting. Any time symptoms
serve this purpose, they tend to get more and more elaborate over time —
kind of like with an eating disorder.
90

OCD and anorexia: The perfect storm
If you have both anorexia and OCD, did the OCD come first and make you
more vulnerable to developing anorexia later? This isn’t clear-cut. What is
known is that OCD just exaggerates anorexia symptoms. Both your thought
processes and your behavior are likely to be farther off-track than those of
people who have anorexia but not OCD. Many experts see an anorexic
person’s fear of fat as a perfect example of an OCD obsession.
Dieting and the numerous food rituals that go with it fit the description of OCD
compulsions, including the intention to contain anxiety about the obsession
(fat). What’s more, people with anorexia and people with OCD are known to
share certain personality characteristics: precision, perfectionism, and —
what shall we call it? — a certain devotion to keeping things in a chosen order
(think of Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets). From this viewpoint, it would
seem that everyone with anorexia also has OCD. But more likely, you have two
separate disorders with important similarities, so you get that perfect storm
when they occur in the same person. As you may guess, getting better is
harder work if you have both.
OCD and other eating disorders
The rate of OCD among people with bulimia, binge eating disorder, and the
nonspecific eating disorders is very high compared to the general population.
Research shows that in most people, OCD develops earlier than the eating dis-
order. OCD is likely to make a person more vulnerable to the perfectionist ten-
dencies associated with eating disorders and to compulsive symptoms like
bingeing and purging. Both the OCD and the eating disorder need to be
treated to ensure an effective outcome.

Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders
Steps to take if you’re feeling suicidal
Are you considering suicide? Here are the steps you
need to take to protect yourself:
1. Determine whether you feel confident that you
can contain your suicidal thoughts and feel-
ings without harming yourself.
If you have even a sliver of a doubt about this,
call 911 or go straight to a hospital emergency
room. Don’t wait for the feelings to go away.
Don’t wait for your boyfriend to finish work. Get
protection first and everything else can follow.
2. If you feel you’re in a suicidal crisis but are cer-
tain that, at least for now, you can stop your-
self from acting on the impulses, reach out.
Call a suicide hotline (a telephone operator
can help you or you can call 1-800-SUICIDE /
1-800-784-2433); or call a friend or family
member you trust. Don’t be by yourself!
3. Make arrangements for professional follow-
up as soon as possible.
A hotline representative can direct you. You can
also use any of the referral directories I recom-
mend for eating disorder treatment in Chapter
10. Let the person know your situation is urgent.
4. Keep the appointment, even if you’re feeling
better.

Questionnaire: Might you have OCD?
Consider your responses to the following questions to see if you may have
OCD. Place a check mark in the box next to each question that you answer
with a “yes.” OCD and other disorders can be confused with one another, 
so it’s important that even if you answer “yes” to half or more of these 
questions, you get a good professional diagnosis.
❑Do you have thoughts, images, or impulses you can’t get rid of that
upset, frighten, or repel you?
❑If you have such impulses, do you worry that you won’t be able to stop
yourself from acting on them?
❑Do you have certain behaviors or thoughts that you feel you must enact
to be okay or to ward off some dreaded outcome?
❑Do these thoughts or activities take up an hour or more of your time
each day?
❑Do these thoughts or activities interfere with your relationships or other
things you need to be doing?
❑Does a part of you see your thoughts or activities as excessive, even if
you can’t stop?
OCD rarely disappears on its own, and its symptoms may last for years if 
they aren’t treated properly. OCD usually is treated with a combination of
psychotherapy and medications.
Worrying too much: Anxiety disorders
If you have an eating disorder, your chances of having some kind of anxiety
disorder as well are very good. Certain kinds of anxiety disorders, which I 
go over in this section, are typical of people with eating disorders. Anxiety
disorders are not your everyday worries. The fears involved are exaggerated,
irrational, and out-of-hand. Having an anxiety disorder makes your eating 
disorder symptoms that much worse. Here are three anxiety disorders that
are common to those with eating disorders:
 Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): If you have GAD, that which sets
you apart from people without the disorder is not so much the things
you worry about, but rather how much and how often you worry: a lot
and all the time. You worry so much that it makes you exhausted and
perhaps physically ill. And your worrying distracts you from other, more
constructive things you might be thinking about and doing.
 Panic disorder: The beginning event of panic disorder is a panic attack.
When you have a panic attack, you’ve crossed the line from manageable
anxiety to what feels like unmanageable anxiety. Among other effects,
your heart races wildly, things feel unreal, and you can no longer think
92
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

straight. People having panic attacks commonly fear that they are
having a heart attack or going crazy. You’ve developed panic disorder
when you’ve not only had one or more panic attacks but also have one
or more of the following symptoms:
• You (understandably) worry constantly about having another one.
• You worry about what could be wrong with you to have caused the
attack in the first place.
• You avoid anything you think might set off another attack.
 Social phobia: If you have a phobia, your fear is focused on a specific
object (like a snake) or situation (like driving). If you have a social phobia,
situations in which you expect to be observed and judged negatively ter-
rify you. Public speaking is a common social phobia. Social situations —
meeting other people, using public facilities, being in groups — produce
this fear in many people (thus, the name of the disorder). Those who are
experiencing bulimia seem especially prone to social phobia.
Soothing anxiety with food
Your emotions, mind, and body all get into the act when you are anxious. Your
emotions may range from low-grade worry to fear to outright panic. Your
thoughts are consumed with dreaded possibilities. Meanwhile, your nervous
system is treating you to jolts of adrenaline — the threat hormone that makes
your heart beat faster, your palms sweat, and your stomach fill with butter-
flies. Most people are motivated to do something — anything — to make all
those uncomfortable feelings go away.
For lack of a more constructive alternative, those with eating disorders use
what they have: food. Many people find certain foods, like carbohydrates and
sweets, inherently soothing. Maybe your family taught you to use food as an
emotional soother, or maybe you discovered it on your own. One way or
another, the first time food had a comforting effect on your feelings, it made
you likely to return to it the next time you needed comfort . . .and the next
and the next.
Questionnaire: Has your anxiety gone beyond everyday worrying?
If you are experiencing any of the first four symptoms that follow (psychologi-
cal signs of anxiety) and one or more of the remaining four symptoms (physi-
cal signs that may indicate anxiety), it may be evidence of one of the anxiety
disorders:
❑Uncontrolled worrying
❑Constant agitation
❑Unmanageable fear
❑Avoidance of feared situations
93
Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders

❑Physical sensations accompanying irrational fears
• Shortness of breath, rapid breathing
• Dizziness
• Pounding heart
• Nausea
❑Fatigue
❑Difficulty sleeping
❑Unexplained body aches
Getting a good diagnosis for symptoms that feel like an anxiety disorder is
really smart for several reasons, including the following:
 Your symptoms might actually be explained by something else, like a
medication side effect or a physical illness.
 If you have an anxiety disorder, it needs to be treated properly to help
you recover from your eating disorder.
 People get better when they get treatment. You don’t have to feel 
like this!
Check first with your doctor to rule out medical causes. If you determine that
there are no physical reasons for your symptoms, the next step is to seek an
evaluation for psychological causes. Eating disorder therapists you find
through the Resource Guide at the back of this book should be able to offer
you a competent evaluation for anxiety symptoms. For more hands-on help,
check out Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies by Charles H. Elliott and Laura L.
Smith (Wiley) and Anxiety & Depression Workbook For Dummies by the same
authors (Wiley).
Dealing with depression: Both 
cause and consequence
If you have an eating disorder, chances are you’ve met depression both
coming and going. More of you have some form of depression to start with
than do people without eating disorders. This is especially true if you are
bulimic. Depression probably made you more likely to develop an eating 
disorder in the first place.
Having an eating disorder is also depressing! Because the mind and body are
not separate — what affects one affects the other — it can be hard to tell
whether depression is the result of the physical effects of food restricting or
the emotional consequence of so much effort with so much failure and so
many bad feelings about yourself.
94
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

You don’t get a diagnosis of depression for a fleeting blue mood, an experience
that is normal at one time or another for all of us. Nor is depression the same
as grieving a loss. If you have depression, you feel hopelessly despairing about
who you are and your prospects for the future. Depression disrupts your sleep
and your ability to concentrate. It robs life of all color and meaning.
Major depression is a term reserved for the staying-in-bed-with-the-covers-
over-your-head kind of depression. Major depression interferes with so much
of your functioning that it tends to really stop you in your tracks.
If your symptoms don’t quite seem to measure up to the standards of major
depression but you feel that what you’re experiencing is more than just a 
typical blue mood, you may have a less severe form of depression known as
dysthymia.
Dysthymia (chronic depression) refers to the walking wounded among the
depressed. If you are dysthymic, you have most of the same symptoms as
people with major depression but not in ways that paralyze you. Living with
dysthymia is more like going through your daily paces with lead weights; you
can get things done, it just takes much more time and effort.
With dysthymia, you are incredibly vulnerable to failures, slights, or other
assaults on your self-image. These can trigger deeper feelings of depression.
But you are probably more responsive than the person with major depression
to injections of positive experience that support your self-image and improve
your mood, at least temporarily. Dysthymia is also known as chronic depression
because it lasts a long time, often years. Untreated, dysthymia can develop into
major depression.
Soothing and distracting yourself with food
Just as food works to self-medicate for anxiety, that is, to comfort and 
tamp down the experience of dread and agitation, it can work just as well to
medicate and take your mind off the emotional discomforts of depression.
Everyone would stand up and cheer for such a result if it weren’t so tempo-
rary and didn’t have so many bad effects. (I talk more about how using food
to manage emotions makes you vulnerable to an eating disorder in Chapter 5.
I provide ideas about managing emotions without food in Chapter 8 and tell
you about therapies that are especially helpful for emotion management in
Chapter 10.)
Feeling bad when everything depends on weight
Your eating disorder is practically a recipe for depression. Since you are
aiming at a cultural ideal of slimness very few bodies are actually equipped to
achieve, you’re more than likely to be disappointed. Either you can’t achieve
your goal at all, or you get there but can’t stay there. You start from the 
position that achieving your weight goal is the only way for you to be okay,
for you to like yourself. Body weight, which is not nearly as much under your
conscious control as you might like to believe, is a highly undependable hook
95
Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders

on which to hang self-worth. Low self-worth is a central feature of depression.
Constantly doubting your worth because of your weight can help tip you into
an episode of depression.
Seeing no light at the end of the tunnel
Despair is another central feature of depression — and of eating disorders,
particularly bulimia and binge eating disorder. Each of these disorders
involves being caught in a form of the following endless cycle: eating in an
uncontrolled way; then taking steps to control eating that only increase the
chances of eating in an uncontrolled way again. (You can read about this
cycle in detail in Chapter 4.) Being unable to exit the cycle creates feelings of
helplessness and hopelessness — ingredients that, in time, tend to lead to
depression.
Questionnaire: Is what you’re feeling depression?
The following statements are typical of what a person with major depression
experiences. Place a check mark in the box next to those statements that you
agree with. Checking any of the boxes is cause for concern and a reason to
seek help. (You may be suffering from dysthymia, a less severe form of
depression.) Checking off a handful or more could indicate major depression.
❑I feel worthless about myself most of the time.
❑I’ve lost interest in everything, even things that used to give me plea-
sure.
❑I find it’s really hard to focus or make decisions.
❑I’m unusually irritable.
❑I’m constantly tired; everything I need to do seems like too much.
❑I sleep a lot more than usual.
❑My sleep is very disrupted.
❑I feel a lot of aches and pains that are not caused by physical illness.
❑I have frequent thoughts of suicide.
Probably half of you with anorexia have experienced major depression. At
least that many of you with bulimia have experienced the disorder, probably a
good many more. Depression is also extremely common among people with
binge eating disorder. Major depression is dangerous because it can lead to
suicide if untreated. Take a look at the previous section, “Considering suicide,”
and the sidebar, “Steps to take if you’re feeling suicidal,” if you are feeling in
any way suicidal.
Apart from suicide risk, major depression takes a major bite out of your life. It
makes your eating disorder worse and harder to treat. But depression is treat-
able, and treating it can be a critical part of your recovery. Seek out the help of
a reputable therapist, and be sure to check out Depression For Dummies, by

yourself started in the right direction.
Bouncing up and down: Bipolar disorder
Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic-depressive illness, is a mood disor-
der that involves a lot more than being moody. Depending on severity, bipo-
lar disorder can take you through anything from mild to wild cycling between
high and low energy states. The “high” or manic states often involve inflated
feelings about yourself and your abilities. They feel like a great ride, at least
in the early stages, and seem to bother everybody else more than they do
you. The “low” phases, on the other hand, are not fun at any stage. They are
pretty well described by the depressive states I reviewed in the preceding
section, “Depression: Both cause and consequence.”
Studies find that bipolar disorder is much more common among people with
anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating disorder than it is among people without
eating disorders. Having bipolar disorder will make your eating disorder
symptoms worse. They will also make it harder for you to get better.
Likewise, your eating disorder symptoms can complicate the treatment of
your bipolar illness. The message here is that both need to be treated.
Three great reasons for early evaluation and treatment
Of course you want the best evaluation you can get for any disorder you may
have. But there are some particularly compelling reasons to get a sound 
evaluation for possible bipolar disorder, and to get it early:
 It appears that having manic episodes may trigger more and worse
manic episodes in the future. Treatment to stop this snowballing
process is a good idea.
 Many people whose bipolar disorders go undiagnosed are given 
antidepressants for their depressed phases. Antidepressants tend to
trigger manic episodes. Not the effect you’re looking for.
 Suicide is a very big risk in untreated bipolar disorder.
Questionnaire: Could your “up” moods be manic episodes?
Place a check mark in the box next to those items in the list that you feel
reflect the way you feel. Checking even one of these boxes is at least a flag for
bipolar disorder. The more you check, the greater the possibility that you
may be experiencing manic episodes.
❑I have more energy than I know what to do with.
❑I hardly seem to need any sleep.
97
Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders

❑I never felt so good, like I could do or be anything.
❑I have so many ideas, I don’t know which one to pursue next.
❑My creative powers are amazing.
❑Other people don’t seem to share my excitement about myself or 
my plans.
❑I can barely hold my thoughts still, one follows another so rapidly.
❑I find it hard to concentrate.
❑Sometimes I talk so fast, other people find it hard to follow my thoughts.
❑I’m quite irritable.
❑I’ve been spending a lot more money than usual, maybe money I 
don’t have.
Note: If you feel that some of the statements would be true of you if they were
a little less extreme, you may be experiencing a less severe form of the manic
state known as hypomania. For example, while the person in a manic state
may feel they can barely hold their thoughts still, you may feel a pleasurable
sense of increased flow in your thoughts. Others may be impressed with this
flow of thoughts, but probably won’t find them hard to follow, as they would
the thoughts of someone in a manic state. Though not as disruptive, hypoma-
nia still requires treatment. The nature of all forms of bipolar disorder is to
grow worse over time if not treated.
The questionnaire for depression in the previous section also provides 
good indicators for the presence of the depressive states you find in bipolar
disorder. If you haven’t already taken this questionnaire, now may be a good
time to do so if you think you may have bipolar disorder.
To get more information about bipolar disorder and its treatment, check out
Bipolar Disorder For Dummies by Candida Fink and Joe Kraynak (Wiley). If
you believe you may have bipolar disorder, ask your doctor to refer you to a
therapist who can evaluate and treat your symptoms. You can find a local
support group at the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (www.dbs
alliance.org) or at the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI
www.nami.org). If you have a child or teen with bipolar disorder, you can
find online or local in-person support groups for parents at the Child and
Adolescent Bipolar Foundation (www.bpkids.org).
Even though bipolar disorder usually develops in the late teen years or early
adulthood, it can show up in childhood and in the early teens as well. If
you’re a parent who thinks that your child may have bipolar disorder, it may
be helpful to know that in children, “manic” symptoms often appear less 
as extreme happiness or excitement, and more in the form of irritability or
tantrums. Several other disorders can look the same way, so you need a pro-
fessional evaluation. Early treatment is so important with bipolar disorder
that you want to have your child checked for any signs that concern you. You

can find out more about recognizing possible bipolar illness in your child or
young teen and getting help from the Web site of the Child and Adolescent
Bipolar Foundation at www.cabf.org.
Adding Addictions to 
Your Eating Disorder
People who haven’t had the chance to discover how to manage emotions
constructively may engage in many other destructive behaviors besides their
eating disorders to cope. Among the other destructive behaviors people use
to cope with their emotions are addictions. While the intent is to feel better,
the result is double trouble — more problems to solve when you’re trying to
recover from your eating disorder. Substance and alcohol abuse and exercise
addiction are particularly common among people with eating disorders.
Abusing drugs and alcohol
If you have an eating disorder, you’re up to five times more likely to abuse
alcohol or illegal drugs than people without eating disorders. These were the
findings of a three-year study on the relationship between eating disorders
and substance abuse conducted by The National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia University.
The connection starts early and involves not only young people with eating
disorders but also those merely demonstrating risky eating symptoms, such
as dieting, bingeing, or purging. For example, the CASA study found that if
you’re a young woman, the more severe your dieting behavior is, the more
likely you are to drink heavily and to use illegal drugs. If you’re a high school
student with eating disorder symptoms, on average you’re twice as likely to
drink, including binge drinking, and to use marijuana, cocaine, and other ille-
gal drugs.
Realizing it’s most common when bingeing
Although alcohol and substance abuse can be found across the eating disor-
der spectrum, it shows up most among those who binge — whether in the
context of bulimia, binge eating disorder, or binge/purge anorexia. Rarely is it
associated with the restrictive type of anorexia.
By far the highest rates of alcohol and drug use occur among bulimic 
women. Bulimic women are known to abuse a wide variety of drugs, including
amphetamines, prescription stimulants, barbiturates, cocaine, heroine, 
marijuana, and tranquilizers.
99
Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders

A study of mortality rates among people with eating disorders presented in
the International Journal of Eating Disorders (July, 2000) showed that people
with the bingeing/purging type of anorexia were 12 times more likely to die
than their non–eating disordered peers and that alcohol abuse was one of the
strongest predictors of death in this group. The researchers believed that
alcoholism combined with malnutrition due to anorexia work together to
increase chances of fatal cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, alcohol poisoning,
and cirrhosis (liver disease). What’s more, even weight-restored people with
anorexia who were alcoholic showed elevated death rates, apparently due to
alcohol’s capacity to lower the threshold for suicidal impulses. Even though
people with anorexia are less likely to drink alcoholically than people with
other eating disorders, when they do, it’s more likely to be fatal.
Thinking it will control mood and appetite issues
Depression, as I discuss in the earlier section “Depression: Both cause and
consequence,” is extremely common among people with eating disorders.
People with bulimia are particularly hard-hit. Anxiety is another frequent
problem. A widely-accepted explanation for the high rate of co-occurring
eating disorders and substance and alcohol abuse is that both represent an
attempt to deal with emotions that are swamping the sufferer. The picture
you get is of somebody flailing — trying one symptom for relief and then
another — just to feel better.
If you binge and then purge to get rid of calories, you’re more likely to take
amphetamines, cocaine, or heroin to suppress your appetite and increase
your metabolism to lose weight. The problem is that your body simply isn’t
equipped to keep up with the physical wear-and-tear of these activities.
Questionnaire: Do you have a problem with drugs or alcohol?
In the following list, place a check mark in the boxes next to those statements
that you answer with a “yes.” Positive responses to the following questions
may signal that your drug or alcohol use has become a problem, or even an
addiction. The more boxes you check, the more serious the problem.
❑Is your job or school performance suffering because of your use of drugs
or alcohol?
❑Have your relationships with others suffered due to your use of drugs or
alcohol?
❑Have you ever lied to a doctor to obtain prescription drugs?
❑Have you ever stolen drugs or alcohol or risked your safety to obtain
them?
❑Have you ever used drugs or alcohol to manage emotional pain or
stress?
❑Does the thought of dealing with certain situations without drugs or
alcohol, or running out period, terrify you?
100
Part I: Eating Disorders: An All-Consuming World of Their Own 

❑Have you ever overdosed?
❑Do you continue to use drugs or alcohol despite negative consequences?
To find resources for drug and alcohol treatment, check out Drugnet at
www.drugnet.net and DrugHelp at www.drughelp.org. Be sure to take a
look at Addiction & Recovery For Dummies by Brian F. Shaw, Paul Ritvo, Jane
Irvine, and M. David Lewis (Wiley) for some great ideas on how to get help
with your drug or alcohol problem. In Part II of this book I talk about sorting
out the order for treatment when you have alcohol or substance abuse prob-
lems along with your eating disorder.
Exercising excessively
Exercise addiction . . . compulsive exercise . . . exercise disorder . . . overexer-
cising syndrome . . . obligatory exercise . . . exercise bulimia . . . all these are
names for a pattern of exercise in which you no longer feel like you have a
choice in the matter. Exercising excessively is so common among people with
eating disorders that some people think it ought to be included in the defini-
tion of the disorders.
Thinking it’s necessary
If you have an eating disorder, a master motivator for all your huffing and
puffing is weight control (and, more recently, body sculpting, that is, shaping
and toning your muscles through exercise). Anything that reduces your
terror of fat can become essential for daily living. This includes use of exer-
cise as a compensatory behavior, that is, behavior to even up the bookkeeping
when you think you’ve taken in too many calories (or any calories).
Another big reason why many of you exercise excessively is the same reason
you’re doing a lot of things excessively (for example, watching your weight,
bingeing or purging, trying to be perfect at school or in your job, and so
forth): to try to manage emotions or to distract yourself from difficult experi-
ences. Also, like successful dieting, exercise may increase your feelings of
being in control and being effective.
Anything you do that serves the purpose of helping you manage your 
emotions or improve your self-image is likely to take on some serious staying
power or even to become an addiction. This is because it starts feeling 
necessary to your survival.
If you’re an addictive exerciser, chances are you feel guilty, out-of-sorts,
and/or anxious when you can’t exercise. You’re not exercising for the fun of it
or for the health benefits.
101
Chapter 7: Sidekicks That Often Accompany Eating Disorders

Ignoring the consequences
One of the signs that you may be exercising addictively is the price you are
willing to pay for your workout. You may be willing to endure
 Exhaustion: Exercising beyond your physical limits; missing sleep to get
your workout
 Skeletal injury or damage: Stress fractures, shin splints, bone fractures,
degenerative arthritis, osteoporosis
 Internal problems: Dehydration, heart problems, loss of menstrual 
periods, infertility
 Not showing up: Cutting class, not going to work, or missing social
events so you can exercise
 Damaging relationships: Not being there for friends, family, or your
partner because you’re putting your workout first
According to Anorexia Nervosa and Related Eating Disorders (ANRED), Inc.
(www.anred.com), exercise that consumes more than 3,500 calories per
week leads to decreased physical benefits and increased risk of injury.
Questionnaire: Are you exercising addictively?
Place a check mark in the boxes next to those statements that apply to you.
Agreement with one or more of the following statements could indicate an
exercise addiction.
❑I’ll make time to exercise no matter what the cost to myself, including
exhaustion or injury.
❑My feelings about myself are affected by how much I work out on a 
particular day.
❑I’ve neglected my responsibilities (such as job or school) in order to
exercise.
❑Working out has taken the place of much of my social life.
❑I’m likely to feel guilty, anxious, or angry if I can’t exercise.
❑It’s nearly impossible for me to take a day off from exercise, even if I’m
injured or sick.

Recovery and
Treatment Options

In this part . . .
I
start you off with a rundown of what getting better
looks like. Specifically, I detail the physical, behavioral,
and emotional landmarks that signal recovery. For each of
these landmarks I provide you with a chart so you can
track where you are in your own recovery and what you
want to work on next.
The meat of Part II is a detailed description of the choices
you need to make when you decide to get treatment for
your eating disorder. I go over in-patient and out-patient
options, individual versus group or family therapies, and
various kinds of alternative treatments. I provide guide-
lines for choosing one kind of treatment over another. I
describe different forms of individual therapy in detail. I
also review medications used to treat eating disorders.
I round out Part II with a discussion of the ways you can
help your own treatment along, including management 
of early recovery and relapse. I help you recognize when
your approach to treatment may be interfering with your
progress and describe ways to turn such moments into
opportunities to move forward.

ecovery means getting over your eating disorder and being healthy.
Some define recovery as returning to a normal state, one in which you
no longer binge, purge, or starve. By these standards, the majority of people
who get treated for an eating disorder get better.
But for most sufferers of an eating disorder, becoming free of symptoms is
not enough. In order to emerge into recovery and stay there, you have to
come out of your eating disorder better, stronger, wiser, and more skilled at
coping with life than you were before. What are the markers of the long-term
health you are aiming for? What milestones and accomplishments of recov-
ery land you on a more solid shore in which relapse is less likely? This chap-
ter maps them out for you. It provides a glimpse into your future, the one
you’ll achieve with a reliable treatment team and your own steady efforts.
Finding Balance in Recovery
As you familiarize yourself with the markers of recovery in this chapter,
notice one big idea that weaves its way through most of them. The idea is
that finding and maintaining balance is the key to your recovery. Balance is
the middle ground that lies centered between the extreme ways you’ve been
experiencing life through your eating disorder. If you take away just one idea
from this chapter, the idea of finding that balance is the one I recommend.

106
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 
After several sections you find examples of worksheets that you can adapt to
chart your success during recovery. You fill these worksheets in by identify-
ing the progress you’ve made to date on the recovery marker just discussed
and what you need to do next to achieve a specific goal related to that marker.
When these worksheets are complete, they become useful recovery tools.
Recovering from your eating disorder may take longer than you want it to.
Most people measure the process in years, not weeks or months. On the
other hand, those of you who stick with your treatment plan to achieve the
strengths and skills I cover in this chapter will gain two invaluable benefits.
You’ll acquire a lot of insurance against eating disorder relapse, and you’ll
develop some great resiliency to take you through life’s unpredictabilities!
Maintaining a Healthy Weight
Maintaining a certain weight range is a sign of recovery mainly if you’ve had
anorexia. Being too thin is central to your disorder. Being underweight causes
a lot of your symptoms or makes them worse. Achieving a healthy weight is
essential to recovering physically and psychologically.
No weight standards apply to people recovering from bulimia or binge eating
disorder. For these two disorders, healthy recovery has more to do with
stabilizing your weight — a predictable outcome of ending the cycling between
binging and purging and dieting. You may find this new focus disappointing if
you still believe that to get better you must get thinner, but achieving a healthy,
stable weight is the real goal. Take a look at the next section, “Finding your
healthy weight,” to find out how to determine what a healthy weight is for you.
Finding your healthy weight
A healthy weight is one at which all of your body’s systems — organs, hormones,
brain, the works — are able to get the nutritional support they need to function
normally. When you achieve a healthy weight, your body can carry you through
the physical, mental, and emotional demands of your day and your life.
Did you know you are living with the world’s leading expert on exactly the
right body weight for you? That expert is your body itself! Your body lets you
know what weight range is right for you in two important ways: It sends dis-
tress signals when your weight falls too low, and it has a tendency to settle at
and maintain a setpoint, the weight at which your body functions at its best.
When your weight goes too low
Your body signals you with distressing symptoms when your weight falls too
low. Developing an awareness of these symptoms is important because they

alert you when your weight falls below a healthy level. You find out more
about these symptoms in Chapter 6, but in short, visible symptoms to be on
the lookout for include:
 Dry, brittle hair and nails, hair loss, dry skin
 Severe cold sensitivity; cold hands and feet
 Easy bruising
While most of these symptoms occur only with significant weight loss, some
earlier warning signals, perhaps specific to you, can also alert you to a potential
problem. Consider the following:
 Do you feel a little less energetic when your weight falls below your
optimum range?
 Do you feel a bit less alert?
 Does your mood start to tumble?
Changes in your mood and energy level may be signs that you need to either
increase your food intake or reduce your energy output until your weight
returns to a level that supports good health.
When your weight is just right for you
Your body tells you about its best weight range through the mechanism of
setpoint. Your setpoint is the weight your body keeps returning to when
you’re eating in a healthy way and not doing anything in particular to control
your weight (that is, you’re not dieting, purging, or exercising compulsively).
According to setpoint theory, this is your body’s natural weight, the one that
makes it happiest. When you try to drive your weight below your setpoint by
dieting, your body eventually rebels and you see all your dieting efforts
undone. Gaining weight to reach your setpoint may be upsetting, especially if
your setpoint appears to be above your desired weight or cultural ideals of
slimness. The payoff for accepting an outcome higher than your ideal is
ending a state of warfare with your body. This kind of acceptance may take
lots of work to achieve, but the outcome is well worth it.
Skirting the pitfalls of keeping track
When you’ve had an eating disorder, you need to move away from an obsessive
focus on weight as part of your recovery. You should no longer concern your-
self with the number on the scales. However, if you’ve been severely anorexic,
the medical consequences of weight loss are too risky to be treated casually. In
this case, someone needs to keep track of your weight during your recovery
period; that someone just shouldn’t be you. Most likely your nutritionist or
doctor will be the one to track your weight. You’ll probably be asked to agree
107
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

to be weighed in his or her office and to be informed only of whether you’re
staying in your goal range (as opposed to knowing your exact weight).
For those of you recovering from milder cases of anorexia, or from bulimia or
binge eating disorder, the goal is getting the greatest weight stability with the
least focus. Letting your body find its setpoint is the easiest way to put your
system on cruise control so you can pay less attention. (See the preceding
section, “When your weight is just right for you.”) Instead of focusing on 
calories and pounds, the idea is to focus on your health. When you eat and
exercise in a healthy way (see the sections “Eating Healthfully with No
Forbidden Foods” and “Exercising in a Healthy Way” later in this chapter),
your body tells you how much you need to eat to maintain a weight that’s
right for you. Hearing it has just been extremely hard to do through all the
cultural and eating disorder chatter.
Menstruating Normally
For a long time, disruption of menstrual cycles was thought to be a symptom
only women with anorexia needed to worry about. Furthermore, the return of
normal cycles was considered proof-positive that the weight of the woman
with anorexia had returned to a safe range. More recently, exceptions to
these rules seem to turn up all over the place. For instance:
 About half of women with bulimia have disrupted cycles for reasons not
yet clear to researchers.
 Some women with anorexia who are still in weight jeopardy get their
periods back anyway.
 Some women with anorexia fail to regain their periods at weights where
they should have.
Despite the existence of these exceptions to the rule, if you are recovering
from anorexia, normal menstruation without the help of birth control pills is
still going to be one of the most important signs your physician looks for to
make sure your physical recovery is on track.
Getting to normal periods
Being able to produce a menstrual period is about having enough body weight
and enough body fat. Your body has to have a minimum of both to make estro-
gen and related reproductive hormones. No estrogen, no menstrual cycle.
108
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

As researchers take a closer look, other body systems and hormones seem to
be important to menstrual balance as well — which ones are just not yet clear!
Possibly a part of the brain called the hypothalamus is involved. The hypothal-
amus regulates metabolism and many other basic body systems. The series of
hormonal events that tells your ovaries to produce estrogen is also linked to
the hypothalamus. The stress hormone cortisol may also play a role.
Your body’s systems need a healthy balance in your weight, nutrition, exercise,
and emotional life in order to work properly. When you supply your body’s
systems with these basic needs, in most instances your body responds by
supplying you with regular menstrual cycles.
Losing your periods
Fertility is a concern for many women in recovery from anorexia. The chain
of hormonal events that controls your menstrual cycle results in ovulation —
the release of an egg that might get fertilized and thus result in a pregnancy. If
you’re not menstruating, you can’t get pregnant. Fertility problems can hang
around for years after your disorder, depending on how long you had it.
Fertility problems are mainly treatable.
Having your periods tells you that your estrogen production is back on line.
Being able to become pregnant isn’t the only positive outcome. Estrogen is a
multitasking hormone, doing good in many parts of your body. Here are three
of estrogen’s most valuable effects:
 Keeping your bones strong. (You may have to work with your treatment
team to undo bone loss that occurred during the worst of your disorder.)
 Protecting your heart and blood vessels.
 Improving your cholesterol levels.
Seeing Bingeing or Purging 
Symptoms Subside
If you’re recovering from the binge/purge type of anorexia or from bulimia, a
sound recovery means a significant reduction in bingeing and purging symp-
toms. If you suffer from binge eating disorder, recovery equates to a reduction
in bingeing.
109
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

Recovery is not an all-or-nothing affair in which you either stop your symptoms
100 percent or you fail and remain disordered. In recovery, you’re invited to
explore the middle ground. A good recovery in terms of bingeing and purging
symptoms means
 You get a handle on what triggers your symptoms. For example, you
may figure out that the single biggest reason for your bingeing is trying
to calm down when you become swamped with emotions. Anger and
fear of abandonment are two triggers that get to you every time.
 You develop constructive alternatives for handling your emotions. For
instance, maybe you find ways to speak up more directly and effectively
when you’re angry. Maybe you trace your abandonment fears to early
losses in your childhood and turn your focus in therapy to comforting
and reassuring yourself in ways that don’t involve food.
 You use constructive alternatives more often than you use your 
symptoms to manage your emotions. Improvement is mostly a matter of
practice, practice, practice — like getting to Carnegie Hall. And, yes,
many people do, in time, leave their symptoms behind altogether.
Dieting is a key trigger for bingeing and many other aspects of your eating
disorder. Talking about a sound recovery in which you are still dieting is not
realistic.
Recovery isn’t all or nothing
You may be wondering if success means that your bingeing and purging
symptoms have to be done and gone forever. No! Your symptoms aren’t likely
to be gone for good for a very long time. Eating disorder recovery usually
takes place over a number of years, not weeks or months. You’re more likely
to see a gradual shift that reflects not only your practice in using symptom
alternatives, but also your growth in other related areas: increased self-
esteem, improvement in mood, development of skills that allow you to feel
more competent, and so forth.
A slip isn’t a failure
Slip-ups happen. Visiting an old neighborhood doesn’t mean you’re going to live
there again! Here is yet another great opportunity to explore the possibilities of
living in middle ground. In middle ground, mistakes don’t ruin things. First,
you don’t have to be mistake-free to be worthwhile or to be just fine. Second,
mistakes aren’t shameful black marks on your record. They’re part of the
human condition. What’s more, they present opportunities to learn and make
course corrections. To find out more about growing from your slip-ups, be
sure to read the section on handling relapse in Chapter 14.
110

To measure your progress regarding slip-ups, you can use a worksheet like
the example shown in Table 8-1.

experimenting with journaling my feelings.
Getting Thinking Processes Normal
Disordered thinking is an important part of the engine that keeps an eating
disorder going. Here’s a sampler of some typical disordered thoughts:
 I’ll feel better when I’m thinner.
 Everything will be better when I’m thin.
 Things are all one way or another (so-called black-and-white thinking).
 I have to be perfect to be okay.
When you have anorexia, your thinking distortions include not only all the
above, but also denial of your thin body state and the consequences of starving
yourself.
Your thinking processes return to normal when you land solidly on ground
where thin doesn’t rule. A lot more important things determine what make
you and other people worthwhile or likable. And life’s problems aren’t solved
by being thin.
Middle ground is no longer just a theory; it’s a place where you’ve established
some real estate. You know how to find your way back there when you find
you’ve slipped into the old extremes. For example, you know how to translate
a negative thought like “I ate too much — I blew it” into more productive
thinking like: “Wait a minute. I ate more than I meant to tonight. But that’s part
of a normal eating pattern. I just need to take a minute to think about whether
it means I was stressed about something and didn’t realize it.”
111
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

De-stinking your thinking
If you’ve had anorexia, restoring your weight will go far toward improving the
rigidities in your thinking. That’s because many of your distorted thoughts
are an actual effect of starvation on your brain. (You can read more about the
effects of starvation in Chapter 7.)
Apart from clearing up anorexia’s starvation effects, most of the rest of the
improvement for all eating disordered people comes from participating in a
therapeutic process that invites you to challenge your distortions — what
the 12-step people call “stinkin’ thinkin’.” This process can take place in indi-
vidual therapy, group therapy, a therapeutic community, Overeaters Anonymous
(OA), or what have you — just so long as you have the chance to examine
these disordered thinking processes and to replace them with healthier ones.
Enjoying better thinking
Your thinking processes have arrived in healthy territory when your basic
self-esteem and sense of security are no longer threatened by the fact or the
possibility of
 Weight gain
 Overeating
 Making a mistake or failing
 Disappointing someone
 Making someone angry
To measure your progress regarding improved thinking, you can use a work-
sheet like the example shown in Table 8-2.

food, everything!
112
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Eating Well with No Forbidden Foods
I hesitate to use the word diet because it has had such toxic meanings for you.
By diet I mean your way of eating. I am certainly not referring to restricting
your food or calories in any form. As you recover from your eating disorder,
you develop a way of eating that includes rather than excludes foods — an
eating pattern that’s about health and enjoyment, not pounds and performance.
Establishing a healthy eating pattern is as difficult as anything you accomplish
in recovery. It means creating a whole new relationship with food and eating —
one in which you aren’t at war with each other! Imagine thinking of food as
being on your side, supporting you in what you’re trying to accomplish each
day. Imagine that, at times, food can be there for pure pleasure, adding to the
fun or ritual of a social event, or just enhancing a pleasant night at home.
When food and hunger have taken their places as natural rhythms in your life,
not enemies to be defeated, all these things can happen. (You find ideas on
how to start developing a better relationship with food in Chapter 14.)
Understanding healthy eating
A healthy and varied way of eating means you get the nutritional value from
your food that your body needs in order to function and thrive. It actually
takes a wide variety of foods to supply all your nutritional needs: grains
(including whole grains), proteins, vegetables, fruits. You don’t have to achieve
a perfect balance of the food groups with all vitamins and minerals represented
every day. Nutritionists say that balance is something you figure out more on a
weekly basis than a daily one.
Here’s a really neat thing to look forward to in recovery. Once your practice is
to partner with your body’s nutritional needs rather than be at war with
them, your body begins to let you know when you’re running low on some-
thing by sending you urges for it. Sometimes the urges are for the fun stuff;
sometimes they’re for the stuff that makes your engines run. I know what
you’re thinking: “Urges for broccoli? No way! And what’s that about urges for
the fun stuff?” Read on . . . .
Including forbidden foods
You’re probably thinking, “She can’t mean onion rings. Or banana splits or
corn dogs.” Yes, actually, I do. This may come as a real shocker. As soon as
you start making any food the enemy, you make it more desirable, and you’re
back in that contest of wills that’s part of your eating disorder. In recovery,
the idea of middle ground is there once again to guide you. Where do foods
belong in your way of eating when they have no nutritionally redeeming value
113
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

but they just taste so darn good? Probably not daily on a lettuce leaf for
lunch, any more than you’d make weekly trips to Istanbul to see that guy you
flirted with in the Grand Bazaar. But including these adventures once in
awhile sure adds some important spice to life!
To measure your progress regarding healthy eating, you can use a worksheet
like the example shown in Table 8-3.

Exercising in a Healthy Way
Repeat after me: Exercise is not for the purpose of burning off dinner or punish-
ment for that candy bar I just ate. Then what’s left? I’m glad you asked! The 
following list includes some of the really great benefits you get when you
exercise in a healthy way:
 Physical benefits (just some of them!):
• Strengthens your bones (provided you weigh enough)
• Improves your heart health
• Strengthens your immune function
• Protects you against diabetes and other metabolic disorders
• Improves your sleeping
• Increases your stamina
 Psychological benefits:
• Reduces stress
• Relieves anxiety
• Improves your mood
 Pleasure in movement: You have an opportunity to discover all the
ways your body can move through space and how it most likes to do so
(see the section “Exploring physical activity for pleasure”).
114
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Exercising too much or too hard robs you of these benefits. Current govern-
ment guidelines suggest about 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of
the week (that’s most, not every) in order to maintain good health.
Determining what healthy exercise is
Exercising in a healthy way means, above all, remaining tuned in to your body.
Being tuned in means staying alert for signals about how your body’s doing
with what you are asking of it. Assuming you’re not an athlete in training (if
you are, you may want to read Chapter 16, “Athletes and Eating Disorders”),
during healthy exercise ask yourself the following questions:
 What’s happening with your breathing and your heart rate? You shouldn’t
be wheezing nor should your heart be pounding out of your chest.
 How do your muscles feel? Hint: “Going for the burn” is a great way to
get injured.
 Are there any other sources of pain? Remember, pain has a purpose: It
signals you when something is wrong that needs fixing.
 Has your workout left you feeling invigorated or wrung out like a
dishrag? Healthy exercise is supposed to give you energy, not take it
away!
The point of all this tuning in, besides just knowing yourself, is to enable you
to make necessary course corrections based on the information you get. If
you meant to jog for 30 minutes but your body’s screaming for the showers at
20, you can stop. Since you’re exercising for health and enjoyment, not for
size reduction, you’re free to make a choice like this that puts your well-being
before calories burned.
Being tuned in helps you make healthy day-to-day choices. It also guides you
in the longer term. Do you find that six days a week of aerobic workouts regu-
larly leaves you fatigued but four days feels about right? Are you sick or injured?
Do you need to knock off your routine for a few days or even a few weeks so
exercise won’t make you worse? Were you sure you had to be a jogger to be
okay, but find your joints telling you that they really prefer swimming? By being
responsive, you form a partnership with your body, much as you do with food.
This partnership ensures that you are fit and that your body is able to carry you
through the activities you need and want it to in life.
Exploring physical activity for pleasure
Exercise shouldn’t be drudgery. And it certainly shouldn’t be your penance
for eating too much. Dropping the focus on calorie burning while getting
tuned in to your body opens up a whole new possibility: choosing exercise or
115
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

physical activity because it feels good! The idea is to find an activity that
appeals to your tastes and preferences, one that you really enjoy doing.
In recovery you have the freedom to experiment and discover what kinds of
movement you like best. Do you like freestyle dancing? Aerobic dance? Yoga?
Swimming? Soccer? Walking? Does your body prefer to exercise first thing in
the morning or not until you’ve been moving around all day? Do you have the
best time when you exercise in a class, on a team, or by yourself? Do you like
lots of variety? Does the need for special skills get your engines going or get
in your way? When you take the time to choose physical activity that gives
you pleasure, you discover that your body can do a lot better things for you
than get you skinny.
To measure your progress regarding exercising in a healthy way, you can use
a worksheet like the example shown in Table 8-4.

Creating Healthy Relationships
In recovery, you feel safe in knowing that you need other people. You don’t
have to rely on food as a poor substitute for human connection. You develop
a range of skills that help you to get along with others and to keep the rela-
tionships you prize and make them better.
Sound relationships in recovery reflect the two sides of living in a world of
other people: autonomy, separateness, and individuality on the one hand,
and attachment and connection on the other. In other words, the me and the
we. Healthy relating recognizes the fundamental importance of each and
doesn’t ask that, on the whole, either one be sacrificed for the other. This
doesn’t mean that one or the other doesn’t get put on the back burner from
time to time while the other is emphasized. That’s just life. But overall, for
any of us to thrive, the me and the we parts of our lives need to be equally
well developed and expressed.
116
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Setting appropriate boundaries
Boundaries reflect how an individual is treated in a particular relationship.
Healthy boundaries respect individual rights, abilities, and opinions. (This
doesn’t always mean getting your way, although, of course, in a just universe
it would.) Here’s where the rubber meets the road. Not everyone you relate
to is going to live up to these standards. That means your own boundaries
must be clear enough to allow you to ask the other person to change or to
allow you to set limits on the boundary violation.
Here are some examples of boundaries being crossed:
 Your roommate goes into your closet and borrows clothes without asking.
 Your father feels free to interrupt your every opinion and tell you what you
should be thinking.
 Your sister tells her friends about something that happened with your
boyfriend, even though you asked her to keep it a secret.
 Your boss calls you at home on Saturday about a matter that could have
easily waited until Monday.
 Aunt Agatha can’t resist fixing the way you decorated a cake or rearranging
where you’ve put your new rug.
 Mom writes your report for class. She knows you’ve got the basic ideas;
she just knows how to put them a little better.
 Your husband acts as if you are betraying him if you have friends or
activities you don’t want the two of you to share.
In order to set a limit and establish a clear personal boundary in any of these
situations, you need the following qualities, skills, and beliefs:
 You need a clear sense of self. You need to know that a separate you exists
in order to recognize boundary violations and to insist on your rights.
 You have to know you are entitled to respect for your individual
rights. This comes from understanding healthy boundaries.
 You have to feel or trust you are entitled to respect for your individual
rights. This comes from self-esteem.
 You need to be able to say no to what the other person wants or
expects when it isn’t right for you. This means trusting it won’t kill
them, it won’t kill you, and, if the relationship is healthy enough, it won’t
kill the relationship.
The ability to say no when you need to, along with other skills of boundary-
making, is so crucial to feeling you will be safe and won’t lose yourself in rela-
tionships that it has led to a therapy maxim: You have to be able to say no in
order to be able to say yes. Yes means agreeing to be in a relationship in the
117
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

first place and being okay with the times when it seems right to put your
needs second and compromise. In other words, before there can be a safe we,
there has to be a secure, solid me.
Here’s what healthy boundary-making might look like in a few of the preceding
situations:
 Your roommate goes into your closet and borrows clothes without asking.
First you need to decide what’s okay with you. Can she borrow if she
asks ahead of time? Can she borrow some things, but not others? Maybe
you don’t like lending your clothes at all. Whatever you decide is all
right. You might then say: “I noticed you borrowed my pink sweater last
night. I don’t mind. I just like to know ahead of time.” Or: “I noticed you
borrowed my sweater. I know some people are comfortable with sharing
clothes, but I prefer not to.”
 Your father feels free to interrupt your every opinion and tell you what
you should be thinking.
Using what couples therapists call an I-statement (in which you focus on
how someone’s behavior makes you feel instead of attacking the
person), you might say something like: “Dad, when you keep interrupting
me and telling me what I’m supposed to think, it makes it too hard to be
in the conversation with you. I just feel frustrated and unheard. It makes
me feel like what I think doesn’t matter. We have to change this pattern if
we’re going to talk to each other.”
 Your sister tells her friends about something that happened with your
boyfriend, even though you asked her to keep it a secret.
Using an I-statement again, you might tell your sister you feel really let
down by her failure to honor your secrets. “It means I don’t feel safe now
confiding in you, which is a big loss to me. That makes me feel hurt and
sad and angry.”
Allowing appropriate intimacy
Intimacy is a quality of closeness and connection that describes family rela-
tionships, friendships, or romantic partnerships. In recovery, healthy intimacy
includes
 Knowing and being known. Feeling safe in letting people know the
inner you — your thoughts, hopes, fears, failings, secret ambitions — is
the opposite of shame. Feeling safe requires you to trust that others will
see your worth in spite of any negative qualities. The flip side is trusting
that you can do the same for others, that an ability to see the whole
package, including plusses and minuses, is replacing your old black-and-
white thinking. When you develop a sense of trust, you feel safe enough
118
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

to really get to know another person. Whatever you discover that’s
disappointing isn’t likely to spoil what you value in them.
 Relating in an interdependent way. Interdependence is a word profes-
sionals use usually to describe an ongoing partnership. It means that each
partner knows they can rely on the other for the commitment, emotional
connection, and task-sharing that make the relationship work. If your
history involves traumatic boundary violation, neglect, or abandonment,
an interdependent relationship will reflect a lot of healing.
 Resting your weight fully on the other person as a safe “sometimes”
thing in which you don’t have to lose yourself. Perhaps you’re sick,
you’re sad, you’re stressed, or you just want a little babying. Indulging
yourself is okay because you are confident that you can go back to the
independent you when you’ve gotten your fill.
 Disagreeing and fighting safely. This means you are developing skills
for being in conflict with another person and for resolving conflict
successfully. It includes the skills of compromise, in which each person’s
needs are honored. Like saying no, it means trusting that anger and
disagreement won’t do either of you or the relationship in.
 Figuring out how to repair damage when it’s done. This is the part
where, among other things, you each acknowledge the other’s wounds
and say “I’m sorry.”
 Ensuring that sexual relationships include respect for your needs as
well as your partner’s. This includes knowing your needs, being able to
talk about them, feeling entitled to ask to have them met, and trusting
your partner to respond with respect.
Your relationship with your therapist or members of a therapy group is a safe
place to find out about and practice healthy relationship skills, including
those of boundary-making and intimate connection.
To measure your progress regarding developing healthy relationships, you
can use a worksheet like the example shown in Table 8-5.

Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

Tolerating Your Emotions
Your eating disorder has served as a means of managing uncomfortable, and
sometimes overwhelming, emotions. The good news is that it helped you sur-
vive when you didn’t know what else to do. The bad news is that repeatedly
turning to food or restricting convinced you that you couldn’t tolerate diffi-
cult feelings. In recovery, you discover that you can!
Acknowledging the feelings of life experiences doesn’t make life itself easier.
But it does smooth out the self-inflicted hardships that come from dodging
and weaving to avoid feeling. Maybe your eating disorder has been your main
buffer. Or maybe you’ve also relied on the use of substances, alcohol, or other
addictive behaviors. You may protect yourself with the emotional disconnection
allowed by dissociation. Or you may resort to workaholism. Whatever stops
you from knowing your emotional experience of events is bound to make trou-
ble for you in some way. You’re also likely to be left with a sense of emptiness,
as if a dimension of you or your life is missing.
Being able to tolerate your feelings means you don’t have to do anything to
get rid of them. Even the most upsetting ones are safe to acknowledge, in
spite of the fact that they may be uncomfortable. Grief, disappointment, anger,
humiliation, rejection . . . these emotions remain as yucky-feeling as ever. What
changes is that you discover that you can manage them; you can tolerate being
uncomfortable. And the more you work at it, the more discomfort you can
handle, like the way your lungs expand when you’ve been working out regularly.
Allowing and assessing feelings
While it may be hard to imagine now, in recovery you gain confidence in your
ability to manage your emotions without resorting to your eating disorder.
You don’t fear being overwhelmed by your feelings because you have increased
your toleration for them and you’ve developed more skills for coping with
them (like self-soothing). People who are confident about managing their
emotions do two things:
 They stay in awareness long enough to know what they’re feeling and
what those feelings are about.
 They take steps to feel better.
Being aware of your feelings
Staying in awareness means knowing what you’re feeling in the present
moment. The better you get at it and the more confidence you develop that
you can tolerate whatever comes up, the more precise you are in what you’re
aware of. For example, in the past you may just have had a vague sense of “I
feel bad.” As you increase your ability to stay focused and aware of what
120
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

you’re feeling, you’re better able to discover the all-important details: “I feel
upset with myself because I snapped at Dad last night. He was only trying to
help. There’s just something about the way he puts things — like if I’d only
listened to him — that makes me furious so I can’t listen.” Here’s an example:
Mindy spent the entire day with a cloud over her head. Something didn’t
feel right. In her eating disordered days, she would have binged when she
got home to dispel the cloud. In recovery, she used the quiet of being
home to really tune in to the feelings creating the cloud. She recognized
that pit in her stomach: She felt guilt, mixed with a little anger and a little
fear. By staying with the feelings, Mindy was able to trace them back to
their source.
Mindy’s friend, Alison, had asked her to go to a party Saturday night. Mindy
had been looking forward to some downtime for herself. Also, she wasn’t
comfortable with the crowd she knew would be at the party. It had taken a
lot of courage to tell Alison no, something Mindy couldn’t have done in the
past. Alison’s disappointment was obvious, even though she said it was okay.
Mindy tuned in to her thoughts about what happened: “Shouldn’t I have
just gone to the party? I know there’s this guy Alison wants to meet who’s
going to be there.” (There’s the guilt: “I’m a bad friend.”) “Couldn’t Alison
have cut me some slack? She knows how hard I’ve been working.” (Whoops.
Now we’ve got the anger.) “What if Alison decides other people are just
more fun and drops me?” (And now we’ve got the fear.) Read on to find
out how Mindy resolves these feelings.
Addressing what feels bad
Any problem in life is easier to address if you know exactly what’s wrong.
Silence on the other end of the line because your cell phone needs recharging
requires a different remedy than a silence that occurs when you’ve just
shocked or angered your friend into speechlessness! Trying to address your
feelings without knowing what they are is like stumbling around in a dark
room. In recovery you find ways to feel more confident about knowing all
your feelings. Knowing what your feelings are about means identifying
 The emotion that’s coming up: Anger, sadness, fear, frustration, shame,
disappointment, and so on.
 The trigger for (source of) the emotion: A person (including yourself),
an event or behavior that happened (she dissed you, you tripped in
front of everyone, your parents argued), an event or behavior that didn’t
happen (he didn’t call, you didn’t make honor roll).
 The cause of the emotion: The reason the trigger had the impact it did.
For instance, the person that dissed you is your ex’s new girlfriend. Your
parents’ arguing has been happening more frequently and is getting more
severe. He didn’t call even though he promised he would and it was your
birthday. You didn’t make the honor roll and the whole family was counting
on you for it.
121
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

In the example in the preceding section, Mindy tuned in to what went on and
how it affected her emotionally. This allowed her to take steps to make her-
self feel better. Instead of burying the feelings, she figured out what made her
feel bad in the first place. For instance, she reminded herself of all the ways
she’d been a good friend to Alison and that this one event didn’t change that.
But she also decided she’d been a little sharp with Alison, so she called her
and said so. She also suggested they have lunch. Even though Mindy didn’t
want to go to the party, Alison still wanted to see her. Finally, Mindy decided
she’d probably overreacted to the episode because she was so exhausted.
She used this signal to make sure she got to her yoga class on Saturday. Yoga
always seemed to have a soothing effect on her when she was frazzled.
Making better choices through awareness
You may wonder, “Isn’t thinking about what’s upsetting me just wallowing in
my feelings?” It all depends on how you use it. The point about awareness is
that it allows you to make choices. I suppose you could wallow, if that felt right
to you. But you can also use awareness to make positive choices when you
feel an emotional cloud hanging over your day. Any number of constructive
possibilities becomes available once you know what’s going on.
Not all emotional clouds are dispelled as easily as others. Some are more
complicated because they invite in old, unresolved emotional wounds or
trauma. Others involve ongoing situations in which you have to live with
threat or uncertainty, such as waiting for the results of a medical test or
knowing your job could be cut. Sometimes in recovery the most valuable dis-
coveries turn out to be those things which simply soothe you without caus-
ing you harm. Even in the most difficult circumstances, awareness gives you
the gift of choice and, where needed, the possibility of healing. (I go into
more detail about developing emotion management skills in Chapter 14.)
To measure your progress with emotion management skills, you can use a
worksheet like the example shown in Table 8-6.

Maintaining a Healthy Self-Image
Creating a positive self-image that isn’t based on your weight is a challenge of
recovery that requires you to be better, or smarter anyway, than your culture.
Keeping that image usually means tuning out many of the unhealthy aspects
of the culture when it comes to its emphasis on weight. Even women who’ve
never had a formal eating disorder (and an increasing number of men) struggle
with this one.
A healthy recovery means you quit turning to your weight to find out if you’re
okay or whether you’re likable or worthwhile. In recovery, you take your
worth as a given. You don’t have to earn it each day on the scales, or any-
where else.
Seeing your worth beyond your weight
You spent your eating disordered years so focused on your weight that you
forgot to notice all the other terrific things about yourself. These will be the
new basis of your positive self-image in recovery. You don’t have to wait! Start
making a list of your non-weight–related assets right now. Make sure you only
include answers that actually feel meaningful to you.
 What do you like about yourself?
 What do you think of as your strengths?
 What accomplishments are you proud of?
 What compliments do you frequently get that have nothing to do with
body size?
 What qualities do people tell you they appreciate in you?
Answers to questions like these will provide you with an anchor when you
feel the pull of your own weight-based judgments in the future. You aren’t
required to stick with your old responses. You can begin to build new ones.
Deflating weight obsession
In recovery it becomes your reflex to move weight to the back burner of your
attention, partly because you know that to focus on your weight is to risk
fueling your eating disorder. But it also becomes your habit as a result of
practicing. You may not be able to stop weight thoughts from coming into
your mind. But as long as you’re walking in the land of awareness, you can
make choices about what you do with those thoughts when they pop up.
123
Chapter 8: Seeing What Recovery Looks Like

Here are some strategies that may help you keep your weight on the back
burner:
 Look in the mirror once before you leave home — you don’t want an
uneven hemline or mismatched socks — but then get out of there. Don’t
dwell.
 Take a friend without an eating disorder clothes shopping with you.
She’ll see you more clearly than you see yourself.
 Purchase accessories you love that don’t have anything to do with
body size. Best are items that emphasize physical qualities you like,
such as a scarf that shows off your dazzling eye color.
 Always have in mind that list of all the qualities you like about yourself.
These may be physical or personal traits or both — whichever most
effectively pulls you out of that weight-centered universe.
 Think about something else. Sometimes it’s okay not to be in awareness!
 Practice movement for pleasure (see the section “Exercising in a Healthy
Way,” earlier in this chapter). It adds the dimension of appreciating your
body from the inside out in ways that have nothing to do with weight.
 Regularly update your list of other things you like about yourself, the
things that really matter about you. It keeps your eye on the ball where
it belongs.
To measure your progress regarding regaining a positive image, you can use a
worksheet like the example shown in Table 8-7.

ospital? Residential treatment? Outpatient care? Once you accept the
idea that you need treatment for your eating disorder, you’re faced with
a dizzying array of choices. What’s the right setting for your treatment? How
do you know? What experts do you need to include? In what order? How do
you go about choosing them?
In this chapter I walk you through those first decisions you need to make. To
make the best early treatment decisions, you need to determine how severe
your eating disorder is. I go over how to match the severity of your symptoms
with the treatment options out there. I explain who you can work with to help
you figure this out. I also give you the information you need to find the pro-
fessionals who’ll make up your treatment team and suggestions for selecting
the ones who are right for you.
Finding the Right Therapist
No matter how many people end up being involved in your recovery, getting
better begins with you and an individual therapist. (See the section “Assembling
Your Team” to find out about the different kinds of therapists.) The two of
you are going to be doing some heavy lifting together, focusing on who you
are, how you can get better, and how you can reach your fullest potential. If
you’re going to do this kind of intimate work with a person, you want to make

126
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 
sure she’s someone you trust and feel comfortable with. How do you decide
that? How do you find such a person in the first place? I address these questions
in this section. In fact, most of what I discuss applies equally well to choosing
any member of your treatment team with whom you’ll need to work intensely
and intimately during the recovery process.
Finding an eating disorder therapist
The first order of business is to find therapists who specialize in working
with eating disorders. The following resources can get you started:
 This book’s “Resource Guide”: A great place to start your search for a
therapist who specializes in eating disorders is the “Resource Guide” at
the back of this book. There you find Web sites for a number of eating
disorder organizations that keep lists of such therapists.
 Online chat rooms: Chat rooms are becoming more common as sources
for eating disorder therapy recommendations. Everything I just said
about needing to check credentials applies to names you get from chat
rooms. But chat rooms provide an unusual opportunity to get feedback
from people who’ve been in your shoes.
 Eating disorder programs: Another good potential source of eating dis-
order specialists is any program that treats or studies eating disorders.
This may be a nearby university, hospital, or residential treatment facility.
 People within eating disorder professional networks: If you’ve already
located any other members of your treatment team — for example, a
nutritionist or a primary care provider (PCP) who treats eating disorders —
these people are likely to be working with therapists and can probably
recommend some they like. Even if you’re just starting to assemble your
team, your family’s PCP probably has a pretty good file on hand of
specialists, which just may include an eating disorder therapist.
 School guidance counselors or college student health centers: Chances
are they’ve made eating disorder referrals before.
 Word-of-mouth: Do you have a friend who likes her therapist? Maybe he
knows an eating disorder specialist. Does your neighbor’s kid have an
eating disorder? You may want to ask him for a recommendation.
Checking credentials
Credentials usually refer to professional degrees and state licensure to practice.
These days you can get most of this kind of information about a prospective
therapist from the Internet — and more and more people do just that. You
can also ask directly. Any therapist you’re interviewing should be ready, willing,
and able to explain his credentials.

In addition to credentials, you want to know about this therapist’s experience.
You may want to ask the following questions:
 How long has he been in practice?
 How long has he been treating eating disorders?
 Has he had any special training in eating disorders?
 Does he treat all eating disorders or just some?
 What proportion of his practice is devoted to eating disorders?
You are entitled to ask questions. You need to know about the qualifications
of someone who may be taking on a crucial and demanding role in your life. If
the therapist you’re interviewing makes you feel uncomfortable for asking
about qualifications, he’s probably not the person for you.
Knowing what you can expect
Some qualities that you should expect from any therapist go beyond training
and expertise. Call them the human touch. Ask yourself the following questions:
 Does he listen?
 Does he seem interested in me and my situation?
 Does he seem to “get” me?
 Is he willing to work with other people on my treatment team?
 Is he respectful when discussing issues like fees and scheduling 
appointments?
 Does he respond respectfully to any doubts I express?
 Does he understand professional boundaries, in particular, that my therapy
is not the place for him to get his personal needs met?
If you answer “no” to all or most of the items on this list about a particular
therapist, consider restarting your search. On the other hand, if just one or two
things trouble you about the therapist, bring them up. You may feel reassured
by what he has to say. You’ll also find out if this therapist is willing to discuss
your concerns about him. A successful resolution means you’ve already become
stronger as a team. (I talk more about building the therapy partnership through
discussing disappointments and making repairs in Chapter 13.)
127
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

Determining goodness-of-fit
A therapist can have the best of credentials and training. She can be the best
thing since sliced bread in the eyes of the friend who referred her. She can
even respond pretty well to the basic questions I list in the preceding section.
But that doesn’t necessarily mean she’s the right therapist for you. Intangibles,
just like the chemistry you have with a good friend or partner, determine how
you feel about working with a particular therapist.
A good “fit” is important when you’re deciding on a therapist. You may be
tempted to try to make do even though something just doesn’t feel right.
Frankly, if this is the only eating disorder therapist within a hundred-mile
radius, making do probably makes sense until something changes to increase
your options. But assuming more choices are available to you now, your
uncomfortable feelings matter.
Recognizing a good fit can be tricky. Having an eating disorder may make you
feel uncomfortable with a lot of people. Being close to someone who seems
to understand you may make you uncomfortable if you feel undeserving. Or
you may feel that people always let you down, no matter how nice they seem.
If you’re feeling uncomfortable with a therapist, you may want to start by
asking yourself if this is a really familiar feeling for you. If the answer is “yes,”
it may be worthwhile to stick around a little longer, talk your feelings over
with the therapist, and see whether doing so makes a difference.
Intangibles are, by definition, hard to put into words. But you may notice a
few of the following qualities regarding the therapist’s style and personality
that may affect your feelings about goodness-of-fit:
 How she balances talking and listening. (This may also reflect the style
of treatment. For example, an analyst talks less than a behaviorist.)
 How she expresses herself and gives feedback.
 How energetic she is.
 What her sense of humor is like.
 How well she expresses warmth.
 What choices she makes regarding self-disclosure.
Most people have a range in terms of what they can live with along these
dimensions. If you really respect a therapist’s work and think she can help
you, it may be worth stretching a little, even if her laugh makes you grind
your teeth. But you may want to think long and hard about the therapist
whose style is a regular distraction or who makes it hard for you to settle in
comfortably to focus on the work at hand — that is, you and your recovery.
128
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Assembling Your Team
Eating disorders cover a lot of territory in the people they afflict. If you have
an eating disorder, you know only too well that your body, mind, and spirit
are all affected. Getting better usually means involving several experts to
cover all the bases (Chapter 11 discusses including nonprofessionals, such as
family, in your recovery). You want the best treatment team you can assem-
ble to meet your individual needs. In this section I go over the experts you
can choose from to create your team.
The size of your treatment team depends on the severity of your symptoms
and the number of companion disorders (such as depression or alcohol
addiction) you bring to treatment. Speaking very generally, people with anorexia
usually require a larger team at the beginning due to their more serious medical
situations. As treatment progresses and physical symptoms improve, the team
may grow smaller. On the other end of the spectrum, people with binge eating
disorder (BED) tend to have few medical complications and present less dire
circumstances. A treatment team for someone with BED can be pretty minimal.
Somewhere in the middle are the team needs of people with bulimia. Of course,
your own team needs depend on your particular situation.
Addressing psychological 
and emotional health
An eating disorder springs from the way you think and feel about yourself,
and subsequently affects your behavior and relationships. All these elements —
thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and relationships — are the domain of the psy-
chological and emotional experts on your eating disorder recovery team. The
following experts are typical members of the psychological and emotional part
of an eating disorder treatment team.
The therapist’s role for each form of therapy
Therapy for eating disorders typically falls into four major categories: individual
therapy, family therapy, couples therapy, and group therapy. You may benefit
from participating in one or more of these types of therapy as part of your
eating disorder treatment, depending on your personal needs. Following is a
brief rundown of the role of the therapist in each type of therapy:
 Individual therapist: Your individual therapist is your team expert about
the psychological and behavioral aspects of your eating disorder. She
helps you reduce your eating disorder symptoms and build a strong
recovery. (In Chapter 10, I outline a number of different approaches indi-
vidual therapists use with eating disorders.) She should have specialized
training in working with eating disorders and in her particular approach
129
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

to treatment. Your individual therapist serves as your guide and cheer-
leader throughout the treatment process and helps you understand your
role in getting better. If you have a trauma history, your best choice is a
therapist who’s experienced in trauma treatment. That’s one fewer part
of your therapy that will eventually have to be farmed out to someone else.
 Family therapist: People of any age may decide to include their family in
their eating disorder treatment. But for children and young teenagers,
some kind of family involvement is a must. (You can read about reasons
for choosing family treatment in Chapter 11.) A family therapist works
with the entire family to help the person with the eating disorder. He
helps the family change any patterns that unintentionally contribute to
the problem. These therapists usually have specialized training in family
therapy.
 Couples therapist: If you have an eating disorder and you have a part-
ner, chances are the two interact with each other in some way. And this
may not be helpful to either your recovery or your partnership! Couples
therapists often are added to the treatment team to help disentangle
things. Couples therapists usually don’t need specialized training in
eating disorders. (You can read more about couples therapy for people
with eating disorders in Chapter 11.)
 Group therapist: A group therapist has specialized training in leading
therapy groups. Your group therapist should also have training in eating
disorder treatment. Group therapists help group members help each
other with their eating disorder problems. They also help members
become aware of interaction patterns that develop within the group.
This way, group participants gain insights from what happens among
themselves to improve their relationship skills. These skills are an
important part of recovery. (You can find out more about group therapy
and other kinds of groups in Chapter 11.)
Sometimes the same person wears both the individual and the family therapy
hats. In one version of this, the family therapist sees everyone together for
family sessions and has separate sessions with the person with the eating
disorder. In another version, he sees the person with the eating disorder indi-
vidually, but consults separately with parents instead of seeing everyone
together. Others mix and match these options.
The jury is still out on whether having one therapist wear multiple hats is a
good idea. Those who endorse the idea feel it’s helpful to have one person
who can see the whole picture. All the better to coordinate what’s happening
in different types of treatments. Opponents point out that young people with
eating disorders often tend to get lost in their families. They feel it’s impor-
tant for those with the eating disorder to have an entirely separate setting
where they can explore their feelings and develop their own points of view.
130
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

A therapist by any other name is still a therapist
What kinds of official credentials should you expect the therapists on your
treatment team to have? Actually, people licensed in any of the following
professions can be individual, family, couples, or group therapists:
 Social work: This person has a master’s or doctorate of social work
(MSW or DSW) degree. She may also have an LCSW (licensed clinical
social worker) or similar designation to show state licensure.
 Psychology: This person’s degree is a PhD or PsyD. (Make sure the
person’s degree is in psychology. A PhD in deep-sea fishing isn’t likely to
do you much good.)
 Counseling: A licensed professional counselor (LPC) has a master’s or
doctorate degree in counseling or a master’s in psychology or some-
times in education. Some LPCs focus on current problem intervention
only; others provide a full range of psychotherapy treatment.
 Pastoral counseling: Recognized members of the clergy who have
received any of the preceding degrees plus advanced training in psy-
chotherapy may provide psychotherapy services.
 Nursing: A registered nurse with advanced training and a master’s or
doctorate degree may practice psychotherapy. The designation is
advanced practice registered nurse (APRN).
 Psychiatry: This person’s degree is an MD, so he can prescribe medications
in addition to providing counseling.
People are often confused by the term psychotherapist. A psychotherapist is
not necessarily someone who belongs to a licensed professional group.
“Psychotherapist” is a general term for anyone who provides therapy by talk-
ing with a patient to alleviate psychological symptoms. People in any of the
professions listed above can choose to become psychotherapists. But, be on
your toes! People without any kind of professional degree or training can
legally use the term as well. You need to make sure you know the basis on
which the person you’re considering has set up shop.
Addressing physical health
Eating disorders get physical! They involve your body’s fuel supply and its
balance of a slew of hormones and other body chemicals that affect the way
you function. The bottom line is that you may need some body experts on your
team to help you achieve the right physical balance for your recovery.
131
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

Primary care provider (PCP)
Your primary care provider (PCP) can be an internist, pediatrician, or family
doctor. He’s the person who provides the initial medical evaluation sizing up
the physical consequences of your disorder. He also provides ongoing treat-
ment for any medical problems. If hospitalization is needed, he’s the one who
makes that call. If you need to restore your weight to get better, and can safely
do so as an outpatient, your PCP may oversee this process. Or he may work
together with your nutritionist until your weight is back in a healthy range.
Make sure your PCP specializes in working with eating disorders. He needs to
be on top of the many medical risks specific to eating disorders. Also, if you
have anorexia, he needs to understand and be prepared for the intensive work
you two have ahead of you to get your weight and health back up to snuff.
PCPs frequently prescribe psychiatric medications. This arrangement has
both plusses and minuses. On the plus side are
 Familiarity: You probably already know your PCP. You may appreciate a
familiar face about now, and that’s one fewer person you need to add to
your team.
 Cost: Getting your medications prescribed by your PCP usually costs
less money.
 Case coordination: Your PCP can easily coordinate any psychiatric
medication you take with the rest of your physical picture.
On the minus side, PCPs usually
 Have less expertise: If your medication needs are in any way complicated,
working with someone who specializes in psychological issues and
psychiatric medications can be advantageous. Prescribing psychiatric
medications is what this person does all day. She should be better at it
than most PCPs.
 Are less current: A PCP is less likely than a psychopharmacologist to be
up-to-date on what’s new with medications like the ones you may be
considering. He’s got too many other fish to fry.
If your situation doesn’t seem too complicated — you’re not physically ill,
your symptoms aren’t severe, and your companion disorders don’t include
more than mild to moderate depression or anxiety — you may start with
your PCP (assuming he’s comfortable prescribing this kind of medication). If
it all works out well, you’re good to go. But if you’re not getting the results
you need in a reasonable amount of time (say, 6 to 8 weeks), consider con-
sulting with a psychopharmacologist.
132
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Nutritionist
A nutritionist — in some states a registered dietician (RD) — is the member
of your team who gets into the trenches with you to help guide you back to
healthy eating. She supplies you with accurate information and buries some
eating disorder mythology along the way. She also provides you with tools,
like food logs, to help you become more aware of your eating patterns and
zero in on the trouble spots. Your nutritionist helps you set reasonable,
reachable food goals and shows you how to problem-solve to reach them.
Not all nutritionists specialize in working with eating disorders. Make sure
yours does.
Psychopharmacologist
The psychopharmacologist on your team is the person who evaluates your need
for psychiatric medication. (I discuss medications used for eating disorder
treatment in Chapter 12.) A psychopharmacologist has a medical degree
(MD) and is also board certified in psychiatry as a medical specialty.
If a psychopharmacologist recommends medication for you, and you agree to
try it, she follows you for as long as you take the medication she prescribes.
She monitors you for side effects, any changes in dosage, and the need to
change medications or add new ones. You two have the most contact when
you start a new medication or if you have problems with medications you’re
already on. When things are stable and you’re getting the desired results from
your medication, you and she may only be in contact every three to six months.
Some psychopharmacologists also do individual psychotherapy. If your 
individual psychotherapist is a psychiatrist, she can handle any medication
needs you have. One-stop shopping.
Designating a team leader
With so many people thinking, evaluating, and making recommendations on
your behalf, you’re going to want someone coordinating all that energy. This
doesn’t mean your team leader is the boss of everybody. She just makes sure
she knows what everybody on the team is thinking and planning so she can
help bring everyone’s ideas together into one overall plan.
If you’re an adult or young adult, your individual therapist most likely is the
central player on your team. She’s usually the one you see the most — from
one to several times per week when you begin treatment. So she may be the
one who knows you best and has the bigger picture in her sights. (With
younger people, emphasis is likely to shift to the family therapist.)
Leadership changes if you need to go into the hospital (see the next section).
Your PCP usually leads this transition and coordinates your hospital stay.
133
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

Determining the Intervention You Need
Level of intervention refers to the intensity of your treatment. Two ingredients
determine this factor:
 Structure: How much your time and choices are supervised, organized,
and planned
 Frequency: How often you meet for treatment
Treatment in which you go to a special setting that focuses on your eating
disorder around the clock is more intensive than treatment that allows you to
stay home, go about your business, and see your experts a few times a week.
How do you decide what level of intervention you need? Is your situation an
emergency? In this section I go over how to determine the answers to these
questions and where you can turn for help.
If you’re a minor child, your parents make most of these decisions in collabo-
ration with your therapy team. If you’re a teen, you’re expected to share your
opinions in the decision-making process. In some extreme instances, even if
you’re an adult, decision-making gets taken out of your hands. This only
occurs when your life is in jeopardy (see the next section, “Do you need
urgent hospitalization?”). The most clear-cut example of such a threat occurs
when you present a suicide risk. Making decisions against your will when
you’re starving intentionally is much more controversial. The judgment call
to hospitalize and feed you against your will depends on the treatment team
you’re working with.
Do you need urgent hospitalization?
You get the most intensive level of treatment on a hospital ward. It provides
what’s called a controlled environment, meaning you don’t have much latitude
for making bad choices. You’re closely monitored, your food and weight
choices are negotiated and contracted like international trade agreements,
and you have no opportunity to make mistakes. Under what circumstances
do you need such controlled conditions? In the following sections I outline
the emergency and non-emergency situations that make hospitalization
either necessary or desirable.
Urgent emergency hospitalization
Hospitalization comes up as an emergency measure when it’s the only way to
guarantee your life. Two circumstances require immediate hospitalization:
 Suicidal impulses: You have suicidal feelings and you can’t be sure you
won’t act on them. (In Chapter 7 you can read more about determining
134
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

your level of suicidal risk.) If you have any doubt about your current risk
level or your ability to manage your impulses, call 911 or go straight to a
hospital emergency room.
 Severe weight loss in anorexia: Your doctor will hospitalize you to keep
you alive if all three of the following factors apply to you:
• Your weight has fallen below 25 percent of ideal weight (see
Chapter 2) or is otherwise low enough to put your health at risk as
determined by your doctor.
• Your key vital signs, like pulse and core body temperature, are in
dangerous territory.
• You refuse to eat.
Warning signs for you or people around you to watch out for include
• Fainting
• Severe dizziness on standing (can also occur with bulimia)
• Collapsing
• Chest pain (can also occur with bulimia)
These symptoms mean you should head straight to your doctor or an
emergency room. Ask questions later.
Urgent non-emergency hospitalization
Even if your situation isn’t life-or-death, sometimes a hospital setting is still a
good choice. For example:
 Your level of starvation is making it difficult to concentrate or think
clearly. You can’t participate well in your treatment if your brain isn’t
functioning on all cylinders. (I review the effects of starvation on the
brain in Chapter 7.)
 Your eating disorder symptom picture is highly unstable. If you’re
bingeing and/or purging many times a day, it can be hard to focus on
much else. If you’re purging this often, you’re at risk medically. Getting a
handle on a pattern this entrenched is difficult outside a controlled
environment.
 You need to withdraw from severe abuse of laxatives, diuretics, or
other means of purging. Doing this under medical supervision is useful
to avoid the risk of bowel obstruction.
 You have other medical complications. Your eating disorder may be
causing other medical conditions, most commonly diabetes, to deteriorate.
Hospitalization may be the most reliable way to get things back on track.
135
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

Though most of these situations focus on your medical condition, you’re best
off on a hospital unit that specializes in eating disorders. You want staff mem-
bers who understand not only your physical condition, but also the psycho-
logical issues that are involved.
Is non-urgent intensive treatment 
a good option?
You don’t have to be in a medical or psychological crisis for intensive treat-
ment to be a good idea. While taking yourself out of your life for weeks or
months is pretty disruptive, some circumstances may call for this kind of
more drastic action:
 Your disorder is chronic. You’ve had your disorder for a very long time —
years. This actually makes an eating disorder harder to treat. You may
need bigger medicine.
 You’ve tried outpatient options with inadequate results. When you’ve
given an outpatient plan your best effort but your symptoms remain
pretty much as is, it’s time to do something different. The same reasoning
applies if you find you simply can’t follow through with expectations in
your outpatient treatment. Upping the level of treatment intensity is one
thing to try in each case.
 You have companion disorders. The more companion disorders you
have, the harder it is to get things stabilized on an outpatient basis. This
is particularly true if the companion disorders include alcohol or drug
addiction.
Letting things go too long without adequate treatment can be especially risky
if you have anorexia. The mortality risk of your disorder increases over time.
Getting a Good Medical Work-Up
Getting a good medical work-up is one of the first things you need to do to
get started with eating disorder treatment. It comes first because you need to
know whether your health situation is an emergency. In an emergency, other
components of your treatment must be put on hold until the emergency is
taken care of. (See the section “Does your situation require urgent hospital-
ization?” earlier in this chapter.) Short of a medical emergency, what’s the
need for a medical evaluation? How do the results affect your treatment
plans? How do you find the right person to do the evaluation? I answer these
and related questions in this section.
136
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

How do I find a good doctor?
It’s important to work with a doctor who knows what to look for and how to
treat eating disorder–related medical problems. How do you find such a
doctor? Start here:
 Check out the “Resource Guide” in the back of this book for Web sites
with listings of doctors.
 Ask your therapist. He may know a doctor who specializes in eating 
disorders.
 Call the American Medical Association (AMA) or go to its Web site,
http://webapps.ama-assn.org/doctorfinder/home.html.
Who needs a medical work-up?
Anyone who has an eating disorder needs to get a good medical work-up. The
stakes are highest if you have anorexia. You’re the most likely of anyone with
an eating disorder to have a life-threatening condition. If you have bulimia,
you are at the next-highest level of risk. Though your condition is less likely
to be life-threatening, you may be doing some serious damage to your body
with purging behavior. (You can read about the specific effects of starving
and purging in Chapter 6.) Getting thoroughly checked out and treated for
potential problems is critically important.
Even if your medical needs don’t qualify as an emergency, being mindful
about your physical health is part of your recovery. Taking care of business,
self-care-wise, helps to build self-esteem.
What happens during a medical work-up?
Like almost any visit to the doctor, an eating disorder work-up has two parts.
First, the doctor asks you questions about your symptoms, habits, and his-
tory, and then she conducts a physical exam.
Eating disorder symptom questions focus on dieting, starving, bingeing, purg-
ing, and exercise. Your doctor wants to know what you do, when you started
doing it, how often you do it, and so on.
Eating disorder side-effect questions cover topics like your menstrual peri-
ods, energy level, unusual heart behavior (such as palpitations), digestive
problems, and so on. Your doctor also takes a more general health history.
She needs to know about any other medical conditions you may have, like
diabetes, and whether your eating disorder affects them.
137
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

The thoroughness of the physical exam depends on your disorder and symptom
picture. If you are starving and/or purging, your exam includes more than if
your only eating disorder symptom is bingeing. Starving and purging do a lot
more damage to your body with a lot more potentially deadly results. Your
doctor may request the following tests:
 Blood work: The basics include testing for such things as anemia and
determining your levels of electrolytes (minerals that keep your heart
beating). More extensive blood testing may be needed to see if starvation
has hurt the functioning of any of your organs.
 Electrocardiogram: This tests for possible damage to the way your
heart functions.
 Chest X-ray: This shows whether starvation has made your heart shrink.
 Bone density test: This shows whether your bones have lost some of
their substance to starvation.
Unless you’re especially sensitive to needles (used for drawing samples for
the blood work), all these tests are painless.
What gets decided?
What does your doctor do with the results of your medical evaluation? Your
doctor uses them to make immediate decisions for your medical care, including
 Whether you need hospitalization to be safe
 Whether other health symptoms need to be treated and how
 Whether other medical specialists are needed
If you have anorexia, the medical evaluation is also useful in determining the
following:
 What a healthy goal weight is for you and what the plan is for achieving it.
 Whether you need to gain weight before you’ll be able to participate in
other treatment. (Starvation affects your ability to think and make 
judgments.)
Making a Plan for Your Treatment
Eating disorders cover a lot of territory, so their treatment has to cover a lot
of territory too. To cover a lot of territory effectively, you need a plan. Two
major considerations go into the design of your treatment plan:
138
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 What are your treatment priorities? If you have a number of things to
work on, what comes first?
 Who’s responsible for making the plan?
I discuss answers to both questions in this section.
First things first . . . but what comes first?
In Chapter 7, I point out that eating disorders seldom travel alone. They usu-
ally come with one or more companion disorders. Examples include alcohol
and drug abuse, compulsive exercise, depression, OCD, and anxiety.
When a therapist or psychopharmacologist evaluates your situation, she
looks for the presence of any of these companion disorders. They need to be
treated, too. Recovery from your eating disorder may partly depend on
improvement in companion disorders.
The problem is that you can’t do everything at once! Some components of
your treatment have to be addressed before others. But how do you decide
what comes first? Though the answers depend on your particular situation,
here are a few general guidelines:
 Behaviors that are the most self-destructive come first. If drug or alcohol
addiction is threatening your job, your family, or your legal status, you
need to focus on these conditions before you tackle the less destructive
ones.
 Behaviors and conditions that alter your brain come first. Anything that
interferes with participation in your recovery work has to be a priority in
your treatment. This includes the starvation state as well as mind-altering
substances. Severe states of depression and anxiety also fall in this
category.
 Out-of-control bingeing and/or purging usually demand an early,
structured intervention. Whether inpatient or outpatient, a more inten-
sive symptom focus is usually necessary when symptoms are severe.
With mild or moderate symptoms, you can afford to see if they get
better in a less symptom-focused treatment.
 Out-of-control eating disorder symptoms coexisting with out-of-control
companion disorder behaviors usually require an inpatient setting for
treatment. With this combination, you have too much room for harm
and too few resources for getting better. You need some outside 
containment until you can supply more of your own.
 Treatment for underlying trauma usually comes later in your treatment,
after you’ve created some external and internal stability. Trauma
treatment can be overwhelming. You need to be confident you’ve
accumulated the resources you need to manage whatever comes up.
139
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

Often treatment for one disorder helps with another. For example, if you’re
medicated for depression, the same medication may help you with anxiety
and obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms. Similarly, meditation and self-
soothing techniques you use to work on your addiction are also useful in
recovering from your eating disorder.
Your therapist can recommend a plan
Your individual therapist is likely to take a position of team leadership in
devising your treatment plan. He’s the one who goes over with you the goals
for your treatment and the overall plan for action, including what comes first.
The blueprint for treatment he suggests needs to make sense to you because
you’re investing a lot of yourself in it.
At the same time, keep in mind that a lot can happen along the way that may
call for changes in the original plan. So the key is for you and your therapist
to hold the plan not only with some commitment, but also with some flexibil-
ity. Each of you should be prepared to speak up about how the plan is work-
ing out and whether some tinkering is called for.
Choosing Where to Get Treatment
Earlier in this chapter, in the section “Determining What Level of Intervention
You Need,” I discuss different levels of intervention, reflecting both how
much structure you need in your treatment and how frequent intervention
needs to be. The inpatient and outpatient options I go over in this section are
listed from most intensive (highly structured and controlled) to least inten-
sive (less structured and controlled).
Inpatient hospital care
If you need hospital care for an eating disorder, you’re best off in a specialized
unit which only treats eating disorders. Staff members are familiar with the
medical and psychological issues you face and are trained to work with them.
Most eating disorder hospitalizations are for people with anorexia. Bulimia
can usually be managed on an outpatient basis, although a small number of
people with bulimia have symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization.
Some of these hospitalizations are purely in order to stabilize medical effects
140
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

of starvation (or purging, for bulimia) that have gotten out of hand. Your
treatment on such a unit includes
 Setting weight goals: Your doctor or the hospital team determines what
weight is medically safe for you.
 Re-feeding: This is the process of getting enough calories into your
system for you to achieve your weight goals and become healthy again.
It also involves getting your eating habits back to normal. Just how
much of the re-feeding looks like normal food at the beginning depends
on how much you need to gain. If your medical condition is dire, you
may need nutritional supplements for awhile.
 Limiting your physical activity: If your weight is low enough, your medical
safety may require bed rest or some other limit on your activity level
until you gain enough weight.
 Normalizing eating patterns and reducing purging behavior: If you
have a binge/purge pattern, you’re supervised so you can’t do either and
you receive skills training to reduce your symptoms.
In the old days, structure on an inpatient unit meant control. Many inpatient
programs are discovering that putting as much control in the hands of the
patient as possible works better. How much you need to weigh to be dis-
charged probably isn’t going to be put up for a vote, but various options for
getting there may be. One issue, however, continues to be upsetting and con-
troversial: how much control to take with patients who can’t seem to choose
life over thinness.
Some hospital units focus only on treating the medical aspects of your eating
disorder. Other eating disorder units focus on the psychological aspects as
well. These units may include individual, group and/or family therapy.
Residential treatment
Residential treatment facilities, like hospital units, provide round-the-clock
care for eating disorders. However, the environment in residential care is
more informal and home-like. You’re encouraged to shop for food, prepare
meals, and eat with others. Residential facilities believe this more natural set-
ting helps you apply the skills you acquire to your real life when you leave.
Residential facilities usually cost less than hospitals. People stay longer — on
average, around three months. (Length of stay, of course, depends on factors
like how severe your symptoms are and how fast you’re getting better.) A
longer stay means you have a better chance of achieving your treatment goals
because new behaviors and thinking patterns have more time to take hold.
141
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

Programs vary considerably in what they offer to help you get better. Some
are set up to work with people whose medical conditions are fragile; some
aren’t. Some focus on just a few treatment approaches, such as group ther-
apy and family education. Others offer a pretty sophisticated menu of treat-
ments, including alternative therapies and trauma treatment. Some have a
particular spiritual or religious orientation. Almost all focus on whole-person
recovery as opposed to just symptom reduction. Almost all rely on the power
of a community of support to strengthen your healing process. You can get
specifics on what treatments a particular program offers by taking a look at
the program’s Web site. (Check out the “Resource Guide” at the back of this
book for Web sites that list residential facilities.)
Residential treatment may be a good first choice for you if your eating disor-
der symptoms have really dug in their heels, making them hard to disrupt on
an outpatient basis. This is a good question to go over with your eating disor-
der specialist. For some people, trying outpatient therapy first is best. For
others, the wisest course is to go straight to a residential program with
greater structure. Here are a few indicators that you may need a more struc-
tured setting as a first step:
 Your symptoms are deeply entrenched.
 You have a history of relapse.
 You have a history of other treatments that didn’t work out.
 You have companion disorders, especially substance or alcohol abuse
or mood disorders, which have been hard to stabilize with medication.
Halfway houses
Halfway houses or recovery houses are often part of the aftercare programs
provided by residential facilities. These are small, unstructured, live-in situa-
tions, usually with house parents as overseers. You attend some type of
group program, and you also have an individual therapist, perhaps the same
person you saw individually while in the residential program.
You must be medically stable and have the worst of your eating disorder
symptoms behind you to stay in a halfway house. Participation in a halfway
house
 Provides support for practicing the new skills and new ways of thinking
about yourself that you acquired in residential care.
 Helps prevent relapse.
 Provides an immediate community of people who are also in recovery.
 Provides extended support for learning to live in the community again.
142
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Day hospital (partial hospital)
Day hospital programs, also called partial hospital programs, are a step down
from hospital or residential care in structure and frequency. Often a day hos-
pital program is set up as an extension of a hospital program to meet the
needs of patients who are being discharged from a full hospital program. A
day hospital is also appropriate if you need an intensive program but don’t
need the level of medical monitoring a full hospital program provides. If you
enter a day hospital program, you typically attend eight hours a day, four to
seven days a week.
In a day hospital program, you work on reducing your eating disorder symp-
toms and building recovery skills (such as self-esteem and improved emotion
management). You have individualized treatment goals and a plan for achiev-
ing them. The treatment team may recommend individual therapy, family
therapy, and/or medication. You also have several supervised meals each day
so you get the structure you need around food and eating.
Everyone participates in group treatment. Day hospital programs rely on the
therapeutic community of mutual help and support as their main healing ingre-
dient. If you’re coming out of a residential or inpatient program, having this
continued experience of reliable support for your recovery can be extremely
important. Day hospital groups may be educational or problem-solving, focus
on relationship skills within the group, or discuss eating disorder or recovery
topics.
Intensive outpatient program (IOP)
An intensive outpatient program (IOP) is another transitional option if you’re
leaving inpatient hospitalization or residential treatment. If a day hospital
program is one step down in structure and frequency from these intensive
services, an IOP is two steps down. A typical IOP meets for several hours sev-
eral evenings a week, allowing working people or students to resume jobs or
school while still getting an intensive treatment experience.
An IOP can also be a valuable treatment choice if you’re medically stable but
your eating disorder symptoms are stuck, or you’re experiencing a crisis
that’s making your symptoms significantly worse. In these cases, stepping up
your level of treatment from ordinary outpatient care (see the next section)
may be the way to get unstuck or to help you weather your crisis.
IOPs are generally group-based programs. Like residential facilities and day
hospitals, they put their faith in the healing power of a therapeutic community
guided by eating disorder professionals. In the group, you work on managing
eating disorder symptoms and developing a strong recovery. An evening’s
activities are likely to include a supervised meal so you can discover ways to
handle food and eating-related anxieties in a group setting.
143
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

Outpatient therapy
Outpatient therapy is treatment that you participate in while living at home
and going about your life. You can engage in any of the forms of individual
therapy, or family, couple, or group treatment on an outpatient basis. Though
a particular form of treatment you choose may be more or less structured
(you can read about these choices in Chapter 10), your time is pretty much
unsupervised. So outpatient treatment is the least intensive level of treatment
intervention.
You and your therapist may choose to increase or decrease the intensity level
of your outpatient treatment by adding or subtracting sessions from your week.
(Some people do the same thing by making sessions shorter or longer. A typical
individual outpatient psychotherapy session is 45 to 50 minutes.) If you’re just
beginning treatment or going through a crisis period, you and your therapist
may agree, for example, to meet two to three times per week. If your symptom
picture is quite stable, you may do just fine with one session per week. These
decisions are usually influenced by how many other treatments you’re trying
to juggle at the same time and by financial considerations as well.
Outpatient therapists are mainly found in one of two places: in outpatient
clinics and in private practice. In the following sections, I discuss what each
one involves and why you may choose one over the other.
Outpatient clinics
Outpatient clinics are often part of larger institutions, such as hospitals. In
these cases, they may be set up partly to serve the community and partly to
train new staff, who work under the supervision of more experienced clinicians.
Other times, a clinic is government-sponsored to serve a particular neighbor-
hood or population (for example, substance abusers or immigrants).
Outpatient clinics present several advantages. They can be a big advantage
financially. They take most kinds of insurance, including Medicaid, and they
usually operate on a sliding scale that’s quite reasonable. What’s more, if the
clinic is affiliated with a larger institution that’s interested in eating disorders,
you’re likely to get staff members who are up-to-date on the latest in eating
disorder treatment.
To start your search, consider the following types of institutions, which may
focus on eating disorders or have an eating disorder program. Any of them
may also have an eating disorder outpatient clinic:
 Hospitals
 Universities
144
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 Training institutes (programs set up to study eating disorders and train
eating disorder professionals)
 Residential treatment facilities
You can also check for eating disorder specialists among the staff at other
kinds of clinics. For example, if you need a family therapist who knows about
eating disorders, you may check the clinic of a family therapy training insti-
tute or a family training program within a hospital department of psychiatry.
Private practice
Therapists who are in private practice either operate independently or in
group practices with several other people for business purposes. Outpatient
therapy with a private practitioner tends to be more costly than clinic ser-
vices. Insurance covers less and less, though you need to check with your
particular insurer. Many private therapists offer services on a sliding scale,
so it’s always worth checking, even if the original price quote sounds beyond
your means.
The advantages of working with a private practitioner may include the following:
 Privacy: You usually meet in a more private setting than you would in a
clinic. This may or may not matter to you.
 Experience: A private practitioner is usually someone who has been
doing this work for awhile. But you can always check.
 Choice: You can choose who you want to see. In a clinic, you are
assigned a therapist.
 A known entity: Chances are this therapist was recommended to you by
someone who knows her work and thinks highly of it. Or you read about
her and liked what you read.
Be sure to read the section “Finding the Right Therapist” at the beginning of
this chapter for hints on picking a therapist who’s a good fit for you. This
applies even if you’re going to a clinic and have been assigned a therapist.
You have a right to speak up if the match just isn’t working.
Exploring Experiential and 
Alternative Therapies
I emphasize throughout this chapter that eating disorders affect all aspects of
being you. Unconventional treatment approaches often address the nooks
and crannies of eating disorder experience that conventional therapies may
miss. In this section I review the experiential and alternative therapies most
widely used with eating disorders. Nobody’s amassed much research on the
145
Chapter 9: Deciding the Who, What, and Where for Treatment

effectiveness of any of the following out-of-the-mainstream approaches for
eating disorders. Yet individual clients have found one or another of them to
be invaluable additions to their core recovery work.
If any of the experiential or alternative therapies sound about right to you,
talk with your primary therapist about it. The two of you can figure out
whether it’s an appropriate addition to your treatment plan. (Of course, when
you start adding treatments, time and money can always become a consider-
ation.) If you’re getting ready to enter inpatient or residential care, you’ll
probably find at least some of these treatments are options in your program.
Experiential therapies
Experiential therapies aim at increasing your awareness of being in the present
moment. Any technique, tool, or practice that increases present awareness
puts you in stronger connection with yourself. That’s because you have to be
tuned in to yourself and your own sources of knowing — thoughts, feelings,
sensations — in order to be aware. If you have an eating disorder, connecting
to yourself probably hasn’t felt all that rewarding. Experiential therapies may
help you learn to tune in to yourself more comfortably and effectively.
Possibilities include
 Dance/movement therapy: Helps you improve body image and
boundaries, and to express feelings
 Art therapy: Provides safe ways to express feelings
 Music therapy: Provides ways to express yourself, relax, and participate
safely with others

n this chapter you get to meet Julie, who is my fictitious therapy guinea
pig. Julie tries out some of the treatment approaches I describe in this
chapter to give you a feel for what to expect.
The treatment you choose becomes the centerpiece of your recovery efforts.
Yet, unlike shopping for a car or a house, you usually sign on for therapy
without getting to see the product first! By getting a “fly on the wall” view of
Julie’s experiences, you gain a better understanding of what to expect in indi-
vidual therapy.
The “Resource Guide” at the end of this book provides more information on
each of the therapies you meet in this chapter. The guide also tells you how
to locate therapists who use each approach.
If you have anorexia, you won’t be able to participate in therapy effectively in
a state of starvation. A starved brain is in no shape to do the kind of work
therapy requires. Getting the nourishment you need comes first. (Read more
about this stage of treatment for anorexia in Chapter 9.)

148
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 
Choosing Your Eating Disorder Treatment
When you choose a treatment approach, you want to select the one that best
suits your individual needs. You may want to consider each prospective
approach in light of the following questions:
 Is this approach good for my problem?
 Is this approach a good match for who I am?
You’re not likely to find perfect answers to either of these questions. But in
this section I get you started by providing some information that may help
you choose your treatment approach more wisely.
Choosing the best approach
Is one approach to treating eating disorders more effective than another?
That’s a good question, but one for which, unfortunately, no great answer
exists. Not a scientific one, anyway. Not enough research has been done to
enable you to make useful comparisons. However, the discoveries that have
been made through research so far regarding some of the most common ther-
apies include the following:
 Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT shows better results for bulimia
than for anorexia. For more information on CBT, see the section
“Concentrating on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT),” later in this
chapter.
 Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) and CBT: In studies comparing CBT and IPT
for the treatment of binge eating disorder (BED), the two treatments worked
equally well to reduce binge eating as well as companion psychological
symptoms (like depression). See the section “Investigating Interpersonal
Therapy (IPT),” later in this chapter, to find out more about IPT.
 Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT): Researchers have reported
successful use of DBT for binge eating disorder. In one study, treatment
lasted for 20 weeks. At a six month follow-up, seven of ten women
reported no binge eating. The other three reported so few binges that
they no longer qualified for the BED diagnosis.
Be cautious of widespread claims that CBT shows better results than any
other treatment for eating disorders. When you read the fine print, you find
that the only other psychological treatment to which CBT has been com-
pared is IPT. And in those tests, IPT did just as well as CBT. No research has
yet been done comparing CBT with the other treatments you read about in
this chapter. CBT is a fine treatment and it may be the right treatment for
you, but research proving that CBT is better than all other eating disorder
treatments doesn’t exist, no matter what anyone tells you.

Lack of research also plagues trauma treatment (see the section “Taking to
the Trenches with Trauma Treatment” later in this chapter to find out more
about the connection between eating disorders and trauma). CBT and EMDR
are by far the best-studied. The American Psychological Association, reviewing
the research to date, calls both approaches “effective” for treatment of Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Should you throw up your hands for lack of solid research to guide your deci-
sions? Certainly not. Lack of research doesn’t mean lack of experience. Lots
of highly experienced, highly qualified eating disorder specialists out there
have been fine-tuning their thinking about eating disorders for decades, even
if their approaches are not well-researched. Other experienced therapists are
pioneering the application of some of the newer therapies, like EMDR, to
working with eating disorders.
Many, if not most, eating disorder therapists use a variety of treatment styles
in their approach. If a therapist tells you his approach is eclectic, he means
that he uses a combination of techniques to treat eating disorders. Don’t be
surprised, for example, to find that the EMDR therapist you’re seeing talks to
you about mindfulness with your bingeing or asks you to keep a food diary.
Fortunately, most therapists understand that helping you to get better is
what matters most. They don’t mind stealing from each other’s bag of tricks
to help you do so.
Choosing an approach 
that fits who you are
A very important consideration when choosing a treatment approach is finding
one that is not only effective but also suits your personal style. In other words,
you want an approach with which you feel comfortable. As you chew over
the various approaches discussed in this chapter, here are a few things for
you to think about:
 If you’re ready to make a special commitment, you may like CBT, IPT, or
DBT, which require you to do homework assignments every week. The
idea behind this is that the more work you put into therapy, the more
you get out of it.
 If you feel best when you can get to the bottom of things, and you want
to understand how things work and what makes you tick, you may do
best in one of the therapies that explore issues in depth, like psychody-
namic psychotherapy or feminist therapy.
 If you already meditate, do yoga, or use alternative (non-Western) health
approaches, you may find yourself on familiar ground with the bottom-
up therapies.
149
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

 If you tend to rely on logic, you may feel more at home with the purely
logical approach of CBT or the problem-solving focus of IPT.
 If you haven’t worked in your body before (see the section “Body-based
therapies” later in this chapter), you may find that the opportunity
opens up many new possibilities for healing and feeling whole.
 If you have a history of uncontrollable emotions and behavior, especially
in ways that are dangerous to you, you may want to think seriously
about DBT. Addressing such emotions and behavior is DBT’s specialty!
Concentrating on Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is best known for the effective treatment
of depression and anxiety. CBT also has a track record for treating eating dis-
orders that goes back several decades. CBT is a highly structured therapy, so
every session is well-planned. The treatment time is limited, usually to 16 to
20 sessions. A CBT therapist believes that knowing this time limit makes both
of you concentrate and work harder.
CBT is a here-and-now approach. Instead of focusing on historical causes for
your problems, CBT practitioners look for conditions in the present that keep
your eating disorder going and aim to disrupt those conditions. CBT practi-
tioners believe that problems, including eating disorders, are usually maintained
by distorted thinking. Distorted thinking, in turn, leads to troubling emotions and
problematic behaviors.
In the case of eating disorders, CBT zooms in on the typical distorted thought
that your worth is determined by your body size and shape (for example, “If
I’m thin, I’ll like myself better, and so will everyone else”). Related beliefs
involve body image, an obsession with being thin, fat phobia, being in con-
trol, and being perfect. A cognitive-behavioral therapist aims to undermine
these beliefs and help you replace them with more realistic, constructive
ones. CBT assumes that when you undermine the core beliefs, you under-
mine the disorder itself. The behaviors aren’t likely to continue without the
beliefs that fuel them.
In CBT, you’re expected to work from the beginning — with the support of the
therapist and the techniques and information you discover — on gradually
changing behaviors central to the disorder: bingeing, purging, dieting, food
rituals, starving, and compulsive exercise. Overall, CBT for eating disorders
aims at correcting symptomatic behavior and changing problem-causing atti-
tudes about food, eating, and body image.
150
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

What you do in CBT
CBT is based on a few basic principles. The central ingredients of CBT that
you encounter when you start your treatment are
 Getting educated. CBT takes a logical approach, wherein facts comprise
the basis for your choices. You get a lot of up-front information about
how dieting causes bingeing (and therefore purging). You also find out
about the physical consequences of your disorder, the myths of purging
as calorie-wasting, and so forth.
 Discovering how to recognize and correct errors in your thinking and
to replace distorted thoughts with rational ones. CBT is not only logical
but also scientific. Your therapist invites you to treat your beliefs as the-
ories that can be put to the test. If you hold a distorted belief, she helps
you use facts to look at different possible explanations. She may encourage
you to experiment to decide whether your idea holds water or some
other idea works better.
 Finding out about techniques for handling bingeing and purging urges.
Your therapist may recommend relaxation and distraction techniques or
help you substitute other activities for bingeing and purging.
 Developing problem-solving skills. You learn the same logical, fact-based
approach as you use elsewhere in CBT to think about your problems and
devise appropriate solutions for them.
 Doing homework assignments. Your therapist may have you keep a log or
diary for challenging your erroneous thoughts, practice new behaviors, 
or take on previously avoided situations or activities between sessions.
Julie concentrates on CBT
On her first day in treatment, Julie gets a thorough education about the CBT
approach. Education is important because knowledge supplies the reasoning
for everything Julie’s going to be asked to do. A lot of these new behaviors
are scary, so they have to make sense to Julie or she won’t follow through.
She also gets her first homework assignment: She is to keep a thorough daily
food log, including notes about the situation, thoughts, or feelings that
accompany her eating.
Julie’s therapist asks her to immediately begin a normal, predictable eating
pattern: three square meals and two snacks, at regular intervals, every day.
She explains to Julie how deprivation causes bingeing. Julie’s own experiences
back up this theory. Bingeing begins to fall off as Julie’s eating normalizes.
Julie is surprised to see that her therapist reviews her log in great detail at
the beginning of the next session. (She thinks, “Yikes! I’m really going to have
151
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

to follow through. Some of this is embarrassing.”) The careful review of the
food log happens again at the beginning of every session, along with a review
of other homework assignments. These reviews form the basis for much of
the session work: challenging thoughts, finding binge triggers, and discovering
new possibilities.
Julie’s therapist asks her to expand her choices about eating even more. Julie
challenges herself to join her friends for pizza — without vomiting afterward.
Julie’s therapist reminds her of some things she now knows:
 Vomiting encourages future bingeing.
 Eating in a more normal way hasn’t caused her to gain weight so far.
Adding more fat is going to be a stretch. But the therapist also reminds Julie
that forbidden foods become binge foods. Julie decides to experiment to see
how the pizza affects her weight. She also makes a plan to use the restroom
before the food arrives so she’s not tempted to do so afterward, when she
may purge.
The pizza experiment is a success, but Julie flops later when she tries to add
a new “forbidden food.” Julie’s reaction is to think of herself as a loser, and
she and her therapist go over this reaction in her next session. Julie’s thera-
pist acknowledges that Julie’s reaction is one possible conclusion. She then
suggests that Julie look at the facts of her life and her progress in treatment
to see whether this conclusion holds up. Julie realizes that the facts don’t
support her conclusion. Finally, the therapist asks Julie to suggest some con-
clusions that fit the facts better. The one Julie lands on is that she doesn’t
have to do everything perfectly in order to make progress.
Before treatment ends, Julie’s therapist tells her to expect her eating disorder
symptoms to return in times of stress, but also to expect that she’ll keep get-
ting better. She gives her a detailed written outline of how to handle
binge/purge episodes and urges to diet that sums up the work she and her
therapist have already done together.
How CBT helps
CBT puts a lot of valuable experience under your belt. You begin to live with-
out your symptoms and discover that you’re okay. If you have bulimia or BED
you find that your weight doesn’t change significantly, even though you eat
regularly, and you practice sitting through urges to purge without acting on
them. You discover from experience that you can manage your urges and
they will pass. If you have anorexia, you learn to manage urges to restrict and
fears about adding additional foods and gaining weight.
152
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

You also get lots of practice with a method of recognizing and challenging the
irrational thoughts that make you want to purge and diet. You know that
urges will come up in the future, but you work out a process to turn to for
help when they do. The same is true of bingeing: You determine what feelings
and situations trigger you and what to do when binge impulses occur. And
here’s a big bonus: Your therapy successes provide you with some much-
needed self-esteem and confidence.
Delving into Dialectical Behavioral
Therapy (DBT)
Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), developed by University of Washington
therapist Marsha Linehan, combines CBT (see the preceding section,
“Concentrating on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy”) with Eastern mindfulness
techniques. Linehan made a name for DBT by using it successfully with seri-
ously impulsive and suicidal patients no one else had been able to help. DBT
has since been adapted for work with substance abuse, eating disorders, and
other problems.
DBT emphasizes a balance between acceptance and change. Acceptance doesn’t
mean throwing in the towel; rather, it means accepting who you are and what
your circumstances are at the current moment (as opposed to concluding,
“I’m disgusting” or “I hate myself”). In DBT, you discover ways to nurture this
accepting stance while simultaneously working on making changes.
DBT practitioners assume that your eating disorder symptoms — dieting,
starving, binging, purging — are misguided attempts at emotion management.
The focus of DBT work is on finding ways to handle emotions constructively
through a balance of acceptance and change.
What you do in DBT
If you sign up for DBT, you may have an individual therapist, be part of a DBT
group, or both. (Some people who are in other kinds of therapy for individual
work also participate in DBT groups.) DBT is a short-term therapy, usually
lasting for about 20 sessions.
In DBT you receive skills training for emotion management. You’re expected
to carry out homework assignments in which you apply these skills to your
particular situation. You practice applying emotion management techniques
when you feel the urge to engage in an eating disorder behavior, such as
bingeing or purging. You also practice applying your new skills to situations
that trigger your eating disorder behaviors, such as a fight with a friend or
being criticized by your boss.
153
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

DBT teaches you four core sets of skills:
 Mindfulness: Drawn from meditation, these skills teach you to be aware —
without judgment — of what is occurring in the present moment, both
inside of you and on the outside.
 Distress tolerance: These skills involve accepting yourself and your life
as they are right now and being able to observe without trying to control
or change things. As a result, you gain a new tolerance of painful emotions.
 Emotion regulation: You find out how to use mindfulness skills to help
you identify and be present with disturbing emotions. You also discover
ways to cope with negative emotions, such as listening to music, talking
with friends, writing in a journal, practicing slow breathing, and so on.
You find out how to make better choices with regard to emotion-driven
behavior.
 Interpersonal effectiveness: This set of skills teaches you how to get
more of what you want from relationships — without hurting the rela-
tionship or your good image of yourself in the process. Skills include
asking for what you want, being able to say no, and managing conflict.
Julie joins a DBT group
Julie joins a DBT group that’s specifically for people with eating disorders.
Five other women are in her group. One has bulimia, like Julie. The other four
have binge eating disorder. Two also abuse substances. One self-injures by
cutting herself.
Here is the usual drill for Julie’s DBT group sessions. After any personal shar-
ing at the beginning, each group member tells how she did with the week’s
homework. A particular week’s assignment always involves one of the core
mindfulness skills. Members talk about any problems they had with the
homework. They also review diary cards on which they’ve recorded the DBT
skills they practiced each day. Then they learn a new skill and practice it with
each other. The next homework assignment is based on that skill. Before
ending the session, the group does some kind of mindfulness or relaxation
exercise together.
This week the group is going over an assignment to work on distress tolerance
skills. The assignment was to pick a distressing situation and list the pros and
cons of tolerating the distress versus bingeing (or engaging in another destructive
behavior). Julie thought the assignment would be easy — until a fight on the
phone with her mother ended with her mother hanging up on her and refusing
to take her calls all week. Julie could think of no pros for tolerating what she
was feeling. She binged and purged several times.
154
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Julie is relieved to find that the group doesn’t judge her, either for bingeing
and purging or for having trouble completing the assignment. The group’s tol-
erance serves as a reminder to her to practice being less judgmental and
instead to become more curious about her behavior — “I wonder what was
going on for me that led to that binge?” Julie laughs at a suggestion for her
“pro” list (why to tolerate the situation): five full days of not having to hear
her mom’s criticisms! Group members also help Julie rehearse conflict resolution
skills they’ve been working on, as well as distraction and self-soothing tech-
niques in case she just can’t make the situation with her mom right.
How DBT helps
DBT teaches you how to stay in awareness of the emotional states that trigger
your eating disorder behaviors without acting on them. You also learn tech-
niques for reducing intense negative emotions. Being less at the mercy of your
emotions allows you to think more clearly and make good choices about the
way you respond to situations and people — choices that don’t involve eating
or restricting. With time and practice, DBT training helps you improve your
eating disorder symptoms and strengthens your approach to life in general.
Setting Your Sights on Psychodynamic
Therapy
Get ready for a whole truckload of psychodynamic therapies. All of these
therapies start with the belief that symptoms in the present represent emotional
baggage from the past. Getting better in psychodynamic therapy involves
unpacking the baggage and resolving old issues in a constructive way that
doesn’t include your symptoms. The relationship with your therapist is crucial
because the assumption is that sooner or later all the key issues causing you
trouble will come up in the ways you relate to her.
The following approaches constitute a small sampler of the different psycho-
dynamic approaches in use (including a few that are more accurately called
psychoanalytic approaches):
 Freudian analysis — the original approach: Freudian analysis encom-
passes everything you probably imagine therapy to be, including the
couch and the therapist who doesn’t say much. Freudian analysis supposes
symptoms arise from unacceptable, unconscious sexual or aggressive
impulses and that you can develop some pretty maladaptive patterns in
life trying to keep these impulses out of awareness.
155
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

 Object relations therapy: This approach assumes you unconsciously
take in the qualities of your early caregivers and the ways they relate to
you, and that this, in turn, affects your future ability to trust, be intimate,
be independent, and so on. You tend to repeat the patterns that you see
in your early relationships in your adult relationships. In object relations
therapy, you use the relationship with the therapist to become aware of
what you took in and develop new patterns when the old ones aren’t
useful.
 Self psychology: Self psychologists think you are as entitled as the next
guy to possess key abilities of a healthy adult personality, such as the
ability to feel “together,” to feel alive, to self-soothe, and to keep up your
self-esteem. Normally these abilities develop in the relationship with a
caregiver who is sensitive to a child’s needs. Self psychological therapy
offers a second chance at developing these abilities if you didn’t get
them in childhood.
 Jungian therapy: The idea behind Jungian therapy is to help you heal what
hurts, to become more of who you are able to be, and to find personal
meaning in your life. Jungians believe that in order to accomplish these
goals you need to know what’s going on in your unconscious and be able
to read the symbolic messages, such as dreams, that it sends you.
156
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 
Distinguishing between psychodynamic 
and psychoanalytic therapies
Psychodynamic and psychoanalytic approaches
share the same theoretical beliefs about how
psychological problems arise; that is, they are
the result of unconscious conflicts. The main dif-
ference between the two approaches is in
method. In psychoanalysis you are asked to
commit to more frequent therapy (perhaps three
to five times per week compared to one to two
times per week in a psychodynamic therapy) and
probably a longer time in treatment overall —
several years or longer. Psychoanalytic treat-
ment is more open-ended in the way it explores
your feelings. This is best exemplified by the
process of free association in which you talk
about whatever comes to your mind. (Lying on
the infamous couch is believed to help this
process.) Psychoanalytic goals are also more
general, aiming at personality transformation. In
contrast, a psychodynamic therapist is likely to
direct you to specific topics to explore (aspects
of your childhood, your relationships, and so on)
and to be focused on particular problems, such
as anxiety or depression.

Psychodynamic psychotherapists have contributed most of what is known about
the inner world of eating disorders. They’ve figured out how eating disorders
subconsciously provide a way to work on problems that feel too threatening
to work on directly or consciously. Food, weight, dieting, bingeing, and purging
express issues like needing to be taken care of, needing others, needing more
independence, being angry, feeling powerless, and so on. Therapy provides a
safe environment for bringing these issues out into daylight. The idea is that
you won’t need your symptoms when you deal with the issues more openly.
What you do in psychodynamic therapy
Psychodynamic therapy is not a structured therapy like CBT (see the section
“Concentrating on Cognitive-Based Therapy,” earlier in this chapter).
Sessions aren’t planned, homework isn’t assigned, and the therapy usually
isn’t time-limited. Treatment starts with your therapist finding out what you
want from therapy and taking a thorough history. Your therapist then dis-
cusses her general ideas about your symptoms. Your part of the work of ther-
apy is to bring your experiences — your current concerns, past memories,
and impressions of what’s happening in the therapy — to your sessions. Your
therapist may direct you to certain parts of your history, ask for your ideas
or feelings about significant issues, ask how you feel about the relationship
between the two of you, or present her own ideas and impressions regarding
your treatment.
Julie sets her sights on psychodynamic
psychotherapy
Julie chooses a therapist whose combination method includes object
relations, an approach that emphasizes the effects of early relationships. The
therapist expresses interest not only in what Julie is doing — bingeing, purg-
ing, dieting, and so forth — but also in what Julie feels emotionally both when
she engages in these behaviors and when she refrains from doing so. For
example, Julie notices that when she tries not to binge, she experiences terri-
ble emptiness. Her therapist asks her when she has felt that kind of empti-
ness before. Julie is right back in the great empty space between her and her
chronically depressed mother. (Her dad abandoned them when she was born.)
A lot of Julie’s therapy sessions are devoted to remembering how she coped
as a little girl with such a distant, barely functioning mom. Julie realizes how
early she had to grow up. Gradually she and her therapist piece together how
her eating disorder symptoms came to the rescue when adolescence flooded
her with issues of separation she was unprepared to handle. Dieting sug-
gested to her that she was so strong she didn’t really need other people. It
also felt like she was taking the deprivation inside herself, where she could
157
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

be in charge of it. Bingeing sometimes soothed her, but just as often it just
made her numb. Purging restored some temporary order, but made her feel
terrible.
Within the safety of the therapy relationship, Julie begins to understand how
focusing on her symptoms seemed to keep her together during her teens
when she so often felt she could fall apart. For the first time, she realizes just
how terrifying it was to be expected to grow up when there was nobody there
to rely on. Probably the hardest part of her therapy is feeling she needs her
therapist. For awhile her symptoms get worse as her desire to finally have
someone she can depend on increases. She finds unexpected relief in putting
her needs into words and discovering that her neediness doesn’t flood her or
make her therapist run away!
Getting better for Julie in this therapy is a matter of shifting the trust she
placed in food and dieting back into the world of other people. Julie had to
skip many steps of normal development because of the unusual circum-
stances of her childhood, especially having a mom who always seemed to
need more than she did. Now she can stop and take the steps she missed.
She can become a fully functioning adult — she no longer has to fake it while
turning to eating disorder symptoms for cover. In her psychodynamic ther-
apy, Julie is able to discover who she is so she doesn’t have to define herself
with her symptoms anymore.
How psychodynamic psychotherapy helps
In psychodynamic therapy, you gradually build your strength from the inside
out. Your therapist uses a careful read of the “hot spots” in your development
to interact in ways that give you the growth experiences you need. A therapist
who specializes in psychodynamic psychotherapy and has experience in treating
eating disorders understands how eating disorder symptoms reflect missing
or harmful developmental experiences. This understanding helps her offer you
chances to heal and grow so that your symptoms are no longer necessary.
Focusing on Feminist Therapy
Many feminist therapies for eating disorders are based on psychodynamic
principles. But feminist therapists also have some basic beliefs about gender
and culture that make therapy with them different. Here are some of the
differences you find with a feminist therapist:
 A belief that men and women develop differently and view the world
differently. A man’s world is one in which others are viewed in terms of
power and competition. A woman’s world is more about relationships
and connections to others.
158
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 A therapy conversation that looks at the impact of the culture.
Depending on who you are and what you need, you’re likely to cover
issues like the following:
• Cultural pressures for women to be thin
• Objectification of women’s bodies, meaning that they are treated by
others as something separate from the person living inside —
something that can be judged, criticized, ogled, or admired like an
inanimate object
• Expectations that good women contain and control their needs
and appetites rather than express them
• Expectations that feminine women are compliant and accommodating
• Cultural valuing of qualities in girls and women that aren’t generally
useful for developing personal identity or power
• Family power arrangements that often mirror the culture, to the
disadvantage of girls and women
 A collaborative therapy relationship that will be central to healing. In
a relationship of this type, the following ideas are considered important:
• Connection and attachment are crucial for growth. Traditional
psychodynamic views of development have emphasized separation
from the parents and autonomy as signs of maturity. Feminist
approaches believe that the ability to form healthy connections to
others, including intimate attachments, is just as important to growth
and maturity. This includes qualities of support, understanding, and
mutual respect in relationships we rely on.
• The relationship is a partnership between equals. Both you and
the therapist have a share of the expertise instead of the therapist
being viewed as having all the knowledge and expertise.
From a feminist point of view, a therapy that controls and contains symptoms
under the therapist’s direction runs the risk of repeating the errors of the
culture and the family. Culture dictates that women are to be silenced and
contained. The feminist therapist prefers to see your symptoms get better 
as part of a process in which you are encouraged to become a whole person
with your own voice validated.
Like the traditional psychodynamic therapist, the feminist therapist sees
eating disorder symptoms as an expression of a person who has lost faith in
relationships with other people. If you have an eating disorder, you probably
don’t see relationships as a reliable place to get nurturing. You may not think
you can get nurturing without losing yourself. And you probably don’t
believe you can be your own separate you without losing important relation-
ships. Why even bother? Food isn’t so picky about how you act. A feminist
therapist understands where you’re coming from. She knows that the journey
to change is difficult and frightening, and that she will have to be in there
with you in a real way for change to happen and for you to get better.
159
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

What you do in feminist therapy
In feminist therapy you and your therapist talk about your life and try to
make sense of how your eating disorder became a part of it. The relationship
between the two of you is part of the focus of your treatment and part of the
healing process.
So far, I could be describing a psychodynamic therapy. Your feminist thera-
pist may very well have a psychodynamic background. What she adds as a
feminist therapist is an understanding of how being female (or male) in this
culture contributes to your eating disorder symptoms as well as your more
basic view of yourself. She is certain to ask you to challenge beliefs about
yourself and your possibilities that are based on limiting gender stereotypes.
For example, saying no when you need to may be hard for you because you
were taught that a good woman doesn’t get into conflicts with others. Or you
may binge and purge whenever you get angry because you were taught that
nice girls don’t get angry. You may find it hard to even think about who you are
because you’ve been so well-trained to focus on others. Your eating disorder
may have been filling in this identity gap. In feminist therapy, you see clearly
how the culture has been rewarding you for being so selfless while at the
same time making it hard for you to become the mature, self-directed adult
you’re expected to be.
Julie focuses on feminist therapy
Julie picks a feminist therapist. The emphasis on women’s issues and on rela-
tionships feels important to her. But the relationship emphasis also scares her.
She’s been getting along in the world by being nice to everyone and avoiding
conflicts. She’s noticed that her actions never result in her feeling very con-
nected to anyone, or even very alive. Is it possible to feel differently? Choosing
a therapist who’s asking the same question is an act of courage for Julie.
160
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 
Feminist therapy isn’t just for females
Can a man go to a feminist therapist? Sure!
Feminist therapy isn’t all about women being
oppressed. A feminist therapist is interested in
all the ways culturally dictated gender roles
shape and limit your ability to define yourself, no
matter what your gender. And the model of
growth-in-attachment applies equally well to
men. Men are often relieved to hear the mes-
sages of feminist therapy in contrast to the John
Wayne, go-it-alone stuff the culture insists on
for them.

Julie has to call on her courage many times in her therapy as she tries to be
honest and open with her therapist. Her internal map of relationships tells
her that openness is going to get her clobbered. She thinks her therapist will
see her as one big needy monster and will be horrified, swamped, or disgusted.
One of the first times Julie’s neediness comes up is when her therapist is away
for the holidays. Julie taught herself a long time ago not to need people who
aren’t there for her, so she’s upset with herself for needing her therapist now.
She can’t help but feel angry at her therapist for putting her in this position. It
makes her feel weak and vulnerable. When she sees her therapist again, Julie
tells her she thinks she should quit therapy because she’s becoming too
dependent.
In this session and others to follow, Julie and her therapist talk about the
unique circumstances of her life that have made needing and separation feel
so threatening. They also talk about the added problem of living in a culture
that thinks of needing and connecting as weak. For the first time in her life,
Julie begins to see her ability to need and connect as a strength. She can talk
through the overwhelming parts — they don’t get the better of her or her
therapist. And in time, they don’t feel so overwhelming.
Julie knew before she started feminist therapy how strongly the media influ-
enced her desires to be thin. Her refrigerator was plastered with pictures of
models and celebrities who were up there to inspire her to stay on her diet.
She is surprised to find out how many other ways the culture affects her and
how cultural stereotypes keep her eating disorder going. For example, she
feels frightened any time she doesn’t act the way the feminine “good girl” is
supposed to, and this feeling triggers urges to binge and purge. She experiences
this scenario when she contradicts a guy she works with. Her therapy reminds
her that she’s entitled to have a voice and to begin to create her own definition
of what makes a good woman.
How feminist therapy helps
When you’re able to see clearly what the culture is prescribing and the effect
its prescriptions are having on you, you have a better chance to weed out the
parts that aren’t good for you. A feminist therapy will offer you the perspective
and support for thinking through the culture’s impact on your eating disorder
symptoms and on your life more generally. A feminist therapist helps you
develop personal strength and a sense of identity so you have less need for
your symptoms.
Feminists believe you are most likely to develop a strong individual self when
attachment and connection are also part of the picture. You don’t have to
worry that you can have one only at the expense of the other. Feminist therapy
161
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

is a place to test this theory and experiment with new possibilities with
someone who understands what’s at stake. In the process, you leave the 
need to rely on your eating disorder symptoms behind.
Investigating Interpersonal 
Therapy (IPT)
Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is another short-term treatment for eating disorders.
Like feminist and some psychodynamic models (see the preceding sections,
“Focusing on Feminist Therapy” and “Setting Your Sights on Psychodynamic
Therapy”), IPT places its main emphasis on relationships. Unlike these two
approaches, however, IPT doesn’t try to find reasons for the development of
your disorder in your history. In fact, IPT doesn’t try to explain the development
of your eating disorder at all. Instead, like CBT (see the section “Concentrating
on Cognitive-Based Therapy,” earlier in this chapter), IPT looks for current fac-
tors that are keeping your symptoms going and tries to help you change them.
IPT therapists believe that psychological problems occur when people’s needs
for attachment and connection aren’t being met. Therefore, they put all their
eggs in that basket for your 12–20 sessions of therapy. Your IPT therapist will
pay little-to-no attention to your eating disorder symptoms, at least not as a
focus for work. The aim of the therapy is to figure out how you can change
what you’re doing in your relationships so you get more of what you need from
them. The assumption is that as you improve your relationships, your symptoms
get better accordingly.
What you do in IPT
In the first few sessions, you and your IPT therapist draw up a list of your 
most important relationships. You then go over these relationships, check-
ing them against four categories of potential interpersonal problems. These
categories are
 Interpersonal disputes: Conflicts you may be having that don’t seem to
get resolved are interpersonal disputes.
 Role transitions: Changes in relationships which may be due to develop-
ment, aging, job loss, breakups, and the like constitute role transitions.
 Grief: From the IPT therapist’s point of view, grief refers only to loss
through death.
 Interpersonal deficits: These deficits occur when you have too few
relationships and/or the ones you have aren’t very fulfilling.
162
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Your therapist helps you use this review to size up what you need to work on.
He also uses his observations of interactions between the two of you to help
identify relationship snags. The two of you then spend most of your remaining
sessions working on ways for you to improve things.
In general, your IPT therapist tries to help you improve your ability to com-
municate in relationships, express emotions, adjust your expectations where
appropriate, problem-solve, and increase your overall set of relationship
skills and options. He helps you come up with your own solutions in specific
situations and put them into practice.
Julie investigates IPT
Julie decides the IPT combination of a relationship focus with a short-term
model is just right for her. She and her therapist identify the following areas
Julie needs to work on:
 Julie experiences her friendships as one-sided. Everyone seems to lean
on her and confide in her, but nobody expresses interest in Julie or her
problems.
 Julie’s relationship with her mother is a little formal and stiff. Julie is
afraid to “rock the boat,” even though her mother’s depression has been
stabilized through medication for some years.
 Julie never got to grieve the relationship with her grandfather who died
when she was eight. Though living in the next town, he was a reliable
source of affection and the one person who let Julie be a little girl.
 Julie can’t figure out what went wrong with her last boyfriend.
Despite the fact that she always tried to be supportive and there for him,
he broke things off because he said she was too needy. The breakup left
Julie feeling confused, betrayed, and afraid to try again.
Julie’s therapist helps her become aware of a pattern that threads through all
her relationships: She is behaving selflessly in the hope that others will
notice and repay her in kind. That way, she won’t have to ask for what she
wants and needs, something she finds excruciating. Julie admits this arrange-
ment hasn’t exactly been working out so well for her. She agrees with her
therapist that the strategy leaves her needs to the imagination of others and
is disempowering.
Julie begins practicing speaking up with her friends, first about minor issues —
where to have dinner, what movie to see — and later about meatier issues —
hurt feelings, her desire to spend time talking about her problems, and so on.
Julie and her therapist role-play these situations so Julie can try out her
approaches ahead of time and anticipate possible problems.
163
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

The situation with her mom is more complicated (surprise!) because it
involves finding out if her mom can or will behave any differently toward her.
Julie also has to confront how angry she’s been at her mother (how can you
be angry at a poor depressed woman?). Julie realizes she’s been afraid her
anger will come out if she starts asking that the relationship include her needs
as well as her mom’s. Through some well-rehearsed efforts to speak up more
and talk about how their current pattern is affecting her, Julie discovers that,
within limits, her mom can be more responsive.
Julie spends several sessions allowing herself to mourn the loss of her grand-
father. Though she may not be able to put all her feelings into words, having
another person (the therapist) witness and accept her profound emotions
gives Julie a new sense of the possibilities for human connection.
In the last few sessions, Julie and her therapist go over what she’s accom-
plished. They try to anticipate how these issues may come up in the future
and how Julie may deal with such circumstances.
How IPT helps
The truth is that nobody exactly knows why IPT helps with eating disorder
symptoms. Practitioners believe that helping people experience some suc-
cess in identifying their relationship needs and getting them met a little more
often has a big impact on eating disorder symptoms.
Getting to the Bottom of 
“Bottom-Up” Therapies
If the name of this category makes you picture yourself turning cartwheels,
think of that as what you’ll be doing in recovery when you’re better. In the
meantime, the name bottom-up contrasts the approaches of some newer ther-
apies with more traditional therapies which are considered to be top-down in
their approach. In a top-down therapy, you use your logical mind to impose
some law and order on disorderly internal processes and behaviors. When
you learn and practice skills, apply insights, or make logical choices, you are
working from the top — your logical mind — down.
When you work from the bottom up, you go straight to where feelings,
impulses, and urges live — right in the gut — to change how you feel from the
inside. Clients who experience bottom-up therapy claim the changes feel
more solid and believable and seem more long-lasting.
164
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

How a bottom-up therapy helps
Bottom-up therapies can be especially useful for working on eating disorders.
Several reasons exist for this, including the following:
 Breaking through despair: By the time you reach treatment you are
probably pretty worn down from battling your symptoms. You’ve
exhausted your own efforts and find it hard to believe that anything will
make things better. A treatment that works from a different angle or
produces a little “magic” may be just the right prescription for injecting
some hope.
 Working in the body makes particular sense: If you have an eating
disorder, you’ve already chosen your body as the arena for working out
what’s wrong. Becoming more comfortable from the inside out seems
like just the right recipe!
 Making up for what’s been missing: If you have an eating disorder,
“what’s wrong” probably includes a lot of missing pieces in your rela-
tionships with caregivers. In several of the bottom-up therapies you
work on developing resources in yourself related to these missing pieces.
 Healing what’s been hurting: When you heal old injuries, you no longer
need your eating disorder symptoms to pull you out of awareness.
Many developing therapies may fit the bottom-up description, but only a few
have gained any broad-based acceptance and/or have been adapted for
eating disorders. These include body-based therapies, EMDR, and the energy
therapies.
Body-based therapies
Perhaps you’re thinking, “Body-based therapy. Hmm. She must mean something
like massage or acupuncture.” Nope. Not that I think these body treatments
can’t be terrific. They can. But here I use the term to refer to a group of therapies
that take into account the continuous loop of influence between your mind
and your body. A body-based therapy taps into this back-and-forth connection
between mind and body to help facilitate healing.
You already know something about this mind-body connection. You caught a
cold because you were under so much stress. The fight with your friend gave
you that headache. Your stomach has been in knots ever since your teacher
announced the exam on Friday. Each of these examples demonstrates a
common way emotion can translate to body symptoms.
Emotions don’t always turn into physical symptoms, but they do always reg-
ister someplace inside you as a body sensation. Perhaps you feel a slight
pressure in your chest when you’re nervous. Or maybe your mouth and
165
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

throat feel like you just ate your gym socks. Maybe when you know you’ve
aced something, you feel your spine lengthening or your body temperature
warming up a little.
Generally speaking, your body knows how you feel before your conscious
mind does! Tuning in to this channel of information can be a great addition to
self-awareness. Not only that, once you’ve tuned in, you can learn to influence
how your body feels in the present — which in turn influences how you feel
emotionally.
The best-known and developed of the body-based therapies are Somatic
Experiencing (SE) and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy (SP). In each approach
you find out how to track your body’s responses to experiences in the
moment and to events from the past that continue to upset you. Using skills
your therapist helps you develop, you’re able to quiet down nervous system
arousal (see the sidebar “Addressing your autonomic nervous system”) and
experience once-upsetting events in a calmer and more confident way. You
may also discover how to develop body states that aren’t so familiar to you
but can be useful, such as assertiveness or relaxation.
Somatic Experiencing is based on the fact that when your physical or psycho-
logical survival is threatened, an instinctive part of your brain throws you
into survival mode and chooses one of three paths to safety: “fight” (stand
and defend yourself), “flight” (run away!) or “freeze” (play dead). In childhood,
neither fight nor flight is a realistic option if an adult, especially a parent, is
the one threatening you. What’s left? Freeze. Though it’s a state of numbness
and immobility, the freeze state is still super-charged with HUGE survival
energy. When survival energy hangs around in your body, it’s constantly warn-
ing your brain that something bad is about to happen, so your brain is con-
stantly telling your body to brace and get ready. The aim of SE is to help your
body safely discharge all that stored-up survival energy and restore you to a
normal energy balance. This reduces your symptoms and helps you connect
more fully to a world that until now has felt too dangerous.
What do body-based therapies have to do with your eating disorder? That
depends partly on the approach you choose and the outlook of your therapist.
Following are some important ways a body-based therapy can help you with
eating disorder symptoms:
 Emotion regulation: Body-based therapies teach you skills for managing
your emotions from the bottom up. When you change what’s happening
in your nervous system, your feelings follow.
 Management of binge or restriction urges: When you’re able to quiet the
nervous system arousal that’s underlying an urge, the urge tends to fizzle.
 Processing early experiences that are “feeding” your eating disorder
in the present: When you’re able to quiet the nervous system arousal
that goes with early wounding, you’re able to transform the way you
166
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

hold that experience inside and the way it affects you. Childhood
experiences that had an impact on your self-esteem, body image, sense
of security with other people, acceptance of making mistakes, and so on
may all be relevant to your eating disorder in the present.
EMDR therapy
EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing. Don’t let
the name scare you. The approach puts things in information-processing
terms, much like your computer does when you work with it. The processor is
your brain and the information your brain processes is stuff that happens to
you in life that you gain new knowledge from. Some of what you discover is
useful — you want to keep calling on it to guide you in the future. For exam-
ple, you may feel confident meeting people because you’ve found from expe-
rience that people really like to be your friend.
EMDR therapists believe that your brain has a mechanism that can process
experience effectively. But this mechanism can get jammed up when experience
overwhelms it — like the way your paper shredder gets jammed when you put
too many sheets in it at once. EMDR specialists think this is what happens when
you experience trauma or even smaller events that are just too much to handle
at the time they occur.
167
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You
Addressing your autonomic nervous system
Body-based therapies work by affecting your
autonomic nervous system (ANS). Your ANS
controls automatic functions in your body —
things like heartbeat, breathing, and digestion
that you don’t have to think about every day. The
ANS is also in charge of the flow of body
energy, meaning it can speed us up or slow us
down.
One ANS branch, the sympathetic branch, is an
arousing or energy-spending branch. Among
other things, your sympathetic nervous system
controls your reaction to threat. It sends adren-
aline and other hormones into your system
when you feel threatened. (Feeling threatened
can refer to big things like getting mugged or
day-to-day things like having somebody look at
you the wrong way.) You may know this reaction
as the “fight or flight response.” You may also
know it as sweaty palms; rapid, shallow breath-
ing; and your heart speeding up a little or a lot.
A second ANS branch, the parasympathetic
nervous system, quiets arousal. Unlike the
energy-inducing sympathetic branch, the
parasympathetic branch is the “rest and digest”
branch. You experience parasympathetic activ-
ity as calm and relaxation.
You may be guessing right now that it would be
a good thing to be able to control the switches
of your nervous system’s ability to rev you up or
slow you down. Controlling these switches is
not only a good thing, but also something you
can actually discover how to do. Body-based
therapists teach you how.

EMDR therapists believe that their approach un-jams this jammed-up system
so that your brain’s own natural ability to process experiences can take over
again. In the process, the old stuff gets linked up with newer, more helpful
information. When experiences that have been badly stored are reprocessed
with the help of EMDR, symptoms are relieved and you gain a perspective of
yourself that’s based on more grown-up information.
An unusual aspect of EMDR is the use of eye movements to un-jam the pro-
cessing system and jumpstart the linking-up of different networks of information
in your brain. Eye movements (yours) are what happen when the therapist holds
up a couple of fingers in front of your face and then moves them from left to
right and back again repeatedly while you follow with your eyes. (Actually other
techniques are also used to create the same effect, for example, using sound
instead of sight.) Nobody knows precisely what this focus is contributing, apart
from allowing you to keep one foot safely in the present when working with
disturbing memories. What EMDR therapists do know is that when they put all
these pieces together — with appropriate precautions for emotional safety —
those badly stored memories tend to fade in intensity while the person
undergoing treatment relates more and more strongly to more current, 
useful information about herself.
The basic outline of how EMDR can be applied to work on your eating disor-
der is quite similar to that for a body-based therapy. You are likely to do a lot
of work up-front on developing emotion management skills. These skills do
double-duty: They help you cope in the present in ways that don’t involve
your eating disorder symptoms, and they help prepare you for reprocessing
difficult memories later in the therapy.
Anything that stirs up powerful negative emotions (and sometimes even positive
emotions) can trigger your eating disorder symptoms. Your therapy can be
such a trigger! You and your therapist need to be mindful of this possibility
and take it into account in the way you work. You may decide to do this by
 Simply acknowledging and talking about what’s happening
 Slowing the pace of work temporarily
 Remembering and practicing emotion management or self-care skills
that you’ve found helpful
The important thing to remember is that now you have options. You don’t have
to be stuck just feeling worse and worse the way you did earlier in your life.
Energy therapies
Energy therapies combine Western ideas of psychology with Eastern beliefs
about body energy fields to create a rapid method of healing. An energy therapist
tells you that symptoms — negative thoughts and emotions — represent
168
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

patterns of imbalance in the energy meridians or channels that run through
the body. These are the same meridians an acupuncturist taps into when he
uses needles to treat you. In an energy therapy, you learn a quick method of
tapping at various meridian points with your fingers. That’s right; this is a do-
it-yourself treatment method. The tapping is said to rebalance body energy,
which in turn alters the way the brain processes information in relation to
the problem you’re working on, helping to resolve and heal the problem.
The first of the energy therapies to become well-known is Thought Field Therapy
(TFT). A TFT practitioner uses information about the thought field connected to
your symptom — that is, the thoughts, emotions, and body sensations you asso-
ciate with it — to make a diagnosis and decide on the pattern of tapping that you
need to do to get relief. Sometimes symptoms, like long-time phobias, disappear
with breathtaking speed. Other times you have to do a lot of tapping to get
results.
A TFT therapist treats anorexia as a phobia. A phobia is a morbid fear of
something. In the case of anorexia, the fear is of eating and thus gaining
weight. He applies a phobia protocol. He thinks of bulimia and BED as addic-
tions. He assumes the addiction is fed by anxiety. He believes the person with
bulimia or BED is actually addicted to the anxiety-calming effects of eating.
The problems with TFT are that it’s expensive to learn and complicated to
do. Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) is a streamlined alternative. As in
TFT, the EFT practitioner believes you need to restore your body energy
fields to balance in relation to a problem that has unbalanced them. Also like
TFT, you tap on meridian points in a certain way while thinking about your
problem to create the rebalancing. Unlike TFT, you don’t need a specific
diagnosis of each problem to determine the correct pattern of tapping. There’s
just one pattern, and it’s much less complicated than the TFT patterns. The
EFT approach addresses eating disorders in the short term by calming urges to
perform eating disorder behaviors (eating too little, bingeing, purging) and in
the long term by quieting underlying emotional disturbances (such as anxiety,
self-doubt, anger, and so on) — all with the same repeated pattern of tapping.
Taking to the Trenches 
with Trauma Treatment
Trauma refers to any experience that overwhelms your ability to cope at the
time it occurs. A traumatic experience threatens your very survival, terrifies
you, and leaves you feeling helpless. Trauma ruptures your sense of a safe
boundary between yourself and the world.
If you have an eating disorder, particularly if you are bulimic, chances are good
that you’ve experienced trauma in your history. You can read more about
trauma’s effects on the development of eating disorders in Chapter 5. If trauma
169
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

is part of your history, your recovery may be significantly strengthened by
undertaking specific treatment to heal lingering trauma effects in your life. The
individual therapist you choose may or may not be equipped to do that work
with you. You may wish to take this into account when choosing an individual
therapist. At the end of this section I list some approaches for treating trauma.
When you are unable to bounce back from the effects of trauma with the help
of family, friends, community, and time, you suffer from what’s called Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). If you have PTSD, it severely disrupts your
life. Its symptoms can include nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, numbing,
depression, irritability, body aches and pains, a sense of loss of meaning in
life, and more. PTSD requires treatment. (You can read more about PTSD and its
treatment in PTSD For Dummies by Mark Goulston [Wiley].)
All trauma is strikingly similar in some respects. However, experiencing a one-
time traumatic event as a stable adult (for example, being the victim of a
crime or a car accident, or losing someone unexpectedly) is very different
from experiencing chronic trauma as a child. The most important difference is
that an adult has many more resources to call on than a child. Adults have
more internal psychological resources, such as judgment, perspective, and
the ability to self-soothe, as well as external resources, such as family, friends,
a stable work environment, and so forth.
Children have not developed these buffering resources. What’s more, in child-
hood, the caregiver who is supposed to provide the buffering is often the source
of the trauma. The chronically traumatized child feels very deeply that she is a
powerless person in an unsafe world where overwhelming experiences can and
do happen on a regular basis.
If you experienced chronic trauma in your childhood, you are likely to have a
symptom picture that includes the following:
 PTSD: A pattern of symptoms that include both memories or sensations
of the trauma and various kinds of shutting down to distance yourself
from it.
 Dissociation: An effect of trauma that leaves you less connected to yourself
and to life. You can read more about dissociation in Chapter 5.
 A persistent pattern of interacting with yourself and the world: This
pattern may include impulsive behavior, difficulty tolerating emotions,
problems getting along with or trusting others, and low self-esteem.
If you have a trauma history, your eating disorder probably represents your
attempt to cope with it. Too much is coming at you and you’ve been unable
to develop the resources you need to manage. Your treatment needs to take
into account not only your eating disorder but also the trauma that fuels it.
170
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

What is trauma treatment?
Treatment for a single-event adult trauma aims at restoration. You want to get
back, or restore, your sense of safety, and the reassurance of having solid
boundaries and meaning in the world that you had before the traumatic event
occurred. (Of course, if triumphing over the trauma leaves you feeling even
stronger than before, that’s okay too!)
If you’ve been traumatized, the most natural instinct is to avoid thinking
about what happened. Yet getting better usually requires confronting the
traumatic experience head-on. The trick is to face the trauma in a way that
doesn’t overwhelm you all over again. The idea is for you to be able to “digest”
an experience that was too much when it happened. That way the trauma can
take its place among other things that have happened in your life — and you
can move on.
In contrast to the restorative, getting-back-to-where-you-were-before work of
single-event adult trauma, treatment for chronic childhood trauma usually
means building in what was never there to start with. Before you can even
think of taking on the overwhelming events of the trauma itself, you need the
life skills trauma robbed you of. You need to be able to
 Manage your emotions in a constructive way
 Use the therapy relationship for support and stability
 Maintain other supportive relationships
 Contain impulsive behavior, including self-injury
 Minimize your use of dissociation
 Show good judgment, especially concerning personal safety
Developing these abilities may actually be the biggest part of your trauma
treatment. It’s certainly the part that comes first. When both you and your
therapist agree that you’ve gained enough stability inside and outside from
working on these skills, you may be ready to work on your trauma directly.
You may want to jump right into direct work on your trauma experiences
with both feet, skipping the part about stabilizing your life and finding ways
to manage your emotions. A lot of traumatized people fiercely believe or
hope that some kind of cathartic encounter with their trauma experiences
will relieve them of their suffering. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
171
Chapter 10: Finding the Treatment Approach That’s Right for You

When you take on the powerful emotions associated with your trauma history
without adequate preparation, one of two things happens:
 Your system, in its wisdom, shuts down (dissociates) before you can get
flooded.
 You are once again overwhelmed by the feelings and memories and, in
the process, become traumatized all over again. Reliving trauma in this
way may very well lead to a relapse of your eating disorder symptoms.
Most treatments for chronic childhood trauma occur in stages, beginning with
a stage for building personal stability. Depending on your needs, this stage of
treatment can last anywhere from several months to several years. Much of
what you work on to make your life more stable — like emotion management
or building a social support network — is also very relevant to your eating
disorder.
Several major approaches to therapy can treat trauma as well as eating
disorders. These include the following, each of which is discussed earlier in
this chapter in the section indicated:
 Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): See “Concentrating on Cognitive-
Behavioral Therapy (CBT).”
 Psychodynamic psychotherapy: See “Setting Your Sights on
Psychodynamic Therapy.”
 Somatic Experiencing (SE): See “Body-based therapies.”
 EMDR: See “EMDR therapy.”
 Thought Field Therapy (TFT): See “Energy therapies.”
How do trauma treatments help?
What can you expect to happen when you make it through the trials and
tribulations of trauma treatment? Your symptom picture certainly improves:
You experience less dissociation, fewer intrusive experiences (like nightmares
or flashbacks), and better relationships with others. You also have a new
version of what happened to you, one from which distortions about yourself
have been deleted. This new version includes the feeling that the trauma is
now in the past, not part of your present. Your view of yourself is more positive.
The world seems safer. Your future looks brighter and filled with possibilities.

 Getting involved in group therapy
 Seeing what self-help groups can do for you
N
o matter how you slice it, your relationships are pretty central to your
eating disorder. Your family, with only the best of intentions, may have
passed on ideas that turned out to be too rigid or limited. Or they may have
lacked the nurturing themselves to give you experiences vital to a sense of
security in the world. Peers may play a big role in causing you to believe that
your eating disorder is necessary in order for you to be accepted. They may
have even introduced you to eating disorder behaviors. Romantic rejections
or mistreatment can convince you that people are just as untrustworthy as
you feared. Food and thinness are reliable when people fail you.
Just as people are part of the problem, people can also be part of the solution.
This chapter describes the major treatment approaches that include other
people in your therapy. These approaches may involve going back to get
things right with your family, making sure you get off on the right foot with
your current partner, or depending on the kindness of strangers in groups.
The curative ingredient in all of them is that they take advantage of the safety
of the therapy environment to try out new, healthy ways to connect with
others — ways that help make your eating disorder obsolete.
For the most part, these therapies are not substitutes for individual, 
one-on-one treatment. However, children and young teens in family therapy
and people with Type A therapists who seem to be able to cover all the bases
may do fine without one-on-one time. (See Chapter 10 for more information 
on choosing the best treatment approach for you.)

You can find out how to locate therapists or groups for each of the approaches
I outline in this chapter in the “Resource Guide” at the end of this book.
Family Therapy: Everybody 
Gets into the Act
Family therapy is one of several ways you and your family can come 
together to talk about your eating disorder. (You can read about other
options in Chapter 24.) Family therapy can take many forms, but one thing
they all have in common is that you are no longer the client (the one seeking
help from a therapist) by yourself. Your family — as a unit or entity —
becomes the client.
The fact that your family may be involved in your therapy doesn’t mean that
your family is to blame for your eating disorder. Family therapists understand
that eating disorder behaviors — like any repeated behavior in a family —
naturally become linked into a pattern with your family members’ responses.
For example, maybe whenever you cut back on your eating your mother begs
you to eat and your father threatens you — and you respond to both of them
by digging in your heels and restricting even more. Then your mother begs
you to eat again, and so the cycle repeats.
Eating disorders can fit into many family patterns. Maybe you noticed that
when your parents became involved with your eating disorder, they put aside
their bickering to focus on solving your problems. Perhaps your big sister,
who had drifted away from the family, has been pulled back in to help with
your crisis. Or maybe your father’s preoccupation with his business failings
faded as his attention turned to you when your symptoms became evident. 
In these types of patterns, the worse your eating disorder symptoms become,
the more some other problem appears to get better.
None of these family events caused your eating disorder, but they’ve all
become interlocking pieces with it, like a giant jigsaw puzzle. The interlocking
pieces have to change in order for you to get better. Family therapy helps
widen the view so everyone can see how all the pieces connect. Having this
broader view begins to make clear how everyone can help.
But, you may think, “My little sister has nothing to do with this. Why should
she have to come?” The reality is that everyone in the family is affected and
everyone can potentially help. A common scenario is to involve everyone in
your immediate family and even others, if your particular situation calls for
it. For instance, maybe your Aunt Louise has been very close to you and your
family and has your mother’s ear about your eating disorder. Inviting Aunt
Louise is probably a good idea.
174
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

When to choose family therapy
Anyone who deals with an eating disorder and who lives with a family can
benefit from family therapy. In some cases, choosing family therapy is an
option rather than an absolute requirement. In other situations, however,
family therapy is a must. Family therapy is a necessity if
 You’re a child or teenager. If you’re a dependent child, your parents are
still responsible for issues related to your development and well-being.
You still need their help and support. If your eating disorder reflects
other problems in the family, you can’t fix them by yourself. The whole
family needs to be included in making things better.
 You live at home. No matter how old you are, if you live under the same
roof as other family members, your eating disorder behaviors inevitably
are influenced by your family’s responses to your symptoms.
 Your eating disorder is intertwined with other family issues. Perhaps
another family problem — such as a conflict or the emotional or physical
issues of another family member — appears to get better or fades into
the background as your eating disorder becomes worse. Maybe a parent
or other relative expresses concern that you’re growing up too soon, but
these worries fade as your eating disorder settles in. Or perhaps one
parent seems to always understand you, while the other parent is always
fighting with you.
 Your eating disorder is having a negative affect on family life. If your
eating disorder causes your family to fight or worry more than usual, or if
everything revolves around you and your symptoms, both you and your
family need help.
Sometimes including the whole family may not seem so critical, but it still may
be a good strategy. Family therapy may be a good idea if
 You’re an adult child who hasn’t “launched.” If you’re a young adult
struggling to achieve independence, you may benefit from your family’s
help. Family therapy is a good place to figure out what actually helps at
this stage versus what gets in the way.
 You’re reluctant to become involved in treatment. Even though you
may have issues with your family, you may still feel a sense of safety in
numbers. The support of your family may help you overcome any fears
you have about entering treatment alone. Plus, the thought of your entire
family going off to talk about you to a stranger may motivate you to be
there too, if only to defend yourself!
If your parents or other family members are hostile toward you and your
eating disorder, and are unable to move into a more supportive position,
family therapy is probably a bad idea. Likewise, family therapy is impossible
if you or your parents consistently come to therapy sessions under the 
175
Chapter 11: Including Other People in Your Treatment

influence of alcohol or drugs. If family therapy is a no-go in your situation,
you still have plenty of individual therapy options to choose from. I cover
these treatment approaches in Chapter 10.
What you do in family therapy
When you and your family go into therapy together, your family therapist
helps you figure out what’s linking family behavior to your eating disorder,
and then helps you disentangle these issues. The following linking patterns
need to be unlinked:
 Family responses are meant to help you, but instead they keep the
eating disorder going. Families may get stuck in responses that don’t
help because they simply don’t know what else to do. Family therapy
can be a great place to explore better options. For example, your mother
may find out that setting firm weight recovery expectations, with clear
consequences, is more helpful than begging and pleading with you.
 Family problems seem to be solved by your eating disorder. Maybe
you believe another family member relies on your symptoms, and you
aren’t ready to take chances on what would happen without your eating
disorder. Maybe you fear Mom will become depressed if she no longer
has the closeness you two have achieved by working together to over-
come your problems. Or maybe you don’t trust that Mom and Dad will
have anything to talk about if you get better. In family therapy, worries
like these come to light. Family members have the chance to reassure
you that you’re wrong or, if you’re right, to find their own ways to work
on the issues that worry you.
Three patterns of family organization show up frequently in families where a
child has an eating disorder: overorganization, underorganization, and a
shame focus. Each of these family patterns is a piece of the eating disorder
puzzle and, as such, contributes to keeping the eating disorder going. If your
family fits one of these patterns, a family therapist can help you determine
how to move outside of that pattern. I describe these family patterns in
greater detail in Chapter 5, but the following summarizes the characteristics
of each pattern:
 An overorganized pattern: Families that fit this pattern are all 
about togetherness and unity, sticking to the rules, and conforming. 
You may have a great sense of belonging, but this family pattern may
make it hard for you to know yourself as an individual. An eating disor-
der, particularly anorexia, may pop up to help you gain some individual
control. If you’re facing the prospect of separating from your family, for
example, to go to college, your eating disorder may be an expression of
your family’s anxieties about how your leaving will rupture the family’s
togetherness. Depending on your needs, your family therapist may help
you with some or all of the following:
176
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

• Encouraging each person to have their own say
• Finding ways to deal with conflict and resolve it
• Flexing up family rules to deal with growing children
• Tolerating the inevitable loss of togetherness as children grow
 An underorganized pattern: Underorganized families have too little
structure. Parents frequently suffer from what was missing in their own
upbringing. The eating disorder, usually bulimia, frequently expresses
missing nurturing, going back for generations. Family therapy for an
underorganized family aims at
• Helping parents establish structure and rules for family life
• Helping members connect with each other in supportive ways
• Teaching members how to cope with anger and express it safely
• Helping the family to manage crises in constructive ways
 A shame focus: The family with a shame focus forever fears loss of face
and feeling worthless. Family members emphasize public appearance
and being perfect to avoid worthless feelings. An eating disorder is just
an exaggerated version of what the rest of the family feels. If you live in 
a shame-based family, family therapy can be a place for everyone to
work on:
• Being imperfect
• Discovering inner qualities and feelings that have been overlooked
while focusing on appearance and achievement
• Connecting to each other and the world in less competitive ways
A special form of family therapy, known as the Maudsley approach, is proving
to be very promising for teens with anorexia. In the Maudsley approach, 
parents are viewed as their child’s best resource for recovery, and accord-
ingly, they’re essentially put in charge of the process. You can read more
about this approach in Chapter 12.
How family therapy helps recovery
A family whose rules are clear but flexible, who can respond to the 
emotional needs of its members, who can tolerate and resolve conflict, and
who can change as the kids grow is in much better shape to respond to the
crisis of an eating disorder. Developing a stable, supportive family environ-
ment allows you to focus on recovering from your eating disorder, secure 
in the knowledge that other members of your family can take care of their
own needs.
177
Chapter 11: Including Other People in Your Treatment

Couples Therapy: Just the Two of Us
Just as the family becomes the “client” in family therapy, your relationship
with your partner becomes the client in couples therapy. The focus shifts
from the individual to the relationship. If you live with a partner, your 
eating disorder
 Affects your partner and your relationship
 Draws responses from your partner, which, repeated over time, become
part of the pattern of your disorder
 Draws responses from each of you that reflect how you handle issues 
as a couple
If you and your partner are engaged in constant struggles about your eating
disorder, whether openly or secretly, it will prolong your eating disorder and
make you both feel bad about your relationship. In this section I review the
warning signals and tell you about what couples therapy involves.
When to consider couples therapy
If you wonder whether you and your partner would benefit from couples
therapy, you may find it helpful to review the items in the following list, and
consider whether they apply to your relationship with your partner. Warning
signs that indicate couples therapy is a good idea include the following:
 Your partner threatens to leave because of your eating disorder.
 You and your partner constantly fight about how to handle your
eating disorder.
 Your eating disorder symptoms started or got worse when you
entered the relationship. Note: This doesn’t necessarily mean that 
your relationship is bad — in fact, sometimes the opposite is true. The
problem may be that you’re not accustomed to your partner’s kindness
or reliability and are having trouble trusting them.
 You and your partner can’t agree about your parents’ involvement in
your eating disorder.
 You and your partner have other problems in the relationship. Such
problems may include physical or emotional abuse, addictive behaviors,
affairs, or keeping secrets that damage your relationship.
178
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

What you do in couples therapy
Your couples therapist not only wants to know how you’re doing with your
eating disorder, but also how you and your partner are doing as a couple.
Most of the time, the way the two of you are managing with the eating disor-
der is a good indicator of what your strengths are as a couple and where you
may need to do some work.
Creating healthy boundaries
In Chapter 8 I talk about healthy individual boundaries. But relationships 
have boundaries, too. They distinguish who’s included in and who’s excluded
from various aspects of your life. Boundaries show up in your determination
of who gets information, who’s included in activities, who’s in on planning and
decision-making, who you share emotional and sexual intimacy with, and
who’s responsible for what.
Healthy boundaries in a couple accomplish a lot. They draw a line around the
two of you so you can develop couple strengths and intimacy without outside
interference. But the lines are flexible enough to allow for social resources
(family, friends, and community) and outside help when you need them.
Boundaries also exist between the two of you. Healthy boundaries allow each
of you to feel your individuality and separateness, while also allowing you 
to step inside each other’s individual boundaries for the practical stuff, like
planning, and for emotional sharing. Some boundary problems that couples
commonly face when one of the individuals in the relationship has an eating
disorder include:
 Family-of-origin: If involvement with your family-of-origin (that’s the family
you grew up in) regularly takes priority over your current partnership in
terms of time, activities, or emotional energy, you may find it hard to form
a strong boundary around you and your partner as your own unit. Your
eating disorder may provide an ongoing line of connection with your
family-of-origin. You may feel that without this connection, your family
would be overly upset by the prospect of losing you to your new 
relationship.
 Personal responsibility: Although you are expected to manage your own
eating disorder behaviors, you may feel that your partner expects you to
hand this management over to him. Or maybe you worry that he’ll feel left
out if you insist on handling your disorder yourself. These concerns may
effect how you handle your disorder.
 Closeness and distance: Individuals vary a lot in the amount of intimacy
and closeness they’re comfortable with. For example, sometimes talking
about eating disorder symptoms can offer closeness, but living with those
same symptoms can create distance. If you feel like an accordion with
your partner around your symptoms — constantly moving in and out —
trying to achieve a balance between closeness and distance is likely to be
a theme for the two of you in other areas of your relationship as well.
179
Chapter 11: Including Other People in Your Treatment

Your couples therapist will help you negotiate with your partner to develop
stronger boundary-related choices and behaviors. If your boundary issues
include your family-of-origin, you may be asked to include them in some of
the work. The idea is not to exclude your family from your life but to find the
right balance between your relationship with them and your relationship
with your partner.
Dealing with control issues
Whether you’re aware of it or not, you and your partner face the issue of 
control — who influences whom and how — from the moment you become 
a couple. Management of your eating disorder can be an arena for expressing
control issues. Does your partner get to tell you what to eat? When you’re
allowed in the kitchen or bathroom? What you’re supposed to weigh? Do 
you openly go along with the arrangement, yet manage to hold onto your
symptoms anyway?
Control issues are no small matters. You may struggle over whether your
relationship is a partnership of equals or one in which one of you gets to 
be “more equal.” The fact that the struggle has gotten tangled up with your
eating disorder just makes the stakes that much higher. If you and your part-
ner are in a control struggle over your eating disorder, your couples therapy
is a place where you can stop, take a breath, and see this clearly. You can
then work on dividing up responsibility in a way that helps you not only in
the management of your eating disorder, but when it comes to other jobs and
decisions you face as a couple as well.
You may have come to your adult partnership with a lot of wounds from your
family-of-origin. Or you may have gotten lots of good stuff but found that you
now want to change some not-so-good stuff that also came with the package,
like an emphasis on appearance or squishy boundaries. In couples therapy
you create a relationship in which you get to modify the bad stuff. This makes
couples therapy a great opportunity for healing.
How couples therapy helps recovery
Your couples therapy has the immediate job of helping you and your 
partner stop behaving in any ways that may unintentionally feed your eating
disorder. In the long term, couples therapy should help your relationship
become a place where each of you can grow, thrive, and safely connect as
equals. Working with your partner on relationship problems that you tried to
cover with your eating disorder in your childhood is a major plus for your
recovery. Working with your partner on needs that your eating disorder 
was meeting allows you to let go of the eating disorder and embrace the 
relationship.

Group Therapy: Safety in Numbers
Like family and couples therapy (see the preceding sections, “Family Therapy:
Everybody Gets into the Act” and “Couples Therapy: Just the Two of Us” for
more on these), group therapy includes other people in your eating disorder
treatment. But unlike family and couples therapy, group therapy involves total
strangers, people you may never have connected with in life. Why would you
possibly want to do that? In this section, I lay out the reasons — along with a
snapshot of the process — and let you decide.
Group therapy is different from support groups, which I discuss in the next
section, “Self-Help Groups: Grass Roots Support.” In group therapy, you have 
a professional therapist as the group’s leader. You may focus on patterns of
relating among members during group sessions as part of treatment. You’re
expected to attend each meeting. Support groups, on the other hand, rely
mainly on mutual support and often draw leadership from their members. 
You attend only when you want to. Support groups are usually free, whereas
you’re expected to pay a fee for group therapy.
Group therapy may be short-term, say 10 to 12 sessions, or open-ended, 
meaning they continue indefinitely. Open-ended groups usually meet weekly.
In these groups, you’re able to get into a wider range of topics related to your
eating disorder and your recovery, such as family, relationships, school/
career, and so on. In most cases, you also get to know other people in the
group better.
Your group may have as few as 3 or 4 members or as many as 12, but 6 to 8
people is an average group size. Some groups only have members with one
kind of eating disorder, but the trend is to mix it up. If you’re in a mixed group,
you should expect at least one other person in the group to have the same
eating disorder that you do.
Why you may consider group therapy
Some people specifically seek out group therapy because they feel they don’t
have a good support system. At the beginning, the group itself fills this void.
In time, the hope is that the social skills you gain in your group will result in
improvements in your support system outside of the group. Other benefits
you’re likely to get from group therapy include
 Feeling accepted: Almost all groups emphasize a nonjudgmental 
environment. This is a big part of what makes a group feel safe.
 Getting support: Getting encouragement from other members to 
make changes and take on tough issues is like having your own 
cheering section.
181
Chapter 11: Including Other People in Your Treatment

 Feeling connected: Many people come to group therapy feeling very 
isolated because of their eating disorder. You may find it a big relief to
feel understood and not so alone.
 Practicing new skills: Group therapy serves as a great place to practice
new skills. For example, you may practice expressing your feelings
(including anger), stating your opinions, giving and receiving honest 
feedback, or disagreeing.
 Trusting others: Group therapy provides an opportunity to discover that
others can be trustworthy, reliable, and supportive.
 Being yourself: Group therapy provides a safe environment for exploring
who you are with other people who will be accepting.
Some of the benefits in the preceding list may actually sound more scary
than beneficial. You should know that most groups spend a lot of time giving
members a chance to get to know each other and to feel safe and comfortable
as a group before delving into the hard stuff. Members take on only small,
manageable challenges with each other as they develop skills and confidence
in the group setting.
What happens in group therapy
Just what happens in group therapy? Group formats vary, but two common
sources of group discussion are leader-suggested topics and group members’
own issues. Often a particular group session will include time for both. Your
leader might suggest topics like
 What does it mean to say you “feel fat”?
 What helps you most when you feel like purging?
 Who in your family is having the most difficulty with you getting better?
Your own issues may be anything from handling the fight you just had with
your sister to your shame about how competent everyone in your workplace
thinks you are — if they only knew! As your participation in the group goes
on, you’re likely to get better and better at knowing the specific kind of help
you want from other members when you bring up a particular subject.
Your group therapist guides you as a group in using group processes — that
is, being able to notice things that happen among you as group members and
finding ways to grow and gain insight from them.
182
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

How group therapy helps recovery
A lot of your eating disorder reflects your feelings of discomfort and inade-
quacy in relation to other human beings. Some of this is due to shame. Some
comes from lack of trust. Some is because you don’t feel entitled to have
others respect your needs or listen to your point of view or feelings. And
some is about lacking the skills and experience for expressing yourself.
Group therapy provides an environment in which you can heal and grow in
all these areas. When you do, your need to turn to food lessens.
Self-Help Groups: Grass Roots Support
Self-help or mutual support groups are made up of people with eating 
disorders, much like the group therapy I discuss in the previous section,
“Group Therapy: Safety in Numbers.” However, unlike therapy groups, self-
help groups are free-of-charge, they usually aren’t led by professionals, and
you aren’t expected to make a commitment to regular attendance. (I discuss
similar groups for families of people with eating disorders in Chapter 24.)
While self-help groups are free, don’t think of them as doing treatment on 
the cheap or not providing real value. Self-help groups do offer value and are
good sources of support. The freebie aspect is useful to people who can’t
otherwise afford treatment, but self-help groups aren’t really intended to be 
a substitute for professional treatment. In this section I discuss the contribu-
tions self-help groups make as an addition to your primary treatment. I zero
in on Overeaters Anonymous (OA) as a special case.
Overeaters Anonymous
Overeaters Anonymous (OA) is a self-help group modeled on Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA), a program for people addicted to alcohol. OA started as a
group for people who overeat, but now it’s common for people with anorexia,
bulimia, and binge eating disorder to attend OA as well. (In some places 
you can find Eating Disorders Anonymous [EDA].)
Like AA, OA is called a twelve–step program because being a member
includes working on principles of recovery organized into twelve separate
steps. Unfortunately, some of what OA has borrowed from AA can spell 
trouble for eating disorder recovery. At the same time, other parts of the 
program can be healing and helpful to people with eating disorders — so
much so, that many have been willing to work around the problems.
183
Chapter 11: Including Other People in Your Treatment

You can find OA meetings in your area by going online to www.oa.org. If you
live in a large city, you’ll have a choice of groups. Be sure to visit several to
find the meeting where the membership feels like a good fit for you.
Knowing the pitfalls of OA for eating disorders
Because OA is based on the principles developed by AA, it adheres to many
of the same standards. Many of the guidelines that were established with
alcoholics in mind may also be applicable to overeaters, but they can trans-
late into trouble for those with eating disorders. The following AA/OA ways of
thinking can cause problems for those recovering from an eating disorder:
 Compulsive overeating as a disease: Alcoholism is considered a 
lifelong disease, and few alcoholic people seem to be able to take up
normal drinking. The same story doesn’t apply to eating disorders. You
can reasonably expect complete recovery if you follow through with
your treatment. Predicting a lifelong disease could make it come true.
 Admitting powerlessness: The first of the twelve steps, admitting 
powerlessness, seems pretty useful as a way to break through alcoholic
denial. However, if you have an eating disorder, you probably struggle 
all the time with feelings of powerlessness. The breakthrough for you is
discovering your power!
 Abstinence: With alcohol, complete abstinence makes sense. With 
food, not so much. What else can you abstain from? In OA, the answer 
is up to you, but it has to be something. Some say bingeing. Others say
certain “forbidden” foods, like sugar. Still others say snacking. Trying to
hold onto the AA principle of abstinence in OA can lead to a lot of all-or-
nothing thinking — just when you need to be working on moderation.
Using OA effectively
The people with eating disorders who use OA most effectively are those 
who adapt OA’s way of thinking to better suit their specific needs. Some 
successful ways to do this are to
 Focus on the community, spirituality, and emotional support OA
offers.
 Keep flexible about ideology. This includes defining OA expectations in
personally meaningful ways. For example, your “abstinence” might be
following your own healthy way of eating.
 Find a sponsor (OA mentor) who supports flexible use of the program.
184
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

People who figure out a good way to use OA find that it benefits their 
recovery. Participation in OA can aid your eating disorder recovery plan by
 Reducing shame: Everybody’s been there and done that.
 Reducing isolation: In the OA community, you’re not alone.
 Encouraging you to deal with your feelings: OA is a place where talking
about feelings is welcomed.
 Promoting healthy relationship behaviors: Part of the 12 steps involves
examination of how your behaviors affect others.
 Supporting your efforts to change: Other members understand the 
significance of even baby steps toward change and are a cheering 
section for your success.
 Providing hope: You meet people who’ve been where you are — and
gotten better

Exploring Medication and 
Other Approaches
In This Chapter
 Discovering how medication may contribute to your recovery
 Finding out about a new version of family therapy for teens with anorexia
 Getting the lowdown on online treatment
A
n eating disorder affects every part of you — your body, mind, 
and spirit — so the process of getting better is composed of many 
treatment elements. For this reason, in Chapters 9, 10, and 11, I discuss a
team approach to your recovery, as well as taking advantage of more than
just one approach. This chapter focuses on some additional treatment
options for you to consider.
Additional options include using medication, trying an innovative family
approach to treating eating disorders, and using online therapy. These treat-
ment approaches aren’t appropriate for everyone with an eating disorder. If
you’re in individual therapy, you’ll want to discuss any additions to your
treatment with your therapist.
Designating a “coach” for your recovery team — someone who helps 
you coordinate your recovery team and its efforts to get you well — gives
you a big advantage. For many people, that coach is their individual 
psychotherapist.
Getting Your Biology on 
Board with Medication
If you have an eating disorder, or any psychological disorder, part of the prob-
lem may be that your brain chemistry is out of whack. The brain requires cer-
tain hormones to be present in just the right places and just the right amounts

for the body’s systems to run smoothly. In Chapter 5 I discuss how brain
chemistry that’s off-kilter can both contribute to developing an eating disor-
der as well as be the result of an eating disorder. Either way, medication may
help get things back in order. (Surprisingly, so can psychotherapy!)
When people think about taking medication to treat psychological disorders,
two reactions representing opposite extremes are common. At the one
extreme is the desire for a pill that simply fixes everything (since food and
restricting don’t). At the other extreme is the fear that medication may control
you or turn you into a zombie. Each extreme gives medication more power
than it actually has. In this section I go over what medication can realistically
do for your eating disorder.
Actually, if you have an eating disorder, you probably have to think about
more than your eating disorder symptoms with regard to medication. In
Chapter 7, I cover the major psychological disorders that commonly go hand-
in-hand with eating disorders. These companion disorders include mood 
and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. Depending on your 
personal needs, medication can play a role in the treatment of any of them.
(Fortunately, they probably don’t all require separate medications!) I discuss
medication for these companion disorders in this section as well.
The part of your treatment that involves medication is guided by your 
psychopharmacologist. Psychopharmacologist is the designation for an M.D.
who specializes in medication for psychological conditions. Your psychophar-
macologist will review your health and psychological history, make recom-
mendations about medication for you, and follow your progress on any
medication you take.
Seeking the cure for your eating 
disorder in medication
You may think, “I’ve tried so many things and I’m tired. Can’t I just take 
medication and be done with it?” Unfortunately, the answer is no. Medication
alone is not the answer for any eating disorder. Think of your treatment 
package as a mosaic. Medication may or may not be one of the pieces, but it
never comprises the entire mosaic by itself. Key reasons for this include the
following:
 Many eating disorder symptoms are not treatable at all with existing
medications. In the next section, “Rebalancing the brain chemistry
behind your eating disorder,” I go over which eating disorder symptoms
psychopharmacologists find they can treat with medication.
 Lots of people don’t get the desired effects or only get partial effects.
Reactions to medications vary widely from person to person. Somebody
else may get a great benefit from a drug that fizzles for you.
188
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 Medication’s effects on eating disorder symptoms are generally 
short-term (usually six months or so). Medicine may offer some short-
term relief, but you need to approach your symptoms in ways that have
more lasting effects (I discuss ways to do this in Chapters 10–14).
Several of the researched psychotherapies have a better track record than
does medication with regard to both cure and relapse. The best approach is
usually to try psychotherapy first and consider adding medication later if
your symptoms prove to be stubborn. You and your pharmacologist may
decide not to wait if your symptoms are especially severe or if you are being
treated for depression in addition to your eating disorder. (See the section
“Treating companion disorders,” later in this chapter, for more information
on treating depression.)
Rebalancing the brain chemistry 
behind your eating disorder
Medication can’t cure everything, and it can’t cure anything permanently, 
but it does seem to help in some situations. Medication’s helpfulness varies
depending upon the eating disorder. In this section, I go over what you can
expect from medication for each of the major eating disorders.
Medicating anorexia
A basic rule about medication applies to you if you are anorexic: gain weight
first! In Chapters 6 and 7 I review the physical and psychological symptoms
you’re likely to experience just because your body and brain are starving.
Give your body the nourishment and substance it needs to take care of itself.
At that point, you and your doctor can see what symptoms are still hanging
around that may need medicating.
The picture for treating anorexia with medication isn’t very rosy. So far, 
not much has proven especially useful for helping sufferers with their acute
symptoms, such as the urge to restrict or the distorted thinking and body
image that go with it. Ditto for preventing relapse. However, some hopeful
possibilities are under study, including
 Zyprexa (olanzapine): Zyprexa is a drug originally used for the 
symptoms of psychosis, but newer uses include treatment of the acute
symptoms of anorexia. Zyprexa is a find because, unlike some other
drugs, your brain doesn’t need to be well-fed in order for the medication
to do its job. So far, Zyprexa seems most helpful in decreasing the obses-
sive thoughts and fears about weight that keep you starving yourself.
Zyprexa also promotes weight gain. But not to worry — you stop taking
the drug when you reach your target weight.
189
Chapter 12: Exploring Medication and Other Approaches

 Naltrexone: Naltrexone is an opiate antagonist. Opiate antagonists 
block the activity of opiates in your brain. Opiates are brain chemicals
associated with pleasure. Naltrexone blocks the pleasure sensations 
an alcoholic gets from alcohol. Researchers are experimenting with 
naltrexone as a way to similarly block an addiction to dieting in people
with anorexia.
Medicating bulimia and binge eating disorder
Medication works better for bulimia and binge eating disorder than for
anorexia, though results aren’t guaranteed. Antidepressants are your best
bet. And among the antidepressants, the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors) have the safest side-effect profile, so they’re most often pre-
scribed. (See the sidebar “How do SSRIs do what they do?” to discover how
the SSRIs work.) Though Prozac (fluoxetine) is the SSRI that’s been most
studied, experts believe other SSRIs are likely to be equally effective. These
include
 Celexa (citalopram)
 Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate)
 Luvox (fluvoxamine)
 Paxil (paroxetine)
 Zoloft (sertraline)
A significant number of people with bulimia who try antidepressant drugs
experience a reduction in their bingeing and purging behavior and in their
preoccupation with weight. People with binge eating disorder respond to
antidepressants with reduced bingeing. Researchers used to think these
effects were indirect benefits of being less depressed. But now researchers
are finding that even people who aren’t depressed show improvement in
their bulimic or binge eating disorder symptoms when they take 
antidepressants.
A few other medications are under investigation for treating bulimia and/or
binge eating disorder. These drugs include
 Topimax (topiramate): Topimax, a brand name for the generic drug topi-
ramate, is an anti-seizure drug which reduces bingeing and purging. The
problem with Topimax is that it may make your brain go goofy — many
people can’t concentrate or think straight on Topimax. Researchers are
looking into Zonegran, a cousin of Topimax that has fewer side effects,
for similar results.
 ReVia (naltrexone): ReVia, a brand name for the generic drug naltrex-
one, seems to reduce bingeing and purging behavior. See the previous
section “Medicating anorexia” to find out about naltrexone’s effects in
blocking the brain’s pleasurable experience of addictive behaviors.
190
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 Zofran (ondansetron): Zofran, a brand-name form of the generic
ondansetron, is an antiemetic. Antiemetics help control vomiting caused
by chemotherapy. They may also stop you from bingeing and purging.
(Zofran hasn’t been researched for binge eating disorder.)
Ironically, if you suffer from bulimia, medication may not be an option until
your symptoms are under control. No medication can be helpful to your
bulimic symptoms if you purge it out of your system!
Treating companion disorders
Using medication to treat your mood and anxiety symptoms doesn’t usually
help your eating disorder symptoms. However, treating depression and 
anxiety does provide a better platform for recovery. Plus, you deserve to feel
as good as you can.
Three companion disorders common to eating disorders — depression, 
anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) — are routinely treated
with a class of antidepressant medications called selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs). (See the sidebar “How do SSRIs do what they do?” for more
information on how SSRIs work.)
More than one type of medication is available to treat each of these disorders,
but SSRIs are often the first choice of medical professionals. (I mention the
SSRIs in the preceding section for treatment of bulimic and BED symptoms.)
SSRIs have a high rate of effectiveness and a low side-effect profile compared
to other drugs. Prozac is probably the best known of the SSRIs, but newer
models of SSRIs coming on the market have fewer and fewer of Prozac’s side
effects, such as drowsiness and loss of libido.
191
Chapter 12: Exploring Medication and Other Approaches
How do SSRIs do what they do?
SSRI stands for selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor. That mouthful actually describes a process
that helps you use your on-hand supply of an impor-
tant natural brain chemical, serotonin, more effec-
tively. Serotonin is responsible for a multitude of
tasks throughout the brain and body. Among these
tasks is the regulation of moods and appetite. When
a supply of serotonin has just been out on its job and
is ready to be absorbed back into its neural store-
house, an SSRI acts to block the exits (“reuptake”),
sending the serotonin back for another shift. This
supply joins the serotonin already headed out for
work. That way you end up with more serotonin in
your circulation at any particular time.

Bipolar disorder is another frequent companion of the eating disorders.
Bipolar disorder almost always needs to be medicated and is almost bound
to get worse over time if medication isn’t prescribed. A class of drugs 
called mood stabilizers is usually used to treat bipolar disorder. Lithium is
probably the best known. Some mood stabilizers, like lithium, cause weight
gain. Others, like Zonegran, not so much. You need to discuss your options
carefully with your psychopharmacologist if you are diagnosed with 
bipolar disorder.
You may want to turn to the following sources for more information on 
medicating these disorders: Depression For Dummies, Overcoming Anxiety 
For Dummies, and Seasonal Affective Disorder For Dummies, all by Laura L.
Smith, Ph.D., and Charles H. Elliot, Ph.D., plus Bipolar Disorder for Dummies
by Candida Fink, M.D., and Joe Kraynak (all available from Wiley).
If you’re the parent of a child or adolescent who needs psychiatric medica-
tion, beware of being overcautious or under-cautious. On the overcautious
side, don’t be so alarmed by the thought of medicating your child that you
are closed off to its possibilities for relieving some serious symptoms and 
suffering. This is especially difficult these days with some of the stories 
that have been in the news about potential dangerous effects of the SSRI 
antidepressant drugs. Just how these drugs may affect children differently
than they do adults is still under investigation. For this reason, try not to be
under-cautious either. Because so many unanswered questions still exist, if
your child is placed on an SSRI antidepressant for depression, anxiety, 
OCD, or eating disorder symptoms, you need to be on the lookout for mood
changes at the beginning of treatment or at any time dosages are changed. 
At these times, a small minority of kids show an increase in depression or 
suicidal thoughts and feelings.
Exploring New Frontiers in 
Eating Disorder Treatment
Progress isn’t found only in the test tube. In this section I describe two 
innovations in eating disorder treatment that have developed outside the 
lab. The first is a new way of working with the families of teenagers who 
have anorexia. (You can read about the more traditional approaches in
Chapter 11.) The second — it had to happen — is the use of the Internet 
as a way to deliver treatment to people with eating disorders who may not
otherwise have access to services.
192
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Putting parents in charge 
with the Maudsley model
A very promising treatment for teens with anorexia has come out of the
Maudsley Hospital in London, an institution already well-respected for its
work with eating disorders. The treatment is a special form of family therapy.
It engages parents as the most important resources for treatment — the ones
who can save their daughter’s life.
In a handful of studies, the Maudsley model has already proven to be 
superior to individual therapy for adolescents with anorexia. In the original
study, two-thirds of kids avoided hospitalization and showed reduced preoc-
cupation with dieting and body shape. At a five year follow-up, they were still
doing better than a comparison group of kids who’d had individual treatment
at the same time. Teens who’d had anorexia for a short time — three years 
or less — did best.
Maudsley may be too much for a single parent or families with special needs
members to manage. If, for legitimate reasons, parents can’t commit the time
needed to take this treatment approach, the other therapy options discussed
in this book are all viable and good choices that have proven track records of
yielding successful results.
What the program involves
The major plus, as well as the primary challenge, of Maudsley is that parents
have to really, really be committed for it to be successful. They have to get
everybody in the family to sessions and often have to take time off work.
(Your therapist may remind your parents that they’d do it if you had cancer.)
Your parents also have to get you to eat. In the Maudsley model, your parents
are viewed as your best shot at staying alive. Why? Your parents know you
best. Your parents are asked to become your hospital unit and to supervise
what you eat until you gain the weight you need in order to be healthy again.
During the first phase of treatment, the entire family puts all other family
issues aside to focus on your life-threatening condition. Your parents are
asked to think of you as a much younger child — an effect of the anorexia —
who has to be fed to get well. Early on in treatment, you have a family meal 
in the therapist’s presence. He coaches your parents on how best to get you
to eat. He also suggests other changes they may need to make for you to 
get better.
Once you achieve a healthy weight, the family enters another phase of 
treatment. During this phase, your parents help you with normal tasks of 
adolescence, including being a little more independent. They can also start
bringing up other family issues — beefs with you, disagreements with 
siblings, or other family business.
193
Chapter 12: Exploring Medication and Other Approaches

How Maudsley helps
The Maudsley model appears to help by putting families back in order when
anorexia has thrown them into serious disorder. Where parents (understand-
ably) feel helpless and unable to protect their children, Maudsley provides a
way for them to feel effective and in charge again. Anorexia is dethroned and
you get to experience your parents as competent and able to take care of you
when you need them most. You are also encouraged to become competent, in
a teenage sort of way, and to find better sources of control in your life than
being thin.
Family researchers are now looking at ways to adapt the Maudsley model
beyond individual teens and young adults with anorexia to adults with eating
disorders, people with bulimia, and chronic eating disorder sufferers. Studies
with bulimic teens are showing good results, while other areas of study have
yet to be undertaken.
You can find a listing of therapists and programs that use the Maudsley
approach at the Something Fishy Web site at www.something-fishy.org/
treatmentfinder/.
Looking to the Internet for therapy
So many online resources are available for eating disorders, looking at 
them all could make your eyes cross. (You can find a pretty good sampling of
what’s available in the “Resource Guide” at the back of this book.) Web sites
are available to give you eating disorder information, recommend books, help
you locate eating disorder specialists, supply you with chat rooms or support
groups, offer general advice, and so on.
But can actually getting treatment online even work? Surprisingly, in specific
limited circumstances for those with bulimia or binge eating disorder, the
answer seems to be “yes.” And the amount of research to support this is
increasing.
Online therapy is absolutely not a good choice in the following circumstances:
 You have anorexia: The health risks are just too great and your disorder
prevents you from seeing this clearly. You need a team that includes real
people, including medical professionals.
 Your eating disorder is severe: If you aren’t sure whether yours is
severe, assume it is and get a good, in-person evaluation.
 You’re suicidal: You must have real people on your team if you struggle
with wanting to stay alive.
194
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Considering an online treatment program
The bottom line is that you are always on safest ground when you work 
with another human being, one who has gotten to know you well and can
help you flag risky situations. That said, the following conditions may make
working with an online program anything from better-than-nothing to 
actually-pretty-good:
 Shame: You may feel so ashamed about your symptoms that you simply
can’t bring yourself to tell someone what’s going on face-to-face.
 Fear: You may be nervous about entering treatment and need a way 
to get your feet wet before you go public.
 Lack of financial resources: Online treatment isn’t free, but it’s 
generally less expensive than in-person treatment.
 Lack of access: In many locations, no one who knows how to treat eating
disorders is available.
 An intention to supplement your in-person therapy: Many eating 
disorder sufferers who work with a therapist find additional ways to
work on their treatment on their own. Talk about this possibility with
your therapist to make sure what you do online doesn’t clash with what
you’re doing with him. Some online programs have a specialized focus
which may fit in well with your primary therapy, such as nutritional
counseling or body image work.
Finding help with online therapy
Mouse-clickers beware! Being online is like being in the Wild West. People
make up the rules as they go along, and no regulations exist to govern what
anyone may offer you. Be sure to check the credentials of the Web sponsor.
Finding your Web-based program through a reputable eating disorder 
network, such as those listed in the “Resource Guide” at the back of this
book, is one good way to check a potential provider’s credibility.
The following models represent the types of online treatment that are 
available:
 Online workbooks with questions and exercises that you complete at
your own pace
 Programs timed with other participants in which you read, journal, and
“meet” in chat rooms with a facilitator
 Educational programs divided into sessions that offer advice and 
strategies for symptom management and dealing with relapse
Depending on the site and program sponsor, you may find a lot of mixing-
and-matching within these models. For example, some programs may only
involve you and your computer screen. Other programs may require you to
have phone sessions with a sponsoring therapist. Or you may have to start
out with an in-person evaluation.

Just as the Web is used to promote and support
eating disorder recovery, some people use the
Internet to undermine recovery. Though not
exactly the plan, undermining recovery is often
the effect of a group of underground Web sites
known as pro-ana (pro-anorexia), pro-mia (pro-
bulimia) and pro-ed (pro-eating disorder).
These sites are generally described as glorifying
eating disorders as a lifestyle. If you read the sites’
content, you can easily see how they’ve earned
this reputation. However, the truth is a little more 
complicated and a lot sadder than what you see
on the surface. In some communities members
might recognize their disorder, but have given up
on recovery. In “lifestyle” communities, whether
members embrace or deny their own disorder,
they aim to emulate anorexic qualities of grit,
determination, and endurance in the pursuit of
thinness. Pro-ana groups share thinspiration, that
is, inspiration in the form of photos of emaciated
heroines and weight loss slogans and tips. Pro-
mia groups add tips for bulimic activities such as
purging and keeping it a secret. (“Pro-ed” seems
to be a moving target for definition, often used to
refer to all such communities.)
The heart of these groups is individuals reaching out
of isolation for community and understanding — just
what you’d want an eating disordered person to do,
right? The tragedy and risk of the community they
form is that its members have given up on the possi-
bility that things could ever be different for them. So
they support each other in this belief and make a
virtue of defeat. Who can be thinnest? Who can
endure most? (People who die from starvation are
considered martyrs.) A participant believes her
eating disorder — the pursuit of perfection, the 
possibility of reaching her goal weight, of being
“good” — is all she has to protect her from the
oncoming tide of her own unworthiness.
Because despair is never far from anyone who has
struggled with an eating disorder, a vulnerable
person who wanders onto one of these sites out of
curiosity or with the hope of finding connection and
understanding (a common theme) may be at risk of
being drawn into the vortex. Feeling understood and
not judged feels good, especially if you’re feeling like
a failure. These sites, like secret clubs, have their
own language, vows, rituals, and — above all — 
loyalty to one another, or at least to one another’s
suffering.
The allure of the pro-ana, pro-mia, and pro-ed
Internet underground is dangerous because the
basic instincts that draw people to these sites are
understandable human needs (like acceptance and
community) in the face of disabling, demoralizing 
disorders. These sites seem to fulfill these human
needs, but they do so in a destructive way. If you
have an eating disorder and find yourself tempted 
by pro-ana–type sites, consider the following 
alternatives:
 If face-to-face support feels too overwhelming,
consider online support in the form of groups or
chat rooms (see the “Resource Guide” at the
end of this book).
 If you’ve tried a recovery-based group (online 
or real time) and were disappointed, maybe 
you need to give it another chance. Unlike 
pro-ana, support groups are made up of real
people who are bound to disappoint at times as
well as help.
 If you feel judged or pushed to do more than 
you feel you can at this moment in a support
group, you need to speak up. That’s part of
recovery too!
 If you feel like giving up on recovery, remember
that — unlike your eating disorder — your 
treatment team doesn’t require or expect you to
be perfect.

Making Good Use of the 
Approach You Choose
In This Chapter
 Recognizing realistic expectations for treatment
 Discovering the differences between eating disorder goals and recovery goals
 Understanding how to work most effectively with your therapist
 Getting the most out of group treatment
S
ay you’ve lined up the best treatment team you can find to help 
with your recovery. Your team includes an individual therapist whose
approach and personality you like, a reputable nutritionist, and maybe a 
psychopharmacologist and a support group. Everything’s in place — almost.
You still have one more team member to focus on to make sure you get the
results you deserve: you! Recovering from an eating disorder is one of 
the hardest challenges you’ll ever face. You want to bring your “A” game.
You may be wondering, “What does this even mean? I’m the one with 
the problem. Didn’t I hire the experts to figure this out for me and make 
me better?” Well, you’re half right. You are in treatment to work on your 
problem — your eating disorder. And you did hire your team members
because they’re eating disorder experts. But successful treatment requires
you to partner up with your team members; they can show you the way, but
you have to walk the path.
In this chapter I go over four areas where your way of partnering up can
make a big difference: your expectations of treatment, your view of recovery
goals, your relationship with your therapist, and your participation in group
treatment.

Letting Go of Magic for Reality
Unrealistic expectations for treatment can undermine the process before you
even set foot in the door. If your ideas about how the treatment should go or
what your part in it should be don’t match what actually needs to happen for
you to get better, you aren’t headed for a good treatment outcome. Two 
unrealistic treatment expectations are particularly common among people
with eating disorders:
 The longing for a quick fix from therapy, one that will involve a minimum
of time and discomfort.
 The expectation that someone else can fix things for you.
What makes you bring unrealistic expectations to your treatment? Sometimes
you simply don’t know what’s supposed to happen. A frank discussion with
your therapist at the beginning of treatment is a good way to clarify what you
can realistically expect from each other and from the process. (Read more 
on establishing a successful working relationship with your therapist in the
section “Partnering with Your Therapist in a Treatment-Boosting Way,” later
in this chapter.)
People who find that longings for magic hang around in spite of such a conver-
sation usually have very little confidence in what they can bring to the team
effort. In this section I describe more about how expectations for magical
treatments develop, how they affect treatment, and why surrendering them is
more likely to get you the results you want.
Giving up the longing for a quick fix
Living right alongside fears of giving up your eating disorder is a small 
volcano of urgency that says you must get over your symptoms now! You’re
especially likely to feel this way if bingeing is one of your symptoms. Even if
you reduce your symptoms fairly quickly in treatment, that same volcano
fires away for you to be over all your other discomforts yesterday. You don’t
want to feel frustrated about your future or friends. It’s hard to experience
loneliness, disappointment, or anger.
The urgency to get rid of uncomfortable feelings is part of what causes the
development of an eating disorder in the first place. Tolerating discomfort is
a recovery skill that takes time to develop.
Longing for a quick fix also reflects your feelings of hopelessness. You’ve
been struggling for a long time, always ending up in the same demoralizing
place. Some of the urgency you feel may be your desire for immediate 
reassurance that you actually can get better.
198
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Your feelings completely make sense, given where you’ve been. Yet, if you’re
going to dig in for the long-haul work of recovery, someplace along the line
you need to let go of the expectation that you’ll get better fast. Holding on to
your longing for a quick fix impacts your treatment negatively by leading you
to conclusions like the following:
 You believe your treatment is failing because you think it’s not working
fast enough.
 You believe you are failing because you think you’d be getting better
faster if you were doing everything right.
 You don’t dig in for the work that takes longer because it doesn’t match
your idea that recovery is supposed to happen right away.
 You’re highly vulnerable to relapse because you want to turn to 
something that makes you feel better now (such as food or dieting).
If you have questions about your progress, talk them over with your 
therapist. To address the issue of how well things are going, you may ask:
 How does your therapist think you’re doing, considering how long
you’ve been in treatment?
 Does she see signs of progress you may be missing?
 Can she think of anything you can do differently to benefit your 
treatment?
 Does she think adding any other kinds of treatment or practices may
improve your progress? (See Chapter 9 for a discussion of some 
possibilities.)
Just because everything isn’t better now, that doesn’t mean nothing is better.
Recovery is about progress, not perfection. Some of the joys of recovery are
the unexpected nuggets of progress that develop along the way: You find
you’re able to do something you never imagined doing before; you under-
stand something in your situation with a new compassion you didn’t believe
possible; or you become aware of a positive trait or a resource in yourself
that you didn’t see before. These jewels often provide just the injections of
hope and confidence you need to keep you going.
Losing the longing for an outside fix
Not only may you feel powerless and unable to do anything about your eating
disorder, but you may also feel powerless and ineffective in managing your
life as a whole. These feelings steered you into your eating disorder in the
first place. Longing for someone or something outside of you to fix not only
the eating disorder but also your life in general reflects your vote of no-confi-
dence in your own worth and abilities.
199
Chapter 13: Making Good Use of the Approach You Choose

You may have devoted a lot of energy to finding the outside fix. Besides food
and thinness, you may have tried drugs, alcohol, sex, or shopping. If you
haven’t turned off from relationships, you may have hoped another person
could supply what feels missing. Hoping your therapist or the therapy
process can be the outside fix is just another in a line of efforts doomed to
failure. The good news is that once you’ve committed to developing your
own inside fix — the real road to recovery — your therapist can be a great
source of guidance and support.
Beyond symptom management, the heart of your recovery is the process of
building yourself up from the inside out. Self-esteem and self-confidence can
only come from an inside fix. You achieve this by developing skills that help
you feel empowered and effective as a person.
How can you tell whether you’re bringing a desire for an outside fix to your
therapy? Be on the alert for the following telltale signs:
 You regularly wait for your therapist to say or suggest something to
make you feel better.
 You resist your therapist’s efforts to engage you in self-soothing or other
emotion management techniques. (Isn’t that your therapist’s job?)
 You frequently try to convince your therapist that expecting you to try
to make the kinds of changes in your life that the two of you are 
discussing isn’t reasonable or fair.
Surrendering the longing for someone or something outside of you to fix you
is necessary in order to face the challenges of working on an inside fix. Giving
up this longing is one of the bravest and most meaningful leaps of your 
recovery. It signals the beginning of your understanding that
 You are the only one who can rescue you.
 You have or can develop the resources and skills you need for 
self-rescue.
 You’ll never find a better fix than this one.
Your therapist can’t do the work for you, any more than a personal trainer
can exercise for you. But your therapist can certainly offer you support, 
recognize your courage and efforts, help you see where you’re tripping over
your own feet, point the direction to recovery, commiserate with your 
setbacks, and applaud your big and little victories. You have a lot to gain 
by having your therapist in your corner.

Substituting Recovery Goals 
for Eating Disorder Goals
Many changes in thinking mark your shift from eating disorder into recovery
(see Chapter 8 for more on evaluating your recovery). One of the most 
important changes in your thinking is that you surrender “thin” as your mea-
sure of success. This change may feel like one of the scariest. If you don’t
measure your success by your thinness, how do you measure it? You need a
lot of courage to invest hope or energy in a future “you” that you can barely
imagine, let alone believe in. But the more you invest in that future you, the
more buffering you create between yourself and your eating disorder. The
choices you make can have either boosting or busting effects on your 
treatment. I discuss your choices and their effects in this section.
Surrendering “thin” as your 
measure of success
With your eating disorder, “thin” is your measure of success and you 
think being thin is what will make you happy in life. These beliefs are part-
and-parcel of your eating disorder. Keeping “thin” as your goal, with the 
belief that it can make you happy, has a treatment-busting effect.
How does this stance undermine your treatment? Here are some examples:
 If you’re mostly talking about getting thin in your therapy sessions,
you’re not working on the issues that caused your eating disorder or
developing the skills that can free you of it.
 If you’re still putting your energies into getting thin, you’re probably not
investing in recovery skills outside of treatment.
 The more focused you are on getting and staying thin, the more at risk
you are for relapse, even when you’ve reduced your eating disorder
symptoms.
If you have a particularly hard time shifting away from thin as your goal, you
may be having difficulty imagining that other things about you matter or that
you can be accepted if you’re less than perfect. These issues are fundamen-
tally important. Aim to resolve these issues in your therapy sessions rather
than trying to resolve them by being thin. In the meantime, you may want to
check out Chapter 8 for ways to work on building a positive self-image 
unrelated to weight.
201
Chapter 13: Making Good Use of the Approach You Choose

Does surrendering “thin” as your goal mean your sensitivities about your
body size and shape will disappear? Not likely, if only because of the constant
cultural and media drumbeat to be thin. Shifting your focus away from thin
may be purely a leap of faith for you at the beginning — an acknowledgment
that your way hasn’t worked, so maybe the time is right to try something 
different. And that’s enough to start with. Putting your energies into other
goals proves to be a worthy approach when you begin to see results from
your efforts.
Knowing you need to do more 
than stop bingeing
One of the most common mistakes people with eating disorders make is 
to drop out of treatment as soon as their acute symptoms are gone, before
doing any recovery work. If you’re thinking about dropping out, don’t do 
it! Failing to get a good toehold in recovery sharply increases your risk 
of relapse.
On the other hand, the more recovery work you get under your belt, the less
your chances of relapse. Think of the recovery process as building up a
reserve bank account. The reserves you store supply you with a buffer from
eating disorder behaviors. When challenges come up, you have more and
more skills and an improved self-image to draw on.
Looking beyond your focus 
on food and weight
Peeking around the corner from the monster issues of food and weight to see
whether anything else is out there for you is a great act of courage in recovery.
Could you have a life with better relationships, more education, or a career
you care about? Sometimes hanging around in the familiar territory of your
eating disorder feels a lot safer than trying something new, even though your
eating disorder makes you miserable. You may feel like you’re being asked to
choose between the devil you know and the devil you don’t know.
Thinking about the outer aspects of your life may not feel as scary as facing
what may be inside. You may be afraid of finding feelings that jolt your image
of yourself. The “nice girl” in you doesn’t want to discover that you’re angry at
someone. Perhaps you’re fearful of tapping into emotions that may overwhelm
you. Or maybe your worst fear is finding no feelings at all.
202
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

If facing big life questions or inner truths makes you tiptoe or stop and start,
don’t worry. Treatment isn’t a sprint to the finish line. Only when you retreat
to your eating disorder as a safer focus and stay there are you in a treatment-
busting situation. If you think this is where you may be headed, talk with your
therapist about it. How can the two of you work together to better recognize
your fears? Does just talking openly about them help? A conversation like
this is likely to be treatment-boosting by opening the door to topics that help
your therapy progress.
Recognizing signs of recovery 
unrelated to weight
Part of your eating disorder recovery involves recognizing results that are
unrelated to weight. If you count only what you see on the scales, you put
yourself at great risk for relapse. On the other hand, when you begin to recog-
nize and enjoy results that have nothing to do with getting thin, you plant at
least one foot and several toes in recovery. And you reduce your relapse risk.
Discovering how to recognize signs of recovery unrelated to weight offers a
great opportunity for you to partner up with your therapy in a treatment-
boosting way. You can’t will yourself to stop having thoughts and fears about
weight, but you can choose what to do when such thoughts and fears pop up.
The treatment-busting choice is to hang out with your fears and give them
lots of air space. The treatment-boosting choice is to shift your thinking to
some aspect of your recovery instead.
In Chapter 8 you find charts for tracking your progress with common markers
of recovery, such as emotion management and healthy relationships. Working
with these progress charts may give you just the change of focus you need.
Or you and your therapist may identify progress markers that apply specifi-
cally to you, such as leaving the job with the abusive boss, telling your 
girlfriend you don’t like being called “Shrimp,” or noticing that you’re more
likely to restrict when your mom and dad aren’t talking to each other.
Therapists and therapy group members often notice small signs of recovery
before you do, or see the significance of a new behavior in a way that you
don’t yet see. Here are some examples of ways recovery progress may 
show up:
 Sheri has always been afraid of her anger. She’s annoyed at her mom 
for walking into her room without knocking, but she’s afraid to say so.
Simply acknowledging these feelings is progress.
203
Chapter 13: Making Good Use of the Approach You Choose

 Anna, who can never assert her own needs, asks if it would be okay to
turn up the air conditioning in her therapist’s office.
 Mike’s group notices his posture has changed and he’s been looking
people right in the eye when he speaks.
If the feedback or recognition you get doesn’t match your image of yourself
or involves a direction that feels scary (like getting angry or being assertive),
one response is to shrug off the comment. This is a treatment-busting
response. A treatment-boosting response is to stay curious and interested —
ask yourself what may happen if you take the feedback seriously. When feed-
back involves a direction that feels scary, remember that you can take all the
time you need to build the skills and confidence required to get to the next
step in your recovery. Acknowledging your improvement doesn’t obligate
you to jump off the high dive!
Partnering with Your Therapist 
in a Treatment-Boosting Way
No matter what form of treatment you choose, the outcome depends on the
quality of the work you and your therapist do together. I assume you’ve
picked the best therapist you can, so your team is strong on that side. But
what are the ingredients you need to bring to the mix to round out your team
and make sure you and your therapist do the best possible work on your
behalf? In this section, I go over therapy-boosting ways to partner with your
therapist.
Working collaboratively
Working collaboratively is an ongoing treatment-boosting approach.
Collaboration means you and your therapist each jump in and do your share
of the work to solve your problems and help you get better. The opposite 
of this approach would be if somehow your therapist could “do treatment” 
to you without much input from you, like getting a massage or a haircut.
Holding out for this fantasy treatment is a treatment-busting approach and
can seriously interfere with getting the results you want and deserve.
In a collaborative therapy partnership, you bring your therapist on board for
her expertise about eating disorders and the treatment process in general.
But you are also an expert. What your expertise covers is you: how you feel
about things, how you feel in the moment, how you view things, what works
for you, what doesn’t, and so forth. You and your therapist can both con-
tribute ideas about what makes you tick and what may be a good direction
for you in a particular situation.
204
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Believing you have as much to contribute to the outcome of your treatment
as your therapist is a treatment-boosting approach. It shows up in all the
remaining ways I outline for participating in your therapy.
Showing up
Showing up sounds like a silly thing to mention. But actually showing up for
your sessions is a minimum way to express collaboration. When you’re there,
something helpful can happen. This is true even on the days you’re full of
despair and feel that your body in the chair is the maximum contribution you
can make. Allowing your therapist to support you in moments when you need
to catch your breath contributes to your recovery!
It can also be important to show up for appointments even when you’ve had
a good week or day. Sometimes you may not be aware of important actions
you took or ways you looked at events to make things go well. You’ll want to
know about your “secrets to success” so you can repeat them. And it doesn’t
hurt to get your therapist’s affirmation!
Another part of showing up is being fully present. You’re not fully present if
you go to sessions under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Even if you “get
away with it” and your therapist can’t tell, you still aren’t able to do your best
collaborating under these conditions. Definitely a treatment-buster.
Following through
What’s expected of you between sessions depends on your therapist and 
the kind of therapy you’re in. In certain kinds of therapy, such as cognitive-
behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy,
formal homework assignments are a built-in part of the approach. (You can
read more about these approaches in Chapter 10.) Other therapists make up
homework assignments regularly or once-in-awhile to reflect something
you’ve just worked on in session.
The obvious follow-through for therapy homework is to just do it. But that
doesn’t mean you have to succeed at what you try in order for your treat-
ment collaboration to be a success. Kelly supplies an example:
In Kelly’s last therapy session, she and her therapist talked about the 
fact that Kelly has no long-range goals for herself and is sort of drifting
from one dead-end job to another. Her therapist describes a goal-setting
exercise for Kelly to do at home that starts with visualizing her ideal life
five years down the line.
205
Chapter 13: Making Good Use of the Approach You Choose

Kelly sits down to do her assignment. Staring at the blank sheet, she
starts to feel panicky. She wisely puts the paper away and does some-
thing else to quiet herself down. In her next session, Kelly is able to
report that she’s never thought of her life five years ahead, and that she
feels flooded with fear and a sense of inadequacy when she tries to do so.
This opens up an important conversation with her therapist about the
crisis-to-crisis way her family lives and how scary it is to imagine being
different from them.
Even if your therapist rarely or never suggests homework, you can find 
treatment-boosting ways to follow through on your own after a session. You
can continue to think about what you were working on. Maybe you have
more ideas about it or see the issue in a new light. Maybe something that felt
true in your session feels wrong now — or the other way around. Maybe just
having the ideas percolating in your mind impacts your feelings or behavior
during the week. Or maybe keeping track of what you’ve done since your 
session helps you know where you want to pick up the thread when you
return. All these forms of follow-through are definitely treatment-boosting.
They help you get maximum mileage out of your therapy.
Taking risks
In the movie The Accidental Tourist, the main character explains his view 
of foreign travel: You bring as many familiar items with you as you can and
expose yourself to as little as possible of that which feels strange in the for-
eign culture. Approaching your treatment in a similar way is good for keeping
things familiar, but bad for helping you change and get better. Nothing
changes if nothing changes!
How much risk you take in therapy depends on your individual circum-
stances, what you’re working on at a particular time, and how much trust
you’ve developed in your therapist and the therapy process. Part of good 
collaboration with your therapist includes figuring out the amount of risk 
you can reasonably take, given your current circumstances. Taking on some
risk is important; otherwise, your symptoms stay just as they are and you
feel frustrated and disappointed with your treatment.
You can take some really valuable risks right in your therapy sessions.
Depending on your individual circumstances, any of the following may 
feel risky:
 Revealing things about yourself
 Feeling emotions you’re not used to feeling
 Finding out new things about yourself
 Exploring hopes and dreams that seem out of reach
206
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Trying new behaviors outside of therapy — otherwise known as life — is the
other big arena for risk-taking. The list of risks you can take outside therapy
is as long as the list of goals you may have for treatment. Here are some
examples related to recovery:
 Eating: Trying new foods, eating socially without purging afterward,
eating breakfast
 Relationships: Telling people “no,” weeding abusive people out of your
network, telling your friend about your eating disorder
 Emotions: Tolerating awareness of grief a little longer before distracting
yourself, trying out a meditation class
 Self-image: Trying to imagine other things about yourself that are 
worthwhile besides your weight, focusing on body parts other than the
ones you think are fat
Your risk-taking efforts don’t all have to hit the mark to be successful. As long
as you gain new insights from what happens, the effort is a success. However,
some risks feel particularly — well, risky. While you can never control all 
possible outcomes (if you could, you wouldn’t be risking anything!), you and
your therapist probably want to collaborate especially carefully to make the
risky risks manageable.
Being truthful
Being truthful means telling your therapist exactly what’s going on with 
you — things he needs to know in order to help you but can only know if you
tell him.
Your therapist needs to know what you’re doing outside the therapy sessions.
Be sure to tell him about things like
 Self-injuring behaviors: For example, cutting or burning yourself, tearing
out your hair, or similar behaviors
 Reckless or dangerous behaviors: For example, drinking and driving, 
driving way over the speed limit, or any other behavior that risks your
life or safety
 Relapse behaviors: Dieting, restricting, bingeing, purging, or compulsive
exercise
 Illegal behaviors: For example, shoplifting or petty stealing to pay for
drugs, laxatives, and so on
 Dropping out of school or failing most of your classes: Class work or
educational goals have taken a back seat to your eating disorder.
207
Chapter 13: Making Good Use of the Approach You Choose

 Losing a job you need: You failed to show up or your job performance
suffered due to your eating disorder
 Relationship breakups: Ending a romance or a friendship has big 
emotional repercussions. You may be tempted to use eating disorder
behaviors to cope.
You may keep information like this to yourself because you’re ashamed or
afraid that your therapist may be disappointed or angry. Or perhaps you’re
not used to having people take you seriously when bad things happen to you.
This is an excellent time for some treatment-boosting risk taking. When you
bring your therapist on board with problems, especially things you may not
be so proud of, you give the collaborative relationship a chance to get
stronger. You discover that the two of you can take on the tough stuff.
Another time you need to be truthful with your therapist is when you’re
thinking or feeling things that may hurt you or hurt your treatment. He 
especially needs to know if you are having any of the following kinds of
thoughts or feelings:
 Suicidal feelings
 Hopelessness or feelings of despair
 Thoughts about dropping out of treatment
Your instinct when you’re feeling any of these things may be to withdraw. For
your treatment to be helpful, you need to counteract this instinct. Thinking 
of people as a source of help when you’re feeling your worst may be new to
you. Finding that you can bring your most difficult thoughts and feelings 
to therapy is definitely a treatment-booster.
Speaking up
If you’re close to someone, you know that at times that person makes you
mad, hurts you, or disagrees with you, right? The same is true of your relation-
ship with your therapist. Any or all of the following reactions to your therapist
are to be expected at some point:
 You don’t like something your therapist is saying or doing.
 You don’t find something she’s doing or saying helpful.
 Something she says hurts your feelings.
 You disagree with her opinion or suggestion about something.
Telling your therapist when you’re not happy with her or the two of you are
out of sync is a form of risk-taking. It may feel especially risky if you think
having negative feelings toward someone you like is unsafe or not nice.
208
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

You pay a high price for not speaking up when you have negative reactions.
The relationship with your therapist may begin to feel fake. Therapy may end
up feeling like one more place where you just have to go along, where your
feelings and needs don’t matter. And the worst of it is, you’re missing out on a
great opportunity! Therapy can be the perfect two-person lab for experiment-
ing with relationship behaviors you need to work on for your recovery. After
all, you’re with someone who knows that what you’re doing feels risky and
who supports your efforts.
Every time you risk speaking up with your therapist when you’re unhappy 
or disagree with her, you engage in therapy-boosting behavior. You become
stronger. The relationship becomes stronger and you trust it more. And —
the bonus — you’re a little more likely to try these valuable behaviors out in
the “real world.”
Participating in repair
Sometimes things that feel really bad happen with your therapist. The misun-
derstanding may be a really big one. The hurt cuts to the bone. You feel 
abandoned. Or humiliated. Furious. Frightened. Any of these unwanted expe-
riences can feel like they’ve shredded the relationship with your therapist
and your trust in him.
You may consider pulling up stakes and getting out of there. Maybe that’s
what you typically do when something happens to hurt a relationship you’re
in. Or maybe you just don’t know how people make things better at a point
like this. Or you can’t picture how this particular rupture can be mended. Of
course, the possibility exists that it can’t. But you have a world to gain from
hanging in a little longer and trying to repair the relationship.
When you and your therapist roll up your sleeves and go to work to repair a
rupture between you, you are both saying your feelings matter and the rela-
tionship matters. This sends a healing message. More healing may be had by
figuring out what went wrong, acknowledging your hurt, and looking together
for a way to resolve things. You also feel effective when you’re able to do this
kind of repair work. You gain the confidence of knowing that you and your
therapist can handle the situation if things go wrong again. What’s more, the
experience shows you how to do this in other relationships.
Making the Most of Groups
Group situations call on you to bring parts of yourself to therapy that you
can leave at home in one-on-one situations. If you decide to include group
therapy or a support group in your treatment plan, you need to determine
what qualities you need to bring in order to get the most from the experi-
ence. In this section I go over the treatment-boosters for each kind of group.
209
Chapter 13: Making Good Use of the Approach You Choose

Group therapy is different from a support group. A therapy group is led by a
professional group therapist. You’re expected to attend each time the group
meets. Though support groups may sometimes be facilitated by profession-
als, they are often led by group members. You can go to meetings when you
want to.
Group therapy
In group therapy, you talk about your eating disorder and how you’re doing
with recovery-related behaviors. You develop relationship skills by experi-
encing what happens among group members and practicing new relationship
behaviors. (You can read more about group therapy in Chapter 11.)
Most of the treatment-boosting approaches I advocate earlier in this chapter
for getting the most from individual therapy also help you maximize a group
therapy experience. Treatment-boosting approaches include
 Having realistic goals for treatment results
 Focusing on recovery goals instead of eating disorder goals
 Showing up
 Following through
 Taking risks
 Being truthful
 Speaking up
 Participating in repair
But hold on! You can bring a few more qualities, specific to group therapy, to
help you get the most from the situation, such as
 Willingness to get involved with other people: You can’t get much from
group therapy by keeping your thoughts to yourself (although many
people start group therapy this way and gradually expand).
 Willingness and ability to commit to the group process on a regular
basis: For a group to work, you have to know people are going to show
up. For you to get something out of it, you have to feel you’re a real part
of the group. This can only happen if you’re a reliable, regular part of
what goes on there.
 Openness to new things: This quality is especially useful if your group is
finding out about specific, new skills (like a dialectical-behavioral skills
training group).
210
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 Open-mindedness: You listen to other points of view, and think about
what they may have to offer you. You take in what others have to say
about you and think about it, whether you end up agreeing or not.
 Ability to tolerate having the focus on someone else’s needs: Not
everybody is up for sharing their therapy time with other people.
 Ability to tolerate having the focus on your own needs: You may find
this surprisingly hard in a group situation, especially when you’re aware
of others who may want the spotlight at the same time.
Besides these therapy-boosting approaches, a few practical considerations
affect your ability to benefit from group therapy. The main ones to keep in
mind are
 Acute crisis: If you or someone in your family is going through some
kind of crisis situation — illness, job loss, relationship breakup, death,
severe suicidal feelings — you probably need to put maximum energy
into resolving or weathering the crisis. This probably isn’t a good time
to try to share your energies with others.
 Life demands that make regular attendance impossible: For example,
you travel regularly for your business; you’ve promised to be at all your
kids’ soccer and basketball games; you have to take freelance jobs 
whenever you get called.
Support groups
Support groups really differ from one another. The qualities that do you 
the most good in one type of group aren’t necessarily the ones you need to
benefit from another type of group. For instance, are you in a large group
with an invited speaker? You need the ability to listen, to get something out
of educational material, and to assert yourself if you have questions. Are you
in an intimate group of three or four people sharing your personal stories?
There you want to bring a lot of the qualities you’d bring to group therapy,
such as being prepared to focus on recovery skills rather than weight and
food, the ability to express yourself and be truthful, the ability to let others
have the group’s attention, and openness to other points of view.
You tend to get more from any group situation when you participate. But 
you can benefit just by listening, too. Overeaters Anonymous (OA) is a good
example of this. You can go to OA meeting after OA meeting and never say a
word. And if that’s the only way you can participate, by all means, do it! Just
keep in mind that the people who become actively involved in the practices
and community of the group seem to have the strongest sense of being able
to lean on the group for their recovery.

Managing Early Stage Recovery
and the Reality of Relapse
In This Chapter
 Understanding the recovery process
 Identifying key recovery skills
 Getting a grip on resistance
 Finding out how to handle relapse
C
hoosing to begin letting go of your eating disorder and pursue recovery
can feel like stepping off a cliff into an abyss; your eating disorder is
familiar ground, while recovery is unknown territory. The prospect of ventur-
ing into the unknown is understandably scary. But as you begin your adven-
ture down the recovery path, keep in mind that the challenges you encounter
in the early stage can serve to make you even stronger, paving the way to a
fuller recovery.
At this point, the worst of your eating disorder symptoms are receding, pro-
viding you some breathing room to focus on other areas of development. In
this chapter, I discuss how you can use this valuable time to build a stronger
recovery and make yourself more resilient.
The recovery process takes a lot of grit and courage because you are facing
all the things about yourself and your life that, up until now, you thought you
couldn’t face without an eating disorder. Throughout this chapter, I advise
you on how to make use of your treatment team and other resources to
develop the skills you need to stay the course and waylay the obstacles of
fear and resistance.
Without doubt, there will be times when your symptoms will resurface. In the
section on relapse, I discuss how to weather and make use of these expected
events as part of a normal recovery process. Recovery is a challenging time,
for sure, but one in which you may surprise yourself with what you can do if
you arm yourself with the right resources and give yourself a chance.

Stepping into the Unknown: 
A Recovery Overview
Recovery is the process of leaving your eating disorder behind and building
your life around a healthier center. You want to make this healthy center as
strong as possible. Doing so not only makes the return of your eating disorder
less likely, but also makes your life richer and more fulfilling — the ultimate
win-win situation.
Determining how long recovery will take
Understandably, you want to know how long your treatment will take.
Unfortunately, no one-size-fits-all answer to this question exists. Treatment
will probably take longer than you’d like, but it won’t last forever. If you catch
the problem early and don’t have too many complicating wrinkles, you may
be able to count the length of your treatment in months.
Generally, a full recovery for an eating disorder is far more likely to be counted
in years. Anorexia Nervosa and Related Eating Disorders (ANRED), Inc., an
eating disorder information source (www.anred.com), cites an average treat-
ment time of three to seven years. Making a full recovery means not only
addressing your disordered eating patterns, but also committing to resolve
the underlying issues that led you to them in the first place. See the section
“Building the Habits and Skills of Recovery” to discover some skills you can
arm yourself with to expedite the recovery process.
 A traumatic history: Trauma can include such experiences as physical
or sexual abuse, neglect or catastrophic loss. (I discuss trauma effects 
in more detail in Chapter 5.)
 Very difficult family problems: These can include chronic, unresolved
conflict between parents, high–conflict divorce, addictions, inability of
parents to provide for basic material or emotional needs of children and
so on.
 One or more companion disorders: These can include drug abuse or
bipolar disorder (you can read more about companion disorders in
Chapter 7).
Making a commitment to recovery
Your recovery process will be as individual as you are. Recovery partly
depends on how big a hold your eating disorder has on you, how extensive
214
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

the root system is of internal issues holding it in place, and the kinds of per-
sonal resources you bring to working on it. Your recovery starts when you
1. Make the decision to give up the disorder. This is the commitment you
make to yourself. It’s the moment when you admit your eating disorder
is making things worse, not better. Or when you decide it’s better to 
let people know you’re in trouble than to keep going in the same self–
harming direction.
2. Take a step to commit to this decision. You may choose to do this by
admitting to someone that you have an eating disorder, asking your family
for help, or making an appointment with a professional. The important
thing is to do something to make good on your resolve to change things.
Recovery includes your treatment process and all the members of your treat-
ment team. But these helpers are really there just to guide, facilitate, and
cheerlead a process that happens inside you. In recovery you are doing more
than surrendering your eating disorder. You are reshaping your feelings about
yourself and the way you go about living your life.
Reducing your symptoms
Reducing eating disorder symptoms — dieting, starving, bingeing, purging —
is a typical starting point for many treatment plans, such as those begun in a
hospital or residential center and some behavioral treatments. (See Chapter 10
for more on behavioral therapies.) To keep things simple, I approach recovery
as if you begin it by focusing on reducing your symptoms, such as
 Becoming aware of what triggers your symptom: For example, emo-
tional distress, feelings of loss of control, or problems in a relationship.
 Managing urges to binge or purge: For example, learning to delay the
behavior, distract yourself, comfort yourself in a constructive way, and
so forth.
 Managing anxiety around increasing food intake: For example, making
the increases in small, manageable “doses,” giving more positive mean-
ings to the food (for instance, food, not starving, allows you to be
strong) and so on.
You will not be able to participate in any aspects of recovery other than
weight regain if you are in a state of starvation. Your brain and body won’t be
up to the demands. If you are starving, your recovery will have to start with
weight gain.
Depending on the circumstances of your situation, your treatment plan may
take another tack. For instance, you may reduce your symptoms on the
installment plan — a little bit at a time over a long treatment period. Or you
215
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

may do a lot of work on the underlying emotional factors before seeing much
change in your symptoms.
Discovering the real person within
Many people with eating disorders are surprised to discover in recovery that
an actual person exists within them! Finding a “you” with real opinions, feel-
ings, and needs that have nothing to do with being thin may be a benefit of
recovery you never expected. Much of recovery is about giving this “you”
what she needs to develop and flourish.
You may find that discovering a “you” inside includes finding your own per-
sonal “start” button — the personal energy you possess to make things
happen. This energy is what’s at play when you dream a dream — big or
small — and see it through to reality. Some people call this initiative or a
sense of personal agency. You may have been turning to your eating disorder
to supply a sense of purpose and direction you don’t otherwise feel in your
life. Imagine focusing all the drive and energy you’ve used for thinness on
some goal outside yourself. As scary as that may be to think of now, a sense
of direction and the power to take yourself where you want to go can be
some of your most valued recovery side effects. You can begin the discovery
process by
 Noticing how the things you like differ from the preferences of your sib-
lings and friends.
 Noticing your daydreams. Even if you’re tempted to dismiss them as
foolish, they’re your own unique creations. They tell you a little more
about who you are.
 Writing in a diary or journal. You can begin to hear your own particular
voice.
 Drawing or taking photographs. You can begin to notice your own special
“take” on things.
216

Four secrets of a successful recovery
A few components are common to all treatment
plans and are essential to a successful recov-
ery. To make the most of your journey, commit
to the following secrets of success:
 Stay in treatment, even if your eating disor-
der symptoms have subsided.
 Seek support — family, friends, a group.
 Develop coping skills that allow you to feel
effective in your life.
 Be prepared for relapse to happen, and use
the experience to gain new insights.

Building Recovery Habits and Skills
Surrendering your eating disorder symptoms is not recovery, but it makes
recovery possible. Recovery is a building process as much as a healing one.
In this section, I focus on developing the skills, abilities, and underused
resources within yourself that allow you to feel personally powerful and con-
fident. You can become someone you can safely rely on for advice about caring
for your body, managing your emotions, navigating relationships, and challeng-
ing cultural body prescriptions that aren’t right for you.
Consolidating healthy eating habits
In the symptom-focused phase of your treatment, the emphasis is on a few
eating facts of life: You have to eat at least three square meals a day at regular
intervals and get the kind of nourishment you can only get from a wide variety
of foods. Eating this way not only takes care of your body’s physical needs,
but also reverses or reduces eating disorder symptoms of restricting and
bingeing. So is that all there is? Thankfully, no! In recovery you work on devel-
oping an inside guide for eating, whereby making healthy eating choices
becomes an automatic part of the way you think and act. You also regain a
sense of pleasure in food and eating (no kidding!). The following sections can
help you to formulate that inside guide.
Finding eating patterns that work best for you
If you’re still struggling with eating disorder symptoms or you’re at the begin-
ning of your post-symptom recovery process, the focus for your eating will
be on installing a basic template for health that has been missing. As your
recovery continues and this basic commitment to meeting your body’s needs
becomes part of you, you begin to shift your focus to designing your own way
of eating.
Customizing your eating plan doesn’t mean that you can skip breakfast if you
don’t like eating it or go back to cutting out all fats. These forms of freelancing
(making up your own rules) bypass that basic template for health. You can no
longer sacrifice your health to meet emotional needs or cultural prescriptions.
But after you take your health as a given, you can start to experiment with
what works best for you. Maybe you don’t like traditional breakfast foods but
you’re okay with a sandwich. Or maybe you’re one of those people who does
better with six smaller meals a day rather than three bigger ones. These
types of alterations are perfectly acceptable.
Eating mindfully
Mindfulness is another word for awareness. When you eat mindfully, you’re
fully in the present moment, noticing everything you can about what 
217
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

you’re experiencing. The following exercise, frequently suggested by teachers
of mindful eating, can help you get the hang of it:
1. Put a bite of food, such as some fruit, on your tongue. Let it sit there for
a moment, without chewing.
2. Notice how the bite feels on your tongue. Focus on its texture, taste, and
temperature.
3. Notice how you know when it’s time to chew, what the chewing feels like,
and how it changes the quality of the bite.
4. Notice how you know when it’s time to swallow, and focus on all the sen-
sations that go with swallowing.
This is not, of course, how you would eat a meal. But it can help you discover
how to eat with awareness. Eating with awareness helps you
 Tune in to when you are satisfied so you know when to start and when
to stop.
 Determine the distinction between emotional triggers for eating and 
genuine hunger.
 Discover what gives you pleasure in food and eating.
You’re now developing internal guides for eating. As you gain confidence 
in your ability to combine them with that template for health, you’ll find 
that they take much better care of you than the grapefruit diet or any other
outside rules and regulations. In time you’ll be able to use body signals of
hunger and fullness, along with current eating urges as reliable guidelines 
for when and what to eat.
Adding physical activity safely
In Chapter 8 I discuss healthy exercise as a marker of recovery. Your doctor
is the person on your recovery team most likely to help you with decisions
about safely adding exercise, but when you hit that point in your recovery,
you want to focus on making exercise healthy.
Healthy exercise includes using awareness of how exercise is affecting you to
help guide your exercise choices. This awareness is similar to being guided
from the inside for eating choices, which is what you are doing when you eat
mindfully (see the preceding section). Following are ways you can use this
exercise awareness to your advantage:
 Your body will reliably tell you when enough is enough. This will 
protect you from fatigue and injury.
 You can learn which types of exercise you enjoy when you’re tuned 
into your body and not focused on losing weight.
218
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 When you exercise mindfully, you and your body become a collaborative
team, working together for your heath and well-being. Your body is no
longer the enemy.
As you tune in to what exercise makes your body feel best, be on the alert for
two big warning flags:
1. Are you already exercising compulsively?
2. Are you tempted to add compulsive exercise to substitute for the eating
disorder symptoms you are surrendering? You can read more about
compulsive exercise, including how to recognize it, in Chapter 7.
If you still need to gain weight, exercise is not going to be on your menu until
you reach your weight goals. In recovery, the new standard is this: What
makes you healthy?
Staying tuned in to your feelings
One of the big reasons giving up your eating disorder is so hard is because
you’ve relied on it so much to help you manage your emotions. Your eating
disorder is a pretty blunt instrument, and you’ve paid a big price for using it.
But it’s been your life raft when you’ve had no idea how else to cope. Your
recovery is a great time to discover other ways to handle your emotional life.
All coping skills have the opposite effect of your eating disorder in one crucial
way. Your eating disorder takes you out of awareness of what’s upsetting you,
at least temporarily. Any emotion coping skills you discover will involve find-
ing out how to stay in awareness, at least long enough to figure out what’s
bothering you and what you want to do about it. In this section I go over some
skills of emotion management plus the special skills of calming or soothing
yourself.
Expanding your ability to tolerate your emotions
To paraphrase Woody Allen, 90 percent of emotion management is showing
up, or being aware of your emotions. Knowing what you feel requires tolerat-
ing a certain amount of discomfort. So far in life, you’ve been telling yourself
that you can’t tolerate any discomfort, at least not the emotional kind. In
recovery, part of your job is to discover, a little bit at a time, that you can.
You’ll probably do a lot of this work in individual or group therapy. But here’s
an exercise you can try right now to start expanding your tolerance level:
1. Think of something that may be upsetting you. Nothing too intense —
this is practice — but enough that your reflex is to get away from the
feeling.
2. Now ask yourself to stay with the feeling just 30 seconds longer. If 30
seconds is too long, make it 15 seconds.
219
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

3. Notice how it feels to tolerate just a small dose of the upset. Is it man-
ageable? Excellent! You’ve expanded!
If you have experienced physical abuse, medical problems, or other trauma
to your body, being in your body may not feel safe. Your body may have
taken itself out of the loop of emotional information. This is an example of a
self-protective process called dissociation. (You can read more about dissoci-
ation and eating disorders in Chapter 5.) If you sense that you have closed
down the connection to your body in this way, you need to respect this criti-
cal body wisdom about what feels manageable. Make sure your eating disor-
der therapist understands trauma and dissociation so he can help you take
these experiences into account as you are becoming more aware of your
emotions.
Using body-based therapies for emotion management
Body-based therapists (you can read about them in Chapter 10) spend a lot
of time helping people become aware of signals of emotional distress as they
show up in the body (rapid breathing, tight chest, butterflies in the tummy,
and so on). Awareness of these signals is central to the therapy. Somatic
Experiencing, Body-Mind Psychotherapy, and other therapies offer body-
based approaches to help you expand your awareness of distressing emo-
tions. Following are a few of their techniques:
 Naming the physical sensation(s): Locating your upset in a body sensa-
tion immediately makes the upset smaller because it’s surrounded by
the rest of you, which is bigger!
For example, Linda is feeling very hurt by her friend Joyce who broke
their shopping date to go to a movie with a different friend. As she thinks
about how she feels, Linda senses the tension in her stomach. But all
around her stomach is the rest of her body, which isn’t experiencing 
the tension. Linda begins to feel the strength and calm of the rest of her
body. These feelings quiet the tension just a little.
 Titrating: Titrating is experiencing a big upset a bite at a time (think
baby steps). The numbered exercise at the beginning of this section is a
form of titration. You can visualize the concept by thinking of an I.V. drip
or a thermostat that moves just a degree at a time.
 Looping: You can almost always find a part of your body that isn’t feel-
ing the upset. Settle into that part, and then make trips back and forth
between the quiet part and the upset part, importing the quieted part
into the upset one. Try it, and notice what happens.
 Breathing: This involves simply directing your breathing to the spots in
the body that are feeling the upset.
You can find books that describe these approaches and other emotion man-
agement tools in the Resource Guide at the back of this book.
220
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Strengthening skills of self-soothing
You’ve been trying to comfort and soothe yourself with food when you’re
upset. Because you’re not turning to your eating disorder in recovery, you have
a chance to discover effective alternatives. In recovery you want to develop a
whole cupboard full of these alternatives. And practice them! The more you
practice other ways to soothe, quiet, and comfort yourself, the more likely you
are to turn to them the next time you’re upset instead of bingeing or restricting.
The answer to what is soothing and comforting lies within you and within a
particular moment or problem. Some situations may call for a combination of
problem-solving and self-soothing in order for you to feel better. Sometimes
you problem-solve better if you do a little self-soothing first. (You think more
clearly when you’re less overwhelmed.) Other times it works best the other
way around.
Resources are healthy ways of comforting and soothing yourself. (Resources
can do other things, too, like give you courage or confidence.) You have to
try possible resources on for size to find out what works for you. The follow-
ing list of suggestions is a way to get you started. Your own list should grow
over time — you can never have too many resources! It should include a bal-
ance of resources that are outside yourself and ones that come from inside
yourself (you want to be sure you have resources available at 3 a.m. or if you
get stranded on a deserted island!).
Outside resources (includes actual people, objects or activities outside 
yourself):
 Talk to someone
 Take a walk
 Do something you enjoy, like gardening, listening to music, reading, or
painting
 Write in a journal, diary, or blog
Inside resources (involves processes that occur inside you without outside
props, meaning you’ll have them available anytime, anyplace; thoughts, images
and imagination are especially important):
 Breathe slowly and deeply
 Speak to yourself in a reassuring way (You’ll be okay. You’re alright. It’ll
be fine.)
 Picture a scene that you find peaceful or soothing
 Imagine the presence of someone you find comforting, whether real or
made-up
 Pray, chant, or engage in some other spiritual practice
221
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

Nothing on this list will provide the instant sense of relief that you get from
giving in to your eating disorder or using alcohol or drugs. But, on the other
hand, you don’t pay an emotional or physical price for anything on this list
either. Instead, you become stronger and better able to take care of yourself
as you practice using healthy, self-soothing methods.
Trying meditation, tai chi, or yoga
Many people in recovery find that practicing meditation, tai chi, or yoga can
contribute to emotion management and overall emotional quieting. Following
is a brief overview:
 Meditation, especially mindfulness meditation: Meditation is the name
for a variety of practices for focusing the mind, any of which can be useful
for becoming more calm and centered. Mindfulness meditation helps you
stay grounded and connected to the calm and safety of the present
moment, no matter how distressing the content of your thoughts may be.
These practices help you to observe your emotions rather than be caught
up in them or carried away by them. You can read more about the use of
mindfulness meditation in the treatment of eating disorders in Chapter 9.
 Tai chi: Tai chi, a martial arts practice, is often called “meditation in
motion.” Tai chi consists of a series of gentle movements using the
whole body. Practice of tai chi has been shown to reduce stress and
improve symptoms of anxiety and depression.
 Yoga: Yoga is a set of practices using body postures, meditation, and
breathing which create a sense of calm and well-being. You can read more
about the use of yoga in the treatment of eating disorders in Chapter 9.
Staying tuned in to your needs
A strong recovery includes being able to identify your needs. When your desire
to be thin isn’t screaming at you with quite so much urgency anymore, you
can begin to hear your own thoughts that inform you of what you want in life
or from a particular situation. These thoughts, which were formerly being
drowned out by your eating disorder, may be related to life goals, job or
career situations, relationships, or other areas of your life. For example,
maybe you begin to hear yourself thinking things such as
 My life won’t be complete if I don’t sing the lead in Tosca once on stage.
 Getting my degree will really make a difference in whether I can get the
kind of job I want.
 I have to get my boss to quit interrupting me every time I open my
mouth at this meeting.
222
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 I’ve worked so hard, I have to have some down time or my brain will be
fried.
 I need to be included in the decision-making in order for this relation-
ship to feel fair.
Of course, you will only be listening if you have begun to trust that what you
want or need matters. This belief might not come to you automatically.
However, it’s so important to your recovery that it’s worth working on in
therapy if you’re not there yet. Individual, family, or group therapy can all 
be great places to take risks with treating your needs like they matter.
Knowing your needs and desires is important to your recovery. This knowl-
edge will benefit you individually and will improve your relationships. I
describe these benefits in the sections that follow.
Building in a personal navigator
Many people begin to experience their own initiative — a sense of being able
to make things happen in their lives — for the first time in recovery. But how
do you know which direction to go when you have the will and the energy?
The game plan comes from knowing what you care about in life, what your
values are, what moves you, and what your passions are. The energy that
sparks an urge to do something in life often comes from your feeling that that
something is important. When you were in the throes of your eating disorder,
you directed all that energy to the pursuit of weight loss because being thin
was of utmost importance. Now you have the space to discover other options
and dreams that you feel that strongly about.
Though it’s probably too early to be figuring these things out now, you may
want to just stick a toe in the water. You might find clues to future passions
by thinking about any of the following:
 Book or movie themes you keep coming back to: Wild life, foreign travel,
women who run their own businesses, helping kids.
 Adults you admire or who have inspired you: Teachers, coaches, politi-
cians, poets.
 Life experiences that made you feel good about yourself or excited in
some way: Charitable work, discovering an artist whose work moves
you, being at the beach.
 Images — no matter how fleeting — of future activities you might enjoy:
Working in fashion, using your writing skills, using your people skills,
doing something that allows you to see different parts of the country.
Building in a relationship navigator
Making your needs part of any relationship completely changes the way it
feels to be part of that relationship. This is true whether it involves your
family, friends, neighbors, romantic partner, teachers, work colleagues, or
223
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

boss. Of course, the amount of space you have to negotiate your needs differs,
depending on which of these relationships you’re talking about. But when
you have an eating disorder, you tend to think that no space exists for your
needs in any relationship. This is particularly true if you’re female. You’ve
likely determined that thinking of your needs at all is selfish. You imagine that
nobody will like you if you sometimes want your way. You envision feeling
devastated and rejected if you speak up and your needs aren’t honored.
These risks feel impossible to take.
Consider, however, the risks of not making your needs known in a relationship.
Here are just a few of them:
 You start to feel like the relationship is more for the other person 
than you.
 You feel like the other person agrees with you that his or her needs are
more important than yours.
 You end up resenting the other person.
 You end up not trusting the other person.
 The other person doesn’t really get to know who you are, so no real
closeness can develop.
 You feel you could lose yourself in the relationship.
If you’re having a lot of difficulty getting to know your needs, individual ther-
apy can often be a safe place to think them through. The more reflective ther-
apies such as psychodynamic or feminist therapy can be particularly good
for this. You can read more about how to express yourself effectively in rela-
tionships in Chapter 8.
Expressing yourself!
You may be surprised to find that speaking what’s on your mind can help your
recovery. It’s likely that neither your personal history nor your self-image have
made such self-expression easy for you. But as you get better at it, you’ll find
two recovery–related benefits:
 A stronger self-image: A stronger self-image replaces the sense of worth-
lessness that makes you desperate to be thin and places you at high risk
for an eating disorder.
 Stronger relationships: Stronger relationships give you a place of real
support and connection so you no longer have to rely on food and 
dieting.
224
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

Strengthening your sense of self
Many people who work toward recovery in a group setting — be it family,
couple, or group therapy; 12-step groups; or other support groups — are
shocked to find that they have their own opinions and points of view about
so many subjects. Or even any subjects!
Sometimes not knowing your views is due to coming from a family environ-
ment where differing opinions weren’t valued — so you learned not to have
them. Or sometimes it’s a reflection of your low sense of worth — how could
your opinions matter to others? Safer not to know you have them in the first
place. That way you won’t risk embarrassing yourself.
Making sure you have a place where you can regularly take risks expressing
yourself and your newly discovered opinions can be very valuable to your
personal recovery, even if the risks feel very tiny at first. Self-expression in a
safe setting is frequently one of the first places for discovering that “you”
inside who’s going to become more — way more — than your eating disorder.
Strengthening yourself in your relationships
When you know what you need in relation to others and speak up about it,
relationships get less scary. That may seem counterintuitive since speaking
up can feel scary! But the truth is that you don’t need to turn to food in order
to avoid being swamped by relationship demands or a relationship’s empti-
ness. Instead, you can state what you need in a relationship. In fact, the good
news is that you will trust your relationships more as they do a better job of
meeting your needs. Then you’ll be more likely to turn to them for the sup-
port you previously sought in food.
All of your recovery skills involve some kind of self-awareness and a degree
of self-acceptance for what you discover. Knowing and accepting yourself may
be the greatest gift of recovery. The more you know and accept who you are
and what you need, the more you can make decisions from the inside, based
on what’s right for you. This self-awareness makes you strong and sturdy to
negotiate in relationships with others who also know what they need.
Dealing with Fear and Resistance
Nobody enters a change process without fears and doubts about how the
change will affect them. Worries typically come up at the beginning of eating
disorder recovery, and make it harder to go forward. Here is just a sampling
of the kinds of worries you may experience:
 Will I be able to manage life without my symptoms?
 Will I seem boring or ordinary without my disorder?
225
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

 Will anyone pay attention to me without my symptoms?
 Will I be able to function like a normal person?
 If people get to see the real me beneath my eating disorder, will they
abandon me?
 If I see the real me beneath my eating disorder, will I see things I can’t
stand?
You get to start over with a new round of doubts and fears with each new
stage and each new step of your treatment. But the good news is, it’s okay!
Having doubts and fears is perfectly normal when you are venturing into new
territory, whether it’s going into recovery, starting a new job, moving to a
new town, or any of dozens of new life directions. Even better, as you discover
in this section, you can make these fears and doubts work to your advantage.
Accepting fear as part of recovery
Moments of doubt are to be expected as part of the recovery process. It’s like
putting on the brakes when you reach a curve and don’t know what lies on
the road ahead. It’s a normal response. Therapists call this braking response
resistance. Unfortunately, the term implies stubbornness, and for a few people,
that may be a fair comparison. More often, though, resistance signals a need
to slow down and regroup, perhaps getting some reassurances before moving
ahead. Resistance comes from a part of you that is worried that things will
get worse, not better, if you continue in the direction someone on your treat-
ment team is suggesting for you.
A lot of confusion happens with resistance because people often put on the
brakes without realizing that that’s what they’ve done or why. Their fears and
doubts simply haven’t made it into conscious awareness yet, but some inter-
nal wisdom says: “Stop!” Here are some common forms resistance can take:
 Missing appointments; being late
 Not doing homework assignments
 Shutting down, responding to every question with “I don’t know”
 Using the majority of treatment time to report on other people or events
rather than to talk about yourself
 Picking petty arguments with your therapist to avoid focusing on yourself
Like so many other situations in recovery, awareness is your first friend when
it comes to dealing with moments of resistance. When you know your behav-
ior is coming from resistance, this awareness allows you to make other choices
226
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

that might be more to the point. Here are two things you can do to increase
awareness of your own resistance moments:
1. Be on the lookout for telltale signs of your heels digging in. For exam-
ple, you may feel a physical sensation or hear a small voice inside you
saying “no.”
2. Be willing to question any of your behavior that interferes with for-
ward movement in treatment or recovery in general. Ask yourself: Am
I afraid or doubtful in any way about where things are headed? Am I feel-
ing mistrustful of my therapist’s ability to guide me there?
Making constructive use of resistance
Resistance is not futile — when questioned! A good way to respond to resis-
tance and turn it to your advantage is to be curious as to what’s going on and
why. Ask questions and explore possible answers about what could be making
you put on the brakes. This exploration works best if you and your treatment
provider work together. When you stop and use your curiosity, some very
good things can happen:
 You quit sparring with your therapist’s agenda and come back into col-
laboration (which doesn’t necessarily mean doing things her way!).
 You have a chance to find out about some meaningful concern that
simply hasn’t made it into your awareness before now.
 After you know what’s really bothering you about the road ahead, you can
make course corrections to take your worries into account. For example:
• You just need to move a little more slowly to be able to digest
what’s happening.
• You need to know that if you’re losing something by getting 
better, you can compensate for that loss in some other way. For
example, you’ve used restricting to say “no” to people. You need 
to know that you’ll be able to say “no” directly.
• You can change without becoming someone you no longer recog-
nize. What do you want to keep unchanged in yourself?
• If you tell your friend you’re angry at her, as your therapist sug-
gests, won’t she just drop you? Maybe you need to experiment
with smaller challenges of speaking up first to gain confidence in
yourself and the friendship.
 Exploring moments of resistance allows you to know yourself better.
When you understand what’s making you tick, you can respond to 
yourself more effectively.
227
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

Rebounding from Relapse
Being successful in recovery doesn’t mean never relapsing, that is, going back
to eating disordered behaviors. Successful recovery means finding ways to
manage relapses when they occur. In this section I tell you more about relapse
and take you through the steps of managing relapse episodes.
The risk of relapse is sharply increased for people who leave treatment before
dealing with the underlying issues that make up a full recovery process. For
information on how to address these issues and avoid this pitfall, see the 
earlier section, “Building the Habits and Skills of Recovery.”
Distinguishing big ones from little ones
Not all relapses are created equal. Some people binge once or restrict a little,
and then get right back on their recovery track, and that’s that. Addiction
experts don’t even call this a relapse. They call these minor episodes from
which you rebound quickly slips. It is also typical for people in recovery to
spend days, weeks, or months revisiting old eating disorder behavior. In the
worst case, the partial relapse of these visits can put you back where you
started. This is called total relapse.
Total relapse, as you might guess, is a lot harder to return from than partial
relapses or slips. Researchers at the University of Toronto found that rebound
time makes a big difference when it comes to partial relapse turning into total
relapse. In a study reported in Eating Disorders: The Journal of Treatment and
Prevention, people who got back on track from relapse within six to eight
weeks were likely to pick up their recovery again successfully. On the other
hand, people whose partial relapses lasted three months or more were very
likely to deteriorate into total relapses from which they did not rebound.
Thus, the sooner you get back on track, the better your chances of success.
Seeing relapse as part of getting better
It’s really, really important for you to understand that relapses are something
to expect in your recovery. Why? Because you, like the rest of us, are human
and will make mistakes. (Read more on this later in this chapter in the sec-
tion “Practicing imperfection; discovering middle ground.”) Why am I making
such a big deal of this? Because your mindset about relapse has everything
to do with how you handle it and how likely you are to rebound.
Two basic mindsets make the most difference when it comes to relapse. The
first is your attitude about the relapse: What does it mean about you and
about your possibilities for getting better? The second important mindset is
228
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

your willingness and determination to gain new insights from the experience
of relapse. I go over these two mindsets in the next sections.
Getting your head straight
A black-and-white, all-or-nothing way of thinking makes you more vulnerable
to developing an eating disorder (see Chapter 5). The same thinking pattern,
where things are all one way or another, can also make trouble if you’re trying
to cope with a relapse episode. People who have a hard time bouncing back
from relapse tend to tell themselves things like
 I’ve blown it now; I might as well keep going with my eating disorder.
 This proves it; I’ll never get better. Why even bother?
 I had 38 days (or 4 months) (or 2 years) of not bingeing or purging. This
ruins it.
When you know relapse episodes will be part of recovery, you can prepare
yourself to approach them differently. Here are some possibilities to get you
started developing positive responses to relapse:
 One mistake doesn’t blot out all the successes. I’ve got lots to take
credit for.
 What I’ll remember about this episode is how I responded to it effectively.
 I can gain new insights from this experience.
 I don’t have to be perfect to be okay.
 I don’t have to be perfect to be acceptable.
In thinking of positive ways to respond to relapse, you may find it helpful to
think of what you’d say to a friend in a similar situation. Chances are you
wouldn’t be nearly as harsh with someone else as you are with yourself.
Using relapse to gain new insights
When you experience a relapse of any size, the best way to avoid doing it
again is to seek to understand what triggered this one. With the help of your
therapist and/or support group, examine what was going on: Why did it
happen now? Why not last week or next month? What was going on that
made you more vulnerable at that particular moment?
Think of relapse as a chance to find out more about your relapse triggers. If
you know what’s likely to trigger relapse behavior, you can work on improv-
ing your prevention and rebound skills.
229
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

By far the most common trigger for relapse is some kind of emotional experi-
ence. Let’s say you figure out that your relapse episode started when you were
either very depressed or very angry. That tells you two important things:
 You need to step up your work for managing the depression or anger.
 You need to be on the lookout when those emotions are triggered in you.
If you know you’re more at risk for relapse behavior when, for example, you’re
depressed or angry, you can take pre-planned steps to help yourself manage
without relapse. Such steps might include
 Seeking support from friends, family, or fellow group members
 Talking to your sponsor if you are in a 12-step program
 Asking for additional treatment sessions with your therapist
 Working with emotion management tools you’ve already discovered
 Increasing self-soothing practices
Relapse can also be a signal about some aspect of your recovery process,
providing you with some useful direction. A relapse may highlight some area
of recovery you haven’t been ready to take on until now. But now you may
need to focus on that area for your recovery to move forward. Following are
some examples of what your relapse may be telling you:
 It may be time to work on expressing yourself instead of swallowing
your feelings.
 Perhaps the time has come to start setting better limits with family
boundary intrusions.
 Your treatment process may be moving too fast, in which case you need
to slow down.
The big message here is that the only way relapse can be a failure is if you
refuse to explore the reasons for it and rebound from it. Some of your biggest
growth spurts can follow a relapse.
Knowing steps to take when relapse occurs
So you’ve had a relapse episode. You feel horrible and you probably aren’t
thinking all that clearly. Only one thing matters right now: Do whatever you
can to get back on track with your recovery as soon as possible. The follow-
ing do’s and don’ts can steer you in the right direction:
230
Part II: Getting Well: Exploring Recovery and Treatment Options 

 Don’t do any of your old eating disordered behavior to compensate. It
will only dig you in deeper and extend the relapse.
• Don’t fast.
• Don’t diet.
• Don’t purge.
 Don’t isolate yourself.
 Don’t berate yourself.
 Don’t ignore the episode, believing that’s the best way to move past it.
 Do take any step you can to normalize your eating as soon as possible.
Most importantly, eat the next meal you would normally eat.
 Do talk to people on your treatment team and those who are supportive
of your efforts immediately. It will help you contain the episode and begin
to put it into perspective.
 Do start your thinking process about what happened. Understanding
what happened will also help you get perspective. Do this work with
your individual or group therapist if your blame gremlins are too likely
to take over when you work alone.
 Do remember you actually can pick up wherever you left off with your
recovery, weaving in whatever knowledge you gain from the relapse.
Practicing imperfection
Working on recovery is working on living. When you work on coming back
from a relapse, you’re working on something you share with all your fellow
humans: how to live with being imperfect. Fighting the facts of human imper-
fection, as you tried to do with your eating disorder, didn’t go so well. Relapse,
with the support of your recovery team, can be a great opportunity to try a
new approach: embracing, or at least accepting, imperfection.
If you’ve instilled a very harsh internal critic, she’s going to have trouble with
newfangled ideas involving less than all-or-nothing standards regarding per-
formance and mistake-making. Part of your recovery work is to help your
internal critic develop a more mature and human outlook. But what do you
do in the meantime while your critic is growing up? This is a great time to be
drawing on the resources of friends, group members, therapists — anyone
whose approach to mistake-making you admire or find helpful. For example,
you can think, “What would Emily say if she were here? What would she do if
she were in my shoes? What would my group say if I told them about this?”
Do this enough and the approach will become almost automatic!
231
Chapter 14: Managing Early Stage Recovery and the Reality of Relapse

When you’ve lived most of your life in the land of black-and-white and all-or-
nothing, discovering that territory in the middle actually exists can be a real
eye-opener. You won’t trust it at first because it may seem like swampland
that disappears under your feet when you try to put your weight on it. You’ll
probably want to experiment a little rather than jumping in from the high
dive! Exploring the part of middle ground that’s about making mistakes and
being imperfect is a good-enough place to stick your toe in.
Imagine that instead of flying on a plane from Completely Perfect to Complete
Failure, you get on a bike to ride from one place to the other, so you can see
every stop along the way. Take a minute now to picture the trip. Make sure
not to miss those special attractions along the way, such as
 Great Effort, Needs Some Fine-Tuning
 Parts of That Went Really Well, Others Not So Well
 Wow! That Was a Courageous Try. What a Great Risk-Taker!
All of these valuable stops are accessible when you decide to inhabit middle
ground. As you continue to experiment with landing there instead of at the
extreme ends, you’ll find that the ground is, in fact, a lot more solid than in
all-or-nothing land. And you’ll feel a lot more secure when you aren’t trying 
to live somewhere humans were never meant to live.

Part III
Eating Disorders 
in Special
Populations

In this part . . .
I
delve into the special issues and concerns of six “minor-
ity” groups within the world of people with eating disor-
ders: men, athletes, people in fashion and entertainment,
children, the middle-aged and elderly, and people who are
obese. I tell you what increases eating disorder risk for
people in each group and what’s needed to reduce risk. 
For instance, you find that athletes are greatly affected 
by certain qualities in the sports they choose and by their
coaches. I also report on some surprising trends. For exam-
ple, little boys and older men develop anorexia at much
higher rates than young men do. And middle-aged women
are developing eating disorders at increasing rates as they
struggle to stay thin to look young.
For each group, I discuss special considerations for eating
disorder treatment. This may include specific issues for
treatment, difficulties in diagnosis, or choosing the best
form of therapy.

Chapter 15
Eating Disorders in Males
In This Chapter
 Seeing how eating disorders affect men
 Identifying what makes males at risk
 Getting a diagnosis and finding suitable treatment
A
male with an eating disorder is thought to be a rarity. Sudden weight
loss in a man is usually assumed to be due to something like depres-
sion, drug abuse, or AIDS. If a male tanks up on the buffet line or downs an
entire pizza alone, he’s not binge eating, he’s just following the popular adage
that boys will be boys.
These misconceptions are just a few of the many that abound regarding males
and eating disorders. In this chapter I set the record straight with current
information. I also review the major risk factors that make a male vulnerable
to developing an eating disorder. And finally, I consider some issues specific to
males when it comes to treatment.
Recognizing That Guys Suffer 
from Eating Disorders, Too!
A lot more men have eating disorders than you may guess. As many as a mil-
lion men in the United States are said to have an eating disorder. The latest
research from Harvard University Medical School suggests that up to 25 per-
cent of American adults with eating disorders are men.
Women still have the edge when it comes to anorexia and bulimia. Only about
5 to 10 percent of people with these disorders are male. But estimates indi-
cate that as many as 40 percent of people with binge eating disorder (BED)
are men. Some put the percentages for men even higher.

Eating disorders in men 
are on the upswing
More than ever, men are being diagnosed with eating disorders and request-
ing treatment. The increase has been particularly noticeable in the last
decade. During the same time period, men have also been reporting greater
and greater dissatisfaction with their bodies — an important risk factor for
developing an eating disorder. Body dissatisfaction used to be women’s turf,
but men are encroaching on that territory.
Cultural observers believe the gap between men and women is closing because
social pressures on men to achieve an ideal body type have increased. Women
have long been encouraged to think that they can endlessly perfect their
bodies with diet, exercise, surgery, and other remedies. Advertising, magazine
articles, and model images now tell men the same thing.
Seeing how men and women differ 
in terms of eating disorders
Generally speaking, eating disorders in men look a lot like eating disorders in
women. The symptom pictures are quite similar; for example, fear of fat, dis-
torted body image, a narrowing of life focus to body/weight goals, and so on
are present in both genders. So are the underlying psychological dynamics
fueling the disorder — for example, worth that is based on weight and shape,
perfectionism, obsessive-compulsive features, and so forth.
Men and women part ways when it comes to the body changes they’re aiming
at and what these changes mean to them. Whereas women focus on becom-
ing thin, men focus on becoming buff. The perfect male body has zero fat and
its V-shaped, bigger-is-better muscular distribution is marked by huge biceps
and “six-pack” abs. Women fear fat because it makes them unattractive. Men
fear fat because it makes them appear flabby and weak.
Half of men who are dissatisfied with their bodies want to lose weight while
the other half want to gain. What these two camps have in common is that,
for the most part, both are aiming at the bulked-up cultural ideal. Steroid use
to help achieve this muscular perfection is an essentially male addition to the
scary things people can do when driven by eating-disordered thinking. (You
can read more about how a fixation on bulking up affects men in the sidebar,
“Getting into gear on reverse anorexia.”)
236
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Other differences exist in the ways that men and women experience each of
the three major eating disorders: anorexia, bulimia, and BED. These differ-
ences (by disorder) include
 Anorexia: In men, starvation lowers levels of testosterone. This appears
to have the immediate effect of killing libido. In some men, it may have
lasting effects on their fertility even when their weight is restored.
 Bulimia: Men are less likely to purge and more likely to rely on compen-
satory behavior, like cutting calories or compulsive exercising.
 BED: Men who binge are generally less upset about their behavior than
women who binge. Women feel shame in the act of bingeing, while men
save their shameful feelings for the effect bingeing has on their bodies;
males eat without shame, yet are embarrassed by the fat that results.
Uncovering Risk Factors for 
Eating Disorders in Males
What makes one man more at risk than another for developing an eating dis-
order? In some instances, the risk factors are the same as for women. Other
risk factors have a particularly male stamp. In this section I review what’s
currently known about what puts men at risk for eating disorders. Keep in
mind that men with eating disorders are still an understudied group, so some
of this information is based on the best guesses of experts rather than defini-
tive studies.
Psychological factors
Internal vulnerabilities — personal characteristics that make you more sus-
ceptible to developing an eating disorder — are pretty much the same for
men as they are for women. Internal vulnerabilities include personality traits
like the following:
 Low self-esteem
 Perfectionism
 Problems managing emotions
 Need for external approval
237
Chapter 15: Eating Disorders in Males

Men with eating disorders also show companion psychological disorders at
rates similar to those displayed by women. Psychological disorders that 
commonly accompany eating disorders in men include the following:
 Anxiety
 Depression
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
 Substance abuse
Whether these disorders predispose a man to an eating disorder or whether
something else causes both of them is hard to tell. (You can read more about
vulnerability traits in Chapter 5 and companion disorders in Chapter 7.)
238
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 
Getting into gear on reverse anorexia
Reverse anorexia, also called muscle dysmor-
phia or bigorexia, is a condition in which a 
man, regardless of his muscle mass, imagines
himself weak and under-muscled. This body
image distortion is very similar to the person
with anorexia who imagines herself fat, no
matter what her weight. The person with reverse
anorexia becomes obsessed with bulking up. 
He takes any and every measure to build more
muscle. This probably includes extremes in his
exercise routine, where he favors weight train-
ing over aerobics. He’s also likely to be using
dietary supplements touted by an unregulated —
and therefore risky — market.
Increasingly, bulking up involves the use of ana-
bolic steroids. Steroids increase muscle mass
and physical strength and reduce body fat, but
the downside far outweighs these benefits.
Using steroids too much or for too long can
damage your liver and lead to liver cancer.
Steroids also increase your risk for heart dis-
ease, heart attack, or stroke, and they appear to
produce irritability and other negative mood
effects (not to mention acne and enlarged
breasts).
Reverse anorexia has a lot in common with com-
pulsive exercise, which I explore in Chapter 7.
The person with reverse anorexia is driven to his
weight training with the same obsessional
energy as the compulsive exerciser. Bulking up,
like losing weight or keeping up an aerobic rou-
tine, comes before well-being or responsibilities
to others. If you suspect you may have reverse
anorexia, ask yourself if any of the following are
true of your weight training:
 I’ve risked my health with unproven supple-
ments and steroids to enhance my strength.
 I’ve risked injury with overtraining.
 I’ve risked my social life, school perfor-
mance, or job by repeatedly putting my
workouts first.
 I can’t feel good about myself unless I like
the shape my body is in.
 I never think I’m in good enough shape, no
matter what anyone says.

Biographical factors
Your background may have an impact on your likelihood of developing an
eating disorder. Two factors that stand out as eating disorder risks in women’s
backgrounds also stand out in the backgrounds of men. These risk factors are
 Family history: Certain family styles appear to pose a greater risk for
eating disorder development than others. Overly rule-bound or over-
organized families appear more often in the histories of people with
anorexia. Underorganized families lack the structure needed to support
and protect family members sufficiently. Many people with bulimia
describe underorganized family histories.
 Trauma history: People with eating disorders have more than their fair
share of trauma in their histories. This is apparently true of men as well
as women. Trauma includes physical and sexual abuse, neglect, and 
catastrophic loss. It also includes a caregiver’s chronic failure to respond
sensitively to a child’s emotional needs.
For more information regarding these risk factors, turn to Chapter 5. I describe
the effects of various family styles and trauma history on eating disorders in
greater detail there.
A third biographical risk factor appears to be exclusive to men. Unlike their
female counterparts, many men with eating disorders report being overweight
or obese in childhood. A number of these men remember being teased, made
a scapegoat, or left out because of their weight. Not surprisingly, these men
may develop a lot of shame related to their body image, although this kind of
body shame is still more typical of women than men in our culture.
Body dissatisfaction
Dissatisfaction with body size or shape can be a powerful motivator to diet or
take other corrective action. In men who have low self-esteem and believe
they need to be perfect to be acceptable, body dissatisfaction can be a lethal
weapon, leading vulnerable men to eating disordered behaviors to “fix” 
themselves.
Men engage in exactly the same dangerous ED behaviors as women. The only
thing that’s different — and it’s not exclusively male — is bulking up. I discuss
it in the sidebar on reverse anorexia.
Men are being subjected to increasing media pressure to look like an ideal
body shape and size. As the pressure increases, so does male body dissatis-
faction. Body mass index (BMI) is a far more reliable (and achievable) indica-
tor of health than are the images projected by the media.
239
Chapter 15: Eating Disorders in Males

Dieting habits
Dieting is a well-known risk factor for developing an eating disorder. (See
Chapter 5 for more about this.) Both men and women are more likely to diet
when they are unhappy about their body shape or size. The biggest social
pressures are still on women when it comes to being thin. But the heat is
increasingly on men. Certain subgroups of men — for example, athletes or
the overweight — feel the heat even more. As these groups jump on board
the dieting bandwagon, their risk levels go up.
Thinning down for sports
Sports in which thinness helps you excel are famous gateways to eating disor-
ders (see Chapter 16, “Athletes and Eating Disorders”). Sports that extol being
thin include wrestling, running, swimming, gymnastics, being a jockey, and so
on. In an all-too-common story, a guy who’s never had an eating disorder on his
mind fasts a few days to “make weight.” It works. To ensure ongoing success,
the fast becomes a necessary ritual. However, fasting requires more and more
effort over time. It also takes a greater effort to get to the next level. The result
is a guy who’s regularly fasting, obsessing over what he eats, and engaging in
dangerous exercise practices (such as excessive exercise, exercising while fast-
ing, or exercising to the point of injury) to keep his weight under control.
Being gay
It’s estimated that as many as 20 percent of the males with eating disorders
are gay. Nobody knows enough to say whether specific characteristics of
being a gay male actually increase your risk for an eating disorder. Many
guess that a greater emphasis on appearance in the gay community plays an
important role. In fact, surveys find that pressure to achieve an ideal body
type among gay men is second only to that experienced by heterosexual
women in Western cultures.
Gaining Awareness of Special 
Issues for Treatment
All studies so far suggest that men respond as well as women to sound eating
disorder treatment, and that they need the same kinds of treatment programs
to recover. Men have a good chance of recovery if they follow through with
treatment. Specifically, men need to
240
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

 Regain a healthy weight if they’ve been starving
 Establish normal eating habits
 Reduce bingeing and purging
 Receive treatment for companion disorders
 Stay in treatment to build a strong recovery repertoire
While many elements are the same between males and females with eating
disorders, a couple of factors compound the problem for men. Men are less
likely to be diagnosed than women, and when they are, they’re faced with the
challenge of trying to fit into treatment programs designed for women. I dis-
cuss both these issues in this section.
Escaping diagnosis
Men often suffer with their eating disorders for years before anyone catches
on. This matters because the longer an eating disorder has been around, the
harder it is to treat. Delayed treatment is especially serious for anorexia suf-
ferers because the risk of death steadily increases with anorexia over time.
Why are men able to fly under the radar when it comes to eating disorders?
Simply because many people don’t know that men can get eating disorders,
including the men who become entrapped by them. The affected men and
those around them aren’t on the alert for symptoms and warning signs. This
is true at every level at which someone might identify the disorder, starting
with the man himself. These levels include
 The individual man with the eating disorder: Men haven’t been exposed
to the prevention blitz women have, nor has the media paraded male
celebrities with eating disorders. If a man has anorexia, denial is part of
the program. If he’s bingeing, an eating disorder isn’t the first place his
mind goes to explain his excesses. Bingeing can be dismissed as a guy
thing. Men with bulimia are less likely to purge in obvious ways, like by
vomiting or using laxatives. They’re more likely to restrict or exercise
compulsively. The bottom line: A man can easily remain clueless about
his own eating disorder for a long time.
 Family and friends: These are often the people who challenge women
they love with eating disorders to recognize the problem and get treat-
ment. Men are less likely to share weight and eating problems with family
or friends, as women frequently do.
 Medical professionals: Studies have shown that doctors are likely 
to explain visible symptoms, like weight loss, in ways other than an
eating disorder. Depression, drug abuse, and AIDS are more common
explanations.
241
Chapter 15: Eating Disorders in Males

The point here isn’t that anyone is being negligent or uncaring. Male eating
disorders simply haven’t yet made it onto our collective radar screens. When
you start trying to account for symptoms or behavior changes in yourself or
a man you know, eating disorders aren’t likely to appear in your mental reper-
tory of possible causes.
Another reason men may go undiagnosed for their eating disorders is that
they’re hesitant to come forward and admit them when they do realize what’s
going on. The popular view is that eating disorders are women’s disorders.
Men often fear ridicule or being pegged as weak or homosexual if they have a
“women’s disorder.” These fears just amplify the usual shame and secrecy
associated with having an eating disorder.
Being male in a treatment 
world set up for women
If you’re a man with an eating disorder and you overcome the obstacles of
shame and ignorance regarding the need for treatment, you step into a world
that’s been set up for women. This is true for just about any group-based
component to your program: residential treatment, partial hospital, intensive
outpatient program (IOP) group therapy, or a support group.
Some of these programs literally exclude men. In the others, a man is certain
to be a minority. This means by tradition and by numbers, the female perspec-
tive, which is so crucial to understanding female eating disorders, is going to
get a lot of air time. In female-dominated groups, some men feel like outsiders
at the very time they most need to feel shared understanding.
Some argue that the underlying issues are more similar than different for men
and women with eating disorders. By this argument, sharing recovery work is
okay and even beneficial — men and women need to understand each others’
points of view.
Others argue that being a man with an eating disorder involves gender-specific
issues — issues such as body image, uniquely male physical effects of eating
disorders, sexuality, and the like — that men can more easily talk about in an
all-male group or program. This argument is largely moot because such pro-
grams hardly exist. However, as male eating disorders come increasingly into
focus, hopefully more services will become geared specifically to men in the
future.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the increased eating disorder risk for athletes
 Reviewing the special risks for women and for men
 Recognizing signs of an eating disorder in your child athlete
 Identifying coaching styles that can help or hurt
 Getting guidelines for treating the athlete with an eating disorder
T
o be a good athlete requires qualities such as a high level of discipline,
perfectionism, a drive to excel, and a commitment to exercise. Sound
familiar? These same qualities can also make a person vulnerable to develop-
ing an eating disorder. In fact, athletes appear to suffer eating disorders at a
greater rate than non-athletes.
Not every nook and cranny of the sports world presents the same level of
risk for the eating disorder–vulnerable athlete. Some sports environments
magnify the risk, while others buffer and minimize it. In this chapter you find
out what the most important influences are. I also go over some unique quali-
ties of the risks for women and for men, and I offer a list of warning signs to
help parents recognize when their child athlete may be at risk for an eating
disorder. I review guidelines for treatment, focusing on the question you most
want answered: When can I compete again?
Running a Greater Risk 
for Eating Disorders
Over the last 25 years, weight and eating problems have been on the rise
among athletes. This goes for everyone from the elite professional to the 
college or high school competitor, all the way down to the guy at the corner
gym. How widespread is the problem and why is it worse for athletes? I
explore the answers in this section.

Studies show that from 15 to 25 percent of athletes have eating disorders.
Risk for bulimia appears to be greater than risk for anorexia. Estimates for
disordered eating practices (fad dieting, fasting, purging, and so on) go as
high as 70 to 80 percent in some groups of athletes. Certain qualities of the
sports world and of athletes themselves increase the risk for individuals to
develop disordered eating practices and full-blown eating disorders.
Magnifying cultural pressures for thinness
If you’re an athlete, you’re exposed to the same cultural pressures for achiev-
ing an ideal body size as the rest of us. Additionally, the hothouse of athletic
competition has two particular ways of magnifying these pressures:
 Sports that emphasize appearance: These include figure skating, cheer-
leading, and gymnastics.
 Sports in which the athlete or coach believes low body fat improves
performance: These include track, distance running, and swimming.
Imagine an athlete who’s starting out with the kind of self-doubts that make
anyone prone to an eating disorder. Now add an athlete’s constant search for
the competitive edge. Offer her either of the preceding two reasons for focus-
ing on her weight and becoming dissatisfied with her body. You now have a
very potent brew for disordered eating practices to control weight. These prac-
tices place a person at higher risk for developing a full-blown eating disorder.
Thinness does not equal fitness. Evidence does not support the notion that
lower body fat always promotes better sports performance. Thinness can
even impair performance in some instances.
Tipping positive traits into bad results
Many of the same qualities that help you become a competitive athlete are
surprisingly similar to traits associated with eating disorders, particularly
anorexia. These include
 Discipline, persistence
 Perfectionism
 Self-sacrifice (taking one for the team, putting your own needs aside)
 Compliance (for example, with coaching)
 Exercise commitment
244
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

As researchers point out, coaches and others see these traits as assets in an
athlete. This view makes it that much harder to identify when these traits
actually signal an underlying eating disorder.
Identifying higher-risk sports
Some sports present a higher risk for developing disordered eating and eating
disorders than others. The following sports present the highest risk:
 Endurance sports: Examples include running, swimming, and cycling.
 Judged sports: In these sports, appearance may enter into the judges’
scoring. Examples are figure skating, gymnastics, and diving.
 Sports with weight categories: Examples include wrestling, horse racing
and rowing.
 Sports in which clothes reveal the female body: Examples are figure
skating, tennis, and gymnastics.
 Sports that emphasize an ideal appearance: Examples include gymnas-
tics and bodybuilding.
A study suggests that refereed sports, such as volleyball, basketball, and
soccer, may actually have some protective effect on the body-image concerns
of participating athletes. In these sports, appearance has no effect on outcome.
245
Chapter 16: Athletes and Eating Disorders
Boning up on bodybuilding
Bodybuilding appears to be a sport that acts like
a magnet for men and women who already have
eating disorders or who run the risk of develop-
ing them. The lure is to use the sport to sculpt
the body to an ideal shape. It’s irresistible to
many people at both competitive and noncom-
petitive levels who are preoccupied with body
perfection as a measure of worth.
Dieting is extremely common among bodybuilders.
It may get even more emphasis because you do a
lot of standing still instead of aerobic running
around that burns off calories. Dieting, combined
with body-image preoccupation, perfectionism,
and a drive to be thin, makes a lethal brew for
eating disorder development. All these ingredients
are present with dedicated bodybuilders in a sport
that aims at perfecting body shape and size. Male
bodybuilders can also develop preoccupations
with bulking up to build a perfect muscular
physique. Bodybuilders of both sexes show high
rates of disordered eating behavior.

Focusing on Female Athletes
If sports magnify cultural pressures for thinness, they also magnify the fact
that these pressures still fall most heavily on women. Studies suggest a
female athlete is about nine times as likely to develop an eating disorder as 
a male athlete. Sports that emphasize having a lean body, such as swimming,
distance running, and gymnastics, contribute more than their fair share. At
least twice as many women participating in these sports end up with eating
disorders as those participating in non-lean sports, such as basketball.
If you’re a female athlete, you face some uniquely female health risks from
combining athletics and disordered eating. These risks are collectively called
the female athlete triad.
Falling victim to the female athlete triad
The female athlete triad describes what many consider to be a subclinical eating
disorder — one that doesn’t meet the definition of a full-blown disorder — with
the female athlete’s name on it. The triad includes
 Disordered eating: Risky eating practices, like fasting, grapefruit diet-
ing, or purging, are considered disordered eating. The female athlete
may turn to these practices as a remedy when she’s faced with outside
pressures to lose weight and/or internal fears about the effect of weight
on her looks or performance.
 Loss of menstrual periods (amenorrhea): This signals too little of the
sex hormones, like estrogen, necessary to produce a menstrual cycle.
(Your reproductive system just shuts down when your body’s energy
supplies fall too low.) Note: Estrogen is also necessary to build new bone.
 Osteoporosis (loss of bone density): When bones lack the material to
rebuild themselves, they become porous, weak, and prone to fracture.
Recognizing the results of the triad
If you’re failing to resupply your body’s energy needs and/or you’re purging,
you’re going to see your sports performance fall off eventually. This is due to
 Loss of muscle mass, muscle strength
 Weakness, fatigue, lowered pulse
 Stress fractures and other injuries
 Heart irregularities, heart failure
 Dehydration
246
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Some athletes, through sheer grit, can overcome these effects for a time. But
this only feeds the fantasy that you can rob your body of nutrition indefinitely
without damage. (I discuss the physical effects of starvation and purging in
more detail in Chapter 6.)
Losing the body’s natural rhythms
Loss of menstrual periods has been mistakenly taken by many female ath-
letes and their coaches as a sign of well-disciplined training. It’s not. It’s a
warning sign of something wrong with your body. Loss of menstrual periods
may be sports-related — due to overtraining, an energy drain caused by dis-
ordered eating, or stress — or it may have other causes, such as pituitary or
adrenal problems, even tumors. Just because menstrual loss is common
doesn’t make it safe. If you’ve lost your periods, see your doctor.
Losing bone mass
Osteoporosis is usually a postmenopausal woman’s problem. When a young
woman doesn’t eat enough, her body robs minerals from her bones and
osteoporosis can develop early. The big problem with this arrangement is
that it occurs in female athletes during what should be peak years for build-
ing up bone density. The years from age 12 to 30 (on average) are bone-banking
years for women. You create a large account you can draw on later when
your body starts producing less estrogen. If you’re suffering from the female
athlete triad, you’re drawing down your account just at the time you should
be building it up. There’s no replacing it later.
Measuring Risk for Male Athletes
Do the same sports create eating disorder risk for male athletes as for female
athletes? Generally speaking, the answer is yes. (However, one sport, wrestling,
is snaring surprising numbers of male athletes into disordered eating prac-
tices and eating disorder risk. See the sidebar “Wrestling: Where disordered
eating is part of the drill” for details.)
Male athletes are at risk for sports-related weight and eating problems just
like females, even if in smaller numbers. An Australian study found that 5 per-
cent of men participating in “thin” sports, such as cross country or swimming,
showed full-blown eating disorders. Experts believe the numbers of male ath-
letes with eating disorders is actually far underreported.
Men, like women, are likely to diet restrictively, fast, or purge in order to look
better or perform better in sports that emphasize thinness. Male athletes
also binge, sometimes after a period of restricting or as a way to manage the
stresses and disappointments of competition.
247
Chapter 16: Athletes and Eating Disorders

Recognizing an Eating Disorder 
in a Child Athlete
Food and exercise routines are common elements of sports training. You
expect them to be different than the routines of non-athletes, especially at
higher levels of competition. Knowing when a special routine becomes a 
dangerous and disordered one isn’t always easy for parents, trainers, and
coaches. Here are some signs to look out for:
 Chronic dieting: Dieting behavior always poses a risk. When it becomes
a way of life, it’s a sign of high risk.
 Excessive weight loss: Small weight losses can be a normal side effect of
starting a sport. Let your pediatrician guide you if you’re concerned.
 Constantly moving the weight loss goal posts: If no amount of weight
loss is ever enough, consider this an eating disorder red flag.
 Excessive exercise: Exercise that interferes with other activities, results
in fatigue or injury, takes up more and more of each day, or can’t be put
off for illness is excessive.
248
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 
Wrestling: Where disordered 
eating is part of the drill
Wrestling is a high-risk sport for male athletes
when it comes to eating disorders. It has actu-
ally claimed lives at competitive levels due to
athletes’ extreme weight loss efforts. Most of
the risk comes from a common practice called
cutting weight. Cutting weight means shaving
off several pounds or more before a match
weigh-in. The idea is to qualify for a lower
weight category so you can compete against a
smaller guy and have the advantage.
Wrestlers use every kind of disordered eating
practice to cut weight before a match (not to
mention “thermal” methods like exercising in
rubber suits to sweat off more pounds). As a
result, they can face potentially fatal heart 
and kidney problems from dehydration and the
muscle-wasting effects of rapid weight loss.
Many wrestlers follow the deprivation of “cut-
ting” with bouts of bingeing. A wrestler might
cut and binge repeatedly during a wrestling
season. Most wrestlers can return to normal
eating during the off-season. But many can’t.
Those who can’t are at high risk for developing
eating disorders.
Women who wrestle engage in disordered
eating practices to cut weight before matches,
too; thus, they’re as likely as men to be at risk
for developing eating disorders. So far, women
aren’t wrestling in numbers that put the sport
high on the list of female athlete eating disorder
risks. In contrast, wrestling may produce nearly
three quarters of the eating disorders that occur
among male athletes.

 Compensatory exercise: This is exercising to make up for eating — even
normal eating.
 Delay or loss of menstrual periods in girls: Missing periods always war-
rant medical evaluation. Malnutrition, stress, and excessive exercise are
common causes in female athletes.
 Frequent sports-related injuries: These are a sign that something’s
wrong; they’re often a sign of malnutrition and/or excessive exercise.
 Frequent leg cramping in practice or competition: Muscle cramps are
often a sign of dehydration due to insufficient nutrients or purging.
 Evidence of purging: Evidence may include signs of diuretic or laxative
use for weight loss. Making a beeline for the bathroom (to vomit) after
eating is another sign.
Scoring with the Right Coach
Sports experts agree that the person with his finger on the pulse when it
comes to athletes and eating disorders is the coach. A coach advises the ath-
lete what she needs to do to achieve. He tells her how to think about herself
in relation to her athletic accomplishments. His voice carries special weight
in the lives of young athletes.
The qualities of different coaching styles appear to have the biggest effect on
athletes when it comes to risk for developing or avoiding eating disorders.
Consider the styles of the following types of coaches:
 The weight-critic coach: This is the coach who makes open comments,
usually in front of teammates, about individual weight. He uses humilia-
tion as a motivator. These tactics match the way a person with an eating
disorder, or someone at risk for one, already views herself.
 The win-focused coach: This is the coach who conveys to the athlete
that winning is everything. The athlete who’s a perfectionist, struggling
with self-worth, is already at risk for harming herself, and she’s even
more likely to do so if she thinks it’s required in order to win.
 The accentuate-the-negative coach: This is the coach who only notices
what’s wrong in an athlete’s performance. This just reinforces eating dis-
ordered thinking, whereby you’re only okay when you get it right.
 The athlete-focused coach: This is the coach who’s most interested in
helping individual athletes develop their fullest potential. Safety and
well-being come before winning. This is the opposite of eating disor-
dered thinking.
249
Chapter 16: Athletes and Eating Disorders

 The eating disorder–informed coach: This is a coach who
• Recognizes that low weight and low body fat are unproven as per-
formance enhancers.
• Recognizes the signs of disordered eating and eating disorders.
• Understands the risks of disordered eating behaviors and the
severe consequences of eating disorders.
• Knows how and when to refer an athlete for help.
Tackling Special Issues for Treatment
The biggest issue added to your plate if you’re an athlete facing eating disor-
der treatment is whether your sport and your treatment can go on at the same
time. The most basic answer is: not if sports participation compromises your
eating disorder recovery.
In their book, Helping Athletes with Eating Disorders, Ron A. Thompson and
Roberta Trattner Sherman offer guidelines to help decide when participation
for the eating disordered athlete is okay. For example:
 An athlete who refuses evaluation or recommended treatment should be
suspended.
 An athlete whose weight is less than 90 percent of the recommended
weight should not compete.
 When training practices compete with treatment, treatment comes first.
 Sports activities that put the athlete’s physical or psychological health
at risk are out of bounds.
 If some lower level of participation is possible for the athlete who has
been sidelined, this can help her hold onto her sports identity, pride,
and sense of belonging.
Thompson and Sherman make this important additional point about being an
athlete in eating disorder treatment: Many of the same qualities that make for
eating disorder vulnerability and sports success — determination, discipline,
focus, follow-through — can also make for recovery success.

In This Chapter
 Reviewing the risk for eating disorders among dancers, models, and actors
 Understanding how professional requirements for thinness promote eating disorders
 Recognizing the importance of reducing environmental pressures for thinness
F
emale dancers, models, and actors run elevated risks for developing
eating disorders. Is there something about the training and the profes-
sions themselves that create this elevated risk? In this chapter I explore how
the qualities necessary for success in these fields often overlap with qualities
that contribute to greater risk for eating disorders. An even bigger problem is
that being abnormally thin is often necessary to advance and get jobs. This
magnifies ordinary environmental pressures to be thin many times over.
Tragic eating disorder–related deaths have led to a close look at contributing
pressures and practices within each field. I go over some of the steps aimed
at reform along with some expert recommendations for further reducing
eating disorder risk. Finally, I suggest some ways parents of child dancers,
models, and actors can magnify or buffer the excessive pressures for thin-
ness to which their children are exposed.
Discovering the Risks Behind the Scenes
Performing artists face more intense pressures to maintain exceptionally thin
or fat-free bodies by the very nature of their craft. For too long, the industries
surrounding dancers, models, and actors have turned a blind eye to this seri-
ous problem. This effect is amplified by teachers, audiences and sometimes
families taking the same position. As a result, the numbers of performing
artists affected by eating disorders are staggeringly high.

Facing daily pressures to be thin
Dancing, modeling, and acting each have their own special twist on the way
the pressures for being thin come up. All have an effect on the lives of both
aspiring and working participants in these fields.
Dancing on thin ice
Dancers usually begin rigorous training in childhood, preparing their bodies
to become precision instruments. Dancer/therapist Linda H. Hamilton, PhD,
says that puberty throws a monkey wrench into the precision by adding a
surge of extra fat for girls.
Why does normal fat have such an adverse effect? First of all, the dance world,
particularly ballet, prefers a curve-free preadolescent body. Second, with her
new distribution of fat, a dancer has to relocate her center of gravity and
relearn how to be in carefully balanced positions. Third, she has to worry
about how added weight affects being lifted by another dancer. Adolescence
is already a time of higher risk for anorexia. Effects of weight on performance
and appearance, and thus success, make the risk among adolescent dancers
that much greater.
Modeling size zero
The last word on a particular modeling job comes from the designer and the
size of the sample she’s made to be worn down the runway. If it won’t zip on
your body, your body isn’t going down the runway in it. Just how small can
sample sizes go and what will the effect of microscopic sizes be?
These questions have been called the “size zero problem.” It refers to models
so small they fit into size zero clothing and to the way their images affect an
ordinary woman’s desire to become that small as well. (The main effect is to
make her very unhappy and possibly more prone to an eating disorder.) But
it seems to be an effect that boomerangs right back into the industry. As soon
as enough ordinary women decide that size zero is the perfect size to be, it
guides many a designer’s hand, and more and more models are presented
with impossibly small samples to fit into. (The industry is taking a close look
at banning actual size zero models from runways.)
Even if size zero is banned, other weight pitfalls exist. Many models work
internationally. Those who do can find themselves in weight zones that
change along with the time zones. Weight that’s fine in one city and country
can be considered too heavy in another. No one says, “I’m too heavy to work
in that country.” Instead, models try to shed the weight to get the job. Eating
disorder risk can bloom under these conditions.
252
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Acting out the role of thinness
For actors just getting into the business, the ingénue role is often the plum
female part. The ingénue is the young innocent. Directors, producers, and
audiences seem able to imagine her only as thin and attractive. Thus, the role
thinness plays with regard to aspiring actors is similar to the role it plays
with dancers. Thinness takes on career meaning at a time when young
women are already most likely to develop an eating disorder. A slightly older
actor who has paid the rent from ingénue roles but is starting to age out of
them often depends on maintaining an adolescent-thin body to help keep
those parts coming well into her twenties.
Even among established actors, gaining or losing significant amounts of weight
is sometimes required for a part. When an actor pulls this off, the public
tends to view it as a bit of acting heroics. But more than one actor has later
reported how making such a drastic change resulted in serious eating prob-
lems and disordered eating behavior. If you put an actor who’s already at risk
for an eating disorder through such an experience, you can have a perfect
storm.
Seeing more and more artists impacted
You’d think in this age of too much celebrity information, there’d be no end
of data about the prevalence of eating disorders among people in the per-
forming arts. In reality, only the dance world has been exposed to much in
the way of formal study. What the public knows about the rest relies more on
the reports of individual performers and, of course, on what it sees with its
own eyes (for example, gaunt models peering out of magazines or rail-thin
starlets on TV and movie screens).
Dancing into danger
According to dance expert Linda Hamilton, one in five female dancers is likely
to develop an eating disorder! Nearly half of female dancers have some type
of weight or eating problem. Eating disorder rates are highest in traditional
ballet compared to modern or jazz dancing, which are somewhat more forgiv-
ing for body size. A well-known study of ballet students by David Garner and
Paul Garfinkel found a mouth-dropping 25 percent to have anorexia. That’s
compared to a rate of 1 percent for anorexia in the general population. Patterns
of disordered eating that didn’t quite meet the strict criteria for anorexia or
bulimia showed up in another 11 percent of these young dancers.
253
Chapter 17: Eating Disorders on the Stage, Screen, and Runway

Modeling risky behavior
While no large-scale studies have been done with regard to eating disorders
among models, the profession presents all the elements of a high-risk group
(see the following section, “Considering Eating Disorders as Part of the Job”).
In a very small-scale study, researchers found that the models they surveyed
were engaging in disordered eating practices at rates higher than women in
the general population who were diagnosed with formal eating disorders.
Acting on confessions
Celebrity confessionals still substitute for actual research when it comes to
data about the stage and screen. Some actors, such as Jane Fonda, Tracey
Gold, and Jamie-Lynn Sigler, have been candid about their eating disorder
histories, often hoping to help others by sharing their experience. Most often,
as rumors abound about an actor or actress struggling with eating disorders,
denials are the byword of the day, in spite of photos that seem to imply a pos-
sible problem.
Considering Eating Disorders 
as Part of the Job
If you’re already vulnerable to an eating disorder (for example, because of
heredity or personality characteristics), environmental pressure makes for
important added risk. If you’re a dancer, model, or actor, you know that pres-
sures to be thin come from everywhere in your environment. The biggest
pressure, when all is said and done, is that you must be thin to get the job.
These pressures for thinness are woven into the professional lives of dancers,
models, and actors, creating high risk for eating disorders.
Focusing too much on the body
Excessive body preoccupation is part of having an eating disorder. But how
do you get away from it when your body is your professional equipment? This
is the dilemma in several ways for dancers, models, and actors. For starters,
people are intended to look at you. You might say being looked at is what you
do for a living. Second, before you ever do that first pirouette, strike that first
pose, or deliver that first line, your body is what the audience sees first.
Audiences usually have an opinion about what that body should look like
(hint: not overweight or average). Third, if you’re a performer or model, you
have to stay tuned-in constantly to your body shape and size. These factors
affect your performance if you’re a dancer, your “look” for potential parts if
you’re an actor, or your ability to fit the clothing if you’re a model.
254
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Being surrounded by thin role models
Every profession is its own small universe of norms, standards, and expecta-
tions. People coming into a profession are guided and inspired by others who
have already made it. These people become role models for what is accept-
able and what gets rewarded in their field. If you’re a dancer, model, or actor,
most of what you see modeled in your chosen field is thin — especially at 
the more successful end.
Not only are role models thin, but so is most of the competition. When you
have a lot of people competing for a limited number of slots, competition
cranks up to high gear. Anything that may give one person the competitive
edge over another becomes a source of comparison and anxiety. Insiders
describe a kind of contagion effect created by thin bodies and weight loss
practices. Once one person is known to be using an extreme diet or purging
behavior to lose weight, for example, a chain reaction of anxiety can result:
Should I be doing that, too?
Equating eating disorder 
qualities with success
In professions as demanding and competitive as dancing, modeling, and acting,
the following personal qualities may make the difference between success
and failure:
 Perfectionism: Only the best performance will do.
 Being driven toward a goal: This means seeing where you want to land
and letting nothing stand in the way, no matter what the personal cost.
 The ability to ignore personal discomfort in order to reach a goal: Being
able to switch off the connection to physical or mental discomfort is
often a requirement.
 A desire to please others: Instructors, casting directors, film directors,
and audiences all appreciate this ability to tune into and deliver what
another person wants.
Unfortunately, these very qualities, when combined with an environment that
strongly promotes exaggerated thinness, can be a recipe for developing an
eating disorder. If you’re a dancer, model, or actor who possesses these quali-
ties, you also need to have offsetting qualities to buffer yourself from eating
disorder risk. These include a strong sense of yourself, recognition of your
worth apart from what you do, and the ability to set a priority on your health
and well-being. Without these offsetting qualities, your risk for developing an
eating disorder sharply increases, even though you may be helping your
career in other ways.
255
Chapter 17: Eating Disorders on the Stage, Screen, and Runway

Getting direct pressure to be thin
Instructors, coaches, trainers, and, for that matter, agents and managers,
know the professional environments their artists or models are competing in
better than anyone. Many consider it part of their responsibility to help the
individual achieve the weight she needs to succeed. Some instructors are
famous for making weight commentary a humiliating part of class ritual.
In this environment, the teacher, coach, or other authority who bucks the
trend and provides a more moderate voice is truly valuable. As more informa-
tion about eating disorders makes its way into the performing and modeling
industries, more such enlightened authorities are springing up. Sometimes it
only takes one person to say the emperor has no clothes.
Making thinness a requirement to get jobs
If you’re a dancer, model, or actor, it’s a fact of life that in many cases the part
or job goes to the person with the slim body. Often it goes to someone with a
too-slim body, one well below what’s considered ideal weight. Putting career
success or failure into the mix takes environmental pressures to be thin to
another level. Studies have shown that athletes whose careers depend on
being thin, like jockeys, have sharply elevated rates of eating disorders. It’s
no stretch to imagine performers and models being affected similarly.
The lucky person who dreams of being a dancer, model, or actor was born
with the slim body type these industries favor (and hopefully some talent, to
boot!). The unlucky person has the same dreams but was given a body that
doesn’t naturally fit the mold. Imagine such a person also has personality
characteristics which make her vulnerable to an eating disorder. Add to that
respected voices in her field telling her a few pounds are all that stand between
her and her dreams. This performer or model is highly likely to do whatever
she thinks it takes to get the “extra” pounds off. Some in this situation achieve
their weight goals, but only at a terrible cost to their health and well-being.
Others find their bodies simply won’t be tortured into the desired size or
shape, no matter what measures they take. In both cases, chances for an
eating disorder are sharply increased.
Spotlighting Special Issues 
for Treating Performers
As a group, dancers, models, and actors face the same personal obstacles
and have the same assets to help them overcome eating disorders as anyone
else. The biggest problem for recovery related to being in one of these fields
256
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

is that a person’s success and very livelihood may depend on being too thin.
As part of an optimal recovery package, the environmental demands for thin-
ness need to be reduced. The entertainment and modeling industries are
responding to pressures for related changes. Parents of child dancers, models,
and actors need to be especially involved with their child performer.
Improving the work environment
People can and do recover from eating disorders in spite of overwhelming
environmental pressures. But in order to do the most to reduce eating disor-
der risk for these groups and enhance chances for eating disorder recovery,
the environmental level is the place to start. The focus needs to be on reduc-
ing the relentless pressure for thinness to which young dancers, models, and
actors are exposed.
Tragedies in the dance and modeling worlds have led to just this kind of
focus and the beginnings of change. Two high-profile runway models died as
a result of their eating disorders. A promising young ballet star may or may
not have died from the effects of her eating disorder. Unfortunately, it often
takes tragedy to trigger overdue change.
After the death of the second model, several centers of fashion took action. It
started with regulation of the Madrid and Milan Fashion Week runway shows.
Models now have to show a minimum body mass index (BMI). (BMI is a mea-
sure of body fat compared to height and weight. You can find a BMI chart and
an explanation for its use in Chapter 20.) Medical certificates showing BMI
are now a requirement to work.
The British Fashion Council set up an expert panel in 2007 to look at the effect
of industry working conditions and pressures on young models. They were
especially interested in what may cause greater risk for eating disorders. Most
of their recommendations had to do with raising awareness about eating dis-
orders among all the people a model has to deal with. They include parents,
managers, casting directors, agents, designers, and so on. The panel also 
recommended some form of licensing for models that would include certifica-
tion of good health in order to work.
In 2007, New York State authorized creation of The Child Performers
Advisory Board. The job of the board is to recommend
 Educational materials that raise awareness about eating disorders
among child actors and models and their families
 Guidelines for identifying child actors and models at risk for eating 
disorders
 Ways for at-risk child actors and models to be ensured access to 
treatment.
257
Chapter 17: Eating Disorders on the Stage, Screen, and Runway

Developments in the dance world haven’t been so official. Change is happen-
ing more at the level of individual schools, companies, and instructors. As
with models and actors, increased eating disorder awareness among all par-
ties is a priority. Experts encourage instructors to be cautious with negative
comments about body size and weight. Expert Linda Hamilton suggests that
schools and companies can take the following actions:
 Set minimum weights for performers.
 Require physician’s letters for dancers whose weight is in doubt.
 Refer dancers with eating disorders for treatment.
While it’s hard to detect any signs of regulation in the acting industry, one
company employing actors at least put a toe in the water. A major U.S. prod-
uct manufacturer decided to set a minimum BMI for models in its advertise-
ments. They also applied the minimum to any actors hired for company
advertisements. This isn’t a lot to report, but it’s a start.
Helping child performers
In Chapters 18, 21, and 22 you find lots of general information about how you
can help a child with an eating disorder. Here are a few things you may want
to keep in mind if you have a child dancer, model, or actor:
 Check the effect of your own aspirations for your child’s success: Are
you consciously or unconsciously messaging your child to get or stay
thin to succeed?
 Stay on top of the kinds of pressures about weight your child is being
exposed to from other sources: You may have to step in with trainers,
teachers, agents, and so on. Where you can’t have a direct influence (for
example, with casting directors), at least you can help your child put
weight judgments into perspective.
 Be realistic about your child’s natural body size and shape: Your child
simply may not have the body type required for the niche you and she
are dreaming of. If this is true, she needs you to be able to be realistic
and accepting about it if she’s going to become realistic and accepting
herself.

Eating Disorders in Children
In This Chapter
 Getting a general picture of childhood onset eating disorders
 Recognizing risk factors and symptoms of childhood onset anorexia
 Finding out about other childhood eating disorders
 Becoming aware of special treatment concerns
N
ormally, adolescence is when eating disordered behavior begins to sur-
face. Heartbreakingly, worries about fat and pressure to diet are show-
ing up at earlier and earlier ages. First-graders are unhappy with their bodies
and think they better do something about it. These ways of thinking and
behaving are known risk factors for the development of eating disorders.
Food and eating disturbances (which are not disorders) are pretty ordinary in
childhood. It’s not unusual for kids to be fussy about what they will and won’t
eat. Actual eating disorders in children are more unusual. There are few stud-
ies of these disorders in children, so nobody knows exactly how widespread
they are. But it’s important to be able to recognize the symptoms. Left
untreated, eating disorders can have big psychological and physical conse-
quences on a child’s overall development.
Children who get eating disorders are a lot like teens and adults who get
them — and also a lot different. Kids also have disordered ways of interacting
with food that aren’t about weight worries. Nonetheless, they can spell med-
ical and psychological trouble if allowed to go on too long. In this chapter I
alert parents and others what to look for in children and preteens that may
indicate a developing eating disorder. I also review special issues to keep in
mind when seeking treatment.

Becoming Informed about Childhood
Onset Eating Disorders
Kids have so many things they can do with food, besides just eat it and go
out to play. They can reject it, gag on it, choke on it, become terrified of it, eat
some things but not others, eat some things some days but not other days . . .
you name it. Frankly, most of this may be all in a day’s work if you’re the
parent of a school-age child. Cause for worry begins only when these behav-
iors gel into a fixed pattern and you can’t help your child find a way out. A
fixed pattern of disturbed eating that has no physical cause is a childhood
onset eating disorder.
Children get two kinds of eating disorders: the kind familiar to teens and adults,
and the kind that only kids get. Among the more familiar eating disorders,
children appear to get only anorexia. Bulimia and binge eating mostly wait for
adolescence. Among the kids-only disorders, the most common ones are food
avoidance emotional disorder (FAED) and selective eating.
Food avoidance emotional disorder
(FAED): When food is scary
Here are the major symptoms of food avoidance emotional disorder (FAED):
 Refusal to eat
 Weight loss or failure to gain weight
 Slowed growth
 Mood disturbance (depression or anxiety)
Unlike the kids with childhood onset anorexia I discuss in the section
“Recognizing the ‘Grown-Up’ Disorder of Anorexia in Kids,” kids with FAED
aren’t preoccupied with their body size, aren’t afraid of fat, and aren’t trying
to get thin. They are children who are so emotionally upset, they literally
can’t eat.
Many kids with FAED focus their distress on the food itself. They fear it can
choke or poison them or otherwise harm them. Experts say that often such a
kid has had some upsetting experience with food in the past, through illness
or accident, and is afraid it will happen again. Children with FAED usually
have fears and phobias about other things besides food. They handle these
other fears by avoiding, just like they do with food.
260
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Selective eating disorder (SED): 
When food has to be just right
Selective eating disorder (SED), often called picky or fussy eating, is known as
the childhood onset eating disorder that mostly drives parents crazy without
doing a lot of physical harm to the child. The child with SED
 Sticks rigidly to a narrow range of foods (for at least two years), usually
relying heavily on carbohydrates
 Refuses to try new foods
 Maintains normal weight and growth (even though you’re certain she
can’t, based on what she’s eating)
Often kids with SED gag when you offer an unwanted food. Most are respond-
ing to textures and tastes they can’t tolerate. They are not trying to lose
weight. Many become embarrassed by their limitations when they are old
enough to socialize. Just “growing out of” SED doesn’t seem to be a solution.
(For alternatives, see “Getting Treatment for Kids,” later in this chapter.) In
fact, a tiny minority of SED kids take their disorder into adulthood.
Less common childhood food disorders
The following disturbed childhood eating patterns, taken together, account
for the other 10 percent (or less) of the problems for which parents seek help:
 Food refusal: Unlike FAED, refusing to eat is a once-in-awhile thing,
maybe occurring only in certain situations or around certain people.
There may be mood problems behind the refusal to eat. Weight is not 
a preoccupation.
 Restrictive eating: These kids don’t have much of an appetite and just
aren’t very interested in eating. They aren’t worried about weight but
may have other emotional concerns.
 Functional dysphagia: This is a phobia — that is, a morbid fear — of
choking, vomiting, gagging, or being poisoned by swallowed food. Often
the child has had some experience that set off the fear or planted the
idea. It has nothing to do with trying to lose weight.
These disorders involve behaviors that are pretty common among preschool-
ers and don’t necessarily suggest emotional problems. They become cause
for concern when they continue into or start up in school-age years. If your
school-age child is showing these symptoms and not responding to your
efforts to help, don’t hesitate to get an expert evaluation.
261
Chapter 18: Eating Disorders in Children

Studies suggest anorexia accounts for more than 40 percent of childhood
onset eating disorders. FAED may account for 30 percent, and selective eating
another 20 percent.
Boys take a much bigger part in childhood eating disorders than older males
do in adult disorders. Studies show that a little more than a quarter of the
children with anorexia and most of the children with FAED are boys. In com-
parison, only 5 to 10 percent of adults with anorexia are men. (You can read
more about men and eating disorders in Chapter 15.)
Recognizing the “Grown Up” 
Disorder of Anorexia in Kids
As hard as it is to imagine school-age children becoming preoccupied with
weight or going on starvation diets to be thin, kids as young as 4 to 7 have
been reported to do so. Eating disorders in children can lead to long-term
consequences in their development. What puts a child at greater risk for
developing anorexia in the first place? What are the signs that your school-
age child may have already developed anorexia? Understanding the psychol-
ogy behind what can make a child susceptible to an eating disorder is helpful
in assessing your child. Parents can also consider risk factors as they review
the behavior of their child to help determine whether food-related issues are
merely fussiness or something more.
Physical impacts in children
If you combine numbers for the most common childhood eating disorders,
you find that refusal to eat is the main eating disorder symptom for kids.
Starving or being undernourished for a long time is dangerous for anyone. 
It presents particular problems for kids. These include
 Effects on heart and organs: Chronic undernourishment damages heart
and organ functions and interferes with the brain’s ability to think and
concentrate. (I discuss these effects of starvation in detail in Chapter 6.)
Effects on children may be more severe because they have less fat to
work with than teens or adults. Kids particularly seem to run a greater
risk for life-threatening damage to their hearts.
 Effects on growth: Just when the body needs plenty of nourishment to
fuel growth, food-refusal eating disorders are cutting off the source of
supply. Kids who don’t return to normal eating see their growth and
height stunted and puberty delayed. Fortunately, resumption of normal
eating overcomes these effects.
262
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Psychological overview
The usual age of onset for these disorders ranges from 7 to 13. (After this,
kids are grouped with adolescents.) It probably won’t surprise you to learn
that what’s on the minds of kids with these disorders is less complicated
than their teen counterparts. Teens are busy using their eating disorders to
work out issues of self-esteem, identity, coping with life, and making the tran-
sition out of childhood.
Kids who develop eating disorders are usually anxious or depressed and lack
any other language to express it. Many times they’re responding to families
who are in their own distress, or they’re mirroring other family members who
are upset and preoccupied with food and weight. Similar to teens and adults
with eating disorders, these kids are urgent about issues of control. Also like
teens and adults, they tend to be obsessive and to be perfectionists.
Reviewing the risk factors
From what’s known so far, the following factors appear to create the greatest
risk for developing childhood onset anorexia:
 Body dissatisfaction: Among the risk factors for anorexia, body dissatis-
faction is the one that most strongly predicts developing the disorder.
Once a preoccupation for grown-ups and teens, “feeling fat” has now
become a way for kids to dislike themselves, too. For example, statistics
show that one-third to one-half or more of primary and elementary school
girls and boys are unhappy with their bodies and think they need to lose
weight.
 Dieting: Like body dissatisfaction, dieting is showing up at younger and
younger ages. According to statistics, fully one-third of kids report diet-
ing by the time they’ve reached the fourth grade.
 Family conflict: Children who eventually develop anorexia are often
trying to cope with their distress in an environment of chronic parent 
or family conflict.
 Family over-involvement: Compliant children often don’t know how to
have a separate “me.” If a parent’s voice is very strong or the family
emphasizes togetherness at the expense of separateness, food and
weight may become a child’s last-ditch stand for control.
 Family weight talk: If you talk negatively about your own weight or your
child’s weight, the risk for an eating disorder in your child increases.
This is most likely if you’re the mom and your child is a girl.
263
Chapter 18: Eating Disorders in Children

 Triggering events: Kids are more likely than teens or adults to respond
to an upsetting life event by developing anorexia. Such events can include
loss of a family member or friend, parents’ separation or divorce, parent’s
job loss, medical illness in the family, a move, and so on.
 Anxiety: Anxiety is very common in kids with childhood onset anorexia.
The eating disorder can be an attempt to cope.
 Personality characteristics: Some studies suggest that overly compliant,
rigid, perfection-oriented kids are more vulnerable to developing child-
hood onset anorexia.
 Early feeding problems: Research shows that kids who have problems
with feeding in infancy or toddlerhood are more likely to develop
anorexia in later childhood.
Knowing what signs and 
symptoms to look for
The symptom profile of a child with anorexia is pretty much the same as the
symptom profile of a teen or adult with anorexia:
 Desire to lose weight, drive to be thin
 Phobic fear of fat
 Refusal to eat
 Weight loss
 Distorted view of body shape and size, seeing self or certain body parts
as larger than others do
 Obsessive thoughts about weight and calories
 Excessive activity to lose weight or offset calories consumed
There are also ways in which the symptoms of a child with anorexia look dif-
ferent from those of an older person:
 Loss of menstrual periods is not an issue: Studies of childhood eating
disorders cut off at the onset of puberty.
 Failure to gain weight: Though many kids with anorexia lose weight like
their older counterparts, not gaining in childhood is also a symptom.
Kids are supposed to keep getting bigger!
 Fluid refusal goes with food refusal: Refusing fluids puts a child at
increased risk for dehydration, which can lead to heart and organ mal-
function. (I discuss the effects of dehydration in detail in Chapter 6.)
264
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Parents and kids often have different views when it comes to identifying the
presence of eating disorder symptoms. One study found that parents were
better at noticing when their kids had body preoccupation and mood distur-
bances (like depression). However, kids reported feelings inside like fear of
fat that their parents had no idea of. The conclusion? To get the fullest picture,
including both parents’ and kids’ views is best.
Getting Treatment for Kids
When patients are very young, the emphasis in eating disorder treatment
shifts in a couple of ways. The urgency for an early diagnosis is even greater,
and the need for family therapy moves from optional or adjunct to mainline.
Here are the key points for you to keep in mind:
 Get your child evaluated without delay! Childhood onset eating disor-
ders can throw a child’s physical and psychological development off
track. The longer the child has the disorder, the more difficult catching
up becomes. Prognosis for recovery is best when you intervene early.
 Find an expert who knows kids and eating disorders. You may need to
override your pediatrician’s initial impressions and seek an eating disor-
der specialist to evaluate your child. Childhood onset eating disorders
are a relatively new focus and not yet on the radar screens of many oth-
erwise competent physicians. (You can use the “Resource Guide” in the
back of this book to start your search for an eating disorder expert.)
 Put together a treatment team that includes psychological and medical
experts. Childhood onset eating disorders have psychological origins
but medical consequences. Both need to be treated. If your child is
starving herself, treating the physical effects of starvation comes first
and may include hospitalization. (These treatment decisions are the
same as for teens and adults. I go over them in detail in Chapter 9.)
 Think of family therapy as a must-have. The younger the child, the
more important this is. Here are the main reasons:
• Your child is too young to be completely responsible for making
the changes necessary to get better. Young children can’t just
think their way out of psychological problems. They need their
families to help them make changes or for their families them-
selves to make changes for things to get better.
• You need support and guidance for helping your child change
disordered eating patterns. It can be a big relief to work with
someone who’s seen these problems many times before and can
offer you suggestions to help the situation improve.
265
Chapter 18: Eating Disorders in Children

• There may be things happening in your family that are upsetting
your child and fueling the eating problems. Kids who develop
eating disorders are often upset about family or marriage conflict
and have no other way to express it. Sometimes part of the “medi-
cine” for an eating disorder is finding ways to make things better in
the family.
• Your child may be responding to other family members who are
upset about their own weight and eating. Your child picks up
everything you say about weight, appearance, and eating. These
become the guidelines she applies to herself. Counseling for your-
self can be a big help if you’re having trouble with an over-focus on
weight and appearance.
• You may need to develop some new ways to relate to your child.
Childhood onset eating disorders often occur when parents are
having trouble letting go of the reins a little to give a child more
independence. An anxious kid can make this even harder. Having
the support of a family therapist can make those first steps less
hair-raising.
The input you get may be more in the form of parent counseling, or it
may include everyone in the family. Or some of both. You can expect
advice from a family therapist about what’s likely to work best in your
situation. She should also be able to advise you whether individual ther-
apy for your child is a good idea. (You can read more about family 
therapy in Chapter 11.)
266
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 
Troubles for tots; problems for preschoolers
Feeding and eating disorders of infancy and
early childhood is the official name for eating
disorders that show up in your child before age
6 and last for at least a month. These disorders
include
 Pica: Regularly eating nonfood substances
beyond an age when you’d expect it and
when it has nothing to do with cultural prac-
tices. (Pica came to everybody’s attention
when inner-city kids with the disorder were
eating lead-based paint chips and suffering
lead toxicity as a result.)
 Rumination disorder: This involves bringing
back up partly digested food, rechewing it
and reswallowing it, or spitting it out. It
occurs mainly in the first 3 to 12 months of
life, although people of all ages can have
rumination disorder.
 Feeding disorder of infancy or early child-
hood: Diagnosed when a child fails to eat
enough to grow or gain weight normally (or
even loses weight).
Parents need to understand that these disor-
ders aren’t phases (that is, your child isn’t likely
to just grow out of them), and their causes aren’t
anything physical. They may create increased
risk for eating disorders in childhood or adoles-
cence. Parental counseling and behavioral
treatment can be helpful.

Eating Disorders Later In Life
In This Chapter
 Getting a handle on the problem of eating disorders in later years
 Understanding eating disorder issues at midlife
 Recognizing anorexia and what causes it in the elderly
 Identifying special treatment concerns at midlife and for seniors
W
hile it’s generally true that the vast majority of people with eating dis-
orders are younger women, middle-aged women are showing up at
eating disorder programs in surprising numbers. 
Some of these women are experiencing a second round of eating problems,
having battled an eating disorder earlier in life. Others are experiencing their
first bout. Senior women and men (those 65 and over) also develop eating
disorders (mostly anorexia) more frequently than you or most of their profes-
sional caregivers may think. 
In our weight-obsessed culture, neither middle-aged nor senior women (nor
men) are exempt from pressures to be thin (or buff). In this chapter I go over
what makes these pressures unique in midlife and later years and how an
eating disorder often feels like a solution to coping with those pressures. I
discuss special treatment considerations for each group, including the need
to distinguish anorexia from more usual causes for loss of weight and
appetite in elderly people.
Getting Older and Trying to be Thinner
Our culture is not deeply interested in what older people are doing. Beautiful
young people wasting away or secretly bingeing and purging are more likely
to grab our attention. Not much research has been done into eating disorders
among those who are middle-aged and older, so nobody knows exactly how
widespread their eating disorder problems are. However, by looking carefully

at some “back door” sources of information connecting eating disorders with
those over 30 — such as studies showing high rates of risk factors, increasing
rates of requests for treatment, and death rates due to anorexia in the 
elderly — it becomes easier to see that you’re never too old to acquire an
eating disorder.
Seeking treatment later in life
If you go by the trends being seen in eating disorder treatment programs,
eating disorders among women in their 30s, 40s, and 50s are definitely on the
rise. Residential programs report that admissions of people in midlife have
doubled and even tripled in the last decade. Admissions for women over 30
account for as much as 25 percent of program populations.
A big question on everyone’s mind when it comes to people at midlife is
whether eating disorders are actually on the rise or whether these people are
just seeking treatment in greater numbers. The answer is probably some of
both. Baby boomers have come a long way toward taking the stigma out 
of seeking psychological help. This has gone hand in hand with increasing
public awareness about eating disorders. But this generation is also experi-
encing pressures for thinness in ways that grandma never thought of. Social
pressures to be thin are big risk factors for developing an eating disorder. 
(I discuss this in the next section, “Fighting the Loss of Youth and More.”)
In the International Journal of Eating Disorders (2006), researchers reported
on a sampling of senior women who weren’t seeking treatment. Just under 4
percent of these women had some kind of formal eating disorder. (Estimates
for the general population are in the neighborhood of 10 percent.) Another 
4 to 5 percent of these women had at least one eating disordered symptom.
Though disturbing, the numbers don’t spell a runaway epidemic. A California
State University study found that while elderly women are just as dissatisfied
with their bodies as middle-aged women, they are less driven as a group to
do something about it.
Dying a little later, but still too soon
Unfortunately, one thing that’s not hard to count is death certificates. When
researchers at the University of British Columbia did just that, they found
that while anorexia occurs most in younger people, it takes its biggest death
toll in older people. Almost 80 percent of anorexia-caused deaths occur in
people age 45 and older. Most think the higher death toll is because older
bodies are less able to withstand the physical assault of prolonged starvation.
Death rates due to anorexia continue to rise until sufferers are in their 80s.
268
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

Interestingly, more than 20 percent of these older people with anorexia are
men — twice the number among younger men. (You can read more about
men with eating disorders in Chapter 15.)
Fighting the Loss of Youth and More
Midlife is not necessarily a walk in the park for many folks, emotionally or
practically speaking. But it seems in this day and age we’ve found a way 
to notch up the stress for women. Many think a direct connection exists
between the added stresses of aging and an apparent upsurge in eating disor-
ders among middle-aged women. Unique pressures can push older people
into an eating disorder.
Experiencing midlife crisis is no joke
Undoubtedly, for many men and women, midlife can be a satisfying time filled
with long-worked-for accomplishments, retiring to enjoy well-developed inter-
ests, and embracing the simple joy of spending more time with loved ones.
But for far too many, midlife becomes a time mainly of being overwhelmed by
multiple competing demands, experiences of loss, and the sense of being less
and less worthwhile as judged by cultural standards.
Entering the “sandwich generation”
Those in midlife have been dubbed the “sandwich generation” because they
are often caught in the middle between caretaking responsibilities for depen-
dent children and newly dependent aging parents. Now, add to this being in
peak years for financial responsibilities: paying the mortgage, health premiums
for an entire family, saving for college, and so on. Maybe you’re just hitting
your stride in your career or trying to re-enter the job market after raising
kids. Perhaps you’re one of the growing number of women having their first
kids at 40, and you’re just entering those labor-intensive early years. The
point is that you’re unlikely to experience another time in your life when
you’re stretched in so many directions at once. And, of course, like pulling a
rabbit out of a hat, you’re expected to make it all work.
Finding that everything seems to be about loss
At the same time the demands are mounting, your supply of resources may
be dwindling. Midlife can be a time of major loss, sometimes many losses.
Coming to terms with them may place an extra strain on you and your sense
of yourself. Here are some typical losses people experience in midlife:
269
Chapter 19: Eating Disorders Later In Life

 Death: Usually you think of losing parents during midlife. But for many,
it’s also a time of first losing friends to death.
 Divorce: Whether you’re the one who wanted it or you got stuck with it,
divorce tears your life apart at the seams. It doesn’t mean you can’t
eventually land on your feet, but you’re in for a period of confusion 
and turmoil. If you wanted your marriage to continue, you have a lot 
to grieve. The loss can be quite practical as well: On average, women
drop to a lower standard of living following divorce.
 The “empty nest”: For some, seeing the last kid out the door is freeing;
for others, it’s devastating. Either way, it requires some major redefining
of who you are and what your role is in life.
 Youth, youthful dreams: One of the jolts of reality in midlife is that you
are not immortal after all and you don’t have endless time to do every-
thing you had in mind. Some of your goals and dreams aren’t going to
be, and you have to put them to rest.
 Physical strength: At midlife you may have to come to terms with physi-
cal limitations to what you can do. Realizing that you can’t exercise your
way into a body with the capacities of a 20-year-old is another jolt of
reality.
 Fertility: Even if you aren’t interested in having (more) babies, to many
women this is an important part of feeling womanly. It takes some time
and internal effort to invest those feelings elsewhere.
 Physical beauty — as defined by the culture: Some people may age
gracefully, but not all. Even if others view you as attractive as you 
age, you may not perceive yourself the same way, especially if you 
measure yourself against cultural standards of youthful beauty.
Getting wrinkles in a culture that has no place for them
No matter what you eat, how you exercise, or what kinds of lotions and potions
you apply, some physical changes are going to happen in midlife (and beyond)
that aren’t going to be what you signed up for.
In women, hormonal shifts related to menopause result in
 Easier weight gain; more difficult weight loss
 A shift of fat deposits to your belly (while managing to find plenty to
leave on your thighs!)
 Loss of skin elasticity (in other words, wrinkles)
When baby boomers face these normal changes of midlife, they do so in a
culture insisting as never before that giving in to them is failing. Fifty is the
new forty (or maybe even thirty — but no pressure!). Normally developing
270
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

wrinkles, accumulating fat, and weakening muscles are viewed as flaws and
reasons to see the plastic surgeon — as many times as it takes. Though men
are beginning to feel some of this heat, the culture has mainly focused its dis-
dain on the aging female body.
(Re)discovering the control cure
If you’re seeking eating disorder treatment at midlife, you may have already
overcome an eating disorder when you were younger. You may be experienc-
ing a relapse as your personal blend of vulnerabilities runs into all the things
that can make midlife women feel out of control. Or maybe you’ve lived with
your vulnerabilities all these years, but you’ve managed to escape an eating
disorder up until now. Midlife pressures may have become your tipping point.
Being overwhelmed by competing demands, enduring multiple losses, going
through normal physical changes and being judged less valuable because of
them — any of these experiences can leave a person feeling out of control. A
woman who’s achieved a certain amount of personal resilience doesn’t blame
herself, seeks support, knows certain things are temporary, grieves her losses,
and focuses on what she can control.
However, for a certain number of vulnerable women, feeling out of control 
in one or more areas of life can instead start an emotional domino effect.
Everything feels out of control. Life’s changes are terrifying and shaming.
They’re a clear sign of personal failure. These emotions can become 
overwhelming.
If you have this kind of shaky self-esteem, urgency for control, and difficulty
handling your feelings, you were a candidate for an eating disorder back in
your teens and you’re a candidate for one now in midlife. Food and body
weight always seem like something convenient to control — and everybody
applauds when you do. But pitfalls are unavoidable. (See Part I for a thorough
discussion.)
Eating Disordered Over 65
Although theoretically, seniors can develop any of the eating disorders, the
one they’re actually most likely to develop is anorexia. While unique triggers
can cause seniors to develop the disorder at this stage of life, other common
reasons for food refusal and weight loss in older people have to be ruled out
before anorexia can be considered as a diagnosis.
271
Chapter 19: Eating Disorders Later In Life

Triggering anorexia in seniors
Older people who develop anorexia often do so for the same reasons as
younger people: Life feels uncertain and out of control. Focusing on eating 
or not eating makes things seem simple and controllable again.
Actually, “seniors” span quite an age range. Eating disorders at the younger
end of the range, closer to age 65, are probably going to look different than
those found in people in their 80s or older. Younger seniors may still have
concerns pretty similar to people in midlife. Some may still be compulsively
exercising and using strange diets. For the older senior, it may all come down
to simple food refusal. She may not even be focused on weight loss anymore,
although she shows the classic denial that she’s losing weight or that it mat-
ters if she does. Seniors typically develop anorexia for the following reasons:
 Loss of a partner or other family or friends: Loss is one of the major
causes of feeling out of control in later years. 
 Loss of control over key aspects of life (for example, where you live):
This gets worse as a decline in health and mental capacities may make
you more and more dependent on others.
 Fear of aging: Uncertainty about what future losses, pain, or indignities
may be in store may make you feel very out of control.
 Social pressures to remain sexually attractive: Comparing yourself to
the prized people in the culture doesn’t stop automatically when you
start getting Medicare.
Seeing other reasons for diet problems
Seniors stop eating and lose weight for many reasons. You really need to be
certain to rule out everything else before deciding the reason is an eating dis-
order. Most of the other reasons can and should be treated in some way.
Here’s a roundup of the usual suspects:
 Depression: Although people with eating disorders are often depressed,
you can be depressed and not have an eating disorder. Depression is a
major cause for loss of appetite among older people.
 Social isolation: Being isolated can lead to depression. It can also make
eating and food preparation feel kind of empty and meaningless to some.
 Biological changes: Your body’s energy needs slow down as you age.
Appetite-stimulating hormones slow down with it. Your body doesn’t
fight so hard to hold onto its fat reserves anymore. By age 70, losing
some weight and having less of an appetite are normal.
272
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

 Medication effects: Medication side effects may include suppressing your
appetite or causing involuntary weight loss.
 Illness, pain: So-called wasting illnesses, such as cancer, cause weight
loss by definition. Nausea and pain caused by other illnesses knock the
stuffing out of appetite.
 Food phobias: An incident of choking or even a seemingly unrelated
experience can make a vulnerable person afraid to eat again.
Distinguishing involuntary reasons for weight loss, like those in the preced-
ing list, from anorexia may be difficult. When the cause of weight and appetite
loss is something other than anorexia, the following typically apply:
 The person doesn’t deny she is losing weight: If she acknowledges that
she’s losing weight, this means she recognizes there’s a problem. She’s
not in a state of denial or trying to cover up what’s happening to her
body. This is because the weight loss or food refusal isn’t serving a psy-
chological purpose such as trying to feel in control.
 The person doesn’t deny that there are problems associated with
weight loss: Acknowledging that weight loss can lead to other health
issues is not something a person with anorexia is likely to do. A person
with anorexia sees only positives from weight loss, even if the loss is
severe and life threatening.
Treating Eating Disorders in the 30+ Set
While the basics of eating disorder treatment remain the same regardless of
age, some special issues come up in relation to people who come for treat-
ment at midlife and as seniors.
Treatment issues at midlife
If you’re a middle-aged woman seeking eating disorder treatment, chances
are you’re bringing both some important liabilities and some important
assets to the process. Some practitioners emphasize the liabilities, others 
the assets. An ability to see both clearly is important. That way you feel
understood and you and your therapist can make the best plan for treatment.
For example, if you’ve struggled with an eating disorder for many years already,
your disorder is very ingrained by now. Eating disorders are easier to treat
when people haven’t had them for very long. The same can be said for the
personality characteristics that fuel them, like perfectionism, black-and-white
273
Chapter 19: Eating Disorders Later In Life

thinking, or the need to please others at your own expense. On the other
hand, you are now coming on your own, not because your parents, coach, or
school made you. You know that you need to get better. You have motivation
working for you in a way that many younger patients don’t.
A long-term battle with an eating disorder or underlying personality dynam-
ics may have left you a little battle-weary. Your mind, body, and spirit may all
feel a little worn out. On the other hand, entering treatment at midlife, you
bring some life resources to the table you didn’t have at 15 or 20. You have
life experience and — this is a big one — you have perspective. You know
more about how things work and what really matters. These are important
assets for your recovery.
Treatment issues for seniors
The evaluation stage is really crucial with older people for two reasons. The
first is to rule out the many other things that can cause seniors to stop eating
and lose weight. (See the previous section “Seeing other reasons for diet
problems.”) Medical causes need to be diagnosed and treated. Medications
should be evaluated and any relevant adjustments made. It’s especially
important to look for signs of depression. Depression can look like anorexia
and often goes untreated in elderly people.
The second reason a careful evaluation is crucial is that physicians and care-
givers don’t expect eating disorders in the elderly, so they aren’t on the look-
out for them. This is similar to the situation faced by men and kids. If you
think a senior you love may have anorexia, you may need to ask specifically
for her treatment team to consider it.
If a senior senior receives a diagnosis of anorexia, control issues are almost
certainly part of the picture. But they aren’t the same as for a younger person.
It’s one thing to feel your life is out of control. It’s quite another to hand over
the keys to the car, leave your home of 45 years for assisted living, and have
someone who could be your grandchild telling you when you’re going to go
to bed. Anorexia, under these conditions, is often a way of saying, Enough! I
still decide some things! A therapist and others who want to help need to take
the painful losses of control that go with this life stage into account.

Chapter 20
Eating Disorders and People 
Who Are Obese
In This Chapter
 Understanding the effect of the culture
 Getting the picture of eating disorders in people who are obese
 Recognizing special treatment issues
O
besity isn’t an eating disorder! And it doesn’t automatically signal other
emotional problems, for that matter. On the other hand, social miscon-
ceptions and prejudices can contribute to the development of eating disorders
in people who are obese.
In this chapter I go over these issues and take a look at the particular land-
scape of eating disorders among people who are obese. You find, for example,
that if a person who’s obese has an eating disorder, it’s most likely to be binge
eating disorder (BED) and that increasing obesity increases the likelihood of
developing BED. I also take up special treatment considerations for people
who are obese and have eating disorders. Quite a controversy is brewing
about what the proper treatment should be. I take you through both sides of
the issue and make some recommendations about other aspects of treatment.
Being Obese and Eating Disordered
If you’re obese and have an eating disorder, you most likely have BED. How
widespread is BED among people who are obese? Does it differ from BED in
people who are of average weight? Do people who are obese and have eating
disorders differ from obese people without eating disorders? I answer these
questions in this section, but first I define what obesity means.

Defining obesity
For research purposes, obesity has a specific definition. It’s defined by the
body mass index (BMI), a ratio that combines weight and height. Obesity is
officially defined as having a BMI of 30 or greater (several versions of the BMI
can be found online simply by searching on “BMI”). You should know that the
BMI chart, like the height-and-weight charts that came before it, did not come
down from Mount Sinai. Somebody made them up. They involve as much
social opinion as science. I leave it to you to decide for yourself whether this
chapter is relevant for you.
Seeing how BED differs in 
people who are obese
The biggest difference between BED sufferers who are obese and those who
aren’t is the role dieting plays in their lives. Nearly all people who aren’t
obese report the familiar yo-yo pattern (going on and off diets) that cycles
with their bingeing, with dieting playing an important role in how they started
bingeing in the first place. In clinical studies of those who are obese and have
BED, only half reported the same cycling pattern with dieting, while the other
half didn’t. The differentiating factor? Those who are obese with BED but
don’t yo-yo diet started bingeing before they ever started dieting. (You can
read more about the cycle of dieting and bingeing in Chapter 4.)
Emotional upset is likely to trigger overeating episodes in both obese and
nonobese people who binge. So-called disinhibiting triggers — things that
lead you to let down the controls — also result in bingeing. Alcohol is an
example of a disinhibiting trigger, as is being in the presence of lots of food 
or really great-looking food.
Being a person who’s obese with BED
If you’re a person who’s obese and you have BED, you’re likely to have more
psychological problems than people who are obese but don’t have BED. In
particular, you’re more likely to be depressed and have a history of depres-
sion and other mood problems, like anxiety.
An interesting study by researchers in Toulouse, France, compared overeat-
ing in women who were obese with and without BED. Both groups overate
when stressed or emotionally upset. But a lot more emotional overeating
went on in the BED group. The researchers found it was because of missing
skills: the ability to identify and express emotions. (When you’re missing
276
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

these skills, you have a condition called alexithymia.) The researchers rightly
concluded that developing missing emotion-related skills is crucial to eating
disorder recovery for these women.
About 2 to 5 percent of people who are obese in the United States are esti-
mated to have BED. These rates are similar to the overall population. Taken
from another angle, about 8 percent of the people who have BED are obese.
The more obese you are, the more likely you are to have BED.
Among people who seek treatment for obesity, binge eating is an extremely
common symptom. Up to one-third of treatment-seekers report some degree
of binge eating, although they don’t necessarily have full-blown BED.
Highlighting Special Issues for Treatment
If you’re a person who’s obese, much of your eating disorder treatment is the
same as for people of other sizes. However, in one way or another, your weight
is going to be part of the issue, even if you decide not to make it an issue. Most
likely, you need to address the effects of social stigma and work through deal-
ing with both weight and BED issues.
277
Chapter 20: Eating Disorders and People Who Are Obese
Night eating syndrome and nocturnal 
sleep-related eating disorder
Night eating syndrome is the name for a com-
bined eating and sleep disturbance found mostly
among obese people and its features include:
 Eating little during the day
 Eating most of your day’s calories in the
evening and/or at night, often after having
gone to sleep and then reawakening
 Being fully conscious while eating
 Being triggered by stress and depression
and getting better when these are alleviated
People who have been identified as having
night eating syndrome appear to have several
hormonal abnormalities which researchers
think may help explain their symptoms:
 Melatonin, a hormone involved in sleep, is
lower than average.
 Leptin, a hormone involved in appetite con-
trol and weight regulation, does not peak at
night as it should.
 Cortisol, a so-called stress hormone, is 
elevated.
Treatment for night eating syndrome is essen-
tially the same as treatment for any kind of 
emotional overeating — finding out how to cope
with stressful feelings in more productive ways.
This has to be a good thing! Zoloft, an SSRI (a
class of medication with antidepressant and
anti-anxiety effects), has been found helpful in
the treatment of night eating syndrome.

Treating the effects of social stigma first
Women generally feel pressured by a culture that worships thinness, but this
pressure can be a lifetime nightmare for women who are obese. Few obese
people of either sex reach adulthood without their unfair share of cruel or
discriminatory experiences. A steady diet of such experiences can take a toll.
It’s likely to affect self-image, mood and outlook, and a person’s sense of pos-
sibilities (or lack thereof) in life.
As with any stigmatized minority, a few hardy souls seem to have such nat-
ural or cultivated resilience that they manage to hold on to their good image
of themselves despite all the battering. Most people, however, can’t. If you’re
part of the majority who feel the painful effects of cultural battery, you need
to make sure that whoever you work with understands the issue of discrimi-
nation and can talk with you about it.
Talking about size discrimination early in treatment is usually a good idea.
First, if you don’t, it tends to be that famous rhinoceros on the table — the
big, obvious thing everybody’s ignoring. Second, for some people, just identi-
fying the cultural causes of their bad feelings about themselves can go far to
alleviate depression and lift self-esteem. Validating this part of your experi-
ence is an essential first stop — and worth trying before you work on your
feelings from other angles.
Treating obesity versus treating BED
The treatment world is divided with regard to how you should be treated if
you’re obese and have an eating disorder. One group says your obesity should
be treated first, and your eating disorder should come second. Another group
says your eating disorder should be treated first, and other decisions should
be made thereafter. I review the arguments of each so you can decide for
yourself.
Treating the obesity first
When experts talk about treating obesity first, they mean you should diet and
lose weight (or use as-yet-unproven weight loss medications or bariatric
surgery). This group believes that sound and solid weight loss programs,
overseen by professionals, don’t trigger your eating disorder symptoms — 
at least not like the bad and crazy diets you try on your own.
The biggest argument this group makes is that the health risks of obesity are
simply too great to safely postpone weight loss. Maybe your doctor and your
mom tell you the same thing. They point out statistics about the increased
risks for diabetes, high blood pressure, heart attack, and stroke among people
278
Part III: Eating Disorders in Special Populations 

who are obese. They remind you that your health improves with just a 10 per-
cent loss of body weight, and that you don’t have to overwhelm yourself with
impossible goals.
Treating the eating disorder first
Proponents of treating the eating disorder first point to the fact that eating
disorders always require treatment. Obesity doesn’t. The first thing that needs
to happen when you consult a professional is a conversation about whether you
even want treatment for obesity. I know; it’s probably what brought you into
treatment in the first place. But — just like being overweight — trying to lose
weight is full of physical and psychological pitfalls. At the very least, it should
be treated by you and your professional team as a choice and not a duty!
Your decision about treating your obesity may be influenced by some of the
following arguments, which present reasons for treating your BED first even 
if you decide to take on weight loss as a goal:
 Dieting doesn’t work: Never has there been an activity that’s failed so
frequently yet gotten so many second chances. Ninety-five percent of
people who lose weight through dieting regain it — often with a little
extra to boot. Yet people keep trying, if not this diet, then the next. And
professionals keep recommending them.
How do those state-of-the-art weight loss programs suggested by the “diet
first” group fare? People who participate lose an average of 10 to 15 per-
cent of body weight. But they regain an average of 75 to 80 percent of
their losses within 5 years of ending treatment. If you do the math, this
doesn’t put you in the health benefits range of a net 10 percent loss. And
it doesn’t put you much ahead of your own dieting devices (except I bet
the program is much healthier).
 Dieting triggers eating disorder symptoms: The argument that a sound,
sensible program doesn’t trigger eating disorder symptoms is based on
how well BED participants do during the dieting phase. Anyone with
BED can tell you that the dieting phase is when they’re likely to do well,
especially with structure, but there’s no telling how long that phase will
(or won’t) last for a particular person. You may last until the end of the
day, the end of the week, or the end of the diet. But at some point, being
on a diet is likely to trigger bingeing.
 The health risks of obesity are exaggerated: This may surprise you: It’s
already been established that your health risk is less if you are in the
preobese overweight range than if you’re underweight or average. An
increasing number of medical experts are questioning whether obesity is
actually the culprit when it comes to so-called obesity-related diseases.
First of all, it’s hard to separate the effects of obesity from the effects of
a no-exercise lifestyle. One way to tell them apart is to test obese people
who are also fit. When researchers do this, they find that the fit obese
people not only show reduced risk for diabetes and heart disease, they
have lower overall mortality rates than unfit slim people.
279
Chapter 20: Eating Disorders and People Who Are Obese

Second, if excess fat is a problem at all, it seems not to be overall body
fat that causes you trouble. Rather, it’s belly fat that appears to make all
the mischief with your blood sugar and arteries. You do have to exercise
to get rogue belly fat cells in line. But a good exercise program (like daily
walking) is usually enough and doesn’t make your eating disorder go
bonkers.
 It’s hard to lose weight and keep it off without treating the underlying
eating disorder: Even if you’re still holding onto a plan to take off weight,
tackling your binge eating disorder first is probably the best way to go.
Otherwise, relapse can undo a lot of hard work. Interestingly, studies
have shown that when binge eating disorder was treated successfully, 
a little bit of weight loss was a side effect for a quarter of their partici-
pants. The weight loss held up at the one-year mark.
Treating the whole person
If you focus only on weight loss or only on controlling bingeing, you miss the
most important point — you! Eating disorder recovery is always a time for
focusing on the whole person. But there are some particular things to keep 
in mind if you are obese and have BED:
 Depression: You and your therapist need to sort out where your depres-
sion comes from. If it’s mostly a response to living in a discriminatory
culture, your “medicine” may involve raising your consciousness about
it and participating in some antisize discrimination activity, if it feels
appropriate.
Many people of all sizes with BED suffer from depression. Often people
with BED eat to cope with their depression. Treating any depression
you’re experiencing is important to your recovery. You may find that
talking therapy and/or medication are helpful with the noncultural
sources of your depression.
 Alexithymia: Alexithymia refers to a condition in which you lack the skills
for identifying or communicating your emotions. This leaves you more
vulnerable to turning to food. Because you’re more likely to suffer from
alexithymia if you’re obese and have BED, your recovery requires a
healthy dose of emotion skills training. This is true for everyone with an
eating disorder, but you may need to start with the basics: How can you
know what you’re feeling? Can your feelings be put into words?
 Body acceptance: Body acceptance is an especially big hurdle when an
entire culture is telling you that your body is unacceptable and the only
solution is to change it. If you’re done trying to change your body, you
may need extra support for your decision. Make sure you know who you
can count on among family, friends, and co-workers. Tell them what kind
of support you need. People don’t always figure these things out on their
own. Besides, what you need may differ from one person to the next.

In this part . . .
I
address families and other people supporting someone
in recovery. I especially take into account parents who
are responsible for minor children with eating disorders.
(Where your situation requires a different approach — say
you’re dealing with an adult, you’re a spouse, a friend, or
an employer — I give separate advice and guidelines.)
I give special attention to situations in which you need to
confront the person with the eating disorder. I talk about
how to prepare yourself, including gathering information
and planning for pitfalls. I go over a list of do’s and don’ts
for the actual encounter and discuss how to handle anger
and denial. I then skip forward to managing day-to-day
living with that same person once she’s in recovery. It may
be no bed of roses, but there are ways you can all survive.
I review some approaches to nourish and others to avoid.
Finally, I discuss the wear-and-tear on you, the caregiver —
how to know when it’s getting to be too much and how to
find the kind of help you need to get you through.

Forming a Plan to Help the Person
with an Eating Disorder
In This Chapter
 Getting informed before you speak to someone about their eating disorder
 Understanding the value of having resources ready
 Zeroing in on the kind of support you need and how to get it
M
aybe you fantasize about having a really simple first conversation with
your child or another person you care about who has an eating disor-
der. In your fantasy, she approaches you, tells you she has a problem, and asks
you to help her get treatment. Then, together, you walk off arm in arm to the
therapist’s office.
This chapter assumes that your situation is more complicated and more real
than a fantasy scenario. Your child (or the person you’re concerned about)
isn’t bad; rather, she faces a lot of factors that make her want to deny having
an eating disorder or avoid talking about it.
In this chapter I focus on getting you ready for that first real conversation. (In
Chapter 22 I walk you through implementing your plan.) Think of yourself as
being in training. You want the scenario to go as well as possible. Complicated
matters tend to go better when you’re prepared. You also want to feel
grounded in your own knowledge and support if your child’s first reaction
isn’t so great. Preparation doesn’t make conflict easy. But at least it gives 
you a leg to stand on.
By reading this chapter, you actually end up with two legs to stand on: a prac-
tical one and an emotional one. I give you lots of information about how to
shore up each leg in “training.” I divide this practical and emotional advice
into three areas:
 Information
 Treatment resources
 Support

You want to prepare yourself by getting enough of each of them. This chapter
tells you what you need to know, why you need to know it, and how to go
about training for the best possible result.
Becoming Informed About 
Eating Disorders
Many good reasons exist to stop and get as much information as you can right
now. This is especially true if you’re going to be an ongoing part of the sup-
port system for the person with the eating disorder. The more you know, the
more helpful you can be.
Becoming informed can also help you with what you’re going through right
now. Your head may be swirling with images and myths that have little to do
with eating disorder reality. Getting the facts, ruling out the folklore, and seeing
what you need to do can be very calming.
In this section, I go over three basic questions about eating disorders you
want to answer before you start talking with the person you know who has 
an eating disorder:
 How do you recognize the signs that someone you care about has an
eating disorder?
 What’s an eating disorder about, and why do people have them?
 How do people with eating disorders get better?
Knowing the answers to these questions helps you keep in mind a bigger pic-
ture about the disorder and what the person you want to help needs. The
person with the eating disorder can’t be expected to comprehend this right
now, so you may temporarily have to think for both of you.
Recognizing visible signs 
of an eating disorder
In Chapters 2, 3, and 4, I describe the major eating disorders the way a person
may be experiencing them from the inside. In this chapter, I review the same
eating disorders from your perspective, that is, by looking at them from the
outside. From that outside perspective, eating disorders can be mighty con-
fusing! So many people put an exaggerated emphasis on weight and dieting
these days. What clues do you look for to tell you they’ve become more than
that for the person you’re worried about? The following sections flag the
main warning signs.
284
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

General warning signs of an eating disorder
Some warning signs are common among all the eating disorders. These univer-
sal caution flags include the following behaviors with regard to the person
who has an eating disorder:
 Preoccupation with weight and dieting
 Belief that she can only be worthwhile or okay if she’s thin
 Depressed mood when she’s not happy about her weight or how she’s
eating
 Severe self-criticism when she doesn’t get things right
Signs specific to anorexia
The following symptoms may be an indication of anorexia. (Note: The person
you suspect may have an eating disorder may show symptoms of both
anorexia and bulimia, because sometimes these disorders have symptoms 
in common.) Be on the lookout for the following:
 Losing a significant amount of weight not explained by illness
 Losing normal menstrual periods
 Believing that she is fat, regardless of her weight and regardless of what
you say
 Developing narrow, sometimes weird, food preferences
 Refusing to eat in front of others
 Cooking eagerly for others, but eating none of the food she prepares 
herself
 Wearing baggy clothes or layers of clothing to hide her size and shape
 Overdoing it with exercise (exercising too much, being upset if she has
to miss a workout)
 Feeling too cold, even in warm temperatures or when warmly dressed
 Feeling dizzy or faint
Signs specific to bulimia
The following symptoms are common among people who have bulimia. If you
suspect bulimia, be on the alert for these indicators:
 Binge eating (usually done in secret; your evidence may be missing food
or a bread-crumb trail)
 Finding excuses to leave the table after a meal
 Signs of vomiting in the bathroom
 Evidence of excess laxative or diuretic use
285
Chapter 21: Forming a Plan to Help the Person with an Eating Disorder

 Swollen glands, so-called chipmunk cheeks
 Excessive exercise
 A pattern of weight fluctuations, usually in a 10- to 20-pound range
 Withdrawal from social activities
Signs specific to binge eating disorder
Some symptoms of binge eating disorder are similar to those of bulimia, which
also involves bingeing behavior. You may notice the following:
 Binge eating (usually done in secret; your evidence may be missing food
or a bread-crumb trail)
 A succession of various dieting attempts
 A pattern of small or large weight fluctuations
 Refusal to participate in social activities when she thinks she’s too fat
Understanding what an eating disorder
means to the person who has it
When you observe the person you know with an eating disorder, you may see
someone who seems incredibly stubborn, out-of-control, sneaky, or dishon-
est. All these characteristics may actually be true on one level. But that’s all
the more reason for you to understand that life has come to feel completely
unmanageable to her in many ways. Strange as it may seem, she is trying des-
perately to cope. Her eating disorder is her chief coping strategy. (But she
doesn’t know that.)
The person with an eating disorder feels woefully inadequate, although you
may find this hard to believe. She may be a very high achiever, but inside she’s
always on the brink of failure in one way or another. She probably feels pres-
sured by each new stage in life, whether that’s adolescence, college, career,
marriage, or parenthood. Her eating disorder may have started in response to
the demands of one of these stages and worsened with each new one.
Dieting and weight loss are demands she understands. When the expecta-
tions of the outside world seem too big to handle, she can turn to a world
where she feels a sense of control. She can feel in charge, or imagine being in
charge, with the next diet. The same goes for pressures from the inside. The
person with an eating disorder doesn’t feel equipped to handle her emotions.
So she turns to food and dieting for soothing and control. Maintaining this
focus keeps her from feeling overwhelmed.
286
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

When you come in the name of health and healing, you recognize that the
eating disorder is actually doing damage, but the sufferer feels threatened.
What you offer are not strong motivators to her, because they appear to
remove the very tools she relies on for coping and psychological survival!
You need to stay strong and firm, especially in the early stages of recovery.
I discuss in detail how eating disorders serve as survival or coping strategies
in Chapters 2–5. You also find this point of view in my discussion of treatment
and recovery strategies, especially in Chapters 10 and 14.
Getting the basics of eating disorder 
treatment and recovery
Two factors are involved in the equation that comprises an eating disorder. In
order to get those factors to add up to a successful recovery, both must be
addressed. These two components are
 Reducing the eating disorder symptoms (dieting, weight loss, bingeing
and purging)
 Developing the internal strengths and coping skills that reduce the
chances of relapse.
If the eating disorder symptoms of the person you want to help are very
severe and her health is at risk, the two parts of recovery need to come in
this order: symptoms first, everything else second. Not only is survival at
stake, but anorexia, in particular, also physically affects the brain in such a
way that the sufferer’s thinking becomes distorted. She may not be capable
of addressing issues that require mental concentration until her symptoms
are brought under control. (I discuss this in greater detail in Chapter 7.)
When symptoms aren’t so high-risk, treatment doesn’t always proceed in such
an orderly fashion. The focus may be on recovery skills alongside symptom
reduction, for example, with each improving a little at a time. Or a lot of
recovery work may need to be done before you see a significant reduction in
symptoms.
A key factor to keep in mind is that treatment is not a speedy process. The
exception may be if you catch the eating disorder very early and the symp-
toms are very mild. Otherwise, be prepared to be patient. Even if symptom
reduction goes fairly quickly (quickly being something like six months), recov-
ery usually takes at least several years, and usually longer. What you get for
your trouble, however, is more than just an eating disorder-free person. You
witness the development of someone who’s more resilient and better pre-
pared to take on life’s challenges.
287
Chapter 21: Forming a Plan to Help the Person with an Eating Disorder

In Chapter 9 I go over the various treatment options you may need to think
about in the beginning. I explain how symptom severity guides choices about
the right kind of intervention for the person with an eating disorder and the
personnel you need to get the job underway.
Being Ready with Resources
You’re better prepared to tackle and survive the initial conversation with the
person with an eating disorder when you’ve already thought a few steps
beyond the conversation to what needs to happen next. Knowing how to get
started with a treatment process makes you more helpful to the person with
an eating disorder when you finally speak. In this section I go over how
resource preparation varies, depending on who you’re dealing with, and I
explain how to use this book to begin your search for treatment resources.
What’s the hurry?
Maybe you’re typically not a planner and you’re thinking, “Why can’t I talk to
the person first, see how that goes, and then start thinking about treatment?”
To answer the question, you may find it helpful to look to people with experi-
ence in helping families approach addicted members.
Is preparation the same for everyone?
Just what kind of resource preparation you need depends a lot on the age of
the person with the eating disorder and your relationship to her. Here are a
few guidelines:
 If this is your preadolescent child: Have a medical exam already sched-
uled or at least locate a doctor who can help you. Preselecting a family
therapist and talking with her ahead of time is also a good idea. (Look
ahead to the next section, “Gathering Support,” for ways to get the most
from this conversation.)
 If this is your adolescent child: Have some therapists’ names on hand
but also be prepared for some level of negotiation. (This, of course,
depends on the severity of your child’s symptoms. Your daughter’s
voting rights about treatment diminish if her situation is life-threatening!)
 If you’re dealing with an adult: Come with a few referrals (therapists or
treatment programs). Of course, the person with the eating disorder
may or may not accept them.

Where do I start looking?
Chapter 9 and the “Resource Guide” at the end of this book are two excellent
places to start looking! In Chapter 9 I review how to search for community
sources of treatment, such as clinics and hospital- or university-based pro-
grams, professional networks, or word-of-mouth resources.
In the “Resource Guide” you find names of a number of organizations that
maintain lists of eating disorder specialists and treatment facilities on the
Internet. The Internet has become the information resource for so many
people these days that most programs and facilities have a page for you to
investigate. This is less true for individual practitioners like doctors and 
therapists.
Gathering Support
Just what you need in the way of support depends a lot on your relationship
with the person who has the eating disorder. If you’re a parent or other family
member who will be deeply involved in the treatment process over a long
period, your needs are different from those of the concerned co-worker who
may or may not have an ongoing relationship with the person who has the
eating disorder. To reach your goal, you may need three kinds of support
right now:
 Help in getting the job done: Other people may have as big a stake in
the conversation you’re facing as you do. Maybe these people can also
be present. Or maybe they can help you think through how you want to
handle the situation and supply moral support.
289
Chapter 21: Forming a Plan to Help the Person with an Eating Disorder
Interventions
Interviews called interventions are a well-known
motivational tool. Interventions bring together
everyone significant in the addicted person’s life
to express their support and concern or fear. In
the best-case scenario, an intervention ends by
whisking the now-motivated addicted person
into treatment. Space in a rehab program is
ready and waiting, prepared ahead of time for
this moment of increased motivation.
Even if your conversation isn’t as dramatic as an
intervention, the idea to hold on to is that when
the person with an eating disorder expresses
some willingness to seek treatment, you want to
be prepared to act. Readiness can come and go
when something feels this scary. Expect it to feel
scary.

 Advice about what to do: Handling a situation like this may be above
your pay grade. Sometimes talking to people who have more experience
than you do is crucial — or at least helpful.
 Emotional support: Chances are you’ve already been through a lot of
upset about this situation. You’re worried about the eating disorder suf-
ferer. You don’t know exactly what you’re supposed to do. You don’t
know how your intervention is going to turn out. This is a recipe for
stress. (I devote Chapter 24 to the support you may need throughout 
the recovery process.)
In this section I focus first on families and the value of planning together how
to talk to the person with the eating disorder. I then discuss the kinds of sup-
port you may need from outside the family. Last, I discuss the situations of
people who are getting ready to bring up an eating disorder with a non-family
member.
Making a plan with other family members
If the person with an eating disorder is a family member, there’s no time like
the present to rally the troops! An eating disorder affects everyone in the
family, and everyone can contribute to making the situation better.
You may decide that a two-parent talk with your child is the best way to go.
(Make that one-parent if you’re raising your kids on your own.) This makes
particular sense if your other children are quite small. Or maybe you’re con-
vinced the child with the eating disorder will feel ganged-up on rather than
supported if everyone’s along for the ride at this stage. On the other hand,
you may decide your child with the eating disorder is most likely to respond
to an appeal from everyone. (I go over specific strategies for this conversa-
tion in Chapter 22.)
My main point right now is less about who you finally include when you speak
to your child with the eating disorder and more about beginning the process of
bringing the family together for support and problem-solving. Your child with
an eating disorder will need lots of help in the days to come. But so will you.
Finding support for yourself
A lot of potential exists for feeling alone and overwhelmed when you first take
on a strange and upsetting disorder, especially when that disorder is afflicting
your child! Make sure you don’t become isolated as you work on becoming
informed and finding resources for her. Be certain that the people you trust
and rely on — family, friends, co-workers — know what you’re going through,
what steps you’re taking, and how it’s going. Let them care about you!
290
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

Sometimes the best support in the world from family and friends still doesn’t
meet all your needs. Two good reasons for seeking professional help now,
before you’ve even spoken to your child are
1. You’re so upset that your own emotions, such as anxiety or depression,
are taking center stage.
You’re entitled to be upset. A child with an eating disorder is upsetting!
But you probably want to be as calm and centered as possible when you
speak to your child. If speaking to family and friends doesn’t help you
enough with your feelings, you have a perfectly legitimate reason to use
professional services.
2. You’re confused about the best way to proceed.
You aren’t expected to know how to handle an eating disorder. Some
kids present bigger challenges than others. Maybe you already have
hints that your daughter denies anything is wrong. Maybe she’s angry
and seems impossible to talk to, even about noncontroversial topics.
You can go in armed with a few ideas from someone who’s already 
been there.
Two experts you can call on now may be in your future anyway. The first is a
family therapist. Family therapy is a very good idea for your daughter’s treat-
ment. You don’t have to wait! A family therapist can give you guidance about
your child at this planning stage as well as during treatment.
The second possibility is an individual counselor or therapist for yourself. I
discuss this possibility in more detail in Chapter 24. The point is, you don’t
have to take care of everything for your child first. Making sure you’re alright
as this process begins is not only okay — it’s a superior idea!
Seeking support in nonfamily situations
The person you’re seeking help for may not be your child, but that doesn’t
mean you don’t feel the need for support. The less out-and-out responsibility
you have for the person with the eating disorder, the less solid ground you
may feel you have to stand on to speak up. If the person you want to help is
 Your friend: Are you underage? You may want to get your parents’ sup-
port. Not so comfortable with that? How about a school guidance coun-
selor? Avoid speaking with the person’s other friends. She may feel
betrayed when she finds out. If you’re an adult, you probably have
friends who don’t know the person. Speaking with them is okay.
 Your roommate: If you’re in a college dorm situation, by all means,
speak to the dorm’s resident head. You don’t have to be in this alone.
You can also get advice and support from your college’s student coun-
seling services.
291
Chapter 21: Forming a Plan to Help the Person with an Eating Disorder

If this is a roommate in the adult world, enlisting the support of friends
and family is a good place to start. How much more support you need
depends on how dire your roommate’s situation is and/or how much her
behavior (such as stealing food) intrudes on you. You may appreciate
some temporary professional counseling about high-risk situations. For
instance, when is it okay to call in her family? How about emergency
medical workers? When do you call it a day with the roommate arrange-
ment, no matter how convenient it is or how fond you are of the person?
 Your employee or co-worker: Put this book down (just for the moment)
and go speak to someone in your human resources department! You need
to know company policy and procedure. You need a chance to vet your
mission. Are you implementing policy? Are you there purely as an expres-
sion of personal concern? How does your professional relationship with
the person with the eating disorder influence the answer to these ques-
tions? You need backup — perhaps legal, probably emotional — if you’re
going to be the point person for this conversation.

Chapter 22
Implementing Your Plan to Help
In This Chapter
 Understanding what you’re trying to accomplish
 Recognizing some useful do’s and don’ts
 Knowing how to deal with anger and denial
You’re about to change things in your house. You’re convinced of your
child’s eating disorder. You’ve been gathering your courage and prepar-
ing your plan (see Chapter 21). Now you’re ready to break the silence. Maybe
you’ll end up feeling like you’ve temporarily turned your household upside
down. Or, instead, you may feel like you’ve broken a spell hanging over it. But
one thing is certain. You will have started the clock ticking toward your child’s
recovery.
In this chapter I outline what you can expect to accomplish, some guidelines
on how to approach the person with the eating disorder, and some ideas on
handling the very common responses of anger and denial. I write this chapter
specifically for parents, but include a section at the end for other relation-
ships, such as spouses and roommates.
Knowing What You’re Out To Accomplish
You know those times when you’ve stored up what you wanted to say for so
long that when you finally speak, every thought you ever had on the subject
comes spilling out? That’s not what you want to do when you have the first
conversation with your eating disordered child.
A better approach is to focus on a few realistic goals for your conversation
(see Chapter 21). You may find it reassuring to know that you don’t have to
get to the bottom of what may be causing your child’s eating disorder today.
Or figure out how to solve it today. Or even get a firm commitment to treat-
ment today. Today, or whenever you plan to do it, you just need to have the
conversation, for better or for worse.

Actually, for this conversation, small is big. I know that may sound weird, but
I want you to really embrace this little truth. “Small is big” means that seem-
ingly small steps can have big effects. What may not appear to be a very big
outcome to shoot for can turn out to have significant results down the rocky
road of recovery. Look at it this way: One teensy tiny positive thing (like
having the first conversation) could be just the nudge that starts your child
on the right trajectory toward recovery. And you will have started the
process instead of feeling stuck where you are.
In this section I go over some reasonable outcomes to look for in a first con-
versation with your child about her eating disorder and the bigger effects
they can have in the future.
Keeping your eyes on the small, reasonable goals can serve as your internal
navigating system. When you’re tempted to veer off course or the conversa-
tion actually does go off the road (it will!), you’ll have a reliable guidance
system to nudge you back on track.
Getting the problem out in the open
If everyone’s been tiptoeing around the eating disorder, that famous rhinoc-
eros on the table that no one speaks about, finally getting it out in the open
can be a big relief. This is true even if the conversation doesn’t go so well,
merely because you’ve at least acknowledged that the rhino is there.
After you name the problem — anorexia, bulimia or binge eating disorder —
you enter a new chapter. You may fight about it, cry about it, misunderstand
each other about it, or problem-solve about it. But you won’t be pretending
about it anymore. Your child will ultimately respect you for having the courage
to reach out, and she’ll appreciate it one day. Because she isn’t able to tell you
this now, I am.
Starting the process of talking
By having this conversation with your child, you are setting an example. This
small-but-big goal is especially meaningful if your family doesn’t have a tradi-
tion of being out in the open about unpleasant things. Kids observe these pat-
terns and take them as their parents’ expectations. Your child may have even
assumed you needed (or wanted) protection from a conversation like this.
You may not get very far today. But you’ve established that the eating disor-
der is something you’re prepared to talk about. This is HUGE. There may be
other obstacles to talking in the future, but your child now sees that you
aren’t reluctant to talk about them and tackle them.
294
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

Making your concern clear
Later in this chapter I offer some guidelines for the tone to set when you talk
with your child about her eating disorder. You’ll follow them imperfectly and
say things you’ll later wish you hadn’t. But what your child will get, for all the
fumbling, is that it matters to you that she’s in trouble.
If you can keep just one guideline in your mind when you go to speak to her,
remember that your caring and concern are what matter most to her. Set
your internal navigator on this goal and you’ll find a way to say what you
need to that carries the message of your concern. And no matter what she
says, she really does hear you.
For example, Carolyn and Pete Jones were sure they’d done everything wrong
when they spoke to their 14-year-old, Samantha, to tell her they suspected
she had anorexia. The conversation ended with Samantha screaming: “You
just want to control me and ruin my life!” One night, six weeks later, the couple
turned in to bed, worried sick like every other night. On one of their pillows
they found an essay Samantha had written for her high school English class.
The topic was “Modern Day Knights.” Carolyn and Pete laughed and cried as
they read about themselves as knights who’d ridden into the dragon’s lair,
knowing the dragon was Samantha’s anorexia and not Samantha. Scribbled
by hand on the back was the note: “Can we talk? No fire-breathing, I promise!”
Suggesting treatment
Most of the time, it’s appropriate to at least put the suggestion for treatment
on the table in your first conversation with your child. How this part of the
conversation goes depends on
 Your child’s age:
• Preadolescent children: This is usually a matter of explaining to
your child the treatment that you’ve already arranged.
• Adolescents: You always want to look for some degree of choice
you can offer. Whether getting treatment at all is a choice depends
on how serious your child’s symptoms are.
• Adult children: As with any other adult, you express your concern,
and ask if your suggestions would be appreciated. (See the section
“Dealing with Anger and Denial” for how to handle life-threatening
situations where you have neither control nor your adult child’s
cooperation.)
295
Chapter 22: Implementing Your Plan to Help

 The severity of your child’s symptoms: If the situation doesn’t seem
severe and your child accepts the conversation and suggests a reason-
able plan of action that doesn’t involve therapy, you may consider it. But
don’t leave it open-ended. Put your child’s plan within a time frame that
includes measureable milestones with positive results. If she misses
deadlines or results are poor, then put your plan in place.
If you need to insist on treatment, look for other options you can offer.
This week or next? Does she want to meet with the family therapist
alone first? Any guidelines for picking her own therapist? However, the
options should not be endless and must result in action.
 How the rest of the conversation has gone: If treatment is necessary
but the conversation has really gone south (she’s angry, overwhelmed,
or in denial), table the treatment discussion for the time being. But make
clear why you’re postponing it and that you’ll get back to it eventually. In
fact, you may want to set a date to talk again.
Laying the groundwork for 
future conversations
Getting the eating disorder out in the open and establishing that it’s something
you’re ready, willing, and able to discuss is, in itself, a huge accomplishment.
Whatever progress you’re able to make in the first conversation is good
enough for that conversation. Sometimes it’s useful to stop and let things 
percolate, let everyone calm and cool down if the talk becomes heated, and
let everybody regroup if you reach an impasse.
Stepping back and letting what has been said sink in is a positive step. We all
need time to consider new ideas. Initial resistance to even the tamest of new
ideas is not unusual, and what you are suggesting is a big, life-changing deal
to your daughter. But, most of us, given time, come around to new ideas once
our emotions have settled and reason takes over. In fact, stepping back and
letting your daughter take time to think about what you’ve said, even if she
has yelled and screamed and nothing has been resolved, may help her be
more receptive later on.
Once the conversation has started, you won’t be starting from scratch the
next time around. You’ll be picking up conversational threads from your first
discussion. If things didn’t go so well the first time, picking a thread can actu-
ally be quite helpful. Starting with one of your child’s threads the second time
around can be a great way to show you were listening and to set in motion a
possible repair process. For example, you can say something like the following:
 “You know, I’ve been thinking about what you said about some of our
family’s eating patterns and I think you make a good point.”
296
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 “I don’t think I actually got what you were trying to say about feeling
criticized. Could you try me again?”
 “If we did things the way you suggest, how do you think that would work
out? What’s your worst worry about doing it the way we suggest?”
By inviting her to continue the conversation in a nonthreatening way, you
express your respect and genuine concern. Be sure to listen carefully and 
to seriously consider what she says.
Knowing Some Important Do’s
It’s always useful to have some positive behaviors to point yourself toward. In
this section I review some “do’s” to help you navigate that opening talk about
your child’s eating disorder. In fact, these are pretty much all-purpose “do’s”
that can take you through any follow-up conversations as well.
Do be calm and centered
Although you can’t really instruct yourself to be calm and centered, you can
aim to be. (By centered I mean having a certain confidence in what you’re
saying and doing, trusting where you’re coming from.) What can you do to
help yourself be more calm and centered? Here are a few things that have
helped others:
 Plan ahead what you want to say: You probably won’t be able to think
of all your best points and how you want to say them in the heat of the
moment.
 Go over your plan with someone you trust: You don’t have to think of
everything or anticipate every response on your own.
 Write things down: Some people organize their thoughts best on paper.
 Alert your support system: Make sure the important people in your sup-
port system know what you’re doing and when you’re doing it as far as
this talk goes. You don’t have to feel alone.
 Reassure yourself: Think of the parts of the conversation that worry
you most. When have you successfully handled something similar?
 Picture a successful outcome: Even if what you picture is pie-in-the-sky,
it allows you to feel calmer. (Try it out right now and see what happens.)
Here’s the bonus: The calm feelings will positively affect the way you
speak to your child. Who’s to say you won’t get the outcome you want?
297
Chapter 22: Implementing Your Plan to Help

Do say clearly what you mean
“Say what you mean and mean what you say,” is an old adage that works here.
It may cause a lot more squirming now, but your child is going to trust you
more if you put your cards right out on the table. You can say something like
 “We’re more and more worried about your dieting. We don’t think it’s
healthy. I’d like us to talk about it.”
 “I’ve been finding empty laxative packages in the garbage. I read about
purging. Is that what you’re doing?”
 “When kids quit seeing their friends, it usually means something is
wrong. You haven’t been spending much time with us either. I think we
need to discuss it. I want to help.”
You’re constantly setting an example of what’s okay to say. Your child also
takes what you say as a gauge for what you’re able to tolerate hearing her
say. If your child wants to avoid any confrontation with her eating disorder,
your vagueness just helps her do so. She needs the example of your bravery
to eventually find her own.
Do report your own reactions and concerns
The point of sharing your feelings, besides getting your concern across, is to
give your child some feedback on how her eating disorder behavior is affect-
ing you and other people in the family. For example:
 It frightens you that she’s so thin and seems so unaware of it.
 It upsets you on her behalf to see her pull away from her friends and
spend more and more time alone. She doesn’t look so happy.
 It makes you angry to grocery shop one day, only to find the shelf half
empty the next.
 Her brother and sister are complaining about the way they find the bath-
room after she’s been in there purging.
All these reactions and any more like them are important for her to hear. She’s
seeing through a much distorted lens right now. You’re providing her with
some reality. This includes the reality of what her family members can and
can’t tolerate in her behavior. It also includes the normal reactions of loved
ones watching a family member being reckless with herself, possibly with her
life.
Do make it clear that you don’t expect your child to do anything about your feel-
ings. You can take care of those yourself. You’re providing information about
how you see her eating disorder affecting her and what it’s like to live with it.
298
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

Please notice that blame and accusation statements usually start with “you,”
as in, “You’re a sneak and a liar.” On the other hand, statements about your
own reactions and feelings start with “I,” like “I get angry when I think you
clean out the cupboards after I shop and you don’t tell me.” Couples in treat-
ment are frequently encouraged to use these so-called “I” statements to help
manage conflict. “I” statements allow you to make your point without assassi-
nating the other person’s character. (Note: Saying “I’m angry that you’re a
sneak and a liar” is cheating!) Telling your daughter you feel terrified and
powerless when she doesn’t eat has the effect of reducing blame and putting
the two of you on the same team to fight her eating disorder.
Do be prepared to listen
You may either have so much to say in this conversation or be so nervous
about it or so fed up that it’s hard to be open to your child’s side of things.
Slow down. Breathe. Write the following instructions on your wrist, if you
need to: Stop and listen.
Listening is a profound sign of respect. Your child instinctively feels that
respect. It goes far toward keeping her engaged in this difficult conversation.
But — this is an important thing for you to know — the respect you’re show-
ing is for your child, not necessarily for what she is saying. Listening isn’t an
endorsement of what you hear. It’s just listening.
What else do you get for your trouble when you take the time to listen to your
child?
 You model a good skill for difficult conversations: You show your child
that she can rely on you.
 You may find out something: Maybe you didn’t know how badly she got
teased last year for extra weight. All the dieting started because she
vowed not to get the same treatment in high school.
 You may understand your child better: You may not have known that
your straight-A child always feels like a failure and a fake about to be
found out.
 You may hear something important to take into consideration moving
forward: You had no idea she’s depressed so much of the time. At mini-
mum, her depression needs to be evaluated. It may be part of what needs
to be treated along with her eating disorder.
Of course, hearing many of these things can break your heart. All the more
reason to make sure your own support system is in place. (For more details,
see Chapter 24.) A reminder: Your child can’t be part of your support system!
299
Chapter 22: Implementing Your Plan to Help

Do be supportive
You want to be sure the things you say convey your support for your child.
This may be easier if you remember that you’re supporting your child, not
her eating disorder. And you’re certainly not supporting rude or disrespectful
behavior. Support is not a message that anything goes. It’s a message that you
love your child and that you’ll do everything you can to see her reach her
highest star in life, whatever that is for her.
More specific to the eating disorder, your child needs to know you’re in it with
her to find solutions. And even if she can’t see her way out right now, let her
know that you have faith in her strengths. Remind her that she’s done other
hard things. She can do this. And she has you behind her.
Do encourage your child to take 
responsibility for her eating disorder
You may feel sorry for your child. You may be furious with her. You may see
her as a helpless victim of something bigger than her. Nevertheless, you must
start conveying your expectations that she be responsible for as much of her
eating disorder as she can. She can’t fix the fact of having an eating disorder.
But right now she can
 Acknowledge having the disorder and the extent of it.
 Agree to necessary treatment.
 Be responsible for her eating disordered behaviors and how they affect
others in the family. (For example: cleaning up after herself, replacing
filched food, helping pay for binges, and so forth. I discuss this in more
detail in Chapter 23.)
As you can see, some of these items can’t be achieved in one sitting. For
example, denial is part of having anorexia. And hiding symptoms in shame 
is part of bulimia and binge eating disorder. Expecting your child to become
responsible is a stance. You and your child will work toward her meeting the
expectation. Even if it takes a while, you’re sending an important message of
your faith that she can do the right thing.
All of these guidelines can seem pretty daunting, like a recipe for sainthood
rather than a conversation with your kid. Remember, you won’t get it all right
and you don’t have to. There will be other conversations on other days. And
each will offer a chance for do-over and repair. Not a bad lesson for a child
who thinks things have to be perfect, right?

Avoiding Some Important Don’ts
You know that old expression: “It isn’t what you say; it’s how you say it”? In
this section I focus on some typical pitfalls that can easily derail your conver-
sation right at the start. They relate to when not to speak, how not to speak,
and what not to speak.
Don’t choose a time when one 
of you is already upset
Don’t sit down for that eating disorder talk when you or your child is already
really upset about something else. Okay, this one is relative. You’re probably
kind of upset just because you’re planning this conversation. But you can
avoid times when some other argument or crisis is center stage. For example,
maybe you and your child just fought about her grades, you just learned your
mother has to be hospitalized, or you and your partner just had a major melt-
down about the electric bill. These are not the best times to have your first
eating disorder discussion.
If your family is like most, you could wait forever for a moment of perfect peace
and calm. But on the other hand, it’s okay to wait until the floodwaters from
one storm have receded before you blow into town with another. Especially
one that’s bound to challenge the levees like your child’s eating disorder.
Don’t accuse or blame
Think of a time when someone — employer, family, friend — wanted you to
change something and the conversation went well. Now think of a time when
somebody wanted a change and the conversation didn’t go so well. What was
the difference? It probably had something to do with the way each person
made you feel about yourself.
When you include blame or accusations in your conversation, your child starts
out a leg down. She has to defend herself. Here are some examples of remarks
that can easily slip into the conversation when you’re under distress but are
guaranteed to put your child on the defensive:
 “Don’t you know how you’re upsetting your mother?”
 “We can’t enjoy ourselves anymore because of you.”
 “You’re all skin and bones!”
 “You’re a sneak and a liar.”
 “We didn’t raise you to behave like this.”
301
Chapter 22: Implementing Your Plan to Help

Here are the biggest problems with putting your child on the defensive:
 You unintentionally place yourself on the team opposing your child,
when what you want is to start building teamwork between you. You
want it to be you and her against the eating disorder.
 When your child is busy defending herself from accusations, she isn’t
hearing the more important parts of your message.
 If your child has an eating disorder, she already feels worthless. She’ll
just use remarks from you that sound blameful as more fodder for her
own self-blame mill. (Even if she defends herself to you!)
Don’t plead
Children with eating disorders already have very distorted views about their
control in life. If your child has anorexia, she imagines she has ultimate con-
trol. If she has bulimia or binge eating disorder she feels completely out of
control. Either way, she needs her parents to have better ideas than she does
about how to be in control of the situation.
What does this have to do with pleading? When you plead with your child to
cooperate or “stop having” her symptoms, you suggest that you have little 
to offer to help her. The responsibility for finding a way out is all on her. She’s
already demonstrated she doesn’t know how to get out of this jam on her
own. She needs to know you have more confidence and direction than she
does (which is not the same as having all the answers!).
Don’t threaten
Surprisingly, when you threaten your child, you sound just as out of control
as when you plead. Threatening is the kind of thing you do when you feel
helpless and don’t have any other ideas. Whether your child can put it in
those words or not, that’s how your threatening comes across to her, too.
And that makes her feel angry and frightened. No matter how she fights you,
she needs to feel you’re equipped to help her find a way out of her eating dis-
order predicament.
Don’t ask whether it’s your fault
The moment you ask your child if she blames you for her eating disorder, two
things happen, and you don’t want either of them.
302
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 First, the conversation becomes about you. There’s a place for your feel-
ings. (See the earlier section, “Do report your own reactions and con-
cerns.”) But asking your child to manage your guilt feelings isn’t part of
that picture. It isn’t her job, and she can’t really do it for you anyway.
Goodness knows, your feelings of guilt are a big part of this story. And
you should take them seriously. But you want to look for adult support.
(Chapter 24 focuses on how you can get the support you need.)
 Second, she reads it as you needing protection. That makes her less
likely to share difficult feelings. And, just like with the pleading, she
doesn’t know whether she can lean on you. This doesn’t mean you’re
not allowed to show you’re upset. That would feel phony. It means you
can’t ask your child to fix your feelings. You need to let her know 
you’ve got that base covered. She can focus on getting better herself.
Dealing with Anger and Denial 
You could avoid every “don’t” and do every “do” and still meet with a tantrum
or even, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Back to the drawing board
and square one? Not at all. Actually, your plan needs to include expectations
of these angry or denying reactions. They’re pretty common when you con-
front people with eating disorders. In this section I focus on your responses
to them. First, I give you a little food for thought that may help you digest
them better. Second, I offer some ideas for responding to your angry or deny-
ing child.
People don’t easily give up 
their survival strategies
If you are shocked and furious at your child’s denial or lack of cooperation, I
don’t have any magic that can make you feel okay. But I invite you to do the
following tiny exercise:
 Think of the moment in that first encounter, or any other, that she most
drove you up the wall. . . Picture her really vividly. . . Got it?
 Now imagine that you are witnessing someone who is fighting for her
life. . . What effect does that have on what you see?
How do people behave when they are fighting for their lives? One thing I
know for sure is that they don’t easily surrender their survival strategies.
I advise you to do two things at times like these:
303
Chapter 22: Implementing Your Plan to Help

1. Spend some quality time with anyone and anything that reminds you
you’re a good person and a good parent. Your eating disordered child
can’t do that for you right now.
2. Go back to basics about eating disorders. Your child believes she’ll be
worthless if she can’t control her weight with her eating disorder. You
become the force of darkness if you threaten to take it away. 
Keep the faith. Everyone is basically programmed for health and life, includ-
ing your child. Kids haven’t lived long enough to see the big picture, one that
holds more options than an eating disorder as a way to feel worthwhile. You
have to be the one who knows about that bigger picture until your child can
see it too.
She hears you, no matter how she responds
The eating disorder is the face your child is showing to the world right now. It
isn’t all there is to her (thank goodness!) She’s still capable of hearing the
healthy and caring things you say. Your child is stashing your messages away,
even while she rejects them to your face, like a squirrel stashing nuts for the
winter. (If your child is an adolescent, try substituting “angry teen” for “eating
disorder” in this paragraph. You’ve got both of them!)
The main thing to remember is that your child hears what you say, no matter
how she responds. This isn’t a recommendation that you simply keep talking
at her while she continues with her eating disorder. You may have to take
other steps, as I discuss later in the section “Deciding when you need to 
take action.” But in the meantime, keep those healthy and caring messages
coming! You’ll want to make sure the messages are affirmations about her or
your relationship unrelated to food or weight. (Read more about this in
Chapter 23.) 
Arguing puts the focus back on you
It’s a good idea to know when a conversation is no longer useful — or not
useful in its present form. Getting drawn into an argument is one of those 
not-useful times. Teenagers can be particularly skilled at using arguments 
to avoid a subject. It gets the focus off them and on you. For example, your
teenager may say
 “Why are you always accusing me of things I don’t do?”
 “How I eat is none of your business.”
 “You should see the way Dad eats.”
304
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 “I defy you to find one girl in my class who isn’t dieting. Nobody else’s
mom is making a big deal of it.”
 “You’re the one who told me I have to be disciplined about exercise if I
want results.”
If you’re mad or feeling defensive, you can walk right into it. In fact, be certain
that at least sometimes you will. The trick is to notice you’re in it and get
back on track. If you can do that within the same conversation, go to the
head of the class! Sometimes it works to point out the maneuver:
 “You’ve done a good job of getting us to talk about me. Okay, now let’s
get back to the part about you.”
This is where that idea of being centered — trusting your mission — can be
so useful. Your knowledge or suspicion that your child is seriously harming
her health and well-being may help you cut through a lot of flack. You can
respond by saying:
 “I know this is hard to talk about. But we can’t avoid it anymore. Your
health is too important.”
 “We can take up your complaints about me once I’m not so frightened
about your health. Right now that has to come first.”
Finally, you’re not required to keep pitching once the conversation has become
unproductive and there’s no getting it back on track. You can tell your child
you don’t think the way the conversation is going is helping. Taking a breather
can be framed as a useful strategy. You can also forecast getting back to it
with a clear head and maybe some fresh ideas.
Deciding when you need to take action
Your first approach and follow-ups may convince you that you need to do
more than have a heart-to-heart to move the ball up court. You may need 
to step in with parental controls to protect your child by
 Insisting on treatment: Some parents become so intimidated by their
kid, their kid’s anger, or by the eating disorder itself, they don’t know
that it’s okay and often necessary to simply insist. Surprisingly, your
child is often just waiting for you to do this.
 Using leverage: Don’t be afraid to use the controls you have. You’re not
required to give your child access to all the goodies and experiences she
wants if she’s not cooperating with treatment. This includes going away
to school. Some parents find this unthinkable. But consider: Would you
send your child off to school with uncontrolled diabetes? Or a drug
addiction?
305
Chapter 22: Implementing Your Plan to Help

 Taking emergency measures: If your child is refusing treatment and her
health is in serious jeopardy, you can’t wait. (I review the warning signs
for emergency hospitalization in Chapter 9.) You’ll want to involve your
child’s doctor. The nightmare for families is when police have to be
called in for older teens or adult children. One encouraging note is that
even people who are hospitalized involuntarily for anorexia appear to
benefit from it.
Don’t hesitate to seek out an eating disorder expert if you need support or
advice for dealing with your child at this point. The best place to start is with
a family therapist who specializes in eating disorders. Family therapy is prob-
ably going to be part of your child’s treatment plan. The therapist is a good
person to coach you through this early stage.

Making Life Livable While
Supporting Another’s Recovery
In This Chapter
 Discovering the why’s and how’s of disengaging from your child’s eating disorder
 Recognizing helpful and unhelpful forms of support
 Understanding how to hold your child accountable for her eating disorder
 Putting the fun back in family life
 Breaking through recovery traps
T
his chapter is about the day-to-day struggles of living with someone who
has an eating disorder for the long haul of recovery. (I take the perspec-
tive of a parent working with a child, but the principles apply to other rela-
tionships as well.) The appearance of an eating disorder on your doorstep
presents you with many dilemmas and demands for skills you don’t find in
the basic parenting manual. For instance, you need to master the delicate
dance of disengaging from responsibility for your child’s eating disorder
symptoms while holding her accountable for the effects these symptoms
have on you and other family members. You have to find out how to separate
support for her recovery from control of her disorder. And, just as important,
you need to start moving the eating disorder off the center stage of family life.
In this chapter I identify the skills you need to survive and thrive during your
child’s recovery. I discuss how to handle the common obstacles parents run
into when trying to put these skills into practice. Finally, I tell you how to rec-
ognize when you’ve fallen into recovery traps, obstacles that may require 
outside help in order for you to move forward.
At the end of each section, where relevant, I include notes for people who
aren’t parents but live with or have an ongoing relationship with someone
with an eating disorder.

Letting Go and Ending the Food Wars
When you and your child agreed she’d go into treatment for her eating disor-
der, the agreement included putting her in charge of her own recovery. This
is not an arrangement someone drew out of a hat; rather, it’s the only arrange-
ment that can work. Your job with respect to the eating disorder is to pull out
of your child’s frontline struggle with food and weight so she can find her own
way. This is a time when you can go back to being mom or dad instead of ther-
apist or food police. In this section I discuss why that’s so important, what
makes it so hard, and how you can actually go about doing it.
Understanding why letting go is so hard
After your child has begun treatment, you still may have a strong parenting
urge to step in and “help.” If this urge is really strong, ask anyone who’s ever
tried to stop drinking for an alcoholic friend or relative how well that went.
You can’t do it for them. Putting your child in charge of her own recovery is
easier said than done. But it is absolutely the right thing to do.
In fact, you may actually find it helpful to read some Al-Anon literature (Al-
Anon is a support organization for families of people addicted to alcohol) or
attend an Al-Anon meeting. The controls and ways of seeing herself that your
child needs to get well can only come from inside her.
But powerful forces may be pulling you in the opposite direction. Understand-
ing these forces and recognizing that they’re normal equips you to resist them.
It’s natural to be plagued by thoughts like the following:
 You’re the parent, so it’s your job to fix things: Seeing her with her eating
disorder makes you feel, by turn, guilty, frightened, angry, frustrated, and
helpless. Not only is it human nature to want to fix these feelings, but you
also want to make her do something to fix them! You’re used to being in
charge of working out problems that come up in your family and helping
your kids when they’re in trouble. However, the eating disorder is now
being worked out between your child and the therapist. This means you
are now free to truly be a parent.
 You feel that the consequences of the eating disorder are too great to
simply stand by: Visible signs of the disorder are a stab in any parent’s
heart, especially if the child has anorexia. But you aren’t just standing
by. You took the initiative to have “the talk,” and you are providing the
means for your child to be in recovery. Besides, you don’t want to get
pulled back in because becoming re-engaged in struggling over what 
she eats and weighs takes the focus off of her recovery. You may feel 
like you’re helping, but you’re not.
308
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

Does this mean there’s nothing you can do? Absolutely not! Your child still
needs you in all the usual ways children need their parents. I talk about how
important that is later in this chapter. You may also find it reassuring to rec-
ognize that you actually are doing something — something helpful — by dis-
engaging from the frontlines of her fight with her eating disorder. You’re
sending a powerful signal that you believe she’s capable of handling it (even
if sometimes you have to do it by sitting on your hands with your fingers
crossed!). That’s huge to a child who feels inadequate so much of the time. It
means more to her coming from you than from anybody else on the planet.
P.S. It’s perfectly fine to put this message of faith in your child’s ability to
handle her eating disorder into words. Some parents even choose to write
cards or letters conveying such a message to their children.
Disengaging from your child’s disorder
When any kind of crisis involves a family member, everyone naturally focuses
on the problem at the beginning. Family members feel frightened, lack infor-
mation, and want to know how they can help. In the long-haul situation 
presented by an eating disorder, this initial period of intense activity and
involvement needs to give way to the period of disengagement. Not disengage-
ment from your child, but from her eating disorder.
There seems to be a fork in the road where some families are able to move
more-or-less successfully into disengagement. (I say “more-or-less” because
families, so far as I know, are still made up of imperfect people, and nothing
about eating disorder recovery goes smoothly and simply.) How can you rec-
ognize whether you’re still engaging with your child’s eating disorder? If you’re
making statements similar to any of the following, you’re still engaged:
 Threatening: “If you don’t stop purging, I’m going to have you put away.”
 Pleading: “If you only eat a little of this, it will make your dad so happy.”
 Cajoling: “You can take a bite of this. I know you can do it.”
 Bargaining: “If you gain five pounds, you can quit seeing the nutritionist.”
 Bribing: “I’ll give you $10 for every pound you gain.”
 Cheerleading: “I see you’ve lost a few pounds. You look great in your
jeans now. Keep up the good work!”
Did you hear yourself in any of these statements? If so, even though you feel
like you’re helping, you’re actually not. In reality, pulling back from trying to
manage your child’s recovery sends an important message of confidence in
her capabilities. Here are four more reasons to commit to disengagement:
 When you get into a power struggle with your child over the eating
disorder, you lose. Eating disorders are a lesson in humility. The strength
of the survival energy your child focuses through them is awesome.
309
Chapter 23: Making Life Livable While Supporting Another’s Recovery

 By struggling with the eating disorder, you give it more prominence
and power. The more you make it a showdown between your will and
the eating disorder, the more you give it center stage.
 The more you focus on the eating disorder, the more other family
members resent the person with the eating disorder. She’s robbing
them of air time and negating the family’s other interests. 
 All the patterns of engagement I just listed (threatening, bribing, and
so on) suggest your child can just turn off the eating disorder if she
wants to. This is actually a very American idea: If you just put in enough
incentive, you can make the change you want happen. But the motiva-
tion for eating disorder behavior actually has to do with desperately
hanging onto feelings of personal control and worth. Threats, bribes,
and the rest don’t mean very much compared to these values.
Coming to terms with letting go
Many parents find the realization that they can’t fix their child’s eating disor-
der extremely hard to digest. The reality of being powerless over your child’s
eating disorder may stir up feelings of guilt, failure, or other negative emo-
tions. The good news is that this is a normal reaction, and you can reason
yourself out of the emotion and into the truth. The following examples begin
with the negative emotional expression of a parent, and proceed to debunk
the fallacy by replacing it with the truth, or reality:
 “I don’t matter in my child’s life anymore.” Of course you do! Your
child is more than her eating disorder. She will always need you in one
way or another. The way she needs you will change, just as the way you
needed your own parents changed over time.
310
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 
The all-hands-on-deck Maudsley exception
In Chapter 12 I describe a family approach for
the treatment of children and young adoles-
cents who have anorexia that’s the opposite of
everything I just said. The Maudsley approach
puts the family in charge of getting their child to
eat and gain weight. It’s completely hands-on 
in comparison to the hands-off recommenda-
tions I make in this chapter. What you need to
know about Maudsley is that
1. The hands-on work is done under highly
specific guidelines.
2. The hands-on phase ends when the child’s
weight takes her out of jeopardy. Then
recovery reverts to the hands-off prescrip-
tion for the family when it comes to eating
disorder symptoms.

 “I’m a failure as a parent.” Normal parenting doesn’t include the treat-
ment of eating disorders — as if you’re a therapist! Keep in mind that
children are independent beings who can and do make choices parents
don’t like. Other powerful influences in your child’s life may contend
with your best parenting.
 If I can’t control a problem in my child, can I control anything? It’s
normal to feel like everything is falling apart in the middle of a crisis.
Even the tiniest problem looms larger than it is. For reassurance, focus
your efforts on other parts of your life that are not in crisis and not tied
to the eating disorder.
Letting go is a good and positive act, and a natural part of all good parenting.
Coming to terms with your inability to make your child get better means
these three things are happening:
 You and your child are moving on to a different kind of relationship:
Both of you are entering a stage of development in which “help” is more
about moral support and example than trying to fix another person.
 You’re willing to change yourself to supply what your child needs most:
Remember when she needed you to help steer her bike? Remember the
moment when she needed you to let go instead? Her eating disorder is
just like that. The time comes when what your child needs most is for
you to let go.
 You’re “getting it” about the eating disorder: You’re beginning to see
your child’s fight for identity and worth, which is tied up with the eating
disorder. This is a sign of respect for your child’s struggles.
If you find you’re unable to make behavioral changes around control or you
can’t come to terms with this change of role in your child’s life, you may want
to talk it over with a counselor or therapist. Often the question of control can
be very loaded with issues from your own history. It can be helpful to disen-
tangle historic issues from the present.
You can’t guarantee that your child will use the space and confidence you offer
her to work toward an effective recovery. You can only be sure you’ll block her
efforts if you step in and try to manage her eating disorder yourself.
Taking “Fat Talk” Off the Table
“Fat talk” is your child’s obsessive preoccupation with her own body weight
and shape. You may start to wonder if she thinks about anything else. (Answer:
Not much.) In this section I go over some important things to keep in mind
when deciding how to interact with “fat talk.”
311
Chapter 23: Making Life Livable While Supporting Another’s Recovery

Refusing to acknowledge “fat talk”
Engaging you in “fat talk” is one of the ways your child draws you in to her
eating disorder. She may do this if you’re being particularly effective at disen-
gaging and she doesn’t know how else to reassure herself you’re still there.
Or she may do it to test whether she can trust you to really back off. Or she
may just do it because this is what somebody with an eating disorder does.
How many times have you heard her ask
 “Do I look fat?”
 “Does this dress make me look fat?”
 “Have I gained weight?”
 “Are my thighs too big?”
My advice when you hear any of these? Run! It’s a trap! Well, even if you don’t
run, you still need to know it’s a trap. Someone with an eating disorder digests
anything you say about weight and size badly. She doesn’t trust the good stuff
and she hammers herself with any negative stuff. You need to stake out your
turf clearly with her: Tell her you’re not going to respond to these questions
precisely because they are no-win for her — and then remind her of that each
time she asks again.
The dinner table version of “fat talk” is “calorie talk.” The family meal should-
n’t be dominated by eating disordered thinking. If your child still can’t stop
herself from counting every calorie, she at least needs to do it on her own
time and not pull the family meal down with her. You can’t make her better 
by reassuring her you used bouillon instead of fat, no matter how anxious
she seems.
Cheering nonfat positives
Cheerleading involves making positive statements about developments in
your child’s weight as she progresses in recovery. For a person with anorexia,
weight gain is progress. For someone with bulimia or BED, it may be weight
loss. This kind of cheerleading is exactly what your child doesn’t need. It’s
counterproductive.
The idea that cheering on her weight gain (or loss) is bad may be puzzling for
you. What’s wrong with supporting and complimenting progress? This is
where it gets tricky with your child with an eating disorder. She simply can’t
engage in talk about size and weight in a healthy way, no matter what your
intentions. What’s more — and this is the most important point — she’s 
convinced that size and weight are all that matter about her. The more you
312
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

comment on them, the more she believes you think the same thing. (She also
notices how much you focus on your own size and weight and on those of
other people.)
The most healing kind of support you can offer her right now is to notice
progress that has nothing to do with her weight. Cheer on positive growth
and maturity in every other area of accomplishment. For example:
 Her pursuit of a sport
 Her success on the debate team
 Her cleaning up her room
 Her helping a sibling with his homework
While you need to keep a hands-off approach with the eating disorder, you
can be totally hands-on by providing nonfat-related sincere, positive, encour-
aging messages. This is an example of how you can really contribute to your
child’s recovery. After all, who doesn’t like to hear positive encouragement!
Insisting on Accountability
An eating disorder isn’t brain death. Adolescence isn’t either. But people get
confused about both. For the sake of both your family and your child with the
eating disorder, you need to hold her accountable for her behavior, just like
everybody else.
Eating disorder behaviors can affect other members of the family in a lot of
ways. Not good ways. You may be allowing these negative behaviors to stand
with no consequence because they’re part of your child’s disorder. Maybe
you think if you can’t control the disorder, you can’t control anything related
to it. Maybe you’re accustomed to treating your child with the eating disor-
der with kid gloves, or maybe you’re a little intimidated by her ability to get
angry and withdraw.
313
Chapter 23: Making Life Livable While Supporting Another’s Recovery
Just say no to monitoring
People with eating disorders often ask partners,
friends, or roommates to monitor their eating or
purging behavior. Resist! It never works. You can’t
be with the person 24/7, which is what the oper-
ation requires. Besides, the only way the person
you love is going to get better is by finding out
how to install her own internal monitor. When you
collude in a plan that suggests somebody else
can do the work of recovery for her, you only 
help her put off the day when she has to come to
terms with the need to do it herself.

These reactions on your part, especially a failure to set limits on the effects
of eating disorder behaviors on others, have negative effects of their own. 
For example:
 Letting others be harmed without consequence makes the eating disor-
der a bigger and bigger part of family life.
 Allowing your child with the eating disorder to run roughshod over
everyone else’s rights just makes your other kids resent her.
 Not holding your child with the eating disorder to account for what she
does tells her you think she can’t control herself — something she’s
already afraid is true.
Paying for wrong behavior
If you can’t just tell your child to cut it out with the eating disorder behaviors,
what can you do? Try not to let the fact that the behaviors are based on an
eating disorder negate your skills as a parent. You’ve been handling misbe-
havior in your kids for a long time. What do you do if one of your kids takes 
a toy or a book from another sibling? If it can’t be returned, she has to find a
way to pay for it, probably out of her allowance, right?
Food taken for bingeing is no different. Depending on how your family divvies
up food, you may have to do some fancy footwork to figure out exactly what
fine to assess. But doing it is crucial. It allows everybody else to feel they’re
living in a fair family, and it keeps the child with the eating disorder within
the fairness fold. Other common examples in families include insisting that
someone who binges clean up the kitchen after a binge and that someone
who purges clean up the bathroom after she purges.
Making rules with roommates or spouses
You can’t levy fines on a spouse or a roommate. But you can negotiate the
effects of eating disorder behavior just the way you negotiate anything else 
in your relationship, like leaving dirty clothes on the bathroom floor or
dishes in the sink. You may have to go to greater lengths than you like to
divvy up food or figure out how to handle the situation when she binges her
way through your favorite stuff while she’s still symptomatic. But successful
negotiating always strengthens relationships.
If a roommate with an eating disorder can’t stick to rules you and she have
agreed on, you may have to figure out your own bottom line for continuing to
live with her. If this is your partner, you need to let her know how her failure
to respect your agreement is harming the relationship.
314
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

Focusing Outside the Eating Disorder
This chapter is full of don’ts. Don’t try to control the eating disorder. Don’t
comment on your child’s weight. Don’t let her run roughshod over the family
with eating disorder behavior. With so many don’ts, is there anything positive
you can do? Yes, actually, plenty! You can focus on other aspects of your
child and other parts of family life that don’t involve the eating disorder.
Seeing beyond the eating disorder
Just because you can’t fix your child’s eating disorder doesn’t mean she
doesn’t need you anymore. Your child has wandered off into an obsession
with food and weight. She’s lost her way with growing up and engaging in 
the world, and seeing what matters most in life. Your steady focus on the
bigger picture contributes to your child’s recovery.
Putting the eating disorder in perspective
Think of your child as having different parts to her personality. Actually, she’s
just like everyone else this way. For instance, the demands of your workplace
probably bring forward different aspects of yourself than a casual evening
with your friends. Though your child may be leading with the eating disorder
part of her personality right now, other aspects or parts are within her than
can be drawn forward. What can you do to help bring forward the non-eating
disorder parts of your child?
You can ask for normalcy. Keep expecting your child to do her share to help
make the family run. Unless she needs hospitalization, she can do her chores.
The eating disorder part of her may be behaving in a very young way.
Insisting that she do her share for the family tells her you see another part of
her that can be responsible and be a contributor like other kids her age.
You can emphasize enjoyable activities you two can share that have nothing
to do with food and weight. What else have you two enjoyed doing in the
past? Do you love to go antiquing? Do you both knit? Sail? Walk in the neigh-
borhood to see what’s new? Volunteer at the women’s shelter? There’s no
guarantee that if you reach out to a part of your child that can enjoy such
activities, your child will be able to reach back — at least not all the time. But
by reaching out, you deliver the message that you see more to her than the
eating disorder. The message isn’t lost on her.
Taking recovery in phases
You can think of getting better from an eating disorder as having two phases.
One involves reducing the acute symptoms of the disorder — dieting, restrict-
ing, bingeing, purging. The other involves building up an inner arsenal of 
315
Chapter 23: Making Life Livable While Supporting Another’s Recovery

personal strengths and qualities that help prevent relapse. This phase includes
increasing self-esteem and developing a sense of identity and worth that
doesn’t depend on weight.
I say pretty clearly earlier in this chapter that your child has to be the one
who takes control of her symptoms. When all is said and done, she’s also the
one in charge of her longer-term recovery. But you can be an important con-
tributor. (You can read more about recovery skills in Chapters 8 and 14.)
The following is a list of milestones your child needs to achieve for a solid
recovery. You can’t force-feed any of them to her, any more than you can
force-feed her food. But you can challenge your child’s eating disordered 
way of thinking. And here’s a suggestion that can have the most impact on
her: You can do your best to model a healthier version in yourself. Important
recovery milestones include
 Knowing that worth doesn’t depend on weight: Even though your child
has forgotten that other things matter about her besides her weight, you
haven’t. I mention earlier that you can specifically choose these other
qualities to praise and support (see the section “Cheering nonfat posi-
tives”). Notice how much emphasis you give to your own weight versus
other qualities, especially in your child’s presence.
 Living with imperfection: You don’t have to jump on board with your
child’s position that only perfection is good enough. You can cultivate a
problem-solving approach to mistakes to replace her catastrophic one.
Keep in mind that she gleans the most from how she sees you handle
your own mistakes and imperfections.
 Graying up black-and-white thinking: Your child thinks things are all
one way or another. If she makes a mistake, she’s ruined everything. If
you criticize her, everyone is against her. If she didn’t make class dele-
gate, high school is over for her and nobody likes her. You can challenge
whether these extremes are actually the only possible responses. She
needs help seeing that gray area exists between these extremes. You
may want to talk out loud when you’re looking for gray areas that don’t
involve your child: a compromise in a dispute, a number of possible
ways to solve a dilemma, a moral situation that can be seen from differ-
ent points of view, and so on.
 Tolerating emotions: Your child needs to discover that she can tolerate
difficult feelings instead of trying to diet or binge her way out of them.
You can help her by being available to talk about her feelings and making
it clear that you’re okay with those feelings, even if they’re intense. You
can also help by expressing feelings your child brings up in you. You can
say, “That’s making me angry” (or scared, or warm and fuzzy, or annoyed).
The trick is to make sure your child knows you don’t expect her to fix
your feelings. Your child also picks up plenty from situations that don’t
involve her — when she sees that you’re coping with difficult feelings,
rather than hiding them or losing control.

 Honoring relationship boundaries: You don’t read her mail. You don’t
ask what she said in therapy. You don’t need to know the secrets between
her and her sister (assuming they’re safe and legal). You let her finish
her thoughts. You don’t assume her feelings and opinions are the same
as yours. All of these are ways you convey that you see your child as a
separate person and that’s fine by you. People with eating disorders want
to please others by agreeing. Your child may find it hard to believe that
she’s entitled to privacy or even has her own point of view. You can help!
Bringing “normal” back to family life
There’s more to your child than her eating disorder. And there’s more to your
family than having a child with an eating disorder. Shifting all the focus to the
eating disorder during a period of acute crisis is normal. (Usually this covers
the time of intensifying symptoms, the initial talk, and the period of finding
treatment.) But eating disorder recovery is a long-term project. Taking steps
to move out of crisis mode and reclaim as much normal family life as possible
is important for everyone.
The return to normal doesn’t happen automatically. Instead, families typically
start by simply reorganizing themselves around the requirements of the
member with the problem. That’s true whether the problem is an eating dis-
order, some other psychological disorder (like substance abuse or a phobia),
or a chronic physical illness. Either due to guilt or exhaustion, other aspects
of family life or the needs of other family members become secondary —
which means they often get dropped altogether. Mealtimes and leisure times
get particularly disrupted in families where a member has an eating disorder.
Enjoying mealtimes at home and dining out
Mealtimes are important times for coming together in many families. Family
members who have gone their way during the day get to catch up with each
other. People share fun, facts, ideas, and stories. When you have a child with
an eating disorder, a lot of this may disappear. Mealtimes may become so ten-
sion-filled that other family members drift away to find a more peaceful place
to eat. Or the menu may cater so much to eating disordered worries that
nobody else wants to eat what’s on the table. Or the person with the eating
disorder may refuse to join the rest of the family.
How do you start to get life back to normal? Tell yourself, here and elsewhere,
that as much as possible you’re going to move the eating disorder off center
stage. You’ve gone a long way in this direction if you’ve quit trying to control
your child’s eating and have taken “fat talk” off the table (suggestions I make
earlier in the chapter). Next you need to promise yourself that the food 
317
Chapter 23: Making Life Livable While Supporting Another’s Recovery

preferences and phobias of the child with the eating disorder don’t get to dic-
tate everything you do around the dinner table. Here are a few guidelines for
putting that promise into action:
 Make what you normally make for family meals: You have one child
with an eating disorder, not an entire family. Plan meals for the healthy
family, not the unhealthy eating disorder.
 Don’t make special meals for her: She needs to be the one to take
responsibility for her eating disorder. The more you move the effects 
of the disorder off your shoulders and onto hers, the more you help 
her grow up.
 Negotiate her presence at the table: This is especially important if meals
serve that social gathering and sharing purpose in your family. If she can
be there for the main course, but not dessert, then that’s your deal. If
she can’t tolerate being there for any food right now, ask her to come at
coffee time after dinner. Or arrange for everyone to be at the table for
ten minutes before you serve the meal.
 Don’t go to eating disorder restaurants: She gets her place in the rota-
tion of restaurant choices only if she chooses places at least the major-
ity of the family likes.
Having fun with leisure activities
Leisure activities — the fun, relaxing times — usually go overboard first with
an eating disorder diagnosis. And they’re usually last in line to return. The
sad thing is that the family especially needs them after weathering such a
crisis. Like mealtime, shared leisure is a chance for family members to feel 
a sense of being valued by each other, of belonging and well-being.
The child with the eating disorder is better off in a family that’s gotten back
to some shared leisure times, whether she can participate or not. Why is that
true? Here are a few reasons:
 She can always jump in: She needs ways to practice being something
other than eating disordered. And she needs to connect to her family 
in ways that have nothing to do with her eating disorder.
 She gets reassurance that she hasn’t ruined the family: Family mem-
bers with eating disorders carry around a lot of guilt for what they’ve
put their families through.
 She gets reassurance that she’s not the queen of the family or the
family bully: The presence of other activities helps move the eating 
disorder off center stage. Kids aren’t well-served by feeling they have
the power to run their families, either directly or indirectly.
 She gets some breathing room to take ownership of her eating disor-
der: When everyone in the family isn’t hovering over her eating disorder
because they have other things to focus on, she’s more likely to take
responsibility for it herself.
318
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 She’s being provided with a model of balance in life: Most people with
eating disorders aren’t very good with the idea of living in a balanced way
(for example, a balance of work and play). Perfect discipline is more what
they have in mind as a model of the good life. Remember: She learns
more from what you do than what you say.
You can’t make your child’s life better by sandbagging the rest of family life in
the name of her eating disorder. You help her more by restoring sanity and
health to the rest of your family. Rejuicing your family’s shared leisure life is 
a way for you to put your instincts to do something to effective work.
Breaking through Recovery Traps
A recovery trap is anything that presents an obstacle to following through
with the guidelines for recovery. Obstacles can come from inside you, such
as feelings, beliefs, or fears. They can also be reactions you encounter in the
person with the eating disorder.
Recovery traps are serious. They can stop a person’s recovery in its tracks or
slow it down to a trickle. They can also interfere with a family’s recovery.
(After all, you’ve been through plenty, too.) Don’t wait to address them! Your
situation will only get worse if you do.
In Chapter 11, I go over some common reasons families with eating disordered
members seek out family treatment. If you’re already in family treatment, this
can be a great place to work out any of the recovery traps I list in this sec-
tion. If you’re not in family treatment, getting it can provide just the help you
need to break through any recovery traps you may be stuck in.
Consider yourself in a recovery trap if you or other key family members
 Can’t surrender efforts to control your child’s weight or eating.
 Can’t stop commenting on your child’s weight gains and losses. (Not
counting emergency situations where you think weight loss may require
hospitalization or some different level of intervention than the current
one.)
 Can’t ask your child with the eating disorder to take responsibility for
the effects of her behaviors on others.
 Can’t follow through even when you set up such expectations.
 Can’t ask your child with the eating disorder to do her share of family
chores.
 Can’t stop arranging meals to suit the child with the eating disorder.
319
Chapter 23: Making Life Livable While Supporting Another’s Recovery

 Can’t bring yourself to arrange leisure activities for yourself or the rest
of the family.
 Can’t find anything to think about or talk about besides the eating 
disorder.
You may also be stuck in a recovery trap if
 Your entire relationship with your child with the eating disorder focuses
on her eating disorder.
 Your family life revolves around the eating disorder.
 The child with the eating disorder doesn’t comply with any of the expec-
tations you set.
 The child with the eating disorder continues to boycott all aspects of
family life (not counting adult children).
 The child with the eating disorder is seriously disrupting family life, for
instance, with temper tantrums or stealing.
Your family therapist can help you in a number of ways. For instance, she may
help you
 Discover fears or beliefs that block more appropriate recovery behavior
 Address your fears or beliefs in ways that don’t harm your child’s 
recovery
 Figure out rules and expectations that work for your family
 Explore ways to make your family life feel more satisfying
Families who use family treatment often find they get more out of it than reso-
lution of their problems. In the process of solving problems, they usually gain
insights and skills that make them stronger than when they started. Family
members often feel they understand each other better and can solve problems
on their own more effectively in the future.

Chapter 24
Finding Support for Yourself While
Supporting Another’s Recovery
In This Chapter
 Recognizing the need for counseling or support for yourself
 Making decisions for yourself, independent of your child’s treatment decisions
 Identifying treatment and support options and how to find them
T
he person with the eating disorder isn’t the only one in need of support!
Eating disorders inflict a lot of wear-and-tear on everyone in the family.
Parents of children who relapse or who have long-term struggles with their
disorders get hit particularly hard.
You may have been drawn into such a worried or angry battle with the eating
disorder that you barely know how to focus on yourself anymore. The rest of
your family life may be in tatters. You may not recognize some of your own
behaviors or reactions. You may worry that sometimes when you’re trying to
help, you’re hurting instead. Your relationships with other people may be suf-
fering. You may be literally sick from worry, grief, anger, or exhaustion.
All of these effects on caregivers can be normal and temporary. How do you
recognize when these or other negative effects are taking root and require
more attention? What type of support can help prevent you from getting to
that stage in the first place? If your child is stonewalling treatment for herself,
does it make any difference what you do for yourself? How do you identify
the right kind of services for the trouble you’re having? How do you find
those services? These are the kinds of questions I take up in this chapter.
I address this material to parents (and others) involved in long-term care-giving
and treatment decisions for a child (or other loved one) with an eating disor-
der. Although the decision-making responsibilities are different in a partner-
ship, much of the chapter applies to couples’ relationships as well.

Knowing When to Seek 
Treatment for Yourself
When you have such an important role as caregiver and support person,
everything you do and every reaction you have to your child has a magnified
effect. (But no pressure!) You feel the effects of the eating disorder more than
others. And your child is more affected by your responses to it.
As your child’s recovery develops, taking care of yourself becomes part of
taking care of her. This includes recognizing when living with an eating disor-
der is taking too much of a toll and is affecting your ability to be supportive.
You may need to come to terms with personal problems that jeopardize your
role as caregiver. You also want to be aware of ways in which your reactions
to the eating disorder interfere with your child’s recovery. In this section I go
over the warning signals of a potential caregiver meltdown, and I discuss why
seeking treatment is a useful option.
Contributing to family recovery traps
In Chapter 23 I identify recovery traps as obstacles that prevent the kinds of
behaviors necessary for your family to support your child’s recovery. Usually,
recovery traps are fueled by some internal fear, doubt, or misgiving about
how the appropriate recovery behavior may change things. For instance,
some parents worry that they aren’t needed anymore if they can’t fix the
eating disorder. Or that they’re inadequate if a professional helps in a way
they can’t. Or that their child may change in ways they can’t relate to as she
gets better. Most fears like these operate outside conscious awareness, so it
can be hard to get a handle on them.
Here are some signs that you’re stuck in a recovery trap and may need some
help becoming unstuck:
 You can’t stop trying to manage the behavior of your child with the
eating disorder.
 You can’t focus on anything but the eating disorder with your child.
 You find it difficult to engage in parts of life that don’t involve the eating
disorder.
In Chapter 23 I suggest family therapy as a good option for getting unstuck
from recovery traps. However, it may seem to you that your own strong feel-
ings are the biggest obstacle in a particular trap. In that case, you may appre-
ciate some individual work to sort out what’s getting in your way and figure
out how you can move through it more comfortably.
322
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

Having difficulty managing your emotions
A child’s eating disorder turns your life upside down and leaves you feeling
unskilled as a parent and often as if you no longer know your child. Under 
circumstances like these, any of the following reactions are normal:
 Guilt, feelings of failure
 Anger, outrage
 Fear
 Mistrust
Such feelings will probably come and go throughout your child’s recovery.
The more you can accept them as normal, the less disruptive and upsetting
they’re likely to be to you. And the more likely they are to pass on through.
But how do you know when such feelings have become more than a normal
response? The key is that our usual mechanisms for digesting emotion shut
down when an emotion feels like too much to handle. Instead of passing
through, the emotion gets stuck inside. Here are some signals that one or
more of your emotions may have hit the too much point and gotten stuck:
 You’ve become paralyzed and can’t take necessary action: Guilt or fear
of anger (hers or yours) stops you from setting appropriate limits on
your child’s behavior.
 You don’t feel like you can be close with your child: Your feelings are
causing you to distance yourself from your child.
 You’re too close with your child: You’ve gotten too involved as a way to
“make up” for negative feelings.
 The relationship with your child feels fake or lifeless: You can’t let
spontaneous or honest feelings come through for fear they’ll be the 
negative ones.
If you look at the preceding list of warning signals, you notice a common
thread. Stuck emotions usually result in a stuck way of interacting with the
other person. When the other person is your child with the eating disorder, 
it means you’ve lost some of your flexibility for responding to her because 
of the way your feelings are affecting you.
Feeling despair and hopelessness
Eating disorder recovery tends to be a long road, filled with potholes, wrong
turns, and standstills. It’s nearly inevitable that at one time or another you’re
going to throw up your hands and believe things will never get better. 
323
Chapter 24: Finding Support for Yourself While Supporting Another’s Recovery

You’re especially vulnerable when your child suffers her own setbacks. It can
also occur when you’ve just run out of steam for one reason or another. For
example, you may be ill, too many other problems may have piled up in the
family at the same time, or you may be feeling criticized about how you handle
things. Normally, the rough patch ends, and the feelings of despair lift along
with it.
But sometimes a rough patch can hang around for a little too long. Or there
can be too many rough patches. Maybe you’re juggling too much with too
little support. Or maybe your personal history makes you especially vulnera-
ble to these kinds of feelings (for example, you had a depressed or anxious
parent or one who responded to adversity with doom and gloom). These or
other features of your particular situation can make it difficult to keep bounc-
ing back throughout your child’s recovery.
Sometimes feelings of despair and hopelessness develop to a point where
they become dangerous. If any of the following apply to you, you should 
seek out help as soon as possible:
 Feelings of despair and hopelessness are paralyzing you: You feel help-
less to act in the face of such overwhelming odds. Or you wonder why
you should bother.
 Once-in-a-while feelings of despair or hopelessness are gelling into a
state of steady depression: At some point, your ability to bounce back
disappeared. Not only are you feeling pessimistic about your child’s
recovery, you’re feeling pessimistic about everything. You’ve probably
slipped into a clinical depression. (You can read more about depression
in Chapter 7.)
 You feel suicidal: Despair and hopelessness are often triggers for suici-
dal feelings. If you have suicidal impulses and aren’t sure you can manage
them, immediately call 911 or head for a hospital emergency room. If
you’re having thoughts and feelings without immediate urgency to act,
this is a definite signal to get support or treatment. (Read more about
sizing up suicidal feelings in Chapter 7.)
Putting your problems on hold
If only eating disorders had the courtesy to wait until all other problems in
the family were under control! Your may have sent your own problems to the
back of the line when the eating disorder hit. But of course this is an arrange-
ment that can’t work for very long, especially if your own problems get in the
way of your leadership role in the family. When you’re not okay, it affects
everybody (not the least of whom is you!) in a big way.
Some kinds of problems can take a big bite out of your own well-being and
the well-being of your family. These problems include
324
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 Depression
 Anxiety, panic
 Alcohol or substance abuse
 Low self-worth
 Anger management problems
These kinds of problems don’t tend to get better on their own. In fact, they
often tend to get worse. (You can read more about recognizing and treating
depression, anxiety, and addictions in Chapter 7.) Putting yourself last when
it comes to choosing a movie or naming the new puppy is one thing. Putting
yourself last when your problems impair your ability to parent is definitely
not a good idea.
Turning Your Attention to Your Needs
Many times parents get paralyzed when a child digs in her heels and refuses
treatment for an eating disorder. The logic seems to be that the child with the
eating disorder is the only gateway to the entire community of treatment for
her family. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
More and more services — although still not nearly enough — are developing
for families of people with eating disorders. None of these services require
that your child be in treatment for you to get their benefits. In this section I
review the circumstances that may lead you to seek services without your
child’s participation or cooperation. Then I discuss some effects you can
expect to see, even if your child boycotts treatment.
Seeing a therapist even if your child won’t
Even if your child refuses to go to therapy, you (and other members of your
family) have more than enough reasons to go ahead without her. You may be
mostly in need of support and reassurance. Maybe you need to hear how
other parents who’ve been down this road have coped or handled similar sit-
uations — and survived! (See the section “Support groups for families and
parents” later in this chapter for more on how to find them.)
Treatment for you as a parent often addresses how your child’s eating disor-
der is affecting you. But your concerns may also have to do with how issues of
yours are affecting your child. (My discussion of recovery traps in Chapter 23
and in the section “Contributing to family recovery traps” earlier in this chap-
ter provides some good examples.) You don’t need your child’s cooperation
to do some soul searching on issues that may affect your support for her
recovery.
325
Chapter 24: Finding Support for Yourself While Supporting Another’s Recovery

You may be surprised to learn that your family can also go to family therapy,
even if your child with the eating disorder boycotts (assuming the child is old
enough to boycott). Of course, this arrangement isn’t ideal. But that shouldn’t
deprive the rest of your family from a therapy experience and the support
and advice you may need. Besides, the therapist may have some ideas for
helping you bring the holdout in. Or she may find it too hard to keep holding
out when everyone else keeps going.
Setting an example with your treatment
You can’t cure your child’s eating disorder. But you can help your family
create an environment that supports her recovery. The helping environment
of her family is one more resource your child can draw on as she faces getting
better. Some of the changes you can bring about in therapy, even without
your child’s participation, can have a big impact. For example:
 You can get assistance with personal problems that make it hard to
parent: This helps both you and your child.
 You can desensitize buttons your child is pushing: Things quiet down
and you make better choices about how to respond when your child isn’t
getting under your skin so much with her behavior.
 You can stop engaging in recovery trap behavior: When you can figure
out what’s keeping you stuck in behavior that blocks your child’s recov-
ery, her chances of moving forward are that much better.
 Your family can change in ways that no longer support an eating dis-
order but instead support recovery: Families usually have to change
something about the way they do business to help a child with an eating
disorder get better. Maybe your family needs to communicate more
openly. Or share feelings. Or put less emphasis on appearances. All of
this can happen with or without the presence of the child with the eating
disorder in treatment. And all of it helps.
Sending a positive message
Your children learn more from what you do than what you say. A child can
learn some important things when she won’t go to treatment but you go
anyway. Some of the most helpful messages you send by doing so include
 Caring: When you go to therapy or a support group to talk about your
child’s eating disorder, regardless of what she’s doing about treatment,
you send a powerful message of your caring and concern. You don’t
allow her boycott to be the last word on the subject of getting help.
326
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 Modeling: When you go for your own treatment, you model some impor-
tant lessons, such as
• This is one way a responsible person can step up and deal with her
problems.
• This is something that you can do to help. (Of course, this message
works best when your child sees you are getting better!)
• You don’t have to be crazy to go to a therapist.
 Taking care of yourself: Many children with eating disorders get caught
up in trying to take care of their parents’ emotions. They do so at the
expense of their own needs and recovery. When you find other help, you
make it clear to your child that she can retire from this inappropriate
caretaking and focus on herself.
 Taking charge: Children with eating disorders often feel too central to
and too much in charge of what happens in their families. They can actu-
ally find it a relief (though they probably can’t admit it) for you to take
back your rightful place in making decisions that affect you and the
family.
Finding the Help That’s Right for You
Finding the kind of help that’s right for you involves knowing what to look for
and where to look. Knowing what to look for means knowing what your goals
are. For example, maybe you want to change something about yourself that
has surfaced while dealing with your child’s eating disorder, or maybe you
just want more information about your child’s disorder. In the first part of
this section, I help you match up your needs with the kinds of services that
can best meet them. In the second part of the section, I tell you where to look
for providers of these services.
Knowing what choices are available
You can go in any one of several directions to get help for yourself. The direc-
tion you choose depends primarily on the kind of help you need. It also
depends on finding the right format at a price you can afford. The main
options include
 Individual therapy
 Couples therapy
 Parent counseling
 Family support groups
327
Chapter 24: Finding Support for Yourself While Supporting Another’s Recovery

 Online resources
 Psychoeducational groups
I describe each of these options in the following sections and discuss what
may make you choose one over another. I also go over online options.
Individual therapy
Therapy aims at changing something about you. (This is different from support,
which aims at helping you cope with a difficult situation.) Maybe the change
you want is to get rid of a symptom, like anxiety or depression. Or maybe you
want to change the way you think or feel about something, like constantly
doubting or criticizing yourself. Or you may want to change a behavior, like
allowing others to take advantage of you or flying off the handle too easily.
If you have a child with an eating disorder, two situations can make you think
about changing something about yourself. The first is when you suspect that
something you’re doing or saying is interfering with your child’s recovery.
Examples of this are the recovery traps I discuss earlier in this chapter (see
the section “Contributing to family recovery traps”) and in Chapter 23, like
trying to control your child’s eating or commenting on her weight.
The other thing you may want to change is your reaction to your child’s eating
disorder, and the effect it’s having on you. This includes the emotional reac-
tions I discuss earlier in this chapter, such as anger, fear, depression, guilt,
and hopelessness. Remember, all these reactions are normal. You’re most
likely to seek therapy when you get stuck in one or more of them and support
isn’t enough to help you get unstuck.
Individual therapy comes in many shapes and sizes. Some types of therapy
are set up to be short term, say 12 to 20 sessions. Others take as long as they
take. Some, like cognitive-behavioral therapy, focus only on the present.
Others, like psychodynamic psychotherapy, assume current problems are
rooted in the past, so they include exploration of your childhood. (You can
read about individual therapy approaches in greater detail in Chapter 10.)
Couples therapy
A child with an eating disorder can expose the fault lines in any marriage — or
produce new ones. Signs that your child’s eating disorder is taking too big a
bite out of your marriage and some couples counseling may be in order include
 Your relationship with your partner has gotten ragged from the eating
disorder wear-and-tear (for instance, you feel too distant or too exhausted
to connect).
 You can’t agree on how to handle your child.
328
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 You fight constantly.
 Other aspects of your relationship have gone out the window (sex, 
hobbies, vacations, and so on).
In couples therapy you work on how you operate as a couple. You discover
how to change some steps so you can both feel more satisfied with the way
things go between you.
Parent counseling
Parent counseling doesn’t aim at changing or improving you. Rather, it aims
at educating you and supplying you with ideas about how to help a child with
an eating disorder. It’s likely to provide support as well. Parent counseling
may be part of a larger package in which you alternate the parent counseling
with sessions with the entire family. Conversely, you may seek out parent
counseling separate from any treatment your child is in.
Support groups for families or parents
Those who live with someone with an eating disorder have specific needs.
These needs include
 Information
 Guidance
 Emotional support
Family and parent support groups have developed to respond to these needs.
Groups are an effective, efficient way to get information to lots of people.
More importantly, they draw on the power of people going through similar
experiences to understand, validate, comfort, and, when necessary, challenge
each other.
Some support groups are open to all concerned others, while other support
groups are just for parents. Some are facilitated by an eating disorder profes-
sional who supplies information and/or keeps an agenda on track. Other 
support groups are led by a volunteer, usually somebody who’s been in the
group for awhile. Some groups are time-limited, and you are expected to
attend every session. Others are ongoing and you can attend whenever you
want to.
A support group meeting may feature an invited speaker who gives a presenta-
tion on some eating disorder topic. This is likely to be followed by a question-
and-answer period. Other support groups may discuss a subject introduced
by the group leader at each meeting. For example: How should you handle
insurance problems? What should you do when your child asks, “Am I fat?”
329
Chapter 24: Finding Support for Yourself While Supporting Another’s Recovery

How can you cope with long-term emotional exhaustion? Still other groups
allow members to bring up whatever is on their minds at meetings.
Support groups can supply useful places to
 Discover you’re not the only one: Having an eating disorder in the family
takes you off the known path. Sometimes what you go through feels
extreme and confusing. It can be a great relief to find out that other
people have had similar experiences or shared similar reactions. It can
also be quite a comfort to know you’re not in this alone.
 Talk about all the reactions and feelings you’re having that aren’t so
helpful to share with your child: For example, your desire to ship her 
to Patagonia or your impulse to run away or your fears that she won’t
make it.
 Lean on and confide in other adults instead of your child: Your child
will try to be your friend if you ask her to. But this interferes with her
development and with her recovery.
 Get ideas and support for handling new or tough situations: In a group,
other parents have faced what you’re facing. You can call on the collec-
tive wisdom and experience of members who’ve already been through it.
 Get backup when you’re taking unpopular positions with your child:
Your child isn’t going to reassure you that you’re doing the right thing.
But you can have a whole chorus of grownups who will!
 Receive congratulations for your successes, and commiseration and
suggestions when your plans don’t work out so well: When you’re trying
to grow and do hard things, it can be really helpful to have witnesses for
your efforts, people who understand how much courage they take.
Online support
Online support for parents and families has been increasing, just like all the
other services available on the Internet. Online forums fill an important need
for people who don’t have support groups or other eating disorder services
where they live (usually rural areas). Many people who can’t bring themselves
to participate in groups face-to-face also find that online services provide a
solution.
Online support can take place in forums like the following:
 Chat rooms: Conversation can take place in real time in text or by voice
hookup. This allows formation of online support groups with ongoing
membership, just like face-to-face groups. Or you can chat with whoever
is in a chat room whenever it’s convenient for you to enter.
 Newsgroups: Postings on a particular topic are e-mailed to subscribers.
You can read them or not, respond or not, or ask for input for yourself —
or not.
330
Part IV: Advice and Help for Families and Others Who Care 

 Message boards: A Web site-sponsored message board posts questions
and comments from participants, just like a bulletin board in an office.
You are free to comment on a posting or just read what others post. The
arrangement allows you to come and go according to your own schedule.
Any of these groups may or may not have a professional moderator. Studies
find that a fair amount of misinformation gets slung around online, so your
safest bet is to stick with a moderated group. A number of reputable eating
disorder Web sites are beginning to host professionally-moderated groups.
Psychoeducational groups
Imagine a class (with no exams or homework!) called “Everything You Need
to Know About Your Child’s Eating Disorder and How to Handle It.” Would
you take such a class? If so, a psychoeducational group may be for you.
Psychoeducational groups are usually run as a series of lectures. Topics in
the series may include nutrition, medication, psychological issues, family
relations, and so on. You have a chance to ask questions. Most psychoeduca-
tional groups aim at helping you cope better with having someone with an
eating disorder in the family.
Finding what you need
Okay, you’ve figured out what kind of help you need. Now where do you find
it? Your most likely sources are word-of-mouth, local institutions, and the
Internet.
Asking locally
The best way to find resources right in your own community is to ask other
professionals or consumers who live or work there. This way you also get a
recommendation. For example:
 For an individual or couples therapist or parent counselor: Ask any
member of your child’s professional team. Ask school counselors. Try
your family doctor. Ask friends, neighbors, or parents of your child’s
friends.
 For support groups or psychoeducational groups: Call local universities,
hospitals, and clinics that have eating disorder programs.
Looking it up
A boatload of resource information is available on the Internet. A number of
reputable eating disorder sites maintain lists of therapists throughout the
country who specialize in eating disorders. Some of the same sites list for-fee

and free support groups for families. If you dig through them, you also find
listings of online groups, message boards, and the like.
A good place to start your search is the “Resource Guide” at the end of this
book. There you find the major Web sites listing the professional and support
resources you’re looking for.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
n the best For Dummies tradition, I end with “The Part
of Tens.” My “Part of Tens” is dedicated to your recov-
ery. Check in here as often as you like to keep yourself on
track or draw a little inspiration.
First I give you ten “don’ts” — a list of behaviors and
thought habits guaranteed to keep an eating disorder
going or to interfere with getting better. Next I offer up a
list of ten “do’s.” The do’s are thoughts and practices to
help your recovery process keep moving along success-
fully. Finally, I provide a list of benefits you can expect
from sticking with it in recovery, advantages you may 
not have thought of, but will probably be happy to know.

Chapter 25
Ten Don’ts: Behaviors 
and Thoughts to Avoid
P
eople with eating disorders typically have certain behaviors and ways of
looking at things that keep the disorder going and interfere with recov-
ery. This chapter gives you a quick rundown of some of the most important
behaviors and ways of thinking to avoid.
Don’t Diet
Dieting is part of your eating disorder. You can’t even diet a little without risk-
ing relapse. Not for your cousin’s wedding. Not to fit into your bathing suit.
Not to take off a few pounds you gained on vacation. Not to “jump start”
weight loss before you start eating sensibly. If you have binge eating disorder
(BED) or bulimia, you’re too likely to end up bingeing. If you have anorexia,
you’re too likely to just keep going.
Besides increasing the risk of relapse, dieting distracts you from focusing on
recovery behaviors. You can’t really do both. Furthermore, dieting reinforces
any ideas you have about your weight coming before your health or well-being.
Don’t Try to Fix Your Eating 
Disorder by Yourself
You already believe you’re the only one you can rely on. Or that putting your-
self in others’ hands means giving up self-control. Those ideas helped create
your eating disorder. You’ll be tempted to apply them again when it comes to
getting better. Fight the temptation!
Although a percentage of people whose eating disorders aren’t severe can
work successfully with self-help programs (books or online), even they are
using expert guidance. Eating disorders are the kinds of problems for which
you need expert guidance! If you have other complications, such as drug or

alcohol abuse, bipolar disorder, a trauma history, or medical dangers from
starving, in-person expert intervention is a must. Most people find they also
need the human touch that comes along with it — support, compassion, and
feeling understood — to help them get better.
Professional helpers can be a source of more than expert guidance. They can
be a starting point for discovering a world of people who are reliable and sup-
port your independence. Developing the ability to trust in others is an impor-
tant part of your recovery.
Don’t Look for a Quick Fix
Many people come to treatment hoping that in a few weeks, or a few months
at most, their eating disorder will be history. A number of these people leave
in disappointment when they find out this is mostly fantasy. They often go
from treatment to treatment, hoping to find the one that will make recovery
quick and painless.
Often the people who spend their time searching for quick-fix treatment
believe they aren’t able to tolerate the awareness and discomfort that go 
with longer-term recovery work. This same kind of self-doubt led to your
eating disorder behavior in the first place. If these kinds of doubts apply to
you when you think of eating disorder treatment, remember: You don’t start
with the heaviest lifting in therapy any more than you do at the gym. Part of
getting stronger is pacing yourself according to what you can handle at the
time. Good treatment includes careful collaboration with your therapist
about the pace of treatment.
Don’t Do Anything that Feels Extreme
Although the behaviors and beliefs associated with your eating disorder
probably feel normal to you, they actually represent extremes. You’re either
bingeing or starving. You’re exactly the right weight or you’re totally gross.
Your feelings are completely under wraps or you’re overwhelmed and out of
control.
You’re drawn to dramatic remedies because they match the way you think
and live. What you need now is less drama and more practice with being in
the middle. In that middle territory, things don’t happen in the blink of an
eye, and you’re called upon to tolerate a lot of imperfections. Being in the
middle involves doing things a little bit at a time instead of avoiding them
altogether or jumping in and drowning. Avoiding extremes and finding the
middle is the opposite of your eating disorder. It’s one more way you can 
help your recovery.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Believe Your Weight 
Determines Your Worth
Believing that your weight determines your worth is central to eating disor-
dered thinking. Many people think they’re going to find out what they’re
worth when they get on the scales each day. (One more reason to throw out
those scales!)
One of the most important things you do in recovery is begin to value your-
self in other ways besides your weight. While you’re working toward that
goal, you may find it useful to stop and think of people you know and love or
admire. Does their worth in your eyes depend on their weight? Can you imag-
ine, just for a minute, applying the same standards to yourself?
Don’t Avoid Your Negative Feelings
One of the biggest jobs your eating disorder has is to protect you from feel-
ings you think you can’t manage. The more you discover you can actually
face your feelings without being overwhelmed, the less you need your 
eating disorder to rescue you from them. Of course, this can be a tall order.
Discovering how to manage difficult emotions will probably be a big focus of
your recovery work — and well worth it. In the meantime, you may want to
practice just stretching yourself a little more than you’re used to. Can you
stay with that feeling just one minute longer?
Don’t Ignore Signs of Relapse
Responding to signs of relapse requires a bit of a Goldilocks touch. You don’t
want to over-respond, as if a slip is a catastrophe and ruins everything. But,
on the other hand, you need to make sure you’re not under-responding, or
maybe even using a little denial by telling yourself something like “This doesn’t
mean anything. I can fast (binge) (purge) just for now and it won’t hurt any-
thing. I’ll get right back on track after the weekend.”
Your best bet is to acknowledge a slip right away as an early warning sign.
Talk with your professional helpers or support group members. Get a handle
on what happened. The slip was an attempt to fix something that upset or
threatened you. In recovery, you can find fixes that don’t involve your eating
disorder.
337
Chapter 25: Ten Don’ts: Behaviors and Thoughts to Avoid

Don’t Nurture Your Fascination with “Thin”
“Thin” has become an obsession for you. It’s part of your eating disorder. In
recovery, you need to make sure you’re not fueling your thin obsession fur-
ther. With that in mind, you want to avoid
 Poring over fashion magazines
 Putting photos of your favorite model or skinny celebrity on the fridge
 Talking calories with your friends or family
 Asking others if you look fat
 Spending endless time in front of the mirror rating body parts for fat
Don’t Put Things Off Until 
You’re “Thin Enough”
Many people have a list of things they’re only allowed to do when they’re
“thin enough”: go to the beach, wear shorts, eat at a party, have sex, go to a
gym, date, go to a restaurant, or eat ice cream in public. Whatever is on your
list, every time you deprive yourself, you reinforce the idea that pleasures in
life have to be earned by being “thin.” Even worse, this thinking reinforces
the belief that you’re only worthy when you’re thin.
As an exercise to combat this eating disordered thinking, I invite you to list
all your “thin only” activities and begin challenging yourself to include them
in your life now. You’re allowed to use whatever kind of support you see fit.
Don’t Stop Treatment Too Soon
You may be very tempted to stop treatment once you’ve gained enough
weight to get out of the hospital or you’ve finished that cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) program and aren’t bingeing and purging so much. You want
to put it all behind you. Unfortunately, this is a lot like surviving Hurricane
Katrina and ignoring the need to rebuild the levees. For most people, it’s a
recipe for relapse.
Recovery work involves building strong skills and thinking processes that
can help you weather any storm. The more you accomplish in recovery, the
less likely you are to turn to eating disorder behaviors in distress.

Chapter 26
Ten Do’s: Ways to Enhance 
Your Recovery
O
nce you decide you want to get better, you have a lot on your plate. You
not only want to get a handle on your acute eating disorder symptoms —
dieting, starving, bingeing, and/or purging — but you also need to get started
with a recovery process. Recovery includes building the skills and ways of
thinking that help buffer you from relapse.
In this chapter I give you a list of practices that can help you make your way
through the recovery process. They include activities for building recovery
skills and habitual ways of thinking you can cultivate. Touch base with this
list from time to time, just to help keep yourself on track.
Do Practice Being Imperfect
One of the hardest things you need to do in recovery is make peace with being
an imperfect human being — one who, like everyone else, makes mistakes,
has flaws in her body and personality, and can’t do everything perfectly
every time. Your job in recovery is to lay down that impossible burden of
holding yourself to perfection. Instead you need to work on finding approaches
that help you accept the times you don’t get it right or the things about your-
self you don’t like but can’t change. You can put a positive spin on your mis-
takes or flaws by thinking of them as opportunities to practice being imperfect!
Do Nurture Your Social Network 
as Part of Your Healing
An eating disorder is often a vote of no-confidence in other people. Discovering
how to connect to others in healthy ways is part of your “medicine.” This
includes

 Discovering you can distinguish reliable from unreliable people, or
people who are accepting from people who are judgmental
 Choosing to place your trust only in reliable, accepting people
 Committing to showing up rather than withdrawing or “flaking”
 Taking risks with letting yourself be known
 Reaching out for support
The more you develop your ability to get emotional and spiritual nurturance
from other people, the less you need to turn to food and dieting to try to fill
the void.
Do Speak Up!
Eating disorder behaviors are well-known ways of “swallowing” or “stuffing”
your feelings. In order to get better, you need to stop doing that and start
speaking up! (Of course, this takes time, practice, and support.) Finding ways
to speak up about what you feel, what you think, or what you need gives you
another recovery asset as a side effect. You can’t help but develop the view,
or at least the suspicion, that what you feel, think, and need actually matters.
And that is a valuable contribution to your self-esteem.
Do Be Truthful with Your Treatment Team
You’re used to keeping things to yourself — partly out of a desire for control,
and partly out of shame. You may feel that nobody ever listens to you or
takes you seriously. Ending the secrecy and coverup of your eating disorder
is a very big turnaround, but it’s necessary for your recovery. And it may just
be a big relief. When you’re not busy covering up, you’re not waiting to get
found out. And you’re not carrying everything alone.
Do Experiment with Ways to 
Enjoy Being in Your Body
You’ve made your body the enemy for too long. That’s part of your eating dis-
order story. Part of your recovery story needs to include finding things your
body can help you do that give you enjoyment or a sense of peace. This is, 
of course, a very individual matter. It requires some exploration. But imagine
how different it will be to ask your body what feels most enjoyable instead of
what burns the most calories!
340
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If you’re recovering from anorexia, keep in mind that you need to coordinate
your activity level with your treatment team. Engaging in too much activity
may be counterproductive to the higher-priority goal of regaining and stabi-
lizing your weight.
Do Use “Feeling Fat” as 
a Call to Awareness
You may think of “feeling fat” as one of your biggest problems, but you can
turn it into one of your best friends. “Feeling fat,” after all, is where your
eating disorder takes you when other unpleasant feelings are lurking, feelings
you aren’t so sure you know how to handle. In recovery, you commit to being
aware of difficult feelings, and you discover how to cope with them. So when
“fat” feelings pop up, you can use them as a signal that something’s up you
need to be aware of. You now know that even more challenging feelings are
hiding behind them. Knowing this, you have the opportunity to stop and
think about what they may be and how you want to handle them.
Do Appreciate that Improvement 
Often Proceeds in Baby Steps
Once you commit to getting better, you want it all done yesterday! Yet recov-
ery often involves changing some very fundamental things about yourself,
including how you manage your emotions, how you view yourself, and how
you relate to other people. Nobody ever changes such basic patterns over-
night. What’s more, many of the changes you need to make may feel scary or
overwhelming at first. Even a tiny step can feel humongous.
Try to appreciate the significance of those first tiny steps. They change your
direction, no matter how small they are. They show that you understand and
respect the limits of what you can do at a particular moment. And they often
signal the way to bigger steps down the line as your experience and confi-
dence grow.
Do Keep Track of Your Accomplishments
If you only focus on what you still have to accomplish, you get too discour-
aged. Find ways to remind yourself of what you’ve already achieved. It’s okay
to let others help you with this!
341
Chapter 26: Ten Do’s: Ways to Enhance Your Recovery

Do Talk with Other Women about 
Social Pressures to Be Thin
Dangerous and destructive cultural messages can be so commonplace that
you fail to notice them or the effect they have on you. Instead, you may tend
to internalize the message and think it defines how things are supposed to
be. This is what happens to most women (and some men) when it comes 
to messages that say you have to be thin to be accepted and loved. Counteract-
ing these messages is an uphill battle. Thin keeps getting rewarded and over-
weight keeps getting ridiculed or excluded.
If you want change, at least in your own life, you need to speak up and dis-
agree. You need to talk to others about the tyranny of thin and protest, even
when you can’t totally free yourself from the effects! In the 1960s and ‘70s,
this was called consciousness raising. When you’re aware, you’re conscious.
You have the possibility of making better choices. You can’t single-handedly
change the culture, but you can at least help and encourage others to think in
healthier ways about their bodies.
Do Remember that People Can and Do
Recover from their Eating Disorders
Recovery from an eating disorder can be a lengthy, frustrating process — one
in which you often can’t see the end or believe that getting better is a possi-
bility for you. Doubt and discouragement are normal feelings during recovery.
Frequently they show up when you’re on the verge of the next big change.
The majority of people who hang in there through recovery get better. By
“better,” I mean they leave their eating disorders essentially in the past and
go on to focus on other things in life — only now with increased strength and
confidence.
