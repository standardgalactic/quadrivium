Series Preface
Materials chemistry has grown hugely in the past few decades and continues
to evolve rapidly. This is especially the case since the subject now finds itself
central to many of the major challenges that face global society, such as
those concerning energy and the environment; but applications of materials
are also found in many everyday situations, with ongoing developments in
technology around electronics and the miniaturisation of devices. Although
the study of materials is a highly interdisciplinary topic, the role of in-
novative, fundamental chemistry continues to lie at the heart of the dis-
covery of new materials, the understanding of their atomic-scale structure
and the relationship of structure to a useful property.
With the Inorganic Materials Series, our aim is to provide a series of
themed volumes, each reflecting the diversity of the topic as it continues to
develop over the coming years, with many chosen to relate closely to emer-
ging practical applications. The use of the title Inorganic Materials is by no
means limiting, but instead emphasises the study of the chemistry of all
elements in the Periodic Table and how they impact the development of new
materials. The chapters in each book will have a pedagogical flavour with a
target audience from first-year postgraduate student upwards, but with wide
subject coverage ranging from continuous inorganic solids, to molecular
and soft matter systems. We will use expert, active researchers as editors and
contributors to provide an up-to-date perspective of their field. At the same
time our aim is to provide an international perspective, so to reflect the
diversity and interdisciplinarity of the now very broad area of the subject.

1.1
Background
Over many centuries the scientific community has developed manifold
strategies to protect and prolong the quality of human life. Nevertheless,
there remain many unresolved healthcare challenges facing mankind.
Cardiovascular diseases, chronic respiratory diseases, viral and bacterial
infections, cancer, and diabetes are responsible for many deaths each year.1
Cancer caused 9.6 million deaths worldwide in 2018,2 and malaria claimed
409 000 deaths in the year 2019.3 Pandemics such as COVID-19 still cause
immense damage to human health and wellbeing. At the time of writing,
more than 2.5 million people have lost their lives to COVID-19, and many
more have lost their livelihoods as COVID has devastated economies around
the world. The eﬀects of disease are not confined to adults and the elderly,
but also aﬀect children. For example, more than one third of all deaths in
low-income countries are among children younger than 15 years. These
deaths are due primarily to respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases,
malaria, AIDS, and birth complications.
There are a range of types of intervention which can be used to reduce the
burden of disease. One is vaccination, in which the body’s immune system is
‘trained’ to recognise and respond to a pathogenic species before an

infection (so-called prophylaxis). If a patient is already suﬀering from a
disease (infectious or otherwise), then therapy is required to ameliorate
their symptoms and control and/or halt the progression of disease. For the
latter, we administer a drug, an entity capable of triggering a pharmaco-
logical response in the body. Although this is conceptually simple, de-
livering the correct dose to the aﬀected part of the body at the right time is
hugely challenging. The manufacture of eﬀective medicines is thus still an
area attracting significant global research interest. Our ability to eﬀectively
treat disease is greatly enhanced by diagnostic and imaging technologies,
which allow physicians to determine exactly what is wrong with the
patient. Ideally diagnosis would be conducted in a non-invasive manner,
but this is not always possible at present. Increasingly, researchers are
exploring so-called theranostics, formulations which combine a diagnostic
or imaging agent and a drug. These can enable the progression of a
patient’s disease to be followed at the same time as it is treated, helping
to optimise the dosage regimen and ensure eﬀective outcomes without
adverse side eﬀects.
Around one third to one half of the world had essential health services
coverage in 2017. However, health services are often lacking in low- and
middle-income countries.4 This encourages the development of low cost and
long shelf-life interventions which can be provided in low-resource en-
vironments. There is also a great need to develop materials that are able to
deliver a therapeutic payload in a precisely targeted fashion, to avoid oﬀ-
target side eﬀects. Inorganic materials have the potential to help overcome
both these issues. However, developing biocompatible and biodegradable
inorganic materials is a challenge which remains to be addressed in many
cases. The introduction of a foreign object into the human body could lead
to unpredictable side eﬀects and/or toxicity. In addition, the immune system
may be hostile towards unfamiliar materials and could initiate a defence
mechanism leading to side eﬀects or the rejection of the construct. Alter-
natively, long-term exposure to a drug might result in resistance and a lack
of therapeutic eﬃcacy. The key requirements and challenges of a therapeutic
intervention are presented in Figure 1.1.
Inorganic materials provide a diversity of tools to engineer solutions to
current challenges in biomedicine. While biocompatibility can be a prob-
lem, inorganic materials are widespread in nature and many are endogenous
to the human body: for instance, calcium-based materials are found in
bones and teeth. This oﬀers a wealth of opportunities to develop multi-
functional and safe therapeutic interventions. Inorganic materials have been
proven to have potential for therapeutics, diagnostics, and drug delivery. For
example, inorganic nanoparticles are key to signal generation in techniques
like magnetic resonance imaging5 and positron emission tomography.6
Therapeutic strategies using, for example, gold- or iron-based materials
have been successfully explored as advanced formulations to treat cancer.7
Inorganic drug delivery systems have also been established to target
pathological tissues, for tissue restoration, wound healing, and vaccination.

Chapter 1

Underpinning all of these innovations are some key families of inorganic
materials, and we introduce these briefly in the following sections.
1.2
Noble Metals
A number of noble metals have been explored in biomedicine, mainly as
pure metal nanoparticles. Gold-based materials, especially colloidal gold
nanoparticles, are simple to prepare, and have easily manipulated surface
chemistry and high stability. These, together with their surface plasmon
resonance properties and biocompatibility, have led to a wide range of po-
tential applications.8,9 Gold nanoparticles show varied properties depending
on their morphology and size, and can be fabricated with a range of shapes
including spheres,10 rods,11 and star-shaped particles (Figure 1.2).12 They
have been studied as diagnostic tools,13 vaccine delivery systems,14 drug
carriers,15 theranostic systems,16 and photothermal therapeutics.17
Silver nanoparticles have been similarly widely explored, and are par-
ticularly known for their antibacterial properties. This means they can be
used, for instance, to solve problems of infections with scaﬀolds and im-
plants.18,19 Silver-based biomaterials have also shown promise in wound
healing and reducing inflammation and scars.20
1.3
Ferromagnetic Metals
Nanosized particles of magnetic elements, such as iron, nickel, cobalt, and
their oxides, show superparamagnetism and high magnetic flux density,
which endows them with applications in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), targeted drug delivery, and theranostics.21,22 Other applications in-
clude bone repair23 and phototherapy.24

development of therapeutic interventions.

1.4
Quantum Dots
Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor nanomaterials that can absorb
broad-spectrum light and emit signals of a specific wavelength (Figure 1.2).25
They are hence potentially potent materials for biomedicine, but their
applications in this regard have faced obstacles due to high toxicity,
low stability, and diﬃculty in surface modification.26 However, recent de-
velopments have begun to overcome these limitations and QDs have thus
been proposed to have potential for both imaging and theranostics.27–30
1.5
Carbon Materials
Carbon-based materials have attracted attention in the biomedical field by dint
of their durability, high rate of biological distribution, and electrical and op-
tical properties.31 Materials explored include graphene, graphene oxide, car-
bon nanotubes, fullerenes, and others (Figure 1.2).32 Graphene is a hydrophilic
2D single carbon layer derived from graphite.33 Through oxidation, graphene
oxide can be generated.34 Graphene and graphene oxide have been explored in
drug delivery,35,36 biosensing and gene delivery,37 and cancer therapy.38
Carbon nanotubes are hollow structures comprising carbon atoms in the
form of a single-walled tube or multiple-walled cylinders. Their structure
allows thermal and electrical conductivity as well as giving high mechanical
strength.39,40 Carbon nanotubes show high surface area, allow facile surface
functionalisation, and have high stability. All of these characteristics render
them potentially useful as drug delivery systems41,42 and biosensors.43,44
They also have osteogenic activity, allowing their application in bone im-
plants.45 However, it should be noted that toxicity is a matter of concern,
especially for graphene and its oxide.46,47
1.6
Layered Double Hydroxides
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) represents a class of layered materials held
together by electrostatic attractions. They have the general formula [M1x
21
M0x
31(OH)2]x1Ax/n
nzH2O, where M denotes divalent cations (e.g. Mg21, Co21,
Mn21), M0 trivalent metal ions (e.g. Fe31, Al31), and An charge-balancing an-
ions such as NO3
, Cl, and CO3
2 (Figure 1.2).48,49 LDHs’ –OH groups provide
a pH-responsive system that can degrade in an acidic medium to release a drug
cargo. The positive charge of the LDH surface enhances the particles’ inter-
action with biological membranes, and hence facilitates intracellular deliv-
ery.50,51 LDHs have been explored in various biomedical applications,
including cancer therapy, gene delivery, diagnosis, implants, and scaﬀolds.49

(M ¼ Ti, Zr, Hf, etc.) are coordinated by chalcogen elements (X ¼ S, Se, or
Te) to form two-dimensional layered materials (Figure 1.2).52,53 A wide
range of TMDC formulations can be obtained through variation of the
composition.53 TMDCs show several promising properties, including a
generally high surface area-to-volume ratio, particularly when the particles
are nanosized. This allows a high drug loading to be achieved. In addition,
the optical properties of TMDCs facilitate their application in photo-
responsive therapy and optical biosensors.54 They can be used to convert
near-infrared light to heat, and thus for photothermal treatments and
photoacoustic imaging.55,56 TMDCs constructed from elements of high
atomic number can be used as a contrast agent for computed tomo-
graphy.57 They have hence attracted significant attention for gene and drug
delivery, bioimaging, and other applications in biomedicine.56–59 However,
the in vivo safety of TMDCs is still a matter of concern, and to date only
MoS2, WS2, and WSe2 have been tested in vitro and in vivo for their tox-
icological eﬀects.60–62
1.8
Silica-based Biomaterials
Silica (Si–O–Si) framework materials can be readily formed via condensation
reactions, and a range of templates can be used to generate systems with a
variety of particle shapes, sizes and porosities (see Figure 1.2).63–65 The high
surface area of silica-based materials, their easily tuneable pore size, bio-
compatibility, high stability and dispersibility, osteostimulative properties,
and easily functionalised surfaces facilitate a wide range of biomedical ap-
plications.66,67 For instance, they have been used as drug delivery systems,68
gene delivery systems,69 scaﬀolds for bone tissue engineering,67 multi-
functional theranostics70 and formulations able to respond to changes in
pH71 or temperature,72 to ultrasound,73 or other stimuli.74
1.9
Metal–Organic Frameworks
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are composed of metal centres connected
by organic bridging ligands (Figure 1.2). This renders them a hugely versatile
family of materials. An enormously diverse range of ligands and metals can
be used to construct the framework, resulting in tuneable porosity and the
potential for surface optimisation and functionalisation.75 MOFs can be
loaded with a drug cargo, and particles prepared with tuneable size, bio-
compatibility, and biodegradability.76 MOFs have thus been explored in
cancer therapy77 and multimodal bioimaging,78 inter alia.

Scope

organic materials in biomedicine. Chapter 2 will discuss inorganic material
based drug delivery systems, while Chapter 3 is focused on imaging.

Introduction
The field of drug delivery involves the use of secondary agents to improve the
transport, bioavailability, stability, and targeting of therapeutic agents. One
approach to achieve this has been the use of nanoparticles or macro-scale
formulations that can encapsulate active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)
or imaging agents.1 These systems, known as drug delivery systems (DDSs),
can enhance the properties of the API in a number of ways: (i) poorly soluble
drugs can be endowed with enhanced biodistribution, (ii) enzymatically
unstable molecules, such as peptides and oligonucleotides, can be shielded,
(iii) high cargo loadings can result in higher local concentrations of payloads
delivered to a specific locus, (iv) improved uptake at disease sites is
achievable if the DDS is more eﬃciently taken up by cells than the cargo, for
example by the proposed enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) eﬀect
in tumours,2 and (v) the DDSs can be further functionalised to target specific

receptors at sites of disease and so minimise oﬀ-target eﬀects.3 These highly
desirable properties have led to a wealth of research into DDSs, including
translation of a number of examples into clinical use. The first nanoscale
DDS to be widely clinically applied is Doxil, a liposomal formulation of the
chemotherapeutic doxorubicin, used against a broad spectrum of cancers.4
More recently, nanoparticle delivery of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)
sequences has allowed development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,
potentially ushering in a new era of mRNA vaccines.5
Nanoparticle-based DDSs can be broadly divided into two classifications:
organic and inorganic. Organic systems, such as liposomes and polymer-
somes, are typically ‘soft’ systems that oﬀer excellent biocompatibility and
clearance, but often lower cargo loading. Inorganic systems, the focus of this
chapter, are ‘hard’ systems, such as noble metal nanoparticles or porous in-
organic solids, which can oﬀer exceptionally high cargo loadings but often
require additional functionalisation to ensure stability and dispersion, and
have a tendency to accumulate in the body. As such, there are considerably
more organic DDSs that have received approval from the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) of the United States of America than inorganic systems,3
but significant research eﬀorts are ongoing into amalgamating the desirable
properties of both organic and inorganic DDSs into single, hybrid, systems.
In this chapter, we focus broadly on inorganic DDSs. These have been
further divided into four categories: metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),
mesoporous silicas, layered inorganic systems, and noble metal nano-
particles. Each of these classes of material will be described in turn, with
focus on synthetic methodologies, specific functionalisation protocols, bio-
compatibility, drug delivery itself, and incorporation of additional features,
such as targeting. As this chapter is intended as an introductory guide to the
field, selected representative examples will be used to illustrate particular
focal points or features of specific inorganic DDSs, and where possible the
reader will be directed to comprehensive review articles for more in-depth
overviews of the diﬀerent materials.
2.2
Metal–Organic Frameworks
2.2.1
Introduction
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous coordination polymers (PCPs)
with a crystalline hybrid structure, consisting of metal ions or metal clusters
[also known as secondary building units (SBUs)] joined by multidentate
organic ligands via coordination bonding into infinite network structures.6
SBUs can be a metal atom, a finite polyatomic inorganic cluster (consisting
of two or more metal atoms), or an infinite inorganic unit (e.g. an infinite
periodic rod of metal atoms). The permanently porous structure is a result of
the repeated nature of the bonding between the inorganic clusters and the
organic ligands, which oﬀers high compositional and structural diversity as
well as ease of functionalisation (Figure 2.1).7–10
Inorganic Materials in Drug Delivery

The infinite combinations of metal centres and organic linkers have made
MOFs very popular to explore and a great variety of frameworks have been
reported in recent decades, such as the Isoreticular MOF (IRMOF), Zeolitic
Imidazolate Framework (ZIF), Materials of Institut Lavoisier (MIL), and
Universitetet i Oslo (UiO) series.11,12 In particular, MIL- and UiO-type
frameworks are platform MOFs which are used to synthesise a variety of
isoreticular (extended framework) derivatives.13–15 One of the most prom-
inent features of MOFs is their porosity, which allows access to meso- and
micro-scale space within the network solids, enclosing or revealing func-
tionalities.16 The design of frameworks with high porosity that is either
permanent17,18 or available via suitable activation methods19–21 has been a
key aim in MOF research, as the access and preservation of pore space is vital
for many potential applications of the materials.6,22,23
The high surface areas of MOFs, typically between 1000 and 10 000 m2 g1,
gives them a great advantage when compared with other similar materials,
such as zeolites.6,24 Since the popularisation of MOFs in the late 1980s by
Hoskins and Robson,25 over 70 000 structures have been reported in the
Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) as of 2017,26 and they have been
successfully used in many fields, such as clean energy storage (methane
and hydrogen),27 gas capture and separation (CO2),28–30 catalysis,12 thin
film devices,31,32 biomedical imaging,33,34 light harvesting,35,36 optical
luminescence,37,38 and drug delivery.39–41

General Synthesis Methods
MOFs are usually synthesised using direct synthetic procedures such as
solvothermal,42,43 microwave assisted,44,45 hydrothermal,46,47 and mechan-
ochemical routes.48,49 The reason for this variety is that the synthesis
method can determine the structure and/or physical properties of the
product by having direct influence on the reaction times, yields, particle size,
and morphology of the framework.50 Secondary steps are commonly seen in

most MOF syntheses: solvent exchange via washing is done to remove the
less volatile solvent trapped within the pores of the framework and exchange
it for a volatile one. Once this happens, the MOF is dried either by vacuum or
heat, thus removing the volatile solvent.
Solvothermal synthesis in the conventional sense involves a metal source
and a multitopic organic linker or linkers, heated up in a formamide solvent.
There are a variety of solvents used but N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is
usually preferred due to its high polarity, which helps the starting materials
to dissolve completely and homogeneously.51 Another advantage is the high
boiling point (153 1C) that opens opportunities to carry out synthesis at in-
creased temperatures. At such high temperatures, DMF thermally de-
composes to form carbon monoxide and dimethylamine, a base which can
induce the deprotonation of organic linkers and lead to strong bonding with
the metal clusters.
The solvent is not the only factor that needs to be considered; several other
parameters, such as the concentration of solutions, reaction time, heating
and/or cooling rate, and pH, can play an important role during synthesis.
These can influence the crystallisation kinetics and the size and crystallinity
of the resulting structures.52 High-valency metals can be problematic to
generate highly crystalline and chemically stable materials from, because of
the kinetic inertness of the metal–ligand bonding. All these factors can have
direct and indirect eﬀects on the properties of the MOF.
2.2.3
Typical Properties
MOFs can maintain their structure and crystallinity even after extended
linkers and diﬀerent functional groups have been introduced. There have
been many developments in the refinement and optimisation of MOF
structures, with the most fundamental progress in the ‘building’ of a MOF
being that the construction is done via connecting SBUs with rigid shapes
(square, octahedral) rather than the simpler method of connecting a single
atom to ditopic coordinating linkers, used in earlier coordination polymers.
This approach helped with the identification of preferred or default topol-
ogies to be targeted in designed synthesis, but most importantly led to the
maintenance of permanent porosity of the framework.53
A big step forward in the exploitation of MOFs was presented by Li et al.
with their report on the synthesis, X-ray single crystal structure, and low-
temperature and pressure gas sorption properties of MOF-5 (Figure 2.2A).54
This cubic framework consists of octahedral Zn4O(CO2)6 metal centres each
connected to six chelating 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid (BDC) units,
[Zn4O(BDC)3], and possesses up to 61% porosity with a Brunauer–Emmett–
Teller (BET) surface area of 2320 m2 g1, substantially higher values than
those reported for zeolites and activated carbons.55
A lot of research has focused on expanding the pore space, and one way
of doing that is by using extended organic linkers. However, the drawback
is that at a certain length of the ligand, interpenetration (two or more

frameworks grow and intertwine together) can occur, though this can be
prevented via the synthesis of MOFs with a topology that inhibits inter-
penetration.56 The exploration of longer organic linkers has led to the design
of MOFs with higher porosities, an example of which is the isoreticular series
of MOFs based on MOF-5 as the parent MOF (termed IRMOFs). This is a
family of 16 cubic frameworks with the same underlying topology, made
with extended and variously functionalised organic linkers.57 This shows
the ability to make a large number of structures with distinct functionalities
but with the same topology, which in this case is the primitive cubic or
pcu net.58,59 The porosity range is quite wide with one of the smallest
isoreticular
structures
being
[Zn4O(FUM)3]
(FUM ¼ fumaric
acid;
pores ¼ 6.86.8 Å),60 and the largest structures including [Zn4O(TPDC)3]
(TPDC ¼ terphenyl-4,400-dicarboxylate; pores ¼ 1616 Å) (see Figure 2.2B).50,61
The pcu structures are linked by linear ditopic linkers; moving to trigonal
tritopic linkers, but maintaining the same tetranuclear Zn SBU, generates
the isoreticular qom topology series that includes MOF-177 (Figure 2.2C),
MOF-180 and MOF-200 (extended linkers shown in Figure 2.2D).48,62 Inter-
esting features of the latter two frameworks are that, unlike the extended pcu
frameworks, these structures are not interpenetrated, despite having 89%
and 90% porosity respectively. This indicates that choice of the topology is
crucial when expanding an isoreticular series.
MOFs typically have high thermal stability, ranging from 250 1C to 500 1C,
due to the strong bonds within the structure.63 Chemical stability is a dif-
ferent challenge altogether, as MOFs are susceptible to linker displacement
if left in a solvent for a number of days. Park et al. were the first to report
the noteworthy chemical stability of the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8
(ZIF-8). This has a composition of [Zn(MeIM)2], where MeIM ¼ 2-methyli-
midazolate.63 The MOF was tested against boiling water, methanol, and
benzene, in which it was immersed for up to seven days, and against 0.1 and
8 M aqueous sodium hydroxide for 24 h, and survived unaltered under all
treatments.
In
addition
to
ZIF-8,
Zr-based
UiO-66,
with
formula
[Zr6O4(OH)4(BDC)6], possess a high chemical stability. For example, the NO2-
and Br-functionalised derivatives have shown high resistance against HCl
(pH ¼ 1) and NaOH (pH ¼ 14), without any damage to the structure.64,65
Typically, high-valency metals generate chemically inert MOFs.66
For application in drug delivery, it is also necessary to determine the col-
loidal stability of MOFs, to understand their behaviour in body fluids. The
reason for this is that it is important for the drug-loaded MOFs to reach
the targeted area, deliver the cargo, and subsequently degrade; in some cases,
the latter processes are co-dependent.67 The stability of MOFs for biomedical
applications is usually tested in water and in simulated body fluids. One of
the first studies performed by Be´tard et al. was on the M-CPO-27 series
(M¼ Ni, Co, Mg, Zn, and Mn), also referred to as MOF-74 or [M2(DOBDC)]
(DOBDC ¼ 2,5-dioxo-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate). These materials showed poor
stability.68 Studies on MIL-100(Fe), [Fe3O(H2O)2OH(BTC)2]nH2O (BTC ¼ 1,3,5-
benzenetricarboxylate),69,70 and UiO-66(Zr)65,71 demonstrated their greater
Inorganic Materials in Drug Delivery
19

stability in water, ascribed to the higher oxidation state of the metals. How-
ever, in phosphate buﬀered saline (PBS) solutions, iron(III) MOFs from the
MIL-family demonstrated poor stability and degraded over time,72,73 which
was similarly observed for UiO-66 (Figure 2.3). Therefore, surface functiona-
lisation, for example by coating with biologically compatible polymers such as
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), is often used to enhance stability.74
In addition to stability, particle size must also be considered for a drug
delivery system. The application of microparticles by Baillie et al. in the late
1980s was a breakthrough towards targeted and personalised drug deliv-
ery.75 MOF particle size is usually controlled via the addition of modu-
lators.10 The modulator is most often a monotopic molecule that has
analogous coordinating functionality to the multitopic linker of the MOF
and is added to solvothermal synthesis, a protocol named coordination
modulation and first used by Hermes et al. in 2007 to control particle size.76
Modulators can control particle size through capping, terminating co-
ordination polymerisation, or by simply modifying reaction kinetics. In
some cases, they are incorporated into the final framework as charge-
compensating defects, either at the surface or throughout the bulk.
Modulation induced defectivity can be applied to generate functionalised
MOFs, such as work done by Aba´nades La´zaro et al. on the multivariate
modulation of UiO-66(Zr), where a number of carboxylate- or phosphonate-
containing
drugs
were
introduced
as
simultaneous
modulators
(Figure 2.4A).77 As the modulators were attached as defects rather than
blocking pores, the resulting multivariate modulated MOFs (MTVM MOFs)
remained porous, allowing subsequent loading of a further drug, generating
a potent drug delivery cocktail. The MTVM MOF synthesis protocols are
versatile and reproducible which makes them applicable to any other MOF

2.2.4
Biocompatibility
The toxicity of MOFs must be evaluated before the materials are used in any
biomedical applications,78 but it is expected that each of the building blocks
in the framework will have its own cytotoxicity profile and so the toxicity of
the metal(s) used to form the MOF may act as a first principles guide for
biocompatibility. The metal ions have a wide range of values for chronic oral
dose, from daily doses of 1 mg kg1 for cadmium to over 1 g kg1 for cal-
cium.79 Such toxicity parameters are usually calculated for metal oxides or
simple salts, which does not necessarily give an accurate picture for MOFs,
since the frameworks will have diﬀerent degradation profiles.80 For this
reason, the most important consideration is the overall toxicity of the par-
ticles, which needs to be thoroughly assessed after each synthesis.
Tamames-Tabar et al. reported a study on 14 MOFs with diﬀerent com-
positions (systems linked by Fe, Zn, and Zr) and their compatibility towards
two diﬀerent cell lines, human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) and a murine
macrophage cell line (J774) (Figure 2.5).81 Compared with other com-
mercialised nanoparticulate systems, the MOFs exhibit relatively low cyto-
toxicity. However, higher values were observed in J774 than HeLa cells,
which can be attributed to the diﬀerent compositions and internalisation
capacity of the cell lines. From the results, it can be concluded that the
biocompatibility of the materials depends on the metal centre, as the
Fe-based MOFs exhibited lower cytotoxicity compared with Zr- or Zn-based
MOFs, as well as the hydrophobic–hydrophilic balance (which is directly
influenced by the organic linker).
An extensive study on the biocompatibility of MOFs was carried out by
Ruyra et al. on 16 diﬀerent uncoated nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs; Figure 2.6),
assessed for cytotoxicity on liver (HepG2) and breast cancer (MCF-7) cell
lines in vitro, and for toxicity to zebrafish embryos in vivo.82 There was a
strong correlation between the in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo toxicity results,
with the least toxic framework in both being Mg-MOF-74, also known as
CPO-27(Mg). However, MIL-101(Fe) did not follow the trend, showing higher
toxicity for the embryos than the cell lines. Many factors were considered to
have an influence on the tolerance of the MOFs by both cells and embryos,
such as the size, shape and charge of the frameworks, as well as the diﬀerent
degradation profiles and nature of the degradation products. Nevertheless,
the leakage of metal ions appeared to be dominant in the toxicity of
the NMOFs.
MOFs used for drug delivery are usually around 200 nm in size. However,
Arcuri et al. have published work on the internalisation and biocompatibility
of ultrasmall (approximately 25 nm) Zr-based UiO-66 nanoparticles in U251
glioblastoma cancer cells (Figure 2.7).83 The NMOF was loaded with a
fluorescent probe, acridine orange, and the UiO-66 particles were found not

to change the cell cycle, viability, migration properties, and expression of
kinase occurring during cell growth.
The results of these studies reveal there are many MOF candidates for
biomedical applications which have been tested on various cell lines in vitro.
However, these examinations do not give a full picture of the eﬀects of
MOFs. There are relatively few studies of a range of MOFs under identical
conditions to allow comparison, and in vivo studies need to be performed to
better understand their behaviour.
2.2.5
In Vivo Toxicity
Animal models are needed to investigate whole body toxicity and the ad-
sorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of the materials.84
Horcajada et al. published an in-depth in vivo study of the acute toxicity of
three porous iron-based NMOFs in rats, as well as their distribution, me-
tabolism, and excretion.78 The MOFs chosen are diverse in structure,
composition, and hydrophobicity: MIL-88A, a Fe(III) fumarate system with
an endogenous hydrophilic linker; MIL-88B_4CH3 with exogenous aro-
matic and hydrophobic linkers; and MIL-100, a rigid mesoporous Fe(III)
trimesate with an exogenous aromatic and hydrophilic linker. The first two
frameworks are flexible microporous solids (Figure 2.8A). The materials

were intravenously injected into adult female Wistar rats and acute toxicity
was studied in terms of animal behaviour, water and food consumption,
alterations in the body, organ weight, serum parameters (e.g. iron levels,
inflammation), oxidative stress and metabolism, and microscopic and
macroscopic histological observations. All three NMOFs mainly accumu-
lated in the reticuloendothelial system (RES), including the liver and
spleen. Both organs retained their functions, with the exception of some
transient anomalies, showing no signs of constant or persistent toxicity
after intravenous administration. An unexpected result was the detection
of the smallest and most hydrophobic MIL-88B_4CH3 in the brain, which
indicates it can bypass the blood–brain barrier (BBB), but no severe cere-
bral toxicity was observed (Figure 2.8B). The breakdown of the MOFs oc-
curred via degradation to their building blocks: iron and the organic
linker. The polycarboxylate linkers were directly removed in the urine and
faeces, excluding further biotransformation. The excretion of the en-
dogenous fumaric acid was not observed, indicating reuse of the molecules
in the Krebs cycle. A reversible, transient, overload of iron was observed in
the liver and spleen, leading to an increase in the metal content of the
organs. However, iron was subsequently mobilised and removed in the
urine and faeces, without negatively aﬀecting iron homeostasis or hepatic
function.
In vivo data for bare MOFs are more often presented as part of wider drug
delivery studies. For example, Kundu et al. reported a gadolinium-based
MOF for anticancer drug delivery.85 Nanoparticles (approximately 90 nm) of
Gd-pDBI [pDBI is the fluorescent 1,4-bis(5-carboxy-1H-benzemidazole-2-yl)-
benzene ligand] were prepared and found to have a three-dimensional
interpenetrated
structure
with
one-dimensional
open
channels
(1.91.2 nm), filled with hydrogen-bonded water assemblies (Figure 2.9A).
The particles were loaded with doxorubicin, achieving a loading of 12% by
weight. In vitro and in vivo studies on Gd-pDBI revealed low blood toxicity
and good biocompatibility (Figure 2.9B).
The results of these studies indicate that MOFs are suitable for use in vivo,
which is promising for their future use as DDSs. MOFs have attracted a lot of
attention for their use as DDSs due to their easy synthesis and functionali-
sation,86 and the possibility to load the carrier with one87,88 or more89 drugs,
or even a targeting moiety and a drug.90
2.2.6
Drug Loading and Delivery
A MOF DDS typically consists of a core, the biocompatible framework itself,
which holds the drug and controls its release, as well as a corona, the outer
surface that can be functionalised with targeting moieties. The latter can
allow more precise drug release in the desired area, and tuneable biodis-
tribution inside the body (Figure 2.10A).88 Drug loading routes can be
broadly grouped into three categories: encapsulation (where the drug fits
inside the pores), direct assembly (where the drug is part of the MOF

Encapsulation
As MOFs are permanently porous structures, encapsulation is widely used.
Drugs can be incorporated within the pores both during synthesis and
through subsequent loading. An example is work published by Horcajada
et al. on MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-101(Cr), built from trimers of metal
octahedra and di- or tri-carboxylic acids. These systems have a formula of
[M3OX(H2O)2LnO].nH2O (M ¼ Cr, X ¼ F, OH; L ¼ 1,3,5-benzene tricarboxylic
acid (BTC) and n ¼ 2 for MIL-100; L ¼ 1,4-BDC and n ¼ 3 for MIL-101.)

The group loaded the MOFs with ibuprofen by soaking the dry powder in a

pirin and ibuprofen (Figure 2.11A).87 Combined experimental and com-
putational approaches were used to investigate the main driving forces
behind the drug adsorption and desorption kinetics. The drug uptake and
release profiles indicate that the drug loading and delivery processes are
mainly dictated by structural parameters, such as the accessibility of the
framework and drug volume, and the hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of
both the MOF and drug. For example, hydrophilic UiO-66 exhibits a fast
release of hydrophilic aspirin, contrasting with slow release of hydrophobic
ibuprofen. Structural diﬀerences lead to fast delivery from the open
framework of MIL-100(Fe) and slow drug release from MIL-127(Fe), which
has a narrow 1D pore (Figure 2.11B).
UiO-66 has been tested for the encapsulation of alendronate (AL), a drug
known to have antitumour eﬀects, notably in the cases of prostate and breast
cancers.92,93 However, there are drawbacks to using the drug on its own,
including a short circulation lifetime and accumulation in bone (indeed, AL
is widely used to treat osteoporosis).94,95 It is known that zirconia can bind
strongly to phosphates via the Zr–O–P bonding motif.96 The biocompatibility
and ease of nanoparticle formation therefore make UiO-66, which has a
zirconium oxide based SBU, an ideal carrier for AL.88 Since UiO-66 is
pH-sensitive, AL release is accelerated in the acidic environment of tumour
microenvironment, resulting in enhanced eﬃcacy of treatment.97
2.2.6.2
Direct Assembly
A drug can be used as a linker or take part of the formation of the
framework via coordination bonds between the cargo and metal centres.
Certain drugs, such as zoledronate (Zol),98 methotrexate (MTX),99 and a
number of platinum-based anticancer prodrugs,100 have been successfully
incorporated into the structures of MOFs by such direct assembly. This
method is used as it achieves therapeutic performance via the slow de-
composition of the MOF, which releases the drug. One of the earliest ex-
amples of a platinum-based prodrug used as a linker was in work done by
Rieter et al. on a terbium-based MOF connected by the cisplatin prodrug
cis,cis,trans-(diamminedichlorodisuccinato)Pt(IV), or DSCP (Figure 2.12).101
The content of the prodrug was above 70% by weight and cytotoxicity
studies of the silica-coated Tb-DSCP showed higher eﬃciency than the
cisplatin standard (free cisplatin).

Long et al. synthesised an expanded analogue of MOF-74, using the drug
olsalazine (H4olz) as a linker, as a biocompatible platform for drug delivery
(Figure 2.13A).102 Mg2(olz) showed 86% by weight olsazaline incorporation
to the structure and successfully released the linker and also phenethyla-
mine (PEA), which could be loaded in the pores (Figure 2.13B and C).

Post-synthetic
The post-synthetic modification strategy introduces cargos into the car-
riers via the formation of coordination bonds with the metal centres, or
covalent bonds with functional sites on the linkers. This method can load
drugs or be used to add functionality to protect the particle surface. For

example, Wang et al. reported the surface functionalisation of a series of
UiO-66 MOFs with 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) as a proof
of concept by coordination via phosphates (Figure 2.14).103 This method
led to better colloidal dispersions of crystalline NMOFs in various solvents
and chemical environments. Ligand density can be controlled via the se-
lective coordination of organophosphates to the metal centres, while
crystallinity and porosity is retained. This method can be used to create
a large pool of multifunctional porous structures that can be tuned via
ligand exchange.

2.2.6.4
Multiple Drug Loading
MOFs have a great diversity and many of these materials exhibit a dual
hydrophilic and hydrophobic pore structure alongside a large number of
exposed coordinatively unsaturated metal sites. These properties are ideal
for carrying more than one drug for simultaneous delivery to a target site,
for instance NO and CO104 or small molecule drugs such as busulfan and
cidofovir.72 This is useful because, for instance, the accumulation of large
amounts of nitric oxide in tumours leads to an increase in sensitivity to
chemotherapy and radiotherapy and in some cases can even lead to the
cancer cells’ apoptosis.105–107 Rojas et al. have reported the incorporation
and release of the anticancer drugs [Ru(p-cymene)Cl2(pta)] (RAPTA-C,
pta ¼ 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane) and NO by CPO-27(Ni), showing
that the adsorption capacity of either was not hindered in the presence of
the other (Figure 2.15A).108 Interestingly, NO interacts with the metal
centres (chemisorption), while RAPTA-C is found in the pores (physisorp-
tion), as depicted in Figure 2.15B. The release of the RAPTA-C is not
influenced by the NO, but the kinetics of NO desorption are more rapid in
RAPTA-C@CPO-27(Ni)
than
in
the
empty
CPO-27(Ni),
as
seen
in
Figure 2.15C.
Multiple drug loading can also be achieved by the multivariate modu-
lation technique described in Section 2.2.3.
2.2.7
Stimuli-responsive Drug Delivery
Drug release from a drug–MOF structure can be triggered by various in-
ternal and external stimuli. In particular, changes in the internal pH of the
body can be a potent trigger for the release of drugs from anticancer DDSs.
In healthy cells the intracellular pH (pHi) is slightly lower than the extra-
cellular pH (pHe), with values in the ranges of 7.0–7.2 and 7.3–7.4, re-
spectively. However, in cancer cells pHe lies in the range of 7.12–7.65 and
pHi is much lower, in the range of 6.2–6.9.109 Adhikari et al. have studied
the encapsulation and controlled release of doxorubicin from the Zn-based
MOFs ZIF-7, where the linker is 4,5-dichloroimidazolate, and ZIF-8,
where the linker is 2-methylimidazolate, under diﬀerent pH conditions
(Figure 2.16A).110 A change of pH from physiological conditions to acidic
does not aﬀect ZIF-7, whereas ZIF-8 releases the drug in an acidic en-
vironment. Both MOFs exhibit drug release when they come into contact
with biomimetic systems, such as lipid membranes and micelles. Aba´nades
La´zaro et al. have showed pH-responsive anticancer drug delivery of Zr-
based UiO-66s by selective surface PEGylation (Figure 2.16B).74 NMOFs
were synthesised at around 200 nm in size, coated with functionalised
modulators, loaded with calcein and then covalently surface modified with
polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains via copper-aided azide–alkyne cycloaddi-
tion (CuAAC). Under neutral conditions, the PEG chains enhance the sta-
bility of the framework by blocking interactions with phosphates present in

PBS, whilst under acidic conditions stimuli-responsive drug release is
achieved, as seen in Figure 2.16C.
Temperature changes can also be used to trigger release from MOF-based
DDSs. An example of this was presented by Jiang et al. using another bio-
compatible Zr-based MOF, ZJU-801, where the linker is (2E,20E)-3,30-(naph-
thalene-1,4-diyl)diacrylic acid (H2NPDA), Figure 2.17A. A loading of 41.7% by
weight could be achieved with the model drug diclofenac sodium (DS;
Figure 2.17B) and on-command heating-activated drug release (Figure 2.17C)
was observed. This was in contrast to the isoreticular DS loaded NU-801
(DS@NU-801), where the linker is H2QDDA [(2E,20E)-3,30-(quinoline-5,8-
diyl)diacrylic acid] (Figure 2.17D), probably due to diﬀering drug–MOF
interactions.111
A pressure sensitive MOF-based DDS has been constructed by loading
the same model drug into ZJU-800, which resulted in a high drug loading
(approximately 58.8% by weight) and release time which could be adjusted
from 2 to 8 days by varying the external pressure.112 In another example,
photo-induced degradation and drug release have been explored by Epley
et al. using the Zr-based MOF UiO-AZB, a structural analogue of UiO-66

where the linker is 4,40-azobenzenedicarboxylate.113 The degradation of the
Zr6O4(OH)4 metal cluster of UiO-AZB is accelerated by irradiation with white
light due to the incorporation of photo-isomerisable linkers, but this also
slows down the release of the lipophilic stain Nile red.
A diﬀerent approach was taken from Chen et al. who developed an
adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-responsive, ATP-aptamer, and hybrid aptamer
(ATP-AS1411) based NMOF for controlled drug release (Figure 2.18).114 The
DDS, Zr-based UiO-68-NH2, is unlocked in the presence of ATP by the for-
mation of complexes between ATP and the aptamer on the MOF, which leads
to the consequent release of doxorubicin (DOX). Results from preliminary
cell studies revealed impressive selective permeation of the NMOF into
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, compared with normal epithelial MCF-10A
breast cells, as well as high cytotoxicity and targeted DOX release from the
ATP-AS1411-functionalised NMOF.
2.2.8
Combination with Other Materials and Techniques
The addition of diﬀerent materials to MOF structures has expanded their
applications. One example of this is the recently developed clustered regu-
larly interspaced short palindromic repeats–CRISPR-associated protein 9
(CRISPR–Cas9) editing platform.115–117 A number of studies have been
published on the application of this technology as a powerful tool against
viruses,118 bacteria,119 and cancer.120 Alsaiari et al. reported the first example
of CRISPR–Cas9 encapsulated in MOFs using ZIF-8 (Figure 2.19A), achieving
an encapsulation eﬃciency of 17% and observing endosomal escape
stimulated by the protonated imidazole linkers.121 The material successfully
reduced green fluorescent protein gene expression by 37% over four days
(Figure 2.19B and C).
In another example, Su et al. developed aptamer-templated silver
nanoclusters embedded in Zr-based MOFs and explored these for targeted

delivery.122

nanoclusters (Ag NCs) inserted into UiO-66 by using the AS1411 aptamer (Apt)

that UiO-66@AgNCs@Apt nanostructures possessed low cytotoxicity towards
MCF-7 cancer cells but when drug loaded led to high cytotoxicity and enhanced
therapeutic eﬀects in vitro.
Another example of the combination of MOFs with other materials is
presented by Tian et al., who explored the incorporation of graphene
quantum dots (GQD) and DOX into ZIF-8 for synergistic chemotherapy and
photothermal therapy.123 The resultant nanoparticles successfully converted
near-infrared (NIR) irradiation into heat, and combined chemotherapy and
photothermal therapy led to higher killing eﬃcacy on 4T1 breast cancer cells
compared with either of the therapies alone.

loaded with DOX, and explored these for NIR-responsive combination
therapy (Figure 2.20).124 A high loading capacity for DOX and chelation of
the Mn carbonyl was achieved, while the photothermal properties of the
magnetic core allowed for the conversion of NIR light to heat, which in turn
triggered the release of both DOX from the pores and CO from the Mn
complex. This ultimately led to the death of tumour cells. Furthermore, the
NPs also allowed for dual-mode magnetic resonance (MR) and photoacoustic
(PA) imaging of the tumour.

storage capacities. Their easy functionalisation renders them a promising
family of materials to explore for various applications, since alterations
can be made either during synthesis or post-synthetically by changing
parameters such as the temperature, pressure, and reaction vessel, or
by introducing modulators, monotopic organic molecules, acids, and
bases. A large number of these materials are biocompatible or have very
low toxicity and their role as drug-delivery systems has been explored
thoroughly. The limited in vivo studies performed to date have indicated
the high biocompatibility of MOFs. Results from many studies have
demonstrated that MOFs are ideal candidates for delivery of various
therapeutic molecules, for combination with other therapies and imaging
techniques, and are promising for clinical applications.125 However more
research, particularly to determine long-term stability and fate in vivo,
needs to be performed before MOFs are seen on the shelf.

Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles
2.3.1
Introduction
Mesoporous silica is a class of synthetic silica which contain pores in the
range of 2–50 nm, and can be easily prepared on the nanoscale to form
mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). First prepared in the early 1990s as
molecular sieves,126,127 it took until 2001 for Vallet-Regi et al. to report the
use of MSNs as a DDS with a sustained drug-release performance.128 Since
then, various mesoporous silica materials with diﬀerent structures and
functionalities have been developed for many applications, including drug
and gene delivery.129–132
As drug delivery agents, MSNs present a number of advantages: (i) their
large surface areas and pore volumes enable high drug loading within the
channels; (ii) their mesoporous structures and adjustable pore sizes oﬀer
control over drug loading and release kinetics; (iii) their easily modifiable
surfaces can provide targeted and controlled drug delivery with enhanced
therapeutic eﬃcacy and decreased systemic toxicity, and also protect them
against deactivation and biodegradation; and, (iv) their tuneable struc-
tures allow their combinations with magnetic, luminescent, and/or ther-
apeutic compounds.133–137 Moreover, MSNs oﬀer many advantages over
other DDSs. The giant pores, from 2 up to 50 nm, and high surface area
even enable the accommodation of other DDSs within them, combining
their features in a single entity, and their inorganic nature provides high
thermal and chemical stability and resistance to corrosion under extreme
conditions compared with traditional organic DDSs, such as liposomes,
emulsions, or polymers.138,139 In this section, we provide an overview of
MSNs as DDSs, including their preparation and biocompatibility, their
targeted and controlled drug delivery applications, and use in multi-
functional combinations.

2.3.2
Synthesis of MSNs
The synthesis of MSNs is mainly achieved through supramolecular self-
assembly, based on hydrolysis and condensation of silanes in basic, acidic or
neutral aqueous solutions. In general, surfactants (non-ionic or cationic)
such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or amphiphilic block
copolymers self-aggregate into micelles at a concentration above the critical
micelle concentration, as shown in Figure 2.21. Next, silica precursors such
as tetraethoxysilane, tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) or sodium metasilicate
(Na2SiO3) hydrolyse and condense at the surface of the surfactant micelle
templates forming a silica wall. Finally, the surfactant templates are re-
moved by calcination or solvent extraction, and MSNs are obtained.140,141
The most widely researched type of MSNs is Mobil Crystalline Material-41
(MCM-41), invented at the laboratories of the Mobil Corporation, consisting
of one-dimensional cylindrical mesopores (2–10 nm) in a two-dimensional
hexagonal structure.142 The material structure can be altered by controlling
key parameters during synthesis, such as the surfactant template, silica
precursor, solution pH and concentration, temperature, stirring rate and
time,
or
through
the
addition
of
co-solvents
or
organic
swelling
agents.143–145 MSNs are mainly sub-classified as ordered mesoporous silica
(OMSs) and hollow type MSNs (HMSs).
The Mobil 41 series (M41S) type MSN family, including MCM-41, MCM-48
and MCM-50, and SBA-15, are the most commonly used OMSs for bio-
medical applications. Unlike MCM-41, MCM-48 type MSNs possess three-
dimensional cubic pores and higher surface area (up to 1600 m2 g1), with a
bicontinuous, branched, pore structure that enables rapid molecular
transport and enhanced thermal stability.140 MCM-50 is characterised by
one-dimensional lamellae-like arranged pores, which are generated by sili-
cate or porous aluminosilicate layers separated by sheets or bilayers of
Figure 2.21

Chapter 2

surfactant molecules with hydrophilic head groups.146 SBA-15 MSNs from
the Santa Barbara Amorphous system (SBA) family are synthesised in highly
acidic media using polymer templates, such as amphiphilic triblock co-
polymers with mesostructural ordering properties.142,145 As with MCM-41,
SBA-15 has a well-ordered hexagonal mesoporous structure and one-
dimensional parallel channels.147 However, it has generally thicker pore
walls (3.1–6.4 nm), wider pore sizes (4–30 nm) and rougher surface
morphology than MCM-41.142 The thicker walls contribute to the hydro-
thermal and mechanical stability of the material.
HMSs possess a hollow core and a mesoporous shell structure. The hollow
core allows very high drug loadings by acting as a storage reservoir, while the
mesoporous shell can be easily functionalised.143–145 As such, the storage
capacity of HMSs can reach over 1 g of drug per 1 g of silica.148 HMSs are
generally fabricated by two diﬀerent template methods: (i) hard-templating,
which uses polymer beads, metal or metal oxide nanoparticles, or semi-
conductor nanoparticles, and (ii) soft-templating, which uses soft materials
such as oil-in-water emulsion droplets, surfactant vesicles, polymer aggregates,
or gas bubbles (acoustic cavities) as templates for assembly of the silica shell
on their surface.149 Soft-templated MSNs can be fabricated more easily under
mild conditions compared with hard-templated MSNs and can encapsulate
other reagents during the synthesis, which makes them more versatile.145
2.3.3
MSN Characteristics Influencing Drug Delivery
To obtain an ideal drug delivery system with MSNs, many factors have to be
taken into account, such as particle and pore size and morphology, and
surface chemistry. The influences of these characteristics are discussed and
exemplified below.
2.3.3.1
Particle and Pore Size and Morphology
Particle size has a significant eﬀect on the blood circulation time as well as
the tissue penetration and cellular uptake of MSNs. Small particles have
mostly been shown to diﬀuse with faster kinetics throughout a tumour
matrix and can be endocytosed with higher eﬃciency than larger par-
ticles.150,151 Bouchoucha et al. reported the highest cellular uptake and drug
release as well as tumour growth inhibition with the smallest nanoparticles
when looking at diﬀerent-sized MSNs (45–500 nm) with similar physico-
chemical properties.151 Lu et al. and Mo et al. separately reported that the
most suitable size particles for MSN-based drug delivery with maximum
cellular accumulation and the capacity to cross the blood–brain barrier
(BBB) are about 40–50 nm (Figure 2.22).152,153
Particle shape and surface roughness also have a significant eﬀect on the
cellular uptake of MSNs. MSNs with a high aspect ratio (AR, length : width) or
with surface roughness have been shown to possess a higher transmem-
brane transport rate than those with a low AR or with a smooth surface, due
Inorganic Materials in Drug Delivery
45

to their greater surface area for interactions with the cell surface.154–156 You
et al. reported that changing the shape of mesoporous silica nanomaterials
from spheres to rods improves their drug-loading capacity and anticancer
activity. They obtained 26 mg mg1 loading of doxorubicin (DOX) with
nanorods, but only 7 mg mg1 with nanospheres. The amount of loaded
drug was further increased up to 42 mg mg1 through carboxylation of the
rod surface.154 The nanorods also exhibited a prolonged blood circulation
time in vivo as well as significant tumour growth inhibition in a nude
mouse model.
Morphology, size, length, structure, and arrangement of pores in MSNs
are other principal factors controlling drug loading and release. Cubic-pore
MCM-48 exhibits higher drug loading and faster drug release (due to its
highly accessible pore morphology) compared with MCM-41, which has
unidirectional, uniform hexagonal mesopores.157 In general, large pore size
is correlated with higher drug loading and faster drug release.158,159 Jia et al.
reported enhanced paclitaxel (PTX) loading and anti-tumour activity by in-
creasing the pore size of MSNs from 3 to 10 nm.158 However, a threshold
limit of pore size for drug release has been reported using ibuprofen (IBU)
loaded MSNs. An amorphous form of IBU was achieved with pore sizes
smaller than 10 nm, whereas IBU was found to crystallise in MSN pores of
around 20 nm diameter.160 This resulted in reduced dissolution rates
compared with the molecularly adsorbed IBU in smaller pores.

2.3.3.2
Surface Functionalisation
The silanol surface chemistry of MSN provides a high level of versatility to
the nanomaterial.161 By introducing functional groups either on the external
or internal surfaces, or on both surfaces, the surface chemistry can be
modified to tune physical and chemical properties, including aqueous dis-
persibility, biocompatibility, cargo loading and delivery, or disease targeting
ability. Surface modification of MSNs is conducted either through electro-
static interactions, usually using the negative charges of the surface silanols at
neutral pH, or by covalent conjugation with chemically accessible surface si-
lanols.162 Electrostatic modification usually employs positively charged struc-
tures such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) to form an adsorbed coating on the
nanoparticle surface.131 Cationic MSNs generally exhibit improved colloidal
solubility and enhanced endocytosis compared with their anionic counter-
parts, owing to their higher aﬃnity to the negatively charged cell surface.163
Covalent attachment of functional groups involves two main approaches: post-
synthetic grafting or co-condensation methods. Post-synthetic grafting com-
prises two steps, synthesis of MSNs and then introduction of the functional
molecules to the accessible silanols, whereas the co-condensation method is
performed in one step by mixing organosilane surface modifiers, the sur-
factant templates, and the silica sources together.164 For example, Wani et al.
reported the fabrication of –SH, mixed –SH : –NH2 (50 : 50) and –NH2 functio-
nalised MSNs by co-condensation of TEOS, 3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane
(MPTMS), and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS). After loading them
with the anticancer drug mitoxantrone, the highest drug loading (18% w/w)
and the slowest drug release was found with thiol-MSNs.165 Balas et al. re-
ported an almost threefold increase in alendronate loading compared with
unfunctionalised MSNs when they covalently grafted silanols with amino
groups to the surfaces.166
MSNs can also be enveloped by a lipid bilayer (LB), the products of which
are termed MSN-supported LB or ‘protocells’.167 The procedure can be
conducted via hydrophobic interactions,168,169 by covalent attachment,170 or
simply by coating with lipids171 or polymer–lipids.172 Functionalisation of
the silica surface by polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugation is also a fre-
quently employed procedure to enhance the dispersibility of MSNs in
aqueous solutions. This can increase their blood circulation time, shield
their surfaces from aggregation, and help the nanoparticles to escape from
reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake by decreasing nonspecific protein
binding, hence improving their EPR eﬀect and drug delivery capabil-
ities.173,174 The attachment of active targeting vectors is another extensively
used surface functionalisation approach applied to target specific tissues
and maximise the cellular uptake of particles and their cargo drugs. The
modification of the MSN surface with targeting moieties, such as folate,
transferrin, or peptides, has been shown to enhance delivery of drugs to
cancer cells and to decrease the required dosage of the DDS in many studies,
which will be detailed in Section 2.3.4.1.175–177

2.3.3.3
Biocompatibility of MSNs
The biocompatibility of MSNs will depend on a number of physicochemical
properties, such as size, morphology, and surface functionality. Some in vitro
and in vivo studies have demonstrated good biocompatibility of MSNs.178,179
However, there are many reports of high toxicity, especially with naked MSNs
at high concentrations, and depending on the number of accessible surface
silanol groups.180–182 Hudson et al. reported the systemic toxicity of un-
functionalised bare mesoporous silicates of MCM-41, SBA-15 and siliceous
mesocellular foam (MCF).180 Particles of between 150 and 4000 nm showed a
significant degree of in vitro toxicity towards mesothelial cells at high
concentrations. Similarly, Tao et al. reported concentration- and time-
dependent inhibition eﬀects of unfunctionalised MSNs on cellular respir-
ation, particularly with SBA-15 type MSNs.181 The toxicity of bare MSNs has
also been demonstrated by the assessment of blood compatibility in terms of
the haemolytic activity, thrombogenicity and non-specific protein ad-
sorption.182 Bare MSNs demonstrated high toxicity to red blood cells (RBCs)
and caused significant haemolysis at concentrations between 0.05 and
1 mg ml1. However, surface functionalisation of MSNs with diﬀerent sur-
face functional groups (ionic, polar, neutral, and hydrophobic) reduced or
even completely eliminated the haemolytic activity of bare MSNs, as shown
in Figure 2.23. In addition, decoration of the surface with ionic groups
(aminopropyl and methylphosphonate propyl) minimised non-specific pro-
tein adsorption, while none of the MSNs showed significant thrombogenic
activity.
In addition to concentration and surface chemistry, the behaviour of
MSNs varies with their size and shape. Vallhov et al. showed that smaller
particles (270 nm) and lower concentrations exert minor toxicity on human
monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) compared with larger particles
(2.5 mm) and higher concentrations, and also lead to reduced eﬀects on
immune-regulatory markers.183 Similarly, Orlando et al. reported that
250 nm MSNs possess higher toxicity than smaller 30 nm ones at the same
dose, aﬀecting mitophagy and the membrane integrity of endothelial
cells.184 However, He et al. reported significant toxicity with nanoscale MSNs
(190–420 nm) at concentrations above 25 mg ml1 while microscale particles
(1220 nm) only showed slight cytotoxicity over a broad concentration range
owing to their lower cellular uptake.185 Similarly, Acosta et al. showed higher
toxicity with bare nano-sized mesoporous silica particles (MSPs) compared
with micro-sized MSPs in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.186 The nano-
sized MSPs caused a significant reduction in movement capacity, a decrease
in lifespan, a depletion in reproductive status, and an increased sensitivity to
oxidative stress, whilst micro-sized MSPs were innocuous. However, surface
functionalisation with a starch derivative reduced the toxicity of nano-sized
MSPs. Shao et al. reported that the shape of MSNs does not significantly
aﬀect their biocompatibility, but does aﬀect the biodistribution of the
particles.187 Results from this and several other studies have indicated that
48
Chapter 2

long rod-shaped MSNs exhibit slower clearance rates than short rod-shaped
and spherical MSNs, and higher intracellular internalisation and accumu-
lation in tumour sites.154,155,187–190
The administration route also has a significant eﬀect on the in vivo bio-
logical behaviours of MSNs. Hudson et al. reported that the administration
of MSNs by subcutaneous injection in mice led to no toxicity, while intra-
peritoneal and intravenous injections cause thrombosis as a local tissue
reaction to the MSNs.180 Clearly, there are multiple reports with contrasting
conclusions depending both on the nature of the MSN and the test protocol.
In general, surface functionalisation tends to mitigate deleterious eﬀects,
but it is clear that individual DDSs must be rigorously tested – bio-
compatibility cannot be assumed on the basis of previous work – and if they
are to be employed in clinical settings then strict reproducibility of synthesis
from batch to batch is key.
2.3.4
MSN-based Drug Delivery
Drug delivery by MSNs has been demonstrated through both passive or
active-targeting routes, and also using stimuli-responsive drug delivery sys-
tems, examples of which will be given in the following sections.

2.3.4.1
Targeted Drug Delivery
2.3.4.1.1
Passive Drug Delivery.
Passive drug delivery relies on the EPR
eﬀect of tumour tissues, which are characterised by leaky vasculature in
the epithelial layer of the tumour blood vessels and ineﬃcient lymphatic
drainage in comparison to normal tissues.191 This physiological abnormal-
ity allows nanoparticles to preferentially and passively accumulate in the
tumour microenvironment. The passive targeting mechanism strongly de-
pends on the structural parameters of MSNs, such as their morphology,
particle size and surface characteristics, all of which can aﬀect the circu-
lation time of nanoparticles in the blood and their ability to bypass bio-
logical barriers. For example, a size range of 10–200 nm helps avoid renal
clearance of small particles and phagocytic clearance of larger ones. Coat-
ing with poly(ethylene glycol), PEGylation, helps prevent nonspecific pro-
tein binding and RES clearance, and thus can prolong the circulation time
and increase accumulation in the tumour.
Using this mechanism, several MSN-based drug delivery systems have
been developed.192–196 For example, Zhang et al. reported improved oral
absorption of the poorly soluble drug telmisartan (TEL) using MSNs. To
explore the mechanism behind the enhanced oral absorption, they com-
pared the oral bioavailability of TEL-loaded MSNs with TEL-loaded ordered
mesoporous silica microparticles (MSMs) in beagle dogs, and obtained a
higher drug absorption rate with the nanoparticles compared with the mi-
croparticles.192 Similar approaches have also been used by other groups to
increase the bioavailability of orally administered poorly soluble drugs, such
as itraconazole,193 and fenofibrate,194 or to enhance the therapeutic eﬃcacy
of anticancer drugs.195,196 However, passive delivery can be limited by a
number of factors, including the lack of cell-specific interactions of nano-
particles, variations in the permeability of vessels, or multidrug resistance
(MDR) of the cancer cells.197
2.3.4.1.2
Active-targeted Drug Delivery.
An eﬀective way to overcome the
limitations of passive drug delivery is to decorate the MSN surface with
molecules such as peptides, aptamers, antibodies or small molecules
which have high aﬃnity to receptors over-expressed on the desired target
tissues, predominantly on tumours or subcellular organelles, as summar-
ised in Table 2.1. In contrast to passive delivery, active targeted drug deliv-
ery involves specific binding to the target cells and provides better cellular
internalisation and accumulation of the drugs by receptor-mediated
endocytosis.191
The small molecule folic acid has been widely employed to target the fo-
late receptors over-expressed on most cancer cells.175,209 For example, Zhang
et al. reported greater uptake of folic acid functionalised MSNs by folate-
receptor-rich HeLa cancer cells compared with folate-receptor-poor human
embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells.175 Monoclonal antibodies are another
type of targeting ligands utilised for active delivery of drugs. Epidermal
50
Chapter 2

growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a well-known target expressed on some
cancer cell lines. Tran et al. reported successful targeting of human epithelial
neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) using EGFR antibody conjugated, cisplatin
loaded, MSN compositions.198 In comparison to non-functionalised MSNs,
the EGFR-targeted MSNs showed higher cytotoxicity against SH-SY5H cancer
cells. MSNs have also been extensively investigated as liver cancer-targeted
DDSs. For this purpose, several MSN compositions have been fabricated by
conjugation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) targeting ligands such as
glycyrrhetinic acid (GA),200 AS1411 aptamer,202 or lactose.203 Lv et al. reported
the targeting of a water-insoluble drug, curcumin, toward HepG2 cells
through a specific GA receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism as depicted
in Figure 2.24A, and obtained enhanced cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of the
nanoparticles.200
Apart from cell membrane receptors, MSNs have also been functionalised
to target subcellular organelles, such as the nucleus206 or mitochondria.210
As shown in Figure 2.24B, the conjugation of transactivator of transcription
(TAT) nuclear-targeting ligands to the MSN surface improves the therapeutic
eﬃciency of the anticancer drug DOX by bypassing the P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
drug eﬄux pumps which cause multidrug resistance, directly targeting the
nucleus of multidrug-resistant MCF-7/ADR cancer cells.206 MSNs can also be
functionalised with two targeting agents for dual targeting of cell membrane
and subcellular organelles. Lo´pez et al. reported such a targeting mechanism
using Janus MSNs, asymmetrically decorated with folic acid for targeting of
folate membrane receptors and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for targeting

(Figure 2.24C).211 This example highlights both the synthetic versatility of
MSNs and the complexity that can be achieved with appropriate design.
2.3.4.2
Stimuli-responsive Drug Delivery
One of the major advantages of MSNs as drug delivery systems is their ability
to be rendered stimuli-responsive, which is important for preventing the
release of cargo prior to reaching the targeted disease locus. This protects
healthy cells, limiting deleterious side eﬀects, and can also protect the drug
from decomposition in biological fluids, thereby enhancing the eﬃcacy of
the therapy. Cargo-loaded mesopores of MSNs can be blocked by various
‘gatekeepers’ which can be triggered to open upon exposure to a stimulus
and therefore release the entrapped cargo molecules. These systems are
classified as internal or external stimuli-responsive MSNs depending on the
type of the stimulus.
2.3.4.2.1
Internal Stimuli-responsive Controlled Drug Delivery.
Internal
stimuli-responsive drug delivery is controlled by innate inner environ-
mental changes in biological systems such as pH, redox, temperature, or
exposure to biomolecules.
2.3.4.2.1.1
pH.
The human body shows variations in pH from the gas-
trointestinal tract (pH in stomach ¼ 1.0–3.0; small intestine ¼ 6.5–7.0;
colon ¼ 7.0–8.0) to tumour and inflammatory tissues (pH approximately
6.8), whereas the pH of healthy tissues and blood is approximately
7.4.163,212 These variations provide a potential internal trigger to control
the
release
behaviour
from
a
pH-responsive
carrier.
A
series
of
pH-responsive gatekeepers including polyelectrolytes,213,214 pH-sensitive
linkers,199,215 supramolecular nanovalves,216,217 and acid-decomposable in-
organic materials218,219 have been used to control the release of drug mol-
ecules from MSNs, as summarised in Table 2.2. For example, Zhang et al.
reported pH-sensitive dextran–MSN-based DDSs using NaIO4 oxidised
dextran dialdehydes (PADs) as a gatekeeper. These were conjugated with
MSNs
via
the
acid
labile
hydrazone
bond,
and
loaded
with
DOX
(Figure 2.25A).215 In the weakly acidic intracellular environment (pH ap-
proximately 5.5) the hydrazone bond, which is stable under physiological
conditions (pH 7.4), is ruptured and allows the release of DOX. Chen et al.
reported the conjugation of lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles
(UCNPs) (NaGdF4 : Yb/Tm@NaGdF4) with an ultra-thin TaOx layer, and
used the composite as a gatekeeper at the pores of MSNs.219 Under acidic
conditions, the entrapped drug escaped from the MSN pores after the hy-
drolysis of acetal groups and removal of the UCNPs. In addition to these
pH-responsive degradative systems, ‘nanovalve’ materials responding to
various triggers have been frequently employed as gatekeepers to consti-
tute
stimuli-responsive
MSNs.162

based on the weakening of the binding strength between the cyclic cap

and the stalk under certain conditions, which results in large-amplitude
sliding motions of the caps and thus the unblocking of the pore openings
(Figure 2.25B).216
2.3.4.2.1.2
Redox Potential.
The level of glutathione (GSH) in the intra-
cellular fluid is 100–1000 times higher than that in the extracellular
media. Furthermore, GSH concentrations are at least fourfold higher in
some tumour cells than in healthy cells. This has attracted much attention
for the design of redox-responsive drug delivery systems.220 GSH is an en-
dogenous reducing agent that breaks disulfide bonds into free thiols.163
Several redox-responsive MSN-based drug delivery systems have therefore
been produced by attaching gatekeepers (such as Fe3O4
221 and CdS133
nanoparticles, MnO2 nanosheets,220 or nanovalves222) on the MSN surface
using
disulfide
bonds,
as
summarised
in
Table
2.2.
For
example,
Chen et al. reported the preparation of transferrin gated MSNs via
redox-cleavable disulfide bonds and explored their applications for DOX
delivery.176 Here, transferrin acted as both a gatekeeper and a targeting
ligand simultaneously. As depicted in Figure 2.26A, in the presence of
GSH the disulfide bonds between the gatekeeper and MSN are broken,
resulting in the release of DOX from the pores. In another example,
Luo et al. reported the fabrication of redox-triggered hollow mesoporous
silica nanoreservoirs using lactobionic acid grafted b-cyclodextrin (b-CD)
as a gatekeeper in order to deliver DOX to tumour cells with reduced side
eﬀects and enhanced therapeutic eﬃciency.223
2.3.4.2.1.3
Temperature.
A significant characteristic of tumour-bearing
tissues is their higher temperature compared with healthy tissues. This
arises because of the rapid pace of cancer cell replication,145 and can be
employed as an internal trigger to construct temperature-responsive con-
trolled drug delivery systems. The incorporation of a temperature-sensitive
polymer such as poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) has been widely
utilised to construct MSNs with temperature-sensitive properties.224,225
This polymer exhibits a swollen hydrated state at temperatures below the
lower critical solution temperature (LCST), which blocks the pores and
prevents drug release from the MSN channels, whereas above the LCST
the polymer chains become hydrophobic and shrink in the aqueous me-
dium. This results in the opening of the MSN pores, and thereby release
of the drug cargo.212 Kang et al. reported the production of a successful
temperature-sensitive ‘on–oﬀ’ drug release system by filling a rattle-type
MSN (solid nanoparticle core–mesoporous silica shell structure) with a
PNIPAM-based hydrogel.224 The incorporated drug, indomethacin, showed
a rapid drug release rate above 45 1C (on phase), whereas the release com-
pletely stopped at 20 1C (oﬀphase) (Figure 2.26B, Table 2.2). In addition
to polymers, various temperature-responsive structures, such as DNA,226
coiled-coil peptide motifs,227 or paraﬃns228 have also been employed as

gatekeepers to control drug release through their melting or disaggre-
gation features at specific temperatures.
2.3.4.2.1.4
Biomolecules.
Exploiting innate biomolecules has become
an important aspect of internal stimuli-responsive systems. So far, biomo-
lecules such as enzymes,229,230 ATP,231 antigens,232 blood sugars,233,234
and H2O2
235 have been used as triggers to uncap MSNs (Table 2.2).

Chapter 2

Incorporation of an enzyme cleavable linkage into the capping systems is
a popular way to develop a system that responds to internal biomolecules.
For example, Bernardos et al. prepared pancreatin (a mixture of amylase,
lipase, and proteases) and b-D-galactosidase responsive MCM-41-based
materials, functionalised on the pore outlets using saccharide derivatives
as
gatekeepers,

enzymes uncap the pores via selective hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond be-
tween b-D-glucose in the starch chains, while b-D-galactosidase hydrolyses
glycosidic bonds between b-D-galactose and b-D-glucose, both allowing
release of cargo. In another example, ATP was used in order to change the
conformation of ATP-aptamer caps, prepared by hybridisation of the apta-
mer with single-stranded DNAs that had been grafted to the pores of
MSNs.231 As shown in Figure 2.27A, in the presence of ATP the aptamer
combines with ATP and causes the decomposition of the cap structure.
This results in the release of the guest molecules from the pores.
Some diseases are characterised by the overproduction of certain chemical
species, and these agents can also be used as triggers for stimuli-responsive
drug delivery systems. Glucose-sensitive gatekeepers can, for instance, be
employed for diabetes treatment. Zhao et al. reported the fabrication of a
glucose-responsive MSN-based delivery system for the release of both insulin
and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which stimulates insulin se-
cretion by activating Ca21 channels in pancreatic beta cells.234 As depicted in
Figure 2.27B, gluconic acid-modified insulin (G-Ins) protein gatekeepers
respond to glucose and allow the release of conjugated insulin and cAMP
encapsulated within the pores.
2.3.4.2.2
External Stimuli-responsive Drug Delivery.
External stimuli-
responsive drug delivery is controlled by outer environmental changes
such as manual manipulation of light, magnetic field, or ultrasound. It
can represent a more precise and easily controllable approach compared
with the internal stimuli-activated MSN systems, but does require add-
itional human intervention.
2.3.4.2.2.1
Light.
Light-responsive MSN structures are commonly pre-
pared to obtain controllable and non-invasive drug release under simu-
lated biological conditions. The most widely employed strategy is to
build MSNs with light-sensitive photocleavable linkers that can be rup-
tured under illumination with light of a specific wavelength, and
thus induce the release of the cargo from the pores.196,236–238 For ex-
ample, Vivero-Escoto et al. constructed a photo-responsive drug delivery
system conjugating gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) to the MSN surface
with a photo-responsive linker [thioundecyl-tetraethyleneglycolester-o-
nitrobenzylethyldimethyl ammonium bromide (TUNA)] to keep hydro-

the pores due to charge repulsion between the remaining Au-NPs and
MSN (Figure 2.28A). In another example, the surfaces of MSNs were con-
jugated with azobenzene groups (4-aminoazobenzene, azo-NH2) through
a singlet oxygen-sensitive linker containing a bis-(alkylthio)alkene link-
age and two carboxylic groups. The MSNs were further decorated with a
photodynamic therapy (PDT) photosensitiser [Chlorin e6 (Ce6)] adjacent
to the linker (Figure 2.28B).237 Subsequently, model cargo molecules
were loaded into the channels, and folic acid conjugated b-cyclodextran
was introduced as a gatekeeper. Upon irradiation of the structure with a
660 nm laser, Ce6 was excited to generate singlet oxygen, which caused
the cleavage of the linker-azo and subsequently release of the cargo.
Dai et al. reported 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) light controlled dual-drug
release
using
mesoporous
silica-coated
NaYF4 : Yb0.4/Tm0.02@NaGdF4 :
Yb0.1@NaNdF4 : Yb0.1 UCNPs with a core–shell structure.238 The mesoporous
silica pores were loaded with DOX whilst the surface was functionalised with
b-cyclodextrin rings via a light cleavable platinum (IV) pro-drug {trans,trans,
trans-[Pt(N3)2(NH3)(py)(CCH2CH2COOH)2} bridge. Upon 808 nm NIR light
irradiation, the UCNPs emitted UV light, caused the platinum (IV) prodrug to
reduce to toxic platinum (II) complexes, and opened the mesopores of the
silica, allowing the release of DOX molecules. The results of in vitro studies
indicated extensive cell death and results of in vivo studies confirmed higher
antitumour eﬃcacy under 808 nm NIR light than UV light (365 nm), due to
the higher tissue penetration of 808 nm NIR light. Whilst light is a highly
attractive external stimulus, the major issue faced in clinical applications is
selection of an appropriate wavelength that can penetrate tissues and not
cause excessive local heating, as in this example.

Magnetic Field.
Magnetic field triggered MSNs are usually
composed of a silica matrix encapsulating a magnetic core. Bringas et al.
synthesised MSNs with a magnetic core (comprising superparamagnetic
iron oxide NPs, SPIONs) and coated this structure with a lipid bilayer after
encapsulating methylene blue inside the pores.239 Under an alternating
magnetic field, the permeability of the lipid bilayer increased, and acti-
vated the cargo delivery (see Figure 2.29A). Another approach is to use
temperature-sensitive linkers between gatekeepers and MSNs containing a
magnetic core. Magnetic nanoparticles, such as SPIONs, can transform
magnetic energy into heat and under a magnetic field the thermal energy
generated can be used to break the thermo-responsive linkers blocking the
pore outlets of MSNs. Saint-Cricq et al. reported the application of a
thermo-responsive azo-functionalised polymer (azo-PEG) as a coating to
block the mesopores of MSNs containing a SPION core and the guest mol-
ecule rhodamine 6G.240 Upon exposure to a magnetic field, the release of
rhodamine 6G was triggered via polymer degradation (Figure 2.29B).

waves can travel across a fluid and trigger degradation of ultrasound sen-
sitive molecules, such as porphyrins. In one example, derivatives of ferro-
cene were grafted to the pore outlets of MOFs by Kwon et al.242 Under
ultrasound irradiation, the cleavage of ferrocene occurred, resulting in
opening of the pore outlets. In another study, poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) was used as a capping agent to encapsulate ibuprofen inside MSN
pores.243 Upon ultrasound irradiation, a pulsatile release profile of ibu-
profen was obtained compared with PDMS alone.
2.3.4.3
Dual/Multiple Stimuli-responsive Drug Delivery
Dual or multiple stimuli responsive controlled drug delivery systems employ
two or more stimuli response mechanisms, independently or simul-
taneously. Various dual stimuli responsive MSN systems have been de-
veloped combining redox and enzyme,244 pH and redox,245 pH and light246
and pH and ultrasound triggers,247 as well as even more complex multiple
stimuli-responsive formulations responding to for instance pH, redox, and
light,248 or magnetic field, redox, and temperature.249 For example, Hegazy
et al. reported magnetic, reductive, and thermal triple-responsive core–shell
magnetic MSNs. These were prepared with a Fe3O4 magnetic core and coated
with the temperature-sensitive polymer PNIPAM.249 The particles were
loaded with DOX at 50 1C, where the polymer chains undergo a coil-to
globule transition and shrink into a compact mass. The results of in vitro
release studies indicated that the particles possess high DOX release under
an alternating magnetic field at 40 1C and in cellular conditions with a re-
ductive environment, such as tumour and inflammatory sites, by dint of
magnetic hyperthermia, temperature, and reducing agents.

Co-delivery of Drugs and Genes
The selected examples in the previous section show routes to achieve de-
livery of individual active ingredients. MSNs also exhibit great potential for
co-delivery of drugs and nucleic acids, particularly to overcome MDR of tu-
mours. To achieve this, the negatively charged surface of untreated MSNs is
usually modified with positively charged organic adjuncts, such as PEI,131
poly-L-lysine (PLL),132 or polyamidoamine (PAMAM),250 to promote the
loading of negatively charged nucleic acids onto their structure by electro-
static
interactions.251
Ma
et

demonstrated
the
preparation
of
folate-targeted PEI-capped therapeutic MSNs loaded with DOX and small
interfering RNA (siRNA).252 The nanoparticles showed pH-responsive features
owing to the protonation of the PEI amine groups under intracellular acidic
conditions, and led to successful simultaneous delivery of DOX and siRNA
against the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) anti-apoptotic protein, suppressing ex-
pression of the latter (Figure 2.31A). Chen et al. presented a similar strategy
loading both DOX and Bcl-2-targeted siRNA in MSNs, as depicted in
Figure 2.31B.250 In this case, the nanoparticles were modified with amine-
terminated PAMAM dendrimers, following DOX loading into the mesopores,
and then complexed with siRNA. The results indicated that DOX molecules are
primarily localised in the perinuclear region, bypassing the eﬄux pumps in
multidrug-resistant A2780/AD human ovarian cancer cells. The formulation led
to the suppression of Bcl-2 mRNA; correspondingly, a 132-fold increase of cy-
totoxicity of DOX compared with free DOX was observed. In another example,
Meng et al. targeted P-gp eﬄux pumps through siRNA for P-gp knockdown,
significantly suppressing the pumps’ functions at heterogeneous tumour sites
and inducing apoptosis in vitro and in vivo by co-delivering DOX.253
2.3.5.2
Combination of MSNs with Other Materials
The versatile nature of MSNs allows integration of multiple diagnostic and/
or therapeutic functions within a single platform. They have been widely
incorporated into hybrids by combination with other materials, such as
hydroxyapatite to enhance biodegradability and increase drug loading
capacity;254 magnetic nanoparticles for simultaneous MR imaging and drug
delivery,134 or magnetically targeted therapy;255 quantum dots (QDs) or
UCNPs for gatekeeping,133 real-time monitoring of drug release,135,136 or
fluorescence imaging;256 Au nanorods (NRs) for photothermal therapy
(PTT),137 or photosensitisers for PDT.237,257 These possibilities are discussed
in more detail in Chapter 4.

various cargos, including drugs, genes, photosensitisers, or diagnostics, in high
amounts to bypass MDR of cancer cells, or to allow simultaneous bioimaging
and drug delivery applications. However, their biodistribution, degradation,
and possible side eﬀects need to be more thoroughly investigated in pre-clinical

Layered Materials
2.4.1
Introduction
Inorganic materials which possess a layered internal structure are particu-
larly attractive as candidates for drug delivery platforms. The structure of
such layered materials (LMs) is based on two-dimensional sheets of material
which are stacked into a three-dimensional array, and held together by ionic
or van der Waals forces.258 If the layers bear an overall charge, the interlayer
space contains guest counterions which interact electrostatically with the
charged layers. Materials with negatively charged layers include cationic
guest species, whereas those with positively charged layers are balanced by
anionic species. If the counterions are not bound permanently to the layers,
the material is termed ion-exchangeable, and the process of reversible guest
uptake is called intercalation. This ability to reversibly intercalate ionic
drugs allows such LMs to act as drug carriers (Figure 2.32).
There exist many layered systems which comprise negatively charged layers
and are therefore cation-exchangeable, for example cationic clays,259–261
MXenes,262 metal phosphates,263,264 and metal chalcogenides.265,266 Layered
systems which are able to undergo anion exchange are fewer in number, and
consist almost exclusively of layered metal hydroxides – a class of materials
which includes layered double hydroxides (LDHs),267–271 layered rare-earth
hydroxides (LRHs),272,273 and hydroxy double salts (HDSs).274,275 Of the
aforementioned layered systems, LDHs are by far the most widely studied for
drug delivery applications.
LMs can be designed to release their drug cargo in response to external
stimuli, act as imaging contrast agents, and provide additional therapeutic
functionalities, such as light-triggered hyperthermia. Overall, there is sig-
nificant scope for developing novel drug delivery platforms based on LMs,
which benefit, in particular, from their diverse intercalation chemistry. This
part of the chapter will explore the applications of LMs in drug delivery, their

advantages over other types of systems, and cover notable examples of drug
delivery platforms based on LMs in the literature.
2.4.2
Properties of Layered Materials
A useful property shared by all LMs is their high available surface area for
adsorption relative to their volume, resulting from both the particle surface
as well as the interlayer surface areas being accessible (Figure 2.33). In turn,
this can be exploited to generate intercalates with very high drug loadings,
thereby maximising formulation potency. However, with increasing LM
particle size, adsorption towards the middle of the particles is diﬀusion rate-
limited, leading to lower than theoretical drug loadings. Delamination
of LMs into nanosheets can be used to increase the eﬀective surface
area available for adsorption, leading to enhanced capacity relative to the
bulk LM.276
Perhaps the most advantageous feature of LMs for drug delivery appli-
cations is their extensive intercalation chemistry. Inorganic materials which
contain pores or channels (such as MOFs, zeolites, or MSNs) are rigid and
only capable of accepting guest species of a narrow range of sizes. Therefore,
diﬀerent materials would be required to deliver small molecule actives as
opposed to proteins, for instance. Conversely, some LMs are capable of ex-
panding or contracting their interlayer separation depending on the inter-
calated species. This makes it possible to use the same LM to load a broader
range of guest species.
LMs give rise to a variety of particle shapes and sizes, and in some cases
these can be controlled by adjusting the synthetic method. For instance, it
was demonstrated in one study that Mg–Al LDH particles produced using a
hydrothermal route exhibited smooth spheroid particle shapes and a

relatively uniform size distribution (85–340 nm), while those produced by co-
precipitation were roughly hexagonal in shape with serrated edges and a
much wider particle size distribution (860–4470 nm).277 In addition, it is
possible to synthesise LM particles which have a range of average particle
sizes – from only a few nanometres278 up to micrometre size and be-
yond.279,280 These features are very important in the context of drug delivery,
because particle size and shape greatly influence the in vivo behaviour of the
formulation. Importantly, overall particle size aﬀects how rapidly they are
removed by the immune system (and other biological mechanisms) and how
well they penetrate diﬀerent types of tissue. Particle shape, on the other
hand, influences cellular uptake behaviour, and has even been shown to
allow preferential targeting of sub-cellular features.281
2.4.3
Types of Layered Materials
2.4.3.1
Anion-exchangeable Layered Materials
The vast majority of anion-exchangeable LMs belong to the layered metal hy-
droxides group, which are sometimes referred to as the anionic clays. Of these,
by far the most widely studied are the layered double hydroxides (LDHs). Their
brucite-type structure is based on two dimensional sheets of edge sharing
octahedra (Figure 2.34A), composed of mixed metal ions (typically divalent and
trivalent) coordinated to six hydroxide ions.282 The sheets have a net positive
charge282 which causes them to electrostatically interact with anions and trap
them between the layers forming a three dimensional assembly.283 The basal
spacing between the layers is able to adjust depending on the size of the guest
anion,284 which allows a variety of species to be intercalated.
Another subset of the layered metal hydroxides which have been explored
in drug delivery applications are the HDSs. Unlike LDHs, HDSs contain only
divalent metal centres, octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated to hy-
droxide groups (Figure 2.34B). More recently, attention has turned towards
the LRHs, as they can exhibit magnetic and fluorescent properties useful for
medical imaging. These properties arise from the rare-earth metal ions LRHs
contain.285,286 It is possible to create LDH and HDS based materials which
also exhibit these properties, but this requires further functionalisation and
therefore complicates the synthetic procedure.287,288 Structurally, LRHs are
similar to LDHs and HDSs, but the sheets constitute trivalent rare-earth
metal ions in two high-coordination environments, with eight and nine
vertices,289 which arrange in an edge-sharing fashion (Figure 2.34C). Each
metal centre is coordinated to one water molecule and either seven or eight
hydroxide groups.
2.4.3.2
Cation-exchangeable Layered Materials
Cation-exchangeable LMs span a much larger range of compositions than
anion-exchangeable LMs. The largest class of materials that fall into this cat-
egory are the hydrated aluminium silicates, frequently referred to as cationic
Inorganic Materials in Drug Delivery
69

clays. Of particular interest in drug delivery applications are materials with a
smectite-type structure, in which the interlayer distance is able to expand or
contract depending on the guest species. In the smectite structure, each solid
layer is composed of a layer of edge-sharing Al(OH)6 octahedra, sandwiched
between two layers of vertex-sharing SiO2 tetrahedra (Figure 2.35). Both Al and
Si can be substituted to alter the composition of the clay.

Chapter 2

While a significant body of work exists around graphene (monolayers of
graphite) and its related graphene oxide form within the biomedical
field,290,291 these materials and their bulk crystal counterparts do not exhibit
ion exchange capacity. A relatively newly discovered type of LM similar in
structure to graphene are the so-called MXenes, which are carbides or ni-
trides of transition metals derived from a parent MAX phase (where M is a
transition metal, A is a group 13 or 14 element, and X is either C or N).292
Unlike graphene, multi-layered MXenes have been shown to be capable of
ion exchange,293 as well as the adsorption (and subsequent release) of cat-
ionic drugs on nanosheets of MXene.294 Other types of LMs capable of cation
exchange include some metal titanates, metal phosphates, and metal oxides,
though they have been seldom mentioned in the literature with regard to
their potential as drug delivery platforms.
Another notable type of LM are the transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs), where a transition metal centre is coordinated to a chalcogen
(usually S or Se). TMDs most frequently exist in either a structure similar to
LDHs, with metal centres in an octahedral coordination,295 or in a trigonal
prismatic configuration.296 Their potential in theranostic applications has
begun to attract attention, particularly owing to their favourable photo-
thermal (light to heat) conversion properties.297–299 In their unaltered form,
the layers within TMDs are not charged, and thus do not exhibit ion ex-
change properties. However, a recent report into the application of TMDs for
semiconductor purposes has revealed that intercalation of hexylammonium
cations into TMDs is possible under electrochemical conditions.300 Briefly,
the application of an electrical potential to a TiS2 cathode caused the re-
duction of Ti41 to Ti31, thereby giving the individual layers a negative
charge.300 Hexylammonium ions, dissolved in the electrolyte, were then
intercalated into the TMD as a result of electrostatic interactions. It may

71

therefore be feasible to drive ion exchange in TMDs for drug delivery ap-
plications, using a similar reductive process.
2.4.4
General Synthesis
LMs can be prepared by a variety of synthetic methods – most commonly by
co-precipitation, hydrothermal, solvothermal, sonochemical, and sol–gel
approaches. The co-precipitation method involves the mixing of two solu-
tions, which react to form a precipitate. In the case of LDH materials, for
example, a solution containing the metal cations is added to a basic solution
of the anion to be intercalated.301
Hydrothermal synthesis, as the name implies, is carried out in aqueous
solution or suspension, and occurs during heating in a sealed reaction
vessel. It is often used in combination with co-precipitation to improve the
crystallinity of products obtained. The vapour pressure inside the reaction
vessel can be controlled by selecting the appropriate temperature and the
fill volume. This approach is versatile, commonly employed to produce
LDHs and LRHs,302–308 and has also been used to produce layered chal-
cogenides and metal oxides.309,310 Solvothermal synthesis is an analogous
method employing solvents other than water, and can also be used to
produce both cation and anion-exchangeable LMs.311–315 The main ad-
vantage of using hydrothermal or solvothermal methods is that the re-
action occurs at elevated temperatures and pressures, allowing the eﬃcient
synthesis of materials which may otherwise not form.316 Less common
methods to produce LMs include sonochemical317–320 and mechan-
ochemical synthesis.321–325
The production of nanosheet materials can be broadly classified into two
strategies. ‘Top down’ approaches involve the delamination (also known as
‘exfoliation’) of layers from bulk LM particles. Most commonly this is achieved
either
via
mechanical
means,326,327
or
by
chemical
exfoliation.328–331
Conversely, ‘bottom up’ methods aim to produce nanosheets in one step,
for instance by chemical or physical vapour deposition,332,333 or direct
synthesis.334–337
Intercalation of the desired counterion can be achieved either during the
initial LM synthesis (direct intercalation),338–340 or after the formation of the
LM (by ion exchange, reconstruction, or exfoliation–reassembly). During
direct intercalation, a solution of metal salts is mixed with a solution of the
desired species to be intercalated into the LM. This approach is advan-
tageous because the final product is obtained in a single step, but is not
always viable as it requires that the desired species has a stronger electro-
static interaction with the layers of the LM than do the other species present
in the reaction mixture. For instance, successful direct intercalation of
amino acids into a Zn–Al LDH was shown to be dependent on the overall
charge and hydrophobic character of the amino acid.339
Post-synthetic intercalation methods can often be more practical to use.
Most commonly, this is achieved by ion exchange, which is the diﬀusion of
72
Chapter 2

drug ions from a solution into the interlayer space to replace the initial guest
ions.272,341 Typically, particles of LM are submerged in a solution with the
desired guest in molar excess, and ion exchange is allowed to proceed over
the course of several hours, usually with heating. Another approach is to
use reconstruction,340,342 whereby the LM first undergoes calcination
(which removes any intercalated species). In the case of LDHs, this process
causes the dehydroxylation and collapse of the layered structure, which is
recovered upon submerging this calcined product in a solution of the de-
sired
guest.
Similarly,
the
exfoliation–reassembly
method
can
be
used,343–347 whereby the LM is delaminated and allowed to reassemble in a
solution of the guest species. Co-precipitation and reconstruction methods
also allow for intercalation of species which are not ionic, which is not
possible to achieve using ion exchange. The exfoliation–reassembly ap-
proach is favoured where the guest species’ size prohibits eﬃcient diﬀusion
into the LM interlayer gallery.
2.4.5
Cytotoxicity
LDHs are well known to be highly biocompatible. There have been many
reports of in vitro studies describing very low cytotoxicity of LDH formu-
lations in a wide range of human and murine cell lines, including healthy,
cancerous, and stem cells.348–354 Figure 2.36A shows the results from one
such study, in which four diﬀerent human cell lines were exposed to Mg–Al
LDH for 72 hours. In all treatment groups no significant cytotoxicity was
observed.348 In a study on rats, tablets containing Mg–Al and Zn–Al LDH
particles were implanted into the abdominal muscles and assessed after 7

73

and 28 days. At both time points, no signs of inflammation or micro-
vasculature disruption were present (Figure 2.36B), irrespective of LDH
composition.355 Additionally, the nature of tissue repair around the im-
planted tablets was consistent with that observed around highly bio-
compatible implants. Another study, in which Mg–Al LDH was used as a
coating for middle-ear prostheses in rabbits,356 also found no signs of in-
flammation 10 days following implantation. A clinical study on humans was
performed on fluoride loaded LDH films for dental applications,357 and
found no evidence of irritation after several hours of exposure.
On the other hand, there also exist multiple reports concerning the ad-
juvanticity of LDHs. Briefly, adjuvants are substances which enhance the
immunological response of an organism when exposed to an antigen,358 and
are widely used in vaccine formulations. There are many studies discussing
the adjuvant activity of Mg–Al LDHs,358–363 indicating that LDHs have the
capacity to interact with the immune system – an important consideration
when evaluating the cytotoxicity of such systems. It has also been demon-
strated that the chemical composition and physical properties of LDHs have
an influence on adjuvanticity,364,365 providing a pathway to modulate this
response as required for applications in drug delivery. This will be covered in
more detail in Chapter 6.
Several studies on LRHs have found very high biocompatibility in cell cul-
ture studies, and in some cases showed an apparent increase in cell viability
relative to untreated control cells.272,286,366,367 HDSs are assumed to be bio-
compatible,274 particularly those based on metals which are not toxic in their
free ion form, though no dedicated cytotoxicity studies have been carried out
to date. Cationic clays have shown generally good biocompatibility with evi-
dence of some inhibitory eﬀects on cell proliferation in vitro;368–370 in vivo
studies in mice did not find any ill eﬀects at concentrations of 1000 mg
montmorillonite per kg body mass, much higher than what would typically be
required for biological applications (100 mg per kg body mass).368
In vitro experiments on TMDs appear to show good biocompatibility,
though there are some conflicting studies which report TMDs causing re-
duced viability by cell membrane disruption.371–374 Cytotoxicity appears to
be greatly influenced by the composition of the TMD.375 In vivo tests, in
which mice received injections of polyethylene glycol (PEG) functionalised
MS2, TiS2, and WS2 particles,374 did not reveal cytotoxic eﬀects over the
course of 60 days, and subsequent histology on major organs did not show
any signs of inflammation. In another study, dressings containing MoSe2
were tested on mice with infected wounds,376 with no reported ill eﬀects and
improved would healing. It has also been shown that MoS2 can be degraded
by human myeloperoxidase enzymes,377 which could help to prevent issues
arising from accumulation.
A variety of in vivo studies have been conducted on several graphene-based
materials. Graphene nanosheets surface-functionalised with PEG have been
shown to exhibit no toxic eﬀects in mice, as assessed by histological and
blood analyses.378,379 Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, on the other hand,
74
Chapter 2

have been shown to cause lung injury and inflammation in mice. This was
shown to be the case for GO nanosheets with an average size of 158 nm,380 as
well as a formulation of GO sheets with a size range of 10–800 nm.381
However, this toxicity was not observed in mice that received injections of
graphene oxide formulated as quantum dots (3–5 nm diameter).382 These
findings were mirrored in another study, comparing the in vivo toxicity of
graphene oxide nanosheets and quantum dots (20–40 nm diameter) in
zebrafish.383 Similarly, MXenes are known to be highly biocompatible.384–386
In an in vivo study, mice received intravenous injections of a suspension of
titanium carbide MXene nanosheets.387 After 30 days, histological studies on
the major organs revealed no damage, and toxicological assessment showed
no significant diﬀerence from untreated mice.387
Metal phosphate materials are also highly biocompatible,388 and calcium
phosphate is a commonly used material for orthopaedic surgeries and
dentistry.389,390 Similarly, metal titanates have been demonstrated to cause
no inflammation following implantation in rabbits and dogs.391,392 Overall,
most layered materials appear to have good biocompatibility and are
therefore suitable for drug delivery applications.
2.4.6
Drug Delivery
The concept of drug delivery from LMs is illustrated in Figure 2.37. Briefly,
the introduction of a drug-loaded LM formulation into the physiological
environment leads to the release of the therapeutic cargo via a process of ion
exchange. More specifically, drug anions diﬀuse out of the matrix of the LM
following the concentration gradient, and are replaced by physiological an-
ions (such as chloride, hydrogen phosphate, or hydrogen carbonate). This
process can occur either intracellularly or extracellularly, depending on
cellular uptake properties specific to the formulation used.

2.4.6.1
General Examples
A wide variety of LDH-therapeutic intercalates have been reported in the
literature to date, with guest species including antibacterial and antifungal
compounds,270,355,393–395 anticancer drugs,271,396–403 bone regenerants,404–406
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),407–409 vitamins,410,411 oligo-
nucleotide sequences,400,412 and others.345,410,413–415 Some examples of these
systems are summarised in Table 2.3.
Though the literature around LDH–drug delivery includes multiple types
of formulations, including long-acting implants, injectables, and inhalable
powders, a significant portion of work focuses on the oral delivery route. It
is widely accepted that LDH materials are unstable to degradation in acidic
media as the hydroxyl links are readily hydrolysed, therefore use of an
enteric coating is required where delivery further along the gastrointestinal
tract is desirable. This is the case, for example, where the encapsulated
cargo is itself unstable to the acidic environment in the stomach. In recent
work, Mg–Al LDH was loaded with protein antigens, and subsequently
coated with chitosan and alginate (a pH responsive polymer).416 The re-
sults of dissolution experiments indicated that this system eﬀectively
protected the antigens from degradation in simulated stomach acid at
pH ¼ 1.5.416
It is possible to modulate the drug release behaviour of LDHs. In one
study, rats with cranial bone defects received implants of polymer plates
containing Zn–Al LDH loaded with risedronate (a bone regenerative drug).404
Owing to the protective nature of the polymer, exceptionally slow drug re-
lease was demonstrated (o10% of drug cargo released after 42 days),404
which is favourable for bone regeneration applications as bone tissue grows
very slowly. It was found that after 12 weeks, new bone tissue growth was
significantly enhanced in rats which received implants containing LDH–
risedronate complex compared with those which received polymer only or
unloaded LDH implants.404 Additionally, studies on Zn–Al LDH systems
made by co-precipitation revealed that the identity of the initial counterion
present in the LDH system seems to have a profound eﬀect on the drug
loading and drug release behaviour of the LDH. It was shown that LDH
precursors containing nitrate anions released only 30–40% of their simvas-
tatin drug cargo within 60 h, compared with 80–90% for carbonate-
containing LDH.406
Another challenge in drug delivery that has been addressed using LDHs is
chemotherapy during early pregnancy. Chemotherapeutic treatment of
cancer during the early stages of pregnancy is very challenging, as it has been
shown to greatly increase the chances of miscarriage, deformities, and
death.417 In a recent study, it was shown that pregnant mice receiving in-
jections of Mg–Al LDH loaded with the anticancer drug etoposide (also
known as VP16) showed drastically reduced rates of foetal toxicity and

LDH was found to enhance the anti-tumour eﬀect of etoposide relative to
its free form, and decrease the associated oﬀ-target toxicity on the liver.403
Together, these findings indicate that there is significant merit to con-
tinued exploration of LDH-based delivery systems for chemotherapeutic
delivery.
Thus far, HDS systems have not been explored frequently for drug delivery
applications in the literature. However, a number of drug-intercalate systems
based on the HDS matrix have been reported, including vitamins A and
C,418,419 coumaric acid,420 indole-3-acetic acid,421 and several NSAIDs.275,422
It was shown that drug release from HDS matrices is slower relative to LDH
systems due to stronger guest–host interactions,421 and that it is possible to
modify the drug release profile by surface coating the HDS particles.418,422
Several studies exist on the use of LRHs for drug delivery applications.
Layered gadolinium hydroxide (Gd–LRH) is a particularly attractive LRH
system, because the inclusion of the gadolinium ion in the matrix allows
these materials to exhibit strong magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) con-
trast. Many other rare-earth elements exhibit strong fluorescence and can be
used as contrast agents for fluorescence imaging, giving LRHs theranostic
(simultaneous therapeutic and diagnostic) applications. Intercalation com-
pounds of Gd–LRH with three NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen)
have been reported.272 It was found that both the parent material and
intercalates exhibited good MRI contrast (Figure 2.39A), and were able to
release their drug cargo over 1–24 hours with the rate of drug release varying
depending on guest species (Figure 2.39B).272 It was also found that Gd–LRH
was not stable in acidic media (pH ¼ 1.5),272 a property which could poten-
tially be exploited for intratumoural delivery due to the acidic micro-
environment of tumours.

Mixed rare-earth element LRHs have also been reported, including
Gd–LRH doped with europium.423 When intercalated with the amino acids
phenylalanine
and
tyrosine,
it
was
shown
that
the
fluorescence
signal arising from Eu31 was dampened, which could be useful for sensing
applications.423 Conversely, if the signal was seen to change upon the re-
lease of the guest compound, it may be possible to use the change in
fluorescence intensity to track drug release. Other reported LRH systems
include Eu–LRH intercalated with naproxen, and Tb–LRH loaded with as-
pirin, diclofenac, and indomethacin.273,308,367 Intercalation with naproxen
and aspirin was shown to cause an increase in the fluorescence intensity of
Eu–LRH and Tb–LRH, and rapid release within 3 hours,273,308 whereas
diclofenac and indomethacin were released from Tb–LRH over 24 hours
with no reported change in fluorescence properties.367
Montmorillonite (MMT), a cationic clay with a smectite structure, is a
relatively commonly used excipient in medicines.424,425 Many intercalation
compounds of MMT and drug molecules have been studied. For instance, a
study using promethazine and buformin259 revealed that the drug release
behaviour from MMT intercalates is dependent on the guest molecule size.
Promethazine is a bulky polycyclic compound, whereas buformin is small
and linear (Figure 2.40). The drug release profile from the intercalates was
slower relative to the pure drug equivalent in both cases, but after 6 hours
the promethazine–MMT intercalate reached only 30% cumulative drug re-
lease, compared with 70% for the much smaller buformin.259 In another
study, timolol intercalation and release from montmorillonite was investi-
gated. The formulation exhibited sustained drug release with some pH de-
pendence, reaching slightly higher cumulative drug release after 9 hours at
pH 8.4 than at pH 1.2 (48% vs. 43%).260
Another example is the use of montmorillonite to intercalate buspirone.426
The intercalate showed a sustained release profile, reaching approximately
54% release after 12 hours.426 In addition, the release profile could be al-
tered by coating the particles with a polymer, which reduced the extent of
release to only 23% release after 12 hours.426 A further potential application
of montmorillonite in drug delivery is taste masking. The intercalation of
sildenafil427 into the clay matrix protects the drug from immediate dis-
solution in the saliva, therefore enabling taste masking. In addition, the
intercalate was coated with an acid-soluble polymer, enabling protection

from release in the oral environment, but rapid drug release in the acidic
stomach environment.427 Kaolinite, a naturally occurring smectite material,
has also appeared in the literature in the context of drug delivery. It has been
loaded with a variety of therapeutics including anticancer drugs,428–432 and
antibacterials.433,434
Materials based on graphene and graphene oxide (GO) have been widely
studied as potential drug delivery systems. For instance, GO coated with
chitosan and co-loaded with two anticancer drugs435 was shown to exhibit a
synergistic tumour-inhibiting eﬀect in rats, as well as delayed and controlled
release relative to the free drugs. Graphene and GO materials are also known
to exhibit eﬃcient photothermal conversion, and there exist multiple ex-
amples of multifunctional systems based on graphene. In one such study, GO
was surface functionalised with hyaluronic acid (a cancer cell targeting ligand)
and loaded with doxorubicin (DOX).436 This platform was shown to exhibit
enhanced drug release rate in response to irradiation with near infrared light
as well as to a change in redox conditions (upon entry into cells), and displayed
powerful tumour inhibition in mice.436 In another example, fluorinated GO
nanosheets were decorated with folic acid (also a cancer cell targeting ligand),
and loaded with DOX.437 The formulation exhibited high cytotoxicity due to
the synergistic eﬀect of combined chemotherapy and phototherapy and the
presence of fluorine allowed for potential fluorescence imaging applications.
Other LMs which occasionally appear in the literature in the context of
drug delivery include layered metal phosphates and titanates. Several zir-
conium phosphate drug intercalates have been reported,438–441 including
a study investigating the potential of the material as a carrier for orally
delivered insulin.442 Sodium titanates have also been explored for drug
delivery applications, most notably in a series of works which used titanate
nanofibers and nanospheres to deliver cerebrolysin (a neuroprotective
agent) to rats and mice,443,444 finding an enhanced neuroprotective eﬀect
relative to conventionally administered cerebrolysin. Iron titanate has been
intercalated with an enzyme, and showed magnetic properties suitable for
targeting applications applying an external magnetic field.347
2.4.6.2
Targeted Drug Delivery
As for MOFs and MSNs, LMs can be targeted both passively (EPR eﬀect) and
actively. A common type of active targeting involves surface functionali-
sation of layered materials with species which bind preferentially to target
cells. For example, in an in vivo study on rabbits, a Mg–Al LDH system
intercalated with heparin was successfully targeted to arterial injury sites
by conjugating antibodies to the particles.445 In another work, Mg–Al LDH
particles coated with folic acid were shown to preferentially target cells
which overexpress folate receptors.446 Such overexpression is fairly com-
mon in cancerous cells, for instance in breast, lung, and ovarian can-
cers.447,448 Intercalation of folic acid decorated particles with methotrexate
revealed that the drug was delivered preferentially to the target cells.446,449
Inorganic Materials in Drug Delivery
81

A related study extended this concept to DOX loaded Mg–Al LDH
nanosheets functionalised with folic acid. The study findings indicated
that cellular uptake was highly selective for cells which overexpress the
folate receptor gene, and the cytotoxic eﬀect of DOX was thereby eﬀectively
targeted to these cells.450
This strategy has further been employed in targeting other layered drug
delivery systems to cancer cells. For instance, graphene or GO systems have
been conjugated to cancer-targeting ligands including arginylglycylaspartic
acid,451 biotin,452 folic acid,453–456 and antibodies.291,457–459 In one example,
a glycyrrhetinic acid ligand was used to preferentially target DOX-loaded GO
to the mitochondria of cancerous cells,460 leading to eﬃcient tumour in-
hibition in mice. In a study on mice that had received paclitaxel loaded and
hyaluronic acid functionalised zirconium phosphate,461 it was demonstrated
that the system could eﬃciently target cancer cells and led to a significant
decrease in tumour volume relative to free paclitaxel.461
Chitosan–LDH complexes have been explored for ocular drug delivery on a
number of occasions.462,463 In vivo studies on rabbits revealed that amino
acid functionalised chitosan derivatives are able to target a peptide present
on the ocular surface, and thereby increase the corneal permeation of drug-
loaded LDH systems. Moreover, the bioavailability of pirenoxine intercalated
within the LDH was increased to five times that of the commercially avail-
able counterpart.462
Another active targeting strategy is magnetic targeting, which requires the
inclusion of a magnetic species (most commonly iron oxide) in the drug
delivery system. Targeting is then achieved by the application of an external
magnetic field. Composite materials of iron oxide with LDH464 or graphene
oxide,465 as well as inherently magnetic LMs such as iron titanate347 have all
shown the ability to be physically targeted using an external magnetic field.
This has been demonstrated in vivo, for instance where a graphene–iron
oxide composite loaded with a radiosensitiser drug was intravenously ad-
ministered to mice.466 After 1 h of exposure to an external magnetic field set
up to target the tumour region, the formulation was shown to have accu-
mulated within the tumour tissue (Figure 2.41).466
Recently, in vivo tests of surface-functionalised LDH systems performed on
mice indicated that particles with a negative surface charge are rapidly
cleared from the body via the liver, those with a positive surface charge
seemed to accumulate preferentially in the lungs, and particles with a
neutral surface showed enhanced circulation time and minimal accumu-
lation in organ tissues.467 These results indicate that surface functionalisa-
tion with charged moieties has a great influence on biodistribution, and
therefore provides another viable route to targeting.
2.4.6.3
Stimuli-responsive Release
Systems which are responsive to changes in pH are particularly useful for drug
delivery to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (due to the highly acidic medium in
82
Chapter 2

the stomach, which gradually gets neutralised by bile along the rest of the GI
tract), as well as tumours, which often exhibit an acidic microenvironment
relative to the surrounding healthy tissues. Metal hydroxide LMs (LDHs,
LRHs, HDSs) are all unstable with respect to dissolution in acidic media,468
and therefore may release their drug cargo faster under such conditions. For
instance, a composite system of iron oxide and Mg–Al LDH loaded with
methotrexate464 was shown to release over 80% of the drug cargo in under
10 hours at pH 3.5, whereas only 25% release occurred over the same time at
pH 7.4.464 On the other hand, a conflicting report found that the release of
fluvastatin drugs from Mg–Al LDH at pH 4.5 was negligible compared with
release at pH 7.4.469 Another study, using naproxen loaded HDS systems
formulated as tablets detected negligible drug release during the course of two
hours at pH 1, with rapid release occurring upon adjustment of pH to 6.8.274 It
is therefore unclear clear how metal hydroxide LM stability in acid may be
aﬀected through composition, guest identity, or formulation.
This property can, however, be modified by surface coating. A Mg–Al LDH
system intercalated with ibuprofen and coated with carboxymethyl cellulose
(a pH responsive polymer) was investigated for controlled drug release in the
digestive tract.470 At low pH in the stomach environment, the polymer pro-
tects the LDH–drug intercalate from degradation and slows drug release. As
the formulation passes further through the digestive tract, and pH rises in
the intestinal environment, the polymer swells and allows drug release to
occur.470 Similar results were demonstrated in a follow-up study using the
antibiotic cephalexin in place of ibuprofen.471 There are many other ex-
amples of pH responsive drug release from LMs which are uncoated,441,472
coated,473–476 or otherwise functionalised.264,477,478
Electro-responsive drug release behaviour from LM systems has also been
described in the literature. For instance, a GO and conductive polymer
composite479 has been reported, from which the release of adsorbed dex-
amethasone was triggered by applying a voltage. No release occurred without
external triggering, and the magnitude of the applied voltage was shown to

have a direct relationship with the rate of drug release.479 Similarly, a study
on an MMT–chitosan hydrogel reported changes in the release profile of
vitamin B12 in response to electrical stimulation.480
MoS2 nanosheets conjugated to cationic polymers were used to adsorb
DNA fragments and deliver genes to both human and murine cancer
cells.481 It was shown that, after endosomal uptake of the platform into
cells, release from the endosomes into the cytoplasm can be triggered
photothermally.
Moreover,
the
polymers
desorbed
from
the
MoS2
nanosheets only in the presence of glutathione (an intracellular anti-
oxidant present in abundance in cancer cells), ensuring the DNA fragments
are only released at the target site.481 Another study reported greatly en-
hanced photothermal activity of MoS2 when surface functionalised with
CuS.482 When loaded with DOX, this platform also exhibited pH and
photothermally responsive drug release.482
2.4.6.4
Composite Materials and Combined Therapies
Composite materials can exhibit additional functionalities and superior per-
formance
to
simple
LM
systems.
This
allows
for
the
simultaneous
administration of multiple therapies (chemo-, photothermal, and photo-
dynamic) to create a powerful, synergistic formulation. A notable example
of such a system is a Mg–Fe LDH doped with copper, and loaded with
5-fluorouracil.483 In this instance, doping leads to coordinative unsaturation
within the matrix, allowing the LDH to act as a charge carrier483 and eﬃciently
convert NIR light to heat. The powerful combination of this photothermal ef-
fect with pH sensitive drug release in the acidic tumour environment led to
completetumourelimination inmice (Figure2.42A).483 Moreover, the presence
of paramagnetic iron ions within the LDH allows the system to act as a contrast
agent in magnetic resonance imaging (Figure 2.42B), enabling image-guided
delivery and subsequent monitoring of the tumour site. Such theranostic sys-
tems are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
Alternatively, a photosensitiser can be intercalated into a LM to provide
photothermal or photodynamic functionality. Photodynamic therapy in-
volves electron transfer from a photosensitiser to oxygen, producing cyto-
toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and leading to cell death. For instance, a
Zn–Al LDH was loaded with isophthalic acid (IPA), a photosensitiser which
has the unique ability to absorb two near-infrared photons per molecule.398
As such, IPA has a very high yield of ROS and therefore outperforms other
reported photosensitisers. It was shown that mice that had received in-
jections of LDH–IPA and subsequently been irradiated with near-infrared
light had a significant decrease in tumour volume in all cases, and complete
tumour elimination in several cases (Figure 2.43).398
Some LMs are inherently able to act as photosensitisers. Several studies
have shown how eﬀective MXenes can be as photothermal agents. A Ta4C3
and iron oxide composite showed very eﬃcient photothermal conversion,
leading to complete tumour elimination in mice without the need for

chemotherapy.484 Similarly, Nb2C and Ti3C2 were shown to lead to complete
tumour elimination in mice following NIR irradiation.485,486 It was also
found that Nb2C is biodegradable in the presence of the human myeloper-
oxidase enzyme,485 which is an important consideration when evaluating the
safety of injectable formulations.
The photothermal activity of MXenes in combination with drug delivery
can therefore result in potent treatments for more complicated or aggressive
cancers. A notable example of such a MXene based drug delivery platform is
that of Ti3C2 loaded with DOX and decorated with cancer-targeting
hyaluronic acid (HA).294 In addition to acting as a pH responsive drug car-
rier, this platform was shown to be able to act as a photosensitiser for both
photothermal and photodynamic therapy.294 In mice, the nanosheets were
shown to preferentially accumulate in tumours and led to complete tumour
elimination after irradiation with NIR light.294 In similar work, a composite
of Ti3C2 and cellulose loaded with DOX was shown to exhibit NIR triggered
drug release and photothermal activity (Figure 2.44A),487 which together led
to tumour elimination with no relapse (Figure 2.44B, C).
Other LM systems reported to be photothermally active include a GO and
iron oxide composite465 loaded with DOX and coated with PEG, which was

shown to be capable of acting as a photothermal sensitiser for thermal ab-
lation, as well as exhibiting good contrast in magnetic resonance imaging
in vivo.465 In another study, a composite including iron oxide, GO, and several
polysaccharides loaded with DOX was shown to exhibit significant anti-tumour
activity through the combination of chemotherapy and thermal ablation.488

Summary and Outlook
In summary, inorganic layered materials hold great potential as drug delivery
vehicles, and have been the subject of many noteworthy works in the literature.
LMs are tremendously versatile in terms of their composition, physical prop-
erties, and chemical properties, and are therefore highly customisable. Their
rich intercalation chemistry allows them to host a variety of therapeutic and
functional guest species, and it is also possible to achieve additional features –
such as eﬀective targeting – through surface functionalisation. Moreover, the
majority of inorganic LMs so far explored in biomedical applications have
demonstrated exceptionally high biocompatibility, and in many cases im-
pressive performance in vivo. It is therefore unsurprising that LMs are receiving
increasing amounts of attention from the scientific community, and will cer-
tainly play a part in the ongoing eﬀorts to develop personalised medicines.

Metallic Nanoparticles
2.5.1
Introduction
Metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) are nanoscale materials made entirely of ei-
ther a pure metal, such as silver or gold, or compounds of a metal, such as
oxides, chlorides, or hydroxides.489 There have been many attempts to use
MNPs as drug delivery vehicles due to their versatile properties, including
magnetism, localised surface plasmon resonance, antimicrobial activity,
relative ease of synthesis, and ease of functionalisation. Typically, drugs are
bound to the surface of such nanoparticles, to enhance distribution and
intracellular delivery, and combined both with intrinsic properties of the
nanoparticles and/or further functionalisation to give desirable properties,
such as targeting. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), gold nanoparticles
(AuNPs), and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are all popular within the litera-
ture for use as drug delivery systems, most probably due to the simplicity of
synthesis and other inherent properties that make them multipurpose. This
section will give an overview of the diﬀerent ways in which MNPs can be
applied to drug delivery and combination therapies, with selected examples
from the above three classes of MNPs used to underpin diﬀerent concepts.
2.5.2
Synthesis and Properties
There are a number of methods that can be used in the synthesis of IONPs,
including thermal decomposition, electron beam lithography, and bacteria
Inorganic Materials in Drug Delivery
87

mediated syntheses, with each summarised in detail by Ali et al.490 The
synthesis method used depends on which type of IONP is required.491 There
are a number of diﬀerent forms of IONPs, with the most common being
maghemite (g-Fe2O3), magnetite (Fe3O4), and hematite (a-Fe2O3), all of
which are categorised as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
(SPIONs).492 The most commonly used synthesis procedure is coprecipita-
tion, in which a base is added to an aqueous mixture of Fe21 and Fe31 ions
under nitrogen to obtain Fe3O4 nanoparticles.493 The magnetic properties of
the latter render them particularly useful for in vivo applications.492
For AuNPs, polymer-mediated, photochemical, ultrasound-assisted, and
laser ablation syntheses have all been reported and are discussed in detail
within a review by Sengani et al.494 The most widely used synthesis method
to generate AuNPs is reduction, and an overview by Daruich De Souza et al.
provides good insight into the diﬀerent reduction methods utilised.495 In
general, a reducing agent, such as citric acid or sodium borohydride, allows
Au31 to gain electrons, reducing to Au0, and a stabilising agent is used to
reduce aggregation through surface conjugation and passivation. Diﬀerent
synthesis methods allow for the formation of a number of shapes and sizes
of AuNP, with some of the shapes seen within the literature including stars,
triangles, rods,496 and hexagons,497 as well as the more commonly used
spheres.498–500 The synthesis of AgNPs can also be performed using a
number of diﬀerent techniques, such as laser ablation, microemulsion, and
evaporation–condensation, with a review article by Beyene et al. summar-
ising these.501 Chemical reduction is one of the most popular synthesis
methods used within the literature. One potent route to control the size of
the nanoparticles is the co-reduction method, involving the use of sodium
borohydride and trisodium citrate. An example of this can be found in a
report from Agnihotri et al., in which the procedure was implemented to
develop AgNPs of diﬀerent sizes using diﬀerent ratios of sodium borohy-
dride and trisodium citrate.502
Whilst drug delivery from these varied MNPs typically comes from at-
tachment to their surfaces, they also have varied properties that make them
popular for use as integrated drug delivery agents. The inherent magnetic
properties of IONPs allow them to be tracked with ease using MRI.503
Magnetite and maghemite are ferrimagnetic, where there is a net spon-
taneous magnetic moment generated by the diﬀerent magnitudes of mag-
netic moments within the materials.491 This means that within a magnetic
field, they behave similarly to ferromagnetic materials, and can be applied,
for example, in targeted drug delivery with simultaneous magnetic reson-
ance imaging (Figure 2.45). Because of this, they have also found appli-
cations in magnetic targeting,504 as well as photothermal agents converting
NIR laser irradiation to heat.505
Both AgNPs and AuNPs have a property known as localised surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR). This means that free electrons are able to interact with
light, causing collective oscillations known as surface plasmons. These sur-
face plasmons result in peaks within extinction spectra whenever they are
88

excited by light of a specific wavelength, called the resonance frequency
(Figure 2.46).507,508 This allows these nanoparticles to be used for a number of
applications, including thermally triggered drug release,509 photodynamic
therapy (PDT),510 photothermal therapy (PTT),510–512 imaging, and sensing.511
In addition to these properties, MNPs are often seen to have their own
clinical eﬀects. For example, AuNPs have shown some cancer sensitising
ability, and the use of these MNPs alongside an anticancer drug increases
the eﬃcacy of the drug. This is especially important in resistant cell lines.514
Huai et al. found that AuNPs alone were able to reduce the colony formation
and inhibit migration of the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell lines
PANC-1 and Mia-PaCa-2, both in 2D and 3D assays, though were less suc-
cessful in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell line AsPC-1.514 Further
work revealed that AuNPs administered before the anticancer drug gemci-
tabine were able to sensitise all cell types, increasing the cytotoxicity of
gemcitabine to these resistant cell lines.
AgNPs have a similar eﬀect, with a study by Yuan et al. revealing that
AgNPs were able to sensitise the ovarian cancer cell line A2780 to gemcita-
bine.515 Increasing the concentration of AgNPs whilst keeping the concen-
tration of gemcitabine constant was observed to correlate with a reduction in
cell viability. AgNPs are also well known to have anticancer activity of their
own, which has been seen in a number of cell lines, including the human
lung cancer cell line A549,516 human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7517 and
MDA-MB-231,518 and the human colon cancer cell line HCT116.519 AgNPs

additionally have antimicrobial activity, with evidence of eﬃcacy against
viruses,520–522 protozoa,523,524 fungi,525–527 and bacteria.502,528 Furthermore,

Cytotoxicity and Biocompatibility
There is a plethora of research into the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of
MNPs within the literature, most probably due to ailments associated with
metal build up within the body.
For IONPs, there are a number of studies that have investigated the po-
tential toxicity of uncoated nanoparticles, with work in vitro and in vivo. One
notable example of this is a study by Hanini et al. in which uncoated IONPs
were studied for their potential toxicity.532 In vitro, there was evidence of
IONP internalisation within human endothelial (HUVEC) cells within a few
hours, but no eﬀect on the viability of the cells after 24 hours. However, there
was a significant detrimental eﬀect on cell viability at both 48 and 72 hours,
most probably as a result of oxidative stress and necrosis. In vivo, when
Wistar rats received injections of IONPs intravenously, 60% of the IONPs
were seen to remain within the blood after 24 hours, but only 25% remained
in the blood after 72 hours. There was evidence of clearance through urine
(Figure 2.47A and B). The general health of the animals appeared unchanged
for the duration of the experiments, and no negative eﬀects were seen on the
weights of the animals (Figure 2.47C). The number of white blood cells in-
creased by 50%, but the red blood cell count remained consistent with that
of the controls (Figure 2.47D). The IONPs were seen to cause some damage
to the kidney, liver, and lungs through inflammation, but no eﬀects on the
heart and brain were seen within the time scale used (Figure 2.47E). Overall,
the rapid clearance of the nanoparticles indicated to the researchers that the
damage over an extended period of time would be minimal.
Sadeghi et al. have also looked into the potential toxicity of IONPs533 to
HepG2 human hepatoma cells at concentrations in the range of 25 to
100 mg ml1. As the concentration increased, there was a clear decrease in
cell viability, with the toxicity at 24 hours seen to be greater than that at
12 hours. Furthermore, there was a dose- and time-dependent eﬀect on re-
active oxygen species (ROS) production, glutathione (GSH) production, and
DNA damage.
The addition of a surface coating onto IONPs has been generally associ-
ated with reduced toxicity. Jain et al. were able to test the biocompatibility, as
well as clearance and biodistribution, of oleic acid–pluronic coated IONPs
in vivo using Sprague–Dawley rats.534 The injected IONPs were seen to cause
some oxidative stress and changes in the levels of liver enzymes, but these
eﬀects were short term. It was suggested that the levels of IONPs accumu-
lated within some organs, such as the liver, heart, spleen, and brain, would
be low enough to not cause toxicity, but further research would be required
to prove this. Further analysis determined that 55% of the iron injected
accumulated in the liver at 6 hours, which is expected as the liver acts to
clear excess materials out of the body. This was reduced to 20% after a day.

In another study, Hachani et al. generated water dispersible IONPs using
a polyol synthesis, and modified the surface of these materials with
3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic acid (DHCA) or tartaric acid (TA).535 The coated
IONPs had no significant eﬀect on the viability of human mesenchymal stem
cells (hMSCs) at up to 500 mg ml1, but both were seen to have a significant
eﬀect on cell viability at 1 mg ml1 (Figure 2.48).
In
another
study,
chitosan-coated
IONPs
were
tested
for
their
biocompatibility with osteoblast cells.536 Naked IONPs were taken up into
osteoblasts more eﬀectively than the coated IONPs, and there was observed
to be increased cellular proliferation after both 3 and 6 days coculture with
100 mg ml1 of coated IONPs. After 48 h, the coated IONPs led to no sig-
nificant diﬀerence in cell viability at any of the concentrations studied
(20–300 mg ml1). With the naked IONPs, however, there was a significant
decrease in cell viability of osteoblasts when the concentration was in-
creased. At 100 and 300 mg ml1, the naked IONPs caused a lower cellular
viability than chitosan coated IONPs at the same concentrations. Another
report by Na et al. described the eﬀects of coated IONPs with diﬀerent types
of ligands based on a short poly(acrylic acid) backbone with side attach-
ments of polyethylene glycol (PEG) groups and catechol and carboxylic acid
groups.537 Generally, the coated IONPs were seen to have minimal eﬀects on
cellular viability in the range of 0.025 and 2 mM.
The potential toxicity of AuNPs has also been investigated both in vitro and
in vivo. Chen et al. looked into the distribution and inflammatory eﬀects of
spherical AuNPs in mice.538 There were no noticeable changes in the mass of
most organs and body weight between the control and AuNP-treated mice
during the 72 hour study period, but a notable fat loss was seen in the mice
treated with AuNPs at 72 hours. There was also inhibition in the expression
of proinflammatory cytokines within the fat of the abdominal tissue. Bailly
et al. tested the biodistribution, safety, and pharmacokinetics of dextran
coated AuNPs in vivo.539 It was confirmed that there was no eﬀect of AuNPs

on the health of the mice, based both on their behaviour and there being no
evidence of acute or chronic toxicity in the liver, spleen, and kidneys.
However, there was no decrease in the gold content in the liver and spleen
after 7 and 14 days, indicating diﬃculty in clearing AuNPs from the body
(Figure 2.49A and B). There was also evidence of some accumulation in the
kidney, heart, lungs, and brain (Figure 2.49C). Histological tissue examin-
ations and biochemical parameter analysis did not indicate any toxicity
arising from this accumulation.
There is some evidence of AuNP toxicity, but this is often attributed to
surface coatings, as in a report by Demir Duman et al.540 Here, Au nanorods
were synthesised with the commonly used cationic surfactant cetyl-
trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and were seen to cause toxicity to
A431 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells even at low doses. When the

Chapter 2

nanorods were then coated with an anionic polymer, polyacrylic acid, there
was a significant reduction in cytotoxicity, indicating that the CTAB was the
primary cause of the toxicity seen.
There has been a great deal of research into the biocompatibility of AgNPs.
One study aimed to test the cytotoxic and genotoxic eﬀects of a commercial
preparation of AgNPs, known as Argovit, on human cervix and breast cancer
cell lines.541 After 12 and 24 hours, there was both a time- and dose-
dependent eﬀect on the cell lines, with Argovit seen to be toxic to all cell
lines at a dose of 20 mg ml1. There were also some toxic eﬀects seen at
10 mg ml1, with all cell lines seen to have a cell viability below 50%. ROS
production increased when the concentration of AgNPs was above 5 mg ml1.
AshaRani et al. used normal human lung fibroblast cells (IMR-90) and
human glioblastoma cells (U251) to determine the toxicity of starch-coated
silver nanoparticles.542 The cell morphology after exposure to 200 mg ml1 of
AgNPs indicated that the cells were unhealthy. An ATP assay was indicative
of a time- and concentration-dependent eﬀect of AgNPs, with increasing
time and concentration linked to a decrease in ATP levels (Figure 2.50A).
Both starch (Figure 2.50B) and the supernatant (Figure 2.50C) were also
tested, with no cytotoxic eﬀect seen over 72 hours. There was also evidence
for a decrease in mitochondrial activity (Figure 2.50D). A small number of
cells were seen to undergo apoptosis at higher AgNPs concentrations,
thought to be related to ROS production.
Pauksch et al. investigated the biocompatibility of AgNPs in osteoblasts
(OB) and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).543 The AgNPs used here
were stabilised in a 10% matrix of 4% polyoxyethylene glycerol trioelate
(PGT) and 4% poyloxyethylene sorbitan mololaurate (Tween 20). The cyto-
toxicity of AgNPs, the matrix, silver sulfate, and silver nitrate were measured.
All silver samples had a time-dependent eﬀect on cell viability, with some
reductions in cell viability seen at longer incubation times. AgNPs were
generally noted to be less toxic than solutions of Ag salts.
Overall, the results from the toxicity tests are generally favourable but do
highlight concerns when high concentrations are used, and also flag risks of
possible accumulation in vivo. Lower dosages seem to be well tolerated, and
mitigation through careful choice of surface ligands is recommended, but
again care must be taken as these can also cause deleterious eﬀects,
meaning that careful control of synthetic conditions is also vital to ensure
good biocompatibility.
2.5.4
Drug Delivery and Targeting
A range of MNPs have been studied for drug delivery, both actively and
passively targeted (Table 2.4). For instance, glycerol monooleate (GMO)
coated IONPs have been used for targeted chemotherapy.544 The drugs ra-
pamycin and paclitaxel were loaded both individually and in combination
onto the GMO–IONPs. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) antibody was subsequently conjugated onto the surface of the
Inorganic Materials in Drug Delivery

GMO–IONPs to allow for targeting, since HER2 is often overexpressed in
breast cancer cells. The so-called IONP–GMO–HER2 nanoparticles were
taken up by MCF-7 breast cancer cells in greater quantities than those
without the antibody. The targeted NPs were more eﬀective in killing cancer

cells than the non-targeted analogues. The anticancer drug epirubicin has
also been loaded onto IONPs, in this case for transdermal delivery.545 In-
hibition in the melanoma cell line WM266 was seen using the drug loaded
IONPs. Popescu et al. functionalised IONPs with gemcitabine (GEM) for drug
delivery purposes.546 In vitro, it appeared that there was a greater toxic eﬀect
with the GEM@IONP treatment (Figure 2.51). An in vivo study detected no
evidence of accumulation within the heart, brain, lungs, liver, or pancreas at
7 and 14 days after administration. There was, however, evidence of nano-
particles within the spleen at both time intervals.
Farooq et al. used PEG coated AuNPs for dual drug delivery purposes.547
The AuNPs were capped with bleomycin (BLM) and DOX. The dual-drug-
loaded NPs had greater chemotherapeutic eﬃcacy compared with the free
drug, and the nanoparticles with the individual drugs only. In other work,
Prabaharan et al. used AuNPs for the targeted drug delivery of DOX.548 Folate
(FA)-conjugated AuNPs were synthesised with a poly(L-aspartate-doxor-
ubicin)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) monolayer, giving Au-P(LA-DOX)-b-PEG-OH/
FA. The FA functionalisation enhanced the uptake of NPs into murine 4T1
carcinoma cells, and increased cancer cell death could also be achieved.
Dreaden et al. used AuNPs for targeted drug delivery of tamoxifen (TAM)
against breast cancer, via the oestrogen receptor (ER).549 Thiol-pegylated
tamoxifen (TAM–PEG–SH) was conjugated onto the surface of AuNPs. The
TAM conjugation was found to aid uptake into ER-positive MCF-7 cells. IC50

values for the NPs were also much lower than reported values for tamoxifen
and the active metabolite, with similar results observed for the ER-positive
HSC-3 oral cancer cell line.
DOX-loaded AgNPs have also been reported.550 Folic acid modified AgNPs
were taken up eﬃciently by FA receptor-positive HeLa cells, and found to be
potent in inducing the death of cancer cells. Dual delivery of AL and DOX
using AgNPs has additionally been explored, and enhanced cytotoxicity seen

2.5.5
Combining Drug Delivery with Other Techniques
One of the benefits of using MNPs is the potential for multi-purpose drug
delivery systems, which can include multiple therapies or involve the use of
some imaging modalities. Emami et al. conjugated Anti-PD-L1 antibody and
DOX onto the surface of AuNPs for the photochemotherapy of colorectal
cancer, where PD-L1 is upregulated.552 There was significantly greater up-
take of AuNPs into mouse colon adenocarcinoma CT-26 cells when the
antibody was attached, which also allowed for a greater intracellular con-
centration of DOX compared with the free drug, and enhanced cytotoxicity.
Furthermore, when DOX@AuNP-Anti-PD-L1 were co-administered with near
infrared laser irradiation, cell viability was further reduced.
In another example, Sun et al. generated IONPs for tumour targeted drug
delivery.506 The targeting ligand chlorotoxin (CTX) and the chemother-
apeutic methotrexate (MTX) were attached to the surface of the IONPs via a
PEG linker. Greater uptake of IONP–MTX–CTX was seen in cancer cells, to-
gether with elevated cytotoxicity. In vivo experimentation using a 9L xeno-
graft mouse model revealed that the IONP–MTX–CTX treatment was able to
accumulate and be retained within the tumour. Other studies have also used
IONPs for multiple applications, for instance, 64Cu labelling to allow for
imaging via a computerised tomography scan combined with MRI.553 These
possibilities are discussed in more detail in Chapter 4.
There has also been interest in the application of MNPs in PDT. One ex-
ample of this is the conjugation of the photosensitiser 5-aminolevulinic acid
(5-ALA) onto the surface of AuNPs.554 5-ALA is a precursor for the PDT drug
protoporphyrin IX, with advantages including low toxicity in the absence of
light, fast conversion to the active form, and rapid clearance from the body.
However, 5-ALA is zwitterionic and hydrophilic, meaning it has poor tissue
and cellular penetration. Cellular uptake and cytotoxic eﬀects were elevated

when 5-ALA was conjugated to AuNPs, and the addition of an antibody
targeting the HER2 receptor could further improve the targeting ability.
There has also been some interest in the use of MNPs for PTT, mostly
using the nanoparticles alone, which is discussed in various review
articles.555–557 For instance, AuNPs coated with polydopamine (PD) and with
anti-EGFR antibodies immobilised onto this layer were used for targeted
photothermal therapy.558 Cells over-expressing EGFR could be eﬀectively
targeted for PTT.
2.5.6
Hybrid Nanoparticles
As well as using MNPs with one metal, there has been great interest in de-
veloping core–shell nanoparticle systems, referred to here as hybrid nano-
particles (HNPs). A range of combinations has been prepared to try to
harness specific properties. The generation of HNPs using gold or silver
shells has been demonstrated in several studies, with these focusing more
on the synthesis rather than any potential biomedical application.559,560
However, there has been some investigation into the use of HNPs for bio-
medical applications, including drug delivery, with most attention on gold
coated IONPs. The combination of two metals can allow additional eﬀects,
such as magnetic targeting, or photothermal therapy.
One of the key examples of this comes from Hoskins et al., who developed
IONPs coated with a gold layer, either in the form of a gold coating or AuNPs,
using polymer layers in between to allow for this attachment by electrostatic
attraction.561 The resulting HNPs generally have minimal cytotoxicity. Fur-
ther investigation demonstrated the heating eﬀect of the HNPs, indicating
possible use for thermal applications. Gold-coated magnetic nanoparticles
have also been used for DOX delivery in vivo.504 A greater accumulation of
the HNPs in the tumour was observed when magnetic targeting was used.
There was a marked reduction in tumour growth for DOX coated nano-
particles with magnetic targeting as compared with untargeted nano-
particles and the control group. Magnetic targeting also ensured that
significantly lower levels of the nanoparticles were found within other tis-
sues and organs.
A series of multi-layered nanoparticle platforms has been developed, with
numerous studies showing the applications of the materials in cancer re-
search (Figure 2.53).509,562–565 An IONP core was coated with both AuNPs and
a gold layer, with each layer separated by a polymer coating, most often
polyethyleneimine. More recent research added bisnaphthalimide-based
anticancer drugs565 and modified gemcitabine509 onto the surface. The
drug-loaded HNPs could increase toxicity to cancerous cells, such as PANC-1
and BxPC-3, while preserving the viability of healthy cells. In vivo evaluation
using immunocompromised nude mice with a BxPC-3 xenograft tumour
revealed significant enhancement of tumour suppression eﬀects when the
bisnaphthalimide-loaded NPs were applied along with laser irradiation, with
similar eﬀects observed for the HNPs loaded with modified gemcitabine.

Summary and Outlook
Metallic nanoparticles have become popular within biomedicine for nu-
merous applications. Though there have been fears over the toxicities of
these materials, generally this only occurs when the nanoparticles are un-
coated or coated with a material with known toxicity to cells. Hence, the
majority of studies overcome this issue using biocompatible coatings, with
many opting for polymers. The main reason for the popularity of MNPs is the
numerous advantageous properties they have, including magnetism (allow-
ing for imaging) and localised surface plasmon resonance (allowing for
photodynamic therapy and thermally triggered drug release). In addition,
there is some evidence for a synergistic eﬀect between MNPs and free drugs,
where cancer cells are able to be killed by anticancer drugs to which they
were previously resistant. Recently there has been an increase in the pro-
duction of hybrid MNPs, combining the properties of both materials used
and therefore a greater range of applications. Finally, in many cases, MNPs
have been combined with other techniques in order to supply a multimodal
drug delivery vehicle, with targeting a particular focus.
2.6
Conclusion
A wide range of inorganic materials can be used for drug delivery. Here, we
have focused on the four families of materials which have attracted most
attention: 3D metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and mesoporous silicas

(MSNs), 2D layered materials, and 0D inorganic nanoparticles (MNPs). The
four classes of inorganic nanomaterials described above encompass a range
of physical properties and chemical functionalities. Each has specific ad-
vantages and disadvantages; for instance, the porous MOFs and MSNs can
oﬀer high drug loadings, while stabilities (and so biological clearance) vary
significantly. MOFs often require functionalisation and protection from
rapid degradation prior to cargo delivery, while MSNs and MNPs can persist
in vivo. All classes oﬀer the capacity for chemical functionalisation through
tailored surface reactivity, and often can also oﬀer concurrent medical im-
aging. In fact, many systems are hybridised, with MOF and MNP chemistry
proving highly compatible. Despite this, none of these systems have yet
found clinical application. Of the few inorganic nanoparticulate systems that
have FDA approval, most are based around iron, for example super-
paramagnetic iron oxides for magnetic resonance imaging.566 Whilst highly
promising, the systems described within this chapter require significant
further study prior to any clinical translation.

Introduction
During recent decades, progress in science and technology has led to the
introduction of many novel non-invasive imaging modalities, such as X-ray
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), optical
imaging (OI), positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission-
computed
tomography
(SPECT),
ultrasound
(US),
and
photoacoustic
imaging (PAI). This, in turn, has led to an enormous number of new nano-
materials, which have generated completely new imaging applications in
living subjects. Imaging with nanomaterials, rather than conventional
approaches, has led to:1 (a) better control over their delivery; (b) a large
increase in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity; (c) the development of
contrast agents (CAs) for imaging modalities that had not used them before;
(d) the development of multimodal molecular imaging and theranostic
nano-platforms;2–4 and (e) in cases such as magnetic particle imaging (MPI),

approaches which can only function in the presence of nanoparticles. In this
chapter we will focus on inorganic nanomaterials that have been used for
in vivo imaging, describing the chemical and physical properties that are the
basis of their ability to provide contrast in each imaging modality.
The fundamental goal of molecular imaging is the quantitative in vivo
characterisation of biological processes at the molecular and cellular level,
by localising and measuring specific molecular targets or biochemical
pathways that characterise the anomalies at the basis of a given pathology.
These molecular biomarkers are identified by their specific interaction with
a targeted imaging probe that accumulates at the disease site and produces a
signal which is detected by a traditional medical imaging modality (PET,
SPECT, MRI, OI, US, PAI, etc.).5,6 In general, these agents are small molecules
containing an imaging reporter providing the signal to be detected, con-
nected to a molecular targeting vector (organic molecule, peptide, protein,
oligonucleotide, antibody, etc.). When injected systemically, they accumulate
at disease sites through specific binding to a given molecular biomarker.
With the development of nanotechnology, nanomaterials and nanoparticle-
based targeted probes for in vivo imaging have been developed. These must
be precisely engineered to have several important properties: (i) small
dimensions (1–100 nm); (ii) potentially high aﬃnity for target binding;
(iii) highly controllable and modular physicochemical properties (size,
shape, surface charge, etc.); (iv) high payload delivery of imaging reporters;
(v) increased imaging sensitivity and improved resolution.7 They can also be
designed to contain diﬀerent types of imaging reporters for simultaneous
multimodal detection or be combined with therapeutic agents for ther-
anostic applications. However, in spite of these advantages, their slower
diﬀusion, accumulation at the disease site and increased safety risks due to
potential toxicity can limit the ability of nanoparticles (NPs) to compete with
small-molecule agents.8,9
The use of imaging CAs generally involves the creation of a signal from an
external source that travels through the body and excites the agent. This
generates a reporting signal which crosses tissues and is measured by a
receptor device that quantifies the signal and spatially localises it, creating
an image. In some modalities, such as PET and SPECT, the imaging agent
generates the reporting signal spontaneously, and the latter reaches the
detector after traveling through the tissues. Therefore, the use of nano-
particles (NPs) as imaging agents involves optimisation of their physico-
chemical properties to maximise the absorption of the excitation energy and
the generation of the reporter signal. This chapter reviews the recent lit-
erature on the design, biomedical and in vivo diagnostic imaging appli-
cations of inorganic nanomaterials, including nanoparticles and hybrid
systems.10–12 It describes: (a) the physicochemical properties of nanoma-
terials required to optimise their eﬃcacy in the various imaging modalities;
(b) the physical basis of those modalities, comparing their advantages and
disadvantages; (c) some in vivo applications for each case, and (d) their
in vivo biodistribution, excretion, and toxicity issues.

Classes of Inorganic Nanomaterials for
Diagnostic Imaging
A huge number of studies have been published in the literature describing
mono- and multi-functional NPs, either metal based or non-metal based
(carbon, polymer, biological, lipid), as agents for biomedical and diag-
nostic imaging applications. In this chapter we will focus on metal-
containing NPs. Table 3.1 summarises the primary imaging modalities
used in clinical and preclinical animal studies, some of their important
features, and examples of the classes of associated nanomaterials. In this
section we describe the physicochemical properties required to optimise
eﬃcacy in the various imaging modalities, classifying them according to
their properties.

3.2.1
Magnetic Nanomaterials
3.2.1.1
Iron Oxide, Doped Iron Oxide, and Iron Alloys
Most of the magnetic nanomaterials for imaging have been based on iron
compounds, due to the biological safety and low toxicity of iron. Many
studies have described a large variety of NP sizes, shapes, and combinations
with other materials.13,14 Although magnetic nanomaterials have tradition-
ally been used in MRI, other modalities, such as MPI, have recently been
developed. These exploit magnetic nanomaterials not just to generate con-
trast, but also to directly create images.15
Magnetic properties of materials are very sensitive to their size and the
temperature, because they arise from the collective interactions of atomic
magnetic dipoles. Spherical ferromagnetic NPs consisting of an iron
core with a polymeric coating have been used in MRI.16 However,
superparamagnetic
NPs
are
most
commonly
used
as
MRI
CAs.
Superparamagnetism is a form of magnetism which appears in ferro-
magnetic or ferrimagnetic NPs when their size is reduced to a critical value
(rc), below which it will change from a state that has multiple magnetic
domains to one with only a single domain. Then, the thermal energy be-
comes similar to the energy needed for spins to flip their direction, leading
to the rapid randomisation of the magnetic dipoles. The typical time be-
tween two flips is called the Ne´el relaxation time. Such NPs are referred to as
superparamagnetic because their magnetisation appears to average to zero
in the absence of an external field, but they quickly respond to an external
magnetic field. This magnetises the NPs, similarly to a paramagnet but to a
much larger magnetic susceptibility value. In this condition, the magnet-
isation of the NPs acts like a single giant magnetic moment, which is the
sum of all the individual magnetic moments carried by the atoms of the NP.
Hard (high coercivity) and soft (low coercivity) ferromagnetic materials are
characterised by diﬀerent values of rc (3–4 nm and over 20 nm for very hard
and soft magnetic materials, respectively).17
The superparamagnetic NPs most commonly used as contrast agents for
MRI are composed of iron oxide particles of 1–150 mm. They are synthesised
from ferrites composed of maghemite (g-Fe2O3) or magnetite (Fe3O4), and
are often classified according to their eﬀective size and coating: mono-
crystalline iron oxide nano-colloids (MIONs, 5–30 nm), cross-linked iron
oxides (CLIOs, 10–50 nm), ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxides (US-
PIOs, 5–40 nm, a subset of MIONs with only one nanocrystal in the core),
and superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIO, 60–150 nm, with several nano-
crystals in the core). These NPs have been investigated as MRI CAs for a long
time, and some have been approved for clinical use in Europe.18,19 Their
synthesis, characterisation, and types of coating have been reviewed exten-
sively.19 Their T1/T2 (longitudinal relaxation time/transverse relaxation time)
contrast eﬀect depends on the core size. The NPs are primarily cleared
from the blood by the reticulo-endothelial system (RES) and also can be
taken up by monocytes and macrophages, which limits their utility in many
130
Chapter 3

diagnostic fields. Opsonisation of the NPs can preclude adequate biodis-
tribution and clearance, but this phenomenon can be minimised through
optimisation of their physicochemical properties.20
Other types of magnetic NPs have also been prepared and actively ex-
plored for MRI imaging, such as iron oxide ferrites doped with other metals
(e.g. MnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4), FeCo and FePt alloys, and
amorphous iron and iron carbides (Fe5C2).19,21–23 These new materials
have higher magnetic moments, saturation magnetisation, coercivity,
and relaxivities and thus lead to improved contrast agents for MRI (and
also for MPI).
3.2.1.2
Paramagnetic Metal Oxides and Other Salts
A variety of NPs derived from paramagnetic materials containing Ln31 or
Mn21 have been used to improve MRI contrast. Those designed for high T1
contrast eﬀects include small (o10 nm diameter) Gd2O3 NPs stabilised with
D-glucuronic acid,24 explored due to the high surface-to-volume ratio of the
NPs and the eﬀect of the Gd31 ions located at their surface.25 Gadolinium
phosphate (GdPO4)26 and fluoride (GdF3)27 NPs have also been developed
for improved in vivo behaviour in MRI. Paramagnetic NPs with large
magnetisation values have been proposed, which incorporate Gd31 into the
particle core or shell in a core–shell construct. An example of this approach
is NaYF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4 core–shell NPs (20–40 nm diameter), with Gd31
positioned only on the outer shell where it can interact with water protons
and promote T1-weighted image contrast.28 These nanomaterials are in-
trinsically multimodal with upconversion (UC) optical properties as well as
very good magnetic properties. Mn21 ions can also be used as the para-
magnetic dopant or matrix component in UC nanomaterials providing T1
contrast (see Section 3.2.2.3 for UC materials).25,29 Many MnO NPs have
also been developed as preclinical in vivo T1 agents.30 Their T1 relaxivity
depends strongly on their geometry and morphology, as their interfaces
with water critically influence their contrast eﬀects. For maximum eﬃcacy,
the paramagnetic Mn21 ions should be positioned at the surface.
Non-Gd lanthanide-based T2 MRI contrast agents, such as lanthanide
oxides (Ln2O3, Ln ¼ Eu, Dy, Ho, Er),31 have recently been proposed due to
their high magnetic moments and very short (o1 ps) electronic relaxation
times.32 Their 4f n electronic structure endows them with very useful
magnetic and optical properties for many imaging modalities, such as MRI,
optical (luminescence), CT, PET, and SPECT imaging (see later sections).
Dysprosium (Dy31)-based nanomaterials are the most studied, as they
show the largest T2 relaxation eﬀects.33 Moreover, the T2 eﬀects for Dy31-
based nanomaterials, such as b-NaDyF4, are two orders of magnitude
higher than for clinically approved iron oxide nanomaterials under
the increasingly used very high field magnets (7 T and higher). This arises
due to the Curie spin relaxation mechanism of the Dy31-based systems
(see Section 3.1).34

3.2.2
Optical Nanomaterials
3.2.2.1
Quantum Dots
Quantum dots (QDs) are semiconductor NPs with optical and electronic
properties quite diﬀerent from the corresponding bulk materials. In the pres-
ence of UV light, an electron is excited from the QD valence band to the con-
ductance band and, when coming back into the valence band, it releases its
energy by the emission of light (photoluminescence) with a frequency de-
pending on its bandgap. The first QDs to be developed had a core of inorganic
semiconductor nanocrystals with a typical size of 1–10 nm, a shell, and a bio-
compatible organic coating, leading to a final hydrodynamic radius (HD) in the
range of 5–50 nm. The core usually contains combinations of atoms of elem-
ents from groups II–VI (e.g., Cd, Zn, Se, and Te) or III–V (e.g., In, P, and As) in the
periodic table, for example CdSe, CdTe, HgTe, PbS, PbSe, PbTe, InAs, InP, and
GaAs.35,36 Some combinations can lead to near infrared (NIR) emission, such as
core–shell InAs–ZnS and CdTe–CdSe structures.37 Compared with con-
ventional small molecule organic dyes or fluorescent proteins, QDs have much
higher photostability, larger extinction coeﬃcients and quantum yields, nar-
row and tuneable optical absorption, and emission spectra that cover UV, vis-
ible and NIR wavelengths, and can also be used for multivalent ligand
conjugation.1,2,37,38 They can also be used in time-gated fluorescence meas-
urements, as their fluorescence lifetimes are of the order of 30–100 ns. Due to
the eﬀect of quantum confinement in their very small (o10 nm) dimensions,
the energy levels of the electrons in theQD atoms form energy bands typical of a
semiconductor material. Their excitation and emission peaks can be modu-
lated by changing the NPs’ size (as the QD becomes larger, the optical emission
shifts from blue to red), shape and chemical composition, or via the formation
of core–shell structures.35 The synthesis, functionalisation strategies, and
characterisation of QDs have been described elsewhere.36
Because of these favourable properties, QDs have been used extensively as
contrast agents for fluorescence imaging modalities (e.g. single- and multi-
photon microscopy).35,36,38,39 Hybrid nanostructures with fluorescence and
magnetism, such as Co@CdSe core–shell nanocomposites, have been used
for bimodal imaging.40 Some QDs can also be applied as contrast agents for
photoacoustic imaging.41
However, the potential in vivo use of semiconductor QDs is compromised by
toxicity problems due to the presence of at least one potentially toxic element,
which is needed to reach NIR wavelengths (e.g., In, As, Cd, or Te). Thus, more
biocompatible QDs based on Ag2S and carbon have been synthesised and
studied. Silver sulfide (Ag2S) QDs can be tuned to emit in the 500–1200 nm
range, and a thin silica coating applied to make them dispersible in aqueous
solutions and biocompatible. The coating also provides a surface for further
conjugation. Ag2S QDs are one of the few nanomaterials that have been imaged
in vivo in the NIR-II window (approximately 1100–1400 nm), allowing much
deeper tissue penetration than obtained with conventional NIR fluorophores.42
132
Chapter 3

In contrast, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have no bandgap structure,
but can have semiconductor bandgap-like fluorescence through surface
passivation-created defects, some of which are responsible for light ab-
sorption and others for light emission. Surface passivation of carbon QDs
can be used for tuning their emissive wavelength in the visible and NIR
regions, achieving very high quantum yields (up to 60–78%), and allowing
their use for in vivo optical imaging. Many other carbon-based nanoma-
terials, including single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), graphene, and
nanodiamonds, also exhibit exceptional optical properties, particularly for
imaging in the NIR region, resulting in eﬀective tissue penetration.43,44
3.2.2.2
Noble Metal NPs
Noble metal NPs (Ag, Au, Pt) have remarkable optical properties, as shown
by their colourful colloidal suspensions, which make them very useful in
biomedical imaging applications as CAs for optical imaging (OI) or multi-
modal combinations of OI and scattering imaging.35 Those metal NPs have
a strong UV–visible absorption band. This arises due to quantum con-
finement eﬀects not present in the bulk metal, and is known as the local-
ised surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The LSPR is excited by incident
light, with a wavelength larger than the diameter of the NP and a frequency
which is at resonance with the collective oscillation of the conduction
electrons at the NP surface interface between negative and positive per-
mittivity materials. The polarisation of the free electrons in the NP cloud re-
sults in wavelength-selective absorption with extremely large molar extinction
coeﬃcients, resonant Rayleigh scattering, and the enhancement of local elec-
tromagnetic fields near the surface of the NP. The LSPR peak position of gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) can be tuned in the visible and near-infrared regions,
as can the relative intensity of the scattering and absorption cross-sections,
depending on the NP size, shape, and surface environment. For instance, light
absorption predominates for small Au nanocages (edge lengtho45 nm) and
light scattering dominates for larger ones.45
The synthesis of AuNPs of diﬀerent and precisely controlled morpholo-
gies, including spheres, cubes, rods, cages, and wires, has been described.46
The use of AuNPs in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) bio-
assays, as OI probes, and as carriers of imaging agents has been widely
reported.46,47 Biomolecules containing exposed thiol groups can be attached
to the Au surface through Au–S bonds. The same can be done using
bifunctional metal chelates with a terminal thiol group, leaving carboxyl
or amine functionalities free for conjugation with other chemical entities.48
Silver NPs also show interesting properties, such as strong fluorescence
and shape-dependent light absorption spectra, and can be used in FRET
assays or OI applications.49 Despite concerns about their toxicity, platinum
nanoparticles (PtNPs), such as fluorescent Pt nanoclusters, have also been
successfully used as novel biocompatible OI probes.50

3.2.2.3
Rare-earth-doped Upconversion NPs
Ln31-doped NPs are attractive optical imaging probes, as a result of the
favourable luminescence properties of lanthanide ions, and can overcome
some
of
the
limitations
shown
by
organic
probes
and
QDs.51–53
Ln31-containing NPs have excellent photochemical stability, sharp emis-
sion peaks, and long emission lifetimes (ms to ms range). These make it
possible to use time-gated acquisition to increase the signal : noise ratio
and to minimise the interference from tissue light scattering or auto-
fluorescence, as well as give large Stokes shifts. In particular, Ln31-doped
up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) can be designed to be excited by
more than one low energy photon (usually NIR) and to emit a single, high-
energy photon (UV to NIR) through a process consisting of a series of
absorptions of multiple photons or energy-transfer processes (see Sec-
tion 3.3.3).54,55 Ln31-doped UCNPs contain three components: a sensitiser
(usually Yb31), an emitter (usually Tm31, Er31, Ho31), and a host matrix.
They can be excited with NIR light (800–980 nm) and emit light in a broad
range from UV to NIR. Their large anti-Stokes shifts are a favourable
property for in vivo OI, especially in NIR-to-NIR probes, due to the deep-
tissue penetrating properties of NIR light.56 This can be combined with
their MRI CA potential to develop dual probes. However, the quantum
yields of UCNPs are not as high as for QDs; for instance, the absolute
quantum yields of colloidal hexagonal [NaYF4:Yb31,Er31] NPs vary from
0.005% to 0.3%, depending on their size.57 Many studies have been dedi-
cated to improving the quantum yield of UCNPs, some of which have met
with success (see Section 3.3.3). Another interesting feature is that the
emission wavelengths of UCNPs are not size-dependent (as opposed to
QDs), which allows multicolour emission by varying the nature of the host
matrix and the Ln31 dopant. For these reasons, UCNPs show great po-
tential as OI probes for non-invasive and real-time in vivo diagnostics.52,55
The synthesis, surface modification, and bioconjugation of UCNPs have
been described in detail in two recent reviews.54,58
3.2.3
Acoustic Nanomaterials
Acoustic NPs are primarily used in US imaging, where contrast is obtained
based on diﬀerences in the acoustic impedance (echogenicity) between the
tissues being imaged upon application of acoustic waves and detection of
their echoes.59 The main classes of US contrast agents are: (a) microbubbles
(approximately 1–4 mm diameter), composed of surfactant, protein, and/or
polymer shells containing gas cores, for example air, perfluorocarbons, or
nitrogen, used to image the vascular space; (b) perfluorocarbon emulsions
and smaller, vessel extravasating, nanobubbles; (c) hollow silica nano-

Another type of materials with useful acoustic properties are CAs for PAI,
also commonly known as optoacoustic or thermoacoustic imaging. In this
modality, the acoustic information is detected as an ultrasound wave re-
sulting from thermoelastic expansion of the tissue upon optical excitation.
The photoacoustic signal strength depends on the optical-to-acoustic con-
version eﬃciency of the tissue. There are several endogenous contrast agents
used in PAI, including haemoglobin, melanin and lipids present in tissues.
Several types of exogenous PAI CAs have been proposed using metal-based
NPs.63,64 Their main nanostructures are based on systems also used as IO
probes: (a) plasmonic noble metal NPs [such as AuNPs of various shapes
(nanospheres, nano-stars, nanocages, nanoplates, nano-shells (Si@Au NPs),
etc.], Ag nanoplates with large absorption cross-sections, or semiconducting
QDs), and (b) carbon nanomaterials, such as nano-diamonds, carbon na-
notubes, and graphene.65
3.2.4
Nuclear Nanomaterials
Imaging using nuclear nanomaterials is performed with (a) radioactive
materials containing radioisotopes that can be detected and imaged as a
consequence of their b1 radioactive decay in PET or g decay in SPECT, or (b)
nanomaterials that contain atoms capable of attenuating high-energy X-rays,
leading to image contrast in X-ray CT (Table 3.1). All these modalities can
visualise any body region (such as bones, soft tissues and lungs) with no
depth-penetration problems.
3.2.4.1
Radioactive Nanomaterials
All kinds of NPs can be labelled with radioisotopes, which are used to lo-
calise their accumulation site(s) in the body with extremely high sensitivity
(1010–1011 M). The choice of the radiolabel and the radiolabelling strat-
egies of the NPs will be discussed in Section 3.3.2.
3.2.4.2
Nanomaterials for X-ray Computed Tomography
X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an imaging modality in which the image
contrast between diﬀerent tissues results from their diﬀerent degrees of
attenuation of incident X-rays, given by their mass attenuation coeﬃcients
(mp). A common example of this in clinical imaging is the high contrast
between bone and soft tissues, as electron-dense structures (e.g. bone)
attenuate X-rays much more than electron-poorer structures (such as soft
tissues). Although the interaction mechanism between X-rays and tissue is
quite complex (see Section 3.3.4), the determining factor of the attenuation
coeﬃcient of a material is the photoelectric eﬀect, which, at a given photon
energy, is proportional to Zn (n is approximately 3), where Z is the atomic
number of the atoms in the material. Contrast between diﬀerent soft tissues
is quite low, because there are no significant diﬀerences in Z values in their
Imaging Applications of Inorganic Nanomaterials
135

atomic compositions. Soft tissue contrast can however be generated using
extrinsic CAs made of dense inorganic materials with high Z values
(and thus higher absorption coeﬃcients). Examples are barium (Z ¼ 56)
sulfate, metallic gold (Au, Z ¼ 79), tantalum (Ta, Z ¼ 73) or bismuth (Bi,
Z ¼ 83) sulfides and lanthanide (e.g., Eu, Gd, and Yb, Z ¼ 63, 64, 70, re-
spectively) oxides.66–68 Au NPs are quite popular, in part due to the high
energy (80.7 keV) of the K-edge absorption of gold generating greater con-
trast than iodinated CAs, particularly at high X-ray tube voltages (see Sec-
tion 3.3.4).69 The diﬀerent agents can be used together in spectral CT (also
known as dual-energy CT, DECT), one of the latest CT imaging advances
which uses special detectors able to discriminate X-rays into several energy
windows (see Section 3.3.4).70,71
3.2.5
Carrier Nanomaterials
Carrier nanomaterials can be loaded with one or more small diagnostic or
therapeutic materials, such as fluorophores, dyes, Gd31 chelates, nuclear
isotopes, or iron oxides. Such carriers hence have an important role in in vivo
imaging. Examples of carriers include both organic (liposomes, micelles,
polymers, etc.) and inorganic (e.g. silica, carbon) nanomaterials.
Silica is frequently used as a component of biocompatible core–shell hy-
brid NPs, due to its chemical and biological inertness and thermal stabil-
ity.72 Silica colloids are stable at high concentrations due to their surface
charge, and in addition this surface chemistry allows further modification
using siloxane-based cross-linkers. Mesoporous silica can be used to en-
capsulate fluorophores to form water soluble, eﬃcient and photostable op-
tical imaging agents.73 Hollow mesoporous silica MnO nanomaterials
(HMnO@mSiO2) have been used as CAs for labelling and tracking intra-
cranial stem cell implants as a function of time.74
Calcium phosphate is a biocompatible and biodegradable material with
low toxicity that can form core–shell NPs and be used as a carrier for many
diagnostic and therapeutic agents. However, the NPs generally have large
(20–100
nm)
hydrodynamic
sizes
and
their
surface
modification
is
challenging.75
Carbon-based nanomaterials, such as C60 buckyballs and cylindrical
single-walled or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTS or MWCNTS) are
hollow containers that can entrap a large variety of diagnostic and/or
therapeutic agents.76,77 Their high hydrophobicity causes strong aggre-
gation and non-specific binding to plasma proteins, however. After surface
modification, such as oxidation or conjugation with hydrophilic organic
molecules, they become water-dispersible and useful in biological imaging
applications, despite their potential toxicity and long in vivo retention
times.78
Semiconductor nanowires composed of silicon, carbon, and other ma-
terials can also be used for delivery of contrast agents into living cells.79
However, their needle-like shape may cause cytotoxicity.80

3.3
Inorganic Materials in Diagnostic Imaging
Modalities
In this section we describe briefly the physical basis of the main imaging
modalities and relate them to the way in which the imaging nanomaterials
aﬀect their contrast. Their advantages and disadvantages are also
compared.
3.3.1
MRI Contrast Agents
MRI is one of the most powerful clinical diagnosis tools available. It is non-
invasive, ionising radiation-free, and provides tomographic images with
large penetration depth, outstanding spatial resolution (maximum 10 mm in
pre-clinical systems and 50 mm in clinical scanners) and high soft tissue
image contrast. This mostly results from diﬀerences in 1H NMR signal in-
tensities, dominated by the most abundant water and fat protons.
Such intensity diﬀerences are governed by variations in intrinsic local
1H concentrations, longitudinal (R1 ¼ 1/T1) and transverse [R2 ¼ 1/T2 and
R2* ¼ 1/T2*, where T2* is the time constant for the free induction decay (FID)
in the presence of magnetic field inhomogeneities] nuclear spin relaxation
rates, as well as diﬀusion and flow.81 Therefore, image contrast between
normal and diseased tissues can be enhanced by applying CAs which
modulate these parameters.82–86 The most frequently used CAs are para-
magnetic materials, such as Gd31 or Mn21-containing chelates or nano-
particles. As they increase the R1 of water protons more than the R2, leading
to bright areas in T1-weighted (T1w) images, they are called positive or T1 CAs.
The clinically applied CAs are based on Gd31-complexes of low molecular
weight octadentate ligands, such as [Gd(DOTA)(H2O)] (DOTA ¼ 1,4,7,10-
tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic
acid)
(sold
commercially
as
DOTAREM). This has one water molecule in the first coordination sphere of
Gd31 and high thermodynamic and kinetic stability. T2 or negative CAs in-
crease the R2 of water protons more than the R1, giving rise to dark areas in
T2w or T*2w images, and commonly consist of superparamagnetic materials
such as iron-oxide NPs.82–86 The eﬃcacy of CAs is expressed by their relax-
ivity, the longitudinal or transverse relaxation rate enhancement for a so-
lution containing 1 mM of magnetic metal ions (r1 and r2, respectively).
The sensitivity of small Gd31 complexes as MRI contrast agents is relatively
low (104–105 M). Therefore, the use of NPs as MRI CAs is quite useful, due
to the possibility of delivering a large number of magnetic centres to a given
target (‘cargo eﬀect’), magnifying the local contrast eﬀect obtained.
The r1 of metal chelates is usually studied as a function of the external
magnetic field strength (B0), leading to their 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
dispersion (NMRD) profile. This can be evaluated using models based on the
Solomon–Bloembergen–Morgan (SBM) and the Freed theories for the con-
tributions of the water protons in the inner sphere (IS) and outer sphere (OS)
of the metal ion, respectively.82,83,87 For r1, the main parameters determining
Imaging Applications of Inorganic Nanomaterials
137

the IS contribution are the number of water molecules in the first coordin-
ation sphere of the metal ion (q), their residence time in the first coordin-
ation sphere (tM ¼ kex
1, where kex is the water exchange rate), and
the molecular rotational correlation time (tR) (Figure 3.1a). The OS contri-
bution is determined by the diﬀusion correlation time (tD) and the distance
of closest approach (a) of the water molecules freely diﬀusing near the
complex.
The r1 and r2 values of paramagnetic NPs also have IS and OS contri-
butions (Figure 3.1b). The IS contributions arise from the exchange of the
protons on water molecules directly coordinated to the metal ions on
the surface of the NPs with bulk water. In the case of Gd31 ions, they aﬀect
the bound water proton relaxation through contact and dipolar terms, and
can be modelled by the SBM equations. When other paramagnetic Ln31 ions
(e.g. Tb31) are present, a Curie term is also present.88 The inner-sphere r1
depends on the hydration number of the surface ions, and the NP’s surfa-
ce:volume ratio.33 It is often very small because it involves only the para-
magnetic ions at the surface of the NPs that are in direct contact with water.
The OS mechanism results from the diﬀusion of water molecules in the
magnetic field inhomogeneities created in their vicinity by the magnetised
NPs, and does not contain the contact and Curie terms. It is usually much
larger and is governed by the volume fraction of the superparamagnetic
particles (u), the diﬀusion correlation time (tD ¼ d2/4D, where d is the
diameter of the particle and D is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient), and the mag-
netisation of the NP (M) at the Bo value of the clinical MRI scanner.
In the case of superparamagnetic NPs, the OS contribution is also dom-
inant. However, in a colloidal dispersion in the presence of a magnetic field,
the return of their magnetisation to equilibrium is determined by two dif-
ferent processes (Figure 3.2).19 The first one is the Ne´el relaxation (defined
Figure 3.1
Nuclear relaxation mechanisms and relaxation parameters of water
protons induced by (a) paramagnetic chelates; (b) (Super)paramagnetic
NPs.
138
Chapter 3

by the relaxation time tN). This describes the return to equilibrium of the
magnetisation of each of the NPs after a perturbation that tilts that mag-
netisation away from the direction of its easy axis. The magnetic energy of
the single domain NP is a function of the direction of its magnetisation
vector (relative to the crystallographic directions) and the directions that
minimise this energy are known as anisotropy directions or easy axes. The
energy increases with the tilt angle y between the magnetisation vector and
the easy directions. The total amplitude of this variation is the anisotropy
energy (Ea) and is proportional to the crystal volume V,
Ea ¼ KaV
(3.1)
where Ka is the anisotropy constant. At high anisotropy, the magnetisation is
locked in the easy axes, according to the Boltzman law which favours the
direction of lower Ea. Thus, the Ne´el relaxation time defines the fluctuations
that arise from jumps of the magnetisation between diﬀerent easy directions
(Figure 3.2). The Ne´el relaxation time is a function of Ea according to the
Arrhenius law,
tN ¼ t0(Ea) exp (Ea/kT)
(3.2)
where k is the Boltzman constant and T is the absolute temperature. The pre-
exponential factor, t0(Ea), depends on Ea, V and the saturation magnetisation
MS at 0 Kelvin and at the laboratory temperature. As opposed to the ex-
ponential factor, the pre-exponential factor decreases as Ea increases. For
USPIO NPs with a radius below 4 nm at room temperature the low anisotropy
condition applies. Thus, for small Ea and high T, Ea{kT, and tNEt0 (Ea)

decreases as Ea increases. However, large NPs, such as SPIO NPs, with a large
number of crystal domains, may have very high anisotropy energy. This re-
sults in a situation where EackT, and tNEexp (Ea/kT) increases very fast with
increasing Ea.
The second process is Brownian relaxation (defined by the relaxation time
tB), which characterises the viscous rotation of the particle. The global
magnetic relaxation rate of the colloid is the sum of the Ne´el and Brownian
relaxation rates, t1 ¼ tN
1 þ tB
1, where t is the global magnetic relaxation
time,
tB ¼ 3VZ/kT
(3.3)
where Z is the viscosity of the aqueous dispersion. For large particles, tB{tN,
because tB is proportional to V and tN increases exponentially with V.
This fast rotation process becomes dominant and the corresponding fast
magnetic relaxation allows the NPs solution to be always at thermodynamic
equilibrium. This is characteristic of a superparamagnetic material, where
the magnetisation evolution with an external magnetic field (H) is pro-
portional to a Langevin function and leads to a characteristic magnetisation
curve M(H) which saturates at high H, defining the saturation magnetisation
MS.89
In these systems, r1 and r2 can be described by Freed’s model for para-
magnetic systems, using the diﬀusion correlation time (tD) and considering
the electron spin longitudinal relaxation time tS1 as equal to the Ne´el re-
laxation time tN. When tD{tN, Freed’s equations reduce to the earlier
equations of Ayant. The corresponding theory and equations have been
described in the literature.19
The magnetisation of superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs reaches its sat-
uration value MS at B0r0.5 T, which is at the lower limit for commonly used
clinical MRI scanners. Therefore, their R2 is in practice usually independent
of B0. Several models have been developed to describe the transverse relax-
ivity of spherical superparamagnetic NPs.19,89–91 Three regimes can be dis-
tinguished with limits defined by tD, the static correlation time (1/Do ¼ 3/
(gm0MS)), and the correlation time tCP, defined as half the time interval be-
tween successive 1801 pulses in a Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) se-
quence. For small particle sizes, where the Redfield condition, tD{1/Do is
satisfied, the condition for motional narrowing regime (MAR) is also satis-
fied. This means that the free diﬀusion motions of water molecules sur-
rounding the particles explore all possible values of the magnetic dipolar
field created by the electronic magnetic moment of the particle, and are
faster than the spatial variation of the local field inhomogeneities produced
by the individual particles, which results in a motional averaged eﬀect by
these particles. Then, R2 and R2* are linearly dependent on tD, M2
u, and u, e.g.,
R2 ¼ 16pg2m0

where Mu is the overall magnetisation of the nanomaterial with volume u, g is

140
Chapter 3

susceptibility of a vacuum and L is the thickness of the impermeable layer
around the superparamagnetic core.25,89 This is satisfied for small single
NPs of pure magnetic materials, or with a thin fully hydrated shell, and also
for hybrid materials with a small overall Mu relative to the magnetisation of
the inorganic part (MS). An example of the latter would be dilute vesicles
containing few iron oxide nanoparticles or magnetic cores wrapped in a
thick silica coating.
For clusters and hybrids, apart from defining an adapted magnetisation
Mu and diameter d corresponding to the whole hydrodynamic diameter, an
intra-aggregate volume fraction, fintra, has been introduced to derive a
corrected relaxivity r2
0 ¼ r2fintra. A linear correlation between r2
0/M2
u and d2
has been observed, according to eqn (3.4), for a series of nanomaterials
obeying the MAR regime.89
The proportionality of R2 to Ms
2 predicts that smaller NPs, with higher
surface to volume ratios, will have a reduced MS value owing to a large
contribution of paramagnetic canted magnetic spin states on their surface
reducing their relaxivity.92 However, minimisation of this eﬀect can be
obtained through careful design of the NPs’ surface layer.93
For particles with size d and magnetisation Mu such that tD42.70/Do, the
static dephasing regime (SDR) is entered, implying that water protons ex-
plore only a small space compared with the hydrodynamic volume (or outer
sphere) around the NP. In this case, R2 and R2* are only dependent on Mu
and u, and R2 and R2* reach their maximum value. For larger NPs, R2*
remains constant as a function of tD but R2 decreases depending on tCP,
because then the magnetic field gradients close to the NPs become so strong
that refocusing of the magnetisation becomes impossible.89,94 For particles
with intermediate characteristics, a transition between the MAR and SDR
relaxation regimes is observed.
Superparamagnetic NPs are the T2 CAs most commonly used in the MRI
field, usually with a very high r2 (typically 60–400 s1 mM1), in particular
the SPIOs. This can hamper the interpretation of T2w images due to the
diﬃculty in distinguishing the CA-induced darkening from partial-volume
artifacts, motion artifacts, and tissue inhomogeneities.81
3.3.2
Nuclear Imaging Nanoprobes
After the discovery of radioactivity by Becquerel at the end of the 19th cen-
tury, the first medical application of radioisotopes was demonstrated more
than 40 years later when radioactive iodine (RAI; 131I) was used for the
treatment of thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism.95 In later years, after
introduction of dosimetric methods, a more widespread application of
radionuclides became possible, including metabolic tracer studies and
nuclear imaging.96 Nowadays, PET and SPECT are major clinical diagnostic
imaging modalities that allow pathophysiological processes to be visualised
and therapeutic eﬀects to be monitored in vivo. While MRI can be performed
in the absence of CAs, PET and SPECT imaging require the application

(typically by injection) of species labelled with radioisotopes. These radio-
pharmaceuticals are administrated in tracer quantities, and are then dis-
tributed, metabolised and excreted from the body depending on their
physiological function. In this way, they reflect the fate of their unlabelled
analogues, with no additional pharmacological eﬀects. Only a few of the
tracer molecules contain a radioactive isotope, which is diluted by the
presence of those containing a non-radioactive (‘cold’) isotope. The diﬀerent
decay mechanisms of the radioisotopes to the ground state determine the
spatial resolution, specificity, examination time, and sensitivity of the im-
aging technique. The radionuclide imaging agents should have: (a) short
half-lives (t1/2) that match the biological t1/2 of the tracer molecule; (b) high
specific activity [SA, in MBq mg1, is the ratio between the activity and mass
of the radionuclide, and is a physical property of that radionuclide; activity
(Bq), is defined as the number of radioactive transformations per second
that occur with a particular radionuclide]; and (c) a high target:non-target
ratio, allowing a low application dose. The radionuclide production and
labelling procedures should also be short and eﬃcient.
The production of radionuclides involves in all cases activation of stable
atoms by bombarding them with subnuclear particles in nuclear reactors or
accelerators, including cyclotrons. After activation, radionuclides decay to a
stable state through diﬀerent mechanisms, the most important ones in-
volving the emission of a and/or b-particles and g-rays.
For imaging purposes, b1- and g-emitting radioisotopes are used in PET
and SPECT, respectively (Table 3.2). Radionuclides emitting a or b (elec-
trons) particles are applied for therapy, due to their short tissue ranges, high
energies and high linear energy transfer.
Radionuclide generators are useful and less expensive devices than ac-
celerators; they produce continuously a short-lived medical radionuclide
(known as a ‘daughter’) from the radioactive transformation of a non-
medical long-lived radionuclide (called a ‘parent’). By having a supply of
the parent at a facility, the daughter is continuously generated on site.
The repeated separation of the daughter radionuclide from the parent is
readily achieved by passing an eluent solution through a column con-
taining the parent to remove any daughter species formed. After the sep-
aration, the generator starts producing more daughter that can be again
separated later in suﬃcient quantity. Two important examples are the
99Mo (t1/2 ¼ 66 h)–99mTc and
68Ge (t1/2 ¼ 270.95 days)–68Ga generators.
The parent nuclides decay by g-ray emission, and are obtained, in the first
case, by neutron activation of 98Mo in a high neutron flux reactor and in
the second case, for example, after proton irradiation of gallium metal by
proton capture and double neutron knockout.
PET and SPECT have relatively low spatial resolution compared with MRI:
in the case of PET, 1–2 mm and 6–10 mm in pre-clinical and clinical systems,
respectively; for SPECT, 0.5–2 mm and 7–17 mm in pre-clinical and clinical
systems, respectively.97 However, their detection sensitivity is the highest
among the non-invasive imaging techniques (pM for PET and nM for
142
Chapter 3

SPECT), which allows the in vivo generation of three-dimensional images of
biological processes at the molecular and cellular level, one of the funda-
mental aims of molecular imaging.98 Their low anatomical resolution can
be compensated for by fusion with CT or MR images. Therefore, the devel-
opment of hybrid systems providing complementary information in a
single imaging session is a very important development.99 In general, the
properties described above, as well as their non-invasiveness, quantitative
analysis, unlimited penetration depth and recent advances in radiotracer
development, make it possible to attain many clinical objectives with
PET and SPECT, such as early lesion detection, patient screening and
stratification, as well as individualised treatment monitoring and dose
optimisation.

aElectron capture: an orbital electron is captured by the nucleus and combines with a proton to

PET is based on the visualisation and quantification of positron-emitting
radionuclides in living subjects. After emission from the nucleus, the positron
travels for a short distance and undergoes annihilation with an electron from
the surrounding tissue, with a probability that depends on the positron energy
and the thickness and the composition of the tissue. Upon annihilation, there
is a simultaneous production of two 511 keV g-rays that are emitted at 1801 to
each other. The simultaneous detection of a large number of pairs of g-rays
with directional correlation by an array of detectors (coincident events) allows
the reconstruction of a PET image that provides quantitative information on
the distribution of radioactivity within the tissue. Positrons with higher energy
travel longer distances before annihilation occurs (have a larger positron
range), which results in loss of spatial resolution.
Positron-emitting isotopes including 11C, 13N, 15O, 18F, 64Cu, 68Ga, 86Y,
and 89Zr are routinely used for PET (Table 3.2). Their relatively short t1/2 is a
limiting factor. PET radionuclides, such as 11C or 18F, are incorporated
into a biologically active molecule by fast synthetic methods. 11C is com-
monly incorporated through C-, O-, N-, or S-methylation reactions
with 11C-methyl iodide in the presence of a base.100 The introduction
of 18F usually uses electrophilic and nucleophilic radiofluorination.101,102
Radiometals are protected by an organic chelator such as 1,4,7,10-tetra-
azacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetric
acid
(DOTA)
or
2-[bis[2-

acid
(DTPA),103
forming
stable complexes. The rapid complexation kinetics allow fast and eﬃcient
labelling and slow dissociation. This is important as detachment of
radioisotopes from the chelator can lead to errors in imaging.104
Among the various PET probes available, 18F-substituted small molecules
{such as 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and [18F]fluorothymide (FTL)}
and 11C-labelled peptides or a-amino acids, such as L-methionine, are the
most widely used for imaging in oncology and neurology.105 However, their
high accumulation in healthy tissues such as the brain and bladder, and
increased uptake caused by inflammatory conditions, restrict the use of
these PET agents for some pathologies.106
SPECT imaging can also quantify molecular processes in vivo, due to its very
high sensitivity (nM range). Its radiotracers contain radioisotopes whose decay
directly produces g-rays with energies generally in the 90–170 KeV range
(Table 3.2), which is lower than the energy range of PET tracers.107 After
emission from the radionuclide, the single photons travel through the tissues
and are detected by a gamma camera to obtain 3D images. Pinhole colli-
mators, placed in front of the gamma camera, select the g-rays able to reach
the detector, depending on their angle of incidence. Through this process the
signal position on the detector represents accurately the source of the gamma
ray, but it typically also lowers the sensitivity of SPECT due to the resultant low
detection eﬃciency (o104 times the emitted number of gamma rays).
However, recent hardware developments, using multi-pinhole acquisition
methods, have solved this problem.108 This technology has also improved the
spatial resolution of SPECT, which has no theoretical limitation.109

Chapter 3

The use of radiometal isotopes requires fast chelation with appropriate
ligands to form stable complexes. SPECT has some advantages relative to
PET: (i) its availability for clinical practice is wider due to the lower costs of
gamma-cameras; (ii) the typically longer half-lives of SPECT radioisotopes
(e.g. 99mTc and 111In, Table 3.2) facilitate the radiolabelling process and
make them suitable to monitor slow physiological processes; (iii) production
of SPECT radioisotopes does not need the presence of on-site cyclotrons. In
fact, 99mTc-labelled imaging agents are the most common in SPECT, as this
radioisotope can be produced from its parent radionuclide 99Mo (t1/2 ¼ 67 h)
using commercial generators.
Recent progress in the development of radiolabelled NPs for personalised
cancer therapy has combined the high sensitivity and quantitative nature of
PET with the multifunctional and tuneable physicochemical properties of
nanomaterials. This allows researchers to obtain optimal in vivo pharmaco-
kinetics and targeted molecular imaging.110,111 The design of a radiolabelled
nanoprobe involves the rational selection of the isotope, the radiolabelling
strategy and the general design of the nanoplatform. The selection of the
radioisotope has been discussed, and the types of nanoplatforms used and
some applications will be discussed in Section 3.4.1.2. Here we will briefly
describe the main radiolabelling strategies used with NPs.
A radiolabelling method must be fast, safe and very eﬃcient, with minimum
perturbation of the intrinsic pharmacokinetics of the carrier and without re-
lease of the radioisotope.112 Figure 3.3 describes schematically the five major
radiolabelling strategies used, each of which has advantages and disadvan-
tages. The traditional method (chelator-mediated complexation, Figure 3.3a)
involves connecting the radiometal to the NP using ligands such as 1,4,7-tria-
zacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), DOTA, or DTPA, using known co-
ordination chemistry. As the NP is not radiolabelled, detachment of the whole
complex in the presence of high protein concentrations, or of the radiometal by
transchelation, can lead to imaging errors. A proposed alternative is the in-
corporation of trace amounts of radioactive precursors during the synthesis of
nanoparticles.112 Although this method can give very stable agents with high
radiochemical yields, generation of radioactive waste and long labelling times
limit the wide application of the process. Other problems are chemical limi-
tations in obtaining specific coordination geometries, diﬃculties in purifi-
cation, and alteration of the NP surface properties. Several strategies for
chelator-free syntheses by direct incorporation of the radionuclide into the
NP core have been proposed to solve these limitations.113 Such intrinsic
radiolabelling strategies (Figure 3.3b1) include: rapid trapping of certain nu-
clides into the NP via specific absorption or coordination bonding, a general
approach which has been successful for many isotopes and nanoplatforms;
(Figure 3.3b2) ion-exchange mechanisms have also been applied in many cases;
(Figure 3.3c) adding trace levels of radioactive (or hot) precursors together with
non-radioactive (or cold) precursors during the synthesis of the NPs is simple,
and the most widely used method; and (Figure 3.3d) proton beam activation
using direct irradiation of certain NPs with protons.113

Although chelator-free radiolabelling has been demonstrated with a large
number of NPs, most studies show the same specificity problems that arise
with traditional chelator-based methods.111,113

which uses genetic engineering of the cells of interest by incorporation of an
exogenous reporter gene, such as luciferase from the North American firefly;
and luminescence imaging (including fluorescence and phosphorescence),
which requires the administration of specific probes. Luminescence is an
optical phenomenon involving a series of photophysical processes, as de-
scribed by the Jablonski diagram (Figure 3.4). Absorption of photons of
visible (l ¼ 380–740 nm) or ultraviolet (UV, lo380 nm) light with energy
equal to the energy diﬀerence between two energy states of a system causes it
to jump from the ground state (S0) to a higher energy state (e.g., first excited
singlet state S1, second excited state S2, etc.). The molecules in the excited
singlet state then decay back to the ground state through a chain of pho-
tophysical events. Some of these are very fast and occur without light
emission (non-radiative), such as vibrational relaxation between vibrational
states within each electronic singlet or triplet state, internal conversion be-
tween consecutive excited singlet states, non-radiative relaxation, quenching
processes and intersystem crossing (from a singlet state to a triplet state, e.g.
S1 to T1) or back transfer (the opposite process). The radiative processes,
involving light emission with longer wavelengths (Stokes shift), are of two
kinds: fluorescence, with emission from S1 to S0 after a brief interval termed
the fluorescence lifetime (in the ns range) or phosphorescence, e.g. from T1
to S0, with longer lifetimes (in the ms to 100 s range).115
Optical imaging is simple to operate, safe and cost eﬀective. Exogenous
probes are excited by laser diodes at a frequency close to that of the detected
light, and the emitted light is detected in a spatially resolved manner by a
cooled charge-coupled device camera. OI has many advantages when

compared
with
other
modalities:
it
(a)
uses
non-ionising
radiation
(like MRI); (b) is highly sensitive and semi-quantitative, producing real-time
images with high contrast, able to respond to biological events; (c) provides
subcellular resolution using nM probe concentrations; and (d) allows
multichannel detection using multiple probes with diﬀerent properties.116
However, OI also has some key disadvantages: (a) limited penetration depth
into biological tissue due to strong light absorption; (b) background signal
due to light scattering and autofluorescence, which aﬀects the image con-
trast; and, (c) the low photostability of some organic dye probes. These
factors are the major limitations of in vivo applications when visible light is
used, such as with Eu31 (red emission at 620 nm) or Tb31 (green emission at
540–550 nm) complexes.51,52,114 To overcome these problems, fluorescent
probes with excitation and/or emission wavelengths falling into the NIR
spectral region have been developed.117–120 In the classical NIR window (NIR
I, l ¼ 700–950 nm), the main tissue chromophores, such as oxy- and deoxy-
haemoglobin, water, melanin and fat, have quite low light absorbance,
making them suitable for in vivo imaging studies.117 Several probes function
in
this
region,
including
organic
dyes,121
and
luminescent
nano-
particles,114,122 such as some semiconductor quantum dots (QDs).123
Recently, fluorescence imaging has expanded to the second and third
biological windows (NIR-II: 1000–1350 nm, NIR-III: 1500–1870 nm) with
increasing wavelengths. Despite slight absorbance of the incident NIR by
water, this can be eﬀective due to there being reduced light scattering
and minimal autofluorescence from biological tissues in NIR-II and III
compared with the well-established visible and NIR-I spectral regions.
This allows in vivo fluorescence imaging with deep tissue penetration
(up to approximately 4 mm into the murine cerebral cortex), higher
fluorescent tumour-to-normal tissue signal ratios, low phototoxicity and
photobleaching, and much better spatial resolution.119 Several classes of
nanomaterials with the capacity to absorb or to emit NIR light for bioi-
maging applications have recently been proposed as probes to explore
these NIR windows. These include, among others, rare-earth based NPs,
group-IV nanostructures (single-walled carbon nanotubes, carbon nano-
particles and Si- or Ge-based nanostructures), and Ag, In, and Pb chalco-
genide quantum dots.119,124
NIR luminescent NPs can be classified into two categories: (a) Stokes shift-
based NPs emitting NIR light and (b) anti-Stokes-shift-based NPs using NIR
excitation.122,125 In the first category, NPs are excited in the NIR using a
single photon and undergo normal Stokes emission (down-conversion) in
the NIR (NIR–NIR NPs). Such materials include carbon nanotubes, NIR QDs
and lanthanide-doped NPs. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) emit-
ting in the NIR-II region have been reported for whole-body mouse imaging
with high penetration depth, high image resolution and contrast and real-
time monitoring.126 However, they are limited by low fluorescence quantum
yields and broad emission bands. Si- and Ge-based NIR–NIR probes have
also been exploited, but to a lesser extent.118 Another option is NIR emitting
148
Chapter 3

QDs with high quantum yields and sharp emission bands, especially in the
useful NIR-II region. However, many QDs with appropriate properties also
contain highly toxic elements such as Cd, Pb, As, In, and Hg, which are not
suitable for human studies. Recently, Ag2S and Ag2Se QDs with controlled
size have been developed as alternative NIR-II emitting probes with high
quantum yields, low cytotoxicity, and high biocompatibility, and have been
successfully applied in cellular and small animal imaging.127,128 NPs doped
with Ln31 ions which are excitable and emit in the NIR region (mainly Nd31,
Er31, Yb31), commonly used as UCNPs, have also been explored as Stokes
NIR-II emitters. The ladder-like energy levels of Ln31 ions give narrow
emission lines and allow multispectral imaging. In the case of NaYF4:Yb31/
Ln31@NaYF4 (Ln ¼ Er, Ho, Tm, Pr) core–shell NPs, the Er31-doped NPs
(emission at 1525 nm, NIR-III) showed decreased scattering, and increased
transmittance and deep tissue penetration.129 Core–shell NaGdF4:3%
Nd@NaGdF4 NPs are another example, with large quantum yields (ap-
proximately 20%), that have been used in in vivo mouse imaging and showed
organ localisation.130
NPs based on anti-Stokes emission processes convert the absorption of
two or more long-wavelength photons (e.g. NIR) into the emission of one
photon at shorter wavelengths (e.g. visible light), including simultaneous
multiphoton absorption (MPA), second-harmonic generation (SHG), and
upconversion (UC) (Figure 3.5).131 MPA, mainly two- or three-photon ab-
sorption (2PA or 3PA), involves the simultaneous absorption of two (or more)
photons by a chromophore.132,133 As the overall eﬃciency of MPA is very low,
it requires sample excitation by high-power (106–109 W cm2) femtosecond
pulsed lasers. Under the eﬀect of the laser beam, 2PA can be described as
one photon being absorbed first to promote the molecule into an ‘inter-
mediate state’, followed by absorption of a second photon taking it up to the

excited state. Contrary to up-conversion (UC), the ‘intermediate state’ is not a
real state and, as its lifetime is extremely short, the two absorption steps
have to occur quasi-simultaneously. Most of the experiments are conducted
with single frequency laser light (degenerate MPA), but simultaneous ab-
sorption of several photons of diﬀerent energies is also possible. Multi-
photon microscopy has improved spatial resolution relative to conventional
confocal microscopy, due to the localisation of the excitation in the focal
volume. However, the need to scan the samples leads to long data acqui-
sition times. Therefore, the development of NPs with high multiphoton
eﬃciency is very important.
Various types of inorganic NPs have been developed as probes for mul-
tiphoton imaging, including semiconductor QDs, quantum rods, gold NPs,
and carbon dots. Those with the highest two-photon absorption cross
section are semiconductor QDs,118,122 such as those doped with non-toxic
metal ions, e.g., ZnS : Mn or ZnSe : Mn. They show eﬃcient 2PA (at 600 nm)
and 3PA (at 900 nm) and thus they can be excited by a 920 nm NIR pulsed
laser. The presence of the Mn21 dopant ions induces the red-shift of the
emission light from blue (430 nm) to orange (580 nm), facilitating the es-
cape of light from the tissue.134 The same NPs were shown to have better
2PA properties when irradiated with NIR-II light, allowing high-resolution
deep-tissue imaging.135
Photon up-conversion (UC) is another anti-Stokes process that involves
sequential absorption of two or more photons by physically real, metastable,
long-lived intermediary electronic energy states.136,137 In contrast to MPA,
UC can be eﬃciently excited using low power (1–103 W cm2) continuous-
wave laser diodes, especially in solid state materials doped with Ln31 ions,
and results in long luminescence lifetimes (up to several hundred ms) and
much higher emission eﬃciency than MPA. The UC process can proceed by
diﬀerent mechanisms, the main ones being excited state absorption (ESA)
and energy transfer up-conversion (ETU). These mechanisms are repre-
sented schematically in Figure 3.6, and have been described in detail
elsewhere.137–139 In both, upconversion emission occurs from a highly ex-
cited state which has been populated by sequential absorption of photons.
In ESA, each emitting ion sequentially absorbs at least two photons, with
excitation energy resonant with the transition, to reach the UC emitting level
E2 (Figure 3.6a). In ETU, after absorption of one photon by the emitting ion
to reach the metastable level (E1), its second excitation, leading to the
population of the UC emitting level (E2), results from non-radiative energy
transfer from another excited neighbouring ion that relaxes back to ground
state G (Figure 3.6b). The UC eﬃciency of an ETU process is determined by
the average distance between the neighbouring dopant ions, which depends
on the dopant concentration. However, ETU is more eﬃcient than ESA.
Inorganic crystals normally do not show UC luminescence at room tem-
perature. Therefore, luminescent UC materials are typically composed of an
inorganic crystalline, optically transparent, host with low concentrations of
embedded Ln31 dopant ions. The latter act as localised luminescent centres
150
Chapter 3

(called activators). The dopant activator ions upon excitation radiate to a
higher energetic state obtained from non-radiative transfer of energy from
another dopant ion (the donator of the energy is called the sensitiser).
Eﬃcient UC only occurs using a small number of well selected dopant–
host combinations. The host should be able to minimise processes
quenching the Ln31 dopant excited states, for example NaYF4. In order to
generate practically useful UC emission, the Ln31 activator ions should have
multiple and equally spaced intermediate state metastable energy levels in a
ladder-like arrangement to facilitate photon absorption and energy transfer
steps involved in UC processes. Er31, Tm31, and Ho31 have such ladder-like
long-lived (up to 0.1 s, due to low f–f transition probabilities) metastable
excited states and are thus frequently used activators (Figure 3.7). Due to the
low dopant ion concentrations needed to minimise quenching by cross-
relaxation between neighbouring ions, singly doped materials have low UC
eﬃciency. This can be increased by co-doping with a sensitiser ion, which
strongly absorbs at the excitation wavelength and eﬃciently transfers its
energy to the activator by the ETU mechanism for UC luminescence. For
materials using Er31 (o3%) or Tm31 (o0.5%), as activators, Yb31 (18–20%) is
usually used as a suitable sensitiser, due to its eﬃcient NIR absorption and
ETU properties. In fact, Yb31 has an extremely simple energy level scheme
with only one excited 4f level (2F5/2, Figure 3.7). The absorption band of Yb31
at 980 nm (NIR-I), corresponding to the 2F7/2-2F5/2 transition, has a larger
absorption cross-section than that of other Ln31 and resonates eﬃciently
with many f–f transitions of typical UC Ln31 (Er31, Tm31, and Ho31). This
facilitates eﬃcient energy transfer from Yb31 to other ions. A typical UC
material is 18% Yb and 2% Er-doped NaYF4 (NaYF4:Yb31, Er31).138,139

UCNPs have lower luminescent eﬃciency than the corresponding bulk
materials due to their large surface:volume ratio. They are usually coated
with a shell made of an appropriate undoped material, such as silica. This
shell does not allow energy transfer from the core to the surface of the NP,
and thus inhibits quenching of the excited states of the dopant Ln31 by
surface high-energy O–H or N–H oscillators. A typical core–shell UCNP for-
mulation with an undoped shell is [NaYF4:Yb31, Er31] @ NaYF4.138–140
UC cell imaging can be carried out using wide-field confocal microscopy at
a fast imaging rate because sample scanning is not needed. UC can also
be used for in vivo optical animal imaging using visible light emitting UCNPs
(e.g. Er31/Yb31- or Ho31/Yb31-doped systems). Further improvements in
image contrast can be obtained using NIR emitting UCNPs (e.g. Tm31/Yb31-
doped systems with lem ¼ 800 nm following excitation at lex ¼ 980 nm), be-
cause of the low background autofluorescence and deeper light penetration of
both NIR excitation and emission. The long luminescence lifetimes of UCNPs
allow time-gated imaging using pulsed excitation and time-delayed signal ac-
quisition. Delayed acquisition is beneficial because it removes short-lived
(ns lifetime) background signals from light scattered by tissues, giving much

higher signal sensitivity and contrast.122 An example of the application of
UCNPs in in vivo molecular imaging is the use of targeted [NaYF4:Yb31,Er31]
UCNPs conjugated to a peptide to obtain 3D images of tumour tissue.141
A disadvantage of the use of UCNPs is their very narrow excitation window,
which depends on the energy levels of the sensitiser Ln31 ions (e.g. Yb31
with lex ¼ 980 nm). The lex range of UCNPs has been expanded using organic
NIR dyes as antennae to collect NIR light (at 740–850 nm) and induce up-
conversion with increased emission eﬃciency (approximately 3300-fold) due
to increased photon absorption.142 Other types of eﬃcient antenna ma-
terials, such as NIR QDs and Au NPs, have also been used to improve the
optical properties of Ln31-doped UCNPs.143,144
The increased number of optical molecular probes available has prompted
a huge number of studies of cellular processes using fluorescence confocal
microscopy and imaging. In parallel, macroscopic fluorescence imaging has
also developed as a molecular imaging method for in vivo small-animal whole-
body tissue studies. Most of these approaches are based on planar detection of
fluorescent light. This can use the epi-illumination technique, where light
shines on the animal from the same side as the back-emitted light is collected,
or the transillumination technique, where light shines through the volume of
interest and transmitted light is collected in the opposite side.145 However, in
either case, the quantitative information obtained is limited due to the non-
linear dependence of the measured signal intensity on the depth of the probe
location, even using NIR probes. This problem is overcome by fluorescence
molecular tomography (FMT), which maps the 3D distribution of the probe
non-invasively.145,146 The excitation source is scanned over the animal, the
emitted fluorescence intensity is measured for each source position, and 3D
images are obtained by mathematical reconstruction of optical parameters
(tissue absorption coeﬃcient, scattering coeﬃcient, probe distribution).147
The resolution and sensitivity properties of FMT are very dependent on the
dimensions of the animal under study and the wavelengths used for excitation
and emission. For imaging in the NIR region, a resolution of the order of
1 mm at a pM sensitivity can be obtained, but resolution becomes worse with
increasing imaged volume.146
3.3.4
X-ray Computed Tomography Nanoprobes
Ro¨ntgen’s discovery of X-rays and of their penetrating nature in 1895 soon
established their potential for medical imaging. The interaction of X-rays
with matter is quite complex, occurring primarily through interaction of
their oscillating electric field with the atomic electrons in the material.
When an X-ray beam travels across a material, its interaction causes some
of the X-rays to be absorbed, some scattered and, if neither process occurs,
they will be transmitted through the material. Thus, the transmitted beam
intensity (I) that is detected will be reduced according to the equation:
I (E) ¼ I0(E) exp [mp(E)rx]
(3.5)
Imaging Applications of Inorganic Nanomaterials
153

where I0 is the incident beam intensity, mp ¼ (m/r) the mass attenuation co-
eﬃcient of the material (in cm2 g1), m the linear attenuation coeﬃcient,
r the material density, E the X-ray energy and x the material object
thickness. X-ray attenuation is represented quantitatively in Hounsfield
units (HU) ¼ 1000(m  mwater)/(mwater  mair). The Hounsfield scale stand-
ardises the attenuation of a material with reference to water (HU ¼ 0) and air
(HU ¼ 1000).
When absorption occurs (photoelectric absorption), the X-ray transfers all
its energy to an inner shell (K or L) atomic electron, which is then ejected
from the atom when the X-ray energy is higher than the binding energy of
the electron. This leaves a hole which is filled by another higher energy level
electron, as a result of which the atom emits a characteristic X-ray fluo-
rescence photon. The photoelectric eﬀect produces a significant jump in
mass attenuation at K-edge and L-edge energies (Figure 3.8). For X-ray en-
ergies lower than 1 MeV, X-ray scattering occurs both with and without
transfer of part of its energy to an outer shell electron, termed Compton
(or inelastic) and Rayleigh (or elastic) scattering respectively. In the first case,
the X-ray loses some of its energy and changes its direction.
Figure 3.8
Energy dependence of mass attenuation coeﬃcient (m/r) of several
materials relevant in diagnostic X-ray imaging. Mass attenuation de-
creases at a rate of approximately E3 for low energy (approximately 10
to approximately 100 keV) and increases as a function of atomic
number (Z) of the attenuating material as approximately Z3. With
higher Z, the presence of ‘absorption edges’ results from increased
attenuation of X-rays by photoelectric absorption events at energies
equal to the binding energies of electrons in the specific element. This
image was originally published in ref. 148: J. A. Seibert, J. M.

Chapter 3

The ratios of absorption:fluorescence, Compton and Rayleigh scatter
depend on the atomic number (Z) of the material and the X-ray energy (E).
The probability of the photoelectric absorption process is proportional to Z3/
E3, and thus dominates at lower E (o0.1 MeV) and in materials with higher Z.
Bones appear white on an X-ray film because photoelectric absorption
of X-rays is greater in bone (higher Z materials) than in soft tissue (eﬀective Z
approximately 7.5). The probability of absorption decreases rapidly with
photon energy (as E3), while that of scattering decreases slowly (as E1).148
At E40.1–0.5 MeV (depending on Z), Compton scatter dominates, and
the X-ray beam becomes more penetrating at higher energies. The scattering
process is roughly independent of the Z value of the attenuating material,
whereas the absorption process is more probable for tightly bound electrons
such as the inner electrons in high-Z elements. Thus, in CT, to a first ap-
proximation, the photoelectric eﬀect contributes to contrast while the
Compton eﬀect contributes to noise, and both contribute to the dose. In-
creasing the energy is beneficial to the patient because it reduces the radi-
ation dose, but reduces the image contrast because the absorption process
will decrease relative to the scattering process. Thus, there is a trade-oﬀ
between image quality (contrast) and patient dose that must be weighed in
the selection of the energy.
X-ray projection imaging, such as radiography or fluoroscopy, provides
two-dimensional images representing the projection of the attenuation
properties of the human body onto a plane. Each ray from the source gives a
point representing the sum of the attenuation along a line in the body. In the
late 1960s, Geoﬀrey Hounsfield developed X-ray CT, whereby projection data,
obtained from a large number of diﬀerent angles, can be combined to re-
construct, using computational algorithms, the attenuation properties
of each volume element in the body. These are then displayed as
high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the internal structures or
cross-sectional two-dimensional images. Nowadays, CT is one of the most
widely-used imaging techniques in the diagnosis, management, and follow-
up of many acute diseases, in particular trauma and ischemia. It is non-
invasive, painless, relatively low cost, and high-throughput.
However, the contrast between diﬀerent soft tissues is relatively low
because there are no significant diﬀerences in Z values in their atomic
composition. Soft tissue contrast can be generated using extrinsic CAs made
of denser materials, with high Z values and higher absorption coeﬃcients,
especially those with increased X-ray attenuation due to the presence of L
and/or K edges at the normal X-ray energy bandwidth (25–140 KeV)
(Figure 3.8).66–68 Barium (Z ¼ 56) sulfate suspensions are used only in
gastrointestinal (GI) tract CT imaging due to the toxicity of Ba21 ions. Water-
soluble aromatic iodinated compounds (iodine has Z ¼ 53) are safe inject-
able CT CAs, but their applications are limited by their short circulation
time. Progress in the development of CAs for CT has been slow, due to the
low sensitivity of this technique, which requires local mM concentrations for
eﬀective contrast. Most of the materials with high Z value atoms are very
Imaging Applications of Inorganic Nanomaterials
155

toxic at such concentrations. Therefore, nanosized CAs for CT have been
developed, made mainly of metallic gold (Au, Z ¼ 79), tantalum (Ta, Z ¼ 73)
oxide, bismuth (Bi, Z ¼ 83) sulfide, and lanthanide (e.g. Eu, Gd, and Yb,
Z ¼ 63, 64, 70, respectively) oxides.66–68 Au NPs are particularly popular, due
to the higher energy (80.7 KeV) of the K-edge absorption of gold over that of
iodine (33.2 KeV). While iodine causes stronger contrast when scanned at
80 KeV than at 120 KeV, gold absorbs X-rays strongly in the 80–120 KeV
region, and provides a stronger contrast in that region than iodinated CAs. It
also reduces interference from bone and soft tissue absorption and allows
the use of low doses of injected NPs, therefore reducing potential side eﬀects
for patients.69 PEG-coated Au NPs of 30 nm diameter, with long blood cir-
culation half-life, are an eﬀective blood-pool CT CA.149
Spectral CT (also known as dual-energy CT, DECT) is one of the latest
CT imaging advances which uses special detectors that are able to
discriminate X-rays into several energy windows. Thus, contrary to tradi-
tional CT which allows visualisation of one CA at a time, the use of two
diﬀerent X-ray energy settings in spectral CT allows simultaneous identifi-
cation of diﬀerent applied materials in the same scan, and quantitative
imaging of each of them without background signal in living systems.70,71
This is because each material has a characteristic energy-dependent X-ray
attenuation profile and K-edge. This technique can image separately en-
dogenous radiopaque high-Z structures (e.g. bone, calcifications) and ex-
ogenous NPs (e.g. Yb) or diﬀerent NPs directed towards diﬀerent targets.71
3.3.5
Ultrasound Nanoprobes
In ultrasound (US) imaging, images are created using a tool called the trans-
ducer that both emits and receives ultrasound pressure waves. It involves three
steps: (a) the ultrasonic transducer generates pulses of ultrasound waves that
are sent through a patient’s body; (b) as the emitted waves pass through the
tissue, they interact with organ boundaries and complex tissue structures
producing echoes due to reflection or scattering; (c) the backscattered echoes
are received by the same transducer used for transmission of ultrasound waves.
The image is created by digital processing of the properties of the backscattered
sound, including its direction, speed, time of emission, time of arrival at the
transducer, and angle of return. The reconstructed image represents, in a grey
scale, the body or tissue 2D cross-section with the distance, size and density of
each tissue structure originating from the echoes. 3D US images can be ob-
tained by moving the transducer over the surface of the body under study. US
can also be done in Doppler mode, in which changes in the pitch and phase of
the sound wave are used to study velocity and direction of movements inside
the body, such as blood flow in the heart and vasculature.150
The contrast in US images is due to the diﬀerences in the acoustic im-
pedance (echogenicity) of the tissues being imaged. The sound wave fre-
quencies applied for generation and detection are typically above 20 kHz
(above 1 MHz for clinical use), which give frequency-dependent spatial
156
Chapter 3

resolutions of approximately 0.2–1 mm.59 US is the major clinical modality
for soft-tissue imaging: it is safe (non-invasive, non-ionising), accessible, low
cost, with high spatial resolution and excellent temporal resolution (up to
1000 images per second). Its main limitations are the loss of penetration
depth when the spatial resolution increases, high background noise, the
complex acoustic properties of diﬀerent tissues, and the fact that anatomical
structures cannot be distinguished when suﬃcient acoustic contrast be-
tween the tissue constituents is absent. These limitations led to the devel-
opment of exogenous acoustic ultrasound contrast agents (USCAs). The
important requirements for an exogenous material to be considered an
USCA are:151 (i) an easy route of administration, either in the blood pool or
in a cavity; (ii) high stability; (iii) eﬀective elimination from the body; (iv) low
toxicity; and (v) good echogenicity. One example is gas-filled microbubbles
(approximately 1–4 mm diameter), which, upon intravenous injection, are
retained in the vascular space.152 However, the development of much smaller
nano-bubbles capable of extravasation into the extravascular space to reach
tumours is hampered by their poor echogenic properties. Hollow solid
structures have been developed with gas desorption characteristics designed
to improve their US contrast properties through the diﬀerence of ultrasonic
properties between solid and non-solid parts.151 These materials include silica
nanospheres of 100 to 400 nm diameters and multiwalled carbon nanotubes
(MWNTs) 20–30 nm in diameter and 400 nm in length,60–62 which were found
to extravasate from blood vessels in pathologies and showed detectable US
contrast in living animals. Nevertheless, most of these USCAs suﬀer from
instability to US wave pressures, broad size distribution, and relatively poor
circulating acoustic contrast properties.59,152
3.3.6
PAI and PAT Nanoprobes
Photoacoustic imaging (PAI), also known as optoacoustic or thermoacoustic
imaging, is based on the photoacoustic (optoacoustic) eﬀect first described
in 1881 by Bell. This consists of the generation of sound waves after light
absorption within a media. In PAI, an ultra-short pulsed laser is used to
irradiate a tissue. Optical absorption by an endogenous or exogenous
chromophore leads to heat generation and release to the immediate en-
vironment, which undergoes rapid thermoelastic expansion. The sub-
sequent contraction releases a high amplitude, broadband acoustic wave.
These ultrasound waves coming from the irradiated tissue can be detected
using standard US transducers and reconstruction techniques to create
photoacoustic images. Thus, PAI provides high optical contrast at higher
spatial resolution and depths (up to 7 cm) than those typical of US imaging.
Another advantage of PAI is its molecular imaging applications, since optical
absorption is dependent on the molecular structure of the chromophores.
These characteristics are complementary to the anatomical and functional
information given by US imaging. The tomographic version of PAI is
photoacoustic tomography (PAT).

157

The photoacoustic signal intensity, given by the acoustic pressure P(z)
generated at a certain depth z using laser illumination at wavelength l,
depends on the optical-to-acoustic conversion eﬃciency of the media, de-
termined by the number of photons absorbed and the ability of the tissue to
convert this energy to heat and generate the acoustic wave. This governs the
contrast intensity of PAI. Quantitatively, the photoacoustic signal generation
is described by:
P(z) ¼ Fmag
(3.6)
where F is the fluence of laser energy (mJ cm2) at depth z, ma is the optical
absorption coeﬃcient of the absorptive media (cm1) and g is the Gru¨neisen
parameter, which describes the heat transfer properties of the media. The
latter is given by g ¼ (bcs
2/Cp), where b is the thermal expansion coeﬃcient, cs
is the speed of sound and Cp is the heat capacity at constant pressure in the
media. Thermal and stress confinement are the two conditions that must be
met for the photoacoustic eﬀect to occur.153 Thus, for a constant tempera-
ture and laser fluence irradiating the tissue, the photoacoustic signal
strength is proportional to the optical absorption coeﬃcient of the tissue.
As already discussed in Section 3.2.3, PAI can use endogenous CAs present
in tissues, such as haemoglobin, melanin, and lipids, as well as exogenous
dyes or metal-based NPs.63,64 These are systems used as OI probes, such as
plasmonic noble metal (Au, Ag) NPs, semiconducting QDs, and carbon
nanomaterials.65
The proportionality of the photoacoustic signal strength to the optical
absorption coeﬃcient of the tissue depends on the wavelength (l) of the
laser light used, and has been explored to develop spectroscopic PAI. The
optical absorption at a given wavelength of a tissue containing diﬀerent
photo-absorbers also depends on their concentrations. Thus, the analysis
of 2D PAI images obtained at multiple wavelengths can provide the dis-
tribution in a given plane and local concentrations of the tissue photo-
absorbers. For example, functional information, such as the oxygenation of
blood or the presence of atherosclerotic plaques, may be extracted from
multi-wavelength photoacoustic images.154 This multispectral illumination
technique can be translated into multispectral optoacoustic tomography
(MSOT), which can resolve fluorescent agents with molecular specificity
and high resolution (approximately 40 mm) through several millimetres to
centimetres of tissue, going significantly beyond the capabilities of modern
microscopy.155,156

Comparison of Imaging Techniques and Advantages
of Multimodality
In the previous sections, the physical basis of the main imaging modalities
used in pre-clinical molecular imaging research and in clinical imaging were
described, as well as the mechanisms by which nanomaterials can improve

the images obtained. Their characteristics are summarised in Table 3.3,
which shows that each modality has advantages but also intrinsic limi-
tations. This makes it sometimes diﬃcult to obtain accurate and reliable
information at the pathological site.2,12
Spatial resolution is high for MRI and CT, medium for PAI and US, and
lower for PET, SPECT, and OI. However, sensitivity is extremely high in PET
and SPECT, high in OI and PAI, medium in US and MRI, and low in CT.
Temporal resolution is lowest for MRI. Penetration depth is unlimited for
MRI, CT, PET, and SPECT, medium for US and PAI, but is limited to a few
centimetres in OI. The image contrast of soft tissues is better for MRI, PET,
SPECT, and PAI than for CT and US. Other important technical properties
are the possibility of multicolour imaging in OI and PAI, quantitative im-
aging in PET and whole-body imaging in PET, SPECT, MRI, and CT, and real
time imaging in US. There are also other important characteristics which
must be considered for the clinical use of these modalities. Safety is excellent
for MRI, US, OI, and PAI and poorer for CT, PET, and SPECT, due to the
presence of ionising radiation. US, OI, and PAI are easier to use than CT,

MRI, PET, and SPECT. Throughput capacity is high for PAI, medium for US
and OI and low for CT, MRI, PET, and SPECT, while cost is very high for PET
and MRI, high for CT and SPECT and low for US, OI and PAI.
The implications of these technical characteristics for pre-clinical mo-
lecular imaging are evident. For instance, despite the high spatial resolution
of MRI, its use for in vivo imaging of biomarkers is limited by the low in-
trinsic sensitivity. The use of MRI CAs requires a relatively high local con-
centration (about 105 M) to achieve suﬃcient contrast enhancement in T1w
images. Radionuclear (PET and SPECT) and optical imaging modalities are
much more appropriate in this respect, due to their high sensitivity (1010–
1012 M). The amount of a particular type of receptor is typically in the order
of magnitude of 105 per cell, which corresponds to a local CA concentration
in the nM–mM range per cell volume. A strategy to overcome the problems
related to the low intrinsic sensitivity of MRI is to apply targeted CAs, which
deliver a high payload of magnetic centres concentrated in a small volume of
NPs. However, much better procedures involve the design of NPs containing
reporters capable of multimodal detection. Usually, imaging modalities with
high sensitivity (PET, OI, etc.) are combined with others with high spatial
resolution (MRI, CT, etc.), such as in PET/CT or PET/MRI. The tissue pene-
tration limit of OI and PAI probes can be overcome eﬃciently by using
multimodal imaging probes, for instance through OI conjugated to MRI/US/
PET probes. Besides this, the diﬀerent sensitivities of the modalities com-
bined in one NP should be compensated for by the relative concentrations of
the active probe centres in the combined nanoplatforms.
Recently, a large variety of NPs have been developed as probes for multi-
modal imaging.2,3,25,157 Also, virtually all conceivable hybrid preclinical and
clinical imaging systems have been configured, such as in the form of
SPECT/CT, PET/CT, and PET/MRI scanners, allowing for simultaneous
(as opposed to sequential) whole-body imaging. This multimodality ap-
proach is also important for the development of integrated theranostic
platforms4 to be used in pre-operative diagnosis, such as radioscintigraphy
and ultrasonography, intra-operative NIR-I/II fluorescence-guided surgery,
and post-operative monitoring.158

Applications in Bioimaging
In the previous sections, the properties of the diﬀerent types of inorganic
NPs and the techniques used in molecular imaging were discussed. Many
preclinical studies have been reported on the development of NPs for ther-
anostics,4,159 and these are discussed in Chapter 4 of this volume. In this
section, some representative examples of single modality and multimodal
NPs that have reached the level of preclinical in vivo animal imaging studies
have been selected to be presented and discussed. It should be noted that
these represent only a small fraction of the very large body of reported
studies, details of which can be found in exhaustive reviews.

Nanoparticulate MRI CAs
In Section 3.2.1, the main types of NPs used as T1 and/or T2 MRI CAs were
described, their applications having been reviewed previously.12,29,94,160,161
Several kinds of NPs containing paramagnetic nanomaterials responding
only to T1 MRI have been developed, such as silica NPs with Gd-chelates (e.g.
Gd-DTPA, Gd-DOTA) grafted directly on their surface,162,163 small (o10 nm)
NPs made of crystalline Gd31 salts [e.g. Gd2O3, GdPO4, GdF3, NaGdF4,
Gd(OH)3],25–28 Gd31-doped carbon nanomaterials such as gadofullerenes
(e.g. Gd@C60) and gadonanotubes,164 and Mn21-containing NPs.29 Many of
these systems have been tested as preclinical in vivo T1 agents,30,163,165 such as
mesoporous, silica coated, hollow MnO NPs (HMnO@mSiO2) with high r1
relaxivity. They have been used for labelling adipose-derived mesenchymal
stem cells using electroporation, and could be tracked in the mouse brain after
injection by T1w-MRI due to their induced positive contrast (Figure 3.9).165
The most important classes of NPs used as T2 MRI CAs are the para-
magnetic non-Gd lanthanide-based NPs (such as Dy2O3 and Ho2O3 NPs31,161)
and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) NPs,19,94,160 with (r2/r1) approxi-
mately equal to 4–23 (at 0.47 T). SPIO NPs have found clinical applications
especially in liver diseases, such as primary liver tumours or liver metastasis,
because SPIO NPs are selectively taken up by Kupﬀer cells present in the
healthy liver tissue which are absent in pathological tissues. Therefore, a
strong negative contrast is observed between normal and abnormal tissues
in T2w images, showing the pathology as a bright region in the image.160,166
However, the fast uptake of SPIO NPs by the liver shortens their blood life-
time, limiting their use for imaging molecular and biological functions in
in vivo MRI. Several dextran-stabilised iron oxide NP formulations have been
clinically approved, including Ferucarbotran (Resovist or Supravist) and
Ferumoxides (Feridex or Endorem), but many of these nanomaterials are no
longer on the market due to low use in clinical applications.18,19,167
The T2 contrast eﬀect of SPIO NPs can be changed by replacing the Fe21
ions at the octahedral sites of the inverse spinel structure of Fe3O4 with other
divalent transition metal ions, such as Mn21, Co21, Ni21, and Zn21. This
leads to ferrites with very diﬀerent MS values, which strongly aﬀect their r2
values.19,21–23,94
Due to ambiguities sometimes present in MR images using either T1 or T2
CAs, a dual-mode approach has been developed, performing T1w and T2w
MRI simultaneously with the application of T1–T2 dual mode CAs. These can
be designed by using NPs with a single type of contrast material, or with
combined T1 and T2 materials in the same NPs. The first case has been il-
lustrated by Mn21-loaded mesoporous silica nanospheres168 and super-
paramagnetic USPIOs with appropriate size and magnetisation to have low
(r2/r1) of approximately 1.6–2.5 (at 0.47 T),169 providing T2 and T1 contrast.
In the second case, two approaches have been tried: (a) spherical or cubic

superparamagnetic NPs with paramagnetic T1 contrast materials, such as
Gd2O3 (GdIO NPs), Eu2O3, or MnO, to form a paramagnetic core.174,175
Systems with both contrast materials in the same nanoplatform have
some limitations: (a) large hydrodynamic sizes, which may lead to short
blood lifetimes and low colloidal stability; (b) the magnetic fields generated
by each contrast agent material disturb the relaxation process of the other.
Because paramagnetic T1 CAs have low r1 values compared with the r2 of
superparamagnetic T2 agents, the eﬀect of T2 agents on T1 relaxation is much
larger than vice versa. While their interaction is proportional to the inverse

sixth power of their separation distance (d6),176 the resulting qualitative
magnetic resonance tuning (MRET) eﬀects depend on their relative positions
within the NP. For systems with a superparamagnetic T2 core within a
paramagnetic T1 shell, the respective induced magnetic fields oppose one
other, strongly quenching the r1 value. This has been verified experimentally
by increasing the core–shell separation with a silica layer of increasing
thickness,170 or increasing the distance between the core and the pendant
shell paramagnetic complexes through longer spacer groups.173,176 In con-
trast, when the paramagnetic material resides inside the superparamagnetic
iron oxide, the magnetic fields of both materials reinforce each other,
strongly enhancing the r1 value and causing a synergistic T1–T2 enhance-
ment eﬀect.174–176
Dextran-stabilised USPIO NPs have also been clinically approved, such as
Ferumoxtran-10 (Combidex, Sinerem).167 A typical clinical application of
USPIOs is lymph-node imaging, because the very small NPs can be extrava-
sated from the blood vessels into interstitial spaces and then transported to
healthy lymph nodes through the lymphatic vessels. In contrast, nodes that
have been invaded by malignant cells cannot phagocytose the NPs via their
macrophages, and thus do not become dark in T2w images.177 Other appli-
cations of USPIOs are bone marrow imaging, perfusion imaging, and MR
angiography.160,166
3.4.1.2
Radiolabelled Nanoparticles for Nuclear Imaging
(SPECT and PET)
The successful use of radiolabelled NPs for SPECT and PET molecular im-
aging requires careful choice of the appropriate radioisotope and nano-
platform, a suitable radiolabelling
method, and high colloidal and
radiochemical (thermodynamic and kinetic) stability of the radiolabelled
agent.111,113 Most of these issues have been introduced in Section 3.3.2. The
choice of the nanoplatform depends on the specific application, but it must
meet several important criteria, including chemical composition, easily
modifiable surface characteristics, hydrodynamic diameter, ability to con-
jugate diagnostic probes and ligands for active targeting, and colloidal sta-
bility in physiological medium. Several types of inorganic NPs have been
used for radiolabelling. One group includes those which are used as radio-
isotope carriers for unimodal PET and SPECT imaging, such as silica, gold,
ZnO, carbon-based, and metal sulfide NPs. A second includes carrier NPs
with optical properties, such as quantum dots and Ln31-based UCNPs that
can be used in bimodal OI/PET or OI/SPECT, and iron oxide NPs with
magnetic properties useful in PET/MRI and SPECT/MRI. The use of these
radiolabelled NPs for SPECT and PET molecular imaging has been reviewed
in detail elsewhere.111,113,178,179 Here we present some studies of unimodal
PET and SPECT using the first group of NPs and, in Section 3.4.2, some
bimodality examples using the second group.
Imaging Applications of Inorganic Nanomaterials
163

There are not many examples of radiolabelled inorganic NPs using the
most common radionuclides for unimodal SPECT, 99mTc and 111In, as most
studies involve bimodal SPECT/CT. One example involves the evaluation, by
SPECT imaging, of the eﬀect of alternating magnetic field (AMF) therapy on
animal tumours via heating induced by iron oxide NPs (approximately 20 nm
in diameter) coated with PEG-carboxylated dextran and conjugated with
111In-labelled ChL6 antibodies. These systems led to a delay in tumour
growth 48 h post-injection.180
The most common PET radioisotopes used in radiolabelled inorganic NPs
are 64Cu, 68Ga, and 89Zr. Silica carrier NPs [including mesoporous (mSiO2,
MSNPs), coated dense (dSiO2), or hollow mesoporous (HMSNPs) systems]
are biocompatible and well tolerated, and have been extensively radi-
olabelled either through chelate conjugation using siloxane chemistry or by
intrinsic labelling.111 A representative case is the use of 64Cu radiolabelled
MSNPs (approximately 80 nm size) surface conjugated to a TRC105 (IgG1)
monoclonal antibody capable of binding to CD105/endoglin receptor) and a
NOTA chelator for in vivo tumour vasculature targeted PET imaging and
enhanced drug delivery. After administration of the 64Cu-NPs to mice with
murine breast (4T1) carcinoma, in vivo PET imaging showed specific tumour
uptake (approximately 6% ID (injected dose) g1) within 5 h after injection
(Figure 3.10).181 MSNPs have also been radiolabelled with 89Zr using a des-
ferrioxamine (DFO)-based chelator182 to PET image SCID mice with injected
prostate cancer cells. Chelator-free methods have further been developed for
89Zr and 68Ga labelling of MSNPs with high in vivo stability.183,184
Radiolabelled Au NPs have a predominant role in molecular imaging,
especially in cancer detection. For example, Au nanocages of two diﬀerent
sizes (55 nm and 30 nm edge length) were radiolabelled with 64Cu. The re-
sults of in vivo PET imaging studies in normal C57BL/6 mice indicated that
the 30 nm nanocages had a much better biodistribution profile than the
55 nm nanocages, with longer blood half-life retention and lower uptake in
the liver and spleen. The smaller cages also had higher tumour uptake than
the larger ones in mice with a murine EMT-6 breast tumour xenograft.185 In
other work, 68Ga–NOTA-labelled glucose coated Au NPs (2 nm size) have
shown increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability when conjugated
with the Leu-enkephalin neuropeptide relative to non-targeted NPs, as
shown by PET imaging studies after intravenous injection in normal rats.186
Zinc oxide NPs (ZONs) have low toxicity and are biodegradable, and thus
have also been used in radiolabelling studies. For instance, 64Cu–NOTA–
ZONs (approximately 80–100 nm) covered with a coordination polymer, ei-
ther non-targeted or conjugated to the TRC105 antibody to target endothelial
cells, were explored for imaging angiogenesis. The results of PET imaging
studies indicated that the uptake of the targeted 64Cu–NOTA–ZON–PRG–
TRC105 NPs in 4T1 tumours was significantly higher than that of the non-
targeted ZONs, but with high liver and spleen uptake.187

carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) radiolabelled with 64Cu–DOTA was studied by
PET upon injection into human glioma tumour-bearing mice. The pres-
ence of PEG5400 extended the circulation half-life (about 2 h) of the NPs,
with low uptake by the RES, and the RGD peptides improved tumour up-
take relative to analogous non-targeted probes, with no observable
toxicity.188
Nanodots are ultrasmall NPs with interesting applications in tumour
imaging. For example, intrinsically 64Cu-labelled copper sulfide nanodots
([64Cu]CuS) coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (approximately 5.6 nm) had
eﬀective tumour uptake in 4T1 tumours in Balb/c mice and fast renal
clearance, as shown by PET, and also could eﬃciently absorb near-infrared
light for photothermal ablation therapy.189

3.4.1.3
Optical Imaging Nanoprobes
The main families of materials most commonly used as optical imaging
nanoprobes are semiconductor QDs, Au NPs, Ln31–UCNPs, and CNTs,
whose properties have been discussed in Sections 3.2.2 and 3.3.3.35,36,119,122
Here we will consider the main pre-clinical applications of these probes,
presenting a few examples in some detail.
Semiconductor QDs are popular multicolour OI agents.35,38 In particular,
biocompatible Ag2S and Ag2Se QDs emitting in the NIR-II region with high
photochemical quantum yield have been used in small animal im-
aging.127,128,190,191 For example, water-soluble carboxylic acid-terminated
Ag2S QDs of 6 nm size were synthesised, with photoluminescence emis-
sion tuned in the NIR-II range of 510–1221 nm by modulating the growth
time. They were successfully used for in vivo OI of nude mice, with fluo-
rescence at 910 nm distinguished from background autofluorescence.190
NIR-II images of the vasculature of a U87MG brain tumour of a nude mouse
were obtained upon injection of PEGylated Ag2S QDs.191
Noble metal NPs, in particular AuNPs, are very useful to enhance optical
imaging based on their absorption, scattering, fluorescence, and Raman
scattering properties.192 Gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), with diameters of less
than 2–3 nm, displaying highly photostable and strong intrinsic fluo-
rescence, are potent in optical bioimaging. Upon injection of AuNCs into
tumour-bearing nude mice, in vivo optical images of tumour sites were
enhanced and their biodistribution and excretion pathway could be visu-
alised, as a result of their increased penetration and retention in
tumours.193
Rare-earth-doped UCNPs are useful as in vivo NIR molecular imaging
probes.55,126,129,130,140,194,195 As an example, core–shell UCNPs (NaGdF4:3%
Nd/NaGdF4) with an intense and sharp emission spectrum peak at around
900 nm and with large quantum yields (approximately 20%) were sub-
cutaneously injected into a mouse. The resultant in vivo imaging shows
organ localisation with almost no autofluorescence (Figure 3.11).130
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs)43,44 and other carbon-based nanomaterials
(SWCNTs, MWCNTs, graphene, and nanodiamonds)124 have very good
properties for NIR-II biomedical fluorescence imaging. For example, PEGy-
lated SWCNTs injected into mice were used as an NIR-II CA to perform high
frame rate fluorescent video imaging, investigating the path of the CAs
through the mouse body. It was observed in real time that the CAs reached
first the lungs, then the spleen and the liver, followed by the pancreas and
kidneys. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the anatomic resolution
of the organs was dramatically enhanced (Figure 3.12).196
Imaging experiments were carried out in the NIR-IIa (1300–1400 nm)
window using SWCNT-IRDye800 conjugates injected into C57Bl/6 mice.
The reduced photon scattering in this spectral region allowed a depth of over
2 mm to be reached to obtain non-invasive through-skull imaging of the
brain vasculature with sub-10 mm resolution.197

X-ray CT Nanoprobes
NPs used as probes for X-ray CT are materials made with high Z atoms, such
as Au, Ta, Bi, and lanthanides, as described in Sections 3.2.4.2 and 3.3.4.
Their preclinical imaging applications have been reviewed elsewhere.66–69
Here we will present a selection of examples. AuNPs, despite their high cost,
have been the focus of the majority of studies.69 In cardiovascular imaging,
AuNPs (30 nm diameter) with their surfaces modified with PEG were

examined as eﬀective blood pool agents. After intravenous (i.v.) injection of
AuNP–PEG, the agent gave strong contrast in the heart and major arterial
vessels (4100 HU) with long circulation half-life. Long term uptake of the
NPs by Kupfer cells caused attenuation of the liver and spleen, permitting
visualisation of a hepatoma in vivo in a rat model (Figure 3.13).149
Targeted AuNPs have also been used in CT imaging. One example com-
prises a study of the composition of atherosclerotic plaques, using spectral
CT to characterise macrophage burden, calcification, and artery stenosis in a
single CT scan. AuNPs incorporated into a coating similar to high density
lipoprotein (Au–HDL, 7.2 nm) were used to target the macrophage com-
ponent, and co-injected with an iodinated vascular CA in an animal model of
atherosclerosis. A spectral CT scan revealed the aorta, strongly enhanced by
the iodinated compound, distinguished from the Au–HDL localised in the
nearby plaque. The photoelectric eﬀect was used to visualise calcium

CT CAs, for instance in the form of Bi2S3 NPs coated with PEGylated phos-
pholipids (to increase their hydrophilicity), and conjugated with targeting
peptides. These have shown higher CT signal enhancement at a tumour than
unlabelled NPs after i.v. injection into a tumour-bearing mouse.199

Nanoprobes for Ultrasound Imaging
All commercially manufactured ultrasound enhanced contrast agents
(UECAs) are microbubbles or variations with lipid, polymer, or protein shells
encapsulating either air (Albunex, Levovist, Sonovist) or perfluorocarbon gas
(Definity, Optison).200 However, due to their large size (1–8 mm), they are
restricted to vasculature imaging, e.g. in stem cell tracking. Inorganic
UECAs, such as silica nanospheres and carbon nanotubes, provide the
possibility to produce smaller particles with good biocompatibility and
stability, which could have wider applications such as in cancer manage-
ment (Sections 3.2.3 and 3.3.5).59–62 Some examples of these applications are
presented here.
One of the very first reports of the use of functionalised multiwalled car-
bon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as hyperechogenic materials demonstrated that
the US signal of those CNTs was equal to that of a commercially available
contrast agent (SF6-SonoVue). In vivo studies demonstrated that MWCNTs
have no toxic eﬀects after seven days and can be observed at low frequencies
in pigs’ bladders.201 Functionalisation of MWCNTs was performed by sur-
face modification with polyethylenimine (PEI) and further conjugation with
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and prostate stem cell antigen monoclonal
antibody (mAbPSCA). The CNT-PEI(FITC)-mAb showed high biocompati-
bility and enhanced cellular uptake in PC-3 (PSCA-overexpressed) and MCF-7
(PSCA-low-expressed) cells, promoted by the conjugated antibody. In vivo US
imaging experiments performed in nude mice bearing a PC-3 tumour (pro-
state cancer animal model) showed much higher US signal enhancement of
the tumour site after tail vein injection of the targeted CNT, relative to an
analogous non-targeted CNT. Pre-treatment with free mAbPSCA causes a
marked decrease in contrast enhancement due to the blocking of the PSCA
binding sites by the free mAbPSCA (Figure 3.14).61
Gas filled hollow boron-doped silica NPs have been developed for US-
guided breast conservation therapy. These hollow NPs were synthesised
using a template consisting of polystyrene nanospheres, which were coated
with boron-doped silica, subsequently calcined to create hollow rigid
nanoporous microspheres, and finally filled with perfluoropentane gas.
In vitro studies showed that they can be continuously imaged by US for up to
48 min, with a signal lifetime persistence of 5 days. Thus, they can be used as
a screening tool to detect smaller breast cancers before they can be seen in
traditional mammography.202
CaCO3 NPs were prepared inside a flexible and biocompatible pluronic-
based nanocarrier. This nanosized UECA was stable in serum-containing

media and was able to generate CO2, particularly at low pH, allowing its
detection by US imaging. After i.v. injection of the UECA into tumour bearing
mice, a significant US contrast enhancement was observed at the tumour
site after 1 h, while there was no change in the liver. This was followed by a
24 h clearance from the body.203
3.4.1.6
Nanoprobes for Photoacoustic Imaging
The types of inorganic NPs developed as extrinsic CAs for molecular PAI
studies have been discussed in Section 3.2.3 and reviewed in the litera-
ture.63,64,204 AuNPs are the most commonly employed CAs for PAI due to
their strong plasmon absorption, which can be tuned in the visible and NIR
regions.205 NPs explored include nanospheres206 and more complex shaped
structures like nanorods,207,208 nanocages,209 nanoshells,210 nanostars,211 etc.

Other probes that have been used are semiconductor QDs,212 CuS NPs,213
UCNPs,214 and carbon NPs (graphene61 and CNTs215). All these systems have
been successfully employed in preclinical studies to image cancer lesions, the
vasculature, sentinel lymph nodes and atherosclerotic plaques. Here, we will
discuss a few representative examples.
Au nanorods have been used to image several types of ovarian cancer tu-
mours in mice xenografts, obtaining a 2.3-fold increase of the PA signal by
intratumoural injection of the nanorods and excitation at 756 nm, which in-
creased to 3.5-fold with i.v. injection.207 CuS NPs have several advantages
relative to plasmonic Au NPs. They display optical absorption tuneable

(diametero15 nm), which is useful for imaging extravascular tumour cells.
PEG-coated CuS NPs were injected intracranially into a mouse and in vivo PAI
contrast of the deeply located brain sagittal and transverse sinuses was ob-
tained at 1064 nm. The superficial vascular structures were not observed, as
they give PAI contrast at 532 nm (green), which is specific for haemoglobin.213
In another example, i.v. injection of PEGylated SWCNTs conjugated
with c-RGD peptides targeting avb3 integrin caused an eightfold increase of
the PA signal in mice bearing U87MG gliobastoma relative to non-targeted
SWCNTs.215
3.4.2
Agents for Dual and Higher-modality Imaging
The main characteristics of the basic imaging modalities (Table 3.3) and the
advantages of optimising their properties in multimodal imaging nano-
platforms have been briefly discussed in Section 3.3.7. While the develop-
ment of hybrid multimodality scanners (e.g. PET/CT and PET/MRI) has been
quite fast, the development of multimodal imaging NPs is complicated, as it
is not easy to balance the advantages and disadvantages of the diﬀerent
imaging techniques in a single chemical entity. For instance, it is necessary
to balance factors such as detection sensitivity and temporal resolution
(high in PET, SPECT, OI, PAI, and US) with image spatial resolution (high in
MRI and CT). The tissue penetration limit of OI can also be overcome by
conjugation to MRI, PET, US, or PAI. Combining in one probe diﬀerent
nanomaterials active in modalities with very diﬀerent sensitivities is usually
achieved by using diﬀerent concentration ratios. A very large number of
multimodality imaging NPs has been reported and reviewed.2,4,10,25,157 Here
we discuss only some critical examples of the main combined modalities.
3.4.2.1
Dual Probes Involving CT or MRI with SPECT or PET
The complementary bimodality combinations SPECT/CT, PET/CT, SPECT/
MRI, and PET/MRI are all quite popular. The first two hybrid techniques
usually involve NPs consisting of high X-ray absorption materials labelled
with SPECT or PET radioisotopes.111 An example of probes for SPECT/CT
used 99mTc(DTPA) to label dendrimer-entrapped Au NPs (99mTc–Au DENPs),
Imaging Applications of Inorganic Nanomaterials

with hydrodynamic radius of 50.4  3.2 nm. Surface modification of the
dendrimer via acetylation or hydroxylation gave particles with diﬀerent
biodistribution profiles, which allowed preferential imaging of diﬀerent
mouse organs by micro-SPECT/CT.216 Another example is the hydrophilic
PEG-coated EuOF:153Sm, where the 153Sm31 SPECT-active dopant is com-
bined with the high X-ray absorption of Eu. These NPs (with a core diameter
of approximately 5 nm) showed a large CT contrast enhancement of the
lymph node 20 min after injection into a mouse (Figure 3.15). These NPs had
a blood half-life of 4.56 h and eﬃcient hepato-biliary elimination, as shown
by their dynamic distribution obtained in vivo from the time dependence of
the SPECT images.217
The wide availability of PET/CT scanners has led to the development of
suitable bimodality probes, many of which are Au NPs radiolabelled with
PET tracers.111 One example is a core–shell NP with a gold shell (8–10 nm)
around a silica spherical core (110–120 nm) conjugated with the 64Cu(DOTA)
chelate, which was used for PET/CT imaging in nude rats bearing a head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma xenograft.218 In another study, hollow Au
nanospheres (diameter 40 nm) were conjugated with the cRGD peptide for
integrin avb3 targeting and radiolabelled with 64Cu(DOTA). PET/CT imaging
of a rabbit VX2 liver cancer model that had received injections of these
radiolabelled NPs demonstrated that their liver tumour targeting could be
improved using intra-arterial administration and by mixing the NPs with the
iodised oil lipiodol.219 Other PET tracers, such as 89Zr, have also been used,
e.g. 89Zr-labelled anti-CD105 endoglin antibody targeted Au NPs (5 nm).

Chapter 3

Quantitative in vivo PET/CT of an animal tumour model revealed that tu-
mour uptake of the immunoconjugates lasted up to 24 h after injection, with
high tumour contrast and selective tumour targeting.220
SPECT/MRI and PET/MRI are also powerful hybrid techniques, especially since
the recent development of simultaneous PET/MRI scanners,99 which has accel-
erated the development of novel bimodal magnetic radiotracers.2,10,19,25,111
Suitable hybrid NPs contain a magnetic component, which could comprise ei-
ther superparamagnetic materials (such as SPIONs or ferrites) or paramagnetic
materials (Gd- or Mn-based) to act as T2- and T1-MRI CAs. These NPs are then
radiolabelled
with
SPECT
or
PET
radioisotopes,
either
by
surface-
functionalisation with chelating agents such as DOTA, NOTA, DTPA, bis(dithio-
carbamatebisphosphonate) (DTCPB), and DFO, or by intrinsic labelling.
SPIONs have been labelled with a variety of radioisotopes for simul-
taneous
SPECT/MRI
(e.g.
99mTc
and
111In).221,222
In
one
example,
99mTc–DPA–ale–Endorem NPs were synthesised containing dipicolylamine
(DPA)–alendronate, a bisphosphonate system which binds to 99mTc. This
was coordinated directly to Endorem (a liver MRI CA based on dextran-
coated SPIONs with 5 nm size) through strong bisphosphonate interactions
with the iron atoms. Injection of these NPs into mice followed by MRI and
microSPECT–CT imaging confirmed their stability and co-localisation in the
liver and spleen in vivo.221
The first reported example of a PET/MRI nanoprobe involved the synthesis
of polyaspartic acid-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (5 nm size) which were
PEGylated, linked with a cRGD peptide for integrin avb3 targeting, and
surface labelled with 64Cu(DOTA) (hydrodynamic diameter 45 nm). In vivo
microPET and T2w MRI showed integrin specific delivery of the radiolabelled
NPs to a U87MG gliobastoma tumour in mice, with a maximum uptake at 4 h
post injection. The RES uptake of the NPs was also quite high.223
Using the same concept described above for 99mTc labelling of SPIONs, the
bifunctional bisphosphonate chelator (DTCBP)2 was used to radiolabel SPIONs
with 64Cu by directly binding to their surfaces. As a model system, clinically
available Endorem labelled with 64Cu(DTCBP)2 was used as an eﬀective dual
in vivo MRI/PET imaging probe to detect lymph nodes.224 Intrinsically labelled
SPION NPs have also been prepared using fast and highly specific chelator-free
approaches.111 69Ge–SPION@PEG NPs obtained in this way were shown to be
an eﬀective agent for animal lymph-node mapping using in vivo PET/MRI.225
Besides the radiolabelled T2 MRI contrast materials, NPs containing
paramagnetic T1 MRI contrast materials based on Gd31 or Mn21 have also
been radiolabelled for bimodal imaging.111,226 Water soluble human serum
albumin (HSA)-coated MnO NPs coupled with 64Cu(DOTA) were used for
dual modality PET/MRI in U87MG murine xenografts.227
3.4.2.2
Dual MRI/CT Probes
The use of bimodal NPs combining these techniques with high spatial
resolution is justified by the low CT contrast between two adjacent soft

tissues or with blood or other physiological fluids. This issue can be over-
come by MRI, which explains the importance of MRI/CT for clinical appli-
cations.27,226 Gold, iodine, and Ln31 materials are used in CT CAs due to
their high X-ray attenuation coeﬃcients, while paramagnetic Ln31 ions like
Gd31, with a large number of unpaired electrons, are eﬃcient MRI CAs.
Gd2O3 NPs coated with iodinated compounds have been shown to be an
eﬀective in vivo T1–T2 MRI/CT contrast agent in mice.228 Gd-decorated Au
NPs are also popular MRI/CT agents, such as a copolymer functionalised
with Gd(DOTA) grafted onto AuNPs229 and PEGylated Dy-doped NaGdF4 NPs
(PEG–NaGdF4:Dy) as T1–T2-weighted MRI/CT imaging agents.230
3.4.2.3
Dual OI or PAI and US Probes
Bimodal probes combining OI or PAI with the other imaging modalities
discussed in this chapter can be designed by combining optical or photo-
acoustic materials with X-ray absorbing, magnetic, nuclear, or acoustic
materials in a single platform. The most used optical and photoacoustic
materials are AuNPs, QDs, Ln–UCNPs, and carbon NPs.10,12,64 These can be
applied in OI/PAI combinations, as they show good PAI contrast and can be
used for fluorescence imaging. The number of possible modality combin-
ations is large, and here we will discuss some representative examples from
the many available in the literature.2,25,111,178,226 Earlier in this chapter we
have discussed the multifunctional capabilities of Au NPs in diﬀerent im-
aging modalities, either directly in CT, OI, and PAI, or as carriers of MRI or
PET/SPECT probes. Their SPR optical properties and high Z value make Au
NPs ideally suited as bimodal OI/CT probes, combining the high sensitivity
of the former with the unlimited depth penetration of the later.
In one embodiment of this approach, Au NPs were modified with glycol
chitosan (GC) polymers to provide biocompatibility and stability, and the
NIR fluorescent dye Cy5.5 was adsorbed using a GC-conjugated matrix me-
talloproteinase (MMP)-cleavable peptide for OI. The in vivo accumulation of
NPs in a mouse tumour resulted in the recovery of the fluorescence of Cy5.5
due to its release via selective degradation of the peptide by overexpressed
MMP, which neutralised the quenching eﬀect of the Au NPs on the dye. This
resulted in tumour visualisation by dual contrast in OI/CT imaging.231 The
use of AuNPs as dual PAI/CT CAs was additionally investigated by using
cinnamon-coated NPs; these accumulated in breast cancer and prostate
cancer cells, allowing the detection of PAI signals, while the attenuation
eﬀect of the NPs gave CT contrast.232
OI/MRI probes are the most studied dual-modality imaging agents asso-
ciating magnetically and optically active components.161,226,233,234 Optical
materials such as AuNPs, semiconductor or graphene QDs, luminescent
Ln31 chelates, Ln–UCNPs or organic dye-labelled mesoporous silica NPs
(MSNs) can be conjugated with Gd31 or Mn21 complexes or inorganic
matrixes, or with iron oxide magnetic materials, for T1 or T2 contrast
respectively.
174
Chapter 3

Au NPs have been surface-conjugated with Gd31chelates226,235 and bi-
functional Au and iron oxide nanocomposites236 have been reported for
OI/T1w or T2w MRI, respectively. A popular alternative strategy for the for-
mation of OI/MRI agents uses quantum dots (QDs) conjugated with Gd31
chelates226 or iron oxide NPs,25,237,238 among others. An example of the first
approach is the in vivo use of glutathione coated CdSeTe/CdS NIR QDs
functionalised with Gd(DOTA).239 Another is a graphene QD conjugated to
iron oxide NPs (GQD)@Fe3O4@SiO2), functionalised with folic acid for
cancer targeting and loaded with doxorubicin for therapy. This agent al-
lowed in situ monitoring of cellular uptake and drug release using fluo-
rescence resonance energy transfer.240
Luminescent Ln31 ions can be used together with magnetic materials in
various ways. One possibility is to use magnetite NPs or Au–magnetite NPs as
the magnetically active component, which is surface functionalised for
conjugation
to
luminescent
Ln31
complexes
for
OI/T2w
MRI.234,237
Lanthanide-doped inorganic matrixes, such as hollow Gd2O3:Eu31 nano-
composites, have been reported as innovative two-photon sensitised OI/T1w
MRI probes for real-time drug release monitoring.241 Another approach is
based on Ln–UCNP-based MRI/OI dual-modality, and has recently achieved
remarkable
success.161
For
example,
folic
acid
targeted
NaGdF4:Yb/
Tm@SiO2@TiO2 nanocomposites were found to be useful for both in vivo
T1w MRI and NIR-responsive photodynamic therapy (PDT).242 UCNPs can be
coupled with superparamagnetic NPs without disrupting the respective op-
tical or magnetic properties,25,237 using a layer-by-layer self-assembly
method243 or by synthesis of core–shell nanoparticles.244
In the first case ultrasmall iron oxide NPs (USPIO) were deposited at the
surface of small UCNPs (Y/Yb/Er ¼ 69:30:1), and the resulting nanocompo-
site was coated with Au NPs. The resulting UCNP–USPIO–AuNPs were shown
to
be
eﬀective
CAs

when

iron oxide shell with a thickness of 5 nm onto a NaYF4:Tm31,Yb31 core
generated
by
the
thermal
decomposition
of
Fe(acetylacetone)3.
The
NaYF4:Tm31,Yb31@FexOy NP products possessed high r2 relaxivity and NIR-
to-NIR UC, which was used for the in vivo mouse imaging of tumour and
lymph nodes (Figure 3.16).244
Silica NPs have been doped with organic dyes like indocyanine green and
conjugated with paramagnetic Gd31-chelates for OI/T1w MRI.245 Alter-
natively, hybrid SiO2@APS/Gd(DTPA) NPs (APS ¼ 3-aminopropyltriethoxy-
silane) doped with Eu31 or Tb31 at the surface by complexation were rapidly
and eﬃciently captured by RAW 264.7 cells, and exhibited enhanced T1w
MRI contrast and potential for optical tracking of cellular pellets.246
Bimodal PAI/MRI NPs have been developed by combining optical ma-
terials such as Au, QDs, or Ln–UCNPs with Gd31 or iron oxide magnetic
materials, yielding composites such as Fe3O4@SiO2@Au NPs.64 An example
of a PAI/MRI dual imaging nanoprobe consists of gadolinium oxysulfide-
coated gold nanorods (GNRs@Gd2O2S) stabilised with a polyvinyl alcohol

(PVA) layer. Increasing the Gd2O2S shell thickness increased the eﬀective
dielectric constant surrounding the plasmonic core, resulting in a red-shift
of the longitudinal LSPR mode. The PAI and MRI response of the nanop-
robe were studied in vitro and in vivo. Intratumoural injection of the NPs
into Hep G2 tumour-bearing BALB/c nude mice provided a fourfold in-
crease in PAI signal and a twofold increase in positive (T1) MRI contrast.247
Another example comprises NPs with a 60 nm average diameter consisting
of a ferromagnetic cobalt core thinly coated with gold to impart bio-
compatibility and a unique shape enabling optical absorption over a broad
range of frequencies. This system was found to provide strong PAT and T2w
MRI contrast.248
The combination of optical with nuclear materials in a single NP permits
additional information to be obtained in dual OI/PET(SPECT) imaging,
combining the deep-tissue high-sensitivity of the radioisotope quantitative
data to give short timepoint dynamic tracer information with biodistribution
data from OI.25,111,178 A very important application of OI/PET(SPECT) agents
is for image-guided surgery, in which nuclear imaging is used to determine
tumour localisation and OI is used intraoperatively to define the pathology
regions and guide surgical removal.249

Chapter 3

Radiolabelling of optically active NPs with PET or SPECT probes focused
initially on chelator-based techniques using surface modification of the NPs.
A typical example is a CdTe@ZnS QD (maximum emission 705 nm) labelled
with a cyclic RGD peptide and conjugated with 64Cu(DOTA). This was ef-
fective for in vivo targeted dual-modality PET/near-infrared fluorescence
(NIRF) imaging of integrin avb3 in the tumour vasculature of U87MG
tumour-bearing mice (Figure 3.17).250
Recently research has turned towards studying intrinsically labelled NPs
without structural modifications, since the latter could change their prop-
erties. For example, 64Cu-labelled Au nanoclusters (approximately 2.5 nm
diameter) were synthesised by doping the radioisotope through a cation-
exchange reaction using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a template. Besides
being a PET imaging tracer, 64Cu also causes Cerenkov resonance energy
transfer (CRET), functioning as an energy donor to excite the Au na-
noclusters for self-illuminating NIR fluorescence imaging without the need
for external excitation photons. The radiolabelled nanocluster was stable
and biocompatible and showed eﬃcient in vivo OI/PET properties when
injected into U87MG tumour bearing mice, with high tumour uptake and
good tumour CRET NIR images.251 The same strategy was used to prepare
64Cu-labelled QDs.252
PAI/PET(SPECT) probes can also be designed using the same strategies.

PET images was found.253 Radiolabelling optically active NPs with SPECT
active radioisotopes, such as 153Sm or 111In, provides OI/SPECT bimodal
probes, for instance 153Sm-doped NaLuF4:Yb,Tm UCNPs.254
US imaging materials can be combined with materials active in other
modalities to obtain bimodal US probes. As an example, Au NPs have been
used as US/PAI bimodal probes of macrophage cell phantoms.255
3.4.3
Agents for Higher-modality Imaging
The simplest way to design trimodal imaging agents is to radiolabel an OI/
MRI agent with a radioisotope for PET or SPECT, obtaining PET(SPECT)/
MRI/OI probes and providing a large number of possible combinations.256
Mesoporous silica NPs with an incorporated NIR dye (ZW800) were labelled
with Gd(DOTA) and 64Cu(DOTA) chelates, and the composites were found to
be stable in vitro. The radiolabelled NPs were used for multimodality
PET/MRI/OI imaging of sentinel lymph nodes in mice.257 A cobalt ferrite
conjugated with rhodamine within a silica shell matrix was radiolabelled
with 67Ga(NOTA) and conjugated with the AS1411 aptamer that targets nu-
cleolin (a cellular membrane protein highly expressed in cancer). The re-
sultant platform was used to track C6 cancer cells in mice using SPECT/MRI/
OI in vivo imaging.258 Alternatively, a UCNP derivative can be used as the
optical material. An Er31- and Yb31-doped NaGdF4 UCNP was radiolabelled
with 124I for PET imaging and integrin-targeted using surface RGD peptides
for angiogenesis imaging.259
The common sensitivity limitations of MRI and CT imaging modalities
can be overcome by combining them with OI, which can provide three-
dimensional tissue details with high sensitivity and cellular resolution.
Hybrid Au–Gd(DTPA) nanoclusters are suitable for trimodal MRI/CT/OI
imaging due to the X-ray absorbance, magnetic and optical properties of the
components. These NPs were shown to eﬀectively accumulate in MCF
tumour tissue in mice and undergo rapid renal excretion.260 However, MRI/
CT/OI NPs based on Ln UC optical nanomaterials are the most popular.
Among the many examples available,226 are trimodal imaging agents, such
as NaLuF4:Yb31,Tm31@SiO2–GdDTPA nanoparticles for NIR-to-NIR UC
luminescence, CT and T1w MRI tri-modality imaging in vivo.261
Magnetic and acoustic materials have been combined in a single nano-
platform, leading to a variety of trimodal NPs. An US/MRI/OI probe has been
reported, consisting of theranostic mesoporous SiO2 NPs (MSNs) labelled
with an organic fluorophore, conjugated to Gd(DOTA), and loaded with an
insulin-like growth factor (IGF), which contributed to increased cell survival
in cardiac stem cell therapy. The induced US and T1w MRI contrast was used to
guide cell implantation into the peri-infarct zone, avoiding the necrotic tissue
in nude mice.262 Stem cell therapy was also monitored in mice by labelling
them with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) based iron oxide nanobubbles con-
taining the 1,10-dioctadecyl-3,3,30,30-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide
(DiR) fluorophore (185 nm diameter) as a trimodal contrast agent for a
178
Chapter 3

US/PAI/MPI approach.263 In another application trimodal MRI/PAI/surface
enhanced Raman scattering NPs were prepared, composed of a 60 nm Au core
covered with a Raman molecular tag [trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)-ethylene] and
coated by a 30 nm silica layer conjugated to Gd(DOTA). Upon i.v. injection of
the PRs into glioblastoma-bearing mice, their specific accumulation in the
tumour permitted non-invasive delineation through the intact skull using the
three imaging modalities.264
3.5
In Vivo Biodistribution, Excretion, and Toxicity of
Nanomaterials
It is clear from the previous sections that many kinds of single- and multi-
functional NPs have been developed for biomedical imaging applications.
However, in order to reach clinical translation, several important conditions
must be met: (i) finding the best administration route; (ii) optimising tar-
geting selectivity with minimal non-specific uptake, ensuring a favourable
physiological biodistribution; (iii) controlling possible metabolism to
clearable products; (iv) ensuring eﬀective clearance of NPs from the human
body with appropriate half-life; and (v) minimising potential toxicity for
living subjects and humans.1,11,12,265 The physiological, pharmacokinetic
and in vivo toxicity profiles of NPs can be optimised by varying their physi-
cochemical properties, such as size (i.e. hydrodynamic diameter, HD),
composition, shape, flexibility, surface charge, and hydrophobicity.266,267
Multifunctional NPs have been reported for oral, pulmonary, ocular,
transdermal, and trans blood–brain barrier (BBB) delivery. However, because
these routes generally present diﬀerent challenges, intravenous injection is
the preferred route for delivery of NPs as biomedical imaging agents. Due to
the small (o6 nm) average pore size of normal capillaries, extravasation and
equilibration of NPs between the intravascular and extravascular spaces is
usually slow, sometimes restricting their in vivo biodistribution and aﬀecting
their clearance.266,267 An organic coating surrounding the NPs can play a very
important role in their biodistribution. NP surface charge can increase the
HD of NPs by non-specific adsorption of plasma proteins (mostly albumin),
increasing their opsonisation and limiting their extravasation. NPs also tend
to be rapidly eliminated from the blood through uptake by the RES. The RES
is composed of phagocytic cells, primarily monocytes and macrophages,
located in the reticular connective tissue of the liver, spleen, and bone
marrow. These organs have large (up to 150 nm) endothelial pores in their
vessels, which facilitate uptake of large NPs. Appropriate surface modifi-
cation of the NPs using biocompatible, hydrophilic (e.g. zwitterionic), and
neutral polymers, such as PEG, can prevent opsonisation and slow their
uptake into the RES, facilitating their eﬃcient clearance
from the
body.1,11,265
NPs can be designed to reach cells in pathological tissues through passive
or active targeting. Passive targeting is based on the enhanced permeability

and retention (EPR) eﬀect, in which tumours larger than 1 mm diameter (or
tissues undergoing inflammation) accumulate NPs injected into the blood-
stream because they generate a poorly diﬀerentiated and much leakier
neovasculature (neoangiogenesis) than that present in healthy tissues. This
arises due to the deficient alignment and packing of the endothelial cells in
their capillary walls.268 Thus, large NPs circulating in the bloodstream
cannot enter easily healthy tissues, but they can leak into tumour tissues.269
Tumours also have a dysfunctional lymphatic drainage system which is
much less eﬃcient in clearing accumulated NPs. Although the EPR eﬀect
may be eﬀective for detecting a primary tumour or large vascularised me-
tastases, it misses malignant cells in micrometastases. It is also very het-
erogeneous and unpredictable in preclinical animal models.
Active targeting uses NPs with surface-bound ligands (e.g. peptides, anti-
bodies) which bind specifically and with high aﬃnity to receptors, trans-
porters or other biomarkers that are overexpressed in tumours. The NPs
distribute into the extracellular space of every tissue (both healthy and tu-
mourous) and organ and are retained in the tumour, while those that do not
bind to malignant cells are eliminated from the body. Active targeting in-
creases the total accumulation of NPs at the tumour through a specific but
slower process than EPR.1,11 However, active targeting of NPs has important
limitations, including complex and expensive synthesis routes, the presence
of additional cell layers between endothelial and tumour cells, the high tu-
mour cellular density, and the high interstitial fluid pressure in tumours. All
of these factors make tumour tissue diﬃcult to reach and penetrate.270
Clearance of intravenously administered NPs occurs mostly using renal
(urine) and hepatobiliary (bile to faeces) routes. Renal filtration of the blood
occurs in the glomerular basement membrane, with a physiological pore
diameter smaller than 6 nm. Rigid and globular-shaped NPs with an HD of
less than 6 nm can be renally excreted but larger NPs are not, showing long
blood half-lives. The latter can be metabolised to clearable components or be
removed from the blood by the RES. This leads to rapid uptake in the liver
and spleen and excretion through the hepatobiliary route, resulting in long
residence times in the body.1,11,267
Organic NPs can be designed from biocompatible and biodegradable
materials, allowing them to be metabolised into components which can be
eliminated from the body, although quite slowly in many cases. However,
this approach is much more diﬃcult for inorganic NPs. The possible toxicity
of inorganic NPs is the most important factor limiting their potential use for
biomedical treatment. Their reported cell toxicity depends on many factors,
such as chemical composition and morphology, incubation conditions, type
of cells and assay used.271 For example, inorganic NPs containing metal
elements such as Gd, Cd, Se, Te, As, and Pb (e.g. QDs) or their complexes are
known to have acute or chronic toxicity in humans, including im-
munotoxicity and carcinogenicity.1,266 Even carbon-based nanotubes show
biological toxicity due to their shapes.78,272 Several general cytotoxicity
mechanisms induced by cell exposure to inorganic NPs have been reported,
180

such as generation of reactive oxygen species, deformation of cell morph-
ology and induction of cytoskeleton defects (especially at high payload up-
take), interference with intracellular signalling pathways, genotoxicity, and
intracellular release of toxic metal ions upon degradation of NPs.273 The
application of inorganic materials in clinical diagnostics requires a com-
prehensive assessment of their potential toxicity issues.274,275
3.6
Examples of Clinical Trials
The conditions that determine a successful translation of NPs to diagnostic
clinical trials are slowly emerging. Some success has occurred with soft
(organic) NPs for drug delivery systems, such as Doxil and Onivyde,276 but
progress with inorganic and multimodal imaging NPs has been much
slower.277 In this category, the iron oxide NPs have been the most studied
and some of them, like Endorem and Resovist, have been used in clinical
settings as MRI T2 CAs.278 However, after some time they were discontinued
because their routine use was not widespread. In this category, Ferumoxytol
(carbohydrate-coated iron oxide NPs), originally used as an MRI T2 CA and
still used for the treatment of iron deficiency, is now being studied as a
radiolabelled PET/MRI bimodal imaging agent.
In the field of bimodal OI/PET probes, Cornell Dots (C-dots) had the most
successful translation to phase II clinical trials.279 C-dots are small (6–7 nm
size) fluorescent silica NPs containing the organic Cy5 optical dye, modified
with PEG, and functionalised with the peptide cyclo-(Arg–Gly–Asp–Tyr) as a
targeting vector for cancer neoangiogenesis. These NPs are then radi-
olabelled with 124I (a long-lived PET emitter) forming 124I–cRGDY–PEG–C
dots for OI/PET imaging. The small size of the NPs allowed safe and eﬀective
renal excretion with no toxicity issues. Preferential uptake and localisation of
124I–cRGDY–PEG–C dots at disease sites were observed in PET imaging of a
human metastatic melanoma.279
Another ongoing phase II clinical trial is on activation and guiding of ir-
radiation by X-rays (AGuIX) using NPs consisting of polysiloxane NPs (ap-
proximately 5 nm diameter) surface-conjugated to Gd(DOTA) for MRI-guided
radiosensitisation of brain metastases.280,281 Radiolabelled derivatives (68Ga
and 89Zr) of those NPs were also obtained in order to collect PET/MRI data
for the trials.282,283
3.7
Conclusions and Perspectives
This chapter illustrates many ‘proof-of-principle’ preclinical examples of
how inorganic NPs show very useful characteristics for molecular imaging
not provided by small-molecule agents. However, their translation into
clinical imaging and therapy is still very rare, as optimisation of inorganic
nanoplatforms for clinical use is challenging. The best systems for clinical
development involve NP sizes smaller than 10 nm (allowing renal clearance)
if designed for active targeting, while those undergoing passive targeting by

the EPR eﬀect, or targeting the liver or lungs, can have larger sizes. In any
case, the formation of protein coronas on the NPs’ surface must be taken
into consideration, as it changes their in vivo behaviour. Delivery by direct
i.v. injection remains preferable as the route of administration.1 The ma-
terials undergoing clinical trials can provide useful insights to inform the
development of new systems. They have shown how multimodal imaging
can provide useful information for the translation process. The most active
areas in the translation of inorganic NPs for imaging applications are image-
guided hyperthermia (thermal ablation), optically guided intraoperative
surgery, and image-guided radiation sensitisation.
The future development of new NPs may use less explored techniques, like
ultrasound-modulated fluorescence (UMF) bioimaging,284 new imaging
combinations, and multifunctionalities that could be useful in clinical ap-
plications, such as patient staging and monitoring of response to therapy.

Introduction
Recently, theranostics, the combination of therapy and diagnosis, has become
a very widely studied research area. It combines a therapeutic and diagnostic
element in a single formulation, with the goal of simultaneously treating a
disease and monitoring its progress. This should enable more eﬀective treat-
ment, because, for instance, the dose can be adjusted in real time in response
to knowledge of how the disease has progressed. Theranostics have been
particularly widely explored in cancer research. Rapid development of nano-
biotechnology has led to the emergence of many theranostic strategies for
combating tumours and various other pathological abnormalities.1–3
Continuing progress in nanomedicine depends on advances in materials
chemistry allowing scientists to fabricate well-defined nanosystems with con-
trollable structures, compositions, morphologies, physicochemical properties,
and biological eﬀects.2,4 Such integration between materials chemistry and
medicine will lead to the development of nanomedicines with diverse func-
tions for theranostics.5 As far as cancer treatment is concerned, it is hoped that
imaging would not only oﬀer information regarding the exact tumour location,

size, shape, and its relationship with surrounding tissues, but also enable
real-time monitoring of therapeutic agents. This could include, for instance,
their release or activation in the tumour. The in situ acquisition of diagnostic
imaging during treatment can allow better treatment planning and under-
standing of therapeutic responses.6 Such imaging-guided therapy may be
particularly promising in the development of new generations of cancer-
treatment strategies in which therapy is induced by external physical
stimuli. In addition, with well-designed and engineered nanomaterials, it is
possible to combine a number of diﬀerent therapeutic or diagnostic functions
within a single nanoplatform. This can allow combination therapy with syn-
ergistic therapeutic outcomes, for instance by reversing drug resistance and/or
achieving high eﬃcacy by precisely targeting an active ingredient.7
As is discussed in Chapter 2, a wide range of inorganic materials have been
developed to give improved therapeutic outcomes. Various imaging techniques
including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
positron emission tomography (PET), and fluorescence molecular tomography
(FMT) have been developed for clinical applications, and these are discussed
in detail in Chapter 3.8,9 While many imaging probes for each specific imaging
modality have been developed, there is less work to develop nanoprobes that
can be used for multiple imaging modalities, delivering the benefits of hybrid
imaging techniques (see Section 3.4.2). In addition to imaging, there also exists
another aspect of diagnosis: the detection and quantification of biomarkers
for particular conditions. Inorganic materials also have great potential here.
The objective of this chapter is to review the recent progress in biomedical
applications of inorganic nanoparticles as agents for diagnosis and theranostics.
We will build on the material already introduced in Chapter 3, describing
additional materials that find application in medical diagnosis and biomarker
detection, and discussing in detail concepts around theranostic formulations.
4.2
Inorganic Nanomaterials in the Biomedical Field
Inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) can have a range of favourable properties, such
as simple fabrication routes, tuneable sizes, the ability to generate heat or
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the ability to provide X-ray absorption and
energy transfer. They have hence received considerable attention in recent
years.10,11 Inorganic NPs possessing these advantages, such as iron oxide, gold,
carbon, or silica-based materials, inter alia, have applications both as imaging
probes and also as building blocks in the construction of multifunctional
nanoplatforms, showing promise in both theranostic and diagnostic fields.
Inorganic NPs have been particularly widely explored in the field of oncol-
ogy,12 where success has been obtained in the imaging and treatment of
tumours ex vivo and in vivo, with some progress towards clinical trials. For
instance, magnetic NPs (e.g. superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs) have been
applied as potent T2 (imaging highlighting fat and water) magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) contrast agents, showing much improved detection sensitivity
over conventional Gd31 based agents.13,14 High atomic number elements
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
195

(e.g. gold,15,16 bismuth,17,18 and tantalum19,20) have been studied for CT
applications owing to their high X-ray attenuation. The improved optical and
chemical stability of quantum dots (QDs) over fluorescent dyes, together
with their tuneable emission wavelength, enables their use as fluorescent tags
in optical imaging.21–23 In this section, we will briefly summarise the major
inorganic materials developed for biomarker detection and theranostics.
4.2.1
Iron Oxide-based Nanomaterials
Magnetic nanoparticles, such as iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), are of
great interest to researchers due to their magnetic hyperthermia properties,
MRI contrast enhancement properties, and the potential to target drug
delivery via magnetic forces. All these properties are promising for clinical
application.14,24–26 Some of the few Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved inorganic products in clinical use are polymer-coated super-
paramagnetic IONPs used for MR imaging. For instance, Ferumoxides
(Endorem/Feridex;
particle
size
120–180
nm)27
and
Ferucarbotran28
(Resovist; particle size approximately 60 nm) are both negative MRI con-
trast agents based on IONPs. Iron is endogenous to the human body, being
present at substantial levels, and thus the small additional amounts that
might arise from the degradation of IONPs should not be detrimental.
4.2.1.1
Synthesis Methods
The magnetic properties of IONPs are a function of their composition and
morphology. The synthetic method used to prepare them needs to allow
control over their shape, size, polydispersity, and crystallinity. The major
techniques employed to prepare IONPs for biomedical applications com-
prise co-precipitation, microemulsion, sol–gel, and thermal decomposition
methods, though others also exist (see Figure 4.1).14 Those approaches can
be used to generate NPs with a high degree of control over their properties.
The co-precipitation technique is perhaps the simplest approach. However,
thermal decomposition and microemulsion syntheses give improved size
and morphology control, and can be used to generate superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) smaller than 20 nm. The sol–gel techni-
que allows researchers to produce SPIONs with stabilising silica coatings
and a size larger than 20 nm.
4.2.1.1.1
Co-precipitation.
Co-precipitation occurs via the simultaneous
precipitation of Fe21 and Fe31 from solution under alkaline conditions.
Most commercially available SPIONs are synthesised via this route,29,30
which was first reported by Massart.31 Most commonly, an aqueous solu-
tion containing a mixture of Fe(II) and Fe(III) salts at a 2 : 1 molar ratio is
prepared and subsequent addition of a base (e.g. NaOH or NH4OH) and
application of heat causes Fe3O4 NPs to be precipitated:
Fe21 þ 2Fe31 þ 8OH"Fe3O4 þ 4H2O
196
Chapter 4

The synthetic parameters control the size, shape, and composition of the
IONPs obtained. These include the Fe21 : Fe31 ratio, reaction temperature,
pH, and the nature of the Fe salt (chloride, nitrate, sulfate, perchlorate) and
base (NaOH, NH4OH, Na2CO3) used. However, the Fe3O4 NP products tend to
be highly unstable and also polydisperse.

4.2.1.1.2
Thermal Decomposition.
This process is a widely applied route
to prepare monodisperse nanocrystals, and gives products with smaller sizes
than those obtained from other techniques. The reaction uses organometallic
compounds in high-boiling point organic solvents containing stabilising sur-
factants. Nanoparticle synthesis is driven by the thermal decomposition of
the Fe complexes, and can yield high-quality NPs with tuneable size and high
levels of crystallinity.32,33 As a result, the NPs’ magnetic properties can be in-
crementally varied from being virtually paramagnetic through to ferro-
magnetic as their size increases from a few nm to approximately 100 nm.
Control over morphology and nanoparticle size is obtained through opti-
mising the reaction time, temperature and the precursor-to-surfactant ratio.34
Sun et al. were the first to prepare hydrophobic Fe3O4 NPs via this route, pro-
ducing NPs with sizes from 3 to 20 nm via the thermal decomposition of fer-
ric acetylacetonate [Fe(acac)3] in the presence of oleic acid and oleylamine.35
However, the thermal method is not environmentally friendly, owing to its
use of toxic species, such as chloroform, hexane, and iron pentacarbonyl.
4.2.1.1.3
Microemulsion Route.
Microemulsion systems are mixtures of
two immiscible liquids, with one comprising a continuous phase and the
other discrete droplets dispersed throughout the bulk. Microemulsions
come in two broad categories (dispersed phase-in-continuous phase): oil-in-
water (o/w; normal micelles) and water-in-oil (w/o; reverse micelles). An am-
phiphilic stabilising species is required to impart stability to the system and
allow the dispersed phase to spread evenly throughout the continuous
phase. The dispersed phase acts as a nano- or micro-reactor in providing a
confined space for the nucleation and growth of particles from the species
dissolved
into
the
droplets.
A
range
of
surfactants
[e.g.
cetyl-
trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), dioctyl sodium dodecyl sulfate (DSS),
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)] or polyethoxylates (e.g. Tween-20 and -80) can
be used to stabilise the systems.36 The size of the NP product can be con-
trolled by varying the size of the micelles, which can, in turn, be achieved by
adjusting the relative proportions of water, organic phase, and surfactant in
the reaction mixture. This control is the main benefit which comes from em-
ploying the microemulsion methodology to prepare SPIONs. In addition,
since the micelles are generally homogeneous, the polydispersity of the par-
ticles formed is typically low. Drawbacks of microemulsion synthesis include
the fact that the reaction rates usually have to be kept low, which results in
the formation of SPIONs with low crystallinity and low yields. Adding re-
agents to stabilise the micelle structure at high reaction temperatures37 or
thermal annealing of the synthesised iron oxide38 can be applied to increase
the crystallinity, however. Diﬃculties related to scale-up and the unavoidable
presence of residual surfactants on the NP surfaces are additional disadvan-
tages of the microemulsion method.14
4.2.1.1.4
Alternative Chemical Methods.
Hydrothermal, sol–gel, electro-
chemical, and sonochemical protocols can also be used to synthesise
198
Chapter 4

IONPs.14 A hydrothermal synthesis does not use organometallic compounds,
surfactants or organic solvents and is thus low cost. Furthermore, the
process is simple to implement, and yields products with high purity and a
high degree of crystallinity which can be freely dispersed in water.39 The
sonochemical method provides monodisperse SPIONs with a variety of
shapes under ambient conditions (usually in the presence of air) and
without the need to apply high temperatures or prolonged reaction times.40
Electrochemical deposition can also be used to prepare maghemite (g-Fe2O3)
and magnetite (Fe3O4) SPIONs. However, the electrochemical technique is at
present not suitable for large-scale production. In addition, since reactions
are usually performed at room temperature, the products generally have low
crystallinity and a degree of amorphous content.41
4.2.1.2
Surface Modification
The introduction of a coating layer on the surfaces of Fe3O4 or Fe2O3 NPs can
both improve their colloidal stability and provide a protective shell, pre-
venting, for example, oxidation reactions. The shell material can be selected
to contain reactive surface functional groups (e.g. amine, thiol, and carboxyl
groups)
to
allow
subsequent
surface
functionalisation.
Examples
of
materials which have been used to coat iron oxide NPs are polymers,42–44
fatty acids,45,46 amino acids,47,48 metals (such as gold, gadolinium, and
silver),49,50 and inorganic oxides.51,52 Among these, polymers have been
most widely explored, and numerous polymers both natural (e.g. starch,
gelatine, dextran, casein, alginate, or chitosan) and synthetic [such as
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(vinyl pyrrolidone)
(PVP), poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and polydopamine] have been
applied as coatings on various forms of SPIONs.53,54
Silica has been particularly widely investigated for cladding magnetic
IONPs. This is because of its biocompatibility, high physicochemical sta-
bility, and ease of chemical functionalisation.55–57 The coating of IONPs with
an inert silica shell endows them with a protective hydrophilic surface with
anchoring points (Si–OH groups) for further surface functionalisation. The
latter can be achieved using silane coupling agents, permitting grafting of
compounds such as fluorescent probe molecules, PEG chains, and targeting
ligands [e.g. folic acid (FA) and antibodies].58,59 Lu et al. have used a sol–gel
approach to apply a silica coating. These researchers took a commercial
aqueous suspension of Fe3O4 NPs (with dimensions in the 5–15 nm range),
mixed this with propanol under stirring, and then added ammonia
and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) to the reaction mixture.60 Alternatively, a
microemulsion route has been developed by Chen et al.,61 resulting in the
formation of Fe3O4@SiO2 or solid SiO2 nanospheres.
In addition to the standard surface modification methods, IONPs can be
embedded inside vesicles, such as liposomes62 or polymer micelles.63,64 The
location of the NPs in the liposomes depends on their surface properties.65
Hydrophilic SPIONs will be located in the core
of the liposomes.
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
199

Hydrophobic SPIONs, however, will tend to be entrapped in the hydrophobic
interior of the lipid bilayer which forms the exterior of the liposome.65–67
Polymer micelles, self-assembled systems built from amphiphilic block
copolymers, have a hydrophobic core compartment which is suitable for the
incorporation of hydrophobic SPIONs. In addition, the hydrophilic shell
helps to stabilise the NPs in aqueous suspension or biological media.64,68,69
4.2.1.3
Toxicity and Biocompatibility
Careful assessment of SPIONs’ toxicological properties is required for clinical
applications, especially if they are to be used for diagnostic purposes. In vivo
studies in rats using oleic acid–pluronic-coated IONPs revealed that iron levels
returned to normal within three weeks of intravenous administration.70 Only
when the liver iron concentration reached more than tenfold the natural level
were cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma evident.71 This is far above any
required dose. The human body naturally contains a relatively high level of
iron, and therefore the additional amount that results from the degradation of
IONPs is negligible and should not have any detrimental eﬀects in vivo.
Several in vitro and in vivo protocols have been employed to assess the
biocompatibility of SPIONs. In vitro, surface-coated SPIONs are generally
found to be non-toxic to cells at iron concentrations of up to 10 mg ml1, while
slight cytotoxicity is seen at 100 mg ml1. However, these in vitro results are
not necessarily matched in clinical settings. IONPs with a range of diﬀerent
sizes have in the past been approved by the FDA, but most are no longer
available for clinical use as a result of toxicity concerns. The exception is the
contrast agent Lumirem/Gastromark (approved by the FDA in 1996).72,73
4.2.2
Gold-based Nanomaterials
The medicinal use of gold has a long history, and gold nanomaterials have
been extensively explored because of their electrical and optical properties
arising from (localised) surface plasmon resonance (SPR: Figure 4.2).
Under light irradiation, the electromagnetic field causes coherent oscil-
lation of conduction-band electrons at the surface of the NPs. This leads to
light scattering, surface plasmon absorption converting incident light to
heat, and a strong local electromagnetic field. The result is enhanced optical
signals for fluorescence and Raman scattering.74,75 SPR peaks in the near
infrared (NIR) region can penetrate biological tissue to significant depths,
and thus materials possessing these properties have a number of potential
biomedical applications. The optical properties of gold nanomaterials are
governed by the wavelength and shape of the SPR peaks. They can be ad-
justed by varying the size, shape, and aspect ratio of the NPs.16 Several
structures, including gold nanorods (AuNRs),76 nanoshells (AuNSs),77 and
NPs (AuNPs),16 have been widely studied because, in addition to the SPR
phenomenon, Au systems permit facile surface functionalisation and tune-
able physical properties.
200
Chapter 4

4.2.2.1
Gold NPs
AuNPs have much higher absorption cross-sections than small molecule
dyes, and therefore usually exhibit strong visible absorption. The wavelength
at which this occurs is governed by their diameter and extent of aggregation.
In 2003, Pitsillides et al. used a pulsed laser to heat cancer cells in the
presence of AuNPs, which gave highly localised photothermolysis of the
target cells.78 Zharov et al. similarly reported the photothermal destruction
of K562 cancer cells by AuNPs.79 In the latter studies, laser-induced bubbles
were detected during the laser irradiation process.
Gold NPs are generally synthesised by reduction of HAuCl4 in solution.
The Turkevich route uses citrate as both a reducing and capping agent, and
results in 20 nm particles.80 The Brust–Schiﬀrin method reduces HAuCl4
with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) with an alkanethiol capping agent.81 The
size of Au NPs produced can be controlled by adjusting the relative reagent
amounts. For instance, spherical Au NPs can be synthesised from aqueous or
organic solutions using citrate or thiols as the capping agent. The products
can be applied for dark-field light-scattering imaging, if NPs can be specif-
ically delivered to the target region.82

Gold Nanorods
The fact that the Au NP SPR absorption band lies in the visible region has
formed a significant barrier to further development. However, the SPR bands
can be extended into the NIR region by changing the shape and aspect ratio
of the particles. AuNRs are one route to achieve NIR SPR. AuNRs have an

anisotropic shape, and free electrons can oscillate along both the long and
short axes. Thus, AuNRs have two SPR bands.83 The transverse absorption of
AuNRs is at approximately 520 nm, and the longitudinal peak can be tuned
in the NIR region by altering the rod length.84 A variety of methods can be
used to synthesise AuNRs with controllable aspect ratios.
The first studies into the synthesis of AuNRs involved electrochemical
reduction, which can be performed either with or without a template.
Template-directed synthesis is relatively straightforward to implement. Jana
et al. reported a method using seed-mediated growth with CTAB as a capping
agent.85 CTAB binds to specific crystal faces on spherical gold seed particles,
causing preferential growth in the uncapped direction and inducing the for-
mation of nanorods.86 The aspect ratio can be controlled by changing the
concentration of Au ions. As the aspect ratio increases, the colour of an AuNR
suspension changes from blue to red (Figure 4.3).87 This type of synthetic
procedure, starting with seed materials, has emerged as the most popular
approach for the preparation of AuNRs owing to its procedural simplicity, and
the fact it gives good control of the product aspect ratio, high product uni-
formity, and allows flexibility for onward surface modifications.
Photochemical reduction is another potent method for the synthesis of
AuNRs. Here, an Au(III) precursor species is reduced under UV light to gen-
erate Au atoms. This arises via electron transfer from [AuCl]4
 to the capping
ligand. Other methods that have been reported include bioreduction,88
microwave-assisted reduction89 and solvothermal reduction.90

Other Au Nanostructures
Beyond simple spheres and rods, there exists a plethora of gold nanostructures,
such as plates with triangular, hexagonal, and circular shapes.91,92 Nanoplates
have two relatively large basal (111) planes, combined with low aspect ratios.
Their SPR peaks lie in the visible and the NIR range. The optical properties can
be varied by controlling the edge length, thickness, and degree of sharpness.
Many other types of Au nanostructures have been reported, including hollow
nanostructures, nanoshells, nanoboxes, nanocages, and nanoframes. Again,
the SPR peak can be adjusted to fall at wavelengths between 400 and 1200 nm.93
4.2.2.4
Gold-based Nanocomposites
Multifunctional gold-based nanocomposites (GNPs) can improve their eﬃcacy
in both therapy and diagnosis.94 They most often include polymer NPs or NPs of
other metals or semiconductors. An early example is a hybrid of GNPs and a
poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer.95 A composite was constructed from
small (2–3 nm) GNPs encased in a lipid or polymer matrix, and investigated for
the optoacoustic detection of tumour cells.96 NIR imaging of tumour cells was
shown to be possible using nanocomposites consisting of 5 nm GNPs in a
biodegradable PEG–polylactone capsule.97 In other work, GNRs coated with a
bovine serum albumin (BSA) shell and functionalised with vascular endothelial
growth factor antibodies increased the eﬃcacy of photothermal therapy (PTT).98
Several surface modification strategies have been applied to Au-based NPs,
leading to improved stability, and/or targeting, and/or increases in bio-
compatibility. For instance, AuNRs encased in a folate-doped silica shell
have been shown to have potential both for CT and photothermolysis
in vivo.99 Li et al. reported hollow mesoporous silica nanocapsules covered
with Au nanostars, in which the core was loaded with perfluorohexane and
the shell modified with PEG. The resultant composites could be used for
simultaneous multimode ultrasonic (US)/CT/photoacoustic (PA)/thermal
imaging and photothermal therapy of tumours.100
Composites made up of AuNPs and IONPs have also been explored widely.
The combination of the magnetic properties of the IONPs and the optical
plasmon resonant properties of Au increases the potential applications in
biomedical research. AuNPs with a magnetic shell and NPs with a magnetic
core and a gold shell have both been reported. For instance, spherical
magnetic Fe2O3
101 or Fe3O4
102 NPs were coated with a gold shell and then
functionalised with antibodies allowing them to target cancer cells. Cheng
et al. performed eﬀective fluorescence imaging and magnetically targeted
PTT on tumours using a platform based on IONPs and lanthanide nano-
crystals wrapped in a thin layer of gold.103

Toxicology
Although Au colloids are drunk by people as a dietary supplement purported
to rejuvenate health there is scant evidence for benefits, and clinical trials are
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
203

needed to validate any actual health benefits and identify long-term adverse
eﬀects.104 As the range of AuNPs which have been synthesised and their ap-
plications has increased, safety concerns are similarly attracting attention. It
is necessary to understand in much greater detail the potential toxicity haz-
ards of the novel materials generated by researchers.15,16 AuNPs are usually
considered to be inert, and cannot be degraded in vivo. Internalised Au NPs
can, however, potentially undergo shape transformations, owing to degrad-
ation taking place on selected crystal faces.105 Figure 4.4 presents a summary
of techniques used to understand the biodistribution and toxicity of Au NPs
in vitro and in vivo.106
Most published studies into the toxicity of Au NPs are based on in vitro cell
models.107,108 However, for clinical applications these studies have limited
utility, because of the poor correlation between in vitro and in vivo findings.
In fact, even the animal tumour models widely used to explore novel
nanoparticle systems have attracted serious concerns in terms of their
clinical relevance.36,47 Unfortunately, in vivo studies into Au NP toxicity are
very limited, and all worked with simple gold-based nanoplatforms. Cho
et al. reported that intravenous injection of 13 nm Au NPs into mice at doses
from 0.17 to 4.26 mg kg1 led to acute inflammation and cell apoptosis in
the liver.109 In the work of Velikorodnaya et al.,110 5 nm Au NPs were ad-
ministered intraperitoneally to mice or rats at doses of approximately
2 mg kg1. Samples of the major organs were analysed at various times after
injection. In brain samples from both mice and rats, Au NPs were detected in
the brain shell only. In general, no significant long-term toxicity eﬀects were
observed in this study. Bednarski et al.111 used lower (0.36 mg kg1) doses of
PVP stabilised 20 nm Au NPs and injected these into rats’ tail veins. Statis-
tically significant but moderate changes in several biochemical parameters
were noted, in addition to a twofold increase in blood glucose concentration.
Most studies addressing the toxicity of Au NPs focus on acute toxicity
occurring within weeks of administration, and a systematic study of the
long-term (41 year) eﬀects is still lacking. However, several factors have been
identified which aﬀect the overall in vivo toxicity. These include the size,
shape, surface chemistry, and surface charge of the NPs, as well as the
presence of surfactant.104 These factors notably aﬀect the acute toxicity, but
are likely to be less important for long-term toxicity. Recent clinical trials112
with Au NPs also demonstrated that, even when acute toxicity was not
observed, most patients suﬀer a fever alongside adverse events, such as
changes in cell populations, proteins and electrolytes in the blood.
4.2.3
Silica-based Nanomaterials
Like iron, silicon is a trace element in the human body and is thus inherently
biocompatible. Silicon-based NPs have been formulated to be biodegradable
into renal clearable components, which can eﬀectively evade the re-
ticuloendothelial system (RES).113 Si-based NPs can be prepared with con-
trolled morphology and porous structures, allowing them to be loaded with a
204

range of cargos, and their surface functionalisation is generally simple. SiO2
(silica) NPs comprise excellent candidates for biomedical applications, par-
ticularly drug or gene delivery. Mesoporous silica NPs (MSNs) in particular are
one of the most attractive inorganic drug delivery systems owing to their high
specific surface area (700–1000 m2 g1) and pore volume (0.6–1 cm3 g1), and

the possibility of tuning the particle size (50–300 nm), pore size (2–6 nm) and
pore structure.56,114,115 This endows them with high drug loading capacities;
they also enjoy high stability under physiological conditions.
4.2.3.1
Synthetic Strategy
The traditional method to prepare silica NPs arises from the work of Sto¨ber
et al., who in 1968 discovered an eﬀective method for the synthesis of
monodisperse silica particles via the hydrolysis of tetraalkyl silicates in an
alcohol–water mixture, using ammonia as a catalyst.116 This approach has
been investigated very widely since then, and the reaction has been found to
be highly controllable. Particles with sizes ranging from tens of nanometres
to a few micrometres have been obtained by dint of varying the reaction
composition, and the general synthetic approach also has applications in the
generation of non-silica materials.117,118 The size of the MSNs produced can
be further varied by adding an additional silica source to the reaction mix.
The latter is chosen to react preferentially with surface silanol groups on
existing particles, rather than generating new MSNs. When an aprotic
cosolvent is used in the Sto¨ber method, spherical MSNs with smooth
surfaces are formed.116 In other work, Lin et al. developed a strategy for
synthesising mono-disperse MSNs,119 and could modulate the size of the
product particles by controlling the pH of the reaction solution.
Increasing the pore volume of MSNs should allow an elevation of the
loading capacity, which is highly desirable in drug delivery systems. To
this end, extensive eﬀorts have been made to develop a simple synthesis
method for hollow MSNs. The resultant hollow silica NPs (HSNs) comprise a
subclass of MSNs which have attracted a lot of recent research activity. HSNs
can be generated from a number of soft templates, including micelles,
microemulsion droplets or vesicles.55 Liu et al. varied the framework-
precursor:surfactant ratio, and found that lower ratios favour the formation
of hollow NPs templated by single micelles. This allowed them to prepare
small
hollow
organosilica
nanospheres
and
nanotubes.120
A
ternary
surfactant system can be applied to introduce mesostructure to the shell of
hollow MSNs by anchoring neutral tri-block copolymers onto cationic
surfactant vesicles.121 The use of varied shapes of micelles can lead to the
generation of nanofoams, mesoporous silica nanorods, and hollow spheres.57
An alternative route to prepare HSNs uses a stabilised oil-in-water (o/w)
microemulsion formed from a mixture of water, surfactant, oil, and a small
amount of an aqueous alkaline solution.122 To prepare silane-containing
HSNs in a one-pot reaction, a mixture of a hydrophobic silane and an organic
silica source (such as tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS) is used as the silica
source. Microemulsion routes to mesoporous silica were first reported by
Schmidt-Winkel et al.123
Colloidal hard templates can also be employed to prepare HSNs, for in-
stance using gold, silver, CdS, ZnS, and polymer beads.124,125 Polymer par-
ticles (e.g. polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene) with sizes ranging from tens
206
Chapter 4

of nanometres to a few micrometres are the best suited to generate hollow
MSNs. This is because they are readily available at uniform sizes, are
inexpensive, and the organic template can be easily removed by calcination
at 300–500 1C.42,126 Both surfactants and block copolymers have been
employed to stabilise the hydrophobic polymer beads, permitting a homo-
geneous dispersion in an aqueous medium to be achieved. The surfactants
or polymer at the exterior of the beads can be further coated with functional
groups for silica gelation, and hence the polymer beads can directly act to
template HSNs. This process can be incrementally tuned through the pH of
the reaction system. In the literature, quaternary ammonium surfactants are
often used as NP capping agents, and can also be used as organic templates
for mesoporous silicas. For instance, Kim et al. prepared monodisperse
Fe3O4 nanocrystal@mesoporous silica NPs, with CTAB acting both as a
stabiliser and mesostructure directing agent.127 After an additional PEG
surface modification, the Fe3O4@mesoporus silica material was found to be
promising as a theranostic combining T2-weighted MRI and drug delivery.
In addition, binary surfactant mixtures of anionic and zwitterionic
surfactants can form vesicles to encapsulate NPs. To interact with the
negatively-charged surface of the vesicle, a protonated amino-silane must be
incorporated into the silica source. After hydrolysis and condensation,
yolk–silica shell structures can be produced. The movable yolks can
comprise a range of materials, for instance silica beads, Au NPs, or Fe2O3
nano-spindles (Figure 4.5).128 The resulting multifunctional nanocompo-
sites again have significant potential as theranostic agents.

4.2.3.2
Structure and Morphology Control
Precisely tuning the structural parameters of MSNs is important to meet the
requirements of the various potential applications. In particular, the flexible
mesopore size of MSNs allows them to encapsulate and deliver guest molecules
with a wide range of diﬀerent sizes. Small-pore-sized (less than 100 nm) MSNs
are relatively easy to synthesise, but it is extremely challenging to fabricate
large-pore-sized materials with particle sizes on the nanoscale. The latter is
important, however, to permit the delivery of large biomolecules such as genes
or proteins. To generate NP-sized MSNs with large pores, a simple micelle/
precursor co-templating assembly (M/P-CA) approach has been devised
recently (Figure 4.6).129 Bis[3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl]tetrasulfide (BTES) was
employed as an organosilica precursor, introducing a physiologically active
disulfide bond into the framework. The cationic cetyltrimethylammonium

chloride (CTAC) surfactant was used to generate large micelles, and thus MSNs
with large pore sizes. In other work, benzene-bridged MSNs with a particle
size of around 50 nm and mesopores at 4.6 to 7.6 nm were synthesised in a
water–toluene two-phase system.130 The introduction of the oil phase played a
key role in the assembly of the surfactant and organosilica reagents, which also
functioned as pore-swelling agents.
The architecture of MSNs can be precisely controlled through careful design
of the system.131,132 For instance, hollow mesoporous organosilica NPs
(HMONs) with multiple shells have been synthesised recently via a simple
‘multi-interface transformation’ methodology.133 Organosilica shells were
successively grown onto the surface of solid organosilica–CTAB particles. By
separating the hydrolysis and condensation processes of bissilylated organic
precursors into individual steps, MSNs with varied morphologies and topology
can be generated. When condensation of an ethylene-bridged bissilylated
precursor was initiated after the pre-condensation of a benzene-bridged
spherical periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO), novel hybrid multipodal
PMO NPs could be generated.
4.2.3.3
Gatekeepers
MSNs can act as drug carriers thanks to the high internal surface area of the
mesoporous silica matrix. However, upon exposure of the MSNs to a
physiological fluid there is likely to be a rapid ‘burst’ of drug release from the
particles, owing to the pore being open to the exterior environment. This can
be a problem where sustained treatment or drug release targeted to a par-
ticular location is required. Two main approaches have been taken to design
MSNs with controlled release capabilities. One is the so-called ‘capping’ or
‘gating’ approach. This involves attaching organic ‘gatekeeper’ molecules at
the pore opening, preventing release of the cargo stored in the pore via steric
hindrance or electrostatic forces.134 ‘Nanovalves’ can be attached to the pore
openings to provide an open and close function, permitting drug release be
turned on and oﬀ.114 When the valve is closed, the drug cargo is confined
inside the pores. Opening the nanovalve allows the release of the stored
active ingredient. MSNs can be imparted with controlled release features by
attaching active molecules to the surface of the MSNs via stimuli-responsive
linkages, such that the pore entrances are opened only upon exposure to
specific stimuli, such as pH, reducing conditions, or the presence of par-
ticular enzymes and biomolecules. Externally applied stimuli, such as
magnetic fields, light, or ultrasound can also be employed to target re-
lease.56,114,135 Various gatekeepers have been designed to meet these dif-
ferent requirements.
The presence of polymers at the pore entrances of MSNs can endow the
system with the ability to respond to a wide range of stimuli (both chemical
and physical). Polymers acting as pH-sensitive gatekeepers have been in-
vestigated by many researchers. Mei et al. coated hollow mesoporous silica
NPs (HMSNs) with a pH-sensitive diblock copolymer gatekeeper via
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
209

hydrophobic van der Waals interactions.136 When the HMSNs were taken up
by tumour cells, the acetal moieties in the polymer hydrolysed in the weakly
acidic endosomal/lysosomal compartments. To similar ends, Niedermayer
et al. covalently attached a pH-responsive PVP-based polymer to the surface
of drug-loaded MSNs.137
Employing pH-responsive linkers to conjugate polymers to the surface of
MSNs is an alternative route to achieve pH-responsive gatekeeping. In 2014,
Chen et al. grafted a poly(acrylic acid) gatekeeper, on doxorubicin (DOX)-
loaded MSNs via an acid-cleavable linker.138 A pH-responsive polymer
gatekeeper may also be developed by exploiting changes in the electrostatic
interactions between polymers and MSNs with pH variation. Zhang et al.
developed a novel a pH-sensitive polymer [poly(allylamine)–citraconic
anhydride (PAH–cit)] and attached this to the surface of MSNs through
electrostatic adsorption, thereby sealing the pore entrances. PAH–cit is a
pH-responsive charge-reversal polymer, and readily converts from being
negative under neutral or basic pH conditions to positive under acidic
conditions (by dint of side-chain hydrolysis).139 Such formulations have
enjoyed considerable success in controlling and targeting drug release.
However, there remain issues to overcome. For example, eﬃciency of
controlling the storage and release of drugs depends on the matching of the
polymer gatekeeper and the pore entrances of MSNs. If the gatekeepers are
too small to block the entrance, the drug can leak out. Conversely, if the
gatekeepers are too large, the pore entrances will not be eﬀectively opened.
In addition, these systems respond to a single stimulus and could be
inadvertently triggered by external factors in real-life clinical applications.
To further improve the possibilities for clinical translation, polymer gate-
keepers able to respond to two or more stimuli can be applied to MSN-based
DDSs, either in the form of a single polymer or two or more separate poly-
mers responding to diﬀerent stimuli.140
Inorganic nanomaterials have also been reported to act as gatekeepers of
MSNs in biomedical applications, with gatekeepers explored including Au
NPs, Ag NPs, cerium oxide (CeO2) NPs, manganese oxide (MnO2), quantum
dots (QDs), fullerene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene (RGO), and
layered double hydroxides (LDHs).114 For instance, Knezˇevic´ used CdS QDs
as the gatekeepers on magnetic MSNs to realise targeted release of
the anticancer drug camptothecin,141 and Muhammad et al. employed an
acid-decomposable ZnO QD gatekeeper to similar ends.142 Chen et al. have
attached fluorescent graphene quantum dots (GQDs) to MSNs through
electrostatic interactions, and shown that the pore entrances can be opened
under acidic conditions.143 The system exhibited excellent luminescence
properties in vitro. However, caution is required: while various metal-
containing QDs have been used as gatekeepers, many metal elements are
toxic to humans at relatively low doses.
CeO2 NPs have good biocompatibility and minimal toxicity and thus have
attracted interest to obviate such toxicity issues.144,145 CeO2 NPs can be re-
duced to Ce31 in the presence of reducing agents, allowing them to act as MSN
210
Chapter 4

gatekeepers. In 2014, Muhammad et al. attached CeO2 NP gatekeepers on
MSNs, constructing an antioxidant-responsive DDS based on this reduction
process.146 Gatekeepers comprising composite IrO2–bovine serum albumin
(BSA) NPs have been used to design tumour microenvironment-responsive
theranostics based on hollow mesoporous organosilica NPs (HMONs).147 The
system was loaded with a heat shock protein inhibitor. As these materials are
ingested by tumour cells (Figure 4.7), the BSA–IrO2 gatekeeper will be cleaved
from the HMON surface via to the breakage of a connecting disulfide bond and
the subsequently released inhibitor could reduce the thermoresistance of the
cancer during IrO2-mediated PTT. Simultaneously, PA imaging could be per-
formed using this system.
Graphene oxide (GO) is an oxidised derivative of graphene with a 2D carbon
honeycomb lattice presenting hydroxy, epoxide, and carboxy groups. This is
hydrophilic, allows simple surface modification, and leads to good bio-
compatibility and low cytotoxicity.127,148,149 GO nanosheets can act as a potent
gatekeeper for MSNs, since they are negatively charged at physiological pHs.
Exploiting this, Tang et al. used GO as the gatekeeper for positively charged
drug-loaded MSNs, endowing the DDS with photoirradiation-mediated drug
release and targeted cancer therapy.150 MnO2 nanosheets are similarly

negatively charged at physiological pH, and can be reduced to Mn21 by en-
dogenous glutathione (GSH). This leads to decomposition of the nanosheets.
This approach has been applied by Meng et al., who co-loaded a two-photon
dye and a photosensitiser into MnO2-capped MSNs for bimodal imaging and
targeted therapy.151
A range of other capping agents, including organic molecules, carbo-
hydrates, peptides, proteins, DNA/RNA, supramolecular assemblies, and
polysaccharides, have been also employed as responsive gatekeepers.114,152,153
Despite great progress in the field in recent years, most gated systems have
significant problems in vivo. These include unexpected toxicity arising from
the capping agents and drug release not being eﬀectively triggered.154,155 To
try to overcome these, Zeng et al.156 reported a ‘smart’ MSN-based system. This
was gated by the chemotherapeutic drug of interest through a pH-sensitive
benzoic–imine bond. The system prepared does not require any auxiliary
capping agents. It exhibited drug release specifically at tumour sites, and was
able to inhibit tumour growth. Inspired by this, Wu et al.157 designed a bio-
degradable hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoplatform (HMONs) capped
by the anti-cancer drug gemcitabine through a pH-sensitive acetal covalent
bond (Figure 4.8a). At weakly acidic pH (o6.0), the drug cargo is released on
demand, with the drug gatekeeper opening via acetal bond hydrolysis. The
system was also loaded with 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(17AAG; a heat-shock protein inhibitor) which could reduce the temperature
resistance of cancer cells. The nanoplatform exhibited PTT and PA imaging
capability via the loading of indocyanine green (ICG), and could induce
eﬀective cell apoptosis under low temperature heating (Figure 4.8b, c).
4.2.3.4
Biocompatibility and Biodegradability
Silicon is an essential trace element with a function in human metabolic
processes.158,159 It is found in whole grains, vegetables, and seafood. Typical
consumption is approximately 20–50 mg of silicon per day for Western
populations, and up to 200 mg per day where diet is more plant-based
(e.g. in China or India).160 MSNs are hence regarded as one of the most
appropriate inorganic NP systems for applications as drug carriers in bio-
medicine.56,134,161 However, the silica framework is very stable, and degrades
only slowly, resulting in prolonged in vivo retention. This means that there
are still potential severe and unpredictable toxicity risks. Many silica-based
formulations have been shown to have therapeutic eﬃcacy in small animal
models; however, the degradation process of the silica framework and the
potential for long-term retention in vivo remain a concern. A number of
studies have assessed MSNs’ biosafety and their in vivo fate, but these have
led to conflicting conclusions. However, a number of research findings
indicate low cytotoxicity and toxicity in vivo.55,162
The MSN framework degradation process can be controlled by introducing
cleavable linkers into the framework.163 Silica can slowly degrade in aqueous
media via hydrolysis of the –Si–O–Si– linkages into two –Si–OH groups.

The degradation behaviour is complex and depends on many factors, in-
cluding: the extent of framework condensation (–Si–O–Si– vs. –Si–OH content),
porosity, particle size, surface area, pore size and texture, concentration, extent
of aggregation, the presence of additional functional groups or doping of or-
ganic/inorganic species into the silica framework, and temperature.162
MSNs with –Si–O–Si– siloxane frameworks are generally amorphous.
However, crystalline porous silicon can also be prepared, and this tends to
undergo more rapid dissolution via successive hydrolysis reactions. This
renders the crystalline system biodegradable in vivo.163 This has led to
porous silica NPs having many applications for drug delivery and near-
infrared fluorescent bioimaging, including promising results in preclinical
studies.164,165 Chen et al. explored both single and repeated dose toxicity and
clearance of 110 nm unmodified silica-based HMSNs in mice.121 The lethal
dose 50 (LD50) was 41000 mg kg1 for single doses. Repeated dosing led to
no animal deaths when mice received infusions of HMSNs at 20, 40, and
80 mg kg1 by continuous intravenous administration over 14 days.
The degradation of silica can be controlled by the incorporation of organic
moieties into the framework. Three main strategies have been explored:
(i) non-covalent doping of organic molecules into silica NPs, creating weakly
condensed environments in the silica matrix and accelerating hydrolytic
degradation; (ii) covalent inclusion of organic bridges into silsesquioxane-
based NPs (O1.5Si–R–SiO1.5, with R organic groups), to lower dissolution
rates over pure or organically doped silica; (iii) incorporating cleavable
organic bridges into silica or silsesquioxane-based NPs, selecting bridging
moieties which are selective cleaved by e.g. redox or enzymatic reactions.
These approaches are illustrated in Figure 4.9.
The prevalence of bio-reducing agents inside cells has led to the
development of a plethora of redox-triggered-delivery nanosystems.162 Intra-
cellular GSH-triggered degradation tends to lead to rapid clearance in vivo,
and has the potential to increase tolerance thresholds and the dosage of silica-
based formulations which could be applied.166 However, only preliminary
studies have been performed to evaluate this and more experimental data are
needed to validate this idea.

Carbon-based Nanomaterials
Carbon based nanomaterials have attracted huge amounts of research
interest for biomedical applications, in part because they have very prom-
ising mechanical, thermal, and optical properties (Figure 4.10). Attention
has focused on sp2 carbon nanomaterials in particular (0D fullerenes,
1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and 2D graphene).73,167 They have all been
explored in drug delivery and for biomedical imaging.168,169 CNTs and
graphene both exhibit strong NIR optical absorbance, and thus have also
been utilised as photothermal agents in PTT.170
4.2.4.1
Carbon Nanotubes
CNTs have a cylindrical structure with a high length-to-diameter ratio. They
can be categorised as single-walled (SWNTs), bounded by a single sheet of
sp2 C atoms, or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs; bounded by multiple
sheets). CNTs have strong resonant Raman scattering photoluminescence in
the NIR region, and good laser-to-acoustic transfer capacity.171,172 The first
characterisation of CNTs was reported by Iijima in 1991,173 and since then
they have been one of the most widely studied nanomaterials.

Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
215

There is a significant body of work reporting biomedical applications of
CNTs, including for PTT of cancer.168,174,175 PTT systems based on CNTs
have been proposed to be non-invasive, harmless, and highly eﬃcient
therapeutics for PTT using NIR laser irradiation. In 2005, Kam et al.
synthesised DNA-coated SWNTs for this purpose.176 These authors also
showed that it was possible to add multiple chemical species onto the sur-
face of the same nanotube, meaning that they can be functionalised with, for
example, PEG to extend circulation times, active ingredients, targeting
moieties, or fluorescent tags.158
This extensive surface chemistry means that CNTs can be conjugated with
multiple fluorophores with diﬀerent emission wavelengths, permitting im-
aging via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Bioluminescence
imaging has been used to monitor the distribution of CNTs in vivo, after
tagging with a thermostable luciferase.177 Such fluorescent optical imaging
based on CNTs comprises a valuable diagnostic tool, but has limited reso-
lution with tissue depth, even in the NIR range.
Another application for CNTs is as an ultrasound178,179 or PA imaging
contrast agent.180,181 PA imaging detects ultrasound signals excited by op-
tical lasers, and has much higher spatial resolution than fluorescence im-
aging. De La Zerda et al. employed RGD peptide-conjugated SWNTs to be
potent tumour-targeting photoacoustic contrast agents.182 Wang et al. re-
ported that a hyaluronic acid–CNT complex could target CD44, which is over-
expressed on tumour tissue in vivo, and enhanced the contrast in ultrasound
imaging.183 Owing to their chemical versatility CNTs can further be applied
for other imaging techniques, (e.g. MRI, PET, multimodality imaging).184
4.2.4.2
Graphene and Graphene Oxide
Graphene and graphene oxide also have suitable physical and chemical
properties for applications in theranostics.185,186 Graphene is a 2D material
in which each sp2 carbon is bound to three others in a honeycomb lattice.
When graphene is rolled, it forms CNTs or fullerenes, and the 3D graphite
structure is generated when it is stacked. Derivatives of graphene [e.g. GO
and reduced graphene (RGO)] often feature large numbers of functional
groups (hydroxyl, carboxylic, epoxy) which facilitate surface modification.187
Graphene has a large specific surface area and excellent optical and thermal
properties which have led to it being extensively studied for applications in
drug delivery, photodynamic therapy, hyperthermia, imaging, and photo-
acoustic and thermoacoustic based theranostics.149
As a result of its high NIR absorbance, GO has been explored as a
photothermal agent for PTT. Yang et al. studied the in vivo behaviour of
PEGylated nano-GO (nGO–PEG) via fluorescent labeling.188 They explored
how size and surface chemistry aﬀects in vivo behaviour, and found both to
be critical for therapeutic and diagnostic eﬃcacy. Reduced graphene oxide
(RG) has much higher NIR absorbance than GO, however, and is thus more
powerful in PTT.189,190 For instance, Robinson et al. developed a new RGO
216
Chapter 4

with high NIR absorbance, functionalised this with PEG, and found it to be
eﬀective for in vitro photothermal ablation of cancer cells.189 In vivo, RGO–
PEG has been shown to have sixfold enhanced NIR absorbance and eightfold
greater tumour uptake than GO–PEG.190
Cancer imaging with nanosheets of graphene is as eﬀective as when using
CNTs. A PET study was undertaken using GO nanosheets functionalised with
64Cu (as a PET label) and an antibody against the CD105 ligands over-
expressed on cancer cells, and found to be potent.191 GO has additionally
been applied as a scaﬀold to create single-photon emission computerized
tomography (SPECT) imaging agents.192 A composite comprising 111In–GO–
trastuzumab (with 111In acting as the radiolabel, and trastuzumab as an
anti-cancer drug) could not only detect the primary tumour site but also
metastases in the lymph nodes.
4.2.4.3
Carbon Dots
Ultra-small inorganic NPs (less than 10 nm), if suitably surface modified, are
cleared through the renal system after administration. This could obviate
many of the toxicity concerns discussed above, which often arise from bioac-
cumulation. Carbon dots (alternatively known as carbon nanodots or quantum
dots) fall into this classification.193 They can be prepared ‘bottom-up’ by
hydrothermal or microwave treatment (‘carbonisation’) of smaller carbon
sources (e.g. carbohydrates and citric acid), or ‘top-down’ from other carbon
materials.
Similarly to semiconductor-based quantum dots, carbon dots have tuneable
fluorescent and luminescent properties, but oﬀer the additional benefit of
markedly lower toxicity.8 As a result, carbon dots have been widely explored.
With hydrodynamic sizes of 6–8 nm, carbon dots have suﬃciently long in vivo
blood circulation times [half-life (t1/2) ¼ 190 min] to allow optical imaging to be
performed throughout a complete surgical procedure. Circulation times may
be extended using PEG surface modification to change the inherently negative
surface of the dots under physiological pH conditions to become neutral,
which prevents them from aggregating and allows eﬃcient renal clearance.7
For instance, Ge et al. developed red-fluorescent carbon dots via carbonisation
of poly(thiophene phenylpropionic acid), and applied them for fluorescent
imaging and photoacoustic or photothermal therapy.194
A range of carbon-based nanodots has been explored in cancer im-
aging.195,196 Their photoluminescence intensities were found to be stable,
even after several hours of excitation. In one example of such work, Cao et al.
explored their potential in two-photon excitation luminescence microscopy
on human breast cancer cells, using NIR imaging.197
4.2.4.4
Toxicology and Pharmacokinetics
A number of studies have probed the toxicology of carbon nanomaterials,
but the conclusions reached are inconsistent. This is because the toxicity of
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
217

carbon nanomaterials to cells and animals varies with their administration
route, dose, particle size, and surface chemistry.73,198,199 A mechanistic ex-
planation of the reported toxicity is still lacking. Some researchers have
found that carbon nanomaterials could be hazardous in both acute and
chronic terms, whereas others have shown very low or insignificant cellular
responses.8,192,194 The potential long-term toxicity is also a matter of debate,
which is likely to be a major issue hampering future clinical use.
4.2.5
Other Inorganic Nanomaterials
A number of other families of inorganic nanomaterials also show great po-
tential in theranostics. These include low-dimensional materials, tungsten
oxide nanowires, and copper sulfide NPs.200 Numerous 2D materials have been
investigated, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), transition metal di-
chalcogenides (TMDCs), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), transition metal
oxides (TMOs), layered double hydroxides (LDHs), MXenes (with the general
formula of Mn11Xn, where M is an early transition metal and X is carbon and/or
nitrogen) and the newly emerging black phosphorus (BP).200–202 TMDCs have
long been of interest, and with the advent of modern synthetic methods and
exfoliation techniques it has become possible to generate single layers of these
compounds.192 The compounds MoS2 and WS2 are of particular interest. Their
layered structures confer anisotropic electronic and chemical properties, with
the anisotropy more pronounced than in the case of bulk semiconductors.203
TMDCs have been proven to be good candidates for applications such as
multimodal imaging, drug delivery, synergistic therapy, and biosensors.192,204
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), which contain positively charged lay-
ers and charge-balancing interlayer anions, also show great potential in drug
delivery. Generally, they are utilised to deliver acidic drugs, since anions in
the interlayer spacing are freely exchangeable with other anions. Senapati
et al. prepared magnesium–aluminium LDHs to carry hydrophobic antic-
ancer drugs.205 Mei et al. developed a CoFe–LDH system for simultaneous
cancer treatment and MRI.206
Calcium phosphate materials have also attracted a lot of research atten-
tion. They have for instance been investigated as pH-sensitive DDSs, par-
ticularly for genes.207 The calcium phosphate phase dissolves in acidic
conditions, thereby releasing the payload trapped inside. This pH sensitivity
can be fruitfully combined with both active pharmaceutical ingredients and
imaging probes (e.g. for MRI). A range of researchers have explored this. For
therapeutic purposes, Adair et al. encapsulated chemotherapeutics within a
20–30 nm calcium phosphate nanoparticle matrix.208 Expanding on this,
Ahn et al. developed a pH-sensitive NIR activated photothermal theranostic
platform.209 The latter was based on Au NPs stabilised with PEG-based co-
polymers, with a calcium phosphate layer then deposited on the surface.
Apatites are a family of calcium phosphates with a range of chemical
formulae whose properties can be tuned by controlling the reaction con-
ditions. Nanostructured amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), apatite, and
218
Chapter 4

calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite (CDHA) have all been explored for bioap-
plications because they are stable under physiological conditions but dis-
solve in acidic media.210 Furthermore, apatites can be prepared containing
luminescent metal ions, resulting in their having potential as optical im-
aging probes.211 Zhang et al. synthesised mesoporous strontium-containing
hydroxyapatite nanorods for drug delivery.212
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are mesoporous materials containing
metal ions or clusters connected by organic linkers (see Chapter 2, Sec-
tion 2.2 for full details).213 As discussed previously, the pores inside MOFs
can be used to carry therapeutic payloads and/or imaging agents, leading to
scope for them to act as theranostics.214
Upconversion NPs (UCNPs), discussed in detail in Chapter 3, also have
potential as theranostic agents.215 Tsai et al. developed a functionalised
upconversion NPs carrying both a photothermal agent, IR-780, and a pho-
todynamic sensitiser, [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(3-hydroxyphenyl)chlorin], to target
brain tumours and convert deeply penetrating NIR to visible light for com-
bined PTT/photodynamic therapy.216 Chen et al. fabricated Nd31 sensitised
upconversion NPs which possessed luminescence properties for upconver-
sion optical imaging and could be loaded with an anticancer drug for
theranostic applications.217
4.3
Inorganic Nanomaterials for Biomarker Detection
4.3.1
Introduction to Biomarkers
The early detection of diseases such as cancer can significantly reduce their
mortality. Thus, extensive eﬀort has been applied to develop methods al-
lowing clinicians to detect early signs of the disease. The detection of such
‘biomarkers’ has great importance for eﬀective cancer diagnosis and prog-
nosis.218 A diagnosis of cancer is traditionally achieved following a tissue
biopsy. This involves the removal of a small tissue sample from the sus-
pected tumour site in a surgical procedure, which is then examined for signs
of cancer (e.g. under a microscope). The taking of biopsies can be invasive,
unpleasant or painful for patients, and expensive for healthcare providers.
A biomarker is defined as ‘a substance or activity that can be objectively
measured and evaluated as an indicator for a normal biological process,
pathogenic process, or pharmacological responses to a therapeutic inter-
vention’.219 Biomarkers for cancer can be present either in the tumour tissue
and/or in the serum. A wide variety of molecules can act as biomarkers
(enzymes, metabolites, cell surface receptors, DNA, mRNA, transcription
factors, inter alia; see Figure 4.11).220 The goal of biomarker detection is to
provide rapid, cost-eﬀective, and reliable detection and monitoring strat-
egies. These allow for an assessment of an individual’s risk of developing a
disease, early detection, and, in cancer, permit tumour classification. This
ensures that a patient receives the most appropriate therapy, while clinicians
can monitor disease progression as a function of time.
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
219

Various approaches seeking to specifically recognise and quantify intracel-
lular biomarkers or diagnostic molecules on cancer cell surfaces have been
developed. This has been achieved using techniques such as enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), colourimetric or electrochemical assays, fluo-
rescence methods, electrophoresis, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS), polymerase chain reactions (PCR), or surface plasmon resonance
(SPR).219 All these methods for biomarker detection have some limitations,
however, which can, in some cases, be overcome using nanoparticle probes.
4.3.2
Cancer Protein Biomarkers
Protein biomarkers for cancer can include substances generated by the can-
cerous cells themselves, or by other cells responding to the cancer.221,222 They
Figure 4.11

principles of biomarker detection may also be applied to other diseases
besides cancer.

are mainly found in the blood, but also sometimes in other bodily fluids, such
as urine. Most such biomarkers can be applied in both early and late stages of
the disease, and thus can be used to monitor the response of the disease to
treatment as well as to track a patient’s progression during follow-up
appointments.223 ELISA is extensively used in routine clinical diagnostics,
and is often regarded as being the gold standard for detecting proteins in
physiological samples. A standard ELISA assay generates a signal upon an
enzyme degrading a substrate into a coloured molecule, and quantifying
intensity of the colour through measuring absorbance at the appropriate
wavelength. De La Rica and Stevens advanced this technology in a new
‘plasmonic’ ELISA method, using gold NPs as a probe to detect both prostate
specific antigen (PSA) and HIV-1 capsid antigen p24.224 In other work,
Gao et al. applied an enzyme cascade amplification strategy incorporating Pd
nanostructures to enhance ELISA quantification of PSA.225
Electrochemical or electrical detection strategies generally have high
sensitivity and simplicity, and can be performed with miniaturised and
portable hardware.226 A range of detection methods exists. Of these, elec-
trochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) allows complex biological events
to be measured without the need for labelling or the addition of mediating
species. Biosensors based on field eﬀect transistors (FET) are similarly
highly
sensitive,
permitting
label-free

detection
with
non-
destructive sampling.219 These sensors bind biomolecules selectively with
a capture agent on the surface, usually also using a ‘passivating agent’ on the
surface to minimise non-specific binding. The captured biomolecules exert
an influence on the electronic properties, leading to an electronically read-
able signal. By removing the majority of non-specific binding events, such
passivating systems can significantly reduce the likelihood of false positive
signals, thereby enhancing sensor sensitivity. With this in mind, Chang et al.
developed an In2O3 nanowire-based FET biosensing system able to detect
multiple cancer biomarkers at clinically meaningful concentrations from
whole blood collected using a finger prick.227
A range of other approaches exist using inorganic species to detect cancer
biomarkers. For instance, Wu et al. discovered that plasmonic eﬀects
observed in chiral assemblies of NPs can be used to develop versatile
biosensing platforms.228 In other work, Tan et al. developed a mass spec-
trometric sensor employing nanoporous silicon microparticles to capture,
enrich, and detect low-molecular weight biomarker peptides in a colorectal
cancer patient’s serum.229
4.3.3
Enzyme Biomarkers
It is common in disease for enzymes to be dysregulated. For instance, the en-
zyme telomerase is found in most germ-line and stem cells, and also in around
85% of cancerous tumours.230 The diﬀerent levels of expression of telomerase
between healthy cells and tumour cells make it an attractive biomarker as
well as a potential therapeutic target.231 Traditionally, a repeat amplification
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
221

protocol is used to measure telomerase activity in biopsies.232 Although this
approach provides good sensitivity, the assay is gel electrophoresis-based and
thus is time-consuming and subject to PCR-related artefacts. Therefore, alter-
native PCR-free methods are much sought after. Zong et al. have developed one
such method using surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).233 AuNPs were
loaded with telomerase substrate oligonucleotide and Raman reporter mol-
ecules, resulting in highly sensitive detection.
4.3.4
Nucleic Acid Biomarkers
Tumour cells often release DNA into the systemic circulation, meaning that
increased quantities of DNA are found in the plasma of cancer patients. Such
circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) can be employed as a biomarker. Detection
of this is generally done by using deep sequencing approaches to quantify
ctDNA and detect changes to the molecular structure induced by cancer cell
mutagenisis.234,235 Nucleic acid aptamers, oligonucleotides that bind spe-
cific targets of interest (i.e. proteins, small molecules, cells, or other nucleic
acids), can also be used as targeting moieties. In many cases, aptamers are
discovered using a process called ‘systematic evolution of ligands by ex-
ponential enrichment’ (SELEX).236,237 In one example, a Fo¨rster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) quencher was covalently bound to functionalised
CdSe/ZnS QDs and released upon miR-141 binding, resulting in an increase
in fluorescence that enables the detection of the biomarker miR-141 with a
limit of detection of 1 pM.238 In 2007, Seferos et al. introduced the Nano-
Flare, a spherical nucleic acid (SNA) AuNP-based platform, which was shown
to be useful for detecting and knocking down intracellular mRNA.239
4.3.5
Direct Identification and Quantification of Cancer Cells
The proteins produced by cancer cells, both on their surface and in the cy-
tosol, diﬀer from those produced by healthy cells These can be detected and
bound, meaning that tumour cells can be identified, quantified, and po-
tentially isolated and/or destroyed. Circulating tumour cell (CTCs) are shed
from a primary tumour into the vasculature.236,237 They circulate in the
bloodstream, and can lead to the subsequent growth of additional tumours
(metastasis) in distant organs; such metastasis is responsible for the vast
majority of cancer related deaths.240 CTCs can be used as a biomarker.241
Assays for CTCs are largely based on antibody capture at the present time.220
Electrochemical biosensors have clinically relevant sensitivity and speci-
ficity, are simple to deploy and miniaturise, and give a rapid read-out. To
this end, Zheng et al. combined Fe3O4 NPs with metallic nanocages,242
generating Fe3O4@nanocage hybrid electrocatalysts. These could be used for
signal amplification in the development of an ultrasensitive CTC sensor.
In other work, Yoon et al. used functionalised graphene oxide nanosheets on
a patterned gold surface to isolate the CTCs from blood samples taken from
pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer patients.243
222
Chapter 4

Another route to cancer cell detection involves the direct labelling of the
target cells using fluorescent probes. A number of inorganic-based fluor-
escent probes with low cytotoxicity, high fluorescence, and flexible surface
functionalisation can be used here. Suitable materials include lanthanide-
doped NPs, dye-loaded silica NPs, and fluorescent carbon materials.244 Most
labelling methods rely on directly conjugating CTC aﬃnity ligands (e.g.
antibodies or peptides) onto NPs, which can be complex and time con-
suming. SERS is an alternative approach with a number of benefits, in-
cluding being ultrasensitive even down to single molecule detection.245 SERS
signals can be intensified by assembling inorganic NPs into dimers or small
clusters, or by co-encapsulation of nanoparticles and SERS reporter mol-
ecules. These approaches are simpler than the direct covalent conjugation
chemistry usually required for CTC detection.
4.3.6
Examples of Detection Platforms
A range of inorganic materials have been explored for biomarker detection,
but quantum dots, Au NPs, and UCNPs have attracted particular attention.
QDs are inherently fluorescent NPs with long fluorescence lifetimes (410 ns)
compared with organic fluorophores (1–5 ns).246,247 This enables time-
resolved imaging and a notable improvement in signal-to-noise ratios.
More detail on QDs can be found in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.2.1. The en-
hanced sensitivity which QDs thus provide can be highly beneficial in the
detection of biomarkers and/or unhealthy cells and tissues, since these will
be present in low abundance during the early stages of a disease.
A homogeneous in-solution assay for early stage cancer detection was
reported by Li et al., using QD-conjugated antibodies to detect two bio-
markers: carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and neuron specific enolase
(NSE), each with a limit of detection of 1.0 ng ml1.248 Kim et al. developed a
QD-based sandwich assay on a zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire array for the de-
tection of CEA.249 Fo¨rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) occurs between
the ZnO nanowires and QDs bound to CEA, with a very wide detection and
quantification range (from 0.001 to 100 ng ml1). The ability of QDs to act as
oxidising agents can also be employed for cancer biomarker detection.250
Many biosensors use Au NPs as fluorescence quenchers. Au NPs have strong
absorbance, resulting in lower background signals than sensors employing
organic quenchers. In one embodiment of such work, Yu et al. produced a
‘turn-on’ probe exploiting adsorption of proteins to fluorophore-tagged AuNPs.
This system was used to detect two cancer biomarkers: alkaline and acid
phosphatase, both of which are upregulated when a patient is suﬀering from
cancer.251 Beyond the NP core composition, surface functionalisation (with e.g.
antibodies, aptamers, or peptides) can improve the detection of cancer bio-
markers, cells, and tissues by imparting target specificity. The high surface-
area-to-volume ratio of NPs allows a large number of molecules to be appended
to the surface, giving tailorable and multivalent binding. This property allows
the highly specific detection of low concentrations of biomarkers. QDs and
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
223

UCNPs exhibit enhanced photostability and are eﬃciently excited in the tissue-
penetrating NIR window, and thus are very suitable for use here. However,
their long-term safety and toxicity need to be investigated in more detail.
4.4
Inorganic Nanomaterials for Theranostics
As is discussed above and in Chapters 2 and 3, inorganic materials have
great potential in diagnosis (both via imaging and direct detection and
quantification of biomarkers) and therapy.5,12,199 These inorganic nano-
carriers can be endowed with the ability to trigger drug release in response to
a stimulus (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2.3) such as hyperthermia, light, or a
magnetic field.252 Meanwhile, therapeutic agents as well as genes [e.g., DNA
or small interfering RNA (siRNA)] can be incorporated to achieve synergistic
eﬀects.253 Moreover, inorganic nanocarriers can provide multifunctional
platforms for treatment, for instance treating cancer with both PTT254 and
chemotherapy.255 As discussed in Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.4.1, adding an
imaging function can allow simultaneous monitoring of drug delivery and
therapeutic outcomes, leading to improved treatment eﬃcacy.256
4.4.1
MRI-guided Therapy
MRI is a non-invasive medical imaging technique based on the principle of
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Its principles are discussed in detail in
Chapter 3, Section 3.3.1. Some MRI contrast agents, such as iron oxide NPs,
can also be employed for hyperthermia treatment, drug delivery, and biosen-
sing, permitting multi-functional platforms to be developed. IONPs can in-
crease the internalisation of drugs into cancer cells.26 This can be achieved in a
number of ways, for instance by binding DOX to polyethylenimine (PEI)
through a pH sensitive linker and loading the DOX–PEI conjugate to the sur-
face of IONPs.257 DOX-conjugated IONPs have been shown to traverse the
intracellular milieu and release DOX intracellularly, making treatment less
susceptible to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) attenuation.258 Ling et al. have developed
pH-sensitive magnetic NPs (PMNs) which can disassemble in the acidic tu-
mour microenvironment, resulting in an increase in cell adsorption and per-
meation.259 IONPs wrapped in polycations can eﬃciently be loaded with P-gp
regulation siRNA to increase the sensitivity to therapy of multidrug resistant
(MDR) cancer cells.7,38 In all these cases, the IONPs provide T2 contrast for
MRI, allowing clinicians to monitor both the location of nanocarriers and the
therapeutic eﬀects of the intervention. Therefore, IONPs can be loaded with a
very broad range of therapeutic moieties (e.g. anticancer drugs, nucleic acids,
and chemical inhibitors) to achieve synergistic therapies, giving more eﬀective
treatment than single functional treatment modalities.
It is known that the reductive ability of the tumour cytosol and the GSH
content in tumour tissues is more than four times higher than that in
healthy tissues.260 The tumour microenvironment (TME) also often features
vascular abnormalities, high lactate levels, low glucose levels, low pH, and
224
Chapter 4

hypoxia. In recent years, MnO2 constructs have attracted interest for TME-
responsive theranostics.261 The MnO2 reacts with the elevated levels of H1,
GSH, and H2O2 in the tumour, releasing paramagnetic Mn21 ions which
provide T1 contrast enhancement (highlighting fat) in MRI. MnO2 materials
have been combined with upconversion photodynamic NPs for TME re-
sponsive drug delivery and generation of O2. The latter ameliorates the tu-
mour hypoxia, giving enhanced chemo-photodynamic (PDT) therapy and
multiple imaging modalities under NIR light excitation. Degradation of the
MnO2 material results in enhanced T1 MRI signals.262 Biodegradable hollow
manganese dioxide nanomaterials have also been applied for combined PTT
and MRI imaging.263 In other work, Chen et al. used ultrathin 2D MnO2
nanosheets for highly eﬃcient and TME-targeted PTT.264
Theranostic systems based on MnO2 have been systematically investigated
both in vitro and in vivo, and found to be potent for suppressing tumour
growth. Dai et al.265 fabricated 2D RGO nanosheets with a MnO2/TiO2 so-
nosensitiser (MnOx/TiO2–GR) for enhancing sonodynamic cancer therapy
(SDT, in which sensitisers are activated by ultrasound to generate ROS;
Figure 4.12). The nanocomposites have high electrical conductivity, a rich
surface chemistry, and high photothermal-conversion capability. The RGO
allows for potent US and PTT performance, while the presence of MnOx
allows for pH-responsive MRI imaging. In other work, a biocompatible
Gd-integrated CuS nanotheranostic agent (Gd:CuS@BSA) was generated via
a biomimetic strategy.266 The Gd:CuS@BSA NPs demonstrated good MRI
contrast, and were further able to achieve tumour ablation through the PTT
eﬀect. They had high spatial resolution and deep tissue penetration.
4.4.2
CT-guided Therapy
Computed tomography (CT) imaging (see Sections 4.2 and 4.2.2.4) is a
medical imaging procedure based on the interaction of X-rays with the body
and/or a contrast agent.267 CT has high spatial resolution and allows rapid
image acquisition.17 CT can only detect down to approximately 102 M
concentrations of a contrast agent, however,268 and the use of such high
doses raises concerns about toxicity. To optimise therapy and monitor dis-
ease progression, CT imaging-guided therapy has emerged as a potential
strategy for personalised theranostics.
Cheng et al. described PEGylated WS2 nanosheets with CT imaging prop-
erties that could be used to guide the PTT of cancer. The CT signal strength of
PEGylated WS2 nanosheets was higher than that of similar MoS2 nanosheets
because of the stronger X-ray attenuation ability of W (this correlates
with atomic number).269,270 Hence, a range of tungsten oxide-based NPs,
nanosheets, and nanorods has been explored for simultaneous CT imaging
and PTT.271 Related to this, Liu et al. have prepared PEGylated WO3x NPs for
combined near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF) and CT imaging of
cancer.98,153,272 In other work Li et al. prepared BSA modified bismuth
nanoraspberries as alternative CT–PTT theranostics,180 and observed the CT
Diagnostic and Theranostic Applications of Inorganic Materials
225

contrast to be much improved over values recorded previously.273 Also using
bismuth, Lei et al. produced ultrasmall PVP-protected bismuth nanodots
which were found to be highly biocompatible, as well as showing great promise
for theranostic CT–PTT.17
Iridium-based nanomaterials, such as IrO2, have also attracted some
attention in CT-based theranostics. This is in part owing to their high
catalytic activity for oxygen evolution reactions.274 Although relatively little
explored, iridium has a high atomic number (Z ¼ 77), and its high stability
relative to tungsten-based oxides indicates that IrO2 could also serve as a

powerful CT contrast agent. Zhen et al. described the development of a
theranostic agent based on BSA–IrO2 NPs.275 The BSA–IrO2 NPs could be
used for multimodal PA, CT, and photothermal-imaging-guided PTT. Simi-
larly, mesoporous ZrO2 hollow nanospheres have also been shown to en-
hance CT imaging-guided PTT.47
Lighter elements also have potential in CT theranostics. Meng et al. suc-
cessfully prepared core–shell CuO@ZrO2 nanocomposites which could
continuously produce oxygen under microwave irradiation, allowing a
combined treatment by microwave thermal therapy and chemotherapy, with
CT possible by dint of inclusion of Zr.47 In other work, mesoporous silica
coated upconversion NPs (UCNPs@mSiO2) with a covalently loaded photo-
sensitiser (chlorin e6) were prepared to act as NIR mediated PDT agents, and
an MnO2 shell grown on the exterior.262 MnO2 degradation in the TME re-
leases Mn21 ions and allows trimodal (upconversion luminescence, CT, and
MRI) imaging. The loading of the anticancer drug DOX into the core per-
mitted this to be released only in the TME. The UCNPs@mSiO2 system could
further relieve tumour hypoxia by inducing decomposition of endogenous
H2O2 and reduction of glutathione.
4.4.3
PA-guided Therapy
PA imaging is based on the excitation of tissue chromophores using a short-
pulsed laser beam (see Sections 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.3.3).5,276 It oﬀers significantly
enhanced imaging depth and spatial resolution compared with traditional
optical imaging.277,278 PA-based theranostics have been developed using in-
organic systems on a number of occasions. For instance, PTT systems com-
bined with ultrasound (US) and PA imaging have been synthesised based on
perfluorohexane
(PFH)-loaded
hollow
mesoporous
Prussian
blue
NPs
(HMPBs) (Figure 4.13).279 The thermal eﬀects induced by NIR and US ex-
posure induced a liquid-to-gas phase transformation of PFH and permitted
contrast-enhanced US imaging. The PTT properties of the HMPBs addition-
ally endowed them with PA-imaging capabilities,280 as well as permitting
eﬀective tumour ablation.
The fact that PTT materials can also produce PA waves under pulsed ir-
radiation lends them readily to PA-based theranostics.9 For instance, Qian et al.
prepared 2D TiS2 nanosheets for combined PA imaging and PTT in vivo.281
Strong photoacoustic performance has also been shown with Ta4C3 (MXene)
nanosheets, again meaning that PA can be used to guide PTT.282 Moving
away from the transition metals, Chen et al. prepared PEG modified single-
walled carbon nanohorns for PA guided PTT.283 Silica-based formulations
have also been explored for US/PA dual-modality imaging guided chemo-
photothermal therapy.284 The combination of multiple inorganic species can
be very powerful here: Lu et al. reported a multifunctional theranostic based
on poly(amidoamine)-stabilised gold nanoflowers embedded with ultrasmall
IONPs. These could be employed for multimodal MRI/CT/PA imaging-guided
combination PTT and radiotherapy of tumours.49

Fluorescence Imaging-guided Therapy
Fluorescence
imaging
(FI)
involves
detecting
the
light
emission
of
fluorophores promoted by light excitation at a specific wavelength. The
fundamental principles are explained in more detail in Chapter 3,
Section 3.3.3.285 FI-based theranostics allow drug release to be monitored
by fluorescent bio-imaging. QDs have great potential in this regard.286,287
For instance, ZnS:Mn QDs are potent in two-photon imaging under NIR-II
excitation.288 Chen et al. prepared a novel platform based on the photo-
sensitiser sinoporphyrin sodium loaded onto PEGylated GO. This could be
used for enhanced fluorescence imaging guided PDT.289
4.4.5
Multimodal Imaging-guided Therapy
Multimodal imaging (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3.7) combines the advantages
of multiple imaging approaches, allowing, for instance, both high sensitivity
and high penetration depth from a single platform.290,291 In addition to
combinations of diﬀerent imaging modalities, drug molecules can be in-
corporated into the probes, producing theranostic agents.200
Lietal. have reported a light-responsive biodegradable PFP-loaded nanorattle
with a thin mesoporous silica shell and a gold nanorod core which can simul-
taneously provide US/PA dual-modality imaging.292 MoS2 nanoflowers (80 nm)
have been combined with IGC, Pt, and IONPs to yield MoS2@Fe3O4–ICG/Pt(IV)
nanocomposites.293 These systems showed considerable promise in multi-
modal MRI/infrared thermal/PA bioimaging, and eﬀective PTT/PDT/chemo-
therapy, as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Cao et al. fabricated a MnO2/
Cu2xS-siRNA with PTT and PDT therapeutic eﬃciency which was also potent
in PA and MRI imaging.294 In other work, integrated IrO2–MnO2 theranostics
have been prepared through BSA-based biomineralisation of Ir31 and Mn21.295

BSA was first covalently modified with Ce6, and used to fabricate multi-
functional BSA–Ce6@IrO2/MnO2 NPs for CT and PA imaging-guided PDT and
PTT of cancer.

Conclusion and Perspectives
Theranostics is a novel and fast-developing field. It involves the integration
of diagnostic and therapeutic entities in a single platform. In this chapter,
we first introduce a range of inorganic materials, selected from those
that are the most promising as theranostic agents. The advantages and
disadvantages of each platform are considered. The physical properties of
inorganic NPs important for diagnostic and theranostic application are
discussed, including scattering, absorption, fluorescence, photoacoustic
behaviour, Raman enhancement, and MRI contrast. While inorganic NPs
have tremendous promise, their translation to clinical applications still faces
challenges, and in particular their chronic toxicity and bioaccumulation
need to be studied more rigorously. Inorganic systems can facilitate a range
of imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, NIRF, PA, and US imaging to
provide precise spatiotemporal information about the aetiology of a disease:
for instance, the location, size, and shape of a tumour. Inorganic NPs also
can be loaded with active ingredients and/or applied for tumour ablation,
because they become toxic in response to external stimuli, such as light,
magnetic fields, or ultrasound. All these systems can be modified with tar-
geting moieties responsive to, for instance, low-pH or reducing conditions,
or to cell surface receptors, allowing therapy to be precisely targeted and
side-eﬀects obviated. Overall, inorganic NPs have demonstrated tremendous
promise as theranostics for detection and treatment of a range of diseases,
cancer in particular. If the current safety concerns are resolved, inorganic
NPs have a bright future for diagnostic and theranostic applications.

5.1
Orthopaedic Medical Devices
With an ageing human population who participate regularly in physical
activities, there has been an increase in bone-related diseases, such as
osteoporosis (conditions that weaken the bones), osteoarthritis (inflam-
mation in bone joints), bone infections (osteomyelitis and periodontitis),
and bone fractures (open and closed traumatic fractures), which result in
pain or loss of function. It has been estimated that 15% of the world’s
population experiences pain and joint degeneration due to osteoarthritis.1
A study estimating the fracture burden associated with osteoporosis in
Europe predicted a 28% annual increase in the number of fractures, with
3.5 million in 2010 rising to 4.5 million in 2025.2 Consequently, there has
been a significant increase in the requirement for orthopaedic medical

devices to restore function lost via debilitating illnesses or trauma to the
musculoskeletal system. This global challenge is reflected in another study
‘Projections of Primary and Revision Hip and Knee Arthroplasty in the
United States from 2005 to 2030’, which predicted that by 2030, the demand
for joint-replacement procedures including primary total hip arthroplasties
(THA) would grow by 174% to 572 000, while the demand for primary total
knee arthroplasties would increase by 673% to 3.48 million procedures.
Added to this, significant increases in the number of revision procedures to
remedy failed, infected, or worn joint-replacements were also forecast.3
Hard tissue orthopaedic implants are widely used in repair, replacement, or
augmentation of diseased or damaged parts of the body, for instance bones,
joints, and teeth. A dental implant is an artificial tooth root replacement used
in prosthetic dentistry and can have a number of manifestations including
screws, cylinders or blades which are surgically placed into the jawbone and
can hold one or more prosthetic teeth. There are many types of orthopaedic
implants, which can becategorised as bone attachment devicesand stabilisers
(e.g. intramedullary nail, plates, screws, pins, and wires), artificial joints (hip,
knee arthroplasties, shoulder replacement), artificial ligaments and tendons
(bone and suture anchor systems), artificial spine devices (intervertebral disc
systems, vertebral body replacement systems) and biologics and tissue re-
generation inducers (bone grafts and fillers, osteochondral grafts and osteo-
genic inducers),4,5 as depicted in Figure 5.1. Joint arthroplasties are used to
relieve pain or restore range of motion by reconstructing lower limb joints
such as the hip, knee, and ankle. Total hip replacement (THR) involves using
components such as acetabular cups, femoral heads and stems, whereas knee
implants consist of two types (i) unilateral replacement, patella femoral joint
replacement or (ii) total knee replacement.
A number of desirable criteria exist with respect to implants used in
orthopaedic and trauma applications and have been described by Geetha
et al.,6 although diﬀerent requirements can exist depending on the location

and the implant application. Some implants, e.g. fracture fixation plates and
screws, are only intended for temporary placement and are removed from
the body following healing. Consequently, they have low to moderate re-
quirements to integrate with native bone tissue. Other implants, such as
joint replacements, are required to provide support over an entire lifetime
and hence have high bone integration requirements, whereby a strong and
intimate contact exists between the implant and surrounding bone tissue.7
Irrespective of application, device biocompatibility is desirable and refers to
materials that do ‘not elicit an unresolved inflammatory response or dem-
onstrate immunogenicity or cytotoxicity’.8 The success of the implant is
mainly dependent on the reaction of the human body to it. The two main
factors that aﬀect the biocompatibility are related to the response induced by
the material in the host, and the material’s degradation within the host.
Both must be non-toxic and should not cause any inflammatory response or
allergic reaction.
Implants require suitable mechanical properties for their intended use.
Implants used for high load bearing applications are subjected to repeated
cyclic loads and strains. Therefore, it is important to have high mechanical
strength (tensile strength) and Young’s modulus (stiﬀness) similar to that of
bone in order to prevent implant loosening and ensure lifetime function-
ality. Implants, particularly those intended for permanent implantation,
should also demonstrate high corrosion and wear resistance: low resistance to
corrosion and wear results in the release of ions or wear debris into the body,
which can elicit allergic or toxic reactions.6 Articulating surfaces, such as
joints, require durability and resistance to wear.9 In many cases hard tissue
implants must form a secure bond with the bone in order to promote
stability to the load bearing implants. Osteointegration, or integration into
surrounding bone, is essential for the long-term success of hip and knee
arthroplasties.10,11 If the implant surface fails to integrate with the adjacent
bone micromotions can result, which will subsequently lead to failure due to
implant loosening.6 Particularly in the case of artificial joints, stabilisation
of the implant can be supported using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)
bone cements. However, one of the main drawbacks associated with PMMA
cements is their poor osteointegration. In cementless procedures, the
surface of the implant is in contact with native bone tissue and plays an
important role in ensuring integration. To increase the chances of success,
surfaces are roughened to provide an increased surface area for native bone
contact and integration. Factors influencing the success of implantation
and material selection of hard tissue implants are discussed further in
later sections.
These are complex and varied requirements, which are also aﬀected by the
surgical intervention required and the particular procedural and clinical risk
factors.12 A diverse array of materials, including polymers, metals, ceramics,
and composite materials, have been utilised in orthopaedic procedures,
since no single material can address all the demands. Weight-bearing
implants (hip joint) are predominantly manufactured using metals and
244
Chapter 5

high-strength ceramics because these materials possess inherent mechan-
ical properties to ensure device success. However, they also often lack the
ability to ensure a structural and functional connection between the living
bone and the implant. Consequently, many implants require surface treat-
ments (e.g. roughening of the surface) or deposition of a bioactive coating to
enhance integration with bone and ensure stable fixation. Inorganic bioac-
tive materials including bioactive glasses (BG), glass-ceramics, calcium
phosphate (CaP) ceramics, and bioactive composites13 have been employed
in several guises, such as bulk implants to replace bones or teeth, coatings to
anchor orthopaedic or dental devices, or in the form of powders or sintered
as bone grafts, to fill various types of bone defects.
Due to the brittle nature of BG and CaP ceramics, they are not suitable on
their own for load bearing sites under cyclic loads. Consequently, they have
predominantly been used as defect fillers, or as coatings for weight bearing
applications (e.g. prostheses), with the aim of protecting the device against
chemical attack, mitigating against adverse events such as inflammatory
reaction (by making the prosthesis biocompatible), and imparting bioactive
characteristics on otherwise non-bioactive implant surfaces.14
Once the implant is inserted into the body, a cascade of chemical and
biological reactions occurs at the device–bone interface. Bone regeneration
is a complex biological process influenced by the interplay between device
properties and the host. Problems owing to wear debris, osteolysis,
inflammation, implant loosening, and implant associated infections (IAI)
can compromise the long-term success of orthopaedic devices. This repre-
sents a significant problem both for patients in terms of their quality of life
and for the healthcare system.15,16 Also, there is a need to extend the lifetime
of current orthopaedic implants and improve implant function, particularly
in challenging cases such as revision surgeries, younger and/or more active
patients, and in patients with co-morbidities where healing may be
compromised (e.g. osteoporosis).7
5.2
Bone Structure and Remodeling
Bone is an extremely dense form of connective tissue (osseous tissues),
which in its various shapes makes up the human skeletal frame. Bone has
three main functions. The first is a mechanical role in the support of sur-
rounding tissues and organs, whilst also providing sites for attachment for
the ligaments, tendons and muscles which are involved in bodily move-
ments. Secondly, it plays a role in calcium (Ca) homeostasis. Bone is a Ca
reservoir, and exchanges bone minerals with the fluids of the body. Finally, it
has a role in haematopoiesis (blood cell renewal): bone marrow supplies the
body with nutrient-carrying red blood cells and infection fighting white
blood cells.17,18 Bone exhibits remarkable mechanical properties (e.g. com-
pressive strength and fracture toughness), which is attributable to its com-
position and the hierarchical arrangement of its constituents at multiple
length-scales.10,19–21

245

Osseous tissues contain specialised cells and a matrix consisting of 65–70%
by weight biomineral and 5–8% water, with the remainder including organic
materials. The mineral phase is largely composed of CaP based materials,
the principal component being carbonated hydroxyapatite (cHA). The cHA
provides structural reinforcement to the tough and flexible organic matrix,
which is composed of 90% collagen and 10% non-collagenous proteins.
Non-collagenous proteins include osteocalcin, osteonectin, and osteopontin,
which play important roles in controlling cell functions.17 The collagen
molecules arrange in an overlapping manner providing a fibrillar framework
for the nucleation and subsequent growth of bone mineral, as shown in
Figure 5.2. The latter comprises nanoscale crystalline minerals deposited
periodically within gap zones along the collagen fibrils, contributing to an
ordered nanostructured surface.10,19,20 The collagen fibrils aggregate, stack in
parallel and arrange in lamellae that organise concentrically around a central
Haversian canal, which contains nerve and blood vessels. These cylindrical
microstructures, known as osteons or Haversian systems, are the basic build-
ing blocks of mature, cortical bone and run roughly parallel to its long-axis.22,23
Volksmann’s canals are channels that run perpendicular to osteons and
connect the blood vessels of adjacent Haversian canals.24
Macroscopically, two types of bone are present, which can be dis-
tinguished on the basis of their diﬀerent structural organisation. On the
exterior, the structural, calcified, protective layer is known as compact or
cortical bone, consists of osteons, and represents the majority of total bone
mass (80–85%) in adult humans. The remainder is comprised of cancellous
(trabecular) bone, which is more porous (50–90%) and anatomically consists

appearance.18,23,25 The outer bone surface is covered in a thin fibrous
periosteum layer and the inner surface is covered in endosteum that marks
the boundary between the cortical and cancellous bone.24,26
Bone is a dynamic tissue that undergoes constant remodeling during an
individual’s lifetime. Key to this are the closely balanced activities of bone
resorption and bone formation, which are regulated by specialised cells
including
osteoprogenitors,
osteoblasts,
osteocytes,
and
osteoclasts.27
The activities of these cells are responsible for growth, development, and
remodelling of bone (Figure 5.3). Osteoblasts are the main cells responsible
for bone formation. Osteoprogenitor cells are derived from stem cells
originating in the mesenchyme.28 They diﬀerentiate under the influence of
external stimuli, including induction agents [hormones and growth factors,
particularly bone morphogentic proteins (BMPs)] and inflammation, into
pre-osteoblast and then to osteoblast cells.29–32
Osteoblast cells play a vital role in the bone repair process and implant
success. They are responsible for synthesising bone through the production of
new bone matrix in a process called osteogenesis. Osteoblasts synthesise
organic bone matrix (osteoid), which is followed by mineralisation around the
osteoid.32,33 Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an important enzyme responsible

for the crystallisation of Ca salts, which leads to the subsequent hardening and
calcification of the matrix.29,34 After osteoid secretion osteoblasts are subject to
several fates. They may become quiescent bone lining cells, undergo apoptosis,
or terminally diﬀerentiate into osteocytes and become embedded into the
mineralised matrix.35 Bone lining cells are thought to play a role in coupling
bone resorption and bone formation.36 Osteocytes form a complex network in
the bone, are mechanosensors, contribute to maintaining the bone matrix
structure, and also participate in the repair of damaged bone.17,33,37,38
Bone remodelling is a tightly regulated process governed by the interplay
between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. During this process pre-osteoblasts
recruit hematopoietic stem cells and induce their diﬀerentiation into large,
multinucleated, osteoclasts via the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B
(RANK)–RANK ligand (RANKL) signalling pathway. This pathway is modulated
by osteoblastic secretion of osteoprotegerin (OPG), which acts as a soluble
decoy receptor for RANKL thereby preventing RANKL binding and activating
the RANK receptor on the surface of osteoclasts.39 Osteoclasts have a key role in
bone resorption: they remove and recycle bone matrix by secreting acid and
proteolytic enzymes that dissolve bone.40,41 This erosion process is important
in the regulation of calcium and phosphate concentrations in bodily fluids.
Resorption products and osteoclast-derived factors contribute to the inter-
relationship between bone formation and resorption. The balance of the
RANKL : OPG ratio is important in controlling the remodelling process and is
influenced by many growth factors and cytokines.42,43
Bone remodelling is extremely important for repairing micro-damage that
occurs during normal daily activity, and replacing bone during the growth
process and following fracture injuries.44,45 When the osteoclasts remove
calcium salts faster than the osteoblasts deposit them the bone becomes
weak, leading to osteoporosis. However, dense and stronger bone arises
from muscular stress as a result of exercise, due to enhanced osteoblast
activity.17 Macrophages, from the same lineage as osteoclasts, are crucial
in early inflammatory phases of bone healing, removing debris from
bone fracture and surgical implantations.46,47 Specialised macrophages
termed osteomacs have been suggested to play important roles in bone
remodelling, such as regulating osteoblast mineralisation, stimulating
osteoblast diﬀerentiation, and regulating osteoclast activity.48–51
5.3
Factors Influencing the Success of Orthopaedic
Implants
5.3.1
Implant Fixation at the Biological Interface
When an implant is inserted into the body, there are a number of key
interactions, both biological and chemical, which govern events leading to
the formation of bonds between the biomaterial and bone, and the ultimate
integration of the implant with the host tissue. A number of cellular com-
ponents involved in the formation and regulation of bone development are
248
Chapter 5

integral to this process. The implant surface properties have a particularly
significant influence. Biomaterials used in hard tissue repair and replace-
ment may be described by their propensity to induce and support new
bone formation, in addition to their ability to directly bond with bone
tissue.28
Osteoinduction involves the recruitment of immature osteoprogenitor
cells, and the stimulation (induction agents, hormones, and inflammation
response) of these cells to develop into pre-osteoblasts which then mature
into osteoblasts. In trauma events, such as fractures, induction agents are
released to initiate the healing process. Osteoconduction is the process by
which bone grows on a surface with the provision of a scaﬀold, such as the
case with an implant. Since osteoblasts are responsible for the synthesis,
deposition, and mineralisation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the bone,
adhesion of osteoblasts is considered an important step in osteoconduction.
Osteointegration describes the stable anchorage of an implant achieved by
direct bone-to-implant contact. Successful integration involves connection
to the living tissues by the formation of bony tissue around the implant,
without the growth of fibrous tissue at the bone–implant interface. Osteo-
blastic and osteoclastic activities are mainly responsible for the osteo-
integration of implants.28
The success of the implantation is governed by how well the first phase of
osteoblast attachment and adhesion occurs. This will then lead to subsequent
osteoblast proliferation and diﬀerentiation on contact with the implant
surface, resulting in deposition of bone matrix. When an implant comes into
contact with a biological environment, the implant surface becomes con-
ditioned with a layer of adsorbed protein. Osteoblasts attach themselves to the
conditioned layer on the implant surface through electrostatic interactions and
van der Waals forces. Several ECM and plasma proteins, such as fibronectin
and vibronectin, have been shown to mediate cell–substrate attachment due to
the presence of specific sequences recognised by integrins.52–54 The best
known of these is the tripeptide sequence Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD), which is
found in ECM proteins such as fibronectin. These recognition sequences play
important roles not only in cell–substrate adhesion but also in proliferation,
cell migration, growth, and diﬀerentiation.54 Cell–implant adhesion activation
is essential for signal transduction and regulation of gene expression for col-
lagen and other bone proteins. The process of Ca ion influx is also activated by
cell adhesion.55
5.3.2
Controlling the Biological Interaction at the
Implant Interface
Bone tissue regeneration is a complex, coordinated, temporal process in-
volving molecular, cellular, biochemical, and mechanical cues.56 The cell–
substrate interaction is a critical factor in the success of osteoblast adhesion
and the subsequent osteoconduction process. Consequently, the physico-
chemical and biological properties of the biomaterial play an important role.

It is well established that the surface characteristics of the implant will de-
termine which biomolecules will adsorb and condition the surface. The
composition, type, amount, and conformation of these protein biomolecules
will, in turn, influence osteoblast attachment and proliferation and osteo-
genic diﬀerentiation.57–59 Advances in our understanding of the key material
properties that govern interactions at the biological interface, including
surface chemistry, energy, roughness, topography, and wettability, and the
associated mechanisms have provided important insights into biomaterials
design and control over cellular responses.60–63
The chemistry of surface functional groups dictates which biological mol-
ecules adsorb on the surface and their subsequent orientation. It also directly
influences cell adhesion, spreading and tissue formation.7,64–66 The surface
chemistry can be tuned to control the degree of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
groups on the surface, thereby altering wettability. Cell adhesion is generally
better on hydrophilic surfaces than hydrophobic ones,67,68 which has been
attributed to better wetting properties of the former.69 Approaches to enhance
biological interaction have often sought to engineer topographical features to
mimic the tissue’s native structural environment and control cell–substrate
interactions.70 This has involved manipulating materials at the molecular and
supramolecular level. Functionalisation of titanium (Ti) surfaces with peptides
including RGD has been shown to significantly increase osteointegration
(in vivo) compared with unmodified Ti substrates.71,72 One study engineered
elastin-like protein (ELP) coatings on the surfaces of Ti-based dental and
orthopaedic implants.73 The ELP included an extended RGD sequence to
confer bio-signaling, and an elastin-like sequence for mechanical stability.
Scalable spin- and dip-coaing processes were used to fabricate thin film coat-
ings on commerically pure Ti (cp-Ti) and grade V Ti alloy [Ti6Al4V; Ti with 6%
aluminium (Al) and 4% vanadium (V)] surfaces. The coatings could withstand
procedures mimicking dental screw and hip replacement stem implantation,
which is fundamental to clinical translation.
It is generally accepted that the three dimensional (3D) surface topography
(shape, size and surface texture) of the implant is one of the most important
parameters that influences cellular reactions to it.55,74,75 One study investi-
gated a novel surface architecture termed OsteoAnchor to enhance primary
fixation in cementless orthopaedic implants. The architecture, composed of
tiny anchor features on a porous substructure, was designed to help embed the
device into the bone during implantation and ensure immediate mechanical
fixation.76 In vitro testing in ovine cadaver femurs under the application of
cyclic loads indicated significant reduction in micromotion amplitude. This
was further supported by a preclinical study in an ovine model that demon-
strated improved primary fixation. Histological evaluation of excised femurs
after 16 weeks demonstrated bone ingrowth in the porous architecture of
OsteoAnchor implants. However, bone ingrowth was not achieved in the case
of stems treated with standard plasma sprayed Ti coatings.76,77
Much research has evaluated osteoblast behaviour (attachment, prolifer-
ation, and osteogenic diﬀerentiation) on the micro (1–10 mm) and nano (o1 mm)

structure of substrates,19,78–81 highlighting that the quality of the bone–implant
interface is influenced by the surface roughness.81 Increasing the surface area
and roughness acts to maximise the interlocking process between the min-
eralised bone and the implant surface, thereby helping to reduce micromotion
and increase osteointegration. Smoother implant surfaces can induce fibrous
tissue growth and implant loosening in vivo, as compared with the significant
osteoconductive properties of roughened implants.82 Diﬀerent techniques,
such as chemical etching and sand-blasting, have been used to alter the
surface roughness and thereby promote osteointegration.80,82
It is increasingly recognised that biomaterials designed to eﬀectively
regenerate bone need to recapitulate the native tissue on multiple length
scales, given that cells interact and respond depending on material
properties at both the micrometre and nanometre scales.83 Advances in
technology and techniques have enabled a deeper understanding of the
nanoscale interactions between cells and materials. Together with ad-
vancements in fabrication, this has translated to the reproducible design of
biomaterials with nanoscale features.84–87 Nanomaterials encompass those
with nano-sized topography or nano-sized structures. Examples include
materials with a basic structural unit in the range of 1–100 nm, individual or
multi-layer surface coatings with a thickness in the range of 1–100 nm, and
crystal solids, powders, or fibres with dimensions between 1 and 100 nm.88
Materials exhibiting nanoscale features can demonstrate advantageous
properties in terms of surface wettability, chemistry, and topography, due to
greater surface roughness and increased surface area per unit volume.89 It is
well established that nanomaterials such as nano-HA can enhance inter-
action with, and adsorption of, the proteins that are essential for cell ad-
hesion, as seen in Figure 5.4.90,91 These properties can be exploited to more

closely replicate the natural bone environment and to promote cell growth
and enhance tissue regeneration, in addition to aiding infection control.92–95
Nanotechnology has been investigated in a number of contexts for the
design of next-generation devices, including using nano-structured coatings
and nanotextured surfaces to improve implantation success. From the per-
sepctive of device design, in vitro studies using nanophase materials,
including alumina, titania, and HA, demonstrated increases in osteoblast
proliferation, synthesis of ALP, and deposition of Ca-containing minerals
compared with conventional counterparts.96 The production of much
thinner coating layers using nanotechnology has been advocated to over-
come the problems of third body reactions to wear particles released from
thicker coatings, as well as being able to regulate inflammation and enable
osteoinductivity.97
A number of studies favour the use of nano-biomaterials over particles in
the micron size range.98 Enhanced osteoinduction and osteointegration can
be achieved by mimicking the nano-size biological apatite crystals that
constitute the inorganic component of bone.99 When tested as a filler
material, nanoparticles of BG have demonstrated significantly increased
bone formation after 30 days in canine models in comparison to con-
ventional micron sized particles (Novabones). These findings are ascribed
to
increased
interactions
with
the
biological
environment.100
Nano-
bioceramic or polymer composites have also been intensively researched
to improve interaction with the host tissue and cells. One study compared
properties of degradable film matrices composed of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)
[P(3HB)] polymer and bioactive glass particles (see Section 5.4.6 for more
detail) in the nano (29 nm) and micron (o5 mm) size range. Nanosized BG
particles displayed more beneficial mechanical and structural properties
when compared with composites containing microparticulate BG. The
nanoparticulate BG also improved protein adsorption compared with the
P(3HB) polymer and microparticle-BG composites, but there was no sub-
stantial diﬀerence in the proliferation of MG-63 osteoblasts on the
diﬀerent substrates.101,102
5.3.3
Problems Associated with Orthopaedic Implants
The reasons for implant failure can be categorised into three groups: patient-
related factors, implant-related factors, and those related to poor surgical
tecnhique.103 The leading causes of failure for joint arthroplasty protheses
include aseptic loosening and infection.104,105 While these are often con-
sidered discretely, the presence of inflammation in aspectic loosening is also
considered to increase the infection risk.104

Aseptic Loosening
Aseptic loosening describes implant failure that is the direct result of loosening
of the implant without the presence of infection, and it is the most common

cause requiring revision of major arthroplasties.105 One study reported that
aseptic loosening accounted for 51.9% of revision hip arthroplasties.103 Aseptic
loosening is a disabling condition that can aﬀect patients 10 to 20 years fol-
lowing THA and clinical symptoms of inflammation, impaired function and
excessive pain are generally not apparent until late stages of failure.106,107
Revision surgery is often neccessary to overcome this problem. According to
Abu-Ameretal.,asepticlooseningcanbetheresultofpoorinitialfixation(bone–
implant bonding), mechanical loss of fixation over time or biological loss of
fixaton caused byparticulatedebris (metallic,polymeric,and ceramic) inducing
osteolysis (tissue inflammation and cell death) around the implant.106 This is
illustrated in Figure 5.5. A number of failure scenarios for aseptic loosening of

ling cascade and subsequent osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption.

cemented and cementless implants have been suggested, as outlined
below,108,109 although it is also considered that multiple variables typically
aﬀect the aetiology rather than a single factor.105
 Damage accumulation failure involves the gradual cracking of cement or
coating over time as a consequence of load bearing activities and/or
cyclic loading. This results in interfacial de-bonding called delamina-
tion, which can influence the long-term mechanical integrity of the
implant and lead to implant failure.
 Wear debris inflammation arises due to particulates breaking oﬀ
from the implant surface either from the coating–metal interface or
metal–metal interface of the implant. The debris can migrate to the
implant–bone interface and result in osteolysis.
 Stress shielding failure: For longevity of the implant, the biomaterial
must possess similar mechanical properties to those of bone. If mis-
matches exist, transfer of stress to the underlying tissue will result,
leading to bone cell death.
 Stress bypass failure: Sometimes fixations in the body can be hetero-
geneous, leading to stress transfer over localised spots. Bone ingrowth
can be patchy at the implant–bone interface, and stability of the im-
plant is weakened.
 Growth failure: A high frequency of micromotion of the implant relative
to the bone can inhibit osseous growth, giving rise to inadequate
bonding as a result of gaps between the implant and bone (43 mm).
If bonding does not occur a fibrous membrane will form on the implant
surface, and the strength of the bonding between the implant and bone
is compromised.
 Destructive wear failure: This refers to the disintegration of the joint
replacement prosthesis as a result of load bearing activities. The
modular components of the implant gradually wear out and the
mechanical integrity can no longer be maintained.
The provision of a bioactive surface onto which the bone can strongly bond
will successfully limit micromotions at the implant–host interface and prevent
aseptic loosening. Strong attachment can be achieved by positively enhancing
the interactions (biological, chemical, and mechanical) that occur at the
implant–bone interface. Consequently, there is a fundamental need for
materials with good mechanical and biological compatibility, enhanced wear
and corrosion resistance, and superior bioactivity to improve the mechanical
interlocking between the implant’s surface and living tissue.11
5.3.3.2
Implant Associated Infections
Despite sterilisation, aseptic procedures and pre-operative prophylactic
antibiotic regimens, IAI remain one of the principal problems which arise
following orthopaedic implant surgery.110 The incidence of infection has been
254
Chapter 5

reported to vary betweeno1 and 5% depending on the procedure (arthroplasty,
fracture fixation), although higher incidences of up to 30% have been noted
after fixation of complex open fractures.111–115 While the overall incidence of
orthopaedic infection is low, the absolute number is increasing, due to the
growing number of patients requiring orthopaedic implants. Furthermore,
problems of infection are exacerbated in patients with co-morbidity factors.116
Given the major impact on patients’ quality of life and the cost to the health-
care system, infection represents a significant problem.16,113
Infections arise as a result of bacterial adhesion and subsequent colonisa-
tion, which can result in biofilm formation at the implantation site.117–119
Biofilms form when microorganisms cluster and become encased in a matrix
of extracellular polymer substance (EPS). This enables cells to survive under
adverse conditions, supporting the colonisation of new niches via scattering of
the microbes. Biofilm associated infections (BAI) are particularly challenging
as they contain heterogeneous cell populations and the gene expression profile
of cells can alter dramatically when cells adhere and become encased in the
biofilm. For example, genes related to molecular components found in the EPS
and those that anchor the cells to the surface are upregulated in adherent cells.
Consequently, the phenotype of bacteria encased in the biofilm can diﬀer
significantly from those of planktonic cells of the same species.9,120,121 Biofilms
also oﬀer protection from the host’s defences and from antibiotic treatment,
thereby making infections diﬃcult to eradicate.122–124 Indeed, bacteria
encased in biofilms have been reported to resist antibiotic concentrations
of between 100 and 1000 times higher than those required to eliminate the
same bacteria in the planktonic state.125 The formation of the biofilm on the
implant surface leads to reduced stability and ultimately its failure. The most
common bacteria responsible for such infections are Staphylococcus species,
in particular Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Staphylococcus epidermidis
(S. epidermidis).119 Common sources of BAI include contaminated implant or
device surfaces, exogenous pathogens from skin, surgical instrumentation,
local environment, and distant local infections in the patient.126
5.3.3.2.1
Biofilm Formation.
Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation
is a complex multi-step process heavily influenced by host factors (including
the biological fluid in the local environment), the physicochemical character-
istics of the biomaterial or implant surface, and the properties of the
microbe.127 Bacteria including S. aureus are recognised to adhere to implant
surfaces due to a combination of reversible passive mechanisms and
irreversible active mechanisms. Active adhesion is complex and may be me-
diated by several mechanisms, including through species-specific proteins
and binding of adhesins expressed by bacteria. In the case of S. aureus
strains, expression of collagen binding adhesin and fibronectin-binding
protein mediates binding with collagen and fibronectin, respectively.128
Orthopaedic implants can become coated with a ‘conditioning film’
(biomolecules) within seconds of their exposure to the biological environ-
ment. Consequently, in vivo deposition of matrix proteins like collagen can
Inorganic Biomaterials to Support the Formation and Repair of Bone Tissue
255

make the implant’s surfaces prone to adhesion of bacteria such as
Staphylococci.129 Although the exact details of the complex mechanisms in-
volved in biofilm formation are still under investigation, the classic model
describes four key steps. These include the initial attachment and adhesion
of bacteria, which is followed by cell aggregation and accumulation, biofilm
maturation and finally biofilm dispersal.130,131 Bacterial association involves
reversible cellular association with the biomaterial surface through long-
and short-range chemical interactions (electrostatic, hydrophilic–hydro-
phobic), and occurs in the first 1–2 hours of implantation. Shortly
afterwards, stronger, active, adhesion mechanisms between components on
the microbial surface and matrix proteins dominate. Bacteria cluster
together and form microcolonies, and with further development and mat-
uration the cells secrete EPS composed of exopolysaccharides, proteins,
extracellular DNA, teichoic acid, and lipoteichoic acid. This EPS forms the
biofilm matrix. Further development of the biofilm is characterised by
macrocolony formation; finally, dispersal of bacteria involves detachment of
cells from the biofilm in the planktonic form. These go on to initiate in-
fection and biofilm formation elsewhere.121,128,132 The key steps implicated
in staphylococcal biofilm formation are illustrated in Figure 5.6.
Eradicating such infections remains a challenge and BAI is one of the
most common reasons for revision surgery.133,134 Treatment of infections at
the implant site can be complicated and the approaches routinely employed
have major drawbacks. Systemic application of antibiotics can result in poor
delivery of the therapeutic to the implantation site, and the high doses
required may lead to systemic toxicity.135,136 Another approach is to use
antibiotic-loaded biomaterials. However, this is not always eﬀective, and
there is a risk of prolonged elution of low levels of the therapeutic agents
below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the target bacteria.
This increases the risk of developing antibiotic resistance.137,138 The prob-
lem is compounded by the increasing prevalence of resistant strains of
bacteria including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which is associ-
ated with higher rates of patient morbidity and mortality compared with
methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA).139,140
Treatment of these methicillin resistant infections as well as chronic IAI
depends on several factors related to the patient (complicating factors, bone
tissue, region aﬀected), implant type (prosthetic, fracture-fixation) and sta-
bility, and infection (early or late stage). Treatment can include removal of
dead, damaged and/or infected tissue (debridement) with retention of the
device, one or two-stage exchange, and removal without implantation. These
are accompanied by prolonged antibiotic treatment.112 In joint-replacement
procedures, two-stage revision surgery is the standard treatment. This con-
sists of the removal of the prosthesis, surgical debridement, and insertion of
an antibiotic loaded cement spacer (first stage). Following antibiotic therapy
for a minimum of 6 weeks, a new artificial prosthesis is implanted (second
stage).141–143 Inhibiting bacterial adhesion is often regarded as an alternative
approach in preventing implant associated infections,144 and research has

Figure 5.6
Key steps involved in Staphylococcal biofilm formation. Bacteria first adhere and colonise the implant. Cellular interaction
through adhesins and cell wall proteins supports microcolony formation. The biofilm progressively matures; an extracellular
polymeric substance (consisting of exopolysaccharide, proteins, extracellular DNA, teichoic acid, and lipoteichoic acid) is
produced and ‘towers’ composed of bacterial clusters develop. In the case of S. aureus and S. epidermidis, polysaccharide
intercellular adhesin (PIA) is the primary polysaccharide component of the biofilm matrix.128,402 An exopolysaccharide layer
called ‘glycocalyx’ forms an outer lining and anchors the biofilm.403 In the final phase, extracellular proteases and phenol-
soluble modulins contribute to cell detachment and biofilm dispersal.131

Biomaterials for Orthopaedic Implants
5.4.1
Introduction
Hard tissue implants are engineered from a wide range of biomaterials,
including bioceramics, polymers, and metals. The properties of these
materials are crucially important: their placement in the biological en-
vironment should not cause damage, nor should these materials themselves
be adversely aﬀected by biological processes.145 In many cases the
biomaterials play an important role in device success by evoking specific
biological responses which are responsible for successfully integrating and
securing the implant to living tissue, ensuring longevity of the implant and
enhancing everyday functionality.146,147
A biomaterial is defined as ‘a substance that has been engineered to take a
form which, alone or as part of a complex system, is used to direct, by control
of interactions with components of living systems, the course of any ther-
apeutic or diagnostic procedure, in human or veterinary medicine’.148 They
play a vital role in ‘ensuring the success of a medical device and are intended
to interface with biological systems to evaluate, treat, augment or replace any
tissue, organ or function of the body’.149 Biomaterials can be described as
being bioactive, bioinert, and/or biocompatible. A bioactive material is one
that elicits a specific response at the interface of the material, resulting in
the formation of a bond between tissues and the material, including
bonding directly to bone.149,150 A selection of inorganic materials, such as
silicate glasses, glass-ceramics, and CaP with defined chemical com-
positions, have demonstrated desirable properties including bioactivity and
resorbability, indicating their suitability for orthopaedic applications.151
For the purposes of biomedical implants, the term bioinert can be defined
as ‘a minimal level of response from the host tissue’ although implants can
become covered in a thin fibrous layer.152
The
evolution
of
biomaterials,
according
to
Hench
and
Polak,
encompasses three generations: bioinert materials, such as the use of bio-
medical metals (first generation); bioactive and biodegradable materials (e.g.
CaP
coatings
and
drug
delivery
systems;
second
generation);
and
materials designed to stimulate specific cellular responses at the molecular
level to promote healing (third generation biomaterials153). Much research
on hard tissue implants has focused on first- and second-generation
materials. More recently, there has been an increasing focus on third-
generation systems for the design and development of hard tissue im-
plants. These have been inspired by more extensive research in the field of
tissue engineering, where materials have been engineered to release growth
factors and control osteoprogenitor cell populations.153–156 Table 5.1 details
selected applications of common biomaterials used in hard tissue implants,
258
Chapter 5

including metals, ceramics, polymers, or composites (e.g. mixtures of
ceramics and polymers), and their specific applications.
5.4.2
Metals
Bioinert metals are excellent materials for load-bearing orthopaedic appli-
cations. Metals suitable for this include biomedical grades of stainless steel,
for instance alloys containing chromium, nickel, molybdenum [e.g. 316L
stainless steel (SS), with the L designation indicating a lower carbon con-
tent]. Other important metals include cobalt alloys, such as cobalt–
chromium–molybdenum (CoCrMo), and Ti based alloys. SS is readily avail-
able and amenable to processing. However, compared with other materials it
can undergo stress corrosion and cracking, which can aﬀect its long-term
performance and limit its usage to applications where strength is not re-
quired for extended timeframes.159–162 Cobalt–chromium alloys, although
more diﬃcult to machine, exhibit higher strength, hardness and corrosion
resistance (see Table 5.2). Together with their superior fatigue strength, this
has resulted in the use of these alloys as total joint prostheses.163
A major problem with the use of alloys such as SS and CoCr is the release
of metal debris and ions such as nickel, chromium, and cobalt due to cor-
rosion in the body’s environment. This release can cause inflammation.164
Other drawbacks include the ‘stress shielding eﬀect’ arising from the mis-
match of Young’s modulus properties between metal and bone. Metal has a
higher stiﬀness than bone (430 GPa, whereas cortical bone is reported to
have values between 7 and 30 GPa, Table 5.2). This mismatch can lead to
insuﬃcient stress transfer to bone. In cases where implants with greater
stiﬀness are implanted into the bone, the device bears the functional load
rather than it being transferred through the bone. The decrease in loading
on the bone tissue causes bone resorption and weakening owing to cell
death around the implant165 or the formation of a fibrous membrane. This
‘stress shielding eﬀect’ will lead to implant failure due to loosening.6,165,166
Titanium and Ti alloys (e.g. Ti6Al4V) are the metals of choice for a range of
orthopaedic devices such as hip joint components, bone screws, knee joints,
spinal fusion cages, shoulder and elbow joints, and bone plates.167

The popularity of these alloys stems from desirable qualities including
excellent mechanical properties, high corrosion resistance, and their light-
weight nature. An oxide layer (TiO2) forms on the surface of the alloy, con-
tributing to its biocompatibility.67,168–170 Compared with SS and CoCrMo,
Ti6Al4V has a lower modulus of elasticity, but it still has a higher Young’s
modulus compared with human bone.170,171 There is also concern over
adverse eﬀects associated with the release of metal ions (e.g. Al and V) from
Ti alloys.
The need to develop materials with elastic moduli closer to that of native
bone tissue and to address concerns associated with metal ion toxicity has
prompted interest in Ti alloys incorporating other elements, including
Ti–niobium–tin and Ti–niobium–tantalum–zirconium systems.172,173 One of
the main drawbacks of Ti and its alloys is insuﬃcient wear resistance, and
consequently they are not used in the manufacture of femoral heads.173,174
Also, the bonding with living bone is not ideal, and integration with host
bone can be slow.169 In many cases modification of the implant or depos-
ition of coatings on the surface have been pursued to overcome these
drawbacks. Porous Ti metals, sintered metals with increased surface
roughness, are also attractive due to their ability to reduce modulus
mismatch at the bone–implant interface and enhance long-term fixation.175
5.4.3
Polymers
A range of natural and synthetic polymers are increasingly being used
medically. Poly(lactide) (PLA) and copolymers of poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
(PLGA) are of particular interest because these synthetic polymers are bio-
compatible and their resorption and mechanical properties can be tailored,
allowing them to be used, for instance, as fixation devices in maxillofacial
fractures or as screw systems. Implants can also be made from alternative
polymers such as the thermoplastic polyether ether ketone (PEEK). PEEK is
biocompatible, inert, and displays good mechanical properties but has poor
bioactivity.88 It has a low elastic modulus in the region of 4 GPa,179 over-
coming the stress-shielding eﬀects common with metals. It has been used

clinically for spinal implants and there is considerable interest in developing
PEEK composite systems. Alternatively, highly cross-linked ultra-high
molecular weight poly(ethylene) exhibits high resistance to abrasion and has
been used in joint replacement systems.5
Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has been used in medical implants and
inserts for ocular and dental applications. It is used as a bone cement in
orthopaedic and trauma applications, playing an important role in implant
fixation and repair of vertebral fractures.180,181 Bone cements do not serve
as adhesives, but rather they fill voids between prostheses and the host
bone, relying on close mechanical interlock between the irregular bone
surface and the prosthesis. They also act to achieve consistent stress
distribution.163,182 Bone cement products are generally supplied as a two-
component system including a solid-phase containing polymer powder (e.g.
PMMA), catalyst, and radio-opacifier (BaSO4, ZrO2), and a liquid containing
methyl methacrylate monomers, accelerators, and stabilisers.180,181 PMMA
sets in the body, but the polymerisation reaction is exothermic and can
cause tissue damage.183 PMMA is non-bioactive and non-degradable, and
other long-term clinical complications reported include tissue necrosis,
bone resorption, and low osteointegration.181 Other than total joint re-
placements and vertebroplasty (stabilisation of compression fractures in the
spine) indications, PMMA has been employed as a temporary cement spacer
after debridement in revision surgeries and to support regeneration of
critical defects.184,185 Bone cements have also been used to deliver anti-
biotics in periprosthetic joint infection, which will be addressed in more
detail in Section 5.5.2.1.
5.4.4
Alumina and Zirconia
Ceramics are defined as non-metallic inorganic materials, which can be
shaped and consolidated at high temperatures.186 Hench and Wilson
described bioceramics as ‘specially designed and fabricated from ceramic
origins used for repair and reconstruction of diseased, damaged or worn-out
parts of the body’.187 Bioceramics are categorised as either ‘bioinert’ or
‘bioactive’: examples of the former include alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia
(ZrO2). Although the intrinsic brittleness of these ceramics is a major limi-
tation, they have been employed clinically in joint prostheses and dental
implants.188 Alumina is a very commonly used inert bioceramic due to its
biocompatibility, chemical durability, hardness, and wear resistance. It has
been employed in bearing applications, including hip protheses (e.g. femoral
heads) and dental implants. In comparison to metals, the reduced wear rates
of the bearing components of the implants leads to lower quantities of
particles and ions being released.189
Zirconia, a non-resorbable ceramic, has also been used to produce femoral
heads for THR and dental implants. In the form tetragonal zirconia polycrystal
stabilised by 3 mol% yttria (3Y-TZP) it is employed as an alternative to alu-
mina, particularly for use as a structural ceramic. Despite these advantages,

261

3Y-TZP is prone to low temperature hydrothermal ageing whereby contact with
body fluids can lead to phase transformation in the material, the subsequent
weakening of the implant and wear debris accumulating in the articulating
joint. Eﬀorts to develop tougher and stronger, yet more stable, alternatives
have led to the development of ceramics combining alumina’s hardness and
zirconia’s toughness such as zirconia toughened alumina (ZTA) and alumina
toughened zirconia (ATZ) composites.188,190–192

Calcium Phosphates
5.4.5.1
Calcium Phosphate Compounds
Human bone consists of approximately 70% inorganic mineral, and due to
their similarity in chemical composition to the mineral component in bone
and teeth, calcium phosphates (CaP) have emerged as an important family of
bioceramics.193 These materials are bioactive and can form interfacial bonds
with living tissue. Diﬀerent types of CaP can be distinguished, on the basis
of varying Ca : P molar ratios. For instance, synthetic hydroxyapatite (HA) has
a Ca : P ratio of 1.67. Others include tricalcium phosphate (TCP), biphasic
calcium phosphate (BCP), amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), or calcium
deficient HA (CDHA). Biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) is a mixture of
HA with either a-TCP or b-TCP.145,194 The chemical composition and the
Ca : P molar ratio of these CaP compounds with several others are outlined in

Calcium phosphates have been extensively used for orthopaedic clinical
applications as bone substituting and bone tissue engineering materials,
in many diﬀerent forms (e.g. bone cements, bone fillers, implant coatings),
due mainly to their bioactivity, biocompatibility, and osteoconductive
properties.152,195–197 CaP cements are resorbable and biocompatible. They
have been used in dental and orthopaedic applications, although they are
principally used in non- or low-bearing applications such as cranial and
maxillo-facial surgeries, due to their brittle behaviour and low mechanical
strength.182,198
Despite their poor mechanical properties in the bulk form (brittle and low
tensile strength), CaP bioceramics are employed as coatings on metallic
implants.11,199–201 CaP coatings on metallic implant devices oﬀer the pos-
sibility of combining the strength of the metals and the bioactivity of the
ceramics. They have been investigated as coatings on bioinert metal surfaces
to enhance osteointegration with surrounding bone.202 For instance, porous
alumina implants were coated with a slurry of HA and the bioactive glass
45S5 Bioglasss [see Section 5.4.6 for more detailed discussion of bioactive
glasses (BG)] and implanted into defects in rabbit tibia for 14 and 28 days,
before resection and comparison with uncoated implants. Although the
uncoated implants demonstrated some contact with host bone, coated im-
plant surfaces displayed direct continuous contact with the bone after 14
and 28 days.203 However, it is important to remember that coating degrades
over time, which could compromise the long-term stability of implants. Also,
during the coating process the coating should not separate from the
implant, and procedures to cause densification of the coating (e.g. heating
during sintering) should not cause the material to crystallise.204
The biodegradation of ceramics and properties influencing this behaviour
[e.g.
thermodynamic
solubility,
solid-state
properties
(crystalline
or
amorphous), presence of impurities and additives, and structural properties
(dense or porous)] are important parameters for their success in bone repair
and regeneration. Bioactive bioceramics may be resorbable or non-
resorbable. TCP is classed as a resorbable ceramic as it degrades and is
completely resorbed in vivo205. Other CaP compounds, such as HA, have
low solubility, and thus are more stable under physiological conditions.
Several dental and orthopaedic implants have been coated with HA to
increase long-term fixation, because HA enhances bone integration with
the regenerated bone after implantation more eﬀectively than other CaPs,
including resorbable TCP.205
5.4.5.2
Hydroxyapatite
5.4.5.2.1
Properties of Hydroxyapatite.
Hydroxyapatite (HA) is a CaP
that closely resembles the main inorganic salt component in biological
hard tissue (bones and teeth).208 HA, [Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2],209 can easily be
prepared synthetically and is a commonly used material in bone appli-
cations

endogenous material.210,211 The Ca : P ratio can greatly influence the
material’s solubility in water,212 since they aﬀect the degradability of
HA and thereby the concentrations of Ca21 and PO4
3 ions released at the
implant site.89 Biological apatites diﬀer chemically from HA, in that car-
bonate is a major substitute in biological bone (5–8%)213 and they contain
trace elements such as fluorine, chlorine, magnesium, sodium, and potas-
sium.214 Consequently, biological bone is deficient in calcium ions (Ca21)
with respect to HA and has an average Ca : P molar ratio of 1.5. This low-
ers
the
crystallinity
and
increases
the
solubility
of
the
CaP
com-
pound,215,216 whereas highly crystalline stoichiometric HA exhibits lower
solubility both in vitro and in vivo.217
One of the main factors underlying the use of HA in orthopaedic appli-
cations is its versatility. It can undergo thermal treatments to increase
(or decrease) phase purity, crystallinity, and HA particle size, and change
chemical composition (dehydration and functional group alteration).218
Such treatments can confer HA with desirable chemical, structural (size,
porosity), and dissolution properties, enhancing its utility in an in vivo
setting.208,219,220 Trace elements such as strontium (Sr), magnesium (Mg),
zinc (Zn), and silicon (Si) have been used as dopants in HA to enhance
mechanical properties, tailor the crystallinity, and control degradation and
dissolution behaviour.221,222
HA decomposes into various CaP phases when processed at high tem-
peratures (41300 1C).223–226 This can lead to the formation of intermediates
such as calcium oxide (CaO), a-TCP, b-TCP, and tetra-calcium phosphate
(TTCP)223,224 (Table 5.3). Thermal degradation products including a-TCP,
b-TCP, and TTCP are resorbable and biodegrade more rapidly in an aqueous
environment than pure HA.150,205 This has important clinical consequences,
as the presence of impurities in HA can decrease its crystallinity and sub-
sequently make it more prone to dissolution.227 Rapid resorption of CaP
materials (e.g. TCP) before bone ingrowth represents a major problem, as it
can undermine the stability of the implant leading to failure.228 It is thus
important to be able to vary the resorption rate to ensure that the required
clinical outcomes are met.
Studies have demonstrated that surfaces coated with lower crystallinity
CaP materials promote faster initial bone fixation.227,229,230 However, the
results of these studies also indicated that a highly crystalline HA coating is
suitable for long-term implantation. Dekker et al. investigated Ti discs
coated with amorphous carbonated apatite or a crystalline octacalcium
phosphate (OCP) and cultured with rat bone marrow cells prior to sub-
cutaneous implantation in a nude mouse model. After 4 weeks, the bone
tissue on OCP-coated discs appeared dense and organised, in contrast
to that on substrates with an amorphous coating, which appeared loosely
organised with a woven-like appearance. The authors suggested that
osteoblasts were unable to maintain adhesion on the implant surface in the
latter case due to the resorbability of the amorphous surface.231
264
Chapter 5

In the case of HA, a more crystalline HA-coated surface (98%) demonstrated
higher stability in vivo with slower dissolution and better mechanical fixation
after 12 weeks than a less crystalline surface (56%), indicating that the former
is a better choice for long-term mechanical and biological fixation of im-
plants.147 However, HA’s low solubility is problematic, as some ions in solu-
tion are required to initiate the integration process. Hence, much interest has
focused on BCP, which contains mixtures of HA with the more resorbable
TCP. In order to tailor biodegradation, the ratio of HA to TCP can be altered to
achieve rapid fixation and long-term stability of the implant.232
5.4.5.2.2
Hydroxyapatite and the Biological Interface.
The successful
incorporation of an orthopaedic implant into the body relies on the ability
of the surface to conduct bone growth and bond to bone directly, which,
in turn, allows mechanical stability of the implant and aids in its func-
tioning by becoming an active part of the body. Bioactive materials, such
as HA and bioactive glasses, can stimulate a direct bond to form between
the implant and the surrounding bone, and thus enhance osteointegra-
tion. Gross and Berndt indicated that bioactivity is determined by the abil-
ity of a material to invoke a crystallised carbonate apatite layer from
physiological fluid.223 Hench introduced the concept that all bioactive cer-
amics form a ‘bone like apatite layer on their surfaces in the living body
and bond to bone through this apatite layer’.13,233 This is brought about
through the partial dissolution of the HA. Such dissolution increases
the calcium and phosphate concentration at the local environment, and is
followed by precipitation of CaP crystals with the incorporation of the
collagenous matrix and bone growth toward the implant.166
It has also been postulated that growth factors, such as BMPs, could be
adsorbed to CaP ceramics from body fluids, and thus play an important role
in osteogenesis by recruiting and inducing cell diﬀerentiation.234 Ducheyne
and Qui proposed a similar bonding mechanism for bioceramics, suggesting
that ion exchange and structural rearrangement at the bioceramic–tissue
interface occur, with the involvement of interdiﬀusion from the surface
boundary layer into the bioceramic.150
The dissolution of calcium apatite has been proposed to occur through five
steps, and throughout the process the surface changes in composition
forming Ca3(PO4)2 (TCP) and CaHPO4 (DCP).235,236 Bertazzo et al. put forward
a multi-step process to explain the bioactivity of HA (Figure 5.7) based on
a combination of those proposed by Hench, Ducheyne and Qui. After
implantation, dissolution of the HA layer is initiated by physiological fluids
(Step 1) and ions from the HA dissolve into solution to a certain extent
(Step 2). Eventually, equilibrium between the physiological fluid and the
surface of the HA is achieved (Step 3). Step 4 involves adsorption of proteins
and/or other biological moieties onto the surface. Steps 5 and 6 then follow,
with cell adhesion and proliferation, followed by osteogenic diﬀerentiation
and the beginning of new bone formation (Step 7). The is followed by
Inorganic Biomaterials to Support the Formation and Repair of Bone Tissue
265

subsequent bone ingrowth and remodelling (Step 8).237 Material properties,
including porosity, surface area, particle size, stoichiometry, and crystallinity,
can all aﬀect the rate of dissolution. In particular, the stability associated with
crystalline HA surfaces can influence their integration into the body.

HA Applications
5.4.5.2.3.1
Hydroxyapatite Implant Coatings.
One of the main goals,
particularly in arthroplasties, is to ensure long-term implant survival. Acrylic
cements have previously been used to achieve bone fixation. Subsequently,
cementless devices were introduced, which primarily rely on a tight press-fit
of the implant into bone. However long-term fixation requires stable bio-
logical anchorage with host bone.238 Titanium and alumina are employed for
implants, particularly in load bearing areas as they provide greater mechan-
ical support in contrast to bioactive materials, which are generally too brittle.
However, these materials are inert and require either alterations to their sur-
face roughness or combination with a bioactive material in order to ensure
eﬀective anchorage of the implant to the host bone.202
HA is commonly used as a coating on implants in order to improve
osseointegration with bone in the clinical setting. There is good clinical
experience of using CaP ceramics, in particular HA, as coatings on ortho-
paedic implants. Several orthopaedic hip protheses involving HA coatings
have been commercially marketed.238 Products include Actiss Total Hip
System, Summits DUOFIX HA cementless stem (DePuy Synthes, Johnson
and Johnson, USA); and Tridents acetabular shell with PureFix HA coating
and Anatomic Dual Mobilitys cup (Stryker Orthopaedics, USA). Clinical re-
search has demonstrated the continued fixation of HA coated orthopaedic
implants, illustrating the beneficial properties of HA as a successful osteo-
conductive coating.238,239 One study reported excellent results in relation to
fixation of femoral components in hip arthroplasty using the partially coated
HA Omnifits stem, with 99.2% survival rate at 17-year follow-up.240

Despite
these
promising
findings,
some
concerns
exist
over
HA
resorption, instability at the coating–substrate interface, and delamination
from implants, which can give rise to loosening.201,241,242 A study comparing
porous or HA coated sleeves of a modular cementless femoral stem (Ti6Al4V)
in primary THA found there was no long-term advantage of using a HA
coating on the sleeve of the stem.243 Herrera et al. concluded, based on
their surgical experience, that HA-coated hip implants represented a reliable
option, especially in younger people, and oﬀer the prospect of long-term
implant survival.238 However, this was contingent on the selection of good
designs, suitable bearing surfaces based on the patient’s life expectancy, and
rigorous surgical technique.
Developments in coating technique and control of coating layer thickness
are constantly emerging from the literature.203 For instance, stainless steel and
Ti wires were coated with HA and implanted in canine tibia bone marrow
canals.244 This study demonstrated the possible application of these coated
thin wires for diaphyseal fracture, bone lengthening and deformity correction
in combination with an Ilazarov external fixator. The HA coated wires en-
hanced osteogenesis, which led to increased osseointegration of both metal
materials in comparison with uncoated metal implants and faster fracture
healing. Other recent research has investigated the use of composites to en-
hance interfacial bond strength and coating integrity. However, the formation
of a composite may also alter the bioactivity of the coating.89,201 Recent studies
have examined the formulation of a HA–graphene oxide composite coating.
It was revealed that MG63 (human osteoblastic) and L929 (murine fibroblast)
cells had enhanced proliferation and cell viability on the graphene oxide–HA
composite coating in comparison to pure HA or Ti alone, in addition to
superior adhesion strength and resistance to corrosion.245
5.4.5.2.3.2
Scaﬀolds Containing Hydroxyapatite.
Regenerative bone appli-
cations often require a scaﬀold to provide stability and guidance for 3D bone
growth.246 There has been debate regarding the ideal pore size in HA
scaﬀolds. However, there is consensus that optimisation of the pore size is
essential to maintain mechanical strength. Pores in the macro-scale
(100–500 mm) are important for cell and extracellular fluid infiltration and
subsequent bone ingrowth and vascularisation.247,248 One pilot clinical study
examined macroporous HA scaﬀolds seeded with autologous mesenchymal
stem cells (MSCs) in large bone diaphysis defects in four patients. Complete
fusion between the implant and the host bone occurred five to seven months
after surgery. At the time of follow-up (six to seven years post-surgery) a good
integration of the implant with the host tissue was maintained in three
patients. This study demonstrated eﬀective long-term durability of bone
regeneration using macroporous HA scaﬀolds. However, the lack of an
acellular scaﬀold control represented a limitation of this study.249
Ceramics, including HA, are limited in terms of their application alone in
scaﬀolds, due to their brittle nature209 and generally low mechanical
strength.89 To overcome these problems, much research has focused on
Inorganic Biomaterials to Support the Formation and Repair of Bone Tissue
267

composites composed of biodegradable polymers reinforced with ceramic
particles. The aim is to replicate the natural micro-environment and
encourage the development of tissue with good mechanical properties.250
The composite matrix functions to guide tissue regeneration and ideally
degrades as regeneration proceeds.56,251 Scaﬀolds can be either porous or
dense, and are often composed of HA, ACP, and BCP as the ceramic
component in a natural or synthetic polymer matrix. Natural polymers (e.g.
chitosan, alginate, and hyaluronate) and synthetic polymers (e.g. PLGA, PLA,
or polycaprolactone), have been used. However, synthetic materials are
generally easier to prepare in a reproducible manner.252 Stem cells,
growth factors, and peptide sequences have all been incorporated into the
composites to augment tissue regeneration.196,253
The composite fabrication route can have important implications for the
structural, mechanical and biological properties of the resultant substrate.
One study investigating collagen–HA scaﬀold composites compared the
addition of micron-sized or nano-sized HA particles both before and after
the freeze-drying of collagen.254 Addition of HA prior to freeze-drying
produced scaﬀolds with increased stiﬀness of 2.2- and 6.2-fold for the
micron-HA and nano-HA scaﬀolds respectively, compared with collagen–
glycosaminoglycan controls.
Coating of the
scaﬀolds
with
HA
after
freeze-drying enabled greater control over the scaﬀold’s microstructure
and increased the compressive modulus 26-fold compared with controls,
which was proposed to be mediated by both chemical [1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl
aminopropyl) carbodiimide] and physical cross-linking (dehydrothermal
treatment at 105 1C for 24 h). The porosity (approximately 98%) of the
scaﬀolds was retained even after coating, and despite lower cell attachment
the samples promoted greater cell-mediated production of Ca compared
with controls after 28 days in culture.254
Chitosan has also been combined with HA to enhance scaﬀold properties.
Inclusion of nano-HA led to improved mechanical properties and a more
homogenous dispersion throughout the polymer when compared with
micron sized HA.255 Chitosan provided the structural network of the scaﬀold
and the necessary elasticity for applications in individual defects. Further
functionalisation of chitosan by acetylation also increased the mechanical
strength, due to hydrogen bond formation across the polymer scaﬀold.255

Bioactive Glasses

Introduction to Bioactive Glasses
Bioactive glasses (BG) are resorbable bioceramics, first developed by Hench.
They diﬀer from conventional soda-lime silica glass in their composition,
and have a lower silica content.256,257 They have attracted immense interest
in bone regeneration due to their osteoconduction and osteostimulation
properties, in addition to excellent biocompatibility with the host tissue.
They are able to form strong and stable chemical bonds with bone, and give

ceramics.195,204,258–260 BG formulations have been reported to induce bone
growth three times faster than HA.13
Several types of BG (e.g. silica, borate, and phosphate) are available. However,
typical BG formulations employed in the regeneration of hard tissue are de-
gradable silicate-based materials, and consist of sodium oxide (Na2O), calcium
oxide (CaO), phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), and silicon oxide (SiO2).261 The
most commonly used BG both in research and in the clinical setting is Hench’s
Bioglasss 45S5, which consists of (by weight) 45% SiO2, 24.5% Na2O, 24.5%
CaO, and 6% P2O5.262 This was the first artificial material identified to form a
chemical bond with bone.204 The 45S5 name signifies glass containing 45% by
weight of SiO2 and a 5 : 1 molar ratio of CaO to P2O5. This is intrinsically im-
portant to its bone bonding capability, with lower Ca : P ratios not producing
bone bonding.263 Subsequent chemical modifications to tailor BG with more
desirable properties have included the addition of potassium oxide (K2O),
magnesium oxide (MgO), and boric oxide (B2O3).264,265 However, modifications
can give rise to changes in dissolution, rate of hydroxycarbonate apatite (HCA)
formation, and resorption behaviour. The composition of the silicate BG 13–93
[53% SiO2, 20% CaO, 6% Na2O, 4% P2O5, 12% K2O, 5% MgO (all percentages by
weight)] is inspired by 45S5 but contains more SiO2 as well as the network
modifiers K2O and MgO. The glass can be sintered without crystallising to
produce high density porous scaﬀolds, but has slower degradation properties
compared with 45S5.266,267
BG containing alkali oxides are reported to have limitations in terms of
poor sintering and coating properties, in addition to cytotoxic eﬀects.268 The
presence of considerable quantities of alkali oxides (Na2O, K2O) in glasses
such as 13–93 is considered to compromise performance in vitro and in vivo
owing to the generation of a high pH environment as the BG dissolves and
the release of high quantities of sodium, which have been reported to cause
cytotoxic eﬀects in vitro.268 To this end, alkali-free BG compositions based on
biocompatible and bioactive materials (such as diopside, fluorapatite, wol-
lastonite, and tricalcium phosphate) have been investigated in order to
overcome the drawbacks outlined above.257
Bioactive glasses have poor mechanical properties, which limits their use
to non-loading applications, such as bone fillers and coatings to enhance
bone ingrowth. BG have been applied clinically where extensive support
from the biomaterial is not required.8,269,270 Commercial Bioglasss 45S5
products include NovaBones (NovaBone, Florida, USA) used as a bone filler
and PerioGlass (NovaBone, Florida, USA) marketed in granular form and
widely used clinically as a filler in dental applications due to its ease of
installation, interconnected porous network and its eﬃcacy in stimulating
cell proliferation252 (Table 5.4). Silica-based BG with diﬀerent compositions
have also been marketed. A study compared the eﬀects of two diﬀerent
micron-sized BG, Bioglasss 45S5 and BG 13–93, using MSCs. BG 13–93
demonstrated significantly increased proliferation of MSCs in comparison to
45S5 Bioglasss, which was attributed to the diﬀerent ionic compositions.271

S53P4 is an alternative BG, available commercially as Bonalives (Bonalive
Biomaterials Ltd, Finland). It has a higher silica content and lower
percentages by weight of Na, Ca, and P (53% SiO2, 23% Na2O, 20% CaO,
4% P2O5) than 45S5. It is available as putty and granule products for use
in trauma and spine surgery procedures. The granular product is indicated
for filling bone cavities in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. Inhibition
of bacterial growth is noted with S53P4, and is attributed to an increase
in environmental pH arising from the release of Na1 ions and a rise
in osmotic pressure associated with an increased salt concentration due to
the release of Na, Ca, Si, and P ions.272
While much of the focus of bioactive glass research has been dedicated
to the replacement, and repair of hard tissues, such as bone and teeth,
the presence of ionic dissolution products at BG interfaces has also been
explored in soft-tissue repair mechanisms.273 Studies have shown positive
eﬀects in wound healing due to BG’s anti-inflammatory properties.274,275
The bioactive properties of BG such as 45S5 Bioglasss stem from their
ability to form a HCA layer, which is reminiscent of bone-like mineral, on
their surfaces.278 This layer is a good substrate for new bone formation, and
chemical bonding between the BG and bone gives rise to a stable bonded
interface in vivo.279 Key processes underlying the formation of this bio-
logically active layer include dissolution, ion-exchange, and precipitation.
Dissolution of the glass on contact with physiological fluids and their
penetration into the network leads to the release of silicon, calcium, phos-
phate, and sodium ions and the formation of a silica gel layer on the surface
of the BG. The released ions combine with endogenous ions already present
in vivo, precipitating to form an amorphous CaP layer that subsequently

crystallises to form the HCA layer and bind with collagen.280,281 These
dissolution products are also implicated in stimulating bone regeneration
through their influence on cellular gene expression and the bioactive
induction of ECM components. The results of in vitro studies have demon-
strated that BG stimulates osteogenesis by inducing osteoblast proliferation,
diﬀerentiation and mineralisation.281–285 Cells develop into mature osteo-
cytes286 and osteoid bridges form between particles, followed by mineral-
isation to produce mature bone structures.263
5.4.6.2
Bioactive Glass Optimisation
The properties of BG, including bioactivity and the rate of bone bonding, can
vary depending on composition, topography, size, and porosity.263,276,286
Chemical modification can be used to control resorption rate; however, pro-
cesses that increase crystallinity can reduce the level of bioactivity.287 BG are
typically produced using three diﬀerent types of inorganic oxides including
network-forming oxides, network-modifying oxides, and intermediate oxides.
The ratio of network formers to network modifiers can profoundly aﬀect glass
structure and properties. SiO2, B2O3, and P2O5 are the primary network-formers
for BG.276 While glasses containing SiO2 as the network-former are the most
commonly investigated, they exhibit low solubility. This prompted the devel-
opment of other BG including boron- and phosphate-containing glasses to
overcome this drawback.263,288 Partial replacement of the silicate gives rise
to borosilicate BG, while borate BG are created when silicate is substituted in
full by B2O3.289 Boron-based BG have been used in bone and wound healing
applications.290,291
Eﬀorts to enhance bioactivity have focused on substituting the BG network
with trace elements, which play key roles in metabolism, angiogenesis,
growth, and mineralisation of bone tissue.292 Biological responses to ionic
dissolution products in the context of bone are summarised in Figure 5.8
and have been reviewed elsewhere.151
Studies have evaluated substitution with diﬀerent ions including cobalt
(Co), strontium (Sr), Zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg).151,266,293,294 Strontium-
substituted glasses have been investigated to exploit the regenerative qual-
ities of BG, together with the anabolic and anticatabolic eﬀects of Sr21.
Research involving a series of BG (SiO2–P2O5–Na2O–CaO, in which 0–100%
of the Ca was substituted by Sr) demonstrated that ion release from the BGs
increased metabolic activity of Saos-2 human osteosarcoma cells and
inhibited osteoclast activity. After 14 days of culture with media containing
dissolved BG ions cell activity was increased with all BG compositions, but
metabolic activity was significantly greater in cultures treated with ions from
Sr substituted BG. Direct-culture experiments demonstrated increased pro-
liferation and ALP activity with increasing Sr substitution. After seven days of
culture, the number of cells on discs composed of 100% Sr-substituted BG
was higher compared with those on unsubstituted materials, while after
14 days there were significantly more cells on discs composed of 50% and

100% Sr-substituted samples compared with either unsubstituted discs or
those containing Sr substituted at 10%.293
Cobalt-substituted BG have been investigated to exploit the angiogenic
potential of Co21.294–296 One study fabricated 3D porous scaﬀolds using a
foam replica technique, working with a silicate BG 13–93 in which CoO was
substituted for CaO at 1 and 5% by weight. Results of studies in simulated
body fluid (SBF) indicated that all scaﬀolds formed a CaP layer, with traces
of Co present in the CoO-substituted samples.294 Another study incorpor-
ated both Sr and Co in the glass structure to promote regeneration by en-
hancing the osteogenic and angiogenic potential. The substituted BG
granules were seeded with human umbilical cord perivascular cells prior to
implantation into a critical defect in the distal femur of a rabbit model. Dual
substitution with Co and Sr produced the most promising in vitro and in vivo
results.296
Bioactive glass powders can be formed by either melt quenching or sol–gel
processes. Commercial BG including Bioglasss 45S5 are produced using
melt-quenching, which requires processing temperatures in the region of
1500 1C to enable the oxide precursors to melt together, followed by
quenching in a graphite mould or water. Typically glasses produced using
this route are only bioactive within controlled compositional ranges. For
instance, increasing the SiO2 content to 460 mol% leads to loss of the
bioactive properties.

Sol–gel processing is considered attractive because it requires lower pro-
cessing temperatures, and bioactive materials can be obtained using a wider
compositional range. Sol–gel synthesis also oﬀers flexibility to tailor the
morphology of the products (e.g. nanoporous powders, monoliths, and
nanoparticles).204,297–299 It is a chemical process involving assembly of pre-
cursors at room temperature to form a covalently bonded silica gel network,
which is then dried and heated (600 1C) to form the glass. Sol–gel derived BG
tend to have fewer components than those from melt quenching. Examples
include the ternary systems 58S (60 mol% SiO2, 36 mol% CaO, 4 mol% P2O5)
and 77S (80 mol% SiO2, 16 mol% CaO, 4 mol% P2O5) and binary system
70S30C (70 mol% SiO2, 30 mol% CaO).
The manufacturing route is known to aﬀect the physical proeprties of the
glasses, including texture and especially the specific surface area and porosity.
Comparision of 45S5 Bioglasss powders produced using both melt-derived
and sol–gel processes showed that the melt-derived powders exhibited low
textural porosity and surfaces areas (0.15–2.7 m2 g1) compared with sol–gel
systems. Sol–gel products exhibited a high degree of mesoporous textural
features, particularly in the 6–9 nm size range, and higher surface areas
(126.5–164.7 m2 g1) in comparison with melt-dreived (0.15–2.7 m2 g1)
samples.300 The high specific surface areas arise due to the characterisitc
nanoporosity of sol–gel synthesised materials.204 The results of in vitro dis-
solution studies indicated that sol–gel derived powders had both higher dis-
solution rates and greater CaP layer formation on the surface.301
Alterations to the surface characteristics and morphology of BG are
being constantly investigated in order to amplify their desirable qual-
ities.252 Mesoporous bioactive glasses (mBGs) have been explored as they
exhibit enhanced bioactivity due to their controlled porous network and
increased surface area. However, this may lead to faster degradation
in vivo,302 and so specific consideration depending on the proposed use is
required. Other research has examined changing the morphology of BG
particles from spherical to nanorods. mBG nanorods of varying diameter
were created by tailoring processing temperatures.303 mBG scaﬀolds were
obtained by impregnating a polyurethane sponge template with a slurry
mixture of mBG sol and mBG nanorods. The scaﬀold containing nanorod
structures exhibited a mechanical strength 16-fold greater than the
analogue with conventional mBG. The incorporation of nanorods into the
scaﬀold reflected the hierarchical nano/micro/macro porous structure of
bone, and was thought to enhance the formation of the surface apatite
layer.304
With increasing interest focusing on designing scaﬀolds with hierarchical
features, additive manufacturing has been proposed to improve the
processing of mBG materials, enabling preservation of textural porosity
and production of stronger scaﬀolds.305 mBG materials oﬀer the potential
to enhance bioactivity and act as delivery platforms for various small
molecules, growth factors, and pharmaceutical agents. Their role in this has
been reviewed elsewhere.306,307

5.4.6.3
Bioactive Glass Scaﬀolds
Current research is directed towards the development of bioactive 3D scaf-
folds that oﬀer strength in the short-term and provide a stimulus to the
body’s own repair mechanisms, but then resorb over time and are eventually
replaced with load-bearing bone. Such approaches provide stability at the
implant site and bypass problems with stress-shielding and those arising
from changes that occur at the biological–device interface.281 Researchers
are investigating the production of interconnected macroporous BG scaf-
folds in order to optimise pore morphology and ensure extensive osteo-
genesis across the scaﬀold.252 The commercial products Bioglasss 45S5 and
Bonalive S53P4 are available as granule and putty forms, and although they
can be processed into porous scaﬀold forms this necessitates a sintering
step to fuse the particles together. The high processing temperature utilised
in sintering results in crystallisation and the formation of a glass–ceramic,
thereby reducing bioactivity.308–310 Crystallisation arises because some BGs,
including 45S5, exhibit a narrow ‘sintering window’ [this describes the
temperature diﬀerential between the glass transition temperature (Tg) and
onset temperature for crystallisation (Tc onset)]. Approaches to overcome this
have included alternative processing techniques (e.g. sol–gel foaming) or
altering BG composition by introducing network modifiers (K2O, MgO), to
widen the sintering window and prevent crystallisation.265,309,311,312
Melt-derived porous BG scaﬀolds have been produced by surrounding a
template structure with glass particles. The template is subsequently
removed by dissolution after foaming and prior to sintering, or indeed may
be removed during the sintering step. Both porogen microbeads (PMMA)
and sacrificial foams (e.g. polyurethane) have been used as templates.204 One
of the challenges of melt-derived manufacturing includes obtaining suitable
pore interconnectivity across the structure.266 Some of the earlier bioactive
macroporous BG scaﬀolds were produced by sol–gel foaming methods em-
ploying surfactants to generate the porous structure.313 This technique can
give rise to scaﬀolds with a hierarchical pore structure similar to trabecular
bone,269 with pores larger than 100 mm due to the foaming process and a
nanopore framework intrinsic to the sol–gel glass.314 The increased porosity
means that these scaﬀolds have comparatively higher surface areas and can
degrade faster than melt-derived structures with equivalent compositions.266
However, manipulation of pore size and interconnectivity is dependent on
formulation and processing variables, including the surfactant concen-
tration and agitation speed.311,313 The technique has also resulted in the
production of BG scaﬀolds with low mechanical strength, which are un-
suitable for high weight-bearing sites subject to cyclic loading.266
One group utilised foaming and in situ polymerisation prior to sintering to
fabricate a porous scaﬀold composed of BG doped with Sr (Sr–BG).315 Stron-
tium served a crucial purpose in broadening the sintering window, which al-
lowed the production of a porous yet amorphous (XRD pattern, Figure 5.9A) BG
scaﬀold. X-ray microtomography analysis, supported by mercury porosimetry,
274
Chapter 5

and electron microscopy, indicated that the pore structure was homogeneous
and interconnected (modal interconnect size 4100 mm) (Figure 5.9B–E).
Together with a modal pore size 4400 mm (Figure 5.9B), this means the
material should be able to support cell infiltration and subsequent bone for-
mation and vascularisation. The Sr–BG scaﬀold performed better than 45S5
Bioglasss in a critical-sized defect in an ovine model. The Sr-BG released ions
in vivo, with evidence of Sr incorporation into newly formed bone. Multi-scale
characterisation revealed diﬀerences in the quality of bone formation at the
macro and micro scales between samples. The Sr–BG scaﬀold demonstrated
formation of organised lamellar bone, which resembled normal, healthy bone.
Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis indicated
evidence of tissue repair at the interface between bone and 45S5 Bioglasss,
although both lamellar and woven bone were present.
Advancements in additive manufacturing are being exploited to recapitulate
the complex hierarchical design and anisotropic structure inherent in natural
materials, in a bid to design scaﬀolds with mechanical strength similar to that

of native bone. A range of fabrication techniques, including selective-laser
sintering, freeze–extrusion fabrication, and robocasting, have enabled the
production of interconnected porous structures with controlled pore mor-
phology and mechanical features resembling those of cortical bone.316,317
Direct ink writing techniques have been used to produce scaﬀolds with a
range of diﬀerent properties, including those with gradient porosity or struc-
tures reminiscent of the cortical–trabecular pattern of bone (consisting of a
dense outer pattern and a more porous inner layer), as illustrated in
Figure 5.10.318 One group utilised a direct ink writing technique to fabricate
porous scaﬀolds consisting of 6P53B BG with features equivalent to native
bone. Hydrogel inks consisting of glass particles suspended in a Pluronic F-127
solution were cooled to increase viscosity prior to printing, followed by sub-
sequent sintering of the filaments. The resultant scaﬀolds demonstrated
compressive strength (136 MPa) analogous to cortical bone and a porosity
(60%) similar to trabecular bone. The strength of this porous glass scaﬀold was
superior to those of the polymer (approximately 100 times), ceramic and glass
(fourfold to fivefold) scaﬀolds. Although the strength decreased (77 MPa) fol-
lowing immersion in SBF, it still exceeded the strength of trabecular bone after
three weeks.318,319

Researchers have also used direct ink writing techniques to prepare 3D
scaﬀold constructs composed of BG 13–93 or borosilicate 2B6Sr (18 mol%
SiO2, 36 mol% B2O3, 6 mol% Na2O, 8 mol% K2O, 2 mol% MgO, 6 mol% SrO,
22 mol% CaO, 2 mol% P2O5).320 Scaﬀolds were produced using a layer by
layer approach, with subsequent drying and sintering of the extruded glass
filaments. The product demonstrated regular repeating patterns, controlled
microstructures and interconnected pores. Comparison of the materials in a
rabbit model employing a critical segmental femoral defect over a nine
month period revealed increasing bone formation over time, with complete
bone–implant integration and bone healing in defects containing BG
scaﬀolds or the positive (autograft) control. Degradation of the BG scaﬀolds
was evident at both three- and nine-months post-implantation, with 2B6Sr
BG exhibiting a slightly faster degradation than the 13–93 glass group. The
scaﬀold composed of 2B6Sr glass demonstrated a better capacity to support
new bone formation at an early stage, which was attributed to its faster
degradation rate and release of soluble ions with known osteogenic
qualities. However, hardness testing of the regenerated bones at the final
time-point indicated there were no significant diﬀerence between bones
treated with 13–93, 2B6Sr and autograft interventions.320
Composite scaﬀolds composed of natural and synthetic polymers together
with ceramics can be generated to increase stiﬀness and compressive
strength, thereby broadening the scope of BG applications.56 One study
examined the coating of BG 13–93 scaﬀolds with a layer of PLA polymer on
the external surface.321 Three 13–93 BG scaﬀolds with varying geometry were
formed by robotic deposition, and the upper and lower surface of the scaf-
folds were coated in a PLA layer of varying thickness (200, 400, and 800 nm).
Composite scaﬀolds with PLA layers of 400 and 800 nm demonstrated
significant increases in load bearing capacity, as PLA was observed to fill
surface cracks in the BG scaﬀold and proposed to limit growth or initiation
of flaws when the material was placed under stress. In addition, the com-
posite scaﬀolds demonstrated a flexural mechanical response in four-point
bending, as opposed to the characteristic brittle response of BG. The former
is much more favourable in load bearing applications. This study did not
examine eﬀects of these scaﬀolds on the proliferation of cells; however, by
limiting the presence of the PLA coating on the external surfaces, it was
expected that the bioactive capacity of 13–93 BG would be maintained.
Hybrid scaﬀolds, containing interpenetrating networks of organic and
inorganic constituents that behave as a single phase and are indis-
tinguishable above the nanoscale, have been proposed as means to achieve
controlled degradation, enhance mechanical properties, and overcome
problems in composite materials where the inorganic component becomes
masked when combined with the polymer.204,322 These materials involve
covalent bonding of the inorganic and organic phases during processing,
and are prepared by a modification of the sol–gel process (although the
chemistries involved are more complex).323,324 Examples have included
silica–poly(e-caprolactone) and bioactive star gel hybrids.324,325

5.5
Infection Control Strategies
5.5.1
Introduction
There is an imperative need to find preventative and therapeutic strategies to
combat IAI, and these should be considered in the light of the considerable
challenges relating to accurate diagnosis of the causative pathogen in
clinical settings, the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and the existence of
recalcitrant and recurrent infections.16 Three main approaches have been
pursued in biomedical applications including biocide releasing, microbe-
repelling, and contact-active anti-colonising surfaces or coatings. The former
approach is well established and has received much research attention
compared with the other strategies. However, microbe-repelling and contact-
active coatings are relatively new approaches that oﬀer potential to prevent
infection in the orthopaedic setting. Other strategies at earlier stages of
development include approaches to disrupt biofilms, for instance, quorum
sensing inhibitors, and degrading enzymes.117
Surfaces can be categorised as passive or active, depending on whether
anti-bacterial agents are delivered locally. Passive coatings impede bacterial
adhesion and/or kill bacteria upon contact. In contrast, active surfaces
release bactericidal agents (antibiotics, antiseptics, metal ions, growth
factors, chemokines, peptides) that have been deposited on the implant
surface directly or entrapped within a carrier (coating matrix or architectural
feature, e.g. nanotubes) in order to combat infection (Figure 5.11).326
BG have also demonstrated antimicrobial properties as a result of their
dissolution elevating the pH at the implant site.327
Irrespective of the infection control strategy, the materials employed to
tailor the device surface (e.g. inhibition of bacterial adhesion, interference
with biofilm formation, or presentation of antimicrobial agents) should be
biocompatible and not illicit an immune response. The device itself should
possess suitable mechanical properties to enable infection control both in
the acute and latent phase, and promote integration with the host tissue
where desirable.104
5.5.2
Antimicrobial Release
The release of antimicrobial agents (namely antibiotics, antiseptics, or metal
ions) directly from the implant or from a matrix impregnated coating can be
used to kill microbes at the local site. Important considerations in the design
of such systems include the need to control release kinetics to achieve
therapeutic concentrations over the desired timeframe. Biocide release can
be tailored to have burst and extended-release components in order to
combat infection in the perioperative and post-surgical phase. However,
there is a danger that long-term presentation of sub-optimal drug concen-
trations not only means lack of eﬃcacy but also poses the risk of anti-
microbial resistance.138,328 Release proceeds through diﬀusion from the

implant or coating surface or coincides with erosion of the coating mat-
rix.329,330 Any added antimicrobial agent should have a broad spectrum of
activity against the primary organisms causing infection.
5.5.2.1
Antibiotic Loaded Bone Cements
The development of antibiotic loaded bone cements (ALBC) represented a
significant advancement, and they have been extensively studied since their
discovery in the 1960s. They consist of bone cements (BC), such as PMMA,
blended with antibiotic drugs. Tobramycin and gentamicin are commonly
used, and commercially available products include Simplexs P and
Simplexs HV (Stryker, UK) which contain tobramycin and gentamicin, and
Palacoss bone cement with gentamicin (Heraeus Medical GMBH, Germany).
Additionally, cements have been vacuum-mixed with other antibiotics
such as ampicillin, erythromycin, colistin, cefazolin, gentamicin, vanco-
mycin, and tobramycin by surgeons and then moulded like a putty with the
implant.144
The antibiotic dosage in ALBC for treatment of musculoskeletal infection
can be as high as 6–8 g per 40 g of BC.331 ALBC oﬀer the prospect of
achieving high drug concentrations locally in the aﬀected site, with minimal
or no systemic toxicity.332 The release of antibiotics generally follows a
biphasic mechanism. Initial release, during the first hours after exposure of
antibiotic loaded cement to a fluid, is mainly a surface phenomenon, and is
followed by prolonged release over several days in a bulk diﬀusion pro-
cess.132 The second phase relies on the availability of pores and connecting
capillaries in the cements, through which fluids can penetrate and dissolve
the antibiotics. Factors that aﬀect release include antibiotic type, BC type,
and mixing conditions.
The main advantage of ALBC usage is that it works in the treatment of deep
infections with much clinical data to support its success.137 The disadvantages
include (i) the presence of unreacted monomer that may cause cytotoxic ef-
fects, leading to chemical necrosis of the bone; (ii) some are non-degradable
(e.g. PMMA); (iii) 80% of the antibiotic loading has been reported to be ef-
fectively locked in the BC for many years, resulting in sub-inhibitory exposure
and induction of microbial resistance; and (iv) the mechanical strength of the
BC can be compromised due to the addition of the drug and the subsequent
drug release.133,333 Some of these problems can be overcome with resorbable
BC, such as those composed of CaP and brushite (Table 5.3), which can lead to
faster and more complete drug release.137,196
5.5.2.2
Antimicrobial Implant Coatings
The use of bioactive materials such as CaO, HA, and TCP as drug eluting
orthopaedic coatings oﬀers a simple cementless solution for the treatment
of IAI. Extensive research has been carried out to develop a simple means
of impregnating the drug into the HA pores330 or into the HA matrix.329,334

and

loaded
using
a
soaking
method.330 Antibacterial assessments, of samples prepared with short
loading times of 15 mins, demonstrated inhibition of S. aureus after 24 h.335
The main drawback associated with preparation via a soakage method is the
resultant short antibiotic elution time (1–3 days). Other researchers have
developed a simple ‘fast-loading slow-release’ mechanism of incorporating
antibiotics through loading HA coated Ti surfaces with antibiotic solutions,
where the antibiotics (tobramycin, cephalothin, amoxicillin) chemically bind
to the CaP.335,336
In order to extend the period of therapeutic drug release, the addition of
diﬀerent biodegradable polymers has been employed. Biopolymers are also
attractive as they are completely bioresorbable, which eliminates the need
for any subsequent surgical removal. These drug delivery systems allow for
increased antibiotic loading and more controllable release kinetics, and the
latter can be modified by the polymer’s degradation profile. Biodegradable
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved polyesters, such as PLA and
poly(glycolic acid) and their co-polymers, have been manufactured into
diﬀerent forms (microspheres, films, beads), loaded with antibacterial active
ingredients, and successfully used on orthopaedic devices.196
Combination coatings demonstrating low initial burst release and a linear
drug release for up to 24 weeks have been developed,144 with clinical data re-
vealing the prevention of infections on intra-medullary implants up to 6 weeks
after implantation.328,337 This technology has translated to clinical use in the
European Union in the form of the Experts Tibial Nail with PROtects Coating
(DePuy Synthes, Johnson and Johnson). The combination device consists of a
Ti alloy (Ti–6Al–7Nb) nail coated with a thin layer of PLA polymer that contains
the drug gentamicin sulfate. The total drug content contained in the coating
varies, and is dependent upon the type of implant, its size and surface
area.338,339 The coating is intended to protect patients from bacterial colon-
isation of the implant, rather than for treatment of local existing infections. It is
indicated in cases where there is an increased risk of local bone infections (e.g.
polytraumatised or immunosuppressed patients), in patients with open frac-
tures, and in complicated scenarios (e.g. non-unions where the bone has not
healed and a revision procedure is required).340
It should be noted that concerns have been raised regarding the acidic by-
products of PLGA degradation, which may denature proteins,341 but PLGA
based microspheres have been shown to release intact and biologically active
BMP-2.342 Other novel approaches have used polymerisation techniques to
produce drug loaded PLGA or HA microspheres343 and polymer–drug
microspheres with a HA shell.344
Alternative approaches to polymer coatings have been pursued using in-
organic biomaterials such as titania (TiO2) nanotube arrays to control the
presentation of antimicrobial cargoes. Anodisation has been used to generate
nanotextured and nanotubular features on Ti. The surface features can be
tuned by controlling the length of the processing time. At shorter anodisation

times TiO2 pits form, whereas with increasing anodisation times these
lengthen to form nanotubes on the surface.345 Due to their biocompatibility,
TiO2 nanotube arrays have been used as reservoirs to control the delivery of
drugs and metal ions346,347 including silver (Ag1)348 and Zn21.349 Inclusion
of Ag2O in the wall of amorphous TiO2 nanotubes resulted in shorter tube
lengths, but could eﬀectively control the release of Ag1 ions. The constructs did
not adversely aﬀect osteoblast cell viability or diﬀerentiation.350
5.5.2.3
Doped Ceramics and Bioactive Glasses
Preparing substituted or doped ceramics and BG allows them to deliver an
antimicrobial functionality in addition to their bioactive properties, making
them an attractive proposition. Substituted apatites are CaP materials where
the Ca ion has been partially replaced by other cations. Investigations into
incorporating ions such as Ag1, Zn21, and copper (Cu21) into HA351–353 and
BG354 have demonstrated positive antimicrobial eﬀects. Sr21 ions have also
been reported to have an antimicrobial eﬀect in vitro,355 and the results of
studies evaluating an injectable bone cement containing Sr-doped BG
demonstrated that bactericidal action increased through Sr substitution into
the BG. Together with the potential for Sr to stimulate osteoblasts and
inhibit osteoclasts, proposed applications of the product include treatment
of osteoporosis-related compression fractures in the spinal vertebra and
prevention of IAI.356
Of the antimicrobial ions investigated, Ag1 has been the most extensively
studied. Silver has strong inhibitory and bactericidal eﬀects as well as a broad
spectrum of activity against a wide range of pathogens.357 However, concerns
relating to toxicological issues associated with systemic or local accumulation
of metals have been raised.358 Several proposed mechanisms have been re-
ported to explain the antimicrobial mode of action of the metal ions. These
include disruption of the electron transport chain, inhibition of deoxyribo-
nucleic acid (DNA) replication, DNA cleavage, membrane disruptions,
formation of reactive oxygen species and enzyme inhibition.351,357,359,360
Ag1-containing HA coatings have been reported to exhibit good anti-
bacterial and osteogenic properties with low toxicity in vitro.361 One study
examined the eﬀects of increasing the percentage of Ag (1, 3, and 6.6% Ag by
weight) in HA coatings. In vitro cell culture studies evaluating MC3T3-E1
murine osteoblast adhesion and proliferation demonstrated that coatings
containing the lowest Ag content (1% by weight) promoted the greatest de-
gree of osteoblast adhesion, which was attributed to the higher surface
roughness as the coating dissolved and the inclusion of Ag at a concen-
tration that did not cause toxicity. However, increasing the Ag concentration
to 3% by weight adversely aﬀected cell proliferation and attachment.
Consequently, the authors concluded that the Ag content should be limited
to between 1 and 3% by weight in vitro.362
Another study evaluated the osteoconductivity of HA coatings containing
silver oxide (Ag2O), deposited on Ti implants using a thermal spray process,
282
Chapter 5

in vivo in a rat tibia model. The study confirmed that there was good bone
formation and contact for samples containing Ag at 3% by weight, which was
similar to the HA coating. However, inhibition of bone formation was observed
at much higher Ag loadings of 50% by weight.363 Elemental analysis of the 3%
by weight coated samples indicated that the majority of Ag2O was lost during
the spray deposition process, as the residual Ag2O content was only 0.21% by
weight. Despite this reduction in Ag content, antibacterial studies using MRSA
(UOEH6) in the medullary cavity of rat tibiae demonstrated that the presence of
Ag reduced bone infection compared with HA samples.364
Ag loaded CaP coatings have also demonstrated antibacterial activity
against MRSA in vitro.365 Ag–HA coatings were toxic towards hFOB 1.19
osteoblasts (poor cellular morphology, cell death, loss of functional ALP
activity), but HA coatings containing both Ag and Sr revealed that the Sr
could oﬀset the cytotoxic eﬀects of Ag. Addition of SrO did not aﬀect the
release of Ag1.366
5.5.3
Strategies to Limit Bacterial Adhesion
Preventative approaches that inhibit bacterial attachment and biofilm for-
mation are an attractive means of addressing the problem of IAI. Microbe
repelling coatings are still under development and find applications in many
medical areas, but to date are not commonly employed in the orthopaedic
setting. Tailoring coating properties, such as nano-topography, surface
charge, and hydrophobicity, can be achieved by altering the surface chem-
istry in order to reduce bacterial attachment, thus preventing microbial
colonisation.97,367 The infection risk associated with each biomaterial varies
and is determined by the interplay between adhesion and surface growth of
the infecting organism. One commonly investigated approach is to tailor the
device by coating the surface with inert polymer brushes. The most widely
researched is the hydrophilic polymer PEG, which can be physically
adsorbed or grafted directly on the surface.368 Hydrophobic polymers, such
as fluoroplastic coated implants for otolaryngology applications, have also
demonstrated inhibition of biofilm formation using S. aureus as the chal-
lenge organism.369 Research, including clinical trials, on coatings con-
taining phosphorylcholine (PC) demonstrated that biofilm formation was
reduced on PC coated materials compared with the uncoated controls.370
More recently, there has been interest in superhydrophobic surface
topographies (water contact angle 41501),371 which facilitate repellence and
minimise bacterial adhesion. Researchers have taken inspiration from nature
in this regard. Anti-fouling superhydrophobic surfaces have been designed by
replicating the leaves of the lotus flower plant to amplify hydrophobicity.117,372
The lotus flower eﬀect derives from the combination of micro- and nano-
rough architectures including hydrophobic, nanostructured, wax crystalloids
on top of microscale convex surface features.85,372 Such superhydrophobic
surfaces prevent contact between a bacterium and the surface by entrapping
air between nanostructures on the surface.85,373
Inorganic Biomaterials to Support the Formation and Repair of Bone Tissue
283

Other recent endeavours to develop superhydrophobic materials include
slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) technology, which is inspired
by Nepenthes pitcher plants. This also has nanostructured and micro-
structured architectures on the substrate, but here they are infiltrated with a
lubricating fluid which is held in place by the architecture.374 The lubricant
prevents bacterial attachment on the implant surface.375,376 The researchers
demonstrated vastly superior ability to prevent biofilm formation for a var-
iety of species including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Escherichia
coli (E. coli), and S. aureus.376 Another study investigated surface structuring
using ultrashort pulsed laser ablation to create diﬀerent structures; hier-
archical micro- and nano-sized spikes, microsized grooves, nanosized rip-
ples, and unstructured surfaces together with infusing perfluoropolyethers
of diﬀerent viscosities.377 A 100-fold reduction in the formation of bio-
films of the human oral pathogen Streptococcus oralis was observed. The best
results were obtained with the hierarchical spike structure combined with
lubricants of medium viscosity. However, the results of the study demon-
strated that the surfaces also inhibited adhesion of human fibroblasts and
osteoblasts.377 This is a feature of many anti-adhesive coating strategies:
they do not discriminate between bacterial and mammalian cell adhesion.
These materials thus also inhibit adhesion of the osteoblasts that are re-
quired for osteogenesis and implant fixation.378 Consequently, in cases
where osteointegration is required research has also been directed towards
dual function surfaces that both inhibit bacterial adhesion and promote
mammalian cell attachment.85
Studies have concluded that the surface growth of initially adhering
bacteria is influenced by the surface charge of the biomaterials.379 A series of
methacrylate polymers and copolymers varying in surface charge from
positive to negative were used to investigate the initial adhesion and growth
of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including S. aureus,
S. epidermidis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. The initial adhesion of all the
bacterial strains, which carry a negative charge, was more rapid on positively
charged substrates. However, growth of Gram-negative bacteria was absent
on the positively charged surfaces, which was attributed to strong electro-
static attraction of the organisms impeding the surface growth. In contrast,
while adhesion on negatively charged substrates was relatively slower,
growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains was evident. The
presence of a comparatively thicker and more rigid peptidoglycan layer in
Gram-positive bacteria was proposed to explain their growth on substrates
irrespective of surface charge.379

Contact Active Surfaces
Tailoring the compositional and architectural features of implant surfaces to
control infection by both chemical and physical means represent some of
the more novel approaches. Non-leaching biocidal agents represent a less
established approach. These kill microbes on contact with the coating
284

surface without the need for antimicrobial release. For instance, ‘self-ster-
ilising’ surfaces containing polycationic quaternary ammonium materials
anchored to the implant surface through covalent bonds exert their eﬀects
by damaging cell membranes.380,381
The permanent attachment of drugs to surfaces can be achieved through
the various functional groups of antibiotics (amine, carboxyl, or aldehyde),
which can form covalent bonds or electrostatic interactions with the specific
groups on the coating.382 It can alternatively be mediated by linkers (e.g.
ethylene glycol).383 The covalent attachment of vancomycin on Ti alloy sur-
faces prevented colonisation with S. aureus384 and S. epidermidis even when
subject to multiple challenges.385 Natural polycations, such as chitosan,
have also been immobilised onto Ti to confer antimicrobial activity on the
surface through disruption of microbial cell membranes. Coatings prepared
through coupling chitosan to silanised Ti using a glutaraldehyde linker
demonstrated enhanced osteoblast proliferation and antimicrobial eﬀect
against a wide range of strains compared with Ti, over a 55 h study period.386
The use of antimicrobial peptides (AmPs) has been proposed to address
the problems of resistance associated with conventional antibiotic drugs,
and their use as contact-active biocides on the surfaces of medical devices
has been investigated.387–389 AmPs have demonstrated antibacterial, anti-
viral, and antifungal activity390 and several modes of action, including the
formation of pores in the cell membrane, have been proposed.391 Another
alternative includes immobilising antimicrobial metals on implant sub-
strates. Studies have shown a synergistic eﬀect whereby the antimicrobial
eﬀect was attributed not only to low concentrations of ions released from the
surface but also to free radical species formed by the immobilised anti-
microbial metals.392
Deposition of HA coatings is commonly undertaken using plasma spray-
ing, although this has a number of drawbacks including the requirement for
high processing temperatures and problems with coating uniformity and
stability.223,228 A novel coating technique CoBlasts has been proposed as an
alternative method to deposit high quality coatings using low tempera-
tures.393 CoBlasts was used to deposit a series of Sr-, Ag-, and Zn-doped
apatites onto Ti substrates. The modified surfaces were found to support
osteoblast proliferation similarly to, or better than, HA surfaces. Direct
contact between microbes and coated surfaces was observed to be a sig-
nificant factor contributing to antimicrobial and anti-colonising activity. The
Ag substituted apatite was observed to outperform both the Sr- and Zn-
substituted types in terms of biofilm inhibition.353
The advantages of using contact active anti-colonising coatings include
reduced toxicity owing to the antimicrobial agent being retained on the
surface. However, antibiotic coupled surfaces may give rise to the develop-
ment of resistant pathogens.394 The synthetic preparation of polycations is
cheap, and they are not susceptible to degradation and do not give rise to
bacterial resistance. However, less is known about their cytotoxicity and
biocompatibility in vivo.381 AmPs have not been applied clinically for

285

orthopaedic applications but are considered promising for the treatment of
antibiotic resistant infections and are reported to be less likely to induce
bacterial resistance than traditional antibiotics because they kill quickly and
specifically target the microbial membranes. However, it has also been ob-
served that the activity of the tethered AmPs does not directly correspond to
that of their analogues in solution, and toxicity concerns associated with the
use of high concentrations exist.16,395
A range of techniques including anodisation, etching (reactive-ion beam,
metal-assisted chemical), laser ablation, blasting, and chemical (chemical
vapour deposition) techniques have been used to create micro- and nano-
structures to promote osteointegration and impart antibacterial fea-
tures.85,396 Some of the seminal work on bactericidal properties arising from
physical nanotopographies has emerged from research by Ivanova et al.,
which demonstrated that 200 nm tall nanopillar arrays on the surface of
cicada (Psaltoda claripennis) wings mechanically penetrated P. aeruginosa,
resulting in bacterial cell death.397,398 The same group reported biomimetic
bactericidal surfaces engineered by creating high aspect ratio nanoprotru-
sions on black silicon using reactive-ion etching, inspired by the wings of the
dragonfly Diplacodes bipunctata. The cellular integrity of all species appeared
to be significantly disrupted by the nanopillars on black silicon, and they
were eﬀective not only against the Gram-negative P. aeruginosa but also
against Gram-positive S. aureus and B. subtilis.399
A range of diﬀerent nanostructures, including pillars, needles, cones, and
wires, have been investigated on diﬀerent materials, including silicon, Ti,
diamond, polymers, SS, and Al, which highlights the versatility and potential
of this approach.85,399,400 Bactericidal nanopatterning of surfaces is an area
of increasing interest, and more in-depth studies are needed, as a variety of
architectural features, including density, width, height, and inter-spacing
distance, have been proposed to exert bactericidal activity, with responses
varying according to the bacterial challenge used.85,399,400 Recent reviews of
the literature have also indicated that other mechanisms besides mechanical
rupture of the bacterial cell may account for the antibacterial action. Strong
attachment of bacteria to the nanostructures, which is mediated by EPS, is
thought to inhibit bacterial movement away from the hostile surface and
result in damage to the cell membrane. Furthermore, mechanotransduction
pathways in which the mechanical forces aﬀect the metabolomics and the
genomics of bacteria have also been proposed as possible mechanisms.401

Summary and Future Perspectives
Orthopaedic devices have had a transformative eﬀect on the lives of patients
by replacing or repairing diseased or damaged parts of the body. However,
aseptic loosening owing to osteolysis and implant-related infections remain
among the leading reasons for orthopaedic device failure. This chapter
provides an overview of a diverse body of research employing inorganic
biomaterials, including metals, bioactive glasses, glass-ceramics, and
286
Chapter 5

calcium phosphate ceramics, to address the current limitations and support
the restoration of bone tissue. Eﬀorts have been directed towards developing
smarter, mechanically competent, and biocompatible materials that re-
capitulate the native environment by tailoring composition and architecture,
with a view to preventing infection and ensuring greater integration with the
host to ensure long-term implant survival. This has been informed by a
better understanding of the interaction at the biological interface between
the implant and host, which has been supported by multidisciplinary col-
laboration (biology, engineering, materials science, and computer science)
and advances in nanotechnology that have enabled more sophisticated
structures to be fabricated.
However, the form and function of bone tissue is complex, and it is cur-
rently diﬃcult to truly replicate the physical, mechanical, and biochemical
cues intrinsic in the native tissue. It must also be remembered that inherent
prerequisites in orthopaedic device design include the need to ensure that
any advancements do not add complexity to the surgical implantation pro-
cedure, and that intricate designs do not act as a barrier to scale-up and
manufacture. Notwithstanding that a considerable body of research exists,
the translation of next generation orthopaedic devices to clinical settings has
been slow. Much research is at relatively early stages in the development and
translation pathway, the majority of which will not progress to clinical ap-
plication. This attrition probably arises from regulatory hurdles, the paucity
of accurate clinical data, and the high cost of undertaking such studies.
However, there is a growing demand for orthopaedic device procedures,
which is being driven by the increasing proportion of the population cat-
egorised as geriatric; the same cohort are also at increased risk of bone and
joint disease. This underscores the challenge for scientists, regulators, and
healthcare professionals to work together to develop and translate novel
research into cost-eﬀective solutions in clinical settings.

6.1
Role of Inorganic Nanomaterials in Vaccine
Development
6.1.1
Adjuvants
A vaccine is a formulation used to induce specific immune responses to
protect the body from a disease. A vaccine is generally composed of a disease-
specific antigen (such as a killed or attenuated organism, protein or subunit of
protein, or DNA encoding the antigenic protein of the pathogen) and an ad-
juvant(s). The antigen mimics the disease-causing microorganism but is itself
not dangerous. In a potent vaccine, the antigen is recognised by the body as
‘foreign’ and an immune response to it is evoked. This allows the immune
system to learn to recognise the pathogen, and importantly to ‘remember’ it so
that upon subsequent exposure the body has suﬃcient biological defences to
the pathogen and defeats it without any illness resulting. This is akin to

footballers practicing on a training ground before going out to play a big
match. Traditionally, the antigen is a form of the pathogen that has been
made safe (‘attenuated’) or killed (‘inactivated’). These antigens cannot always
be used, however, because there is always a risk of some living and dangerous
pathogen being present after attenuation or inactivation. This means that in
the case of severe diseases (e.g. COVID-19 or Ebola), or with patients who
are immunocompromised, a safer antigen is needed. Subunit antigens
(comprising, for example, protein components of the pathogen) are used in
such cases – with these, there is no risk of any living pathogen being present,
and thus such vaccines are very safe. However, subunit antigens are poorly
immunogenic, and often fail to induce an immune response. This is a major
challenge for developing eﬃcient vaccines.1,2
In order to induce eﬀective protective immunity, poorly immunogenic
antigens such as subunits require boosting with agents called ‘adjuvants’.
Adjuvants can be classified into two types: immunomodulatory molecules
(IMs, defined as bioadjuvants in this chapter) and delivery systems (defined as
delivery-type adjuvants). These can be used for vaccine formulation indi-
vidually or in combination. The mechanism of action of adjuvants is complex
and varied, and in general not widely understood. Nevertheless, as detailed in
Table 6.1, clinical vaccine delivery systems [such as alum, emulsions, micro-
particles, immune-stimulating complexes (ISCOMs), and liposomes], and IMs

(e.g. unmethylated CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, CpG ODN) have been used for
many years. Adjuvants potentiate the immunostimulatory property of the
antigens, generally being non-toxic, and more or less biodegradable.3,4
The induction of protective immunity usually involves a two-step process.
The antigen is firstly captured and processed by antigen presenting cells
(APCs) and then brought into the lymphoid organs. APCs process antigens
into epitopes, and then these epitopes are combined with major histo-
compatibility complexes (MHCs) to form MHC–antigen complexes, which
are presented on the surface of APCs. These surface-presented antigens then
activate B and T lymphocytes in the lymphoid organs. The activation of B
lymphocytes promotes the production of antibodies. These are proteins
which circulate in the body and bind specifically to the antigen, preventing
the entry and spread of the pathogen and marking it for destruction by
macrophage cells. This is termed an antibody, humoral, or T helper type 2
(TH2) immune response. A range of antibody isotypes exist, including
immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, and IgD; the diﬀerent functions of
these has been discussed elsewhere.5 An antibody immune response is very
powerful in acting against extracellular pathogens, but cannot target
pathogens when they are inside a host cell.
In addition, the surface presentation of an antigen, together with other
activating stimuli, diﬀerentiates naive T cells into eﬀector and memory
lymphocytes. Eﬀector T cells include two classes: cluster of diﬀerentiation 4-
positive (CD41) eﬀector T cells and cluster of diﬀerentiation 8-positive (CD81)
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CD41 eﬀector T cells act to direct the immune
response. These co-called T helper (TH) cells fall in three main classes: TH1
[CD41–interferon gamma-positive (IFN-g1), which drive cell-mediated CTL
immunity], TH2 [CD41–interleukin 4 positive (IL-41), which direct a humoral
immune response)], and TH17 [CD41–interleukin 17-positive (IL-171), re-
cruiting leukocytes and inducing inflammation)]. CTLs kill infected cells and
tumour cells that display class I MHC–associated antigens, and secrete cyto-
kines that activate macrophages and cause inflammation. CTLs are thus
potent against intracellular pathogens (e.g. viruses).
The function of an adjuvant goes far beyond the stimulation of antibodies
against a pathogen. An ideal adjuvant should also help the vaccine to induce
strong cellular responses, such as activation of T helper (TH) cells and CTLs.
However, most current vaccine adjuvants in clinical use only induce antibody
immune responses, and only a few can trigger potent cellular and humoral
immune responses simultaneously.4 There are a number of proteins in the
body which are able to recognise pathogen-associated molecular patterns
(PAMPs), common molecular patterns encountered in the presence of
pathogens. The toll-like receptors (TLRs)6 are perhaps the most widely ex-
plored of these, but others also exist [e.g. nucleotide-binding oligomerisation
domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), stimulators of interferon genes (STING),
retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs)7,8].
This recognition activates both humoral and cellular immune responses
without systemic toxicity. TLR3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11 agonists promote strong
Inorganic Nanomaterials in Vaccines
307

TH1 responses, and TLR 1, 2, and 6 agonists direct immune responses to
TH2.7,9 The TLR9 agonist CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) has been clinically
approved for formulating a human hepatitis B vaccine.10 However, the poor
stability and lack of targeted delivery of these agonists dramatically restricts
their adjuvant eﬃciency. Therefore, they are often combined with vaccine
delivery systems (e.g. AS03, AS04, delivery adjuvants) to enhance and elicit
specific immune responses against co-administered antigens.11,12
In addition to prophylactic (protective) vaccination, which protects the body
against a disease before it is encountered, therapeutic vaccination is also
possible. This exploits the immune system to cure an existing disease con-
dition, such as a cancer. This often requires a cellular TH1 immune response,
and currently available adjuvants in general are not eﬀective in this modality.
As a result, a range of alternative adjuvants, such as lipid vehicles, syn-
thetic high-density lipoproteins (sHDL), clay nanoparticles, polymer nano-
particles and nanogels, have been examined (Table 6.2). The most important
advantages of these delivery adjuvants include more controllable in vivo
delivery of an antigen and their ease of combination with bioadjuvant IMs.
As a basic guideline, an ideal clinical delivery-type adjuvant should meet the
following requirements: (1) a simple and green synthetic process, (2) easy
vaccine formulation and ready combination with bioadjuvant IMs, (3) high
biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity, and (4) high eﬃciency in inducing
both humoral and cellular immune responses. Inorganic nanoadjuvants,
such as anionic clays [e.g. layered double hydroxides (LDHs), hectorite
nanosheets (HECs), mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and calcium
phosphate or carbonate nanoparticles (CaPs and CaCs)], appear to meet
these requirements and have been extensively investigated, showing great
potential for clinical applications.
6.1.2
Inorganic Nanoadjuvants
As the world-renowned immunologist Charles Janeway said, vaccine adjuvants
are ‘the immunologist’s dirty little secret’, despite being critical for inducing
an eﬀective immune response to vaccines. Aluminium salts (e.g. aluminium
hydroxide phosphates) are widely used as adjuvants, and can eﬃciently pro-
mote antibody immune responses.31 However, current vaccine adjuvants are
generally not well characterised, the exact mechanisms of how they work are
poorly understood, and their association with antigen presenting cells (APCs)
is not well established. Alternative adjuvants, such as LDHs, MSNs, and CaPs
or CaCs, with rationally designed chemical and physical features, are being
actively developed to ameliorate some of these issues. Other work has looked
to control and tune the properties of aluminium hydroxide-based adjuvants.
Several inorganic nanomaterials with potent adjuvanticity will be discussed in
this chapter, including two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials, such as LDHs,
and three-dimensional (3D) nanomaterials, such as MSNs, CaPs, and CaCs.
LDHs have been known for over 170 years, and are typical 2D anionic clay
materials (Figure 6.1).32,33 In the 1960s, LDHs were first employed in clinical
308

settings as antacids for the treatment of gastric diseases.34,35 The biomedical
applications of LDHs were limited by their generally large particle size until
successful approaches to nanoparticle synthesis were developed by Zhao
et al.36 and Xu et al.37 in the 2000s. Since then, nano-scale LDH materials
have been successfully prepared and used to deliver drugs and biomolecules
(such as peptides, proteins, and nucleic acids) to mammalian cells, opening
a new chapter in their biomedical applications.38,39 Many reports have been
published designing multifunctional LDH nanoparticles and looking to
simplify the synthesis for target clinical applications.

The application of LDHs as a vaccine adjuvant was first reported by Li et al.
in 2010,40,41 who demonstrated the adjuvanticity of MgAl–LDH and applied it
in a DNA vaccine formulation. Williams et al. further demonstrated a poten-
tial relationship between the chemical composition of LDH nanoparticles and
their adjuvanticity in 2014.42 Afterwards, LDH adjuvanticity and the mech-
anisms by which they induce immunity were further investigated by Chen
et al.20,43,44 and Yan et al.,18,45 and applications for cancer immunotherapy
and the in vivo antigen–LDH delivery mechanism were explored by Zhang
et al.46–48 These investigations have demonstrated that LDHs have the ability
to induce both potent humoral and cellular immunity, showing improved
performance when compared with adjuvants such Freund’s adjuvant,49 the
Quillaja saponaria derived adjuvant Quil A,43 and alum.18,44,46
MSNs were first developed in the 1990s,50 later becoming one of the most
important nanomaterials for controlled drug release and delivery. MSNs are
3D materials and have attracted significant research attention for various
drug delivery applications because of their low toxicity, tuneable particle
size, high porosity, versatile surface chemistry, high chemical stability, and
low cost.51,52 For vaccine adjuvant development, Cha et al.53 optimised the
MSN pore size (20–30 nm) to maximise the loading eﬃciency of protein and
nucleic acid-based antigens as well as IMs, and applied MSNs in the design
of cancer vaccines. The large pore-size MSNs showed significantly higher
loading of both protein antigens and short single-stranded synthetic DNA
molecules (the ‘danger signal’) than conventional small-pore MSNs.54 Other
researchers probed the eﬀect of MSN shape. It was found that rod-shaped
MSNs greatly enhanced the association between the vaccine and APCs, and
dramatically improved anti-tumour therapeutic eﬃcacy in comparison with
spherical particles.24 In addition, the flexible surface silane modification of
MSNs allows for increased loading capacity (by optimising the electrostatic
interactions between the nanoparticles and the payload), and regulates their
interactions with APCs.55

Since previous reviews have summarised the immunological applications
of inorganic materials (such as MSNs),56–58 this chapter will focus on LDH
adjuvants and compare them with other inorganic materials, such as MSNs
and CaPs or CaCs.
6.2
Influence of Physicochemical Properties of
Inorganic Materials on their Adjuvant Activity
Changes in the chemical compositions and physical properties of nanoma-
terials may result in very diﬀerent adjuvanticity. The adjuvanticity of LDH
nanoparticles with a range of chemical composition has been explored, and
MgAl–LDH has been found to have much higher adjuvanticity than commercial
adjuvants (such as Freund’s adjuvant,49 Quil A,43 and alum18,44,46). Evidence
indicates that a change in physicochemical properties (e.g., size, surface
properties, and dispersity) can greatly influence the adjuvanticity of inorganic
materials such as LDHs, MSNs, CaP, and CaC. Exactly how these physico-
chemical properties influence adjuvanticity will be briefly discussed below.
6.2.1
Physical Properties
Physical properties such as size, shape, surface charge, and dispersity can
have a major influence on the adjuvant properties of a material. They can
aﬀect the antigen or bioadjuvant loading eﬃciency or modality, the cellular
uptake pathway, and subcellular distribution. Here, we will take some 2D
(i.e., LDH and HEC) and 3D [i.e., MSN and mesoporous silica nanorods
(MSR)] nanoparticles as examples to explore how physical properties influ-
ence interactions with the immune system.
6.2.1.1
Size
Based on the separate nucleation and aging steps (SNAS) developed by Zhao
et al.36 and a hydrothermal treatment method developed by Xu et al.,59,60 the
size of LDH particles can be controlled over the range from approximately 30
to 1000 nm. Studies have shown that the size of LDH particles determines
the protein antigen adsorption capacity. As shown in Figure 6.2a, Gu et al.61
demonstrated that the maximum protein adsorption capacity of 50 nm small
LDH (sLDH) particles was 1.34 mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA) per mg
sLDH, much higher than that of 110 nm LDH (0.70 mg BSA per mg LDH).
Meanwhile, LDH can also adsorb bioadjuvants such as double stranded DNA
(dsDNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA).62,63
At the cellular level, the size is an important factor in determining the
LDH uptake eﬃciency, pathway, and subcellular retention.64 Four fluor-
escein isothiocyanate (FITC)-intercalated hexagonal LDH particles with
diﬀerent sizes of 50, 100, 200, and 350 nm were synthesised, and their up-
take by human osteosarcoma (MNNG/HOS) cells investigated (Figure 6.2b).

The smallest LDH nanoparticles (50 nm) were most eﬃciently internalised,
followed by a size order of 200Z1004350 nm. Notably, many fewer 350 nm
LDH nanoparticles were taken up by cells, which may be due to the larger
particle diameter : thickness aspect ratio. The cellular uptake rate and the
retention of LDH nanoparticles are also highly size- and time-dependent. For
example, 50 nm LDH nanoparticles were quickly taken up by HOS cells
within 15 min, but extending the incubation time did not promote more
internalisation. In contrast, LDHs of other sizes showed time-dependent
cellular uptake and the uptake amount seemed to reach a maximum after
2 h (Figure 6.2b). Although the 50 nm LDH nanoparticles had a higher
cellular uptake rate initially, they were rapidly degraded within 1 h
(Figure 6.2c) while the cellular fluorescence intensity from the other LDH
nanoparticles remained almost unchanged over 24 h.64 These phenomena
indicate that LDH particles smaller than 100 nm may be more easily de-
composed in subcellular organelles, especially in acidic compartments,
such as endosomes and lysosomes. Overall, the literature indicates that
LDHs with sizes in the range of 100 to 200 nm have a higher uptake rate and
a longer retention time in cells. In addition, the cellular uptake of LDH
nanoparticles has been shown to be concentration dependent, and the
LDH saturation concentration in culture medium varies depending on the
LDH size.65,66
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a vesicular transport event that facili-
tates the internalisation and recycling of receptors on the cell surface.67
Only LDH nanoparticles with a size from 50 to 200 nm are associated with
such receptors and selectively internalised into cells via clathrin-medicated
endocytosis (Figure 6.2d). The uptake mechanism of large LDHs is not
clathrin-mediated, but possibly instead occurs via passive endocytosis.68
Similarly to LDHs, MSNs have also shown size-dependent cellular uptake
behaviour. In a study exploring MSNs of 30, 50, 110, 170, and 280 nm in size,
50 nm MSNs showed the highest extent of internalisation by human cervical
cancer (HeLa) cells, 20 times higher than that of 170 nm MSNs.70 Another
study investigated the influence of the MSN size (55.6, 167.8, and 307.6 nm)
on the cellular uptake pathway, and the results indicated that the cellular
uptake of MSNs by HeLa cells was dependent on an energy-dependent
pathway (endocytosis), except for the smallest particles (55.6 nm), which
could be partially internalised through an energy-independent pathway.71
Furthermore, the size of MSNs may aﬀect the particle localisation in cells.
Pan et al.72 showed that 25 and 50 nm MSNs were enriched in the nucleus,
while larger MSNs (67 and 105 nm) accumulated solely in the cytoplasm.
Consistent with previous studies showing that particle size is an important
determinant of adjuvanticity,73,74 the LDH size was found to influence the
strength of the immune response by Chen et al.43 Mg2Al–Cl–LDHs with average
sizes of 115, 243, and 635 nm (LDH-115, LDH-243, and LDH-635) were used to
form intimin b (IB, an antigen of enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic
Escherichia coli)-containing vaccines (LDH–IB). All LDH–IB vaccines had
similar properties except for the particle size. The immunological data
Inorganic Nanomaterials in Vaccines
313

indicated that LDH-115 promoted the highest IB-specific IgG antibody levels,
around 2- and 1.5-fold higher than LDH-243 and LDH-635, respectively.
For MSRs-based vaccines, a higher length : width ratio is beneficial for forming
a loose scaﬀold and thus gives stronger immune responses.25
6.2.1.2
Dispersity
The dispersity of nanoparticles is another important factor in influencing
the antigen or bioadjuvant loading and eﬃciency. A previous study observed
that the maximum BSA adsorption amount on 24 nm MgAl–LDH aggregates
was only 0.197 mg BSA per mg LDH, significantly lower than that of 50 nm
mono-dispersed sLDH (1.34 mg BSA per mg sLDH).61 The dispersity of the
LDH particles is the main cause of lower antigen or bioadjuvant loading
eﬃciency in the former case here. Zhang et al.47 found that when positively
charged monodispersed LDH nanoparticles interacted with BSA molecules
positively charged aggregates were formed, with BSA molecules embedded
inside the aggregates. When the adjuvant CpG was then added, this could
only be adsorbed on the surface of the aggregates, and thus the loading is
limited. However, when each LDH nanoparticle is maximally coated by BSA
(there is still 30–50% of uncovered LDH surface due to the steric repulsion
between BSA molecules) the suspension is stable and monodisperse, and
hence CpG can be eﬀectively loaded onto each LDH nanoparticle.
The colloidal stability of LDH particles can be controlled by surface coating
with polyethylene glycol,75 SiO2,76,77 albumin,61 or electrolytes.78–80 Without
the coating, LDH particles readily adsorb serum proteins, which may cross-
link LDH particles to form aggregates via the ‘bridging eﬀect’.61 For example,
an albumin coating uses endogenous host serum albumin and thus should
avoid any potential side eﬀects caused by the coating agent. Gu et al. prepared
well dispersed BSA-coated LDH (BSA–LDH) nanoparticles61 (Figure 6.3a, top).
When the particles are maximally coated, this leads to steric repulsion
between the LDH–BSA particles, and prevents aggregation. In contrast, when
there is only a limited amount of BSA present, the proteins bridge between
the LDH particles and cause aggregation (Figure 6.3a; bottom). As shown in
Figure 6.3b–d, compared with the extensive aggregation seen with the pris-
tine LDHs in PBS, the BSA–LDH complexes show very good dispersity, even in
PBS and foetal bovine serum (FBS).47
The particle dispersity also aﬀects the cellular uptake. As depicted in
Figure 6.4a, both aggregated nanoparticles (termed a-BTLC) and mono-
dispersed nanoparticles (s-BTLC) were eﬃciently internalised by dendritic
cells (DCs). The cellular distribution after 24 h with s-BTLC showed that both
CpG (bioadjuvant) and BSA–Trp2 (antigen) were taken up by most cells, and
the lysosome (red), CpG (green) and BSA (dark cyan) were co-localised in the
cytoplasm (cyan) of DCs. However, when the cells were treated with a-BTLC,
larger a-BTLC aggregates were internalised by some cells, but the BSA–Trp2
and CpG signals were unevenly distributed (Figure 6.4b), with overall in-
tensity being much weaker.

Shape
The shape of nanomaterials is also thought to be important in influencing
their cellular uptake behaviour and subcellular localisation. Xu et al.81 in-
vestigated the cellular localisation of LDHs with diﬀerent shapes. FITC dye
was used to label hexagonal LDH nanosheets (LDHFITC-HEX) and rod-like
LDH nanoparticles (LDHFITC-ROD) with the same chemical composition. In
uptake studies, these were directed towards diﬀerent subcellular compart-
ments (Figure 6.5a). With the hexagonal platelets, for 3 h after addition the

fluorescence of the cytoplasm was very bright while the nuclei were dark,
indicating that LDHFITC-HEX nanosheets entered cells but stayed in the
cytoplasm rather than entering the nuclei. This was also observed by Oh
et al.69 In contrast, nuclear fluorescence after internalisation of LDHFITC-ROD
was bright while the cytoplasm was barely fluorescent (Figure 6.5b),
indicating that internalised LDHFITC-ROD nanoparticles mostly accumulated
in the nucleus. It is worth mentioning that such intracellular compartment
targeting of FITC cannot be achieved by free FITC diﬀusion.82
It was found that both LDHFITC-HEX and LDHFITC-ROD were first bound to
the cell membrane and subsequently internalised into the cytoplasm or
translocated to the nucleus. Initially rapid uptake in the first 30 min was
seen with both morphologies, followed by steady uptake over 4–8 h
(Figure 6.5c and d). The cellular uptake of both LDHFITC-HEX and LDHFIT
C-ROD is subtly diﬀerent. In contrast to LDHFITC-HEX, the FITC amount in the
cytoplasm and on the membrane of cells treated with LDHFITC-ROD remained
almost invariant while the amount of FITC in the nucleus gradually
increased to a much higher level, indicating a prompt and continuous
nuclear translocation of LDHFITC-ROD nanoparticles after internalisation.
Hexagonal LDH platelets in the cytoplasm can target the mitochondria.
Zhu et al. prepared etoposide (VP16) loaded LDH (LDH–VP16) nanoparticles
and investigated their localisation in A549 cells.83 TEM images (Figure 6.5e)
clearly indicate that most LDH–VP16 particles were distributed in the cytosol
with a few in the nucleus. Confocal images showed that LDH–VP16 was
co-localised with the mitochondria after 8 h of incubation (Figure 6.5e).
The concentration of VP16 was higher in the mitochondria than in the
cell homogenate, and LDH–VP16-treated cells showed a higher VP16 con-
centration than using free VP16.
The shape of MSNs has generally not been found to influence their cellular
localisation. However, the size of Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15) MSRs
on cellular uptake was much greater than that of spherical MSNs.84 Smaller
spherical MSNs (o100 nm) showed higher cellular uptake than larger particles,
and similar results were noted with rod-shaped SBA-15 type MSRs. Smaller rods
(length 80–200 nm, width 18 nm) had higher cellular uptake eﬃciency than
larger analogues (length 0.78–1.5 mm, width 220–350 nm). Furthermore, rod-
shaped MSNs with aspect ratios of 1.5–1.7 (110–130 : 60–80 nm), 2.1–2.5
(160–190 : 60–90 nm), and 4–4.5 (260–300 : 50–70 nm) displayed uptake eﬃ-
ciencies 18-, 40-, and 8-fold higher than spherical MSNs (approximately
110 nm), respectively. The findings indicate that an appropriate aspect ratio of
MSRs results in higher cellular uptake due to the mechanosensitive nature of
the uptake process.85
6.2.1.4
Surface Charge
Most inorganic nanoparticles (MSNs, CaCs, CaPs, and silica-based layered
materials) have a negatively charged surface, while LDH particles are
positively charged. Protein antigens are made up of amino acids with some
318
Chapter 6

side chains bearing either positively (–NH3
1, –NH2R1, or others) or
negatively (–COO) charged groups under physiological conditions. The
relative charge number of the carrier particle and antigen will play an
important role in determining the interactions between them. Chen et al.
showed that Intimin b (IB) (approximately 480 amino acids) was eﬃciently
adsorbed by both LDH particles with positive surface charges and hectorite
(HEC) with negative charges on the surface (Figure 6.6a–b). The negatively
charged groups (–COO) of IB may electrostatically interact with the LDH
surface, while its positively charged groups are exposed to the aqueous
phase. When IB interacts with HEC, the association arises from the
positively charged groups interacting with the negative surface of HEC.43
Thus, the characteristic peaks for IB at approximately 1650 cm1 of
stretching of CQO (nCQO) 1536 cm1 N–H bending (dN–H), and 1465 cm1
C–H bending (dC–H) were observed in LDH–IB or HEC–IB (Figure 6.6c). IB
adsorption isotherms revealed that the maximum adsorption amount was
1.11 mg (IB) mg1 (LDH-115 : 115 nm LDH) and 4.41 mg (IB) mg1 (HEC-
77 : 77 nm HEC; Figure 6.6d, e). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) demonstrated that more LDH was required to
completely adsorb IB (LDH:IB ¼ 8 : 1 w/w) than HEC (HEC:IB ¼ 4 : 1 w/w),
further indicating that HEC has higher protein adsorption capacity
(Figure 6.6f, g).
Similar phenomena were also observed for the adsorption of other
proteins such as E. coli proprietary antigen 1 and proprietary antigen 2.20
Both LDH and HEC have much higher protein adsorption capacity than
many other nanomaterials such as hydroxyapatite, hollow MSNs and
CaCs.21,86,87 LDHs are thus a very suitable platform for protein adsorption
and loading, and have been applied for protein purification through
adsorption.88–90
The surface charge of nanoparticles is also an important factor aﬀecting the
cellular uptake eﬃciency and pathway.91 Positively charged LDH particles
easily adhere to the negatively charged cell membrane, forming a dense,
crystal-like cover on the cell surface (Figure 6.7a) and enhancing cellular
uptake.46,69 Although both positively and negatively charged particles are
taken up better than their uncharged counterparts,92–94 a positive charge is
more beneficial for cellular uptake. Chen et al.43 compared the cellular uptake
eﬃciency of plate-like LDH and HEC particles of similar size but opposite
surface charges. Both were loaded with FITC-labelled BSA (BSA–FITC).
Compared with free BSA–FITC, both LDH and HEC particles were eﬃciently
internalised by macrophage cells (Figure 6.7b) and similar percentages of cells
were found to take up particles in flow cytometry (Figure 6.7c). However, the
fluorescence intensity of cells treated with LDH particles was around twofold
greater than those exposed to HEC, indicating that more BSA–FITC was
delivered by the LDH particles.43
Serum proteins in the biological environment can bind with both posi-
tively and negatively charged particles, which can, in turn, influence cellular
uptake. Negatively charged carboxylated polystyrene particles were found to

bind more serum proteins than positively charged particles,95 whereas BSA
adsorption by negatively charged CeO2 particles was less than that by their
positively charged counterparts.96 Cells internalised BSA-coated polystyrene
nanoparticles to a lesser extent than uncoated ones,97 but serum-coated
cationic CeO2 and mesoporous silica particles showed higher cellular uptake
eﬃciency than uncoated analogues.98,99 Gu et al.61 showed that BSA coating
on an LDH surface did not aﬀect cellular uptake eﬃciency (Figure 6.7d).
They estimated that around 50–70% of the LDH surface was occupied by BSA
and the unoccupied surface was still able to accommodate dsDNA or siRNA,
and adhere onto the cell membrane. It seems that the binding of serum
proteins with nanoparticles is complicated and varies depending on the
particle’s charge and material nature, which may further aﬀect the cellular
uptake eﬃciency.

Chemical Composition
6.2.2.1
Influence of Chemical Composition on Adjuvanticity
LDHs are two-dimensional (2D) clay materials, whose formula can be gen-
erally represented as [M21
1xM31
x(OH)2]x1(An)x/nmH2O.100–102 Structurally,
LDHs are composed of brucite-like layers containing both divalent (e.g.,
Mg21, Fe21, Co21, Cu21, Ni21, Zn21) and trivalent metal cations (Al31, Cr31,
Ga31, In31, Mn31, Fe31) coordinated octahedrally by hydroxyl groups
(Figure 6.8a). The layers have positive charges, and x denotes the molar ratio
of trivalent metal cations, ranging from 0.2 to 0.4.103 Water and exchangeable
anions (e.g., NO3
, CO3
2, Cl, PO4
2) are situated in the interlayer gallery to
provide the charge balance. The ability to incorporate various divalent and
trivalent cations into the layers enables LDH compounds with a wide variety
of compositions to be generated, and this influences the adjuvanticity.
Williams et al. investigated the adjuvant eﬀect of a broad class of LDH
compounds (Figure 6.8b), finding that the chemical composition of
LDH directly aﬀected immunological responses.42 They noted that several
LDH compounds stimulated robust DC responses in vitro, much greater than
commercially used Imject Alum and Alhydrogel (Figure 6.8b). In vivo
data further showed that these LDH nanoparticles elicited more potent
antibody responses than the commercial adjuvants. Changes in chemical
composition resulted in diﬀerent immune polarisation (Figure 6.8c).
For

induced
TH2-dominated antibody responses like alum adjuvants, but Mg2Fe-CO3 LDH
stimulated a more TH1-biased immune response.104,105 Other reports
described LDH compounds such as Mg2Al-(NO3, Cl or CO3) eliciting expan-
sion of antigen specific eﬀector cytotoxic T cells in vivo, despite having similar
components to Imject Alum,40,42 indicating that these LDH compounds could
be suitable to induce both humoral and cellular immunity.
For MgAl–LDH, diﬀerent Mg21 : Al31 ratios resulted in diﬀerent eﬀects on
the signalling pathways involved in DC activation.40 LDH nanoparticles with

diﬀerent Mg21 : Al31 ratios [1 : 1 (where there is coexistence of LDH and
aluminium hydroxide), 2 : 1 and 3 : 1, named R1, R2, and R3 respectively]
with an average particle size of around 57 nm and zeta potential of þ35 mV
were taken up by DCs to a similar extent. However, the diﬀerence in the
Mg21 : Al31 ratio led to varied DC activation. R1 increased expression of
CD86 and CD40 (i.e. denoting maturation of DCs) in a dose-dependent way,
while R2 and R3 did not upregulate these co-stimulatory molecules.
6.2.2.2
Influence of Chemical Composition on Antigen Delivery
Pathway
Endosomes and lysosomes are important subcellular organelles for antigen
presentation. In these, the antigen is degraded by proteases into short
peptides (termed epitopes), which are combined with MHC II molecules
before being presented on the surface of APCs to promote antibody
responses. Some antigens may escape from endosomes or lysosomes or
directly enter the cytoplasm, where they are processed into peptides by
proteasomes and combined with MHC I molecules to direct cellular immune
responses.106 Therefore, the distribution of antigen epitopes in cells is
crucial, as it determines the type and strength of the immune response.
Although a cross-presentation pathway exists in the endosome and lysosome
to help induce cellular immune responses, its eﬃcacy can be limited. Thus,
finding ways to eﬀectively release epitopes from the endosome or lysosome
to the cytoplasm to promote strong cellular immune response is a key issue
for cancer therapeutic vaccines in particular.
Based on the chemical composition of an inorganic adjuvant, the en-
dosomal escape capability can be varied. Current classical endosomal or
lysosomal escape modes include the ‘proton sponge eﬀect’ of cationic
polymers,107,108 ‘CO2 blast eﬀect’ of carbonate-containing materials,21 and
‘salt osmotic eﬀect’ of LDHs and CaP.43,81,109 The latter arises from their
neutralisation with excess H1 in the endosome or lysosome. There are some
other endosomal escape mechanisms mediated by other kinds of materials,
such as pore formation using surfactants, membrane fusion or photo-
chemical disruption, which are detailed in a previous review.110
The endosomal escape mechanism for LDH is based on the salt osmotic
eﬀect (Figure 6.9a). When the endosome is acidified, the protons accumu-
lated in the endosome are rapidly neutralised by LDH. As LDH nanoparticles
dissolve and keep the endosomal pH at around 6, there is an influx of water
molecules due to the increase in ionic strength, leading to osmotic swelling
and endosome bursting. The residual LDH–antigen is thus released into the
cytoplasm.46,81 This process can occur very rapidly due to the LDH’s sensi-
tivity to pH (Figure 6.9b).81 In contrast, cationic polymers take a much longer
time to escape from a lysosome.111
For inorganic adjuvants without any neutralisation ability, such as MSNs,
once they are internalised by cells, they are processed through a lysosomal
pathway (MHC II pathway) to present antigens like the commercial

adjuvants Quil A and alum.20 One solution to this problem is to coat a
cationic polymer such as polyetherimide (PEI) on the particle surface,
helping them to escape from the lysosomes via the proton sponge eﬀect of
polymers.24 Other inorganic adjuvants, such as CaPs and CaCs, possess H1
neutralisation ability, so they can escape from endosomes and release
antigens to the cytoplasm.
Endosomal escape mediated by LDHs can eﬃciently avoid potential
antigen competition. In general, antigens with higher immunogenicity
will be processed first by APCs, and those with lower immunogenicity may be
lost. Chen et al.20 loaded three antigens to LDH, HEC, and Quil A to
formulate trivalent vaccines and found the LDH–antigen composites could
rapidly
escape
from
endosomes,
while
the
HEC–antigens
and
Quil
A–antigens went through the lysosomal pathway. This endosome escape
allows the antigens to be processed by the proteasome and/or endoplasmic
reticulum and delivered by vesicles for separate presentation. In contrast,
there may be some contest for expression within vesicles when antigens pass
through the lysosomal pathway.
CaC nanoparticles escape from lysosomes by neutralising the protons and
producing CO2 to burst the lysosome. Wang et al.21 showed that internalised
OVA@CaC [CaC particles loaded with ovalbumin (OVA)] were colocalised
with lysosomes at the early stages of observation. Subsequently, the lyso-
somes gradually disappeared, and the OVA signal became diﬀuse, indicating
that OVA@CaC particles were partly dissolved. This process is accompanied
by CO2 generation, resulting in a dramatic increase in pressure within the
lysosome and bursting. In this case, the OVA antigen could be subsequently
released into the cytoplasm, where the exogenous antigen could be degraded
into epitope peptides and bound to MHC I molecules.
6.2.3
Summary
The physical and chemical properties of inorganic adjuvants are clearly
critical factors in determining their adjuvanticity. Changing the size, dis-
persity, shape, and surface charge of the adjuvant particles alters their
interactions with immune cells. This includes their cellular uptake, the
distribution and targeting of the vaccine in the subcellular organelles, and
the retention time of the vaccine in the cell. The chemical composition is
also an important factor in determining adjuvanticity.
6.3
In Vivo Delivery of Vaccines
6.3.1
Depot Eﬀect
Current vaccine administration is generally via subcutaneous (SC), intra-
muscular (IM) or intraperitoneal (IP) injections. This often results in the
formation of a vaccine depot (e.g. with alum-based vaccines), which may
benefit immunity by providing continuous stimulation and maintaining
326
Chapter 6

durable immune responses (depot eﬀect), but could also induce inflam-
mation and tolerance.44,107,112–116 The vaccine depot helps maintain
memory cells and prolong antibody responses (for months for some adju-
vants) without repeated vaccine injection. The process of depot-mediated
immune induction is complicated, and also not universally accepted in
the literature. Once a vaccine depot forms at the injection site, APCs are
recruited from the peripheral blood to the injection site, and then filter into
the depot to capture the antigen-loaded particles. The APCs then mature
during their homing to the draining lymph nodes (dLNs), and finally
activate B and/or T lymphocytes in the dLNs to induce antigen-specific
humoral and cellular immune responses. The depot structure has a major
influence on the induction rate and the strength of the immune response
provoked, as a result of controlling (1) the release profile of the antigen or
antigen–carrier complex from the depot; (2) the extent and rate of filtration
and engagement of APCs with the depot; and (3) retention of antigens in
the depot.
Chen et al. compared the immune responses induced by vaccines
adjuvanted with Quil A, alum, LDH, and HEC.44 They found that the LDH
formulation most eﬃciently promoted antibody responses (Figure 6.10a).
This is thought to be because the LDH–antigen and HEC–antigen formu-
lations gave a looser depot scaﬀold than alum (Figure 6.10b). This looser
structure formed by LDH–antigen not only helps APCs more eﬃciently filter
into the depot and internalise antigens, but also causes less cell death
(Figure 6.10c) and inflammation than alum.117 It was found that 50–60% of
the antigens from the LDH depot were released over 35 days, while more
than 90% of the antigens remained in the alum depot. Moreover, the LDH
depot gradually degraded and disappeared within 2 months, while the alum
depot was unchanged in size for 2 months and persisted for a much longer
period. Moreover, more DCs, neutrophils, and macrophages were recruited
by the LDH–antigen depot than the alum–antigen depot. It is thus
found that clay adjuvants (LDH and HEC) complexed with antigens form a
loose depot structure at the site of injection, which promotes durable
immune responses.
MSRs can spontaneously assemble in vivo to form porous structures
after being injected subcutaneously.118 A vaccine based on MSNs of a few
hundred nanometres in size was taken up by APCs. In contrast, APCs were
recruited into the 3D interparticle pores of the MSR scaﬀold, resulting in
their activation (Figure 6.10d–f). The MSR vaccine not only induced
strong antigen-specific CTL responses, but also elicited significantly
more robust TH1 cellular and TH2 antibody responses than alum.25
A modified MSR-based vaccine formed by absorbing a layer of PEI on
the surface of MSRs further enhanced host DC activation and T cell
responses.24
These studies show that optimisation of the microstructure of the vaccine
depot can improve interactions between APCs and the vaccine, thereby
significantly enhancing the immune response.

6.3.2
Delivery of Vaccines to dLNs
The depot eﬀect helps vaccines induce durable and potent immune
responses, but the speed at which they do so is often very slow. For most
adjuvanted vaccines, it takes 2–3 weeks in mice (equivalent to 2–3 months in
humans) to induce a suitably robust immune response, which cannot
overcome rapidly progressing diseases such as cancer.119–121 Mature APCs
can rapidly activate B and/or T lymphocytes in the dLNs, but the depot
recruitment, activation and lymphatic homing of APCs requires about
2 weeks.119,122 Thus, delivering vaccines directly to the dLNs could imme-
diately activate APCs and B and/or T lymphocytes in the same organ.
Many eﬀorts have been made to do this by modifying the surface features,
reducing particle size, and enhancing in vivo dispersity.123–125
For most nanoparticle-based vaccines surface modification is an eﬃcient
strategy to enhance their association with APCs. Targeting ligands such as
CD11c, CD40, Dec205, DC-SIGN, MUC-1, Dectin-1, LOX-1, Clec9A, mannose
receptor, and Fc fragment receptor can be crosslinked to the surface of
nanoparticles, and subsequently bind specifically to DC receptors.126,127
Similarly, inorganic adjuvants such as lipid-coated calcium phosphate
(LCP) integrated with mannose-modified lipid molecules can be eﬃciently
taken up by DCs, and the DCs transported to the dLNs to induce potent
immune responses.23 Other reports have also shown that peptides or ligands
can be crosslinked to the surface of inorganic nanoparticles including
MSNs,128 LDHs,129 and CaPs130 for targeting to APCs.
Previous studies have revealed that nanoparticles can passively accu-
mulate in the dLNs in a size-dependent manner.131 For example, the ac-
cumulation of subcutaneously injected liposomes in the dLNs decreased
with an increase in their size (40, 70, 170, and 400 nm).132 Larger lipo-
somes remained at the injection site to a greater extent. Although reducing
the size of the individual particles in an inorganic adjuvant is feasible,
their aggregation in vivo could obviate this eﬀect. Such aggregation is a
common problem, and greatly limits migration to and interactions with
the dLNs.
Some studies have improved the ability of adjuvants to move into nearby
dLNs and enhance the presentation of antigens to the immune system by
optimising the adjuvants’ in vivo dispersity. For instance, LDH-based
nanovaccines with excellent in vivo colloidal stability were able to be eﬃ-
ciently delivered to dLNs.47 As shown in Figure 6.11a and b, monodispersed
particles (s-BTLC) quickly migrated into dLNs while most of the aggregated
particles (a-BTLC) remained at the injection site, indicating that enhanced
in vivo dispersity of LDH–antigens helps migration to the dLNs. The rapid
accumulation of s-BTLC in the dLNs eﬃciently inhibited tumour growth in
mice (Figure 6.11c1), and induced a high level of memory (Figure 6.11c2 and
c3) and antigen-specific CTLs (Figure 6.11c4). In comparison, the tumour
suppression caused by monodispersed s-BTLC was twofold higher than that
seen with aggregated a-BTLC.

Enhanced Humoral and Cellular Immune
Responses
6.4.1
2D Clay Adjuvants
Both LDH and HEC have shown stronger adjuvanticity than commercial
adjuvants, such as Freund’s adjuvant, alum, and Quil A. In the previous
sections, we have discussed the fact that both LDH and HEC have high
loading capacities for protein antigens, and that LDH particles can be
further loaded with co-stimulators, such as CpG ODN. In animal models,
LDH and HEC have been found to be able to simultaneously induce both
antibody and T cell responses.43 In addition, common side eﬀects such as
local inflammation, haemolytic activity and T cell apoptosis, which usually
arise with commercial adjuvants, are largely avoided.133,134
6.4.1.1
Stronger Adjuvanticity than Commercial Adjuvants
The oil-based Freund’s adjuvant is well known for its adjuvanticity and is
often used for antibody production in the laboratory.135 However, it causes
serious side eﬀects, such as local inflammation and T cell apoptosis around
the oil depot, which severely limits in vivo applications.136 Shafik et al. were
the first to use LDH as an adjuvant to replace Freund’s adjuvant for the
production of polyclonal antibodies in rabbits.49 Rabbits vaccinated with
LDH–AFP (LDH loaded with alpha-fetoprotein, AFP) very quickly generated
high levels of anti-AFP antibodies, and LDH–AFP was found to be more
eﬀective in this regard than Freund’s adjuvant.
LDHs have also been found to have higher adjuvanticity than alum. Early
in 2014, Yan et al. first found that LDH had similar abilities to alum
(AlOOH) to invoke an antibody response.18 Mg2Al-LDH was combined with
the model antigen OVA, and the TLR9 ligand CpG ODN as a co-stimulator
in some cases. As shown in Figure 6.12, LDH and alum led to the generation
of similar levels of anti-OVA IgG1 antibodies. When CpG was combined
with the LDH, this resulted in much greater anti-OVA IgG2a levels. The
LDH–CpG combination also polarised the immune responses from TH2 to
TH1. Chen et al. also found that LDH induced stronger humoral and
cellular immune responses than alum,44 using a bacterial protein IB as
the antigen.
Chen et al. compared the immune responses provided by LDH and HEC to
the commonly used Quil A adjuvant (potent for inducing both humoral and
cellular immunity). Both LDH and HEC were more eﬀective than Quil A in the
induction of antibody and cellular immune responses against diarrheagenic
E. coli.43 Furthermore, both LDH and HEC successfully maintained long-term
immunity up to 120 days, over which time period the immune strength showed
a slight decrease. In contrast, the potency of the immune response rapidly
dropped in mice treated with Quil A.

treatments are being explored as alternatives,146 and subunit vaccines have
also emerged as a safe and eﬀective strategy to control intestinal E. coli.147,148
Both LDH and HEC have shown the potential to induce potent immune
responses against pathotypes of E. coli. Chen et al. found that 115 nm LDH43
and 73–77 nm HEC149 could induce humoral and cellular immune responses
against the EHEC antigen IB significantly higher than those triggered by Quil
A and alum. However, there is an issue that single pathogen-target vaccines
are unable eﬀectively control the complex infections caused by EPEC.150,151
Therefore, multi-target vaccines are necessary for induction of a broad
spectrum of immune responses against pathogenetic E. coli. Chen et al.20
further developed triple-antigen clay-based vaccines against pathogenic
E. coli (Figure 6.13a). The formulations utilised LDH and HEC to complex
with a cocktail of three recombinant antigens: IB, proprietary antigen 1
(PAg1) and proprietary antigen 2 (PAg2). Both LDH and HEC stimulated
strong, durable, and balanced immune responses in mice. The trivalent LDH-
based vaccine induced higher levels of IgG against PAg1 and IB than a
bivalent (PAg1 þ IB) or monovalent vaccine (PAg1), indicating that a syn-
ergistic eﬀect exists between the antigens (Figure 6.13b, c). The multi-faceted
immune responses elicited by the multivalent LDH vaccine were significantly
higher than that induced by a Quil A-adjuvanted vaccine, thus more eﬃ-
ciently preventing the adherence of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli serotype O26
to mammalian cells.

3D Inorganic Adjuvants
6.4.2.1
Mesoporous Silica
Mesoporous silica materials are attractive adjuvant candidates for cancer im-
munotherapy given their high porosity, high biocompatibility, facile surface
modification, and flexibility in structure and morphology.152 For example, sub-
cutaneously injected nanometre-sized MSN-based cancer vaccines can be taken
up by peripheral APCs or APCs in the lymphoid organs to educate the immune
system to respond to cancer cells, while micrometre-sized MSR-based cancer
vaccines can recruit immune cells into the MSR scaﬀold and induce cancer-
specific immunity.24 Both silica-based vaccine systems successfully stimulate the
adaptive immune response and enable cancer to be eradicated in vivo.24,25
The structure is an important factor influencing MSN and MSR ad-
juvanticity. Wang et al. compared the ability of both hollow and non-hollow
MSNs with similar particle size, pore size, and surface properties to induce
an immune response to cancer with OVA as the antigen and poly(I:C) as the
bioadjuvant.153 Their results indicated that the hollow structure of MSNs
significantly improved cellular uptake of antigen and gave stronger anti-
cancer immunity in vivo. The pore size of MSNs is an important factor that
influences the loading of antigenic payloads and immune stimulators. Most
MSNs investigated in the past decades are MCM-41-type MSNs with small
mesopores (3 nm). Kwon et al.154 synthesised uniform and size-controllable

MSNs with extra-large pores (B25 nm; XL-MSN). The XL-MSN systems
were used to develop cancer therapeutic vaccines containing CpG ODN
and OVA (Figure 6.14).53 The results indicated that the XL-MSN-based vac-
cines were eﬃciently delivered to the dLNs and induced potent immune
responses.
Wang et al.155 prepared three diﬀerent kinds of silica (S1, S2, and SBA-15)
with diﬀerent particle sizes (130 and 430 nm, and 1–2 mm) and diﬀerent pore
characteristics (size and shape) loaded with the model antigen BSA. Their
in vivo data indicated that the antibody titres induced by silica–BSA lay in the
order S14S24SBA-15. The potency of S1–BSA is attributed to its large
honeycombed pores and the optimal particle diameter of 430 nm, which
induces both TH1- and TH2-mediated immune responses. Similarly, results
described in a recent report further indicated that the pore size of MSNs
dramatically influenced the strength of the induced anti-tumour immunity. As
shown in Figure 6.14e–g, MSNs with large pore size (12.9 nm) induced a much
higher level of antibody immunity and more eﬃciently inhibited tumour
growth than MSNs with medium (10.3 nm) and small (7.8 nm) pores.156
6.4.2.2
CaCs
CaC has been widely explored in biomineralisation, catalysis, biomedicine,
and many other fields.157,158 As for other adjuvants, the size of CaC particles
also aﬀects their adjuvanticity. Jia et al.22 optimised the synthetic conditions
for CaC via diﬀerent mixing strategies and successfully obtained spherical
CaC microparticles with sizes ranging from 0.8 to 5 mm (Figure 6.15). In vivo
data indicated that the 1 mm CaC–Ag vaccine led to more robust antigen-
specific antibody and T cell responses and more potent immunogenic
memory after intramuscular vaccination, performing better than com-
mercial alum (approximately 1–2 mm).

Examples of Inorganic Adjuvants in Cancer
Immunotherapy
The number of patients with malignant cancers worldwide is expected to
increase from 18.1 million in 2018 to 29.5 million in 2040.159 Conventional
treatment strategies such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy
often fail to overcome problems with tumour metastasis and recur-
rence.160,161 Immunotherapy can potentially lead to systemic immune sur-
veillance and tumour clearance by eliciting potent CTL and TH1 responses,
and thereby eﬀectively overcome these issues. However, tumour immune
tolerance is a major obstacle that impairs immunotherapy.162,163 The
continuous loss and mutation of tumour surface-associated antigens lead to
oﬀ-targets from specific CTL responses,1,164 and the acidic tumour micro-
environment causes dysfunction of macrophages and T cells.165 Thus, in an
eﬃcient cancer therapeutic vaccine, the role of the adjuvant is crucial. In this

section, we will discuss formulation strategies using inorganic adjuvants
(i.e. LDH, MSN and/or MSR, CaC, and CaP) in therapeutic cancer vaccines.
6.5.1
LDH-based Cancer Therapeutic Vaccines
LDHs represent a suitable platform for loading proteins, peptides, and DNA
plasmid antigens.18,41,46 The high payload eﬃciency of LDHs means that
co-stimulators (IMs) can also be added. Several multifunctional LDH-based
cancer vaccines have therefore been designed.
DCs are one of the most important APCs, but exhibit antigen tolerance
rather than promoting immune activation in tumour patients owing to the
overexpression of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).166–169 Zhang et al.
co-loaded the tumour antigen tyrosinase-related protein 2 (Trp2) and
a siRNA that silences IDO-gene expression (siIDO) to LDH particles
(LDH–siIDO–Trp2), and successfully enhanced the anti-tumour eﬃcacy by
simultaneously relieving the DC immune tolerance and promoting antigen
presentation (Figure 6.16a).46
To overcome issues of oﬀ-target eﬀects caused by the loss and/or mutation of
tumour cell-associated antigens,1,164 alternate antigens are required in sub-
sequent rounds of therapy.170–173 Co-delivery of multiple antigen epitopes
including classical tumour antigen epitopes and neo-antigen epitopes is a
possible strategy for developing personalised vaccines to promote broad-
spectrum CTL responses and avoid oﬀ-target aﬀects.26 For instance, Zhang
et al.47 prepared single (s-BTLC), dual- (s-BMsLC) and triple-epitope (s-BmALC)
vaccines based on LDHs, and found that the triple-epitope system (s-BmALC)
inhibited tumour growth more eﬀectively than the other formulations
(Figure 6.16b). The complex microenvironment in the tumour tissues often
also prevents eﬃcient cytotoxic T cell function. To maintain the cytotoxicity of
eﬀector T cells, several immune checkpoint inhibitors that prevent the ‘oﬀ’
signal from being sent and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells have been
combined with vaccines in preclinical and clinical treatments.165,174
In situ vaccination is an alternative immunotherapy which induces more
precise yet broad-spectrum immune responses in patients. For example,

chemotherapy or nanoparticle-based photothermal–photodynamic therapy
(PTT–PDT) can release tumour antigens for induction of specific immune
responses.175,176 Zhang et al.48 developed a multifunctional LDH-based
nanomedicine (IDCB–LDH) integrating three FDA-approved therapeutics,
indocyanine green (ICG for PTT), doxorubicin (chemotherapy) and CpG
(for immunotherapy) and LDH nanoparticles. This formulation eﬃciently
eradicated the primary tumour, induced potent anti-tumour immunity,
and largely prevented the recurrence and lung metastasis of breast cancers
(Figure 6.16c–e).
6.5.2
MSN- and MSR-based Cancer Therapeutic Vaccines
The use of MSNs to develop functional vaccines for cancer has also been
explored. For example, lipid bilayer coated MSNs were loaded with the
chemotherapeutic drug oxaliplatin (OX) and IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-D-tryp-
tophan (IND) (OX/IND–MSNP) and eﬃciently inhibited tumour growth
and prevented metastasis (Figure 6.17a).177 As shown in Figure 6.17b–c, the
OX/IND-MSNP nanoparticles eﬃciently eliminated the primary tumour by
inducing cancer cell death through OX and down-regulating IDO via IND,
and significantly inhibited liver metastasis.
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) combined with immune checkpoint block-
ade (ICB) can also eﬃciently eradicate the tumour and inhibit lung meta-
stasis.178,179 For example, Yang et al.178 developed a smart nanoreactor based
on pH-responsive polymer modified hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) via
conjugating a mitochondria targeting moiety [3-carboxypropyl-triphenyl-
phosphonium bromide (CTPP)] and loading a photosensitiser [chlorin e6
(Ce6)]. This was then combined with an antibody to the PD-L1 ICB
(Figure 6.17d). The in vivo data indicated that both the primary tumour
and distant tumour were significantly suppressed in mice receiving the
combined treatment (Figure 6.17e–f).
6.5.3
CaC and CaP Adjuvants
Protein antigens can be encapsulated into CaCs, and their typically rough
surface makes them interact eﬀectively with APCs. Wang et al.21 developed
OVA-doped CaC nanoparticles (OVA@NP, Figure 6.18). The OVA@NP for-
mulation eﬃciently delivered antigens to DCs and aided antigen escape
from lysosomes. This increased antigen cross-presentation, elicited CD81
T cell proliferation and potent CTL responses, and was able to eﬀectively
ameliorate tumour growth.
CaCs are also able to neutralise the acid existing in the tumour micro-
environment, which further helps activate tumour-associated macrophages
(TAMs) and enhances cancer immunotherapy. TAMs are cellular components
of innate immunity that phagocytise foreign substances and present them to
T lymphocytes (T cells).180,181 However, cancer cells can escape from TAM
recognition via upregulation of the integrin-associated protein (IAP)-CD47,

which provides an antiphagocytic ‘don’t eat me’ signal. The acidic tumour
microenvironment182 also induces anti-inflammatory TAMs (M2-type) and
promotes tumour growth.183,184 As shown in Figure 6.19, Chen et al.185
developed an immunotherapeutic gel that controlled both local tumour
recurrence and the development of distant tumours. CaC nanoparticles were
pre-loaded with the anti-CD47 antibody and then encapsulated in a fibrin gel.
Once the gel was sprayed on the tumour lesion after surgery, CaCs could
gradually scavenge H1 in the surgical wound and promote polarisation of
M2-type TAMs to a pro-inflammatory anti-tumour phenotype (M1-type).
Meanwhile, the released anti-CD47 antibody could block the ‘don’t eat me’
signal in cancer cells, thereby increasing their phagocytosis by M1-type TAMs.
CaP is also suitable for cancer immunotherapy, and has been approved by
the FDA for human use.186–188 CaP can be eﬃciently loaded with nucleic
acid-based bioadjuvants and small-molecule drugs.189 Recently, lipid-coated
calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticles were developed and found to be
readily PEGylated to extend circulation times.187 The outer lipids can be

further functionalised with targeting ligands (such as folic acid) and anti-
bodies (such as scFv) for targeted delivery.130 Xu et al.23 developed a dual
strategy, including lipid-coated calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticles and
liposome–protamine–hyaluronic acid, to simultaneously overcome the im-
mune response-inhibiting tumour microenvironment and induce antigen-
specific immune responses.
6.5.4
Metal and Metal-oxide Particles
Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, such as gold (Au) and iron oxide
(IONPs), have also been applied for cancer immunotherapy. For example,
Au NPs with a mean size of 5 nm were found to be skin permeable,
assisting proteins to penetrate the skin and promoting immunity. Huang
et al. developed a non-invasive vaccine delivery strategy by topically co-
administrating antigens with Au-NPs, and robust immune responses were
elicited in the tested animals (see Figure 6.20a and b).190 Zhao et al. also
observed that IONPs loaded with OVA greatly promoted the activation of
immune cells and cytokine production, induced potent humoral and cellular
immune responses, and inhibited tumour growth (Figure 6.20c).191
6.5.5
Graphene Oxide
Graphene oxide (GO) is derived from graphene by oxidation, which allows
it to retain the planar structure and high surface area of the patent material
while introducing hydrophilic moieties such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and
epoxy groups.192 GO has been applied as a vaccine adjuvant for immuno-
therapy, and can eﬃciently deliver antigens to DCs and promote cross-
presentation to CD81 T cells.193 For example, human amyloid peptide (Ab)
and amylin were loaded on GO by noncovalent interactions and the
resultant formulations eﬃciently promoted antigen-specific immunity.45
GO loaded with glioma (brain tumour) antigen was able to inhibit the
progression of cancer more eﬀectively than antigen or GO-treated DCs.46
6.6
Safety of Inorganic Adjuvants
6.6.1
LDHs
Cellular cytotoxicity data have shown that LDHs have generally high bio-
compatibility and low cytotoxicity to healthy cells.39,46,194–197 Toxicity data
for MgAl–LDH are listed in Table 6.3; this LDH seems to be non-toxic to
macrophages, DCs, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and red blood
cells at the levels used normally.
LDHs are readily degradable in an acidic environment such as the endo-
some, lysosome, or tumour microenvironment.206 Results described in pre-
vious reports indicated that MgAl–LDH was quickly dissolved in a pH 4.5
acetic buﬀer within 2 min,46,81 which helps minimise any safety risks from

long-term accumulation in the body.207 At the cellular level, LDH degradation
usually occurs in the acidic endosome, releasing biocompatible metabolites
(e.g. Mg21, Cl, or NO3
). These species can be easily pumped out of the cell
by ionic channels and then cleared from the bloodstream via the kidney.
LDH degradation in vivo takes longer than might be expected from
in vitro experiments due to the physiological environment generally being
neutral or very weakly acidic. For example, Li et al. showed that BSA-coated
25 nm LDH particles intravenously administered accumulated in the tu-
mour tissue, with a maximum concentration at 24 h post injection. After
this, the LDHs were gradually degraded and almost completely eliminated
from the tumour after another 48 h.208 Vaccines are usually injected under
the skin or into the muscle, which usually has a higher pH (7.2 to 7.4).
Thus, degradation of an LDH adjuvant is mainly dependent on cellular
uptake. Chen et al.44 demonstrated that an injected LDH–antigen depot
was almost fully degraded over two months. A similar alum formulation

existed at the injection site for a longer time (Figure 6.21a and b), and the
depot size was not reduced after 20 days. Recently, Zhang et al.47 observed
that aggregated LDH particles formulated in a vaccine stayed at the depot
for 1–2 months, while a well dispersed LDH formulation shortened the
degradation time to only one week. Antigens released from subcutaneously
injected LDH particles were found in the liver and kidney (Figure 6.21c).
This observation indicates that LDH vaccines injected subcutaneously
could enter the systemic circulation, allowing them to be captured by
immune cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, or cleared by the liver and
kidney.
Subcutaneous injection is the most common vaccine administration route,
and a number of studies have demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of

LDH particles does not cause obvious inflammation at a low dosage
(2.5–5 mgkg1). Chen et al.43 investigated the potential for tissue damage
(considering the injection site, spleen, lymph node, kidney, and liver) in mice
vaccinated subcutaneously with LDH-based vaccines. Their results indicated
that there were no discernible morphological changes in these tissues after
injection of LDH. The LDH–vaccine depot gradually degraded over 2 months,
while an analogous alum–vaccine depot existed for more than 4 months. More
immune cells infiltrated into the LDH depot than into the alum one, and most
of these cells were alive in the LDH depot while nearly half were dead with
alum. These data indicate that it is the depot structure and composition of the
adjuvant that determines local inflammation.44,46
Other vaccine administration routes, such as intraperitoneal and intra-
venous injection, are also widely used. Kwak et al. reported that LDH in-
jected into rats by these routes was also safe, with neither weight loss nor
significant changes in haematological and clinical chemistry parameters
and only slight inflammation.209 Similar results have been found in mice.48
After intraperitoneal injection of MgAl–LDH into Balb/c mice at high doses
(600 mg kg1), LDH particles with relatively large sizes (350 nm) did not
result in any obvious tissue damage or inflammation. However, smaller LDH
(50 and 100 nm) particles caused distinct morphological and histopatho-
logical changes in the lung.210 These observations reveal that the choice of
the LDH dose and particle size needs to be carefully considered.
6.6.2
CaC, CaP, and MSN
Results described in many reports have indicated that inorganic adjuvants,
such CaCs, CaPs, and MSNs, are highly biocompatible and safe for vac-
cination. Similarly to LDHs, CaCs, and CaPs are easily biodegraded in the
acid environment and the released Ca21 is an essential element.109 The
degradation of MSNs also results in the release of an essential element (Si).
MSNs are gradually degraded under physiological conditions via hydrolysis
of siloxane bonds, and as a result the degradation process is highly
dependent on their structure and surface properties. MCM-41 type MSNs
with

pores
were
rapidly

in

fluid
(Figure 6.22a).211 Yamada et al.212 further found that the surface area and
colloidal stability of MSNs are more significant than size in influencing
their degradation behaviour. MSRs with a higher aspect ratio (4–5) dis-
played slower degradation rates than shorter ones (aspect ratio 1–2), and
serum was found to accelerate their degradation (Figure 6.22b and c).213,214
When SBA-15 MSRs were injected subcutaneously into mice (500 mg kg1),
the materials were fully degraded approximately one month following
injection (Figure 6.22d).215
Results from previous studies have shown that 225 nm MCM-41 type
MSNs were mainly distributed in the liver, spleen, and kidney 24 h after
intravenous injection (5 mg kg1), and had almost disappeared from the
main organs after 7 days. Most MSNs were excreted from the body without

severe tissue damage.216 Smaller MCM-41 particles (50–100 nm) adminis-
tered similarly (16 mg kg1) were enriched in the intestines and then in the
liver and the lung after 3 h (Figure 6.22e).217 Two studies independently
investigated the in vivo biodistribution and urinary excretion of PEGylated
MSNs with diﬀerent particle sizes and spherical218 and rod-shaped219
morphologies. In both studies, intravenously administrated MSNs (20 mg
kg1) were mainly accumulated in the liver, spleen, and lung, with no
severe systemic damage noted. PEGylation increased the circulation time
and slowed excretion.
Smaller MSRs (185 nm) showed more rapid clearance compared with
larger (720 nm) MSNs. When hollow MSNs with a similar size range
(150–200 nm) were injected subcutaneously they were found to be covered by
a lipid bilayer in the groin lymph node and to transit to organs including the
heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney via the bloodstream (Figure 6.22f).220 In
contrast, the smallest (80 nm) spherical MSNs displayed slowest excretion
rates compared with larger ones (120, 200, and 360 nm) (Figure 6.22g).
6.6.3
Other Inorganic Adjuvants
Other inorganic adjuvants, such as GO, have been investigated for
immunotherapy, but current evidence indicates that GO can elicit many
adverse eﬀects, including haemolysis, cell apoptosis, DNA damage, reactive
oxygen species formation, thrombus formation, and pathological damage
to the lung and liver.221 GO modified with polymers, proteins, and small
molecules has shown improved biocompatibility and reduced toxicity,222–224
but more work is required to fully understand its biosafety.
It is also worth noting that results published in some very recent reports
have indicated that some inorganic nanoparticles, such as TiO2, Au, Ag,
and GO, promote cancer metastasis after daily intravaneous injection at
10 mg kg1. These nanoparticles are normally very small (o10–20 nm) and
non-degradable. After intravenous injection, they persist in the body for a
long period of time and are found to destroy endothelial cell junctions and
cause local inflammation, activating metastatic factors and accelerating
the occurrence of metastasis.225–227 Thus, the dose and administation route
of non-biodegradable inorganic nanoparticles must be considered very
carefully before their use as adjuvants.
6.7
Summary and Future Directions
This chapter has summarised the development of some inorganic materials
as vaccine adjuvants, describing their applications for the prevention of
infections and treatment of cancers. Inorganic materials have great potential
here, and are able to stimulate immune responses more potent than those
induced by the current commercial adjuvants. They can also be used to
direct the type of immune responses inculcated via variation of the chemical
composition, particle size, particle shape, dispersity, and combination with
Inorganic Nanomaterials in Vaccines
349

bio-adjuvants. The history of research into inorganic adjuvants is very short,
however, and more investigations are required to collect suﬃcient evidence
to confirm that these materials are safe and eﬀective in clinical applications.
Future work should consider systematic in vivo safety evaluations, and de-
velopment of multifunctional synergistic adjuvants. Scientists should also
seek to establish the required clinical and industry standards for inorganic
adjuvants and understand the underlying mechanisms of action in terms of
the interactions between nanoparticles and the immune system.
6.7.1
Systematic Evaluation of Biosafety
Currently, there are still limited ex vivo and in vivo data demonstrating the
biocompatibility and toxicity of inorganic adjuvants. In addition to classical
clinical safety evaluation, the licensing authorities recommend that a novel
adjuvant should be evaluated in non-clinical toxicology studies. This evalu-
ation consists of three tiers: non-clinical toxicology, adjuvant mode-of-action
investigations, and clinical safety assessment in controlled clinical trials and
post-marketing surveillance.228
6.7.2
Development of Synergistic Adjuvants
As discussed in Section 6.1.1, many PAMPs are associated with DCs and can be
applied as novel IMs to help enhance humoral and/or cellular immune
responses. Most of these IMs are in the form of oligonucleotides, proteins and
peptides, or lipopolysaccharides, and can be readily combined with an in-
organic material to form synergistic adjuvants. For example, previous results
have indicated that the combination of LDH and TLR9 agonists significantly
promoted cellular immune responses and switched immune responses from
TH2 to TH1.18 Thus, developing multifunctional synergistic adjuvants that
combine delivery-type adjuvants with one or more bio-adjuvants (IMs) may
significantly enhance the strength of immunity, providing novel adjuvant
combinations to formulate vaccines against infections or cancers.
6.7.3
Establishment of Adjuvant Standards
The flexible chemical composition and physical properties of inorganic
adjuvants enable them to have a wide range of biomedical applications.
However, as vaccine delivery-type adjuvants, strict quality standards are
currently lacking. Factors to consider include the chemical composition or
ratio, size, shape, dispersity, surface modification, antigen:adjuvant ratio,
dosage, and injection route.
