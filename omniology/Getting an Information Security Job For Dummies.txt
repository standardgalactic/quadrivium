Introduction
T
 
he information security (InfoSec) profession got its start decades ago, 
but it consisted of few people, mostly in military and other secret orga-
nizations. With the appearance of the Internet in the 1990s, organizations 
started to put information online, and the InfoSec profession became a little 
more popular. Fast‐forward to the mid 2010s, with its big security breaches 
as well as new laws and regulations, and information security is one of the 
hottest professions around the world.
About This Book
There are more than enough books on information security, but far too few 
professionals to do the work. Until now, there was no clear guide to getting 
into the profession. Delivered in the same rich tradition of the Dummies 
series, Getting an Information Security Job For Dummies is that clear guide on 
planning your entry in information security, no matter where you are in your 
career today:
✓
✓If you’re a student or recent graduate, you’ll get real‐life information on 
what it’s like in the information security profession.
✓
✓If you’re an experienced IT professional, you’ll understand how to 
make a lateral move into information security.
✓
✓If you’re already getting your start in information security, you can 
chart your career path and decide what kind of an organization you may 
want to work in.
✓
✓If you’re in the information security job market, you’ll understand differ-
ent types of information security jobs in different types of organizations.
✓
✓If you need to hire an information security professional, you’ll find lots 
of information to help you focus on what kind of candidate you need and 
to better understand the people who are applying for your positions.
No matter why you’re reading this book, you can use it as a security career 
reference. Getting an Information Security Job For Dummies is full of insight 
from real information security professionals, in their own voices. You’ll begin 
to understand what the InfoSec profession is really like from professionals 
who have been going at it for years.

Foolish Assumptions
While writing this book, I’ve made some assumptions about you:
✓
✓You are curious about technology and how things work. Even if you’re 
looking to get into the compliance or controls aspect of information 
security, it’s still important to have a healthy appreciation for how tech-
nology supports an organization.
✓
✓You dislike malware and the criminal organizations that create them. 
Even if you don’t yet understand how cybercriminals work, your con-
science tells you that what they are doing is wrong, and you want to 
learn how to help organizations better defend themselves.
✓
✓You enjoy learning. My first clue: You are reading this book! Being in 
information security — or any branch of information technology — 
demands continuous learning. Security issues and technology itself 
change quite rapidly, and continuous learning is needed just to keep up!
✓
✓You like Dr. Who and his problem‐solving capabilities, even if some of 
the scenarios he finds himself in are a little odd.
How am I doing so far? If all of my assumptions are right, you may be InfoSec 
material and ready to seriously consider a career in information security.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you’ll see icons in the left margin that call attention to 
information that’s worth noting. No smiley faces winking at you or any other 
cute little emoticons, but you’ll definitely want to take note! Here’s what to 
look for and what to expect.
Throughout the book, you’ll find stories and tips from information security 
professionals, in their own voices.
This icon identifies general information and core concepts that are well 
worth committing to your nonvolatile memory, your gray matter, or your 
noggin’ — along with anniversaries, birthdays, and other important stuff!
Thank you for reading; we hope you enjoy the book; please take care of your 
writers! Seriously, this icon includes helpful suggestions and tidbits of useful 
information that may save you some time and headaches.

required in information security, start with Part II. If you’re wondering what

If you’re ready to get out there in the InfoSec job market, go right to Part IV.

ccording to the Cisco 2014 Annual Security Report, the worldwide short-
age of information security professionals exceeds one million workers. 
You have chosen a great time to learn more about this exciting and rapidly 
changing field!
This chapter takes a closer look at the changes in business and technology 
that have given rise to the high demand for information security workers. 
You also discover why information security is a great career field.
Why Does Information Security Matter?
Information security, or InfoSec, was once considered a technical discipline 
with little business relevance. Now, however, it is a topic of heated discus-
sions in corporate boardrooms around the world. Information security mat-
ters because information technology matters — and because criminals are 
finding it easy to steal sensitive and private information from organizations’ 
information systems.
Increased reliance on information systems
Organizations of every kind, as well as a growing number of private citizens, 
rely on information systems for conducting daily affairs more than ever 
before. We buy more and more Internet‐connected products, partly for

­convenience and partly for the cool factor. Before long, it will be easier to 
count the things that aren’t connected to the Internet.
You might have heard that data and information are the new currency. 
Although this statement might sound like a cliche, it’s true for several reasons:
✓
✓Organizations can use software tools to examine electronic business 
records and gain valuable insights that help them find new opportunities. 
For instance, a grocery store can add new items to its inventory based on 
sales trends.
✓
✓Organizations can use information systems to make business processes 
more efficient. For example, if an organization puts sales details in an 
information system, the customer service department could electroni-
cally access those records and be far more efficient.
✓
✓For banks and other financial institutions, data actually is money, or 
at least the closest representation of money. For instance, transferring 
funds or paying bills online is mostly about making a number bigger in 
one place and smaller in another.
This increased reliance on Internet‐connected systems and devices makes 
our businesses more efficient and our lives easier, but there is a dark side: 
Criminals are also turning to Internet‐connected systems to disrupt busi-
nesses and steal valuable information.
Growth in cybercrime
Organizations of every kind are increasing their reliance on information 
­systems for storing and processing valuable information. Meanwhile, cyber-
criminal organizations have grown, organized, and made vast improvements 
in the skills and tools they use to find and steal this information.
“Last year was the first year that proceeds from cybercrime were greater 
than proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs, and that was, I believe, over 
$105 billion,” according to Valerie McNiven, who advises the U.S. Treasury 
on cybercrime. “Cybercrime is moving at such a high speed that law enforce-
ment cannot catch up with it.” Ms. McNiven made this claim in 2005; in the 
past ten years, cybercriminal organizations have made impressive gains in 
their capability to steal valuable data.
According to idtheftcenter.org, some of the largest security breaches in 2014 
were as follows:
✓
✓Sony Pictures: 33 thousand documents and several unreleased films
✓
✓U.S. Weather System: breach to NOAA weather satellite network

Although 2014 was not an encouraging year in information security, it is for 
businesses whose mission is the protection of critical information.
So many security breaches are occurring that several websites are devoted 
to listing them, including
✓
✓www.privacyrights.org
✓
✓www.idtheftcenter.org

Improved defenses
This scourge of break‐ins and breaches does not mean that governments 
and industries are going to turn tail and stop their expansion of information 
systems. Instead, organizations of every size and type are hiring security pro-
fessionals to improve security measures that protect their systems. Security 
professionals are doing the following to protect critical data:
✓
✓Hardening systems and applications to make them more difficult to attack
✓
✓Adding layers of defense

A Brief History of Cybercrime
As far back as recorded history goes, we know that whenever one party 
­collects or creates anything of wealth, another party will do his or her best to 
steal or spoil the owner’s wealth. It makes sense, then, that as individuals and 
organizations use information systems to create, store, or spend wealth, others 
will do whatever they can to take the wealth for themselves. As individuals 
and organizations become increasingly reliant on information systems, more 
valuable information is created. So news of security breaches in which these 
information hordes are stolen or vandalized should not come as a surprise.
It helps to wind the clock back a few years to see how security breaches all 
came about. Although the first security incidents weren’t so much about 
stealing money, they provided the foundation for later incidents in which 
monetary theft was the object.
The history of cybercrime can be thought of as two different related trends 
on a collision course:
✓
✓Improvements in malware potency
✓
✓Increased use of computers, networks, and the Internet to manage and 
control just about everything
These trends have gradually moved toward each other, each gaining momen-
tum. If you’re imagining two locomotives barreling toward each other, that’s 
not quite the right image. The collision of malware potency and increased com-
puter dependence has been slower — like cold air from the north colliding with 
warm air from the south, wreaking unpredictable havoc in multiple locations.
Malware
Malware is a general term that encompasses many kinds of harmful programs 
or program fragments such as viruses, Trojan horses, worms, and bots (for a 
more detailed description of malware, see Chapter 3). Early forms of malware 

11

 Chapter 1: Securing Your Future in Information Security
were simple, almost like experiments developed by computer hobbyists who 
thought, “I wonder what will happen if I build a piece of computer code that 
does this?”
These early versions of malware were crude and performed simple functions, 
such as displaying something on the computer screen or deleting files. The 
creators of malware made no attempt to hide themselves, because there was 
nothing to hide from.
Fast‐forward to today, when malware has become so potent and stealthy that 
your life can become miserable if you depend on computers and networks.
Break‐ins and breaches
Malware is not the only tool in an attacker’s toolbox. Just as a lock‐picking 
set is only one way to break into a building, other techniques are frequently 
used to break into computer systems, such as computer break‐ins and 
breaches. Some of the techniques used include social engineering, phish-
ing, and watering hole attacks. These attacks are occurring more often than 
before for a variety of reasons:
✓
✓More companies using information systems
✓
✓More companies are building interconnections
✓
✓Higher value information being stored on information systems
✓
✓Growing shortage of personnel who know how to implement good  
security
✓
✓Cybercriminal organizations building better intrusion tools
✓
✓Profitable cooperation among cybercriminal organizations
We are living in a perfect storm, where more companies are storing high‐
value information that they don’t know how to protect from criminal organi-
zations that are getting better at finding and stealing it. The situation is truly 
becoming dire, and we could use more help!
One of the biggest problems in computer security today is social engineering, 
which is any of several techniques of deception designed to take over com-
puters or obtain sensitive information. When organizations do a good job of 
protecting their computers and networks, intruders turn to hacking people 
instead — too often with great success.

Fraud
Another form of cybercrime is online fraud. The definitions of fraud, accord-
ing to Wiktionary, are
✓
✓Any act of deception carried out for the purpose of unfair, undeserved 
and/or unlawful gain.
✓
✓The assumption of a false identity to such deceptive end.
✓
✓A person who performs any such trick.
Fraud has been a problem since the beginning of history. And today, fraud 
has found a cozy home in the world of information systems and the Internet.
The most prevalent form of fraud is the phishing scheme, in which an 
adversary creates some ruse, identifies potential victims, and attempts  
to trick them into doing something they should not do. Here are some  
examples of email or other communications that the potential victim  
might receive:
✓
✓Bank: Your funds are low, or are being locked because of suspected 
fraud (this one’s really ironic).
✓
✓Taxes: You owe taxes to the government and will be in trouble unless 
you pay right now.
✓
✓Law enforcement: You have overdue fines or there’s a warrant for your 
arrest.
✓
✓Sweepstakes: You’re the winner of a sweepstakes and must provide 
financial information to claim your prize.
✓
✓Inheritance: You have inherited money, and the organization that holds 
your funds needs help so that they can transfer your newfound wealth 
to you.
✓
✓Friend in need: A friend of yours is in trouble with law enforcement and 
needs you to send money to get out of jail.
✓
✓Email account: You need to confirm your identity and increase your 
storage to continue using your email account.
In these and virtually all others ruses, you think that you’ve been directed to 
the organization’s website for the purpose stated, but you are actually sent 
to an imposter site. There, you might fill in your login credentials, which the 
fraudsters use to gain access to the real site and carry out their scheme, such 
as stealing your money or taking over your email account. Or the imposter 

13

 Chapter 1: Securing Your Future in Information Security
site has a form that requests a credit card number, a bank account number, 
or other sensitive information that the fraudster can use to separate you from 
your money.
Today’s online fraud schemes are nothing more than modern‐day confidence 
tricks designed to convince you to trust an unknown party and then provide 
them with sensitive information.
Knowing Your Adversaries
Many technologists think that an information security program is all about 
technology: That technology is the root of the problem and technology will 
solve those problems. If this describes you, I appeal to you to open your mind 
to other ways of thinking about information security. Even if the aspect of 
information security that fascinates you the most is technology (and we need 
a lot more people like you), understanding the people behind technology‐
related issues can be helpful.
Information security involves a lot of technology but is at its root a people 
issue. Information security professionals are responsible for protecting 
assets against people: careless insiders, malicious outsiders, and many in 
between. Our vocabulary includes a lot of terms for things, including the dif-
ferent sorts of actors and their unique behaviors that we all eschew.  
I describe them in this section.
Hobbyists and enthusiasts
Because the term hacker has been maligned in recent years, I prefer to use 
the term computer hobbyist to describe computer enthusiasts who love to 
explore computers to understand more about how they work. Hackers, hob-
byists, and enthusiasts — let’s agree that they’re all about the same.
Hobbyists are curious, peaceful folk who love technology, love to figure out 
how things work, and love to improve their electronic gadgets. Hobbyists and 
inventors are similar. Both enjoy making things better for themselves and 
others by taking things apart (logically or literally) to see how they work, and 
then modifying them to make them better. The world is full of people who 
like to tinker with their cars, motorcycles, radios, and computers. Think of 
early computer overclockers or musicians whose amps go up to 11.
Hobbyists with good judgment and discipline are our friends.

Script kiddies
A deservedly maligned bunch, script kiddies are teenage troublemakers with 
too much time on their hands who use tools created by others to attack com-
puters and networks. Typical script kiddies have little or no understanding of 
the inner workings of the tools they use.
Early in my career, script kiddies were typically the most significant problem 
for us — there were a lot of them and the tools they used could cause quite 
a bit of damage. But in retrospect, they were like gnats that swarmed around 
our faces, irritating and bothersome but usually not very harmful.
Like a lot of technologists, some script kiddies start as novices but build their 
knowledge and skills. They improve the tools they use and, eventually, write 
hacking tools of their own.
Hacktivists
Hackivist is a blend of the words hacker and activist (think Greenpeace or 
PETA). Hacktivists are generally known for disrupting computers and net-
works belonging to organizations and governments with whom they disagree 
politically or ideologically.
It’s a big crowded world, and the Internet is a never‐ending fount of informa-
tion about every sort of organization. For every organization, you’ll likely find 
people who oppose what the organization does or stands for.
The fall of hackerdom
Before most people in the world were even 
born, the term hacker was generally a positive 
one. A hacker was a hobbyist who was curi-
ous about how electronic-ish things worked 
and would implement customizations to 
improve or enhance their performance. In the 
early days of computers, a computer hacker 
was one who sought to understand how 
computers worked and to employ changes to 
improve them.
Then as now, some hackers would explore 
computer systems — still seeking how they 
worked and ways of making modifications — 
but for malicious purposes.
The term hacker as a benevolent hobbyist has 
fallen into disuse and the dominant meaning of 
the term is a malicious person. And good hack-
ers are generally known as computer hobbyists 
so they can distance themselves from the others.

15

 Chapter 1: Securing Your Future in Information Security
Some noteworthy examples of hacktivist activities follow:
✓
✓PGP (pretty good privacy): A popular email encryption program, 
PGP was thought to be released in response to a U.S. Senate bill that 
demanded government access to the plain text contents of voice, data, 
and other communications.
✓
✓Website mirroring: When an organization or a government blocks 
access to a particular website, a hacktivist will mirror (copy) the con-
tents of the blocked site to another site, so that its contents can remain 
available.
✓
✓Wikileaks: This website publishes leaked industry and government 
documents.
Corporate spies
Companies spying on each other to obtain commercial secrets is nothing 
new. However, the migration of paper records to computers and the Internet 
has provided new opportunities and methods for companies to spy on each 
other. The Internet provides the means for spies to discover target systems 
and to steal their data for further analysis and exploitation.
The future is bright for information security jobs
There is a critical worldwide shortage of 
workers with information security skills. For 
the most part, these jobs pay well, with pretty 
good working conditions and a good standard 
of living.
In January 2014, the Ponemon Institute con-
ducted a survey of information security man-
agers and developed several key findings, 
including:
✓	70 percent of respondents said that they 
don’t have enough IT security staff.
✓	58 percent of senior security staff positions 
and 36 percent of staff security positions 
went unfilled in 2013.
In 2014, Burning Glass Technologies market 
overview on information security jobs cited 
that job listings in cybersecurity have grown 
by 74 percent from 2007–2013, more than twice 
the growth rate for IT jobs overall.
Unlike the dot com bubble in the late 1990s, 
the growth rate in information security jobs is 
not a flash in the pan but a response to painful 
advances by cybercriminal organizations as 
well as increasing regulation on information 
security and privacy. Short of a miraculous 
discovery in data protection that cybercriminal 
organizations are unable to overcome (yeah, 
right!), the demand for information security 
jobs should remain strong for many years.

Malicious insiders
Take good care of your employees and they’ll take good care of you. 
However, companies that don’t treat employees so nicely sometimes pay a 
heavy price. Employees who are bored, angry, unhappy, or who think that 
they will soon be fired or laid off often use revenge to settle the score.
Now and then, we hear a tale in which an employee who believed that his 
or her job was about to end decided to exact revenge on the employer. The 
popular cult movie Office Space explores this theme in detail.
Careless insiders
A careless insider is a legitimate user in an organization but, well, careless. 
Perhaps the person lacks judgment, or is working too fast, or needs training, 
or is not paying attention.
Careless insiders can be especially damaging to an organization because they 
possess what intruders lack: issued login credentials.
Fraudsters
Fraudster is a broad label that includes people who deceive and steal. How 
they deceive and what they steal varies, but invariably they perform some 
kind of a trick to steal money.
Typical fraud cases in the broad category of cybercrime include the following:
✓
✓Credit card fraud: Fraudsters steal credit card numbers and use them to 
buy stuff they want. You might still get the frequent flyer miles or other 
rewards, but you’re out the money, and that hurts.
✓
✓Wire fraud: Fraudsters employ malware that steals login credentials, 
and target a company with lots of money in the bank, in hopes that they 
can capture online banking and online wire transfer login codes. If they 
do, that giant sucking sound is the organization’s money being trans-
ferred to an offshore account.
✓
✓Identity theft: These actors use a variety of ways to obtain enough per-
sonal information about people to permit the opening of credit cards 
and lines of credit in the name of the victim. (By the way, they aren’t 
actually stealing your identity; they’re borrowing it.)

 Chapter 1: Securing Your Future in Information Security
Organized crime
Organized crime used to be known for sex and drug trafficking, illegal gam-
bling, and protection rackets. Today, however, organized crime makes more 
money perpetrating online fraud and other Internet‐based schemes. These 
organizations are in all corners of the world, but particularly in Eastern 
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
The sophistication of a lot of today’s malware points to organizations with 
large, formal research and development budgets. Most of the easy hacks 
have been written; now more work (and bigger organizations) and better 
planning are required to build the tools necessary to break into systems  
and networks.
Rogue nation‐states
The governments of several countries understand that state sponsorship is 
one way to develop malware and other techniques to break into networks 
and steal valuable information.
Nation‐states sponsor cybercriminal activities for a number of reasons,  
such as to
✓
✓Steal political secrets
✓
✓Steal military secrets
✓
✓Aid local industries through industrial espionage
✓
✓Conduct industrial or military sabotage
If this sounds like traditional espionage — you’re right! Today’s spies have 
moved into cyberspace to do their work. If the information they want is 
online, many will use online means to try and steal it.

Organizations Hiring InfoSec 
Professionals
These days it might be easier to ask, what types of organizations don’t hire 
information security professionals? Every organization that uses computers 
and networks must employ people with security skills and knowledge. With 
the frequency of malware attacks, even a one‐person IT department must be 
knowledgeable about basic security skills.
The following types of technology activities beg for security skills:
✓
✓Providing secure Internet connections
✓
✓Managing login credentials and access known as Identity Access 
Management
✓
✓Allowing secure remote access for valid users
✓
✓Providing supplier, partner, or customer access via Virtual Private 
Networks
✓
✓Maintaining secure email servers
✓
✓Managing and protecting the information on file servers
✓
✓Managing laptop computers for a mobile workforce
Cyberwarfare rules of engagement
If you’re on the side of the white hats, cyber-
warfare is not a lot of fun. If it seems like 
adversaries have the upper hand, it’s because 
adversaries have the upper hand.
Cyberware is said to be asymmetric. In other 
words, a single individual can wield the same 
amount of attack effectiveness as the larg-
est country in the world. With the right tools,  
an individual can cripple a large military  
organization.
The following lists some rules of engagement 
for attackers and defenders:
✓	Defenders must protect against all types of 
attacks, whereas an attacker can attack in 
any manner desired.
✓	Defenders must protect all systems against 
attack, whereas an attacker can attack any 
system of choice.
✓	Defenders must protect systems at all hours 
of the day and night, whereas an attacker 
can attack at a time of his or her choosing.
✓	Defenders must conform to policies and 
obey all applicable laws, whereas an 
attacker can break any law at any time.

 Chapter 1: Securing Your Future in Information Security
✓
✓Creating secure in‐house written software
✓
✓Maintaining enterprise application access with user accounts
When an organization has one or more of the preceding in its technology 
environment, the organization’s IT department had better have one or more 
of its IT people with some security skills. Otherwise, a lot is going to go 
wrong. I present the preceding list again, only this time I’ve added the conse-
quences of poor security:
✓
✓Internet connection: Attacks from the Internet; malware from watering 
hole attacks.
✓
✓Login credentials: Attackers who stop at nothing to guess login creden-
tials, including the use of automated tools that can perform brute‐force 
attacks, in which thousands of different passwords per hour are guessed 
until the right one is found. Then it’s “game over”!
✓
✓Remote access: Brute‐force attacks against user accounts, eventually 
leading to successful break‐ins.
✓
✓Supplier, partner, or customer access: Attacks from supplier, partner, 
or customer organizations. Misuse and abuse by personnel with poor 
judgment in those organizations.
✓
✓Email server: Incoming spam, malware, and phishing attacks.
✓
✓File server: Access management issues, data loss through lax access 
permissions; malware hosted on file server.
✓
✓Laptop computers: Stolen laptop computers with loss of data stored on 
them; attempts to break into organizations based on login information 
stored on stolen laptops.
✓
✓In‐house written software: Exploitable vulnerabilities leading to data 
loss.
✓
✓Enterprise applications: Access management issues, people with exces-
sive access privileges, terminated employees with still‐active user 
accounts.
Now, look at the list one last time, to see what technology and security pro-
fessionals need to do to protect systems and data:
✓
✓Internet connection: Network engineers need to understand how to  
make edge devices (the routers, firewalls, and other devices at an  
organization’s outer boundary) resistant to attack. They also need to 
be able to install and manage firewalls and other protective devices 
with their complex rulesets to let the good guys in and keep the bad 
guys out, and to prevent malicious software from getting into the  
organization.

20
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
✓
✓Login credentials: User IDs, passwords, and security tokens are issued 
only to authorized personnel. In larger organizations, automated tools 
are used to reduce errors and watch for problems. Many systems can be 
configured to prevent brute‐force attacks.
✓
✓Remote access: Some personnel must have access to an organization’s 
internal network from any location. A remote access system must be 
built correctly so that only authorized personnel can get in.
✓
✓Supplier, partner, or customer access: Most organizations rely on 
other organizations for supplies, personnel, or services. In many such 
cases, people in those external organizations need access to internal 
resources. Every aspect of this process must be done right to prevent 
cybercriminals from exploiting external access and stealing data.
✓
✓Email server: Because email servers are connected to the Internet, sys-
tems engineers need to know how to correctly configure and “harden” 
email servers to prevent intruders from compromising the organiza-
tion’s email communications.
✓
✓File server: Internal and external file servers must be correctly config-
ured and managed to protect all sensitive information stored on them 
and to prevent intruders from being able to access sensitive data.
✓
✓Laptop computers: Personnel who build and manage laptop computers 
(as well as tablets and other cool devices that we all want) must include 
the latest measures, such as whole‐disk encryption and advanced mal-
ware prevention tools, to prevent the compromise of data stolen on 
laptops, as well as to protect the systems that laptops are permitted to 
connect to.
✓
✓In‐house written software: Software developers need to understand 
how to write software that will be resistant to attacks such as buffer 
overflow, script injection, and authentication bypass.
✓
✓Enterprise application with user accounts: Personnel who manage user 
accounts for enterprise applications need to keep accurate records and 
use detailed procedures to make sure that no unauthorized personnel 
are given user accounts. Also, applications must be configured to track 
all user logins, and create alerts if any user accounts are under attack.
As you can see from this list, which is but a sampling of all the aspects that 
require security expertise in an organization, a wide set of skills is required 
for all IT workers, including specialized security personnel.

hat is it like to have a security job?
Many people obtain security jobs after they’ve been in IT for a number of 
years. In many cases, the ability to get a security job is a matter of opportu-
nity — being in the right place at the right time. However, a lot more than 
good luck is required; you need the desire and the aptitude for a security job.
Most people accumulated IT job experience and then move laterally into a 
security job. Others get a degree in computer science, management infor-
mation systems, or information security and then get an entry-level InfoSec 
­position. This chapter describes both job-hunting methods and also details 
the most common security jobs, from security analyst to CISO.
Getting Security Experience  
Where You Are Now
Workers early in their careers have the following complaint:
✓
✓I want to get this new job, but it requires experience. How can I get 
­experience if I don’t have this job?
Chapter 2

Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
Sounds like a chicken-or-egg problem, right? Not necessarily. Most security 
professionals didn’t have a non-security-related job one day and a ­security 
job the next. Instead, they gained and built upon security skills in their 
­current IT job.
In this section, you explore the following IT roles and discover how to build 
your information security knowledge and skills while in those roles:
✓
✓Service desk analyst
✓
✓Network administrator
✓
✓Systems administrator
✓
✓Database administrator
✓
✓Software developer
✓
✓Project manager
✓
✓Business analyst
✓
✓IT manager
✓
✓Human resources employee
All IT positions contain security-related skills and responsibilities. Everyone 
in IT should be aware of the security-related aspects of their jobs. IT workers 
are entrusted with a high level of privilege: they have access to sensitive data 
and the systems that control it.
Service desk analyst
A service desk analyst assists users how have problems with their computers, 
user accounts, or business applications. In some companies this position is 
the equivalent of a help desk technician or a PC fix-it dude (or dudette).
In many ways, service desk analysts have one of the most important non-
security positions because they are in contact with users in all levels of the 
organization. For many employees, service desk analysts are the only IT 
people they will ever contact.
A service desk person must be able to recognize several types of security 
issues, such as the following:
✓
✓Forgotten passwords
✓
✓Requests to install software

23

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
✓
✓Phishing messages
✓
✓Unsafe practices, such as sharing passwords or visiting malicious web 
sites
Network administrator
The network administrator title can mean different things in different organiza-
tions. This role often includes the administration of the following:
✓
✓User accounts
✓
✓File server access
✓
✓Remote access
Network administrators are on the front lines of access control, and effective 
access control practices reduce the likelihood of a number of security-related 
problems, such as active user accounts for terminated personnel, granting 
excessive privileges, group accounts, and user accounts with non-expiring or 
non-complex passwords.
Systems administrator
A systems administrator (also called a systems engineer) configures and main-
tains server operating systems and, in some organizations, desktop operating 
systems.
A systems administrator — often shortened to sysadmin or SA — is ­usually 
responsible for all security-related configurations in operating systems, 
including the all-important system hardening, which is the practice of 
­configuring a system to make it more resistant to attack.
A sysadmin may also manage user accounts, machine by machine or in a 
­central directory such as Microsoft Active Directory or LDAP (lightweight 
directory access protocol). A sysadmin can learn and apply many security-
related principles regarding user account management, such as the following:
✓
✓High-quality passwords: Systems should require long, complex pass-
words with reasonably short expirations (I suggest 90 days for users and 
30 for administrators).
✓
✓No shared user accounts: SAs are usually close to their users, and as 
such should watch for various forms of abuse, including shared user 
accounts. That’s bad juju, as I like to say.

24
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
✓
✓Accounts with least privilege: Users should have no higher privilege 
level than is required to accomplish their duties. If you give an ordinary 
user the local administrator privilege, you will be begging for security-
related problems.
Database administrator
A database administrator, or DBA, is responsible for the care and feeding of 
databases that reside on servers as well as external storage systems.
A database management system is a sizeable piece of software in its own 
right, often with myriad configuration settings and its own user accounts and 
related settings. Like the system administrator, the database administrator 
must follow sound principles with regards to system hardening as well as 
user account management. Further, the DBA also controls access permis-
sions to databases and their components.
Software developer
A software developer (also referred to as programmer, software development 
engineer, or programmer-analyst) develops systems software, application 
software, tools and utilities, and system interfaces. Some have a creative, free 
spirit and down-with-rules attitude that gives the whole lot a reputation for 
not wanting to work with security people.
Software development involves several significant security-related activities 
and aspects, including the following:
✓
✓Secure coding: Developers without training in secure coding are likely 
to introduce vulnerabilities such as buffer overflow and cross-site 
request forgery in their programs. Depending on the languages and tools 
they are using, developers will need to have a varying level of training 
and awareness, so that their programs will be free of security defects.
✓
✓Security testing: Developers often test the programs they write and 
maintain. Depending on the languages and tools they use, developers 
will need to perform security testing in addition to any functionality 
­testing to ensure that their software is free of security-related defects.
✓
✓Code reviews: Developers should be checking each other’s work, 
­looking for security flaws that could permit their software to be 
­compromised by an attacker.

Project manager
Have you seen those sleek racing rowboats, with the person in front shout-
ing, “Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!” to keep the rowers in sync? Similarly, project 
managers keep a project going in the same direction and at the right pace to 
ensure that it is completed correctly and on time.
My security career started as a developer
I was working as an engineer writing code for 
operations in a nuclear power plant. One day (in 
the early ’80s), I asked the boss how we secured 
this stuff and who was responsible for making 
sure our network and supporting computing 
systems were secure. Two days later, I got a 
call from corporate headquarters and talked to 
our CIO. I explained my concern, and that was 
the beginning of my security career. I became 
responsible for securing our corporate network 
and, from there, went on to become one of the 
first security engineers for the company.
Bruce Lobree, Seattle
My security career started in network support
Back in 1990, I was doing network support for 
a large dairy. They were having problems with 
their network and had been experiencing some 
unexpected financial reporting problems, so 
they had started to suspect fraud. The CFO 
approached me one Friday afternoon as I was 
working on the network and said something 
like, “So this system is secure, isn’t it, and can’t 
be the cause of our problems?”
Caught off-guard, I answered, “Yes, sure, it 
must be”
Driving home, I became increasingly concerned 
that I had answered without any evidence to 
back my words. This really worried me, so I 
went into the lab on the weekend and built an 
equivalent system that I proceeded to hack. I 
identified four or five issues and then devised 
controls to prevent or detect these.
On Monday, I went back into the dairy and 
applied the fixes — and explained to the CFO 
why. At the time, security was not recognized 
as a separate skill or even a job; it was just 
something good network admins did.
Without realizing it, I had become a white hat 
hacker and I moved full time into security about 
two years later!

Project managers, or PMs, keep projects running smoothly and ensure that 
all required resources are available as needed. In many cases, PMs can use 
their general knowledge of IT security to ensure that security-related activi-
ties are included in a project’s schedule and carried out by people with the 
right skills. Some of the things that PMs need to know include the following:
✓
✓Laws and regulations applicable to the organization
✓
✓Security policies that are relevant to whatever project PMs are working 
with at the time
✓
✓Client or customer security-related expectations
✓
✓Security tools used in the organization to verify software security
Business analyst
Depending on the organization, a business analyst may be a jack-of-all-trades 
or focused on one set of activities. In this book, a business analyst is the 
former. Examples of business analyst activities include
✓
✓Running reports
✓
✓Analyzing the content of reports to assist other workers in their jobs
✓
✓Conducting research tasks and projects on internal business matters
✓
✓Organizing information into usable or readable form
A business analyst can also be thought of as a technical assistant.
Like other IT workers, a business analyst must be familiar with the concepts 
of safe computer usage and prudent handling of sensitive data, so that they 
don’t unwittingly bring harm to the information by compromising sensitive 
data and systems.
Most people in security start out in another IT job, and move laterally into a 
security position.
IT manager or IT director
An IT manager (in smaller organizations, the IT manager) or IT director directs 
the work of others in the IT organization. To get security savvy and do the 
right thing security-wise for the organization, an IT manager needs to under-
stand many aspects of information security, including the following:

27

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
✓
✓Security policy: The security policy includes both the policy for general 
workers as well as IT-specific policies related to the design, implementa-
tion, and management of information systems.
✓
✓Security aspects of applicable business processes: These aspects 
include but are not limited to change management, configuration 
­management, incident management, asset management, and employee 
onboarding and offboarding.
✓
✓Leadership by example: An IT manager is watched by almost every-
one on the team, so he or she should lead by example to ensure that IT 
­staffers also toe the line on security policy, procedures, and expected 
behavior.
Human resources employee
Human resources (HR) workers play a big part in information security. They 
are the linchpin in the procedures followed when hiring and terminating 
employees. HR has many other important security-related aspects, including 
the following:
✓
✓Background checks: A background check is relatively straightforward in 
the United States but trickier in countries that restrict or ban them. Still, 
it’s important to fully understand the criminal history and ethics of an 
employment candidate.
✓
✓Discipline: HR often coordinates formal disciplinary action for all kinds 
of misbehavior, including violations of security policy. HR must under-
stand the serious nature of different information security violations so 
that appropriate disciplinary actions are taken in the event of a breach 
or misconduct.
My security career started on a committee
I got a job as an IT director for one of the depart-
ments in a large municipality. Shortly after 
arriving, I began work on their first information 
security committee. Our task was to create a 
new InfoSec policy. Eventually, we decided that 
we needed to hire a CISO for the city.
The person we hired was and is someone 
many of you would recognize, but I’ll leave 
out his name to protect the innocent (and 
guilty!). We quickly became good friends and 
respected colleagues, and when the position 
of deputy CISO was created, I applied and 
was hired.

✓
✓Job descriptions: HR usually creates and manages the job descriptions 
in an organization. Security is an essential ingredient in virtually all IT 
positions, and in many others as well.
In many organizations HR manages only full-time employees, not 
contractors, consultants, or temporary workers. As a result, access 
management processes suffer greatly. When contractors, consultants, 
or temps leave an organization, the personnel responsible for locking 
their user accounts often don’t know, creating a big security risk and a 
significant compliance issue. Organizations can get into a lot of trouble 
if they have active accounts for contractors and temps who are no 
longer active.
Getting an Entry-level Security Position
When it comes to security jobs, most companies don’t hire people without 
experience. However, with the shortage of security talent, organizations are 
becoming creative: If they can’t find a security professional to fill an open 
role, they’ll train a person for the position.
An organization hiring one or more entry-level security people will, or 
should, have security professionals with industry experience already on staff, 
so you’d be a part of a team that includes people with more experience.
Organizations offer several types of entry-level positions. Although they 
probably don’t add junior to the job title, it’s included here so you can better 
understand the role.
All IT positions require security skills
Making the transition from a non-security 
job to a security job is not as difficult as you 
might think. Many companies require relevant, 
security-related skills for almost every posi-
tion in IT.
Security is the responsibility of not just the 
security manager but also every IT worker in 
the organization. Every position in IT requires 
security skills and knowledge related to each 
particular position.

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
Junior security analyst
A junior security analyst is an assistant to a senior-level security analyst, engi-
neer, administrator, or manager. In a general sense, a junior security analyst 
is responsible for completing tasks that involve the creation or analysis of 
security-related information, such as the following:
✓
✓SOC operations: Many larger organizations have a security operations 
center, or SOC, to monitor and manage security-related tools and sys-
tems for detecting security incidents, which are relayed to the appropri-
ate personnel. A junior security analyst may be given a variety of chores 
related to operations in the SOC.
✓
✓IT audits: An IT auditor often needs an assistant to help with a variety of 
tasks, such as collecting and managing audit evidence as well as creating 
audit reports.
✓
✓Policy management: A junior security analyst might monitor the com-
pliance of security policies. For instance, a junior analyst may conduct 
clean desk reviews, observe users’ security-related behavior, or conduct 
in-person surveys and interviews.
✓
✓Risk management: A junior security analyst might manage the con-
tents of the organization’s risk register and carry out tasks regarding 
risk treatment, such as documenting risk mitigation or risk acceptance 
­artifacts.
My security career started at a detective agency
In the 1980s, my school library had a Teletype 
that students could use to run a program that 
would identify our career aptitudes. The user 
would answer 250 multiple-choice questions, 
and the program would produce three suitable 
occupations. The program always reported 
my first occupation as fur designer. I was so 
incensed by the prospect that I spent weeks 
reading ComputerWorld and IBM 360 opera-
tor manuals until I could figure out how to dial 
into the mainframe to obtain system operator 
(SYSOP) privilege and change the occupation 
results. The mainframe exposed more than 100 
time-sharing accounts serving not only many of 
the area’s school districts but dozens of manu-
facturing and banking companies.
A few years later, I had a job as a typist and 
clerk for a detective agency — and a lot of 
mainframe hacking experience poking around 
with a personally owned Teletype and modem, 
One day, I mentioned my first mainframe 
exploits to the detective agency owner. He 
jumped on the opportunity to provide remedia-
tion services to several of those companies.  
I provided the bulk of the actual work, before  
I was even a high school graduate.

✓
✓Security reporting: The tools and systems that protect an organization 
contain a lot of security-related information. A junior security analyst 
might create security metrics and reports that management uses to 
understand the effectiveness of their security systems.
Junior security administrator
A junior security administrator is a helper on a team of security administra-
tors. Some of the roles that this entry-level security administrator might 
­perform include the following:
✓
✓User account administration: In this role, you create user accounts, 
make access permission changes to existing accounts, and lock or 
remove a user account when someone leaves the organization. You 
might also create or manage roles, which are used to control access to 
data and application functions.
✓
✓Firewall administration: Administering firewalls involves the ­regular 
upkeep of their rulesets, the data that a firewall uses to determine 
whether traffic should be blocked or permitted to pass. Firewalls are 
also configured to log certain traffic, so you might also examine logs.
✓
✓Intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system 
(IPS) administration: An IDS and IPS are similar to a firewall, in that 
they ­contain rules to manage and logs to examine.
✓
✓Data loss prevention (DLP) administration: A DLP system is used to 
detect (and, possibly, block) sensitive data being transmitted out of an 
organization’s network. A DLP system requires a lot of tuning so that 
routine business operations are not affected. The junior security admin-
istrator makes these adjustments, as well as examines logs and takes 
appropriate action.
✓
✓Antimalware administration: Organizations small and large need anti-
malware to keep computer viruses, Trojan horses, and worms out of the 
network. Larger organizations may accomplish these tasks through a 
centralized management console, which views and manages the health 
of antimalware software on workstations and servers. A lot of detail 
work is required, generally in coordination with senior-level security 
people. For example, a higher-up may determine which patches are to be 
applied to which assets at what time, and the junior-level person applies 
those patches correctly.
✓
✓Spam administration: Practically all organizations employ spam fil-
tering, often through a central console that manages filtering rules, 
exceptions, and a quarantine area for suspected spam messages. The 
spam-filtering system and its configuration requires regular attention, to 
make sure that legitimate email keeps flowing uninterrupted while spam 
is blocked and put aside.

31

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
✓
✓SIEM (security incident and event management) administration: A 
SIEM is a system that collects log data from lots of systems to correlate 
little events that help us understand bigger ones, such as employee 
abuse, system malfunction, and security breaches. A SIEM requires a lot 
of upkeep in two main areas: configuring alarms and alerts, and setting 
up feeds from new systems and devices.
✓
✓Vulnerability management: This set of activities may involve running 
security scanning tools such as Nessus, NMAP, or Rapid7 to look for 
vulnerabilities in workstations, servers, and network devices. Or you 
could load the raw output from scanning tools into the vulnerability 
management module of a GRC platform such as RSAM, Lockpath, or 
Archer. Also included in vulnerability management is the management of 
systems to push security patches and configuration changes to servers 
and workstations.
In all these roles, you learn one or more aspects of security administration 
and security operations. As you gain experience, you can work your way up 
to more senior roles.
Rolling Up Your Sleeves as  
a Security Practitioner
Many kinds of security jobs exist in business and government today. This 
section describes the most common ones.
Security analyst
Security analysts are thinkers, responsible for transforming data and events 
into usable information for themselves and others. Their industry expertise 
guides them in reaching meaningful and correct conclusions. Their commu-
nication skills enable them to impart their conclusions to others so that the 
organization can benefit from their work.
This description sounds vague because a security analyst’s work can 
range across the entire spectrum of security management, security opera-
tions, and security administration. A security analyst may be spending 
time ­conducting research — interpreting current events, new encryption 
algorithms, or many other things, and then figuring out how these external 
developments should shape the organization’s short-term operations or 
long-term strategy.
www.allitebooks.com

32
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
Still stumped? Here are some examples of work that a security analyst may 
perform:
✓
✓Analysis of events in a SIEM, DLP, IDS/IPS, or FIM system to determine 
the cause behind “interesting” events found in their logs
✓
✓Analysis of cryptographic algorithms used in industry to help determine 
whether cryptosystems in the organization are still effective or need to 
be upgraded to something better
✓
✓Analysis of the organization’s control and management framework 
against industry standards to determine whether changes are needed
✓
✓Analysis of current trends in malware and the organization’s current 
controls to determine whether advanced malware protection (AMP) 
tools are warranted
Security specialist
A security specialist is a security expert across a wide range of security 
­disciplines, techniques, and tools. You might think of a security specialist 
as a security analyst, security engineer, forensic investigator, IT auditor, and 
security architect rolled into one.
The role of security specialist is similar to that of a general practitioner in the 
health care industry.
Security engineer
A security engineer installs, configures, and manages various security tools 
and systems used by the organization. A senior-level security engineer is also 
involved in the testing and selection of new security tools and systems.
A security engineer will work with many types of security tools and systems, 
such as the following:
✓
✓Firewalls
✓
✓Next-generation firewalls
✓
✓Intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems
✓
✓Data loss prevention systems
✓
✓Spam filters
✓
✓Anti-malware
✓
✓Advanced malware protection systems

33

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
✓
✓Web access filters
✓
✓File integrity monitoring tools
✓
✓Cloud monitoring and control tools
✓
✓Netflow tools
✓
✓System and network forensics tools
Security engineers rarely work in a vacuum. Instead, they partner with many 
other people in the organization. For example, a security engineer works with 
network engineers to ensure the smooth and proper operation of all network-
based tools, and with the systems administrator or systems engineers to 
ensure the smooth and proper operation of all system-based tools.
Security architect
A security architect is a designer of processes and systems. This role is 
­typically the most senior position in information security for an individual 
contributor.
Generally, a security architect has responsibilities in one or more of the 
­following disciplines:
✓
✓Security technology
✓
✓Security processes
✓
✓Security framework and controls
✓
✓Security policy
A security architect determines how risks will be reduced in an organization. 
This role is in contrast to determining what risks will be reduced, which is 
often the job of the chief information security officer (CISO), described later 
in the chapter.
Forensic investigator
A forensic investigator, sometimes known as a forensics analyst or forensics 
specialist, conducts forensic investigations on computers and networks, 
­usually after a security incident or security breach has occurred.
A forensic investigation is a detailed analysis of an event. In the context of 
computers and networks, this investigation involves an examination of 
­computers and other devices, so that an event can be better understood.
www.allitebooks.com

34
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
The forensic investigator uses a variety of tools and techniques to answer 
the basic “what happened?” question. Forensic investigations are usually 
­conducted in two types of situations:
✓
✓Break-ins: When an external adversary breaks into a system or network, 
the investigator must figure out how the break-in occurred and what the 
person did.
✓
✓Policy violations: This situation mainly involves employee misconduct.
Forensic investigators often must employ “chain of custody” procedures 
because the results of their investigation become part of a lawsuit or criminal 
trial. The tools, techniques, and even the character of the forensic investiga-
tor may be called into question when the results of the forensic investigation 
are part of the evidence in a trial.
Because they often have access to information of the highest sensitivity, 
forensic investigators must be highly trustworthy, even by security profes-
sional standards.
IT auditor
An IT auditor (also known as an IS auditor or a security auditor) determines 
the effectiveness of security controls, and communicates that level of 
­effectiveness to others through written reports that describe controls, their 
intended function, and how well they carry out that function.
My Ben Braddock moment
In The Graduate, Ben Braddock (played by 
Dustin Hoffman) is a recent college gradu-
ate with no well-defined plans. I had my 
own Ben Braddock moment when someone 
asked me about the next steps I should take 
to add value and expertise to my career path. 
My friend leaned over and, instead of saying 
“plastics” like Dustin Hoffman’s adviser, said 
“forensics.”
A great deal of my work since then has been a 
direct result of that life-changing word. I went 
back to school and earned several certificates 
in computer forensics. While I was there, I took 
a class in the legal issues around e-discovery, 
and that topic has been a rewarding interest of 
mine ever since.
David R. Matthews, Seattle

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
If you’re picturing an auditor as someone with a checklist, you’re right: 
Experienced auditors use checklists to make sure they don’t forget any 
aspect of a control they are examining. However, they also have a deep 
understanding of the technologies and details involved in the controls 
they examine, and they understand that the true effectiveness of a control 
requires more than a checklist.
IT auditors must be independent and objective, so it is best if they are not 
members of the department they are auditing. Otherwise, it might appear 
that the auditor was being controlled by the department that he or she was 
auditing.
Getting to the Top in  
Security Management
Some people are satisfied in an individual contributor role and have no 
­interest in management. Others yearn to develop big visions, lead big teams, 
and do big things. This section describes pinnacle IT security roles in an 
organization, and the sensitivity and responsibility each entails.
Large versus small organizations
The day-to-day life of a security professional 
can vary widely due to many factors, including 
the size of the organization. For example, in a 
small organization, you would tend to be a “jack 
of all trades and master of none.” You may be 
involved in many facets of information secu-
rity and may often be faced with the ­difficult 
decision of focusing on certain ­activities at 
the expense of others. Security pros in smaller 
organizations are rarely bored, however, 
because each day can be wildly different from 
any other.
In a larger organization, you’ll have an 
­opportunity to specialize in an individual aspect 
of information security, such as vulnerability 
management, software development security, 
or physical security. Because you’ll stay in one 
focus area most of the time, your knowledge 
will deepen and you’ll learn valuable skills.
In general, if you like structure and predictabil-
ity, a position in a larger company might be right 
for you. But if you like variety and not knowing 
what the day will bring, a smaller company 
might be what you need.

Security manager
A security manager is a line manager who manages one or more individual 
contributors on a security team, including all the positions discussed previ-
ously in this chapter. Expected to have years of experience in one or more 
of these positions, a security manager assigns tasks, resolves disputes, and 
mentors his or her employees to further their professional growth. This role 
is like any other managerial in a technical organization.
For the right person, managing a team of security professionals can be 
the best job ever. As with most technology management jobs, you need to 
know how to do many of the tasks and jobs that you expect your staff to do 
because they’ll look to you to understand how to do their job even better. 
Establishing credibility in a technology management job requires the ability 
to show others how to do their job and inspiring them to do it well.
Check out Leadership For Dummies by John Marrin for more information on 
leading teams of workers.
Security manager jobs can be gratifying for people who have vision but who 
lack the time to do all the work themselves.
Compliance officer
Usually found in organizations with industry regulations, a compliance officer 
ensures that the organization is compliant with applicable laws and regula-
tions. Although this role is not a security position per se, I include it here 
because compliance is so often associated with information security.
Examples of industries and their applicable regulations follow:
✓
✓Financial services: GLBA (Gramm Leach Bliley Act), NCUA (National 
Credit Union Association), FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation), SSAE16 (Statement on Standards for Attestation 
Engagements No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization)
✓
✓Public utilities: NERC (North American Electric Reliability Corporation) 
and FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)
✓
✓Healthcare organizations: HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act)
✓
✓U.S. government agencies: FISMA (Federal Information Systems 
Management Act)

37

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
✓
✓Merchants and other entities that process credit card data: PCI-DSS 
(Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
✓
✓Organizations that write software for processing credit card data:  
PA-DSS (Payment Application Data Security Standard)
In addition, organizations voluntarily comply with other standards, including 
the following:
✓
✓ISO27001 (Information technology -- Security techniques -- Information 
security management systems – Requirements)
✓
✓SOC2 (Report on Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to 
Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality or Privacy)
Privacy officer
A privacy officer (PO) or chief privacy officer (CPO) is typically found in 
­organizations that store or process large amounts of sensitive data about 
individuals and is responsible for two primary aspects about that data:
✓
✓Protection from disclosure: Protecting sensitive data from disclosure is 
really just about data security controls in the context of sensitive data 
about people. Like other sensitive data in the organization, this informa-
tion must be adequately and effectively protected.
✓
✓Assurance of proper handling: An organization must have proper prac-
tices regarding handling and possible onward distribution of a person’s 
sensitive information. For example, an organization that collects contact 
information from its customers is generally prohibited from selling that 
information to other companies for marketing.
Sensitive data includes names and contact information, financial informa-
tion (including social security and other account numbers), and medical 
infor­mation. Each regulation or standard has its own definition of sensitive 
­information and required protection and handling requirements.
Because a chief privacy officer is generally in an organization with a chief 
information security officer (CISO) or chief security officer (CSO), a CPO’s 
job typically will focus on business use and proper handling of customer 
­sensitive information. The protection of that information is the job of the 
CISO or CSO.
www.allitebooks.com

38
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
Chief information security officer and 
chief security officer
The chief information security officer (CISO) and the chief security officer (CSO) 
are the top security jobs in government and industry.
The CISO and CSO typically report to the president or CEO of a corporation 
or to a cabinet member or department head in government.
The CISO deals primarily with the security of information systems and often 
with physical security. The CSO is concerned with security related to both 
technology and non-technology issues.
The CISO and CSO are typically responsible for the following:
✓
✓Security policy
✓
✓Risk management and risk treatment
✓
✓Security architecture
✓
✓Security operations
✓
✓Security incident response
CISOs and CSOs operate in the rarefied air of corporate (or government) 
executive management, where the loftiest issues concerning the organiza-
tion are discussed. Corporate or government politics deeply affect the CISO 
and CSO, and a lot of their time is spent negotiating with other executives to 
ensure that the organization is on the right footing for managing security and 
technology-related risk.
Understanding Success in a Security Job
A basic truth of information security jobs can be frustrating to some people 
but an exciting challenge to others: Your guidance on improving security and 
reducing risk will often be ignored.
Many security professionals have a difficult time with the feeling of being 
ineffective. You can spend considerable time on a project and provides rec-
ommendations for improving security, but many of those recommendations 
might be disregarded. A track record of such events can make most profes-
sionals feel like a failure.

39

 Chapter 2: Understanding InfoSec Roles: One Day in the Life
Security professionals need to understand that they are a change agent. 
Because information security practices are often not intuitive to others, your 
job will involve working with others so that they will embrace small or large 
changes and do their part to improve security in an organization. To be an 
effective change agent, you need negotiation and persuasion skills so that 
others will understand and embrace your point of view and realize why it’s 
important to the organization.
However, even if you’re a skilled negotiator, you won’t always get your way. 
This is not a failure because it’s your job to make sure that decision makers 
make informed decisions — in other words, it’s your job to inform them of 
the risks associated with their choices. As long as decision makers make 
informed decisions, considering a variety of factors that include security 
issues, you’ve done your job, whether or not you agree with the decisions. 
This aspect of information security jobs has nothing to do with technology 
and everything to do with people.

’m delighted that you’re interested in an information security job. With 
this book, I hope I can help you go into this field with your eyes wide open. 
This chapter describes the issues that the information security industry faces 
today — issues that we talk about with other professionals. You discover the 
everyday challenges — and opportunities — that we encounter when protect-
ing your companies, customers, computers, information, and users.
Malware and Exploits
Malware, short for malicious software, is software that has some harmful pur-
pose, by itself or as part of a bigger system. In this section you look at the 
types of malware, their internal components, evasion techniques, and the 
types of attacks that use malware.
Types of malware
In almost every field of information security, you will be engaged in the 
war against malware. The types of malware are viruses, Trojan horses, and 
worms.

Viruses
Computer viruses are fragments of computer code that attach to program 
files, disk boot sectors, or document files. When computer viruses are 
attached, the file (or disk) is said to be infected. The computer code in the 
virus is activated when its host (the program file, disk boot sector, or docu-
ment file) is executed, accessed, or opened.
Generally, when activated, a virus will attempt to attach itself to other files, 
disks, or documents. In this way, computer viruses move from computer to 
computer.
In addition to code to help propagate itself to other objects, a computer virus 
often has code to carry out other functions. For instance, a virus can delete 
or overwrite computer files, display information on the computer’s screen, 
play sounds, or attempt to communicate to other computers through any 
active network interfaces. Whatever you can imagine that a virus could do, 
someone has probably written a virus to do just that.
Several types of viruses exist, including the following:
✓
✓Resident: Remains in memory, typically from boot‐up to shutdown.
✓
✓Non‐resident: Starts running, performs its tasks, and then exits. It does 
not remain in memory.
✓
✓Boot sector: Attaches itself to a floppy, USB, or hard drive boot sector 
instead of to an executable program and is executed when the media is 
logically mounted. Okay, so floppy discs haven’t been around for years, 
but mentioning them gives you some background on how long boot 
sector viruses have been in existence.
✓
✓Macro: Attaches itself to a macro inside a word processing document 
or a spreadsheet file, and is typically executed when the document or 
spreadsheet is opened.
Some well‐known computer viruses include these:
✓
✓Elk Cloner: The first computer virus to affect Apple computers
✓
✓Brain: A boot sector virus that was among the first viruses to infect PCs
✓
✓Concept: The first macro virus, which attacked Microsoft Word  
documents
✓
✓Jerusalem: A virus that destroyed all executable files on infected 
machines on every Friday the 13th

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
A computer virus is so‐named because of its similarity to biological viruses 
that invade the living cells of organisms. Biological viruses are not separate 
living organisms; they depend on the cells they invade for replication and 
transportation. By itself, a biological virus is just a strand of information that 
can do nothing.
Trojan horses
A Trojan horse, like a computer virus, is a type of malware that cannot propa-
gate unless activated. (The malware got its name from the Trojan horse in 
the famous battle between the Greeks and their attack on the city of Troy.) 
A Trojan horse relies on a human to activate it, typically through a ruse or a 
trick; the user is generally offered a computer program for some given pur-
pose. When the user executes the program, the Trojan horse carries out the 
malicious purpose for which it was designed.
Following are two famous Trojan horses:
✓
✓Torpig: Turns off antivirus programs and permits its creator to remotely 
access compromised systems
✓
✓Cryptolocker: Encrypts files on a user’s hard drive and on any file 
shares accessible from the target computer and then offers a ransom to 
the user for a tool to decrypt their files
Worms
A worm is a type of malware that can propagate on its own or with a little 
help from humans. Famous computer worms include the following:
✓
✓Christmas Tree EXEC: The first self‐replicating computer worm
✓
✓Morris worm: Written as an experiment by Robert Tappan Morris, a 
student at Cornell University, and propagated through a series of known 
vulnerabilities and configurations across the early Internet in 1988
✓
✓ILOVEYOU: A rapidly spreading mass‐mailing worm that caused signifi-
cant disruption
✓
✓Code Red: A rapidly spreading worm that exploited vulnerability in  
the early Microsoft web server system called Internet Information 
Services (IIS)
✓
✓SQL Slammer: The fastest spreading worm of all time, crashing the 
Internet within 15 minutes of its release and attacking vulnerabilities in 
Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Data Engine (MSDE)
✓
✓Stuxnet: Possibly developed by the United States and Israel and designed 
to attack centrifuges used to refine weapons‐grade uranium in Iran

In 1949, years before the first computer network was built, John von 
Neumann wrote an article titled “Theory of self‐reproducing automata.” He 
was decades ahead of his time when he envisioned computer worms.
Malware components
Malware often consists of several components, each of which has a specific 
task. These components are
✓
✓Exploit: This code is written to take advantage of (exploit) a vulner-
ability in a target system. For example, a program running on a system 
might be vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. A Trojan horse might 
lack this component, because a Trojan horse is designed to trick the 
user into running the program.
✓
✓Dropper: This code is used to perform an installation of additional pro-
grams or malware. The dropper might copy the malware from inside the 
install package or download it over the Internet.
✓
✓Malware: This code fulfills the purpose of the attack. The malware could 
steal passwords as users type them, or eavesdrop on network traffic, or 
scan a hard drive for sensitive data and send it to the malware’s creator.
To better understand these components of malware, here’s an analogy in 
the physical world. A burglar breaks into a business. The weak lock on the 
back door is the vulnerability. The lock‐picking set that the burglar uses to 
open the back door is the exploit. The dropper is the burglar walking through 
the unlocked door into the building. The malware is the burglar installing a 
hidden video surveillance camera or stealing valuables from the business.
Trojan horses generally don’t have an exploit component. The human who 
executes or installs the Trojan horse takes the place of the exploit component.
Evading detection
In the earlier days of antivirus history a virus writer would create and release 
a new virus, and then a few months later antivirus companies would create 
the capability to neutralize the virus. After many years of this, virus writers 
developed increasingly advanced techniques for evading detection by antivi-
rus software, such as the following:
✓
✓Hosts file manipulation: By manipulating the hosts file (a flat file con-
taining DNS hostnames and their respective IP addresses), a virus can 
attempt to prevent the target computer from obtaining security patches 
and antivirus updates.

45

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
✓
✓DNS settings manipulation: This technique is another way of preventing 
the target system from obtaining security patches and antivirus updates.
✓
✓Process hiding: Malware will try to hide through a few different tech-
niques, such as giving itself a legitimate sounding name (for example, 
Explorer), attaching itself to a legitimate process, or manipulating the 
operating system so that its presence is overlooked.
✓
✓Polymorphism: Malware is typically recognized by its signature, similar 
to a criminal’s unique fingerprint. Malware employing polymorphism 
can evade signature‐based detection by changing its signature on every 
computer it infects.
✓
✓Hiding in USB firmware: A newer type of attack called BadUSB involves 
malware installed in the firmware of a USB device, which — like a boot 
sector virus — is activated upon insertion of a USB device. This attack 
is scary, except in organizations that have locked down the use of USB 
storage devices.
Types of malware attacks
Adversaries use a variety of techniques to try and get malware onto a target 
system. The more common techniques are described in this section.
Spam
Plain old unwanted emails can contain attachments (ZIP files, EXE files, 
­documents, spreadsheets, images, PDF documents, and so on) that contain 
malware. This type of attack is more correctly called a spam plus Trojan 
attack, because the email containing the malicious attachment usually makes 
a falsified claim regarding the attachment.
Phishing
This attack is similar to spam, except the email message includes a URL to a 
website containing malware just waiting to exploit a browser vulnerability. If 
you’re working your brain cells, you’ll recognize this as a social engineering 
attack because the attacker is trying to trick users into doing something they 
ought not do.
“Found” USB device
A favorite technique is to load malware on a USB device, and then leave it 
where someone is bound to find it. Curious employees spot the little gem 
and think, “Oh boy, a USB drive. I wonder what’s on it!” And then the trouble 
begins.

Downloaded software
Many of us love to download new programs, wallpaper images, and other 
fodder for our computer’s giant hard drives. However, downloaded software 
may contain malware that sneaks in during the software install.
Watering hole attack
A cheetah can go and chase its prey all over the place, or it can just hang 
out at the local watering hole and wait for its prey to show up. Watering hole 
attacks are like that: If an adversary is targeting a particular organization, it 
will install malware on a website that it thinks people in the target organiza-
tion will frequent.
Zero‐day attacks and advanced malware prevention
A zero‐day attack is a malware attack for which few or none of the antimal-
ware vendors have the capability to detect, never mind prevent.
The two popular uses for the term zero day follow:
✓
✓Brand new exploit: This proper use of the term zero day refers to 
malware (the exploit portion, specifically) that attacks a vulnerability 
unknown to the target’s manufacturer. For example, an adversary dis-
covers a new buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 
and creates exploit code that permits the attacker to execute arbitrary 
code on the target machine, permitting a dropper to install malware on 
the machine. The term zero day refers to the number of days from public 
disclosure of a vulnerability to its successful exploit; an attack on an 
unknown vulnerability means that zero days have passed from public 
disclosure of the vulnerability to its exploitation. In the case of a zero‐
day exploit, no public disclosure has been made.
✓
✓Unknown malware: This popular, though technically incorrect, use of 
the term zero day means that a specific instance of malware has never 
been seen by antimalware vendors — hence, no signature or defense 
exists for it. In this form of the term, zero‐day malware may be unique 
and unknown to antimalware vendors but exploiting a previously known 
vulnerability.
In both cases, zero‐day attacks are unknown to antimalware vendors as 
well as other defenses such as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). Only 
advanced malware prevention tools will be able to detect and block zero‐day 
attacks.
In the information security profession, the malware battle is considered lost. 
Antimalware defenses can no longer prevent all infections due to the new 
methods of propagation, exploitation, and hiding created by our adversaries.

47

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
Antimalware
Antivirus software, now often called antimalware, attempts to detect and 
block all types of malware. Here is a brief history of the advances in antimal-
ware from its humble beginnings:
✓
✓Self‐contained and scan only: The earliest antimalware programs came 
prepackaged to detect and neutralize all known varieties of malware. 
The only way that early antimalware worked was through a whole‐disk 
(or whole‐floppy) scan.
✓
✓Real‐time detection: Antimalware improved to include detection of an 
infection in real‐time. This process required tight integration with the 
computer’s operating system: Every time a program opened a file, the 
antimalware program would first examine the contents of the file to see 
whether it contained malware.
✓
✓Signature updates: As the number of viruses and other types of malware 
grew, it became evident that antimalware needed to be updated peri-
odically so that newly discovered malware could also be detected and 
blocked.
✓
✓Heuristic detection: Antimalware vendors, discouraged by the sheer 
number of new viruses being created every day, turned to another tech-
nique called heuristics, in which antimalware observes the behavior of 
programs and blocks them if they were acting malwarelike.
Advanced malware prevention (AMP) tools detect and block many kinds of 
advanced malware, including polymorphic malware, zero‐day attacks, and 
advanced persistent threats (APTs). Instead of relying on signatures, AMP 
tools take other approaches, including the following:
✓
✓Malicious network traffic detection: AMP tools that connect to network 
span ports can observe all network traffic in to and out of an organi-
zation. These tools are able to detect command and control traffic, 
which is a hallmark of bots and botnets (described in the next section). 
Depending on their configuration, AMP tools can either detect or detect 
and block such traffic.
✓
✓OS process analysis: AMP tools that work on servers and workstations 
keep a close eye on processes running on the system, recording what 
they do and blocking malicious ones.

Assaults on Organizations
The unrelenting assaults on governments and businesses by cybercriminal 
organizations is the central theme of information security at every level, from 
executives to analysts. Indeed, cybersecurity is an important topic at the high-
est levels of government and private industry. Senior officials and executives 
are expressing concern over high‐profile break‐ins and their own organiza-
tions’ defenses. This section describes the types of attacks we’re facing today.
Break‐ins
Malware is not the only tool in an attacker’s toolbox. Just as lock picking is 
one way to break into a building, other techniques are frequently used to 
break into computer systems. Some of these techniques follow:
✓
✓Password guessing: Intruders will attempt to guess a user’s login creden-
tials so that they can access a system. From there, the intruder may steal 
data, perform fraudulent transactions, or gather information that will lead 
to a break‐in on another system. Tools are available that rapidly guess 
likely passwords, but sometimes attackers guess passwords manually.
✓
✓Eavesdropping: Intruders will use a number of techniques to eavesdrop 
on a network connection or even a telephone conversation to pick up 
valuable information that they can use to break into a target system.
✓
✓Social engineering: Intruders will trick other people to perform certain 
acts or reveal certain information, all of which helps the intruder break 
into a target system. Intruders can trick users into giving them vari-
ous bits and pieces of information that, when put together, will give an 
intruder enough information to slip into an organization’s network.
The scourge of malware
In the earliest days of malware, five to ten new 
computer viruses occurred in a year. Today, 
Kaspersky Lab claims that it detects over three 
hundred thousand malware variants every day. 
Even if the actual number was one hundred 
times less, the traditional model of antimal-
ware and its periodic updates can no longer 
effectively address the tremendous growth in 
malware.
In 2014, one of the major antimalware vendors 
publicly stated that antimalware was no longer 
effective against the advanced techniques 
employed by malware. As experienced security 
professionals, we agree.

49

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
✓
✓Theft: In a time‐proven technique, an attacker steals a computer (or 
smartphone or tablet computer) and hopes to find information on the 
device to break into that device or break into another system.
In the early days of computer crime, malware didn’t yet exist, so attackers 
relied on the preceding techniques, which they performed manually. These 
techniques are still used regularly even with some punchy malware.
Social engineering is one of the biggest problems in computer security today. 
When organizations do a good job of protecting their computers and net-
works, intruders turn to “hacking the people” instead, with great success.
Bots and botnets
A product of networking and the global Internet, bots and botnets represent 
a remarkable feat of distributed computing. They would be something to 
admire if it weren’t for the fact that they exist primarily to carry out mali-
cious deeds. Still, bots and botnets require our respect, for they can be 
­powerful and inflict much mischief and damage when so directed.
In the early 2000s, malware creators expanded their vision and created a con-
cept wherein a single operator could create a piece of malware that would 
give him or her automated remote control of many computers at once. Any 
one of these compromised computers is called a bot (short for robot), and 
a collection of these bots under central control is known as a botnet or bot 
army. The person who operates the bot army is a bot herder.
By themselves, bots are capable of a variety of tasks, including the following:
✓
✓Hosting phishing sites: A phishing scam typically involves an imposter 
website. Rather than going to a cloud service provider such as AWS or 
Azure, an adversary will use compromised systems, modifying them so 
that they are web servers that steal login credentials or implant malware­ 
on new victim computers (sometimes for the purpose of growing a bot 
army).
✓
✓Relaying intrusions: While carrying out illicit activities online, adversar-
ies are usually careful to cover their tracks, typically by relaying their 
traffic through a number of compromised systems.
In addition to the preceding capabilities, a bot army can be used for addi-
tional tasks, such as
✓
✓Relaying spam: A spammer always needs to find new compromised 
machines through which he or she can relay spam messages. This is 
because of spam services that quickly detect spam relays and block them. 
www.allitebooks.com

50
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
A bot army is an effective tool for relaying spam as the spammer can use 
bots in quick succession, evading spam‐blocking tactics.
✓
✓Participating in a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS): In this 
attack, hundreds or thousands of computers are directed to flood a 
target system (or network) with a high volume of network traffic. The 
objective of a distributed denial of service attack is the prolonged inca-
pacitation of a target system so that it is unusable by its legitimate users.
Two famous botnets are
✓
✓Storm: This botnet started out as the Storm worm, infecting each vul-
nerable target system with the storm bot software, forming the storm 
botnet. Little known fact: Though called a worm, Storm was a Trojan 
because it spread through email and relied on users to open attach-
ments containing malware.
✓
✓Conficker: This worm and its variants infected many versions of the 
Windows operating system, as old as Windows 2000 and as new as 
Windows 7.
Advanced persistent threats
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a broad technique of cyberespionage, 
system compromise, and data exfiltration inflicted on a specific target and 
with a specific objective. The term APT is also frequently used as a label for a 
person or a group of people using such tools.
Depending on the sophistication of the APT team, the techniques for a 
specific campaign may be custom developed to target the technologies 
used by the organization. A result of this customization is a zero‐day attack 
(described earlier, in the “Zero‐day attacks and advanced malware preven-
tion” section).
Disruptive Trends
Attacks and cybercrime are not the only things vying for information security 
professionals’ attention. Another issue is the parade of technical innovations 
that provide businesses with compelling opportunities for improved produc-
tivity and service levels. At the same time, these innovations — like many 
new technologies — are not fully “baked” at first and often don’t have all the 
security features that organizations need.

51

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
Some new technologies, such as virtualization, are more mature, but organi-
zations (including their security teams) are still playing catch‐up in terms of 
knowing how to configure and operate them in a way that protects them from 
internal and external attacks.
Mobility trends
Everything was fine in corporate IT organizations until users started bringing 
their own personal computers, tablet computers, and smartphones to work 
and using them to get their jobs done. Security professionals need to address 
several issues pertaining to BYOD (bring your own device, or bring your own 
disaster, as many security professionals like to call it):
✓
✓Endpoint security: When personally owned devices are used to conduct 
business, the organization may have a more difficult time employing its 
antimalware, patch management, and encryption enterprise tools. In 
addition, many mobile platforms lack mature enterprise management 
capabilities and antimalware.
✓
✓Control of sensitive information: When personally owned endpoints 
(laptops, tablets, smartphones, or anything else that employees own 
that they use to conduct official business) are lost or stolen, the organi-
zation may have more limited means of remotely wiping data on these 
devices. And when an employee leaves, determining whether he or she 
really (and effectively) erased company data will be difficult.
Many mobile device management (MDM) tools are available for enterprises, 
but these tools are still maturing. Few if any offer truly comprehensive man-
agement and data protection capabilities across the variety of devices that 
employees are likely to use for business.
Virtualization
Virtualization is the practice of installing one or more instances of actively 
running operating systems on a single hardware server. The primary busi-
ness driver for virtualization is the preservation of capital. The main technol-
ogy drivers are more efficient use of server hardware and the capability to 
quickly move a running system from one hardware platform to another.
The master virtualization program is called a hypervisor, and the operating 
systems running on a hypervisor are called guests. In addition to operating 
systems such as Windows, Linux, and MacOS, network operating systems can 
run as guests, including routers, firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS),

52
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
and data loss prevention (DLP) systems. Hence, it’s now possible to build an 
entire infrastructure stack, including network infrastructure, on a single hard-
ware server.
This powerful capability is part of what keeps an information security profes-
sional up at night. The lack of “air gaps” between infrastructure components 
in a virtualized environment provides more opportunities for attackers to 
successfully infiltrate virtual systems.
Another concern of IT managers and security managers alike is virtualiza-
tion sprawl, the uncontrolled implementation of new virtual servers without 
proper approval. Unlike the former physical world, where management’s 
approval to purchase server hardware served as the means to control the 
implementation of new servers, with virtualization it’s possible to create a 
new server with just a few clicks.
Cloud computing
The trend in cloud computing can be summed up as follows: Organizations 
tend to acquire new business applications hosted by other organizations, 
rather than hosting the applications themselves on purchased computer 
hardware. In other words, why buy new hardware, operating system, data-
base management system software, and application software, when you can 
pay some other company to do all that for less money?
The lists of pros and cons for cloud computing are long. The economic driv-
ers swing heavily in favor of cloud computing, but many IT and security orga-
nizations are unprepared to manage the security of cloud apps as effectively 
as on‐premise apps.
The most important issues that security professionals face regarding cloud 
computing include the following:
✓
✓Cloud sprawl: Because it is so easy to begin using a cloud‐based appli-
cation, IT and security organizations often have little visibility into just 
how extensive an organization’s use of cloud services has become. The 
number of unapproved cloud services in use by your organization is 
probably worse than you think.
✓
✓Data security: Knowing which controls a cloud services provider uses 
and their effectiveness can be difficult. In other words, the protection of 
information stored in the cloud can be difficult to verify.
✓
✓Data control: An organization that isn’t aware of all the cloud apps it 
uses has lost control of its data. If you don’t know where your data is, 
how can you control it?

53

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
✓
✓Legal issues: Security and privacy laws crisscross the world, making 
data jurisdiction and data sovereignty stickier issues than ever. For 
instance, how do you know if it’s even legal to store certain data in cer-
tain locations (provided you even know the physical locations of data 
stored in the cloud).
As scary as this all sounds, hope is on the horizon. Later in this chapter, the 
“Cloud Security Alliance” section provides information that will help you get 
better visibility and control over your data in the cloud.
The Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the name given to the coming phenomenon of 
the wave of Internet‐connected smart devices. Soon, nearly everything we pur-
chase that uses electricity will have a CPU and be connected to the Internet, 
including our home appliances, our vehicles, our gadgets, and even us.
In the context of information security as we know it today, this proliferation 
of Internet‐connected devices will intensify the vulnerability management 
problem. With so many more devices with latent vulnerabilities, adversaries 
will have a new playground to explore.
Regulatory Compliance and Privacy
Security professionals have a love‐hate relationship with laws and regula-
tions. As information security laws began to be passed in the 1980s and 
1990s, we danced gleefully in the aisles at work because we now had an addi-
tional tool when trying to convince others of the need for security. We were 
able to also say, “It’s the law!”
But the love was short‐lived, and soon we were grumbling because we were 
not able to choose which forms of security to implement. Instead, we were 
required to implement security controls even when doing so made no sense. 
Soon we learned to be selective and prudent when stating “it’s the law.”
FISMA
The Federal Information Systems Management Act, or FISMA, requires that 
all U.S. federal government systems meet minimum security standards. Many 
U.S. states, counties, and cities have also adopted the same level of standards.
www.allitebooks.com

54
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
NIST SP800‐53 and FIPS‐200
In simplest terms, FISMA requires that U.S. federal government agen-
cies comply with several standards, including NIST (National Institute for 
Standards and Technologies) Special Publication 800‐53, Security and Privacy 
Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, and FIPS (Federal 
Information Processing Standards) Publication 200, Minimum Security 
Requirements for Federal Information and Information Systems.
Many nongovernment organizations voluntarily comply with the NIST and 
FIPS standards, because they recognize their value and understand that 
doing so will increase their security.
Certification and accreditation
Government agencies are required to undergo a process that includes an 
assessment of an information system and a formal approval process that 
authorizes the agency to begin (or continue) use of the system. These pro-
cesses are together known as certification and accreditation, or C&A. The cer-
tification part is the assessment of the system against NIST 800‐53, FIPS‐200, 
and possibly other standards and requirements. The accreditation part is the 
formal authorization to use the system after the assessment has been com-
pleted and analyzed.
New systems are required to undergo C&A, and most systems are required to 
be recertified periodically, typically every one to three years.
FEDRAMP
Organizations that provide services to the U.S. federal government are also 
required to comply with NIST 800‐53 and FIPS‐200. Government agencies are 
required to utilize a process called FEDRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization 
Management Program) to assess service providers before they are used. This 
requirement primarily applies to cloud service providers and other instances 
of government agencies outsourcing IT infrastructure or applications to ser-
vice providers.
HIPAA and HITECH
Healthcare providers, insurance companies, and most U.S. based compa-
nies offering health insurance benefits are required to comply with HIPAA 
(Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and HITECH (Health 
Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act).
HIPAA requires that organizations storing electronic protected health infor-
mation (EPHI) take certain measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, 

55

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
and availability of EPHI. Organizations required to comply with HIPAA are 
known as covered entities.
HITECH expanded the reach of HIPAA by requiring business associates that 
store or process EPHI to comply with HIPAA as well. The term business asso-
ciates means any organization that provides services to a covered entity. 
HITECH also added new breach notification requirements, ensuring that citi-
zens will be notified if their health information is inappropriately disclosed or 
compromised.
Sarbanes‐Oxley
The Sarbanes‐Oxley Act of 2002 is a law that was passed as a result of several 
corporate scandals involving falsification of financial records of public compa-
nies. Often known as SarBox or just SOX, this law has had a significant effect 
on security policy and security controls in U.S. publicly traded companies.
SOX Controls
The primary consequence of SOX was the enactment of controls in the fol-
lowing IT functions:
✓
✓Security policy: Organizations are required to have a security policy 
that is relevant, periodically reviewed and approved by management, 
and enforced.
✓
✓Access management: Organizations are required to have effective and 
mature access management processes and tools, so that only authorized 
personnel have access to appropriate systems, roles, and functions.
✓
✓Change management: Organizations are required to be in complete 
control of the IT systems and infrastructure that supports their financial 
systems, so they must have a mature change management process that 
ensures that only approved changes may be made to systems and that 
unapproved changes will be detected and corrected.
✓
✓Incident management: Organizations are required to have tools and 
processes in place to detect incidents in a timely manner and to respond 
to incidents properly and effectively, resulting in incident resolution as 
well as a complete understanding of the extent of any incident.
✓
✓Vulnerability management: Organizations are required to have tools 
and processes in place to periodically examine systems for vulnerabili-
ties and to correct those vulnerabilities timely and effectively.
✓
✓Event logging: Organizations are required to have tools and processes 
in place to ensure that all events are recorded, and that those record-
ings are archived, for in‐scope systems. Periodic review — or automated 
alerting — of events is also required.

56
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
✓
✓Internal audit: Organizations are required to take full ownership of the 
state and effectiveness of their internal controls, including periodic 
internal audits of those controls and effective responses to issues found 
during those audits.
The context of these controls is an organization’s key financial system, as 
well as supporting systems and infrastructure. Any additional applications 
related to revenue or expenses may also be in‐scope.
The intent of these IT controls is the prevention or detection of any tamper-
ing of financial records that is performed through manipulation of underlying 
IT systems and infrastructure.
Audits
U.S. public companies are required to undergo an annual financial audit by a 
U.S. registered public accounting firm. Before SOX, the IT portion of a public 
audit was brief and superficial. After SOX, IT audits are typically thorough 
and arduous, with considerably more attention on IT operations for in‐scope 
systems, infrastructure, and personnel.
State data breach laws
Starting with California’s well‐known SB1386 in 2002, the majority of U.S. 
states, as well as many other countries, have enacted laws that require the 
disclosure of security breaches involving certain records of their citizens. 
The crux of California’s breach notification law is that notification is required 
if the data in question was not encrypted; if data in encrypted form is 
acquired by an unauthorized party, no notification is required.
The ever‐changing patchwork
From 2002 to the present day, U.S. states have been enacting and updating 
their laws regarding the protection of citizens’ data. These U.S. state laws 
alone present a challenge to many organizations that routinely process per-
sonal data on U.S. citizens: Just keeping up with all the changes in these laws 
is problematic.
Reaching across borders
Many U.S. state privacy laws claim jurisdiction of companies that have pri-
vate records on its citizens, regardless of the location of those companies. 
Information security professionals often wonder whether those laws are 
enforceable across state lines. For instance, suppose that a company in 
Colorado has a compromise of private information for citizens in California. 
Will California’s breach notification law truly be able to enforce that law on a 
company located in Colorado — or anywhere else?

 Chapter 3: Exploring Current Issues in Information Security
EU data privacy laws
In 1995, the European Union passed the European Privacy Directive, some-
times referred to by its number, 95/46/EC. This directive established an 
operational model for the collection, storage, processing, and distribution of 
personal information of European citizens.
The directive defines the rights of European citizens with regards to the use 
of their personal information. European citizens have the right to know what 
information is being kept about them and how it is used, and the ability to 
correct that information or request its removal. The directive also imposes 
requirements on organizations to use reasonable means to protect this infor-
mation and to facilitate citizens’ rights as described.
The European Privacy Directive prohibits European companies from trans-
mitting private citizen data to countries outside Europe that have weaker 
privacy laws, such as the United States. However, the United States and the 
European Union bridged this gap through the use of Safe Harbor Principles, 
where individual U.S. companies can voluntarily agree to protect data on 
European citizens in accordance with the European Privacy Directive. This 
agreement can be accomplished through individual legal contracts between 
European and U.S. companies. U.S. companies can also voluntarily register 
their businesses on the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor website, 
which legally obligates those U.S. companies to protect data on European 
citizens to the same level as the European Privacy Directive.
Privacy
The term privacy has several meanings and interpretations. In several con-
texts, privacy is a social and political hot button. But this is not a book about 
politics or philosophy, so the discussion here is focused on how privacy 
pertains to business and information security. First, a definition: Privacy is 
concerned with the safeguarding and proper use of citizens’ personal and 
sensitive information.
Let’s dissect this definition a little more:
✓
✓Safeguarding personally sensitive information: In this vein, privacy is 
information security focused on one type of data — that of citizens’ per-
sonal information. In practice, protecting personally sensitive informa-
tion is really not any different from protecting any other information in 
an organization. For us to do our jobs, we need to understand how this 
information is collected, stored, processed, and removed. Then we can 
use the tools in our toolboxes to maximize protection.

✓
✓Proper use of personally sensitive information: Mainly, is the data safe-
guarded (see the first bullet), and is it used only for purposes explicitly 
stated, or is it also sold to marketing companies who will bombard us 
with unwanted emails, telephone calls, and junk mail? This aspect of pri-
vacy is of concern to us, but it’s somewhat outside our core concern — 
unless you’re the chief privacy officer in an organization, in which case 
it’s your main concern!
Permitted uses of private information
A common practice for organizations that collect personally sensitive infor-
mation about citizens is the publication of a privacy policy. Often seen on 
corporate and government websites, a privacy policy typically provides a 
detailed account of the methods used to collect, store, and process users’ 
personal information. Usually, a privacy policy explains how this information 
may be forwarded to other organizations for a variety of purposes, methods 
available for users to verify, correct, and remove their data, and the ability to 
opt out of certain activities, features, and uses of their data.
In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has kept a close eye on 
organizations’ published privacy policies and has levied fines or lawsuits on 
organizations that violate their own published privacy policy.
Cookies, beacons, and other online tracking
In the online world, many people are wary of the methods used by certain 
organizations to track users’ Internet usage for the purpose of delivering 
targeted advertising. One of the more controversial practices is Google’s 
method of reading the contents of an e‐mail message and delivering ads 
to the user based on keywords in the message. Another less controversial 
method, but one that still has many persons’ blood boiling, is the use of 
tracking cookies, web beacons, and other tricks to track the Internet site 
­visitation habits of individual users.
Cookies are small data objects sent from a website and stored by a user’s 
browser on the user’s local computer. There are three types of cookies used 
today:
✓
✓Session cookie: This type of cookie is used between web servers and 
users’ web browsers to establish and maintain a user’s session with the 
website. Web servers use session cookies to distinguish one user from 
another. Also known as authentication cookies, session cookies are usu-
ally considered an acceptable use of cookies.
✓
✓Tracking cookie: This cookie is typically used to improve a user’s experi-
ence when visiting a website. For instance, tracking cookies store a user’s 
language preference, landing page, currency, and so on. A tracking cookie 
is also called a persistent cookie and originates from the same domain in 
the browser’s address bar.

✓
✓Third‐party cookie: This tracking cookie is sent from a website not in 
the browser’s address bar. Third‐party cookies are often used for adver-
tising tracking and other uses often not associated with the core func-
tionality of the website that a user is visiting.
Web beacons, also known as web bugs or tracking bugs, are objects that a 
user’s browser or email client downloads when a user is viewing a web page 
or HTML‐encoded email message. When a user’s browser or email client 
downloads a web page or email message containing a web beacon, this down-
loading is logged in the beacon’s web server log, facilitating tracking of the 
viewing of the web page or email message by the user. Web beacons take the 
following forms:
✓
✓1x1 GIF (image) file that is transparent or the same color as the web 
page, which makes it effectively invisible to the end user
✓
✓1x1 HTML frame that is invisible to the user
✓
✓JavaScript file that is invisible to the user
Flash cookies are tracking objects similar to browser cookies and are used by 
Adobe Flash browser plug‐ins. Flash cookies can be used for purposes similar 
to those for tracking cookies.
Information Security Standards
Standards are statements of how things are done. Individual organizations 
often develop standards that describe how they do certain things, such as 
how to
✓
✓Harden (protect from attack) an Internet‐facing Windows server
✓
✓Build and install IT components in retail locations
✓
✓Configure end user workstations
Within an organization, standards help drive consistency, which in turn 
improves service levels and security.
At the industry level, standards have a similar purpose: They drive consis-
tency in the way that typical things are accomplished. In information secu-
rity, several excellent standards represent effective methods for security 
processes and security technologies. In this section, you discover the most 
popular security standards that have had a positive, lasting effect and serve 
as guideposts along the road to more secure organizations.

ISO 27001
ISO 27001 is a highly respected international standard for information secu-
rity management. ISO 27001 uses the term information security management 
system (ISMS) to describe the processes and records required for effective 
security management in any size organization.
The full name of the standard is Information technology — Security techniques; 
Information security management systems — Requirements. This complicated 
name is related to the two major sections of the standard as described next.
Requirements
The requirements section of the standard describes the necessary character-
istics for an organization to properly manage its ISMS. The requirements sec-
tion consists of the following:
✓
✓Context of the organization: The intended scope of the standard in an 
organization
✓
✓Leadership: The executive management commitment to maintaining an 
effective ISMS and security policy, and formally establishing security‐
related roles and responsibilities
✓
✓Planning: Activities such as risk assessments and risk treatment
✓
✓Support: Providing the necessary resources, training, and communica-
tions regarding security
✓
✓Documented information: Consistent practices related to security‐
related documents and records
✓
✓Operation: Performing risk assessments and risk treatment
✓
✓Performance evaluation: Security monitoring, internal auditing, and 
management review
✓
✓Improvement: Watching for and seizing opportunities to make security 
processes and controls better over time.
Controls
The controls section of ISO 27001 contains a set of industry standard con-
trols, organized in the following categories:
✓
✓Information security policies
✓
✓Organization of information security
✓
✓Human resource security
✓
✓Asset management

✓Systems acquisition, development, and maintenance
✓
✓Supplier relationships
✓
✓Information security incident management
✓
✓Information security aspects of business continuity management
✓
✓Compliance
Becoming ISO 27001 compliant
An organization that wants to improve its security management system using 
ISO 27001 as its standard would undergo the following activities:
✓
✓Gap analysis: The first step in achieving compliance, a gap analysis is 
performed either by the organization or by an outside expert. A gap 
analysis helps the organization understand which requirements and 
controls it does and doesn’t comply with.
✓
✓Remediation: For any requirements and controls with which the orga-
nization is not compliant, it can make changes to its personnel (such as 
training), processes, and technologies to become compliant.
✓
✓External audit: An organization that needs to demonstrate compliance 
via an external audit can hire a competent security assessment firm to 
perform an audit with a detailed audit report and opinion of compliance.
✓
✓Certification and registration: An organization can choose to undergo 
a higher‐quality external audit by employing one of the organizations 
authorized to certify and register an organization as ISO 27001 compli-
ant. The advantage is that the audit firm is held to a high standard on 
ISO 27001 audits. ISO 27001 certification is generally more costly than 
an external audit but may be required in some circumstances.
Individuals in an organization can receive training and earn an ISO 27001 
Internal Auditor certification. Organizations committed to ISO 27001 compli-
ance will often obtain this certification for one or more of their employees, who 
through this training will better understand the meaning of ISO 27001 require-
ments and controls, as well as the proper techniques to determine compliance.
A single user copy of the ISO 27001 standard costs nearly $300. This cost is 
the single barrier preventing wider adoption of this high‐quality standard.

NIST 800‐53
Special Publication 800‐53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal 
Information Systems and Organizations, is a highly recognized and respected 
framework of security controls for both government and private organiza-
tions. It’s published by the National Institute for Standards and Technology 
(NIST), a branch of the U.S. Department of Commerce.
All agencies of the U.S. federal government are required to comply with NIST 
SP 800‐53; however, many state and local governments, as well as private 
organizations, also use NIST SP 800‐53 as their security controls framework.

63

How InfoSec issues affect us
Information security is the fastest‐­changing 
discipline in both information technology 
(IT)  and general business. Here are some 
examples of the things that are changing 
­rapidly:
✓	Attackers and attack techniques: Even 
more quickly than we find ways of stopping 
them, attackers are improving their attack 
techniques and attacking in new ways.
✓	Malware innovation: Malware is becoming 
faster, stealthier, and more potent. Today’s 
malware has rendered traditional antivirus 
and antimalware all but obsolete.
✓	New, disruptive tools and technologies: 
Hardware and software tech firms are invent-
ing and creating lots of cool, new, and dis-
ruptive technologies, such as Apple iPhone, 
Google Glass, Nest, Uber, and smart utility 
meters.
✓	Standards and regulations: Laws on data 
protection and privacy are ever changing.
✓	Internet of Things (IoT): If we thought things 
were complicated now, an explosion of 
Internet‐connected devices is just around 
the corner, creating a heyday for attackers, 
who will then have more types of devices to 
explore and vulnerabilities to exploit.
A recent industry report claims a world short-
age of over one million information security­ 
­professionals. A lot of work must be done to 
keep our adversaries at bay and effectively 
protect our critical information. As a result, we 
frequently have to determine which of the impor-
tant issues of the day warrant our attention.
The primary way in which the explosion of infor-
mation technology affects us is in how we spend 
our time. Security professionals need to spend 
several hours each week reading about current 
events, innovations, and industry changes to be 
properly informed and, therefore, effective in 
our jobs. Often we feel battle‐weary, and yet the 
fight goes on every day. InfoSec work is highly 
rewarding work, but it is not easy work.

Although these standards are voluntary, they represent significant improve-
ment in the development of controls and guidance for cloud service provid-
ers and consumers of cloud services.
PCI Security Standard Council
Organizations that store, process, or transmit credit card data are subject to 
one or more standards meant to ensure the protection of credit card data. 
PCI (Payment Card Industry) Security Standards Council, a non‐profit organiza-
tion formed by the major credit card brands (VISA, MasterCard, American 
Express, Discover, and JCB), manages these standards and certifications.
PCI‐DSS
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI‐DSS) is an industry 
standard established and maintained by the PCI Security Standards Council. 
Usually known as PCI‐DSS or just PCI, this standard requires organizations 
that store, process, or transmit credit card data to comply with all applicable 
requirements in the standard. The following organizations are required to 
comply:
✓
✓Card issuers such as banks and credit unions
✓
✓Payment processors and gateways
✓
✓Merchants
✓
✓Any service provider that handles cardholder data
PCI is primarily enforced through the major credit card brands. Any organiza-
tion that is unable or unwilling to comply with PCI can be fined by one or more 
of the card brands, and even be cut off from being able to issue or process 
cardholder data.
www.allitebooks.com

66
Part I: So You Want to Be an InfoSec Professional 
Organizations that process a smaller number of credit cards per year are 
permitted to self‐certify to the PCI‐DSS. Larger organizations are required to 
undergo an annual on‐site audit by an organization certified to conduct these 
audits.
All organizations that process any number of credit card records are required 
to undergo a quarterly security scan of its external assets, performed by an 
organization certified to perform these scans.
PA‐DSS
The Payment Application Data Security Standard (PA‐DSS) is an industry stan-
dard for the certification of commercial payment applications that process 
credit card transactions. The PA‐DSS is especially useful for merchants and 
other organizations seeking software applications; by selecting a PA‐DSS–
certified application, they can reduce the scope of audits and compliance 
efforts.
Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)
Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) is a certification affixed to an organization 
that performs PCI audits. All individual employed in a QSA‐certified organiza-
tion that will be performing PCI audits are also required to undergo annual 
training and examination for QSA certification.
Internal Security Assessor (ISA)
Internal Security Assessor (ISA) is a certification earned by a security or audit 
professional as an employee of an ISA sponsor company. An ISA sponsor com-
pany is a merchant or service provider that will agree to sponsor one or more 
of its employees for PCI training. By having an employee ISA certified, the orga-
nization can better understand what they must do to maintain PCI compliance.
Individual QSA and ISA certifications are granted to security professionals 
with their present employers. If the QSA or ISA professionals leave their 
employer, they lose QSA or ISA certification and must become recertified by 
their next employer.
Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV)
An Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) is a company that has been certified by 
the PCI Security Standards Council to perform the quarterly security scans 
that all merchants and service providers are required to undergo.
PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI)
A PCI Forensic Investigator (PFI) is a company that has been certified by the PCI 
Security Standards Council to perform forensic investigations on organizations 
that have suffered a security breach of its cardholder data.

Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
or more aspects of information security. Colleges and universities also offer 
continuing education programs in information technology and security.
Undergraduate programs in information 
security
Universities around the world offer undergraduate degrees in information 
security — too many to list in this book, and that’s a good thing. You can 
probably find a university near you that offers a degree in information  
security. Many universities are also offering online degrees.
Typical degrees being awarded include the following:
✓
✓Bachelor of Science in Information Security
✓
✓Bachelor of Science in Security and Risk Analysis
✓
✓Bachelor of Science in Security Engineering
✓
✓Bachelor of Science in Information Technology — Security
✓
✓Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Security
The variety of degree programs will help you build the foundation of your 
career as you begin your formal education.
Your best long-term strategy should include the completion of an undergrad-
uate degree in a technical field. The more college education you have, the 
more you will enjoy more opportunities for jobs and career growth.
Graduate degrees in information security
Like undergraduate degrees, graduate-level degrees in information secu-
rity are offered by many universities. A graduate degree is a great path for 
advanced studies and will help you compete for advanced positions in infor-
mation security. Many middle- and upper-management jobs in information 
security require advanced degrees.
Graduate degrees being awarded include the following:
✓
✓University of Washington: MS in Cyber Security Engineering
✓
✓Western Governors University: MS in Information Security and 
Assurance

Management
✓
✓International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (also known as  
EC-Council), Master of Security Science
A good reference for locating graduate-level education can be found at  
www.gradschools.com.
Continuing education
Continuing education is the practice of continually obtaining training courses 
to expand one’s knowledge and skills. In the information security profession, 
continuing education is essential to our success for several reasons:
✓
✓High rate of change: The information security business is undergoing an 
extremely high rate of change. New threats, vulnerabilities, techniques, 
and security breaches happen daily. Unlike many other professions that 
move much more slowly, InfoSec undergoes constant transformation.
The value of a college degree
The advantage of a formal university educa-
tion is that you have the opportunity to immerse 
yourself in information security and really live 
and breathe it. Additionally, companies and the 
federal government are actively and heavily 
recruiting from university programs dealing with 
information security. Internships are also avail-
able, and the major consulting companies are 
looking for individuals with some skill in the field.
The disadvantages? Getting a college degree 
is costly and time-consuming and can be espe-
cially difficult if you’re not in a position to go 
back to school full time. Thankfully, programs 
are available that accommodate those with a 
job and family life, but it’s a considerable invest-
ment in time and resources regardless.

✓Certification requirements: You’ll need to earn one or more vendor or 
nonvendor certifications (which are described later in this chapter). 
Many of these certifications require that you undergo continuing educa-
tion to remain in good standing.
Certificates from colleges and universities
Many colleges and universities have continuing education programs designed 
for working professionals. Often these are evening or weekend programs in 
which students earn certificates. Many are offered online, which gives you a 
wider choice of certificate offerings.
Examples of these certificates include the following:
✓
✓Certificate in Information Security and Risk Management, from the 
University of Washington

Other continuing education opportunities
Besides certifications and formal training courses, you can continue your 
information security education in other ways, including the following:
✓
✓Vendor product training
✓
✓Vendor product demos
✓
✓Security organization chapter lectures
✓
✓Lectures at security conferences
Military education
Today’s military organizations still have their traditional weapons: guns, 
­warships, submarines, fighter planes, and bombers. These large organiza-
tions require a lot of information technology to support them. So that they 
can protect their own networks, military organizations train many of their 
personnel in different facets of information security. The internal networks in 
military organizations utilize the same technologies as commercial networks, 
so most of the skills learned while in the military will translate directly into 
private sector or public sector jobs.
Military organizations also have offensive and defensive cyberwarfare capa-
bilities. Specialists who work in these areas will also learn valuable skills that 
will translate nicely into information security jobs in private organizations 
and as security consultants.
Examples of military training in information security include the following:
✓
✓U.S. Army School Cyber Leader College: Information Assurance and 
Computer Network Defense training and certification
✓
✓U.S. Navy: training in information warfare, cyberwarfare engineering, 
and cryptography
✓
✓U.S. Air Force: training in cybersurety and cybersystems operations
Vendor Certifications
Vendor certifications play an important role in many information tech­nology 
career paths, and information security is no different. Formal education 
and training (discussed earlier in this chapter) provide you with important 
­fundamental knowledge and theories that will endure throughout your career.  
www.allitebooks.com

74
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
Vendor certifications, on the other hand, can serve as an important cap-
stone that provides practical, hands-on knowledge of current security 
­technologies.
Most vendor certification exams are administered at Pearson VUE (www.­
pearsonvue.com) and Prometric (www.prometric.com) testing centers. 
These testing centers have strict identification requirements to verify the 
candidate’s identity before taking any exam. Most exams are computer-based 
and provide test results immediately after completion of the exam. Visit the 
testing centers’ respective websites to locate a test center near you, schedule 
an exam, find out about specific identification requirements, and pay your 
test registration fees.
Vendor certification programs are continuously updated. The information 
presented here is current as of this writing, but you should always visit the 
vendor’s website before pursuing a certification to ensure that you have the 
latest information about that certification and its requirements.
Check Point
The Check Point Certified Professional Program (www.checkpoint.com)

CCNA Security certification first requires candidates to earn either the 
Cisco Certified Entry Networking Technician (CCENT) or CCNA Routing and 
Switching certification. The candidate must then pass the Implementing Cisco 
IOS (Internetwork Operating System) Network Security (IINS) exam. This 
90-minute exam consists of 55 to 65 questions covering the following topics
✓

CCENT certification requires the candidate to pass the Interconnecting 
Cisco Networking Devices Part 1 (ICND1) exam. CCNA Routing and Switching 
Certification requires the candidate to pass the ICND1 and ICND2 exams, or 
the CCNA Composite Exam (CCNAX).
Recognition of a different sort
Cisco security certifications can also earn 
you important recognition by the U.S. National 
Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Department of 
Defense (DoD).
The CCNA Security certification complies with 
the Committee on National Security Systems 
(CNSS) 4011 training standard, which applies 
to certain information security profession-
als responsible for identifying system vul-
nerabilities, investigating and documenting 
system security technologies and policies, 
and analyzing­ and evaluating system security 
technologies. The CCNA Security certification 
program satisfies the formal NSA and CNSS 
training requirement for information security 
professionals who work with federal agencies 
and private sector organizations to protect their 
information and defend the nation’s vital infor-
mation assets.
The U.S. Department of Defense has also cer-
tified the CCNA Security certification as DoD 
8570.01-M compliant. The DoD 8570 Directive 
provides guidance and procedures for the 
training, certification, and management of 
DoD employees who perform Information 
Assurance (IA) functions. These employees 
are required to hold an approved certification 
for their particular job role and classification. 
The CCNA Security certification has been 
approved for DoD Information Assurance 
Technician Levels I and II.

with the term ethical hacker. The fuss is partly to do with the change in usage 
for the term hacker, which used to describe a hobbyist or enthusiast, but 
now is a mostly negative term meaning someone who breaks into systems to 
steal data or alter its contents or function.
EC-Council has many security-related certifications. EC-Council certification 
exams can be taken in any EC-Council Accredited Training Center, Pearson 
VUE, or Prometric testing center (in the United States). Certifications avail-
able from EC-Council include the following:
✓
✓Certified Secure Computer User (CSCU): For end users who are not 
security professionals. This certification focuses on safe computer and 
mobile device usage, safe Internet usage, and data protection.

MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB. The Council has devel-
oped several security standards for use by banks, card issuers, merchants 
who accept credit cards as a form of payment, and other service providers 
who process, store, or transmit credit card numbers. In support of this over-
all program, security professionals can earn several certifications that pro-
vide recognition of their expertise and give them certain privileges. The two 
prevalent certifications are discussed here.

can perform internal audits and provide guidance to IT and security per-
sonnel in the organization regarding its compliance to the Payment Card 
Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).
The ISA certification is valid for an individual only while he or she is 
employed in the same company. If those with an ISA certification change 
companies, they must be recertified.
Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)
The Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) certification is a recognition of knowl-
edge, skills, experience, and training in the Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard (PCI-DSS). An individual with a QSA is authorized to con-
duct third-party PCI-DSS audits of an organization.
An individual with a QSA must be an employee of an organization that itself is

ou can’t protect what you don’t understand. To be an effective informa-
tion security professional, understanding how information technology 
works is not negotiable. The task of protecting electronically stored informa-
tion is a technical challenge: The more you know about IT, the more effective 
you’ll be as an information security professional.
This chapter is modeled precisely after five of the ten categories in the 
Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) in the CISSP (Certified Information Systems 
Security Professional) certification. The five categories in this chapter are more 
technology-centric. The other five categories of the CISSP CBK are covered in 
Chapter 6.
For a deeper dive into the CISSP common body of knowledge, pick up the 
latest revision of the book, CISSP For Dummies, 4th Edition.
It would be unwise to think of the topics in this chapter as being strictly tech-
nology based, just as much as it would be to consider the topics in Chapter 6 
as being strictly management based. Management and technology have a 
symbiotic relationship.
Access Control
At its heart, access control is all about who (or what) is allowed to access 
something. When access control is performed correctly, unauthorized per-
sonnel are denied access to sensitive data. Often, access controls — even a 
single user ID and password — are the only defense between sensitive data 
and criminals who want it.

Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
Basic concepts in access control
The basics of access control are all about the technologies and business pro-
cesses used to manage authentication. There are a lot of ways to get access 
control wrong, and few ways to get it right. The concepts in this section are 
the most important in all of information security.
Authentication
Authentication is the process of asserting one’s identity — including required 
proof such as a password, token, or biometric — to a system to access its 
resources. The identity takes the form of a user ID, which is a value assigned 
to a person or machine.
Single-factor authentication generally involves the presentation of a user ID 
and password. This common form of authentication is vulnerable to attack by 
adversaries.
A password is a secret word, phrase, or random characters used as a part of 
single-factor authentication. The quality of a password is an important factor 
that helps resist some forms of attack. Characteristics of password quality 
include length (how many characters), complexity (whether the password 
must contain lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerals, and special 
characters), expiration (how much time may elapse before a user is required 
to select a new password), recovery (the process used when users forget 
their password), and reuse (whether previously used passwords may be 
used again).

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
Passwords are typically stored in hashed form. Hashing is an irreversible 
cryptographic function that facilitates the confirmation of a correct password 
during the login process but prevents the extraction of passwords. Hashing is 
explained in more detail in the “Cryptography” section, later in the chapter.
Multifactor authentication generally involves the presentation of a user ID, 
together with a token or biometric. This type of authentication is generally 
stronger than single-factor authentication. A token is a hardware device that 
is used in multifactor authentication, and represents a far stronger form of 
authentication than single factor. Some form of a biometric can also be used 
in multifactor authentication, such as a fingerprint, a palm scan, an iris scan, 
or a voiceprint.
Access control attacks and countermeasures
Adversaries who are attempting to access resources in a target system fre-
quently attack access controls. Methods of attack include the following:
✓
✓Replay attack: An attacker intercepts an authentication, typically over a 
network, and replays the captured login credentials to try to gain unau-
thorized access to the target system. A replay attack can be successful 
even when some forms of token authentication are used, provided the 
attacker replays the captured login credentials soon after capturing them.
✓
✓Stealing password hashes: The attacker obtains the database of hashed 
passwords from a system. If the hashing method used is weak, the 
attacker may be able to employ rainbow tables or other techniques to 
obtain account passwords. A rainbow table is a simple (but very large) 
lookup table containing all possible password hashes and their corre-
sponding passwords. The technique known as salting (mixing in random 
numbers when storing the hash of a new password) prevents the use of 
rainbow tables.
What you know, have, and are
The concepts in single-factor and multifac-
tor authentication are sometimes difficult to 
understand. In the information security profes-
sion, three phrases often used to simplify these 
concepts:
	✓	What you know: User ID and password 
authentication. The user ID and password 
are something that a user would know.
	✓	What you have: Token or smart card 
authentication. The user must have the 
physical object (and use it properly) to  
log in.
	✓	What you are: Biometric authentication. 
Some physical aspect of a user, such as a 
fingerprint, retina scan, or even voiceprint.

Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
✓
✓Interception of passwords in transit: An attacker may be able to 
intercept login credentials if they are transmitted “in the clear” (unen-
crypted) over a network. Older but still-used protocols such as Telnet 
and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) employ the transmission of login 
credentials without encryption. Discontinuing Telnet and FTP in favor 
of ssh (Secure SHell), FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure), and SFTP 
(Secure File Transfer Protocol) eliminates this threat.
✓
✓Session hijacking: An attacker attempts to steal session cookies from a 
user’s web session; if successful, the attacker will be able to hijack the 
user’s session. The attacker may then be able to perform all functions 
that the user could perform. Proper session management, including full 
session encryption and encryption of session cookies, can prevent ses-
sion hijacking.
✓
✓Key logger: An adversary may be able to use one of several methods to 
get key logger malware installed on a user’s system. If successful, the 
key logger will be able to intercept typed login credentials and transmit 
them to the adversary, who can use them later to access those same 
systems. Multifactor authentication and advanced malware prevention 
(AMP) tools can help thwart key loggers.
✓
✓Social engineering: Adversaries have a number of techniques available 
to trick users into providing their login credentials. Techniques include
•	Phishing: The attacker sends an email that attempts to trick the 
user into clicking a link that takes the user to a phishing site, which 
is an imposter site used to request login credentials. If the user 
provides those credentials, the attacker can use them to access 
the real site.
•	Watering hole attack: An attacker selects a website that he or 
she believes is frequented by targeted users. The attacker attacks 
the website and plants malware on the site that can, if successful, 
install a key logger or other malware on the victim’s workstation.
Access control processes
Getting access control technology right is a challenge, but it’s not the biggest 
concern. The business processes supporting access controls are critical. If 
not implemented and managed correctly, the best access control technology 
is of little use — similar to owning a car with the best burglar alarm and then 
parking the car unlocked with the keys in the ignition switch.
Key processes in access control include the following:
✓
✓Access provisioning: The process of provisioning access for a user 
should follow a strict, documented process. Every request should be 
properly approved by one person/group and performed by a different 
person/group. Records for all steps must be retained.

107

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
✓
✓Internal transfers: Access management personnel need to be notified 
when an employee is transferred to another position, so that the issue of 
accumulation of privileges can be prevented.
✓
✓Employee termination: Access management personnel need to be noti-
fied immediately when an employee leaves the organization, especially 
if the person is being terminated. All user accounts should be locked or 
removed and then double-checked.
✓
✓Managing access controls for contractors, temps, and others: All per-
sonnel with access to organization systems and applications need to 
be managed using the same set of processes. Too many organizations 
do a substandard job of managing temporary workers. The result is 
the ­existence of user accounts for personnel who no longer work in the 
organization.
✓
✓Password recovery: Organizations need a solid process for users who 
forget their passwords. Otherwise, attackers may be able to use this pro-
cess to take over employees’ user accounts.
✓
✓Periodic access reviews: Every aspect of access management needs to 
be periodically reviewed to ensure that every instance of access provi-
sioning, termination, and transfers are performed correctly. The conse-
quences of messing up access control processes can result in active user 
accounts with excessive privileges, and user accounts still associated 
with terminated personnel.
Emerging issues in access control
Issues that keep information security professionals up at night include these:
✓
✓Key logging malware
✓
✓Stolen password hashes
✓
✓Users who select poor (easily guessed) passwords
✓
✓Users who reuse personal passwords on business sites
Telecommunications and  
Network Security
In a large room crowded with information security professionals many years 
ago, the CISO for a global financial services organization told us that we could 
be effective in our jobs only to the extent that we understood the business 
and the technologies it used.
www.allitebooks.com

108
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
Networking at the business level and at the telecommunications level is 
common among virtually every organization. Hence, it is vital that every 
information security professional have some degree of working knowledge 
of networking technologies. Networks are the pipes that run the Internet and 
facilitate commerce, and the avenues through which our adversaries conduct 
their attacks. If we don’t know enough about network technology, how can 
we play a meaningful role in protecting our organizations’ assets?
Basic concepts in telecommunications and 
network security
You need to understand the important concept of encapsulation because 
it is used throughout almost all network technologies. In encapsulation, 
messages of one protocol are placed in messages of another protocol. For 
example, SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol) messages are placed in TCP 
(Transmission Control Protocol) messages, which are placed in IP (Internet 
Protocol) messages, which are placed in DS-1 frames, which are placed in 
OC-48 frames.
Here’s an analogy. You write a message on a sheet of paper (SMTP message), 
place it in an envelope (TCP message), and place the envelope in a mailbox 
(IP message), where a mail truck (switch) picks it up and delivers it to a dis-
tribution center (router). There, the envelope (TCP message) is placed in 
a bin (IP message), which is driven to another distribution center (router). 
There, the bin (IP message) is placed in a larger bin (DS-1 frame) and driven

plane (OC-48 frame) that flies through the air (optical fiber). At the other end 
of the flight, the process is reversed, and the recipient receives the note on 
the sheet of paper.
Network technologies
A plethora of network technologies exist; I discuss the important ones in this 
section.
Wired telecom network technologies
Wired telecom networks connect homes, businesses, schools, and govern-
ments through technologies that use copper or fiber optic cabling to carry 
many types of signals. These signals include the following:
✓
✓DS-1 (Digital Signal one), T-1, E-1: DS-1 is a family of multiplexed telecom-
munications technologies that have carried voice and data for decades 
in the United States and Europe. In the United States, T-1 is the basic 
protocol, which runs at 1.544Mbps. It’s often multiplexed into 24 64Kbps 
voice channels for use by ordinary phone and fax lines, often known as 
POTS (plain old telephone service). In Europe, E-1 is the basic protocol, 
at 2.048bps, or 32 voice channels. Speeds higher than DS-1 are available, 
such as DS-3 (44.736Mbps), DS-4 (274.176Mbps), and DS-5 (400.352Mbps).
✓
✓SONET (Synchronous Optical Networking): This new high-speed tele-
communications backbone technology runs over fiber optic cables on 
land and in submarine cables. SONET runs at dizzying speeds, including 
OC-1 (48.960Mbps), OC-3 (150.336Mbps), OC-12 (601.344Mbps), OC-96 
(4,810.752Mbps), and OC-192 (9,621.504Mbps).
✓
✓DSL (Digital Subscriber Line): This family of protocols is delivered to 
homes and businesses over the same pairs of copper wires as telephone 
service but at a higher frequency.
✓
✓DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification): This family 
of technologies transports TCP/IP over cable television service to homes 
and businesses.
✓
✓MPLS (MultiProtocol Label Switching): This packet-switched technol-
ogy transports a variety of protocols such as TCP/IP, Ethernet, ATM, 
and VoIP over long distances. MPLS includes Quality of Service (QoS) 
settings to ensure that protocols such as voice and streaming video are 
transported without annoying interruption even when networks are 
­congested.

✓
✓Dark fiber: This option is not really a technology but a telecommunica-
tions medium available to businesses. Businesses can connect their 
own telecom equipment to fiber optic cabling to connect their networks 
between buildings in a city or metropolitan area, using any protocol 
they want.
Older technologies you don’t need to be too concerned with anymore (unless 
you’re a technology history buff) include ISDN, ATM, Frame Relay, X.25, and 
PSTN.

Wireless telecom networks are used to connect individuals, homes, and busi-
nesses through the use of several technologies, including the following:
✓
✓GPRS (General Packet Radio Service): This technology is encapsulated 
in the GSM (Global System for Mobile communications, originally Groupe 
Spécial Mobile) cellular protocol.
✓
✓LTE (Long Term Evolution): This wireless telecom standard provides 
voice and data service with speeds up to 300Mbps.
✓
✓WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access): A wireless 
telecom standard that provides data rates up to 40Mbps for mobile sta-
tions and 1Gbps for fixed stations, WiMAX was developed to be a wire-
less alternative to DSL and DOCSIS.
Other notable technologies include CDPD, CDMA, and packet radio.
Wired consumer and business network technologies
Although many standards have been used for wired network technologies, 
the long-term trend has been a general migration to TCP/IP on Ethernet over 
copper cabling or fiber optic cabling. The dominant technologies follow:
✓
✓CAT-6 (Category 6) cabling: The darling of homes and businesses run-
ning wired networks over distances of up to 100 meters, CAT-6 cabling 
can run Ethernet speeds up to 10Gbps.
✓
✓Fiber optics: Businesses often run fiber optics in larger buildings to con-
nect networks from floor to floor, as well as from building to building. 
Fiber-optic cabling is made of glass and transmits signals as visible light, 
as opposed to CAT-6 and other metallic cabling, which transmits signals 
as electrical signals.
Has-been cabling used in the past includes Thinnet, Thicknet, Cat-3, and Cat-5.

Wireless consumer and business network technologies
Wireless network technologies are wildly popular in a number of typical set-
tings. The technologies in use are
✓
✓Wi-Fi: A technology widely used in residences, small and large busi-
nesses, retail stores, restaurants, government buildings, and even 
outdoors, is the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless protocols. A variety of 
security protocols are used on Wi-Fi, ranging from none (no encryption 
at all), WEP (Wired Equivalency Protocol, now considered obsolete), 
WPA (Wireless Protected Access, which is just okay), and WPA2 (pre-
ferred by anyone thinking about security). The range of Wi-Fi is about 20 
meters indoors and farther outdoors.
✓
✓Bluetooth: This popular wireless protocol connects devices in close 
proximity to one another. Wireless earsets and headsets were the first 
really popular use of Bluetooth.
✓
✓NFC (Near Field Communications): This very short range (6 cm) wire-
less protocol was developed for use in contactless payment systems.
Runner-ups include iRDA (the infrared point-to-point technology that has all 
but disappeared), wireless USB (up and coming, and possibly a force in the 
future).
TCP/IP
Developed in the 1970s as a robust military communications network that 
had some self-healing properties and resilience, TCP/IP has formed the basis 
for virtually every home, business, and commercial network, as well as the 
global Internet itself.
TCP/IP is a packet-based technology in which messages are bundled into 
packets that are routed to their destinations. A single packet has a source 
address, a destination address, a protocol number, and payload (the con-
tents of a message).
TCP/IP addressing
The source address and destination address follow a numbering convention, 
with a global authority that assigns addresses to organizations. In TCP/IP 
­version 4, the form of an address is
xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
where each xxx (octet) is commonly portrayed as a decimal value and can 
range from 1 through 255. In TCP/IP version 6, the form of an address is

112
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx
where each xxxx (hextet) is a hexadecimal value that can range from 0000 
through FFFF.
TCP/IP routing
In TCP/IP, packets are processed by routers as they make their way from 
their source to their destination. You can think of a router as a traffic cop (in 
a street intersection) who tells you which way to turn. A router examines a 
packet’s destination address, consults its routing table, and then sends the 
packet in the correct direction to get it closer to its ultimate destination.
Routers exchange routing information, so that each router has a better idea 
about which direction to send each packet. They exchange this information 
through several routing protocols, such as RIP, BGP, IGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. 
These routing protocols each have best uses: Some are used by Internet 
backbone routers, and others are better suited for routers inside a company. 
Some become obsolete, and newer and better ones are developed.
TCP/IP protocols
TCP/IP has two basic protocols, on top of which nearly all the others are 
used — via encapsulation (the nesting process explained earlier). These two 
basic protocols are
✓
✓UDP: Formally known as User Datagram Protocol, UDP is a simple, con-
nectionless protocol typically used to send a message in a single packet.
✓
✓TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): This connection-oriented pro-
tocol is usually intended for a longer conversation between systems. A 
TCP session is established by something called a three-way handshake 
that works something like this:
Station A: Hello, I&rsquo;m Station A and I&rsquo;d 
like to talk to you, Station B.
Station B: Hello, I&rsquo;m Station B and yes 
I&rsquo;d like to talk to you, Station A.
Station A: Hello Station B, I&rsquo;m happy we have 
agreed to talk to each other.
The TCP and UDP protocols contain hundreds of established protocol stan-
dards, a few of which are well known and frequently used, such as
✓
✓HTTP (HyperText Transport Protocol): Using port 80, transports user 
web traffic without encryption.
✓
✓HTTPS (HyperText Transport Protocol Secure): Using port 443, trans-
ports web traffic with encryption.

113

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
✓
✓SMTP (Simple Mail Transport Protocol): Using port 25, transports email 
without encryption.
✓
✓DNS (Domain Name Service) protocol: Using port 43 (on both TCP and 
UDP services), translates domain names such as www.dummies.com 
into IP addresses.
✓
✓FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Using ports 20 and 21, enables bulk file 
transfers without encryption.
✓
✓SSH (Secure SHell) protocol: Using port 22, provides administrative 
access to systems and network devices.
The OSI Network Model is something you should become familiar with to 
understand concepts such as encapsulation.
Network security
Several network-centric security devices are used to protect systems, net-
works, and information from intruders. I describe the more common types in 
this section.
Firewalls
Firewalls are inline devices placed between networks to control the traffic 
that is allowed to pass between those networks. Typically, an organization 
will place a firewall at its Internet boundary to prevent intruders from easily 
accessing the organization’s internal networks.
A firewall uses a table of rules to determine whether or not a packet should 
be permitted. The rules are based on the packet’s source address, destina-
tion address, and protocol number. Firewalls do not examine the contents of 
a message.
Firewalls are used to create a demilitarized zone (DMZ), which is half-inside 
and half-outside networks where organizations place Internet-facing systems 
such as web servers. This strategy helps protect the web server from the 
Internet and also protects the organization in case an adversary compro-
mises and takes over control of the web server. Figure 5-1 depicts a typical 
DMZ network.
Intrusion prevention system (IPS)
An intrusion prevention system (IPS) is an inline device that examines incom-
ing and outgoing network traffic, looking for signs of intrusions and, when 
any intrusion is detected, blocking such traffic.
www.allitebooks.com

114
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
Unlike a firewall, an IPS does examine the contents of network packets, not 
just their source and destination addresses. This approach is based on the 
principle that malicious traffic may be characterized by its contents, not 
merely its origin or destination.
Like a firewall, an IPS is typically placed at or near Internet ingress and egress 
(entrance and exit) points, so that all Internet incoming and outgoing traffic, 
respectively, can be examined and any malicious traffic blocked.
Data loss prevention (DLP) system
A data loss prevention (DLP) system examines (primarily) outgoing traffic, 
looking for evidence of sensitive data being sent out of the organization inap-
propriately. A DLP system is configured to look for specific patterns in outgo-
ing data and send alerts or just block traffic meeting certain criteria.
Web-filtering system
A web-filtering system examines the websites that an organization’s personnel 
are visiting. The web-filtering system logs all web access by personnel and 
can also be configured to block access to various categories of websites (for 
example, pornography, gambling, weapons, or social media sites) as well as 
specific sites. The purpose for web-filtering systems is generally twofold: to 
prevent access to sites that are clearly not work related and to protect the 
organization from accessing sites that may be hosting malware.

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
Virtual private network
A virtual private network (VPN) is a technique used to encapsulate network 
traffic flowing between two systems, between a system and a network, or 
between two networks. Typically, encryption is employed along with encap-
sulation so that the contents of the traffic cannot be read by anyone who 
intercepts the traffic.
VPNs are most commonly used for remote access, as well as to protect infor-
mation flowing over the Internet between specific organizations.
Attacks and countermeasures
Intruders are incredibly efficient at finding ways to break into an organiza-
tion’s networks. They do so to steal valuable data that they can easily mon-
etize. The techniques used and the defensive countermeasures, include the 
following:
✓
✓Phishing: Adversaries compose realistic-looking emails to trick users 
into clicking links to phishing sites, which are malicious sites that will 
attempt to install malware on victims’ workstations or steal login cre-
dentials. Countermeasures include spam filters, antimalware, intrusion 
prevention systems, and security awareness training.
✓
✓Watering hole attack: Adversaries find websites that they think an orga-
nization they’re targeting might visit. They take over those websites and 
install malicious software that visitors will unknowingly install, leading 
to an intrusion. Countermeasures include web-filtering systems, antimal-
ware, and intrusion prevention systems.
✓
✓Denial of service attack: Adversaries will attack a target system 
to incapacitate it, either through a high volume flood of data or 
through malicious traffic designed to incapacitate the target system. 
Countermeasures include firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and 
cloud-based denial-of-service defense services.
Emerging issues in telecommunications 
and network security
New developments that keep information security professionals on edge 
include the following:
✓
✓The Internet of Things (IoT): Many new devices are being connected 
to the Internet, and we all know that many of them do not have well-­
implemented security.
www.allitebooks.com

116
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
✓
✓BYOD (bring your own device): Network interoperability and the pro-
liferation of powerful consumer devices such as iPhone and Android 
means millions of workers are using their personal devices at work as 
work tools. Personally owned devices in a business network result in a 
wide range of issues, including malware control and data control.
✓
✓IPv6: The shortage of available IP addresses and other issues are com-
pelling organizations to migrate to IPv6. Although it is more secure 
by design, few network and security professionals are as familiar with 
IPv6 as they are with IPv4. Implementing IPv6 can lead to security holes 
through improper configuration.
Software Development Security
Software programs play a key role in facilitating access to sensitive informa-
tion. For this reason, software is often attacked, in the hopes that a weakness 
in a software program will enable the attacker to obtain the entire trove of 
information to which the software program has access. Organizations must 
ensure that their software programs have no vulnerabilities that can be 
exploited by others.
Basic concepts in software development 
security
As I’ve said elsewhere in this chapter, a security professional can only pro-
tect what he or she understands. Software is a key target of unrelenting 
attacks, so it’s important to understand how software works and how it is 
built and maintained. Buckle up!

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
Types of software
Software comes in many shapes and sizes. Some programs work by them-
selves, and others work as a part of a larger system. Some of the types of 
software include the following:
✓
✓Agents: These small programs run on a local system with some type of 
connection to a master program or console someplace else. For exam-
ple, an agent on a workstation can facilitate the installation of security 
patches as directed by an administrator on a central console.
✓
✓Applets: These programs operate within the context of another pro-
gram. For example, Flash Player operates within a web browser.
✓
✓Client-server: In this application architecture, some of the application 
resides on a workstation (usually having to do with data display and 
data input), and some resides on a central server (usually having to do 
with data storage and retrieval).
✓
✓Distributed: This application architecture consists of several compo-
nents residing on different systems.
✓
✓Web: This application consists of a web browser on a user’s workstation 
(or mobile device), a web server, and often an application server and a 
database management system.
✓
✓Utilities: Usually standalone programs, utilities are used by system 
administrators to maintain a system. Think of utilities as the brooms, 
dustpans, and Crescent wrenches of information systems.
✓
✓Operating systems: These programs facilitate the use of computer hard-
ware, including storage, memory, and peripheral devices. Examples of 
operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Ubuntu Linux, Apple OS 
X, and Android.
Application models and languages
The building blocks of applications are their source code, written in a specific 
language such as C, Java, and Assembler. A program is run on a computer in 
two ways:
✓
✓Compiled: The program is processed once, in advance, by a compiler, 
which transforms it into machine-readable form called an executable. A 
program needs to be compiled just once, and the executable can be run 
over and over.
✓
✓Interpreted: The program is interpreted in real-time. The process is 
similar to compiling, except that it must be done each time the program 
is to be run.
www.allitebooks.com

118
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
A number of alternative application models are in use today, including the 
following:
✓
✓ Object-oriented (OO) system: This hierarchical system consists of 
classes (software libraries), objects, methods, and logical construction 
that includes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymor-
phism. OO is a world all its own.
✓
✓Neural network: Designed to mimic the operation of the human brain, 
a neural network is given a large collections of relevant situations and 
outcomes. With enough of these, the neural network can make meaning-
ful predictions regarding a particular problem. An example of a neural 
network is forecasting the time and location of a hurricane’s landfall.
✓
✓Expert system: This system accumulates knowledge on a particular sub-
ject regarding past events. An inference engine analyzes this information 
to arrive at a decision or a solution to a problem.
Threats to software programs
Plenty of threats are carried out against software programs every day; they 
are the “low-hanging fruit” targets in the cybercrime world. The most well-
known threats, plus countermeasures, follow:
✓
✓Buffer overflow: In a buffer overflow attack, the attacker is providing 
data in an input field in which the software program requesting data is 
doing little or no input validation or boundary checking. In a successful 
buffer overflow, the input data literally overflows the memory storage 
area intended for the input data. The overflow data consists of machine-
readable instructions that the attacker hopes will be executed, leading 
to control of the application program and perhaps the entire machine. 
The main countermeasure against buffer overflow is boundary definition 
and checking.
✓
✓Authentication bypass: Often, only a user ID and password are protect-
ing sensitive data. For this reason, attackers will use every trick in the 
book to bypass authentication to get straight at sensitive data.
	All attack types listed here represent some method for bypassing 
authentication.
✓
✓Injection attack: Similar to a buffer overflow, an injection attack inserts 
some sort of scripting language into an input field, in a way that tricks 
the target system into executing the script. Types of injection attacks 
include SQL injection (instructions to the back-end DBMS) and script 
injection. The countermeasure to injection attacks is careful parsing and 
filtering of all input data, so that no commands are allowed or accepted.
✓
✓Malicious software: Often used with buffer overflow and injection 
attacks, malicious software (often known as malware) is designed to steal 

119

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
or alter data, steal login credentials, or permit a takeover of the target 
system for most any malicious purpose. Countermeasures to malware 
include antimalware (formerly known as antivirus) and intrusion  
systems (IPS).
✓
✓Mobile code: Similar to malware, mobile code is downloaded and exe-
cuted in real time. The most common type of mobile code is code down-
loaded by a web browser, such as JavaScript. Countermeasures against 
mobile code include tighter controls to browsers and other software 
to limit or prohibit mobile code from being downloaded and executed. 
Application whitelisting (the use of a tool or technique to permit only 
known programs to run) can also be an effective countermeasure.
✓
✓Logic bomb: A logic bomb is code that performs some malicious action, 
such as deleting or altering data. A programmer or an outsider might 
place a logic bomb in an application. Countermeasures against logic 
bombs include code reviews and tight access control to source code.
✓
✓Back door: A back door is a feature that a developer places in an applica-
tion that enables some type of undocumented feature or access to the 
system or database. Back doors are often used during development and 
should be removed. Countermeasures against back doors include code 
reviews and tight access control to source code.
✓
✓Object reuse: Object reuse is a flaw in an application or its underlying 
operating system that permits another process to access residual data 
no longer used by the application. Examples include released memory 
space that wasn’t cleaned up and temporary files. Countermeasures 
include proper OS selection and configuration to prevent other pro-
cesses from accessing residual memory, and better access controls for 
(or erasure of) temporary files.
✓
✓Social engineering: Social engineering is any act in which attackers are 
attempting to trick a user into performing some action. Social engineer-
ing can take place in person (an attacker pretending to be a package 
delivery person), by telephone (a person pretending to be IT or a user 
who needs help), and online (by phishing). Unlike a lot of online attacks 
for which many effective countermeasures are available, social engineer-
ing attacks can often be successful.
Security in the development life cycle
Many attacks against applications can be defeated if the application itself is 
designed and constructed properly. Security can be introduced into the soft-
ware development life cycle (SDLC) with minimum disruption, as follows:
✓
✓Conceptual stage: The program or major changes to it are being con-
sidered. Security professionals who get involved at this stage bring 
regulations, standards, and common attacks to the surface, so that the 
conceptual design can be free of fatal design flaws.
www.allitebooks.com

120
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
✓
✓Requirements definition stage: A suite of security requirements is intro-
duced, in addition to other types of requirements.
✓
✓Design stage: Here, when the detailed design is coming together, key 
security components and features will be a part of the program.
✓
✓Coding stage: Developers develop the actual source code using safe 
libraries, and their development tools are configured to perform rudi-
mentary security checks to uncover security flaws at the code level.
✓
✓Testing stage: All security requirements identified in the requirements 
definition stage are tested and verified.
✓
✓Maintenance stage: After the program is in production, any changes 
to it go through the stages just listed, so that the changes will have the 
required security features and characteristics.
Database management system
A database management system (DBMS) is a software program that manages 
structured collections of information (databases) and facilitates the storage 
and retrieval of information to and from these databases.
A DBMS employs sets of rules that preserve the integrity and structure of the 
databases, as well as access controls that determine whether specific people 
(or programs) are permitted to access or update specific data items in a 
­database.
The most common type of DBMS is a relational DBMS, which is used by 
Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL. Other types are object, network, 
hierarchical, and distributed.
Emerging issues in software  
development security
As is the case in all areas of IT, security in software development will always 
be evolving, with no end to new concerns:
✓
✓Outsourced software development that introduces flaws: An organi-
zation that uses outside developers or entire development firms may 
create a situation in which security flaws (such as buffer overflows, 
injection attacks, back doors, logic bombs) may be introduced into the 
system.
✓
✓Open source software that is less secure than we believed: Open 
source software enjoyed a reputation as being secure, because so many 
people were able to examine and test the source code for security flaws. 

121

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
However, flaws in commonly used open source software have burst that 
bubble, casting doubt into the security of all open source software.
✓
✓High cost of security tools: Good tools are available to identify many 
security flaws that give attackers the welcome mat. Some tools exam-
ine running programs; others examine source code. These tools can be 
expensive, and the engineers using them often command high salaries 
(which may be one reason why you’re reading this book).
✓
✓Increase in supply chain attacks: In the context of software develop-
ment, supply chain attacks include compromises of compilers, software 
libraries, and utilities that introduce security flaws into programs.
Cryptography
Cryptography is the art and science of hiding data in plain sight, and plays a 
key role in protecting data from onlookers and adversaries. In this section, 
you examine this mysterious craft and discover how it’s used to protect 
­sensitive data.
Although cryptography is often used as part of a complex system, it’s often 
easier to think of cryptography in isolation, in the simple-use case of a mes-
sage sent in plain sight from a sender to a receiver.

Basic concepts in cryptography
Encryption is the process of transforming plaintext into ciphertext, via an 
encryption algorithm and an encryption key. Decryption is the process of 
transforming ciphertext back into plaintext, again with an encryption algo-
rithm and the encryption key. In part, the strength of encryption is based on 
the key length (the number of characters that make up the encryption key) 
and the complexity of the encryption key.
An implementation of encryption and encryption keys is known as a crypto-
system. An attack on a cryptosystem is called cryptanalysis.
Most encryption algorithms employ a pseudorandom-number generator 
(PRNG), which is a technique for deriving a random number for use during 
encryption and decryption.
Types of encryption
The two basic ways to encrypt data are by block cipher and by stream 
cipher. Details follow:
✓
✓Block cipher: A block cipher encrypts and decrypts data in batches, or 
blocks. Block ciphers are prevalent on computers and on the Internet, 
where they encrypt hard drives and thumb drives, and protect data in 
transit with SSL and TLS. Notable block ciphers are
•	Advanced Encryption Standard (AES): Selected in 2001 by NIST 
(National Institute of Standards and Technology) to replace DES, 
AES is based on the Rijndael cipher and is in wide use today.
•	Data Encryption Standard (DES): The leading official encryption 
standard in use from 1977 through the early 2000s. DES was con-
sidered obsolete mostly because of its short key lengths.
•	Triple DES (3DES): Derived from DES, 3DES was essentially DES 
with a longer key length and, hence, more resistant to compromise 
than DES.
•	Blowfish: Developed in 1993, Blowfish was developed as an alter-
native to DES, which was nearly twenty years old. Blowfish is 
unpatented and in the public domain.
•	Serpent: Another public domain algorithm, Serpent was a finalist 
in the AES selection process.
✓
✓Stream cipher: A stream cipher encrypts a continuous stream of informa-
tion such as a video feed or an audio conversation. The most common 
stream cipher is RC4.

123

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
Block ciphers are most often used to encrypt Internet based “streaming”  
services. On the Internet, everything is transmitted in packets, which are 
individually encrypted using block ciphers.
Hashing, digital signatures, and digital certificates
Hashing is used to create a short, fixed-length message digest from a file or 
block of data; this is something like a fingerprint. Hashing is often used to 
verify the integrity and/or originator of a file. Common hashing algorithms 
include:
✓
✓MD-5 is a formerly popular hashing algorithm developed in 1992. It is 
now considered too weak for reliable use and obsolete.
✓
✓SHA-1 is another popular hashing algorithm that was determined in 2005 
to be too weak for continued use. By 2010, U.S. government agencies 
were required to replace SHA-1 with SHA-2.
✓
✓SHA-2 is a family of hashing algorithms including SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-
384, SHA-512, SHA-512/224, and SHA-512/256. These are all considered 
reliable for ongoing use.
A digital signature is a hashing operation carried out on a file. Depending  
on the implementation, the digital signature may be embedded in the file or 
separate from it. A digital signature is used to verify the originator of a file.
A digital certificate is an electronic document that consists of a personal or cor-
porate identifier, a public encryption key, and is signed by a certificate author-
ity (CA). The most common format for a digital certificate is known as X.509. 
The use of digital certificates and other tools such as strong authentication 
can lead to the failure for an individual to be able to plausibly deny involve-
ment with a specific transaction or event. This is known as non-repudiation.
Encryption keys
The two main types of encryption keys in use today are
✓
✓Symmetric key: Both the sender and the receiver have the same encryp-
tion key.
✓
✓Asymmetric key: Also known as public key cryptography, utilizes a pair 
of encryption keys — a public key and a private key. A user who creates 
a keypair would make the public key available widely and protect the 
private key as vigorously as one would protect a symmetric key.
Private keys and symmetric keys must be jealously guarded from adversar-
ies. Anyone who obtains a private or symmetric encryption key can decrypt 
any incoming encrypted message. The management and protection of 
encryption keys is known as key management.

124
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
Often, software programs employ passwords to protect encryption keys. 
Hence, the strength of the cryptosystem is only as strong as the password 
protecting its keys.
Attacks on cryptosystems
There are several types of attacks of a cryptosystem — mainly having to do 
with various opportunities that an attacker may be able to discover. They are
✓
✓Frequency analysis: An attacker analyzes ciphertext to see what pat-
terns regarding the frequency of occurrence of each character may lead 
to the discovery of the plaintext or the encryption key.
✓
✓Birthday attacks: An attack on a hashing algorithm, this is an attempt to 
develop messages that have the same hash value. The name “birthday 
attack” comes from the birthday paradox that states that out of a group 
of 23 or more randomly chosen people, a 50 percent chance exists that 
two of them share the same birthday.
✓
✓Known plaintext attack: The attacker possesses both plaintext and 
ciphertext and uses them in an attempt to discover the encryption key.
✓
✓Chosen ciphertext attack: The attacker can choose ciphertext, have it 
decrypted by the cryptosystem, and obtain the resulting plaintext.
✓
✓Ciphertext only attack: The attacker has only ciphertext and uses fre-
quency analysis and possibly other techniques in an attempt to discover 
the plaintext or the encryption key.
✓
✓Man-in-the-middle attack: An attacker is able to observe and potentially 
interfere with a session (or its initiation, where encryption keys may be 
exchanged).
✓
✓Replay attack: An attacker intercepts communications for playback 
later.
✓
✓Rubber hose attack: An attacker has access to someone in possession 
of encryption keys or other vital secrets about a targeted cryptosystem, 
and may use means of coercing those secrets.
✓
✓Social engineering: Face it: every system is vulnerable to attack if its 
owners or administrators can be tricked into providing vital information 
such as a password.
Encryption alternatives
Two techniques are available that provide some of the same features as a 
cryptosystem:
✓
✓Steganography (stego): A message is hidden in a larger file, such as an 
image file, a video, or sound file. Done properly, this technique can be as 
effective as encryption.

125

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
✓
✓Watermarking: A visible (or audible) imprint is added to a document, 
an image, a sound recording, or a video recording. Watermarking is a 
potentially powerful deterrent control because someone may not want 
to utilize an object with watermarking, which indicates that some other 
party owns the object.
Emerging issues in cryptography
Encryption is not a magic sleeping pill. Instead, there are numerous worries 
ranging from new types of attacks to official government misbehavior. Let’s 
take a look at what’s keeping security managers awake at night:
✓
✓Man-in-the-middle attacks: Many attacks on cryptosystems involve a 
man-in-the-middle attack at the onset of a quote-unquote secure com-
munications session. Flaws in session initiation and key exchange can 
result in the attacker being able to easily read all encrypted communica-
tions between two endpoints.
✓
✓Improper uses of cryptography: Cryptography, like any tool, is useful 
when used properly. Used improperly, cryptography gives us a false 
sense of security. Two examples are failing to salt (mixing in random 
numbers when calculating the hash of a plaintext message) when hash-
ing passwords, or failing to adequately protect an encryption key.
✓
✓Brute-force attacks: Advances in distributed computing are making it 
easier for adversaries to build massive parallel computing machines 
that can be used to attack cryptosystems. A brute-force attack employs 
fast computers to guess every possible combination until the correct 
one is found. To stave off these attacks, key lengths are getting longer 
and longer. However, these longer key lengths require more comput-
ing power when performing legitimate encryption and decryption. It’s a 
never-ending game of cat and mouse (in this case we are the mouse).
✓
✓Precompromised encryption algorithms: Revelations in 2012-2013 have 
revealed the plausibility that various government-spying organizations 
have been able to subvert the development and/or implementation of 
certain encryption algorithms and cryptosystems. The result is a serious 
crisis of trust in the cryptosystems used to protect sensitive information 
from adversaries.
✓
✓Persistent use of compromised cryptosystems: It’s a given that encryp-
tion algorithms have a limited “shelf life” before some technique for 
compromising them is revealed.

Physical and Environmental Security
Physical security is concerned with the protection of personnel at work 
locations, as well as information systems and related media and equipment. 
Supporting environmental controls and power protection are also a concern.
Basic concepts in physical and  
environmental security
This section discusses the most common concepts in security measures that 
are employed to protect personnel and equipment.
Site access security
Organizations should implement a level of site access security commensurate 
with the value of information and assets in the facility. The following types of 
controls contribute to the security of a work location, whether a facility is a 
data center or primarily used by employees:
✓
✓Key cards: Plastic cards with a magnetic strip, an RFID circuit, or an 
embedded processor and memory. Key cards are assigned to individual 
workers and are used to activate door locks to permit entry. With a key 
card system, a building can be divided into zones that restrict entry to 
specific areas or rooms as needed. Key card systems record successful 
and unsuccessful access attempts. Lost or stolen key cards can be deac-
tivated in the system so that they will no longer function.
✓
✓PIN pads: Keypads with numbers or letters usually used with key cards. 
PIN pads reduce the risk associated with a lost or stolen key card: On a 
door controlled by a key card reader and a PIN pad, both the key card 
and knowledge of the PIN are required to unlock the door.
✓
✓Biometric access controls: Devices such as fingerprint readers, palm 
scanners, and iris scanners. These biometric access controls can be 
used as a more effective site access control than key cards and PIN pads 
alone because an intruder could steal a key card and obtain a PIN code.
✓
✓Metal keys: Still used for individual offices, but no longer recommended 
for rooms where several personnel need to routinely enter because 
there is no way to know which person entered a room.
✓
✓Mantraps: A set of two interlocked doors with a short passage between, 
to control movement of personnel through a door. A mantrap permits 
only one person at a time to pass, thereby preventing “tailgating,” where 
one or more people can follow an authorized person into a room or 
building.

127

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
✓
✓Guards: Personnel with duties to protect facilities and personnel.
✓
✓Guard dogs: An effective deterrent that can assist in searches for per-
sons and in apprehending intruders.
✓
✓Visitor logs: Written or electronic records of visitors to a building. 
Visitors can also be requested to present a government-issued identifi-
cation to confirm their identity.
✓
✓Fences and walls: Deterrent and preventive measures to protect the 
perimeter of a facility or areas of particular interest. A fence or wall at 
least 8 feet high with strands of barbed wire or razor wire will keep out 
all but the most determined intruders.
✓
✓Video surveillance: Systems of cameras, monitors, and possibly record-
ing equipment such as digital video recorders (DVRs) used to monitor 
key locations inside and outside a facility. A video system may include 
personnel who are observing in real-time, or it may be recording for 
later viewing when needed.
✓
✓Exterior lighting: Protects a facility by illuminating areas where an 
intruder would otherwise be able to work in darkness in an attempt to 
enter a facility.
✓
✓Visible notices: Posted signs and placards informing personnel of the 
presence of video surveillance, guards, guard dogs, and other controls. 
Visible notices can also inform visitors of the consequences of entering 
a facility.

Secure siting
Secure siting, also known as a site survey, is a process of searching for and 
analyzing a work site for nearby hazards and threats that could pose a risk to 
the security or safety of a work site and the personnel and equipment within.
Typical hazards that a site survey would identify include the following:
✓
✓Transportation: nearby airports, railroads, and highways
✓
✓Hazardous substances: nearby chemical facilities and petroleum pipelines
✓
✓Behavioral: nearby sites where mass gatherings, riots, and demonstra-
tions could take place
✓
✓Natural: risk of flooding, landslide, avalanche, volcano, or lahar
Equipment protection
Measures need to be taken to protect equipment and personnel in work loca-
tions, including the following:
✓
✓Theft protection: locking doors, video surveillance, and cable locks
✓
✓Damage protection: earthquake bracing, and tip-over prevention
✓
✓Fire protection: smoke detectors, heat detectors, sprinklers, inert gas 
suppression, and fire extinguishers
✓
✓Cabling security: conduit or better siting to avoid exposure of communi-
cations or power cabling
✓
✓Photography: notices and intervention to prevent photography in 
­sensitive areas
Electric power
Information-processing equipment (computers, network devices, and so on) 
is highly sensitive to even slight fluctuations in electric power. The following 
specialized equipment ensures a continuous supply of clean electric power:
✓
✓Line conditioner: Absorbs noise present in utility power, such as spikes 
and surges.
✓
✓Uninterruptible power system (UPS): Equipped with backup batteries 
that can supply power to computing equipment from several minutes to 
an hour or more.
✓
✓Electric generator: Powered by gasoline, diesel fuel, natural gas, or pro-
pane and can generate electric power for hours, days, or more.

129

 Chapter 5: Key Technology Concepts
An electric generator and a UPS are typically used together to ensure con-
tinuous power. Because electric generators take several seconds to a minute 
or longer to activate, a UPS supplies power while the generator is starting up.
Many UPSs have built-in line conditioners, so standalone line conditioners are 
uncommon, except in environments where electric power is reliable but noisy.
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
People and information-processing equipment operate best within a narrow 
temperature and humidity range. (Humans are more tolerant of a wider range 
in temperature.)
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems regulate tempera-
ture and humidity in buildings containing personnel, computers, or both. 
HVAC systems are especially important in data centers, which generate a 
considerable amount of waste heat that must be continuously moved away 
from computers to prevent overheating and premature failure.
Many newer data centers rely on circulation of outside ambient air (with  
particulate filtering) as opposed to refrigeration to provide cooling at a  
significantly lower cost.
Redundant controls
Many facilities incorporate redundant controls to ensure continuous avail-
ability of environmental needs. Redundancy allows for continuous protection 
in the event of equipment failure as well as routine maintenance. Examples of 
redundant controls follow:
✓
✓Utility power feeds
✓
✓UPSs
✓
✓Generators
✓
✓HVAC systems
Emerging issues in physical and  
environmental security
Issues in the physical and environmental security realm that keep security 
professionals awake at night include the following:
✓
✓Use of cloud services: Organizations that adopt cloud services give up a 
large measure of control and visibility into the physical controls protect-
ing equipment that stores and processes their data. Some cloud service

providers do not readily provide detailed information that some organi-
zations may need for compliance purposes.
✓
✓Increased equipment density and available environmental controls: 
Newer servers and storage systems are constructed in smaller sizes, 
allowing for more servers and storage to be installed in a given area. 
Sometimes, however, data centers are unable to supply adequate power 
and cooling for this higher density equipment.

A
 
 fool with a tool is still a fool. The owner of a technology business once 
told this to his employees. Information technology and information 
security cannot succeed on tools alone but require business processes that 
manage their use.
This chapter is modeled after five of the ten categories in the Common Body 
of Knowledge (CBK) in the CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security 
Professional) certification. The five categories in this chapter are security 
management centric. The other five categories of the CISSP CBK are covered 
in Chapter 5.
For a deeper dive into the CISSP common body of knowledge, pick up a copy 
of CISSP For Dummies, 4th Edition.
It would be unwise to think of the topics in this chapter as strictly manage-
ment based, just as much as it would be to consider the topics in Chapter 5 
as strictly technology based. Management and technology are inseparable.
Information Security Governance and 
Risk Management
Management needs to be in control of its security systems, processes, and 
personnel. Governance is the approach that facilitates this control.
Risk management is the activity that reveals risks in the organization that 
must be dealt with. This section covers both topics. Common terms in secu-
rity governance and risk management

Basic concepts in security governance and 
risk management
In this section, you see how security managers and CISOs ensure that their 
security programs are successful.
Alignment to organization
For security management to be effective and relevant, an organization’s secu-
rity program and its mission, objectives, and goals must be aligned. The key 
reason for this is that security should be a business enabler, facilitating the 
organization’s efforts to fulfill its mission and achieve its objectives and goals.
Risk management
Risk management is the set of life-cycle activities that identify risks and take 
appropriate action with each. These activities follow:
✓
✓Risk assessment: A risk assessment is an up-close look at specific sys-
tems, processes, suppliers, or perhaps the entire organization. All plau-
sible risks are identified, and the following key characteristics for each 
risk estimated:
•	Probability: the likelihood that a given threat will be realized
•	Impact: the degree of influence on the organization when the threat 
is realized
•	Recovery effort: the effort required for the organization to recover 
from threat realization


 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
•	Asset value: The value of the asset, if the nature of threat realiza-
tion requires its replacement
•	Mitigating controls: Changes that can be made to reduce the prob-
ability, impact, or recovery effort
	
	Often, other characteristics about each risk will be identified, such as 
the person or group that would perform a recovery effort and implement 
mitigating controls.
	
	All risks identified in a risk assessment are collected in a risk ledger, 
which could be a simple spreadsheet or records in an information 
system designed to facilitate risk management processes. Such systems 
are called governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) systems.
✓
✓Risk treatment: When a risk assessment has been completed, manage-
ment has an important task ahead: to make formal decisions on what to 
do about each identified risk. Their choices are
•	Acceptance: Management (not just security management but busi-
ness management) decides that the level of risk is acceptable, and 
that nothing needs to be done to reduce the probability or impact 
of the identified risk.
•	Mitigation: Management chooses to implement something that will 
reduce the probability, impact, or recovery effort (or some combi-
nation) associated with a risk.
•	Avoidance: Management chooses to discontinue the activity asso-
ciated with the risk.
•	Transfer: Management decides to transfer the risk to another party, 
usually by purchasing an appropriate insurance policy, such as 
cyber risk insurance.
Organizations often perform risk treatment in a formal manner, even col-
lecting ink signatures from executives on the formal acceptance, mitigation, 
avoidance, or transfer of risk. Security management often does this to for-
mally document executives saying “yes this risk is okay,” which may be par-
ticularly useful later on if a security breach occurs.
Rarely is all risk removed from an item in a risk ledger. Any leftover risk after 
applying risk treatment is known as residual risk. Residual risk is itself a risk 
item that requires treatment — usually it is accepted.
Many instances of risk treatment involve a blend of acceptance, mitigation, 
avoidance, and transfer.

Security governance
Governance is the set of activities performed by management to exert control 
over the organization. In the context of information security, governance 
means enacting policies, standards, guidelines, procedures, and controls to 
ensure that desired outcomes are met.
✓
✓Policies: Formal statements that describe what actions and behaviors 
are required, and which are forbidden, in an organization. Following are 
some example policy statements:
•	Employees shall not share login credentials with any other persons 
inside or outside the organization.
•	Employees shall not use personally owned devices for storing, pro-
cessing, or managing company information without management 
approval.
✓
✓Standards: Formal statements that describe how security policy will be 
carried out. For example, an organization may develop documents that 
state which brands of hardware or software will be used, and how sys-
tems, devices, and programs will be configured.
✓
✓Guidelines: Statements that provide ideas on how policies and stan-
dards may be implemented.
✓
✓Processes and procedures: Step-by-step descriptions of work activities 
carried out by various personnel in the organization.
✓
✓Controls: Specific instances of policies, standards, and key steps in pro-
cesses and procedures that management has determined are essential for 
the proper operation and security of business processes and information 
systems.
Internal and external audit
Organizations in many industries are subject to external audits, as well as 
required to perform internal audits. The purpose of an audit is to assess the 
effectiveness of an organization’s policies, standards, and controls.
An audit may or may not include an examination of information systems, 
including their configurations, programs, and access permissions.
Data classification
Data classification is a set of standards, procedures, and controls to ensure 
the proper handling of sensitive information. Data classification is usually 
implemented by defining levels of sensitivity, along with detailed explanations 
on permitted and required handling of data at each level.

135

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
For instance, an organization might implement four levels of data classifica-
tions: public, confidential, secret, and top secret. For each level, specific 
procedures will exist for handling of data for various common activities such 
as email, storage on a workstation, transmission over the Internet, and trans-
mission by FAX.
The intention of data classification is the protection of information at a level 
corresponding to its sensitivity. It would be a waste of resources to protect 
all internal information as though it were top secret. On the other hand, pro-
tecting all information as confidential would not adequately protect the most 
sensitive information.
Personnel security
Personnel security represents the set of security-related activities that take 
place throughout the employee life cycle. These activities include
✓
✓Screening: A background check to ensure that the candidate’s employ-
ment history, education, and professional licenses are verified, and that 
the candidate is free of unwanted criminal convictions.
✓
✓Onboarding: The employee signs documents, including nondisclosure, 
intellectual property, noncompete, and security policy acknowledge-
ment, documents. Other essential activities include security awareness 
training and instruction on other policies.
✓
✓Periodic assessment: Annual re-affirmation of compliance to security 
policy and other key policies.
✓
✓Transfer and promotion: Completion of onboarding activities required 
for new positions (for example, a more thorough background check for 
someone in senior management).
✓
✓Termination: Return of all hardware and information assets, reaffirmation 
of nondisclosure, intellectual property, and other agreements.
Employment laws, as well as security and privacy laws and standards, 
require that the preceding activities be enacted through formal written pro-
cesses and procedures and include detailed recordkeeping.
Security awareness training
Training personnel on security policies, procedures, and safe computing is 
an essential part of every organization’s overall defense against harmful secu-
rity incidents. Known as security awareness training, employees are educated 
on the organization’s security policies and practices.
Many laws and regulations require security awareness training, so organiza-
tions usually need to keep accurate records on who has received this training.
www.allitebooks.com

136
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
Many security awareness training programs include quizzes, to ensure that 
employees understand what is expected and to provide a record that each 
employee fully understood the organization’s policies.
Other concepts
Several security-related concepts are part of every security professional’s 
vocabulary. These concepts guide you on the proper management security 
issues you’ll encounter:
✓
✓CIA Triad: Confidentiality, integrity, and availability — the three pillars of 
security. Everything the InfoSec profession does to protect an organiza-
tion’s assets and information comes down to these.
✓
✓Defense in depth: A strategy for protecting important assets by sur-
rounding them with layered defenses. For example, sensitive written 
records can be stored in a locking cabinet, which is located in a locked 
office, which is in a locked building. An intruder would need to defeat 
several defenses to successfully reach the protected asset.
✓
✓Single point of failure: Systems or teams in which a key component has 
no backup or alternative path. For example, a public-facing website may 
have redundant routers, servers, databases, and storage systems, but 
only a single firewall. The firewall is a single point of failure because the 
entire system would fail if the firewall failed.
✓
✓Fail open/fail closed: The result of a control if it fails. For example, a 
security door might become locked (fail closed) or unlocked (fail open) 
during a power failure.
Emerging issues in security governance 
and risk management
A lot of things keep security managers awake at night, besides too much 
coffee during the day. Noteworthy issues are discussed here.
Managing contractors and other temporary workers
Many organizations do a pretty good job of managing the onboarding and 
offboarding of employees but come up short when handling the same activi-
ties for their external consultants, contractors, and temporary workers. As a 
result, for example, computer user accounts or building access cards might 
not be locked when temporary workers leave the organization.

137

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
Managing suppliers and business partners
Organizations are discovering that a chain is only as strong as its weakest 
link. Often this weak link is an external organization that has access to infor-
mation systems or work facilities, particularly where an external entity’s 
security is not as good as the organization itself. Several notable security 
breaches have occurred through the exploitation of weaknesses in a sup-
plier’s organization.
Security Architecture and Design
Security architecture and design is a catchall category in information secu-
rity that includes several topics, including computer architecture and secu-
rity models, computer operating systems, and the process of accrediting and 
certifying systems for use.
Basic concepts in security  
architecture and design
The concepts in security architecture and design range from abstract secu-
rity protection models to the design of modern computers and operating sys-
tems. This mix of topics is eclectic but essential for security professionals.

Security protection models
Security models are simple representations of security controls that help us 
understand methods for implementing security controls, and to better under-
stand controls in an existing system. The models that are cited most often 
are listed here, with a very brief explanation on how it works:
✓
✓Bell LaPadula: People can read documents at or below their level of 
security, and write documents at or above their level of security.
✓
✓Biba: People can read documents only at their level of security, and 
write documents at or above their level of security.
✓
✓Clark-Wilson: A rebuttal to Bell LaPadula and Biba, Clark-Wilson is a 
somewhat elaborate scheme for creating and protecting sensitive infor-
mation.
✓
✓Access matrix: A two-dimensional matrix that defines the persons or 
groups permitted to access specific data or systems.
✓
✓Multilevel: A system will contain information at more than one security 
level. People can read information at or below their security level.
✓
✓Mandatory access control (MAC): An access manager manages access 
to information.
✓
✓Discretionary access control (DAC): The owners of individual docu-
ments or folders manage access to information.
✓
✓Role-based access control (RBAC): Access is assigned to groups of 
users instead of individual users.
✓
✓Noninterference: Activities performed by persons at a higher level of 
security will not interfere with activities performed at lower levels of 
security.
✓
✓Information flow: Information at specific levels of security are permit-
ted to flow to specific systems or locations.
The preceding models are not exclusive. Instead, a system’s method of 
access control may involve more than one of the models described here.
Information security professionals often use the terms subject and object 
when discussing security protection models and access controls. A subject 
is a person or system that may attempt to access an object, which could be a 
system, file, or record in a database.
System evaluation models
Many information systems manage sensitive information or perform sensitive 
functions. It can be difficult to know what security characteristics should be 

139

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
part of the design of such systems. Thus, several frameworks for the inclu-
sion of security in systems have been developed, including the following:
✓
✓Common criteria: A framework for the specification, implementation, 
and evaluation of a system against a set of security requirements
✓
✓SEI-CMMI (Software Engineering Institute — Capability Maturity Model 
Integration): A model for assessing the maturity of an organization’s 
security practices
✓
✓SSE-CMM (Systems Security Engineering Capability Maturity Model): A 
model for evaluating an organization’s capability to implement security 
in a system
Certification and accreditation
Because information systems are constructed to perform important func-
tions, several methodologies are used to evaluate systems for their suitability 
to perform those functions. These methodologies include the practices of cer-
tification (performing the actual evaluation of a system) and accreditation (the 
administrative approval to begin or continue use of a system). These models 
include the following:
✓
✓DIACAP (Department of Defense Information Assurance Certification 
and Accreditation): Used to certify and accredit military systems
✓
✓NIACAP (National Information Assurance Certification and 
Accreditation Process): Used to certify and accredit U.S. national secu-
rity systems
✓
✓DCID 6/3 (Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/3): Used to cer-
tify and accredit systems in use by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
✓
✓FEDRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program): 
A framework for security assessments, authorization, and continuous 
monitoring for cloud-based security providers
The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) is the 
federal law that requires all U.S. federal government systems to comply with 
security standards and evaluation practices.
Computer hardware architecture
Security professionals need to understand how computer hardware func-
tions, so that they can ensure that they are properly protected. Modern  
computers are made up of the following components:
✓
✓CPU (central processing unit): The component where computer instruc-
tions are executed and calculations performed
✓
✓Main storage: The component where information is stored temporarily. 
Often known as RAM (random access memory), main storage is usually 
www.allitebooks.com

140
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
volatile and its contents are lost if power is removed or the computer is 
turned off.
✓
✓Secondary storage: The component — typically a hard drive or a 
solid-state drive (SSD) — where information is stored permanently. 
Information stored here is persistent even when the computer is 
switched off. Secondary storage is often organized into one or more file 
systems, which are schemes for the storage and retrieval of individual 
files.
✓
✓Bus: The component where data and instructions flow internally among 
the CPU, main storage, secondary storage, and externally through 
peripheral devices and communications adaptors. Popular bus archi-
tectures include SCSI (small computer systems interface) SATA (serial 
ATA), IEEE1394 (also known as FireWire), and USB (universal serial bus).
✓
✓Firmware: Software stored in persistent memory. Firmware is generally 
used to store initial instructions that are executed when the computer is 
switched on.
✓
✓Communications: Components for external communications, including 
network adaptors (for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth) and display adap-
tors (for computers with human interfaces). Most computers include 
one or more communication components — otherwise, how would you 
get problems into it and results out of it?
✓
✓Security hardware: Components for various security functions, such as 
a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which is used to store and generate 
cryptographic keys, smart card readers, and fingerprint scanners. Some 
computers include specialized security hardware.
Computer operating system
A computer operating system (OS) consists of the set of programs that facili-
tate the operation of application programs and tools on computer hardware. 
The components of an OS include the kernel (the core software that com-
municates with the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices), device drivers 
(which facilitate the use of bus devices and peripheral devices), and tools 
(used by administrators to manage resources such as available disk space).
The main functions performed by an operating system are
✓
✓Process management: Processes are the individual programs that run 
on a computer. The OS starts and stops processes and makes sure they 
do not interfere with each other.
✓
✓Resource management: The OS allocates and manages the use of main 
storage, secondary storage, communications, and attached devices.
✓
✓Access management: The OS manages authentication as well as access 
to resources such as files and directories in secondary storage.

141

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
✓
✓Event management: The OS responds to events such as the insertion or 
removal of media and devices, keystrokes, or mouse movements.
✓
✓Communications management: The OS manages communications to 
ensure that incoming and outgoing communications are handled and 
routed properly.
An operating system can run directly on computer hardware or through a 
scheme called virtualization, in which many separate copies of operating 
systems can run simultaneously on a computer. In virtualization, the main 
controlling program is called the hypervisor, and each running OS is called a 
guest. The hypervisor’s jobs are to allocate computer hardware resources to 
each guest and to prevent guests from interfering with each other.
Software threats and countermeasures
Intruders attack software systems to interfere with or take over those  
systems in many ways. Some of the attack methods, along with their  
countermeasures, follow:
✓
✓Covert channel attack: A hidden communications channel exists in an 
existing communications channel, in an attempt to make the hidden 
communications undetectable. Countermeasures include the use of sniff-
ers, packet analyzers, and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect 
anomalies in communications.
✓
✓State attack: Exploiting a timing flaw in a system. Also known as a race 
condition, a state attack can be used to gain access to a resource used 
by another process. Countermeasures include source code scans and 
reviews to detect such flaws in programs.
✓
✓Side channel attack: Observing a system’s running states to make infer-
ences about activities in the system. An attacker can use this information-
gathering method to compromise a system. Countermeasures include 
logical or physical shielding to thwart observations.
✓
✓Emanation: Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) emitted from a computer 
system provides valuable information about the system. At times, ema-
nations can include sensitive data that is being processed by a system. 
Countermeasures include shielding to prevent the emission of EMR.
✓
✓Back door: A feature in a program that gives someone covert access to 
the program. Typically, a programmer will put back doors into programs 
during testing but may forget to remove them all when the program is 
ready for production use. Back doors can be discovered and exploited by 
intruders. Programmers with malicious intent can create back doors as a 
means of illicitly accessing the program. Countermeasures include code 
reviews to detect back doors and packet analyzers to detect their use.

Emerging issues in security  
architecture and design
Issues that tend to keep security professionals from getting a good night’s 
sleep include the following:
✓
✓Internet of Things (IoT): We worry that insufficient work is put into 
developing sound security models and designs to prevent attacks in new 
Internet-connected products that.
✓
✓Speed to market: Many organizations, in attempts to get newly devel-
oped products to market more quickly, skip security designs, reviews, 
and controls, thereby leaving products open to attack.
✓
✓Flawed access control: Many organizations lack the skills to implement 
sound, effective access controls in their systems, resulting in unneces-
sary exposure of sensitive data.
Security Operations
Security operations — also known as SecOps — is another category of infor-
mation security that contains many separate concepts and topics, all having 
to do with security’s support of the operations of information systems.

activities are operational, security professionals at all levels need to be famil-
iar with these concepts.
Operations terminology
Several key terms fit best in the security operations category, including the 
following:
✓
✓Separation of duties: High-value operations need to be split into tasks 
performed by different individuals or departments. The classic example 
is privileged access requests: One person requests it, another approves 
it, and yet another provides it. No one person should be able to do any 
two or all three.
✓
✓Least privilege: The concept of least privilege states that people (and 
machines) should have the lowest possible level of privilege required 
to perform required tasks. Although it’s easier to give everyone higher 
privilege levels, doing so diminishes the need to keep things well pro-
tected and gives intruders greater advantages.
✓
✓Need to know: The concept of need-to-know states that people should 
have access to only the information (and systems) they need to do their 
job. For example, just because someone has administrator privileges on 
one system doesn’t mean the person should have it on all systems.
✓
✓Job rotation: Organizations periodically move people from role to role 
for many reasons, including staving off boredom, cross-training, and 
deterring individuals from abusing their privileges (because it might be 
discovered by someone rotating into their job).
✓
✓Special privileges monitoring: Because administrative privileges pro-
vide powerful capabilities for system, network, and database administra-
tors are so much greater than other people, many organizations choose 
to monitor their activities on computers more closely, even to the point 
of monitoring and logging every command they issue to systems.
Continuous monitoring
The velocity of harmful events has accelerated to a point where data review of 
incident logs is no longer an effective means of detecting unwanted ­behavior. 
Besides, the volume of available log data (gigabytes in the smallest organiza-
tions and terabytes in larger ones) is too great for humans to review.
Organizations must centralize their logging. All devices and systems should 
send their log data to a purpose-built central repository, called a security 
incident and event management (SIEM) system. But more than that, organiza-
tions need tools that not only detect serious security events but also alert 
key personnel and even remediate the incident in seconds instead of weeks 
or months as is often the case.

Records management
Records management refers to a family of business processes used to manage 
and protect business records in an organization. Several security-related  
disciplines in records are of particular interest to information security  
professionals:
✓
✓Data classification: Organizations define sensitive levels for information, 
with handling procedures at each level. Enforcement is difficult because 
compliance is voluntary.
✓
✓Access management: The broad topic in which organizations establish 
access management processes to control who has access to what data, 
functions, and systems.
✓
✓Data retention: Based on business need and regulations, organizations 
establish minimum and maximum retention times for various types of 
data. In the absence of specific guidance, the best rule is to keep it long 
enough but not too long: Data is both an asset as well as a liability.
✓
✓Data loss prevention: Organizations need to ensure that sensitive data 
is adequately protected. Static and dynamic tools can find sensitive data 
living where it shouldn’t and observe (and perhaps block) the data when 
leaving the environment when that departure is not a part of routine 
business operations.
✓
✓Backup: Hardware problems, software problems, and disasters of many 
kinds make organizations wish they had a backup copy of critical infor-
mation. Most organizations routinely copy important data to backup 
media or servers in some remote location.
✓
✓Data destruction: After data is no longer needed, it needs to be 
destroyed so that unauthorized parties cannot recover it.
Antimalware
Antimalware, antivirus, and advanced malware protection (AMP) refer to 
tools designed to detect and block malware infections and malware activities.
Organizations often combat malware by having several layers of control in 
place (known as a defense in depth), including the following:
✓
✓Workstation antimalware: The front lines of the malware wars, every 
workstation (and even mobile devices) should have antimalware to 
block malware.
✓
✓Server antimalware: File servers and other systems used to store pro-
grams and files should have antimalware, just in case malware sneaks 
through a workstation.

145

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
✓
✓Email server antimalware: Email is a favored transportation route for 
malware, so blocking it at email servers is a good way to keep it from 
reaching workstations.
✓
✓Spam filtering: Because many attacks come in the form of phishing, 
spam filters can be effective at blocking most or all phishing messages.
✓
✓Website filtering: These appliances block access to websites based 
on category (generally not having to do with business operations) and 
block websites known to be compromised with malware.
The recent potency of malware is leading many organizations to enact 
more controls in the form of intrusion prevention systems, which block the 
­command-and-control traffic associated with malware.
Remote access
Remote access is both the business process as well as the technology that 
facilitates an employee’s ability to remotely access information systems that 
are not accessible from the Internet.
In the business process sense, many organizations permit only a subset of 
their workers to remotely access the internal environment. In the technical 
sense, remote access usually includes encryption of all communications, as 
well as two-factor authentication to make it harder for an attacker to gain 
access to internal systems.
The fact that many systems are opting to use cloud-based systems instead 
of internal systems makes some aspects of remote access obsolete. Or, to 
put it another way, cloud-based systems turn everyone into remote workers 
because their information systems are no longer located in their internal net-
works.
Incident management
Incident management is an IT operations process used to properly respond 
to operational and security incidents. Organizations should have written 
incident response plans along with training and testing to ensure that these 
plans are accurate and that personnel understand how to follow them. 
Written playbooks for common incidents should be developed.
Security incidents are just a special type of incident management, requiring 
a few additional considerations such as regulatory requirements and privacy 
laws.
www.allitebooks.com

146
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
The steps in a mature incident management process are
✓
✓Declaration
✓
✓Triage
✓
✓Investigation
✓
✓Analysis
✓
✓Containment
✓
✓Recovery or mitigation or both
✓
✓Debriefing
Not all security incidents require all these steps, but this framework ensures 
an orderly and coordinated response to reduce the scope and effect of an 
incident, and a debriefing and follow-up activities to reduce the likelihood or 
effect of a similar incident in the future.
Vulnerability management
Vulnerability management is an IT operations process concerned with the 
identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities in IT systems. An effective vul-
nerability management process includes procedures for identifying vulnera-
bilities, prioritizing them, and making changes (through change management) 
to eliminate vulnerabilities that could be used by an intruder to successfully 
attack the environment.
Change management
Change management is a basic IT operations process concerned with the 
management and control of changes made in IT systems. A proper change 
management process has formal steps of request, review, approval, execu-
tion, verification, and recordkeeping. The purpose of change control is the 
discussion of proposed changes before they take place, so that risks and 
other issues can surface.
All process and procedures, including those in incident management, vulnera-
bility management, and change management, should be formally documented.
Emerging issues in security operations
Yes, many issues in the world of security operations keep security managers 
awake at night.
Advanced malware
Innovations in malware packaging have rendered antivirus and antimalware 
software virtually ineffective against advanced malware. Additional layers of 

147

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
detection and prevention tools are needed to combat the threat. These tools 
have significant costs in terms of capital as well as manpower to maintain them.
The greatest fear is that malware creators will soon develop new ways of cir-
cumventing even advanced malware prevention (AMP) tools, thereby requir-
ing even greater investment in effective defenses.
Rapid incident response
Organizations typically become aware of security incidents weeks or months 
after their occurrence. However, these incidents are often orchestrated at 
such great speed that effective incident response is now measured in min-
utes or even seconds. The increase in attack velocity requires a paradigm 
shift in the way that organizations monitor their environments and the tools 
they use to detect and respond to incidents.
Bring your own device (BYOD)
With employees in so many organizations bringing personally owned devices 
to work for use in their daily job duties, organizations are finding it more dif-
ficult than ever to keep track of sensitive data and know when that data is 
leaving its control.
Use of cloud services
The mass migration to cloud-based services challenges organizations to adapt 
their security operations to maintain sufficient visibility and control over their 
technology operations. Cloud service providers perform some security opera-
tions functions, which are not necessarily visible to customers. Therefore, 
understanding the complete coverage of protective controls can be difficult.
Business Continuity and Disaster 
Recovery Planning
Disasters, natural and man-made, occur with alarming unpredictability, 
throwing organizations in their paths into chaos. Sometimes, the organiza-
tion doesn’t survive or retains only a shadow of its former self. Much can 
be done to reduce the potency of disasters, giving organizations a far better 
chance of survival.
Disaster recovery planning (DRP) and business continuity planning (BCP) 
may not seem as though they should be part of information security. 
However, the core information security concept of confidentiality, integrity, 
and availability (CIA) does include DRP and BCP as a vital activity to ensure 
the availability of key systems in an organization.
www.allitebooks.com

148
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
Basic concepts in business continuity and 
disaster recovery planning
BCP and DRP have their own array of concepts that are essential to informa-
tion security professionals. Even if you don’t anticipate working in the BCP or 
DRP space, familiarity with these concepts may lead you or your organization 
to opportunities to improve disaster preparedness.
Types of disasters
Several types of man-made and natural disasters have a direct or an indirect 
effect on organizations. The types of disasters include the following:
✓
✓Natural:
•	Weather: hurricane, tornado, ice storm, blizzard, or heavy rain
•	Geological: earthquake, tsunami, volcano, landslide, avalanche, or 
sinkhole
•	Other: pandemic, forest or range fire, flood, or solar storm
✓
✓Man-made:
•	Social or political: war, riot, demonstration, or strike
•	Utilities: utility outage or fuel shortage
•	Material: hazardous material spill or radioactive materials leak

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
These and other types of disasters can have a direct or an indirect effect on 
organizations, including the following:
✓
✓Interruptions in transportation
✓
✓Communications outages
✓
✓Workforce shortage
Business continuity planning and disaster recovery planning
Two primary activities take place after a disaster strikes:
✓
✓Continuation of business processes using alternate facilities, equipment, 
or personnel, which is the purview of Business Continuity Planning 
(BCP)
✓
✓Salvage of buildings and equipment, and restoration of primary work 
facilities, which is the purview of Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP)
These two activities are both concerned with getting the organization back 
on its feet after a disaster. Both are needed for the long-term survival of the 
organization.
Business impact assessment (BIA)
A business impact assessment (BIA) is a special type of risk assessment that 
is performed periodically to determine two key things: the most critical busi-
ness processes in the organization, and the resources and dependencies 
on other business processes that the key processes rely on for continuous 
operation.
Upon completion, a BIA generally portrays the most important business pro-
cesses in order of criticality (the most critical processes are listed first).
For each critical process, the maximum tolerable downtime (MTD) value is 
identified. MTD is the greatest amount of time that a business process can 
be incapacitated before the organization’s survival is at risk. The value of an 
MTD is difficult to determine and therefore highly judgmental.
Security professionals can derive value from the BIA by understanding which 
processes and underlying systems are the most important in an organization. 
Those systems will be the ones requiring the best protection.
Recovery targets
After identifying the most important business processes and systems in the 
BIA, the organization needs to establish recovery targets. These are the time 
www.allitebooks.com

150
Part II: Having the Right Stuff 
intervals required to get processes and IT systems running again. The recov-
ery targets are as follows:
✓
✓Recovery time objective (RTO): Expressed as minutes, hours, or days, 
the period of time from disaster onset until the process or system is 
operational. The value of MTD should drive the RTO value.
✓
✓Recovery point objective (RPO): Expressed as minutes, hours, or days, 
the period of maximum data loss after a disaster strikes. For instance, if 
an organization wants to lose no more than one hour’s worth of transac-
tions, the RPO would be one hour.
✓
✓Recovery consistency objective (RCO): Expressed as the measure of 
integrity and consistency in data in the emergency operations system 
compared to the original production system. RCO is a percent value 
that is expressed as 1 minus (number of inconsistent entries) divided by 
(number of entries).
✓
✓Recovery capacity objective (RCapO): Expressed as a percentage, the 
capacity of temporary processing systems compared to production 
systems.
Often, an organization will determine that a given system does not have suf-
ficient resilience to successfully meet the recovery objectives after a disas-
ter. In this case, the organization must change its recovery objectives to less 
ambitious figures or invest in equipment and processes that will facilitate 
recovery within targets.
Contingency planning
Organizations need to develop written contingency plans that personnel can 
follow when a disaster occurs. These contingency plans should include the 
following considerations:
✓
✓Primary operations personnel may be unwilling or unable to assist in the 
continuation and recovery of critical systems.
✓
✓Personnel who will be following contingency plans may have less famil-
iarity with these processes and systems.
Testing contingency plans
To determine the quality of contingency plans, organizations should peri-
odically test them. These tests, which should include primary and backup 
personnel, may also serve as training, which helps these personnel better 
understand the procedures that should be followed during a disaster.

151

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
There are five types of tests:
✓
✓Document review: Personnel read through contingency planning docu-
ments, and note any errors or omissions they find.
✓
✓Walkthrough: Personnel review contingency planning documents in 
group sessions, noting errors and omissions they find.
✓
✓Simulation: A scripted disaster is recited to personnel, who respond as 
though a real disaster is taking place.
✓
✓Parallel test: Recovery systems are activated and process live data but 
in isolation so as not to disturb production systems that are still run-
ning. A parallel test helps test workload and whether recovery systems 
work properly.
✓
✓Cutover test: Production systems are shut down or disconnected, and 
recovery systems are activated to manage live workload. This test is a 
complete end-to-end test of the capacity and integrity of the recovery 
system. If a cutover test fails, it can mean that the systems being tested 
stop working, resulting in key business processes grinding to a halt.
Emerging issues in business continuity  
and disaster recovery planning
Two of the most important issues keeping security professionals awake at 
night follow:
✓
✓Complex distributed systems: Organizations are relying more on distrib-
uted systems (including cloud-based services) that have a higher degree 
of interconnectivity. It can be more difficult to develop contingency 
plans that involve resilience improvements when one or more critical 
components of a system are owned and operated by another organiza-
tion.
✓
✓Cloud services: Organizations that employ cloud services have far less 
direct physical control over their cloud-based processing systems, 
making the development of contingency plans, as well as testing, more 
complicated. Cloud service providers may or may not have their own 
disaster recovery and business continuity plans.

Legal, Regulations, Investigations,  
and Compliance
Because of their integral role in supporting business processes, information 
systems are in the crosshairs of laws and regulations. Computers are fre-
quently involved in civil and criminal investigations, requiring forensic proce-
dures when collecting evidence from computers and other electronic devices.
Basic concepts in legal, regulations,  
investigations, and compliance
Even though security professionals are not attorneys, they must understand 
the laws, regulations, and other legal requirements that drive compliance 
efforts in organizations. Likewise, security professionals need to know how 
security investigations should be conducted. This is fun stuff!
Computer crime laws
Many countries have enacted computer crime laws that define trespass, 
theft, and privacy in the context of information systems. In the history of law, 
computers are still new, and the development of laws is ongoing and chang-
ing frequently.
This high frequency in changes of laws, regulations, and legal standards pres-
ents a challenge to information security and legal professionals as they strive 
to be compliant with these laws and also to recognize cybercrimes when they 
occur.

 Chapter 6: Key Management Concepts
Managing compliance
Compliance is a matter of adhering to laws, regulations, contractual obli-
gations, and policies. It takes a determined effort to know all compliance 
obligations in an organization, and more effort to achieve compliance. Many 
organizations develop or adopt a framework of controls to track compliance 
on an ongoing basis. Suitable frameworks include
✓
✓COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology): 
Developed by ISACA, COBIT is a highly regarded framework for IT opera-
tions.
✓
✓COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission): Developed as a result of financial accounting scandals in 
the 1990s, COSO provides guidance for IT control frameworks for U.S. 
publicly traded companies.
✓
✓ISO27002:2013: The international standard for information security 
management, which establishes a process of controls development and 
management
Security investigations and forensics
Security investigations are an organization’s response to isolated security 
incidents that have little direct effect on business operations. Still, the events 
requiring investigation can be important in other ways because they can 
have significant legal implications.
Any event that takes place in an organization in the context of computers 
where possible future legal action is involved may require an investigation 
with forensic rules of evidence in play. These rules include
✓
✓Evidence collection and preservation
✓
✓Evidence chain of custody
✓
✓Evidence collection recordkeeping
✓
✓Evidence examination recordkeeping
For an organization to prevail in any related legal proceedings, it is important 
that these forensic procedures be carried out by a trained individual with 
dedicated tools and hardware.

Emerging issues in legal, regulations, 
investigations, and compliance
The issues keeping security professionals awake at night include these:
✓
✓Rapid onset of new laws and regulations: New laws on computer opera-
tions, security and privacy are enacted and updated at a rate that makes 
it hard to keep up on their details, never mind figure out how to be com-
pliant with them.
✓
✓Jurisdictional issues: Many new laws have greater jurisdictional reach 
than in the past. For example, privacy laws in many U.S. states have 
jurisdiction across state lines, and international privacy laws affect 
many organizations not located in countries that passed the laws. These 
jurisdictional issues are all about cross-border privacy, where each 
country passes laws requiring the protection of private data associated 
with its citizens, applicable regardless of the location of the organization 
that has the data. This issue has many corporate counsels on a steady 
diet of coffee and Rolaids.

ecurity consultants have an opportunity to help not just a single employer 
but many organizations during their professional career. Working as 
a consultant is different from working in an organization, where you have 
responsibilities only to your employer and its internal operations. As a consul-
tant, you won’t be putting down roots in a single organization (other than the 
consulting firm itself); instead, you’ll be moving from place to place.
Consulting is fast-paced and highly rewarding but also unpredictable and 
stressful. If you are considering a position as a consultant, check out this 
chapter for the pros and cons.
Is Consulting Right for You?
In the 1960s, the original Mission Impossible TV series always started with a 
taped message to Mr. Phelps, who was given a life-and-death, world-peace-
at-stake assignment in some remote corner of the world. Against all odds, 
Phelps and his team would overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles 
and prevail.
Consulting is a lot like the Mission Impossible missions. From one consulting 
gig to the next, you never know what kind of work, people, or company you’ll 
encounter. Some assignments will be boring, others highly challenging, and 
others rewarding — for a variety of reasons.

Part III: Finding a Job with the Right Organization 
Consulting is fundamentally different from many other jobs. Take a look at 
the following questions. Are you okay with a job where you
✓
✓May travel from 25 to 75 percent of the time, away from home for days 
or even weeks at a time?
✓
✓Work with different people from day to day or week to week?
✓
✓Won’t know what city you’ll be in a week or a month from now?
✓
✓Are expected to be a seasoned expert but won’t know what expertise 
you’ll have to call on a day, week, or month from now?
✓
✓Help build something but will not be around to see how successful it 
could become?
✓
✓Sometimes work for people whom you’ll meet only by phone?
✓
✓Aren’t around long enough to form deep relationships with the people 
you work alongside?
If you answered “Yes” to most or all of these questions, consulting may be 
right for you. In the rest of this chapter, you find out more about working in a 
consulting organization or as an independent consultant.
Consulting workload
Consulting is hard work — very hard work — for a variety of reasons. Let’s 
take a closer look at the four major factors that will always try to take you 
down in a consulting job:
✓
✓Intellectual fatigue: As a consultant, you’re expected to be profession-
ally superior to the client organization with which you’ll be working.
✓
✓Performance fatigue: Because you’re in front of clients, you have to be 
on your A-game all the time. Your clients expect a professional polish 
from a high-priced consultant; whenever you speak, all eyes and ears 
will be focused on you. You might feel as though you’re on stage all day, 
every day.
✓
✓Physical fatigue: You’ll probably travel a lot, living out of your suitcase, 
eating in restaurants, and working evenings. You might not take the time 
for physical exercise while on business travel or working long hours.
✓
✓Multitasking fatigue: Often, you won’t be able to concentrate only on 
the project right in front of you. You may be drafting security reports for 
clients you met recently, and reading documents from a client you’ll be 
working with next week or next month.

159

 Chapter 7: Life as a Security Consultant
Appearance and approach
As a consultant, you are often the face of the consulting firm (or your own 
company, if you’re an independent consultant). The client is paying big bucks 
for your expertise. You should always behave, dress, and communicate in a 
bit more professional manner than the client employees (without seeming 
arrogant).
Even when working for a consulting firm, you have some responsibility for 
sales — your day-to-day actions, customer service, and exhibited expertise 
Consulting requires social skills
One of the things that you always come up 
against when working as a security consul-
tant is the desire for absolutes. “If I buy this 
firewall/antivirus/new device, I’ll be 100 per-
cent secure, right?” Or worse, “I thought that 
if I bought that firewall/antivirus/new device, 
I’d be 100 percent secure, right?” Of course, 
there’s no such thing as 100 percent in security.
Being any kind of IT consultant is only 
20 percent tech and 80 percent social skills. 
If you’re not prepared (or just don’t want) to 
respond to questions like these, take a differ-
ent job path.
Marc Gordon, Seattle
Confidence as a consultant
You have to come into a room confident that you 
know what you are talking about and always 
ready to listen to the customers and their con-
cerns. You have to be able roll with the mate-
rial you have to work with and understand that 
everyone’s level of risk tolerance — what they 
are willing or not willing to do — is different.
Since you are not a member of the staff or the 
team you are working with, the trust level is 
different and you have to spend a lot of time 
justifying why you need to see what you need 
to see. Then you have to build security models, 
perform risk assessments, or troubleshoot 
security in a way that aligns with a business 
you may not know a lot about. You also have 
to understand that you will be spending a lot of 
time educating people about security, security 
controls, and other information related to the 
industry.

all help your consulting firm maintain their reputation with the client, and 
your success and professionalism will be shared with other companies and 
clients. You must always be mindful of keeping your eyes and ears open for 
possibilities of add-on work or new business avenues with a client.
Working for a Consulting Firm
Working in a consulting firm can be a lot like working in a traveling circus. 
You’ll have your circus colleagues but the scenery changes as you move from 
town to town (or client to client).
A job in a consulting firm will probably allow you to spend most of your time 
assisting other organizations with various aspects of their security manage-
ment or operations. Chances are, marketing people and sales people are 
selling the services that you and your consulting colleagues fulfill with your 
company’s clients.
In many ways, work in a consulting firm can be similar to working in a client 
organization. You’ll be working with colleagues in the organization, which 
will give you a sense of normalcy (although you’ll rarely see your colleagues 
if you work for a regional or national company). Plus, you’ll have company 
benefits such as a retirement plan (a 401K in the United States), medical 
insurance, and paid holidays and vacation.
In any job, you have to do what you’re told. But in a lot of consulting jobs, 
you also have to go where you’re sent. As a consultant, you’ll be haunted by 
the drive to work on billable projects to bring in the money that ultimately 
ends up in your paycheck (a portion of it, anyway). You want to avoid being 
on the bench (being paid while between projects) as much as possible.
Consulting firm processes
Many consulting firms have established processes and procedures for a lot 
of operational activities. These processes and procedures drive consistency 
and can help the consulting firm increase its business without falling into 
chaos. Here are some examples:
✓
✓Time accounting: An established method for tracking billable hours by 
client and by project, so that each client can be invoiced accurately for 
all services rendered.
✓
✓Expense accounting: An established method for capturing billable and 
nonbillable expenses, such as travel costs, meals, and supplies.

161

 Chapter 7: Life as a Security Consultant
✓
✓Engagement management: Standard procedures for starting, executing, 
and completing projects. For example:
•	Pre-sales: In some consulting firms, consultants participate in pre-
sales activities with new clients, so that clients can meet the con-
sultant and ask questions about the proposed engagement.
•	Project kickoff: A conference call or an in-person meeting, as well as 
an exchange of documents and client contact information.
•	Project status reports: The consultant writes these, although he or 
she may need to follow a company template and format.
•	Written deliverables: Most consulting engagements include one or 
more written deliverables. You will probably have a template and 
examples to follow so that new written reports are consistent with 
previous ones.
•	Project wrap-up: Includes delivery of written reports, as well as a 
closing meeting.
•	Post project: Includes a final accounting of all billable hours and 
expenses. Some consulting firms may do a project debrief to dis-
cuss what went well, what needed improvement, and how future 
projects can be performed better.
The consultant or other people or departments may perform many of these 
tasks. There is no correct method, but you may find some of the differences 
important. For instance, if you want to focus only on security, look for a con-
sulting firm that doesn’t requires you to do a lot of your own overhead.
Subject matter variety
In a smaller consulting firm, you’ll be a security generalist and may have a 
variety of consulting engagements. Depending on your areas of expertise, you 
could be chosen for many different consulting gigs, such as
✓
✓Policy development: You interview key stakeholders in a client organi-
zation and develop the organization’s security policy.
✓
✓Vulnerability assessment: You use a variety of tools to identify vulner-
abilities in a client’s network, web application, mobile application, or

✓
✓Security awareness training: You create training content for general 
employees in an organization, and perhaps even conduct that training.
✓
✓Risk assessment: You interview ten to twenty people in an organization, 
discuss their processes and technologies, and produce a risk assess-
ment that details where things could go terribly wrong.

✓
✓Physical security social engineering: You might pose as a delivery 
driver, an IT worker, or the like while trying to break into an organiza-
tion’s building.
✓
✓Security incident response: As a solo consultant or part of a team, you 
investigate a security breach to determine what happened, what weak-
ness permitted the intruder to break in, and what measures can be taken 
to prevent future incidents.
In a larger consulting firm (and in some smaller ones), you may be special-
izing in one functional area, and most or all of your consulting engagements 
will be focused on a particular subject matter or activity. For example, if you 
were in a security assessments group, you would be performing penetration 
testing and vulnerability scanning; in an incident response group, you would 
be one of the paratroopers sent in to investigate security incidents.
Working in pre-sales
In many organizations, consultants will support the sales organization in an 
activity known as pre-sales, in which you take part in sales calls to prospective 
clients. You’re along for the ride so that you, the security expert, can describe 
your approach to their particular problems. Seeing (or hearing) you in person 
also gives the client more confidence in the consulting firm, and in you.
Pre-sales is essential to winning future business, but as a consultant, you will 
face pressure to maximize billable hours (and complete tasks and projects on 
time for your clients). Often you end up making up the hours spent on pre-
sales by working in the early morning or evening, to keep client projects on 
schedule.
Consulting is itinerant work
Unless you get a long-term consulting gig, you 
won’t be in one workplace for more than a few 
days or weeks. Forging long-term relationships 
with people in your client organizations is dif-
ficult because you move on just when you’re 
getting to know and enjoy working with them.
Because you’re working as a consultant,  
you won’t be putting down roots, in terms of 
hanging your hat in one organization. Instead, 
you’re an expert, working on a particular task 
or project, and then you’re gone. You won’t be 
around to see the fruits of your labor – at least 
not the long-term positive effects of your contri-
butions. However, you’ll be able to help a lot of 
organizations, something you’d have little oppor-
tunity to do if working for a typical employer.

 Chapter 7: Life as a Security Consultant
Going It Alone as an Independent 
Consultant
In the movie Star Wars, the character Han Solo is the semi-romantic portrayal 
of an independent consultant. He is his own boss, he chooses what jobs to 
take, and he’s in control of his destiny. You also get the impression that it’s a 
lonely job, with only his sidekick Chewbacca as company.
As an independent security consultant, you decide which companies you’ll 
work with. It’s the ultimate in independence and the ultimate in risk, like 
climbing a mountain with no one to belay you if you fall.
Independent consulting is a lifestyle. It’s difficult to master, and few are up 
to it. However, if you’re independent consulting material, the rewards can be 
great. As an independent consultant, it’s just you and your clients: You have 
no coworkers and none of the encumbrances of working in a company with 
others.
Independent consultants have to do a lot of things on their own:
✓
✓Marketing and sales: Independent consultants have to do their own 
marketing and sales. This task requires a different set of skills and can 
take considerable time. Sales is a difficult job.
✓
✓Legal: As an independent consultant, you’ll need to manage your con-
tracts or have outside legal counsel from time to time. You’ll want to 
develop template documents for nondisclosure agreements, statements 
of work, and a master services agreement.
✓
✓Accounting: Unless you’re an expert with small business accounting and 
taxes, you’ll probably want to find an accountant to keep your books or 
complete your tax filings or both.
✓
✓Earned time and benefits: I’m sure you appreciate the concept of paid 
vacations, holidays, and sick days. As an independent consultant, you 
still need time off, but you’re not billing hours while you’re not working 
for a client. You also have to pay for all other benefits, including medical 
insurance, life insurance, and health club discounts.
✓
✓No colleagues: Without colleagues to talk with, independent consultants 
must look to the professional community for like-minded security pro-
fessionals with whom they are willing to share ideas, struggles, and joys. 
Put another way: If you need help on a project, you have to find that 
help on your own.

Working for a Security Vendor
In This Chapter
▶
▶Pitching products and services as a pre‐sales engineer
▶
▶Implementing your company’s products
▶
▶Helping your customers with difficulties
A
 
s an employee in a security company, you’ll have a role in the sales, 
support, implementation, or management of the company’s products 
or services. Most of these positions are “customer facing,” meaning you’ll be 
working with customers in person or by phone. You’ll need above‐­average 
people skills because you’ll be representing your company in front of cus-
tomers and prospective customers, often with a sales executive but some-
times alone.
In this chapter, you find out about a variety of security‐related roles in secu-
rity vendor organizations.
Working in Sales as a Pre‐Sales Engineer
As a pre‐sales engineer, you accompany sales executives on sales calls to 
clients and prospective clients, explaining the wondrous features of the hard-
ware products, software products, or managed services that your company 
provides. You’ll be looked upon as the expert in the room who can take your 
salesperson’s comments deeper with real‐life examples about how your com-
pany made other clients successful.
This job, however, entails a lot more than just smiling, nodding, and tossing 
in an occasional tale or two:
✓
✓Conducting product demos: You might conduct a demonstration of 
your company’s product or provide a depiction of its operation. You 
describe in technical terms what your product is doing and explain 
what the customers are viewing. In some cases, you set up a demo, also

166
Part III: Finding a Job with the Right Organization 
called a POC (proof of concept), in the customer’s environment. When 
this is the case, you’ll have limited time and possibly operational limita-
tions. However, a POC will give an organization a good understanding on 
whether your product will actually work for them.
✓
✓Designing solutions: You design solutions that will work in your custom-
ers’ environments.
✓
✓Creating price quotes: You may also be responsible for creating price 
quotes that your customer will use to make a purchasing decision.
✓
✓Developing architectures: You may work alongside experts in the cus-
tomer’s organization to develop an architecture (a drawing, a technical 
specification, or both) that depicts your company’s product in their 
environment. The plan to use your product in the customer’s environ-
ment may necessitate changes to the customer’s environment and addi-
tional equipment from other vendors.
As a part of the sales organization, you’ll probably have a sales quota, a com-
mission, or other incentives to help your sales executive sell as much prod-
uct or service as possible.
If you work with more than one sales executive, you’ll have to decide when 
two sales executives want you to attend a sales meeting at the same time in 
different locations. Even when everyone in a company can view their cowork-
ers appointment calendars, sometimes conflicts are unavoidable.
You’ll also need to attend training sessions about your company’s products 
(including new features and information on size, scope, and price). These 
sessions will add to your expertise and give your customers confidence that 
you really do know what you’re talking about when you help them imagine 
success with your products.
If you work for a reseller, you’ll need to gain expertise in each of the products 
that your company sells. In larger companies, you might have to be familiar 
with products from dozens of manufacturers.
Rolling Up Your Sleeves as an 
Implementation Engineer
As an implementation engineer, you install and configure your company’s 
product in the customer’s environment. Often, you visit the company’s head-
quarters or other locations where the product will be installed or used. For 
a cloud‐based product, you may still be on‐site to work with the customer’s 

167

 Chapter 8: Working for a Security Vendor
employees to get the product up and running correctly and perhaps provide 
informal training.
A job as an implementation engineer is great when things go well, but some-
times you will have unanticipated challenges, such as the following:
✓
✓Functionality gap: Sometimes salespeople are overzealous when  
pitching the product. When customers discover that the product does 
not in fact take out the garbage or create lattes, they may display their 
dissatisfaction.
✓
✓Product DOA (dead on arrival): It can be embarrassing when a product 
simply doesn’t work!
✓
✓Product undersized: The product may be too small (not enough  
storage, or network throughput, for instance) and not work well in the 
customer’s environment.
✓
✓Missing components: The pre‐sales engineer might not have included all 
necessary components for the product to work properly.
✓
✓Licensing issues: Sometimes there are difficulties activating a license 
that’s required to get a product running.
✓
✓Underqualified customer personnel: Sometimes the customer’s organi-
zation doesn’t have a person with the necessary skills and knowledge to 
successfully operate the product after you’ve set it up.
These situations will draw on your relationship and negotiation skills. You’ll 
need to stay cool, help your customer separate emotion from fact, and keep 
your customer at ease and give him or her confidence in your ability to solve 
the problem. You are, after all, the expert in all things about your product 
and your organization — but be sure that you know who in your organization 
can help you in a crisis.
Helping Customers in Technical Support
As an expert in one or more of your company’s products, you receive calls 
for assistance from a customer who is having some kind of difficulty.
Like an automobile mechanic whose customer complains vaguely about a 
rattle, your customer’s call for help may include imprecise or ambiguous 
descriptions of a problem. Your skills as a kind, empathetic, expert listener 
and troubleshooter will guide you as you ask key questions to get to the root 
cause of the problem.

168
Part III: Finding a Job with the Right Organization 
Customers are not often in a good mood when they’re having difficulty with a 
system. What’s more, they may be under pressure to get systems up and run-
ning again, and your product’s problem may be standing in the way. You’ll 
need to stay cool and collected, keeping the customer confident in your com-
pany’s ability to stand behind them and solve their problem.
If you’re in luck, your company will have good information to help you trou-
bleshoot your customers’ problems, with a knowledge base (KB) or other ref-
erences to guide you. As you gain expertise, you may be contributing to the 
knowledge base, helping your colleagues and those who follow you.
Watching the Fort for a Managed 
Security Service Provider
A managed security services provider (MSSP) is an organization that pro-
vides services to customers who do not have the resources to perform these 
services on their own. An MSSP will provide one or more of the following ser-
vices to its customers:
✓
✓Monitoring: You use systems or network monitoring tools to observe 
the general health of a customer’s critical systems or support the net-
work infrastructure or both. When alarms (visual alerts indicating a mal-
function or security issue) are displayed, you’ll follow procedures that 
could vary from customer to customer.
✓
✓Systems management: You manage network devices, servers, and storage 
infrastructure for multiple customers. You make configuration changes, 
upgrade device software, and watch the health of the infrastructure.
✓
✓Incident response: You monitor systems and networks for security inci-
dents. When an incident is detected, you use tools to drill into affected 
systems to begin isolation, containment, and recovery operations. You 
participate in conference calls with affected clients to listen to their 
needs and inform them of your company’s efforts.
A position in an MSSP is a great place to start a security career because you 
are exposed to enterprise tools and mature processes, and are surrounded 
by security experts with a lot more experience than you.
“When it rains, it pours.” This saying by a table salt manufacturer applies to 
the MSSP business. Boredom can give way to frantic intensity when two or 
more customers have serious issues simultaneously. This type of job can 
be a bit like that of an airline pilot: interesting and challenging at takeoff and 
landing but boring in between. But in an MSSP, as when flying an airplane, 
constant diligence is key.

Security Professional

M
 
ost information security professionals work as in-house experts, 
directly or indirectly contributing to the protection of their employ-
er’s information assets and personnel.
Information security jobs in private sector and nonprofit companies vary 
widely by industry, company size, and other factors. Some people prefer to  
be a one-man-band in a small company, responsible for all aspects of informa-
tion security. Others prefer larger companies and to work as part of an infor-
mation security team or department. There’s no right or wrong here — only 
deciding what you’ll like best and where you can be successful.
Living Your Destiny
Probably the most impactful characteristic of being an in-house versus a 
consulting security professional is that you’re in the organization for the long 
haul. Consultants or contractors come in for a specific task or project and 
then leave, usually long before anyone realizes the consequences (good or 
bad) of their work. But as an in-house security professional, you’ll reap the 
fruits of your labor for years.
When you make good decisions, you’ll enjoy the outcome and at times even 
bask in it. But when you make poor decisions, you’ll be around to see the 
consequences and any discomfort that may result. However, you can also 
improve both bad and good situations to make them even better.

Working in the Private Sector
Private individuals (or a group or people) own and run private sector organi-
zations. A private sector company may also be publicly owned, meaning that 
all or a part of its ownership is through publicly traded shares.
The majority of jobs in the United States are in the private sector. In late 
2014, there were 119 million non-farm jobs in private industry and 22 million 
jobs in government.
Industry regulations
People in many professions tend to work in one industry for much of their 
career, although they may change employers within an industry. Employers 
tend to select candidates for employment based on their past experience in 
the industry, which also tends to keep people in a particular industry sector.
Each sector in the information security field has its own regulations regard-
ing the protection of information and information systems. Familiarity with 
these regulations also tends to keep an information security professional tied 
to a specific industry sector. Table 9-1 provides a sample of industries and 
the regulations related to information security.

*PCI-DSS is not a regulation but an industry standard with enforcement mechanisms that arguably  
make it as effective as government regulation

171

 Chapter 9: Working as an In-House Security Professional
Many organizations are subject to multiple sets of regulations. For instance, a 
publicly traded healthcare organization that accepts payments by credit card 
would be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard 
(PCI-DSS), and U.S. state laws requiring public disclosure of breaches of per-
sonally identifiable information. As a result, the organization may have to 
enact a complex set of IT controls and endure multiple external audits per 
year. These requirements, in part, drive demand for information security pro-
fessionals: Companies need people who are familiar with these different secu-
rity control frameworks and can implement them effectively and efficiently.
Comparing private versus public companies
A public company is one where all or part of its ownership is through publicly 
traded shares that are traded in an open market such as the New York Stock 
Exchange. Table 9-2 highlights key differences between private and public 
companies.
For a security professional, the only practical difference between working 
in a private company versus a public company (U.S. based) is that a public 
company must comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires a public 
company to enact a framework of IT controls and business controls to pro-
tect the integrity of the company’s financial accounting system and its finan-
cial reports.

Supporting company goals and objectives
Information security professionals in the private sector (particularly those in 
management positions) must understand the mission, goals, and objectives 
of their company and then develop and enact security strategies to support 
the mission, goals, and objectives. Otherwise, the security team will be out of 
step with the rest of the organization.
To put it simply, an information security team must support and facili-
tate whatever business activities the organization wants to undertake. 
Information security needs to be involved all along the way, to understand 
new initiatives and to influence small and large outcomes so that those initia-
tives will be successful and carried out with an appropriate level of risk.
One Size Doesn’t Fit All: Small and  
Large Businesses
For many professionals, including those in information security, considerable 
differences exist when working in small versus large organizations. Without 
considering any individual’s preferences, the issue is not good versus bad — 
only differences in the job based on company size.
Table 9-3 provides some general differences between small and large  
organizations. Remember that these are generalizations; every company is 
different.

Chaos versus Calm: Growth, Mergers, 
and Acquisitions
They say that companies are either growing or dying. Although rewarding 
professional challenges exist in both types of companies, some characteris-
tics of a company are worth a look.
On the surface, working for a company enjoying a high rate of growth looks 
like a lot of fun — and it can be. However, a rapidly expanding company  
experiences growing pains that you won’t see in more stable, mature  
organizations:
✓
✓Continuous process transformation: In a growing organization, business 
processes are changed to accommodate new business features, offer-
ings, teams, locations, clients — everything!
✓
✓Outgrowing business systems: An organization growing slowly will occa-
sionally outgrow a system here and there, but a rapidly growing com-
pany will make more frequent changes, many of which are disruptive.
✓
✓Lots of additional staff: A rapidly growing company can have many new 
people who are not yet familiar with the company’s practices, making 
work chaotic. Processes are changing, systems are changing, people’s 
roles are changing, and inconsistencies, mistakes, and chaos can result.
Besides organic growth, some companies grow by gobbling up other compa-
nies. The result is nearly the same: People come together, with different ways 
of doing things, and try to figure out how to do things in the new combined 
organization. Lots of decisions get made in the sloppy effort of joining compa-
nies in mergers and acquisitions.
In many companies that grow through acquisition, their internal IT systems 
are often a patchwork of systems and networks from each acquired company. 
Often these systems remain for years, with integration and consolidation pro-
ceeding slowly, if at all. This adds considerable complexity, which is another 
aspect of the excitement (or angst) that we get to look forward to each day.
Rapidly growing and changing companies are, by their nature, unstable and 
chaotic. You’ll have to decide whether this kind of work environment is 
something you can live with.

Part III: Finding a Job with the Right Organization 
Working in Global Enterprises
Global organizations have a unique set of challenges that companies in a 
single country aren’t faced with. Sure, there are language, cultural, and geo-
graphic challenges that make company operations more interesting. But from 
the perspective of information security, the issues that we need to be aware 
of and manage include the following:
✓
✓Data protection laws: Many industrialized countries have enacted data 
protection laws that prescribe measures that must be taken to protect 
certain types of data.
✓
✓Data privacy laws: Many countries have passed privacy laws that place 
various requirements on organizations doing business there. Some 
countries place stiff requirements on companies that transfer data about 
their citizens out of the country, and other countries do not permit com-
panies to transfer private data out of their home country at all.
✓
✓Employment laws: Differences in employment law keep information 
security professionals up at night. For example, some countries do not 
permit companies to perform criminal background checks on employ-
ment candidates. In other countries, background checks are allowed but 
not effective. And in some countries, common security tools such as log-
ging the websites that employees visit are not allowed.
A multinational company must deal with these different national and local 
laws, and often conduct its business operations differently in each country.
Another important aspect of work in a multinational organization is the likeli-
hood that some of your team members (including your boss, and people who 
work for you) work and live in other countries. For some, this enriches the 
experience through the introduction of language and cultural differences. For 
others, who prefer to work with people mainly face to face, this arrangement 
may not be a satisfying one.
Living on the Edge with a Startup
If you look at any of the websites dedicated to startup companies that list 
open positions, such as angel.co (not angel.com), you’ll rarely find a security 
position — unless the company is security-centric, in which case the design 
of its products or services are all about security.
Working as a security professional in a startup can be a life-changing expe-
rience. If you can tolerate the long hours, chaos, and uncertainty, working 

175

 Chapter 9: Working as an In-House Security Professional
in a startup can be rewarding for a number of reasons. First, being part of 
something new carries a level of excitement (which is sometimes hard to dis-
tinguish from a feeling of terror). Also, you’ll learn a lot in a startup that you 
won’t learn elsewhere, primarily having to do with operating a small business.
Most startup businesses don’t have a lot of money, so information security 
professionals in these businesses have to find creative ways to protect key 
assets without spending a lot of cash. Exactly how this is done will vary 
greatly based on the startup business’s purpose and product, and many 
other factors too numerous to mention here.
The bottom line is that working in a start-up is risky and demanding and can 
be frustrating. However, if things go right, working in a start-up can also be 
extremely rewarding.
Working for a Nonprofit Organization
In the legal sense, a nonprofit uses surplus revenues to further its goals rather 
than distributing them as profit or dividends to owners. When most people 
hear “nonprofit,” they think of a charity or a foundation.
One typical characteristic of a nonprofit is its culture of frugality, because 
every dollar spent on anything other than its mission reduces the fulfillment 
of its mission. With a few exceptions, IT and information security profession-
als find work in nonprofits frustrating because they have fewer opportuni-
ties to gain experience with new technologies. They may also feel that their 
tenure in a nonprofit will hurt their long-term career outlook. Further, some 
nonprofits do not have the means to pay market-level salaries to their profes-
sionals, which can make it difficult for nonprofit organizations to find quali-
fied talent.
Every cloud has its silver lining. Working in a nonprofit can be intensely 
rewarding and fulfilling because you are part of something important that is 
improving the world. For an information security professional, a nonprofit 
has another reward: Because the organization may not have the funds to buy 
the latest security technologies, you’ll learn how to do more with less, which 
is a skill valued not only in nonprofits but also throughout the private sector.

overnment agencies and educational institutions need experienced 
information security professionals as much as private industry does. 
Governments and educational institutions rely as much on information sys-

protecting sensitive information and keeping unauthorized persons away 
from applications, systems, networks, and data.
Although the principles of information protection are similar in any kind of

Public service
Working in any level of government is frequently referred to as public service. 
In a public sector job, you serve the public in a professional capacity, provid-
ing assistance to your agency in the quest to facilitate more efficient access 
to information while protecting that information from and responding to 
inappropriate access.
Public service is an honorable career pursuit, but it is often considered a 
career that includes tradeoffs in the following four ways:
✓
✓Compensation: Generally, public service jobs pay 10 percent to 40 per-
cent less than the private sector. However, you’re less likely to work the 
long hours required in many private sector jobs. You might be home 
for dinner more often, but your dinner is more likely to be ground beef 
instead of filet mignon.
✓
✓Skills and knowledge deficit: In public service, you typically have less 
exposure to the latest in high-tech innovation. Over the long run, this 
deficit could put you at a slight disadvantage in the jobs market, where 
your skills would compare unfavorably against private sector candidates 
who have more experience with the latest tools and techniques.
✓
✓Lower risk: In a public sector job, you usually take smaller risks, and 
your job will be less likely to be affected by mergers, downsizing, and 
lay-offs. Put another way, you may have greater job security.
✓
✓Benefits: Public sector jobs often come with excellent benefits, more 
holidays and time off, good health benefits, and often a pension.
In the public sector, you’re somewhat further away from the cutting edge, you 
will have a somewhat lower salary, but your level of risk and time commit-
ment are lower as well. Is the public sector right for you? Only you can answer 
that. Let’s look at more facts of public service in the rest of this section.
Transparency
Everything that goes on in all levels of the public sector is subject to public 
examination and scrutiny. The memos you write, the emails you send, and 
the contracts between your agency and outside companies are available to 
the public on request, with a few exceptions. (The privacy of citizens and 
public service employees is protected, and in some cases, sensitive informa-
tion such as system security configurations are unavailable for reasons that 
I hope are obvious.)

 Chapter 10: Serving in the Public Sector or Academia
Some professionals bristle at this level of transparency and consider it an 
invasion of their professional privacy. However, the rationale behind trans-
parent government is a long-standing one in the United States: It is a protec-
tion against tyrannical rule. Transparency is just another aspect of public 
service that comes with the territory.
The glacial pace of change
Government has a long-standing reputation of making progress slowly. Sure, 
for the most part, government agencies may not have the latest high-tech 
gadgetry, but often our government agencies at least have the basics to get 
the job done. But the sometimes slow pace of progress is not just about 
­technology.
Government should be thought of as an institution with well-defined and 
deeply entrenched business practices, which are sometimes out of step with 
the practices in private industry.
Leadership
Another big difference between public sector organizations and the private 
sector is that leadership changes are based on elections, rather than on a 
professional hiring process. Thus, executive leadership changes on a regular 
basis, and leaders are chosen more for their political prowess or governing 
abilities than for their understanding or even comprehension of the world of 
information technology.
This same dynamic can raise challenges for nontechnical private sector orga-
nizations, but at least the leaders are selected and maintained for their exper-
tise in the business of the enterprise. And in those cases, with the correct 
information from you and your peers, the private sector executive is likely to 
be at least trainable in the risks presented by technology.
In the public sector, leaders concentrate on their political priorities, so they 
often have no time or inclination to consider cyber risk. Fortunately, depart-
ment heads, at least in larger public sector organizations, often survive 
several terms of office. Therein lies the hope and possibility of creating and 
maintaining an information security capability of lasting value and resilience.

Tenure
In part, the pace of change in the public sector is a result of people remain-
ing in their government jobs for decades, sometimes in the same job. People 
resist change, and if the same people are in charge for years or decades, 
their way of doing things tends to stay the same. These practices are out of 
step with the way things are accomplished in private industry. This practice 
drives some people a little crazy, but public service is not for everyone.
One reason why people to stay in public service jobs is the pension, a long-
term benefit that has all but disappeared from the private sector. Whereas 
public sector pay is lower than the private sector, a public sector pension may 
be quite generous for those who spent their entire career in public service.
Regulations
Aside from the general theme of transparency described previously, govern-
ment agencies are also subject to regulations requiring them to enact con-
trols to protect information and information systems. The most noteworthy 
of these is the Federal Information Systems Management Act (FISMA) of 2002, 
which requires every U.S. federal agency to establish effective information 
security programs.
At a minimum, federal agencies are required to enact security programs 
based on two key documents:
✓
✓FIPS 200: Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and 
Information Systems
✓
✓NIST 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information 
Systems and Organizations
Local versus federal
At state and local levels, you’ll likely have less 
exposure to high tech innovations and experi-
ence. But as you go up to the federal govern-
ment and defense work, you’re likely to have 
more exposure to cutting edge technology.
With larger government institutions (especially 
those that protect information), you can get the 
benefits of scale. For example, monitoring and 
reporting of every system on a network may not 
be cost effective at smaller agencies but is rou-
tine at the Department of Defense level.

181

 Chapter 10: Serving in the Public Sector or Academia
Agencies are required to develop a System Security Plan (SSP) for each 
information system, and undergo periodic certification and accredita-
tion processes for each system to ensure that it meets applicable security 
­requirements and standards. Security professionals in government agencies 
are typically involved in these processes.
Agencies at all levels that accept payments by credit card are required to 
comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), 
which is not a regulation per se but instead enforced through a card brand’s 
power to withhold an agency’s ability to process payments by credit card.
Working for a Military or 
Defense Contractor
U.S. federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, enlist the help 
of many outside organizations for the development of military and defense 
capabilities, including weaponry and other support of active military forces. 
Conversely, they are also often used to provide staff augmentation to fill in 
understaffed roles; cyber-related roles are often filled with contractors due 
to the need for experienced and certified individuals. Although these orga-
nizations are considered to be in the private sector, they warrant a separate 
­discussion because there are differences in how they operate.
Depending on the particular firm and its purpose, jobs in military and 
defense contracting companies can resemble government itself in terms of 
the rate of change, the longevity of the employees, and the potentially glacial 
pace of operation. On the other hand, many companies and their positions 
can be much more like the private sector, with a higher pace of work, more 
exposure to high-tech innovation, and profit sharing!
Employees in military and defense contractor firms usually undergo onerous 
background checks at the time of hire. For many people in positions of higher 
sensitivity, background checks may be periodically conducted throughout 
their employment.

Part III: Finding a Job with the Right Organization 
Going Back to School
Whether you consider working in K through 12 or in higher education, 
employment in education is public service work (unless you work for a 
­private school).
For the most part, information security work in education is a lot like infor-
mation security in public service: things move slowly, and there may not be a 
lot of money in the budget to get the tools you think you need to protect the 
organization. Chances are, you’ll be dealing with people deeply entrenched 
in their careers; many may be resistant to making the kinds of changes you 
think are warranted to ensure better protection of sensitive information.
Higher education suffers from a paradox in our profession: Universities 
are generally thought of as open environments with little or no controls to 
restrict what students and faculty are permitted to do on campus networks. 
This practice sometimes contradicts our mission of protecting an environ-
ment through controls such as a firewall, an intrusion prevention system 
(IPS), and a data loss prevention (DLP) system. Often, however, this dichot-
omy plays out through the creation of a highly protected portion of a univer-
sity’s environment housing servers containing sensitive information. This 
practice of network segmentation, or the creation of various security zones, 
protects certain systems while relaxing security in other places.
Defense contractors are a public-private hybrid
By working for a defense contractor, you can 
get access to some of the benefits of work-
ing with large government organizations (and 
exposure to what they do) without having to 
work through government bureaucracy, and 
you get the benefits of working for the private 
sector (technically). At the same time, although 
you often get a comparably higher salary, you 
don’t have the job security or necessarily the 
same hours.
I think government contracting is really in 
between private and public from a career and 
benefits perspective. A word of caution: Many 
of the larger government contracting firms 
work on a contract-by-contract basis, so while 
you’re an employee of the contractor, after the 
contract with the government is over, you may 
not be guaranteed a job.

he Internet is your marketing machine, and the world is your audience. 
It’s no longer enough to build a resume and upload it to job search sites 
such as Monster.com. In today’s job search marketplace, you also need to 
tap into business social networking sites that give you the opportunity to 
market yourself, to create the brand of you.
People are the key to advancing your career — you can’t do it on your own. 
Meeting your peers at industry events will help you understand how other 
information security professionals overcome obstacles and discover their 
recipes for career success. Reaching a broader audience through online 
professional networking on sites such as LinkedIn and Twitter will help you

business brands. Plus, follow the advice in this chapter as you build your 
professional reputation in information security.
Many great resources are available for establishing and building a network 
of security professionals. The most important resource is you. Building your 
network involves connecting one‐on‐one with people, not in using tools to 
create cool online personas (although those are important as well). Your 
number one objective is to establish yourself as an interesting professional 
with unique talents who understands the value in working with other infor-
mation security professionals.
Meeting People
Building your network begins with meeting other professionals and getting to 
know them. You can meet people in many ways, such as the following:
✓
✓Inside your company: If you work in a larger organization with an estab-
lished information security team, reach out to them and explain that you 
want to learn more about their careers. If you tell them that you’re inter-
ested in an information security career, chances are good that someone 
will be happy to discuss their career with you.
✓
✓Security industry associations: There are a lot of industry associations, 
and many of them organize local events in midsize and larger cities 
around the world. Some of these associations are
•	Association for Computing Machinery (ACM): Has a special interest 
group on security, audit, and control. Located at www.sigsac.org.
•	ASIS International: Professional association that includes certifica-
tions. Located at www.asisonline.org.
•	Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFA): Antifraud orga-
nization. Located at www.acfe.com.
•	Business Continuity Institute (BCI): Focused on business continuity 
and offers professional certifications. Located at www.thebci.org.
•	DRI International (DRII): Organization focused on disaster recov-
ery planning. Located at www.drii.org.
•	International Council of Electronic Commerce Consultants  
(EC Council): Founder of CEH and other certifications. Located at 
www.eccouncil.org.
•	Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE): Has a special 
interest group on security. Located at www.ieee-security.org.

✓Security conferences: Conferences are a great way to meet people, 
including other attendees as well as exhibitors and speakers. Many 
industry associations just listed host security conferences. A few others 
follow:
•	Black Hat: Annual conference in Las Vegas. Information at www.
blackhat.com.
•	BSides: Community conferences held in several countries.

as in Europe and Asia. Information at www.rsaconference.com.
•	SecureWorld Expo: Over a dozen security conferences throughout 
the U.S. Information at www.secureworldexpo.com.
✓
✓Sponsored vendor events: In medium sized and larger cities, companies 
that produce security products and services hold vendor events, where 
they discuss related topics and demonstrate their products. These 
events are often held in hotel meeting spaces and community centers. 
To learn about these events, get your name on some mailing lists for 
vendors.
✓
✓Service clubs: Organizations such as Rotary, Kiwanis, Lions, and 
Optimists focus on service to communities and are a good place to meet 
other professionals.
Even if you don’t know anyone else who will be attending, you’ll have an 
opportunity to meet other people. If you’re not the outgoing type, you’ll need 
to pretend to be. Besides, no one else will know whether you’re introverted if 
you pretend for a while that you’re an extrovert.

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
In most cases, it’s not good form to introduce yourself and then immediately 
start talking about yourself, particularly if you tell them you’re looking for a 
job. Instead, it’s better to ask people to tell you something about themselves; 
people will remember you in a much better light if you ask and listen rather 
than talk their ears off.
If the subject comes back around and someone asks you, “So, what do you 
do?”, you can describe current and past positions, and that you are looking 
to get into information security. You might explain a little about what you’re 
doing to get into the profession, and then ask the other person’s opinion on 
your approach. You might get some good pointers and maybe even offers to 
introduce you to others at the event.
Develop an elevator pitch — what you would say about yourself to someone 
while riding an elevator between floors. You have about 1 to 2 minutes to 
quickly give an overview of what you do as well as your interest in becoming 
(or your experience as) an information security professional.
If you’re currently employed, bring plenty of business cards. If you’re 
between jobs, or if your employer doesn’t provide business cards, get some 
quality ones printed. (Many sites offer free business cards, but you might 
consider upgrading to a better cardstock or appearance.) In this day of elec-
tronic everything, business cards may seem a little old‐fashioned, but a lot of 
people still use them. Business cards are a great way to capture names and 
contact information easily, so that you can follow‐up with relevant and inter-
esting professionals in the future.
The two most important reasons for meeting people? Companies prefer to 
hire people they know, and security professionals are usually willing to dis-
cuss challenges with others they know.
Networking with others
Networking is critical. If you’re an introvert and 
don’t always feel social, which is a category I fit 
into, networking is a good opportunity to over-
come those feelings. Knowing people in security 
will help alleviate that “unknown quantity” risk 
that potential employers face and will provide 
land you interviews for which you’d otherwise 
be overlooked. For me and many others I know, 
networking was the key to landing our first job in 
the field or a subsequent one. Beyond that, I’ve 
found that the community freely gives advice 
and help with security problems.

Business Networking with LinkedIn
Launched in 2003, LinkedIn touts itself as the “world’s largest professional 
network.” With over 200 million users, LinkedIn is a great resource for estab-
lishing one’s own brand as well as finding other like‐minded people. LinkedIn 
is located at www.linkedin.com.
LinkedIn is your most important tool to establish your brand and a profes-
sional network, to be recognized as a thought leader in your area of exper-
tise, and to seek opportunities or advance your career. If you want to learn a 
lot more about LinkedIn, pick up a copy of LinkedIn For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
by Joel Elad.
To use LinkedIn, sign up for a free account and build a profile that resembles 
a resume. You establish connections with people you know (or want to 
know) for business networking. You can join special interest groups where 
private discussions take place, and you can search for jobs in any industry 
and location. You can search for people you might know in the “people you 
may know” feature. You can also search for people by name, location, or 
company in the freeform search, where you you can also conduct keyword 
searches to find people in specific interest areas such as network security.
LinkedIn is quite feature‐rich: You can express and describe your profes-
sional background in many ways. Many consider a LinkedIn profile to be a 
living resume, which you can update and improve at any time.
In the remainder of this section, various features of LinkedIn are described.
Photo
You can upload a photo of yourself if you want, and most users do. I recom-
mend that you use a recent, high‐quality photo. Using a much older photo 
may capture the beauty of youth, but people who meet you in person may 
wonder if you are disingenuous. Also, it’s best to have a head shot taken by a 
professional. Wear professional clothing and keep the colors conservative.
Avoid the following mistakes, which can make your first impression less than 
professional:
✓
✓Cropped group photo: A photo that’s obviously cropped makes people 
wonder if you have any good photos of yourself.
✓
✓Party photo: Is that the first visual impression you want to make?
www.allitebooks.com

190
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
✓
✓Look at my cool vacation photo: Yes, the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of 
Liberty are cool, but leave those for your personal Facebook page.
✓
✓Selfie: Almost without exception, selfies are not kind to one’s looks, 
especially if the camera is too close. Your nose looks huge!
✓
✓Company logo: I’m happy that you are enthused about your company, 
but others want to know what you look like.
You can change your photo any time. If you have a good photo now, use it. 
Upload a better one later.
LinkedIn also has a background image feature that enables you to upload a 
landscape‐oriented background. It’s appropriate to select something busi-
ness oriented, or just about anything else that is tasteful and reflects well on 
you personally.
Headline
The LinkedIn headline is the phrase that appears directly below your name 
on your profile page. Ideas for your headline include title and company (such 
as Systems Engineer at Newco), mission (for instance, Systems engineer in oil 
and gas industry), and multiple activities (for example, Systems engineer, ISSA 
board member, and instructor).
The headline is short, just one or two lines. To those viewing your LinkedIn 
page, the headline serves as your personal brand statement. Most career 
coaches advise you to use your headline to define the unique talent and 
value you deliver.
Below the headline in a smaller type size is the area where you live. Next is 
a categorization, which you can select to tie into you or your company. For 
instance, if you’re a security professional in the retail industry, you could 
select Security and Investigations or Retail.
When writing your LinkedIn profile, be sure to use keywords that others 
are likely to use when seeking someone like you so you’ll show up in their 
searches. Many recruiters and headhunters use premium LinkedIn accounts 
to search for candidates.

191

 Chapter 11: Branding Yourself for Your Dream Career
Background
The section of your profile directly below your photo is where you present 
your background and experience by completing each of the following sections:
✓
✓Summary: Write a few paragraphs about yourself. It’s best to think 
about this like a summary near the top of a resume. Don’t make it too 
long, or people might not read it all the way through.
✓
✓Experience: List each job you’ve had, and you can provide several 
details about your position, primarily in the freeform text field. For each 
position, you can specify a title, company, location, and description of 
your responsibilities and accomplishments.
✓
✓Projects: Describe any projects you have undertaken at each job. You 
can specify which other persons (they must be LinkedIn users) partici-
pated in the project.
✓
✓Organizations: List any organizations that you currently belong to or 
did in the past. If you’ve been out of college for less than five years, you 
can list campus organizations here if you want.
✓
✓Volunteer Experience & Causes: List the organizations where you vol-
unteer your time, money, or other resources. You’re seen as a better 
person if you put others’ needs ahead of your own.
✓
✓Skills: List individual business and technical skills, separate from your 
individual jobs.
✓
✓Certifications: List each industry certification, including the year 
earned, when it expires (if it does), when you last held it (if it’s not cur-
rent), and a description of the certification if it’s not a common one.
✓
✓Education: List your education, including courses, degrees, and signifi-
cant training courses. My own rule of thumb is that you don’t need to 
list your high school education if you’re older than 25 years of age.
✓
✓Additional Info: List any outside interests, personal details, and how 
you can be contacted.
✓
✓Honors and Awards: List any honors and awards here.
Like a functional resume, you can change the order of appearance of the vari-
ous sections in your LinkedIn profile by simply dragging them up or down.
Connections
Any connections you have will appear in your profile. These are other people 
you know and have agreed to connect with. When you’re connected with 
www.allitebooks.com

192
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
someone, you can see more details in their profile, their contact information, 
and any connections you may have in common. If the connection permits, 
you can view all of the other person’s connections (and they yours). LinkedIn 
does permit you to conceal your connections from others.
The connection feature is intended to be used with people you know. Before 
requesting a connection from someone you don’t know, understand that the 
person can refuse to connect with you and state that he or she doesn’t know 
you. If you decide to pursue a connection with someone you don’t know, be 
sure to include a personal note in the connection request that includes the 
reason you want to connect. If you get several such rejections, LinkedIn will 
temporarily suspend your ability to request connections from other users.
Recommendations
LinkedIn provides a means for users to write a recommendation for one of 
their connections. A recommendation is just that — a description of how you 
know the person and why the person is a good professional. For example: 
“Over the past 7 years, I have had the pleasure of working with Emily on the 
university certification program. I have found her to be hard working, punc-
tual, and a lot of fun to work with.”
When you write a recommendation for another person, that person has the 
choice of whether to include the recommendation in his or her profile. If you 
didn’t have nice things to say about the person, chances are he or she will not 
approve it. Also, if you got any facts wrong or just said anything that the recip-
ient doesn’t care for, he or she can reject it and request that you change it.
Recommendations can function like prewritten references and improve your 
professional image.
Updates
LinkedIn has a feature where you can write a message, upload an image, or 
put in a link to an article. You can do a lot of things with updates:
✓
✓Cite an industry article and include your opinion.
✓
✓Post a significant update about yourself.
✓
✓Cite a blog entry you’ve recently written.

193

 Chapter 11: Branding Yourself for Your Dream Career
The updates feature of LinkedIn helps you inform your connections about 
important professional events and issues. However, the feature is also  
misused — or at least some would say so. For instance, uploading an image 
of some clever saying (“Managers tell you what to do, Leaders show you how 
to do it.”) borders on being noise, and uploading a photo of your cat would 
be considered inappropriate by most. Fortunately, LinkedIn gives you the 
ability to suppress updates from people who are too chatty about unimport-
ant things. In other words, keep your updates professional and business 
related!
Groups
LinkedIn provides for the creation of groups, which are communities of 
LinkedIn members, where they can discuss matters on almost any topic. 
Groups can be moderated, which means that a group owner or coordinator 
(one or more of its members) can selectively approve or reject individual 
postings. Membership can be set to automatically approve or be subject to 
manual approval.
Groups are a great way to find people that are in your field or work for com-
panies that you’re interested in. When you join a group, you have a legitimate 
opening to connect directly with other group members. Also, many recruiters 
utilize groups to find qualified candidates. Recruiters will also make career‐
related posts that might help you identify employment trends in your field.
The contents of LinkedIn groups can be kept private, so that only its mem-
bers can view its proceedings. A LinkedIn group can be made public, which 
means that non‐LinkedIn members can join the group, and the contents of 
the group’s discussions will be searchable by Internet search engines such as 
Google and Yahoo.
Jobs
Many professional recruiters and headhunters use LinkedIn to search for 
employment candidates. One sign of an effective LinkedIn profile is a periodic 
contact from a recruiter who asks you if you have any interest in positions he 
or she is trying to fill. Recruiters find you through keywords in your profile.
Recruiters can purchase a premium subscription to LinkedIn that affords 
them additional privileges, such as the ability to send messages to LinkedIn 
users with whom they are not connected.

Using LinkedIn successfully
LinkedIn can be a powerful tool to expand your professional network. You’ll 
be seen as a good LinkedIn citizen if you follow these pointers:
✓
✓Keep your summary fairly short and include keywords that describe 
what you do and are likely to be used by others searching for people 
with your talents.
✓
✓Describe each employment position with the same level of detail as a 
resume.
✓
✓Use a high‐quality professional photo.
✓
✓Request connections only from people you know, or you might lose the 
ability to request new connections.
✓
✓Accept connection requests only from people you know (fraudsters use 
LinkedIn to trick users into providing information to them).
✓
✓List your education and professional certifications.
Because your LinkedIn profile is so much like a resume, you’ll want to read 
Chapter 12. Many of the tips in that chapter will apply to your usage of LinkedIn.
Networking through Facebook
Facebook is one of the world’s great social networking wonders. From a pro-
fessional sense, some aspects of Facebook should be left to nonprofessional 
uses only, while other features can work to your advantage as you develop 
your personal brand. Facebook can be found at www.facebook.com.
LinkedIn is my living resume
I’ve been using LinkedIn for ten years. I realized 
its value as a public, living resume. My efforts 
have paid off through numerous opportunities 
that otherwise would not have materialized.
My LinkedIn profile is bigger than my resume, 
and includes projects, publications, and over 
60 recommendations from coworkers I have 
worked with over the past thirty years. The 
richness of my LinkedIn profile has resulted in a 
steady stream of contacts from recruiters over 
several years.

 Chapter 11: Branding Yourself for Your Dream Career
Facebook profile and timeline
A Facebook profile is used to describe yourself in many ways: where you live, 
where you work, where you went to school, and much more. A Facebook 
timeline (once called the Facebook wall) is the place where you type updates 
of various kinds and where you can see your posts, friends posts to you, and 
any posts or photos in which you’re tagged, or mentioned with a link to your 
Facebook profile.
You are strongly recommended to keep your Facebook profile private, so 
that only your friends can see any of your content. Prospective employers 
search for candidates’ Facebook pages to get an idea of their character. 
Because of the way that some Facebook features work, it’s best to keep your 
Facebook profile concealed from all but those to whom you’ve accepted as 
Facebook friends.
Although Facebook is more of a social networking site, recruiters or compa-
nies often use it to learn about prospective or current employees. It’s okay 
to have personal and fun info on Facebook, but treat it as if you know that a 
potential employer will look at it — err on the side of being conservative. Do 
not put anything on an online networking source that you wouldn’t be com-
fortable having your employer see or read.
Facebook groups
Although there are many other more suitable places than Facebook for 
like‐minded professionals to gather and discuss issues, millions of Facebook 
users connect with colleagues and professionals in their category through 
Facebook and Facebook groups.
Avoid mixing your personal and professional posts by taking a few key steps. 
First, from your Facebook page, click Friends in the left column. From the 
page that appears, click Create List to create a group of people with whom 
you can share information and stay in touch in one place.
Next, search for or create a group by clicking Create a Group or Find New 
Groups under the Groups listing in the left column of Facebook. From there, 
it’s a matter of participating by checking updates and sharing posts with 
others in the group.
If the topic of a Facebook group includes confidential information, or if the 
members of a group should not be publicly known, you should set up the 
Facebook group as a secret group.

Facebook company pages
Facebook profiles are generally for personal use, and Facebook pages are 
for businesses and brands. You must have a Facebook profile before you 
can create a Facebook page for your business. Pages are public (unlike pro-
files) and discoverable through Facebook and browser searches. In addition, 
Facebook page posts are free but only a minor percentage of them will show 
up in the news feeds of your page followers. The rest get filtered as a result 
of Facebook’s algorithms unless you develop high levels of interaction with 
your posts or pay to post the information as a promoted post.
Facebook business pages and fan pages are one and the same.
Tweeting with Twitter
The microblogging sensation Twitter is another great way to build your 
brand. Twitter’s function is simple: You build a profile, you follow other 
Twitter users, and others follow you, if they find what you have to say inter-
esting and valuable. When a user you follow posts something (called a tweet), 
it appears in your timeline, along with posts from everyone else they follow. 
In your timeline, you view the posts made by everyone you follow, and your 
followers view your posts as well.
You can also send and receive direct messages with people you follow who 
also follow you.
Posts and direct messages are limited to 140 characters. You’d be wise to 
keep your posts even shorter because you want to encourage others to 
retweet or repost your tweets, and they’ll need up to 20 characters to add 
their own message to yours.
To date, over 250 million users are on Twitter.
Setting up your Twitter profile
To set up a Twitter profile, you select a username and password, upload a 
photo, and provide a brief description of yourself, which is limited to 160 char-
acters, slightly longer than the 140‐character tweet limit. You can also have a 
background photo that will be visible when someone views your profile.

Tweeting
When you have something to say, you tweet it: you post an update, maximum 
of 140 characters including spaces. Everyone following you will see it in his 
or her timeline. You can include URLs, which Twitter automatically shortens 
to take less of your 140‐character count, and you can include photos and 
video (a big draw on Twitter) as well. For all you need to know, check out 
Getting Started with Twitter in Twitter’s help center.
Presenting yourself in 140 characters is difficult, but Twitter users do just 
that. However, for professional purposes, many tweets also include a URL to 
an article, which could be your blog post or an article of general interest to 
other security professionals.
Using Twitter successfully
Twitter can be a great way to expand your professional network. You’ll be 
successful with Twitter if you follow these pointers:
✓
✓Don’t become the town crier by retweeting lots of stories put out by 
news media outlets such as CNN or AP.
✓
✓Add value to information rather than just rebroadcasting (retweeting) it.
✓
✓Maintain separate professional and personal Twitter accounts if you 
want to use Twitter for nonprofessional networking. Followers are 
visible to everyone, so consider not following your personal Twitter 
account from your professional one, and vice versa.
✓
✓Consider using TweetDeck to schedule Tweets at key times of the day or 
week. Information is available at www.tweetdeck.twitter.com.
Starting a Blog
Everyone has an opinion. A blog is a great way to express yours, particularly 
when something you have to say takes more than 140 characters. All kidding 
aside, writing a blog can be a great way to publicly express your opinion and 
solicit feedback. Blogging about information security can be a way of distin-
guishing yourself from other employment candidates. However, thousands of 
information security professionals have blog sites, so you may want to con-
sider a blog as table stakes in our profession.

In case you’re the last person living under a rock, a blog is a simple website 
that functions like a journal, with journal entries (short articles) that focus on 
a single point of view or interest area, with the most recent articles appear-
ing first. A blog can also have pages for static content, such as a page for the 
blog site owner’s biography.
Setting up a blog
Setting up a blog is easy. Go to one of several popular (and free) blogging 
sites, click the Start a New Blog link, and answer a few questions. First, 
though, consider the following:
✓
✓Name and URL: You can name your blog after your name or choose a 
keyword (or combination of keywords). You can also register your own 
domain name and associate it with your blog for a more professional 
feel. For example, on the WordPress service, you could be jimsmith.
wordpress.com, or with your own domain name you could be www. 
jimsmith.com, which would redirect to your WordPress site.
✓
✓Internet searchable: You’ll probably want your blog articles to be 
searchable so that people can find your blog’s articles. Be sure to use 
keywords in your headlines, section titles, post content, and summary 
snippet — or in the first 160 characters of your post, because that’s what 
search engines display if you don’t provide a snippet. Again, keywords 
are critical! Find opportunities to insert your keywords into your blogs.
✓
✓Statistics: If you want to know how many visitors read your blog and 
what keyword searches lead them to you, use a blog that provides these 
types of statistics.
It’s best if you keep your blog simple, so that you can maintain it easily. A 
few weeks or months after that “new blog smell” wears off, you may not be 
inclined to do much with it. If you keep the blog simple, it won’t require much 
work to maintain it.
A couple of good books on the topic of blogging are Blogging For Dummies, 
5th Edition by Amy Lupold Bair and Susannah Gardner and WordPress For 
Dummies, 6th Edition by Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
Blog services
Several excellent free blog sites are available. Check out the following:
✓
✓Blogger, www.blogger.com
✓
✓SquareSpace, www.squarespace.com

199

 Chapter 11: Branding Yourself for Your Dream Career
✓
✓TypePad, www.typepad.com
✓
✓WordPress, www.wordpress.com
All these sites make it easy to set up a blog. Many blog services offer free and 
paid versions.
Several high‐quality (and often free) blog software packages are available 
that you can acquire and install on a server. However, information security 
issues today make keeping your site secure a time‐consuming proposition. 
Why not let a free service take care of all this for you?
Information security blogs
If you’re not sure how you want to set up your blog, you might want to check 
out the following blogs for information security professionals:
✓
✓Assuming the Breach, assumebreach.blogspot.com
✓
✓Brian Krebs, www.krebsonsecurity.com
✓
✓Infosecurity Pro, www.infosecurity.pro
✓
✓Security on Wheels, www.securityonwheels.com/blog
Besides seeing good examples, you may find them interesting and informative.
Using and maintaining your blog
After you’ve set up your blog, all you really need to do is write short or long 
articles with some regularity. You don’t need to pen something as long as 
War and Peace every week, but you do need to write a blog entry at least 
once a month, preferably more frequently. Otherwise, your blog will take on 
a stale, abandoned look, which may be worse than not having one.
As you get accustomed to your blog, consider adding some other features, 
such as the following:
✓
✓Subscribe: This feature is a way for readers to subscribe to your blog, so 
that your blog site automatically emails new blog entries to them.
✓
✓About: The About page is a static page about you, which may include 
something about your education, work history, professional interests, 
and so on.

✓
✓Tag cloud: If you tag your blog entries, you get a tag cloud, which pro-
vides a nice visual depiction of the topics you write about the most. 
Figure 11-1 shows a tag cloud.
✓
✓Publications: If you’ve written articles, books, or e‐books, you might 
create a static page to list them or perhaps create a static page for each 
individual publication.
✓
✓Guest posts: Invite others to submit posts to your blog, and offer to 
guest blog on their blogs as well. Reciprocal links can develop traffic and 
readership for all blogs involved.
It’s best to keep your blog fairly simple, so that it doesn’t have a cluttered, 
chaotic look and is easier and less time consuming to maintain.
Writing Articles and E‐Books
A great way to establish and expand your brand is to write articles for maga-
zines (print or online) and e‐books. Articles and e‐books help to promote you 
as an expert in some facet of information security. They also provide you 
Figure 11-1: 
 A tag cloud 
from a blog 
site.

201

 Chapter 11: Branding Yourself for Your Dream Career
with valuable content you can feature in your Facebook, Twitter, and blog 
posts while establishing you as a thought leader in your field.
Writing for the reader
You don’t need to invent something to write an article or an e‐book; all you 
need is an opinion, a tip, or a story about something in business, information 
technology, or information security. Here are some ideas for an article or  
e‐book:
✓
✓Your success story and how others can benefit
✓
✓A description of a problem or challenge
✓
✓An epiphany or some kind of new insight into a classic problem or 
­situation
✓
✓A story of an information security failure
✓
✓Your idea on a new way to solve a classic problem in information security
✓
✓Your recipe for successfully completing something
When pondering the idea of an article or e‐book, think about what benefit 
your readers will gain. These articles are not about you and how smart 
you are but about how your message can help others. When you’re writing 
­something for your readers, it’s about them, not you.
Finding an outlet
If you’ve written a good article, consider submitting it to print or online maga-
zines or websites for publication. Be sure that the content fits well with the 
established style and target audience. You might consider asking someone 
who writes an information security blog if you can submit an article as a guest 
author.
Or perhaps a publishing outlet will find you. The best way to get your article 
published is to publish it yourself on your blog. As long as the article uses 
good keywords so that it can be found in an Internet search, a few people 
might take notice and either post a link to refer readers to it or ask you if 
they can put a copy of your article on their website.
Chances are you will not be paid, and it’s probably best not to even ask. 
Getting your article on someone else’s website is free advertising for your 
brand, so don’t bite the hand that feeds you.

Similarly, there are several outlets for publishing an e‐book that are free or 
modestly priced. Two such outlets are
✓
✓Amazon Kindle, kdp.amazon.com
✓
✓Book Baby, www.bookbaby.com
If you pursue an e‐publication, you can use it as a for‐sale item on your web-
site or blog, a gift to encourage blog subscriptions or event attendance, or a 
means for generating interest from potential clients or media outlets. You can 
also repurpose the content for use on your blog, on Facebook, or in tweets, 
always including a link where readers can obtain the complete e‐book.
Publishing E‐Books For Dummies is a great resource for publishing your own 
e‐books.
You should refrain from writing tales about your workplace or your clients if 
you’re in consulting, even if you change the names of companies and people. 
You need to avoid the perception that you’re disclosing information about 
your employer or client that should be kept confidential.
Segregating Your Personal  
and Professional Lives
As you begin developing your professional reputation, you’ll want to help 
others gain a clear and positive idea about who you are, your unique talents 
and value, and your career focus, work history, and professional interests. In 
other words, you’ll want to rev up your personal branding efforts.
It’s easy to buy into the false notion that you can have one brand for your 
personal life and one business brand for your professional life, but that’s 
not the way personal brands work. Your brand is, quoting from Branding For 
Dummies, “whatever people believe about who you are and what you stand 
for, based on what they’ve personally experienced, what they’ve heard from 
others, or what they’ve seen online. Through personal branding . . . you 
help them see how you fit into their hierarchy of interests and needs. You 
enhance how they view you as an asset, a leader, and a star in your field. As 
a result, you improve how they react when they encounter you or your name 
and as they decide whether or not to involve you in their lives.”
Because people are likely to either encounter you in both personal and profes-
sional situations or to come across online information that reveals both your 
personal and professional lives, it’s important to keep your presentation in 

203

 Chapter 11: Branding Yourself for Your Dream Career
both arenas complementary and segregated. In the same way that you likely 
act and communicate differently in the rec room than in the conference room, 
you can act and communicate differently in personal and professional arenas. 
But you need to stand for the same values and traits in both places.
Your professional brand communications are intentionally accessible to the 
entire Internet — to anyone who cares to seek information you’ve published. 
But to the degree possible, your personal social networking should remain 
separate and restricted to your personal connections. The primary reasons 
for this follow:
✓
✓Details of your personal life are not relevant to your professional audi-
ence. Although it’s nice that you (may) have a family, we don’t need to 
see their Halloween costumes, school play photos, or that great sushi 
dinner you had last week. Save those for personal social networking.
✓
✓Details of your personal life should not be accessible to the general 
public. These details include photographs and names of family mem-
bers, their schools or workplaces, and their friends.
On Facebook, for instance, you probably should be cautious about who you 
connect to, because you may be sharing intimate details of your life. But 
you might readily accept connection requests on LinkedIn from professional 
The Internet’s long memory
The Internet has countless stories about com-
panies who considered hiring someone until 
they found and read their public social network-
ing content. Thousands of people have learned 
this bitter lesson, and you should not have to 
follow in their footsteps.
The best approach for preventing the poten-
tially embarrassing consequences of social 
networking is to change your understanding 
of how the Internet works. Anytime you post 
something online through a social networking 
site or a blog, or as a comment on another site, 
you should consider that action permanent and 
irreversible. Even if you can later remove an 
article, a photo, or a comment, it may still be dis-
coverable by someone at any time in the future.
Similarly, you should consider any and every 
communication, whether by email, chat, instant 
message, or photo, as public information and 
discoverable by others. For example, many 
recent scandals entailed famous people taking 
and sending private photographs to others, but 
that content was later revealed to the entire 
Internet, much to their embarrassment. Even 
online apps that promise to immediately delete 
text and images should not be considered safe.
Be clear about the reputation you want to 
develop and keep all communications —  
personal or professional — consistent with that 
brand image.

associates with whom you would not want to share details about your per-
sonal life, no matter how interesting.
If you’re heavily into personal social networking on Facebook or similar sites, 
and if you want to use Facebook as a part of your professional brand, you 
should build a separate Facebook page and keep your professional informa-
tion and connections restricted to that page. The same is true for Twitter, 
Pinterest, LinkedIn, your blog, and any other social networking site that you 
want to use for both personal and professional purposes.
You need to decide what degree of transparency you want in your public pro-
file, for both your professional and personal social networking. Also consider 
your privacy and personal safety, as well as that of your family members and 
other significant people in your life.
Search for yourself
A great way to see what others might discover about you online is to under-
take several detailed searches on yourself. Example of ways you might search 
include by
✓
✓Your full name
✓
✓Your email address
✓
✓Your residence address (try different combinations, such as 123 Elm St. 
and 123 Elm Street)
✓
✓Your date of birth together with your name (you’ll need to try a lot of 
different combinations)
✓
✓Your social security number
✓
✓Your work address
✓
✓Your work email address
✓
✓Any other details that are uniquely you
Because most search engines personalize results based on your location 
and past searches, obtain an unbiased look at your online image by signing 
out of your Google account, if you have one, or going to the right edge of the 
Google screen, pulling down the menu, and clicking New Incognito Window to 
hide your location, IP, address, past search activity, and other identifiers. On 
Safari, Bing, or Internet Explorer, select Private Browsing. On Firefox, select 
New Private Window from the File menu. Then study the results, including 
the results for images linked to your name.

205

 Chapter 11: Branding Yourself for Your Dream Career
Before you begin your next big job search, it’s a good idea to spend a few 
hours searching for yourself, because any prospective employer is likely 
to conduct online searches about you as well. When you know what can be 
discovered about you online, you can take steps to get content altered or 
removed (or change your social networking privacy settings so that a future 
employer won’t find those beer‐binging photos from college). At the very 
least, you can ramp up efforts to develop strong, well‐linked positive content 
that will push unflattering or off‐brand links further down the search results.
You can set up alert notifications with search services such as Google and 
Giga Alert to periodically email you regarding newly published pages with 
your specific keywords. These periodic searches can be a good way to dis-
cover new information that has been posted about you.
Working with Recruiters
Recruiters come in two flavors: Some are employees of a company looking to 
fill its own open positions, and others work for search firms that are looking 
to fill open positions for their corporate clients. In this section, we’re looking 
primarily at the latter.
Think of a recruiter as your business agent, who will go to bat for you and 
pitch you as an ideal candidate for their corporate clients. In this regard, you 
need to make sure that your recruiter knows you, your knowledge and skills, 
and the kind of job you are looking for.
If possible, meet with your recruiter in person. That way, you can better 
understand the recruiter and he or she can better understand you. Explain 
your strengths, background, and the kind of job and company you are inter-
ested in. Give them confidence that you are a solid candidate with skills and 
professional integrity. When recruiters present you to one or more of their 
clients, they are putting their reputation on the line: If a recruiter’s corporate 
client thinks you misrepresented yourself, the recruiter’s relationship with 
that client could be in jeopardy.
A recruiter who is familiar with you and who believes you’re a solid per-
former is more likely to think of you instead of other candidates and is more 
likely to propose you to more companies.

Creating a Winning Resume
In This Chapter
▶
▶Dissecting a typical resume
▶
▶Putting the right type of resume together for you
▶
▶Customizing resumes to target specific jobs
A 
 
resume is usually the first thing that a typical employer will view about 
an employment candidate. Often, as little as ten seconds is spent scan-
ning a resume before making an initial “keep or toss” decision, so it’s vital 
that the appearance, structure, and words in your resume give it the best 
chance of landing in the “keep” list instead of the trash.
The Basics of a Great Resume
Your resume is a written statement that describes your work experience, 
education, and short-term career goals. Your resume is your most ­important 
marketing tool. Often, recruiters and hiring managers form their first 
­impression of you based on your resume.
Prospective employers are looking for skills, but they are focused on read-
ing about your past accomplishments. How have you saved your employer 
money, improved security, solved serious issues, or improved efficiency? 
Tangible results are effective and capture a hiring manager’s attention. You 
need to emphasize positive results in your work experience.
In this section, you look at the various elements of a great resume. The later 
section, “Different Types of Resumes,” describes variations in a resume’s 
arrangement.
Chapter 12
www.allitebooks.com

208
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Heading
The top of the first page of your resume is the heading, and it contains your 
name and contact information. If you have prominent certifications, they may 
appear here as well. Figure 12-1 contains a few sample headings.
Summary
Many resumes include a sentence or a short paragraph describing the can-
didate’s mission or goals, or a statement about a desired position. Typically, 
this statement is about your experience and the position you want right now, 
not a position you want in the future. Your summary should tie directly into 
the position you are applying for and include a powerful statement regarding 
your experience, abilities, and meaningful accomplishments.
Example summary statements follow:
✓
✓Technology manager with eight years experience seeking a position in 
online financial services in software development or software QA.
✓
✓Security and compliance manager with experience managing successful 
PCI, SSAE16, and ISO27001 audits seeking a security leadership position 
in a SaaS company. Part-time university instructor and InfraGard board 
member.
The second example emphasizes accomplishments, in this case, successful 
audits.

 Chapter 12: Creating a Winning Resume
Employment history
The employment history section describes each job that you’ve had, along with 
relevant details. If you’re writing a chronological resume, each job will include a 
summary of responsibilities and accomplishments, as shown in Figure 12-2.
If you’re writing a functional resume, each entry will include the company, 
position, and timeframe; the details will appear elsewhere in the resume. 
Figure 12-3 depicts employment history entries in a functional resume.
Whether you are creating a chronological resume or a functional resume, 
make sure you list accomplishments and not merely responsibilities and skills.
For a description of chronological and functional resumes, see the “Different 
Types of Resumes” section, later in this chapter.
Education
The education section describes your formal education, such as the college, 
university, vocational school, or technical school you attended. Typically, this 
section is short and may appear before or after the employment history section.

If you have little higher education and work experience, you may need to 
include your high school education. However, professionals with a college 
degree probably don’t need to list their high school. If you do not have a col-
lege degree, list certifications and professional training.
Figure 12-4 contains a sample education section for a professional with more 
than ten years’ experience.
Training and certifications
Training and certifications may appear together in one section or separately. 
Or you might put training information in the education section. As you can 
see, no single right way to put this information together exists, as long as it is 
readable and accurate.
Someone with just a few training courses may want to list them individually. 
However, if you have 20–40 years of IT work experience, you’ll likely have 
more training courses than can fit in several pages of text! In such a situation, 
a short narrative for training might appear as shown in Figure 12-5.
Skills
People in a technology field learn a lot on the job, often without formal train-
ing, so be sure to include relevant skills on your resume. If you have a lot of 
skills in technology, you may want to group them in categories. Figure 12-6 
includes a good example.


 Chapter 12: Creating a Winning Resume
If you have too many skills to list, include relevant and up-to-date skills and 
discard the rest. For example, if you are applying for a Java developer job 
and your past experience includes Cobol and RPG, listing those skills may not 
be relevant. Look at what the company is seeking and highlight your related 
skills.
If you have a lot of skills but are light on employment history, you might 
place your skills section before your employment history section, so that 
someone reviewing your resume will see your skills first.
Other sections
Depending on your background, you might want to include additional sec-
tions on your resume. Whether to include each depends on several factors, 
such as the following:
✓
✓Company culture: Your research needs to include the company’s 
­culture — how the company behaves in the community and what it 
values. Tie yourself into that culture somehow, so that you look like 
a good fit. For instance, if a company you’re targeting emphasizes its 
­volunteer work, include a volunteer work section in your resume.
✓
✓Rounding out your profile: If you believe that you need to emphasize 
that you are more than just a programming machine, you may want to 
include a section listing your outside interests and involvements.
Some of the sections you might include in your resume are described next.
Interests
Some professionals include an “interests” section to demonstrate that 
they are not all work and no play. Outside interests can show that you are 
gregarious, have varied interests, and have a life outside work. If you know 
that you have a connection to your hiring manager (or someone higher up 
Figure 12-6: 
Skills 
summary in 
a resume.
www.allitebooks.com

212
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
in the company) through an outside interest, list it so that you become more 
familiar.
You could list interests in a short, bulleted list or in a few lines of text, such 
as “Interests include landscape photography, scuba diving, and RC airplanes.”
Industry associations
You can list your industry association memberships, including any positions 
beyond that of a general member. Figure 12-7 shows a typical industry asso-
ciations section.
Volunteer work
Often, professionals like to include a short section on volunteer work. It’s 
often not required, but it does demonstrate selflessness and a desire to help 
others. Employers usually appreciate someone who makes time for others, 
and volunteerism is a good indicator of someone who is comfortable in a 
variety of situations.
When filling in employment gaps, show that you kept busy.
References
Customarily, references are not included in a resume. In the past, including 
a general statement, such as “Professional and personal references available 
upon request,” was common. Now this statement is unnecessary; an 
employer is going to ask for references whether or not you include this 
statement.

 Chapter 12: Creating a Winning Resume
Formatting Your Resume
The format of your resume is as important as its content. If it’s cluttered and 
hard to read, a resume for the best candidate will be discarded as quickly as 
a well-written resume for an unqualified candidate.
A well-formatted resume has the following characteristics:
✓
✓Plenty of whitespace: Text should not crowd the top, bottom, or side 
margins. There should be room between sections and paragraphs.
✓
✓Absence of colors: Keep everything in one color — black.
✓
✓Single, readable font: The entire resume should be in one easily read 
font such as Times Roman, Helvetica, or Arial, with the following 
exceptions: The heading with your name can be slightly larger and 
in a different font, and the limited use of boldface and underline is 
acceptable.
✓
✓Visual simplicity: A good resume is beautiful in its simple elegance. In a 
good resume, less is better.
What I look for in a security resume
Whenever I am reviewing resumes for security 
positions in my organization, I look for the fol-
lowing things:
	✓	Certifications: Which ones, and how long 
the candidates have had them (the longer, 
the better)
	✓	Technology skills: Which technologies, 
including products and how they were 
used
	✓	Soft skills: How the candidate worked with 
people in their companies to solve prob-
lems and finish projects
A really long list of certifications might indicate 
too much emphasis on technology skills at the 
expense of vital people skills. I’d rather see 
three or four certifications than ten or more.
Problem solving, working on project teams, 
and completing complex projects mean more 
to me than a long list of technology skills. I find 
that you can train someone on new technolo-
gies but not on people skills. Those with the 
wrong people skills usually remain in that state 
throughout their careers.

✓
✓No graphics: So many of today’s applicant tracking and application 
systems parse and populate data from your resume. Graphics will cause 
problems and cause fields to be populated inaccurately. Avoid cool 
graphics and complicated formatting techniques with your resume. 
Unless you’re a graphic designer or a marketing campaign designer, 
hiring managers don’t care about the graphics and may consider them 
distracting. Recruiters definitely don’t like graphics, because they often 
must edit your resume, to, say, add a heading.
In short, a well-formatted resume is minimalist in its visual style.
Soft copy
When working with soft copy resumes that you’re sending via email or 
uploading to an employer’s website, a job search site, or a recruiter, it’s best 
to send the resume in Word or PDF format. If you’re working with an outside 
recruiter who will be presenting your resume to one or more employers, 
send your resume in Word format, with the document unlocked, because the 
recruiter might need to transform your resume into a particular format.
Although Acrobat’s cool features include prohibiting printing or copying text 
from a document, it’s better not to use these features in a resume you upload 
or email. An employer’s screening process might include the need to extract 
text from your resume, and you don’t want to do anything to interfere with 
that. Best to send your resume as a plain, unprotected PDF.
In most cases, RTF (Rich Text Format) is acceptable format for your resume. 
Based on the rules of simplicity, your resume probably wouldn’t need any-
thing other than RTF in the first place.
Hard copy
For organizations that want hard copy resumes, print them on good quality 
white copier paper. Printing on colored paper (even the slightest off-white), 
textured paper such as linen, or paper with a lot of flecks can be harmful. 
(However, you might consider recycled paper if the company is committed 
to recycling.) Yes, in many ways you need to stand out, but using a brightly 
colored or textured resume is risky.
You might consider printing your resume double-sided, to give your poten-
tial employer the impression that you know how to be a good steward of 
resources.

Cleaning up metadata
Before you send a soft copy resume, you need to be sure it’s free of metadata 
and other extraneous data that could cast you in a bad light. Check for the 
following:
✓
✓Document properties: Be sure that the document author and reviewers 
state your name or are blank. Check the description and also make sure 
that it contains your name or is blank.
✓
✓Check for tracked changes: If you have been using a Track Changes fea-
ture, be sure you have performed an “Accept All Changes” operation so 
that you are sending a completely clean resume free of any prior edits.
✓
✓Hidden and deleted data: When customizing resumes, you might mark 
some content as hidden. Sometimes, deleted content is still in the docu-
ment. Make sure you have all that cleaned up. One technique is to start 
with a new, blank document and copy the text from a clean resume into 
the new empty document.
For more on hard copy resumes, see Chapter 13, which details the contents 
of a cover letter, and Chapter 14, which describes the interview process.
Tailoring Your Resume
You need to create a targeted resume for each position you seek. Word pro-
cessing programs make this task fairly easy. However, be sure to develop a 
system to track each resume you send out.
Organizing your resumes
In this age of word processing programs, every resume should be customized 
for each particular job and company you’re targeting. The method you use 
to create your customized versions is up to you. Some suggested techniques 
follow:
✓
✓Super-sized resume (remove the parts you don’t need): Start with a 
master resume that includes lengthy descriptions of each job, educa-
tion, and so on — perhaps even multiple separate descriptions. Make 
a copy of the resume, and then remove the parts you don’t need. The 
result, those component parts that are just right for the position you are 
targeting.
www.allitebooks.com

216
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
✓
✓Franken-resume (build from different parts): From your collection of 
headings, summaries, employment positions, education, and more, pull 
together the pieces you want, in the order you want, to create that per-
fect, targeted resume.
✓
✓Modify the last resume you used: From the resume you most recently 
sent to another company, make all needed changes, so that your new 
resume is just right for the position you’re targeting.
	
	Content that you removed for a prior application may be relevant for a 
later one. Remember to restore content that you may need later.
Whichever method you use is up to you. Perhaps you have a system different 
from these that works for you. As long as you can keep your records orga-
nized and know which resume you sent to which company (and still have 
copies of each), you should be all right.
You should also consider keeping a worksheet that lists the resumes you 
used for each job. You might create a little database that includes a lot of dif-
ferent details about each position you targeted, who you spoke with, which 
resume you sent and to whom, and so on.
Customizing resume content
Every prospective job is different from every other. Even two jobs with 
the same job title are different. Every company has its own style and way 
of doing things. These considerations should compel you to take the time 
Using keywords to grab attention
Innovations in automated job posting sites such 
as Monster.com and Indeed.com have resulted 
in companies getting hundreds, and sometimes 
thousands, of resumes for each advertised job. 
As a result, companies have invested in soft-
ware that electronically evaluates resumes, 
based in part on the presence of certain key-
words. Too few keywords, and your resume will 
be routed to the bit bucket.
But just including a lot of keywords in your 
resume is not enough. If your resume gets 
through the first layer of screening, someone 
will be reading your resume to see if you sound 
like a candidate worth a phone screen. At this 
point, not so much what you say but how you 
say it gets you to the next level. Remember, 
though, that you’ll never get to that second level 
without the right keywords.

217

 Chapter 12: Creating a Winning Resume
to customize your resume for each job you apply for. Following are some 
­pointers that will guide this work:
✓
✓Match applicable skills and duties: Read through the job description 
carefully, and make sure that each skill and knowledge required appears 
in your resume when applicable. In other words, if a job description 
requires Active Directory administration and you have that skill, make 
sure you include it in each job where you performed this task.
✓
✓Emphasize company similarities: Employers like to hire people who 
are familiar with their industry. If you have work experience in the right 
industries, make sure your resume includes this information.
✓
✓Include required education: If an education level is cited in the job 
description, and you have the proper education, make sure you include 
it clearly in your resume.
To make sure your resume stands out from others, you may want to read 
other position postings from the same company to get a broader view of the 
desired skills. Also, find out what you can about the company. Search for arti-
cles (good or bad) in local press and trade publications to get an even better 
idea of their recent history.
Plagiarizing
Although looking at other people’s resumes is common, you should 
not borrow more than a phrase or two. Borrowing attractive styles and 
formats is okay. There is a tale of an employer who did an Internet search of 
a sentence in an applicant’s resume, and found that exact text (and more) 
on a sample resume found online. If you have someone else’s resume (or 
a sample) and you like the way something was said, seriously consider 
rewording it.
Types of Resumes
Every professional has a unique work history, education, skills, and career 
path, with different strengths and weaknesses. Because of this, no single 
resume structure will ideally highlight everyone’s strengths. For some, 
showing a progression of employment is ideal. For others, the best approach 
is to showcase skills and experience. In this section, you look at the two 
primary types of resumes and a type that’s a combination of the two.
www.allitebooks.com

218
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Chronological
A chronological resume lists work experience, typically in reverse chronologi-
cal order (with the most recent position first). A chronological resume is the 
most common resume type because it’s the easiest to build and maintain 
and because potential employers like to see a candidate’s recent positions, 
responsibilities, and accomplishments first.
You’ll want to use a chronological resume if you have continuous work 
­experience and your most recent positions are relevant to the company  
and position you’re targeting.
The typical order of sections in a chronological resume is
✓
✓Heading
✓
✓Summary
✓
✓Employment history, including detailed descriptions of each position 
and notable accomplishments
✓
✓Education
✓
✓Accomplishments, skills, training, interests, associations, volunteer 
work, and so on
Functional
A functional resume highlights your skills and work experience as your 
resume’s primary theme. You’ll use this type of resume if your recent  
work history doesn’t adequately show that you have recent, relevant  
Finding and using good examples
A good way to figure out how to structure your 
own resume is to view many other resumes 
and borrow what you like from each. Because 
resumes typically don’t contain overly sensitive 
information such as compensation, it’s usually 
appropriate to ask others for a copy of their 
resume. As long as you have a reputation of 
being trustworthy, most other professionals will 
consider your resume request a compliment. As 
you progress in your career, you might consider 
returning the favor to those who ask you for a 
copy of yours.

219

 Chapter 12: Creating a Winning Resume
work ­experience. For instance, if you’re seeking a programming job but your 
last position was something different, a functional resume can emphasize 
your programming skills even if they aren’t as current as you’d like.
Following are some reasons why you might want to use a functional resume 
include:
✓
✓A need to emphasize skills
✓
✓Little work experience
✓
✓Gaps in employment history
✓
✓Work in various industry sectors
✓
✓Employment history that doesn’t show a steady progression of job titles 
or responsibilities
✓
✓Employment history with a long work history in one position
Following is the typical order of sections in a functional resume:
✓
✓Heading
✓
✓Summary
✓
✓Accomplishments and skills
✓
✓Education
✓
✓Training
✓
✓Employment history, listing only employers, positions, and dates, with 
no other details
✓
✓Interests, associations, volunteer work, and so on
Note that in a functional resume, like a chronological resume, you put your 
best material early in the resume. In a functional resume, you emphasize your 
accomplishments, skills, and experience, whereas in a chronological resume 
you emphasize your employment positions.
Combination
A hybrid resume is a combination of chronological and functional resumes. A 
hybrid resume depicts both skills and employment history, and either one 
may appear first.
www.allitebooks.com

220
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
The typical order of sections in a hybrid resume follows:
✓
✓Heading
✓
✓Summary
✓
✓Skills, education, training
✓
✓Employment history, listing only employers, positions, and dates, with 
no other details
✓
✓Interests, associations, volunteer work, and so on
As mentioned, employment history could appear before the skills, education, 
and training sections.
No exact resume format exists. The types of resumes discussed in this chap-
ter should serve as a starting point for you to build the resume that perfectly 
and succinctly describes your skills and work experience.
What Not to Put in Your Resume
Although various countries have local practices on resume structure and 
content, in most locations you would never include certain items in a resume, 
such as the following:
✓
✓Compensation: You should keep records of your pay, but your resume 
is not the place to include this information.
✓
✓Date of birth: Because you already have your name and contact 
­information, including your date of birth might be excessive. A 
­potential employer will ask for your date of birth on an employment 
application form.
Resume or CV?
Is a CV (curriculum vitae) just a fancy term for 
resume, or is there a difference?
In some countries, a CV is a complete listing of 
all employment positions, education, and other 
relevant information, such as publications, 
whereas a resume is a summary of ­employment 
and education. Sometimes, however, the two 
are nearly identical.
A CV can be considered a long-form resume 
that may consist of many pages, whereas a 
resume is usually limited to two pages the front 
and back of A4 or letter-sized paper.

221

 Chapter 12: Creating a Winning Resume
✓
✓References: Usually, you supply references in a separate document.
✓
✓Opinion: Your opinion of an employer, good or bad, is best left off a 
resume.
✓
✓Work samples: Including samples of your work could make your resume 
too long and might violate confidentiality agreements.
Examples of Winning Resumes
This section provides a complete chronological resume, shown in Figure 12-8, 
and a complete functional resume, shown in Figure 12-9. Both resumes describe 
the same fictitious individual whose background makes each type of resume 
ideal for that person.
The chronological resume shows a typical progression of work experi-
ence and accomplishments, whereas the functional resume portrays skills, 
accomplishments, and experience unrelated to the positions in which they 
occurred.
Padding your resume
It’s a popular notion that everyone embellishes 
his or her resume to some extent. Yes, that 
statement probably contains some truth. Now 
and then we hear news stories about people 
padding their resumes and having to resign.
Your resume should be truthful. In the infor-
mation security profession, the nature of our 
responsibilities and our codes of ethics require 
a high standard of professional integrity. More 
than in many other professions, we should not 
even stretch the truth in our resume or in any 
other written statements about ourselves. Not 
even a little bit.

Getting Attention with  
Your Cover Letter
In This Chapter

▶
▶Learning the key elements of a cover letter
▶
▶Making your cover letter effective in today’s digital HR systems
Y
 
our cover letter is (probably) the first thing the hiring manager is going 
to see about you, so you want to make a good first impression.
A great deal of rumor, myth, and legend exists about what makes a good 
resume and how to construct one to maximize your success in getting an 
information security job. For some reason, the cover letter is often ignored 
in this process. Effective cover letters present the link between the job’s 
requirements and your background and aspirations. Although a resume 
states what you have done, the cover letter cuts to the chase and addresses 
why you are the right person for the job.
The cover letter has the following logic: “Here is what you said you want. 
Here is what I have done. Here is how it relates. Here’s my number, so call 
me, maybe.” (Apologies to Carly Rae Jepsen.)
The goal is to get the cover letter and resume into the hands of the hiring 
manager. In a perfect world, your resume would tell the screener in HR, be it 
an internal or external recruiter or the applicant‐tracking system, how good 
a fit you are. In the real world, the cover letter is your opportunity to spell it 
out for them.
Chapter 13

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Cover Letter Scenarios
At the highest conceptual level, your resume is fixed and you use the cover 
letter to express your interest to explain why you should be considered. 
In reality, with digital resumes, you can customize, or at least tune, your 
resume for each job opportunity. However, it is generally more expedient and 
effective to use the cover letter to answer the questions of how and why you 
are a fit.
You would write a cover letter in response to the following four scenarios:
✓
✓Response to a job posting: You see a job description that interests you 
in the careers section of a company website or on a job board, such as 
monster.com or indeed.com.
✓
✓Follow‐up letter of introduction: Let’s say your friend has a friend who 
needs someone with your skills and asks to see your resume. When you 
respond to this request, you had better include a cover letter that at 
least reminds the reader why you’ve sent your resume. A resume with-
out context is likely to end up in the bit bucket.
✓
✓Letter to a recruiter: Recruiters offer an invaluable service in 
connecting employers with prescreened candidates. The goal of 
this cover letter is to get you from the unscreened category to the 
prescreened category.
✓
✓Generic application: You can send your resume to a company to keep 
on file in case they have a need for someone like you.
The cover letter differs for each scenario. In general, you’ll spend most of 
your time writing cover letters in response to job postings. However, follow‐
up letters of introduction are more effective. Figure 13-1 shows the source of 
new jobs of all types, not specifically information security jobs.
This figure implies that you should focus on personal networking to get a job 
in information security. However, responses to job postings are something 
you can work on while you wait to hear back from your contacts. The next 
sections explore ways to make your responses to job postings as effective as 
possible.

how to create a winning resume in Chapter 12.

 Chapter 13: Getting Attention with Your Cover Letter
Essential Elements of the Cover Letter
Regardless of the scenario described in the preceding section, all cover 
­letters have the following common elements:
✓
✓Greeting: Say “hello” in some manner.
✓
✓Reason for the cover letter: Before you start writing about how good a 
fit you are, give the reader some context. The reader of your cover letter 
doesn’t necessarily know why he or she is reading it. Clarify who you are 
and the job you’re seeking.
✓
✓Logic of how you fit: In this element, which is the body of the letter, 
you tie their needs to your skills and experience, point by point. 
Don’t go down the list of every skill or experience stated in the job 
posting. Choose the two to four most critical requirements and focus 
a paragraph, maybe two, on those. You don’t want a cover letter to be 
too long.

✓
✓Call to action: Now that you’ve laid out your logic, tell them what to do. 
Cover letters without a call to action, even one as minimal as asking for a 
return call, leave the reader feeling flat. The letter leaves the impression 
that you are interested only in talking about yourself.
✓
✓Closing: At this point, your goal is to get an interview. In the closing, 
sound excited and mention that you are looking forward to hearing 
from them.
The traditional cover letter
Readers of a certain age will recall a formal process associated with sending 
prospective employers a cover letter and resume. You’d take the draft of 
your resume to a printer, who would print your order of 250 to 500 copies 
(without typos, you hoped).
Next, you’d write your cover letter to respond to a particular job or one of 
the other scenarios described previously. If you were cool, your resume, 
cover letter, and envelope would use the same high rag content paper, 
preferably ecru. Off they would go in the mailbox to the intended recipient. 
A sample cover letter of this type is shown in Figure 13-2.
Sending a traditional cover letter by post is now as outmoded as rotary 
phones and CRT monitors. Their use says that the user is stuck in the old 
ways.
Cover letters with applicant‐tracking 
systems
These days, the vast majority of job posting ads are on the Internet. Applying 
to them involves creating an identity on the applicant‐tracking system of the 
hiring company (or the recruiter). After you create a user name (often your 
email address) and establish a password, the system will typically import 
your resume to populate what it can.
It would be convenient if applicant‐tracking system could perfectly populate 
all routine data fields from a resume. But often, it does not. You as the job 
seeker get to spend your time both uploading your resume and then copying 
much of the same information into the fields. Although there are some efforts 
to improve this process, it is still painfully tedious.
Errors in cover letters are unacceptable.

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Many companies enable you to upload or copy‐and‐paste a cover letter. The 
image is Figure 13-3 is a typical example.
The following sections offer helpful guidelines when writing a cover letter.
Greeting
A formal greeting is “Dear Sir or Madam” or “To whom it may concern.” Some 
may find this type of greeting formal or stilted. With all due affection, get 
over it, unless you know that the company you’re applying to would be put 
off with formality. A more casual option is “Greetings” or “Hello.” You might 
be able to get away with “Hey there” if you’re applying to a company stuck in 
1960s counterculture. Otherwise, err on the side of formality.
Reason for the cover letter
The first sentences of the body of the cover letter give the reader some 
context as to why you’re contacting them. Do not assume that the reason is 
readily apparent. Be helpful and tell the hiring manager which job you are 
seeking.
A formal start might look like this: “I have read your posting about the 
position of Security Analyst at Hughes Aircraft Company. Based on your job 
description for this role, I have the skills and experience that you are seeking.”
Figure 13-3:

letter form

233

 Chapter 13: Getting Attention with Your Cover Letter
Adding the job number in this introduction is always appreciated and sends 
a signal that you know what you are doing and are organized. Managers want 
to hire people who are more organized than they.
Again, don’t worry if the introduction sounds formal. You can restructure it 
to fit your own voice, but don’t delete any information.
In your cover letter, don’t include phrases like “as you can see from my 
resume.”
Logic of how you fit
Next, explain from the company’s perspective why your skills and experience 
match what they need. These paragraphs need to be short and compelling, 
ideally highlighting the most relevant aspects of your background.
So how do you know what is compelling? You don’t. The best you can do is 
make inferences from the job description, and hope you get it right.
In any case, you need to tie your background to their needs. For example, if 
one of the first bullets in the job description refers to experience in risk anal-
ysis, by all means, talk about your experience in risk analysis.
A typical paragraph may begin with “The job description emphasizes experi-
ence in risk analysis. While a security analyst at Target Stores, I developed 
the risk analysis process and provided ongoing reports to management on 
risk‐related issues.”
Unsuccessful cover letters share these characteristics:
✓
✓Exclusive focus on what you have done: Tie your experience to 
the requirements in the job description. For example, having a great 
education is not enough; you must state how your education applies to 
the job.
✓
✓Hubris: If you give the impression that you are the best candidate in 
the entire world, the recruiter will think your ego is far too large for the 
organization.
✓
✓Poor grammar: Errors in the cover letter are showstoppers for many 
companies. If in doubt, ask someone to read your cover letter before 
you click Submit. Automated spell checking and grammar checking are 
not enough to catch every error.
Recognize that you must have experiences that relate in some way to the job. 
If not, applying is a waste of your time.
www.allitebooks.com

234
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Many of these fields have a spell checker. Do not rely on spell checkers. 
Write your cover letter using your computer’s word processor and save it 
along with the job description in a file. In this way, you are more likely to 
catch typos, which can kill an opportunity, and you’ll have a copy of your 
cover letter if you get the interview.
Call to action
When applying to a job through an applicant‐tracking system, about the only 
thing you can write for your call to action is “I look forward to hearing from 
you about this opportunity.” This one sentence communicates that you want 
something to happen and sends the message that you are a doer.
Closing
End your cover letter as you would if it were a hard copy. Write “Sincerely,” 
or “Sincerely yours,” and then put your name below it. Done.
When you have your letter prepared, copy and paste it into the cover letter 
box or upload it to the applicant‐tracking system.
Your cover letter (as well as your resume) will be digitally uploaded, and 
the applicant‐tracking system will search it using keywords. It is critically 
important that a search on relevant keywords will show multiple hits for your 
cover letter and resume.
As mentioned, most companies allow you to enter a cover letter. Some nota-
ble exceptions are Microsoft, Amazon.com, and Verizon. These organizations 
believe that they can discern what they need strictly from your resume. This 
approach saves applicants time and encourages them to submit many appli-
cations, without much discernment as to whether there is a good fit.
Persistence
Paula Abdul, now a famous celebrity, got her 
start as a cheerleader for the Los Angeles 
Lakers, but she was not immediately selected 
for the squad. In an interview with Arsenio 
Hall, miss Abdul confessed that she was cut. 
She reregistered, and tried out again. Again 
she was in a group that was cut, but she got in 
line with the group that was not. Then she was 
selected and started her career.
The message here is persistence. Do not give 
up on a position until they send you a letter 
stating that you are no longer under consider-
ation. Until you get that letter, feel free to keep 
on trying for similar jobs at that company or the 
same job if the position posting is updated. The 
folks in HR and hiring managers might change 
their mind. Even if the job description stays 
the same, they may realize that they were too 
selective. You may just have the skills that they 
now realize they need.

235

 Chapter 13: Getting Attention with Your Cover Letter
Cover letters for referrals and recruiters
When you send a cover letter to a referral or a recruiter, compose it in an 
email message. However, the cover letter is not an email to an old friend. You 
should come across as a professional. The elements of the cover letter are 
the same, but the content is adjusted to suit the context.
Greeting
The good news is that you have the person’s name. Use it. In an email mes-
sage, it is okay to write “Dear Miles” or just “Miles.” (Assuming the person’s 
name is Miles. Otherwise, it would be awkward.) Email is a casual medium, so 
there is no need to write, say, “Mr. Raymond.”
Reason for the cover letter
When you state the reason for the email, just lay it out there. “I was told by 
our mutual friend, Maya Randall, that you are seeking a security analyst and 
that you requested that I send my resume.” Similarly, a recruiter will want to 
know why you are sending the email. “I understand that you recruit security 
professionals for organizations in which I am interested” is sufficient.
Logic of how you fit
When you describe the logic of how your skills fit the requirements, be short 
and sweet. For example, “I have recently completed my Certified Information 
Systems Security Professional (CISSP), as Maya may have mentioned. I am 
now seeking the opportunity to use this certification at a firm such as yours.” 
For recruiters, you would write, “I have recently completed my Certified 
Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP). I understand that placing 
information security professionals like myself is your area of expertise.”
Call to action
Because you know the person’s name and contact information, you have the 
opportunity to follow up. Your call to action should be polite and should give 
the person a chance to contact you. For example, you might write, “I have 
attached my resume to more fully describe my background. Please let me 
know if you have any questions. I will follow up with you in a week.”
You need to be precise in your follow‐ups. If you say you will follow up in a 
week, follow up in a week — not sooner, not later.
Closing
In the closing, write “Sincerely,” on one line and your full name on the next. 
Some people omit the closing. This may be appropriate in correspondence 
with people you know, but it does not work here.

Generic replies to cover letters
When you get a response from a company that has reviewed your 
resume and cover letter but is not interested, they reassure you 
that they will keep your resume on file should another opportunity 
that better matches your background becomes available. It could 
happen. And the Cubs could win the World Series.
Although the chances that the employer will contact you in the 
future are slim, they are better than if you do nothing.
Your resume and cover letter will go into the applicant‐tracking 
system and be available should the hiring manager need some-
one with your qualifications. This aspect of an applicant‐tracking 
system works best when you have a unique skill.

he words on your resume and in your correspondence have taken you 
this far. The job interview is your opportunity to present your case on 
why you are the best candidate for the job.
At the same time, job interviews can be stressful. Regardless of whether you 
are introverted or extroverted, being on your A game for an extended period 
can take its toll. You can reduce your stress by being prepared.
The goal of this chapter is to give you the information you need to be as 
­prepared as possible for an interview. You explore the purpose of the job 
interview, the types of interview questions you might face, and ways to 
appear as confident as possible. You also find out what you should get out  
of the interview so you can determine whether the job is right for you.
Knowing Why Interviews Are Important
First things first. You are not an interchangeable cog in a wheel. Similarly, 
the job responsibilities of a security analyst differ depending on whether you 
work at the National Security Agency, a local school district, a white shoe law 
firm, or a dot.com start‐up. The technology is related, but the temperament 
of the users, the topology of the offices, the security requirements, and the 
corporate culture differ. All these factors contribute to the issue of whether a 
job is a good fit in terms of your technical competence and personality.

Your training, experiences, skills, flaws, ambitions, blind spots, strengths, 
and weaknesses define you. Your prospective employers also have training, 
experiences, skills, flaws, ambitions, blind spots, strengths, and weaknesses 
that define them. The interview is a chance to see whether the job and the 
company are a good fit for you and whether you are a good fit for them. Can 
we all just get along?
Being Prepared for the Interview
Preparation is critical for a successful interview. Sun Tzu, the author of the 
definitive book on military strategy and tactics, said, “Every battle is won 
before it’s ever fought.” The implication is that the side that is best prepared 
wins a battle.
Your goal is to get a job offer, so you must be as prepared as possible. You 
need to do a number of things to succeed: be prepared psychologically, know 
the prospective employer’s environment, make a great first impression, and 
know what to say and what to ask.
Preparing yourself psychologically
The interview process is necessary but not natural. To be successful, it helps 
to put yourself in the right frame of mind:
✓
✓Be on time. Getting there right on time creates stress, which you do  
not need, so arrive five to ten minutes early. If you arrive more than  
15 minutes early, just sit in your car or wait outside until you’re within 
15 minutes of your scheduled interview.
✓
✓Allow them to take control. If you are a take‐charge kind of person, let 
that go. You are on their turf now, so do as you’re told. Sit and go where 
they take you — with a smile on your face.
✓
✓Turn off your phone. Really. Do it. If it so much as vibrates, it can be 
interpreted as disrespectful to the interviewer. Do whatever you need to 
do to ensure that you give your interviewers your undivided attention.
✓
✓Take notes. Your memory is never as good as you think, in case you’ve 
forgotten. Bring a pad of paper. Ask your interviewers if it’s okay to take 
notes. If it is, write their name and some highlights. This information will  
come in handy when you write thank‐you notes. It may seem ironic to take 
notes on a pad of paper during an interview for a technology job, but  
using your computer, tablet, or smartphone instead would be distracting.

 Chapter 14: The Interview: Bringing Your Resume to Life
Investigating the corporate culture
Before the interview, investigate the company. Employers like to see inter-
viewees who have done their homework and are serious about this oppor-
tunity. A lack of basic understanding of what the company does is a big red 
flag for many managers. Do not fall into the trap that information security is a 
support function so knowing the company’s business is not that important.  
It is important to the management team who might want to hire you.
So how do you find out about the company? Following are your primary 
options:
✓
✓Read the company’s website. Read the website thoroughly. Look at 
other jobs they are advertising. You can learn more about the organi-
zation by reading its other open position descriptions. You can learn 
about the technologies in play, internal initiatives, and maybe a thing or 
two about new products or services they’re working on. Become familiar 
with their solutions and their customers. Know their founders and their 
board members.
✓
✓Find a contact at the target company via LinkedIn. If you’re not already 
on LinkedIn, put down this book right now and sign up. Come back to 
this page when you are finished and have linked with at least a few of 
your work friends. Not having a LinkedIn account when you are job 
­hunting is like not being on a social media site when you are an ado-
lescent and want to have social contacts. For more on LinkedIn, see 
Chapter 11.
After you have a stable of contacts, you can enter the name of the target 
company and see how well you are connected. When you find a contact 
inside your target company, ask them if you can meet or at least talk on 
the phone. I have never found a company where I learn more from the 
website than talking to an employee for five minutes.
✓
✓Find a contact at the target company via alumni networks. The same 
logic as described in the preceding point applies to using your alumni 
network. Talk to someone within the company. Only a stick‐in‐the‐mud 
will ignore a request for a brief call.
✓
✓Look up reviews on Glassdoor.com. If you can’t find a contact, look at 
company reviews on Glassdoor.com. After you log in, you can see how 
other employees rate your prospective employer. As long as you under-
stand that this site tends to be over‐represented with disgruntled former 
employees, you can find some interesting perspectives on what working 
at this firm is like.
www.allitebooks.com

240
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
✓
✓Study the company financials. If the target firm is publicly traded, 
check its profitability. If you have no idea what you are looking for, read 
some of the financial expert analyses of the firm. Your main concern 
is to know whether this position is open because they are growing like 
gangbusters and need help, or they are a sinking ship and the staff is 
leaving in droves.
✓
✓Poke around on the Internet. A good ol’ Internet search will uncover 
some interesting tidbits of information. Give it a try. You have nothing  
to lose!
Setting up for the first impression
Depending on the expert, it takes between one‐tenth of a second and seven 
seconds for a person to develop a first impression. Regardless of whether 
this is fair or not, it is human nature.
Remember two facts. One, that impression may be positive. In a moment, you 
learn about some ways to make a good impression (feel free to use these tips 
in other situations).
Two, you may never know what the interviewer is seeking. For example, in 
many cases, facial tattoos are problematic. However, when I worked with the 
hiring manager of a call center, he told me that as long as the candidate was 
polite on the phone and otherwise technically competent, facial ink was a 
plus. Too many employees from this call center were learning their skills and 
then leaving to work in retail. There’s nothing like a pentagram tattoo on the 
forehead to make for a loyal call center employee.
Be yourself. It does everyone a disservice if you pretend to be someone you 
are not. That said, you can be yourself and help your chances of creating a 
good first impression as follows:
✓
✓Wear clothes that are one step nicer than is worn in the office. So 
how do you know what they wear in the office? Unless you know that 
the interviewer wants you to dress business casual or even casual, you 
should wear a dark conservative suit, a white shirt (and for men, a tie). 
In most cases, it doesn’t hurt to be overdressed, but being underdressed 
can be devastating.
✓
✓Don’t smell. Don’t smell either good or bad. You don’t want to hit the 
interviewer with too much of your best perfume or cologne or the 
onions from your Big Mac. Good grooming is also essential.

241

 Chapter 14: The Interview: Bringing Your Resume to Life
✓
✓Show good posture. Good posture conveys confidence. Don’t sit back in 
your seat. Sit toward the front edge of your chair with your back tall and 
straight.
✓
✓Make eye contact and smile. Making eye contact is important in the 
majority of North America businesses, and a smile conveys confidence. 
Work on these skills to avoid making the interviewer feel awkward. 
However, these gestures can be a significant challenge to someone from 
a different culture. Native Americans, Latin Americans, and Asians, for 
example, may consider it rude to look someone directly in the eyes, 
­particularly when introduced to a person in a superior position. Know 
with whom you are interviewing.
The basic strategy is to make the interviewers feel at ease so that they can 
focus on your qualifications, not the spinach stuck in your teeth.
Most hiring managers are well trained in Equal Opportunity rules. If you are 
a member of a protected minority, do not make this an issue. Most compa-
nies actively want underrepresented minorities. Ideally, they want to give a 
person a chance, but some may only want to enhance their status with the 
bosses who are seeking to comply with nondiscrimination laws. Whatever 
the underlying cause, this requirement works best when you, the candidate, 
come across as competent in your area of expertise and not as a militant 
­promoting minority rights. Just be a good team player.
If, in spite of training the interviewing managers received, you are openly 
discriminated against, immediately document the offence. Relay your experi-
ence of discrimination to the HR department. If you’re certain that you’ve 
been asked an illegal question about your protected status, you probably 
don’t want to work in the organization anyway.
Preparing to say what interviewers  
want to hear
Beyond all the preparation, ultimately the interview will determine whether 
you have the technical chops to perform the job and the personal skills to 
mesh with the company’s culture. They want to find out if you are a better 
blend of technical skills and temperament than the other folks they are inter-
viewing.
It costs an organization a lot of time and effort to fire a person, so companies 
want to make sure that they are making the right decision when they bring 
you on in the first place.

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Regardless of the interview style, you can improve your chances of getting an 
offer by doing the following:
✓
✓Bring several hardcopies of your resume. If your interviewer does not 
have a copy (or, more likely, did not have time to read your resume 
before interviewing you), you can offer a hardcopy. It is not a total waste 
of your time if the interviewer does not have a resume on which to take 
notes, but it is close. A softcopy doesn’t work as well in the interview 
environment.
✓
✓Bring a hardcopy of the job description. This copy is for your reference 
during the interview. It is bad form for you to have your laptop open 
during an interview.
✓
✓Directly connect what is in the job description to the skills found on 
your resume. Citing examples of work experience and training in com-
parison to the words in the job posting makes a powerful case. Before 
the interview, put together a cheat sheet with the words in the job 
description on your left and your qualification on the right. The conver-
sation will flow better as you use your cheat sheet to link their require-
ments to your experience.
✓
✓Answer in the positive. If they ask if you have done something you have 
not done, respond with a related effort. For example, if they ask, “Have 
you performed an organization‐wide risk assessment?” you might say  
“I have performed risk analyses on our subsidiary companies and larger 
suppliers.” This would be factually correct and communicate that you 
are ready for the larger task. This advice takes some work, and you have 
to be on your toes to be a good spin‐doctor.
✓
✓Work your soft skills into the conversation. Add unsolicited details 
about how you anticipated problems and took appropriate action 
to help your employer avoid or solve them. Employers want to hire 
employees who prevent problems. They will hire a lower skilled 
employee who gets along well with people and can keep the distractions 
down. You win if you bring these up first.
✓
✓Discuss how you can add value to the company. A common frustra-
tion managers have is that employees think narrowly about doing their 
job and don’t think about how their job makes the company successful. 
Working in your past value contributions during the conversation will 
demonstrate an understanding of your job in the larger context.
Value is a key word in today’s business world. You should always speak of 
your contributions in terms of value.

243

 Chapter 14: The Interview: Bringing Your Resume to Life
Following are some things that you should not to do during an interview:
✓
✓Speak negatively about previous or current employers. You may work 
at the worst company in the world and for the worst boss in the uni-
verse. You may be desperate to get out of your current situation. Resist 
the temptation to say anything bad. This is an interview, not a therapy 
session. Do whatever it takes to stay positive. Talk about how you have 
grown and are now seeking greater challenges.
✓
✓Reveal confidential information. During the interview, never divulge 
details about your current company that could be considered confiden-
tial. If they want to obtain the experience that their competitor has paid 
for, let them make you an offer. Even after you are hired, it is poor form 
to traffic in confidential information. Your new company may appreciate 
it, but they will also know that you lack professional integrity.
✓
✓Misrepresent your skills, work history, training, or education. You will 
be found out, and being found out is cause for immediate dismissal in all 
50 states and the District of Columbia. If you get through the interview 
process and are hired under false pretenses, you will get to keep your 
paycheck during the two weeks in which they figure out the truth. You 
will then need to spend the rest of your career explaining why you were 
employed for such a short time. It’s just not worth it.
✓
✓Talk too long. Perhaps you enjoy interviews. You may find it fun to 
have the undivided attention of someone so you can talk about yourself. 
Avoid this trap.
Preparing to hear what you want to hear
As mentioned, the interview process is an excellent time to find out if this 
company is going to give you the fulfillment you are seeking. Assuming you 
are meeting multiple managers and prospective coworkers, you have the 
opportunity to find out if this company will give you the professional experi-
ence that moves you forward in life as well as the work/life balance that you 
need at this point in your journey.
Chapter 19 offers ten questions you can ask to find out whether this company 
will be a good fit for you. The assumption in these questions is that you know 
what you want beyond a big fat paycheck.
Consulting firms and startups are known for being demanding on your sched-
ule. More established firms, particularly ones in stable industries, do have 
their moments when all hands must be on deck, but these late‐night scenar-
ios are few and far between. It is best to consider where you want trade‐offs.

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
In addition, Part III discusses various types of organizations and their 
demands on your work‐life balance.
Types of Interviews and Tips for Each
In general, you won’t know what kind of interview you are going to experi-
ence. Beyond the start time, perhaps the end time, and directions to the facil-
ity, you will typically have no idea if you are going to one long interview or a 
series of short interviews. You won’t know whether you are interviewing with 
one person at a time, or a panel of interviewers. You won’t know if the focus 
will be on technical skills or other relevant characteristics. You will need to 
be prepared for any of these scenarios and roll with the punches as the day 
goes on. If you have a friendly contact on the inside, he or she may be able to 
provide you with insight.
The following are the most common forms of interviews you’ll encounter.
Open‐ended interview
An open‐ended interview is the simplest and most common type of inter-
view. The interviewer comes in and asks you to be taken through your work 
history. It is usually in your discretion whether you go from your earliest 
education to present day or the other way around. In either case, you should 
practice describing your professional journey. (I find it logical to start at the 
beginning.) Find a sympathetic friend or relative and practice before your 
first interview.
Be careful. If the interviewer asks for a summary of your job history, give 
them a brief summary. Let the interviewer ask for more details. Being long‐
winded on your first interview question is a fatal mistake!
The painful reality is that the interviewer may not have read your resume. 
Although this might seem discouraging, it is an opportunity because you can 
take the interviewer through your resume and highlight the technical and 
leadership areas that relate to the job description.
You can also let the interviewer see how you have grown professionally. By 
the end of the day, you may have repeated this story four or five times. Just 
remember that this is a new story for each person you meet. It is okay to 
enthusiastically emphasize the same points.

245

 Chapter 14: The Interview: Bringing Your Resume to Life
It will help to have some practice interviews. Few are smooth talkers the 
first time we talk about a subject, even if the subject is ourselves. Work with 
someone who does interview coaching professionally so you can get feed-
back. College and technical schools where you are an alumnus or have some 
affiliation often offer interview‐coaching service. Your state’s department of 
employment often offers interview‐coaching service to unemployed citizens.
Technical interview
The technical interview format tests your technical skills. Usually, a techni-
cal professional gives you a test consisting of true/false questions, multiple 
choice, open‐answer questions, or hands‐on problem solving. The questions 
help the company determine whether you can perform the tasks required in 
the position.
Technical interviews tend to go one of four ways. One, the interview is 
straightforward and you pass with no problem. Two, you are familiar with the 
questions but are a little rusty. Three, the questions are unfamiliar, and you 
come to realize that you don’t have the skills that they are seeking. Four, the 
questions have nothing to with the job as described.
The first scenario, or course, is the ideal. The second scenario is under your 
control but only before interview day. If you have any indication that there 
will be a technical interview, brush up on your certifications. How deeply 
you dive into refreshing depends on your motivation and available time. The 
trade‐off is that you have the chance to refresh your memory with manu-
als and other resources when you have the job. This is the challenge with 
technical interviews. As with so many other things in interviews, you can’t 
anticipate every question in every challenge you face. Being as prepared as 
possible is your only approach.
What if you find yourself in the third situation, where the questions look legit-
imate but you don’t have a clue where to start? This embarrassing situation 
will be made worse if you do not speak up to say that there must have been 
some misunderstanding about your qualifications. It takes courage to admit 
that you are not qualified, but your honesty may pay dividends later.
In the last situation, when you are asked questions that are not relevant for 
the job as described, perhaps the left hand in this company doesn’t know 
what the right hand is asking. The only saving grace in the situation is that 
the hiring process probably involves nontechnical interviews. That would be 
your opportunity to clarify that you are eager to take a technical test closer 
suited to the kind of work that you expect to be doing. It is risky, but the only 
thing you can do to save this opportunity.

246
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Another more recent version of the technical interview involves white board-
ing a technical challenge. The interviewer might present a scenario and then 
draw something on the whiteboard. You are then asked to add details and 
explain your logic. Or the interviewer might verbally describe a problem and 
ask you to whiteboard the problem and its solution.
Chances are, the interviewer is describing a current or recent issue, or some-
thing memorable from the past. Remember, this is an interview, so you need 
to treat the problem as theoretical. It is not a good idea to ask whether this is 
an actual problem that the business is facing right now.
If you are venturing into uncharted territory, don’t be afraid to say so, but 
keep talking through the problem and do the best you can. Unless the inter-
viewer tells you, you might not know whether the topic you’ve been asked to 
discuss is part of your job or something more advanced that you would not 
be expected to work on right away.
Behavioral interview
A recent trend in interviewing circles is to make the interview process more 
meaningful than one where the candidate repeatedly reviews his or her 
resume for a series of interviewers. In behavioral interviews, HR asks each 
interviewer to ask candidates about how they handled a situation or two.
At least in theory, HR collects the notes from the interviewers and shares 
them with the team. You can tell that this is the kind of interview when 
you get asked a questions that starts “Describe a situation where you.” For 
­example, describe a situation where you
✓
✓Had a difficult coworker and how you handled it
✓
✓Encountered a technical obstacle and how you overcame it.
✓
✓Set your sights too high
✓
✓Set your sights too low
✓
✓Were able to use persuasion to convince someone to see things your way
✓
✓Used good judgment and logic when solving a problem
✓
✓Had too many things to do and were required to prioritize your tasks
✓
✓Set a goal and were able to meet or exceed it
✓
✓Had to use your presentation skills to influence someone’s opinion
✓
✓Had to go above and beyond the call of duty to get a job done

247

 Chapter 14: The Interview: Bringing Your Resume to Life
✓
✓Showed initiative and took the lead
✓
✓Used your fact‐finding skills to solve a problem
✓
✓Anticipated potential problems and developed preventive measures
✓
✓Had to discipline or terminate an employee
You should have ready answers to these questions even if you do not have a 
behavioral interview. If you dig back through your experiences, you’ll proba-
bly come up with good answers even if they do not relate to a work situation. 
Your answers will show that you are competent and can think on your own.
Panel interview
Panel interviews are arguably more efficient than single interviews because 
you don’t have to repeat yourself multiple times covering the same back-
ground and qualifications. In this scenario, you walk into a room with a group 
of interviewers. Usually the more senior person will lead the questions, but 
everyone gets to ask questions and form their own impressions.
Many people find panel interviews to be more stressful than the other inter-
view types. If you fit this description, it might help to consider that you need 
to be truly on for only one interview.
Confrontational interview
In a confrontational interview, the interviewer comes in angry and challenges 
every statement you make. The interviewer challenges you when you are 
How deep is your knowledge?
I was interviewed for a consulting job in a small 
company. One of the company partners inter-
viewed me and asked technical question after 
technical question. I couldn’t answer many 
of them, and I politely told him so each time. 
I figured I was not going to get the job. But at 
the end of the interview, he said, “I knew you 
wouldn’t be able to answer every question.  
I ask hard questions to see how people respond 
to difficult situations, and because I want to 
know just how deep your knowledge goes.”
I was instantly relieved (and it probably showed), 
and I got the job!

right, when you are wrong, and when you voice an opinion. You may as well 
be a new recruit for the Marine Corps during your first week on Parris Island.
Thankfully, this kind of interview has gone out of vogue. Perhaps this interview 
technique weeds out candidates who would struggle under the stressful situa-
tion of working at the company. If you come across this kind of interview tech-
nique, take it with a grain of salt and try your best not to become flustered.
Your Turn to Ask Questions
In almost every interview, the interviewer will ask if you have any questions. 
Like other aspects of the interview, you need to prepare. Blurting out, “How do 
you like working here?” is not a good first response. This shallow question will 
almost always get a positive answer, whether the interviewer likes the job or not.
Before your interviews, write down some questions based on your research 
on the company or when reading other job descriptions or reviews from 
Glassdoor.com. Some examples follow:
✓
✓Ask whether the open position is new, or would you be replacing some-
one who left the company? (Don’t pry too much on the reason your 
­predecessor left.)
Videoconferencing interviews
Many companies now perform videoconfer-
encing interviews, for a variety of reasons. 
With more of the workforce working out of their 
homes, some of the people who may be inter-
viewing you may not live in the city where the 
company is located. Or perhaps you are inter-
viewing for a national company with people 
scattered all over. You might also be interview-
ing for a job in a city where you are considering 
relocating.
If you are in a videoconferencing interview (for 
example, Skype with video), you need to be 
­prepared:
✓	Find a quiet place free of distracting sights 
or sounds.
✓	Make sure your Internet connection is reli-
able and fast enough for high-quality video 
and audio.
✓	Check what the interviewer will see behind 
you.
✓	Check that the lighting on your face and 
background results in a good image.
✓	Test your technology with a friend to make 
sure your hardware and software work prop-
erly. Nothing is worse than experiencing tech-
nical problems during a video interview.
The rules for making a good first impression 
during in-person interviews apply also to video-
conferencing interviews.

249

 Chapter 14: The Interview: Bringing Your Resume to Life
✓
✓Ask questions about management above the hiring manager.
✓
✓Ask about current or upcoming projects that you may be a part of.
✓
✓Ask a follow‐up question on a topic discussed in this interview or a prior 
interview.
✓
✓Ask about recent events described in the company’s press releases.
If the company has had a security breach, be careful. It would be okay to 
acknowledge the breach and commiserate with them, but don’t ask for 
details. You don’t work there — yet.
Chapter 19 contains more ideas for questions you can ask in your interview.
Focusing on the Goal
To get an interview, at least someone in the company has read your resume 
and perhaps done a phone screen. You have followed the guidelines, aced 
the technical questions, and assured them that you are cool (or at least cool 
enough for this role). Now you want to end the interview with a strong close.
If you were an interviewer and had two equally qualified candidates, would 
you hire a person who is eager for the job or one who seems indifferent? The 
clear answer is that the one with energy and enthusiasm has the advantage. 
Be that person!
Offering the following information shows that you are ready, without being 
too pushy:
✓
✓Tell them when you could start. Don’t be shy about this. State it as a 
fact that you would need to give two weeks’ notice. Tell them if you need 
longer because of a project you are completing. In practice, companies 
struggle to move fast anyway. You will come across as a person who is 
positive and has integrity — and integrity is highly valued in the infor-
mation security profession.
✓
✓Ask for their contact information. You want the opportunity to follow 
up. Ask them if you may follow up if you haven’t heard from them in a 
certain timeframe, depending on when they tell you that you can expect 
to hear something.
✓
✓Mention any special circumstances. Assuming that things are looking 
good, tell them now if you have a non‐disclosure agreement (NDA) or a 
non‐compete clause. These can usually be managed. Telling them now is 
better than after you have an offer and they need to rescind it.

ven after a great interview, your job‐hunting tasks aren’t over. From  
writing thank‐you notes to negotiating your job offer, in this chapter  
you look at what you need to do to seal the deal.
Writing a Thank‐You Letter
Thank‐you letters are one of the easiest — and most overlooked — ways to 
stand out as a job candidate. Think about it. You’ve no doubt spent many 
hours creating your resume, writing cover letters, applying for jobs, and pre-
paring for and going to interviews. What’s another ten minutes of your time 
to write a short note of gratitude? A thank‐you note helps the interviewer 
remember who you are (which is helpful if the interviewer has talked to sev-
eral candidates over an extended period of time) and could be the icing on 
the cake that gets you the job!
You thought you were buying “Information Security Jobs For Dummies,” not 
“Business Etiquette For Dummies.” Actually, you bought both, because get-
ting and keeping any job requires proper business etiquette. And writing a 
thank‐you note is essential if you want to stand out as a candidate who is 
interested in working for the new organization.
In the last chapter, I mentioned that you should ask each interviewer for a 
business card. If you followed my advice, you know the full name, title, email 
address, and snail‐mail address of each interviewer.

If you don’t have all this information, check the company’s website to glean 
as much as you can. Then contact the HR department or the recruiter you 
worked with to provide the rest.
Within 24 hours of your interview, write a thank‐you letter to each person. 
This effort says a lot about who you are, your enthusiasm for the position, 
and how you would conduct yourself when employed. If nothing else, it sets 
you apart from the other schlubs who interviewed for this position and did 
not write a thank‐you note.
However, don’t write a hastily penned, canned note in the parking lot immedi-
ately after your interview. Spend the time to write a professional, meaningful, 
and personalized letter of gratitude.
Handwritten thank‐you notes are a nice touch, but if your penmanship isn’t 
neat and legible, stick with a typed letter or an email.
Thank you notes should be brief — typically no more than two or three short 
paragraphs. As with all written correspondence, use a business letter format 
and proofread your letter for proper grammar and spelling.
You might start your note with “Thank you for taking the time to meet today. 
I enjoyed our discussion about the opportunity, particularly the part where 
we found that we both took our Basic Networking class from Dr. Skolnick! 
Now that I have met many people from your team, I am even more excited 
about working at the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe.”
In addition to expressing appreciation for your interviewer’s time and consid-
eration, each thank‐you letter should include specific details from the inter-
view and then highlight something in your background that was relevant. 
(This is another reason why you should take notes in your interviews.) These 
people may have interviewed dozens of people, and it will help if you can 
stick out. For example:

✓Emphasize specific qualifications or discussion points in which that par-
ticular interviewer seemed to show interest.
✓
✓If the interviewer asked you a question that you didn’t answer as well 
as you would have liked, use the thank‐you letter as an opportunity to 
refine your answer.
✓
✓If you forgot to mention something important during the interview that 
may help their decision, bring it up.
✓
✓Summarize the two or three most important points that you want them 
to remember about you.

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
Finally, close your thank‐you letter by expressing your continued interest and 
enthusiasm for the company and the position.
Write a different thank‐you note for every person you meet at your interview 
and address each note by name. Be sure to include the receptionist and any 
assistants you met at the start of your interview (believe it or not, these are 
often some of the most important — and overlooked — people in the deci-
sion process. Always treat them professionally and courteously).
Following Up
As you wrap up your interview, you should clearly establish when, how, and 
with whom you should follow up regarding the status of your application (see 
Chapter 13). Then do it! If you agreed in the interview that you would follow 
up after one week via email, don’t call the interviewer three days later!
When you do follow up, be polite, courteous, and professional. Recognize 
that hiring decisions are important, so your interviewer will want to get 
it right. Also, the selection process doesn’t always move according to the 
hiring manager’s desired timetable, so if you follow up according to what was 
agreed in your interview only to be told “we’re still evaluating candidates,” 
don’t get impatient or press for more information than the organization is 
prepared to give at that time. Politely thank them, and ask when you should 
follow up next.
The follow‐up is different than the thank‐you letter. You write the thank‐you 
letter and send it the day after the interview. You do a follow‐up as stated 
during the interview.
Other Sources of Information about You
In addition to information collected in your application, resume, and inter-
view, employers use other sources of information to help them in the  
selection process. These include
✓
✓Professional and personal references
✓
✓Past employer verification
✓
✓Criminal background checks
✓
✓Pre‐employment tests
www.allitebooks.com

254
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
✓
✓Credit checks
✓
✓Records verification
✓
✓Social media (such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest)
You can read more about branding yourself with social media in Chapter 11.
Employers look at social media and networking profiles on Facebook, 
LinkedIn, and Twitter. Check that the information there is consistent with  
the information on your resume. Also make sure your social media accounts 
do not contain inappropriate information or pictures.
Professional and personal references
You should have at least three professional references to list on your employ-
ment application. Ideally, your references should be former managers or 
coworkers who have firsthand knowledge of your work experience. If possi-
ble, at least two of your references should be a former manager or supervisor 
who you worked for directly. However, for legal reasons, many companies 
have policies that limit the information that current employees can pro-
vide about former employees. Your best bet in these cases is to reference 
a former manager or coworker who is also no longer at the company where 
you previously worked together.
If you are just starting your career, include the names of one or two professors 
whose classes you took (and in which you received a good grade). It’s best to 
choose professors whose classes are related to the job you’re applying for.
Some applications require references other than former employers or manag-
ers! Be sure to read the application instructions carefully and have both pro-
fessional and personal references ready.
Other sources for references (both professional and personal) include class-
mates, consultants, or other business associates who may have worked 
with you closely on a temporary basis (for example, a specific project), and 
people who have worked with you outside a business setting (for example, in 
a volunteer activity or a charitable organization). As a last resort, you might 
include long‐time friends who work in the same industry as you and can 
vouch for your professional knowledge and character.
Never list relatives or casual acquaintances as references.
Before listing references on an application, contact them to ask for specific 
permission to list them as a reference. If it has been more than a few months 
since you’ve spoken to your references, spend some time filling in that 

255

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
­reference on what you’ve been doing in your career and what type of job 
you are pursuing now. You should also send a copy of your resume to your 
references so that they can recall some of your specific accomplishments 
during the reference call. It’s also a great opportunity for you to invite your 
references to pass your resume along to other companies or contacts for a 
possible job lead!
You should be sending customized resumes to each prospective employer 
(see Chapter 11), so if you’re listing someone as a reference for more than 
one company, you’ll need to send them each of those resumes and make sure 
they can easily tell which is which.
Prepare a list of references before going to your interview and have several 
copies available to provide to the interviewer in lieu of listing this informa-
tion on an application, if appropriate. In fact, prepare your list of references 
(including contacting your potential references) as early as possible in your 
job search. For each reference, list his or her name, title, address, phone, and 
e‐mail address, and a brief note about how you know the person and for how 
long you’ve known him or her.
Employers are aware that you aren’t going to knowingly provide them with 
bad or weak references. However, reference checks are still valuable to pro-
spective employers because they provide an opportunity to verify the infor-
mation you’ve provided during the interview. Also, a good human resources 
professional will ask open‐ended questions that may lead to the revelation of 
additional nuggets of information about you. Finally, prospective employers 
don’t have to limit their reference checks to the names you provide. A glance 
at your LinkedIn profile will quickly identify any connections you may have 
in common. Such a reference could either be a tremendous asset (a prospec-
tive employer will trust the information received from this person more than 
from someone they don’t know) or an embarrassing liability (a prospective 
employer will trust the information received from this person more than from 
someone they don’t know)!
You should have a list of six to eight references. Employers typically only  
ask for three references, but having additional references available is  
helpful when
✓
✓A prospective employer has difficulty contacting one of your references 
and is holding up your job offer because they are required to contact a 
minimum of three references.
✓
✓An employment application stipulates that previous employers cannot 
be listed as references.
✓
✓An opportunity exists for you to cherry‐pick your references. For exam-
ple, you discover during your interview that the interviewer knows one 
of your other references.

256
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Beyond asking for permission to list someone as a reference, you should 
also contact your references when a reference check is imminent.
Contacting your references after your interview is also a great opportunity 
to provide feedback about the interview itself. For example, if the inter-
viewer focused on specific areas of interest and character traits, your ref-
erences might be able to reinforce what you discussed in your interview. 
However, don’t be too specific — you don’t want your reference to sound 
coached.
Perhaps the most important call for you to make to your references is a 
thank‐you call or an appropriate gift after you get the job. Showing gratitude 
recognizes their part in helping you get your new job and helps ensure their 
willingness to help again in the future.
Past employer verification
Almost all employers will contact the human resources department of your 
past employers to verify the information you provide in your application 
and resume. For legal reasons, many employers are hesitant to provide any 
more information than whether or not you worked there and your dates 
of employment. Some will go a step further and may provide salary infor-
mation, job title, and whether or not you are eligible for rehire (whether 
you left on good or bad terms). In a few increasingly rare instances, a past 
employer is forthright in answering any questions your potential future 
employer may ask.
Despite the limited information that is generally provided by past employers, 
a prospective employer will do their due diligence and perform these verifi-
cation checks. Be certain that the information you provide in your applica-
tion and resume is 100 percent accurate. Even the smallest error or omission 
(such as mistaking the date you left a job three years earlier by one month) 
can cost you your next job!
Professional integrity is more important in information security than in 
other types of work. Don’t burn your bridges with any employer or even one 
person you work with. You never know whether disparaging information 
about you may find its way to your next prospective employer.

257

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
Criminal background checks
Local and national police record checks are inexpensive, and almost all 
employers routinely request these checks as part of the employment screen-
ing process. You’ll be required to sign an authorization and provide any 
other names you may have used in the past as well as your date of birth.
If you have any prior convictions, be sure to disclose this information in your 
employment application. If appropriate, discuss the circumstances of the 
conviction with the employer. Some employers automatically disqualify can-
didates with any type of arrest or conviction. Almost all employers, however, 
automatically disqualify candidates who fail to disclose this information. A 
criminal background check will reveal any information you may have omitted 
from your application.
If you think that an employer might discover something about your past, 
you may want to run a background check on yourself, to see what informa-
tion will be revealed. In some states, you are entitled to a copy of your back-
ground check (possibly for a fee).
Pre‐employment tests
Employers are increasingly using various types of pre‐employment tests to 
create a more complete profile of their job candidates. These tests may be 
administered at any point in the selection process: before scheduling an 
interview, during or after an interview, or before an offer is made.
Pre‐employment tests may include technical tests to validate your technical 
knowledge, skills tests to assess your ability to perform certain tasks or func-
tions, and personality tests to determine your fit in the company or team.
You can study for a technical test and practice for a skills test, but you can’t 
prepare for a personality test. You simply need to be honest — technically, 
there are no wrong answers. If your personality isn’t a good fit, you won’t be 
happy working at that company or on that team anyway!
The Myers‐Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the more popular per-
sonality tests that employers use to determine whether a candidate for a 
particular job would be a good fit. Myers‐Briggs has 16 classifications based 
on different combinations of personality traits: extroverted or introverted, 
sensitive or intuitive, thinking or feeling, and judging or perceiving, as 
shown in Table 14-1. You can find out more about the Myers‐Briggs test at 
www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type.

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Credit checks
A credit check may be required for certain leadership positions or in jobs 
with access to sensitive information (such as customer or financial data). 
Most companies in the financial industry require a credit check.
You will need to provide authorization for a credit check, as well as your 
social security number. For the most part, employers are primarily interested 
in bankruptcies, collections, and foreclosures. You should disclose bankrupt-
cies or foreclosures on your job application (if that information is requested) 
and be prepared to discuss them in your interview.
In some cases, your credit score may come into consideration as well. If you 
have concerns about your credit history, discuss those concerns during your 
interview. A credit score is a number — it doesn’t necessarily paint a complete 
picture of a candidate. A costly divorce or a medical emergency can hurt your 
credit score, but doesn’t (legally) reflect negatively on your suitability for a job.
If you have concerns about your credit history, being honest and forth-
right is generally the best policy. But be aware that some employers will be 
uncomfortable discussing these issues with you. For example, it is illegal 
for an interviewer to ask you about divorces and medical conditions issues. 
And if you volunteer this information, it can create a legal problem for the 
interviewer. If you are asked to give authorization for a full credit check, you 
should ask how that information will be used in the decision process and 
explain that extenuating circumstances have affected your credit score and 
you are willing to discuss them if necessary.
Records verification
In some instances, a potential employer may verify your educational and mili-
tary records, as well as any technical or professional certifications you hold.

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
An employer can easily verify that you attended a specific college or univer-
sity, but additional information about your academic record (such as specific 
grades) is next to impossible to obtain unless the employer requests a copy 
of your transcript.
Verification of military service usually involves requesting a copy of your DD 
Form 214, which includes dates of service, rank, awards, wars or campaigns 
in which you served, and the nature of your discharge (honorable, dishonor-
able, other than honorable).
Professional and technical certifications can generally be verified online for 
organizations that manage certifications.
Negotiating the Offer
If you were dreading the interview process, you’re in for a real treat now! 
After successfully impressing your interviewers and passing all their other 
pre‐employment screenings, your reward is the opportunity to negotiate 
the terms for your new job! Many people rank negotiating as a major phobia 
somewhere between public speaking and spiders.
However, you’re probably better at negotiating than you think. After all, you 
negotiate with people every day! Whether you’re asking for a day off from 
work, deciding which movie to see with your significant other, or figuring out 
what to eat for dinner, life is full of negotiations!
Never bring up the subject of compensation during your interview. Always let 
the interviewer start this discussion. If the interviewer tries to bring the sub-
ject up before you’ve had an adequate opportunity to discuss your qualifica-
tions, try to shift the discussion back to what you can offer the company. For 
example, you might say, “I’d like to know a little more about the company and 
position before discussing my compensation, so that we both understand the 
value I can bring to your organization.”
Interviewers will sometimes ask your salary requirements on your employ-
ment application or during a prescreening telephone interview. The purpose 
of the question at this time is to quickly eliminate candidates who are too far 
out of the position’s salary range (too high or too low). In these situations, 
try to shift the question back to the interviewer by asking their range for the 
position. Or present your salary history and a broad range of your own, while 
making it clear that you are open to negotiation and would like to learn more 
about the position and how you can benefit the company before giving a 
more specific answer.

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Approach the negotiation seeking a win‐win outcome. Ultimately, you want to 
be paid what you know you are worth, and your employer wants to compen-
sate you fairly and appropriately for the value you contribute to the organiza-
tion. Use the following strategies to negotiate your offer successfully:
✓
✓Be prepared. Offers are rarely made in the interview itself, but stranger 
things have happened. At a minimum, be prepared to discuss your 
salary requirements in the interview. This will often set the stage for 
later negotiations. And don’t get caught off guard if an offer does come 
through in the interview! Be ready to hammer out the details if the 
employer is ready to move forward.
✓
✓Do your homework. Know your market value and do appropriate 
research. If you’re looking at salary surveys, be sure to compare several 
surveys and use a median salary rather than an average (extremely high 
and low salaries will skew your results). Try to find surveys that target 
your job title, city or region, and industry. Also, talk to similar compa-
nies in your area (possibly even a few competitors) and to peers in your 
industry.
✓
✓Know what you want and what you need. Have a realistic salary in 
mind for what you want. This number should be the high end of your 
range. (If your number is too high, you could be immediately disquali-
fied.) Keep in mind that if you’re changing careers, you may have to take 
a temporary cut from your current salary. Also be careful not to price 
yourself out of a job (proper research will help you avoid this pitfall). 
At the low end of your range is the salary you need to cover your living 
expenses, relocation costs (if applicable), and transportation; maintain 
your desired lifestyle; and be happy! The difference between these two 
numbers should provide ample room for negotiation (at least $10,000). 
Make sure the organization knows that you are flexible on compensation.
✓
✓Discuss details before numbers. Get the total compensation package on 
the table before discussing specific numbers, and then mentally adjust 
your number up or down accordingly. Important factors to consider in 
the compensation package include
•	Health benefits (including eligibility, coverage, and cost of  
premiums)
•	Other insurance (such as life insurance, short‐term disability,  
and long‐term disability)
•	Retirement plans (including eligibility, options, vesting, and  
matching contributions)
•	Flexible work arrangements (for example, telecommuting options 
and flex hours or days)
•	Vacation and other paid time off (PTO)

261

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
•	Performance bonuses (based on company, team, and individual 
performance)
•	Performance evaluations and salary reviews (frequency and aver-
age rates)
•	Cost‐of‐living adjustments
•	Stock options
•	Career development opportunities such as continuing education, 
training, and certifications (including reimbursement, programs, 
and work schedule flexibility)
•	On‐site facilities such as cafeterias, daycare, fitness clubs, and 
medical clinics
•	Other tangible benefits (such as company cars, cell phone and 
Internet reimbursement, and product or service discounts)
✓
✓If your interviewer wants you to commit to a compensation figure (or 
range) before you fully understand the benefits, try to negotiate a meet-
ing with a benefits specialist, so that you can get to a final number that 
will work for you.
✓
✓Strengthen your position. Focus on your qualifications and the benefits 
you’ll bring to the company. Refer to your research about the industry, 
similar jobs in other companies, the cost of living, and any other factors, 
so the interviewer will know that you’ve done your homework and can 
understand how you objectively came up with your requirement.
✓
✓Don’t discuss expenses or other sources of income. Don’t try to 
rationalize your salary requirement by complaining about your stu-
dent loans, medical bills, car payments, or any other personal issues. 
Conversely, telling the interviewer about any other sources of income 
you have will weaken your position.
✓
✓Pay attention to the other negotiating party. Watch for nonverbal cues, 
such as facial expression, hand or arm gestures, and changes in tone, 
posture, or demeanor. Don’t let the negotiation become adversarial. 
Know when the negotiation is over and it’s time to put forth your final 
offer or (figuratively) walk away.
It is far better to negotiate in person than over the telephone or by letter or 
email. If you receive an offer by phone, letter, or email and the terms aren’t 
what you had hoped for, try to schedule a meeting to discuss the offer in 
person.
If your compensation needs are higher than the employer’s range, you may 
be able to make it work for you in other ways. For example, you might ask for 
additional time off, a signing bonus, or a vehicle allowance.
www.allitebooks.com

262
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Be aware that most offers must be accepted within a certain time period 
(usually a few days). Many offer letters state that the offer will expire on a 
given date. If not, ask the employer if you can have some time to consider 
the offer. This should prompt the employer to provide you with a reasonable 
deadline. If not, let the employer know when you will give them a decision 
and ask if your timeline is acceptable. Regardless of your initial reaction to 
the offer, always express your gratitude for the offer, continued interest in 
the company, and enthusiasm for the job.
Finally, remember that an offer isn’t an offer unless you get it in writing! Be 
sure the written offer letter includes everything that has been negotiated and 
agreed to, including your title, supervisor’s name, salary and benefits, and 
starting date. If anything needs to be corrected in the offer letter, let them 
know immediately.
Likewise, your acceptance of an offer isn’t an acceptance unless you give it 
to them in writing. Re‐state the pertinent information from the offer letter so 
that there is no confusion about the details of your offer, and express your 
gratitude and enthusiasm.
Breaking Up Is Hard to Do
After you have a written offer in hand and have accepted your new posi-
tion (and not a moment before), it’s time to break the news to your current 
employer. And no matter how excited you are about your new job or how 
badly you may want to leave your current job (“I can’t wait to see the look 
on so‐and‐so’s face when I quit!”), submitting your resignation is never easy, 
because resigning signals an end to the business relationship and possibly to 
some personal relationships at work.
Under no circumstances should you ever resign from your current job until 
you have a firm written offer that you have formally accepted in writing. No 
matter how excited you are about your new opportunity and how trivial such 
a formality may seem, far too often a job candidate will resign from a cur-
rent position only to have some sort of issue or misunderstanding arise that 
causes a “soft” job offer to be rescinded. Make sure that you both get the 
offer and accept it in writing (a formal letter or a simple email).
You can’t predict how your current employer will react. Will he or she be dev-
astated or tell you “not to let the door hit you in the gluteus maximus?” Will 
your employer try to entice you to stay by making a counteroffer or a promo-
tion? Or will he or she turn down your two weeks’ notice and have you imme-
diately escorted out of the building? Regardless of your employer’s reaction, 
remain professional and courteous when submitting your resignation.

263

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
Counteroffer
If a current employer offers to match an offer or promote you in response 
to your resignation, be skeptical. Ask yourself why you weren’t worth the 
increase in pay or responsibility before your resignation. Not all counterof-
fers are bad, but you were probably seeking a new position due to more than 
just your pay, so don’t lose sight of that.
Written resignation
Submit your resignation in writing. Your letter of resignation should be pro-
fessionally formatted, like any other business letter, and addressed to your 
immediate supervisor. The letter should be brief — three or four sentences. 
State that you are resigning your position and the effective date of your resig-
nation (or your expected last day), and include a brief statement of gratitude. 
It isn’t necessary to state where you are going, your reasons for resigning, 
or any other details. You should sign your letter of resignation and (ideally) 
submit it to your boss in a private meeting. Your letter of resignation will 
become part of your personnel record at that company.
Do not discuss your resignation with anyone until after you officially submit 
your written resignation to your boss. Then discuss it with others only if your 
boss does not ask you to keep the news of your resignation private (some 
companies do not announce personnel resignations). Ask your boss who you 
should transition your responsibilities to and if he or she has any specific 
areas of concern that you need to clarify, focus your efforts on, or document 
before your departure (such as your daily responsibilities, critical processes 
you perform, or a special project).
People will realize something’s up when you begin transitioning duties. 
If nothing is mentioned about keeping your resignation confidential or 
announcing it to your team, ask your boss how he or she would like you  
to address any questions that arise from your peers.
Giving notice
As a professional courtesy, give a minimum of two weeks’ notice. If you 
anticipate that your current employer will ask for a longer transition period 
(perhaps you’re involved in a critical project that will be completed in three 
weeks), discuss this with your new employer after you’ve accepted your writ-
ten offer (so that you don’t jeopardize your offer or weaken your negotiating 
position). If your new employer is unwilling to wait more than two weeks, 
www.allitebooks.com

264
Part IV: Getting Hired! 
you should provide your current employer with only the standard two weeks 
(unless you’re legally obligated to provide a longer period of notice in, for 
example, an employment contract).
If your current employer requests more than two weeks’ notice but your new 
employer needs you to start in two weeks, you may be able to work out an 
alternative arrangement with your current employer, such as a limited (paid 
or unpaid) consulting engagement.
If your new employer is unwilling to wait the standard two weeks, think care-
fully about whether or not you want to work at that company. Not provid-
ing two weeks’ notice is unprofessional and will burn bridges for you. An 
employer that doesn’t respect that norm probably engages in other unsavory 
business practices that you may later find disagreeable.
The purpose of giving two weeks’ notice is to ensure that your company 
can continue functioning smoothly after you leave. Of course, some people 
secretly hope that everything will fall apart when they’re gone so that the 
company will realize how valuable they were. This attitude is wrong. A better 
testament to your legacy is that the company doesn’t miss a beat when you 
leave because you’ve trained your successor thoroughly and documented 
your day‐to‐day responsibilities. Your company, your boss, and your cowork-
ers will all appreciate your effort.
Immediate termination
When companies immediately terminate an employee who attempts to 
resign, some do it out of spite but most do it to protect the company—and 
the employee, particularly IT employees. Terminating employment imme-
diately protects the company from an unscrupulous employee who may 
attempt to steal data or sabotage systems. Although such occurrences are 
rare, the potential liability far outweighs the benefits of a smooth transition, 
so immediate termination is the policy. For the employee, immediately termi-
nating your employment, and thus any access to sensitive systems or data, 
eliminates you as a suspect should a security breach or other major incident 
occur shortly after you resign. Most companies with such policies will often 
pay you for the two weeks you offered as notice, so you can think of it as a 
paid vacation!
Transitioning out
During your transition period, it’s important to work every day as if it were 
your first. Put forth your best effort until the end of your last day. You’ll be 

265

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
remembered for your professionalism during this time, which is important. 
(At the very least, a future employer will contact your past employers for ref-
erence checks.) You might also work with a former coworker again someday, 
perhaps at another company or if you return to your previous company in a 
new position.
Finally, as you’re saying your goodbyes, take the opportunity to update con-
tact information and build your professional network. Ask for letters of recom-
mendation from your managers and coworkers, if appropriate. Collect copies 
of your performance evaluations, commendations, awards, or laudatory 
e‐mails you may have received, and past work samples (if permitted). You 
might want to showcase these elements in your professional work portfolio.
Welcome Aboard!
Congratulations, you got the job! That was the easy part. Now it’s time to 
start planning your success in your new career.
Your first day will no doubt be filled with anticipation and excitement. You’ll 
meet lots of new people and start learning about your new job. Be sure to get 
off to a good start by being prepared and knowing what to expect.
After you accept your job offer, your new employer should provide you with 
some additional details, such as what time to show up on your first day (this 
may not be your normal starting time going forward), where to park, the 
dress code, and who you’ll be meeting with to start your day.
Even if you’re not normally a breakfast person, have a good breakfast. 
There’s no telling when you’ll get a lunch break or where you’ll eat on your 
first day.
Getting to work
Be sure you leave for work early on your first day and know how to get there! 
Being late is a terrible way to start a new job, and getting lost or stuck in 
traffic is an equally terrible excuse! Even if you’ve traveled there before, you 
might have done so in the middle of the day, when traffic conditions were dif-
ferent than in the early morning hours.
If you aren’t sure where to park, arrive early, park in a visitor space, and then 
ask the receptionist, security, human resources, or your new boss where you 
should move your car.

Part IV: Getting Hired! 
Wearing the right attire
Dress appropriately for your first day. Business casual (slacks and a dress 
shirt for men, or a dress or skirt and blouse for women) is always a safe bet. 
A business suit is also a good idea —particularly if you’re going to work in 
a professional office. If you find out later that you’re overdressed, you can 
always leave your jacket and tie at your desk. Don’t assume that casual attire 
is appropriate, even if everyone in the office was wearing jeans and t‐shirts 
during your interview. Were you interviewing on a Friday? Perhaps Fridays 
are casual days, but every other day of the week is more formal.
You’ll most likely start your day at the human resources department. 
They’ll have plenty of forms for you to complete (including the Employment 
Eligibility Verification Form I‐9 if you’re working in the U.S.) and policies to 
sign. Be sure you have two acceptable forms of identification and know your 
social security or tax identification number.
Go to www.uscis.gov for more information about the Employment 
Eligibility Verification Form I‐9 and acceptable forms of identification.
Most companies have an onboarding or orientation process that could last 
anywhere from a half day to several weeks. Always carry a notepad and pen 
so you can take notes and write down names of the people you meet.
Drug testing
Finally, be prepared for one more test when you begin your new job: a drug‐
screening test. Not all companies do a drug screening, but it’s still fairly 
common. You can’t study for this test, but you can definitely prepare for it 
by not taking any illegal drugs before starting your new job (or during your 
employment, for that matter).
Some employers make a job offer contingent on a successful drug screening. 
Make sure you know this well before your first day of work.
Although marijuana use is now legal in several states, employers may still 
have and enforce a zero‐tolerance drug policy. Employers have a right  
to enact a drug‐free workplace policy even for substances that are  
otherwise legal.

 Chapter 15: After the Interview
The next 89 days
Your first 90 days in any new job are usually considered a probationary 
period, in which an employer can dismiss you without cause or warning and 
without fear of reprisal. But that shouldn’t be your primary motivation for 
doing a great job during your first 90 days.
Your success in the first 90 days will largely lay the groundwork for your 
ongoing success at your new company for many years to come. During this 
important transition period, you’ll get to know your new boss and team mem-
bers, build strategic relationships, become acclimated to the corporate cul-
ture, and start making positive contributions.
Create a plan for what you need to accomplish in your first 90 days in your 
new job, with specific, measurable goals for you to achieve. This plan can be 
private — or even better, one that you work on with your new boss. Many 
companies provide new employees with a 90‐day performance review, and 
some consider giving you a small salary increase to accompany your success-
ful review!

Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM)
cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/ccm/
Published and maintained by Cloud Security Alliance, Cloud Controls Matrix 
(CCM) is a framework of controls for cloud service providers and of great 
value to organizations using services from cloud providers.
Unified Compliance Framework (UCF)
www.unifiedcompliance.com
Unified Compliance Framework (UCF) is a spreadsheet that maps the world’s 
information security standards, information security laws, and privacy laws 
to each other. UCF is a gigantic spreadsheet and a little unwieldy to use at 
first, but it’s a great resource for any organization that needs to reduce its 
patchwork of controls into a single unified set.
ISO27001
www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/ 
iso27001.htm
ISO27001:2013 — Information Technology Security Techniques and Information 
Security Management Systems Requirements is the latest version of the well-
known international standard for information security management. ISO27001 
is divided into two parts. The first part describes the structure for an effec-
tive ISMS (Information Security Management System), which is the set of 
processes used to manage security in an organization. The second part is an 
initial set of security controls that an organization can use until it has deter-
mined what additional controls are needed.

Open Web Application Security  
Project (OWASP)
www.owasp.org
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an organization dedi-
cated to the education of software developers so that they will write more 
secure code. The most popular resource at OWASP is the Top 10 Most

Part V: The Part of Tens 
COBIT is a complete IT controls framework for IT management and IT gov-
ernance. Why is this included in a list of resources for information security 
professionals? Simple: Without a solid foundation of IT controls, any effort to 
implement security controls is futile.
You need to be an ISACA member to obtain the COBIT Toolkit and other 
COBIT materials.

ongratulations! You’ve just completed a grueling interview in which you 
answered some of the most probing and thought‐provoking questions 
about yourself that anyone has ever asked. But your answer to one final, 
seemingly innocuous question could blow it all.
Interviewer: “Do you have any questions for me?”
You: “Uh, no. I believe you’ve answered any questions. Thank you.”
At best, this answer is a polite way to end the interview. At worst (and more 
likely), this answer may be construed as a cop-out that demonstrates a lack 
of intellectual curiosity, preparation, and interest in the company or the job!
Always be prepared with a few questions to ask at the end of the interview. 
It’s likely that the interviewer may have answered many of your questions 
Chapter 19
www.allitebooks.com

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
during the interview without you even having to ask them. And ideally, 
you’ve had several opportunities to ask questions and engage in meaningful 
dialogue during the interview. This chapter provides ten questions you might 
want ask.
You should always go into an interview with at least five or six questions 
written down. Be prepared to ask these questions during and at the end of 
the interview.
How Has Your Department Contributed 
to the Success of the Company?
You should include specific details about the company when you ask, “How 
has your department contributed to the success of the company?” Your goal 
is to show the interviewer that you researched the company. This question 
is also a great way to showcase your business acumen and demonstrate your 
understanding of what the company does. Far too many IT professionals get 
caught up in the cool technology and forget that IT supports the business — 
not the other way around (unless you happen to be applying for a job at an IT 
company)!
Everyone applying for the job will have some level of knowledge and experi-
ence in IT. Make yourself stand out as a candidate by demonstrating a keen 
understanding of the company’s core business.
If the company is publicly traded, their annual 10‐K Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) shareholders report is available on the company’s web-
site. This report contains a wealth of information about who’s who in the 
company, the overall strategic direction, and detailed financial data. Let the 
interviewer know that you’ve studied this report by asking questions that 
begin along the lines of “I see in your latest 10‐K filing that the company’s 
price‐to‐earnings ratio has increased to 28 times earnings over the past three 
quarters.”
Getting information about private companies is more difficult because these 
companies tend to keep their financial performance data, well, private. 
However, you can still get a wealth of information from the company’s web-
site, press releases, and other sources. Both public and private companies‐ 
love to tout their successes in the local media. Look for news interviews with 
company officers in local business journals and special interest stories such 
as a charitable cause the company supports, a recent community outreach 
project, a new diversity initiative, or a recent expansion or new client that 
the company is excited to talk or write about.

287

 Chapter 19: Ten Great Questions to Ask Your Interviewer
Complete your question by asking how the interviewer’s department or team 
has contributed to that success. People usually enjoy talking about their 
accomplishments, so this question should lead to an engaging discussion and 
will also give you some insight on your potential new boss. Does the person 
speak with humility and downplay the team’s contributions? Or does he or 
she burst with pride while offering specific examples and calling attention 
to key individuals on the team? After the interviewer answers this question, 
make it personal by explaining how you would help the team continue to suc-
ceed and contribute to the company’s success.
Do your homework! If the company has had some recent struggles or set-
backs, you don’t want to ask about their recent success! In such cases, you 
may not want to ask this type of question at all.
What Are Some of the Biggest Challenges 
Your Department Is Facing?
To learn more about the company overall and some of the specific projects 
you may be working on if you get hired, ask “What are some of the biggest 
challenges your department is facing?” Your interviewer may not be comfort-
able giving you specifics, but you can still glean a lot of information from the 
answers you do get.
For example, your interviewer is unlikely to tell you “We’re really short-
handed since a lot of people have quit because of the long hours we work.” 
But you might gain some helpful insight from an answer such as “We’ve had 
some turnover recently.”
And it’s unlikely that you’ll hear, “Well, we’ve been behind the eight ball since 
that huge security breach last month, so we’re scrambling to shore up the 
network infrastructure.” But you might learn about a new initiative to build 
out a hybrid cloud infrastructure and that the executive team has concerns 
around security in the public cloud. There’s your opportunity to talk about 
how your experience at your last company can help them address those  
challenges!
The answers to this question may also give you some idea of how urgently 
the company needs to fill the position and could strengthen your negotiating 
position when you get the job offer!

Part V: The Part of Tens 
What Keeps You Excited About Coming 
to Work Every Day?
Cultural fit is at least as important as your skills and experience. If your per-
sonality isn’t in sync and your values aren’t aligned with the company, you 
don’t want the job. Period. You won’t be happy, your new employer won’t 
be happy, and you’ll inevitably part ways on terms that leave neither of you 
happy.
Some people thrive in large organizations; others prefer a small company. 
Some people enjoy working in a loud, chaotic environment. Others prefer 
order and solitude. Some people need clear direction; others need autonomy. 
Understand who you are and what values are most important to you.
Listen carefully to your interviewer’s answer to the question, “How would 
you describe the company’s culture?” The answer will give you an idea 
of how happy people are working for the company. Does the interviewer 
describe the culture with passion and enthusiasm? Do you get specific 
examples? Does the interviewer explain how the culture affects him or her 
personally? Or does the person just recite the company’s mission and values 
statement? It’s hard to be passionate about a company’s culture if the truth 
is that your interviewer can’t stand his or her job and dreads coming to work 
every day. If that’s the case, do you really want to work there?
Ask open‐ended questions that enable follow‐on questions and further dis-
cussion. After the interviewer answers your question, thank him or her and 
continue by explaining how you fit in or can contribute to the company 
based on the answer. For example, “Thank you for giving me that insight into 
your company’s culture. Cultural fit is very important. XYZ company has a 
similar culture and when I worked there I believe I was an integral part of that 
culture because. . .”
What Do You Like About Working Here?
If you want to know what you might find rewarding about the job, ask “What 
do you like about working here?” You want to get answers at different levels, 
so that you can get several perspectives.
Next, you want to find out about the organization as a whole. Are people 
proud to be working there? The mood and the tone in the organization will 
affect you. Again, if people are unhappy, you’ll hear this more in what they 
don’t say than in what they do say.

 Chapter 19: Ten Great Questions to Ask Your Interviewer
If everyone is all smiles, you may have found the ideal organization where 
everyone is happy, or maybe they’re putting happy dust in the coffee every 
morning. Somehow, you’ll want to get to the bottom of everyone’s bliss if it 
feels superficial.
Can You Describe How We Would  
Be Working Together?
Because a large part of your work satisfaction depends on your relationship 
with your boss, you need to ask, “Can you describe how we would be  
working together?”
There is no good or bad answer, because individual work habits drive how 
people work by themselves and with each other. However, you need to be 
able to determine whether you will find your manager’s style compatible. 
You want the working relationship to be harmonious from day one.
There may be better ways to ask this question, such as:
✓
✓“What sort of daily, weekly, or monthly status reporting will you require 
of me?”
✓
✓“How much freedom will I have in the regular tasks that I’ll be expected 
to perform?”
What Is the Makeup of the Team or 
Organization?
If someone hasn’t already described the team’s makeup, you might ask, 
“What is the makeup of the team or organization?” You are not looking for 
actual names, but instead you’re trying to understand how the team or orga-
nization is structured.
You can ask about the position titles for others on the team, and to under-
stand what their responsibilities are. Chances are you will be working closely 
with most of them, and that you’ll be asked to fill in for some of them while 
they are out sick or on vacation. In fact, this is another good line of question-
ing that will tell you more about team dynamics.

290
Part V: The Part of Tens 
What Are the Key Traits of Your Most 
Successful Employees?
By asking, “What are the key traits of your most successful employees?” 
you’re asking about the traits the interviewer is looking for in you.
Expend some effort interpreting the answers you get to this question. The 
interviewer might be telling you what is expected of everyone on the team 
and, if so, his or her answer might reflect a team dynamic or insight into the 
company’s definition of success.
If you can, find out whether the company has published a set of guiding prin-
ciples. If you’re lucky, they’ll be framed and hanging on the wall in the confer-
ence room where you’re being interviewed. See whether or not interviewers 
describe traits straight from the guiding principles.
Interviewers might be telling you about the successful employees on the 
team and how they got that way. That may, or may not, mean that you need 
to have those same traits. But as team dynamics go, you might have different 
traits that could help the team be even more successful. Often, a diversity 
of skills makes a team more successful than a team in which everyone has 
the same strengths and weaknesses. Ask a follow‐up question or two to see 
which is the case.
How Would You Define Success  
During the First 90 Days?
The question “How would you define success during the first 90 days?” will 
tell you a lot about the level of maturity and organization in the team you’re 
considering joining. If the team (or the hiring manager) is not well organized, 
they might not have a good answer for this question. They may be frantically 
working to put out fires with no time for even short‐term planning; they just 
need another set of hands to pass buckets of water along the bucket brigade! 
If this is the case, think long and hard about whether this is the kind of posi-
tion you want. Perhaps the company is looking to hire someone to replace 
one or more burnouts. Or maybe they want help to move the organization to 
the next level, which would be an extraordinary opportunity.
If you interview with a more organized team (or manager), they will be more 
likely to know what success looks like. And you’ll have an idea of what will be 
expected of you in the first few months.

 Chapter 19: Ten Great Questions to Ask Your Interviewer
Honestly assess whether you are up to the job (or almost up to the job). Ask 
any follow‐up questions, such as what resources will be available to you right 
away. Discuss tools that are available as well as the company’s plans for 
future tools and technology.
Just as the company will put new hires on a 90‐day probation, you should 
do the same with your employer. After 90 days, reassess whether this is 
the company you thought you were joining and whether they have met or 
exceeded your expectations.
Do You Have Any Concerns About Me 
That I Can Address Now?
You’ll want to appear as the ideal, near‐perfect candidate to your interview-
ers. But every employee has some imperfection, large or small. It takes a bit 
of courage to ask, “Do you have any concerns about me that I can address 
now?” The interviewer may answer with a gap in your skills or knowledge 
that is a shortcoming.
Do not despair and keep your good attitude. Consider the interviewer’s point 
of view and tell him that you agree with his observation. If you can do so real-
istically, tell the interviewer what, if anything, you can do about the short-
coming. Every candidate has shortcomings, and the company may be willing 
to take you as‐is.
What Is Your Next Step in the  
Selection Process?
“What is your next step in the selection process?” is a great question at the 
end of the interview. The answer helps clarify the next steps to expect, such 
as when and how you should follow up with the interviewer, whether or not 
there will be additional interviews (perhaps with human resources or other 
team members), and how long you should expect to wait before a hiring 
­decision is made. Following are some variations of this question:
✓
✓“When should I expect to hear from you?”
✓
✓“When and how should I follow up with you?”
✓
✓“How soon do you expect to make a hiring decision?”

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Be specific during your follow‐up at the end of the interview. After asking, 
“When can I expect to hear from you?” follow up with “If I haven’t heard from 
you by that date, may I follow up on [date]?”
After the interviewer answers this question, be sure to thank her for her 
answer and for taking the time to meet with you. Then restate the next steps 
so the interviewer knows that you understand her answer and knows what to 
expect from you. Finally, and most importantly, close with a crisp summary 
statement that asserts your enthusiasm for the position and the value you will 
bring to the table! If you are truly enthusiastic about the position and want 
the job, let the interviewer know. “I am excited about the opportunity to work 
at Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe and look forward to hearing from you soon.”
The answer to this question may also provide insight into how well you did in 
the interview. For example, the interviewer may tell you she’d like to go ahead 
and schedule you to meet the rest of her team. A vague answer, such as “Well, 
we still have several other candidates to interview but we’ll be in touch” 
might indicate some concerns or a lack of interest in you as a candidate.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Peter H. Gregory would like to thank Amy Fandrei, Acquisitions Editor at 
Wiley, for her vision and guidance. Thank you to Susan Pink for her expert 
copyediting and for keeping this project organized, and to subject matter 
experts Wendell Tankersley and Tim Heagarty for their productive and valu-
able feedback. 
Heartfelt thanks to several contributors, including Dave Matthews (the Seattle 
InfoSec pro, not the band leader), Brian Haller, Marc Gordon, Richard N., Todd 
Plesco, and Glen Sorenson for their anecdotal descriptions of life as an infor-
mation security professional. 
Next, I would like to thank the information security professionals I’ve had the 
pleasure of knowing and working with over the past twenty‐plus years. You 
have enriched my professional life through assistance, large and small. We need 
many more like you, which is the primary motivation for writing this book. 
My contribution to this book would not have been possible without support of 
my wife and business manager, Rebekah Gregory. Thanks also to Carole Jelen, 
my literary agent, with whom I’ve had the pleasure of knowing and working 
with for over fifteen years.
