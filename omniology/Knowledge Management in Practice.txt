Foreword
People and civilizations desire and cherish wisdom—inspired wisdom or the kind 
from experience that leads to deep expertise. In knowledge professions, the path-
way to wisdom is data → information → knowledge. As the penultimate step, 
knowledge involves notions of the nature of an expert versus a novice, heuristics 
based on experience, and depth versus narrow intelligence. The pathway starts with 
the imperative for clean, relevant, error-free data in a form suitable for analytics 
and scientific analysis. Information should be relevant to the needs of the users, in 
an appropriate format for interpreting and archiving, and should be presented for 
convenient visualization.
People in small communities and large organizations collaborate and share their 
experiences, so capturing and reusing their knowledge are important for increasing 
group effectiveness and efficiency as well as for fostering innovation. For organiza-
tions, a key challenge is to identify needs for collaboration and to share collective 
knowledge. This means understanding who holds knowledge and what knowledge 
they have. Tools, techniques, and processes are thus needed to capture, store, and 
reuse the many types and instances of knowledge in an organization.
KM includes practices and procedures, as well as the people and systems, that 
support societies’ information and knowledge needs. This includes ways to encour-
age organizations and individuals to add value and share knowledge. Managers 
and knowledge professionals then implement KM methods and techniques, dif-
ferentiating them for specific industries and subject areas. In practice, KM must 
address the varying requirements in specific industries such as healthcare, human 
resources, military, and finance. The different environments and cultures require 
consistent procedures that identify and analyze relevant content, organize knowl-
edge, create effective access, and promote a knowledge-sharing culture through 
education and training.
Organizations need detailed information on applying KM practices to solve real-
world problems. They need to establish organizational policies that lead to success-
ful KM adoption and to understand reasons why KM projects fail. Organizations 
need to apply known lessons and tips to ensure successful implementation of KM 
practices and to elevate the value of adopting KM policies.

xx ◾ Foreword
Dr. Anthony Rhem’s Knowledge Management in Practice is unique in the degree 
to which his extensive experience informs his insights and writing. At a time of such 
great attention to Big Data and data analytics, this book reminds us that knowl-
edge is after all the ultimate goal of careful work with data and the creation of 
accurate information. Identifying, capturing, and managing knowledge as a criti-
cally important asset are formidable tasks in our large corporate and governmental 
organizations. This evidence-based book provides the framework and guidelines 
that professionals need for working with the contemporary explosion of data that 
is creating opportunities and challenges to all phases of our society and commerce. 
To our benefit, this book captures the considerable wisdom Dr. Rhem has acquired 
over his career as a KM professional.

Preface
Knowledge is recognized as a valuable asset in organizations across many  industries. 
How knowledge is shared, leveraged, obtained, and managed will be the difference in 
how successful and sustainable an organization will become. This book is a culmina-
tion of my years of experience in the knowledge management (KM) discipline. Since 
1998, I have been involved in various KM activities such as researching, developing 
processes for capturing and codifying knowledge, developing KM systems, developing 
and operationalizing KM strategies across several industries, writing articles and books, 
developing and teaching KM curriculum, and speaking at numerous KM conferences.
Why I Wrote This Book
The use of KM principles, practices, and procedures has expanded enormously since 
2010. This expansion has also brought about the proliferation of KM systems in its 
many forms such as contact center knowledge repositories, expertise locators, content 
management, document management, knowledge repositories/libraries, social media 
applications, and decision support systems. The inclusion of KM from a strategic 
point of view to streamline revenue, increase revenue, improve performance, attract/
retain customers, and manage human capital has enabled organizations to maintain 
and/or improve their competitive edge. To compete in a local, national, and/or global 
market, organizations, including educational, government, and  military, are looking 
for that differentiator, and KM has proved to be just that. I wrote this book to cap-
ture and make available my experience in implementing and practicing KM across 
many organizations to scholars and practitioners of KM. This book is a resource that 
presents how KM is being implemented along with specific KM  methods, tips, tech-
niques, and best practices to get the most out of a KM investment.
What This Book Is About
This book covers how knowledge management is leveraged in several industries. 
The various uses of KM practices, policies, procedures, and methods, including 
tips and techniques, to create a competitive advantage are examined. Industries 

xxii ◾ Preface
such as first responders, military, healthcare, insurance, financial services, legal, 
human resources, merger and acquisition (M&A) firms, and research institutions 
are covered in this book.
Essential KM concepts are also explored not only from a foundational perspec-
tive but also from a practical application. These KM concepts include capturing 
and codifying tacit and explicit knowledge, KM methods, information architec-
ture, search, KM and social media, KM and Big Data, adoption of KM, and why 
KM initiatives fail.
The following are the subjects that are covered, and what you can expect from 
the various chapters:
 
◾Chapter 2: The Case for Implementing Knowledge Management 
This chapter details the factors you must consider before implementing KM 
in your organization and details the various practices and policies of KM. 
Moreover, the needs for your organization to launch a KM initiative/
project and/or establish a KM program are addressed.
 
◾Chapter 3: Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media
This chapter examines how social media tools and techniques are becom-
ing facilitators of knowledge for the organization. Specific guidance and 
insights are given to develop your organization’s social media strategy and 
to determine the social media tools, techniques, and platforms that can 
be used to take advantage of what social media can bring to KM.
 
◾Chapter 4: Dude, “Where’s My Car?”: Utilizing Search in Knowledge 
Management
This chapter details the importance of search in KM, in particular a KM sys-
tem. Several aspects of implementing search are examined, including the 
importance of having user-centric information architecture.
 
◾Chapter 5: The Age of Discovery: Knowledge Management in Research 
Institutions
Research institutions play a key role in product innovation. KM is a catalyst 
for stimulating and sustaining a high level of innovation. This chapter 
examines how KM is used, focusing on various KM methods that can 
and in some cases are being incorporated at research institutions.
 
◾Chapter 6: “Where Have All My Experts Gone?”: Knowledge Management 
in Human Resources and Talent Management
When it comes to talent management, KM can play a critical role in ensuring 
that the knowledge assets are captured and made available to the enter-
prise. KM in talent management when applied holistically involves captur-
ing and sharing employee knowledge from onboarding to exit interview.
 
◾Chapter 7: “Sound the Alarm!”: Knowledge Management in Emergency and 
Disaster Preparedness
Emergency and disaster preparedness is enhanced through the incorporation 
of KM. Putting the right knowledge in the right context at the right time 

Preface ◾ xxiii
in the hands of first responders could be the difference in saving lives 
and preventing casualties. It is important to begin with a comprehensive 
KM strategy to establishing a plan to deliver the knowledge in a timely 
manner.
 
◾Chapter 8: Happily Ever After: Knowledge Management in Mergers and 
Acquisitions
When organizations merge or are acquired, there is a level of uncertainty 
both from a macro (organization) level and from a micro (employee) 
level. Applying KM to M&A will enable the organization to know what 
knowledge is important to retain, who those knowledge holders are, what 
are the knowledge gaps, and how to quantify the knowledge of the orga-
nization. From an employee standpoint, having the organization share 
knowledge about the pending transaction as well as incentify employees 
to share what they know and to assist employees in transitioning (within 
the new organization or to a new organization) will go a long way to 
ensure a smooth M&A transaction.
 
◾Chapter 9: “Is There a Doctor in the House?”: Knowledge Management in 
Healthcare
The healthcare industry has become individual centric. As the healthcare 
community moves to electronic record keeping and capturing patient 
information at the point of initial interaction, having accurate knowl-
edge about that patient as well as having the patient knowledgeable 
about his or her own health is essential to the success of caring for that 
patient. KM is an essential ingredient for healthcare success, especially 
in the areas of drug interaction analysis, sharing of patient diagnosis 
between hospitals and doctors, and furthering the development of 
healthcare informatics.
 
◾Chapter 10: “Show Me the Money!”: Knowledge Management in Financial 
Services
KM in the financial services sector centers on being able to attract, serve, and 
retain customers. Delivering the tools to customers that provide knowledge 
to make sound financial decisions is at the heart of what KM will provide. 
To bring innovative financial services and products to the marketplace and 
to have an understanding of their potential benefits to customers, impart-
ing training to customer service representatives on specific knowledge will 
also be a critical component of KM.
 ◾Chapter 11: “Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management in Insurance
In this chapter, you will learn how KM is used in the insurance industry 
to communicate knowledge to customers, agents, and customer contact 
centers while providing mechanisms for employees to share, capture, 
and catalog knowledge. KM in the insurance industry will provide the 
knowledge to (among other things) complete applications, bind insur-
ance, and service a claim.

xxiv ◾ Preface
 
◾Chapter 12: “Sign Right Here!”: Knowledge Management in the Legal 
Profession
In this chapter, use of KM to enhance the management of a law firm and to 
execute client engagements will be presented. KM in law firms is primar-
ily executed through the building and fostering communities of practice 
around practice specialties. This enables legal representatives to respond to 
a situation with the right expertise, equipped with the right knowledge to 
resolve a legal matter.
 
◾Chapter 13: “A Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Waste!”: Knowledge Management 
Education
This chapter examines the state of KM education. This examination includes 
KM certification programs, KM curriculum at institutions of higher 
learning, as well as KM education policies, procedures, and future direc-
tion of KM education. In addition, specific criteria to be considered while 
selecting a KM education option are presented.
 
◾Chapter 14: “Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management and Big Data
In this chapter, use of KM to gain knowledge from your Big Data resources 
will be examined. The use of KM on Big Data to provide a rich structure 
to enable decisions to be made on a multitude and a variety of data is the 
essence of this examination. Along with specific analysis of the various 
types of data and KM methods for examining this data, a detailed under-
standing of KM’s impact on Big Data can be realized.
 
◾Chapter 15: “What Have You Done for the War Fighter Today?”: Knowledge 
Management in the Military
KM in military has a rich history. Use of KM in the military, with special 
attention to events such as Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), will 
be examined. In addition, a look at the various branches of the military 
(army, air force, and navy) and their KM strategies, KM systems, and 
KM methods are presented.
 
◾Chapter 16: Drinking the Knowledge Management Kool-Aid: Knowledge 
Management Adoption
Adoption of KM programs, policies, methods, and systems is a challenge for all 
organizations. This chapter is all about adoption! If your organization does 
not adopt its KM principles, practices, processes, procedures, or systems, it 
may be recognized as a failure. Specific guidance on improving KM adop-
tion and positioning your KM initiatives for success is also presented.
 
◾Chapter 17: Failure Is Not an Option: Why Do Knowledge Management 
Programs and Projects Fail?
With lofty promises come unrealized results. KM gained widespread pop-
ularity in the 1990s; however, many KM initiatives failed and this 
popularity has tapered quite a bit. Since the mid-2000s, KM started to 
experience a renaissance; some disparate KM achievements were wit-
nessed (call centers, research, human resources, and military), and KM 

Preface ◾ xxv
is now considered as a discipline to gain a competitive advantage over 
competitors. Although KM is being used with some level of success in 
this new knowledge economy, many KM initiatives still fail. This chapter 
details the factors that contribute to the failure of KM initiatives as well 
as measures to adhere to in order to achieve successful KM.
An in-depth synopsis of each chapter and an overall introduction to the book are 
included in Chapter 1. The concluding chapter (Chapter 18) provides a summary 
of the book and an insight into what’s next for KM.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Have you ever wondered about all the fuss concerning knowledge management 
(KM)? What is KM anyway? At its core, KM is about sharing and collaborat-
ing what you know, capturing what you know, and reusing that knowledge so 
as to not reinvent the wheel and/or to combine with other ideas to foster innova-
tion. A KM meeting that I attended, conducted by the American Productivity and 
Quality Center (APQC) (APQC’s January 2011 KM Community Call), included 
representatives from Conoco Phillips, Fluor, IBM, GE, and Schlumberger; I 
returned from this meeting understanding that it is necessary to have KM part of 
an organization’s culture. I believe that this is important because we do not want 
KM to be “another task to complete on the checklist,” but the way we conduct busi-
ness. This includes the business between the various individuals and entities within 
our corporations as well as with our customers. Talking, listening, capturing, and 
applying what we learn from each other is a constant, never ending, and always 
evolving process.
Knowledge Management in Practice provides KM professionals and those 
undergoing training in KM a practical examination on how KM is being applied. 
Specifically, this book leverages the experience gained while practicing KM to solve 
some of the more pressing KM problems faced in organizations today. This book 
addresses challenges such as search engine optimization, content categorization and 
searching, building taxonomies and ontologies, capturing and managing tacit and 
explicit knowledge, KM adoption, and failure of KM projects. In addition, this 
book examines how KM is being applied to specific industries, including insur-
ance, healthcare, legal, human resources and talent management, military, research 
institutions, and finance.

2 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Overview
This book will provide detailed information on applying KM practices, proce-
dures, and techniques to solve real-world problems. The applications of KM that 
will be examined include social media; content management; search engine opti-
mization; capturing and codifying tacit and explicit  knowledge; KM in disaster 
preparedness, action, and reaction; KM adoption process in an organization; the 
reason for failure of KM projects, and specific industry KM applications. This 
book will contribute to the advancement in application of KM principles, prac-
tices, and procedures, as well as the systems that support KM.
Each chapter will include key learnings as well as tips and techniques for those 
who are currently instituting KM in projects and/or programs. The following sec-
tions contain a synopsis of each chapter in this book:
The Case for Implementing Knowledge 
Management (Chapter 2)
This chapter examines why your organization may need a KM program. What fac-
tors determine that it is time to consider implementing policies, procedures, prac-
tices, and processes that will not only be the catalyst for specific KM initiatives, but 
also the development of a KM program, including KM Center of Excellence? This 
chapter will answer this question as well as examine the need to collaborate and 
share knowledge; understand who the key knowledge holders are and what knowl-
edge they know; and the need to respond to internal employees and/or customers 
by identifying, capturing, storing, reusing, and learning from the myriad of explicit 
knowledge in your organization. All of this and more will be examined, because it 
contributes to your organization’s need for KM.
Implementation of KM must consider the necessary resources to address the 
problem(s) being identified that call for KM. In our case for KM, we must commu-
nicate a payoff (Rhem, 2005). Why should our organization invest in KM without 
knowing the payoff and when it will occur? Another aspect of our case for KM is 
actually selling KM as an organizational effort and benefit and not just limited to 
a department or business unit.
The case for KM represents a well-argued and logically structured document 
that puts forward the business rationale for investing in a KM initiative. The case 
for KM as with any business case must clearly establish the following:
 
◾The driving forces for the initiative
 
◾The costs and risks of doing nothing
 
◾A description of the proposed action(s)
 
◾Comparison of the proposed action to other alternatives

Introduction ◾ 3
 
◾Accommodation of the proposed actions with the current and future goals of 
the organization
 
◾The cost–benefit, risk, and financial assessments of the proposed action(s)
 
◾A tentative, high-level strategy and a project plan outlining the key initiatives
 
◾A statement on how the proposed action(s), if implemented, would improve 
the organization
This chapter will include a template for presenting your organization’s business case 
for KM as well as some proven tips and techniques to enable your business to be 
approved!
Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media 
(Chapter 3)
KM at its core is people centric. Social media is driven by people and the interac-
tions they have with each other. Many employees and customers of organizations 
are now engaged in social media. It is now engrained in our society, and new gen-
erations of current and future workers are shaping the way it is used and the impact 
it is been having. Through the implementation of KM, organizations are aligning 
social media principles, practices and tools to among other things expedite the 
sharing and the dissemination of knowledge and information real time. KM that 
utilizes social media will facilitate in building an environment that will facilitate 
how people interact outside the organization to within the organization. However, 
this must be accomplished by implementing much more stringent policies and 
guidelines concerning social media and related technologies. In this chapter, a look 
at constructing a social media strategy will bring to light how these capabilities 
must be managed by the organization.
Organizations have also committed resources to contribute to the social media 
voice. By employing social media specialist (among other titles), organizations 
tweet about their latest company products, news, specials, and so on, while also 
responding to others in the “twitter space.” You will often find organizations with 
a Facebook presence, knowing that a great percentage of their customers are also 
on Facebook. Organizations are benefiting from social media, knowing that the 
virtual world is filled with knowledge, and they monitor that knowledge within the 
various social channels.
Social tools and mediums such as blogs, wikis, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn 
represent the mechanisms to enable people to engage and share openly. These 
social tools put knowledge-sharing power in the hands of the users themselves, 
and this power has business and government taking notice. In this chapter, social 
media as it pertains to the key principles of KM will be examined. These key prin-
ciples include knowledge sharing, knowledge capture, and knowledge reuse. As it 
pertains to social media, Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn will be the mechanisms

that are included in this analysis. This chapter will also include input from my 
own experience, and the experiences that have been documented by others as con-
tributors to the analysis will be conveyed in this chapter. In addition, this chapter 
will include a template for developing your organization’s social media strategy as 
well as some proven tips and techniques to successfully execute this strategy.
Dude, “Where’s My Car?”: Utilizing Search in Knowledge 
Management (Chapter 4)
This chapter is all about search and “findability” of knowledge within the enterprise 
and/or customer-facing websites. In this chapter, concepts such as search engine 
optimization, ontology, taxonomy, information architecture, and information 
modeling are covered. To increase the chances, content and knowledge are prop-
erly located within the knowledge repository; having properly categorized content 
and knowledge is essential. Knowledge base concepts such as “tagging,” metadata, 
keywords, and synonyms will also be covered. When we understand these concepts 
along with our specific requirements, we will be better equipped to select the right 
tool to satisfy our searching needs.
When it comes to selecting a software tool to facilitate the management 
of our knowledge, whether it’s replacing a current tool or if it’s the first time 
implementing a KM tool, we must have a plan on how we are going to get the 
content on to the knowledge repository. Having a clear, concise, and workable 
plan for content migration is a critical ingredient in our ability to later find all 
content and especially those “knowledge nuggets” that will help us in perform-
ing our tasks. This chapter will cover the steps that should be considered when 
developing your content migration strategy. These steps and concepts include 
the following:
 
◾Content identification
 
◾Content analysis
 
◾Stakeholder/management engagement
 
◾Knowledge repository design
 
◾Taxonomy, content types, and metadata mapping
 
◾Training
 
◾Content migration
Finally, to conclude this chapter, a discussion on where search is heading toward 
and the tools enabling findability of knowledge will be examined. This chapter will 
include the examination of Web 2.x through Web 4.x paradigms. Search paradigms 
such as PIK-Map, Syntactic/Semantic Frames, intelligence/rules-based content 
retrieval, Natural Language parsers, and Spiders will all be included. A distention 

Introduction ◾ 5
between the search needs of the enterprise and the search needs of the customer 
facing websites will be examined. The discussion on software tools could not be 
complete without examining some of the most widely used tools and the criteria 
established to use when selecting an enterprise search solution.
The Age of Discovery: Knowledge Management 
in Research Institutions (Chapter 5)
Research institutions are critical to innovation and new product creation. The 
speed to market for new products are essential to stay ahead of your competitors. 
KM plays a central role in innovation through the use of collaboration and knowl-
edge sharing.
At its core, the nature of research is to nurture open access to extensive 
amounts of tacit knowledge (knowledge within the minds of people) and explicit 
knowledge (knowledge that is written down) by applying a model that reflects 
the natural of flow of knowledge. The model of Connect → Collect → Reuse and 
Learn depicts a knowledge flow model that supports KM within research institu-
tions and R&D functions within organizations. For KM to work within a research 
environment (as with other environments) a culture and structure that supports, 
rewards, and proves the value KM will encourage the continued use and adoption 
of the KM practice.
In addition, the choice of IT tools (which is of secondary importance) should 
be brought into the organization to automate the knowledge flow and its associ-
ated process. The KM tool(s) must support KM goals/strategies, and provide a 
means to connect, collect, catalog, access, and reuse tacit and explicit knowledge. 
In addition, the KM tool(s) must capture new learning to share across the orga-
nization and provide search and retrieval mechanisms to bring pertinent knowl-
edge to the user. Research institutions and departments utilizing KM effectively 
will have an advantage over their competitors who are not utilizing KM by get-
ting better products to market quicker, increasing the level of innovation at their 
organizations, and establishing an environment of empowerment for research 
professionals.
This chapter will cover the KM strategy (including a strategy template), tech-
niques, best practices, and application of KM necessary for research institutions 
to innovate more effectively and shorten the time to bring new products to mar-
ket. Topics such as knowledge sharing techniques (communities of practice [CoP], 
collaborative workspaces, and after action reviews); techniques for innovation 
(knowledge café, root cause analysis, and problem finding); tools to facilitate KM 
within the research organization; ways to quickly institute the KM procedures, 
practices, and principles into the organization; and the key benefits of KM will 
also be covered.

6 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
“Where Have All My Experts Gone?”: Knowledge 
Management in Human Resources and Talent 
Management (Chapter 6)
Talent management is often referred to as human capital management. Many 
organizations are faced with the problem of retaining talent as well as capturing 
the knowledge of the talent as it moves in and out of the organization. KM plays 
an important role in converting individual knowledge into corporate knowledge, 
thereby making it available to be cataloged and shared throughout the organization.
As part of a comprehensive KM strategy applied to human capital manage-
ment, it is vital to establish a program that is executed when your staff enters the 
organization and continues until the time that staff member leaves the organiza-
tion. How is this accomplished? Initially, through employee orientation; establish-
ing a mentor–protégé relationship; mapping their roles, responsibilities, and their 
work products to the specific duties that are being performed; and executing a 
comprehensive exit interview. All these are aspects of a KM strategy aimed at mov-
ing your human capital to corporate capital.
This strategy does not begin and end here! As staff members evolve in their 
roles, the sharing and cataloging of knowledge continues through the use of CoP, 
the creation of knowledge repositories, capturing lesson learned, and instituting 
a culture that values lifelong learning and sharing of knowledge. Getting started 
with a KM strategy entails a collective vision as to how sharing of knowledge can 
enhance organizational performance, and that the knowledge of the organization is 
a valuable commodity that must be collected, cataloged and reused.
In this chapter, the following concepts and topics will be examined:
 
◾Human capital management critical success factors
 
◾Human capital challenges facing organizations
 
◾Capturing employee tacit and explicit knowledge
 ◾Knowledge mapping for identifying key knowledge holders and what they know
 
◾High impact talent management framework
“Sound the Alarm!”: Knowledge Management in 
Emergency and Disaster Preparedness (Chapter 7)
First responders (i.e., police, fire, and emergency medical teams) many times are 
not able to respond quickly and effectively, causing the increase probability of 
seriously injured people not receiving care in a timely fashion. This has led to 
loss of life in situations where one’s life could have been saved. Nationally (as 
seen by the response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and 9/11 attacks), there is 
a problem in effectively and efficiently enabling first responders in their effort 
to prepare, respond, and provide recovery during an emergency and/or crisis 
situation.

Introduction ◾ 7
KM applied to the preparedness, response, and recovery mission of first respond-
ers will enable them to arrive at the scene in a timely manner, be equipped with the 
right knowledge of the situation, and have the right tools and technology to execute 
their job, resulting in saving lives. In many urban areas of the United States, when a 
first responder team is dispatched, they often do not arrive in a timely manner, are 
not fully aware of the situation, and are not fully equipped to handle the situation. 
Applying KM to disaster preparedness, response, and recovery will save lives not only 
in the communities’ first responder serve but also within the first responder teams 
themselves, resulting in a safer, fully knowledgeable team responding to a crises event.
This indicates a need to apply a comprehensive KM strategy that will incor-
porate the necessary KM policies, principles, practices, and technology to enable 
knowledge sharing, knowledge harvesting, and knowledge delivery, including 
alerts to the right people, at the right time, in the right manner.
In this chapter, a KM strategy focused on emergency preparedness and response by 
first responders will be examined as well as aspects of that plan will be presented. A details 
analysis of a comprehensive emergency alert system will be presented. This chapter will 
examine the following areas of a comprehensive emergency alert system: emergency alert 
interaction (two-way interaction), geographical information system-based real-time alert 
delivery, leveraging a cloud-based architecture, scalability, and interoperability.
Happily Ever After: Knowledge Management 
in Mergers and Acquisitions (Chapter 8)
Mergers and acquisitions are a way of life in corporate America and around the 
world. The results in most cases are mixed. The basic premise is that the acquiring 
company and/or the merging companies are looking for synergies, increase market 
share, and overall a stronger and a more viable entity.
Synergy allows for enhanced cost efficiencies of the new business entity. When 
companies decide to go through a merger/acquisition, the organizations involved 
anticipate benefiting from the following:
 
◾Staff reductions: More often than not, it means job losses. Cost savings are 
realized from reducing the number of staff members from departments across 
the organization(s).
 
◾Economies of scale: As we all know size matters, it is no surprise that a larger 
company placing the orders can save more on costs. Mergers often trans-
late into improved purchasing power to buy equipment or office supplies. 
When placing larger orders, larger companies (i.e., Wal-Mart, Microsoft, and 
Boeing) have a greater ability to negotiate prices with their suppliers.
 
◾Acquiring new technology: To stay competitive, companies need to stay on top 
of technological developments and their business applications. By buying a 
smaller company with unique technologies, a large company can maintain or 
develop a competitive edge.

8 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾Improved market reach and industry visibility: Companies buy companies to 
reach new markets and grow revenues and earnings. A merge may expand two 
companies’ marketing and distribution, giving them new sales opportunities. 
A merger can also improve a company’s standing in the investment commu-
nity: bigger firms often have an easier time raising capital than smaller ones.
More often than not, understanding the synergies or the lack thereof when it 
comes to personnel is absent. Understanding the personnel challenges of a merger/ 
acquisition will be the key to the success of the transaction and the ongoing opera-
tion of the new entity.
This understanding will be enhanced by applying the KM principles leveraged 
within human capital management (see Chapter 6). In this chapter, the specifics of 
mergers and acquisitions and the application of KM (more precisely human capital 
management) to improve the process and outcomes as it pertains to retaining staff, 
conducting staff reductions, identifying key knowledge holders, and understanding 
knowledge gaps are examined.
“Is There a Doctor in the House?”: Knowledge 
Management in Healthcare (Chapter 9)
With the advent of healthcare reform and the move to digitize health records, 
streamline medical costs, and to enable better medical decisions, many organiza-
tions in the healthcare industry are turning to KM. A prime method in utiliz-
ing KM in healthcare is through healthcare informatics. Healthcare informatics 
incorporates information technology and healthcare to support clinical workflow, 
 collect, organize, and secure health related data, information, and knowledge. 
It also supports the growing knowledge base of physicians in order for them to 
make better decisions, reduce the costs of treatments, eliminate (severely cut) mis-
takes, and improve overall patient care.
Healthcare informatics combines the fields of information technology and 
health to develop the systems required to administer the expansion of informa-
tion, advance clinical work flow, and improve the security of the healthcare  system. 
It  involves the integration of information science, computer technology, and 
 medicines to collect, organize, and secure information systems and health-related 
data. As a result, the extraordinary explosion of medical knowledge, technologies, 
and ground-breaking drugs may vastly improve healthcare delivery to consum-
ers, and keeping the information and knowledge related to these advancements 
 organized and accessible is the key.
Some of the keys to patient care are the ability to evaluate large amounts of 
data and information, which includes the use of medical informatics. These are 
the keys to deliver medical knowledge to the right people, at the right time, in the 
right context. Electronic health records, data warehouses, laptops, and other mobile 
devices now provide access to information at the point of care. This access facilitates 

Introduction ◾ 9
a continuous learning environment in which lessons learned can provide updates 
to clinical, administrative, and financial processes. Given these advancements, it is 
imperative that data, information, and knowledge are managed for effective health-
care. Applying principles of KM has become the catalyst for quality healthcare 
delivery and management.
This chapter provides a detailed understanding of the practice of KM within 
the healthcare industry. The content includes critical aspects of healthcare opera-
tions, knowledge strategies for healthcare operations, knowledge essential elements 
for healthcare, knowledge mapping and medical informatics, knowledge creation 
and discovery in medical informatics, applying KM to healthcare, and knowledge 
tools and techniques for healthcare.
“Show Me the Money!”: Knowledge Management 
for Financial Services (Chapter 10)
The financial services industry is a highly dynamic and competitive marketplace. 
As the fight for customers intensifies, it is increasingly important to attend to cus-
tomer needs while ensuring customer information is shared with the right people 
at the right time across the institution. To this end, the technology supporting the 
institution is vital to facilitating the movement of information and knowledge to 
the customer. KM systems will have an increased importance as trends in personal 
investing move toward broader services and integrated product offerings.
By utilizing a KM system, all employees interacting with a customer will have 
up-to-date knowledge of that customer’s breadth of relationship and experience 
with the institution. This helps the institution with cross selling, up selling, and 
reporting on the effectiveness of any new customer initiatives.
Today, organizations are integrating KM into their business philosophies, mak-
ing it more common practice and therefore less differentiating factor of success, 
thus creating the need for KM practice to become more and more superior. This is 
especially true in the light that more and more knowledge is becoming available, 
while at the same time also being becoming more sophisticated, making KM more 
complex. This results in the fact that businesses that manage knowledge better 
within their organization and outside of it addressing the evolving customer needs 
will improve their overall performance and become the leaders within the industry.
It is well recognized that the financial services business environment is ever 
changing and is doing so at an ever-increasing rate. The stock market (DOW, 
NASDAQ, and S&P) swings on the earnings of large corporations, the ever-evolving 
political climate, the volatility of European and Asian markets, and the price of oil, 
just to name a few. This presents financial organizations with the challenge of acting 
and reacting to this volatility and communicating an appropriate value proposition 
to the market. In addition, having an increasingly sophisticated consumer who is 
armed with the latest trading technology has added further stress to these companies 
to deliver the right knowledge, at the right time, in the right way to their customers.

10 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
This chapter focuses on the use of KM within the financial industry. Specific 
attention will be on how KM is being leveraged in the commodity (futures and 
options) and the stock market, including the mutual funds sector within the United 
States. Online trading financial companies, the electronic trading applications in 
the commodities and stock market, and the sophisticated trading tools leveraged by 
today’s financial consumer are the catalyst for the implementation of KM practices, 
policies, procedures, and applications, all aimed at creating a differential between 
companies that deliver financial services and the people who are working to build 
financial stability with them.
“Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management 
in Insurance (Chapter 11)
In the insurance industry, trade secrets, confidential information, and valuable 
ideas are part of the workforce knowledge. Recruiting, selecting, training, and 
managing contact center employees, agents, and other corporate and field office 
employees present a real challenge for insurance companies. In addition, govern-
ment and industry laws and regulations as well as ethics present their own unique 
challenges of understanding, application, and enforcement. These challenges are 
being addressed through the implementation and execution of KM policies, prac-
tices, procedures, and software applications.
In the insurance industry, there are an ample number of factors as stated above 
to be considered for KM to facilitate decisions within a problem situation. These 
factors include the sharing and transfer of experiences (tacit knowledge) as well as 
the sharing and transfer of practices, how-tos, and lessons learned (explicit knowl-
edge). This knowledge can be transferred through sharing, and in some instances, 
it can be codified (Rhem, 2005). It is very difficult to retain the intellectual capital 
when a person leaves an organization; moreover, it is difficult to value these intan-
gible assets and is essential to retain them inside the organization in order to take 
competitive advantage of these assets (Rhem, 2005).
Applying KM will facilitate the insurers’ ability to meet these challenges and 
achieve efficiencies by leveraging the combined knowledge of its workforce and 
effectively turning it into a competitive advantage. Insurance companies (as well 
as others) are focusing on providing for their customers and in doing so generating 
profitable growth. In the face of a demanding economic environment, tight mar-
gins, regulations, availability, and quality of people, as well as data, information, 
and knowledge, all insurance organizations are facing challenges on several fronts. 
These include talent management (see Chapter 6), organizational responsiveness to 
the customer, cost control, and compliance.
KM in the insurance industry centers on meeting the customer needs, bal-
ancing growth with profit, protecting financial strength, and creating high- 
performing teams. In this chapter, the focus will be on how insurance companies 
are leveraging KM to address the needs of the customer through examining

customer call centers, agents, decisions supporting underwriting and claims, and 
use of knowledge of the internal employees.
“Sign Right Here!”: Knowledge Management 
in the Legal Profession (Chapter 12)
KM in law firms has taken off in recent years. Here it’s not only a requirement to 
have KM experience, a KM certification (or formal degree), but most law firms are 
requiring that future employees also have a Juris Doctor (JD). The requirement for 
a JD may not be as stringent at corporations that are looking for KM resources 
within their legal departments; they usually look for candidates with KM and/or a 
library sciences background. All of this is fueled by the fact that KM enables legal 
organizations to respond quickly, efficiently, and effectively when it comes to servic-
ing its employees and at the end of the day, their clients as well.
KM in law firms is often executed through the following elements: building 
and fostering CoP around practice specialties and/or areas of responsibility; devel-
opment and use/reuse of knowledge assets; enabling collaboration beyond the CoP 
and into extended communities; capturing and validating knowledge produced as 
a result of collaboration; systematically hosting tacit knowledge; arranging and effi-
ciently presenting knowledge assets to users; and creating/nurturing a culture of 
knowledge sharing, collaboration, and lifelong learning.
According to Ted Tjaden,
In a law firm setting, explicit knowledge tends to be precedent agree-
ments, checklists, research memos, opinion letters, and “how to” 
guides. Equally—if not more important—is the tacit knowledge, being 
what lawyers know, their experience and their professional judgment. 
Capturing and organizing explicit legal knowledge can be relatively 
straightforward and involves a combination of technologies (internal 
document management systems, search and tagging technology, and 
intranets). Capturing and organizing tacit legal knowledge can be more 
challenging. In most firms, tacit knowledge is transferred through men-
toring, training and allowing a knowledge-sharing culture to flourish. 
(Tjaden, 2010; [my emphasis])
In this chapter, the focus will be on how law firms manage their vast array of 
explicit and tacit knowledge. In addition this chapter presents an  understanding 
of how explicit and tacit knowledge when used together can provide the law firm 
with a distinct advantage over its competition. This chapter will specifically exam-
ine how law firms are leveraging precedent development, legal research, competitive 
intelligence, training lawyers (talent management), intranet deployment, project 
management, and client support, all in relation to instituting KM within their legal 
institutions.

“A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste!”: Knowledge 
Management Education (Chapter 13)
The increased focus on the knowledge economy has heightened interest in KM as 
a profession, an occupation, and its essential competencies. Many believe that it is 
time to acknowledge KM as a professional area of practice and it is necessary to begin 
a formal discussion of the educational foundation needed to support this area of 
professional practice. Although there is a wealth of published and informal literature, 
thoughts derived from practice, and dialogs on these topics, a consensus on what 
constitutes the core elements of KM competencies and KM education is lacking.
A consensus is needed among those who are currently providing KM train-
ing, teaching KM via traditional course work, and supporting KM programs and 
departments within organizations. This consensus needs to be informed and sup-
ported by knowledge professionals who are currently working in knowledge roles 
today. In addition, as with all professional domains, the KM domain needs to 
be continuously reviewed and refreshed by professional educators and working 
professionals.
KM education must connect education and strategic learning competencies 
with skill and ability in knowledge strategy development, implementation, collabo-
ration, and leadership and management skills, in addition to technical competen-
cies. KM continues to be a growing discipline in which organizations are seeking 
qualified individuals. This is reflected in many institutions of higher education 
offering an MSc degree in KM. This degree offers students an opportunity to enter 
the knowledge economy and become an important asset to organizations working 
to get the right knowledge, to the right people, at the right time.
This chapter will focus on KM education delivery and options within universi-
ties and colleges as well as in KM certification organizations. This chapter will cover 
topics such as strategic roles and responsibilities of KM professionals in organiza-
tions today and the educational needs of these professionals, standard KM compe-
tencies, KM curriculum development and delivery, and teaching methodologies.
“Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management 
and Big Data (Chapter 14)
The proliferation of data, information, and knowledge has created a phenomenon 
called “Big Data.” KM when applied to Big Data will enable the type of analysis 
that will uncover the complete picture of the organization and be a catalyst for 
driving decisions. The connection between Big Data and KM brings together the 
entirety of your organization’s structured and unstructured data sources that are 
spread across a wide variety of repositories, databases, data warehouses, and content 
sources, in order for your organization to tap into its vast know-how to make better 
decisions on a multitude of issues and directions on an ongoing basis.

Introduction ◾ 13
Currently, the ability for an organization to tap into its Big Data sources to gain 
a competitive edge places a heavy reliance on analytics. Organizations are investi-
gating ways to efficiently and effectively collect and manage the data, information, 
and knowledge they are exposed to via various internal and external sources (which 
are typically networked together). KM will bring  opportunities—both technical 
and organizational—when working with Big Data. Organizationally, KM delivers 
strategy, governance, process-centric approaches, and inter- organizational aspects of 
decision support as well as technical considerations when incorporating new data 
sources and new frameworks for Big Data analytics, including KM.
This chapter takes a look into where KM and Big Data are heading toward 
within the organization. The advancement of search technologies (which play a key 
role in delivering knowledge within a KM system) impact our ability to access Big 
Data will be examined here. In addition to search technologies, several other KM 
technologies are addressing Big Data. These technologies include solutions that 
mine unstructured data and manage and use/reuse the knowledge found in Big 
Data. This chapter will examine knowledge classifications, social network analysis, 
Big Data sources, and information architecture, all aimed at providing details on 
how KM is and will work with Big Data.
“What Have You Done for the War Fighter Today?”: 
Knowledge Management in the Military (Chapter 15)
KM in the US military has been implemented using a top-down approach that is 
resonated through each branch, command, directorate, division, group, battalion, 
and so on. The US military has established a culture of KM that leverages its per-
sonnel, processes, and systems to facilitate a consistent flow of knowledge and the 
mechanisms to execute and make decisions from this knowledge.
It is widely acknowledged that KM strategy is a desired precursor to developing 
specific KM initiatives. The US military has established KM strategies from the top 
down in every branch. As this strategy is propagated and aligned through the orga-
nization, it is often a difficult process due to a variety of influences and constraints. 
These KM influences and constraints include understanding, conflicts with IT 
organizations, funding, technology usage and configuration, and outsourcing.
Any discussion of KM in the military should include a discussion of the Army 
Knowledge Management (AKM) principles, which were signed out by the army 
chief of staff (General Casey) and the secretary of the army in 2008. The AKM 
principles still are in effect and have served as a basis for KM efforts in the army 
and the federal KM arena at large.
Each US military branch works to overcome barriers in KM adoption. To this 
effort, an establishment of processes and tools, which involves providing approaches 
and solutions for knowledge sharing, has influenced a change in people’s habits. This 
change will drive values to move US military organization culture to father overall 

14 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
KM adoption. In support of the US military in its knowledge sharing efforts, CoP 
have become an integral method of sharing and distributing knowledge across all 
branches of the military. In addition, enterprise web search capabilities have been 
implemented to increase “findability” of key content, which is the leverage for deci-
sion making at all levels of command.
In my examination of KM in the military, I will take a holistic approach. This 
approach will not only begin with an examination of the AKM but also look at 
what each branch is doing from strategy through tactical implementation of KM 
programs, systems, and initiatives down to the command level. I will look at the 
synergies between the branches and identify tips, techniques, and best practices. 
In addition, I will leverage my own experiences as well as the experiences of others 
whom I have interviewed in the process of understanding the practice and execu-
tion of KM within the various military branches.
Drinking the Knowledge Management Kool-Aid: 
Knowledge Management Adoption (Chapter 16)
Many organizations have begun to understand the value and promise KM can 
bring to their workforce. Delivering innovation through collaboration and shar-
ing remain the cornerstones of KM. However, once your organization has estab-
lished its KM strategy and/or rolled out its initial KM offering (i.e., KM system, 
KM process, and tools) what happens next? What happens next is the adoption 
process. Whether it’s a new process, procedure, or system, getting your workforce 
to leverage and use it in the course of executing activities and delivering on their 
task will be essential to your KM program’s success. In order to achieve this, 
there must be processes and vehicles in place to allow, encourage, and reward 
staff members as they work within this new paradigm. It will not be easy. As with 
anything new, it will take some time for the adoption to occur. To move this 
along, there must be KM supporters, mentors, and/or evangelists at all levels of 
the corporate infrastructure to encourage the workforce to “drink the KM Kool-
Aid.” In other words, buy in and practice KM in all aspects of performing tasks 
and activities.
Developing an organizational culture of knowledge sharing, collaboration, 
and lifelong learning should be the goals of any KM program. Organizations such 
as the Fluor Corporation, Irving, Texas, have been successful in infusing KM 
within its culture. From human resource activities to leveraging knowledge for 
strategic purposes, to engaging with clients, Fluor sets an example of how KM 
can be leveraged effectively in an organization. Drinking the “KM Kool-Aid” 
is a slow and deliberate activity grounded in a basic KM process of Connect → 
Collect → Catalog → Reuse → Learn and Innovate. When practiced effectively, 
this process will be a cornerstone to enabling the adoption of KM throughout your 
organization.

Introduction ◾ 15
Failure Is Not an Option: Why Do Knowledge 
Management Programs and Projects Fail? (Chapter 17)
Although the lack of or absence of adoption will set your KM efforts on a path for 
failure, there are many other contributing factors that will also lead you down this 
road.
The fact is that few KM initiatives are successful. But, why is this the result? What 
is the cause and effect? Is it because there is a lack of qualified professional? Or is there 
more to it than these? What about a magic “silver bullet”? Is it a cultural issue?
I believe the reason why KM initiatives fail are varied and can be attributable 
to many factors. Moreover, I believe one of the main reasons why KM initiatives 
fail is based on how the organization views KM. KM is viewed just as a function 
of the call center. It is more than a function of a call center and its benefits are far-
reaching as any Lean process or any other initiatives that a corporation may put 
into practice. KM is mainly viewed by most corporations that have a KM effort as 
a cost of doing business. This is an error in philosophy. KM is a method of reducing 
expenses, improving productivity, and enhancing value.
KM will improve efficiencies that will increase a corporation’s profitability, and 
enhance the quality of work, performance, and overall value of the corporation. KM 
allows tacit knowledge to be leveraged, transferred to increase the quality of work 
performed across the corporation. This tacit knowledge allows KM to eliminate the 
“reinvent the wheel” syndrome. This transfer of knowledge is the essence of KM.
Outside of a corporation’s philosophy error, there are several reasons for the 
failure of KM initiatives. Some of those reasons are as follows:
 
◾Expecting KM technologies to replace KM processes or create processes 
where none exists
 
◾Lack of participation from all levels of a corporation
 
◾Forcing inadequate processes into new technology
 
◾Lack of maintenance and resources after initial standup
 
◾Lack of education and understanding of what KM means to the individual
 
◾KM does not become ingrained into the corporation’s work culture
 
◾Lack of involvement in creating and evolving KM content
 
◾Lack of metrics to measure the impact of KM on the corporation or insuf-
ficient/incorrect metrics being captured
 
◾Lack of monitoring and controls in place to ensure the knowledge is relevant, 
and is current and accurate
KM initiatives are essential to a corporation’s growth and are more than just the 
cost of doing business. Successful KM initiatives once completed and funded cor-
rectly will increase a corporation’s profitability, and enhance the quality of work 
and overall value of the corporation.

Summary (Chapter 18)
In this book, I have presented details about KM in various industries, where I have 
had the opportunity to help clients implement KM solutions as well as specific KM 
topics that are critical in today’s KM landscape. These solutions and topics ranged 
from KM strategies, knowledge transfer planning/execution, implementing KM 
systems, Big Data search, KM adoption, deploying methods to capture knowledge, 
and planning and executing on KM governance.
Each chapter includes key learnings as well as tips and techniques for those 
currently instituting KM in that particular industry and/or topic. Each chapter 
examines and analyzes the subject matter, and the keys for successfully applying the 
subject matter in “real-world” situation(s).
Knowledge Management in Practice is intended as a reference for KM practitio-
ners, organizations implementing KM, and those who are studying KM at the vari-
ous academic and KM certification institutions. This chapter presents a synopsis of 
what was presented in each chapter, the intended key takeaways, and a peek into 
the future of individuals and organizations practicing KM.
Outline of the Book
This book will give detailed information on applying KM practices, procedures, 
and techniques to solve real-world problems. The applications of KM that will 
be examined include social media; knowledge and content management; search 
engine optimization; capturing and codifying tacit and explicit knowledge; KM 
in disaster preparedness, action, and reaction; KM adoption process in an orga-
nization; failure of KM projects; and specific industry applications of knowledge 
management. This publication will contribute to the advancement in application of 
KM principles, practices, and procedures, as well as the systems that support KM.
Each chapter will include key learnings as well as tips and techniques for those 
who are currently instituting KM. The following section outlines the structure each 
chapter.
Structure of Each Chapter
Each chapter will examine and analyze the relevant subject matter, key learnings 
for successfully applying the subject matter, and tips and techniques for applying 
the subject matter in “real-world” situation(s).
Lessons learned from each chapter will refer to the knowledge gained through 
the experience of working within a specific domain(s), which can be negative or 
positive and can have a significant impact on the organization. Identifying and 
applying the lessons learned helps eliminate the occurrence of the similar problems 
in future and/or replicate successes that will establish best practices in future KM 
initiatives.

Chapter 2
The Case for Implementing 
Knowledge Management
If your organization is losing valuable knowledge due to staff retirement, staff 
 moving to other departments, or staff dismissed for a variety of reasons, then your 
organization has a strong case for the implementation of a knowledge management 
(KM) strategy. Specifically, if your organization is experiencing any of the follow-
ing scenarios then it has a strong case to implement a KM program or at the very 
least initiate a KM project to address these needs.
Scenario 1: Customer service representatives respond to customers and/or poten-
tial customer inquiries with inconsistent and oftentimes incorrect answers.
– For interacting with your customers, the information in your organiza-
tion can be transformed into useful and actionable knowledge to address 
customer inquiries and provide them with what they need to know at the 
right time and the right context.
– Customer-facing activities include
• Providing knowledge to customer support representatives in response 
to customer inquiries.
• Providing FAQs to customers related to the products, services, and 
other aspects about the organization via self-help options/functionality.
• Knowledge is also provided through help modules accessed by the 
customer usually through the organization’s website, and/or through 
web-based chat or click-to-call capabilities.

20 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Scenario 2: Your organization has a need to address employee/associate  knowledge 
needs:
– Knowledge provided here reflects the need for employees to access key 
knowledge holders in the organization to answer questions, collaborate 
on problems/issues, and/or provide content.
– The knowledge in this space often resides in the minds of individual 
workers (tacit knowledge). In addition, there exist a myriad of artifacts, 
which include but are not limited to, lesson learned, standard oper-
ating procedures, guidelines, templates, tips and techniques, spread-
sheets, presentation files, videos, and graphics (explicit knowledge) 
that must be captured to address the individual worker’s knowledge 
needs.
Scenario 3: Your organization has a need to address corporate operations  knowledge 
needs:
– The corporate operations/technical support activities of the firm provide 
technical solutions to inquiries not only to customers but also to inter-
nal knowledge workers (employees) as it pertains to any hardware and/or 
software being provided by the organization.
– The knowledge in this area is reflected by documenting software “bug” 
solutions, known errors, software patches, issue resolutions, and other 
specific data concerning the hardware and software configurations in the 
organization.
Scenario 4: Your organization has a need to bring new product innovations to 
the marketplace:
– The need for KM in this area addresses situations where duplication of 
effort occurs, not having the right team in place to perform the research to 
bring the product innovation to market successfully and in a timely man-
ner, always reinventing or starting from “square one,” difficulty locating 
current and/or historical corporate information/knowledge on a specific 
topic(s), and expertise leaving the organization creating a knowledge gap 
(see Chapter 5).
The business case for KM represents a well-argued and logically structured doc-
ument that puts forward the business rationale for investing in a KM initiative. 
The case for implementing KM as with any business case must clearly establish the 
following:
 
◾The problem or business opportunity addressed by the KM initiative
 
◾Applying/leveraging KM to address the problem
 
◾Detail the options available to implement the KM solution
 
◾Analyze the risk of doing nothing
 
◾Analyze the cost–benefit, risk, and financial assessments (return on invest-
ment [ROI]) of the proposed KM solution

The Case for Implementing Knowledge Management ◾ 21
KM Business Case Structure
In order to construct a KM business case, understanding its structure is the first 
step. The KM business case structure (see Appendix A) consists of the following:
Problem statement
 
The problem statement is the identification of the problem or business opportu-
nity being addressed by the KM initiative. A problem statement is clear, concise, 
and to the point and is often the compass to keep the team focused on delivering 
an outcome that solves the intended issue(s)/opportunity being addressed.
Understanding the five “Ws”
 
The five W’s consist of Who, What, Where, When, and Why. Remembering 
the five Ws will enable you to construct the problem statement in a way that 
will present pertinent details that are being addressed. The following details 
the five Ws.
 
Who: Who does the problem affect? This pertains to specific stakeholders 
(groups, departments, customers, etc.).
 
What: What are the boundaries of the problem, for example, organizational, 
work flow, geographic, customer, and segments—What is the issue?—What is 
the impact of the issue?—What impact is the issue causing?—What will happen 
when it is fixed?—What would happen if we didn’t solve the problem?
 
When: When does the issue occur?—When does it need to be resolved?
 
Where: Where is the issue occurring? Only in certain locations, processes, 
products, and so on.
 
Why: Why is it important that we fix the problem?—What impact does it 
have on the business, employees, or customers?—What impact does it have 
on all stakeholders, for example, employees, suppliers, customers, and share-
holders? Each of the answers will help to zero in on the specific issue(s) and 
properly articulate the problem statement. Remember that your problem 
statement should be solvable (a solution should be able to be deployed to 
resolve the issues presented by the problem statement) (Figure 2.1).
KM Solution Analysis
The KM solution analysis involves analyzing how KM will be leveraged to address 
the problem or business opportunity. 
Needs Analysis
In the needs analysis (also called “requirements definition”) phase, one begins doc-
umenting the business opportunity (or problem). Any issue can be looked upon 
as a problem or an opportunity. In writing business cases, I have found that you 
get a much warmer reception if you frame things in a positive light, that is, as 

22 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
opportunities, rather than as problems. In defining the opportunity, one needs to 
first be clear in identifying the objectives. Objectives are the measurable outcomes 
that one wants to achieve upon the completion of the proposed KM initiatives. 
Identifying the objectives and being clear on why they make business sense is very 
important. Objectives should be tied to outcomes from the strategic assessment 
phase, for example, the current and/or desired states of the business and the current 
business needs. Objectives are normally classified as first-order (critical), second-
order (important), and third-order (nice to have).
KM Solution Implementation Approach
The KM solution implementation approach explores the options that are available to 
implement the KM solution determined in the solution analysis. The implementation 
has two possible components: (1) A program level component providing the business 
case calls for implementing a KM program (2) and/or a KM initiative approach.
The KM program must optimize the organization, exchange, currency, and 
accessibility of knowledge, so that employees and other stakeholders spend less 
time looking for what they need in order to make critical decisions and complete 
specific tasks and activities. Effective workers do not just need to recognize their 
own knowledge and skills, but they must also recognize and strategically use 
those of others.
Program management is a method to manage related groups of KM initiatives.

The Case for Implementing Knowledge Management ◾ 23
Project Management Institute defines it as
A group of related KM initiatives managed in a coordinated way to 
obtain benefits and control not available from managing them indi-
vidually. Programs may include elements of related work outside scope 
of the discrete KM initiatives in the program. (PMBOK p. 368)
In summary, a program is a collection of initiatives and KM initiatives that are 
designed to accomplish a strategic business objective. As stated above in defining 
the problem statement, it is important to know the business drivers (five Ws) con-
cerned with the work being done. Because of the potential high cost and complex-
ity of some programs and/or KM initiatives, it is essential to sell the benefits and 
gain support for program and/or KM initiative. To explain the aspects of a program 
further, a program can include a single product or deliverable, many deliverables, 
can be a combination of ongoing support activity in addition to deliverables, and 
usually focuses on business objectives and delivering value. Some characteristics 
of programs include deliverables with a strategic intent; may initiate a business 
change; can be a significant change to the organization; success criteria may include 
growth, productivity gains, and improvement in the market; there could be signifi-
cant risks; are longer in duration than KM initiatives; and benefits are achieved 
throughout the duration of program. KM program initiatives include KM strat-
egy, KM governance, KM taxonomy and information architecture development, 
change management, and KM communications planning and execution.
Software Methodologies
When implementing a KM solution that is driven out by a specific KM initiative 
within the overall program (or as part of a standalone initiative), a standard soft-
ware methodology (Iterative, Agile/Scrum, OpenUP, or Knowledge Acquisition 
Unified Framework [KAUF]) (Rhem, 2011) should be utilized. The following sec-
tions briefly describe these methodologies.
Iterative Software Development Methodology
The Iterative software development methodology moves forward in increments called 
“iterations.” The goal of each iteration is to develop a portion of working software that 
can be demonstrated to all the stakeholders, and that the stakeholders will find mean-
ingful. The software developed by iteration should cut through all or most of the 
major subsystems of the KM initiative. It should not be concentrated to a single sub-
system. Each iteration represents an effort made by each member of the team to build 
a small part on their behalf of the KM initiative and integrate those parts together 
(see Figure 2.2). The length of iteration depends upon the kind of KM initiative we 

24 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
are working with. However, short iterations are to be desired over long ones. The 
shorter the iteration, the less time passes before the team gets feedback. Iteration 
lengths of 1 or 2 weeks are not too short for most KM initiatives (Wiley, 2012).
Agile/Scrum
Agile/Scrum KM initiative management is an agile software development process. 
Scrum models allow KM initiatives to progress via a series of iterations called “agile 
sprints” (see Figure 2.3). Each sprint is typically 2–4 weeks, and sprint planning in 
the agile methodology and Scrum process are essential. Although the agile/Scrum 
methodology can be used for managing any KM initiative, the agile/Scrum pro-
cess is ideally suited for KM initiatives with rapidly changing or highly emergent 
requirements such as software (Cohn, 2013).
The agile sprint itself is the main activity of Scrum KM initiative management. 
The agile methodology and Scrum process is iterative and incremental, so the KM ini-
tiative is split into a series of consecutive sprints. Each is timeboxed, usually to between 
1 week and a calendar month. One survey found that the most common sprint length 
of a Scrum agile process is 2 weeks. During this time, the Scrum team does everything 
to take a small set of features from idea to coded and tested functionality (Cohn, 2013).
OpenUP Methodology
OpenUP is a lean Unified Process that applies iterative and incremental approaches 
within a structured life cycle (see Figure 2.4). OpenUP embraces a pragmatic, agile

philosophy that focuses on the collaborative nature of software development. It is 
a tools-agnostic, low-ceremony process that can be extended to address a broad 
variety of KM initiative types.
OpenUP is based on four mutually supporting core principles:
 
1. Balance competing priorities to maximize stakeholder value
 
Promote practices that allow KM initiative participants and stakeholders to 
develop a solution that maximizes stakeholder benefits and is compliant with 
constraints placed on the KM initiative.
 
2. Collaborate to align interests and share understanding
 
Promote practices that foster a healthy team environment, enable collabora-
tion, and develop a shared understanding of the KM initiative.
 
3. Focus on the architecture early to minimize risks and organize development
 
Promote practices that allow the team to focus on architecture to minimize 
risks and organize development.
 
4. Evolve to continuously obtain feedback and improve
 
Promote practices that allow the team to get early and continuous feedback 
from stakeholders, and demonstrate incremental value to them.
Knowledge Acquisition Unified Framework
When the KM initiative calls for capturing tacit and explicit knowledge of the 
 organization, the KAUF provides a repeatable process for identifying understand-
ing and cataloging knowledge. The following briefly describes the seven steps that 
outline this framework.
Step 1—Define domain knowledge:
 
The first step in the KAUF is to identify what domain (business unit/division/
department, etc.) will be the focus of your knowledge elicitation and what 
knowledge is pertinent to be captured in this domain. In order to determine 
the knowledge to be captured, key knowledge holders and subject matter 
experts (SMEs) in the specified domain must be identified. This is typically 
done through a knowledge mapping exercise. Once this occurs, the KM ana-
lyst must ascertain what knowledge is essential to be captured. This can be 
accomplished through a series of interviews/surveys and analysis working 
closely with the key knowledge holders and SMEs.
Step 2—Decompose the domain knowledge:
 
When attempting to solve any large-scale problem, we would typically break 
the activity into a number of smaller tasks; to help a domain experts (SMEs, 
content managers, contributors, etc.) populate the knowledge repository, we 
should similarly break the activity of knowledge acquisition into a number 
of smaller tasks. Structuring the task of populating the knowledge repository 
into a number of distinct sub-steps (typically based on the taxonomy/ ontology 

The Case for Implementing Knowledge Management ◾ 27
that has been established) will ease the process of populating the knowledge 
 repository gradually.
Step 3—Determine interdependency:
 
Interdependency is when two or more pieces of knowledge/information depend 
on one another equally (one component depends on another). Finding the 
interdependency’s between different pieces of knowledge (documents/artifacts, 
and/or expertise) will guide the knowledge analyst and domain expert(s) in 
completing the knowledge acquisition task. Determining the interdependence 
between aspects of knowledge/information will facilitate in identifying the 
missing pieces of knowledge, determining related pieces of knowledge, and 
determining any inconsistencies with the knowledge gathered for that domain.
Step 4—Recognize knowledge patterns:
 
When analyzing knowledge/information, the process of connect, collect, 
catalog, and reuse will uncover patterns of knowledge, and recognizing these 
patterns will contribute to increase efficiencies in the knowledge/information 
being captured.
Step 5—Determine judgments in knowledge:
 
If the knowledge being captured is determined to be judgmental (i.e., 
 uncertain or “fuzzy”), then it must be analyzed to understand if conflicts 
exist. In addition, consulting with expert resources to come to a consensus as 
to what represents the “correct” knowledge may also be necessary.
Step 6—Perform conflict resolution:
 
There are situations in which sufficient expertise and/or documents are unavail-
able to solve conflicts within the knowledge being gathered. If the knowledge 
being captured has some uncertainty or is fuzzy, you must first specify 
preconditions in the context of one or more of the conflicting elements of the 
knowledge to prevent those conflicting elements from being considered.
Step 7—Capture/catalog the knowledge:
 
Tacit knowledge is now sufficiently ready to be cataloged and transformed 
into explicit knowledge to be prepared for inclusion into a KM solution 
(Figure 2.5).
Risk Assessment
The risk assessment analyzes the risk involved in implementing the agreed upon 
KM solution as well as the risk of doing nothing.
Value Analysis
The value analysis examines closely the value gained by the organization when 
implementing the KM solution. An analysis on the achievable ROI, including a 
timeline for when that would be realized, is also presented.

28 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
ROI for KM
From the outset, one must realize that making the case for a KM effort and 
 calculating an ROI is not easy when compared to making the business case for a new 
piece of equipment, such as new computer color photocopier or office furniture, 
in a more traditional situation. Investing in a piece of equipment can be directly 
tied to increases in product quality and/or quantity through multiple metrics (e.g., 
lower defect rates and finished products per hour). However, calculating the ROI 
for investments in KM efforts is not that simple or direct.
It is my experience that ROI for KM is measured by how well it supports the 
mission and/or objectives of the organization. Taking this into account, at the end 
of the day, what matters is whether the KM initiative increased the performance of 
its users or how well did it support the strategic mission of the organization.
When we are looking at achieving a return on our KM initiatives historically, 
it can take a considerable amount of time to show results or visible ROI for an 
organization. However, there is an approach by Mark Clare to estimate the value of 
the intangible benefits of KM (Clare, 2002). This approach, the knowledge value 
equation (KVE), simply states that the value created from managing knowledge is a

function of the costs, benefits, and risks of the KM initiative. It can be mathemati-
cally stated as follows: KM value = F (cost, benefit, and risk), which equals total 
discounted cash flow created over the life of the KM investment (Clare, 2002). This 
formula attempts to quantify the intangible impacts of KM relating it back to cash 
flow. This includes improved problem solving, enhanced creativity, and improved 
relationships with customers and other performance-related activities.
The following are the three common indicators of the viability of the KM initia-
tive: net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and the payback period. 
NPV helps us normalize future cash flows (both the cash we intend to spend and the 
cash we expect to receive) into their present value. As a general rule, if the NPV of a 
KM initiative is greater than zero, then you invest in the KM initiative. If the NPV 
is negative, you should not invest in the KM initiative. The reason for this is simple, 
the future cash flows, do not justify the present investment. The IRR is the discount 
rate (also called “investment yield rate”) for the KM initiative. It is the rate at which 
the NPV for a KM initiative is equal to zero. When comparing two KM initiatives, 
the one with the higher IRR is preferred. Another option to the IRR is to present the 
ROI. This value represents, as the name implies, the savings (benefit) one will derive 
out of the KM initiative for the investment (cost) outlays.
The payback period helps one estimate how quickly the investment will be 
recouped. Put in another way, it is the time required for the savings to equal the cost. 
When comparing two nearly similar alternatives, a rational person will choose the KM 
initiative with the shorter payback period. The important thing to bear in mind is that 
no single financial metric will be adequate for evaluating a KM initiative’s feasibility or 
its value proposition in comparison to other uses of the funds. Metrics are best used in 
conjunction with each other, as each one provides a slightly different value perspective.
Unlike traditional (e.g., manufacturing) KM initiatives, financial analysis for a 
KM initiative has two more complications. First, much of the benefits derived from 
a KM initiative will be based on soft facts; that is, KM lead to changes in behav-
iors, approaches, and methods that, on their own, may not have direct bottom-line 
impacts. However, when these are mapped and traced to organizational processes, 
the impacts can be measured and articulated. Needless to say, this is often a more 
time-consuming and creative effort than simply measuring direct impacts, as in the 
case of outcomes from a new piece of manufacturing equipment. Equally impor-
tant is that there is a lag time between when one invests in a KM effort and when 
one witnesses outcomes that result in payoffs. Accounting for this lag time is not 
easy, yet it is essential to building an adequate business case.
Investing in KM is akin to a group as a whole investing in a common effort. 
Consider the case of investing in initiatives such as the prevention of global warming 
by reducing greenhouse gas emissions or the promotion of fair trade practices. Most 
people agree that preventing global warming or increasing the adoption of fair trade 
practices benefits society. The challenge arises when we ask who wants to take respon-
sibility for investing in these efforts. If taxes were raised to support these efforts, 
would you be happy? Rational individuals often want others to bear the cost of these 

30 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
common efforts and gladly enjoy the benefits, yet hesitate to initiate responsibility. 
A similar predicament faces KM efforts. Departments within an organization want 
their peers’ units to invest in a common effort. Each department might see KM as 
an effort someone else should put up resources for and hence defers spending its own 
resources. In some organizations, KM efforts might be viewed as a “tax” levied.
KM Metrics and Key Performance Indicators
KM strategy will link the best practices to initiatives to expected benefits (Best 
 practice → KM initiative → Benefit). At every phase in KM tactical delivery of ini-
tiatives, metrics should provide a valuable means for focusing attention on desired 
behaviors and results. Each KM initiative and KM activity should have its own set 
of metrics.
KM performance measures have several objectives:
– Help make a business case for implementation or sustainment and expansion
– Provide targets or goals to drive desired behavior
– Guide and tune the implementation process by providing feedback
– Retrospectively measure the value of the initial investment decision and 
the lessons learned
– Develop benchmarks for future comparisons and for others to use
– Aid learning from the effort and developing lessons learned
Key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to track for the KM strategy 
include the following:
Customer satisfaction: Customer satisfaction can be improved, specifically in 
contact centers and agencies, where there is constant interaction with the 
customer. Customer satisfaction is best measured using standard market 
research techniques:
• Surveys
• Follow-up telephone calls
• Focus groups
Search engine usage: Search engine logs can be analyzed to produce a range of 
simple reports, showing usage and a breakdown of search terms.
Knowledge use: A more direct measure of many KM initiatives is whether the 
information is being “used in practice.” As usage normally happens outside 
of the system, it must be reported by the staff. Provide simple mechanism for 
notifying when information is used, and implement a rewards mechanism to 
encourage timely reporting.
Number of users: Directly related to system usage is the total number of staff 
accessing the system. This should clearly grow as the system is rolled out across 
the organization. This can be tracked via security login in order to determine 
accurate staff numbers.

The Case for Implementing Knowledge Management ◾ 31
User rankings: This involves asking the readers themselves to rate the relevance 
and quality of the information being presented. SMEs or other review-
ers can directly assess the quality of material in the content management 
system or KM platform.
Edits required: This can be done by utilizing workflow capability. Audit trails 
generated by this can be analyzed to determine how many edits or reviews 
are required for each piece of content. If the original material is of a high 
quality, it should require little editing.
Links created: A Popular page with useful information will be more frequently 
linked to from other parts of the system. By measuring the number of 
links, the  effectiveness of individual pages can be determined.
Information Currency
This is a measure of how up to date the information stored within the system 
is. The importance of this measure will depend on the nature of the information 
being published, and how it is used. The best way to track this is using the meta-
data stored within the content management system, such as publishing and review 
dates. By using this, automated reports showing a number of specific measures can 
be generated:
 
◾Average age of pages
 
◾Number of pages older than a specific age
 
◾Number of pages past their review date
 
◾Lists of pages due to be reviewed
 
◾Pages to be reviewed, broken down by content owner or business group
The KM system will allow variable review periods (or dates) to be specified, depend-
ing on the nature of the content. This metric is a tool for ongoing knowledge article 
(KA) and FAQ management.
User Feedback
A feedback mechanism will be established for the KM system. Use of such a feed-
back system is a clear indication that staff is using the knowledge in the knowledge 
base. Although few feedback messages may indicate the published KA/FAQ to be 
entirely accurate, it is more likely that the system is not being accessed, or that the 
feedback mechanism is not recognized as useful. Alternatively, although many feed-
back messages may indicate poor-quality information, it does indicate strong staff 
use. It also shows they have sufficient trust in the system to commit the time needed 
to send in feedback.

32 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Distributed Authoring
The extent to which the business as a whole takes responsibility for keeping content 
up to date is a metric in itself. At the most basic level, the number of KM system 
authors can be tracked against a target. A more rigorous approach uses statistics 
from the workflow capabilities to determine the level of activity of each author.
Transaction Costs
A process analysis activity can also determine costs involved in completing tasks. 
This allows direct cost savings made by implementing and leveraging the KM sys-
tem. Multiplied out by the number of times the activity is completed in a year, the 
whole-of-business savings can be determined. This could be substantial in a large 
organization such as state farm.
Strategic Look at the KM Business Case
A KM strategy entails a collective visioning as to how sharing knowledge can 
enhance organizational performance, and the reaching of a consensus among the 
senior management of the organization that the course of action involved in shar-
ing knowledge will in fact be pursued. It is implied in such a process a set of deci-
sions about the particular variety of KM activities that the organization intends 
to pursue, including the leverage of the organization’s knowledge assets (human 
capital being the number one asset), and the execution of the process and tools that 
will enable sharing of knowledge and innovation to occur.
When developing a KM business case, it is important to identify, in terms of the 
strategic assessment, the critical initiatives that the organization is currently engaged in, 
and/or those it is planning to embark on. These initiatives need to be thoroughly exam-
ined from a KM perspective. What will be the role of KM in these efforts? KM efforts 
should support and facilitate ongoing strategic initiatives, and it is very important that 
a proposed KM effort be tied to these initiatives in as direct a manner as possible.
A KM effort that is disconnected from the strategic initiatives of the orga-
nization has limited, if any, chance of being well received by the organization. 
Normally, any strategic initiative will have a number of tactical and operational 
objectives. These are good elements into which the KM efforts should be tied.
As with any KM initiative, it is important to find an executive sponsor for the 
KM effort. It is vital to communicate the value proposition of the KM effort to the 
strategic initiative. You should present KM not for the sake of doing KM, but as 
a means to further the strategic objectives in which the executives are interested.
Examine your organization carefully and determine if any of the above scenarios 
is something you are dealing with. Take necessary steps to keep your organization 

The Case for Implementing Knowledge Management ◾ 33
viable by initially crafting a business case to present to the senior management, and 
once it is approved, develop a KM strategy that will define the roadmap for execut-
ing the various aspects of the KM business case.
The KM effort needs to be communicated from its strategic value proposition 
rather than its technical intricacies. Getting executives to believe and visualize the 
overall value of the KM perspective and expertise is the critical outcome of getting 
approval of the KM business case and to start your KM initiative.
Key Learnings
The following are some key lessons learned from this chapter:
 
◾For any KM business case to be approved and successfully implemented, 
there must be strong executive sponsorship and leadership.
 
◾KPIs and metrics to track the KM strategy must be measurable.
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques deduced after reading this chapter:
 
◾To provide a roadmap and to communicate the direction, vision, and mission 
of KM in your organization when completing a KM strategy as part of any 
KM program is necessary.
 
◾When developing the KM business case, minimize the number of options 
available by conducting a detailed feasibility study beforehand.
 
◾When the KM initiative calls for capturing tacit and explicit knowledge of 
the organization, follow the KAUF.

Chapter 3
Being Social: Knowledge 
Management and 
Social Media
Social media brings the power of sharing and collaboration to the masses. Whether 
it’s Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube and leveraging any of the myriad of mobile 
devices, knowledge sharing and collaboration have become a way of life. At the 
core of knowledge management (KM) is knowledge sharing and collaboration, and 
social media tools have business and government taking notice.
Social media offers organizations the opportunity of connecting with potential 
customers at virtually no cost. It is possible to set goals and get return on invest-
ments (ROI); however, you have to know where you’re going and what you want 
to achieve. Once you have this information, you can allocate your resources wisely. 
Typically, a social media strategy will enable the organization to know where to 
start and what social sites to concentrate. When you know the lay of the land, it’s 
much easier to plot a path to your destination. A social media strategy will be your 
organization’s roadmap to plot this destination.
To reach your public successfully, you need to start telling your stories directly, 
and do it in a way that sparks conversations, interest, and action. The value proposi-
tion of social media is sustained conversations that shape perceptions and attract 
customers to purchase your products and services, and participate in the activities 
(blog, Twitter, forums, surveys, etc.).
The use of social media does not represent a onetime application, but a holistic 
environment to promote programs, events, communicate ideas, solicit thought, and 
to connect the institution to its customers (and potential customers) within the 

36 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
community. These customers represent our constituents and partners to engage 
in communication and feedback. Including a participatory communication cycle 
(see Figure 3.1) in your overall social media strategy will give you a clear direction 
and knowledge of your communication capacity, communication activities, which 
will be of most benefit, as well as the communities, which should be monitored and 
evaluated.
Participatory Communication Cycle
The participatory communication cycle is leveraged to enhance the capacity of 
individuals and communities to sustain communication activities (Corbett 2010). 
The participatory communication cycle consists of assessing your communication 
capacity, developing a communication plan, implementing communication activi-
ties, and monitoring and evaluating the results.
Assessment of communication capacity as it pertains to implementing social 
media is to understand the potential constraints of the proposed medium being 
utilized (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.), and to ascertain the staff needed to 
produce, send, and respond to communication within the perspective channel(s). 
This assessment should include an analysis of your organization’s legal and political 
constraints to social media, conventional sources, and types of messages, as well as 
communication style and scope (Corbett 2010).
The development of the communication plan can occur once the assessment 
is completed. This includes developing an overall strategy that provides a set of

objectives and an action plan to execute these objectives (Corbett 2010). This 
communication plan will include the following components: key communication 
objectives, key stakeholders and audience, messages to be crafted, identification of 
activities and determination of timelines, identification of roles and responsibilities 
for the planning and execution, budget, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to 
monitor and evaluate the results (Corbett 2010).
Once the communication strategy and action plan have been identified, 
implementation of communication activities can begin. When the  communication 
activities are clearly conveyed, associated resources and funding are put in 
place and the objectives of the strategy and its associated action plan are carried 
out, Corbett (2010).
As the participatory communication cycle moves into the monitor and evaluation 
(M&E) stage, it is at this point when your organization can begin to analyze and 
assess the impact of its communication cycle, as it pertains to the use of social 
media. However, this is a continuing cycle and as the organization moves back into 
assessing communication capacity, M&E should not only occur toward the end of 
the project but also at the beginning, and should be directly linked to each of the 
communication activities identified in the action plan (Corbett 2010).
KM and the Participatory Communication Cycle
KM within the participatory communication cycle occurs as the organization assesses 
and learns from the impacts of communication within the various social media  outlets 
as dictated by the action plan. Through interaction with customers, suppliers, and part-
ners your organization will gain valuable knowledge regarding issues, opinions, and 
 perception of your product and services as well as the company as a whole. In respond-
ing to the various comments within social media concerning your  organization, with 
an attempt to answer/respond in the correct way, company  representatives must have 
access to the right knowledge. This knowledge will facilitate representatives respond 
in a consistent manner and take control of your company’s voice within social media.
Social Media, KM, and the Enterprise
Social media takes knowledge and makes it highly iterative. It creates content as 
a social object. That is, content is no longer a point in time, but something that is 
part of a social interaction, such as a discussion. It easily disassembles the pillars of 
structure as it evolves. For example, content in a microblogging service can shift 
meaning as a discussion unfolds; conversations in enterprise social networks that 
link people and customer data can defy categorization; and internal blogs and their 
comments don’t lend themselves to obvious taxonomy.
Social media in the enterprise has gotten the attention of KM scholars and 
practitioners. It should mean that many of the benefits we experience in the 
consumer web space, which include effective searching, grouping of associated 

38 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
unstructured data sources, and ranking of relevance, will become basic features of 
enterprise solutions. In the enterprise, for example, when looking to staff a project 
with a certain skill set, the social capabilities that will be leveraged would include 
role, primary skill sets, secondary skill sets, number of years of experience, and rating 
on efficiency of each skill. Social media’s impact on KM will bring about more time 
by analyzing the knowledge that is being created through social interactions.
The objective of social media in a company is always to streamline the processes 
and leverage technology as an enabler. April Allen states in her blog (November 
28, 2012) that “Rather than killing off KM, I think social media has brought it 
to life. It’s less about dusty tomes on bookshelves not being updated and more 
about  connecting the dots in real time. It’s nimble and adaptable” (Allen, 2012). 
Christopher Palmert presents a perspective from the systems/tool side of social 
media and KM. Palmert states
It is not a problem to find social media applications that can be used 
for knowledge management. The basic version of applications like 
“Yammer” are even available for free. However, the axe cannot replace 
the carpenter, if one does not know how to use it. In addition to 
technical know-how, a strategy is required for successful knowledge 
management. The technology plays only a secondary role and there 
are enough systems. The success or failure depends on the organi-
zational structure, which is challenged by implementing the social 
media tools. (Palmert, 2012, p. 1)
As the evolution of social media and KM expands to a global perspective within 
the enterprise, it presents challenges that are currently not fully understood. Global 
social KM as depicted in Figure 3.2 describes the cross-cultural knowledge exchange 
and collaboration that exist among individuals and organizations (Pirkkalainen and 
Pawlowski, 2013). Pirkkalainen and Pawlowski (2013) state that the KM compo-
nent identifies a more specific view on the organizational and individual challenges 
coming from a collaborative distributed setting, which include where knowledge is 
being created, shared, and adopted by organizations and individuals.
As social software is being deployed for KM and collaboration, adoption toward 
this functionality in the enterprise has been limited. Furthermore, it has been indi-
cated that it is not yet clear that social software tools will be able to globally support 
distributed KM. Figure 3.2 depicts the key components of global KM and social 
software that must be considered for adoption (Pirkkalainen and Pawlowski, 2013).
Social Media Policies, Procedures, and Guidelines
Social media policies, procedures, and guidelines ensure a consistent and uniform 
way in which we can leverage social media platforms. Expanding social media 
beyond the corporate walls and including sites such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and 

Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media ◾ 39
Facebook to be accessed, monitored, and leveraged will play a key role in executing 
your social media strategy.
LinkedIn
LinkedIn is the premier business-oriented social networking site. The LinkedIn 
Group is the organization’s environment where we can collaborate to exchange 
ideas and points of interest with our current students, faculty, alumni, employees, 
and other interested parties. LinkedIn has more than 75 million registered users 
in 200 countries and territories worldwide and provides an excellent platform to 
educate the business community about the value that the institution brings to the 
communities it serves. The following are the guidelines for posting and interacting

40 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
1. Group members are personally responsible for the content they publish in the 
LinkedIn Group.
 
2. Be mindful that whatever you publish will be public for a long time—protect 
your privacy and take care to understand the terms of service of a site.
 
3. Identify yourself—your name and, when relevant, role at your  organization—
when you discuss your organization-related matters, such as products or services.
 
4. You must make it clear that you are speaking for yourself and not on behalf 
of your organization.
 
5. If you publish content online relevant to your organization in your personal 
capacity, use a disclaimer such as this: “The postings on this site are my own and 
don’t necessarily represent the organization’s positions, strategies or opinions.”
 
6. Respect copyright, fair use, and financial disclosure laws. Don’t provide your 
organization’s or another’s confidential or other proprietary information and 
never discuss business or other sensitive matters publicly.
 
7. Don’t cite or reference clients, partners, or suppliers without their approval.
 
8. When you do make a reference, link back to the source.
 
9. Don’t publish anything that might allow inferences to be drawn, which could 
embarrass or damage you or anyone.
 10. Respect your audience. Don’t use ethnic slurs, personal insults, obscenity, or 
engage in any conduct that would not be acceptable in any situation.
 11. You should also show proper consideration for others’ privacy and for topics 
that may be considered objectionable or inflammatory—such as politics and 
religion.
 12. Be aware of your association with online social networks. If you identify 
yourself as a student, employee, or alumni, then ensure that your profile 
and related content is consistent with how you wish to present yourself with 
colleagues.
 13. Don’t pick fights, be the first to correct your own mistakes.
 14. Try to add value. Provide worthwhile information and perspective. Your 
organization’s brand is best represented by its people and what you publish 
may reflect on your organization’s brand.
 15. Don’t use logos or trademarks unless you are approved to do so.
Twitter
Twitter is the premier microblogging service enabling its users to send and 
read other users’ messages called “tweets.” Tweets are text-based posts of up to 
140 characters displayed on the user’s profile page. Tweets are publicly visible by 
default; however, senders can restrict message delivery to their friends’ list. Users 
may subscribe to other author tweets, this is known as “following,” and such 
 subscribers are known as “followers.” As of late 2009, users can follow lists of 
authors instead of just following individual authors. Twitter has gained popularity 
worldwide and currently has more than 100 million users.

Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media ◾ 41
Twitter has the ability to call into action a massive amount of people in a limited 
amount of time for any cause or purpose. It can also be harmful by propagating 
negative and erroneous information that is difficult to recover from. Information 
dissemination on this platform must be used wisely. This power to share must be 
handled with a sense of privilege and responsibility. From a negative perspective, we 
have seen more and more often that our tweets have caused loss of jobs, lawsuits, 
and some cases public outrage. However, the positive aspects such as increased 
awareness, promoting ideas, launching careers, entertaining, and bringing people 
together for a cause have outweighed the negative impacts of Twitter, and it has 
become a major part of many organizations social media strategy.
Twitter is and always shall be a means to listen to your customers, clients, col-
leagues, industry leaders, and anyone else who might comment on your product 
or business. It is about networking and knowledge sharing. The uses for Twitter 
are limitless. You just have to find your niche. You have to ask, “What are the 
benefits of being on Twitter?” Some will share knowledge, whereas others will just 
use Twitter as a way of being available to customers. Either way, as long as you are 
actually listening and staying engaged, you will benefit.
One of the best things Twitter can do for a company is simply to humanize it. 
Allowing a real person to put a voice to an otherwise impersonal entity can give a 
new dimension to your organization’s relationships with clients, which is otherwise 
not possible. Some of the more successful brands on Twitter allow and encourage 
a multitude of voices from within the corporate walls to twitter, not only engaging 
clients but also each other.
Before you actively try to build an audience, post a few tweets to familiarize 
yourself with the process, and spend some time reading what others in your industry 
are talking about on Twitter. Use the “Find People” search function at the top of 
your Twitter page to look for people you know will want to follow you back: people 
within your company, current clients, and colleagues. Send a few @ replies out to 
people who are following you. Respond to things they are talking about. When 
they in turn respond to you with and @ reply, the people following them will take 
notice of you and may choose to follow as well.
It’s also a good idea to look at whom the people you know are following. 
That can give you ideas about whom you want to search for. Use the Twitter 
search function to find subjects relative to your industry and see who’s talking about 
them. Remember that conversation is very important. If all you do is post your 
thoughts and ideas without engaging anyone in conversation, you’re just a broadcaster. 
Eventually, if you are a well-known brand, and if you do things right on Twitter, 
new people will start following you every day.
Be personable: Too many companies represent themselves on Twitter by  spewing 
automated and static information, or authorized quotes from the public relations 
department. These only serve to keep the brand parked neatly in a dry dock, 
gathering dust. Most people who twitter do it for the human connection.

42 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Stay away from discussing politics and religion: Your mother told you this a long 
time ago, and it’s still good advice, unless, of course, your business is politics 
or religion. In that case, go for it. Otherwise, you are just going to alienate 
half your followers, maybe more. People are passionate about their political 
and religious beliefs; if you are representing a brand, you will do it a great 
disservice by taking a position on either subject.
Be aware of your voice: Think of Twitter as a ship we are all traveling on. You have 
to play nice with others or you’ll be shoved aside and ignored—or, worse, 
made to walk the plank. Besides, you never know when you might end up 
doing business with someone you now consider a competitor.
Don’t be a complainer: No one wants to listen to someone who keeps whining or 
pointing out all the things that are going wrong in the industry or the world. 
If you want people to follow you and listen, look for the positive. Sure, there 
will be times when you have to talk about things that aren’t encouraging or 
upbeat; some situations demand a solemn tone. But don’t make this a theme. 
Don’t make it what you are about. Remember, anyone can whine and com-
plain, but a leader offers solutions.
Facebook
Facebook has become the world’s leading social media site for individuals, groups, 
and families (businesses are beginning to see its value) to share their world with their 
friends and followers and to keep in touch with extended family members. Now, more 
than ever, organizations are creating a presence on Facebook to extend their reach to 
the growing number of potential (and younger) customers. Facebook users can share 
news stories, videos, and other files with friends. Personal notes can also be written 
and shared with friends. When sharing an item, users can attach the item to their Wall 
for all to see, or can tag individual people that they think would be most interested in 
seeing the item. When a user is tagged, they receive an e-mail notification.
These options for sharing and collaborating are what makes Facebook a power-
ful tool for your organization. Here are some numbers to support this: 1.15 billion 
users, 700 million daily users, average time per Facebook visit is 20 min and 8.3 h 
is the average amount of time each user spends per month, 70% of monthly active 
Facebook users in the United States are engaged and connected to a local business 
(Wallace, 2013).
Although many businesses are yet to experience the full potential of Facebook, 
the capabilities are finding their way into many organizations.
Social Media Strategy
A social media strategy is your organization’s roadmap to guide you through the social 
media maze. To reach your customers and potential customers successfully, you need to 
start telling your stories directly, and do it in a way that sparks conversations, interest, and 

Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media ◾ 43
action. The value proposition of social media is for sustained conversations that shape 
perceptions and attract students to enroll in programs and participate in its activities.
The following sections describe more specifically the aspects of a social media 
strategy. This strategy will identify specific activities and initiatives that must 
be executed to ensure that the components of the strategy are made actionable 
and contribute to the success of meeting the goals, objectives, and mission of the 
Knowledge Systems Institute.
Listen to Conversations
Social media will allow tapping into various synergistic communities to get an 
understanding of what their educational needs are, how programs align with those 
needs, and how to position programs to meet those needs. Specifically, to execute 
this, part of the strategy must focus on:
 
◾Where do the conversations take place that are synergistic to your 
 organization’s objectives and mission, and does it make sense for to have 
a presence?
 
◾What are these communities talking about, and should they have a voice?
 
◾What are your organization’s competitors doing in social media, and can they 
present a competitive advantage?
 
◾What’s the buzz about our competitors?
 
◾What content resonates with this audience?
 
◾Are there subjects of interest that could provide content for?
 
◾What social sites have the most conversation?
 
◾Whom the “fire-starters” need to connect with?
 
◾Who are the influencers in these blogs or communities?
 
◾Where are the opportunities and threats?
Establish a Share of the Voice
There are millions of conversations on social media sites every day. Every organiza-
tion needs to monitor for conversations about the programs and activities that are 
synergistic to what it offers and becomes part of the conversation. Share of voice is 
described as the percentage of mentions about your brand/company/organization 
in the particular niche or market you’re active in.
Some of the questions we must answer to achieve an active voice in our selected 
social media sites are as follows:
 
◾Do people use a generic description of what we do, or do they talk about our 
course offerings or activities specifically?
 
◾Are the comments positive or negative? What is the ratio of positive to 
negative?

44 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾Are key messages appearing in these conversations? If not, what content is 
trending?
 
◾How are our competitors faring in these conversations?
The context of your organization’s content in a competitive set shows how your 
brand stacks up against your competitors online. Your organization’s share of 
voice leads to an increase in the market share. This increased market share will be 
 supported by an increase in student enrollment. Establishing and tracking of share 
of voice is becoming an important part of social media. A gain in share of voice is 
an important measurement for social media programs.
Set Goals and Benchmarks
It is important to measure the progress and success of the social media strategy 
against the goals and objectives identified by your organization. At every phase of 
executing this strategy, metrics will provide a valuable means for focusing attention 
on desired behaviors and results.
Listening to the online conversation allows you to tap into what people are 
interested in right now, what they talk about, and what they like and dislike. This 
information will give the insights that lead to achieving your strategic goals.
The aim is to achieve the following targets.
Find and Establish Communities Every day a blog, social network, or social 
media site seems to pop up. Understand to participate in the places that make 
sense. Part of your research should include listening to what’s being said online, 
which includes “who” is talking about you, and “where” the conversations are tak-
ing place. Once you know where the majority of the conversations take place you 
can sensibly allocate resources for best ROI. Some of the activities that have been 
identified are as follows:
 
◾Identify the bloggers who talk about our industry, courses, and/or activities.
 
◾Monitor blog posts (i.e., Google Blog Search) to see who is writing on a 
 certain key topic.
 
◾Track mentions of your brand and generic keywords that describe what your 
organization does in social news sites such as Digg, Newsvine, Kirtsy, and 
StumbleUpon.
 
◾Track content about your industry, courses, and/or activities in social network 
sites (i.e., Facebook and Twitter).
Identify Influencers What is influence? It can be defined as implicit or explicit 
effect of one thing (or person) on another. What influences people online has changed 
dramatically in the past few years. The idea that the person with the most followers 
or subscribers has the biggest influence is no longer valid. Today, influence is about 

Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media ◾ 45
accuracy and trust. If you want to reach the bloggers and social networkers who have 
influence, you will need to influence their perception and/or their behavior. They’re 
the ones who send a flood of traffic to our website, because when they link to or 
recommend our courses and/or activities, their followers take action.
Some of the parameters we should use to determine which blogger and 
networkers to focus on are as follows:
 
◾Traffic: Unique visitors, page views, and RSS subscribers
 
◾Inbound links: Primarily contextual links from well-ranked sites and blogs
 
◾Reader engagement: Time spent on site, comments
 
◾Recommendations: Retweets, bookmarking, tagging, and sharing of content
 
◾Connections: Number of followers/mutual connections across multiple 
social sites
 
◾Track record: Age of domain, number of blog posts, and length of engagement
 
◾Web traffic to your site or blog: Analytics tell which sites are sending users to 
your site
 
◾Conversion rate of those visitors: What is the rate of conversion for each 
referring site?
Identify and Select Tools There’s a wide array of social media tools to choose 
from and the task can be confusing. However, our content strategy will guide us 
in identifying where to start. If the majority of the conversation about our indus-
try, courses, and/or activities is on Twitter, then we will need a custom-designed 
Twitter account.
Here’s the list of social media tools:
 
◾Search optimized press releases
 
◾Social media news release format—with multimedia and social bookmarks
 
◾Search optimized articles
 
◾News feeds (RSS) to syndicate all your content
 
◾Socializing your news content—“share this” buttons, tagging, and 
bookmarking
 
◾Blogs
 
◾Microblogging (Twitter)
 
◾Podcasts
 
◾Images
 
◾Video
 
◾Social networks (i.e., Facebook and LinkedIn)
 
◾Social media news sites
 
◾Widgets
 
◾Social media news room—gather and present all your social media content 
on your website

46 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Create and Develop Content Once the content strategy, based on solid 
research is developed, bright ideas will naturally flow about what to create and how 
to deliver this content. Experimenting with a Facebook page and a Twitter feed isn’t 
enough. You will need to create supporting content, for example, a company blog, 
an interactive website, interesting articles, images, and videos.
Good content not only sparks conversations, but it also builds links. People will 
share the content, and they’ll link to it from blog posts and tweets. This can raise 
search visibility and drive a lot of traffic to our content.
Engage and Facilitate Conversations Content should be created with a view to 
inspire and allow participants to engage in conversations. Social media is about a two-
way flow of conversation. People are no longer willing to be passive bystanders—they 
want to take active part in the conversation. Customer engagement can get you through 
the toughest of times—it’s both a customer acquisition and retention strategy.
Engaging Your Audience Followers and traffic are good and well, but are they 
engaging with you? Ninety-three percent of the Internet users active in social media 
say that they expect a company to have a social media presence to be able to actively 
engage with that company. The Forrester Research report “Social Media Playtime 
Is Over” clearly shows that dabbling or experimenting is not enough. You have 
to deliver genuinely interesting and valuable content that meets the needs of your 
audience and actively engages them.
Facilitate the Conversations Word of mouth has long been the “holy grail” 
of marketing. Peer reviews, opinions, and comments are now the number one 
influencer prior to purchase or decision online. Not only do you want them to be 
engaged with you, but you also want them to be talking positively about you to 
each other. Facilitating these conversations should be our ultimate goal. An orga-
nization must make things easy for visitors or users of your website by providing 
excellent content, which they desire to share and discuss. And then give them tools 
to make it easy to do this—send to a friend button, share this, bookmark this, 
subscribe, discuss, and comment.
Measure Results
Why measure?
 
If you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it. It’s that simple. You need to know 
where you are when you start, what needs to be achieved, and as you move along 
the path, you have to have tools to measure your progress. This way you can see 
if you are on track and adapt fast if things go awry. Your  measurement has to be 
based on business objectives—and those objectives have to be set as measurable 
goals. Just setting up attributes to track on a dashboard is not enough.

Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media ◾ 47
What to measure?
 
What you are going to measure will depend on what goals you have set 
in the initial part of your strategy. Based on listening and research, you 
should have determined what actions you need to focus on in social media. 
Measure what you did and what impact it had, and then you can see what 
result it had.
Return on engagement
 
There are many tools available today to track engagement—how many people 
clicked a link in a blog post? How many times was the message retweeted? 
How many followers does the person who retweeted you have?
Track the growth of your share of voice
 
Compare the number of articles, posts, tweets, videos, or images where a 
brand and its competitors are mentioned. Calculate how many times brand is 
mentioned the most, relative to its competitors, and by what margin. Track 
your growth in the share of voice.
Track your share of conversation
 
Share of conversation is the degree to which a brand is associated with the 
problem or need that it is setting out to help with.
Sample Social Media Strategy—Roles and Responsibilities
The following represents an organization’s social media roles and responsibilities:
Social strategist:
– Responsibilities:
• Development of the overall strategy/program, including ROI
• Executing initial identified initiatives

Content manager:
– Responsibilities:
• Development of the overall content (look-n-feel) of social media sites
• Manage content to be leveraged on social media sites
• Interacting with agreed upon social media sites (Twitter, LinkedIn, 
and Digg)

48 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Develop a Content Strategy
Success in social media depends on the quality of your content. It’s about engaging 
people, and the key to engagement is good content. In social media, people are creat-
ing, reading, saving, tagging, and sharing content. Your organization must produce 
the kind of content they value and desire to share. Telling your story online in the 
right place to the right people will give you your intended results, and establishing a 
well-thought-out content strategy, which leverages existing content and builds new 
content when needed based on solid research, will deliver these results.
Measuring Results
When measuring results, it is important to evaluate the data and conclude if you 
need to tweak or expand your program. You need to tell your story to customers, 
potential customers, employees, potential employees, business partners, and spe-
cifically to all those whom you interact with and who you wish to interact with.
Key Learnings
Establish your organization’s roles and responsibilities to handle your social media 
presence and monitor and respond (if necessary) to the communication about your 
organization. The following is a sample of the roles and responsibilities you should 
consider for you social media strategy.
Tips and Techniques
Brand reputation: By communicating with your alumni, students, perspective 
students, and friends through social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, and Digg), 
you will begin to build a positive brand as the innovative, state-of-the-art, and 
cost-effective leader in computer science graduate and certificate programs.
Increased brand awareness: The social media sites being leveraged will  facilitate 
getting the word out about your organization’s curriculum, events, and activ-
ities. By posting news articles in Digg, and interacting with our  constituents 
via Twitter and the professional community through LinkedIn, you will 
begin to build our brand and associate it with programs such as healthcare 
informatics, KM, digital art, and software programming education at the 
master’s level.
Increase share of voice: By getting the word out about your curriculum in the 
degreed and certificate programs, communicating with other thought leaders 
and constituents, and interlinking our Twitter, LinkedIn, and Digg presence 

Being Social: Knowledge Management and Social Media ◾ 49
with our website, you will increase its share of communication and interaction 
in the areas in which you specialize.
Thought leadership: Your organization’s specific use of social media through 
LinkedIn, Twitter, and Digg will provide an outlet for your content manager(s) 
to post information, respond to other participants, and make cutting-edge 
research available. This will demonstrate your organization’s thought leader-
ship in the areas of healthcare informatics, KM, digital art, and software 
programming education at the master’s level.

Dude, “Where’s My 
Car?”: Utilizing Search in 
Knowledge Management
Have you ever experienced a situation when you just could not find that docu-
ment on your content management system or a specific job aid, standard operating 
 procedure, or knowledge article in your knowledge repository? You may have known 
part of the title or what some of the contents were, but you couldn’t put your finger 
on it. You executed the latest search mechanisms on the site, and you had to weed 
through several pages of content searching for that elusive piece of information or 
knowledge. Then, finally after a period of time (who knows how long) you either 
find it (OH Yea!) or give up in frustration (Arrrg!!). A contributing cure for your 
dilemma, as well as mine and countless others, is to implement an information 
architecture (IA) that will drive a user-centric taxonomy, metadata, and associated 
keywords to enable the “findability” of your content (information and knowledge).
Information Architecture
Has been described in many ways by many scholars and practitioners alike. Usability.
Gov states that “Information architecture (IA) focuses on organizing, structuring, 
and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way.” Downey and Banerjee 
offer another definition of IA which states “IA is the art and science of organizing 
information so that it is findable, manageable and useful” (Downey and Banerjee, 
2011, p. 25). Finally, I offer my definition of IA: IA connects people to their con-
tent (information and knowledge) that includes the high-level rules that govern the 

52 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
manner in which information concepts are defined, related, realized, and managed 
by the enterprise.
IA focuses on everything you can define about a solution without specifying the 
underlying system (the raw plumbing) or specifying the particular user interface that 
will be employed to deliver and manipulate the information. IA is implementation 
and system independent. It is concerned about the architecture of how information 
is used, how it flows, and how it fits within the user’s world (its context). This leads 
to developing systems that will be intuitive to its users.
The outcome of a comprehensive IA implementation is a systematic descrip-
tion of the content of a given product, service, or environment. This type of detail 
contributes to the understanding and documenting of the complexities of system 
design to enable intricate solutions to be functional, transparent, and user-friendly. 
IA also forces clarity upward into the user interface and downward into the system 
architecture, contributing to simplifying design, development, and implementation. 
The IA in essence creates a common ground between designers and developers by 
bridging the gap between the user interface and underlying systems or technologies.
A well-defined IA not only helps you expand the function of your designs, but it 
can also inform consistent experiences and paths for the evolution of future designs 
across many variants within a family of products, services, or environments.
IA consists of several elements. The elements of focus here include information 
organization (information or content model, taxonomy, and metadata schema), 
information access, governance, and user experience. These items work hand-in-
hand to deliver the following benefits of IA:
 
◾User-centric identification of categories of content
 
◾Single source of structure and meaning
 
◾Increases ability to find content
 
◾Intuitive navigation of systems
 
◾Increases the ability to keep content fresh and relevant
 
◾Enables a better search experience
 
◾Improves content quality (“one source of truth” or “authoritative source”)
 
◾Reduces data reconciliation efforts (“location of data”)
 
◾Improves sourcing options for content (identifies source of record)
 
◾Reduces storage volume (decreases the proliferation and duplication of content)
IA has become an essential ingredient to ensure a competitive advantage for orga-
nizations of all sizes. Organizations continue to search for practical ways to create 
business value by getting their arms around the content of the enterprise to enable 
its employees to take action not only to perform their day-to-day activities but also 
to service the customer. Organizational benefits of IA include unlocking content 
to let it flow rapidly and easily to people and processes that need it; cost-effectively 
store, archive, and retrieve the right content, in the right context, at the right time; 
protect and secure that content to meet compliance requirements, and make it 

Utilizing Search in KM ◾ 53
accessible for business insight where and when necessary; and finally mitigating 
risks inherent in business decision making by providing knowledge assets when and 
where necessary and in its proper context.
To prepare your organization to develop an IA, you must consider the structure 
and composition of a repository (or website), the information collection and indi-
vidual document intelligence, accessing content (search and retrieval), as well as 
being able to locate and/or navigate to the content. In developing the IA structure, 
Downey and Banerjee (2011) describe a checklist in order to provide a consistent 
method in constructing the IA. The IA checklist presented (see Figure 4.1) evolved 
over a few iterations before a final IA checklist was formed. The checklist focuses 
on the essential areas of the IA such as the model, taxonomy, and metadata. It also

identifies significant supporting areas such as information access, governance, and 
quality of service (security, availability, and reliability). Downey and Banerjee 
indicate that
These IA checklists either cover the process of performing IA activities 
on a project or are specific to actually designing or reviewing the design 
of IA. The identified checklists focus more on process, design, and 
design review—and do not include issues of infrastructure, platform, 
services, technology, policy, and standards. Our goal in designing the 
IA checklist as part of the architectural review process was to create a set 
of questions that gets people thinking about and discussing IA in terms 
of infrastructure, existing technology, services, and platform across the 
enterprise as well as information generation, delivery, consumption 
and governance in order to lay the foundation that can then be fully 
exploited and realized at the user interface level. This broad perspective 
encourages a collaborative approach to an IA solution. (Downey and 
Banerjee, 2011, p. 27)
Content Model
A content model provides the framework for organizing your content, so that it can 
be delivered and reused in a variety of innovative ways. Once you have created the 
content model (sometimes referred to as an “ontology”) for your content repository, 
you will be able to label information in ways that will enhance search and retrieval, 
making it possible for authors and users to find the information resources they need 
quickly and easily (see Figure 4.2). The content model shows the content types (“Car 
in Service”), it’s metadata fields (Car ID, Date Entered, and Service) as well as rela-
tionships to other content types (“is a” → Unpowered Car, “is a” → Powered Car).
Creating your content model requires analysis, careful planning, and a lot of 
feedback from your user community. The analysis takes you into the world of those 
who need and use information resources every day. The planning means talking 
to a wide range of stakeholders, including both individuals and groups who have 
information needs and who would profit from collaboration in the development of 
information resources. Getting feedback requires that you test your content model 
with members of your user community to ensure that you have not missed any 
content types, domains, relationships, or other perspectives.
The content model is typically developed from working with your business/
content subject matter experts (SMEs). In working with your SMEs, business rules 
about the information relationships are established, and this greatly contributes to 
the construction of the content model. The content model will support the search 
process through establishing relationships between the content and describing how 
this information behaves (via metadata).

56 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
The information displayed represents a sharable, stable, and organized structure 
of information requirements for your system (i.e., content management system, 
knowledge management [KM] system, and/or website). The following are the steps 
necessary in constructing the content model.
Steps Involved in Constructing the Content Model
 
1. Identify/document the domains of information within the organization.
 
2. Identify/document each of the content types within the domain.
 
3. Identify/document the relationships between the domains.
 
4. Identify/document the relationships between the content types within each 
of the domains.
 
5. Identify/document the relationships between the content types located in 
other domains.
 
6. Document the business rules that support all relationships (Note: Capture 
business rules as you determine relationships).
 
7. Identify/document the metadata within each content type.
 
8. Define user roles/access within the content model (Note: This is done by 
analyzing and including user profiles within the model structure).
 
9. Describe (define) all domains and content types.
 10. Describe (define) user roles within the information structure.
To determine if a system such as a website and/or content/knowledge repository has 
no underlying content model, the following are some signs:
 
◾Difficult to determine how to get from the home page to the information 
you’re looking for.
 
◾Links do not retrieve the intended page.
 
◾Navigating to what you need brings you further away rather than closer.
 
◾Scrolling through a long alphabetic list of all the articles ever written on a 
particular subject with only the title to guide you.
A well-conceived content model has the following characteristics:
 
◾Links to pertinent information are readily available.
 
◾You are able to get what you need in three clicks or less.
 
◾The content retrieve is tailored for you and in a way you can quickly consume 
it and use it.
 
◾Available cross-references (associated and related content) are in the right 
places.
 
◾Categories right away look familiar to you and navigation seems more 
intuitive.

Utilizing Search in KM ◾ 57
When a content model is clearly defined and established, the users of the various 
systems who implement the content model will be on track to finding, retrieving, 
and using the content they need. A great method for flushing out and validating 
your content model is to perform a card sort exercise (you more than likely will 
have to conduct several card sorts). For more information, review the section on 
card sorts as well as the box “How to Conduct a Card Sort.”
Taxonomy
Taxonomy is a hierarchical classification or framework for information retrieval. 
Taxonomies represent an agreed vocabulary of topics arranged around a particu-
lar theme. Taxonomies can have either a hierarchical or nonhierarchical structure. 
However, typically taxonomies are presented in a hierarchical fashion as illustrated 
with taxonomies such as in libraries, biology, or military organizations (see Figure 4.3).
Hierarchical taxonomies are a tree-like structure with nodes branching into 
sub-nodes, where each node represents a topic with a few descriptive words. This 
way of classifying information becomes more important as the number of items 
increases and people have more trouble remembering what they have and where 
to find it. This is critical as we move into Big Data, which represents the immense 
volume of information available to organization and the public through the vast 
array of social media sites and throughout the Internet.
Content types and metadata along with a solid taxonomy will greatly enhance your 
search to return what you are looking for. Taxonomies are the basis of  classification 
schemes and indexing systems in information management (see Figure 4.4). Information 
professionals and librarians rely on classification and controlled vocabularies to aid pre-
cision search; abstract and index publishers make investments in indexing and thesauri 
to add value to their products. Many organizations are experimenting with semantic 
technologies, hoping to automatically extract the meaning inherent in documents and 
supplementing, or even replacing, the human editorial process.
Taxonomies of entities for search engines are designed to improve relevance 
in vertical search. Vertical search content area may be based on topicality, media 
type, or genre of the content. Common verticals include shopping, the automotive 
industry, legal information, medical information, scholarly literature, and travel. 
Examples of vertical search engines include Trulia.com and Yelp. However, general 
web search engines attempt to index large portions of the web’s content by using 
a web crawler, whereas vertical search engines typically use a focused crawler that

58 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
attempts to index only web pages that are relevant to a topic or set of topics. Vertical 
search can be viewed as similar to enterprise search where the domain of focus is the 
enterprise, such as a company, government, or other organization.
Taxonomies, thesauri, and concept hierarchies are crucial components for many 
applications of content and KM systems as well as information retrieval and natural 
language systems. Building, tuning, and managing taxonomies are important fac-
tors in approving the search experience that should not be overlooked.
Metadata
Metadata is an important aspect of the IA and in particular the content model. Meta-
data is primarily used for labeling, tagging, or cataloging information or structuring 
descriptive records. Metadata (fields and attributes) are assigned to a content type 
to provide a means to describe it and provide the means in which to find content 
once it becomes part of a system. The metadata attributes and values that are embed-
ded in each content type (sometimes referred to as an “object”) within the content 
model make it possible for the person searching for a flight reservation, a vehicle 
to purchase, and a multitude of other items within a system to find what they are 
looking for.

Utilizing Search in KM ◾ 59
The creation of metadata has generally been approached in two ways: professional 
creation and author creation. In libraries and other organizations, creating metadata, 
primarily in the form of catalog records, has traditionally been the domain of 
dedicated professionals working with complex, detailed set of rules and vocabularies. 
The primary problem with this approach is scalability and its impracticality for the 
vast amounts of content being produced and used, especially on the World Wide 
Web. The apparatus and tools built around professional cataloging systems are 
generally too complicated for anyone without specialized training and knowledge. 
A second approach is for metadata to be created by authors.
Metadata Fields
The metadata fields describe the primary dimensions of a content type. Metadata 
fields are the individual items of metadata stored within a content type. There are 
two types of metadata fields:
 
◾Required metadata: This includes fields that are required to describe the 
content type.
 
◾Custom metadata: This can be configured by an administrator to any values 
required by the site or installation.
It is important to note that the same metadata fields can be used in multiple 
metadata groups and each metadata field has a setting associated with it. The 
 following settings are common to most metadata fields:
Name: Enter the name of the metadata field
Data type:
– Boolean: A true or false value
– Date: A date/time field
– Floating point number: A floating point number
– Integer: An integer field that supports up to 32-bit numbers
– Large integer: An integer field that supports up to 64-bit numbers (not 
normally required for custom metadata)
– Text
– Unicode string: An alphanumeric Unicode string
Specialized Settings
The following settings apply only to certain data types:
 
◾Default value: Enter an optional default value for the field. Depending on the 
data type, this can be a checkbox or a specialized value entry such as a date, 
a time code value, or even two values.

60 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾Lookup values: Choose a lookup from this list to display the metadata field as 
a pop-up menu with a set of values. Only the lookups with the same data type 
are displayed. See for details on creating lookups.
 
◾Date only: This is a checkbox that forces only dates to be entered.
 
◾Scale numbers: This is a checkbox that scales numbers to three digits 
(999 maximum) with the appropriate suffix. For example, 1000 becomes 1K.
 
◾Don’t format numbers: This is a checkbox that forces the metadata field to 
use raw numbers without formatting, such as commas separating groups of 
thousands.
 
◾Multiline: This is a checkbox that allows multiple lines of text to be entered 
in the metadata field.
Metadata Attributes
The metadata attributes describe the individual instances of a content type. 
Metadata attributes further define the behavior of content by describing their 
accessibility to other content. Since search engines are explicitly designed to rec-
ognize predefined keywords, metadata values are extremely important. Once you 
determine the information a user will want to look for within a document and 
what data should be extracted, you will need to assign those values as metadata 
attributes. Whenever possible, standard metadata attributes should be used. These 
attributes provide a wide range of options for storing your document’s metadata. 
Users can restrict searching to specific attributes, and so it is important that you use 
standard metadata attributes whenever possible.
Simple attributes: Simple attributes are those whose values can be stored in a 
single database column.
List attributes: A list attribute is one that can have a set of values, where each 
value is a simple one and all the values are of the same type.
Metadata Schema
A metadata schema establishes and defines data elements and the rules govern-
ing the use of data elements to describe a resource. A metadata schema is used to 
define the metadata fields that need to be filled out on particular content type. 
Each schema defines the fields and their type, whether it is required, the default 
value of the field, whether it can be edited (see Figure 4.5). You can create as 
many metadata schemas as you may need for the system. Metadata will not only 
enable designers to gather and rearrange the information to suit their require-
ments, but the information developers would also have many ways to organize 
the information.

Card Sort
Card sorting is a method used to help design or evaluate the IA. In a card sorting 
session, participants organize topics into categories that are sensible to them and 
reflect the categorizations of content that they work and communicate with. To 
conduct a card sort, you can use actual cards, pieces of paper, or one of several 
online card-sorting software tools (see box “How to Conduct a Card Sort”).
Card sorting will help you understand your users’ expectations and under-
standing of your topics. It is often most useful once you have done some

homework to find out about your users and understand your content. Knowing 
how your users group information can help you:
 
◾Build the structure for your systems that handle content.
 
◾Decide what to put on the main page and landing pages of the system.
 
◾Label categories and navigation.
Depending on your needs, you may choose to do an open or closed card sort:
Open card sort: Participants are asked to organize topics from content within 
your website/repository into groups that make sense to them and then name 
each group they created in a way that they feel accurately describes the content. 
Use an open card sort to learn how users group content and the terms or 
labels they give each category.
Closed card sort: Participants are asked to sort topics from content within your 
website/repository into predefined categories. A closed card sort works best 
when you are working with a predefined set of categories, and you want to 
learn how users sort content items into each category.
Card sorting will not provide you with all of the answers to develop the final struc-
ture of your IA and user-experience design, it can help you answer many questions 
you will need to tackle throughout the information design phase. In many cases, 
there will likely be some areas that users disagree on regarding groupings or labels. 
In these cases, card sorting can help identify the following trends:
 
◾Do the users want to see the information grouped by subject, process, business 
group, or information type?
 
◾How similar are the needs of the different user groups?
 
◾How different are their needs?
 
◾How many potential main categories within a certain navigation are there?
 
◾What should those groups be called?
You may find yourself conducting several card sorts with a varying degree of scope. 
This will better equip you to come to an agreement to the questions stated above as 
well as enable you to better address the information design phase.
Search Facets
Faceted search offers remarkable potential for putting the search experience in the 
hands of the user. It provides a flexible framework by which users can satisfy a wide 
variety of information needs, ranging from simple lookup and fact retrieval to com-
plex exploratory search and discovery scenarios.
With faceting, search results are grouped under useful headings, using tags you 
apply ahead of time to the documents in your index. For example, the results of a

HOW TO CONDUCT A CARD SORT
Prepare the Cards
 
1. Create your list of content topics. Topics can be phrases or words, very 
specific or more general. As a suggestion, limit yourself to 50–60 topics or 
less. This means there might not be a card to sort for every page on the site.
For a new site, list the content topics for the categories of information 
that you are likely to have on the site.
For an existing site, list the most important/popular types of content.
To create this list:
Review the content listed in your content inventory.
Identify the most important or most frequently used content.
 
2. Decide whether you will be doing a physical card sort or using online 
card-sorting software.
If you are using online card-sorting software, consult the software 
instructions.
If you will be conducting a card sort using physical cards, write each 
topic on a separate index card.
Use self-adhesive labels and a word processor. The cards will be 
neat, legible, and consistent. You’ll have the list of topics in the 
computer for later analysis.
Number the cards in the bottom corner or on the back. This helps 
you when you begin to analyze the cards.
Have blank cards available for participants to add topics and to 
name the groups they make when they sort the cards.
Consider using a different colored card for having participants 
name the groups.
Set-Up the Session
 
1. Plan about 1 h for each session, or longer if you have many cards.
 
2. Arrange the space.
For paper card sorts, ensure the participant has enough room to spread 
the cards out on a table or tack/tape them up on a wall. A conference 
room works well.
For online card sorts, ensure there is a computer with an Internet 
connection available as well as room for both the participant(s) 
and facilitator to sit comfortably.
 
3. Plan to have the facilitator or another usability team member take notes 
as the participant works and thinks aloud.
 
4. As with other techniques, arrange for payment or other incentives to 
thank the participant for spending the time and effort helping you.
(Continued)

64 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Lead the Session
 
1. Show the participant the set of cards. Explain that you are asking for 
help to find what categories of information should be on the site’s home 
page and what those categories should be called.
In an open card sort, explain that you want to see what groupings of 
cards make sense to the participant, and that you will ask for a name 
for each group of cards once the participant has grouped them.
If you are conducting a closed card sort, explain that you want to see 
how the participant thinks the cards fit within the defined groups.
 
2. Ask the participant to talk out loud while working. You want to under-
stand the participant’s thoughts, rationale, and frustrations.
 
3. Let the participant work. Minimize interruptions but encourage the 
participant to think aloud. Allow the participant to:
Add cards—for example, to indicate lateral hyperlinks or additional topics.
Put cards aside to indicate topics the participant would not want on 
the site.
 
4. If, at the end, the participant has too many groups for the home page, 
ask if some of the groups could be combined.
 
5. Ask the participant to name each category.
In an open card sort, give the participant a stack of different colored 
cards. Ask the participant to use the colored card to name each 
group. Ask what words the participant would expect to see on the 
home page or second-level page that would lead the participant to 
that particular group of content items.
In a closed card sort, asking about word expectations, their final card 
organization, and other follow-up questions can provide valuable 
insight and observations for your research.
 
6. At the end, thank the participant and give the payment or gift if promised.
Remote Sorting Sessions
 
1. Create your list of content topics. Topics can be phrases or words, and 
can be very specific or more general. It might be tempting to have a card 
for every topic on your site, but in this case, more might not be better. 
Consider the cognitive load on the participant. You want them to be as 
on task for your first card as your last. As a suggestion, limit yourself to 
50–60 topics or less.
 
2. Prepare the cards according to the software instructions.
 
3. Email your participants a link to the study. Provide instructions for the 
sort (whether open or closed) and let them know approximately how 
long the session should take to complete.
(Continued)

Utilizing Search in KM ◾ 65
 
4. If a comment box is available, urge participants to use the field to record 
any observations or questions. Although you will not be able to answer 
them in real time for the participant, these comments can be useful for 
your analysis.
 
5. Thank the participant for his or her time and provide instructions for 
receiving payment or gift (if promised).
Analyze Your Data
 
1. Prepare your data for analysis.
If you used online card-sorting software, consult the software instructions. 
The software will analyze participant data in a variety of ways.
If you used physical cards for the test, either photograph the sort or use 
the numbers on the cards to quickly record what the participant did. 
Photograph or write down the names the participant gave to each 
grouping and the numbers of the cards the participant included under 
that name. Then you can reshuffle the cards for the next session.
Create a computer file for each session to gather a complete picture 
of the detailed site map each user creates.
Work from your original list of topics and move topics around to 
recreate each participant’s groupings and enter that participant’s 
name for the groupings.
If you used a physical card sort, you can also take a photograph of 
the finished card sort for reference later.
 
2. Analyze qualitative information based on user comments.
 
3. Analyze quantitative information based on:
Which cards appeared together most often
How often cards appeared in specific categories
 
4. For a less detailed analysis of the results, use your notes and recordings 
of the participants’ names and card numbers under each person’s name 
to find commonalities from different sessions.
 
5. For a more detailed analysis, consider using an Excel spreadsheet to 
show the relationship between the cards or use one of the available 
software programs to analyze your data.
 
6. Pull together your findings in a report to share with your team and 
stakeholders.
After you analyze the data from card sorting, you should have useful informa-
tion for structuring the information architecture of the site. You should use 
the results of your card sort to help you define the navigation of your site.

66 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
shopping query for books might be grouped according to the type of book and the 
price.
Each time the user clicks a facet value, the set of results is reduced to only the 
items that have that value. Additional clicks continue to narrow down the search—
the previous facet values are remembered and applied again.
Faceted search results provide an easy-to-scan, browsable display that helps users 
quickly narrow down each search. The faceting tags that you store with your docu-
ments provide a way to add your own taxonomy to directly control the presentation 
of search results. In the end, it’s about helping the user find the right information. 
Faceted search gives a user the power to create an individualized navigation path, 
drilling down through successive refinements to reach the right document. This 
more effectively mirrors the intuitive thought patterns of most users. Faceted search 
has become an expected feature, particularly for commerce sites.
Faceted search is performed in several parts:
 
◾Index: To each document in the index, add tags to specify a value for each 
facet. For example, for each book in the index, tag it with the type of material 
and the price range.
 
◾Search results: For every search, the server returns a count of how many 
matching documents were tagged with each value within each facet. For 
example, if the query was for “books,” you might find out that in the facet 
“type of material,” your index contains 13 science fiction books, 15 romance 
novels, and 10 cookbooks; and in the price facet, there are 5 books under 
$10,200 books from $10–$19.99, and so on.
 
◾Query: You can include facet values as query criteria. For example, you can 
write a query that returns only the romance novels under $10.
 
◾Web page: Use the facets and document counts returned by the server to create 
a set of facet links on your web page. Then construct queries to be activated by 
each facet link, passing in the appropriate values.
Store the facets and facet values as metadata by adding tags to documents in your 
system.
After you have tagged documents, the server will start to show faceting data in 
the results it returns for search requests. For example, if you search for books about 
France, you might get results like the following:
French History
France Travel
French Art
You can filter a search by using facet values. This is similar to using document 
variables. Before you start implementing faceting, take some time to decide on 
the facets and values that make sense for your index. When you consider how to 
categorize information, all sorts of interesting questions can arise. Depending on 

Utilizing Search in KM ◾ 67
the size of your index and whether you are working in a large enterprise, you might 
need to hold a few meetings involving key people such as website designers, product 
managers, information architects, and others. The goal of your design phase is to 
arrive at a scheme, which will define the facets and their values.
The Role of the Information Architect
The information architect is the essential person(s) who will ensure user input is 
incorporated into the design and construction of your content and KM systems. The 
information architect ensures that the categorizations of content (information and 
knowledge) correctly reflect how the user views and works with their content as well 
as ensure application configuration that will facilitate a search experience, which in 
turn will yield the right results to users. These individuals incorporate techniques such 
as developing the content model(s), taxonomy, and metadata schema. Specifically, the 
information architect assumes the responsibility for the following (see Figure 4.6):
 
◾Investigating the requirements of the customers for the content and structure 
of information deliverables.
 
◾Understanding the underlying content structure of the information categories 
that authors must produce and developing standards based on these structures.

68 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 ◾Instantiating business rules into the structures to support authors and encourage 
compliance.
 
◾Creating structures that promote finding and reusing content in multiple 
contexts, including metadata schemes, to label content appropriately for 
delivery to customers.
 
◾Creating an authoring environment that accommodates both the preferences 
of authors and the needs of the business for compliance with standards.
 
◾Developing standards for content assembly in multiple media that meet 
customer and business requirements.
 
◾Building style sheets that apply appropriate formatting to content for each 
type of deliverable.
Instead of focusing on typical IT problems, the information architect approaches 
the project with a threefold focus: user of the information, the information itself, 
and the business/organization.
The information architect typically begins to organize information according 
to three interrelated primary dimensions: workflow, product model, and informa-
tion type.
He or she begins by analyzing the types of work done by the end users of their 
products or services and begin to construct the content model. The developed con-
tent model begins with a dimension that enables the information architect to label 
information topics among their content types with relationships that represents 
the end user’s workflow. This is typically followed by understanding the metadata 
that will describe each of the content types. The information architect represents a 
key individual (or team) who will incorporate the users’ content representation and 
navigation requirements into the final application as well as provide the design to 
ensure accurate search and retrieval of the content.
Search Intent
The search intent is another aspect of search where the IA is very valuable. Using 
the IA’s user-provided metadata and keywords, the intent of the search being 
 performed by the user can be determined. Search queries are informational, navi-
gational, or transactional. As part of this process, characteristics are defined for 
the different types of queries. For example, use of question words (i.e., “ways to,” 
“how to,” and “what is”), queries containing informational terms (e.g., list and 
playlist), and queries where the searcher viewed multiple results pages. Some of 
the steps to determine search intent include: the selection of keywords, capturing 
a list of the top site URLs that return from each search, identifying the best search 
terms and keywords, leveraging the meta keywords identified in the keywords 
metadata field, and sorting the keywords and phrases in descending order of their 
perceived importance.

Utilizing Search in KM ◾ 69
Your environment should be modeled based on the taxonomy to provide 
functionalities to the end users in form of site navigation, branding, and search. 
Taxonomy planning is important for the long-term adoption of any system because 
it provides the framework by which users find the content (information and 
knowledge).
Tools
There are many tools and possible solutions available to solve our search 
dilemma. The following are a few tools to consider if we ever hope to not only 
find information on our knowledge repositories but also to provide solutions to 
our inquiries.
Knowledge Management Suite for SharePoint 2010 from Layer2 is focused on 
improved content tagging and discovery. Although this product has not been rated 
with any reviews, it promises to deliver many features that a taxonomy structure 
will be able to take advantage of. These features include the following:
 
◾Tag Suggester: While tagging an item or document, display a suggestion list 
based on term store taxonomies, tagging rules, item properties, context, and 
document content.
 
◾Auto Tagger: Tag items and documents in background without any user inter-
action, based on Term Store taxonomies, tagging rules, item properties, con-
text and document content. Auto Tagger could be helpful for initial tagging, 
for example, after content migration from any system to SharePoint 2010, as 
well as for daily background operation.
 
◾Taxonomy Manager: Manage the Term Store with additional metadata prop-
erties (e.g., tagging rules and related tags), export and import, change man-
agement, workflows.
 
◾Tag Navigation Web Part: It provides collaborative tagging by using the 
SharePoint 2010 managed metadata taxonomy tree directly for content dis-
covery and navigation.
 
◾Tag Directory Web Part: Render the SharePoint 2010 managed metadata tax-
onomy tree as flat A–Z directory category index directly for content discovery 
and navigation.
 
◾Tag Cloud Web Part: Navigate the content by its importance using a familiar 
taxonomy-based tag cloud.
 
◾Related Content Web Part: Automatically display related content in a given 
context using managed metadata.
By the way, Layer2  provides shareware (free) version of their Knowledge 
Management Suite.

vocabularies, Taxonomies, Thesauri, and Ontologies.
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings gathered from this chapter:
 
◾It is not just the search tool that will enable users to find content, but a 
well-formed IA along with the search tool will also render the best search 
results.
 
◾When developing an IA, it is best to leverage a checklist (see Figure 4.1; 
Downey and Banerjee, 2011). This checklist ensures all aspects of the IA are 
covered.
 
◾When constructing a content model follow the steps in order to provide a 
consistent structure and approach.
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques deduced after reading this chapter.
Best practices for card sorts.
 
◾Limit the number of cards. Do not attempt to sort “ALL” of your content, 
and be mindful of participant fatigue. It’s recommend that 30–40 cards at 
the absolute outside be used, especially for an open sort.
 
◾Randomize the order of presentation, so that each piece of content has a 
chance to be sorted earlier in the session.
 
◾Provide the participants with a time box of how long the card sort will take 
before beginning the session to help them better gauge the required time and 
effort.
 
◾For an open sort, consider requiring users to sort the cards, and not to label 
them, since that might be the more challenging part of the task, provided 
that you have limited your items as suggested in point 1.
 
◾Consider an open sort as part 1 and a closed sort as part 2 of your process. 
Part 1 allows you to learn what goes together, whereas part 2 allows you to 
really test out your labels to see if they are intuitive to your participants.

The Age of Discovery: 
Knowledge Management 
in Research Institutions
Research institutions are critical to innovation and new product creation. The speed 
to market for new products is essential to stay ahead of the competition. Knowledge 
Management (KM) plays a central role not only from the perspective of knowing 
what has been done and/or what is being done in other areas of research, but also 
from the collaboration and knowledge sharing among researchers contributing to 
new ideas that produce innovative products for the marketplace.
Research institutions and research departments that use KM effectively have 
an advantage over their peers who do not use KM by developing better products, 
having improved processes to deliver products to market more efficiently, increasing 
the level of innovation at their organizations, and establishing an environment of 
empowerment through collaboration for research professionals. KM adoption and 
effectively using KM are challenging, and this chapter addresses the challenge of 
equipping research professionals with the necessary tips, tools, and techniques that 
will accelerate the use of KM. This accelerated use of KM will enable research insti-
tutions to realize the benefits KM offers to compete effectively in their  respective 
industries.

74 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Five Challenges Faced When Implementing 
KM in Research Institutions
There are challenges (I would like to call “opportunities”) in implementing KM in 
all organizations. However, research institutions present a unique challenge of what 
knowledge should be shared and at what time. On account of the nature of clinical 
trials for pharmaceutical researchers, the technology and engineering studies and 
proof of concepts for software, and engineering and manufacturing companies, 
sharing tacit and explicit knowledge in a timely manner could be the difference 
between success and failure, producing groundbreaking innovation, or delivering 
just another product. The following are five challenges/opportunities in implement-
ing KM within a research organization:
 
1. Integrating KM into the everyday operations
 
2. Building effective communication strategies
 
3. The need to create a conducive environment for the adoption of KM practices
 
4. Understanding the required knowledge to be shared
 
5. Determining the necessary tools to be used to facilitate KM
As identified from the above challenges, KM adoption (see Chapter 16 for more 
details concerning KM adoption) and effectively using KM are the primary chal-
lenges. This chapter addresses the challenge of equipping research professionals 
with the necessary tips, tools, and techniques that will help accelerate innovation 
through the use of KM. Specifically, there will be five key take-away items that 
the research professional will be able to gleam from this chapter, and they are as 
follows:
 
1. Establish the case for implementing a KM strategy
 
2. KM strategy (specifically for research organizations)
 
3. Techniques for knowledge sharing
 
4. Techniques to stimulate innovation
 
5. Methods/tools for capturing, cataloging, and reusing research, and locating 
research knowledge/expertise
The Case for Implementing a KM Strategy
Chapter 2 addressed the case for implementing KM. This chapter specifically iden-
tifies scenario 4. This scenario specifically addresses to those organizations that 
have a need to bring new product innovations to the marketplace. It states
 
◾The case for KM in this area addresses situations where duplication of 
effort occurs, not having the right team in place to perform the research 
to bring the product innovation to market successfully and in a timely

manner, always reinventing or starting from “square one,” difficulty in 
locating current and/or historical corporate information/knowledge on a 
specific topic(s), and expertise leaving the organization, thereby creating 
a  knowledge gap.
The major purpose of research organizations is to bring innovative ideas to the mar-
ketplace. If your research organization is experiencing what is being described in 
scenario 4 in Chapter 2, then your organization has a case for implementing KM.
To articulate the case for implementing KM at your research institution, the 
following questions must be answered:
 
1. What incentive do I present to my research professionals to encourage them 
to share their knowledge?
 
2. What is the return on investments (ROI) for research institutions/ departments 
using KM?
 
3. How important is it to receive executive leadership buy-in on leveraging KM?
 
4. What is the key challenge facing research professionals using KM?
In order to implement KM into your research department or institution, you must 
present a case by identifying problem(s) that need to be addressed, which can be 
as follows:
 
◾Duplication of effort
 
◾Nonavailability of an appropriate team to perform the research
 
◾Always reinventing or starting from “square one”
 
◾Difficulty in locating current and/or historical corporate information/
knowledge on a specific topic
 
◾Expertise leaving the organization, thereby creating a knowledge gap
Developing Your KM Strategy
The KM strategy presented here specifically applies to research institutions and the 
unique challenges they face. The vision, mission, and subsequent initiatives that 
address specific problems of your research organization should be identified and 
detailed within this strategy. Aligning KM initiatives to address a specific research 
problem is identified in Table 5.1. This table, although not an exhaustive list, will 
give you some perspective on where to start.
Components of a Research Organization’s KM Strategy
The following represents the categories and details that must be included in your 
KM strategy, which will be leveraged to address research problems that KM can 
effectively solve.

Executive Summary
This section briefly reveals to your reader the present situation of your company, 
the likely future of the organization, and the need to implement a KM strategy. 
The executive summary should highlight the strengths of your overall plan and 
therefore be the final section you write.
KM Vision Statement
The KM vision statement takes into account the current status of the organiza-
tion and serves to point the direction of where KM in the organization is heading 
toward. As a means of setting a central goal that the organization will aspire to 
reach, the vision statement helps to provide a focus for the mission.
KM Mission Statement
The KM mission statement serves as a guide to the actions of the organization as 
it pertains to KM, spell out its overall goal, provide a path, and guide decision-
making. It provides the framework or context within which the company’s KM 
Strategy is formulated and aligns with the KM vision (Note: the KM Vision and 
Mission are often combined).

This section details the current knowledge environment. Any KM activities and 
experience will be detailed here. This section will also outline any benefits that have 
been gained, and how they can be built upon or leverage in future initiatives.
Challenges and Knowledge Needs

and will include any knowledge resources, processes, and tools that will be needed 
to effectively execute the KM strategy.
Strategy Details and Key Initiatives
The key activities to implement the KM strategy (knowledge capture, knowledge 
transfer, knowledge sharing, innovation strategies/initiatives)
Key Performance Indicators and ROI
A key performance indicator (KPI) is a selected indicator that is considered key for 
monitoring the performance of a strategic objective, outcome, or key result area 
important to the success of an activity and growth of the organization overall.
R&D sums up the activities centered around research and development, with the 
purpose of improving current situations and performance within the organization. 
According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, R&D 
refers to creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock 
of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this 
stock of knowledge to devise new applications. There are 82 KPIs for R&D published 
within knowledge and innovation as part of the KPI Compendium.
Some of the KPIs related to KM within R&D include the following:
Cost savings due to R&D
Cost per R&D laboratory surface
Percentage of staff with PhD degrees
Number of new products per researcher
Cost per researcher
Number of first to market products
Number of products/services co-developed in partnership with customers
Percentage of product development projects completed
Number of patents per million dollars of R&D investment
Number of payback period of new products
Presented in more detail in Chapter 8, the knowledge value equation, by Mark Clare 
(2002) presents a way to measure the value that KM will bring to your research 
organization. This equation examines the use of discounted cash flow (DCF) and 

78 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
presents an equation: KM value = F (cost, benefit, and risk) = Total DCF created 
over life of KM investment. The equation states that the value created from manag-
ing knowledge is a function of the costs, benefits, and risks of the KM investment 
(project or strategy) in leveraging and protecting the knowledge (Clare, 2002). This 
equation can be applied to the cost/benefit of the innovation that leads to new 
products being introduced to the marketplace.
An important concept identified in determining the knowledge value equation is 
to build a knowledge value tree (see Figure 5.1). A knowledge value tree makes the 
connection between knowledge and value in an organization, which is more visible 
by understanding the relationship and connection of KM functionality, business 
impact, and financial impact (Clare, 2002). When applied to research, the business and 
financial impact of the innovation have to be analyzed. One could also take into account 
the societal impacts/benefits as another dimension/extension of the equation.
Dependencies
This section will detail critical dependencies such as the availability of key person-
nel, approval of budgets, and available technologies to initiate the KM strategy.

On-Going KM
On-going support, which describes the on-going execution of the KM strategy, 
includes:
Identifying the key knowledge holders within the organization
Creating an environment that motivates researchers to share
Creating opportunities and utilizing tools to harvest knowledge
Creating opportunities to foster innovation
Designing mechanisms for governance and maintainability of knowledge
Measuring the effects of executing the research knowledge strategy
Establish a Research KM Office
The Research Knowledge Management Office (RKMO) is comprised of senior 
management and core team members and is the vehicle for implementing and 
keeping under review the KM program and the on-going KM initiatives that will 
be championed by the organization. This office will serve as the organizational 
component that will operationalize the KM program, executing the initiatives that 
align with the vision and mission of the KM strategy.
Tools
This section details the necessary tools and how they will be used to deliver the KM 
research strategy.
Knowledge Sharing Techniques
Knowledge sharing is an essential part of the KM research strategy. The following 
represents techniques for knowledge sharing:
 
◾Conducting after action reviews (AARs) (capturing lessons learned)
 
◾Identifying/participating in communities of practice (CoPs)
 
◾Working in collaborative settings
After Action Reviews
An AAR is a facilitated session that is conducted with a team or a group after completion 
of a piece of work or project. The objective of an AAR is to capture the knowledge gained 
by the team as a result of the performing/executing the work.
An AAR
 
◾Makes learning conscious and explicit.
 
◾Identifies valuable lessons that may be helpful to future teams.

80 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾Enhances team openness and cooperation.
 
◾Allows closure at the end of the project.
Some AAR facts include the following:
Participants: An AAR is conducted by the persons who participated in the 
activity being reviewed. Formal AARs may be conducted by a facilitator, 
but the participants should be those persons who were actually involved, 
not their representatives or off-site supervisors
The AAR is conducted
• At the end of a project.
• At the end of a particular phase in a project.
• At the end of a conference.
• At the end of a procurement action.
• Immediately following a significant event or action.
The types of AARs include the following:
Formal: Formal AARs are generally conducted at a more extended break 
in the activity being reviewed; they may take a full day and result in a 
detailed report.
Informal: While an activity is in progress, or for an activity of short duration, 
most of the AARs in which our associates are likely to participate will be 
informal, consisting perhaps of an hour-long discussion at the end of a 
day. More likely to result in a mid-course correction than a policy shift, 
informal AARs enable teams to identify what is working—and what 
needs work.
AAR steps: These describe the general steps in conducting an AAR and their 
significance. The specific steps taken in conducting an AAR will depend on 
how much time you have allotted, outside resources needed and/or available, 
the complexity of your operation, and what is expected to be accomplished 
(Table 5.2).
Communities of practice: CoPs are groups of people who share a common interest 
in a particular domain area, and who interact regularly to learn how perform 
aspects of the discipline better. CoPs are formed by people who are engaged 
in a collective learning experience, who usually interact often to learn, share, 
and to better perform their craft.
A CoP
• Can exist online via discussion boards, wiki’s, news groups or in real 
life via meet-ups or other group settings.
• CoPs consist first and foremost of practitioners; specialists who per-
form the same job or collaborate on a shared task.
• CoPs often form spontaneously, driven by the need of the members 
for operational knowledge.
• CoPs are also deliberately encouraged where knowledge transfer is 
necessary.

Table 5.2 After Action Review Steps
After Action Review Steps
Comments
 1. Assemble participants as soon after the 
event(s) as practicable.
 2. Establish rules and explain objectives.
 3. Summarize events as they were 
planned to occur, with work and time 
estimates, as appropriate.
 4. Elicit discussion on how the events 
actually took place. Strategies to make 
this happen include:
• Identify mistakes, but don’t assign 
blame. The focus should be on the 
actions, not on the actors
The AAR discussion is a process of 
discovery, as all team members 
share their perspectives on what 
happened and why. The shared 
observations of the newest 
interns through the senior-most 
associates are essential to piece 
together how and why some 
objectives were met and others 
were not.
• Articulate assumptions
The explicit statement of 
previously overlooked 
assumptions often leads to 
better solutions.
• Address objective and subjective 
dimensions of the events
Discussion subjects, including 
 attitudes, expectations, fatigue, 
and stress, may help to explain 
outcomes in addition to more 
objective information.
• Ask open-ended questions, not 
questions that have one-word 
answers
Open-ended questions encourage 
discussion and exploration of a 
topic. They are also less likely to 
make participants defensive. 
Compare, “Describe your trip to 
the court house,” with “Why did it 
take you so long to get to the 
court house?”
(Continued)

82 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
In cultivating CoPs, Etienne Wenger points out three characteristics that 
make a CoP:
Domain: The domain represents a shared membership of interest. “Membership 
therefore implies a commitment to the domain and therefore a shared 
competence that distinguishes members from other people.”
Table 5.2 (Continued) After Action Review Steps
After Action Review Steps
Comments
Big picture questions include:
• What went well, and by what 
standard?
• What could have gone better?
• More detailed questions may address:
• Why actions were taken?
• How associates responded to 
situations?
• When actions were taken relative to 
other events?
• What alternative actions might have 
achieved better results?
• What is required to replicate good 
performance?
To follow up on what went well/
what could have gone better, ask 
participants to assign a 
numerical rating to an action. 
Subsequent discussion on how 
to improve the rating may lead 
to the kinds of details that will 
enable the team to improve 
overall performance.
 5. Record results: List the associates who 
participated, what learning was 
achieved, what changes are planned, 
and what practices will be 
strengthened.
Some of the observations of the 
AAR will need to be shared with 
higher and lower levels of the 
organization.
 6. Establish the expectation of AARs as a 
regular, re-occurring feature of your 
organization’s operations. They should 
not be considered a sign of failure.
As a group activity, the AAR can 
promote group cohesiveness 
and identity. Through repetition, 
it makes individuals more 
reflective practitioners.
7. AAR pitfalls that must be avoided:
• Allowing performance critiques
• Lecturing
• Over-analyzing minutiae
• Griping, complaining, and general 
negativity
• Allowing stronger personalities to 
dominate the review, keeping others 
from participating

KM in Research Institutions ◾ 83
Community: The community is represented by members engaging in joint 
activities and discussions, helping each other, and sharing information. 
They build relationships that enable them to learn from each other.
Practice: A CoP is not merely a community of interest, for example, people 
who like certain kind of dog. Members of a community of practice are 
practitioners. They develop a shared repertoire of resources: experiences, 
stories, tools, and ways of addressing problems. A Practice takes time and 
sustained interaction.
For CoPs, see Figure 5.2.
Working in Collaborative Settings
Working in collaborative settings encourages the sharing and exchanging of ideas. 
Having spent many years as a KM consultant, working in this type of environment, 
I can attest first hand to the effectiveness this type of workspace provides when it 
comes to collaborating. According to my experience, collaborative workspaces are 
ideal for a maximum of 12 people. Too many people and there will be an abun-
dance of “side bar” conversations going on that the whole group could, but will not 
benefit from.
On the “Office Snapshots Blog—Pixar Headquarters and the Legacy of Steve 
Jobs,” It is indicated that Steve Jobs redesigned the offices of Pixar to suit a more 
collaborative and diverse thinking environment. At Pixar, these offices originally 
housed computer scientists in one building, animators in a second building, and 
executives and editors in a third. Jobs recognized that separating these groups, 
each with its own culture and approach to problem-solving, discouraged them 
from sharing ideas and solutions. This environment encouraged animators to 
introduce fresh perspectives when perhaps the computer scientists became stag-
nant; and maybe the executives would learn more about what animators and sci-
entist are doing. Jobs ultimately succeeded in creating a single cavernous office 
that housed the entire Pixar team, and John Lasseter (2012), Pixar’s chief creative 
officer, indicated that he’d “never seen a building that promoted collaboration and 
creativity as well as this one.”
The key features that make for a collaborative office space:
 
◾An open plan and other design features (e.g., high-traffic staircases) that 
encourage accidental interactions.
 
◾More common areas than are strictly necessary—multiple cafeterias and 
other places to read and work that encourage workers to leave confined offices.
 
◾Emphasis should be laid on areas that hold two or more people, rather than 
single-occupancy offices.
 
◾Creation of purpose-free generic “thinking” areas in open-plan spaces, which 
will encourage workers think in the presence of other people, rather than 
thinking alone.

Innovation Techniques
Having initiatives that stimulate innovation is another key ingredient of the KM 
research strategy. The following represents techniques to stimulate innovation:
Creating diversified teams
Conducting the knowledge café
Conducting root cause analysis sessions
Creating opportunities for brainstorming
Creating Diversified Teams
In my blog post in 2010, I wrote about the need for diversity in order to stimulate 
innovation.
The power that Knowledge Management (KM) brings to an organiza-
tion is its ability to leverage the power of diversity. I am not speaking of 
just diversity of race, gender and/or religion, but diversity of thought. 
Through collaboration, knowledge sharing and knowledge reuse it is 
important to leverage different points of view, different experiences and 
different cultural backgrounds to stimulate diversity of thought. This 
diversity of thought leads to innovation. This innovation will enable 
organizations to deliver unique and or improved products and ser-
vices to its customers as well as improve the way the organization does 
business.
Diversity of thought has to be encouraged and used in our organizations today. 
From a research perspective, by bringing a diverse mindset and experiences to the 
table, we can begin to understand that diversity of thought will stimulate innova-
tion; we must realize that diversity in our collective thought is a must if an organi-
zation wants to stay ahead of its competitors.
The Medici Effect
The Medici effect (see Figure 5.3) is the ultimate environment to stimulate innovation. 
According to Frans Johansson, the author of The Medici Effect, the Medici effect is
The place where different cultures, domains, and disciplines stream 
together toward a single point. They connect, allowing for establish 
concepts to clash and combine, ultimately forming a multitude of new 
groundbreaking ideas. This intersection where all of these fields meet 
and the explosion of remarkable innovations that are found there is 
called…. (Johansson, 2014)

86 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
The Medici effect utilizes the diversity of thought and brings those different cul-
tural, intellectual, and life experiences together to increase the level and opportu-
nity for innovation.
Creating the Medici Effect
To utilize the diversity of thought our organizations bring to research and to inno-
vations that occur, an environment to stimulate this innovation must be  created. 
The innovation techniques mentioned earlier are those activities that build an 
environment to create innovation and your own Medici effect. To create the 
Medici effect, Frans Johansson states
We can ignite this explosion of extraordinary ideas and take advantage 
of it as individuals, as teams, and as organizations. We can do it by 
bringing together different disciplines, cultures and searching for the 
places where they connect.
Applying the Medici effect will enable intersectional ideas to flourish once you step 
into that intersection of different disciplines and cultures.
Conducting the Knowledge Café
“Knowledge cafés” is a term used for group sessions where a number of people 
(from a small number to several hundred) are assembled to discuss implications of 
some topic that affects them and their organization.

KM in Research Institutions ◾ 87
Typically, the knowledge café is conducted by presenting the topic and its back-
ground to the group. This presentation is followed by brief (5–15 min) discussions 
small groups (five or fewer persons) of the implications and what they may mean 
for the participants.
The groups are then scrambled and discussions are repeated—often for four 
or five cycles before summaries are collected. Knowledge café’s solicit input and 
obtain buy-in for a new product, project, or initiative, as a stimulus to innovation: 
Knowledge cafés connect people to people, people to ideas, and ideas to ideas; they 
challenge people to reflect on their thinking, surface new ideas, and make new 
connections. It also breaks down organizational silos and encourage knowledge 
sharing and creation of a knowledge sharing culture.
Creating Root Cause Analysis Sessions
Root cause analysis is typically a result of a brainstorming session. In Surviving 
Root Cause Analysis (Robitaille 2014), the Chartered Quality Institute indicates 
that root cause analysis creates the input to corrective action planning by establish-
ing requirements. Without thorough and well-controlled investigation of the root 
cause of a given problem, any attempt at corrective action is doomed. It would be 
like manufacturing a product without fully developing the specifications needed to 
fulfill the design requirements.
The first step in this process is to evaluate the situation—the inputs—and arrive 
at a conclusion in order to initiate root cause analysis. The second is to select the 
members of the team who will conduct the root cause analysis. Giving thoughtful 
deliberation to the assignment of team members is as important as it is for any other 
process. It’s important to assign tasks to competent individuals, to communicate 
expectations, and to ensure their availability for the project.
As you begin to select participants, it’s important to communicate the 
 distinction between evaluation and root cause analysis. Otherwise, there will be 
the  predictable confusion, with individuals assuming that once they’ve told you 
that the bore is undersized, or the battery needed to be replaced, or a test wasn’t 
correctly scheduled, their job is done. What they need to understand is that root 
cause analysis has just begun.
There are two simple tools that help to generate ideas about what could have 
happened. They are brainstorming and the “five whys.” The overwhelming benefit 
of both of these is that they stimulate our creativity; they get us out of our habitual 
narrow focus, so that we can explore other possibilities.
Creating Opportunities for Brainstorming
In a 2010 Fast Company article by Gina Trapani she indicated that, “Coming up 
with good ideas is a major part of your job, so you want to have the right tools on 
hand to generate as many ideas as possible during a brainstorming session.” Here 
are some tools and techniques for doing just that.

88 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
When you want to perform free-form thinking and gather ideas and tasks around 
a central concept, try a mind map. In the middle of the page, write down your topic. 
Then, all around the topic, jot down tasks, words, ideas, and connect them by drawing 
lines between them and branching similar ideas off of them. The most effective offline 
tool for mind mapping is probably a classic whiteboard, wet marker, and eraser. To 
mind map online, check out www.mindmeister.com, a free Web app where you can 
create, share, and publish your maps. The advantage of mind mapping is that it’s not 
linear bullet points, and because it’s unstructured, it can encourage more free thinking.
When you’re brainstorming, create the environment your brain needs to get 
creative. Give yourself plenty of writing space and utensils; get everything out of 
your head and onto paper to make room for new insights. When you can, get your-
self out of your normal workspace—go outside, or to the conference room with 
the great view, or to the coffee shop—to get the creative juices flowing. When you 
can, choose an open space with high ceilings. A 2007 study showed that people 
in rooms with high or vaulted ceilings tended to think more freely and abstractly.
If generating ideas is a regular part of your job, make sure you have tools you 
love to use on hand all the time. Splurge on a fancy pen or notebook, something 
that you love to write with, and take it with you on the train or to the dentist, and 
write whenever you have a chance, capturing any thought that might be useful.
Methods/Tools for Capturing, Cataloging, Reusing, 
and Locating Research Knowledge/Expertise
The proposed model is based on the principle that a research center has a “knowledge 
reservoir” of its own. This knowledge base is much more than the sum of individual 
knowledge of employees, and it is capitalized, more or less over time, through infor-
mation products (documents, databases, software, etc.) or by knowledge exchanges/
transfers, individual or collective. The knowledge is created by the research actors 
(which are the principal “knowledge workers” of a research centers), most of time by 
interaction with the various information systems available in the center (databases, 
search engines, document management systems, software, etc.). Some knowledge is 
exchanged in an informal or semi-formal way (discussions, communities, seminars, 
etc.); it produces tacit knowledge. Some knowledge is codified in new records (pub-
lications, reports, documents, etc.); it is explicit knowledge. It accumulates in the 
firm during its history, and forms what is called a “knowledge capital.”
The research center has the vocation to produce knowledge, an immaterial 
product. The development of the knowledge map started from a conceptual clas-
sification of domains, which organizes the information around subjects, objects, or 
finalities. The process has several steps.
Location of Knowledge Domains
This step consists (from reference documentation and eventually from inter-
views) in highlighting knowledge domains by the successive analysis of research 

KM in Research Institutions ◾ 89
departments, their activities, projects, and products. The necessary reference docu-
mentation consists of the following:
 
◾Documents of an organization (missions, organizational charts, descriptions 
of activity, portfolio of activities, etc.)
 ◾Documents concerning production (publications, studies, activity statements, etc.)
 ◾Strategic documents (mid-term plans and summaries of previous mid-term plans)
 
◾Quality documents
Construction of the Representation of the 
Knowledge Capital by a Knowledge Map
The former step is a deep analysis of the activities of the firm. The next step aims 
at making it accessible and more usable. The representation must be adapted to the 
operational vision of the people concerned. The main idea of the cartography is to 
distribute the different knowledge domains on strategic axes. The definition of stra-
tegic axes is conditioned by the strategic orientation given to the business process. 
One may use the missions of the firm as they are defined in the basic strategy, but it 
may also integrate new axes concerning strategic development. The map was built 
following a considerable number of discussions with different actors and numerous 
cross-validations. First, the cartography was carried out on the research domains of 
the institute. It was then extended to the whole portfolio of activities, including the 
support activities. The map is now available on the intranet with an online form, 
which allows employees of the institute to “self-declare” regarding a certain number 
of their skills.
Knowledge Map
A knowledge map is a graphic representation of interconnected knowledge sources. 
This organized knowledge involves large bodies of interconnected facts. It is useful 
for organizing related knowledge/knowledge holders in a structured manner that 
facilitates comprehension by showing the connections between the various pieces.
A knowledge map is usually the results of a knowledge audit. The knowledge 
audit is an investigation into the organizations knowledge assets, where they are, 
who interacts with them, and how to access them. A typical knowledge audit looks 
at the following:
 
◾The organization’s knowledge needs
 
◾The knowledge assets or resources it currently has and where they are
 
◾The knowledge gaps
 
◾The knowledge flow within the organization
 
◾The existing knowledge blockages

90 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
The knowledge map example shown here is the result of a knowledge audit for 
A.J. Rhem & Associates, Inc., a small management and software development con-
sulting firm (see Figure 5.4). The A.J. Rhem & Associates’ Corporate Knowledge 
Map is a visualization representing the flow of knowledge within the organization. 
An analysis of the knowledge map indicates the following:
 
◾All of the corporate knowledge flows in and out of the president.
 
◾There is no interaction with others in the senior management team but 
through the president.
 
◾The president, managing director, and training director are all interacting 
with the marketing/sales staff and training staff.
 
◾The president and training director are both interacting with the consulting 
staff.
 
◾There is some cross-training/interaction between the consulting staff and 
training staff.
 
◾The president is the only one interfacing with the finance/accounting 
department.
The following indicates the initial knowledge needs of the organization as specified 
by the knowledge audit:

◾Knowledge sharing program is necessary between the president and the 
senior management staff, in order to distribute the corporate knowledge from 
the president to other senior management staff members.
 
◾Foster an atmosphere of knowledge sharing among all members of the senior 
management staff through weekly stand-up meetings.
 
◾Realign senior management team and the communication between the con-
sulting staff, marketing/sales staff, training staff, and human resource agency 
to have communication and receive direction from one senior management 
and have all senior management report to the president.
 
◾Formalize program to provide cross-training between the consulting staff 
and the training staff. This will facilitate increasing the skill and knowledge 
level of consultants and trainers in order for each to fill the other’s role when 
necessary.
 
◾Formulate knowledge transfer plan to share and cultivate knowledge between 
management staff as well as consultant and training staff members.
This presents a typical example of using a knowledge audit/knowledge map as a 
tool for understanding knowledge and expertise within your organization.
Knowledge Portal/Repository/Knowledge Base
A knowledge portal/repository is a technology used to capture, catalog, store, and 
retrieve content and knowledge. The knowledge portal/repository also provides 
organizations with a rich and complex shared information workspace for the gen-
eration, exchange, and use/reuse of knowledge.
Similar to a knowledge repository, a knowledge base is a collection of role-
specific knowledge. This knowledge includes tips, techniques, procedures, 
 guidelines, and work products related to performing activities and tasks for 
a  specific role (i.e., research administrator, research analyst, data analyst, and 
 principle investigator).
A knowledge base typically contains a representation of explicit knowledge to 
solve some of the most common problems facing the organization. The intent of the 
knowledge base is to accumulate this knowledge and make it available to its users.
In order to make a knowledge base more effective, there are many points to be 
considered. In my experience in developing a knowledge base, I have determined 
the following five aspects of a proficient knowledge base:
 
1. Quickly search, retrieve, add, and update content (information and knowl-
edge) to the knowledge base. This allows for users to contribute to the 
knowledge base more effectively.
 
2. Designed for collaborative use. A real-time collaborative environment and 
knowledge capture facility creates a lively free exchange of ideas.

92 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
3. Provide guided participation (via a blogging structure as an example) that 
will lead to new learning. In this environment, someone acts as a “modera-
tor,” creating structure and topics to stimulate conversations and to capture 
the knowledge/solutions being addressed.
 
4. Integrate a variety of media (i.e., video, voice, and text). Incorporating video 
and voice will add richness to the interaction and to the knowledge/solutions 
being captured.
 
5. Help in the decision-making process. Enable the knowledge base to recognize 
where key knowledge holders exist, their core competencies, and the content 
that they author, access, and share.
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾Some key points to consider implementation KM in your research 
organization:
– Get executive buy in
– Align KM research strategy with the enterprise’s KM strategy and the 
organizational strategy
– To begin the adoption process execute no or low budget KM
– Conduct the knowledge audit (first major initiative)
– Construct an (interactive) knowledge map (outcome of the knowledge 
audit)
 
◾Facts about—no or low budget KM consists of executing the following 
activities:
– Bringing back notes and other materials from KM classes and/or KM 
conferences
– Meetings—make decisions and be intentional about transferring/sharing 
knowledge and documenting outcomes and next steps
– Performing knowledge cafés where appropriate (see section on “Innovation 
Techniques”)
– Informational brown bags—lunch and learn
– After action reviews and lessons learned
– Training—mentoring and cross-training, e-learning
– Knowledge sharing—alerts, organizational awareness, and quick tips
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques deduced after reading this 
chapter:

KM in Research Institutions ◾ 93
Tip regarding conducting a knowledge audit
 
◾The knowledge audit is usually the first major step of a KM initiative. It’s 
used to provide a sound investigation into the company or organization’s 
knowledge “health.”
 
◾A knowledge audit looks at problems and puts the information in the context 
of the problem. The reason a knowledge audit is so vital is because it gives an 
organization a comprehensive picture of its strengths and weakness, allowing 
it to focus its efforts in the right direction.
To get quickly started using KM in your research efforts follow these quick tips:
 
1. Start with a list of the roles in your organization.
You must have a clear understanding of how your organization creates value 
for your users (both internally and externally). Make sure you can answer 
these questions:
• What are the major activities and processes that take place?
• Who carries out each of these activities?
• Where are the decisions made?
This information is probably already available to you, as part of your organi-
zational governance. If it isn’t, then have a think about governance before 
you get started on KM.
 
2. Identify activities that would benefit from improved knowledge (Note: 
Expansion of the scope of your KM program should take place after your 
high-priority activities have been started and/or completed):
– Prioritize these activities that
• Use a lot of resources.
• Have a major impact on internal and external knowledge users.
• Are not currently performed well due to a lack of knowledge.
Look in some detail at how these activities are performed. Talk to the peo-
ple actually doing the work and making the decisions and identify how 
knowledge supports them:
– What knowledge is available now?
– What knowledge could improve the activity?
– Does someone else in the organization have the knowledge that is needed?
This should result in a list of activities that could benefit from improved 
knowledge, and some idea of where that knowledge could be found.
 
3. Identify tools and techniques to help with knowledge transfer.
There are many different tools and techniques that can be used to help acquire 
knowledge in the right place. Consider creation, storage, and manage-
ment of content identifying all the different approaches you might use 
based on your organization’s culture and preferences, as well as on the 
type of knowledge you need to manage.

94 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
The following is an initial list of things that you might want to include:
• Searchable document repository
• Knowledge base integrated into your internal and external knowl-
edge customers (including service management and customer facing 
toolsets)
• Mentoring and coaching
• Webinars and podcasts
• Discussion forums and social media platforms
• Instant messaging, click-to-e-mail, and click-to-call features
When you have a comprehensive list of possible techniques, you can consider 
which of them might be suitable for each of the activities and types of 
knowledge that you identified in the previous step.
 
4. Motivate people to share the knowledge that is needed.
Most of the knowledge you need probably already exists within your 
organization, but you will need to motivate the people who have this 
knowledge to share with those who need to use it. This will depend on 
your organizational culture, and on the tools and techniques that you 
have selected.
You will probably want to identify a small number of KM champions to 
model the behavior you want, and to encourage other people. It can also 
be very effective to publish the names of people who make useful knowl-
edge contributions, and to provide reward and encouragement for the 
desired behaviors.
 
5. Motivate people to use the knowledge that has been shared.
Remember that knowledge can only create value when it is used by someone 
to make decisions or deliver services. You need to think about incorpo-
rating the knowledge that is being created into the activities that you 
identified earlier.
Use techniques to identify and acknowledge the authors of the most reused 
pieces of knowledge, and the people who make the most use of shared 
knowledge. When you know what knowledge is being reused, you can 
also use this to justify further investment in KM and to plan future 
improvements.
 
6. Manage your knowledge to ensure it remains relevant and helpful.
Don’t forget that KM isn’t a one-off project; it has to include a change in the 
culture of your organization. This means applying all the management 
of change techniques that you would use for any other organizational 
change.
Leverage a comprehensive governance plan for your knowledge assets. You will 
need to constantly review the sources of knowledge, to ensure that they 
remain relevant and helpful, and purge anything that is out of date.

“Where Have All 
My Experts Gone?”: 
Knowledge Management 
in Human Resources and 
Talent Management
If your organization is losing valuable knowledge due to staff retirement, staff mov-
ing to other departments, or staff dismissed for a variety of reasons, then your 
organization has a strong case for the implementation of a human capital/talent 
management strategy. Managing your human capital when your staff enters the 
organization through employee orientation; mapping their roles, responsibilities, 
and their work products as they perform their duties; and executing a comprehen-
sive exit interview are all aspects of a knowledge management (KM) strategy aimed 
at moving your human capital to corporate capital. Specifically, I want to address 
leveraging KM to manage your human capital.
Infusing a human capital management (HCM) strategy with KM such as 
knowledge capture, knowledge cataloging and reuse, knowledge sharing, and con-
necting expertise throughout your organization will improve the talents of your 
people and increase the organizational competency.
Some time ago, I had a conversation with one of my colleagues regarding his 
organization’s loss of critical expertise. As people started to move in and out of the 
company valuable knowledge gaps appeared. In a statement of exasperation he asked, 

96 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
“Where have my experts gone?” To address these gaps, the organization began to 
seek short-term (6 months or less) expertise to perform specific duties. When these 
resources moved on the organization was back to square one. This led him to ask the 
following questions: “How can we address this in the long term?” “Where can we 
find experts to fill these positions long term?” “How would you address this issue?”
These are indeed, given the situation, the questions that we must seek to address. 
I informed him that the first task would be to prioritize the areas that have experi-
enced knowledge loss, and based on that perform a knowledge audit of the area that 
has been identified as the higher priority. In addition, further knowledge audits 
should be scheduled for the remaining areas as his organization became more com-
fortable with executing knowledge audits. I also informed him that the knowledge 
audit will reveal to him what specific knowledge gaps exist, who are the current 
knowledge holders, and what percentage of knowledge is tacit, explicit, or both.
If the knowledge gap is tacit, then understanding the specifics of this tacit 
knowledge would help you determine the type of expertise you need to hire and the 
duration for the same. If the knowledge is explicit, then your key knowledge hold-
ers may have access to this knowledge somewhere in the organization (knowledge 
repository/portal, network folders, on the shelf, etc.). You may also have the ability 
to purchase this knowledge or perform research to document this knowledge. I also 
believe that engaging the key knowledge holders when it comes to identifying the 
“right” personnel to bring in to fill key positions will start to address his concerns 
about where to find the experts he needs.
A KM strategy entails a collective visioning as to how sharing knowledge can 
enhance organizational performance, and the reaching of a consensus among the 
senior management of the organization that the course of action involved in 
sharing knowledge will in fact be pursued. Implicit in such a process is a set of deci-
sions about the particular variety of KM activities that the organization intends to 
pursue, including how the knowledge assets of the organization will be leveraged 
(with human capital being the primary asset), and the execution of the process and 
tools that will enable sharing of knowledge and innovation to occur.
As part of applying KM to a comprehensive human capital/talent manage-
ment strategy, an understanding of the roles, work products (artifacts), and tasks 
( activities) are key for a person’s onboarding and/or gaining understanding of what 
is required for a particular job (see Figure 6.1). It is important for any organization

to not only identify the corporate roles, tasks, and work products but also to pro-
vide the necessary guidance around this aspect of the corporate structure. In doing 
so, creating an environment in which all employees can seek to achieve knowledge 
in specific roles is essential to infusing corporate knowledge and managing human 
talent within the organization.
One way to accomplish this is to build a knowledge base of corporate roles, the 
tasks that each role performs, and the work products that are produced along with 
the guidance (i.e., whitepapers, templates, FAQs, key contacts, PowerPoint presen-
tations, video, and audio).
Role-Based Knowledge
Role-based knowledge focuses on the specific knowledge needed to perform in a 
given role. It identifies the activities that are needed to be performed as well as the 
work products that are needed to be produced.
Role Knowledge Base
A role knowledge base is a repository of worker knowledge, which is aligned directly 
to roles that are leveraged by the organization. This knowledge is specifically cap-
tured for a role (analyst, staff assistant, project manager, marketing specialist, etc.) 
and is aimed at performing tasks related to activities that produce work products. 
The Knowledge Acquisition Unified Framework (KAUF)™ is an example of a role 
knowledge base geared toward capturing and cataloging role-based worker knowl-
edge. The KAUF is utilized to capture explicit as well as tacit knowledge and transi-
tion this knowledge into an environment in which it can be harvested into a KM 
repository, knowledge-based system, knowledge map, or other KM tool. The KAUF 
provides a repeatable process for identifying, understanding, and cataloging the tacit 
and explicit knowledge of the organization during the knowledge elicitation process.
Knowledge Map to Identify Experts
To assist in establishing the knowledge repository (or “library,” as it is sometimes 
called), producing a knowledge map of your organization will be greatly benefi-
cial. A knowledge map is an excellent tool to facilitate the identification of the 
key knowledge holders and knowledge gaps; it identifies areas to leverage existing 
knowledge and where knowledge is eroding. However, performing a knowledge 
mapping exercise should focus on a particular department, functional area, or 
specific organizational domain and gradually built upon until an entire knowledge 
map of your organization exists.

98 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Knowledge mapping is an essential component of conducting a knowledge 
audit and overall KM strategy. The knowledge map serves as a navigation aid 
to identify and locate explicit and tacit knowledge. This mapping directly leads 
to identifying candidates for tacit knowledge capture within the organiza-
tion. The knowledge map should be an interactive knowledge map with acces-
sibility through the organization’s information system infrastructure (intranet, 
SharePoint, etc.).
In order to properly manage your organization’s human capital assets, it is 
important to identify knowledge and content managers and knowledge architects 
who can facilitate in capturing, codifying, organizing, and maintaining your cor-
porate knowledge assets. Furthermore, these resources will be the principle staff 
involved in the creation of your knowledge repositories, knowledge mapping, and 
strategy and audit activities.
For a moment, consider the value of having such an environment and its many 
uses. Some of them that immediately come to mind include being able to quickly 
have a new person filling a role to come up to speed and create assigned deliverables. 
Or, perhaps having a repository of “knowledge nuggets” supplied by experienced 
people in that role, which can serve as the repository of worker knowledge that can 
be accessed by anyone in the organization, which will lead to performing that role 
more effectively and efficiently. This will lead to increased performance within the 
workforce and will transition your organization to compete in these challenging 
economic times and well into the future.
Human Capital Management
Human capital is the stock of competencies, knowledge, habits, and social and 
personality attributes (including creativity and cognitive abilities) embodied in 
the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value. HCM is an approach 
to employee staffing that perceives people as assets (human capital) whose cur-
rent value can be measured and whose future value can be enhanced through 
investment.
HCM contains a set of practices that are focused on the organizational need 
to provide specific competencies and are implemented in the following three 
 categories: talent acquisition and planning, workforce management (WFM), and 
workforce optimization.
Talent acquisition and planning: Today’s knowledge-driven economy requires 
workforce planning to attain and retain talent, regardless of the size of your 
organization and industry. Your strategy must deliver high-quality talent 
at the right time to address the right knowledge gaps to improve/continue 
operational efficiency.

KM in Human Resources and Talent Management ◾ 99
 
 
Talent acquisition and workforce planning must be linked to gain per-
spective on opportunities for collaboration. The merging of the two groups is 
identified as a way to link the talent planning (strategic) and execution (tacti-
cal) aspects of talent management. This enables better line of sight into the 
current and future talent requirements for their areas of responsibilities.
 
 
In order to source, identify, recruit, and select talent that meet the long-
term workforce, the plan is to use multiple strategies for attraction and recruit-
ment of talent. The amount of resources deployed to a vacancy is dependent 
on both the quantity and the difficulty.
 
 
The majority of vacancies require a multi-pronged approach using internal 
and external resources. This will include using the services of some search 
firms for strategic recruiting services to assist in the identification of the pas-
sive candidate. 
 
 
A process for designing effective advertising campaigns that enhance the 
initial buy-in with key potential talent is a key component to attract new tal-
ent into the organization. There is a direct linkage to align talent to corporate 
objectives. A focus on key occupations and geographic locations with a tailor 
message will enhance the ability to attract the “right” talent.
Workforce management: WFM is all about assigning the right employees with 
the right skills to the right job at the right time. WFM is basically all the 
activities needed to maintain a productive workforce, including payments 
and benefits, human resources (HR) planning, training and development, 
time-keeping and attendance, recruitment, performance management, and 
forecasting and scheduling. Our focus for WFM includes career and succes-
sion planning/talent acquisition, talent management and/or applicant track-
ing, learning management and/or training management, and performance 
management.
Workforce optimization: Workforce optimization is concerned with enabling 
businesses to take control of all aspects of their staffing, and helps staff 
understand how they affect the business’s performance, with an emphasis on 
improving this incrementally over time.
 
 
Workforce optimization, in addition, takes this one step further by using 
analytics to tie WFM to key business concepts such as growth, profit, and 
customer experience. Workforce optimization is best viewed as the next logi-
cal step in the move to optimize the performance of staff and to understand 
and manage the overarching impacts of staff based on both operational effi-
ciency and the customer experience.
 
 
Workforce optimization is closely related to and an evolution of WFM 
by encompassing all aspects of managing the complete workforce life cycle 
(see Figure 6.2). KM infused within workforce life cycle management will 
include knowledge transfer activities during the onboarding process facili-
tated by HR; access to specific role-based knowledge geared to quickly get 

100 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
the new employee up to speed and to provide key knowledge throughout the 
employee’s evolution in the organization will be facilitated through talent 
management; to incentify the employee to share knowledge to increase per-
formance will be initiated through specific incentive programs facilitated by 
incentive management; and learning management will facilitate filling gaps 
in knowledge and/or needed expertise to perform current and future organi-
zational functions.
HCM within an organization provides employees with clearly defined and 
 consistently communicated performance expectations. Managers are responsible 
for rating, rewarding, and holding employees accountable for achieving specific 
business goals, and as identified earlier, KM will play a key role in creating inno-
vation and supporting continuous employee growth and performance.
Talent Management
Talent management is a set of integrated organizational HR processes designed 
to attract, develop, motivate, and retain productive, high-performing employees. 
As opposed to HCM where there is an emphasis on the management of employ-
ees. Susan Heathfield (2016) in her article “What Is Talent Management—
Really?” states “Talent management is an organization’s commitment to recruit, 
retain, and develop the most talented and superior employees available in the job 
market.”

KM in Human Resources and Talent Management ◾ 101
Talent management (from John Hopkins University, Office of Talent Man age-
ment and Organization Development)—includes the following:
Workforce planning: The intentional and strategic projection and planning of 
access to talent (either internal or external) with the skills, knowledge, and 
behaviors essential for the achievement of the organization’s strategic objec-
tives and/or demands.
Recruiting: The ability to successfully attract and hire key talent for current 
and future organizational needs through competency-based advertising and 
interviewing efforts.
Onboarding: The process of acclimating new hires and ensuring that they 
quickly feel welcomed, and valued by the organization. This process enables 
new employees to become productive members of the organization, who 
understand expectations for their job roles. Onboarding goes beyond tra-
ditional “orientation” programs, which focus mainly on managing policies, 
forms, and procedures.
Strategic plan/goal alignment: The process of developing and implementing plans 
to reach an organization’s long-term goals and objectives. It is the roadmap 
to lead an organization from where it is now to where it would like to be in 
3–5 years.
Performance management: An ongoing process of communicating and clarifying 
job responsibilities, priorities, performance expectations, and development 
planning that optimize an individual’s performance and aligns with organi-
zational strategic goals.
360-degree assessments: 360-degree feedback is an assessment tool that provides 
faculty and staff leaders with feedback on their performance. Supervisors, 
peers, and direct reports answer questions based on their perceptions and 
observations of the leader’s skills and attributes.
Executive coaching: “A helping relationship between a client and a consultant, 
who uses a wide variety of behavioral techniques and methods, to assist the 
 client to achieve mutually identified goals to improve professional perfor-
mance and personal satisfaction in an effort to improve the effectiveness of the 
client’s organization Kilburg, 2000.
Leadership development: Intentional goal-driven activities that enhance the 
quality of leadership abilities or attitudes within an individual or an 
organization.
Professional development: Process of establishing training goals and plans that 
link to individual goal attainment, career planning, and possible succession 
planning.
Career path/Career development: This includes structuring the career progres-
sion of the organization’s employees and an individual’s process for identify-
ing job opportunities within an organization’s structure, and the sequential 

102 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
steps in education, skills, and experience-building needed to attain specific 
career goals.
Recognition programs: A method of acknowledging, honoring, encouraging, and 
supporting individuals and teams who contribute, through behaviors and 
actions, to the success of the organization.
Compensation: A way to reward individuals for important work accomplish-
ments, contributions to the goals of the organization, and increased skills 
and competencies in their jobs.
Succession management: Succession management is a process for identifying 
and developing internal personnel with the potential to fill key or critical 
organizational positions. Succession management ensures the availability of 
experienced and capable employees that are prepared to assume these roles 
as they become available.
Diversity/inclusion: Diversity represents a group consisting of individuals with 
similar and different experiences and backgrounds. Some of these differences 
include race, color, religion, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, age, 
disability, veteran status, and ethnicity, but there are many other dimensions 
of diversity. “Diversity” does not address how people with different back-
grounds and experiences function or work together.
Engagement: The extent to which employees are committed to their organiza-
tion’s goals and values, motivated to contribute to organizational success, and 
at the same time are able to enhance their own sense of well-being.
Competencies: Those measurable behaviors, characteristics, abilities, and person-
ality traits that identify successful employees against defined roles within an 
organization.
Retention: A systematic effort focused not only on retaining an organization’s 
talented performers but also on creating and fostering a welcoming work 
environment and high-retention culture. The end result is an organization 
that operates more effectively and efficiently, while becoming a great place 
to work.
KM Influence on Talent Management
KM will directly influence the following aspects of talent management by
Workforce planning: Providing guidance on knowledge gaps (either internal or 
external) and the long- and short-term needs of the organization to address it.
Recruiting: Providing an understanding of the competencies needed for talent to 
be successful in the position/role you are recruiting for.
Onboarding: Providing and ensuring that new hires have access to knowledge 
of the company, their specific department, and role(s) they will be filling 

KM in Human Resources and Talent Management ◾ 103
for the organization. This enables new employees to become productive 
members of the organization, who understand expectations for their job 
roles.
Strategic plan/goal alignment: Influencing the process of developing and 
 implementing plans (with specific projections of knowledge needs and the 
alignment of that knowledge) to reach an organization’s long-term goals and 
objectives. It is the roadmap to lead an organization from where it is at present 
to where it would likely be in 3–5 years.
Performance management: Ensuring that employees have access to  critical 
knowledge and expertise to perform well in their designated role(s). It is 
an ongoing process of communicating and clarifying knowledge that opti-
mizes an individual’s performance and aligns with the organization’s stra-
tegic goals.
Leadership development: Providing the right knowledge and expertise that will 
enhance the quality of leadership abilities or attitudes within an individual 
or organization.
Professional development: Providing access to knowledge and expertise (both 
internal and external), and plans that link to individual’s goal attainment, 
career planning, and possible succession planning.
Career path/career development: Providing individual’s knowledge of the com-
petencies, role-based knowledge (tasks, activities, and work products being 
produced), and access to fill knowledge gaps will give an understanding of 
what is needed to attain specific career goals.
Recognition programs: Enhancing the method of acknowledging, honoring, 
encouraging, and supporting individuals and teams who contribute to 
include knowledge sharing activities, which contribute to the success of the 
organization.
Compensation: A way to reward individuals for important work accomplish-
ments, contributions (including knowledge contributions) to the organiza-
tional goals, and increased skills and competencies in their jobs.
Succession management: Providing access to knowledge and expertise (both 
internal and external) to ensure the availability of experienced and capable 
employees who are prepared to assume roles as they become available.
Talent management focuses on all of the employees from planning, recruitment, 
onboarding to exit interview. In this chapter both HCM and talent manage-
ment have been combined because KM will have an influence on the entire 
workforce life cycle and many aspects of talent management. The goal of both 
HCM and talent management is to create a high-performance, sustainable orga-
nization that meets its strategic and operational goals and objectives, and having 
the right knowledge at the right time in the right context is key in achieving 
this goal.

104 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
High-Impact Talent Management Framework
One final word on talent management! To begin infusing KM within talent man-
agement, your organization must start with a talent management model. Building 
a talent management model to suit an often volatile and transformational business 
landscape requires taking a detailed look at talent management. Bersin & Associates’ 
Talent Management Framework® takes this detailed approach. In developing this 
framework, they examined hundreds of organizations and intended to show a 
graphical depiction of how the various talent management processes come together 
(see Figure 6.3) (Bersin et al., 2010).
The framework begins by defining a talent strategy in the context of the busi-
ness strategy. In this case, Bersin indicates that the talent strategy should help the 
company to achieve its business goals. Alignment to the business strategy is critical 
for the next area, workforce planning. In workforce planning, the organizations 
will define their talent segments, identify critical roles, and analyze organizational 
skills gaps. This information will be leveraged to drive succession plans, recruit-
ment strategies, and learning agendas. It is then that the company enters into the 
solution phase of talent management (Bersin et al., 2010).
“Capability and competency management” is next; it is this information (skills, 
competencies, and experiences) that will enable organizations to answer the follow-
ing questions: For what do we hire? Against what do we assess? Toward what do we 
develop? (Bersin et al., 2010).
Job profiles capture this critical information, and should be developed and 
managed for all critical roles, which should have been defined in the previous area 
of workforce planning. The largest section of the framework, in the center, includes 
those processes that directly touch the employees at different stages of the employ-
ment cycle (recruiting, assessing, developing, and rewarding) (Bersin et al., 2010). 
One role of talent acquisition is to fulfill the workforce plan. Whether filling posi-
tions with internal or external candidates, it is at this stage that a new ‘cycle’ begins. 
The next four areas are integral to developing and mobilizing talent to where it is 
needed (Bersin et al., 2010).
Leadership development: Ensures that companies have high-performing leaders 
to run the company.
Succession management: Defines the kind of bench strength that is necessary for 
succession (top down—position-driven).
Career management: Creates awareness of employees’ career goals (bottom up—
employee-driven).
Performance management: Provides a vehicle for assessing talent.
“Total rewards” is capped on the end of this center section. Throughout the 
employee life cycle, it is critical that employees are rewarded appropriately.

106 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
“Learning and capability development” was placed toward the bottom of 
our framework, across the entire employee life cycle, because it is truly an 
enabler for talent management strategies to be realized. Without learning, a 
company and its talent become stagnant. It is essential that talent continues to 
learn and develop as the business evolves and grows, and the workforce needs 
change. The learning and capability development function is, in turn, driven 
by gaps defined:
 
◾Once an employee is hired or moved into a new role (the learning curve)
 
◾By the data from performance management reviews (strengths and 
weaknesses)
 
◾As a result of an employee’s career aspirations (progression)
 
◾As necessary to fulfill a succession plan in some period (readiness)
The pillars or bookends of the framework are essential for keeping all of the mov-
ing parts connected. “Organization and governance” ensure alignment, oversight, 
accountability, and follow-through, whereas “business metrics and analytics” are 
defined to determine how effective the talent programs are, collectively. As an 
essential piece of the framework, the “talent infrastructure” ensures that data and 
processes are aligned, integrated, and accessible. The infrastructure “maps” the pro-
cesses, so that integration points are clear and provide the systems for enhancing 
the processes (Bersin et al., 2010).
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter: 
Workforce optimization solutions: When selecting a workforce automation 
 solution look for solutions that:
– Tie together vertical WFM systems and provide bridges HR, operations, 
and IT.
– This should be a business-driven approach that automates the entire 
workforce life cycle (see Figure 6.2).
– Make key data more visible at more levels in order to support better 
decision making. This will ensure compliance with a wide range of 
relevant legislation, and solving business problems related to staff.
When incorporating KM within the HCM/TM strategy:
– Link KM activities along with learning activities to the employees’ 
developmental goals identified in the performance management process. 
Organizations depend on learning to skill-up not only their employees 
but also their customers and channel partners.

KM in Human Resources and Talent Management ◾ 107
Role-specific knowledge:
– Be intentional on describing each role within your organization with the 
appropriate corresponding set of competencies and a roadmap on the 
skills and demonstrated knowledge to achieve them.
– Understand that someone’s title can be different from the role they are 
performing at that time (i.e., a financial analyst could have a role of a 
manager when they have junior analyst reporting to them).
– Distinguishing between roles are important for system access (role-based 
security).
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques deduced after reading this 
chapter:
 
◾Differences between learning, training, and KM
– It is important to understand the difference between learning, training, 
and KM. These differences are identified here:
• Training is a systematic approach to improving employees’ knowledge, 
skills, and attitudes in order to hone their ability to perform today’s 
job responsibilities. Training is an intervention that is delivered by an 
instructor or facilitator.
• Learning, on the other hand, is the systematic process of prepar-
ing employees and leaders for future responsibilities. Learning is the 
process of acquiring knowledge or skill in the context of organiza-
tional goals by discovering information via tools and mechanisms 
the organization has made available to learners.
• KM is distinguished between learning and training in that it pro-
vides guidance and ac cess to expertise to address immediate situ-
ations where decisions need to be made. Explicit knowledge can 
take the form of (among other things) job aids, knowledge arti-
cles, guidelines, operating procedures, and lessons learned. Tacit 
knowledge access can be facilitated through (among other things) 
communities of practice, collaboration environments, and exper-
tise locators. KM methods and knowledge repositories/knowledge 
bases can supplement and support learning and training events 
when it comes to applying what someone has recently learned or 
been trained in.
 
◾KM needs analysis: A knowledge needs analysis should be conducted to 
understand what skills, knowledge, gaps, and attitudes need to be changed or 

108 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
improved to produce better business results more quickly. A quick assessment 
can be done in four steps:
– Collect existing performance data on the behaviors to be improved.
– Analyze the data isolating knowledge gap areas.
– Identify the causes for the gaps.
– Recommend and implement knowledge solutions to close the gaps.

“Sound the Alarm!”: 
Knowledge Management 
in Emergency and 
Disaster Preparedness
Introduction
During a time of crisis (such as national disasters, pandemics, and acts of terrorism), 
relevant information is usually not received by the individuals or group of individuals 
that need it the most. For instance, many times first responders are not able to respond 
quickly and effectively without the right information during a crisis situation. The lack 
of timely and correct information increases level of confusion, resulting in their 
ineffectiveness that may cause a loss of life.
Our current emergency broadcast systems are ineffective. This ineffectiveness is 
due to the lack of timely accurate and meaningful information delivered to the 
correct recipient during emergencies. This prevents first responders, key leadership, 
and the public from preparing for imminent danger, compromises the ability to 
make informed decisions, and enacts the proper emergency preparedness operations.
There is a problem delivering first responders the appropriate data, information, 
and knowledge in a timely manner to effectively execute during an emergency/
crisis event. So what are the contributing factors? The following table outlines 
the contributing factors related to the lack of available knowledge and the effect on 
what knowledge management (KM) would bring to first responders.

First-Responder KM Strategy
Creating a KM strategy presents a holistic approach to leveraging  knowledge and 
implementing technology to increase the effectiveness of first  responders  (see 
Figure 7.1). The KM strategy reflects several key aspects in delivering

knowledge throughout  an organization. The KM strategy suitable for execution 
by first  responders should align with the National Incident Management System 
(NIMS), which according to NIMS (2008, p. 3)) “provides a consistent nation-
wide template to enable federal, state, tribal, local governments, nongovernmental 
organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to work together to prevent, protect 
against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents, regardless 
of cause, size,  location, or  complexity.” The KM strategy for first responders will 
specifically address disaster preparedness, response, and recovery including the tech-
nology that must be leveraged to support this strategy.
In order for any technology initiative to be successful, it must address a need 
for the organization. The KM strategy will identify the knowledge needs of first 
responders and determine the communication needs between national, state, and 
local entities and their corresponding first-responder organizations (such as Fire, 
police, Emergency Medical Service [EMS], National Guard, and Coast Guard). 
Our preliminary research has determined that establishing a national alert system 
is a high-priority initiative for the Department of Homeland Security. This initial 
system will incorporate the knowledge needs identified in the KM strategy as well 
as technologies that will enable federal, state, and local governments to support first 
responders more effectively and efficiently.
Knowledge Shared, Captured, and Reused
In examining the types of knowledge that must be shared, captured, and available 
for reuse, Nonaka and Takeuchi (as cited by Haggie and Kingston, 2003) have 
 classified knowledge as either tacit or explicit, individual or collective, and have 
identified knowledge processes that transform knowledge from one form to another 
(i.e., socialization: tacit to tacit, externalization: tacit to explicit, combination: 
explicit to explicit, and internalization: explicit to tacit) see Figure 7.2.
In Figure 7.2, socialization refers to the sharing of individual tacit knowledge, and 
this can happen through collaborative methods such as meetings individuals and/
or groups, in person and/or online. Externalization refers to the exchange of tacit 
knowledge to explicit knowledge, which consists of codifying the tacit knowledge into 
stories (best practices, SOPs, and tips and techniques), graphically through designs, 
and/or through the implementation of software (i.e., expert systems or knowledge 
base systems). Internalization refers to learning by doing, taking in explicit knowl-
edge and creating new tacit knowledge. Combination refers to extracting explicit 
knowledge, combining it, and presenting it in a form to incorporate it into the 
organization. This can be in the form of a knowledge base, electronic library, and/or 
knowledge repository. Combination or explicit to explicit is used for transferring best 
practice knowledge (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995).
The Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization (SECI) 
model, as it is commonly referred to, provides the conversion process that transitions 

“Sound the Alarm!” ◾ 113
individual knowledge into corporate or organizational knowledge. This knowledge 
is then leveraged to achieve organizational vision, strategic objectives, and perfor-
mance expectations (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). This model will serve as the basis 
to perform knowledge sharing within the first responders when they are deployed to 
a crisis/emergency event.
 In determining the components of a suitable KM strategy for first respond-
ers, a determination must be made on the way they serve their clients; the types of 
knowledge that must be shared, captured, and available for reuse; and should align 
with the strategic direction of the organization.
The analysis documented in this chapter indicates the way in which first 
responders serve their clients. Besides the factors influencing the selection of a KM 
strategy, as indicated by Haggie and Kingston, this information will also drive the 
formation of a KM strategy for first responders. First responders must have a KM 
strategy that supports the following:
 
◾Quick and decisive decision making, collaborative communication, and situ-
ational analysis (Balogun et al., 2006)
 
◾Acquiring EMS-specific knowledge (Coleman, 2007)
 
◾Knowledge recognition, needs assessment and allocation, and feedback and 
evaluation (Lesson and Sobel, 2007)
 
◾Expertise coordination practices (Faraj and Xiao, 2006)
 
◾Command and control structure (Balogun et al., 2006)
 
◾Learning and knowledge transfer (Balogun et al., 2006)

114 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Quick and Decisive Decision Making
To support quick and decisive decision making, collaborative communication, 
and situational analysis, there has to be an incident command structure that 
disseminates integrated information and knowledge by using real-time commu-
nications (National Incident Management System, 2008). During an emergency, 
firefighters are operating in an atmosphere of panic fear and confusion (Balogun 
et al., 2006) as well as being under pressure to absorb information rapidly, and 
judge its meaning, relevance, and reliability (Carver and Turoff, 2007). This 
information and knowledge of the crisis event is being passed along from indi-
vidual to individual, team to team, and agency to agency. As this communication 
escalates, there is a need to incorporate technology to facilitate the rapid flow of 
information and knowledge that will enable quick and decisive decision making 
and situational analysis.
The KM strategy for first responders will facilitate quick and decisive  decision 
making through the implementation of an incident command  structure and will 
be further supported by integrating the NIMS protocols, procedures, and poli-
cies as indicated by the communications and information management, and 
the  command and management components of NIMS. The communications 
and  information management component will provide common communica-
tions planning and process standardization, whereas the command and manage-
ment  component will provide incident command; multiagency coordination; 
and public information protocols, procedures, and policies in support of the 
KM strategy.
Acquiring EMS Knowledge
EMSs has emerged as an important part of what services Fire Departments and 
first responders provide to the public. As Fire Departments evolve to include EMS.
EMS personnel are being hired within Fire Departments, and these personnel have 
to be trained on how to deliver firefighting tasks, which include confining and 
extinguishing fires, forcible entry, search and rescue, ventilation, salvage and over-
haul, and aerial ladder execution (Baker, 2008). This emergence has also increased 
the need for traditional first responders to acquire EMS knowledge, which includes 
basic to advance life support. In order to facilitate the acquisition of the appro-
priate knowledge for all firefighter personnel, a plan for cross-training within the 
Fire Department to efficiently and effectively deliver its services should be included 
within the KM strategy. The establishment of knowledge transfer activities is 
supported by the NIMS preparedness component, which includes protocols for 
planning, training and exercises, personnel qualifications, and licensure and certifi-
cation, including equipment certification (National Incident Management System, 
2008).

“Sound the Alarm!” ◾ 115
Knowledge Recognition, Needs Assessment 
and Allocation Feedback, and Evaluation
First responders are operating under pressure as well as in an atmosphere of panic 
fear and confusion. During an emergency event, the firefighter first responder has to 
know details about the event as it is happening, what is needed to address the event, 
who needs specific information and knowledge, and what action(s) have to be taken. 
This course of action happens in a continuous cycle and is supported by the details 
within the human computer interface section of the emergency management pro-
cess. In addition, the NIMS protocols, procedures, and policies as indicated by the 
communications and information management, and the command and management 
components support the knowledge recognition, needs assessment and allocation 
feedback, and evaluation mechanisms needed in a KM strategy for first responders.
Expertise Coordination Practices
During an emergency event, knowledge is being exchanged in a rapid nature. 
Expertise coordination will establish the process to enable the management of this 
knowledge and skill interdependencies. Expertise coordination practices (ECP) as 
part of the Fire Department KM strategy for its first responders will support knowl-
edge sharing and expertise vetting during emergency events (Faraj and Xiao, 2006).
The ECP protocols supported by the KM strategy as identified by Faraj and 
Xiao will be as follows:
 
◾Protocols to streamline work and reduce process uncertainty
 
◾Plug-n-play teaming arrangements, which allow for flexibility of personnel
 
◾Communities of Practice (CoP) for operational responsibility and training
 
◾Knowledge externalization to increase knowledge sharing
Expertise coordination activities are supported by the NIMS’s resource management 
component, which includes protocols, procedures, and policies to support the 
facilitation and coordination of resources throughout every phase of the emergency 
event (National Incident Management System, 2008). It also addresses the coor-
dination of knowledge among individuals, teams, and agencies.
Command and Control Structure
Command and control address the management of information and knowledge at the 
tactical level (Balogun et al., 2006). At the tactical level, the KM strategy will address 
functional (tacit) knowledge at the operation level, which includes task planning 
(what tasks to do, when to do, and how to execute the task) (Coleman, 2007), event 
monitoring (monitoring the actions taken and executed during an emergency event) 

116 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
(Coleman, 2007), understanding the time and place of emergency events, location 
and nature of the emergency event, reasoning about the cause and effect of the inci-
dent, and lessons learned (Balogun et al., 2006). Command and control has been 
identified as an integral part of any KM system (Balogun et al., 2006), and the Fire 
Department KM strategy for first responders should establish the protocols, processes, 
and procedures to address command and control. The KM strategy should specifi-
cally establish protocols, processes, and procedures for planning, monitoring, and 
learning; distributed knowledge framework to support teams; and support critical 
decision making (Balogun et al., 2006). The establishment command and control 
activities are supported by the NIMS’s command and management component, 
which includes protocols to support incident command, multiagency coordination, 
and public information (National Incident Management System, 2008).
Learning and Knowledge Transfer
Because information and knowledge of the crisis event is being passed along from 
individual to individual, team to team, and agency to agency, there is a need to 
incorporate policies, procedures, and protocols to facilitate an atmosphere of learning 
and knowledge transfer. The learning and knowledge transfer must not only take place 
between the various factions during an emergency but also between the firefighter 
personnel, traditional firefighters, and EMS personnel. The management and transfer 
of knowledge as identified by Burstein et al. facilitates organizational learning, instills a 
culture of learning that contribute to creativity, and the transfer and reuse of knowledge 
contributes to increasing overall organizational knowledge (Burstein et al., 2004).
They state that organizational learning is the “capacity or process within an organiza-
tion to maintain or improve performance based on experience” (Burstein et al., 2004, 
p. 318). Learning and knowledge transfer will be a key ingredient in the KM strategy 
for Fire Departments and for the first responders they deploy on emergency events.
Types of KM Strategies
Three types of KM strategies, namely Codification (Technological) (Haggie and 
Kingston, 2003; Nicolas, 2004; Smith, 2004), Personalization (Nicolas, 2004; 
Smith, 2004), and Socialization (Nicolas, 2004), as identified in the  literature, 
will be examined further to ascertain the best-suited KM strategy for first responders.
Codification (Technological) KM Strategy
A Codification or Technological KM strategy focuses on collecting tacit and explicit 
knowledge, storing it in a knowledge repository, knowledge base, and/or electronic 
library, and providing it in an explicit codified form (Haggie and Kingston, 2003; 
Nicolas, 2004; Smith, 2004). This strategy is designed to transition individual 

“Sound the Alarm!” ◾ 117
knowledge to organizational knowledge. This type of KM strategy is supported by 
individuals making their tacit knowledge explicit in order for it to be transferred and 
codified. Furthermore, this strategy is associated with the externalization aspects of 
Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI model to transition knowledge from tacit to explicit 
and also includes Nonaka and Takeuchi’s combination aspects of the SECI model to 
transition the explicit knowledge into an electronic format (as mentioned earlier), 
which can be accessed and reused by anyone in the organization.
Personalization KM Strategy
A Personalization KM strategy uses technology to assist in the process of people 
communicating sharing their knowledge (Nicolas, 2004; Smith, 2004). This type 
of KM strategy manages knowledge that is tied to or associated with a person and is 
commonly shared directly via person-to-person contact (Smith, 2004). In addition, 
this KM strategy facilitates and manages knowledge that is centered on learning 
through shared experience (Nicolas, 2004). The technology leveraged in this strat-
egy consist of CoP, Web 2.0 technologies (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn), 
and other knowledge networks and discussion boards, with the objective to trans-
fer, communicate, and exchange knowledge (Nicolas, 2004; Smith, 2004). This 
strategy is associated with the socialization aspects of Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI 
model, which details tacit-to-tacit knowledge exchange.
Socialization KM Strategy
A Socialization KM strategy combines both the Codification or Technological 
KM strategy and the Personalization KM strategy (Nicolas, 2004). This strat-
egy manages knowledge generated by individuals and groups. Nicolas states that 
these groups inhabit the same knowledge space and interact through relationships 
both individual and within and between groups (Nicolas, 2004). This strategy is 
designed to exchange and pool knowledge (Nicolas, 2004). In combining both the 
Codification and the Personalization KM strategies, the Socialization KM strategy 
combines the externalization aspects of Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI model to 
transition knowledge from tacit to explicit; the combination aspects of the SECI 
model to transition explicit to explicit forms of knowledge for electronic storage 
and reuse; and the socialization aspects of Nonaka and Takeuchi’s SECI model, to 
facilitate individual and group tacit to tacit knowledge exchange.
Factors Influencing the Selection of a KM Strategy
Having an understanding of the essential aspects of an effective KM strategy for 
first responders will serve as the building blocks in creating a KM strategy tem-
plate. However, an examination of the factors that may influence these aspects is 

118 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
warranted. These factors could determine what will and will not be included in the 
final KM strategy.
A KM strategy for firefighter first-responder organizations as indicated by 
Haggie and Kingston can be influenced by several factors, such as current/planned 
KM strategy, business sector characteristics, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 
and threats (SWOT), value focus, organizational structure, organizational culture, 
and nature of knowledge (see Table 7.1) (Haggie and Kingston, 2003).
Based on the factors influencing the selection of a KM strategy, Haggie and 
Kingston recommend performing the following activities to identify the appropriate 
KM strategy and initiatives
identifying the business drivers for your organization, performing an 
organizational Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats 
(SWOT) analysis to clearly identify the product and/or service, identify 
the primary organizational value to its market, use findings to identify 
primary KM area(s) to consider, identify knowledge intensive activities, 
prioritize and make an assessment of the high priority activities to be 
addressed by the KM strategy, and perform feasibility checks on the 
proposed KM approach. (Haggie and Kingston, 2003, p. 18)
These influencers will be examined when developing a KM strategy template to be 
adopted by the Fire Department for first responders.

Aligning the KM Strategy with the Business Strategy
Knowledge is viewed as the most valuable resource by an organization. Because 
of the importance of knowledge to the organization, it is viewed as making a dif-
ference in organizational performance. It is my experience more often than not 
knowledge is poorly managed and that in order to capture the benefits of managing 
knowledge, an organizational KM strategy is necessary. It is also my experience that 
a KM strategy must align with the organization’s business strategy to be effective. 
In order to align the firefighter first-responder KM strategy with the overall Fire 
Department business strategy and examination of how to align both strategies must 
take place.
To understand how to align the KM strategy with the business strategy, Ekionea 
and Swain have identified three types of business strategies: defender, prospector, 
and analyzer (Ekionea and Swain, 2008). The defender business strategy does not 
seek new opportunities beyond its competence, seldom carries out major adjust-
ments in business structure or technology, is the most stable of the three business 
strategies, offers high quality products, provides service at an low price, and retains 
customers by improving business processes (Ekionea and Swain, 2008). The pros-
pector business strategy prefers to research without interruption looking for new 
products or market opportunities, serves as change agents, invests in innovation 
through R&D, and seeks flexible technology options (Ekionea and Swain, 2008). 
The analyzer business strategy shares characteristics of the both the defender and 
prospector business strategies as well as seeks to reduce risks, maximize opportuni-
ties for growth and change while improving business performance (Ekionea and 
Swain, 2008).
In addition, Ekionea and Swain (2008) have identified three types of KM 
strategy focus areas of efficiency (improving business efficiency), flexibility (sup-
porting flexibility in business opportunities), and comprehensive (supporting both 
efficiency and flexibility). The characteristics of their KM strategy focus areas align 
with Haggie and Kingston, Nicolas, and Smith’s KM strategies of Codification, 
Personalization, and Socialization. Codification aligns with the efficiency focus 
area through the influence of technology to capture knowledge and improve the 
efficiency of decision making. Personalization aligns with the flexibility focus area 
supporting inter-organizational capabilities and processes. Socialization aligns with 
the comprehensive focus area through its combination of both KM strategies and 
focus areas. Given this alignment, we can extrapolate the KM strategy and busi-
ness strategy alignment based on Ekionea and Swain’s analysis to be Codification/
Efficiency KM strategy aligning knowledge activities with the defender business 
strategy to improve business processes; Personalization/Flexibility KM strategy 
aligning knowledge activities with the prospector business strategy to achieve new 
business opportunities; and Socialization/Comprehensive KM strategy aligning 
knowledge activities with the analyzer business strategy to reduce business risk and 
maximize business growth.

120 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Firefighter First-Responder KM Strategy
The key areas stated earlier that an effective firefighter first-responder KM strategy 
must include quick and decisive decision making, collaborative communication, and 
situational analysis, acquiring EMS-specific knowledge, being able to quickly act to 
change, perform task planning, event monitoring, distribute knowledge, perform 
knowledge recognition, needs assessment and allocation, feedback and evaluation, 
ECP, command and control, and learning and knowledge transfer. The adoption of 
NIMS policies, procedures, and protocols can be adopted to support and guide the 
execution of the KM strategy. Leveraging the NIMS protocols within the KM strat-
egy would provide the basis for all firefighter first-responder organizations to adopt 
a common KM strategy template.
The KM strategy components that correspond to the key areas of an effective 
firefighter first-responder KM strategy include incident command structure, knowl-
edge acquisition, knowledge transfer, knowledge recognition, needs assessment and 
Allocation, KM feedback and evaluation, ECP, and command and control structure. 
The incident command structure will leverage the policies, procedures, and protocols 
established by the NIMS’s communications and information management as well as 
the command and management components. These protocols will facilitate quick 
and decisive decision making, collaborative communication, and situational analysis 
identified as key areas for the firefighter first-responder KM strategy. The knowledge 
acquisition and knowledge transfer (see section on Knowledge Transfer Planning for 
further details) areas of the KM strategy will address the need to acquire EMS-specific 
knowledge and provide cross-training between EMS and standard firefighting per-
sonnel. This area of the KM strategy will leverage the NIMS policy, procedures, and 
protocols identified in the preparedness component. Knowledge recognition, needs 
assessment, and allocation will incorporate the design and execution of a knowledge 
audit (KA) (see section on Knowledge Audit for further details). This area of the KM 
strategy will leverage the NIMS policy, procedures, and protocols identified in the 
communication and information management component.
The KM feedback and evaluation area of the KM strategy will incorporate the 
delivery and execution of an after action review (AAR); see Appendix B, and the 
section on AARs for further details. This area of the KM strategy will leverage the 
NIMS policy, procedures, and protocols identified in the command and manage-
ment component. The ECP area of the KM strategy will address the need to manage 
knowledge and skill interdependencies and support knowledge sharing of personnel 
that are deployed to an emergency/crisis event. This area of the KM strategy will 
leverage the NIMS policy, procedures, and protocols identified in the resource man-
agement component. The command and control structure area of the KM strategy is 
addressing the management of information and knowledge at the tactical level. This 
includes task planning, event monitoring, time/place of emergency events, nature of 
the event, cause and effect of the incident, and lessons learned. This area of the KM 
strategy is also supported by the NIMS policy, procedures, and protocols identified 

“Sound the Alarm!” ◾ 121
in the command and management component, in addition to the execution of 
AARs to capture lessons learned.
Knowledge Transfer Planning
Knowledge transfer planning facilitates an organization’s capability to  encourage 
and allow learning to occur. Essentially, knowledge transfer is a culture-based 
process by which adaptive organizational knowledge that lies in people’s heads 
is exchanged with others. Formal knowledge transfer is another basic process by 
which documents, data, or other types of resources is captured and stored in 
formats and media that allows for retrieval by others when needed. The objective 
of a knowledge transfer is to detail the methods, tools, and activities involved in 
successfully imparting knowledge to the workers of the enterprise.
To foster an atmosphere of knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer within 
an organization, the process of knowledge transfer should include the following:
 
◾Identifying the key knowledge holders within the organization
 
◾Creating an environment that motivates people to share
 
◾Designing a sharing mechanism to facilitate the transfer
 
◾Executing the knowledge transfer plan
 
◾Measuring to ensure the transfer of knowledge
 
◾Applying the knowledge transferred
Knowledge Audit
A is usually conducted as a precursor to introducing a KM strategy (Crilly et al., 2005). 
The KA typically has three components: an examination of the sources of data, infor-
mation, and knowledge that are available, how they are used, and what are the gaps 
that exist, if any (Crilly et al., 2005). A complete KA will examine the key knowledge 
holders and existing knowledge systems, and determine how they support the functions 
and needs of the organization. The KA will examine the knowledge gaps and determine 
whether the intellectual capital exist currently in the organization to fill the gap or if 
new knowledge has to be acquired (Crilly et al., 2005).
Action Plan—After Action Reviews
In order to determine the success of initial KM initiatives, it is important to con-
duct reviews after the completion of each initiative. The use of AAR is an excellent 
tool to accomplish this. An AAR is a facilitated session conducted with a team 
or group after completion of a KM initiative (United States Agency International 

122 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Development [USAID], 2006). The objective of an AAR is to capture the new 
knowledge gained from the execution of the initiative and to have it become part of 
the corporate knowledge culture. Specifically, AARs
 
◾Make learning conscious and explicit.
 
◾Identify valuable lessons that may be helpful to future teams.
 
◾Enhance team openness and cooperation.
 
◾Allow closure at the end of an initiative.
The steps involved in completing/conducting an AAR are described below. This 
information is summarized from the USAID After-Action Review Technical Guide.
 
1. Assemble participants as soon as practicable after the event(s).
 
2. Establish rules and explain objectives.
 
3. Summarize events as they were planned to occur, with work and time  estimates, 
as appropriate.
 
4. Elicit discussion on how the events actually took place. Strategies to make 
this happen include the following:
– Identify mistakes, but don’t assign blame. The focus should be on the 
actions, not on the actors.
– Articulate assumptions (the explicit statement of previously overlooked 
assumptions often leads to better solutions).
– Address objective and subjective dimensions of the events (discussion 
subjects, including attitudes, expectations, fatigue, and stress, may help 
to explain outcomes in addition to more objective information).
 
5. Record results. List the associates who participated, what learning was 
achieved, what changes are planned, and what practices will be strengthened 
(some of the observations of the AAR will need to be shared with higher and 
lower levels of the organization).
 
6. Establish the expectation of AARs as a regular, reoccurring feature of your 
organization’s operations. They should not be considered a sign of failure 
(as a group activity, the AAR can promote group cohesiveness and identity. 
Through repetition, it makes individuals more reflective practitioners).
 
7. The following AAR pitfalls must be avoided:
– Allowing performance critiques
– Lecturing
– Overanalyzing minutiae
– Griping, complaining, and general negativity
– Allowing stronger personalities to dominate the review, keeping others 
from participating
The AAR discussion is a process of discovery, as all team members share their per-
spectives on what happened and why. The shared observations of the newest interns 

“Sound the Alarm!” ◾ 123
through the senior-most associates are essential to piece together how and why 
some objectives were met and others were not (United States Agency International 
Development [USAID], 2006).
Additional KM Strategy Template Elements
In addition, the KM strategy will include an executive summary, KM mission 
 statement, KM vision, KM roles and responsibilities, initial KM initiatives, 
dependencies, and ongoing KM support. The KM mission statement encapsu-
lates the KM mission of the organization and sets the definition of knowledge 
and KM for the organization to follow. The KM vision is specific to the orga-
nization choosing to implement a KM strategy. The KM vision will provide a 
roadmap for integrating the KM strategy with the strategy of the organization 
(Bohmann et  al., 2007). The  firefighter first-responder KM strategy template 
(see Appendix B) is one that can be leveraged by firefighter first-responder orga-
nizations to develop a KM strategy. This template represents the results of the 
research completed in this section.
Conclusion
Knowledge is an organization’s most valuable resource. Although people, process, 
and technology can give an organization a competitive edge, the improper man-
agement of that knowledge to build, organize, and leverage its people, process, and 
technology will be to the detriment of that organization (Smith, 2004).
Constructing a KM strategy for the Fire Department and the first responders 
they deploy must be consistent from station to station, whether the station serves 
urban or rural areas, and the demographics of the community in which it serves. The 
KM strategy must contain elements of, codification, personalization and socializa-
tion. Based on this research and understanding the complexities of the KM strategy 
for Fire Department first responders, a KM strategy that incorporates the key areas 
of quick and decisive decision making, collaborative communication, and situational 
analysis, acquiring EMS-specific knowledge, being able to quickly act to change, 
perform task planning, event monitoring, distribute knowledge, perform knowledge 
recognition, needs assessment and allocation, feedback and evaluation, ECP, com-
mand and control, and learning and knowledge transfer; understanding the types of 
knowledge that must be captured; and the associated NIMS policies, procedures, and 
protocols will be successful.
In addition, the research that contributed to this chapter has uncovered that the 
KM strategy must align with the business strategy of the organization. Although 
the focus of this research is on developing and delivering a KM strategy for Fire 
Departments and the first responders they deploy, an in-depth study of the business 
strategies deployed by Fire Departments are warranted.

124 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Furthermore, the alignment of those business strategies with Fire Department 
KM strategies will facilitate the process of institutionalizing KM, thereby mak-
ing it a part of the culture of the Fire Department and the first responders they 
deploy. This alignment will also provide insight on the methods, technologies, poli-
cies, procedures, and protocols that should be used to provide a holistic strategic 
approach that will bring for the people who deliver services to the various com-
munities, the Fire Department as a business to improve its overall operations 
and increase business value to its communities, and the people of the communities 
who depend on a timely, efficient, and effective service to be delivered by the Fire 
Department no matter where they live or the situation that may arise.
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾A way to mitigate the contributing factors related to the lack of available 
knowledge during an emergency or crisis situation must be taken into 
consideration when developing a KM strategy for first responders.
 
◾All first-responder agencies must implement and operationalize a compre-
hensive KM strategy in order to deliver the right knowledge to the right 
people and in the right way.
 
◾Leveraging the SECI model will provide the basis for sharing knowledge 
during an emergency/crisis situation.
 
◾When developing a KM strategy for first responders, consider the factors that 
influence the selection of a KM strategy as depicted in Table 7.1 (Haggie and 
Kingston, 2003).
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques deduced after reading this chapter:
 
◾As communication escalates during an emergency/crisis, technology must be 
incorporated to facilitate the rapid flow of information and knowledge that 
will enable quick and decisive decision making and situational analysis.
 
◾It is extremely important to conduct AARs upon the conclusion (or periods 
during) and during the execution of KM initiatives. The learning gained 
from these AARs must be reviewed and taken into consideration when other 
KM initiatives are launched to ensure success.
 
◾In order to increase the adoption rate and socialize the KM strategy for first-
responder organizations and the systems that are deployed, examine the 
information presented in Chapter 17.

Happily Ever After: 
Knowledge Management 
in Mergers and 
Acquisitions
During these challenging economic times, many corporations are facing the pros-
pect of merging with other firms to not only survive but also to have a sustainable 
and viable business in the future.
According to a November 2015 CNBC article by Catherine Boyle, mergers and 
acquisitions (M&A) have hit the US$4 trillion mark and could reach record highs. 
Recent mergers include leading microchip maker Intel agreeing to buy Altera in a 
deal worth US$16.7 billion; pharmaceutical giant Pfizer agreeing to buy Hospira in 
a deal worth approximately US$17 billion; and telecommunications giant Charter 
Communications agreeing to merge with Time Warner Cable for US$78.7 billion, 
creating one of the largest cable television and broadband Internet providers in 
existence. In these cases and in all M&A, there is a need to identify the key 
knowledge holders in order to ensure the success of the merger and/or acquisition.
The effect of these mergers will and often leads to a loss of valuable knowledge 
from both sides of the merger/acquisition equation. This loss of knowledge is due to 
positions being consolidated and/or eliminated, other personnel taking early retire-
ment package or other financial incentives. The question is how do we identify who 
the key knowledge holders are and what knowledge do they hold? Also, has it been 
determined that this is viable knowledge to the “new” organization going forward 
and what is our plan to retain, capture, or acquire this knowledge?

126 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
All of these questions can be answered with a comprehensive knowledge man-
agement (KM) strategy that includes a human capital management component, 
geared to identify viable initiatives that will address these questions. One such 
initiative will be to develop a knowledge map of the organization to be acquired. 
A knowledge map is a mechanism used to identify key knowledge and the 
 knowledge holders of the organization. Once these maps are completed, further 
analysis is needed to determine the process, procedures, and initiatives necessary 
to  prioritize, retain, and/or acquire knowledge that may leave. Often, organizational 
knowledge is the reason certain mergers happen. KM is the mechanism to transit 
individual knowledge to corporate knowledge and facilitates its availability for all 
employees.
People are at the core of any merger and acquisition, and these transactions 
thrive and survive on the strength of how corporate cultures and its people can be 
meshed together. Understanding who the critical knowledge holders are and their 
relationships as well as their roles, responsibilities, and work products are all com-
ponents of sound human capital management.
This understanding will lead to determining which positions and personnel per-
form duplicate functions, which will lead to an understanding of the employees that 
should be terminated (better yet receive a package and convinced to leave!). Not 
only do you have to determine which personnel perform duplicate functions, but 
also who is more valuable through his/her experience, education, and importance to 
the organization going forward. The human capital management component of the 
overall KM strategy (see Chapter 6) is also an investment in employee selection and 
development. This contributes to the organization meeting its goals and objectives 
of not only the merger but also for the new organization on an ongoing basis. In 
addition, we must keep in mind that executing a KM strategy with a human capi-
tal management component can be the catalyst to increased adaptability, enhanced 
worker performance, and with the current economic climate, having the ability to 
do more with your existing personnel resources.
M&A: The Basics
The key principle behind buying a company is to create shareholder value over 
and above that of the sum of the two companies. Two companies together are 
more valuable than two separate companies—at least, that’s the reasoning behind 
M&A. This rationale is particularly alluring to companies when times are tough. 
Strong companies will act to buy other companies to create a more competitive, 
cost-efficient company. The companies will come together hoping to gain a greater 
market share or to achieve greater efficiency. Because of these potential benefits, 
target companies will often agree to be purchased when they know they cannot 
survive alone.

Happily Ever After ◾ 127
Horizontal merger: Two companies that are in direct competition and share the 
same product lines and markets.
Vertical merger: A customer and company or a supplier and company. Think of a 
cone supplier merging with an ice cream maker.
Market-extension merger: Two companies that sell the same products in different 
markets.
Product-extension merger: Two companies selling different but related products 
in the same market.
Conglomeration: Two companies that have no common business areas. There 
are two types of mergers that are distinguished by how the merger is 
financed. Each has certain implications for the companies involved and for 
investors:
Purchase merger: As the name suggests, this kind of merger occurs when one 
company purchases another. The purchase is made with cash or through the 
issue of some kind of debt instrument; the sale is taxable. Acquiring compa-
nies often prefer this type of merger, because it can provide them with a tax 
benefit. Acquired assets can be written-up to the actual purchase price, and 
the difference between the book value and the purchase price of the assets can 
depreciate annually, reducing taxes payable by the acquiring company.
Consolidation mergers: With this merger, a brand new company is formed and 
both companies are bought and combined under the new entity. The tax 
terms are the same as those of a purchase merger.
Reverse merger: A reverse merger occurs when a private company that has strong 
prospects and is eager to raise financing buys a publicly listed shell company, 
usually one with no business and limited assets. The private company reverse 
merges into the public company, and together they become an entirely new 
public corporation with tradable shares. Regardless of their category or struc-
ture, all M&A have one common goal: They are all meant to create synergy 
that makes the value of the combined companies greater than the sum of the 
two parts. The success of a merger or acquisition depends on whether this 
synergy is achieved.
Acquisitions
An acquisition may be only slightly different from a merger. In fact, it may be differ-
ent in name only. Like mergers, acquisitions are actions through which companies 
seek economies of scale, efficiencies, and enhanced market visibility. Unlike all merg-
ers, all acquisitions involve one firm purchasing another, and there is no exchange 
of stock or consolidation as a new company. Acquisitions are often amiable, and all 
parties feel satisfied with the deal. Other times, acquisitions are more hostile. In an 
acquisition, as in some of the merger deals we discussed above, a company can buy 

128 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
another company with cash, stock, or a combination of the two. Another possibility, 
which is common in smaller deals, is for one company to acquire all the assets of 
another company. Company X buys all of Company Y’s assets for cash, which means 
that Company Y will have only cash (and debt, if they had debt before). Of course, 
Company Y becomes merely a shell and will eventually liquidate or enter another 
area of business. Another type of acquisition is a reverse merger, a deal that enables a 
private company to get publicly listed in a relatively short time period.
Distinction between M&A
Although they are often uttered in the same breath and used as though they were 
synonymous, the terms “merger” and “acquisition” mean slightly different things. 
When one company takes over another and clearly established itself as the new 
owner, the purchase is called an “acquisition.” From a legal point of view, the target 
company ceases to exist, the buyer “swallows” the business, and the buyer’s stock 
continues to be traded. In the pure sense of the term, a “merger” happens when two 
firms, often of about the same size, agree to go forward as a single new company 
rather than remain separately owned and operated.
This kind of action is more precisely referred to as a “merger of equals.” Both 
companies’ stocks are surrendered and new company stock is issued in its place. 
For example, both Daimler-Benz and Chrysler ceased to exist when the two firms 
merged, and a new company, DaimlerChrysler, was created. In practice, however, 
actual mergers of equals don’t happen very often. Usually, one company will buy 
another and, as part of the deal’s terms, simply allow the acquired firm to proclaim 
that the action is a merger of equals, even if it’s technically an acquisition. Being 
bought out often carries negative connotations; therefore, by describing the deal as 
a merger, deal makers and top managers try to make the takeover more palatable.
A purchase deal will also be called a merger when both CEOs agree that join-
ing together is in the best interest of both of their companies. But when the deal is 
unfriendly—that is, when the target company does not want to be purchased—it is 
always regarded as an acquisition. Whether a purchase is considered a merger or an 
acquisition really depends on whether the purchase is friendly or hostile and how it 
is announced. In other words, the real difference lies in how the purchase is com-
municated to and received by the target company’s board of directors, employees, 
and shareholders.
Determining Synergies
Synergies are the magic force that allows for enhanced cost efficiencies of the new 
business. Synergy takes the form of revenue enhancement and cost savings. By 
merging, the companies hope to benefit from the following:

Happily Ever After ◾ 129
Staff reductions: As every employee knows, mergers tend to mean job losses. 
Consider all the money saved from reducing the number of staff members 
from accounting, marketing, and other departments. Job cuts will also 
include the former CEO, who typically leaves with a compensation package.
Economies of scale: Yes, size matters. Whether it’s purchasing stationary or a new 
corporate IT system, a bigger company placing the orders can save more on 
costs. Mergers also translate into improved purchasing power to buy equip-
ment or office supplies—when placing larger orders, companies have a greater 
ability to negotiate prices with their suppliers.
Acquiring new technology: To stay competitive, companies need to stay on top 
of technological developments and their business applications. By buying a 
smaller company with unique technologies, a large company can maintain or 
develop a competitive edge.
Improved market reach and industry visibility: Companies buy other compa-
nies to reach new markets and grow revenues and earnings. A merger may 
expand two companies’ marketing and distribution, giving them new sales 
opportunities. A merger can also improve a company’s standing in the invest-
ment community: bigger firms often have an easier time raising capital than 
smaller ones.
That said, achieving synergy is easier said than done: It is not automatically realized 
once two companies merge. Sure, there ought to be economies of scale when 
two businesses are combined, but sometimes a merger does just the opposite. 
In many cases, one and one add up to less than two. Sadly, synergy opportuni-
ties may exist only in the minds of the corporate leaders and the deal makers. 
Where there is no value to be created, the CEO and investment bankers—
who have much to gain from a successful M&A deal—will try to create an 
image of enhanced value. The market, however, eventually sees through this 
and penalizes the company by assigning it a discounted share price.
Synergies can also be uncovered among the knowledge held by the organizations 
involved. Understanding who are the key knowledge holders, what they know, and 
the importance of what they know as it pertains to the objectives of the “new” 
organization is critical to the merger/acquisition being a success or not.
The People Side of the M&A
The people side of M&As as pointed out by Dr. Mark Braverman (2007) in 
his research entitled “The Human Side of Due Diligence: Protecting the M&A 
Investment,” which is centered around applying KM principles, practices, and poli-
cies to produce high-performing, highly effective workforce.
Corporate mergers are about more than numbers and market opportunities, 
which is why CEOs need to think about the long-term fit of two corporate cultures 

130 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
as well as the financial and market aspects. Here are four bases to touch on the 
“people side” of M&A due diligence that CEOs should never overlook.
Employees
Employees become naturally fearful when M&A are rumored. Will the employees 
retain their jobs? Even if they do, will it be the kind of jobs that they are used to? They 
are all too aware that the executives exiting from their company, once it is acquired, 
will receive sweetened deals in the forms of settlements, a responsible position in the 
new organization, or a combination of both. But where are employees left?
In the not-for-profit credit union world, it is standard to retain employees for at 
least 2 years after a credit union merger. In some cases, these employees are “tried 
out” in the new organization—and if they do well, they are retained for a long 
term. The key here for both the acquiring and the acquired organizations is to know 
what exactly is going to happen to the employees on both sides of the merger—and 
to be transparent and tell them. At least, one merger was so incredibly “stealth” 
that it took a major lawsuit and several extra years of employee and management 
maliciousness before the organization got through it.
Boards
Who is going to sit on the board after a merger or acquisition completes? Often, the 
acquired organization gets at least one seat on the acquiring company’s board. For 
the CEO, this can be easier said than done. Do you alter your board organization 
to include more seats? How will the votes be distributed? Will all board positions 
be voting positions? Are incumbent board members replaced? Because of potential 
political fallout and a need to retain the highest caliber talent on the board, this 
should be a major political line item in any merger or acquisition evaluation.
Customers and Other Stakeholders
There are those outside of both companies who have been loyal customers and stake-
holders for years. What is going to happen to them once the two companies merge? 
The CMO and CEO should be integrally involved in this area of strategy—because 
you could very well lose customers as a consequence of ineffective “advance messag-
ing” to them on what is going to happen to services, products, retail outlets, and so on.
Operations
Most organizations know how important it is to get IT in on early evaluations for 
potential mergers or acquisitions, because different organizations invariably have dif-
ferent systems, and at some point, these systems must come together. However, it is 
equally important to pay the same amount of attention to daily operations. How similar 

Happily Ever After ◾ 131
are both business and IT governance standards (and work ethics) between the two 
organizations? Are operations in manufacturing, sales, and the back office sufficiently 
similar, so that work processes do not have to be redefined and employees retrained?
Communication
Communication can help employee to manage the merger syndrome, because it 
informs them of the changes in their environment, thus reducing uncertainty and 
ambiguity. Communication is the most valuable commodity for the successful 
implementation of a merger or acquisition. The specific communication objectives 
change for every phase of integration. As the deal moves through its phases, 
information changes and the circle of knowledge grows. Nothing is a secret for 
long, and leaders must be prepared, not only for what they know is coming but also 
for the unexpected. Leaders should follow a phased approach to communication, 
in which planning is sensitive to continuing information flowing from multiple 
organizational levels about the progress of integration. Again, if resources or exper-
tise is lacking, leadership can seek out help.
Information flow in a company is one of the most important aspects of a merger 
that must be understood and consistently adhered to. The trust level in the organiza-
tion must not deteriorate. An environment must be maintained where people feel 
they can be straightforward and share information/knowledge with other colleagues. 
When this environment is compromised, people will often feel that they are afraid 
to disagree with higher management, let alone new management.
Communication is a requirement for financial success, because low morale, high 
turnover, direct costs in workers’ compensation and healthcare expenditures, and 
lowered productivity will all have consequences for the level of return on invest-
ment. Leaders cannot assume they can and will know everything. But they do have 
a responsibility to put into place the structures that will maximize their awareness 
as they go forward. Leaders who confront change effectively are rewarded with 
superior business performance on the part of their employees. When employees 
believe their employer is effectively managing change, it is perceived as a gain for 
shareholders. Conversely, when employees believe their employer is not effectively 
managing change, it is perceived as a loss for shareholders. Avoiding the human 
issues in M&A is essential for success. Proper planning for the management of 
people issues in a merger or acquisition should be a top priority.
Productivity
The potential loss in productivity goes beyond mere wasting of time in worry and 
water cooler talk. After a merger or acquisition, employees who feel uncertain 
about their job security and mistrustful of leadership regarding the sale may be 

132 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
unmotivated and averse to risk. They will not come forward with new ideas, 
communicate with leadership, or be creative. The tendency is to try to maintain a 
low profile and do the minimum, staying “under the radar.”
Planning for those employees who will continue on after the merger or acquisition 
is a key ingredient for success. More often than not, however, this planning is lim-
ited to a narrow fixation on payroll and percentages; a shrinking in the employment 
rolls is often part of the plan, not only in a merger where synergies are expected but 
also in an acquisition as part of the striving for efficiencies. Formulating a retention 
plan, leveraging information uncovered as the result in creating a knowledge map will 
change the typical focus of to a small handful of top people, a few people at the middle 
and lower levels, creating a climate where valuable staff are vulnerable to poaching by 
competitors.
An acquisition or merger can create conditions in which a company is at risk 
for losing those people who may be critical to immediate and longer term business 
success by virtue of their management skills, knowledge of business systems and 
processes, and intellectual capital. This can have consequences, not only downstream 
but also for the transaction itself. Organizations considering mergers or acquisi-
tions should have these “people centric” line items on their M&A checklists—but 
many do not. The political fallout from a corporate move such as this can be major, 
which is why organizations that perform their due diligence with attention to people 
as well as to markets and numbers succeed most often.
Leveraging KM in Company Valuation
Investors in a company who aim to take over another one must determine whether 
the purchase will be beneficial to them. In order to do so, they must ask themselves 
how much the company being acquired is really worth.
Naturally, both sides of an M&A deal will have different ideas about the worth 
of a target company: Its seller will tend to value the company at as high of a price 
as possible, while the buyer will try to get the lowest price that he or she can. There 
are, however, many legitimate ways to value companies. The most common method 
is to look at comparable companies in an industry, but deal makers employ a variety 
of other methods and tools when assessing a target company. Here are just a few 
of them:
 
1. Comparative ratios: The following are two examples of the many comparative 
metrics on which acquiring companies may base their offers:
 
a. Price earnings ratio (P/E ratio): With the use of this ratio, an acquiring 
company makes an offer that is a multiple of the earnings of the target 
company. Looking at the P/E for all the stocks within the same industry 
group will give the acquiring company good guidance for what the tar-
get’s P/E multiple should be.

Happily Ever After ◾ 133
 
b. Enterprise-value-to-sales ratio (EV/sales): With this ratio, the acquiring 
company makes an offer as a multiple of the revenues, again, while being 
aware of the price-to-sales ratio of other companies in the industry.
 
2. Replacement cost: In a few cases, acquisitions are based on the cost of replacing 
the target company. For simplicity’s sake, suppose the value of a company is 
simply the sum of all its equipment and staffing costs. The acquiring company 
can literally order the target to sell at that price, or it will create a competitor 
for the same cost. Naturally, it takes a long time to assemble good management, 
acquire property, and get the right equipment. This method of establishing a 
price certainly wouldn’t make much sense in a service industry where the key 
assets—people and ideas—are hard to value and develop.
 
3. Discounted cash flow (DCF): A key valuation tool in M&A, DCF analysis 
determines a company’s current value according to its estimated future cash 
flows. Forecasted free cash flows (operating profit + depreciation + amorti-
zation of goodwill − capital expenditures − cash taxes − change in working 
capital) are discounted to a present value using the company’s weighted aver-
age costs of capital (WACC). Admittedly, DCF is tricky to get right, but few 
tools can rival this valuation method.
The need to make the most of organizational knowledge—to get as much value 
from it as possible—is greater now than in the past. Companies are finding them-
selves with piles of information within multiple channels, locked away in silos—
different systems, different departments, different geographies, and different data 
types, making it impossible to connect the dots and make sense of critical business 
information. New computing models such as cloud and social business are exacer-
bating organizations’ ability to collect, analyze, and process data. The data is there, 
but it isn’t being harnessed in the right way to increase our collective knowledge. 
And it is our collective organizational knowledge that gives us the edge over our 
competition.
For a potential merger, understanding the value of the organization to be 
acquired is critical to positioning a price that is both equitable and acceptable to 
the acquired company. If your organization is positioning itself to be sold, under-
standing how KM can increase the overall value of the company is essential to 
obtaining a fair price. So, how do we leverage KM to understand the value of the 
organization? One such way is to apply the concepts presented in the knowledge 
value equation (see Figure 8.1) by Mark Clare (2002). This equation aligns with the 
third method/tool used when assessing a company (stated above), which examines 
KM value = F (cost, beneﬁt, and risk)
                  = Total DCF created over life of KM investment
Figure 8.1 Knowledge value equation.

134 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
the use of DCF and presents an equation: KM value = F (cost, benefit, and risk) = 
Total DCF created over life of KM investment. The equation states that the value 
created from managing knowledge is a function of the costs, benefits, and risks of 
the KM investment (project or strategy) in leveraging and protecting the knowl-
edge (Clare, 2002).
An important concept identified in determining the knowledge value equation 
is to build a knowledge value tree (see Figure 8.2). A knowledge value tree makes 
the connection between knowledge and value in an organization more visible by 
understanding the relationship and connection of KM functionality, business 
impact, and financial impact (Clare, 2002). This viability of the value of knowledge 
in the organization can be directly tied back to understanding what competitive 
advantage your organization has in its marketplace, its percentage of that market, 
and the potential to capture additional market share. An examination of corporate 
valuation can be found in the book Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value 
of Companies by McKinsey & Company Inc. This is an important factor when con-
sidering buying an organization as well as if you are positioning your organization 
to be sold.

Knowledge and Economic Value
In a 2013 eBook from the Coveo Corporation entitled “Measuring Return on 
Knowledge in a Big Data World,” it is stated that calculating the return on 
knowledge is not a simple task, and yet it is important that organizational lead-
ers think about increasing return on this critical asset. Better knowledge can lead 
to measurable efficiencies in product development and production. Employees 
use it to make more informed decisions about strategy, competitors, customers, 
distribution channels, and product and service life cycles. However, generally 
accepted accounting principles do not record these assets.
Accounting research is coming up with ways to calculate the total value of a 
company’s intangible assets, and, fortunately, techniques are improving. The Coveo 
Corporation eBook outlined a method to calculate intangible value (CIV). This 
method overcomes the drawbacks of the market-to-book method of valuing intan-
gibles, which simply subtracts a company’s book value from its market value and 
labels the difference. Because it rises and falls with market sentiment, the market-
to-book figure cannot give a fixed value of intellectual capital. CIV, on the other 
hand, examines earnings performance and identifies the assets that produced those 
earnings.
Through the review of the Coveo Corps research, it can be seen that in the 
past quarter century, the market value of companies in the S&P 500 has deviated 
greatly from their book value. This value gap indicates that physical and financial 
accountable assets reflected on a company’s balance sheet comprise less than 20% 
of the true value of the average organization. Intangible book value, or “goodwill,” 
is calculated by subtracting the tangible book value from the market capitalization 
of a given company. Companies report tangible book value per share, number of 
shares outstanding, and market capitalization.
Therefore, intangible book value can also be calculated by subtracting the tan-
gible book value per share multiplied by the number of shares outstanding from 
the market capitalization. For example, as of February 14, 2013, Apple was worth 
US$438.2 billion (otherwise known as its market capitalization). Its book value 
(tangible assets) was valued at US$127.3 billion. Consequently, Apple’s intangible 
assets were worth US$310.9 billion—or 70% of its total value. Using these 
formulas, once return on knowledge is measured, calculated, and managed, a com-
pany is ready to reap the competitive benefits that knowledge brings. Search and 
relevance technology is an important component of this strategy.
Knowledge and Organizational Culture
An organization’s culture evolves from many sources. Culture is manifested in 
policy and procedures, organizational structure, and everyday behaviors, both 
formal and informal. These sources are the originators of knowledge within the 

136 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
organization. Knowledge is the differentiator when it comes to increasing com-
petitive intelligence and creating a competitive advantage. Knowledge can be 
interpreted within and outside of the organization in many ways. Included in this 
interpretation is how knowledge is exchanged between geographically dispersed 
employees, suppliers, and partners. The ability to blend (or align) the culture of the 
companies involved in an M&A transaction is critical to its success. Also critical to 
the success of an M&A transaction is understanding how the knowledge assets of 
different organizations culture will fit together. Contextual intelligence becomes an 
underlying ingredient in combining diverse sources of knowledge during a merger 
and/or acquisition.
Contextual Intelligence
Contextual Intelligence is, according to Matthew Kutz, “a leadership competency 
based on empirical research that integrates concepts of diagnosing context and 
exercising knowledge”; Tarun Khanna (2014) states that “understanding the limits 
of our knowledge is at the heart of contextual intelligence” and Dr. Charles Brown 
(2002) states that “Contextual intelligence is the practical application of knowledge 
and information to real-world situations. This is an external, interactive process 
that involves both adapting to and modifying an environment to accomplish a 
desired goal; as well as recognizing when adaptation is not a viable option. This is 
the ability that is most closely associated with wisdom and practical knowledge.”
Although there are several positions on what contextual intelligence is, Dr. Brown’s 
assertion of contextual intelligence is considered to be precise. When it comes to 
KM and contextual intelligence, context matters! Understanding that contextual 
intelligence is link to our tacit knowledge, I immediately thought about the con-
nection between KM and contextual intelligence. KM among other aspects is con-
cerned with the ability to understand knowledge and adapt that knowledge across a 
variety of environments (cultures) different from the origin of that knowledge.
To enable the flow of knowledge to the right person in the right time and in the 
right context, it is essential to understand the context of that knowledge. Delivering 
knowledge in the right context to users; organizing, structuring, and associating 
relevant content in the right context; understanding how content fits together; and 
connecting questions to answers and people to experts are at the heart of KM.
Understanding the context of knowledge consists of the following:
 
◾Understanding the intent of the knowledge
 
◾Understanding the cultural and environmental influences on the knowledge
 
◾Understanding the role (or who) the knowledge is intended to be used by
 
◾Understanding the relevancy of the knowledge (the knowledge could only be 
valid for a specific period of time)
 
◾Understanding the origin (lineage) of the knowledge

Happily Ever After ◾ 137
Knowledge Mapping
At a time when organizations need to “know what they know” and use that knowl-
edge effectively, the size and geographic reach of many of them, along with the 
proliferation of data, make it especially difficult to locate existing knowledge and 
get it to where it is needed. Knowledge mapping first detailed in Chapter 5 serves 
as the basis for locating knowledge and knowledge holders anywhere it exist in the 
organization. Understanding the key knowledge holders within the organizations 
is essential to knowing who should be terminated and who should continue with 
the “new” organization. In addition, a knowledge map will serve as a tool to unlock 
the knowledge in your organization to enable the proper valuation and importance 
to the organization.
Once you let employees leave, you run the risk of pertinent knowledge leav-
ing with them. The focus of the knowledge mapping effort should center on the 
employees of the organizations involved. The knowledge mapping deliverable will 
be an extension of the people side analysis of the M&A transaction.
Before starting to develop the knowledge map (see Figure 8.3), ensure the inten-
tions are clear. This includes understanding the purpose and scope of the knowledge 
map. The thing to keep in mind is that there is never a single map for every purpose. 
Knowledge mapping is about relationships (people-to-people and people-to-
content), and how these relationships interact within the organization.
To construct the knowledge map, you will go through a process that includes 
interviewing employees to understand how they work, the processes they use, the 
content they access, and the people they interact with. This is done because knowl-
edge is found in processes, relationships, policies, people, documents, conversations, 
and through links to suppliers, competitors, and customers. This information is used

to graphically represent these relationships into a map. However, instead of creating a 
static map, in which several views of the knowledge would need to be created, using of 
software to create an interactive map is ideal. An interactive knowledge map will pro-
vide different perspectives of the relationships and the knowledge each employee has.
Knowledge Profile
A knowledge profile (KP) (see Figure 8.4) records skills, tools, practices, and social 
networks; it highlights competencies, identifies gaps, helps with learning programs 
to address deficits, realizes opportunities, and heightens awareness for the owner 
and colleagues. A KP will provide detailed information about each knowledge 
holder associated in a knowledge map.
KPs may focus on the individual where they form a key part of your personal 
KM system or aimed at a “collective” view of a team, group, community, or firm. 
Profiles may be constructed via manual or automatic means, highly structured, 
or very informal, maintained by the end user or compiled from test batteries and 
questionnaires by expert profilers and competency specialists.
A KP goes beyond determining information needs, guiding information seek-
ing behavior, and considers the adoption and use of tools, the condition and func-
tioning of (personal) social networks, and learning desires. Successful KPs focus on 
the future; they reflect current skills and activities above past positions, awards, and 
educational achievements, providing some indication of where and how the person 
can best contribute to organizational and team goals.
KPs are often a key element in knowledge mapping, knowledge audits, and 
customer relationship management, and play an increasing role in advanced search, 
expertise location, agent-based work assignments, customer selling strategies, and 
portal user-interfaces. Related information is found in yellow pages, expertise direc-
tories, and academic resumes, but the KP is distinguished by a list and evaluation 
of relationships (promotes flow), preferences and proficiencies with communication 
systems/tools, and applicable tacit knowledge strengths.

Why M&A Can Fail?
It’s no secret that plenty of mergers don’t work. Those who advocate mergers will indi-
cate that the merger will cut costs or boost revenues by more than enough to justify 
the price being paid. It’s not as simple as just combining computer systems, merging 
a few departments, eliminating redundant suppliers, and the merged company will 
be more profitable than ever! Historical trends show that roughly two-thirds of large 
mergers will lose value on the stock market. The motivations that drive mergers can 
be flawed and efficiencies from economies of scale may prove elusive.
Most research indicates that M&A activity has an overall success rate of about 
50%. Chief executives of mid-market companies (generally speaking, businesses 
with between US$20 and US$300 million in revenue) should keep those odds in 
mind as deals are offered to them. The consequences of a failed merger or acquisi-
tion are far greater for a mid-market company than for large corporations. Large 
companies usually have enough resources to move on and maintain their business. 
Most mid-market companies lack the finances or bandwidth to absorb a bad deal.
Most transactions look great on paper, but few organizations pay attention to 
the details; that is, how the deal will actually work once all the paperwork is signed. 
This includes thoroughly assessing the culture of your target acquisition, and deter-
mining if it is compatible with your company’s culture; understanding if the deal in 
line with your corporate strategy in order to determine what knowledge is necessary 
for the new company to successfully execute its strategy and identify who the key 
knowledge holders are that support the strategy moving forward.
Meticulously and diligently screening possible M&A deals may increase your 
odds of success. However, consider the odds and remember to pay attention to 
details: Is the deal priced, so that you can afford to put the necessary resources into 
the integration while still having a return on investment? Is the acquisition, along 
with all the costs and risks associated with it, a better choice than all other alterna-
tives? How does the organization retain the key knowledge holders? What are the 
gaps in knowledge the organization needs to fill? How will the gaps in knowledge 
be mitigated? Mid-market CEOs who can’t do the homework will be better off 
reconsidering the transaction all together.
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾Planning for those employees who will continue on after the merger or acqui-
sition is a key ingredient for success. Therefore, when planning employee 
and/or business function consolidation (or elimination), an understanding 
of what knowledge is needed and the key knowledge holders is essential. 
Constructing a knowledge map is useful tool in this analysis.

140 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾Before conducting a knowledge mapping initiative, it is important that 
all employees complete a KP. This will provide the necessary details of the 
employees in order for the knowledge map to accurately reflect the “key” 
knowledge holders of the organization.
 
◾Plenty of mergers don’t work; it’s not as simple as just combining computer 
systems, merging a few departments, eliminating redundant suppliers, and the 
merged company will be more profitable than ever! Yes, do your homework!
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques that are deduced from this chapter:
 
◾Understanding contextual intelligence is an important factor in determining 
how to integrate knowledge between organizations in an M&A transaction.
 
◾If your organization is positioning itself to be sold, understanding how KM 
can increase the overall value of the company is essential to obtain a fair price. 
Leveraging the knowledge value equation will be an essential tool in the valu-
ation process.
 
◾When using the knowledge value equation, build a knowledge value tree. 
A knowledge value tree makes the connection between knowledge and value 
in an organization more visible by understanding the relationship and con-
nection of KM functionality, business impact, and financial impact.
 
◾Another point of emphasis is that when calculating the return on knowledge, 
understand that it is not a simple task, and yet it is important that organiza-
tional leaders think about increasing return on this critical asset.

Knowledge Management 
in Healthcare
Healthcare is a knowledge intensive business. Making the best use of knowledge 
within any healthcare provider organization (hospital, clinic, pharmacy, physician 
private practice, etc.) is essential for optimal patient care as well as cutting and/or 
streamlining costs. Knowledge management (KM) in healthcare is about sharing 
know-how through collaboration and integration of systems to enable access to 
knowledge. Applying knowledge sharing and collaboration to healthcare would 
include sharing medical research, giving visibility to patient decisions, and collab-
oration between physicians and healthcare provider organizations. Collaborative 
work environments will bring more effective communication and more physician 
responsiveness to patients.
Healthcare is also a massive industry, and every healthcare provider organiza-
tion faces challenges where incorporating KM would be beneficial. The processes 
and systems that enable the delivery and management of healthcare services to 
patients are faced with the prospect of failing to prevent (and can indirectly or 
directly cause) suffering and in some cases death to the various patients. It is for 
this reason that KM is attracting much attention from the industry as a whole. 
However, the time has come for the healthcare industry to start implementing KM 
and to begin realizing the benefits that it can provide.

142 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
KM is a particularly complex issue for health organizations. The potential ben-
efits KM implementation could bring are enormous. Some of these benefits include 
better outcomes for patients, cost reduction, enhanced job flexibility, and improved 
responsiveness to patients’ needs and changing lifestyles and expectations and 
ensure more effective communication, leading to focused and (hopefully) seamless 
care interventions and a better patient experience.
In realizing these benefits, it is understood that healthcare delivery is a knowl-
edge-driven process, and KM provides the opportunity to incorporate KM practices 
to improve the various healthcare processes. Bordoloi and Islam (2012, p. 110) have 
indicated that “knowledge management is systematically more complex in health-
care and minimal research exist to guide academic and organizational stakeholders.”
To leverage KM in the appropriate way to address the complex and process 
nature of healthcare, healthcare organizations should adopt a broad strategy to 
capture, communicate, and apply explicit and tacit knowledge throughout the 
healthcare delivery process (see Figure 9.1). This strategy must include a focus on 
knowledge sharing and organizational learning. This type of focus will provide

(codified) evidence-based solutions to the population as a whole, while at the same 
time providing personalized care for individuals. Tringali and Lusigan (2005) pres-
ent a KM model for healthcare (see Figure 9.2) that incorporates knowledge and 
learning as well as a focus on using explicit and tacit knowledge. This model illus-
trates the elements of KM that should be incorporated into a broader healthcare 
KM strategy.
With that focus in mind, this chapter will cover the following areas: healthcare 
delivery process, KM model for healthcare, applying KM to healthcare, construct-
ing healthcare knowledge, KM and healthcare informatics, and knowledge tools 
and techniques for healthcare.
Healthcare Delivery Process
Delivery of healthcare is a complex endeavor. It includes primary organizations for 
healthcare delivery such as healthcare providers having interorganizational rela-
tionships with other players (i.e., Blue Cross/Blue Shield and its member organiza-
tions, physician and hospital affiliations) to provide a foundation. The increasing 
cost of healthcare is putting pressure on access and quality of healthcare delivery, 
and this is calling for increased accountability because of high rates of medical 
errors and globalization, which leads to demands of higher standards of quality.
Furthermore, healthcare delivery is moving away from a physician–patient rela-
tionship to a customer–company relationship, and at the same time the traditional 
single physician–patient relationship is moving toward a situation where healthcare 
is delivered by a team of healthcare professionals wherein each specialize in a single 
aspect of healthcare; however, this is all focused on patient-centered care.
The healthcare delivery process depicted in Figure 9.1  presents a simplistic 
view of each of the major areas (i.e., patient intake, data collection, decision sup-
port, diagnosis and treatment, and patient closeout) of healthcare delivery. Each 
of these areas (depending on medical organization) has more complex processes, 
procedures, and systems that enable them to integrate and function together. The 
following provides more details of each of the areas that comprise the healthcare 
delivery process:
Patient intake process: Because of the increase in patient demand partially caused 
by health reform initiatives that focus on broadening patient access to insur-
ance, many medical practices are experiencing an increase in new patient 
enrollment. Whenever new patients use the services of a hospital or physician 
practice, they must complete forms that list their contact information, medi-
cal history, insurance information, and acknowledgment of various Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations.
The patient intake process is the first opportunity to capture knowledge about 
the patient and his/her condition at the time of arrival at the healthcare

facility. At this point, the patient information is captured, along with method 
of payment, medical history, and current vital condition. All of this data is 
transitioned to the facilities database. This presents an opportunity for the 
data to be shared, an opportunity for information to be processed from the 
data, and knowledge to be acquired from the information.
Data collection: At this point of the process, all the data that was taken during 
the intake process is collected and sent to the healthcare facilities’ database. 
The collection of healthcare data involves a diverse set of public and private 
data collection systems, including health surveys, administrative enrollment 
and billing records, and medical records, used by various entities, including 
hospitals, clinics, physicians, and health plans. This suggests the potential 
of each entity to contribute data, information, and knowledge on patients 
or enrollees. As it stands now, a fragmentation of data flow occurs because 
of these silos of data collection. One way to increase the flow of data, infor-
mation, and knowledge is to integrate them with data from other sources. 
However, it should be noted that a substantial fraction of the U.S. population 
does not have a regular relationship with a provider who integrates their care 
(Beal et al., 2007).
Decision support system: This area of the healthcare delivery process involves 
integrating the clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). The CDSS will 
enable the standardization and sharing of clinical best practices and protocols 
with staff, patients, and partners on demand, anywhere, and on any device. 
Physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals use a CDSS to prepare 
a diagnosis and to review the diagnosis as a means of improving the final 
result. Data mining (which will be examined later in this chapter) is con-
ducted to examine the patient’s medical history in conjunction with relevant 
clinical research. Such analysis will provide the necessary knowledge to help 
predict potential events, which can range from drug interactions to disease 
symptoms. Some physicians may use a combination of a CDSS and their pro-
fessional experience to determine the best course of care for a patient.
There are two main types of CDSSs. One type of CDSS uses a knowledge base 
(expert system), which applies rules to patient data using an inference engine 
and displays the results to the end user. Systems without a knowledge base, on 
the other hand, rely on machine learning to analyze clinical data. The chal-
lenge here is that for a CDSS to be most effective, it must be integrated with 
the healthcare organizations clinical workflow, which is often very complex. 
If a CDSS is a standalone system, it will lack the interoperability needed to 
provide the necessary knowledge for healthcare professionals to determine 
the best course of care for a patient.
However, the sheer number of clinical research and medical trials being pub-
lished on an ongoing basis makes it difficult to incorporate the resulting data 
(Big Data). Additionally, incorporating Big Data into existing systems could 
cause a significant increase in infrastructure and maintenance.

146 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Diagnosis and treatment: Making a diagnosis is a very complex process, which 
includes cognitive tasks that involves both logical reasoning and pattern rec-
ognition. Although the process happens largely at an unconscious level, there 
are two essential steps where knowledge can be captured and applied.
In the first step, the healthcare professional will enumerate the diagnostic 
possibilities and estimate their relative likelihood. Experienced clinicians 
often group the findings into meaningful clusters and summarize in brief 
phrases about the symptom, body location, or the organ system involved 
(Richardson et al., 2002).
In the second step, the healthcare professional would incorporate new data, 
information, and/or knowledge to change the relative probabilities, rule 
out some of the possibilities, and ultimately, choose the most likely diag-
nosis. For each diagnostic possibility, the additional knowledge increases 
or decreases its likelihood (Richardson et al., 2002). At this point, the 
diagnosis and treatment is rendered by the healthcare professional and 
the patient records are updated.
Patient closeout/patient discharge: In the case of a simple patient closeout from a 
routine/scheduled physician visit or simple visit to the local clinic, the patient 
receives medication (if applicable), sets follow-up appointments, if necessary, 
and finalizes payment arrangements and the patient records are updated. 
However, if you have had a hospital stay, the discharge process can be quite 
involving. In the case of a discharge, a set series of tasks must occur prior to 
discharging a patient. These tasks include examination and sign-off by appro-
priate providers and patient education. For each patient, the time of discharge 
and the tasks that need to be performed will be provided 1 day ahead of time. 
This allows for everyone involved in the discharge to self-organize to get the 
work done within the window necessary to meet the scheduled discharge 
time (Institute for Health Improvement, 2015). At the conclusion of the dis-
charge, patients receive information and instructions for continued care and 
follow up; in addition, all patient records should be updated.
KM Model for Healthcare
Before applying the KM model to primary healthcare practices, it is necessary 
to indicate how the elements of the model will be described or measured. The 
KM definitional dimensions are matched with commonly employed KM tools. 
Processes associated with finding information or knowledge include codification, 
identifying lessons learned and best practices, dissemination/imitation, and loss, 
and utilizing technical and socially directed tools to connect individuals with exist-
ing knowledge sources. “Losing” knowledge arises from gaps or misuse of techni-
cal tools, and when people leave. Processes associated with sharing knowledge or 
information include teaching/training and transfer/diffusion. Social tools, such as 

KM in Healthcare ◾ 147
apprenticeship interactions, conversations, and cross-functional teams, prevail over 
more technically oriented ones. Social tools may extend beyond the specific orga-
nizational unit.
Processes and tools associated with developing information or knowledge 
include recombining existing knowledge through categorizing and sorting, as in 
database utilization (combination); internalizing individual’s experiences in the 
form of shared mental models and technical know-how, as in manuals or oral stories 
(internalization); acquiring new mental models and technical skills from others, as 
in interactions with customers and on-the-job training (socialization); and articu-
lating tacit knowledge into more explicit forms of metaphors, analogies, concepts, 
and hypotheses, as in collective reflection and evaluation (externalization) (Nonaka 
and Takeuchi, 1995). This process also implies “unlearning” or relinquishing exist-
ing knowledge to develop new knowledge.
Patient-Centered Approach
Some of the keys to patient care are the ability to evaluate a large amount of data 
and information, which includes the use of medical informatics. These are the keys 
to deliver medical knowledge to the right people, at the right time, in the right con-
text. Electronic health records, data warehouses, laptops, and other mobile devices 
now provide access to information and knowledge at the point of care. This access 
facilitates a continuous learning environment in which lessons learned can provide 
updates to clinical, administrative, and financial processes. Given these advance-
ments, it is imperative that data, information, and knowledge are managed for 
effective healthcare.
An understanding of how patients fit into the evidence-based medical practice is 
critical because patients, more than ever, are equipped with a wealth of tacit knowl-
edge about their health needs. Such tacit knowledge can have a dual connotation on 
healthcare delivery by either promoting or obstructing the acceptance of medical 
expertise based mainly on explicit knowledge and clinical experience. Incorporating 
patients’ needs, values, and expectations rigorously in medical practice has many 
benefits. It holds the potential to deal with inappropriate tacit knowledge that 
patients may have on their health conditions, while at the same time, reinforcing 
appropriate knowledge that can promote their health. Marginalization of patients’ 
tacit knowledge in the evidence-based equation can easily spell the doom for the 
healthcare industry. This is because effective healthcare delivery is based not only 
on rigorous scientific knowledge but also on clinically relevant experience as well 
as patients’ values. Patients’ values take into cognizance the unique preferences, 
concerns, and expectations each patient brings to the clinical encounter. These are 
values that must be integrated into clinical decisions if they are to serve the patient. 
In order to ensure optimal clinical outcomes, therefore, there is the need for an 
effective integration of the three elements espoused by the evidence-based medical 
paradigm—scientific knowledge of doctors, clinical experience, and patients’ values.

148 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Applying principles of KM will/has become the catalyst for quality healthcare 
delivery and management, and these operational elements will provide the mecha-
nisms to execute a broader healthcare KM strategy. In this chapter, the focus will be to 
provide a detailed understanding of the practice of KM within the healthcare industry. 
The content includes critical aspects of healthcare operations, knowledge strategies for 
healthcare operations, essential knowledge elements for healthcare, knowledge map-
ping and medical informatics, knowledge creation and discovery in medical informat-
ics, applying KM to healthcare, and knowledge tools and techniques for healthcare.
Applying KM to Healthcare
A critical function in healthcare organizations and more especially for healthcare 
workers is decision making. In most healthcare organizations, decision making is 
not structured in a way that follows a consistent healthcare model, as presented in 
the healthcare delivery process depicted in Figure 9.1. Not only is it important at 
all times, to ensure that germane knowledge is being extracted during the course 
of delivering healthcare, but it is also essential that KM does provide a sustained 
advantage. This necessitates a long-term rather than a single-focus silo approach 
to capturing, cataloging, using/reusing, and enriching your healthcare knowledge.
Integrated healthcare knowledge that flows between the various areas and sys-
tems within the healthcare delivery process is at the confluence of physical, infor-
mational, and cognitive domains. The backbone of integrated healthcare operations 
is the continuous extraction and flow of germane knowledge and pertinent infor-
mation to all who require it anytime, anywhere throughout the system, so that 
superior decision making can take place.
It is important that as the knowledge flows within and between the areas of the 
healthcare delivery process, a proper conceptualization of knowledge occurs. The 
conceptualization of knowledge within healthcare provides an integrated view of 
various sources of knowledge that permeate through healthcare organizations. It 
can also provide access to the latest medical research knowledge as well as locate 
and identify key areas of knowledge and expertise within the healthcare organiza-
tion. This can mean the difference between life and death, accurate and inaccurate 
diagnosis, and between early intervention and prolonged and costly hospital stays, 
as well as contributing to enabling the delivery and improved patient experience.
Constructing Healthcare Knowledge
Healthcare knowledge is primarily social constructs. For instance, are obesity, 
binge drinking, and heavy smoking health or social issues? Should people with the 
problems listed such as obesity, binge drinking, and heavy smoking receive access 
to treatment as those without these problems? Are the problems listed in question 

KM in Healthcare ◾ 149
1 really problems to be solved by healthcare or simply personal choices of lifestyle 
that individuals must change?
To address this, the healthcare system must influence our institutional logic. 
Institutional logic refers to organizing principles guiding social actions and refers to a set 
of belief systems and associated practices. Through healthcare knowledge- sharing cam-
paigns such as forums; awareness campaigns at local, regional, and national events; and 
by providing pamphlets to patients that detail specific healthcare issues and challenges 
and their solutions, healthcare organizations will begin to increase patient knowledge 
and influence the population to improve lifestyle choices and improve overall healthcare.
Knowledge creation, consumption, and management are essentially social pro-
cesses, which views the construction of knowledge as accomplishing changes that 
are not only technical but are also cognitive and social. This takes a holistic and 
realistic approach to the knowledge construction process.
There is a knowledge discourse upon healthcare services. This discourse is the 
basis on which healthcare services are organized, financed, designed, consumed, 
and evaluated. Through the use of technology, patients are willing to enter into 
dialogs with doctors about their healthcare.
Technology also plays a key role in the delivery of healthcare knowledge to 
the general public. Websites such as WebMD (www.webmd.com), Yahoo Health 
(https://www.yahoo.com/health), and MedicineNet.com (http://www. medicinenet 
.com/script/main/hp.asp) are excellent sources for the medical community to share 
valuable healthcare knowledge to the public.

provides consumers with some of the best and latest health-related content and 

150 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
information available on the Internet. Yahoo Health indicates that it is your ulti-
mate source for healthy-living information and inspiration. This site contains a 
litany of advertisements from various healthcare-related companies to support and 
promote a healthy lifestyle. Please note that Yahoo Health does not provide medical 
advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

doctor-produced (a network of more than 70  U.S. board-certified physicians) 
trusted sources to their online environment. Please note that MedicineNet.com 
does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
Patient-Centered Healthcare Knowledge Constructs
Because healthcare knowledge is no longer a doctor-centered process, and is now a 
patient-centered process, the ideology, cultural, social, institutional, and political 
circumstances have become major influencers on our healthcare, and as patients, it 
influences how we view our healthcare services. Social structure refers to the people 
who are involved in the knowledge construction process as well as the relationship 
between these people. Understanding social structure is critical to understanding 
knowledge construction.
Knowledge is created by social interactions based on values, beliefs, experi-
ences, expectations, and relationships. These social interactions happen between 
consumers, providers, agencies, and sponsors. Consumers, which include patients 
and perspective patients who consume healthcare services; providers, which include 
doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals; agencies, which include govern-
ment and other independent bodies that are granted authority and responsibility 
to evaluate, approve, regulate, and fund healthcare provisions; and sponsors, which 
include general public, taxpayers, and voters who select government officials to 
manage healthcare services on their behalf.
KM and Healthcare Informatics
Healthcare informatics combines the fields of information technology and health to 
develop the systems required to administer the expansion of information, advance-
ment in clinical work flow, and improvement in the security of the healthcare 

KM in Healthcare ◾ 151
system. It involves the integration of information science, computer technology, 
and medicines to collect, organize, and secure information systems and health-
related data.
The design and implementation of an electronic medical record system also 
pose significant epistemological and practical complexities. As we move to integrate 
electronic capture of medical records into the contribution to the quality of care, 
we know that their implementation and deployment into various clinical settings 
has been a challenge. As a result, the extraordinary explosion of medical knowl-
edge, technologies, as well as ground-breaking drugs may vastly improve healthcare 
delivery to consumers, and keeping the information related to these advancements 
organized and accessible is the key.
Health informatics can also yield computational insight in assimilating knowl-
edge from large clinical datasets for both research and policy discussion. The adop-
tion of computerized patient records by healthcare organizations promises to expand 
the sources potential research data to include clinical patient data. Applications of 
health informatics can enhance health services and clinical research, as well as 
improve healthcare quality.
A primary goal of health informatics is to gain expertise in the understanding 
of clinical knowledge and the mapping of this knowledge to alternative taxonomies 
and meta-languages. A computational approach to this clinical knowledge will 
enable the creation of methodologies for aggregating clinical data from disparate 
data storage systems for large analysis.
Knowledge Tools and Techniques for Healthcare
There are key tools and techniques closely related to contemporary KM. Some of 
these techniques use information technology but all rely on an effective human com-
ponent to both enliven and enable them. These include taxonomies and ontologies 
(see Chapter 4 section on Information Architecture), expert systems, data mining, 
text mining, business intelligence and analytics, communities of practices (CoPs), 
and social networks (with the growth social networking sites being of contemporary 
relevance).
KM is centered on people, process, and technology. It leverages processes to 
gather, analyze, organize, and discover knowledge. The following tools are preva-
lent in the delivery of healthcare knowledge and assist in the decision making pro-
cess for improved patient care.
Expert Systems
Expert systems offer benefits in many areas of healthcare. They provide an environ-
ment for experts to develop and test disease models, and this research can provide valu-
able answers to complex health problems. To this end, expert systems for healthcare 

152 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
services are widely used where accuracy of diagnosis and efficiency for various services 
are needed. The cooperation of all parties in the healthcare delivery process is crucial 
in analyzing and managing the data of patients to detect abnormal patterns in order 
to provide an advance treatment; expert systems are an essential tool in providing this 
analysis. Expert systems often take the form of CDSSs. A CDSS is an application that 
analyzes data to help healthcare providers make clinical decisions. It is an adaptation of 
a decision support system commonly used to support business management.
Data Mining
Data mining is used during the knowledge discovery process and aims to ana-
lyze a set of given data or information in order to identify patterns (i.e., decision 
trees, artificial neural networks, and algorithms). Traditional data mining tools 
help companies establish data patterns and trends by using a number of complex 
algorithms and techniques. Some of these tools are installed on the desktop to 
monitor the data and highlight trends, whereas others capture information residing 
outside a database. Most data mining tools are able to handle any data using online 
analytical processing or a similar technology.
Data Mining Tools and Techniques—Dashboards
Dashboards are used to monitor information in a database; dashboards reflect data 
changes and updates onscreen often in the form of a chart or table, enabling the 
user to see how the business is performing. Historical data can also be referenced, 
enabling the user to see where things have changed (e.g., increase in sales from 
the same period last year). This functionality makes dashboards easy to use and 
particularly appealing to healthcare providers who wish to have an overview of the 
patients’ history and changes over time.
The following are the typical steps taken in data mining:
 
1. Develop an understanding of the application
 
a. Relevant prior knowledge
 
b. Determine end user’s goals
 
2. Create target dataset to be used for discovery
 
3. Clean and preprocess the data
 
4. Reduce the number of variables
 
5. Choose the data mining tasks (classification, regression, clustering, etc.)
 
6. Choose the data mining algorithm
 
7. Search for patterns of interest
 
8. Interpret the patterns mined
 
9. Consolidate the knowledge discovered, prepare reports, use/reuse the newly 
created knowledge

KM in Healthcare ◾ 153
 
a. Text gathering: Locating and identifying relevant documents in all forms 
(word, PDF, etc.).
 
b. Text preprocessing: Text preprocessing classically means division of text 
into words or terms and then part-of-speech tagging.
 
c. Data analysis: Many text mining and data mining techniques are appli-
cable here, as this is where the actual information extraction happens. 
The data analysis is very dependent on the preprocessing and the data 
representation model that was chosen in preprocessing.
 
d. Visualization: The simplest is just to make a table for the user to look up 
the information he needs.
 
e. Evaluation: Use one or multiple text mining evaluation techniques.
Text Mining
Data mining and text mining techniques have been applied to different areas of 
biomedicine, ranging from patient record management to clinical diagnosis. Text 
mining aims to extract useful knowledge from textual data or documents. It is 
called text mining because of its ability to mine data from different kinds of text. 
This includes from Microsoft Word and Acrobat PDF documents to simple text 
files. These text mining tools scan content and convert the selected data into a for-
mat that is compatible with the tool’s database, thus providing users with an easy 
and convenient way of accessing data without the need to open different applica-
tions. Scanned content can be unstructured (i.e., information is scattered almost 
randomly across the document, including e-mails, Internet pages, audio, and video 
data) or structured (i.e., the data’s form and purpose is known, such as content 
found in a database). Capturing these inputs can provide healthcare organizations 
with a wealth of information that can be mined to discover trends, patterns, and 
anomalies in the patient’s health history.
Business Intelligence and Analytics
Healthcare business intelligence can provide organizations the ability to use 
their data to improve quality of care, increase financial efficiency and operational 
effectiveness, conduct innovative research, and satisfy regulatory requirements. 
Healthcare organizational data have a wide range of uses. From surgical analytics, 
service line profitability, and quality analysis to claims management, revenue cycle 
management, and utilization, analytics can provide the critical insights in meeting 
the organizations goals and gain competitive advantage.
Business intelligence and analytics combined with decision support systems 
can provide a holistic examination of all of the patients’ data from the combined 
areas of the healthcare delivery process. As hospitals and other healthcare organi-
zations move toward a data-driven healthcare environment, business intelligence 

154 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
and decision support systems will provide the catalyst hospitals are looking for to 
improve healthcare delivery and make improvements on cost reductions.
Communities of Practice
CoPs support collaborative networks of individuals and organizations working 
together to improve their own operations and provide improved patient care. By 
sharing knowledge, concerns, and passions, healthcare providers can use CoPs as 
tools to facilitate the sharing of knowledge throughout the healthcare delivery pro-
cess. The knowledge base of a healthcare organization is the result of many interac-
tions with colleagues and mentors.
Some examples of CoPs in healthcare organizations include clubs, commit-
tees, associations, academies, study groups, coalitions, social network discussion 
threads, medical staffs of local hospitals, and community-oriented primary care 
groups. CoPs can exist in many different forms and professions, but all CoPs share 
three key dimensions: a domain of knowledge, a community, and a shared interest 
or practice.
 
◾Domain of knowledge: In a CoP specific to family medicine, the common 
domain of knowledge among all of its members may be the specialty of fam-
ily medicine, a focus on specific populations, and performance of specific 
procedures or a particular need or interest, such as becoming more competi-
tive with other specialties or physicians.
 
◾Community: People in a CoP share a voluntary commitment to relationship 
building.
 
◾Shared practice: In a shared practice, members develop and share knowledge 
and build expertise by compiling resources, tools, and strategies that support 
future learning for all involved.
Social Networks
Social networks are playing an increasingly prominent role in healthcare. More and 
more physicians are becoming members of social networking sites such as Sermo 
(http://www.sermo.com/). Sermo has been rated the number one social networking 
site for doctors in the United States and globally. Because consumers and clinicians 
are using social networks, healthcare organizations have an opportunity to leverage 
their influence across multiple audiences.
Many social media tools are available for healthcare professionals, including 
social networking platforms, blogs, microblogs, wikis, and media sharing sites. 
They use these tools to improve or enhance professional networking and educa-
tion, organizational promotion, patient care, patient education, and public health 
programs (Chauhan et al., 2012). However, these tools also present potential risks 

KM in Healthcare ◾ 155
to patients and healthcare professionals regarding the distribution of poor quality 
information, damage to professional image, breaches of patient privacy, violation of 
personal–professional boundaries, and licensing or legal issues (Lambert et al., 2012). 
This has caused many healthcare institutions and professional organizations have 
issued guidelines to prevent these risks.
As more consumers are going online for health information and knowledge 
rather than going to see a physician, healthcare professionals have an obligation 
to create educational content to be shared across social media that will help accu-
rately inform consumers about health-related issues. This is extremely important 
because the opinions of others on social media are often trusted but aren’t always 
accurate sources of insights, especially when it comes to a subject as sensitive as 
health.
Top Five Trends in KM for Healthcare 
2016 and Beyond
There will be a focus on empowering consumers, e-health adaptability, and a shift 
to focus on prevention, not just cure! Here are the top five trends for KM as it per-
tains to healthcare for 2016 and beyond!
 
1. Technological advancements
The proliferation of new technology is transforming the entire healthcare 
industry. The two areas of opportunity and concern are wearable technol-
ogy (specifically wearable tracking devices) and data security.
• Wearable tracking devices: It is estimated that nearly 70 million people 
in the United States are using wearable tracking devices to moni-
tor their physical activity, sleep patterns, calorie consumption, and 
much more. This new frontier presents a great deal of potential to 
improve patient care. Only time will tell the impact this trend has on 
improved patient care.
• Data security: Patient privacy issues (including concerns about 
data breaches) will continue to be top-of-mind for providers, pay-
ers, and consumers, especially with ongoing data breaches in the 
news. Providers and payers will need to step up data security to 
avoid the type of HIPAA violations that can negatively impact an 
organization.
 
2. Collaboration between healthcare providers
Owing to the changes in healthcare laws and the strain on healthcare orga-
nizations due to difficult financial climate, it has put a premium on the 
importance of partnerships and collaboration when it comes to providing 
value-based healthcare. This will not be changing anytime soon. This is 
evident by the following recent examples of healthcare partnerships:

156 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
• Trinity Health System joined forces with Heritage Provider Network 
to deliver population health management in select markets through-
out the country.
• Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wisconsin joined forces with 
Aurora Healthcare and its Aurora Accountable Care Network. They 
agreed upon a shared-risk program to support value-based reimburse-
ment payment models.
• Allina Health formed a dozen Citizen Health Action Teams (called 
CHATs) to bring community members together to discuss neighbor-
hood health issues and come up with solutions.
• Henry Ford Health System is seeking ways to “hardwire the safety 
net.” It is pursuing more seamless integration between itself and the 
various navigators and volunteers it deploys to address community 
engagement. The safety net program alone required the participation 
of more than 30 community partners, including competing health 
systems in the Detroit region.
 
3. Patient-centered care
A significant change in the healthcare industry’s approach to providing care is 
underway—putting the patient at the center of care. The goal is to improve 
patient satisfaction scores and engagement. The healthcare industry as a 
whole is starting to look into ways to engage with patients outside of a 
traditional office visit. This includes tapping into social media to build 
relationships with their customers. This will continue to be essential in 
gaining new customers, as patients begin to shop for healthcare online, 
including through social media interactions; this includes searching for 
patient reviews and comparing prices.
 
4. Need for Big Data
Researchers, clinicians, and administrative leaders are leveraging for data to 
develop new drugs, improve patient diagnosis, make decisions, and guide 
their planning. Access to Big Data resources is becoming essential to cre-
ate this competitive advantage. Access to Big Data resources is key to over-
coming the current data challenges. As demands for access to high-quality, 
accurate Big Data sources continue to grow, healthcare organizations will 
want better analytics tools, so they can improve care and reduce costs.
 
5. Population health management
Population health management is a proactive application of strategies and 
interventions to defined cohorts of individuals across the continuum of 
healthcare delivery in an effort to maintain and/or improve the health of 
the individuals within the cohort at the lowest necessary cost. As the risk 
for a population of patients shift based on demographics (age, due to peo-
ple living longer, and the baby boomer population increasing the elderly 
population) health systems need to know more about the patients they 
serve and how to continue to provide improved healthcare services.

KM in Healthcare ◾ 157
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾The patient intake process is the first opportunity to capture knowledge 
about the patient and his/her condition at the time of arrival at the healthcare 
facility.
 
◾The collection of healthcare data involves a diverse set of public and private 
data collection systems, including health surveys, administrative enrollment 
and billing records, and medical records, used by various entities, including 
hospitals, clinics, physicians, and health plans. This suggests the potential of 
each entity to contribute data, information, and knowledge on patients or 
enrollees.
 ◾It is important at all times to ensure that germane knowledge is being extracted 
during the course of delivering healthcare. This necessitates a long-term rather 
than a single-focus silo approach to capturing, cataloging, using/reusing, and 
enriching your healthcare knowledge.
 
◾It is important that as the knowledge flows within and between the areas 
of the healthcare delivery process that a proper conceptualization of knowl-
edge occurs. The conceptualization of knowledge within healthcare provides 
an integrated view of various sources of knowledge that permeate through 
healthcare organizations.
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques deduced after reading this 
chapter:
 
◾In order for a CDSS to be most effective, it must be integrated with the 
healthcare organization’s clinical workflow, which is often very complex.
 
◾To avoid your CDSS missing the necessary interoperability, it must be inte-
grated into the other systems that support your healthcare delivery process. 
Otherwise, it will lack the delivery of knowledge necessary for healthcare 
professionals to determine the best course of care for a patient.
 
◾Be aware that incorporating Big Data into existing CDSS could cause a sig-
nificant increase in infrastructure and maintenance costs.

Chapter 10
“Show Me the Money!”: 
Knowledge Management 
for Financial Services
Financial service enterprises operate in a highly challenged market where consolida-
tion, increasing regulation, and economic realities are negatively impacting their 
ability to achieve key objectives. This has created a culture where there is a constant 
need to find more predictable revenue streams and cost-efficiency gains.
Regulatory bodies such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission (CFTC), and the various international bodies’ present challenges to 
financial service organizations to deliver fair and open products and services while 
providing answers and direction to the various customers interacting with their 
organizations. In order to address these challenges, KM is needed to streamline pro-
cesses and deliver content at the right time, in the right way, and in the right context 
to meet the demand of customers.
In meeting the demand for customers, it is increasingly important for financial 
service organizations to address customer needs. KM through the implementation 
of processes and technology (including information architecture—see Chapter 4) 
will ensure that customer information is shared with the right people at the right 
time across the organization. By utilizing a customer-focused, integrated knowledge 
management system (KMS), all employees interacting with a customer will have 
up-to-date knowledge of that customer’s breadth of relationship and experience 

160 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
with the organization. This will assist the organization with cross-selling, up-
selling, and reporting on the effectiveness of any new customer initiatives.
In addition, the staff must start (if they are not already doing so) working 
together using knowledge as a focal point to service the customer. With this 
emphasis, as more financial products and services become available through 
mobile devices, the ability for those financial companies to respond rapidly to cus-
tomer demands with the right answers, at the right time, and in the right context 
will be met.
Empowering Employees to Satisfy Customers
The objective of KM is to capture knowledge of different stakeholders of the orga-
nization and make it explicitly available to all employees. Sharing of knowledge 
will enable improved and quicker decision making. Employees empowered with 
improved decision making will increase the ability to address customer needs and 
create more satisfied customers. Empowering your employees through KM will 
assist your organization in addressing competition driven by reduced barriers to 
switch companies, the proliferation of products and product commoditization, 
mergers and acquisitions and the ever-changing product portfolios, and shifts in 
customer behaviors.
Financial service organizations (including banks) value KM as a business practice. 
From managing intellectual capital, to the vast array of customer data, one of the 
goals of KM is to enhance customer satisfaction and increase revenue.
Whether the organization is regional or global, a key aspect of your business 
and specifically your KM strategy must be to treat each client as an individual with 
individual needs. By implementing a comprehensive KM program and associated 
processes and systems, a determination as to which customers are most likely to buy 
which products, who is at the risk of leaving, which unprofitable clients are most 
likely to be profitable again, and who is most likely to respond to which marketing 
campaigns based on their demographics, can start to be addressed and the organization 
will have a sustainable model for success!
Firms within this industry are predominantly knowledge based, as are most of 
the industry’s products, processes, and services. The application of KM represents a 
clear opportunity for financial services firms to confront challenges. A KM model 
for financial services (brokerage and banking being the focus here) should contain a 
multilevel approach integrating a resource-based knowledge view of the firm should 
be implemented. This model offers renewed opportunities for financial firms to 
become more efficient and effective in their use of KM.
This chapter focuses on the use of KM within the financial industry. Specifically 
this chapter will present how KM is being leveraged by brokerage companies, 
which include commodity (futures and options) organizations and online trading 
financial companies, as well as banking institutions.

KM for Financial Services ◾ 161
KM Leveraged by Brokerage Companies
Brokerage organizations are constantly evolving, offering new products and services. 
At the same time, product specifications are becoming more stringent and legisla-
tion is tightening around safer operational limits. Additionally, new capabilities of 
information technology (IT) are enabling effective collaboration, even across large 
global organizations. It is now realistic to gather real-time knowledge from operating 
sites and provide meaningful analytics that help users collaborate to make the best 
possible decisions.
In order to keep pace with the new commodity-trading environment, businesses 
need to unlock their business information and intelligence. That means breaking 
up existing data silos and deploying the tools necessary to capture, access, and share 
data, information, and knowledge accurately, efficiently, and in real-time, across 
the organization. A common set of information must be accessible to everyone right 
from the execution of each trade to the shipping, receipt, and delivery of commodi-
ties if applicable, including those responsible for managing credit, market risk, and 
controlling the finances.
Achieving this involves real-time processing and delivery of data, information, 
and knowledge, all the way from the front to back office. That means using highly 
integrated and scalable systems that are capable of seamlessly managing physi-
cal operations, scheduling, financial trading, and corporate compliance issues for 
 multiple commodities that have the analytical, business modeling, and reporting 
tools necessary to support delivering the necessary knowledge to achieve intelligent 
decision making at every step of a trade’s life cycle. To fulfill the promise of delivering 
knowledge throughout the trading cycle and to achieve intelligent decision making, 
a holistic KM framework must be developed. An example of this framework is 
illustrated in Figure 10.1.
The brokerage organization KM framework offers a platform that can facilitate 
the integration of operations, scheduling, and financial trading. This framework 
integrates trading platforms with search capabilities to quickly access trading 
knowledge and make it available on the KM platform. In addition, this framework 
enables the managing and maintaining of data, information and knowledge, access 
to corporate content and a brokerage operation, and retail trading and institutional 
trading view through an integrated business taxonomy structure.
Brokerage Institution KM Model
The brokerage KM model (see Figure 10.2) integrates various business units; 
policies; products; trading content; client; and systems to gather, catalog, store, 
and disseminate knowledge across the enterprise. Brokerage companies, which 
include commodity (futures and options) organizations and online trading firms, 
will leverage KM to capture knowledge to contribute to the products and features 
offered by brokerage companies to its customers.

162 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
This model supports collaboration, communication, improved employee skills, 
better decision making, and increased innovation. In order to respond quickly 
and effectively within the marketplace, brokerage institutions need to create and 
 capture corporate knowledge, rapidly disseminate it, and integrate it with new 
products and services.

KM for Financial Services ◾ 163
The following are the core principles that the brokerage institution KM model 
must support:
 
◾The ability to analyze and synthesize knowledge in order to generate an 
additional value.
 
◾The ability to connect, collect, catalog, store, use/reuse, learn, and create, 
which contributes to growing intelligently reusable knowledge that supports 
product and service innovation.
 
◾The ability to incorporate KM technology to support the brokerage KM 
processes.
 
◾The ability to acquire desired knowledge, by induction of the desired quality 
of talent through all business units (brokerage operations, retail trading, and 
institutional trading).
 
◾The ability to develop, knowledge pool, knowledge repository within the orga-
nization and manage/maintain the knowledge through governance processes.
 
◾The ability to make available the appropriate updated knowledge to employees 
(the users) anytime and anywhere.
KM Leveraged by Banking Institutions
Globalization of financial markets has forced bankers to be knowledge based and 
be more efficient in managing knowledge in their banking operations. Through 
the practices of KM, an organization focuses on the systematic exploitation 
and reuse of knowledge. The firm should identify the organization’s competi-
tive knowledge position in order to define the strategic gaps in its organization’s 
knowledge.
In accounting and finance, knowledge can be categorized as an intangible 
asset, but organizations downplay the importance of their intangible assets. Highly 
competitive business organizations have found out that many types of sources 
 (tangible and intangible) are needed to gain a competitive edge in order to main-
tain competition and superiority in the marketplace. This is shown by an increas-
ing number of firms that give more emphasis to their intangible assets. Managing 
this type of asset (knowledge) through organizing, creating, sharing, and acquisi-
tion between employees, such an organization will enhance its existence in the 
marketplace and probably maintain progress in its banking operations.
The ongoing knowledge sharing and continuous discussions among employees, 
management, and customers will enhance the convergence of a perspective that is 
required for effective partnering. This will enhance such mutual benefits working 
in the direction of creating value for all partners.
The practices of KM in the banking industry will enable these institutions 
to implement appropriate strategies within their financial systems. Expertise 
in the first level of management will leverage the available optimum capacity of 

164 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
their organization, and enhance and reshape their policy in the long term. In ser-
vice industries like banking, the application of KM concepts is not an easy task. 
Although the application of KM does not differ from other industries, the com-
plexity of the banking environment makes KM implementation difficult.
There are eight factors contributing to KM success: technology infrastructure; 
organizational infrastructure; balance of flexibility; ease-of-accessibility to knowledge; 
shared knowledge; knowledge-friendly culture; motivated workers who develop, 
share, and use knowledge (means of knowledge transfer using various IT infrastruc-
ture); and senior management support and commitment.
For many years, banks have been actively automating their manual processes. 
This has resulted in the creation of many information systems. Although these 
information systems were able to help banks to better manage their processes and 
resources, they also have created a number of challenges.
One challenge is to take advantage of the proliferation of data, informa-
tion, and knowledge that has been created as a result of automating the various 
manual processes. In today’s modern banking, data, information, and especially 
 knowledge are treasured assets. Banks have realized the crucial role of KM in 
gaining an edge in this competitive field, but they have been slow adopters of 
KM, usually due to wait-and-see attitude of what will be the true benefits and 
pitfalls from the early adopters. With a greater awareness of the importance 
and success of KM, industry experts from International Data Corporation (IDC)s 
expect KM will become a priority for the banking sector. Apart from large volumes 
of knowledge, the use of IT in  managing knowledge has given KM a new dimen-
sion. Employing the appropriate KM  strategies, IT as an enabler and facilitator 
will be able to carry out and maximize the benefits of KM.
Banking Institution KM Model
The banking KM model (see Figure 10.3) integrates customer relationship man-
agement (CRM) with KM to capture customer-related knowledge to contribute to 
the products and features offered by banks to its customers. This model supports 
the notion that in order to ensure business excellence, a products feature must 
meet the needs of specific customer groups in the market. This is accomplished 
by a target market-oriented customer KM model supported by implementing KM 
technology.
The following are the core principles (similar to brokerage institutions) that the 
banking institution KM model must support:
 
◾Improve the organization’s performance through increased efficiency, pro-
ductivity, quality, and innovation.
 
◾Connect, collect, catalog, store, use/reuse, learn, and create, which contributes 
to growing intelligently reusable knowledge that supports product and service 
innovation.

◾Incorporate customer knowledge into the banking KM process.
 
◾Incorporate KM technology to support the banking KM processes.
 
◾Develop knowledge pool, knowledge repository within the organization and 
manage/maintain the knowledge through governance processes.
 
◾Make available the appropriate updated knowledge to employees (the users)

Increased Sales through Customer Satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is a prime target to make improvements through the 
 implementation of KM. Improved customer satisfaction will lead to increases 
in revenue. This is accomplished through the process of knowledge creation, 
 cataloging, and dispersion. The most common areas of banking that the application 
of KM will affect include risk management, marketing management, and CRM 
and performance measurements. Investments in KMSs such as a decision support 
systems and data mining are making the most impact.
KM in financial services covers the organizations’ intellectual capital to the 
wealth of knowledge collected as a result of customer transactions. Banking per-
sonnel are often required to have knowledge of not only their immediate job but 
the jobs around them. This heightens the need for effective implementation of KM 
(knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer).
Arguments for Knowledge Management
A recent study by the Institute of Financial Services and by JD Powers Financial 
Services Industry Market Research has shown that companies in the financial 
industry are failing to fully realize the benefits of KM. This survey, conducted 
among the top 200 banks and insurance companies, showed that only one-third 
of the companies questioned have KM initiatives in place; in 37% of the cases, 
no individual is responsible for KM; and that only 36% of the companies with 
KM programs have realized and implemented that program within a 2-year 
timeframe.
However, 90% of employees in the financial industry endorse the need for KM, 
and organizations are beginning to focus more and more on the management of 
knowledge. This realization and interest is motivated by the following:
 
◾Processes in the financial industry have become more knowledge intensive.
 
◾Professionals are scarce and lifetime employment does not exist anymore.
 
◾Economic trends necessitate that organizations cut costs dramatically.
 
◾Nontraditional financial industry companies have started to offer financial 
products as well.

KM for Financial Services ◾ 167
Technology
The increasing interest in KM was initially fostered by the IT industry. Technically, 
it is now possible to extract information and knowledge from employees in order to 
share it with others through the use, for example, of knowledge bases/repositories, 
collaboration environments, business intelligence tools, and decision support sys-
tems; tool vendors have positioned themselves as KM solutions providers, offering 
a broad range of KM-supporting tools.
Banking KM Framework
A KM framework positioned to support banks and their various knowledge needs 
must include the following: the ability to support knowledge intensive processes 
across bank functions and departments; bank employee needs for knowledge; the 
consumer needs for knowledge in order to execute self/help capabilities; and 
business needs for bank knowledge as well as suppliers. Figure 10.4 depicts this 
framework on a broad level.

168 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Knowledge-Intensive Processes
Processes have also become more knowledge intensive. Technology vendors such as 
Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM have introduced a new technology to automate/facilitate 
financial process management. In the financial industry, the focus is now on  attracting 
clients with new products and concepts. These products need to be introduced faster 
than the competition can manage, and as such time to market has decreased substantially.
Scarce Talent
Only 10 years ago, people had to apply at dozens of potential employers in the 
hope that they would be invited for a job interview. Presently, when an employer 
does not satisfy an employee’s career demands, the employee has more options to 
move to another organization. It is vital that an employer keeps the knowledge 
worker engaged, by providing an environment in which he or she can evolve and 
is rewarded for the knowledge he or she provides in the organization. People want 
to be rewarded for their added value, which stems from the contribution they can 
make in sharing their knowledge with others.
Cost-Cutting Environments
Organizations in the financial sector have to deal with increasing pressure from 
the outside environment. Financial results are very important; witness the mal-
aise in the financial markets and the disillusion affecting technology and telecom 
businesses. This leads toward a stronger focus on short-term benefits and often 
to large, company-wide cost-cutting programs. KM programs have to respond to 
these trends. The focus should be on sharing best or better practices in order to gain 
more efficiency in a company’s core processes.
Although KM is not new, the development of best practices is needed. The 
success of KM ultimately depends on its users and their enthusiasm and initia-
tive. In practice, user indifference is the most common pitfall. Thus, users need to 
experience an added value in their work and be (formally) rewarded for knowledge 
usage and contributions. At the moment, most employees in the financial industry 
are rewarded for attaining their (financial) targets, and not for sharing valuable 
knowledge. In many cases, KM is viewed to be extra work.
Fear is also a common problem. Some people stick to the paradigm knowledge 
is power and refuse to participate actively and share experiences, ideas, and insights. 
But knowledge kept to oneself quickly becomes useless. Also, many managers fear 
that by sharing their knowledge and encouraging their employees to do so, they 
lose control of the flow of information and thereby their power. Perhaps the rise 
of this type of manager depends heavily on their role in KM activities (as laid out 
in their job description), reward structures, and strong boardroom support. Only 
when you exchange knowledge with others can you be of influence. There is a need 
to accept the fact that sharing of knowledge is power.

KM for Financial Services ◾ 169
Virtual Communities
Virtual communities can be thought of as a digital environment in which people 
gather to exchange knowledge, experiences, and ideas relating to a common inter-
est. Virtual communities have radically changed the nature of traditional ideas of 
communication within groups of people. They overcome time and place barriers 
and synthesize the benefits of the codification (knowledge is made explicit in 
documents, databases, etc.) and personalization (knowledge is shared through a 
person-to-person interaction) approaches to managing knowledge.
Virtual communities are organic by nature; they are born, grown, and eventually 
die. These processes are highly intertwined with and reflect the development of the 
social networks that use the virtual communities. These networks don’t  necessarily 
have to follow organizational structures. In fact, they tend to encompass people from 
different (functional) departments at different echelons, and change in  composition 
over time. A key characteristic of virtual communities is that they mold themselves 
to the dynamics of these social networks. Thus, unlike traditional meetings, they 
don’t impose a rigid structure on the interaction in terms of subject (which topics are 
most important?), participants (who may/can participate?), location (which place is 
convenient for most people?), and time (what time is convenient for most people?).
Benefits of Virtual Communities
The fact that virtual communities tear down organizational time and place barriers 
doesn’t mean that they will be immediately successful. It is equally possible to lose 
money and work in an inefficient manner when these barriers have been removed. 
When starting an initiative, it is important to consider the achievements and goals 
the community needs to fulfill.
Exchanging best or better practices will make employees more aware of  processes 
performed in other parts of the organization. Large financial  conglomerates in par-
ticular can benefit from this. Internationally dispersed managers in the same line of 
business are able to learn from each other, while constant reinvention of the wheel 
is prevented. Incorporating this form of knowledge exchange in their way of doing 
business will lead to more efficient and effective processes and synergy.
An interesting aspect of communities is their ability to combine knowledge in 
organizations across borders, or even with suppliers or customers. Through this 
combination of knowledge, areas of the company can gain new insights into the 
development of products and markets, and in securing new customers. Depending 
on the strategy and position a company is in, it can choose to implement virtual 
communities to cut costs or to develop a new business (or, even better, both).
The benefit of virtual communities lies in their ability to ease the transition 
associated with mergers and acquisitions (see Chapter 8). In the financial industry, 
integration programs do not always result in a stronger organization, and the effects 
of former mergers can still be felt a long way down the line. Old cultures remain and 

170 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
people are often afraid to socialize and break down the barriers between them. By 
bringing these people together, based on their field of expertise and interest, these 
barriers can be overcome. At the same time, knowledge gaps in the new organization 
will be quickly revealed, and the necessary knowledge developed to plug these holes.
Although virtual communities are based on a technological platform, because 
of their organic and social nature, critical success factors are also found in broader 
organizational and cultural dimensions. These dimensions are intimately related 
to each other, resulting in a complex web of interdependent issues. A multidisci-
plinary team is therefore needed, with technical, managerial, and social skills, to 
make successful implementation possible. Special attention should be applied to 
the following sections.
Tool Selection
Implementing the right tool to do the job involves a deep analysis of the expected 
size, usage, and growth of the community to prevent a mismatch between the needed 
and actual tool properties. Also, the tool chosen should be easy to implement on 
the existing IT platform of the organization (dedicated servers, available bandwidth, 
integration with knowledge bases or CRM tools, etc). Heavy involvement from the 
IT department is therefore necessary. In addition, the selection of the desired func-
tionalities of the community, such as e-mail notification of new entries, anonymous 
access, and chat options are also important. A clear understanding of management 
and user expectations and needs is always necessary.
Cultural Dimension
The residing culture (the attitude and atmosphere) should support the transition 
of social to virtual, informal networks. To respect the latent and sometimes fragile 
structure of informal networks, there has to be an environment in which KM initia-
tives are valued and encouraged. Clear management support and a strong manage-
rial vision are therefore keys. If these conditions are satisfied, and the value of KM is 
clear, bottom-up community initiatives with a sufficient social basis will emerge, or 
can be initiated in co-operation with enthusiastic employees.
Key Learnings
The following are key learnings gained from this chapter:
 
◾To realize the full potential of KM at financial institutions, break up existing 
data silos and deploy the tools necessary to capture; access; and share data, 
information, and knowledge accurately, efficiently, and in real-time, across 

KM for Financial Services ◾ 171
the organization. Leveraging a KM framework as depicted in the brokerage 
organization and banking KM frameworks (Figures 10.1 and 10.4) will pro-
vide the basis for implementing the necessary systems.
 
◾In this era of knowledge intensification and global competition, we believe 
virtual communities are excellent enablers of knowledge sharing and cre-
ation, within and between organizations, to the point that they can become 
a key source of competitive advantage in the financial industry. However, 
organizations often fail in successfully implementing KM programs, usually 
due to a failure to integrate them fully with business activities, and the fact 
that KM is seen as an additional chore rather than a core process. A cultural 
change is often necessary to facilitate the implementation of KM and the use 
of virtual communities.
Tips and Techniques
The following are some tips and techniques that can be applied from this chapter:
 
◾A key to successful implementation of KM is to incorporate the principle sup-
ported by both the brokerage institution and banking KM models.
 
◾A key ingredient of delivering knowledge effectively is to establish the core 
principle of connect, collect, catalog, store, use/reuse, learn, and create, which 
contributes to growing intelligently reusable knowledge that supports prod-
uct and service innovation.
 
◾It is important to consider what a community will bring to its users and 
the business as a whole before jumping right in. Try to facilitate bottom-up 
thinking and create a knowledge-sharing atmosphere instead of forcing KM 
solutions upon the organization.
 
◾In your KM offerings, provide self-service options by establishing the ability 
for consumers to access information, get answers, and complete basic tasks 
without your assistance.

“Are You in Good 
Hands?”: Knowledge 
Management in Insurance
Conveying a consistent message to the customer base, which is supported by 
 consistent and up-to-date knowledge, is essential to servicing the needs of both 
customer and customer service representatives (CSRs) (which is an extension of 
your insurance organization). Knowledge management (KM) will play a key role 
in servicing customers and CSRs in a consistent manner. Developing and executing 
processes and communication aimed at capturing, cataloging, and delivering content 
(information and knowledge) are keys to producing positive results. However, we 
must understand that it is the human element of KM, and the positive impact that 
KM has on the efficacy and attitudes of customers, CSRs, and business executives 
that will deliver quantifiable business benefits to insurance companies today.
Specifically, investments in facilitating a knowledge culture can directly 
enhance an insurer’s business performance by improving the experiences of four 
core constituencies: customers, agents, and executives. The primary goal of sustain-
ing business through attracting and retaining more customers has three categories: 
focusing on customers, managing the business effectively, and developing your 
knowledge workers. The following depicts how KM will align with the insurance 
company’s corporate goals and objectives.

174 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Insurance Business Challenges
Knowledge drain: One of the primary challenges being faced by insurance 
companies today is the high turnover of employees, CSRs, brokers, and other 
third-party assessors. When they leave, they take with them the wealth of 
knowledge acquired as a result of their association with the organization. This 
results in lower productivity as the onboarding time for new hires is high.
Lack of structured information: Most insurance companies collect a huge amount 
of content (information and knowledge). Usually this content is collected in 
silos as part of employees’ ongoing activities. This unstructured information 
leads to loss of knowledge, as it is not shared with people who need it.
Diverse markets: The Asian market is very complex, in the sense that each of the 
markets has their own set of business processes. Some are mature whereas 
some are emerging; some are well regulated whereas some are open. A global 
insurance company will have to leverage their knowledge framework to 
streamline processes across the market to achieve operational efficiency.
Lack of a sound knowledge platform: Currently, the industry does not have a robust 
knowledge platform, which can be used to promote a knowledge culture 
within the organization. With the outburst of emerging technology platforms, 
there is a huge opportunity for insurance organizations to apply these and 
build an innovative knowledge framework.
This chapter centers on how insurance companies should be leveraging KM to 
address the needs of customer, call center, underwriting claims, and the knowledge 
workers employed by the insurance company (talent management).
Focusing on Customers
KM through its knowledge processes/architecture, governance, and technical guid-
ance will be the catalyst in delivering a consistent customer experience by delivering 
knowledge and responding to the customer in a consistent voice and message no 
matter where the insurance company engages with the customer (contact centers, 
CSRs, mobile or Web) or with what media (online chat, e-mail, postal service, help 
center, and/or frequently asked questions [FAQs]).
Managing the Business Effectively
KM will enable all key decisions and governance regarding knowledge. This 
includes the capturing, cataloging, storing, availability, and maintenance of all 
knowledge assets. In support of managing the business effectively, KM will man-
age the knowledge assets of the insurance company to:

“Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management in Insurance ◾ 175
 
◾Provide full visibility to knowledge in all areas.
 
◾Capture and disseminate key decisions.
 
◾Synchronize knowledge enterprise-wide.
 
◾Enable collaboration between all knowledge and key knowledge holders.
 
◾Enable common, enterprise-wide knowledge processes.
 
◾Establish holistic governance and taxonomy.
 
◾Form solid foundation to build continuing KM maturity.
Managing knowledge and achieving competitive advantages are the ingredients of 
success for today’s insurance companies. Knowledge has been perceived to be a key 
corporate asset in terms of increasing a firm’s competitiveness, corresponding to 
the organization’s ability to act intelligently to sustain its long-term competitive 
advantages via developing, building, and organizing its knowledge assets. This is 
relevant within insurance companies because the key business consideration of 
managing risk in this industry is through client relationships. Insurance companies 
could achieve competitive advantage if they manage knowledge pertaining to service 
quality and performance.
An organization’s employees are relatively proficient at interpreting knowledge 
within a broader context, which includes combining knowledge with other types of 
information and synthesizing various unstructured forms of knowledge (Davenport 
and Prusak, 2002). The employees in the insurance industry play an important role 
in the business performance, and their cooperation, attitude, and empowerment 
could be important in determining whether their companies are ready for KM 
initiatives or not.
Insurance Call Center
In a call center, customers are assigned to CSRs by routing policies that seek to 
balance several objectives. Usually, these policies follow myopic rules in order 
to minimize the waiting time or maximize the quality experienced by each 
 customer. However, there is a secondary effect of the routing assignment: by 
learning-on-the-job, the development of the CSRs’ expertise depends on the 
calls they take.
A major influence on a customer’s satisfaction at a call center is the knowledge 
level of the CSR who takes their call. KM, in particular maintaining or increasing 
the cumulative knowledge of the CSRs, is therefore a key issue for ensuring service 
quality. This is especially true when the call center operates within dynamic markets, 
and CSRs are required to keep pace with trends and advances.
KM has a number of practical tools and strategies for meeting this challenge, 
and call center managers have much to gain by implementing KM principles.
As indicated in Dimension Data’s 2015 Global Contact Centre Benchmarking 
Report, a call center is confronted with a number of considerable challenges.

176 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
A call center is confronted with a number of considerable challenges:
 
◾Potentially wide range of customer enquiries
 
◾Legal accountability for information provided to customers
 
◾Customers expect “instant” answers to questions
 
◾High-stress work environment for call center operators
 
◾High staff turnover
 
◾Large and complex body of knowledge to be learned by new staff
 
◾Constant pressure to reduce call handling times
 
◾Continuous tracking and assessment of efficiency measures
Inbound centers have an average annual turnover of 26% for full-time representatives 
and 33% for part-timers.
Benefits of KM to Call Centers
In meeting these challenges, KM has the potential to deliver some (or all) of these 
benefits:
 
◾Reduced training time and costs for new staff
 
◾Improved call handling and response times
 
◾Increased staff satisfaction and morale
 
◾Greater consistency and accuracy of information provided to customers
 
◾Greater flexibility in handling changing business processes, products, and 
information
 
◾Fewer calls to second-level support or the help desk
Applying KM to Call Centers
There are two aspects to KM that must be covered in a call center:
 
◾Efficient processes must be put in place to ensure that the right knowledge is 
captured, managed, and kept up-to-date.
 
◾KM systems must be established to support these processes. These IT systems 
are the core of a KM-based call center.
Meeting both these areas will ensure that you have the resources in place to 
support frontline staff, and the processes to maximize their value. However, 
more important than any IT system you may implement is the knowledge 
itself. Identify the knowledge your tier 1 staff and customers require, and accu-
mulate it. Once you have the raw information, shape this into a structured and 

“Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management in Insurance ◾ 177
usable knowledge repository. Only then will you be in a position to deliver a 
complete KM solution.
Spend the necessary time to identify the actual data, information, and knowledge 
requirements of your customers and staff. This will ensure that you get the maximum 
benefit out of building your center’s knowledge resources.
There are a number of practical ways of identifying information needs:
 
◾Talk to both experienced and novice staff, to find out their requirements 
first-hand.
 
◾Conduct an information review of the resources currently available (both 
online and on paper).
 
◾Survey both call center staff and customers (if possible).
 
◾Talk to business and product representatives, to identify the areas they would 
like highlighted to customers.
 
◾Examine the daily activities of frontline staff to identify key information needs.
 
◾Analyze call logs and other statistics to find out areas of customer interest or 
confusion.
 
◾Identify the typical questions and problems addressed by the help desk or 
second-level support.
 
◾Evaluate whether sufficient documentation exists for frontline IT systems.
The end product of these efforts should be a long list of comprehensive call center 
KM requirements. This list must be prioritized and implemented as part of delivering 
the KM system.
Structure Your Knowledge
It is surprising how often businesses spend considerable time and money build-
ing online knowledge bases, only to discover that staff can’t work out how to use 
them.
Effective structure and navigation leveraging sound information architecture 
(IA) principles (see section “Information Architecture” in Chapter 4) is critical to 
the success of a knowledge base. Without this, staff will not be able to find required 
knowledge during the limited duration of a customer’s call.
Take these practical steps:
 
◾Involve staff throughout the design process, to ensure that their needs are 
identified.
 
◾Develop prototypes for new KM systems, and test these with real users.
 
◾Apply IA principles and methods to all information repositories. This will 
determine appropriate groupings, menu items, and navigation.
 
◾Use card sorting to determine structure, to identify any missed categories (see 
section “Card Sorting” in Chapter 4).

178 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Up to a third of any KM project should be spend designing and testing. Without 
this, the risks of developing a solution that does not meet your center’s needs are 
much higher.
Ensure Knowledge Is Accurate and Up-to-Date
Customer queries often relate to recent changes or product releases. The call 
center must therefore be supported by up-to-date knowledge on these areas. This 
is typically done by following a comprehensive knowledge governance process.
Call center operators must also be able to access the knowledge repositories and 
be confident that the knowledge provided is both accurate and current. With a cus-
tomer on the line, there is no time for double-checking against other information 
sources.
If your staff does not trust the KM systems, they will rapidly find other sources, 
such as hand-written notes, or photocopied “cheat sheets.” There are a number of 
practical steps you can take to ensure information accuracy:
 
◾Put in place a permanent team to create and update content.
 
◾Establish communication channels with the sources of new information 
(policy groups, business units, etc.).
 
◾Ensure that updating the call center knowledge base is part of the “sign off” 
requirements for business development.
 
◾Provide a simple mechanism for frontline staff to report errors and omissions
Ensure that your staff is fully trained to use KM systems and processes. Make sure 
they are aware of the full range of information that is available to them.
Knowledge Repository
One such KM system focused on call centers is a knowledge repository. The knowl-
edge repositories in a call center are the primary (or sole) source of information 
provided to your customers. As such, they warrant a substantial amount of effort to 
ensure that they are both useful, and used.
Although this may be considered a large system effort, the payoff justifies the 
benefits that can be realized. A knowledge repository will help to reduce call han-
dling times, and increase the consistency of knowledge provided to customers. Call 
center staffs typically have only a minute to find the information requested by their 
customer. Under this pressure, it is critical that staffs have effective and efficient 
ways of locating answers.
A well-designed search engine is a necessary first step toward meeting this 
goal. Spend time designing and configuring the search engine: It must be simple 

“Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management in Insurance ◾ 179
to use, but still return a useful set of results. A search engine does not deliver 
the complete solution. It is also important to provide staff with structured and 
meaningful browsing and navigation methods. This ranges from ensuring the 
correct items are on the main menu, to creating related links between pages. All 
of this must be supported with comprehensive metadata, such as title, descrip-
tion, and keywords. These combine to increase the effectiveness of both searching 
and browsing.
Integrate Customer Relationship Management 
and KM systems
Customer relationship management (CRM) systems are all about knowing your 
customers, and their needs.
This ties in closely with the operation of your KM systems:
 
◾Demographic information about your customers will allow you to ensure 
that the right information is in your knowledge repository.
 
◾Tracking customer queries is an excellent way of identifying FAQs.
 
◾These FAQs should be easily available from within the CRM, to facilitate 
rapid responses.
 
◾Information in KM systems should be broken down according to customer 
groupings in the CRM software.
 
◾Escalation from the CRM system should be closely tied in with KM 
processes.
 
◾Usage statistics gathered from the knowledge repository provide an indica-
tion of the “hot topics” for customers. This is a valuable source of information 
for CRM activities.
Integrate Help Desk and KM Systems
Most help desks and second-level support teams are equipped with “call logging” 
systems, which track the status of the reported problems and issues. In conjunction 
with this, a repository of common problems and resolutions should be developed. 
(This may already be provided as part of the call logging software.)
This reduces the amount of knowledge the help desk staffs have to “keep in 
their heads” (tacit knowledge). It also helps to ensure that consistent responses are 
provided to frontline staff. This repository is also an excellent source of frontline 
information. Distil the most common problems, write these up as procedures or 
workarounds, and provide them to frontline staff. Such information will reduce 
the number of “simple” calls to the help desk, which eases the workload, and allows 
help desk staff to concentrate on the more difficult cases.

180 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Integrate Interactive Voice Response and KM Systems
Most phone queues are now fronted with an interactive voice response (IVR) 
 system. These may simply direct incoming callers to an appropriate phone queue, or 
provide sophisticated phone transaction systems.
Integrate the IVR with your center’s KM systems:
 
◾Ensure that information provided via the IVR is consistent with the details 
in your information repository.
 
◾Gather detailed breakdowns on the usage of the IVR. This will tell you the 
areas your customers are interested in.
 
◾Document the exact script of the IVR for call center staff. This will assist 
them to manage a clean handover when they answer calls.
IVR systems are normally only the first step in the customers’ interaction with a 
call center, and they must be managed as such. There must be consistency across all 
methods of information delivery.
Customer-Facing Resources
Many call centers now respond to online and e-mail queries, in addition to phone 
calls. With this broadened responsibility, call centers must manage the additional 
workload.
The call center knowledge repository can be used in a number of practical ways:
 
◾Publish a selection of customer questions (FAQs) to the website.
 
◾Ensure online sales and product information are accurate and comprehensive. 
This will reduce the number of calls in these areas.
 
◾Develop “standard responses” to a range of common e-mail or website queries. 
Products even exist that will analyze incoming e-mails, and automatically select 
appropriate responses.
It is important that the information provided to customers is drawn out of the same 
repository used by call center staff (also known as “single sourcing”). In this way, 
duplication is reduced and errors are avoided. Maintenance efforts are similarly 
reduced.
Insurance KM Model
The insurance KM Model (see Figure 11.1) depicts the various stages of knowledge 
and the areas within an insurance organization that must leverage knowledge in 

“Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management in Insurance ◾ 181
order to effectively and efficiently execute their tasks. The following describes each 
element of the insurance KM model:
Connect: This part of the model focuses on determining what knowledge exists, 
where the knowledge is located, and who are the holders or authoritative 
voice(s) for your organization’s knowledge. Executing a content/knowledge 
audit is a method for determining this. This audit focuses on those activities 
that are concerned with understanding what knowledge is needed to support 
all business areas within the insurance organization.
Collect: Once the knowledge has been identified, it must be gathered in one 
central location. If any gaps exist in the knowledge, new knowledge must be 
captured or created. This will be accomplished through leveraging consistent 
guidelines and templates for the specific knowledge being created.
Catalog: This part of the model focuses on categorization and organization of 
knowledge. Designing and constructing a taxonomy to determine the struc-
ture in which the knowledge will be categorized and stored is the major 
 activity in this part of the model. Once this categorization is designed, it will 
be implemented within the specified knowledge repository.
Use/reuse: This part of the model will focus on the ability to find and leverage 
knowledge across the organization. Accessing the knowledge via the identifica-
tion, design, and implementation of filters based on keywords and synonyms 
will be incorporated here.
Enrich: This part of the model focuses on maintainability and sustainability of 
knowledge within the designated repository. The governance plan will be a 
key input into the maintainability and sustainability of all knowledge through 
the continuous review, update, and archiving of outdated knowledge.
Share: This part of the model focuses on incorporating those mechanisms neces-
sary to exchange knowledge between all employees and business areas within 
the insurance organization. This is accomplished by creating environments 
and opportunities to exchange (transfer) knowledge. Once new knowledge 
is gathered, it must then become part of the “corporate knowledge base” and 
follow the continuous flow of the knowledge life cycle as identified in the 
insurance KM model.
Underwriting
Emerging technologies such as discussion databases, document management, 
Internet search capabilities, case-based reasoning, rule-based systems, data mining, 
and neural networks are powerful tools that can improve organizational commu-
nications and decision-making performance. To be effective however, technology 
must be aligned with and support the human and selected management practices 
of the organization.

182 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
KM utilizes these management practices and emerging technologies to  support 
the human art and management science of underwriting. Underwriters are expected 
to analyze and price risks to meet customers’ needs for risk management, while 
containing loss within acceptable levels to assure adequate cash flow and return on 
premium.
Underwriters ask questions, gather information, analyze data, and leverage 
the knowledge and experience of the organization to make decisions. The higher 
the probability or potential size of loss, the more questions, information, data, 
knowledge and experience involved in the underwriting decision-making process.
Technology is used in varying degrees to support the risk assessment and  pricing 
processes within each segment of the insurance industry. The more simple or 
straightforward the decision-making process, the more automated it has become.
The initial underwriting of individual term life insurance, personal auto insurance 
and other standardized commodity products has been largely automated through the 
use of rule-based or risk-scoring technologies. In these situations, underwriting is 
becoming increasingly more of a science that automates the explicit knowledge of the 
frontline professional.
As the probability or size of loss increases, so does the complexity of the 
 decision-making process. The underwriting of group life and health, long-term 
disability, and commercial property and casualty risks require more complex and

situational-based analysis best left to the judgment of the underwriter. KM focuses 
on providing underwriters with the information, data, and tools they need to accu-
rately assess risk and make better and faster decisions. Frontline professionals rely on 
two primary methods for making complex decisions.
First, they try to relate the current case to similar situations they have dealt 
with in the past. For example, a commercial property underwriter evaluating the 
submission of a hotel will rely on his or her previous experience with this class of 
business to begin and conduct the underwriting process. The more experience the 
underwriter has, the more sensitive he or she will be to the cues that help evaluate 
the probability of risk.
With the second method, if the submission, in whole or in part, is unfamil-
iar to anything the underwriter has previously handled, he or she begins to look 
for components of the risk that present problems or issues that can be solved. 
These components act as recognition footholds to support a deeper analysis of 
the account.
In either case, experts tend to ask more questions, use more information, 
and conduct more implicit and explicit analysis than their less experienced 
 counterparts—and they do it in less time as well. KM can help organizations 
 evaluate complex risks through the review of the decision-making processes used 
by expert professionals.
What questions do experts ask? What information and data do they use? What 
analyses do they conduct? What outcomes do they consider? When and how do they 
access and use knowledge and expertise—both within and outside the organization? 
These cognitive tasks determine context and timing for content delivery to support 
the frontline professional.
Once completed, the analysis provides the key business requirements for the 
design, development, and integration of information system capabilities to support 
the frontline underwriter. Finally, KM system solutions need to be easy to use. They 
must integrate relevant mainframe, client-server, and Web technologies, and their 
disparate data types, through a common user interface that supports the capture 
and use of the knowledge and experience of the organization as a normal part of the 
decision-making process.
KM can deliver significant short-term cycle-time and productivity improvements 
through “just-in-time” access and delivery of information, data, analytical tools, and 
knowledge to frontline underwriters.
Claims
Insurance companies often have to validate claim information and enter it manu-
ally before even starting the adjudication process. Delays are constant. Multiple 
priorities must be balanced, including regulatory compliance, fraudulent claim 
detection, invalid claim identification, and customer service. In order to best serve 

184 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
all of these goals at once, processes must be optimized and paired with technology 
designed to support a streamlined claims experience.
We can provide our wealth of domain expertise in insurance, process manage-
ment, and technology to provide your company with the following benefits:
 
◾Reduced claims delays through streamlined processes
 
◾Fewer claims errors
 
◾Improved communication and access to information about claim status for 
higher customer satisfaction
 
◾Reduced operational costs through process improvements and automated 
decision making
 
◾Enhanced compliance with regulations such as Sarbanes–Oxley Act, Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the PATRIOT Act
 
◾Better fraud detection through advanced identification and analysis of abnor-
mal patterns
 
◾Decreased erroneous claims payments
 ◾Reduced paper processes (and associated duplication and inefficient use of labor)
Big Data. Big Data. Big Data. Yeah … so what? What does Big Data have to do 
with insurers? Just think about it. You sift and search and sort an incredible amount 
of data—adjusters’ hand-written notes, data from fraud lists and the information 
from claims management systems, and the National Insurance Crime Bureau 
(NICB) claims database. Are you getting the most from that data?
With so many claims to handle, your adjusters don’t have time to sift through 
all of that data to evaluate each claim. But they may not make the best decision if 
they miss a valuable piece of information. That means many of their decisions are 
based on experience, gut feeling and the limited information that is readily at hand.
For this reason—and many others—Big Data analytics is playing an increasingly 
important role in the insurance business. Working alongside adjusters, analytics can 
flag claims for closer inspection, priority handling, and more. Here are six areas 
where analytics can make a big difference:
Fraud: One out of 10 insurance claims is fraudulent. How do you spot those 
before a hefty payout is made? Most fraud solutions on the market today are 
rules-based. Unfortunately, it is too easy for fraudsters to manipulate and get 
around the rules. Predictive analysis, on the other hand, uses a combination 
of rules, modeling, text mining, database searches, and exception reporting 
to identify fraud sooner and more effectively at each stage of the claims cycle.
Subrogation: Opportunities for subrogation often get lost in the sheer volume of 
data—most of it in the form of police records, adjuster notes, and medical 
records. Text analytics searches through this unstructured data to find phrases 
that typically indicate a subrogation case. By pinpointing subrogation oppor-
tunities earlier, you can maximize loss recovery while reducing loss expenses.

“Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management in Insurance ◾ 185
Settlement: To lower costs and ensure fairness, insurers often implement fast-track 
processes that settle claims instantly. But settling a claim on-the-fly can be costly 
if you overpay. Any insurer who has seen a rash of home payments in an area hit 
by natural disaster knows how that works. By analyzing claims and claim histo-
ries, you can optimize the limits for instant payouts. Analytics can also shorten 
claims cycle times for higher customer satisfaction and reduced labor costs. It also 
ensures significant savings on things such as rental cars for auto repair claims.
Loss reserve: When a claim is first reported, it is nearly impossible to predict its 
size and duration. But accurate loss reserving and claims forecasting is essen-
tial, especially in long-tail claims such as liability and workers’ compensation. 
Analytics can more accurately calculate loss reserve by comparing a loss with 
similar claims. Then, whenever the claims data is updated, analytics can reassess 
the loss reserve, so you understand exactly how much money you need on hand 
to meet future claims.
Activity: It makes sense to put your more experienced adjusters on the most com-
plex claims. But claims are usually assigned based on limited data—resulting 
in high reassignment rates that effect claim duration, settlement amounts, 
and ultimately, the customer experience. Data mining techniques cluster and 
group loss characteristics to score, prioritize, and assign claims to the most 
appropriate adjuster based on experience and loss type. In some cases, claims 
can even be automatically adjudicated and settled.
Litigation: A significant portion of a company’s loss adjustment expense ratio 
goes to defending disputed claims. Insurers can use analytics to calculate a 
litigation propensity score to determine which claims are more likely to result 
in litigation. You can then assign those claims to more senior adjusters who 
are more likely to be able to settle the claims sooner and for a lower amount.
Why make analytics a part of your claims processing? As insurance becomes a 
commodity, it becomes more important for carriers to differentiate themselves. 
Adding analytics to the claims life cycle can deliver a measurable ROI with cost 
savings. Just a 1% improvement in the loss ratio for a $1 billion insurer is worth 
more than $7 million on the bottom line.
Developing Your Knowledge Workers
Both public and private sector organizations are struggling with knowledge loss 
resulting from employee turnover. Moreover, costs of recruiting, of lost productiv-
ity, and training to replace employees can reach huge values. Capturing knowledge 
inside an organization seems to be one of the main purposes of a KM professional. 
In the insurance industry, trade secrets, confidential information, and valuable ideas 
are part of the workforce knowledge. Recruiting, selecting, training, and managing 
insurance CSRs constitute a real challenge for insurance companies all over the 

186 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
world, and a sensitive ethics-related issue is the case of insurance CSRs leaving their 
employer, in order to transfer to a competitor insurance company, while trying to 
take along as many clients as possible from the old employer.
KM will provide the mechanisms, policies, procedures, and governance to facil-
itate associate collaboration, knowledge sharing (lunch-n-learn, knowledge café, 
and communities of practice), knowledge transfer, associate enrichment through 
focus training and learning (instructor lead, workshops, web or computer based). 
KM will provide the strategy and processes to capture and disseminate tacit and 
explicit knowledge from employees to be shared across the organization, which will 
support organizational learning and evolve the company and its associates into a 
lifelong learning community and organization.
Talent Management
The focus here is about addressing the specific needs of the insurance company 
employee. In Chapter 6, a broader perspective on talent management was detailed. 
Talent management must address the business costs and the impact of employee 
turnover. Employee turnover can be grouped in four main categories:
 
◾Costs due to a person leaving (other employees must fill in for the person leav-
ing; the lost productivity of the employee; the cost of training the company 
has provided; the cost of lost knowledge, skills, and contacts; and the cost of 
lost customers the departing employee is taking with him).
 
◾Hiring costs (costs associated with identifying, recruiting, selecting, and hir-
ing a replacement, such as advertising, Internet posting, costs in terms of 
time spent arranging the interviews, or calling references). These costs also 
translate into lost productivity.
 
◾Training costs (the replacement person’s orientation, product knowledge, 
industry knowledge, and on the job training).
 
◾Lost productivity costs (the new employee will go through a few stages before 
becoming fully productive; his supervisor will spend time guiding him or her 
and correcting his or her potential mistakes).
 
◾Given that companies are increasingly gaining competitive advantages from 
intellectual assets rather than physical assets, organizations that do not imple-
ment effective knowledge capturing strategies will face difficulties.
Role of Technology
The role of technology as it pertains to KM is that of a facilitator and enabler. 
Technology enables the capture, catalog, and dissemination of knowledge to occur. 
Technology facilitates the use/reuse of knowledge assets across the organization. 

“Are You in Good Hands?”: Knowledge Management in Insurance ◾ 187
This is true for all organizations, including insurance companies, when leveraging 
KM. The following provides awareness into a few technology platforms that help 
insurance organizations achieve knowledge creation, storage distribution and most 
importantly, knowledge application.
Content management and IA: Enterprise Content Management (ECM) and tools 
are used to capture, categorize, save, and supply relevant content related to 
organizational processes. ECM/IA tools are also needed to automate processes 
involving workflows, document management, along with taxonomy and meta-
data management. The content and collaboration strategies would remain inef-
fective in the absence of a good content management system. Thus, ECM/
IA should be seen as a foundation to KM rather than an enabler. ECM/IA 
solutions will lead to higher process efficiency in areas such as new business, 
underwriting, and claims.
Collaboration: Essentially, KM is a collaborative effort. An assortment of 
collaboration technologies such as cloud and SharePoint can be used to 
support KM practices in insurance organizations. They allow people to send 
secure emails, share artifacts, participate in discussions, blog, web conference, 
and perform secure instant messaging, thereby supporting collective learning. 
A typical example would be a CSR collaboration platform, which would allow 
CSRs to collaborate more easily with all the stakeholders. Mobile technologies 
and social media have also seen unprecedented reach, adoption, and impact. 
Social media can help insurers promote collaboration among CSRs, brokers, 
and customers, while mobility could empower CSRs with information 
anytime, anywhere, and on any device.
E-learning: In national, global, and/or multicultural insurance organizations, 
there is a huge amount of information present across multiple locations and 
languages. There is a need for on-the-job training to enhance knowledge and 
skill bases, thereby avoiding re-inventing the wheel. E-learning platforms 
are proving to be a reliable solution to this. These platforms could be used 
by insurance brokers to enhance their knowledge and skills. Through such 
courses, insurance organizations can develop a cost-effective way to onboard 
qualified/certified CSRs in their field force. E-learning platforms are also 
being extensively used to render “application—knowledge transfer applica-
tions” to business users using the IT application.
Insurance Knowledge Management Systems Framework
The insurance knowledge management systems (IKMS) framework (see Figure 11.2 
depicts the majority of the areas in which knowledge has to be enabled and/or 
facilitated within an insurance organization. The following describes each element 
of the IKMS framework:

188 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Customer service self-help: Establish FAQs, knowledge articles, and other self-help 
content in order for customers to solve issues without needing customer ser-
vice assistance. Providing answers to questions efficiently, effectively, and in a 
consistent manner is the main purpose here. This is accomplished by providing 
standardized internal processes and knowledge results for faster resolution.
Contact center KM systems: Establish a contact center-centric KM system that 
delivers consumable knowledge that can be communicated to customers suc-
cinctly over the phone, chat, and/or e-mail. The type of knowledge will consist 
of primarily knowledge articles, procedures, and job-aids. Specific escalation 
from first-level support through third-level support should also be established.
Agency KM systems: Provides CSRs and CSR office staffs with the necessary 
knowledge to enable the ability to educate and consult with customers in 
order to facilitate the transaction of purchasing insurance products. This 
environment will also provide the ability to point out appropriate coverage 
and gaps therein as well.
Underwriting KM Systems
The underwriting KM functionality will provide the underwriter with the following:
 
◾Risk selection: Enable the underwriter to decide whether to accept a particular 
risk or not. It involves securing factual information from the applicant, evalu-
ating that information, and deciding on a course of action.

◾Classification and rating: Enable the underwriter to classify and rate the pol-
icy. Several tentative classifications are usually assigned before a final decision 
on classifying the risk is reached. Insurers may have their own classification 
and rating system, or they may obtain a system from a rating bureau.
 
◾Policy forms: The underwriter will leverage the necessary knowledge to  determine 
the acceptability of an applicant and assigning the proper  classification and 
rating; the underwriter is ready to issue an insurance policy. The underwriter 
functionality of the KM system will assist in identifying the different types of 
policies available as well as recommending modifications to fit the needs of the 
applicant.
 
◾Retention and reinsurance: The underwriting function of the KM system will 
enable the underwriter to protect the company from undue financial strain 
by retaining only a certain portion of the risk and securing reinsurance for 
the remainder of the risk.
Claims KM Systems
The claims KM functionality will provide the following:
Settling claims: Settling insurance claims is just one aspect of the claims manage-
ment process. The claims KM functionality will provide the necessary knowledge to 
the claims processors to timely process a claim by
 
◾Detecting fraud: Claims KM functionality will provide underwriting 
guidelines, examine payment history, and evaluate trends in claim payoffs 
to help insurance companies detect fraud.
 
◾Lowering costs: Claims KM functionality will provide improved efficiency by 
decreasing the number of claim errors, detecting fraud early, and reducing 
the time it takes to process and settle a claim.
 
◾Avoiding litigation: Claims KM functionality will provide knowledge to 
quickly settle a claim and avoid the chances for litigation and provide accurate 
liability assessment.
Sales and Marketing
KM for sales and marketing will provide improved operational efficiency by 
 reducing time to market for new product launching; more effectively enhance insur-
ance products by modifying and/or adding new features; target specific  customers/
markets with campaigns that are effective and more likely to increase revenue; make 
specific sales and marketing data, information and knowledge available that includes 
historical data and processes to make accurate forecasts.

190 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
CRM System
Integration of your KM system with your organizations CRM system will enable 
knowledge about customers to be directly tied to specific customer data. This 
integration will improve services for customers; prioritize customers using their 
purchase history, which allows a company to delineate which customers are most 
important and target most of their efforts toward; and see and know the customer’s 
complete history, which will enable employees to review customer history and allow 
them to analyze customer activity that will aid in selling more product or service 
to that customer.
Collaboration
Collaboration is a key benefit of any KM system. Integration with your orga-
nization’s collaboration tools/environment with social media will empower 
your organization to tap into the voice of the customer. This integration will 
enable your organization to establish a better relationship with your customer by 
responding quickly to issues, and to launch products and services that tie directly 
to customer needs and being proactive about sharing pertinent news about your 
organization.
E-Learning
Integration of your KM system with your organization’s e-learning platform will 
address specific knowledge gaps your employees are experiencing and tie them 
directly to training and learning opportunities that will fill those gaps. The  e-learning 
platform integrated with KM will improve training event management (i.e., 
scheduling and tracking), skills and competencies management, skill gap analysis, 
and delivering of an individual development plan.
Content Management/IA
Integration of your KM system with your organization’s content management sys-
tem powered by IA will provide all content (information and knowledge) with a 
consistent organization structure, labeling, descriptive elements (metadata), and 
consistent (improved) search experience.

Key Learnings
The following are key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾Experience has shown that the use of a KM system is maximized by incor-
porating it into the initial training provided to the new staff. In this way, it 
becomes the “default” way of resolving problems, and finding answers. (For 
further information on KM adoption, refer to Chapter 17.)
Take these practical steps to ensure information accuracy:
 
◾Establish a permanent team to create and update content.
 
◾Establish communication channels with the sources of new information 
(policy groups, business units, etc.).
 
◾Ensure that updating the call center knowledgebase is part of the “sign off” 
requirements for business development.
 
◾Provide a simple mechanism for frontline staff to report errors and omissions.
 
◾IVR systems are normally only the first step in the customers’ interaction with 
a call center, and they must be managed as such. All call center interaction with 
the customer must be consistent across all methods of information delivery.
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques that are deduced from this chapter:
 
◾Up to a third of any KM project should be spent designing and testing. 
Without this, the risks of developing a solution that does not meet your call 
center’s needs are much higher.
 
◾Once you have the raw information, shape this into a structured and usable 
knowledge repository. But remember that your organization is legally 
accountable for every piece of information provided to customers.
 
◾It is important that the information provided to customers is drawn out of the 
same repository used by call center staff (also known as “single sourcing”). In 
this way, duplication is reduced, and errors avoided. Maintenance efforts are 
similarly reduced.

Chapter 12
“Sign Right Here!”: 
Knowledge Management 
in the Legal Profession
Knowledge management (KM) is becoming more prevalent within law firms as well 
as legal departments, as the practice of KM has become more mature. KM policies, 
procedures, techniques, and technologies have been proven in other industries to the 
point where legal entities are taking notice. As with all applications of KM in other 
industries, KM in law firms will vary from firm to firm and from lawyer to lawyer. 
This chapter will focus on KM in the management of law firms and legal practitio-
ners, specifically in the following areas: training lawyers (talent management), legal 
project management (LPM), legal research, precedent/case law, client support, com-
petitive intelligence (CI), and governance of law firm knowledge assets.
In March 2012, I discussed in a blog post that KM in law firms centers on 
client relationships and understanding the clients’ legal needs. These needs can 
range from but are not limited to litigation, intellectual property, criminal, divorce, 
and bankruptcy (Rhem, 2012). In understanding what a client needs, the law firm 
partner has to determine who would be the best (lawyer/lawyers) to address specific 
needs of the client and how they can effectively and efficiently handle these needs. 
Therefore, knowledge around servicing the client would be a good start for a legal 
KM strategy to focus. The legal KM strategy should address the knowledge needs, 
processes, initiatives, and tools that will increase the performance of the staff and 
provide outstanding services and increase revenue of the firm (Rhem, 2012). The 
legal KM strategy should incorporate specific KM drivers to insure that KM is 
adopted and sustained within the firm.

194 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
KM Drivers for Legal Professionals and Firms
In order for KM to take hold and be adopted across the firm, there are several driv-
ers that will lead to law firms incorporating KM into the organization. The KM 
drivers for legal professionals and firms include the following:
 
◾Cost pressures: KM can be used to work more efficiently to meet client demands 
and become more cost-effective with the various services being provided.
 
◾Efficiency and consistency: KM (through explicit knowledge capture) will pro-
duce standard and consistent forms, templates, processes, and procedures to 
become more efficient in delivering services to clients.
 
◾Flexibility and responsiveness: KM (through incorporating expertise locators 
as an example) will facilitate flexibility and responsiveness to client needs by 
assigning the “right resources (lawyers) at the right time in the right way to 
address the particular need(s) of clients.”
 
◾Training and learning: KM (in particular, by implementing knowledge trans-
fer, sharing, collaboration processes, policies, and tools) will create an atmo-
sphere where lawyers can learn from each other, share best practices, and 
provide practical training for inexperienced associates.
 
◾Retention (people and knowledge): Successful KM practices, policies, and 
tools will create an environment where all staff will experience enrichment 
through collaboration and sharing. In addition, expertise management will 
foster lawyers being assigned to cases where their expertise can be best lev-
eraged, and this will foster an environment where the retention of staff is 
high. Establishing a knowledge portal will enable individual knowledge to be 
captured and included as part of the corporate knowledge base, where it can 
be accessed across the firm, and this will facilitate the retention of the firm’s 
knowledge.
 
◾Workplace satisfaction: Establishing KM to address retention of people and 
the accessibility of knowledge contributes greatly toward workplace satisfac-
tion. Fostering an environment where you are rewarding employees for shar-
ing knowledge and open communication for collaboration will continue to 
enrich the workplace.
Some of the benefits KM has for legal professionals and firms are as follows:
 
◾The ability through expertise locators to quickly build teams to address cases 
and client situations
 
◾The ability through search engine optimization techniques (taxonomies, 
ontology, and associated information architectures for legal information and 
knowledge objects) to improve retrieval of case history, enable associations of 
related cases and rulings, as well as locate knowledge resources (subject mat-
ter experts) based on knowledge objects that are retrieved

KM in the Legal Profession ◾ 195
 
◾The ability to share, collaborate, and store communication around intellec-
tual capital
 
◾The ability to mentor and cross-train new, associate, and experienced lawyers
 
◾The ability to manage and expand the talent and experiences of lawyers in 
the firm
 
◾The ability to infuse KM in managing law firms
 
◾The ability to reuse internally developed knowledge assets such as precedents, 
letters, research findings, and case history information
Knowledge capture and transfer to prepare the law firm for when partners and/
or associates leave the firm, infusing knowledge sharing to continue building the 
expertise of the firm, and improving learning through lessons learned, assessments, 
and continual process improvement for better client service are all valuable assets 
that KM will impart to the firm.
This chapter focuses on how law firms manage their vast array of explicit and 
tacit knowledge. It also examines how law firms are leveraging precedent develop-
ment, legal research, talent management, expertise locator, LPM, and client sup-
port, all in relation to instituting KM within their legal institutions to provide the 
law firm with a distinct advantage over its competitors.
Talent Management in Law Firms
As stated in Chapter 6, infusing a human capital/talent management strategy with 
KM that includes knowledge capture, knowledge cataloging and reuse, knowledge 
sharing, and connecting expertise throughout your organization will improve the 
talents of your people and increase the organizational competency. This section will 
explore lawyer training and expertise locators to improve performance and align 
the right knowledge to the right task(s).
Lawyer/Legal Staff Training
KM will provide law firms with the mechanisms to manage the development of and 
access to core practice content. In this capacity, KM will supplement lawyer train-
ing by providing access to knowledge relating to internal memoranda on practice 
legal issues and practice process checklists; identifying work product precedents 
(exemplar documents); providing knowledge about internal and external firm pub-
lications, presentations, and training; detailing results from legal knowledge proj-
ects and systems in the assigned practice area(s); as well as providing access to legal 
knowledge bases and repositories.
It is important that lawyers new to the firm are trained and mentored to use 
the firm’s relevant knowledge tools (if they exist) and information resources. An 
effort to coordinate with peers in other practice areas to exchange best practices 

196 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
regarding knowledge resources, including monitoring and sharing practitioner’s 
recent,  relevant legal developments and current market practice developments and 
trends, is another essential aspect of KM, providing a holistic approach to speed up 
new lawyers and thereby taking less time to become productive.
Not only is the training for lawyers important, but the training for all legal staff 
on the management of the law firm is also important. Essential to that training is 
access to mentors and knowledge in order to become productive quickly by sup-
porting the needs of the lawyers. The following are details concerning the evolu-
tion of the legal support staff due to technology and access to knowledge tools and 
information resources.
Legal Secretaries/Legal Assistants/Paralegals
The increase in use of laptops, smartphones, and tablets in law firms allows attor-
neys to work independently anywhere, anytime. These devices are just a few of 
the technological advancements that have vastly affected legal secretaries’ duties. 
Younger tech-savvy attorneys type their own correspondence and use smart devices 
to carry out their day-to-day duties. This decrease in traditional clerical duties is 
causing a major change in the role and the necessary knowledge needed to be a 
legal secretary.
Legal secretaries, who once supported one or two attorneys, are now often sup-
porting many more as well as performing many more duties, such that they are now 
being retitled as “legal assistants.” These legal assistant positions represent a new 
transitional opportunity that can be leveraged to entice a new generation of entry-
level college-degree workers into the legal profession.
The role of the paralegal is also evolving into that of the legal assistant due to the 
mobility and access that technology has created. Technology has enabled the abil-
ity to achieve more than normal, access legal knowledge repositories whenever and 
wherever required, share knowledge, and support multiple lawyers. Legal assistants 
in many firms are now performing legal research. This requires that a legal assistant 
know precisely where to go for any necessary information. Because of this, today 
most firms have discarded their books in favor of online services such as Westlaw 
and Lexis for legal research as well as utilizing other Internet resources. This allows 
a legal assistant to perform the research in less than half the time, and with this 
faster technology, the answer is often expected within minutes.
Another major change in the role of legal assistants involves the handling of 
discovery. Paralegals play a critical role in assisting attorneys with discovery. They 
help manage the discovery process, especially when large volumes of documents are 
involved. These are no longer paper documents; instead, through the use of docu-
ment, content, and KM software, discovery documents and associated knowledge 
are stored, providing easy access.
Therefore, the traditional role of a legal assistant has transformed into a more 
tech-savvy one, and paralegals are now training and working with IT personnel to 

KM in the Legal Profession ◾ 197
assist in managing the discovery process. The knowledge necessary to perform in 
this role requires familiarity with document, content, and KM software and state 
and federal e-discovery rules, and they must be able to coordinate with outside 
litigation support vendors. As a result, the evolution of technology has created a 
new legal support staff member who merges the skills of a paralegal and a computer 
specialist into a legal technology specialist.
Legal Technology Specialist
A legal technology specialist provides technical support for large e-discovery proj-
ects, document production, and document reviews. He or she requires not only 
advanced knowledge of document, content, and KM software but also a thorough 
understanding of federal and state rules of civil procedure.
It is because of technology and the access provided to legal information 
through document, content, and KM software that law firms need to begin to 
reclassify and create new job descriptions, duties, and titles to better reflect the 
support staff’s actual responsibilities. This will trickle down to providing not only 
the necessary training but also the necessary reorganization to deliver the best cli-
ent services.
Law firm business model must produce increased profits through greater effi-
ciency from decreased revenues. This model demands a strong team of knowledge-
able, resourceful, and talented professionals. Having access to the firm’s corporate 
knowledge will enable that to happen.
Expertise Locators
An expertise locator is a system that is intended to be used to connect people to oth-
ers whose expertise (capabilities) are needed. This system includes tools and tech-
niques that allow for identification of who has the expertise on a certain topic(s). 
The seeker of an expert can expect to accrue the benefits of accessing one or more 
experts from a pool of talent within the organization.
It is often said that “we don’t know what we know,” and at an organizational 
level, this can be extended to mean “we don’t know who knows what.” If you were 
to ask someone if they know who has expertise about a certain topic, they will 
probably be able to name a few people. But ask them to name more than five people 
in the organization who have this expertise and they will likely struggle to list the 
names of these individuals. The expertise locator will look up the available expertise 
within the organization, when solving a problem, rather than rediscovering what 
someone has done already.
The expertise locator (see Figure 12.1) can be used not only for fields of expertise 
but for any way of classifying and tagging (see section on “Metadata” in Chapter 4) 
user profiles that are useful to your organization. Each different type of expertise or 

198 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
attribute that you wish to use can be added as a custom field to users’ profile pages. 
The unique type of custom field used for this purpose is called a “tag custom field.” 
The benefit of these tag custom fields is that the tags associated with them are used 
to identify only the people, not content. This challenge of finding experts is an issue 
across all industries. Most companies have systems that identify and classify experts 
using some sort of searchable directory or database that includes a description of 
the person’s role and the team he or she belongs to, but these systems have limited 
functionality.
These kinds of tools are needed when we are considering assembling a team 
with certain expertise that is needed to address a problem. This capability is essen-
tial in putting a team of lawyers together in order to address a client’s legal issue. 
Locating experts is often a time-consuming and tedious process. An expertise loca-
tor will reduce the time needed to put the right team together and contribute in 
facilitating reducing costs and gaining efficiencies for clients.
However, there are some disparagements around expertise locators. One is that 
the method identifies the knowledge at the individual level and does not capture 
the knowledge of groups or teams. Another is criticism about the notion of “the 
expert” itself, as the level of “expert” is really limited to a very few people. One 
solution to this issue is to identify in the expertise locator a person’s capabilities and 
fields of experience and associate the person to actual content within your knowl-
edge base such as briefings authored or other project documentation, as opposed to 
just identifying capabilities.
The benefit of these tag custom fields is that the tags associated with them are used 
to identify only the people, not content. For example, a regular tag called “Criminal 
Law” can be applied to pages, profiles, groups, or any other type of content. So select-
ing this as a search facet would return results of all kinds. But if “Criminal Law” is 
added to a tag custom field on users’ profiles, selecting it as a search facet will narrow 
your search down to only the people with the expertise that you are looking for!

Legal Project Management
LPM focuses on leveraging the application and concepts of project management in 
order to control and manage the business of providing legal services. Law firms work-
ing under fee arrangements such as fixed or flat fees, cost limits, and success bonuses 
are commonly utilizing project management. Project management (see section on 
“Software Methodologies” in Chapter 2) will provide management of schedule, risk, 
and cost in a more rigorous and structured manner. LPM is becoming standard prac-
tice for law departments and firms using hourly billing as they are faced with the need 
to be more efficient in the delivery of legal services.
LPM can be an effective tool for improving efficiency in the delivery of legal 
services. LPM techniques can help identify best practices for scoping a matter, 
effectively communicating across the team, managing a budget, and monitor-
ing progress. However, to realize these benefits, the lawyers will have to buy-in 
and realize benefits from this right away. A best practice would be to start with 
a pilot with a few lawyers in order to demonstrate the value of LPM and to 
achieve a quick win. Once some level of buy-in has been accomplished, continue 
implementing the LPM practice, capturing and applying lessons learned along 
the way.
Palomaki and Wagner (2011; [emphasis added]) have indicated 10 aspects of 
what they found instrumental in getting lawyers to buy into LPM inside a law firm 
and they are listed below:
 
1. Embrace it, lawyers know everything: Many lawyers will right-
fully rebel against the notion that PM training is teaching them 
something new. PM includes skills and techniques that most law-
yers currently know and use. Acknowledging that the attorneys 
already possess the basic skills and that PM techniques merely 
provide more structure around what they are already doing, is key 
to gaining attorneys’ buy-in. And, if you talk to the lawyers about 
a time they have exceeded budget and had to explain it to a client 
that can be a good starting point for helping them identify what 
they can do better to avoid that conversation in the future.
 
2. Consider a bottom-up approach: Many of the firms who are on the 
path to PM have taken a top-down approach. It is no surprise that 
the “Do it because I said so” method is ineffective. Rather than 
dictating a one-size-fits-all tactic, consider starting with individ-
ual client or project teams. In order to help improve efficiencies, 
first identify what the inefficiencies are. All lawyers are not inef-
ficient in the same way, and neither is the solution to help them. 
Training on a team level and helping individual teams analyze 
the way they work will be more effective and more successful—
one team at a time.

200 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
3. KISS (Keep it simple, stupid): Lawyers hate non-legal training, and 
if you make them attend training that is longer than 90 minutes, 
they get really cranky. Instead of trying to cram all that could 
be taught into 90 minutes or forcing our lawyers to submit to 
daylong sessions, we found it more effective to develop training 
programs that are unique and specific to the individual teams 
on just those areas in which that team wants help. By approach-
ing the training this way, our lawyers really hone in on the areas 
where they want to focus. They don’t learn everything, but they 
learn what they want to know, they use it and they get results. 
Then, they come back for more.
 
4. Encourage debate: We hired an outside consultant to jump-start 
Sutherland’s PM initiative. Throughout the training course, 
the consultant both anticipated and enjoyed the debates that 
occurred during the session and was able to use those discussions 
to emphasize key points on many concepts. We learned that our 
lawyers got the most out of PM training when we opened up 
the discussion and encouraged them to debate the concepts and 
best practices. Our lawyers fiercely debated the appropriate time 
to talk to clients about a change in scope, how much to involve 
associates in the overall project plan, what the best practices are 
for team meetings and communication, and how to share a post-
project review with the team. And, as is usually the case in the 
law, there is no right answer. The “right” answer is team, practice 
and client specific. What works for one team may not work for 
the other. The most critical piece is that the team and the client 
are on the same page. Listen to the debate, and you will be better 
positioned to help your lawyers where they need it most.
 
5. Do ONE thing better: Every lawyer, every practice, every client, 
and every team has different strengths and weaknesses. Still, there 
is always one thing the team can do better. Encourage everyone 
to be involved in identifying inefficiencies, our team members 
have ownership in the solution, and everyone works together to 
improve the process.
 
6. Talk about task codes: Task codes can be a sticking point for proj-
ect management efforts in law firms. The codes are intended to 
systematically categorize legal work by grouping relevant tasks 
for a matter. Executed correctly, the codes can provide a platform 
for tracking the scope and budget of a matter based on task (e.g., 
case assessment, pre-trial pleadings, discovery, trial preparation). 
Task codes can also provide historical data that allows for better 
budget forecasting. There can be a few challenges with using task 
codes, however. Using codes requires the lawyers to know and 

KM in the Legal Profession ◾ 201
understand how to segment their time without overlap and all 
team members must use the codes consistently. Without consis-
tent standards and definitions, the data that results is “garbage in, 
garbage out.” Our approach is to let the client’s objectives dictate 
how task codes will be used and then to implement them for the 
specific team.
 
7. Follow up and reward success: Once a team has identified an inef-
ficiency, how will you know if they have improved? Following up 
with them at regular intervals—a couple of weeks, 30 days, and 
so on—will ensure everyone stays motivated. Ask them how they 
are progressing. Did the solution work the way they thought it 
would? Has improving one area created a more inefficient process 
somewhere else? Have they developed a best practice that can be 
shared with another team doing similar work? In addition to fol-
lowing up, recognizing success is essential. Make sure firm man-
agement is aware of the progress the team is making. Helping the 
lawyers along the way and promoting them internally when they 
succeed helps everyone achieve their client goals.
 
8. Be resourceful: An area for improvement we identified was bet-
ter sharing of resources. In conjunction with our KM initiative, 
we are working with teams and individual lawyers to pool the 
resources they use repeatedly, making them easily accessible to 
anyone who may need them. We are identifying various tem-
plates and tools considered to be “best practices” and making 
them available in our KM system. Sharing across the firm helps 
everyone do a better job for their clients.
 
9. Use technology: When we began the PM initiative, none of the 
available software products had been fully tested. Since we had 
the capabilities internally to create our own tool, we took the 
“build it yourself” approach. We knew we wanted a platform that 
would help our lawyers better track the progress on matter scope 
and budgets, ensuring there were no surprises for the client at 
the end of the month. We also knew we wanted the flexibility to 
customize the platform for each client or individual matter.
 
10. Include your clients! By conducting client feedback interviews 
proved by far the most effective tool we have to hear what cli-
ents really think about our firm and its services. Clients want the 
best service possible, and they want to help their favorite outside 
counsel be the best they can be.
The practice of LPM varies from law-firm-specific practices to corporate law entities 
when it comes to the approach to legal work. In recent years, clients have begun 
demanding more alternative fee arrangements, greater predictability, improved 

202 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
accountability, and, above all, cost containment from their law firms (Palomaki 
and Wagner, 2011). Project management (specifically LPM) is a disciplined, sys-
tematic, task-based approach to work process that can provide law firms with some 
key tools to respond to client demands. The knowledge that is gained and reused in 
the LPM paradigm is essential to gaining efficiencies and the cost containment that 
law firms and legal entities are looking for.
KM in LPM
Knowledge is generated throughout the execution of a project. KM within projects 
is intended to make relevant knowledge available to the project team throughout 
the execution of the project. Project management methodologies usually define 
standard project phases, processes, templates, or actions that are repeated in the 
course of different projects.
The LPM execution addresses why the project idea exists, the problem(s) it is 
addressing, the products or the deliverables of the project, who will take part in the 
project, and how will people working on the project be organized, as well as the 
project location and deadlines. KM as a part of the LPM process will document and 
share decisions and assumptions regarding resources, timelines, quality requirements, 
and costs. KM will also document and share domain knowledge: knowledge about 
the industry, technology, processes, current situation, business products, and services 
(i.e., the software development life cycle); institutional knowledge: knowledge that 
a project team or member has about the organization (i.e., organization structure 
and reporting structure); and process knowledge: knowledge about the project tasks, 
methodologies, timelines, structure, deliverables, and processes (i.e., project plan), as 
well as sharing and transferring knowledge through mentoring and lessons learned 
(which are documented after every phase and at the end of the project).
According to Lisa Kellar Gianakos, director of KM at Pillsbury Winthrop 
Shaw Pittman and the author of The Intersection of Knowledge and Legal Project 
Management (2013, p. 1), “KM professionals understand the process of law prac-
tice, project management, finance, and technology. They also tend to be analyti-
cal and logical thinkers. Furthermore, in many firms the KM professionals have 
already built bridges to both lawyers and multiple staff departments. Since LPM is 
a collaborative effort, those bridges turn out to be very important in the difficult 
LPM change management process” (Gianakos, 2013).
 Gianakos also quotes Toby Brown. Brown is a well-known LPM evangelist with 
a strong history in KM. “In his keynote on the Economics of Law and the Future 
of KM, he discussed why, for KM to remain a vital function for firms, it needs to 
be focused on solving the core challenges facing firms” (Gianakos, 2013, p. 1). KM 
applied to LPM is one of the vehicles for KM to remain in front of law firms in the 
foreseeable future. The project development life cycle enables many traditional KM 
goals to become closely aligned with those of LPM (cultivating efficiencies, deliver-
ing better predictability, and improving communications and processes). It is with 

KM in the Legal Profession ◾ 203
this understanding that KM enables project team members to reduce rework and 
squeezes the time that it takes to plan project execution. Sharing lessons learned and 
advanced practices is key to helping others excel in the LPM process and execution.
Legal Research
This section is not intended to provide an examination of legal research tools that 
are available to legal professionals and law firms. It is intended, however, to examine 
the role that legal research and the access to its resources plays in the overall KM 
within law firms and for legal professionals.
In order to understand where to find the right content that is buried deep 
within your firm’s thousands of research repositories and outside sources (such as 
WestLawNext®, LexisNexis®, and VersusLaw®) and understand who in the firm has 
a deep knowledge of specific content, in addition to wondering if what you have 
in your repositories are up-to-date and relevant, you quickly realize that KM is a 
 challenge! Multiply that by the number of trial and appellate briefs, memoranda, 
pleadings, depositions, e-mails, letters, and spreadsheets prepared by inside and out-
side counsel alike and the challenge becomes even more daunting. Without incor-
porating KM, your firm runs the risk of paying for research over and over again.
During the early years of a lawyer’s career, research and document drafting are 
the predominant professional activities that are being performed. Legal research 
tools and sources are key resources to assist the early stage lawyers in performing 
their tasks. The tools of legal research are considered KM tools that help legal pro-
fessionals locate the knowledge and analysis previously written by judges, expert 
scholars, and lawyers for adaptation and use in the context presented by a current 
client. LexisNexis research tools that include citation tools, treatises by authors and 
competitive publishers, as well as integrated search functionality are all delivered to 
the legal researchers via laptops, tablets, and other mobile devices (Staudt, 2003).
Legal research tools benefit users by helping them improve their research speed 
and accuracy and enable a precision of collaboration, which the combination of 
research resources and tools makes possible. Realizing the benefits that the vari-
ous legal research tools bring to the law firm will depend in large measure on the 
 current structure of the firm’s internal data and on the past and future ability of 
the firm’s data infrastructure to insure that the firm data is of very high quality. 
A brief  synopsis of three popular legal research platforms, namely WestLawNext, 
LexisNexis, and VersusLaw, are presented subsequently.
WestLawNext
WestLawNext (see Figure 12.2) provides an authoritative content (primary law and 
exclusive secondary law titles), attorney-editor expertise, with access to primary law, 
analytical materials, practice area insights, litigation resources, public records, and 

204 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
more. This platform enables users to build a legal research page that’s ideal for the 
way you work, through organizing your favorite content and legal research tools. 
It also provides access to legal encyclopedias, treatises, legal periodicals, and law 
reviews that provide well-reasoned statements of the law.
LexisNexis
LexisNexis (see Figure 12.3) is a global provider of content-enabled workflow solu-
tions, and is designed specifically for professionals in the legal, risk management, 
corporate, government, law enforcement, accounting, and academic markets. 
This platform originally pioneered online information with its Lexis® and Nexis®

services. It is part of RELX Group (London, UK) and serves customers in more 
than 100 countries, with more than 15,000 employees worldwide.
LexisNexis provides an integration of information and technology. It unites 
proprietary brands, advanced web technologies, and premium information sources. 
Across the globe, LexisNexis provides customers with access to billions of searchable 
documents and records from more than 45,000 legal, news, and business sources. 
LexisNexis encompasses authoritative legal-publishing brands, dating back to the 
nineteenth century, including Butterworths® in the United Kingdom, Canada, and 
the Asia-Pacific region; Les Editions du Juris Classeur in France; and Matthew 
Bender® worldwide.
VersusLaw
VersusLaw (see Figure 12.4) was founded in 1985 as Timeline Publishing Company 
(Minneapolis, MN). The company’s focus was originally to provide the legal com-
munity with accurate, current, and in-depth information, exclusively on one topic: 
professional liability. The company created a monthly journal on legal ethics titled 
Lawyers Liability Review (LLR) and published the first issue in February 1986.
In the early 1990s, Timeline began the electronic collection and distribution of 
court opinions and other primary research materials. Timeline was an early adopter 
of the Internet, and in August 1995, it was among the first web-based legal content 
providers, carrying opinions from the US Supreme Court, the Federal Circuit Courts 
of Appeals, and State appellate courts. Reflecting a new direction and the company’s 
commitment to electronic distribution of legal research materials, in 1996, Timeline 
Publishing changed its name to VersusLaw, Inc. and launched a new website devoted 
exclusively to the distribution of primary materials to the legal profession.
Today, VersusLaw continues to broaden its focus and mission: to provide all 
legal practitioners access to current, in-depth, easy-to-use legal research, regardless 
of the size of their firms, by using the power of technology.

206 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Precedent/Case Law Knowledge
An essential part of any law firm’s legal research knowledge base is having access to 
precedent case law information. Having access to judicial precedent/case law infor-
mation and incorporating that knowledge within the overall KM infrastructure are 
essential for law firm performance.
Enabling access to previous judicial decisions or proceedings must be relied 
upon for future similar cases. This is an important part of any law firm’s knowledge 
base because all courts are bound to follow decisions made by courts higher than 
themselves in the hierarchy, and all appellate courts are usually bound by their own 
previous decisions. This supports the idea of fairness and certainty throughout the 
courts. However, precedent can only stand if the reason for the decision is known, 
so at the end of a case a judgment is given. This is what creates the precedent for 
judges to follow in future cases.
The value of a case law knowledge base is that the law can be adapted to situa-
tions that were not contemplated by the legislature. With hundreds of cases being 
decided every day, having a knowledge base with access to this knowledge will 
enable the law firm to keep up with relevant decisions. It is not unusual for several 
courts to be deciding cases on the same subject at the same time, with no good way 
to coordinate their opinions. Frequently, the courts will reach different conclusions 
about the law.
A companion knowledge base to include is the civil law system. In civil law, 
the legislatures pass very specific statutes, and these are applied by the courts. 
Each judge who decides a case looks to the statute, rather than the previous 
cases, for guidance. The judges’ decisions (or interpretations, where they are free 
to reinterpret the statute as necessary to fit the facts of the specific case) are an 
excellent source of knowledge for any law firm involved in civil cases. Another 
important note is that civil law judges do try to ensure some consistency in the 
application of the law by taking into consideration previous court decisions, fur-
ther strengthening the reason for having both case law and civil law knowledge 
sources.
In some instances, law firms can positively increase their visibility through pub-
lishing their own case decisions that contribute to setting a precedence (legal ques-
tions of first impression).
Legal KM and Client Support
The differentiators between law firms and legal practitioners are the intangibles, 
and one such intangible is true client care and service. In a Forbes 2014 article, 
Micah Solomon indicates that creating true client loyalty is one of the most power-
ful and reliable ways to build a strategic, sustainable advantage for your (law) prac-
tice and that truly loyal clients are less price sensitive, more willing to forgive your 

KM in the Legal Profession ◾ 207
small foibles, and largely immune to competitive entreaties from the firm across the 
street or across the continent (Solomon, 2014).
Client support specifically focuses on dramatically improving the client 
experience. It is the expectation of all clients that legal professionals and law 
firms will provide high-quality legal services, and it’s the promise and demon-
stration of high-quality legal services that are the intangibles that will set the 
firm apart.
KM plays a key role in ensuring a high level of client support. KM staffs 
operate smoothly between lawyers and a range of operational functions—ideally 
situated to increase intra-firm collaboration, communication, and understand-
ing. Some KM programs have worked on operations for some time, but business 
conditions are now ripe for more extensive applications of KM to firm opera-
tions—arguably critical to keeping operational teams relevant and law firms 
profitable.
KM in law firms provides the ability to identify and provide business pro-
cess and technology solutions to improve the business and increase profitability. 
Establishing KM groups in firm operations to facilitate collaboration and knowl-
edge transfer within the operation functions of the firm is another area where KM 
can be applied. LPM (detailed earlier in this chapter) focuses on what the client 
needs and structures a cohesive plan to deliver client-specific services in the most 
expeditious and cost-effective manner. In addition, KM can be leverage to stan-
dardize the onboarding process across the firm delivering consistent role-based 
knowledge (see section on “Role-Based Knowledge” in Chapter 6) to legal profes-
sionals based on their role and job functions at the firm. KM will also provide pro-
cess mapping, help understanding workflow and critical touch points, and enhance 
the handling of the flow of knowledge throughout the firm.
Competitive Intelligence
As law firms mature in their use of knowledge and KM, incorporating the use of 
CI to gain an advantage when serving clients is a logical next or synergistic next 
step. KM and CI are about the process of gathering actionable knowledge on the 
law firms’ competitive landscape. CI essentially means understanding and learning 
what’s happening in the world outside your business, so you can be as competitive 
as possible. It means learning as much as possible—as soon as possible—about your 
industry in general and your competitors.
CI is the process of collecting and analyzing information about competitors’ 
strengths and weaknesses in a legal and ethical manner to enhance business deci-
sion making. CI activities can be basically grouped into two main types: (1) tacti-
cal, which is shorter term and seeks to provide input into issues such as capturing 
market share or increasing revenues, and (2) strategic, which focuses on longer term 
issues such as key risks and opportunities facing the enterprise. CI is different from 

208 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
corporate or industrial espionage, which uses illegal and unethical methods to gain 
an unfair competitive advantage.
KM infuses CI strategy through centering on a firm’s ability to expand relation-
ships with clients and make faster and more informed decisions that help enhance 
the firm’s thought leadership position. CI initiatives leveraging KM will aid in the 
intelligence-gathering process, empowering practice group initiatives, while elevat-
ing the firm to the role of a trusted advisor providing knowledge of industry trends, 
legislation, litigation, and other legal precedents.
Ann Lee Gibson states that although CI is indeed based on information, it is cre-
ated only when that information is analyzed, refined, and distilled into something 
that has very clear implications for decision making. It offers the most benefits to 
firms where important decisions and actions are being considered, particularly the 
kinds with big upsides and downsides. In these settings, CI can significantly reduce 
risk.
KM Architecture in Law Firms
To realize the potential that KM offers to law firms, a holistic KM architecture 
should be implemented. A KM architecture that includes the aspects of legal KM, 
presented in this chapter, provides the roadmap and consistent structure for imple-
menting KM in law firms (see Figure 12.5). The development of communities of 
practice, blogs, and wikis’ knowledge repositories of work products (i.e., forms, 
letters, and factums) needs a holistic KM system approach. Just incorporating a 
document management and/or enterprise content management system does not 
incorporate necessary key KM capabilities (i.e., collaboration and expertise loca-
tor). In addition, implementing workflow is important for managing the flow of 
knowledge and to execute the governance of digital assets to insure they are kept 
relevant, accessible, and up to date.
Information Architecture
Information architecture through the implementation of an understanding of con-
tent relationships, taxonomies, and metadata (see Chapter 4) will improve retrieval 
of case history and enable associations of related cases and rulings, including locat-
ing knowledge resources (SMEs) needed for specific cases.
Creating/Modifying Taxonomy
The core benefit of KM is the ability to classify, retain, and find critical knowl-
edge. Navigation, taxonomy, and search are important for long-term adoption 
and success of KM, because they are the framework by which users find the 
information they are looking for when they do not know where it is located. If

users are unable to find the content they need, the value to the user is almost 
entirely lost. The KM taxonomy can be changed based on recommendation of 
the knowledge architect.
Creating/Modifying/Managing Metadata
Requests for Metadata Changes
Any user may suggest metadata changes. The knowledge architect administrator is 
solely authorized to raise a request for metadata changes. This request needs to be 
vetted and approved before moving ahead. Metadata reuse is highly recommended. 
This means that metadata values should be enforced during the artifact creation/
check-in processes within the KM. It also means that determining metadata val-
ues should not be a “one system/silo” view of values. Critical metadata values will 
reflect the overall information architecture.
Governance of Law Firm Knowledge
KM governance ensures policy adherence and successful capture, cataloging, reuse, 
monitoring, managing, and maintaining of explicit knowledge of the firm (see 
Figure 12.6). The KM governance plan describes the policies, procedures, roles, and 
responsibilities as it pertains to explicit knowledge. Effective governance planning

and the application of the governance plan are critical for the ongoing success of the 
managing and maintaining of explicit knowledge.
The KM governance plan will establish the processes and policies to
 
◾Avoid explicit knowledge proliferation.
 
◾Ensure explicit knowledge is maintained by implementing quality manage-
ment policies.
 
◾Establish clear decision-making authority and escalation procedures, so that 
policy deviations are managed and conflicts are resolved quickly.
 
◾Ensure the solution strategy is aligned with business objectives so it continu-
ously delivers business value.
 
◾Ensure explicit knowledge is retained in compliance with KM guidelines.
Benefits of Governance
The following are some of the benefits of governance:
 
◾It provides an enterprise-wide common infrastructure for all explicit 
knowledge.
 
◾It provides more reliable and relevant search.
 
◾It ensures that the explicit knowledge, taxonomy, and metadata schema 
remain relevant to its users.
 
◾It employs best practices to improve usability.
 
◾It lowers total cost of information/content development and management 
through increased efficiencies throughout the KM life cycle.
Policies and Standards
Policies define rules for use; standards describe best practices. From a governance 
perspective, policies are usually driven by statutory, regulatory, or organizational 
requirements. Users are expected to meet policies without deviation. These stan-
dards are established to encourage consistent practices.
Governing Information Architecture
Information architecture must be governed in order to ensure that
 
◾It is implemented and maintained.
 
◾It meets the regulatory requirements, privacy needs, and security goals of the 
enterprise.
 
◾It meets an organization’s business goals. A well-designed and governed infor-
mation architecture can multiply that organization’s effectiveness.

212 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Enforcing Metadata Quality
Metadata quality in the repository is a direct reflection on the effectiveness of 
knowledge that is attainable now and in the future. The governance plan will 
indicate what should be measured to determine the effectiveness of metadata by 
evaluating number of artifacts without metadata, metadata reuse, watching search 
relevancy, seeking inputs from users, and proactive monitoring.
Archiving—Record Retention Governance
The various content (information and knowledge) repositories are locations for val-
ued artifacts. Often, the various sites used to contain the content must not only 
contain the current content but also the content that has expired. A policy should 
be put in place to remove the archived content from search results and to retain 
based on the company retention policy. The KM governance policy should align 
with the current record retention policy of the firm.
Governing Content
The governing of knowledge content must leverage the following best practices:
 
◾Use workflows and approval for content centers and site pages wherever offi-
cial content is stored.
 
◾Use version history and version control to maintain a history and the authori-
tative source of the content.
 
◾Audit, manage, and maintain content repositories according to the content 
life-cycle management.
 
◾Use site usage confirmation and deletion to manage site collection life cycles.
 
◾Identify important corporate assets and sites that contain personally identifi-
able information to be sure that they are properly secured and audited.
 
◾Integrate the information architecture with the environment’s search 
 strategy. Take advantage of enterprise search features such as people search, 
content sources, and connectors for external content.
Governing KM Effectiveness
Assessing Value with Metrics
Measuring effectiveness is a key component of governance and thus included here. 
Metrics are a component to measuring overall adequacy and effectiveness of the 
KM tool. Initial rollout of KM will take some time across the first business area(s). 
Experience shows even then that adoption takes time. Measurements at the begin-
ning, middle (during adoption), and end (fully matured) can be different.

KM in the Legal Profession ◾ 213
Search—Tuning and Optimization
Site owners/administrators should constantly observe and evaluate effectiveness of 
search results. Site administrators/owners oftentimes can get the “Search Query 
and Search Result” reports from the search tools administrator periodically (every 
two weeks). From these reports, they can analyze the type of keywords users are 
searching for and the sites from which most of the search queries are coming. Based 
on this, site administrators/owners can “tune” the search for their sites. If any newly 
added metadata column needs to be available in advanced search filters, then the 
search administrator will ensure this metadata is configured.
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾A support structure to adopt when considering restructuring the law firm 
management office is to leverage collaborative teams consisting of partners, 
associates, paralegals, legal assistants, and legal technology specialists, all 
dedicated to performing the necessary tasks to provide quality services to 
clients and to ensure that the firm is running in a highly efficient and cost-
effective manner.
 
◾Training programs must be established to assist all law firm management 
team members to retool and shift their thinking and approach to work in a 
more technologically advanced and collaborative law firm.
 
◾A best practice for instituting LPM is to start with a pilot with a few lawyers 
in order to demonstrate the value of LPM and to achieve a quick win.
 
◾When considering implementing governance, institute a comprehensive KM 
governance process to ensure the monitoring, managing, and maintenance 
of your legal/law firm knowledge. This will contribute greatly to keeping this 
knowledge relevant and up to date.
 
◾For LPM to be successful, understanding your law firm’s culture as well as 
applying Palomaki and Wagner’s 10 aspects in getting lawyers to buy into 
LPM will be a key ingredient to the success of implementing LPM.
Tips and Techniques
The following are some tips and techniques deduced after reading this chapter:
 
◾When considering incorporating KM with the law firm/law practice, begin 
with the benefits that KM can bring.
 
◾Identify the key benefits and align them to the KM drivers to facilitate the 
adoption of KM at the law firm.

214 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾The use of technology is changing the way law firms operate and the way legal 
professionals work. Acquiring the right technical personnel to assist in transi-
tioning technology into the firm as well as providing the necessary training to 
all legal staff will facilitate adoption and proper use of technology (see section 
“TTF Model” in Chapter 16 for details on facilitating technology adoption).
 ◾Expertise locators are a great tool for streamlining the process of assigning the 
right legal resource to the right problem. Consider implementing an expertise 
locator; this will contribute to retaining clients and attracting new ones enabling 
the firm to resolve client issues and address client needs more succinctly.

Knowledge Management 
Education
As knowledge management (KM) challenges top the agenda of many CEOs 
(Yunginger, 2013), an emphasis on getting more value from corporate knowledge 
assets has heightened the interest in KM as a professional area of practice. Providing 
education in KM, which can include specialized courses, seminars, certifications, 
and formal undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral programs, is leading the way in 
preparing future KM practitioners to meet this challenge. On the other hand, it 
has also raised questions about the educational foundation needed to support the 
profession.
Despite the wealth of published and informal literature, although derived from 
practice, and dialog on the foundational learning needs of KM practitioners, there 
is no consensus on what comprises professional education and training in KM. In 
2011, the Knowledge Management Education Forum (KMEF)—a collaboration 
between Kent State University and George Washington University—was formed. 
The mission of KMEF in part is to provide an ongoing, annual dialog 
to identify and grow consensus on the knowledge management body 
of knowledge, competencies, roles and curriculum. The goal of the 
KMEF is to create an environment in which a consensus can evolve. 
It brings together the current and past thought leaders in the field of 

216 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
knowledge management to discuss their work and to open the dialog 
where others can contribute. (KMEF, 2011: http://kmatkent.cim3.net/
wiki/Welcome)
Besides the educational options mentioned in section “KM education programs”, 
KM education opportunities are occurring in KM-focused departments, which 
are delivering subject-specific education and strategic learning programs. All of 
these KM educational products must operate under one cohesive and holistic set 
of standards and policies in order to provide the KM practitioners with consistent 
industry-recognized education. According to the KMEF, a special effort will be 
needed to connect the various educational entities to the business community and 
vice versa, while providing “the core and elective elements of a knowledge manage-
ment curriculum for the 21st century.” (KMEF, 2011: http://kmatkent.cim3.net/
wiki/Welcome)
While participating in the KMEF, it is generally recognized that 
there is general agreement that KM, knowledge services, and knowl-
edge strategy require, an understanding of shared concepts, a basic lexi-
con, and some level of mutual understanding about the elements and 
framework of KM, there continues to be concern that too much “stan-
dardization” might work against the success of KM in the workplace. 
(KMEF, 2011: http://kmatkent.cim3.net/wiki/Welcome)
As a KM practitioner who has worked (and continues to work) across various sec-
tors and industries of the twenty-first-century “knowledge economy,” I recognize 
that every organization is different and, therefore, the success of KM, knowledge 
services, and knowledge strategy in each is going to depend on how well the ele-
ments of KM align with the corporate objectives, unique management method-
ologies, and leadership structures of the various organizations implementing KM 
programs.
As KM education evolves for the twenty-first century and beyond, especially as 
the delivery of education and the workforce becomes more mobile, there is a need 
to establish a philosophy of teach-and-learn anywhere and anytime. This will facili-
tate the need to incorporate the following:
 
◾Standards for KM course design
 
◾Need to provide students (class participants) a practical way to apply KM
 
◾The delivery of technology that will facilitate the ability to teach and learn 
anywhere and anytime
 
◾Provide learning outcomes and assess them
 
◾An understanding of the various KM roles and responsibilities

Knowledge Management Education ◾ 217
This chapter will cover topics that include roles and responsibilities of knowledge 
professionals, educational needs of these professionals, core KM competencies, 
KM curriculum development and delivery, and KM education programs and 
teaching methodologies.
Roles and Responsibilities of Knowledge Professionals
The roles of knowledge professionals cover areas from strategic, tactical, program-
related to executing specific projects and system development. The KM roles and 
responsibilities vary according to the category in which the knowledge profes-
sional works. The roles and responsibilities depicted here (see Table 13.1) consist 
of but are not limited to chief knowledge officer (CKO), KM program manager, 
KM project manager, KM director, operations KM director, KM author, KM 
lead, KM liaison, KM specialist, KM system administrator, knowledge engineer, 
knowledge architect, KM writer, knowledge manager, and KM analyst.
Core KM Competencies
In determining core KM competencies (see Table 13.1), we must first understand 
what it takes to perform in the various KM roles and execute their responsibili-
ties. The KM core competencies include connecting education and strategic learn-
ing competencies with skill and ability in knowledge strategy development and 
operationalization, collaboration, leadership and management skills, in addition to 
technical competencies.
KM has both soft and hard competencies. The soft competencies include ensur-
ing that knowledge processing is aligned with the organization’s business goals and 
objectives and is integrated into the organization’s everyday business and work. 
It  also includes software development, business and systems architecture, and 
workflow management. The hard competencies include elicitation and representa-
tion of knowledge (both tacit and explicit) and structural knowledge in the form of 
business rules and business processes.
The KM Competency Model
KM focuses on people, process, and technology that enable and support knowledge 
sharing, transfer, access, and identification. KM competencies represent what KM 
practitioners must understand to facilitate KM methods established by the organiza-
tion. A KM competency model (see Figure 13.1) reflects the strategies, goals, and 
objectives of an organization. Competency alone is not sufficient; it must be accom-
panied by a cultural shift in the organization toward knowledge sharing.

Chief 
knowledge 
officer (CKO)
The CKO is the executive 
leader of the KM 
discipline at the 
organization and key 
figure for all KM activities 
initiated from the KM 
program.
The CKO manages the knowledge 
sharing process at the organizational 
level; leads efforts to move the 
organization to knowledge centricity; 
requires dedication to KM principles, 
the ability to discuss the benefits of 
knowledge sharing, and the vision to 
ensure that KM initiatives are adopted 
by the organization; ensures that the 
best, relevant knowledge for the area of 
practice is accessible to all personnel 
and implements the knowledge sharing 
strategy in alignment with corporate 
guidelines; champions cross-
organizational CoP; forms relationship 
with HR, IT/systems, organizational 
learning; establishes incentive programs 
for knowledge sharing and re-use; 
fosters cultural change; defines roles, 
skill sets, and opportunities for 
knowledge workers; and facilitates 
training and education of knowledge 
workers.
CKOs must have skills across a 
wide variety of areas. They must 
be good at developing/
understanding the big picture, 
advocacy (articulation, promotion, 
and justification of the knowledge 
agenda, sometimes against 
cynicism or even open hostility), 
project and people management 
(oversight of a variety of activities, 
attention to detail, ability to 
motivate), communications 
(communicating clearly the 
knowledge agenda, having good 
listening skills, and being sensitive 
to organizational opportunities 
and obstacles), leadership, team 
working, influencing, and 
interpersonal skills. The CKO who 
successfully combines these skills 
is well equipped as an excellent 
agent of change for his or her 
organization.

mining, data entry, 
calculation tasks, and 
decision-making 
applications. They try to 
formulate codes and 
programs that operate in 
a similar fashion to a 
human expert on a given 
task, such as solving 
complicated physics 
equations. Most 
knowledge engineers are 
employed by software 
development companies, 
though some work for 
private corporations and 
consulting groups.
 In addition, a knowledge engineer must 
have the foresight to include special 
instructions for the program that may be 
overlooked by a less experienced 
programmer. For example, he or she 
might be able to prevent common data 
entry errors in a spreadsheet 
application by programming the 
computer to recognize when one piece 
of data is very different from previous 
entries. If the application detects that a 
100 was entered instead of a 10, for 
example, it could ask the user if he or 
she is sure that the entry is correct.
A person who is interested in 
becoming a knowledge engineer 
can look into bachelor’s degree 
programs at accredited colleges 
and universities. Relatively few 
schools offer degrees specifically 
in knowledge engineering, but a 
program in computer science or 
software engineering can provide 
the appropriate training. Many 
future engineers decide to pursue 
master’s degrees or higher before 
looking for jobs in the specialty. 
A new knowledge engineer 
usually has the chance to work 
alongside experienced 
professionals for several weeks or 
months to master his or her skills.

To determine the KM competency model, a rigorous process was initiated to 
provide consensus on core competency areas (see Table 13.2). This methodology 
will apply to any modern organization, regardless of the establishment of a CKO 
role. It can be used by any department or individual who has the vision, leadership, 
and determination to infuse KM principles in the enterprise. A KM competency 
model serves as the foundation for functions such as training, education, develop-
ment, and performance management, because it specifies what essential knowl-
edge, skills, and abilities are required.
The KM competency model will serve as the foundation for enterprise-wide 
KM adoption and use, and it will create a culture of collaboration and knowledge 
sharing in the army, where personalized and contextual information and knowl-
edge are “pushed and pulled” from across the enterprise to meet mission objectives, 
where good ideas are valued regardless of the source, where knowledge sharing is 
recognized and rewarded, and where the knowledge base is accessible without tech-
nological or structural barriers.

Understand content-life-
cycle management, 
content library structures, 
content labeling and 
tagging, and search as it 
pertains to KM practices 
(IA).
Review current content 
management procedures to 
ensure compliance with formal 
policies and guidance; ensure 
all content is credible (has 
authoritative source, has 
contextual consistency, is 
actively managed); develop a 
consistent organizational 
approach to metadata along 
with the structure and 
guidelines to enforce metadata 
tagging by utilizing IA.
Assess how documents are created, 
stored, accessed, and archived; audit 
records to ensure compliance with 
formal record-keeping requirements; 
develop an IA plan/strategy for 
addressing discrepancies and poor 
practices.
Create metadata elements that will 
enhance the retrieval of content across 
the organization; look at both manual 
and automated methods of metadata 
creation; explore methods to provide 
social tagging to content to supplement 
controlled terms (details should be 
included in the IA plan/strategy).

Use metrics to measure 
efficiency (output—activity 
based) and effectiveness 
(outcome—results based).
Standardize measures across the 
organization to ensure they are 
focused on strategic outcomes.
Measure only what is 
necessary to drive the 
intended results.
Use a combination of both output and 
outcome metrics to track both hard 
(factual) and soft (perceptual) measures.
Focus organizational metrics on strategic 
goals and accomplish the mission; 
ensure alignment across all departments.
When measuring for outcomes, it is best 
to manage no more than five to seven 
measurements; the results should drive 
decisions that refine KM strategy.
Processes
Understand the use of KM 
techniques in order to 
find opportunities for 
simplifying current 
processes or making them 
more efficient or effective.
Use KM techniques to simplify 
or increase the efficiency or 
effectiveness of current 
business processes.
Create process maps and 
conduct knowledge audits to 
identify where critical 
information and knowledge 
inputs and outputs are.
Assess current processes that may be 
streamlined or eliminated; understand 
why the process steps must be 
performed as is to achieve the desired 
result.

knowledge maps can drive process 
redesign projects that help define the 
most appropriate roles and 
responsibilities for information and 
knowledge management, tightly 
integrated into the operational workflow.

KM technology 
(systems/tools)
Understand how 
technology impacts KM 
and the tools that are 
available to facilitate 
knowledge sharing and 
collaboration.
Ensure the organization IA fits 
the needs of its primary user 
groups, whether it’s for a 
single platform such as an 
intranet or knowledge portal, 
or across several platforms.
Assess how the organization 
currently uses technology to 
accomplish tasks such as 
content creation, capturing, 
reviewing, sharing, 
collaborating, and archiving.
Stay abreast of current and 
emerging technologies and 
how they can be (or are being 
unofficially) used within your 
organization.
An IA will make sense of how the 
different platforms relate to each other, 
how users will navigate between them, 
and how expectations for content 
discovery (search) can be met.
Develop a list of tools that are used by 
the organization to connect people to 
explicit knowledge and tacit 
knowledge—these include everything 
from e-mail, phone books, and 
meetings to technologies such as 
blogs, wikis, and podcasts; map 
how these technologies work within 
the IA and how they help the 
organization meet its strategic goals and 
objectives—use this information to 
guide KM strategy.

KM governance
Understand balancing the 
need to know with the 
need to share and how 
KM coexists with 
information management 
policy.
Accept that KM and content 
assurance must coexist and 
that secure KM takes into 
account the aspects of 
confidentiality, trust, and 
privacy management.
Balance the need to know with 
the need to share.
Develop security strategies, 
policies, plans, and 
procedures (comprehensive 
content governance plan) that 
not only address content 
management but also 
consider KM strategies and 
are tightly integrated with 
business strategies.
Understand that secure KM is much 
more than protecting classified 
information; security strategies, secure 
operation processes, and security 
metrics need to be incorporated into 
KM strategy and plans.
Organizational assets such as intellectual 
property, trade secrets, and privacy 
information need to be protected from 
malicious or unintentional access and 
use; ensure technology incorporates 
access controls, credential mechanisms, 
and encryption systems to secure KM 
practices.
Review existing content management 
policies; consider supplemental policies 
that incorporate security controls into 
the KM life cycle while maintaining 
appropriate access to knowledge. This 
should be part of the content 
governance plan and the subsequent 
development of the Content 
Governance Board.

KM Curriculum Development and Delivery
KM curriculum development and delivery must support the twenty-first century 
model of being able to learn anywhere, anytime, and on a varied number of plat-
forms, applications, and mobile devices.
To embark on the challenge of providing KM curriculum for the twenty-first 
century, the four pillars of KM were leveraged as a foundation by the KMEF 
(Green, 2011). These four pillars of KM are as follows:
 
1. Leadership: This deals with the environmental, strategic, and enterprise-level 
decision-making processes.
 
2. Organization: This deals with the operational aspects of knowledge assets.
 
3. Learning: This deals with behavioral aspects and social engineering of the 
organization.
 
4. Technology: This deals with the various information technologies that support 
and/or enable KM strategies and operations.
The curriculum must not only focus on concepts and theories but also on prac-
tical aspects (based on real-world implementation of KM), and how it is imple-
mented and used. The curriculum must also include the various methods, tools, 
applications, and systems that are developed and utilized to enable KM to be an 
actionable event. Another essential ingredient of KM curriculum development and 
delivery for the twenty-first century would be to incorporate the use of case stud-
ies, storytelling, affinity diagrams, knowledge cafés, and similar experience-sharing 
mechanisms.
This is the type of education that will lead to KM career enhancement, enrich-
ment, and planning. Other curriculum “basics” as pointed out by the KMEF to 
be included in KM are courses in measures and metrics, collaboration techniques, 
networking, and organizational development and effectiveness.
Teaching Philosophy/Methodology
The KM professional must be able to learn knowledge concepts and apply them 
in a variety of ways. KM education comes in a variety of forms to enable the 
KM professional to speed up on a particular concept and apply it to meet a spe-
cific need. Knowledge transfer, communities of practice (CoPs), capturing tacit 
and explicit knowledge, and KM governance are only a few of the concepts that 
today’s KM education must focus on to assist the KM professional in execution 
of their jobs.
My goal of instruction delivery has always been to improve student com-
prehension, application, and performance. It’s further based on the premise 
that learning should not occur in a haphazard way but should be developed in 

Knowledge Management Education ◾ 243
accordance with orderly processes, be specifically tailored to the target audience, 
and have measurable outcomes. To accomplish the goals set forth in the delivery 
of KM education, I have incorporated the use of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning. 
As a KM professor, I recommend Bloom’s Taxonomy to be part of any curricu-
lum that teaches KM.
Objectives of Bloom’s Taxonomy of Learning
The revised version of Bloom’s Taxonomy represents a taxonomy for learning, 
teaching, and assessing. This version describes six revised categories that include 
the following:
 
1. Remembering: Recall data or information. (for further details refer Table 13.3)
 
2. Understanding: Understand the meaning, translation, interpolation, and 
interpretation of instructions and problems. State a problem in one’s own 
words.
 
3. Applying: Use a concept in a new situation or unprompted use of an abstrac-
tion. Apply what was learned in the classroom into novel situations in the 
work place.
 
4. Analyzing: Separate material or concepts into component parts, so that their 
organizational structure may be understood. Distinguish between facts and 
inferences
 
5. Evaluating: Make judgments about the value of ideas or materials.
 
6. Creating: Build a structure or pattern from diverse elements. Put parts together 
to form a whole, with emphasis on creating a new meaning or structure.
This version of Bloom’s Taxonomy from Iowa State University Center of Excellence 
in Learning and Teaching (2012) includes an alignment of knowledge (see 
Figure 13.2). This alignment of knowledge, called “knowledge dimension,” identi-
fies four types of knowledge that learners are expected to acquire and/or construct. 
This knowledge includes (1) metacognitive—knowledge about when and how to use 
particular strategies for learning or for problem solving; (2) procedural— knowledge 
exercised in the performance of some task; (3) conceptual—knowledge rich in rela-
tionships and understanding; it is a connected web of knowledge, a network in 
which the linking relationships are as prominent as the discrete bits of information; 
and (4) factual—the basic elements students must know to be acquainted with a 
discipline or solve problems in it.
Bloom’s Six Cognitive Taxonomy Categories
Table 13.3 outlines each of the categories to include an example of the category and 
how it is demonstrated. In applying Bloom’s six cognitive taxonomy categories, we

KM Education Programs
Sometime ago, I had participated in a discussion and the associated comments on 
KM education, which included university courses (master’s programs), certification 
programs, and certificate programs. This discussion was hosted by Art Schlussel 
in the CKO Forum at LinkedIn. This discussion inspired me to elaborate on my 
thoughts concerning KM education. As I stated in my comments to Art, for any 
education to be effective, it must be supported by practical application, including 
having experienced mentors work with participants who have recently completed 
any number of various KM training programs.
In this discussion, Art mentioned that a partnership between the US military 
and a well-known accredited university to build a comprehensive KM training pro-
gram is in its preliminary stages. However, the major issue is what does or will this 
training consist of and the fact that the US military wants it to follow their KM 
competency model (see earlier).
I believe that the KM training should have a holistic approach, which will cover 
the following:
 
◾The basics of and differences between data, information, and knowledge
 
◾Establishing “your” definition of KM
 
◾Developing/executing KM strategy (including knowledge audits, knowledge 
mapping, and KM process)
 
◾Identifying and addressing knowledge gaps (result from knowledge audit)
 
◾Collaboration and knowledge sharing (CoPs)
 
◾Knowledge transfer planning (mentor–protégé relationship and knowledge 
codification)
 
◾Collecting/applying KM metrics
 
◾Identifying, planning, and executing KM projects/initiatives
 
◾KM tools (wikis, blogs, search, and KM systems)
Although this is not an exhaustive list, the approach must include planning, strate-
gies, and processes applied for KM as well as the software that will enable and suport 
the execution of the KM program initiatives. The US army’s KM competency model 
serves as a foundation to how the army will approach KM and forms the basis of 
what KM will address from the army’s perspective. The army’s enterprise KM com-
petency model represents a holistic approach to institutionalizing KM. I believe that 
a holistic approach to KM is where we must begin in our training as well as our 
execution of KM at our organizations.
KM at Institutions of Higher Education
You may not know that KM continues to be a growing discipline in which orga-
nizations are seeking qualified individuals. A master of science (MS) concentra-
tion in KM offers students an opportunity to enter the knowledge economy and

KM Certification Programs
KM certification programs are often designed for working professionals. These pro-
grams are leveraged to provide the tools and methods for understanding and imple-
menting KM relatively quickly. More often than not, the participants have specific 
issues in KM that they need to address and/or they are moved into a KM role not 
fully understanding what KM is really about, or how to be effective in their KM 
position. A good KM certification should be based on standards disseminated by 
the industry and professional KM organizations. Once the participant completes 
an in-class project and examination, it signifies that the individual is certified to 
meet certain standards or competencies related to successful implementation of 
KM, as prescribed by the profession. The following are three such programs, but 
this does not represent an exhaustive list of KM certification programs that are 
available:

KM education and educational programs:
 
◾When determining KM roles, responsibilities, and core competencies, lever-
age Table 13.1 as a guide.
 
◾For KM education to be successful, knowledge services and knowledge strat-
egy require an understanding of shared concepts and a mutual understanding 
about the elements and framework of KM.
 
◾When developing a KM educational program or looking for one, make sure 
that the KM program allows for some flexibility in its curriculum choices.
 
◾The curriculum must not only focus on concepts and theories but also on the 
practical aspects (based on real-world implementation of KM) as well as its 
implementation and use.

Chapter 14
“Big Knowledge!”: 
Knowledge Management 
and Big Data
A goal of knowledge management (KM) is to capture and share knowledge wher-
ever it resides in the organization. Leveraging the corporate collective know-how 
will improve decision making and innovation where it is needed. The proliferation 
of data, information, and knowledge has created a phenomenon called Big Data. 
KM when applied to Big Data will enable a type of analysis that will uncover the 
complete picture of the organization and be a catalyst for driving decisions. In 
order to leverage an organization’s Big Data, must be broken down into smaller 
more manageable parts. This will facilitate a succinct analysis, which can then be 
regrouped with other smaller subsets to produce big picture results.
Volume, velocity, and variety are all aspects that define Big Data.
Volume: It is the proliferation of all types of data expanding to many terabytes 
of information.
Velocity: It is the ability to process data quickly.
Variety: It refers to the different types of data (structured and unstructured data 
such as data in databases, content in content management and KM systems/
repositories, collaborative environments, blogs, wikis, sensor data, audio, 
video, click streams, and log files). Variety is the component of Big Data in 
which KM will play a major role in driving decisions. Enterprises need to be 
able to combine their analyses to include information from both structured 
databases and unstructured content.

256 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Data, Information, and Knowledge
Because the focus here is about leveraging KM techniques to extract knowledge from 
Big Data, it is important to understand the difference between data, information, and 
knowledge (see Figure 14.1). Data refers to a discrete set of facts that are represented 
by numbers and words. Information is an organized set of data (puts context around 
data). This can result in an artifact such as a stock report and news article. Knowledge, 
on the other hand, emerges from the receiver of information applying his/her analysis 
(aided by their experience and training) to form judgments in order to make 
decisions. Erickson and Rothberg indicate that information and data only reveal 
their full value when insights are drawn from them (knowledge). Big Data becomes 
useful when it enhances decision making, which in turn is only enhanced when 
analytical techniques and an element of human interaction is applied (Erickson and 
Rothberg, 2014).
In a February 26, 2014, KM World article titled “Big Data Delivering Big 
Knowledge,” Stefan Andreasen, chief technology officer at Kapow Software, Palo 
Alto, CA, indicates that “To gain a 360° view of their ecosystem, organizations 
should also monitor user-generated data, public data, competitor data and part-
ner data to discover critical information about their business, customers and 
competitive landscape” (Andreasen, 2014, p. 1). The user-generated data, public 
data, competitor data, and partner data provide the variety of data needed to be 
analyzed by KM, and it’s this type of data that will be examined more closely.
User-Generated Data
Customers are sharing information about their experience with products and 
services, what they like and don’t like, how it compares to the competition, 
Explicit/tacit

“Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management and Big Data ◾ 257
and many other insights that can be used for identifying new sales opportu-
nities, planning campaigns, designing targeted promotions, or guiding product 
and  service  development. This information is available in social media, blogs, 
 customer reviews, or discussions on user forums. Combining all these data con-
tained in call center records and information from other back-office systems can 
help identify trends, have better predictions, and improve the way organizations 
engage with customers (Andreasen, 2014).
Public Data
Public information made available by federal, state, and local agencies can be used 
to support business operations in human resources, compliance, financial plan-
ning, and so on. Information from courthouse websites and other state portals can 
be used for background checks and professional license verifications. Other uses 
include monitoring compliance regulation requirements, bill and legislation track-
ing, or in healthcare obtaining data on Medicare laws and, which drugs are allowed 
per state (Andreasen, 2014).
Competitor Data
Information about competitors is now widely available by monitoring their websites, 
online prices, press releases, events they participate in, open positions, or new hires. 
This data allows better evaluation of the competition, monitor their strategic moves, 
identify unique market opportunities, and take action accordingly. As a retailer, for 
example, correlate this data with order transaction history and inventory levels to 
design and implement a more dynamic pricing strategy to win over your competition 
and grow the business (Andreasen, 2014).
Partner Data
Across your ecosystem, there are daily interactions with partners, suppliers, ven-
dors, and distributors. As part of these interactions, organizations exchange data 
about products, prices, payments, commissions, shipments, and other datasets that 
are critical for business. Beyond the data exchange, intelligence can be gleaned by 
identifying inefficiencies, delays, gaps, and other insights that can help improve and 
streamline partner interactions (Andreasen, 2014).
To comb through the various sources of user-generated data, public data, com-
petitor data and partner data leveraging KM analytics (data analysis, statistics, and 
trend analysis), and content synthesis technology (technology that categorizes, 
analyze, combines, extracts details, and reassess content aimed at developing new 
meanings and solutions) will be necessary.

258 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Applying KM to Big Data
The emerging challenge for organizations is to derive meaningful insights from 
available data and reapply it intelligently. KM plays a crucial role in efficiently 
managing this data and delivering it to the end users to aid in the decision-making 
process. This involves the collection of data from direct, indirect, structured, and 
unstructured sources, and analyzing and synthesizing them to derive meaningful 
information and intelligence. Once achieved, the data must be converted into a 
useful knowledge base, storing it and finally delivering it to end users.
KM has the ability to integrate and leverage information from multiple per-
spectives. Big Data is uniquely positioned to take advantage of KM processes and 
procedures.
These processes and procedures enable KM to provide a rich structure, to enable 
decisions to be made on a multitude and variety of data. In the KM World March 
2012 issue, it was pointed out that “organizations do not make decisions just based 
on one factor, such as revenue, employee salaries, or interest rates for commercial 
loans. The total picture is what should drive decisions.” (p. 2) KM enables organiza-
tions to take the total picture Big Data provides, along with leveraging tools that 
provide processing speed to break up the data into subsets for analysis. This will 
empower organizations to make decisions on the vast amount and variety of data 
and information being provided.
As it pertains to KM and Big Data within organizations, the advancement of 
search technologies (see Chapter 4) on Big Data is making an impact. In KM World’s 
“100 Companies That Matter in Knowledge Management,” they point out that 
search technologies’ ability to implement, service, and manage Big Data environ-
ments is the key reason for their inclusion. The “findability” of information and 
knowledge within a large amount of unstructured data contribute to the ability to 
disseminate and reuse the knowledge of the enterprise.
Besides search technologies, there are several companies offering KM solutions 
to address Big Data. Some of these companies include CACI, which offers solu-
tions and services to go from data to decisions; Autonomy (an HP Company) offers 
KM solutions that mine unstructured data, tag this data, and where appropriate 
make it available to the knowledge base; and IBM offers a Big Data platform that 
includes KM to address Big Data’s vast amount of unstructured data. As organiza-
tions come to know more about Big Data and their management, and the use/reuse 
of the vast amounts of information and knowledge it provides, more software and 
consulting companies will provide the products and solutions organizations are 
looking for. Where is Big Data going? A 2013 Gartner Report stated that “Many 
global organizations have failed to implement a data management strategy but will 
have to as IT leaders need to support big data volumes, velocity, and variety,” as 
well as “decisions from big data projects for decision support, and insights in the 
context of their role and job function, will expand from 28% of users in 2011 to 
50% in 2014.”

“Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management and Big Data ◾ 259
An emerging opportunity to apply KM to Big Data will be realized within 
research institutions (see Chapter 5). During the innovation activities where product/
service development and R&D activities occur, several types of data are generated. 
Over a period, this proliferation of data, information, and knowledge is created in 
large  volumes, which may be processed and then used/reused within a knowledge 
repository. This knowledge can be accessed to provide, for example, real-time 
intelligence to the research and product development teams, and provide knowledge 
for customer insights as well as competitive intelligence.
Having this access brings about efficiencies in developing new products and 
services as well as improving existing ones. In order to realize these benefits, 
 organizations must start with a well-defined strategy to collect, store, synthesize, and 
disseminate knowledge in the form of product ideas, customer behavior patterns, 
voice of the customer (VotC), product trends from social networks, and listening 
platforms (among others).
Knowledge, when managed effectively, can help reduce project time, improve 
product quality, and increase customer satisfaction. In a knowledge-based orga-
nization, knowledge plays a crucial role in guiding the organization’s actions 
and establishing a sustainable competitive advantage. The data and  information 
that reside in the organization’s systems, if integrated, can create a significant 
Big Data opportunity that the organization can leverage to create value. This is 
accomplished through establishing platforms for collaboration between a vari-
ety of groups (employees, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders). This 
 collaboration links useful knowledge obtained through Big Data analysis with 
rules and logic that will help deliver knowledge faster at the right time and in the 
right content. Leveraging KM with Big Data analysis will also lead to a “correct-
the-first time” decision making, contain cost, and improve performance within 
and between your  collaborative groups.
Social Network Analysis
Making sense of a large amount of disorganized information that is spread across 
the organization has always been the defining challenge of KM. The ability for 
organizations to capture, analyze, and understand information about themselves, 
their customers, and every facet of their business from the various Big Data sources 
is an ongoing challenge! An important KM tool in aiding organizations to extract 
knowledge from Big Data sources is to perform social network analysis (SNA).
Social networks are evolving and growing stronger as forms of organization 
of human activity. SNA is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows 
between people, groups, organizations, computers, URLs, and other connected 
information/knowledge entities. The nodes in the network are the people and groups, 
whereas the links show relationships or flows between the nodes. SNA provides both 
a visual and a mathematical analysis of human relationships. This mapping present 

260 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
nodes of individuals, groups, organizations, and related systems that tie in one or 
more types of interdependencies; these include shared values, visions, and ideas; 
social contacts; kinship; conflict; financial exchanges; trade; joint membership in 
organizations; and group participation in events, among numerous other aspects of 
human relationships. To understand networks and their participants, we evaluate 
the location of actors in the network. Measuring the network location is finding the 
centrality of a node. These measures give us insight into the various roles and group-
ings in a network. This includes who are the connectors, mavens, leaders, bridges, 
isolates, as well as where the clusters are and who is in them.
In examining a social network, let’s look at two nodes that are connected 
as if they regularly talk to each other, or interact in some way. For example, 
Tony regularly interacts with Tanya, but not with Sandy. Therefore, Tony and 
Tanya are connected, but there is no link drawn between Tony and Sandy. This 
network effectively indicates the distinction between the three most popular 
individual centrality measures: degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and 
closeness centrality.
Degree Centrality
Social network researchers measure network activity for a node by using the 
 concept of degrees (the number of direct connections a node has). In the 
 following example, Chris has the most direct connections in the network, 
 making his node the most active in the network. He is a “connector” or “hub” in 
this network. Are more connections better? This is not always true. What really 
matters is where those connections lead to and how they connect the otherwise 
 unconnected. Here, Donald has connections only to others in his immediate 
cluster—her clique. She connects with only those who are already connected to 
each other (Figure 14.2).

“Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management and Big Data ◾ 261
Betweenness Centrality
Although Chris has many direct ties, Jason has few direct connections, yet he has 
one of the best locations in the network. He is between two important constituen-
cies. He plays a broker role in the network. The good news is that he plays a powerful 
role in the network; the bad news is that he is a single point of failure. Without him, 
Chris, Elissa, Davis, and Mark would be cut off from information and knowledge in 
Austin’s cluster. A node with high betweenness has a great influence over what flows 
and does not flow in the network (Figure 14.3).
Closeness Centrality
Jason has fewer connections than Chris, yet the pattern of his direct and indirect 
ties allows him to access all the nodes in the network more quickly than anyone 
else. He has the shortest paths to all others, and closer to everyone else. He is in an 
excellent position to monitor the information flow in the network and therefore has 
the best visibility into what is happening in the network.
Let’s take a look at other social network measures that contribute to  gaining 
knowledge from the relationships in your networks. These include network 
 centralization, network reach, network integration, boundary spanners, and 
 peripheral players.
Network Centralization
Individual network centralities provide insight into the individual’s location in the 
network. The relationship between the centralities of all nodes can reveal much 
about the overall network structure.
A very centralized network is dominated by one or a very few central nodes. 
If these nodes are removed or damaged, the network quickly fragments into uncon-
nected subnetworks. A highly central node can become a single point of failure.

Figure 14.3 Betweenness centrality.

262 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
A network centralized around a well connected hub can fail abruptly if that hub is 
disabled or removed. Hubs are nodes with high degree and betweenness centrality.
A less centralized network has no single points of failure. It is resilient in the 
face of many random failures—many nodes or links can fail while allowing the 
remaining nodes to still reach each other over other network paths. Networks of 
low centralization seldom fail.
Network Reach
Not all network paths are created equal. In many instances, the shorter paths in the 
network are more important (see Figure 14.4). It is also to be noted that networks 
have horizons over which we cannot see, nor influence. In these cases, the key paths 
in the network are 1 and 2 steps and on occasions, three steps to all connections 
(direct and indirect). Therefore, it is important to know who is in your network 
neighborhood, who you are aware of, and who can you reach (network reach).
Network Integration
Network metrics are often measured using shortest paths. This measurement makes 
the (often incorrect) assumption that all information and/or influence flows along 
the network’s shortest paths only. However, networks operate via direct and indirect, 
shortest, and near-shortest paths.
Boundary Spanners
Nodes that connect their group to others usually end up with high network metrics. 
Boundary spanners such as Austin and Jason are more central in the overall net-
work than their immediate neighbors whose connections are only local, within their 
immediate cluster. A boundary spanner occurs via your bridging connections to

“Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management and Big Data ◾ 263
other clusters or via your concurrent membership in overlapping groups. Boundary 
spanners are well positioned to be innovators, because they have access to ideas and 
information flowing in other clusters. They are in a position to combine different 
ideas and knowledge, found in various places, into new products and services.
Peripheral Players
Most people would view the nodes on the periphery of a network as not being very 
important. In fact, nodes such as Mark and David receive very low centrality scores 
for this network. Because individuals’ networks overlap, peripheral nodes are connected 
to networks that are not currently mapped. Mark and David may be contractors or 
vendors that have their own network outside of the company, making them very 
important resources for fresh information not available inside the company.
SNA Graph/Knowledge Map
The SNA graph presents similar information as a knowledge map. A SNA graph 
is a tool used in SNA to represent information about patterns of ties among social 
actors, while a knowledge map is a graphical representation of people in an organi-
zation or within a network, indicating their expertise and understanding and the 
key knowledge holders, indicating what knowledge is essential or at risk to be lost 
if someone is removed from the network/organization.
Social scientists use graphs as a tool for describing and analyzing patterns 
of social relations. Instead of taking a deep dive into the specific terminology, 
 presented here will represent some important ideas about social structure in a 
simpler more consumable manner. Once the basics have been mastered a deeper 
dive may be in order.
Graph theory provides a set of abstract concepts and methods for the analysis 
of graphs. This provides a visualization of social (as well as other) networks. As with 
knowledge maps, SNA graphs centers on relations between individuals, groups, 
and institutions. In studying a network in this manner, we are examining individu-
als as embedded in a network of relations rather than from an individual basis. 
Owing to the widespread availability of data, it is from this basis that SNA can be 
applied to a range of problems, including analyzing Big Data.
Social Media Networks
With the popularity of social media, many more people and groups are interacting. 
Through these interactions a proliferation of knowledge is created and shared. Social 
networks such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook facilitate a key component of KM: 
knowledge sharing. Through these networks a multitude of data can be analyzed, 
leading to enhanced decision making in many areas such as product marketing, and 
identifying key thought leaders and decision makers.

264 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
SNA is based on an assumption of the importance of relationships among 
interacting units. The social network perspective encompasses theories, models, 
and applications that are expressed in terms of relational concepts or processes. 
Along with growing interest and increased use of network analysis, there has been a 
consensus about the central principles underlying the network perspective. In addition 
to the use of relational concepts, we note the following as being important:
 
◾Actors and their actions are viewed as interdependent rather than independent, 
autonomous units.
 
◾Relational ties (linkages) between actors are channels for transfer or “flow” of 
resources (either material or nonmaterial).
 
◾Network models focusing on individuals view the network structural environ-
ment as providing opportunities for or constraints on individual action.
 
◾Network models conceptualize structure (social, economic, political, etc.) as 
lasting patterns of relations among actors.
The unit of analysis in network analysis is not the individual, but an entity consist-
ing of a collection of individuals and the linkages among them. Network methods 
focus on dyads (two actors and their ties), triads (three actors and their ties), or 
larger systems (subgroups of individuals, or entire networks), which social media 
networks provide.
Big Data Sources and KM
The use of Big Data and its analysis is very closely driven by the available technolo-
gies in the organization, and the tight integration between hardware and software 
and other data generation mechanisms. A Big Data strategy requires the ability to 
sense, acquire, transmit, process, store, and analyze the data to generate knowledge 
that can be stored in a repository for later use.
Analyzing Big Data and understanding where KM can play a role start with 
analyzing the data, information, and knowledge within enterprise-wide systems. 
These systems include but are not limited to knowledge repositories/portals, 
content management (CM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer rela-
tionship management (CRM), material requirements planning (MRP), product 
life cycle management (PLM), and product data management (PDM) systems 
(see Figure 14.5).
The knowledge that can be gained from these systems include tacit (by identify-
ing the key knowledge holders of the content, which in this reference includes 
information and knowledge) and explicit (through accessing the various types 
of market, technology, procedural, customer, and competitor knowledge that is 
captured and unstructured (see Table 14.1). Information and data are exchanged 
on a continuous basis with these systems as the product and services are being 

“Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management and Big Data ◾ 265
realized. The unconventional, unstructured information comes from several 
sources such as simulation, sensors, blogs, employee experience, wikis, and cus-
tomer experience and it should be harnessed.
Knowledge Classifications
Knowledge, in particular organizational knowledge, typically exists in large volumes 
dispersed across the enterprise. This lends itself to the fact that organizations need 
to find a way to discover, classify, capture, disseminate, and reuse this knowledge. 
Once the knowledge sources are discovered, an essential element to leverage KM in 
Big Data is to classify that knowledge.

266 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
According to Yuan, Yoon, and Helendar, knowledge areas are classified into 
four types, collectively referred to as M-H-T-P: market knowledge, human (tacit) 
knowledge, technology knowledge, and procedural (explicit) knowledge. Based on 
these four knowledge areas, Table 14.1 depicts the mapping of knowledge areas 
with elements of Big Data (Yuan et al., 2006).
Although a small part of this information flows back into the enterprise sys-
tems, attempts should be made to capture this in a central repository, typically a 
single data warehouse. A deliberate attempt must be made to keep the data together, 
so that the data can be combined to create information, which can be analyzed 
to generate knowledge that loops back to the knowledge repository and into the 
organization.

“Big Knowledge!”: Knowledge Management and Big Data ◾ 267
Information Architecture and Big Data
As detailed in Chapter 4, IA is the art and science of labeling and organizing infor-
mation, so that it is findable, manageable, and useful (Downey and Banerjee, 2010). 
IA also plays a significant role when applying KM to Big Data.
Big Data leverages techniques and technologies that enable enterprise to effec-
tively and economically analyze all of its data. We need to remember that Big 
Data includes all data (i.e., unstructured, semi-structured, and structured). The 
characteristics of Big Data (volume, velocity, and variety) are a challenge to your 
existing architecture, and how you will effectively, efficiently, and economically 
process data to achieve operational efficiencies.
In order to derive the maximum benefit from Big Data, organizations must 
modify their IT infrastructure to handle the rapid rate of delivery and extraction 
of a huge volume of data, with varying data types. These can then be integrated 
with the organization’s enterprise data and analyzed. Organizations, with legacy 
systems, must have a clear understanding of their historical data and how that data 
can be managed as a part of their overall Big Data picture.
IA provides the methods and tools for organizing, labeling, building relationships 
(through associations), and describing (through metadata) your unstructured content 
adding this source to your overall analysis. In addition, IA enables Big Data to rapidly 
explore and analyze any combination of structured and unstructured sources. Big 
Data requires IA to exploit relationships and synergies between information, aligning 
unstructured and structured data. This infrastructure enables organizations to make 
decisions utilizing the full spectrum of your Big Data sources.
To facilitate the inclusion of unstructured data (content), the metadata schema 
must be used (it is developed as part of the IA). Having a sound, IA will enable a 
consistent structure to Big Data in order for this data to provide value to the organi-
zation. The enterprise IA checklist will assist in enabling a consistent structure.
Elements of the enterprise IA checklist include content consumption, content gen-
eration, content organization, content access, content governance, and content quality 
of service. It is this framework (see Table 14.2) that will align your IA to Big Data, 
which will provide business value to be gained from all of your Big Data resources.
Some of the essential elements of the IA as it pertains to Big Data include the 
following:
Content consumption—which provides an understanding of the universe of rel-
evant content through performing a content audit. This contributes directly 
to volume of available content.
Content generation—which fills gaps identified in the content audit by gathering 
the requirements for content creation/generation. This in turn will contribute 
directly to increasing the amount of content that is available in the organiza-
tion’s Big Data resources.

all content. This contributes to the increasing volume 
of data that is available and in some ways leveraging 
existing data to assign metadata values.
This directly contributes 
to improvement in the 
speed at which content is 
accessed by applying 
metadata, which in turn 
will give context to the 
content.

Content access is about searching and establishing 
the standard types of search (i.e., keyword, guided,

additional metadata fields and values to enhance 
search.
This contributes to the 
ability to access content

content is accessed.
It contributes to the 
way the variety of

Content 
governance
The focus here is on establishing accountability for 
the accuracy, consistency, and timeliness of content; 
content relationships; metadata and taxonomy within 
areas of the enterprise; and the applications that are 
being used. Content governance will often “prune” 
the volume of content available in the organization’s 
Big Data resources by only allowing access to 
pertinent/relevant content, while either deleting or 
archiving other content.
When the volume of 
content available in the 
organization’s Big Data 
resources is trimmed 
through content 
governance, it will 
improve velocity by 
making available a 
smaller more pertinent 
universe of content.
When the volume of 
content available in 
the organization’s

the variety of

tent serves its distinct purpose, thereby being helpful to its audience and

Inclusion of additional types of data into the IA is needed. This includes semi- 
structured data (i.e., data coming from sensors such as RFID, location  information 
coming from the mobile devices, information from web logs, documents, and 
e-mails). These new data elements are often produced at much higher rates 
 compared to the classical transactional data. There is a lot more data coming in at 
much higher rates and enterprises need to be able to manage these new types of 
data and incorporate them into their overall IA framework. These new types of data 
are one of the new characteristics of Big Data.

272 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Key Learnings
The following represents some key learnings from KM and Big Data:
 
◾Don’t repeat solving the same problem. Perform root-cause analysis and focus 
your analytics to solve the “right problem!”
 
◾The same principle that knowledge still exists within an organization’s data 
still holds; however, the challenge is to manage the knowledge found by 
breaking it down into smaller consumable chunks and then bringing them 
together to form a complete picture.
 
◾There must be a cultural change to enable the belief that all of the individuals 
in an organization are owners of both their own and the company’s knowledge.
 
◾Workers today must be coached to manage, organize, and take responsibility 
(or held accountable) for their content (information and knowledge) that they 
create at every step of their work process.
 
◾Principles of KM are scalable as data grows.
 
◾The security, availability, scalability, and usefulness of the content can only be 
achieved by executing a comprehensive content and data governance strategy.

◾Detecting abnormal behavior patterns
 
◾Detecting trends through social media activities
 
◾Detecting suspicious activities
 
◾Identifying discrepancies in records across systems
 
◾Aligning your organization’s tacit knowledge (experts) to content (informa-
tion and knowledge) through expertise locators, assignment of authoritative 
voice as a metadata field/value is an essential part of extracting knowledge 
from your Big Data sources

“What Have You Done 
for the War Fighter 
Today?”: Knowledge 
Management in 
the Military
The twenty-first century military will be predominantly characterized by a rapid 
pace and use of technology. This technological change will require a military 
that is able to gather and process knowledge and make rapid decisions once that 
knowledge is vetted. In addition, the policies, practices, operating procedures, 
and other doctrines will need to be modified to address these advancements and 
use in technology. The use of unmanned drones is an example of this. The use of 
unmanned aircraft in the form of drones is being utilized to gather intelligence 
for military operations in the form of surveillance, air strikes, as well as crowd 
monitoring and control (Henriques, 2014).
The use of warfare technology highlights the rising importance of utilizing KM 
to create a military advantage over adversaries. New technologies have resulted in 
increasingly dynamic, unpredictable, and complex operations that require people to 
filter and analyze data, information, and knowledge from multiple sources. Problem 
solving and decision making are more complex and more essential in military situ-
ations especially with the advancements in technology. This type of warfare requires 
superiority at all levels of command and control. It demands situational awareness 

274 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
tools that are superior to those of opponents for anticipating reactions, knowledge 
gathering, problem solving, and superior decision making. A comprehensive KM 
strategy that enables continuous evolution in operationalization effectiveness is 
essential to attain and maintain knowledge superiority, know how, and expertise in 
executing military operations.
On the human resources side, the military, like their corporate counterparts, 
recognize the important role of intellectual capital in the modern military enter-
prise. Rapid technological advancement means that training must become faster 
and more effective. Time for learning is reduced. Additionally, demographic 
changes to the work force, and the loss of military knowledge suffered through 
reduced military spending in the 1990s, have had a long-term impact on the mili-
tary’s corporate memory. Military personnel are rotated through positions for both 
operational experience and career development. They acquire vast resources of 
tacit knowledge through their experience; upon leaving the military, the expertise 
acquired during their service unless captured is lost. KM can be applied to address 
this issue and apply the necessary solutions.
Continuing KM Challenge of BRAC
When it comes to the movement and the loss of military (enlisted and  civilian) 
personnel, base realignment and closure (BRAC) plays a significant role. BRAC 
presents the US military with a significant KM challenge. This is a human 
resources challenge that must be met in order for the US military to maintain its 
effectiveness. The BRAC specifically represents the challenge of capturing knowl-
edge both tacit and explicit before it leaves a command from personnel shifts 
and loss due to a BRAC move. The US military has already experienced this 
knowledge loss and unless steps are taken at least a year in advance of a BRAC 
or similar move, this loss will continue to happen. The loss of knowledge has the 
potential to compromise mission activities and the soldier in theater. Leveraging 
the US military’s ability to share knowledge through its established process and 
tools will help lessen the adverse impact of this knowledge loss. However, with-
out process and tools to capture, catalog, and reuse knowledge, the US military 
will be challenged to keep the various commands fully operational and effective 
in a long term for the solider in theater. At the end of the day, KM in the military 
must be focused on providing actionable intelligence in order to save lives and to 
successfully complete missions.
This chapter will examine three of the major branches of the military (army, air 
force, and navy), and how KM is being adopted and the practical applications of 
this adoption. This chapter will examine the KM strategy each branch is deploy-
ing through tactical implementation of KM programs, systems, and initiatives. 
Special attention to the past performance and future execution of BRAC or simi-
lar movements and the knowledge needs that this presents will also be detailed.

Included in this chapter will be my own experiences as it applies to the BRAC, 
KM policies, procedures, strategies, methods, and systems being deployed within 
the military.
Department of Defense Knowledge 
Management Structure
The Joint Chiefs of Staff organizational structure provides the impetus for driving 
and aligning KM throughout the military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff Department of 
Defense (DoD) structure aligns the KM efforts from all branches of the military 
(see Figure 15.1). The Joint Chiefs of Staff structure has established the knowl-
edge management cross-functional team (KM CFT). The KM CFT is a governing 
entity  responsible for improving KM across the Joint Staff (JS), as well as mentor-
ing and promulgating KM best practices across the services, combatant commands, 
and combat support agencies. The KM CFT ensures that lessons are learned and 
best practices are filtered up and across, while strategic guidance from the JS guides 
priority of effort.
The JS KM process has a bottom-up focus where lessons learned and best prac-
tices filtered up from the directorates, the services, combatant commands, and 
combat support agencies, while strategic guidance from the vice director of the JS 
guides priority of effort. To achieve this end, the KM CFT leverages the Knowledge 
Management Board (KMB) to develop the JS KM strategic roadmap and provide 
guidance and direction to the JS via the quarterly strategic guidance memorandum, 
in support of the Chairman’s strategic direction. The KMB also provides the author-
ity for staffing actions initiated by the services, combatant commands, and combat 
support agencies.
The designated lead for the KM CFT is the vice director of the JS. The Chief of 
the Information Management Division, Secretary Joint Staff (SJS IMD) will coor-
dinate the day-to-day activities, act as the secretary and provide secretariat support 
for the KM CFT to include ensuring that minutes are taken and published from 
each meeting of the KM Board, KM synchronization cell, content management 
working group, joint KM working group, and other working groups when cre-
ated. Each J-Dir and Director of Management (DOM) component will provide 
representation to the KM CFT.
KM Principles
The DoD understands that KM improves efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation 
across the JS and throughout the DoD. The DoD also understands that as a force, 
planning, training, operations, and engagement are improved/enhanced when the 
principles encapsulated in KM are applied (see Table 15.1).

KM Strategies in the US Army
Army Knowledge Management (AKM) is the Army’s strategy to transform itself into 
a net-centric, knowledge-based force, and an integral part of the Army’s transforma-
tion to achieve the future force. AKM will deliver improved information access 
and sharing while providing infrastructure capabilities across the Army so that war 
fighters and business stewards can act quickly and decisively. AKM connects people, 
knowledge, and technologies.
The goals of AKM are as follows:
 
◾Adopt governance and cultural changes to become a knowledge-based 
organization.
 
◾Integrate KM and best business practices into Army processes to promote the 
knowledge-based force.
 
◾Manage the infrastructure as an enterprise to enhance efficiencies and 
capabilities such as collaborative work, decision making, and innovation.
 
◾Institutionalize AKO/DKO as the enterprise portal to provide universal and 
secure access for the entire Army.
 
◾Harness human capital for the knowledge-based organization. The result 
of the AKM strategy is to align the Army enterprise knowledge and the 
information infrastructure with the DoD principles.
Table 15.1 KM Principles
KM Principles
 1. Train and educate KM leaders, managers, and champions.
 2. Reward knowledge sharing and make KM career rewarding.
 3. Establish a doctrine of collaboration.
 4. Use every interaction, whether face-to-face or virtual, as an opportunity to 
acquire and share knowledge.
 5. Prevent knowledge loss.
 6. Protect and secure information and knowledge assets.
 7. Use legal and standard business rules and processes across the enterprise.
 8. Embed knowledge assets (e.g., links, podcasts, videos, documents, 
simulations, and wikis) in standard business processes and provide access 
to those who need to know.
 9. Use standardized collaborative tools sets.
 10. Use open architectures to permit access and searching across boundaries.
 11. Use a robust search capability to access contextual knowledge and store 
content for discovery.
 12. Use portals that permit single sign-on and authentication across the global 
enterprise including partners.

278 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾Army organizations will develop communities of practice (CoPs) or 
 communities of interest (COIs) as an integral part of the transformation 
to a net-centric, knowledge-based force.
 
◾The use of online-secret (AKO-S) permits maximum sharing of Army infor-
mation and knowledge resources across the Army enterprise and reduces 
the need for investment in duplicative IT resources. Army activities require 
collaborative tools to successfully execute missions.
 
◾Use a single Army portal for authenticating Army users to gain access to 
enterprise systems and portals.
 
◾Active Army, Army Reserve, National Guard, civilian, and appropriate 
contractor personnel will make full use of online resources and capabilities.
 
◾All personnel must become familiar with the AKM strategy and goals. 
Commanders and activity heads must develop organizational initiatives to 
support the strategy and goals. The ability to store and find the right infor-
mation, at the right time, and to deliver it to the right customer must be 
a major focus at all levels of command and especially with the information 
management (IM)/IT community of service providers.
The Army CIO/G-6 will issue policy to ensure an enterprise focus to KM efforts 
with adherence to Army KM principles. Army commands and organizations will 
develop KM practices and systems with an enterprise perspective with the latitude 
to tailor KM practices to specific missions.
Army KM Principles
Any discussion of Army KM should include a discussion of the Army KM prin-
ciples that were signed by the Army Chief of Staff (General George W. Casey, Jr.) 
and the Secretary of the Army in 2008. The AKM principles are still in effect 
and have served as a basis for KM efforts in the Army and the Federal KM arena 
at large.
The Army KM principles create a consistent framework, so that war fighters and 
business stewards can innovate, evaluate alternate courses of actions within context 
of local conditions, and act quickly and decisively. The Army KM principles will 
help preserve tacit and explicit knowledge and accelerate learning as units and per-
sonnel rotate in and out of theaters or organizations. In addition, the Army KM 
principles anchor KM efforts as an Army-wide enterprise function.
The following are the Army KM principles. These principles align closely to the 
overall DoD KM principles.
People and Culture
Principle 1: Train and educate KM leaders, managers, and champions. This 
will create a culture of collaboration, which will be leveraged to educate 

KM in the Military ◾ 279
the next-generation KM change agents who understand KM principles 
and technologies and can effect change to accelerate meeting mission 
objectives. This will lead to improved curriculum development and 
instructional delivery methods identified to train and educate the force 
in KM competency at all levels of the Army.
Principle 2: Reward knowledge sharing and make knowledge management 
career rewarding. The Army supports the statement “what gets rewarded 
in organizations gets done” and reward structures guide organizational 
and individual behavior. This will establish KM career fields, where 
appropriate, and insert performance elements to evaluate knowledge 
sharing contributions.
Principle 3: Establish a doctrine of collaboration. This will create a  collaborative 
environment that fosters new ideas, understanding, and ways to exe-
cute the commander’s intent. It is the intent for Army leaders to incorpo-
rate the core principles of collaboration into their business procedures and 
human resources practices. This includes (1) responsibility to provide—
need to share should be replaced by responsibility to provide; (2) empowered 
to participate—soldiers and civilians are empowered to participate and 
share insights in virtual collaborative communities, without seeking prior 
permission; and (3) user driven—collaborative communities are self-defin-
ing, self-creating, and adaptable. Users own the collaborative community, 
not IT providers.
Principle 4: Use every interaction whether face-to-face or virtual as an 
opportunity to acquire and share knowledge. This is intended to foster 
continuous learning, and is an expected day-to-day activity. Learning 
faster than adversaries or competitors yields short- and long-term 
results. It is the expectation that Army leaders will frame day-to-day 
activities as learning opportunities to accelerate knowledge acquisition 
and transfer and promote learning in teams and in informal and formal 
social networks.
Principle 5: Prevent knowledge loss. The intent here is to understand that 
knowledge is perishable and it has a life cycle. The life cycle can’t begin 
until it is documented and assessed for its value. The Army assesses what 
is valuable from a past activity, document it, and share with those who 
need to know.
Process
Principle 6: Protect and secure information and knowledge assets. The intent 
is to deny adversaries access to key information that gives the US and 
coalition forces the decisive advantage to securely communicate and col-
laborate across geographic and organizational boundaries. This includes 
balancing risks regarding need to know against need to protect and requires 
leaders of knowledge communities to comply with relevant information 
assurance regulations and policies.

280 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Principle 7: Embed knowledge assets (links, podcasts, videos, documents, 
simulations, wikis, etc.) in standard business processes and provide access 
to those who need to know. The intent is to leverage digital media to 
add context, understanding, and situational awareness to operations and 
business activities. The Army insists that leaders creatively embed and use 
digital media (podcasts, videos, simulations, wikis, etc.) in training rou-
tines and operations to add to or leverage the existing knowledge assets of 
the Army. Convert intellectual capital (ideas, best known practices, etc.) 
to structural capital (anything that is digitized and accessible and search-
able by others). Verify content for legality and desired outcome.
Principle 8: Use legal and standard business rules and processes across the enter-
prise. The intent is to establish business rules and processes that are repeatable, 
thus reducing learning curves and promoting consistent quality products and 
services. The Army expects its leaders to follow standard business rules and 
processes set by the Army and the DoD. Modify and evolve business rules to 
meet the commander’s intent and quickly adapt business processes to meet 
or anticipate emerging threats or business opportunities (situational aware-
ness). The Army and across the DoD leverage lean six sigma and continuous 
process improvement principles within the KM discipline.
Technology
Principle 9: Use standardized collaborative tool sets. The intent is to use com-
mon collaborative software tool sets for training, which reduces training and 
maintenance costs while creating a common platform for data, information, 
and knowledge exchange in theaters and with other partners and organiza-
tions. It reduces impediments to search for relevant knowledge across the 
enterprise. This promotes the use of the approved Army and DoD collab-
orative tool sets. Train and deploy with them. Provide access to structural 
capital to accelerate learning curves and adopt/modify best known practices.
Principle 10: Use open architectures to permit access and searching across 
boundaries. The intent is to create seamless and ubiquitous service on 
demand, when one client application requests one or more services for 
another application that provides complimentary services. The goals here 
are for KM applications to be designed and operated with an enterprise 
focus, permitting access, and searching across systems and organizations 
without technical or structural impediments.
Principle 11: Use a robust search capability to access contextual knowledge 
and store content for discovery. With the exception of classified informa-
tion, the Army expects knowledge bases to be accessible and searchable 
by search engines that deliver contextual knowledge and information. As 
the Army delivers and operates its KM systems, leaders through the use of 
appropriate content management principles need to ensure that there are 
no organizational or technical barriers blocking access to digital media 
residing in knowledge bases.

KM in the Military ◾ 281
Principle 12: Use portals that permit single sign-on and authentication across 
the global enterprise including partners. The Army will utilize authenti-
cation across its enterprise portal for access to lessen confusion for users 
and provide a standard process for accessing enterprise knowledge assets 
while reducing total cost of ownership of other portals, websites, or 
knowledge networks.
Army Knowledge Online
Army Knowledge Online (AKO; see Figure 15.2) represents the Army’s information 
sharing environment offering a robust KM system and access to a network of enter-
prise services for Army personnel that will facilitate communication, collaboration, 
and the free exchange of ideas. This environment also provides access to more than 
1200 applications that include e-mail, directory services, blogs, file storage, instant 
messenger, chat, and business process management capabilities as well as links 
and access to other related Army websites (e.g., Army Training Requirements and 
Resources System [ATRRS], Interactive Personnel Electronic Records Management 
System [iPERMS], and Medical Protection System [MEDPROS]).
Current Army KM Direction
Current Army KM direction as stated in the Department of the Army US Army Corps 
of Engineers 2015 KM Strategic Plan includes the US Army Corps of Engineers 
(USACE) development of an enterprise-wide integrated KM strategy to promote 
and drive quality and improve performance across the organization. As the world’s

largest public engineering, design, and construction management agency, more 
than 37,000 USACE personnel manage dams, canals, and flood protection proj-
ects throughout the United States, as well as a wide range of public works throughout 
the world. The strategy will drive a program that provides approaches, methods, and 
tools that enable KM best practices and promote the flow of actionable information 
with the goal of capturing critical knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce, 
transferring knowledge between teams, and improving collaboration and learning 
across the USACE enterprise. This strategy establishes the roadmap to how KM is 
implemented across the Department of the Army and creates an Army-wide picture 
of KM benchmarks and best practices.
KM Strategies in the US Air Force
Timely, accurate, and relevant information is imperative for planning and conducting 
air, space, and cyberspace operations within the Air Force. A lack of decision-ready, 
actionable knowledge degrades the Air Force’s ability to conduct and support opera-
tions with the certainty required to support national military objectives. Turning raw 
data into information that enables the creation and transfer of knowledge requires 
an approach of careful collaboration, analysis, deliberation, and judgment. Air Force 
KM supports this approach by using a combination of technology, processes, and 
people to achieve mission superiority.
KM provides war fighters with the capability to rapidly access and exploit 
authoritative, accurate, and relevant information to plan CoAs and execute  missions. 
This specifically includes virtual collaboration, tailored information presentation, 
integrated data and information, locating and accessing relevant information, 
 sharing information and knowledge, managing information, and intelligence IA. 
This enables sharing of information and knowledge among CoI, CoP, and coalition 
partners in a common, collaborative information environment, supporting network 
services, improved search engine technologies, and integration of knowledge man-
agers and training.
According to Jaggers (2014) of Air Force Public Affairs Agency, the Air Force 
revamped the KM career field, aiming to make its airmen into some of the service’s 
top innovators working in newly established KM centers Air-Force-wide.
The KM career field split, announced in 2014, moved 80 percent of its air-
men to the new Administration Air Force Specialty Code 3A1 × 1. Approximately 
20 percent of airmen currently assigned to the KM AFSC 3D0 × 1 will remain, 
becoming a more specific, technically honed specialty.
According to Chief Master Sergeant Robert Jackson, KM career field  manager, 
KM will undergo a significant technical training ramp-up to meet the chal-
lenge of making airmen into top innovators across the Air Force. They employ 
a  process improvement mindset, analyze mission requirements, and recommend 

KM in the Military ◾ 283
 solutions. They are the consultants, trainers, and facilitators to connect people to 
the  information they need. “The idea is to help airmen avoid searching through 
mountains of digital data to find what they’re looking for,” said Jackson (Jaggers 
2014). “The real goal is capturing and reusing the wisdom, experience and les-
sons we learn over time.”
In 2014, the Secretary of the Air Force’s Chief Information Officer, Lt. Gen. 
Michael Basla, sponsored a pilot program to evaluate KM outreach in 15 organizations 
spanning the Air Force and Air National Guard, yielding promising results. “The 
pilot proved that real innovation can happen when we connect process improve-
ment and technology,” Basla said. “We are not just applying new technology to old 
processes, but rather looking to improve the process itself, harnessing our airmen’s 
intellectual capital to enhance mission effectiveness.”
One pilot KM center at Dover Air Force Base, Del., reinvented a process for 
producing thousands of letters of appointment. They used Microsoft SharePoint 
capabilities to produce an appointment letter management tool, cutting back on 
numerous hours and resources.
“If this kind of improvement can be made with appointment letters, imagine 
what is possible with our critical mission and business systems,” Jackson said. “Airmen 
spend a lot of time on old paper-era processes, so KM can really help.”
Air Force KM Goals and Objectives
The following represents the goals and objectives set forth by the implementation 
and execution of Air Force KM as mandated in the Air Force Instruction 33–396 
7 November 2014 Communications and Information Knowledge Management:
 
◾Decision superiority: Provides decision makers with a competitive advantage, 
enabled by an ongoing situational awareness
 
◾Information superiority: The degree of dominance in the information domain 
that allows friendly forces the ability to collect, control, exploit, and defend 
information while denying this ability to opposing forces
 
◾Improved individual and shared awareness of the operational environment: 
Allows Air Force, joint, and coalition information exchange and enables 
coordinated operations across all spectrums
 
◾Constantly evolving team-based learning: Transforms the Air Force into a 
learning organization using continuous innovation to steadily feed new 
information, ideas, and concepts into an expanding base of tacit and explicit 
knowledge
 
◾Optimized knowledge processes: The integration of knowledge principles in 
work environments assists airmen with optimizing their mapped processes 
through various KM methodologies and techniques

284 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
 
◾Seamless access and unified communications: Provide organizations’ access 
to relevant information anywhere and anytime irrespective of hardware or 
 software platforms utilized
 
◾Knowledge assessment and prioritization: Evaluate classification, sensitivity, 
 mission criticality, and required levels of access for incoming data,  information, 
and knowledge to ensure compliance with required management, handling, 
and security standards and practices
 
◾Capabilities: Through effective network services and a common collaborative 
information exchange, KM affords a specific set of capabilities. Success in 
KM is measured by the degree in which these capabilities are available and 
leveraged within an organization
 
◾Virtual collaboration: KM provides meaningful situational awareness to all 
leadership levels through the ability to globally monitor, display, store, distrib-
ute, access, and share information and knowledge
 
◾Tailored information presentation: KM connects airmen to authoritative, 
accurate, and relevant information by using an airman’s role-based attributes 
provided and tracked automatically by EIS
 
◾Integrated data and information: The information environment supports 
the integration of relevant information from multiple sources and produces 
improved situational awareness for airmen, based on their role-based attri-
butes and responsibilities
 
◾Locate, assess, and refine information: Airmen can locate required information, 
extract it, determine its veracity and relevancy, and manipulate it to further 
support mission goals. This also includes the ability to determine the authority 
of information and information services by identifying the source, currency, 
and conditions of use
 
◾Identify, store, share, and exchange information and knowledge: Airmen can 
identify, store, share, and exchange information and knowledge for collabora-
tion and situational awareness. They are able to do this with other Air Force 
members, as well as joint and coalition partners, as required
 
◾Manage information from creation to final disposition: Airmen have the ability 
to store and manage all types of information and knowledge from creation 
to final disposition. This includes all actions necessary to store and  maintain 
structured and unstructured information. Critical to this concept is the 
 capability to identify and reuse authoritative information from multiple func-
tional areas to eliminate redundant and potentially conflicting information. 
An integrated enterprise-wide metadata repository and services are essential to 
effective information discovery and accessibility
 
◾Information architecture: An established IA is essential to establish standard-
ized criteria, processes, and procedures to store and share data, information, 
and knowledge, including cross-security domain solutions that connect Air 
Force capabilities with different environments and functional areas

Air Force Knowledge Now
Air Force Knowledge Now (AFKN) is a web-based collaborative environment 
developed by the Triune Group for the US Air Force (USAF; see Figure 15.3). From 
1999 to 2012, AFKN grew to more than 19,000  CoPs and 400,000  members. 
In 2004, Air Force CIO John M. Gilligan designated AFKN the Air Force 
Center of Excellence for KM, making it the USAF’s only certified and  accredited 
 enterprise-wide KM program. By focusing on social, behavioral, and cultural 
aspects of knowledge sharing, AFKN evolved beyond traditional KM systems, 
which focused on capturing information through technology.
The Triune Group has been the prime contractor for the AFKN program since 
2004. Although the AFKN site has been shutdown and transitioned to Air Force 
Net (AFNet) effective August 1, 2013, the USAF extended the AFKN contract 
through 2015.

net/joannhague/walkingincloudshaguefinal; https://afkm.wpafb.af.mil.)

286 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
The program had the following two focus areas:
 
1. Collaboration suite: Provides management and maintenance of the AFKN 
application; a web-based platform providing knowledge sharing and 
 collaboration through virtual workspaces (called CoP) offering Web 
2.0 functionality. The AFKN approach has always been technology agnos-
tic, and the program has embraced new technologies as they have become 
available
 
2. KM services: Provides consulting services throughout the Air Force to help 
organizations design and implement knowledge-centric solutions, typically 
on the AFKN application. These solutions include KMMM, knowledge 
retention and transfer (KRandT) process, and KM workshops (taxonomy 
development, implementation, governance, etc.)
KM services capabilities that support AFKN included the following:
 
◾Comprehensive workshops
 
◾Online virtual collaboration and sharing
 
◾Robust document management
 
◾Expertise locators
 
◾Integrated e-learning
 
◾Search/discovery
 
◾Shared network folders
 
◾Threaded discussion forums
 
◾Validated practices library
KM Strategies in the US Navy
The KM strategy for the Department of the Navy (DON) identifies goals and 
objectives for continued KM implementation throughout the DON. At the DON 
departmental level, KM is defined as the integration of people and processes, 
enabled by technology, to facilitate the exchange of operationally relevant informa-
tion and expertise to increase organizational performance.
Although Navy and Marine Corps personnel have shared information and 
collaborated since the services began, KM as a recognized discipline with explicit 
processes has been pursued only for the past 15 years in the DON. Numerous 
DON commands have benefitted from the implementation of KM processes, 
procedures, and programs. An updated KM strategy is necessary to keep up the 
momentum.
Most KM efforts can be grouped into two overlapping categories: command sup-
port and commander support. Command support links people to who they need to 
know and what they need to know to do their jobs better. It seeks to stop reinventing 

KM in the Military ◾ 287
the wheel and to take advantage of the DON’s tremendous experience and intellectual 
capital. Commander support includes efforts to ensure that there is a
 
◾Common understanding of the Commander’s intent from the headquarters 
to the tactical edge or furthest echelon.
 
◾Shared situational awareness with all concerned.
 
◾Process to provide the information and knowledge requisite for timely, high-
quality decisions.
The tenets of KM are a significant complement to the next generation enterprise 
network, the joint information environment, and every other environment that 
connects people and information.
The DON vision for KM is to create, capture, share, and reuse knowledge to 
enable effective and agile decision making, increase the efficiency of task accom-
plishment, and improve mission effectiveness. To achieve this vision, the DON 
KM community will continue to share and leverage the significant KM experience 
and resources existing within the department. Currently, DON KM is a centralized 
vision executed through decentralized implementation.
The goals and objectives for DON KM are to
 
1. Continue to expand departmental awareness that KM applied to opera-
tional and business processes will enable significant improvements in mission 
accomplishment.
 
2. Instill KM principles and methodologies into the DON culture. This includes 
the following:
– Expanding and supporting the DON KM CoP and other KM 
stakeholders
– Sharing experiences, key learnings, and results to foster collaboration, 
enable shortened learning cycles, and assist other efforts.
– Providing KM training and education across the department. Include KM 
material in appropriate Navy and Marine Corps training courses
– Assisting those new to KM to expeditiously locate the support and 
resources needed to gain an understanding of KM
 
3. Maximizing the utility of existing DON KM experience and resources. This 
includes the following:
– Assisting commands in building upon the KM experiences and resources 
of others
– Collect; catalogue; and advertise existing plans, documents, topical guides, 
and other resources to assist command KM programs and projects
– Maximizing utility of existing technology resources (those already paid 
for) to support KM implementation
 
4. Drive toward a more centrally supported universally available and executed 
DON KM program

288 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
According to Mr. Jim Knox, DON CIO KM team lead, the DON continues to 
“support the use of KM principles and methodologies as an enabler to improve 
war fighting and business processes. Though KM is driven by the specific mission 
requirements and needs of individual commands, it is important to continue to 
share KM know-how and lessons learned across the department. In the current fis-
cally challenging environment, commands should recognize the benefits of KM as 
an enabler to facilitate mission accomplishment” (Jaggers 2014).
Some of the guiding principles of KM established by the Navy include the 
following:
 
◾KM must align with the commander’s vision and mission.
 
◾Enable knowledge capture, sharing, and collaboration.
 
◾Improve Navy performance using the people, and tools available to them.
 
◾KM is critical to integrating disparate functions and units, including func-
tional silos, geographically dispersed domain members, and critical strategic 
initiatives.
 
◾Follow the knowledge management maturity model (KMMM). This 
model served as a road map to guide us through the KM process. The 
KMMM was based on the same concept as the capability maturity model 
for software.
 
◾Effectively communicate and collaborate. Implementation of collaborative 
tools that would allow sharing of documents and enable collaboration
 
◾Utilize standardized administrative processes.
 
◾Foster an environment of continuous improvement, innovation, and learning. 
KM uses CoP as cross-functional teams that can sustain change and focus on 
the quality of knowledge flows, assets, and key learnings.
Navy Knowledge Online
Navy Knowledge Online (NKO) is the Navy’s knowledge portal used by active 
duty, reserve, and retired enlisted and officers of the US Navy (see Figure 15.4). 
NKO provides information and resources such as career management, personal 
development, and leadership. Allowing Navy retired personnel access to NKO 
increases the pool of knowledge available that can be shared between current active 
duty and reserve personnel. Sharing knowledge is primarily done through the 
NKO forum. The NKO Community of Practice (CoP) program provides the ideal 
way for Navy personnel to share their knowledge. The CoP facilitates sharing of 
best practices, advice, and expertise in organizational, functional, and operational 
knowledge in a specific interest group. The focus is on continuous learning, mutual 
exchange, and collaboration.

KM in the Military ◾ 289
KM and BRAC
The Congress established the 2005 BRAC Commission to ensure the integrity 
of the base closure and realignment process. At the onset of a BRAC movement, 
there will be many personnel who will not transition with the command as it 
moves to their new location. Losing these personnel will cause a gap in both tacit 
and explicit knowledge. Leveraging KM in support of BRAC movements will 
provide a mechanism to capture and retain this knowledge for the command as it 
transitions. This paper will focus on the KM principles, practices, and techniques 
to transition knowledge from individuals and make it available as a corporate 
knowledge asset that can be retrieved, examined, and leveraged by the entire 
command.
A BRAC move has to synchronize people, the information systems they use and 
the knowledge they have. The organization (command) experiencing the BRAC 
must carefully manage the change and the transition with precise planning and 
Figure 15.4 Navy Knowledge Online portal main page. (http://www.slideshare.

home.)

290 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
attention to detail. There must be a realization of what roles/positions are and are 
not transitioning along with an understanding of the effect of what losing knowl-
edge would do for the command and how this will be addressed.
One of the objectives of the BRAC is to transition and execute change man-
agement without an interruption or dilution of mission services and/or activities. 
An essential component of this is the personnel and the knowledge they possess 
to effectively carry out the missions of the command. Capturing, cataloging, and 
retaining critical knowledge of the command before it leaves during a BRAC move 
are at the core of applying KM to BRAC movements. The problem occurs because 
the loss of knowledge will have an adverse effect on the missions and the activities 
of the command that can be detrimental to the personnel in theater. The solution 
will be to apply KM as a mechanism to capture and retain this knowledge for the 
command and make it available as a corporate knowledge asset that can be retrieved, 
examined, and leveraged by the entire command. This knowledge should continue 
to be updated after the BRAC is completed.
Summary of Contributing Factors
Table 15.2 outlines the key contributing factors related to the opportunity/problem 
the BRAC presents.
Addressing the BRAC Problem
To begin to address this problem of potential loss of knowledge, a KM strategy 
must be created. Creating a KM strategy presents a holistic approach to capturing, 
cataloging, and making available the various knowledge assets of the command. 
Creating a single integrated knowledge repository is a major deliverable for catalog-
ing and making available the various knowledge assets. This knowledge repository 
should support the KM principles as depicted in Table 15.1.
The critical task for the command is to determine what knowledge they 
should retain and share. KM content management should link to what people 
know, and how they use the knowledge to support the mission, objectives, and 
activities of the command. It draws on human competency, intuition, ideas, 
and motivations. It is not a technology-based concept even though utilizing 
the  correct technology KM tools is important. The short-term KM goal for the 
command is to determine what knowledge to collect from its personnel who are 
going to leave prior to the final BRAC move while supporting the long-term 
KM goal to refine and implement the strategic KM plan. The final state of KM 
at the command will provide enterprise knowledge and services that are neces-
sary to improve operations and decision making across the command. Table 15.3 

KM in the Military ◾ 291
presents a BRAC chart showing possible KM needs, goals, and objectives for 
Stakeholders for potential services.
The KM program for the command will optimize the organization, exchange, 
currency, and accessibility of knowledge so that personnel spend less time looking 
for what they need in order to make critical decisions and complete the mission. 
The KM efforts and initiatives will add value by
 
◾Facilitating better, more informed decisions.
 
◾Contributing to the intellectual capital of the organization.
 
◾Encouraging the free flow of ideas that leads to insights and innovation.
 
◾Eliminating redundant processes and streamlining operations.
 
◾Improving efficiency and overall productivity.
Table 15.2 Contributing Factors to Capturing Knowledge
#
Contributing Factors
Effect on Organization
1
Some personnel will not 
transition to the new location
Cohesiveness of mission activities 
could be compromised because of 
lack of skilled personnel
2
Explicit knowledge (SOP’s, 
lessons learned, templates, 
examples) not properly 
captured and cataloged
Loss of documented knowledge that 
could compromise the effectiveness 
and efficiency of personnel 
performing the job at the new location
3
Tacit knowledge (specific know 
how from experienced 
personnel) not properly 
captured and cataloged
Loss of knowledge (specific “know 
how”) that could compromise the 
effectiveness and efficiency of 
personnel performing the job at the 
new location
4
Lack of understanding of who 
are the key knowledge 
holders and what knowledge 
they possess
Potential of losing key personnel with 
substantial knowledge of mission 
critical activities. This personnel has a 
high impact on the effectiveness and 
success of missions/activities once the 
BRAC is completed
5
Lack of understanding of the 
“knowledge gaps” that will 
exist once the BRAC 
transition is made
Understanding and identifying the gaps 
in knowledge will enable the command/
organization to plan and execute a 
strategy to fill these gaps. This strategy 
could consist of training, additional 
skilled personnel (temp employees), 
new hires, creating SOP’s, etc.

294 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Any KM program will need to concentrate on developing the following practices 
among individuals and groups, and must be reflected in management processes and 
behaviors, becoming an integral part of the organizational culture:
 
◾Recognition and valuing of individual knowledge
 
◾Recognition and valuing of knowledge held by others
 
◾An enthusiasm to search for new knowledge
 
◾The skills to search for that new knowledge
 ◾An enthusiasm for sharing knowledge with others, and a capacity to link personal 
and shared knowledge to organizational goals and performance
A well-structured and consistent approach to facilitating knowledge capture, cata-
loging, and retention within the command is needed to support the diversity of 
content and the locations where it resides; there is tremendous content in both 
physical repositories and within the minds of individuals. Understanding and 
managing that content so that it can be shared and applied is vital to increasing 
overall effectiveness of personnel.
An understanding of the knowledge and content being managed is an essential 
first step to enable effective knowledge capture, cataloging, and retention. Raw 
data can be transformed to increasing levels of trust and authority through the 
application of cognitive practices of the command. This results in a spectrum of 
knowledge that must be managed through structured practices and business rules 
so that there is cohesion of understanding and application.
The knowledge and content that must be understood and managed range from 
the unexpressed or tacit that is in the heads of individuals across the  spectrum 
of the command to the formal, approved content such as regulations and manu-
als. At each level, the authority and trust of the material are balanced by the risk 
of applying that content. There is little risk in following a regulation, whereas 
applying an observation that is provided verbally from a peer may be considered 
potentially risky.
As the KM BRAC process is worked, it will benefit from a well-defined 
knowledge/content hierarchy and knowledge capture, and transformation rules. 
These provide a framework that is at the core of the KM BRAC process and tool.
Missed KM Opportunity of BRAC
Impending BRAC moves have the potential to bring considerable personnel turn-
over, which will lead to knowledge loss and gaps in operations. During my time in 
executing BRAC movements within the military, there was a missed opportunity 
when it came to adequately capturing and cataloging knowledge loss to enable 
reuse. To close this gap, there are several steps that need to be considered. These 
steps include the following:

KM in the Military ◾ 295
 
1. Determining existing and potential sources, flows, and constraints including 
environmental factors that could influence knowledge flow
 
2. Identifying and locating where the explicit and tacit knowledge exists
 
3. Creating a knowledge map depicting the flow of knowledge within the 
organization
 
4. Identifying what knowledge is missing within the organization that is needed 
in order to achieve stated goals and objectives and who needs the missing 
knowledge within the organization to effectively perform their duties
 
5. Identifying possible improvements and recommendations regarding KM 
activities within the organization
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾One of the takeaways from this chapter is about how the military structures 
KM to be aligned to the overall DoD principles and structure, with a focus 
on the individual KM principles of each branch. KM by design is given a 
strategic alignment with a specific tactical focus depending on the needs of 
the particular branch of the military.
 
◾All organizations can learn from the DoD structure of KM and apply it 
by aligning KM to the overall corporate strategy, enabling KM through 
senior leadership support (C-suite executive support), and aligning spe-
cific KM strategies and tactical implementations across departments to the 
overall policies and objectives stated in the organization’s enterprise KM 
strategy.
Tips and Techniques
The following are some tips and techniques that stood out from this chapter:
 
◾The chart indicating KM needs, goals, and objectives for stakeholders is a 
good tool to utilize for BRAC initiatives, and it can be applied to any KM 
initiative that focuses on determining the knowledge to capture and the 
knowledge services that are required to improve operations and decision 
making.
 
◾Developing an understanding of contributing factors to capturing knowl-
edge as indicated in Table  15.2 is an essential tool in understanding 
the effect of knowledge loss and what has to occur in order to capture 
knowledge.
 
◾When the organization knows that a location move is eminent, the need 
to capture, catalog, and store knowledge from individuals that may leave 

296 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
the organization becomes imperative. Understanding this from experience, a 
knowledge transfer/capture effort must start anywhere from six months to a 
year in advance of the move. This timeframe is established to adequately vali-
date the knowledge being captured and to ensure individuals will be engaged 
and incentivized long enough to transfer their know how.

Drinking the Knowledge 
Management 
Kool-Aid: Knowledge 
Management Adoption
“Drinking the KM Kool-Aid” is a metaphor to indicate the adoption of KM (program, 
policies, procedures and the methods, and systems that enable it) throughout your 
organization. KM is a multidisciplinary approach to enabling the right knowledge, 
to get to the right people, in the right context, and at the right time. This knowl-
edge can be tacit (in the minds of individuals) and/or explicit (written down/docu-
mented in various forms, for example, knowledge articles, frequently asked questions 
(FAQs), job aids, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and key learnings). To enable 
knowledge to flow quickly through your organization and to support the processes and 
procedures that have been defined, the implementation of methods (i.e., knowledge 
sharing, collaboration, knowledge capture, and knowledge reuse), and the governance 
(maintenance and management) of your knowledge assets, a systems (KMSs), must be 
deployed. So, in this case, adoption will have to occur at many levels within the ecosys-
tem of your organization’s KM structure.
Once the need for a KM program has been determined, immediately after its 
official launch, efforts must be on the way to initiate its adoption. In order to ini-
tiate the adoption of your KM program, an effort to market the program and its 
various components has to be an intentional endeavor.
Marketing and communication are critical ongoing activities that are 
aimed at creating awareness and spreading the system benefits to the end user. 

298 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
A  high-impact and effective marketing campaign should be included in the 
 project plan both during and after a system launch. Marketing will help create a 
buzz about the KMS and also help showcase the success that has been achieved. 
Marketing strategy should ensure that all user segments and stakeholders of the 
project are impacted.
Communication Channels
The following channels should be leveraged for communicating the KM program 
and need to be detailed in the communications plan:
 
◾Newsletter: Created by the marketing team and published monthly. Using an 
interview format, a feature article is written by a reporter from the team. The 
article is then written and published in the newsletter.
 
◾News brief: Published once a week. The content is coordinated and submitted 
to the communications team.
 
◾Leadership thought message: Part of newsletter. A message is highlighted once a 
month from one of the leadership teams. A schedule for the year is created at 
the start of each year by the communications team and the chief information 
officer. Topics of messaging are left to the monthly leader but recommended 
by the communications team.
 
◾Project manager forum and mentoring sessions: Mentoring sessions are held 
daily for any PMs requiring assistance. The project management office 
(PMO) also holds project management forums periodically for sharing major 
news and addressing process efficiency issues pertaining to the KM program.
 
◾Town hall meetings: Everyone are invited to attend town hall meetings, which 
can be scheduled as needed. Schedules and marketing of these meetings are 
coordinated through the communications and marketing teams.
 ◾Corporate broadcast messaging: Advertisement agency type static messages flashed 
via the corporate intranet. This is utilized to drive corporate associates to news 
brief and newsletter articles and also to create awareness to events (e.g., town 
hall meetings). The communications team creates the actual visuals and controls 
pushing those out to the organization. This is an essential vehicle that should be 
utilized to socialize the KM program and energize the adoption process.
Adoption Activities
In an effort to socialize and adopt your KM program inclusive of its policies, prac-
tices, methods, and systems, there are certain activities that will impact in a positive 
way on the success of your adoption efforts. The following is a representation of 
some of these activities:

KM Adoption ◾ 299
 
◾Lunch-n-learn: At its simplest, a learning at lunch program is a training (or 
learning) event scheduled during the lunch hour. The attendees bring their 
lunches and eat them during the presentation session. The training is usually 
less formal and less structured than normal. This promotes a comfortable 
atmosphere where the attendees feel free to not only learn from the presenter 
but also share knowledge among themselves.
 
◾Knowledge café (see Chapter 5): A knowledge café is a means of bringing a 
group of people together to have an open, creative conversation on a topic 
of mutual interest to surface their collective knowledge, to share ideas and 
insights, and to gain a deeper understanding of the subject and the issues 
involved. As a KM tool, a knowledge café is used to share tacit knowledge. 
The knowledge café can be used within teams, communities of practice 
(CoP), across several teams both colocated and distributed, to help facilitate 
learning from others and gain a deeper collective understanding of a subject 
through interactive conversation.
 
◾Business social: Business social represents utilizing social media capabilities 
within the organization. Social media has become an important consequence 
to organizational communication processes because social media concepts 
and tools afford behaviors that were difficult or impossible to achieve in 
combination before these new technologies entered the workplace (Treem & 
Leonardi, 2012). These technologies speak to the way people interact outside 
of the corporation and enable a familiar and effective way to promote aware-
ness of the KM program and positively influence its adoption.
Key Adoption Challenges
With any effort there will be some challenges to a successful adoption. These 
adoption challenges will be analyzed and detailed in this chapter. Typically, the 
adoption challenges faced during the lifetime of the KM program are as follows:
 
◾Unclear KM strategy
 
◾Lack of personal return on investment (ROI)
 
◾Lack of organizational culture
 
◾Lack of organizational commitment
 
◾Failure to communicate effectively
 
◾Poor maturity of tool deployed
In this chapter, an examination of the communication and marketing efforts to 
 support adoption will be presented in detail. Also, implementation strategies, 
 cultural barriers, and other adoption challenges will be examined. In addition, 
a demonstration of how the task–technology fit (TTF) model can be applied to 
increase adoption of the KM program and its various components will be detailed.

300 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Communications and the Adoption Approach
The communications plan should include messages from leadership to employees 
that create an awareness of the KM initiative, prepare the organization for adoption, 
and educate key stakeholders to get them up to speed on activities that are required. 
The goal of the communications plan should be to move from disparate or nonex-
istent knowledge sources and content to organizational knowledge value through 
adoption of the KM strategy. A critical component of success in KM adoption is 
setting the expectation and communicating a vision of what your organization is 
trying to achieve in the short term, mid term, and long term. Successful adoption 
means people change the way they work, it is not just implementing a system. The 
more personalized the message the greater the understanding of change is for each 
employee. The approach utilized for the communications plan should include (but 
not limited to) the following:
 
◾Leveraging existing communications channels (create new ones if needed) — 
see communication channels listed in this chapter
 
◾Communicate in some way at least once per week
 
◾Develop core messages that your organization can leverage through the remain-
der of the initial year of KMS implementation and postimplementation
 
◾Communicate to multiple levels in the organization—leadership and associate
The Communications Plan
At the heart of communication (and KM) lie the development of information 
and the sharing of that information with others to add insights about it— turning 
information into knowledge. KM takes the matters further to (a) ensure informa-
tion is well-organized and accessible (i.e., information management), (b) opti-
mize the frequency and richness of dialogues (through various channels) that 
take place to solve current/upcoming issues and come up with new solutions 
(i.e., social learning and innovation), and (c) keep a learning attitude at various 
levels to ensure continuous improvement of these information and knowledge 
processes.
The KM communications plan should include the following items in its 
structure:
 
◾The challenges and opportunities of setting up a KM program
 
◾The scope of the KM program
 
◾KM communication objectives
 
◾Communication channels (see Table 16. 1)
 
◾Activities proposed per objective
 
◾Activities identified in the communications calendar

KM Adoption ◾ 301
Town Halls and Communication Messaging
Town Hall Content
In addition to organizational news brief messaging, a town hall meeting is the other 
broad communication channel that can be utilized. Best practices for these types of 
sessions include the following: dynamic lead off, several speakers to change things 
up, make things interactive, and be clear about the major messages to communi-
cate. Two town hall sessions are recommended on the communication calendar. 
The first session will educate on the topic and how it affects each associate and work 
process. The second session is recommended to market any changes in the direction 
or initiatives within the program.
Goals of a KM Town Hall Session Are as Follows:
 
◾Sell the vision of the enterprise KM program messages:
– Why KM?
– Not a system, a different way to work together
– Link knowledge to help address major pain points within the organization
• Lack of SME identification
• Lack of available corporate knowledge
• The ability to find knowledge when it is needed
 
◾Create awareness of the KM Program
 
◾Explain 
– How each associate is expected to participate
– What is different from how they work today
– What KM is and why they need to care about it
 
◾Educate regarding KM program rollout and adoption plan
Communication Messaging
The recommendation for communicating about KM and setting the expecta-
tions is a two-prong approach: (a) The executive management and KM program 
leadership share similar messaging as it pertains to implementing the KM pro-
gram. They will be expected to push the messaging down through their organiza-
tions. (b) KM champions or key management for an area will communicate the 
same message with their subordinates as they work to adopt aspects of the KM 
program.
Sample Messaging
XYZ Company is rolling out an enterprise KM program (EKMP). We listen to your 
concerns and needs for such a program and are asking your support to enable the 

302 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
EKMP to realize its vision and achieve its  mission: “Deliver the right knowledge, to 
the right people, in the right context, and at the right time.”
Critical to successful KM is the depth and breadth of the knowledge available. 
We expect (appreciate?) your support in transferring all pertinent knowledge assets 
into the enterprise KM system, making it the single location for corporate intel-
lectual capital.
We’ve received the questions concerning when the new knowledge sharing 
methods (KSM) will be available. To eliminate silos of information/knowledge, a 
news brief and calendar indicating availability of knowledge sharing technology is 
now available to everyone via the corporate intranet.
Thanks for your support in changing the way we work together. A timeline for 
understanding KM impacts in your area will be provided by your KM champion.

KM Adoption ◾ 303
Adoption and the KM Implementation Strategy
To ensure adoption and usage of KMS, the implementation strategy should be 
people centric rather than technology centric. The key activities that are critical 
during KM project management are discussed next:
Project discovery is a structured and analytical approach to assess the business 
value that the KM tool would deliver and also to develop an implementation 
strategy for the KM tool.
Discovery involves the following:
• Develop scenarios to identify how employees will use the system and 
how value will be delivered
• Develop implementation strategy based on the organization’s use 
case scenario, assessment of barriers in connecting and collaborating, 
recommendations for measuring the value delivered, and tactics for 
driving usage and adoption
• Leadership and cultural assessment questionnaires to identify leader-
ship interest and organizational culture support in making KM a 
success
Business objectives and success metrics: It is a prelaunch activity that determines the 
metric tracking, reporting, and success guidelines of the project. This includes 
identifying your corporate objectives and business objectives that help achieve 
your corporate goals, as well as determining project-tracking metrics based on 
business objectives and identifying suitable ranges. Metrics should be measure-
able, actionable, and quantifiable. Examples of metrics are as follows: knowledge 
transactions, reuse of knowledge content, and expertise search and location.
Champion program: The role of a champion is crucial for long-term adoption 
strategies as they will evangelize the system within their respective user 
groups and directly impact usage. It is important to recruit champions across 
the organization (by location, function, and community) who can positively 
influence the adoption within their user segments. Create a structured cham-
pion program to motivate, manage, and provide incentives to champions.
Community development and prepopulation strategies: They should be developed 
based on the feedback gathered during the project discovery. Communities 
can be based on technology or business disciplines, departments, functions, 
products, business process, or special interests. During community devel-
opment, ensure that the communities are not more than three-level deep; 
they are prepopulated and have an active champion identified. Prepopulation 
focuses on ensuring a great first experience to the user of the system. The 
strategies are to be aimed at building user profiles, expert profiles, and bring-
ing the existing content by integrating content repositories such as file shares 
or emails with the KMS.

304 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Integration: It involves integrating the KM tool with other existing tools and 
resources within the organization. Integration coupled with prepopulation 
ensures that users are able to use the system to its fullest potential right from 
the start and are also able to access the other resources made available to them 
earlier. A highly integrated environment ensures that the tool is better used 
and also easier to use.
Training: Training users to utilize the system helps the users in using the system 
more effectively and it has also been seen that a trained user is more likely 
to return to the system. Training sessions will also help in showcasing the 
benefits and use of the system and drive user acceptance.
Lunch-n-learn: This will provide a less formal approach to training and will not 
consume additional time; attendees would spend getting their daily work 
accomplished. Typical lunch-n-learn programs when used to facilitate adop-
tion efforts would include the following:
– Skills training: This can range from teaching customer service representa-
tives how to answer the phone correctly to providing leadership training 
to first-line managers.
– Product training: If your company has many products or services, a pro-
gram of learn at lunch sessions can help all employees better understand 
the product differences.
– Professional development: Give people an opportunity to learn what peo-
ple in other departments do. Do you have someone in IT who could teach 
a course in programming basics or someone in accounting who could 
explain how financial forecasting works? Maybe someone in HR could 
teach a session on how to interview better.
– Personal development: A learn at lunch program does not have to be 
strictly business. You could offer an occasional session on any talent any 
of your employees is willing to teach, from wood carving to painting 
or drawing.
– Life skills: You could bring in a guest speaker to explain to your employees 
the different types of insurance and the benefits of each. Or have a class 
in household budgeting, first aid, or fire safety, anything that helps your 
employees learn.
Incentive management: This involves driving usage by encouraging participa-
tion through the use of rewards, performance reviews, and other motivators. 
Incentive management in itself becomes crucial, as an incorrect program would 
impact the usage of the system. While implementing an incentive  program, 
identify all possible incentives, get key stakeholder buy in, and  publicize the 
incentive plan.
Tactics for culture change: To promote KM culture within an organization, the 
project team must use the KMS to its fullest and evangelize the system. The 
culture change can be brought about by maintaining a rewards and recogni-
tion program for KM adopters, by gathering feedback from early adopters 

KM Adoption ◾ 305
in terms of high personal ROI and sharing broadly, and in some cases by 
undoing the organization’s past history of unsuccessful attempts at KM. The 
project team must also work to get full commitment and support from key 
executives at the organization.
Metrics measurement, reporting, and ROI: As an ongoing exercise, metrics need 
to be monitored and reported in a formal manner by the project team. 
The objective of this exercise is to ensure that the system is being used 
as per expectation and, if there is any deviation, the project team is able 
to preempt it by taking a corrective course correction. Many KM imple-
mentations are unsure of how to link KM efforts to ROI. This should be 
addressed by identifying a set of metrics that best correlate to business 
impact that can be traced to actions taken by users on the KMS such as 
time taken to solve problems, project execution times, new product ideas 
or feedback gathered, time taken to solve customer issues, and reduction in 
manufacturing-related defects.
Usage optimization: It is a continuous exercise to measure and enhance the value 
of a KM implementation and to monitor the health of the system. Usage 
optimization process should
– Gather, analyze, and report actual usage and adoption metrics against 
expected metrics.
– Carry out root cause analysis of the usage and adoption issues.
– Develop a set of tactics to impact these root causes.
– Set goals and timeline for next optimization exercise.
Adopting KM Systems
To succeed in executing your KM strategy, it is imperative that the adoption of 
the system within the user base is achieved. The focus of the implementation and 
socialization of the KMS should be on increasing and maintaining the usage of 
the system in terms of the number of users participating, increasing the number 
of transactions on the system, and improving the quality of the transactions.
Failure in meeting adoption translates into slow growth and an underutilized 
and ineffective KMS. We will focus on two primary areas (a) key adoption chal-
lenges faced by organizations and (b) a framework to guide project teams to over-
come these challenges.
The recommended approach to adoption followed critical elements of technol-
ogy transfer, which included taking into consideration the input from the user 
community concerning their KMS needs, providing assurances of confidence and 
trust that the knowledge and content contained in the KMS was relevant and up-
to-date, messaging changing attitudes from a silo organization to an open acces-
sible organization when it came to sharing, and the ability to obtain knowledge and 
its associated content.

306 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Implementing Information Architecture
Information architecture (IA) focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling con-
tent in an effective and sustainable way. The goal is to help users find, share, and 
collaborate regarding content (information and knowledge) in most cases in order 
to complete certain tasks. The purpose of your IA is to help users understand where 
they are in the system, how to find what they need, know what they’ve found, and 
what to expect from the system. As a result, your IA informs the content strategy 
through identifying word choice as well as informing user interface/user experience 
(UI/UX) through influencing wire framing and the KMS development. The IA 
brings in the understanding of the interdependent nature of users the content and 
context of information.
IA as it is applied to create a KMS provides a user-centric approach to the KMS 
implementation. IA (see Chapter 4) and its involvement of users contribute to the 
user’s ability to understanding how the KMS works by providing intuitive and 
user-friendly functionality, which contributes to the adoption and effective use 
of the system. By establishing clarity upward into the UI and downward into the 
system architecture, contributing to simplifying design, development, and imple-
mentation, the IA creates a common ground bridging the gap between the users, 
designers, and developers. A well-defined IA will provide consistent experiences 
for the users that will also contribute to the successful adoption of the KMS.
TTF Model
The examination of the TTF theory by Huang and Lin (2008) is predicted to be 
a significant precursor to KMS usage (Huang & Lin, 2008). The Huang and Lin 
study has shown that the TTF theory is suitable for understanding the specific 
KMS needs of the group by determining and prioritizing their technology needs 
(Huang & Lin, 2008; Simmons, 2013). The significance of Huang and Lin’s study 
determines that the TTF theory can be applied to examine the motivation of users 
to leverage a KMS to perform their organizational tasks and that applying the TTF 
theory to the KM program can have a positive effect on the success of the KM 
program.
In addressing the application of the TTF theory and how it could be applied to a 
KM program, the first step is an examination of the components of a KM program. 
According to an article by Robert Simmons on implementing a KM program, he 
points out eight specific steps as follows:
Step 1—Establish KM program objectives: Simmons points out that  articulating 
the end state is important to establishing the appropriate program  objectives 
and identifying the business problems and the business drivers that will 
 provide momentum and justification for the endeavor.

KM Adoption ◾ 307
Step 2—Prepare for change: Simmons indicates that a major component of establish-
ing a KM program is to execute change management. The change management 
strategy will address the cultural changes that need to take place on how employees 
perceive and share knowledge as well as addressing the changes within the organi-
zation’s norms and shared values that need to take place. A change management 
strategy will establish an approach for managing cultural change and produce a 
knowledge sharing, knowledge-driven culture end state of the KM program.
Step 3—Define high-level process: To facilitate the identification, capture, cataloging, 
use, and maintenance of the corporation’s knowledge assets, an effective KM 
process needs to be established (Simmons, 2013).
Step 4—Determine and prioritize technology needs: Simmons indicates that 
depending on the program objectives that have been established, as well as 
the process controls and criteria that have been defined, a prioritization of the 
KM technology needs can occur (Simmons, 2013). It is important to under-
stand how the KM technology will address the knowledge processing and 
cultural knowledge needs of the organization as well as how the KM solution 
will be adopted by its users.
Step 5—Assess current state: Assessing the current state of KM within your orga-
nization should focus on the five core KM components: people, processes, 
technology, structure, and culture (Simmons, 2013). This assessment, accord-
ing to Simmons, should uncover the gaps between current and desired states, 
and the recommendations for addressing/closing these gaps. This assessment 
will become the foundation for the KM roadmap (Simmons, 2013).
Step 6—Build a KM implementation roadmap: Simmons stresses that “before 
going too far, you should reconfirm senior leadership’s support and com-
mitment, as well as the funding to implement and maintain the knowledge 
 management program” (Simmons, 2013). This is crucial to the development 
and execution of the program.
The KM program strategy should be presented as a “roadmap of related 
projects, each addressing specific gaps identified by the assessment” 
(Simmons, 2013). The roadmap will indicate timelines, milestones, and 
dependencies. The roadmap should indicate the initiation of specific 
projects to execute the KM program strategy.
Step 7—Implementation: Implementing a KM program and maturing the overall 
effectiveness of your organization can require significant personnel resources 
and funding. Implementation of the KM program will involve the execution 
of the roadmap, ensuring that short-term goals and wins are realized to gain 
momentum and maintain the support of key stakeholders (Simmons, 2013).
Step 8—Measure and improve the KM program: In order to understand if your 
KM program and its associated initiatives (projects) are effective, establishing 
the appropriate metrics/measurements are necessary. These metrics must be 
utilized in a way to measure the actual effectiveness and comparing that to 
anticipated results (Simmons, 2013).

308 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Applying the TTF Model
When applying the TTF theory to the KM program, a determination of where the TTF 
theory fits within the KM program structure must be identified. The TTF theory (see 
Figure 16.1) holds that IT is more likely to have a positive impact on individual and 
group performance if it is aligned with the tasks the users perform (Huang & Lin, 2008). 
When incorporating the KMS into the KM program, the system is aligned with the KM 
processes that have been identified that the KM program will support (Simmons, 2013). 
The KM processes of the KM program reflect how workers within the organization use 
knowledge to perform their tasks. The TTF theory is suited to measure this usage and 
can be leveraged to understand not only how the KMSs are being used but will guide 
the KM program administrators on the best way to increase adoption and contribute to 
increasing the performance of the workers who use the KMS.
The Huang and Lin (2008) examination of KMS application of the TTF theory 
included the application of the TTF theory to analyze its usefulness. This exami-
nation indicated that the TTF theory is predicted to be a significant precursor to 
KMS usage (Huang & Lin, 2008).
Furthermore, the Huang and Lin study has shown that the TTF theory is suit-
able for understanding the specific KMS needs of the program contributing to step 
4 (determine and prioritize technology needs) of the KM program (Huang & Lin, 
2008; Simmons, 2013). The TTF theory will also contribute to the KM program 
roadmap as it pertains to the alignment of technology to the specific milestones and 
objectives identified in the roadmap; in addition, the TTF theory will contribute to 
understanding what are the key aspects to adoption of the KMS by the organization’s 
users and provides mechanisms to measure the rate of adoption contributing to step 
8 of the KM program, to measure and improve the KM program (Simmons, 2013).
The Huang and Lin (2008) research into the TTF theory as it applies to the 
adoption of KMS indicates that KMS can play a major role in the facilitation of 
KM policies, processes, and procedures throughout an organization (Huang & 
Lin, 2008). The significance of this research determines that the TTF theory can 
be applied to examine the motivation of users to leverage a KMS to perform their 
organizational tasks and that applying the TTF theory to the KM program can 
have a positive effect on the success of the KM program.

Organizational Culture
Understanding the culture of your organization will mitigate cultural resistance 
to KM adoption. Knowing if your organization’s culture is knowledge hoarders 
or knowledge sharers, resistant to change or welcomes change, adoption leaders, 
or adoption laggards will play a significant role on the messaging, activities, and 
objectives that are placed on adoption initiatives.
Hsu, Lawson, and Liang state that diverse enterprise cultures and leadership 
styles may lead enterprises to a different management pattern. Three primary factors 
affect the adoption of KM: senior management support, a knowledge-friendly cul-
ture, and a clear strategy for managing knowledge (Hsu, Lawson, & Liang, 2007).
Important to the adoption of KM is the organizational culture regarding the 
importance and use of knowledge. This may be the most difficult component to 
fully mitigate (Davenport & Prusak, 1999). The enterprise culture represents a com-
pany’s values, which become the norms of its employees’ activities, opinions, and 
conduct. A method to mitigate an organization’s cultural barrier to KM is to take an 
individual knowledge and attitude approach toward KM adoption. Changing user 
perceptions and attitudes is the key to a user’s participation.
In numerous studies, top management support and high-ranking management 
positive participation have been found to be crucial to the successful adoption of 
KM by an organization’s employees (Hsu, Lawson, & Liang, 2007).
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings from this chapter:
 
◾Best practice organizations use a variety of channels including e-mail, the 
intranet, and leadership involvement to promote KM to employees.
 
◾Do not take a one size fits all approach to KM and KM adoption. A recom-
mendation is to structure each communication to convey the value of KM 
participation to a specific audience. When your employees understand the 

310 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
organizational (global) picture of how they as individuals fit and will benefit, 
they are much more likely to make the effort to adopt the KM program and 
its various initiatives.
 
◾By applying the task characteristics of the roles within the group to the 
functionality of your organization’s KMS, you are able to ascertain the gaps 
in knowledge and content provided by the system.
 
◾The TTF model indicates that the greater the fit of IS design with task 
 characteristics of its users along with the ability of the KMS to address the 
knowledge needs of the users, the better the performance of the users.
Tips and Techniques
The following are several tips and techniques that can be applied to adopt your 
organization’s KM program (policies, procedures, methods, and systems):
 
◾In adopting a KMS, it is important that the user’s knowledge needs are met 
and trust that the knowledge and content contained in the system is relevant 
and up-to-date.
 
◾The TTF theory can also contribute to the group enhancing the KM program 
roadmap as it pertains to the alignment of technology to the specific roles 
within your organization.
 
◾In measuring value and rate of adoption of the KMS, it is similar to other 
software implementations. However, it has a significant difference. Instead of 
quantitative measures to value a KMS such as the number of contributions or 
number of uses, “measures of KMS success are rather related to intention to use 
(end users) and intention to contribute (contributory users) and can be assessed 
with the help of the perceived benefit model.” (see Figure 16.2; Baloh, 2007).

◾The TTF is leveraged to analyze the context through an analysis of the char-
acteristics of knowledge needs (instead of tasks) where task and technology 
contingencies are internally consistent and aligned. Baloh also indicates 
that “the more technology is aligned to knowledge needs, the greater their 
intentions to contribute and use KMS will be” (Baloh, 2007).

Chapter 17
Failure Is Not an Option: 
Why Do Knowledge 
Management Programs 
and Projects Fail?
Why do knowledge management (KM) programs and projects fail?
Let’s begin by determining the difference between a KM program and a KM 
project. In a blog post dated December 31, 2012, I have stated what in my experi-
ence designates a KM program and a KM project. In many of my KM engagements, 
organizations look to initiate KM through a specific initiative or project. Once that 
project is concluded, many of these organizations believe that their KM involve-
ment is done and they move on to the next initiative. In order to have a sustainable 
KM presence in an organization, we must move from the tactical approach of a KM 
project to that of a strategic approach of a KM program. In order to accomplish this, 
a KM strategy has to be developed.
To increase the opportunity for success, the KM strategy must be positioned 
at the program level, and this strategy will drive specific initiatives that align with 
the mission and objectives of the KM program. The KM strategy includes formal 
procedures to collect knowledge throughout the organization, a well-established 
infrastructure, networks for transferring knowledge between employees, and 
tools to facilitate the process. The KM strategy will lay the foundation to align 
specific tools/technology to enhance individual and organizational performance. 

314 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
This is accomplished by incorporating the following three components into the 
fabric of an organization’s environment:
 
◾People—those who create, organize, apply, and transfer knowledge; and the 
leaders who act on that knowledge
 
◾Processes—methods of creating, organizing, applying, and transferring 
knowledge
 
◾Technology—information systems used to put knowledge products and 
 services into organized frameworks
According to an April 2013 article by Robert Simmons, a principal within Forsythe’s 
information technology (IT) operations management practice on implementing a 
KM program, he points out eight specific steps as follows:
Step 1: Establish KM program objectives—Simmons points out that artic-
ulating the end state is important to establishing the appropriate pro-
gram objectives, and identifying the business problems and the business 
drivers that will provide momentum and justification for the endeavor 
(Simmons, 2013).
Step 2: Prepare for change—Simmons indicates that a major component of 
establishing a KM program is to execute change management. The change 
management strategy will address the cultural changes that need to take 
place on how employees perceive and share knowledge, and the changes 
within the organization’s norms and shared values that need to take place. 
A change management strategy will establish an approach for managing cul-
tural change and produce a knowledge-sharing, knowledge-driven culture 
end state of the KM program (Simmons, 2013).
Step 3: Define high-level process—To facilitate the identification, capture, cata-
loging, use, and maintenance of the corporation’s knowledge assets, effective 
KM process need to be established (Simmons, 2013).
Step 4: Determine and prioritize technology needs—Simmons indicates that 
depending on the program objectives that have been established as well as 
the process controls and criteria that have been defined, a prioritization of the 
KM technology needs can occur (Simmons, 2013). It is important to under-
stand how the KM technology will address the knowledge processing and 
cultural knowledge needs of the organization as well as how the KM solution 
will be adopted by its users.
Step 5: Assess the current state—Assessment of the current state of KM within 
your organization should focus on the five core KM components: people, 
processes, technology, structure, and culture (Simmons, 2013). This assess-
ment, according to Simmons, should uncover the gaps between current and 
desired states, and the recommendations for addressing/closing these gaps. 

Why KM Programs & Projects Fail ◾ 315
This assessment will become the foundation for the KM roadmap (Simmons, 
2013).
Step 6: Build a KM implementation roadmap—Simmons stresses that “before 
going too far, you should re-confirm senior leadership’s support and commit-
ment, as well as the funding to implement and maintain the knowledge manage-
ment program” (Simmons, 2013, p. 1). This is crucial to the development and 
execution of the program.
The KM program strategy should be presented as a “roadmap of related 
 projects, each addressing specific gaps identified by the assessment” 
(Simmons, 2013, p. 1). The roadmap will indicate timelines, milestones, 
and dependencies. The roadmap should indicate the initiation of  specific 
projects to execute the KM program strategy.
Step 7: Implementation—Implementing a KM program and maturing the 
overall effectiveness of your organization can require significant personnel 
resources and funding. Implementation of the KM program will involve 
the execution of the roadmap, insuring that short-term goals and wins are 
realized to gain momentum and maintain the support of key stakeholders 
(Simmons, 2013).
Step 8: Measure and improve the KM program—In order to understand if your 
organization’s KM program and its  associated initiatives (projects) are effec-
tive, establishing the appropriate metrics/measurements are necessary. These 
metrics must be used in a way to  measure the actual effectiveness and compar-
ing that to anticipated results (Simmons, 2013).
The failure rates for KM initiatives are at 50% (Frost, 2014). Knowing this 
we must determine, what is the cause and effect? Is it because of lack of 
senior leadership/support? Is a cultural issue? Or much more? The reasons 
why KM initiatives fail are varied, and it stems from the following key 
indicators:
In examining why KM programs/projects fail, besides the lack of a KM 
strategy other key indicators include the following:
• Lack of executive leadership/sponsorship
• Inadequate budgeting and cost expectations
• Lack of participation from all levels of a corporation
• Inadequate processes and technology
• Lack of knowledge and resources
• Lack of education and understanding of KM
• KM does not become ingrained into the corporations work culture
• Lack of a knowledge sharing environment
• Lack of metrics to measure the impact of KM on the corporation or 
insufficient/incorrect metrics being captured
• Lack of monitoring and controls in place to ensure the knowledge 
is  relevant and is current and accurate. The organization must view 

316 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
KM more than just a function of the call center or a cost of doing 
business. KM is a method of enhancing the collective know-how 
of the organization, improving productivity, and enhancing overall 
organizational value. KM will improve efficiencies that will increase 
a corporations’ profitability, enhances the quality of work, perfor-
mance, and overall value of the corporation. KM allows tacit knowl-
edge to be leveraged, transferred to increase the quality of work 
performed across the organization. This tacit knowledge allows KM 
to eliminate the “reinvent the wheel” syndrome. This transfer of 
knowledge is a core value of KM.
Lack of Executive Leadership/Sponsorship
Successful KM initiatives depend greatly on management backing and have 
been documented and proven over many years of implementing KM initiatives 
(Davenport, De Long, and Beer, 1998; Chong and Choi, 2005; Wu et al., 2010). In 
contrast, failure of KM initiatives have been a consequence of inadequate manage-
ment support (Singh and Kant, 2008; Weber, 2007; Pettersson, 2009).
Developing and operationalizing a KM strategy and subsequent program 
involves the creation, acceptance, and adoption of processes, values, and systems 
that are either company-wide or in the very least span across functions, departments, 
and communities. The implementation and long-term success of such far-reaching 
changes require top and central management backing, not only from the perspective 
of resource and political support but also to ensure day-to-day acceptance and use 
of the KM.
Sustained management support, in particular, senior leadership support is nec-
essary for continued KM success because of the following factors:
 
◾KM requires strong guidance, decision making, and change implementation.
 
◾KM efforts require a clear vision and the example set by management, as well 
as implementing policies that serve as a way to legitimize KM and highlight 
its importance in the organization.
 
◾In order to prevent lack of enforcement of responsibilities and lack central 
management responsibility.
 
◾Failure can occur due to a lack of leadership support in the organization.
 
◾When KM is used as a political instrument to gain influence and leverage 
within an organization.
 ◾To incentify the use of KM as a standard for rewarding that enforce appropriate 
behavior need to be set by management. The extent to which this is useful 
should be discussed among leadership.

Why KM Programs & Projects Fail ◾ 317
 
◾Management must provide the resources necessary for KM implementa-
tion. KM requires a great deal of financial, human, and material resources; 
this includes the assignment of competent professionals and a sufficient 
budget.
 
◾Management must stem the lack of understanding of the benefits, com-
plexity, and requirements of KM by instituting an awareness campaign 
that includes but is not limited to lunch-n-learn briefings, KM training 
both instructor lead and online, and the ability to attend and participate 
in KM conferences.
 
◾Management needs the ability to present return on investment (ROI). 
The  need for solid performance indicators is extremely important for 
 management to continue investing in KM.
 
◾KM must not be just another task to do, but it should be a part of what is 
done by everyone in the organization. It must become part of the corporate 
DNA to have longevity and lasting success.
Without the enforcement of managerial responsibilities, an organization may 
end up with no control of the shared or reused knowledge. Management can 
mitigate this through the creation of the knowledge manager, KM liaison, and 
KM champion (see Table 17.1) roles within the organization. These roles will be 
an extension of management, and will facilitate the distribution of managerial 
responsibilities of KM and increases the level of KM acumen and at all levels of 
the organization.

KM Extension Role
Description
Knowledge 
manager
This management role is the extension of the chief 
knowledge officer (or equivalent role), whose primary 
duty is to implement knowledge initiatives and manage 
KM efforts, including change management. 
KM liaison
The KM liaison serves as extended KM team members 
across the organization that has the responsibility of 
carrying out specific KM initiatives within their area.
KM champion
The KM champion promotes KM in an organization 
often by championing/supporting and evangelizing 
specific KM initiatives that align with organization 
strategy and direction. 

318 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
Inadequate Budgeting and Cost Expectations
Successful KM requires adequate financing as well as sound financial management. 
Appropriate or inappropriate budgeting depends on leadership and management 
support. Budgeting in turn affects the ability to develop a KM program/project and 
the technology that supports and enables KM.
Many KM projects do end successfully, while many others are outright disas-
ters. However, it’s common to complete a project but be over your deadline or 
over your budget, or to have a dissatisfied client or a miserable team. To keep your 
KM projects from ending up in this gray area (or in the failure range), you must 
avoid making the single biggest project management mistake that leads to cost and 
 budget overruns and that is inadequate project definition and planning.
Before the KM project work begins, it is essential that the work is properly 
understood and agreed to by the project sponsor and key stakeholders. Working 
with your sponsor and stakeholders to ensure that there is a common understanding 
of KM and what the project will deliver, when it will be complete, what it will cost, 
who will do the work, how the work will be done, and what the benefits will be. 
The larger the project, the more important it is to complete upfront planning and 
budgeting to prevent problems caused by differing understanding on the various 
KM deliverables and the basic terms of the project.
Usually, a KM project needs to have a budget and deadline before it is started. 
In many cases, if the definition and planning are not done ahead of time, the KM 
project team starts off with inadequate resources and time. Many KM projects that 
could be successful are viewed as failures (about 50%), because they overrun their 
budgets and deadlines. Inadequate budgeting and cost expectations contribute to 
the following failure factors:
 
◾Inappropriate method or lack of budgeting
 
◾Excessive cost of KM implementation
 
◾Lack of a separate budget
 
◾Maintenance cost of a KM strategy
Need for Organizational Participation
Organizational participation and the lack thereof is another key reason contributing 
to the failure of KM projects and programs. Many factors can be attributed to this, 
including lack of contribution because stakeholders were not asked/encouraged to 
contribute, because stakeholders were unable to contribute, or because stakeholders 
were unwilling to contribute.
This can include adding to the corporate knowledge base, improving KM 
 initiatives, and actively participating in knowledge-sharing activities. Lack of 
 contribution because stakeholders were not asked/encouraged to contribute 
(Weber, 2007) indicates that KM initiatives risk failure when they are designed 

Why KM Programs & Projects Fail ◾ 319
without input from all the organization’s stakeholders, pointing to the importance 
of community processes and organizational culture.
More often than not, limiting KM activities based on organizational boundaries 
contributes to KM failure both from a program and project perspective, because it 
ignores valuable external sources such as customers. A lack of involvement can also 
occur when an organization’s members are unable to contribute with their knowl-
edge. Inadequate technology may impose limitations on how users can share their 
knowledge and is another barrier to organizational participation (Weber, 2007).
Inadequate technology, which can put barriers up for users to contribute, 
also adds to the lack of willingness among users to contribute to the KM efforts. 
Knowledge sharing depends on organizational culture and its ability to foster reci-
procity, openness, and trust. The lack of reciprocity, openness, and trust contributes 
to fearing the results and ramifications of contributing to KM (which begins at 
knowledge sharing). Having a holistic execution of a communication plan allows for 
open communication and is key to creating trust. However, the lack of  willingness 
to share knowledge and communicate is also a contributor to KM failure. This is 
a problem when knowledge is regarded as a source of power or when a corporate 
culture places value on individual genius rather than collective work, and in some 
organizations, in some cases, individuals may perceive accessing another member’s 
knowledge as a sign of inadequacy.
Inadequate Processes and Technology
Technology has always been a rather tricky issue within KM, and knowledge 
 management system (KMS) is a key component to KM success and its failure. There 
are three general problems that an organization may encounter when  implementing 
a KMS:
 
1. Poor performance
 
2. Poor fit with organizational processes and culture
 
3. Overreliance on technology
Problems related to KMS performance include poor technical infrastructure, poor 
representation of knowledge, and poor usability, which contribute to inadequate 
process and technology in KM. Failure can occur due to KM systems that can 
either not handle the demand placed on them, which represent knowledge in a way 
that does not meet the needs of its users, or that are not user-friendly.
Achieving organizational goals depends upon organizational processes, and 
therefore, failure will occur if KMS is not integrated with organizational processes 
(Weber, 2007). In addition, the organizational culture plays a role in determining 
whether the system is accepted by members of the organization or not. Chapter 
16 details a proven method: task–technology fit (TTF) for adopting KM systems and 
the adoption of the KMS plays a key role in the success of the KM program/project.

320 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
However, an overreliance on technology in KM can lead to a neglect of tacit 
knowledge. We must understand that tacit knowledge is still best transmitted from 
person to person and the more tacit the knowledge, the less high-tech the solution 
has to be. Failure is likely to occur when the IT system is seen as a solution in itself. 
Moreover, failure can also occur if the limitations of the IT systems, particularly 
in regard to tacit knowledge, are not well understood and should be adopted only 
when it is suitable to the task (Weber, 2007).
Lack of Knowledge and Resources
Staff defection and retirement can lead to failure in KM implementation. Failure to 
plan ahead and transfer key knowledge can lead to problems for the organization. 
This points to the need to implement a knowledge transfer program to transfer key 
knowledge before employees retire. Liebowitz addresses knowledge retention, who 
indicates that the process of retaining knowledge should be integrated into the 
organization from the moment the employee is hired. (This is also addressed in the 
human capital management section of Chapter 6.) According to Liebowitz, few 
organizations have formal strategies in place for knowledge retention (Liebowitz, 
2009). Once retired, key employees can still act as a valuable resource for the firm 
and can be brought back. As indicated in Chapter 6, this is still a temporary fix if 
the knowledge is not captured and transferred to the current workforce. At the end 
of the day, if the organization does not plan ahead and identify and protect its key 
knowledge resources, its KM initiatives risk failure.
Need for Education and Understanding of KM
It is extremely important that the staff facilitating KM activities have an understand-
ing of KM. This understanding must align with the organization’s KM goals and 
objectives and must be consistent as KM is adopted throughout the organization.
Knowledge managers and knowledge workers comprise the entire spectrum 
of KM-related positions, and may include titles/roles such as chief knowledge 
 officer (CKO), knowledge champion, knowledge analyst, and knowledge systems 
 engineer, among others.
As a KM practitioner who has (and continues to) work across various and 
different sectors and industries of the knowledge economy, I recognize that every 
organization is different and therefore the success of KM, in each industry, and 
company is going to depend on how well the elements of KM align with the cor-
porate objectives, unique management methodologies, and leadership structures 
of the various organizations implementing KM programs and projects.
The skills required of KM personnel will depend on the role(s) being performed 
within the KM program. The following are some typical KM roles:

Why KM Programs & Projects Fail ◾ 321
The skill requirements for a knowledge manager/worker could vary drastically 
depending on his specific areas of responsibility. For instance, a CKO would require 
very strong strategy and business skills, as well as management, learning, and com-
munication (KM Skills Map, 2000). The CKO would not need to be as strong in 
IT skills as, for example, a systems engineer in charge of developing a KMS.
KM is likely to fail if there is a lack of availability of relevant skills: The right 
business and technical skills must be present to sustain the project. Skills can also 
be developed through training, providing that this is implemented with clear, 
 measurable goals (Wu et al., 2010).
The selection of KM role must have the corresponding skills and be appropriate 
to the KM initiative.

KM and the Corporate Culture
Culture is expressed by patterns of thinking and serves as the basis of creating 
employee’s attitudes and their behaviors in particular to situations demonstrat-
ing their values and norms. This means that organizational culture describing the 
enterprise is understood and shared by employees. The system of cultural values 
will have an influence on the implementation of KM programs/projects, and this 
impact can be either strengthening or hindering.
The presence of an appropriate organizational culture is almost universally accepted 
as one of the key aspects of successful KM implementation. Culture plays a critical role 
in the willingness of organizational members to share knowledge. The willingness to 
share knowledge affects trust, the willingness to accept knowledge from others, with-
out it being perceived as a personal shortcoming, the willingness and ability to learn, 
openness to change and the desire, and the ability to experiment and innovate.
Culture can vary on an organizational or community level. Because KM 
 initiatives span functions and departments, an understanding of all the facets of an 
organization’s culture is critical. The process of changing culture is particularly dif-
ficult; an organization’s culture could persuade or discourage individuals to make 
use of KM techniques and technologies to create, codify, and share knowledge.
However, the management of culture to ensure and support sharing, learning, 
and innovation is essential for successful implementation of KM programs and 
projects. Organizational cultures vary in terms of their attitudes toward KM and 

326 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
the cultural obstacles that are experienced. We can conclude to some degree that 
KM is approached differently depending on the organization and its culture, and 
that those KM techniques and technologies that are successfully implemented in 
one organization might fail in another, owing to the influence that corporate cul-
ture has on the extent to which these techniques and technologies are used.
Creating an Environment for Knowledge Exchange
The structure of the organization plays an important role in determining how 
knowledge is distributed, how decisions are made, the degree to which people 
feel comfortable sharing, and the barriers that exist between different groups and 
individuals. Organizational structure therefore strongly influences the ability and 
willingness of people and communities to share and create knowledge, and it also 
determines the management of the KM program.
Centralization: The degree to which decision making is centralized. In highly 
centralized organizations, decisions are made by a few managers at the top of the 
organization. This puts a heavy demand on the cognitive capacity of these manag-
ers. Research and experience have identified that decentralized structures as being 
more suited for KM.
Formalization: It is the extent to which behaviors in an organization are governed 
by rules and policies (Wu et al., 2010). Conversely, it can be the degree to which 
informal networks are discouraged, tolerated, or encouraged within the organiza-
tion. In general, rigid, formal structures are regarded as being detrimental to KM.
Complexity is seen as being composed of many, not necessarily, interrelated 
parts. Organizations are divided by function, region, business unit, or division, and 
this tends to hinder KM, because each of these is usually worried about its own 
bottom line and tends to operate as silos. Simpler organizational structures, which 
lead to fewer silos, tend to make it easier for KM to be implemented. The complex-
ity of the organizational structure also affects its management and the necessary 
managerial roles to effectively implement KM.
Although there is no specific formula for determining the best environment for 
exchanging knowledge, we know that corporate structure influences KM on many 
levels, and an improper structure can lead to a variety of problems with knowledge 
sharing, organizational learning, effective decision making, and effective manage-
ment of KM initiatives.
Poorly Measuring the Impact of KM
The ability to determine whether a project or initiative is succeeding or failing 
and whether it is a worthwhile endeavor for the organization is crucial for its 
long-term success. Performance indicators are therefore required so as to assess 

Why KM Programs & Projects Fail ◾ 327
 progress, devise improvements, and compare one’s own situation to that of a dif-
ferent organization (Wu et al., 2010). KM must be linked to economics, meaning 
that its value must be made apparent.
Although performance indicators are not always listed among the top failure rea-
sons, I have chosen to outline them first because they influence several other causal 
factors, including management support and the ability to plan and evaluate. The 
effect of KM is notoriously difficult to evaluate, particularly in monetary terms. The 
intangible nature of knowledge and the fact that value creation is often indirect and 
long term makes such an assessment very difficult. Yet, performance indicators are 
crucial for management to continue investing in KM (Wu et al., 2010).
Successful KM implementation depends upon the integration of many differ-
ent aspects of an organization. Waltz (2003: 102) indicates that “KM provides a 
strategy and organizational discipline for the integration of people, processes, and 
IT into an effective enterprise.”
Proper planning and continuous evaluation are needed to ensure that all aspects 
of KM are being implemented effectively and work well together. The implementa-
tion of KM requires a long-term and practical outlook.
The ability to evaluate progress depends on having good performance indicators. 
Without these, it becomes extremely difficult for management to track the effec-
tiveness of the program. Therefore, very broadly, inadequate evaluation can result 
either from a lack of ability, due to the absence of solid performance indicators 
(Wu et al., 2010), or alternatively, due to the lack of a systemized approach dur-
ing the implementation of the KM initiative. Although there is no specific formula 
that will guarantee success, planning, and evaluating your KM program/project 
are critical for setting goals and delegating responsibility, integrating different KM 
enablers into a KM strategy, aligning the KM strategy to the overall organizational 
strategy, improving KM effectiveness at the program and project level, anticipating 
and detecting problems, determining successes and failures, forecasting costs and 
determining budgets, and implementing corrective measures.
Lack of Monitoring and Controls
KM enables the retrieval, creation, sharing, collaboration, and management of 
knowledge. The management of knowledge resources can mean the difference 
between success and failure in a competitive environment. This encourages 
 organizations to look for better ways to manage their knowledge assets. The lack 
of monitoring and controls for knowledge leads to improperly managing, main-
taining, and keeping your organizational knowledge relevant; this in turn will 
quickly cause the KM program and/or project to be branded as a failure. One way 
to address this is to implement and execute a comprehensive KM governance plan.
KM governance ensures policy adherence and contributes to the sustainability 
of the KM program/project. KM governance provides controls to guarantee that 

328 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
the knowledge stored in the various systems, portals, and/or repositories provide 
the best value for the organization. Governance will detail how the knowledge will 
be managed. It describes the policies, procedures, roles, and responsibilities that 
are needed to successfully maintain and keep your knowledge relevant. Effective 
governance planning and the application of the governance plan are critical for the 
ongoing success of any KM program and/or project.
The governance plan will establish the processes and policies to
 
◾Avoid knowledge proliferation by periodically reviewing knowledge assets for 
accuracy and relevance.
 
◾Ensure that knowledge assets quality is maintained for the life of the solution 
by implementing quality management policies.
 
◾Establish clear decision-making authority and escalation procedures, so that 
policy violations are managed and conflicts are resolved on a timely basis.
 
◾Ensure that the solution strategy is aligned with business objectives, so that it 
continuously delivers business value.
 
◾Ensure that knowledge assets are retained in compliance with knowledge 
retention guidelines of your organization.
Benefits of good KM governance
 
◾Provide a business-wide common infrastructure for knowledge assets.
 ◾Ensure that the KM delivers relevant knowledge to its users in an effective way.
 
◾Employ best practices that will improve usability (through information 
architecture).
 
◾Provide transparent mechanisms for risk management, evaluation, and 
measurement.
 
◾Provide mechanisms to maintain performance management in order to 
match or exceed the predefined standards and objectives.
 
◾Slow the proliferation and increases the relevance of available knowledge 
through consistent review, modification, and archiving of knowledge.
 
◾Lower total cost of knowledge development and management through 
increased efficiencies throughout the KM life cycle.
Key Learnings
The following are some key learnings deduced from this Chapter:
Plan for success by executing a KM strategy that incorporates/champion these 
components into your organization:
 
◾People—those who create, organize, apply, and transfer knowledge; and the 
leaders who act on that knowledge

Why KM Programs & Projects Fail ◾ 329
 
◾Processes—methods of creating, organizing, applying, and transferring 
knowledge
 
◾Technology—information systems used to put knowledge products and ser-
vices into organized frameworks
We must keep in mind that successful KM initiatives once completed and funded 
correctly can increase the organization’s profitability, enhance the quality of work, 
encourage and stimulate innovation, and increase the value of the organization 
through an increase valuation and accountability of knowledge assets.
To decrease the probability of failure (and thus increasing the success rate!), the 
following must be resolved:
 
◾Expecting KM technologies to replace KM processes or create processes 
where none exists
 
◾Lack of participation from all levels of a corporation
 
◾Forcing inadequate processes into new technology
 
◾Lack of maintenance and resources after initial standup
 
◾Lack of education and understanding of what KM means to the individual
 
◾KM does not become ingrained into the corporations work culture
 
◾Lack of involvement in creating and evolving KM content
 
◾Lack of metrics to measure the impact of KM on the corporation or insuf-
ficient/incorrect metrics being captured
 
◾Lack of monitoring and controls in place to ensure the knowledge is relevant 
and is current and accurate
Tips and Techniques
The following are some of the tips and techniques that can be applied to understand 
the reason for failure of KM programs/projects in hopes of avoiding them!
When developing your KM strategy for success, incorporate Robert Simmons’ 
eight steps on implementing a KM program:
 
◾Step 1: Establish KM program objectives
 
◾Step 2: Prepare for change
 
◾Step 3: Define high-level process
 
◾Step 4: Determine and prioritize technology needs
 
◾Step 5: Assess current state
 
◾Step 6: Build a KM implementation roadmap
 
◾Step 7: Implementation
 
◾Step 8: Measure and improve the KM program

330 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
When establishing your KM program incorporate the following:
 
◾Your KM program should be designed to support communities of practice. 
Being a community of practice implies that its members share the same inter-
ests. Sharing same interests allows for consistency in the quality of knowledge 
artifacts, as they are geared to positively impact the same target processes.
 
◾Your KM program should integrate people, processes, and technology. The 
people component should consist of knowledge facilitators and users (i.e., 
knowledge workers) who work together to understand the community pro-
cesses and master the technology.
 
◾Your KM program should be designed in collaboration with different stake-
holders. It takes a variety of stakeholders from all levels of management, 
KM champions from departments across the organization, human resources 
department to support new and evolving KM-specific positions, and all other 
employees (knowledge workers) to make the KM program successful and 
sustainable.
 
◾Your KM program’s strategy should align with the overall corporate strategy. 
This will support the buy-in that is necessary from senior leadership to get the 
KM program established and operational.
 
◾Your KM program’s outcomes should be measurable and accountable to the 
organization. Establishing a set of straightforward key performance indica-
tors and metrics is just the beginning. In addition, having scheduled com-
munication to leadership and the organization as a whole on the successes, 
challenges, and impacts to the organization KM is having is essential to cre-
ating a sustainable and successful KM program.

Summary
Knowledge Management in Practice provides knowledge management (KM) 
 professionals and those obtaining training and formal education in KM a  practical 
examination on how KM is being applied. The use of its principles, practices, and 
procedures has expanded enormously in recent years. This expansion has also brought 
about the proliferation of KM systems in many forms (customer relationship manage-
ment [CRM], content management, document management, knowledge repositories/
libraries, social media applications, decision support systems, etc.). The inclusion of 
KM from a strategic point of view to streamline revenue, increase revenue, improve 
performance, attract/retain customers, and manage human capital has enabled orga-
nizations to maintain and/or improve their competitive edge. To compete in a local, 
national, and/or global market, organizations including educational, government, and 
military are looking for that differentiator and KM has proved to be just that.
This book provided techniques and insights that the KM practitioner and 
organizations can utilize in order to be successful when implementing KM. This 
included detailed information on applying KM practices, procedures, and tech-
niques to solve real-world problems. This chapter presents a synopsis of what has 
been presented in this book. It will also present some forward-looking statements 
about the future of KM and what we can look forward to in the near term.
What the reader has taken away from this book:
In reading this book undoubtedly you may have come away noticing several 
concepts and approaches, and patterns in delivering how KM has emerged. From 
examining the case for KM in Chapter 2, which focuses on why your  organization 
may need a KM program, to techniques such as knowledge capture, knowledge 
sharing, expertise locators, information architecture, search, and governance that 
provide the methods and enablers for KM, to the industries such as research, human 
resources/talent management, healthcare, insurance, finance, military, and law, 
I attempted to present a holistic view of KM based on my experience. I approach 

332 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
implementing KM from a perspective that the scholar and practitioner alike can 
gain valuable insight from.
In addition, I presented an examination of KM in a few areas that I believe KM 
will be making a significant impact. These areas included social media, KM educa-
tion programs, emergency and disaster preparedness, customer service (particularly 
within the insurance and financial industries), M&A transactions, and big data.
Social Media
Chapter 3  presented social tools and mediums such as blogs, wikis, Twitter, 
Facebook, and LinkedIn that represent the mechanisms to enable people to engage 
and share openly. These social tools put knowledge-sharing power in the hands of 
the users themselves, and this power has business and government taking notice. 
In this chapter, social media as it pertains to the key principles of KM were exam-
ined. These key principles included knowledge sharing, knowledge capture, and 
knowledge reuse. This chapter included a template for developing your organiza-
tion’s social media strategy as well as some proven tips and techniques to success-
fully execute this strategy.
Education Programs
Acknowledging that KM is a professional area of practice and to begin a 
 formal  discussion of the educational foundation needed to support this area of 
 professional practice was the focus of Chapter 13. This chapter presented KM 
education delivery and options within universities and colleges as well as in KM 
 certification  organizations. This chapter covered topics that included strategic roles 
and responsibilities of knowledge professionals in organizations today and the 
educational needs of these professionals, standard KM competencies, KM cur-
riculum development and delivery, and teaching methodologies.
Emergency and Disaster Preparedness
KM applied to emergency and disaster preparedness, response, and recovery 
 presented in Chapter 7 focused on implementing a KM strategy centered on 
 emergency preparedness and response by first responders. A detailed analysis of a 
comprehensive emergency alert system was presented. This chapter examined spe-
cific areas of a comprehensive emergency alert system that is a catalyst in deliver-
ing knowledge to the right people in the right context and at the right time in an 
emergency preparedness, response, and/or recovery situation.

Summary ◾ 333
Customer Service
KM in customer service continues to be the focus of many organizations. This 
is evident especially within the insurance and financial sectors as presented in 
Chapters 10 and 11. When KM is applied to customer service, we saw that it led 
to a faster speed to answer customer questions, which has been directly linked 
to higher satisfaction rates, better long-term loyalty, higher degrees of trust, and 
higher levels of revenue. In addition, some of the soft benefits included better 
engagement and a higher likelihood to recommend your organization to other 
potential customers.
M&A Transactions
The impact of KM on M&A transactions specifically when it comes to understand-
ing who the key knowledge holders are and to properly give a valuation to a firm’s 
knowledge is an essential value addition for applying KM to M&A transactions. We 
found in Chapter 8 that the effect of mergers will and often leads to a loss of valuable 
knowledge from both sides of the merger/acquisition equation. The question that 
was addressed is how do we identify who the key knowledge holders are and what 
knowledge do they hold? Also, has it been determined what knowledge is viable 
to the new organization going forward? In this chapter a discussion of implement-
ing a comprehensive KM strategy with a human capital management component 
that would address the many intellectual capital issues that are caused by a merger/ 
acquisition was examined.
Big Data
Big data continue to make an impact and present a challenge in the industry, 
which specifically points to how KM will be positioned to gleam knowledge from 
the various repositories of structured and unstructured data contained within the 
 organization. As we read in Chapter 14, infusing big data with KM will provide 
organizations with a competitive edge to not only bring about significant innova-
tions, but deliver knowledge across the enterprise to the right people at the right 
time and in the right context.
However, an examination of KM in practice would not be complete  without 
adding an examination of KM adoption (Chapter 16) as well as why KM pro-
grams and projects fail (Chapter 17). In order to apply the principles, practices, 
and methods presented in this book, I also highlighted tips and techniques 
and key learnings. All these will provide a jump start to executing KM at your 
organization.

334 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
The Future of KM
One of the major areas in which KM will make an impact is within the customer 
service industry. Customer service is the area in which most customers will have 
their only connection and interaction with your organization. It is this area where 
customers will form their opinions about the organization and determine if they 
remain a customer or move on to another competitor. Because of this scenario 
(and others), organizations invest a major portion of their revenue and attention to 
improving their customer service.
In an August 2014 Harvard Business Review article titled, “The Value of Customer 
Experience, Quantified,” Peter Kriss states that “Intuitively, most people recognize the 
value of a great customer experience. Brands that deliver them are ones that we want 
to interact with as customers that we become loyal to, and that we recommend to our 
friends and family.” Also, he notes that the “value of delivering such an experience is 
often a lot less clear, because it can be hard to quantify.” Delivering consistent and 
concise knowledge to provide answers to customer inquiries in an efficient way leads 
to providing value to the customer and improving the overall customer experience.
In support of this trend of KM in customer service, the author of Forrester’s 
“Top Trends for Customer Service in 2015,” Kate Leggett, highlights in trend 4 
KM’s impact when she states “Knowledge will evolve from dialog to cognitive 
engagement. Organizations will look at ways to reduce the manual overhead of 
traditional knowledge management for customer service. They will start to explore 
cognitive engagement solutions, interactive computing systems that use artificial 
intelligence to collect information, automatically build models of understanding 
and inference, and communicate in natural ways. These solutions have the poten-
tial to automate knowledge creation, empower agents with deeply personalized 
answers and intelligence, scale a company’s knowledge capability, and uncover new 
revenue streams by learning about customer needs.”
IBM Watson is playing a significant role in the evolution of applications that 
automate knowledge creation by providing deeply personalized answers and 
intelligence. This technology will affect customer service as well as a multitude 
of industries with its capability to extract knowledge from big data sources. The 
IBM Watson ecosystem will provide deep content analytics and intensive scientific 
discovery that will lead to improved cognition contributing to an organization’s 
knowledge capabilities. This supports Kate Leggett’s research and points out that 
KM will continue to play a significant role in delivering knowledge and decision-
making capabilities to the customer service industry for the foreseeable future.
Technology Services Industry Association Research
In the Technology Services Industry Association’s (TSIA) 2014 second annual 
 survey on KM, TSIA documents the people, process, and technology components 

Summary ◾ 335
of technology service KM programs. It examines core metrics and practices related 
to knowledge capture, sharing, and maintenance, as well as video, crowd sourcing, 
and expertise management.
The TSIA research indicates that KM is no longer just of interest to technical 
support and call centers (I definitely agree with this!). The TSIA survey response was 
from groups other than customer support, which included 24% from professional 
services organizations. The TSIA research states that “KM is seen as a key way to 
improve efficiency, and a third of respondents said they could improve productivity 
by 30% or more if they were sharing knowledge effectively.”
The TSIA results centered on the effect of search (see Chapter 4),  knowledge 
capture (see Chapter 6), and social media (see Chapter 3), and how these  factors 
contribute to the overall KM strategy. In regard to search, the TSIA results indicate 
that a KM strategy “that enables unified search is becoming increasingly impor-
tant, not only across service divisions, but across the entire enterprises.” “The 
 digitalization of the workplace, i.e., the shift toward all enterprise technologies and 
processes being accessible online, is driving this trend.” To further support the need 
for search, the TSIA research states that “case-deflecting and case-resolving content 
typically resides across the enterprise, and making it easily findable and usable by 
customers and employees alike has elevated the role of search.”
In regard to knowledge capture, the TSIA research indicates that there are 
growing concerns about senior workers leaving organizations and taking their 
knowledge and expertise with them. The research results show that CIOs are push-
ing company-wide knowledge programs in order to capture knowledge/learning 
from employees in a searchable and shareable format.
In regard to social media, the TSIA research indicates that younger employees 
and customers having grown up in the social media era are more open to sharing 
information than previous generations. With adoption of enterprise collaboration 
tools on the rise, new streams, formats, and sources of enterprise knowledge are being 
created. This consists largely of unstructured content (social chats, team forums, 
etc.), and this must be incorporated into a broader KM strategy, and be made eas-
ily accessible/findable by customers and employees (see the section on information 
architecture in Chapter 4 to see how content can be made better accessible).
State of KM Survey
In the State of Knowledge Management survey of customer experience, which was 
conducted in order to better understand how they’re using KM, Esteban Kolsky 
and IntelliResponse indicate the following:
 
◾A total of 56% of organizations have a KM program in place, whereas 44% 
do not. A primary use of KM is in the customer service area. Actual percent-
age breakdowns when asked to select all that apply are customer service 83%, 

336 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
sales 33%, marketing 44%, accounting/finance 12%, human resources 11%, 
and training 33%.
 ◾Organizations as a whole have a lot to learn about KM. The survey indicates 
that the majority of organizations today do not have high competencies in KM.
 
◾Organizations are not realizing the benefits of KM that was originally 
projected.
This might reveal a level of misunderstanding in companies as to precisely how KM 
should be expected to deliver value. And yet organizations that do have a handle on 
how to use KM to drive value are able to clearly identify the value they have derived.
KM solution engagement is lower than expected. A high percentage (44%) 
of companies cites lack of usage as the main challenge with their KM initiative. 
Knowing that people tend to avoid using what they don’t understand, plenty of 
ground can potentially be gained by companies that do a better job of promoting 
their KM strategy—including what it is, how their KM tools are to be used, and 
the benefits the company and employees should expect to achieve.
KM investment is growing. The survey indicates that half of the companies 
 surveyed report some growth in their KM investment. The survey supports the need 
for a KM strategy that includes metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that 
will deliver measurable expectations. In addition, a KM strategy must indicate an 
understanding of what technologies will best serve the goals for delivering knowledge 
to customers, and a means to report on the success of KM initiatives.
Global View of KM
In reviewing the 2015 Global Knowledge Management Observatory Report, David 
Griffiths, Abi Jenkins, and Zoe Kingston-Griffiths state “The Knowledge 
Management function in many organizations is in a state of general decline.” This, 
as they indicate, is due to the following factors:
 
◾Satisfaction in KM’s contribution to strategic and operational objectives 
within organizations is often poor.
 
◾KM lacks maturity and integration within the vast majority of organizations.
 
◾KM continues to be predominantly seen as a technology-led function.
 
◾Satisfaction with technology-led KM solutions is not improving.
 
◾Many KM professionals do not appear to have the necessary awareness and/
or permissions required to respond to unmet demand for KM activities in 
organizations.
 
◾KM, as a field or area of practice, is argued to be suffering from a lack of 
specialist practitioners.
 
◾The value and/or significance of KM activities is still not being appropriately 
recognized or reported within most organizations.

Summary ◾ 337
Solutions that address many of the findings of the 2015  Global Knowledge 
Management Observatory Report have been presented in this book; they include 
producing a comprehensive KM strategy, KM education options, adopting KM 
programs, project and systems, and why KM programs/projects fail. The findings 
in this report present a tremendous opportunity for growth in the KM field.
Future Edition of Knowledge Management in Practice
A future edition of Knowledge Management in Practice will include more in regard 
to KM’s impact on customer service, how KM and big data are evolving, internal 
KM, KM in politics, the integration of KM and CRM systems, and personal KM 
and wearable technology.
KM Impact on Customer Service
KM’s impact on customer service will continue to focus on speed to provide answers 
to questions, improve customer satisfaction, and eliminate churn when it comes to 
finding and communicating knowledge to the customer.
 
◾Speed to answer: Customers want answers fast. Customers are not likely to 
wait long for answers, even less in a social media setting. The overabundance 
of channels has made it impossible for organizations to deliver proper answers 
via all channels fast. However, the rise of self-service using KM has led to 
great results in speed and accuracy of answers. As customers find the answers 
on their own (assisted in part by knowledge bases, but also via social media 
communities), the need for fast answers is met by better use of technology 
powered by KM.
 
◾Customer satisfaction: This is a byproduct of faster speed to answer. By pro-
viding the right answer quickly, customer satisfaction is increased. In order 
to meet customer expectations for the right knowledge, at the right time, in 
the right context, KM is used as a critical tool. Not having access to the right 
knowledge is the most critical time wasted in preparing any answer for a 
customer. If the knowledge is not available quickly, it is nearly impossible to 
deliver against expectations. Using KM appropriately to fulfill the need for 
the right knowledge leads to meeting customer expectations.
 
◾Churn: Among the leading reasons for employees churning in any job is lack 
of proper tools, and this is even more prevalent in customer service. Having 
to hunt for knowledge among different systems, tools, and channels causes 
churn. In addition, as customers take to more channels and processes become 
automated, only complex processes will be left to be resolved by customer 
service, and, in those cases, the right tools can make a difference between 

338 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
a resolution and a frustrated caller that needs to be escalated to yet further 
 service levels. Finding the right knowledge is a key to delivering the right 
answer to the customer. When customer service representatives have the right 
access to the right knowledge, they will more happily answer the interactions 
fast and effectively eliminate the chances for churn.
More on KM and Big Data
In recent years, the ability to manage data, information, and knowledge to gain 
competitive advantage and the importance of business analytics for this process has 
been well established. Organizations continue to investigate ways to efficiently and 
effectively collect and manage the data, information, and knowledge that they are 
exposed to. As the proliferation of structured and unstructured data continues to 
grow, we will continue to have a need to uncover the knowledge contained within 
these big data resources. KM and analytics will be key aspects in extracting knowl-
edge from big data. Strategy, process-centric approaches, and interorganizational 
aspects of decision support to research on new technology and academic endeavors 
in this space will continue to provide insights into how we process big data.
Internal KM
Internal KM focuses inward within the organization. This inward focus is aimed 
at maximizing the intellectual capital found in the organization. This intellectual 
capital resides both within the organization’s human capital and within the various 
systems (i.e., knowledge repositories, portals, wikis, blogs, CRMs, and collaborative 
environments). Internal KM specifically supports the organization’s flow of substan-
tive expertise and is aimed at improving operational efficiency. An organization’s 
KM framework must support its internal knowledge needs. This support will yield 
improved quality and efficiency of staff, outside consultants, and project teams.
Internal KM will enable your organization to gain the advantage of leveraging all 
existing knowledge resources available through your organization’s entire network of 
available explicit and tacit (people) knowledge. Enabling and improving the mecha-
nisms that deliver internal KM will continue to be prevalent as KM matures within 
an organization. This is a key reason for examining this area of KM in a future 
edition of Knowledge Management in Practice.
KM in Politics
KM as a political activity, made by and instituted by political leaders, will be the 
subject of this chapter. The research is interesting because given that we live in a 

Summary ◾ 339
knowledge society, in the information era, it is more or less obvious that the politi-
cal leaders should also do KM. Illustrating the ideas of KM implementation and 
use with the example of President Obama and other politicians has incorporated 
KM in executing their political strategy. KM always was and nowadays is pervasive 
in the activity of political leaders.
Incorporating the use of blogs, YouTube, and other social networking sites 
(Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn), President Obama’s team was able to push out 
the latest news, information, and knowledge about every aspect of his campaign. 
This increased the involvement of every supporter enabling them to feel a part of 
the campaign from start to finish. Supporters received text messages and emails 
at every turn encouraging them to hold parties with friends to get out the vote and 
donate their time and yes their money.
Leveraging the internet in a precise strategic manner that supports the mission 
of political campaigns is exactly how all organizations leveraging KM (getting the 
right knowledge to the right people at the right time) are positioning themselves 
in this evolving paradigm. I believe that many politicians and political organiza-
tions will utilize KM, and undoubtedly this will become a new trend in American 
politics.
KM and CRM
The business environment is transforming from product centric to customer centric. 
CRM as a customer-oriented business approach is considered as one of the powerful 
capabilities in organizations that help transform themselves to a customer-centric 
environment. The utilization of CRM is directly related with increase in customer 
knowledge, which in turn has a positive effect on customer satisfaction. By using 
KM, companies can improve their relationship with their valuable customers, thus 
creating loyal customers and obtaining a competitive advantage.
Organizations can create new ideas and provide improved and new services 
by the help of KM and the knowledge originating from CRM. The customer 
knowledge as an integral element of relationship between KM and CRM could 
help organizations to tailor their products and services and even the entire rela-
tionship with customers to increase customer satisfaction and finally economic 
profitability.
Personal KM and Wearable Technology
With all of the advances in technology becoming accessories for us to wear, have 
you thought about all of the information that is at your fingertips! Fitbits, Apple 
watch, Google glasses, and more… all deliver and collect information that allow us 
to make personal decisions during the course of the day. What to eat, drink, wear, 

340 ◾ Knowledge Management in Practice
how much we’re exercising (or not) are all decisions in some part influenced by our 
wearable tech!
Wearable technology is gathering information not only about us but also the 
environment around us. Where is this all taking us? Will our physicians have 
the capability to tap into all of this personal information? How about potential 
 advertisers? How can we capture the decisions we make from this information 
to improve our own lives? Is personal KM the key to taking control of our personal 
information created by these devices? These and more questions will be addressed 
in this future chapter.
Closing Statement
The goal of this edition of Knowledge Management in Practice was to provide the reader 
with specific key learnings, along with tips and techniques that will enable the KM 
practitioner to be more productive in their application of KM, and provide those 
who are being educated in KM with an understanding of the pertinent issues KM 
is solving across a variety of industries. In future editions, I will continue to present 
the evolution of KM, its importance, and how it can be of leverage for a competi-
tive advantage. In summary, it is my hope that Knowledge Management in Practice 
will be a definitive KM reference for anyone entering into the field and/or currently 
practicing KM.

344 ◾ Appendix A
Feasibility Describe the feasibility of the solution. To adequately complete this 
section, a feasibility study may need to be initiated to quantify the likelihood of 
achieving the desired KM initiative result. To assess the overall feasibility of this 
option, break the solution down into components and rate the feasibility of each 
component in the following table:
Component
Rating 
(1–10)
Method Used to Determine Feasibility
New KM 
technology 
5
A KM technology prototype was created to assess 
the solution
New people
8
A survey was completed to identify skill set 
availability
New processes 
3
Processes within similar organizations were 
reviewed
New assets
9
Physical assets were inspected
To ensure that the feasibility ratings are accurate, use all appropriate methods pos-
sible to identify the likely feasibility of the solution. For example, when adopting 
a new KM technology, develop a small prototype and test it to see if the resultant 
benefits match those expected from the exercise.
Risks Summarize the most apparent risks associated with the adoption of this 
solution. Risks are defined as any event which may adversely affect the ability of the 
solution to produce the required deliverables. Risks may be strategic, environmen-
tal, financial, operational, technical, industrial, competitive, or customer related. 
Complete the following table:
Description
Likelihood
Impact
Mitigating Actions
Inability to recruit 
skilled resource

company with proven 
industry experience and 
appropriately skilled staff

initiative to prove the 
technology solution will 
deliver the required results
Additional capital 
expenditure may be 
required in addition 
to that approved
Medium

management processes 
during the KM initiative

Appendix A ◾ 345
To complete this section thoroughly, it may be necessary to undertake a formal 
risk assessment (by documenting a risk management plan). To reduce the likelihood 
and impact of each risk’s eventuating, clear “mitigating actions” should be defined.
Issues Summarize the highest priority issues associated with the adoption of this 
option. Issues are defined as any event which currently adversely affects the ability 
of the solution to produce the required deliverables. Complete the following table:
Description
Priority
Resolution Actions
Required capital 
expenditure funds have 
not been budgeted
High
Request funding approval as part of 
this proposal
Required computer 
software is only at “beta” 
phase and has not yet 
been released live
Medium
Design solution based on current 
software version and adapt changes 
to solution once the final version of 
the software has been released
Regulatory approval must 
be sought to implement 
the final solution
Low
Initiate the regulatory approval 
process early, so that it does not 
delay the final roll-out process.
Upon approval of the business case, each issue should be formally recorded and 
tracked using an issue management process, forms, and register.
Assumptions List the major assumptions associated with the adoption of this 
option. Examples include the following:
 
◾There will be no legislative, business strategy, or policy changes during this 
KM initiative.
 
◾Prices of raw materials will not increase during the course of this KM 
initiative.
 
◾Additional human resource will be available from the business to support this 
KM initiative.
Recommended Option
This section compares the key characteristics of each solution option and recom-
mends a preferred solution option for implementation.
Reasons for Recommended Option
Based primarily on the highest total score achieved above, list here the “Recommended 
Option” for business case approval. Summarize the primary reasons why this option 
was chosen over the other options previously identified.

346 ◾ Appendix A
