         Each list in an account has its own messages, subscribers, and sign 
         up forms. You may set up as many in your account as you'd like. For  
         example, if you have multiple websites, you can have a list for each. 
 
 
1. To find your Current List, Go to Current List on Left Top of the page.  
          See the screenshot below (It shows the default list of your account) 
 
               
 
 
2. To select the list you'd like to work in, choose it from that box. 
 
3. Once you have the list you need to work on it. So as to navigate 
around its settings, you'll use the row of tabs and menu options at the 
top of the page. 
 
 
4. Use your mouse pointer over top any of the tabs and you'll find menu 
options. For example, if you want to search through your subscribers,  
move your mouse over the Subscribers tab, and then click on Search. 
 
              See the Screenshot below for reference ->> 
 
 
              
 
 
 
 

      Now that we know how to get around in the account, let's 
      set up our first list. 
 
             
              Creating a New List 
 
 
1. Click on Create and Manage lists.

3. Fill up the form which contains List Settings and Company 
Branding.  
 
     See the screenshot below ->> 
 
               
                     
 
 
 
 
4. Click on Save List Settings after filling the complete form. 
 
 
              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
     To edit the Existing List, follow the steps as shown below->> 
 
 
 
         
1. Move your mouse pointer to the My Lists tab and click on List 
Settings as shown in the screenshot below. 
 
 
                           
 
               
 
 
2. Write Description: Choose a few words to describe the subject 
of your list. When someone Clicks on the unsubscribe link at 
the bottom of your messages, they will be reminded of what it is 
they'd subscribed for with this value. 
 
 
3. List Name: This sets the name you'll see in the Current List 
box. Enter in your desired name, and wait a few seconds. Just 
beneath the box, you'll see either a green or red highlighted line 
letting you know of whether or not that name is available. 
 
 
                          See the Screenshot below for reference ->> 
              
 
 
                          
 
 

                    
 
 
 
 
4. Company Branding: There are a few places where you're 
subscribers will be directed to pages hosted on Aweber system.  
 
 
 
5. Fill the Company Branding as shown below:- 
 
         Company Name: Fill the Name of your company 
 
         Website URL: Enter the address for your website so   
         subscribers can visit from these pages using your link. 
 
         Logo URL: If you have a logo published on your website, copy  
         its location (URL address) and paste it in the box. 
 
         Divider Color: Type in a color name for divider or use the color   
         code, if you have it. 
 
 
6. Now put a Reply Address as shown in the screenshot below->> 
 
 
                          
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
7. Enter your name or the name of your company, something that 
your subscribers will recognize as soon as they open their e-
mail. Mark the "From/Reply" checkbox to specify this address 
as the one that you want to appear as the sender of the     
messages in your list.  
 
See the screenshot below for your reference ->> 
 
 
                          
 
 
 
              NOTE:  Avoid using e-mail addresses found at the domains of   
          free providers (e.g.@yahoo.com and @gmail.com) or Internet  
          Service Providers (ISPs like@verizon.net), since spammers  
          often use these for their reply addresses. 
          Needless to say, you don't want to be confused with  
          spammers. 
 
 
           
 
          Now that we are done with our lists, let's add the form to your   
          website. 
 
 
             
 
 

1. Go to web form and click on Create Web form. As shown in the 
screenshot below->> 
 
              
 
 
2. Choose the template from the templates available, load the template. 
Edit it as per your need (e.g. Header, footer, colors etc) and click on 
Go to step 2.  
 
 See the screenshot below ->> 
             
 
 
 

3. Now you can customize you web form by giving it a name and few 
other changes. Click on the Thank You Page and you will get 4 more 
options to choose (e.g. Audio, Video or Custom). Now select the 
custom option from the scroll down and enter your own Thank You or 
Return Page. This is the page people are send after subscribing, so 
this should be your Download Page with ad or your Platform Link. Do 
the same for Already Subscribed Page (For already subscribed 
visitors). Now click on Go to Step 3. 
 
             See the screenshot below ->> 
              
              
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
4. Now you will see three options to publish your web form. Choose I 
Will Install My Form. Now you can choose from JavaScript Snippet 
and Raw HTML. Usually, you’ll want to choose the default, 
“JavaScript Snippet” version for reasons of simplicity. 
 
See the screenshot below ->> 
 
             
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
5. When you're ready to publish the HTML to your site, just copy it to 
your clipboard. In order to publish the web form to your page, you'll 
need to have access to make changes to your website. You need to 
get to the HTML source of the page, so that you can copy the HTML 
and paste it in. 
 
Once you've found the HTML, just paste in what you've copied. 
 
See the screenshot below ->> 
              
 
 
              Save the changes. Now reload your webpage (making sure your  
         cache is clear in your browser so that it's loading the changes you  
         made). You should see your form published with a place for your   
         subscribers to opt-in to receive your information.
